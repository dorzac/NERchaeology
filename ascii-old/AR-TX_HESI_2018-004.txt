MANAGEMENT SUMMARY

Horizon Environmental Services, Inc. (Horizon) was selected by Future Link Technologies,
Inc. (Future Link) on behalf of Bastrop County to conduct a cultural resources inventory survey
and assessment for the proposed Tahitian Village Roadway Improvements Project in Bastrop,
Bastrop County, Texas. The proposed undertaking would involve construction of two new
segments of roadway located approximately 3.0 miles (4.8 kilometers) southeast of Bastrop
between State Highway (SH) 71 and the Colorado River.
These segments include
(1) approximately 1.6 miles (2.6 kilometers) of new roadway that would extend the intersection of
Oak Shadows Drive and County Road (CR) 191 (a.k.a. McAllister Road) northeastward to SH 71,
and (2) approximately 0.7 mile (1.1 kilometers) of roadway improvements and proposed new
roadway along Colovista Drive extending northwestward from the intersection of Colovista Drive
and River Forest Drive. The latter segment includes approximately 0.5 mile (0.8 kilometer) of
roadway improvements along an existing washed-out gravel segment of Colovista Drive plus
approximately 0.2 mile (0.3 kilometer) of new roadway connecting the northwestern end of
Colovista Drive southwestward to Ulupau Circle. Thus, the overall project area measures a total
linear distance of 2.3 miles (3.7 kilometers) in length within a 100.0-foot- (30.5-meter-) wide rightof-way (ROW).
Based on consultation conducted with the US Army Corps of Engineers, Fort Worth
District (USACE), and the Texas Historical Commission (THC), the cultural resources survey
focused on the portions of the overall ROW located adjacent to waterways crossing the proposed
road ROWs that qualify for designation as “Waters of the US” (WOUS) under Section 404 of the
Clean Water Act (CWA). For purposes of the cultural resources survey, survey activities were
conducted at four locations within the overall ROW that collectively measure approximately
1.3 miles (2.1 kilometers) in length by 100.0 feet (30.5 meters) in width, covering an area of
16.2 acres (6.6 hectares). Seven jurisdictional crossings had been identified within these four
locations. The proposed undertaking would involve construction of bridge-class culverts at each
of these crossings, designated as Culverts A, C, D, G, H, K, and J.
The proposed undertaking would be sponsored by Bastrop County, a political subdivision
of the state of Texas; as such, the project would fall under the regulatory jurisdiction of the
Antiquities Code of Texas. In addition, the project area would traverse seven stream channels
that qualify as WOUSs under Section 404 of the CWA that require permitting by the USACE. As
such, those portions of the overall ROW that fall within the federal permit area would also fall

under the regulatory jurisdiction of Section 106 of the National Historic Preservation Act (NHPA).
As the proposed project represents a publicly sponsored undertaking, the project sponsor was
required to provide the applicable federal agencies and the THC, which serves as the State
Historic Preservation Office (SHPO) for the state of Texas, with an opportunity to review and
comment on the project’s potential to adversely affect historic properties listed on or considered
eligible for listing on the National Register of Historic Places (NRHP) and for designation as State
Antiquities Landmarks (SAL).
Horizon Project Archeologist Briana Nicole Smith, with the assistance of archeological
field technicians Jacob Lyons and Foster Duncan and under the overall direction of Jeffrey D.
Owens, Principal Investigator, performed an intensive cultural resources survey of the project
area from August 6 to 8, 2018, to locate any cultural resources that potentially would be impacted
by the proposed undertaking. Horizon’s archeologists traversed the archeological survey area on
foot and thoroughly inspected the modern ground surface for aboriginal and historic-age cultural
resources. The vast majority of the project area had been burned during the 2011 Bastrop County
Complex Fire. As a result, the vegetation is currently characterized by loblolly pine saplings,
blackjack oak saplings, hackberry, various grasses, and fallen, charred pines. Visibility of the
modern ground surface ranged from low (<30%) in more densely vegetated areas to high (100%)
on eroded uplands. Natural chert cobbles and gravels were abundant on the surface throughout
the project area, and much of it was thermally altered from the wildfire. Seven streams cross the
proposed road ROWs, including Pigeonroost Hollow, Copperas Creek, and various small,
unnamed tributaries.
In addition to pedestrian walkover and surface inspection, the Texas State Minimum
Archeological Survey Standards (TSMASS) require a minimum of 16 shovel tests per 1.0 mile
(1.6 kilometers) for each 100.0-foot- (30.5-meter-) wide transect for linear surveys. As such, a
minimum of 21 shovel tests would be required within the collective 1.3 miles (2.0 kilometers) of
survey area to meet the TSMASS requirements. Horizon excavated a total of 75 shovel tests,
thereby exceeding the TSMASS for a linear survey of this size. Shovel testing revealed gravelly
fine sandy loam overlying dense chert cobbles, sandstone, or clay at an average depth of
11.8 inches (30.0 centimeters) below surface on uplands, and loose, fine sand to an average
depth of 39.4 inches (100.0 centimeters) below surface near stream channels.
Three newly recorded archeological sites were documented during the survey—41BP963,
41BP964, and 41BP965. Site 41BP963 consists of an aboriginal lithic procurement area, and
sites 41BP964 and 41BP965 consist of aboriginal lithic scatters. Due to the lack of temporally
diagnostic artifacts, the three aboriginal sites date to unspecified prehistoric periods. The sites
were only assessed within the proposed road ROWs, and the boundaries of the sites may extend
outside of the proposed ROWs. No intact cultural features, temporally diagnostic artifacts, or
intact, subsurface archeological deposits were observed on any of the three sites, and the
investigated portions of the sites retain little potential to contribute meaningfully to an
understanding of the prehistoric past. The investigated portion of all three sites within the
investigated ROW are recommended as non-contributing to the overall eligibility of the sites for
designation as State Antiquities Landmarks (SAL) and for inclusion in the National Register of

Historic Places (NRHP). No further investigations are warranted within the proposed ROW on
these sites.
Based on the results of the survey-level investigations documented in this report, no
potentially significant cultural resources would be affected by the proposed undertaking. In
accordance with 36 CFR 800.4, Horizon has made a reasonable and good-faith effort to identify
historic properties within the project area. No cultural resources were identified that meet the
criteria for designation as SALs according to 13 TAC 26 or for inclusion in the NRHP according
to 36 CFR 60.4. Horizon recommends a finding of “no historic properties affected,” and no further
archeological work is recommended in connection with the proposed undertaking. However,
human burials, both prehistoric and historic, are protected under the Texas Health and Safety
Code. In the event that any human remains or burial objects are inadvertently discovered at any
point during construction, use, or ongoing maintenance in the project area, even in previously
surveyed areas, all work should cease immediately in the vicinity of the inadvertent discovery,
and the Texas Historical Commission (THC) should be notified immediately.

1.0 INTRODUCTION

Horizon Environmental Services, Inc. (Horizon) was selected by Future Link Technologies,
Inc. (Future Link) on behalf of Bastrop County to conduct a cultural resources inventory survey
and assessment for the proposed Tahitian Village Roadway Improvements Project in Bastrop,
Bastrop County, Texas. The proposed undertaking would involve construction of two new

2.0 ENVIRONMENTAL SETTING

2.1

PHYSIOGRAPHY AND HYDROLOGY

The project area is located along the eastern margin of the city of Bastrop in central
Bastrop County, Texas, near the boundary of two significant physiographic provinces—the
Edwards Plateau and the Blackland Prairie. The Blackland Prairie, the narrow physiographic
zone situated between the Edwards Plateau on the west and the Gulf Coastal Plain on the east,
is a low, rolling land that extends in a narrow band along the eastern edge of the Balcones fault
zone from the Red River Valley in northeastern Texas to the southern edge of the Edwards
Plateau. This is an area of low topographic relief and poor drainage in which water often ponds
after rainstorms and streams flow at very gentle gradients. The Edwards Plateau and Balcones
Escarpment are associated with a great fault system that arcs across Texas to form a distinct
boundary between uplands composed primarily of limestone bedrock and lower plains composed
mostly of softer rocks. In places, this boundary is marked by an abrupt scarp (the Balcones
Escarpment) and in others by a more gradational ramp, but the entire length of this transition zone
is a major ecotone in terms of topography, bedrock, hydrology, soil, vegetation, and animal life.
Physiographically, the project area is situated within the hilly Lost Pines Forest region
north of the Colorado River. Topography within the project area is characterized by prominent,
dissected uplands. Elevations within the project area ranges from approximately 350.0 feet
(106.7 meters) to 500.0 feet (152.4 meters) above mean sea level (amsl).
Hydrologically, the project area is situated within the Colorado River basin. At its closest
point, the Colorado River is located 1,033.5 feet (315.0 meters) southwest of the project area.
The Colorado River flows southeastward across the Blackland Prairie and the Gulf Coastal Plain,
ultimately discharging into the Gulf of Mexico a short distance northeast of Matagorda Bay.

2.2

GEOLOGY AND GEOMORPHOLOGY

Geologically, the project area is situated on Eocene-age sedimentary rock and sandstone
formations, while areas of alluvium may be present adjacent to major streams and rivers.
Specifically, the survey area traverses seven distinct soil units (Table 1; Figures 6 to 7) (NRCS
2018). These soil units consist of residuum weathered from sandstones and Eocene-age
formations as well as loamy and sandy alluvium of Holocene and Pleistocene age.

Aboriginal cultural resources are commonly encountered adjacent to streams and springs
as well as in upland settings in Central Texas. Historic-era resources may occur in virtually any
physiographic setting but are most common in urban settings and in rural areas suitable for
agriculture. The relative antiquity of the pre-Holocene-age uplands that characterize the project
area suggests that any cultural resources in these areas would be constrained to the modern
ground surface and/or in shallowly buried contexts in erosional settings lacking integrity and
depth. However, the Bosque and Sayers soil units, which are present within a small portion of
the proposed ROW, consist of Holocene-age alluvium; as such, these soil units have the potential
to contain subsurface cultural resources.

2.3

CLIMATE

Evidence for climatic change from the Pleistocene to the present is most often obtained
through studies of pollen and faunal sequences (Bryant and Holloway 1985; Collins 1995). Bryant
and Holloway (1985) present a sequence of climatic change for nearby east-central Texas from
the Wisconsin Full Glacial period (22,500 to 14,000 B.P.) through the Late Glacial period
(14,000 to 10,000 B.P.) to the Post-Glacial period (10,000 B.P. to present). Evidence from the
Wisconsin Full Glacial period suggests that the climate in east-central Texas was considerably
cooler and more humid than at present. Pollen data indicate that the region was more heavily
forested in deciduous woodlands than during later periods (Bryant and Holloway 1985). The Late
Glacial period was characterized by slow climatic deterioration and a slow warming and/or drying
trend (Collins 1995). In east-central Texas, the deciduous woodlands were gradually replaced by
grasslands and post oak savannas (Bryant and Holloway 1985). During the Post-Glacial period,
the east-central Texas environment appears to have been more stable. The deciduous forests
had long since been replaced by prairies and post oak savannas. The drying and/or warming
trend that began in the Late Glacial period continued into the mid-Holocene, at which point there
appears to have been a brief amelioration to more mesic conditions lasting from roughly 6,000 to
5,000 B.P. Recent studies by Bryant and Holloway (1985) indicate that modern environmental
conditions in east-central Texas were probably achieved by 1,500 years ago.
Bastrop County is located within the south-central climatic division. The modern climate
is typically dry to subhumid with long, hot summers and short, mild winters. The climate is
influenced primarily by tropical Maritime air masses from the Gulf of Mexico, but it is modified by
polar air masses. Tropical Maritime air masses predominate throughout spring, summer, and fall.
Modified polar air masses are dominant in winter and provide a continental climate characterized
by considerable variations in temperature.
On average throughout the past century, precipitation and temperature in Texas manifest
regional clines with mean annual precipitation totals declining fairly regularly from east to west
and mean annual temperature declining equally evenly from northwest to southeast (Larkin and
Bomar 1983). In Central Texas, climate has fluctuated from subtropical humid to subtropical
subhumid. Average annual precipitation totals 81.3 centimeters (32.0 inches) and temperature
averages 19°Celsius (C) (67°Fahrenheit [F]) annually, ranging from 36°C (96°F) in August (the
warmest month) to 15°C (59°F) in January (the coldest month). During this time, however, drier
periods lasting from three to seven years, when total annual rainfall ranged from 30.5 to
63.5 centimeters (12.0 to 25.0 inches), were followed by abnormally wet years with 114.3 to
127.0 centimeters (45.0 to 50.0 inches) of rainfall.
Two annual precipitation peaks, which typically occur in May and September, are
associated with frontal storms that form when southward-moving cool air masses collide with
warm, moist air masses moving inland from the Gulf of Mexico (Bomar 1983; Carr 1967). The
topographic discontinuity along the Balcones Escarpment lies directly in the path of the Gulf storm
trace and increases the lift in convective storms to produce extreme amounts of rainfall. Two
extreme examples are the excess of 91.4 centimeters (36.0 inches) of rain that fell within an 18hour period in the vicinity of Thrall, Texas, in September 1921, and the 55.9-centimeter (22.0-

inch) deluge that fell in less than three hours near O’Harris, Texas, in May 1935. Lower rainfall
amounts are characteristic of winter and late summer. In winter, frontal storms pass so frequently
that there is little time for moisture to increase, and prevailing upper-level winds from west to east
often dominate over meridional flow, meaning that much of the available moisture is derived from
the Pacific rather than from the Gulf of Mexico. In summer, cool fronts rarely penetrate into the
region, and rainfall occurs primarily as localized, thermal convective storms.

2.4

FLORA AND FAUNA

The project area is situated in the southwestern portion of the Texan biotic province (Blair
1950), an intermediate zone between the forests of the Austroriparian and Carolinian provinces
and the grasslands of the Kansan, Balconian, and Tamaulipan provinces (Dice 1943). Some
species reach the limits of their ecological range within the Texan province. The boundary,
characterized as “approximate,” between Blair’s (1950) Texan and Balconian provinces passes
through western Williamson County, northwest of the project area. Rainfall in the Texan province
is barely in excess of water need, and the region is classified as a C2 (moist subhumid) climate
with a moisture surplus index of from 0 to 20%.
Edaphic controls on vegetation types are important in the Texan biotic province, which is
located near the border between moisture surplus and moisture deficiency. Sandy soils support
oak-hickory forests dominated by post oak (Quercus stellata), blackjack oak (Q. marilandica), and
hickory (Carya buckleyi). Clay soils originally supported a tall-grass prairie, but much of this soil
type has been placed under cultivation. Dominant tall-grass prairie species include western
wheatgrass (Agrophyron smithii), silver beardgrass (Andropogon saccharoides), little bluestem
(Andropogon scoparius), and Texas wintergrass (Stipa leucotricha). Major areas of oak-hickory
forest include the Eastern and Western Cross Timbers, and major tall-grass prairie areas include
the Blackland, Grand, and Coastal prairies.
Some characteristic associations of the
Austroriparian province occur locally in the Texan province, such as a mixed stand of loblolly pine
(Pinus taeda) and blackjack and post oak in Bastrop County, as well as a series of peat and bog
marshes distributed in a line extending from Leon to Gonzales counties.
The fauna associated with this region are represented by a mixture of species from the
Austroriparian, Tamaulipan, Chihuahuan, Kansan, Balconian, and Texan biotic provinces. At
least 49 species of mammals occur in the Texan province, including Virginia opossum (Didelphis
virginiana), eastern mole (Scalopus aquaticus), fox squirrel (Sciurus niger), desert pocket gopher
(Geomys breviceps), fulvous harvest mouse (Reithrodontomys fulvescens), white-footed mouse
(Peromyscus leucopus), hispid cotton rat (Sigmodon hispidus), eastern cottontail rabbit
(Sylvilagus floridanus), raccoon (Procyon lotor), striped skunk (Mephitis mephitis), ground squirrel
(Citellus tridecemlineatus), white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginiana), hispid pocket mouse
(Perognathus hispidus), deer mouse (Peromyscus maniculatus), black-tailed jackrabbit (Lepus
californicus), pygmy mouse (Baiomys taylori), nine-banded armadillo (Dasypus novemcinctus),
and jaguar (Felis onca). Both species of Terrapene known from the Austroriparian province—
eastern box turtle (T. Carolina) and desert box turtle (T. ornata)—occur in the Texan.
Sixteen species of lizards, including seven grassland and nine forest species, are also
found, including green anole (Anolis carolinensis), eastern fence lizard (Sceloporus undulates),
14

Intensive Cultural Resources Survey of USACE Jurisdictional Areas within the Proposed
Tahitian Village Roadway Improvements Projects, Bastrop, Bastrop County, Texas

common ground skink (Leiolopisma laterale), and glass snake (Ophiosaurus ventralis) (grassland
species), as well as collared lizard (Crotaphytus collaris), Texas spiny lizard (Sceloporus
olivaceous), Texas horned lizard (Phrynosoma cornutum), and Great Plains skink (Eumeces
obsoletus) (forest species). Only five species of urodele fauna are known from this area, including
small-mouthed salamander (Ambystoma texanum), tiger salamander (Ambystoma tigrinum), and
eastern lesser siren (Siren intermedia), and the Texan province acts as a barrier to urodele
distribution between the endemic Balconian province fauna to the west and the Austroriparian
fauna to the east.
Anuran fauna is composed primarily of Austroriparian or otherwise widely distributed
species, including eastern spadefoot toad (Scaphiopus holbrookii), Gulf Coast toad (Bufo
valliceps), Woodhouse’s toad (Bufo woodhousii), southern cricket frog (Acris gryllus), southern
chorus frog (Pseudacris nigrita), gray treefrog (Hyla versicolor), green treefrog (Hyla cinerea),
North American bullfrog (Rana catesbeiana), northern leopard frog (Rana pipiens), and narrowmouthed toad (Microhyla carolinensis). Additional anuran species that fail to cross from the Texan
into the Austroriparian province include Pacific tree frog (Pseudacris clarkia), Strecker’s chorus
frog (Pseudacris streckeri), and striped whipsnake (Microhyla olivacea). Other reptile and
amphibian species common to this biotic zone include 6-lined racerunner (Aspidoscelis
sexlineata), rat snake (Ptyas mucosus), eastern hognose snake (Heterodon platirhinos), rough
green snake (Opheodrys aestivus), copperhead (Agkistrodon contortrix), western diamondback
rattlesnake (Crotalus atrox), Blanchard’s cricket frog (Acris crepitans), diamondback water snake
(Nerodia rhombifer), and Houston toad (Bufo houstonensis).
Common bird species include northern bobwhite (Colinus virginianus), eastern
meadowlark (Sturnella magna), mourning dove (Zenaida macroura), killdeer (Charadrius
vociferus), field sparrow (Spizella pusilla), red-tailed hawk (Buteo jamaicensis), turkey vulture
(Cathartes aura), belted kingfisher (Ceyrle alcyon), and mockingbird (Mimus polyglottos).
Small herds of bison and antelope were common during the late prehistoric and early
historic periods, but these species are no longer native to this region (Jurney et al. 1989:13-14).

3.0 CULTURAL BACKGROUND

The project area is located within Prewitt’s (1981, 1985) Central Texas Archeological
Region. The indigenous human inhabitants of Central Texas practiced a generally nomadic
hunting and gathering lifestyle throughout all of prehistory, and, in contrast to much of the rest of
North America, mobility and settlement patterns do not appear to have changed markedly through
time in this region.

3.1

PALEOINDIAN PERIOD (CA. 12,000 TO 8500 B.P.)

The initial human occupations in the New World can now be confidently extended back
before 12,000 B.P. (Dincauze 1984; Haynes et al. 1984; Kelly and Todd 1988; Lynch 1990;
Meltzer 1989). Evidence from Meadowcroft Rockshelter in Pennsylvania suggests that humans
were present in Eastern North America as early as 14,000 to 16,000 years ago (Adovasio et al.
1990), while more recent discoveries at Monte Verde in Chile provide unequivocal evidence for
human occupation in South America by at least 12,500 years ago (Dillehay 1989, 1997; Meltzer
et al. 1997). Most archeologists have historically discounted claims of much earlier human
occupation during the Pleistocene glacial period. However, recent investigations of the Buttermilk
Creek Complex in Bell County, Texas, have raised the possibility that a pre-Clovis culture may
have been present in North America as early as 15,500 years ago (Waters et al. 2011).
The earliest generalized evidence for human activities in Central Texas is represented by
the PaleoIndian period (12,000 to 8500 B.P.) (Collins 1995). This stage coincided with
ameliorating climatic conditions following the close of the Pleistocene epoch that witnessed the
extinction of herds of mammoth, horse, camel, and bison. Cultures representing various periods
within this stage are characterized by series of distinctive, relatively large, often fluted, lanceolate
projectile points. These points are frequently associated with spurred end scrapers, gravers, and
bone foreshafts. PaleoIndian groups are often inferred to have been organized into egalitarian
bands consisting of a few dozen individuals that practiced a fully nomadic subsistence and
settlement pattern. Due to poor preservation of floral materials, subsistence patterns in Central
Texas are known primarily through the study of faunal remains. Subsistence focused on the
exploitation of plants, small animals, fish, and shellfish, even during the PaleoIndian period. There
is little evidence in this region for hunting of extinct megafauna, as has been documented
elsewhere in North America. Rather, a broad-based subsistence pattern appears to have been
practiced throughout all prehistoric time periods. In Central Texas, the PaleoIndian stage is
divided into two periods based on recognizable differences in projectile point styles. These

H045-160048

17

Chapter 3.0: Cultural Background

include the Early PaleoIndian period, which is recognized based on large, fluted projectile points
(i.e., Clovis, Folsom, Dalton, San Patrice, and Big Sandy), and the Late PaleoIndian period, which
is characterized by unfluted lanceolate points (i.e., Plainview, Scottsbluff, Meserve, and
Angostura).

3.2

ARCHAIC PERIOD (CA. 8500 TO 1200 B.P.)

The onset of the Hypsithermal drying trend marks the beginning of the Archaic period
(8500 to 1200 B.P.) (Collins 1995). This climatic trend marked the beginning of a significant
reorientation of lifestyle throughout most of North America, but this change was far less
pronounced in Central Texas. Elsewhere, the changing climatic conditions and corresponding
decrease in the big game populations forced people to rely more heavily upon a diversified
resource base composed of smaller game and wild plants. In Central Texas, however, this
hunting and gathering pattern is characteristic of most of prehistory. The appearance of a more
diversified tool kit, the development of an expanded groundstone assemblage, and a general
decrease in the size of projectile points are hallmarks of this cultural stage. Material culture shows
greater diversity during this broad cultural period, especially in the application of groundstone
technology.
Traditionally, the Archaic period is subdivided into Early, Middle, and Late subperiods.
Changes in projectile point morphology are often used as markers differentiating these three
subperiods, though other changes in material culture occurred as well. Perhaps most markedly,
burned rock middens appear during the Middle Archaic subperiod, continuing into the Late
Archaic subperiod, and large cemeteries appear during the Late Archaic subperiod. In addition,
the increasing density of prehistoric sites through time is often considered to constitute evidence
of population growth, though differential preservation probably at least partially accounts for the
lower numbers of older sites.

3.3

LATE PREHISTORIC PERIOD (CA. 1200 TO 350 B.P.)

The onset of the Late Prehistoric period (1200 to 350 B.P.) (Collins 1995) is defined by
the appearance of the bow and arrow. In Central Texas, pottery also appears during the Late
Prehistoric period (though ceramics appear earlier in Southeast Texas). Use of the atlatl (i.e.,
spearthrower) and spear was generally discontinued during the Late Prehistoric period, though
they continued to be used in the inland subregion of Southeast Texas along with the bow and
arrow through the Late Prehistoric period (Patterson 1980, 1995; Wheat 1953). In Texas, unifacial
arrow points appear to be associated with a small prismatic blade technology. The Late
Prehistoric period is generally divided into two phases, the Austin and Toyah phases. Austin
phase sites occur earliest to the north, which has led some researchers (e.g., Prewitt 1985) to
suggest that the Austin-phase populations of Central Texas were migrants from the north, and
lack the ceramic industry of the later Toyah phase.

3.4

HISTORIC PERIOD (CA. 350 B.P TO PRESENT)

The first European incursion into what is now known as Texas occurred in 1519, when
Álvarez de Pineda explored the northern shores of the Gulf of Mexico. In 1528, Cabeza de Vaca

18

160048_arch_survey_report

Intensive Cultural Resources Survey of USACE Jurisdictional Areas within the Proposed
Tahitian Village Roadway Improvements Projects, Bastrop, Bastrop County, Texas

crossed South Texas after being shipwrecked along the Texas Coast near Galveston Bay;
however, de Vaca did not approach the Colorado River basin or the Bastrop region. It was not
until 1691, when Domingo Terán de los Ríos led an expedition along the route that became known
as the Camino Real, that exploration of this region began.
In the late 17th century, natives from northern Mexico and southern Texas began
migrating into Central Texas to escape forced occupation and labor in the Spanish mines and
missions and on Spanish ranches. At approximately the same time, horses stolen from the
Spanish had become an integral part of the Apache way of life. These mounted, nomadic bison
hunters of the High Plains enjoyed a tremendous advantage over their pedestrian enemies. They
terrorized native groups to the east and southeast of their High Plains homeland, forcing many to
flee, some into Central Texas (Newcomb 1993:2). Thus, the first Europeans into the region
encountered native groups fragmented by the growth of the Spanish missions, the raids of the
Apache, and the diseases that swept before the physical presence of Europeans. Their accounts,
therefore, do not provide direct analogues to prehistoric cultural patterns, but rather represent a
time of drastic cultural change (Collins 1995). A few indigenous cultural patterns may have
prevailed through time. Large, diffuse encampments composed of peoples with mixed ethnic
affiliations and small, band-sized residential camps date to this particular period in Central Texas
(Collins 1995:386). The smaller sites may represent indigenous groups.
Historical documents dating from the 1730s to 1800 make reference to remnants of native
groups living in the missions, primarily in Bexar County (Collins 1995). Toward the end of this
time, the Comanche began to move into Northwestern Texas from the high plains. Records of
their presence in Central Texas at this time tend to be highly biased since they are provided mostly
from the hostile perspective of Anglo settlers (Collins 1995).
During the early part of the 19th century, the Native American presence in Central Texas
was composed of small numbers of mission Indians, “far flung nomadic native groups (primarily
the Comanche)” (Collins 1995:387), with EuroAmerican settlers becoming increasingly common.
The Comanche presence began fading in the mid- to late 19th century. Their final expulsion
heralded the end of Native American presence in Central Texas.
In 1804, a Spanish fort was built on the Old San Antonio Road Colorado River crossing.
The self-proclaimed Baron of Bastrop, a German immigrant who had been given permission by
the Mexican government to settle near this crossing, established the settlement of Bastrop in
1823. Further attempts to settle the area failed until a new settlement was established by Stephen
F. Austin in 1827. Many well known Texas pioneers first settled in the Bastrop area. One of these
early settlers, James Burleson, owned a parcel of land that would become a portion of Buescher
State Park. The population of the Bastrop settlement at the time of the Texas Revolution was
around 400 individuals.
The railroad came to Bastrop in the early 1870s and helped establish logging as the major
local economic activity. Iron, coal, and manufacturing became important industries by the late
19th century. By 1900, the population of Bastrop County had increased to 26,845, up from around
7,000 at the start of the Civil War.

4.0 ARCHIVAL RESEARCH

Prior to initiating fieldwork, Horizon personnel reviewed the THC’s online Texas
Archeological Sites Atlas (TASA) and Texas Historic Sites Atlas (THSA), the National Park
Service’s (NPS) online National Register Information System (NRIS), and the Texas State
Historical Association’s (TSHA) The Handbook of Texas Online for information on previously
recorded archeological sites and previous archeological investigations conducted within a 1.0mile (1.6-kilometer) radius of the project areas. Based on this archival research, ten previously
recorded archeological sites are located within a 1.0-mile (1.6-kilometer) radius of the project area
(Table 2; Figure 8) (THC 2018). The ten known archeological sites are located outside of the
proposed ROWs and would not be disturbed as a result of the proposed undertaking. The
previously recorded archeological sites include four aboriginal campsites, five aboriginal lithic
scatters, and one aboriginal lithic quarry site.
One previous linear cultural resources survey conducted for a linear utility corridor crosses
the eastern portion of the project area that extends from Oak Shadows Drive to SH 71; however,
the vast majority of the project area has not been previously surveyed for cultural resources (THC
2018).

4.1

HISTORICAL MAP RESEARCH

No aerial photographs containing the project area could be found prior to 1995. However, a
review of historical topographic maps containing the project area revealed that no structures are
visible on these maps within the proposed ROWs at any time between 1950 and present (NETR
2018). Additionally, no artifacts or cultural features were observed within the proposed ROWs
during the survey that would indicate the presence of any historic-age cultural components.

5.0 SURVEY METHODOLOGY

Horizon staff archeologists performed an intensive cultural resources survey of the project
area from August 6 to 8, 2018, to locate any cultural resources that potentially would be impacted
by the proposed undertaking. Horizon’s archeologists traversed the archeological survey area on
foot and thoroughly inspected the modern ground surface for aboriginal and historic-age cultural
resources. The vast majority of the project area was burned during the 2011 Bastrop County
Complex Fire. As a result, the vegetation is characterized by recent growth, including loblolly pine
saplings, blackjack oak saplings, hackberry, various grasses, and fallen, charred pines. Visibility
of the modern ground surface ranged from low (<30%) in more densely vegetated areas to high
(100%) on eroded uplands. Natural chert cobbles and gravels were abundant on the modern
ground surface throughout the project area, and much of it was heavily burned from the wildfire.
Two major streams cross the proposed ROWs, Pigeonroost Hollow and Copperas Creek, along
with various smaller drainages and tributaries (Figures 9 to 17).
In addition to pedestrian walkover and surface inspection, the Texas State Minimum
Archeological Survey Standards (TSMASS) require a minimum of 16 shovel tests per 1.0 mile
(1.6 kilometers) for each 100.0-foot- (30.5-meter-) wide transect for linear surveys. As such, a
minimum of 21 shovel tests would be required within the collective 1.3 miles (2.0 kilometers) of
survey area to meet the TSMASS requirements. Horizon excavated a total of 75 shovel tests,
thereby exceeding the TSMASS for a linear survey of this size (Figures 18 to 20). Shovel testing
revealed gravelly fine sandy loam overlying dense chert cobbles, sandstone, or clay at an average
depth of 11.8 inches (30.0 centimeters) below surface on uplands, and loose, fine sand to an
average depth of 39.4 inches (100.0 centimeters) below surface near stream channels.
In general, shovel tests measured approximately 11.8 inches (30.0 centimeters) in
diameter, and all sediments were screened through 0.25-inch (6.35-millimeter) hardware cloth.
The Universal Transverse Mercator (UTM) coordinates of all shovel tests were determined using
hand-held Garmin eTrex 30x global positioning system (GPS) devices based on the North
American Datum of 1983 (NAD 83). Shovel test data are summarized in Appendix A. During the
survey, field notes were maintained on terrain, vegetation, soils, landforms, survey methods, and
shovel test results. Digital photographs were taken, and a photographic log was maintained.
Horizon employed a non-collection policy for cultural resources. Diagnostic artifacts (e.g.,
projectile points, ceramics, historic materials with maker’s marks) and non-diagnostic artifacts
(e.g., lithic debitage, burned rock, historic glass, and metal scrap) were described, sketched,
and/or photo-documented in the field and replaced in the same location in which they were found.

Three newly recorded sites—41BP963, 41BP964, and 41BP965—were documented within
the project area during the survey. During the site recording process, a standard site recording
form was used to record pertinent information on location, physiographic setting, and local
environmental characteristics; types and quantities of artifacts observed; distribution and
densities of artifacts; artificial and natural impacts; and the condition of surface and subsurface
archeological deposits. A scaled sketch map was drawn that illustrates the site boundary;
locations of shovel tests, cultural features, and/or material concentrations; as well as notable
features of the landscape. The sites were thoroughly photo-documented using color digital
photography, and a photographic log was maintained of all photographs taken. Based on the
information recorded on the standard archeological site recording form in the field, a Texas
Archeological Data Site Form was completed by Horizon’s laboratory personnel for the newly
recorded archeological sites using the most current version of the Texas Archeological Research
Laboratory’s (TARL) TexSite archeological data collection software. The completed TexSite
forms were submitted to TARL, and site trinomials were obtained for the newly recorded sites.
The survey methods employed during the survey represented a “reasonable and good-faith
effort” to locate significant archeological sites within the project area as defined in 36 Code of
Federal Regulations (CFR) 800.3.

6.0 RESULTS OF INVESTIGATIONS

Three newly recorded archeological sites—41BP963, 41BP964, and 41BP965—were
documented within the proposed ROWs during the cultural resources assessment (Figure 21).
The sites are discussed in detail below.

6.1

SITE 41BP963
General Description

Site 41BP963 consists of an aboriginal lithic procurement area situated along the slope
and summit of a prominent ridge approximately 278.9 feet (85.0 meters) north of Pigeonroost
Hollow in jurisdictional survey Location 2 (Figure 22). In 2011, the site was burned during the
Bastrop County Complex Fire. Chert cobbles and gravels are abundant on the surface of the site,
most of which were thermally altered during the wildfire. Multiple push piles around the site
containing chert gravels and burned loblolly pines indicate the site was cleared after the wildfire
occurred. A two-track road is also present through the center of the site. (Figures 23 to 24).
Vegetation on the site consists of blackjack oak saplings, loblolly pine saplings, grasses,
weeds and charred loblolly pines, both standing and fallen. Vegetation was dense on the southern
end of the site near Pigeonroost Hollow and sparser to the north on the summit of the landform,
allowing for higher ground surface visibility. Elevations across the site range from 430.0 to
490.0 feet (131.1 to 149.4 meters) amsl. A total of 10 shovel tests were excavated on site
41BP963, two of which were positive for subsurface cultural materials. The site was only recorded
within the confines of the proposed ROW, and the boundaries of the site may extend east and
west outside of the proposed ROW.
Horizontal and Vertical Extents of Cultural Materials
Based on the distribution of cultural materials on the modern ground surface as well as
subsurface in shovel tests within the proposed ROW, site 41BP963 measures approximately
945.0 feet (288.0 meters) north to south by 100.0 feet (30.5 meters) east to west within the
proposed ROW. Ten shovel tests were excavated within the final delineated boundaries of site
41BP963 (see Figure 22). Two of these shovel tests were positive for cultural materials from
3.9 to 23.6 inches (10.0 to 60.0 centimeters) below surface. Shovel testing revealed deep, loose
fine sandy soils on the southern end of the site near the stream and shallow, gravelly sandy soils
overlying sandstone bedrock or clay on the eroded northern end of the site.

Observed Cultural Features
No evidence of any cultural features was observed on the modern ground surface or within
any of the 10 shovel tests excavated on site 41BP963.
Observed Cultural Materials
A low-density scatter of tested chert cobbles, cores, and flakes was observed on the
modern ground surface of the site as well as subsurface within two shovel tests. Three bifaces
were also found outside of the proposed ROW within the dry Pigeonroost Hollow creek bed to the
south of the site and a dry tributary to the east of the site (Figures 25 to 26). These bifaces may
be associated with site 41BP963 or another nearby site. No temporally diagnostic tools were
observed on the site.
Summary and Recommendations
Site 41BP963 consists of a low-density aboriginal lithic procurement area of undetermined
prehistoric age located along a slope and summit of a ridge north of Pigeonroost Hollow. The site
was burned during the 2011 Bastrop County Complex Fire and was disturbed by subsequent
clearing events. Additionally, a two-track road bisects the site from north to south. The modern
ground surface is densely covered in natural chert gravels, much of which has been thermally
altered due to the wildfire. A low-density scatter of tested chert cobbles, cores, and flakes were
observed on the modern ground surface of the site as well as subsurface within shovel tests. A
total of 10 shovel tests were excavated within the final delineated boundaries of site 41BP963.
Two of these shovel tests were positive for cultural materials from 3.9 to 23.6 inches (10.0 to
60.0 centimeters) below surface in very loose, sandy soils.
As the site boundaries were delineated only within the proposed ROW, uninvestigated
portions of site 41BP963 could potentially extend beyond the currently documented site boundary.
As the entire extent of site 41BP963 was not assessed, its overall NRHP and SAL eligibility
remains undetermined. However, based on the lack of temporally diagnostic artifacts, preserved
flora or fauna, and intact archeological deposits, it is Horizon’s opinion that the portion of site
41BP963 within the proposed ROW is considered to be a non-contributing element to the site’s
overall NRHP/SAL eligibility. Therefore, no additional investigations are recommended on site
41BP963 in connected with the currently proposed undertaking.

SITE 41BP964
General Description

Site 41BP964 consists of a low-density, subsurface aboriginal lithic scatter located on the
slope and summit of a prominent ridge located south of Pigeonroost Hollow in jurisdictional survey
Location 2 (Figure 27). In 2011, the site was burned during the Bastrop County Complex Fire.
Chert cobbles and gravels are abundant on the surface of the site, most of which was thermally
altered during the wildfire. An overgrown two-track road runs northeast to southwest through the
middle of the site (Figures 28 to 29).

Chapter 6.0: Results of Investigations

Unlike site 41BP963 to the north, no evidence of recent clearing is present on the site; as
a result, vegetation is somewhat denser. Vegetation on site 41BP964 consists of blackjack oak
saplings, loblolly pine saplings, greenbrier, dewberry, mustang berry, prickly pear, grasses,
weeds, and charred loblolly pines, both standing and fallen (Figures 28 to 29). Elevations across
the site range from 400.0 to 460.0 feet (121.9 and 140.2 meters) amsl. Thirteen shovel tests were
excavated on site 41BP964, six of which were positive for subsurface cultural materials. The site
was only recorded within the confines of the proposed ROW, and the boundaries of the site may
extend outside of the proposed ROW.
Horizontal and Vertical Extents of Cultural Materials
Based on the distribution of cultural materials in shovel tests, site 41BP964 measures
approximately 1,076.1 feet (328.0 meters) northeast to southwest by an average of 100.0 feet
(30.5 meters) northwest to southeast. A total of 13 shovel tests were excavated within the final
delineated boundaries of site 41BP964 (see Figure 27). Six of these shovel tests were positive
for cultural materials from 7.9 to 39.4 inches (20.0 to 100.0 centimeters) below surface. Shovel
testing revealed deep, loose, fine sandy soils on the northeastern end of the site near the stream
and shallow, gravelly sandy soils overlying sandstone bedrock, dense chert gravels, or clay on
the southwestern end of the site approaching the summit of the eroded landform.
Observed Cultural Features
No evidence of any cultural features was observed on the modern ground surface or within
any of the 13 shovel tests excavated on site 41BP964.
Observed Cultural Materials
A low-density scatter of subsurface lithic materials was observed on the site, including one
core, five secondary flakes, 16 tertiary thinning flakes, and one large tertiary flake with a utilized
edge (Figures 30 to 31). No temporally diagnostic tools were observed on the site.
Summary and Recommendations
Site 41BP964 consists of a low-density aboriginal lithic scatter situated along the slope
and summit of a prominent ridge immediately south of Pigeonroost Hollow. In 2011, the site was
burned during the Bastrop County Complex Fire. The ground surface is densely covered in
natural chert gravels, much of which has been thermally altered due to the wildfire. All lithic
materials were observed subsurface within shovel tests. A total of 13 shovel tests were excavated
within the final delineated boundaries of site 41BP964. Six of these shovel tests were positive for
cultural materials from 7.8 to 39.4 inches (20.0 to 100.0 centimeters) below surface in loose,
sandy soils.
As the site boundaries were delineated only within the proposed ROW, portions of site
41BP964 could potentially extend beyond the currently documented site boundary. As the entire
extend of site 41BP964 was not assessed, its overall NRHP and SAL eligibility remains
undetermined. However, based on the lack of temporally diagnostic artifacts, preserved flora or
fauna, and intact stratified buried deposits, it is Horizon’s opinion that the investigated portion of

site’s overall NRHP/SAL eligibility. Therefore, no additional investigations are recommended on
site 41BP964 in connected with the currently proposed undertaking.

6.3

SITE 41BP965
General Description

Site 41BP965 consists of a low-density aboriginal lithic scatter situated along the western
slope of a prominent ridge immediately east of Copperas Creek within jurisdictional survey
Location 4 (Figure 32). A heavily eroded two-track road runs northwest to southeast through the
center of the site. In 2011, the site was burned during the Bastrop County Complex Fire. Dense
chert gravels are abundant on the surface of the site, most of which are thermally altered due to
the wildfire (Figures 33 to 34). Artifacts were found both on the surface of the site eroding out of
the two-track road as well as subsurface within shovel tests. A total of seven shovel tests were
excavated on site 41BP965, three of which were positive for subsurface cultural materials.
Vegetation on the site consists of blackjack oak saplings, loblolly pine saplings, grasses,
weeds, and fallen burned pine trees. Elevations across the site range from 340.0 to 360.0 feet
(103.6 to 109.7 meters) amsl. The site was only recorded within the confines of the proposed
ROW; however, artifacts appear to be eroding downhill from the summit of the ridge. Therefore
the boundaries of the site likely continue outside of the proposed ROW towards the apex of the
landform.
Horizontal and Vertical Extents of Cultural Materials
Based on the distribution of cultural materials on the modern ground surface as well as
subsurface in shovel tests within the proposed ROW, site 41BP965 measures approximately
213.3 feet (65.0 meters) northwest to southeast by an average of 213.3 feet (65.0 meters)
northeast to southwest. A total of seven shovel tests were excavated within the final delineated
boundaries of site 41BP965 (see Figure 32). Three of these shovel tests were positive for cultural
materials from 3.9 to 25.6 inches (10.0 to 65.0 centimeters) below surface. Shovel testing
revealed loose, fine sandy soils overlying eroding sandstone bedrock or dense chert cobbles.
Observed Cultural Features
No evidence of any cultural features was observed on the modern ground surface or within
any of the seven shovel tests excavated on site 41BP965.
Observed Cultural Materials
Observed cultural materials on site 41BP965 included two primary flakes, seven
secondary flakes, six tertiary flakes, two cores, and one thermally altered biface (Figures 35
to 36). No temporally diagnostic artifacts were observed on the site.

Summary and Recommendations
Site 41BP965 consists of a low-density aboriginal lithic scatter of undetermined prehistoric
age situated on a gentle western slope above Copperas Creek. The site is bisected by a heavily
eroded two-track road and was burned during the 2011 Bastrop County Complex Fire. Dense
chert gravels are abundant on the surface of the site, most of which are thermally altered due to
the wildfire. Artifacts were found both on the surface of the site eroding out of the two-track road
as well as subsurface within shovel tests. A total of seven shovel tests were excavated within the
final delineated boundaries of site 41BP965, three of which were positive for subsurface cultural
materials.
As the site boundaries were delineated only within the proposed ROW, portions of site
41BP965 could potentially extend beyond the currently documented site boundary. As the entire

7.0 SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS

7.1

CONCEPTUAL FRAMEWORK

The archeological investigations documented in this report were undertaken with three
primary management goals in mind:



Locate all historic and prehistoric archeological resources that occur within the
designated survey area.



Evaluate the significance of these resources regarding their potential for inclusion in
the NRHP and for designation as SALs.



Formulate recommendations for the treatment of these resources based on their
NRHP and SAL evaluations.

At the survey level of investigation, the principal research objective is to inventory the
cultural resources within the project area and to make preliminary determinations of whether or
not the resources meet one or more of the pre-defined eligibility criteria set forth in the state and/or
federal codes, as appropriate. Usually, management decisions regarding archeological
properties are a function of the potential importance of the sites in addressing defined research
needs, though historic-age sites may also be evaluated in terms of their association with important
historic events and/or personages. Under the NHPA and the Antiquities Code of Texas,
archeological resources are evaluated according to criteria established to determine the
significance of archeological resources for inclusion in the NRHP and for designation as SALs,
respectively.
Analyses of the limited data obtained at the survey level are rarely sufficient to contribute
in a meaningful manner to defined research issues. The objective is rather to determine which
archeological sites could be most profitably investigated further in pursuance of regional,
methodological, or theoretical research questions. Therefore, adequate information on site
function, context, and chronological placement from archeological and, if appropriate, historical
perspectives is essential for archeological evaluations. Because research questions vary as a
function of geography and temporal period, determination of the site context and chronological
placement of cultural properties is a particularly important objective during the inventory process.

Chapter 7.0: Summary and Recommendations

7.2

ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA FOR INCLUSION IN THE NATIONAL REGISTER OF HISTORIC
PLACES

Determinations of eligibility for inclusion in the NRHP are based on the criteria presented
in the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) in 36 CFR §60.4(a-d). The 4 criteria of eligibility are
applied following the identification of relevant historical themes and related research questions:
The quality of significance in American history, architecture, archeology, and culture is
present in districts, sites, buildings, structures, and objects that possess integrity of
location, design, setting, materials, workmanship, feeling, and association, and:
a. [T]hat are associated with events that have made a significant contribution to the
broad patterns of our history; or,
b. [T]hat are associated with the lives of persons significant in our past; or,
c.

[T]hat embody the distinctive characteristics of a type, period, or method of
construction, or that represent a significant and distinguishable entity whose
components may lack individual distinction; or,

d. [T]hat have yielded, or may be likely to yield, information important in prehistory or
history.

The first step in the evaluation process is to define the significance of the property by
identifying the particular aspect of history or prehistory to be addressed and the reasons why
information on that topic is important. The second step is to define the kinds of evidence or the
data requirements that the property must exhibit to provide significant information. These data
requirements in turn indicate the kind of integrity that the site must possess to be significant. This
concept of integrity relates both to the contextual integrity of such entities as structures, districts,
or archeological deposits and to the applicability of the potential database to pertinent research
questions. Without such integrity, the significance of a resource is very limited.
For an archeological resource to be eligible for inclusion in the NRHP, it must meet legal
standards of eligibility that are determined by three requirements: (1) properties must possess
significance, (2) the significance must satisfy at least one of the four criteria for eligibility listed
above, and (3) significance should be derived from an understanding of historic context. As
discussed here, historic context refers to the organization of information concerning prehistory
and history according to various periods of development in various times and at various places.
Thus, the significance of a property can best be understood through knowledge of historic
development and the relationship of the resource to other, similar properties within a particular
period of development. Most prehistoric sites are usually only eligible for inclusion in the NRHP
under Criterion D, which considers their potential to contribute data important to an understanding
of prehistory. All four criteria employed for determining NRHP eligibility potentially can be brought
to bear for historic sites.

7.3

ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA FOR LISTING AS A STATE ANTIQUITIES LANDMARK

The criteria for determining the eligibility of a prehistoric or historic cultural property for
designation as an SAL are presented in Chapter 191, Subchapter D, Section 191.092 of the
Antiquities Code of Texas, which states that SALs include:
Sites, objects, buildings, artifacts, implements, and locations of historical, archeological,
scientific, or educational interest including those pertaining to prehistoric and historical
American Indians or aboriginal campsites, dwellings, and habitation sites, their artifacts
and implements of culture, as well as archeological sites of every character that are located
in, on, or under the surface of any land belonging to the State of Texas or to any county,
city, or political subdivision of the state are state antiquities landmarks and are eligible for
designation.

For the purposes of assessing the eligibility of a historic property for designation as an
SAL, a historic site, structure, or building has historical interest if the site, structure, or building:
1. [W]as the site of an event that has significance in the history of the United States or
the State of Texas;
2. [W]as significantly associated with the life of a famous person;
3. [W]as significantly associated with an event that symbolizes an important principle or
ideal;
4. [R]epresents a distinctive architectural type and has value as an example of a period,
style, or construction technique; or,
5. [I]s important as part of the heritage of a religious organization, ethic group, or local
society.

The Antiquities Code of Texas establishes the THC as the legal custodian of all cultural
resources, historic and prehistoric, within the public domain of the State of Texas. Under Part II
of Title 13 of the Texas Administrative Code (13 TAC 26), the THC may designate a historic
building, structure, cultural landscape, or non-archeological site, object, or district as an SAL if it
meets at least on one of following criteria:
A. [T]he property is associated with events that have made a significant contribution to
the broad patterns of our history, including importance to a particular cultural or ethnic
group;
B. [T]he property is associated with the lives of persons significant in our past;
C. [T]he property embodies the distinctive characteristics of a type, period, or method of
construction, represents the work of a master, possesses high artistic values, or
represents a significant and distinguishable entity whose components may lack
individual distinction;
D. [T]he property has yielded, or may be likely to yield, information important in Texas
culture or history.

H045-160048

53

Chapter 7.0: Summary and Recommendations

Furthermore, the THC may designate an archeological site as an SAL if the site meets
one or more of the following criteria:
1. [T]he site has the potential to contribute to a better understanding of the prehistory
and/or history of Texas by the addition of new and important information;
2. [T]he site’s archeological deposits and the artifacts within the site are preserved and
intact, thereby supporting the research potential or preservation interests of the site;
3. [T]he site possesses unique or rare attributes concerning Texas prehistory and/or
history;
4. [T]he study of the site offers the opportunity to test theories and methods of
preservation, thereby contributing to new scientific knowledge; or,
5. [T]he high likelihood that vandalism and relic collecting has occurred or could occur,
and official landmark designation is needed to ensure maximum legal protection, or
alternatively further investigations are needed to mitigate the effects of vandalism and
relic collecting when the site cannot be protected.

7.4

SUMMARY OF INVENTORY RESULTS

Three newly recorded archeological sites were documented during the survey—41BP963,
41BP964, and 41BP965. Site 41BP963 consists of an aboriginal lithic procurement area, and
sites 41BP964 and 41BP965 consist of aboriginal lithic scatters. Due to the lack of temporally
diagnostic artifacts, the three aboriginal sites date to unspecified prehistoric periods. The sites
were only assessed within the proposed road ROWs, and the boundaries of the sites may extend
outside of the proposed ROWs. No intact cultural features, temporally diagnostic artifacts, or
intact, subsurface archeological deposits were observed on any of the three sites, and the
investigated portions of the sites retain little potential to contribute meaningfully to an
understanding of the prehistoric past. The investigated portion of all three sites within the
investigated ROW are recommended as non-contributing to the overall eligibility of the sites for
designation as SALs and for inclusion in the NRHP. No further investigations are warranted within
the proposed ROW on these sites.

7.5

MANAGEMENT RECOMMENDATIONS

Based on the results of the survey-level investigations documented in this report, no
potentially significant cultural resources would be affected by the proposed undertaking. In
accordance with 36 CFR 800.4, Horizon has made a reasonable and good-faith effort to identify
historic properties within the project area. No cultural resources were identified that meet the
criteria for designation as SALs according to 13 TAC 26 or for inclusion in the NRHP according
to 36 CFR 60.4. Horizon recommends a finding of “no historic properties affected,” and no further
archeological work is recommended in connection with the proposed undertaking. However,
human burials, both prehistoric and historic, are protected under the Texas Health and Safety
Code. In the event that any human remains or burial objects are inadvertently discovered at any
point during construction, use, or ongoing maintenance in the project area, even in previously

54

surveyed areas, all work should cease immediately in the vicinity of the inadvertent discovery,
and the THC should be notified immediately.
