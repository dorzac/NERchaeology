ABSTRACT
An archaeological survey along a 0.52-mile segment (0.83 acre) of Forest Service
Road 556 A-2 in Track K-1b-III and Compartment 23 of the Davy Crocket National Forest
in eastern Houston County was conducted by Brazos Valley Research Associates (BVRA)
on June 17, 2008. The investigation was conducted by a 100% Pedestrian Survey of the
road accompanied by shovel testing. No evidence of a prehistoric site or historic site was
observed, and no artifacts were collected. The road does not cross any major creeks, and
the soils in the area consist of firm clay at the surface in most places. Therefore, the
length of road examined does not appear to be in a high probability area for a prehistoric
site. It is recommended that the landowner not be required to retain a professional
archaeologist for more work in this area. Copies of the final report are on file at the Office
of the National Forests and Grasslands in Lufkin, Davy Crockett National Forest in Ratcliff
Texas Historical Commission (THC), Texas Archeological Research Laboratory (TARL),
and BVRA. The records are housed at the National Forests and Grasslands in Lufkin.

INTRODUCTION
In order to obtain legal access to private property surrounded by Forest
Service land, a Special Use Permit is required. This permit calls for the area to be
examined by an archaeologist and a biologist. The landowner (William Vance)
retained BVRA to conduct an archaeological survey along Forest Service Road 556
A-2 that is located in Track K-1b-III and Compartment 23 of the Davy Crockett
National Forest in eastern Houston County (Figure 1). The project area is depicted on
the United States Geological Survey 7.5â topographic quadrangle Ratcliff (3195-143)
(Figure 2). No biological assessment was performed.

ENVIRONMENTAL SETTING
The project area is located within the West Gulf Coastal Plain section of the
Coastal Plain physiographic province as defined by Fenneman (1938:100-120).
Fenneman subdivides this province according to the age of the geological formations
(Gulf series) that roughly parallel the Texas coastline. The area is hilly and situated
within the East Texas timber belt. Gould (1969) describes it as an area characterized
by gently rolling to hilly topography with light colored soils that are acid sandy loams or
sands. The climate is subhumid to humid, and the weather is considered to be
predominately warm. Annual rainfall for Angelina County is 38.9 inches. A January
minimum temperature of 42 degrees Fahrenheit and a July maximum temperature of
95 degrees Fahrenheit combine to produce a growing season of 274 days (Kingston
and Harris 1983:180). The altitude varies from 200-400 feet.
According to the soil survey for Houston County (Steptoe 2002), there are
four soil types in the project area. They are Attoyac fine sandy loam, 1 to 3 percent
slopes (AtB), Bowie fine sandy loam, 1 to 3 percent slopes, (BwB), Sacul fine sandy
loam, 1 to 3 percent slopes (SaB), and Woodtell very fine sandy loam, 5 to 15
percent slopes (WoE). AtB soils are deep sandy soils found on toeslopes in pine and
hardwood forests. They are well drained, and the water table is more than six feet.
BwB soils are moderately deep sandy soils found in the uplands on footslopes or
toeslopes. They are well drained, and the water table is greater than six feet. SaB
soils are deep sandy soils found in the uplands on footslopes or toeslopes. They are
moderately well drained, and the water table is perched at two to four feet during
December through April. WoE soils are deep sandy soils found in the uplands on
side slopes. They are well drained, and the water table is greater than six feet.

ARCHAEOLOGICAL BACKGROUND
According to a published planning document for the Eastern Planning Region of
Texas (Kenmotsu and Perttula 1993:Figure 1.1.2), Houston County is situated within
the Southeast Texas archeological study region. In 1985, according to a statistical
overview published by the Texas Historical Commission (Biesaart et al. 1985:114),
there were nine documented prehistoric sites in the county. The archaeological
potential of Houston County is reflected in part by the increasing number of recorded
sites found as a result of numerous cultural resource management studies. As a result
of these investigations, the number of recorded sites now stands at over 260 (TARL
site files). Small and large area surveys have been conducted in Houston County, and
the majority of these did not locate archaeological sites. According to the TARL site
records, 87 archaeological surveys and related projects have been carried out in
Houston County, and only 24 discuss archaeological sites or resulted in the
identification of previously unrecorded sites. Most of the areas investigated in the
county were associated with oil and gas projects (n=60), and the majority of these
studies were performed by James E. Corbin. Other projects include two field schools
sponsored by the University of Texas at Austin in 1977 and 1982, water distribution
lines, transmission lines, a fiber optic cable project, the proposed Bedias Reservoir, the
Tennessee Colony Reservoir, a city park, and survey of the Davy Crocket National
Forest and Mission Tejas State Park. These studies date to the 1970s (n=5), 1980s
(n=36), 1990s (n=39), and 2000s (n=3). Most of the early recorded sites were
documented by landowners and amateur archaeologists, and some of these are
potentially significant such as 41HO1 which was recorded by Edward B. Jelks in 1954
as a site containing glass beads, lead bullets, gun parts, arrow points, and sherds. A
second interesting site is 41HO6. It was documented by Alex D. Krieger in 1944 as a
location where a small cannon was uncovered in 1940 during plowing of a field by the
landowner.
Several investigations have been conducted in Southeast Texas that are
relevant to interpreting the archaeology of the project area. In fact, the project area is
in the center of a region that has been the recipient of several major reservoir
construction projects. Other, smaller projects have been conducted by private
archaeological contract firms, state agencies such as the Texas Department of
Transportation and the Texas Water Development Board, and amateur archaeologists.
Reservoirs in the area that have been examined by archaeologists include Addicks and
Barker (Wheat 1953), Lake Livingston (Nunley 1963), Wallisville (Shafer 1966; Ambler
1970), and Lake Creek (Boyd and Button 1985).

Works which have sought to synthesize prehistoric data relevant to the project
area include an early contribution by Sayles (1935) and the writings of Hole (1974),
Shafer (1975), Shafer and Stearns (1975), Shafer et al. (1975), Patterson (1979,
1983), Ambler (1973), Story (1981), Story et al. (1990), and Aten (1983). The latest
work, an expansion of Atenâs (1979) doctoral dissertation, is a particularly ambitious
and useful attempt to integrate ethno-historical, archaeological, and geo-morphological
data for the Upper Texas Coast. Other important sources are a planning document by
the Texas Historical Commission (Martin et al. 1995) and an overview of the National
Forests in Texas by John Ippolito (1983).
The nearest group of sites in the area consists of five sites that were recorded
during the University of Texas Field School in 1977 in the Davy Crockett National
Forest (Fields 1979). Sites 41HO26 â 41HO29 and 41HO51 were recorded along
Hickory Creek. These sites are described as artifacts scatters and a single lithic flake
located on rises or terraces adjacent to the Hickory Creek floodplain and in the uplands
above the creek. Only one site (41HO26) contained diagnostic artifacts, and it dates to
the Late Prehistoric period based on the presence of ceramics. Section 106 review
was conducted for a Forest Service timber project within the area in the early 1980s. It
should be stated here that survey techniques in those days often did not involve shovel
testing. Therefore, it is possible a site could have been overlooked during this study.

METHODS OF INVESTIGATION
Prior to entering the field, the site records at TARL and the Archeological Sites
Atlas were checked for the presence of previously recorded archaeological sites in the
project area and vicinity. Relevant archaeological reports documenting work in
Houston County were reviewed in order to become familiar with the types of prehistoric
and historic sites found in the area. The area was investigated by Lisa G. Shaddox on
June 17, 2008. The project area was Forest Service Road 556 A-2, which is 0.52 mile
long and between three and four meters wide. The entire road was walked and
examined for evidence of cultural materials on the surface. Shovel testing began at the
north end and continued to the point where Forest Service Road 556-A2 intersects with
Forest Service Road 556 A. The road was driven from south to north and the first
shovel test was dug approximately .10 mile from the property boundary at the north
end. At this point, a large tree limb blocked access so the first test was dug at this
point, and the second test was dug at the north end of the road. The researcher then
drove from north to south and excavated the remaining six tests along the top of the
ridge at intervals of .10 and .20 miles measured by the vehicle odometer. Only one test
was excavated in sandy soil. At the north end of the road, Shovel Test 1 was dug
through 45 cm of loose sandy loam and sandy clay to a depth of 45 cm (Figure 3). The
remaining seven tests were terminated at less than 10 cm due to the presence of firm,
red clay at the surface. The tests were concentrated along the ridge with no tests
being dug on the steep slope, and the tests were dug adjacent to the road in an
attempt to test undisturbed soil. Shovel test data were noted in the field, and a shovel
test log was created from this information (Appendix I). The project was documented
through field notes and digital photography. Figure 4 depicts the location of the eight
shovel tests.

RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS
Examination of the files at TARL in Austin, Texas and the Archeological Sites
Atlas revealed no sites have been recorded in the project area, and a professional
archaeologist had not previously examined any portion of the road. The project area is
located on land owned by the Forest Service and is in the boundaries of the Davy
Crockett National Forest. The road was found to be narrow (3-4 meters wide) and
bordered by pine trees and various understory plants (Figure 5). A 100% Pedestrian
Survey and shovel testing did not identify a prehistoric site or historic site in the area
investigated. The shovel tests found that clay was at or near the surface throughout
the length of the 0.52-mile road (Figure 5). In addition, the road does not cross or run
parallel to any major streams. Therefore, this area was probably not considered a
likely setting by prehistoric groups for a camp. On the map provided by the Forest
Service, a small stream is depicted as crossing the road, but this was not observed in
the field, and no drainage appears on the topographic map Ratcliff. The road had
been scraped and pushed in order to make it passable for vehicular traffic. It is
possible that this area was visited in prehistoric times, but no evidence of prehistoric
activity was observed. No raw materials suitable for the manufacture of stone tools
were seen on the surface or in the shovel tests, and no historic artifacts were noted.
The presence of prehistoric sites along Hickory Creek to the northeast suggests that
this was a more suitable area for habitation sites and other activities. Should a site be
present in the road, it would have been disturbed by maintenance activities, and it is
not likely that any artifacts found today would be in their original context. It should be
stated here that the soils in the project area are not the moderately deep and deep
sandy soils as described in the soil survey.

RECOMMENDATIONS
No archaeological sites were found as a result of this survey, which was
conducted in accordance with the Minimum Survey Standards as outlined by the Texas
Historical Commission, Archeology Division. It is recommended that the landowner be
allowed to use this road with no additional survey by a professional archaeologist. In
the event cultural materials (prehistoric or historic) are observed by the landowner
along this road, the staff archaeologist at the Davy Crockett National Forest should be
advised in case additional archaeological survey is required.
