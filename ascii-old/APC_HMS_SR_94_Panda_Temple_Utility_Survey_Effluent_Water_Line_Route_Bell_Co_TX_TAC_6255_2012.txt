Panda Temple Power Plant Effluent Line

Abstract
Panda Temple Power, LLC (Panda), plans to construct utilities to it new power plant locale
located southeast of Temple, Texas in Bell County, including a reclaimed water pipeline. The effluent
water line will be constructed at the west end of the plant locale and will connect it to the Doshier Waste
Water Treatment Plant (WWTP). The northern and southern parts of the route are located on property
owned by the City. A single parcel along the route is privately owned by Vaughn Wendell Young. The
project is subject to the Antiquities Code of Texas (ACT) that requires the consideration of any potential
effects on cultural resources before new construction begins. The survey was performed under Antiquities
Permit Number 6255 and is not a federal undertaking subject to Section 106 of the National Historic
Preservation Act.
Antiquities Planning & Consulting (APC) performed a cultural resources survey of about 11.76
acres upland plowed fields, wooded fields, and floodplain. No new archeological or historical sites were
found. No diagnostic artifacts were seen and no artifacts were collected for analysis or curation. APC,
therefore, recommends that construction of the effluent line to the Panda Temple power plant locale
proceed.
Lastly, APC recommends that if unexpected archeological deposits are exposed during
construction, digging should stop at the discovery location and the Archeology Division of Texas
Historical Commission (THC) should be notified, by telephone at (512) 463-6100. The find should be
evaluated by archeologists in consultation with the Texas Historical Commission before digging resumes
at the location.

1.0 MANAGEMENT SUMMARY
Panda Temple Power, LLC (Panda), proposes to construct a reclaimed water pipeline to its
natural gas-fired power plant located southeast of the Temple, Texas in eastern Bell County. The utility
route will cross land owned by the City of Temple (City) and private property tracts inside a permanent
easement. The northern and southern parts of the route are located on property owned by the City. A
single parcel along the route is privately owned by Vaughn Wendell Young. The 14-inch water line 1.43
miles long will be built inside a 70-foot wide easement. Construction will be reviewed by the Texas
Commission on Environmental Quality (TCEQ) and the cultural resources survey will be permitted by the
Texas Historical Commission (THC). The project is not permitted by a federal agency and is not a
federal undertaking.
TITAN Engineering on behalf of Panda, contracted with Antiquities Planning and Consulting
(APC), to comply with the ACT and to perform a survey of the proposed effluent line route. The survey
was performed under Antiquities Permit Number 6255 following Texas Archeological Survey Standards.
APC performed a survey of a total of 11.76 acres. The results showed that no potentially eligible cultural
resources are present that could be affected by the new construction because no cultural material is
present in the proposed easement.
Based on negative findings, APC, therefore, recommends that the installation of the proposed
effluent water line project for the Panda Temple power plant locale proceed with conditions. Lastly, APC
also recommends that if unexpected archeological deposits are exposed during construction, digging
should stop at the discovery location and THC Archeology Division should be notified, by telephone at
(512) 463-6100. The find should be evaluated by archeologists, in consultation with the THC, before
digging resumes at the location.

PROJECT AREA
The power plant locale is situated in a semi-rural area of southeast of Temple, Texas. It traverses
plowed fields, crosses wooded pastureland, and a short segment overlooks the flood plain of Little Elm
Creek (Figure 1). The effluent line route connects the Doshier Waste Water Treatment Plant (WTTP) to
the Panda power plant locale (Figure 2). The proposed reclaimed water line is 1.42 miles long and will be
14-inch pipe (Figure 3).

Figure 2. Map Showing the Route of the Effluent Water Line and Property Owners.
The effluent line will exit the WTTP facility from its southwest corner in a southeasterly direction
into private property for .1 miles ant turn east, and cross under Loop 363. East of the Loop, about .5 miles
of the ROW is located on City of Temple property and parallels Loop 363. From the Loop it turns east,
still on city land, following Tower Road for about .3 miles. From Tower Road to the south, it leaves
public property and follows .3 miles of private property lines to Loraine Drive where it reenters Cityowned property and follows Lorraine Drive, west for.2 miles, to the power plant site.
At the northern end of the route, where the ROW leaves the WTTP, the setting is undeveloped
grass covered low hills overlooking the flood plain at elevation of about 600 feet above mean sea level (ft
amsl) for about 620 feet to Loop 363 (Figure 4). It then enters the uplands where it crosses low hills into
gradually sloping cultivated fields up to elevations of 632 feet amsl (Figure 5 and Figure 6). The ROW
does not cross any streams.
Huckabee et al. (1972) provide soil data for Bell County. Soil associations in the project area
consist of calcareous clays, sandy loams, and clay loams. Soil units mapped for the upland part of the
project area are in the Houston Black-Heiden-Branyon soils association made up of nearly level to
sloping, deep clayey soils over clayey material, shale, or marl.

PROJECT DESCRIPTION
The effluent water line will be installed in a 20 foot wide permanent easement adjacent to 50 foot
wide temporary construction easement for a total width of 70 feet. The area surveyed covered with of 80
to 100 feet. The surface construction Area of Potential Effect (APE) or easements where construction
activity will take place is about 12.01 acres in area. Vegetation will be cleared from the 20 foot wide
permanent easement and may alter the ground surface by pushing. In terms of depth of impact, the
subsurface construction APE is 5 to 6 feet deep based on a 14-inch pipe with a minimum 42- inch cover.
The width of the trench will be about 2 to 3 feet wide. In addition, boring will take place under roadways.
SUMMARY
During a preliminary records search, it was determined that the effluent line route has not been
examined for cultural resources by archeologists and that the proposed route was close to known historic
communities. For these reasons and to comply with the ACT, an intensive pedestrian survey was
performed by APC in March and in May of 2012 in order to determine if any significant cultural
resources are present that could be affected by the proposed activity and should be avoided. Discussions
of the survey research direction, methods, and results follow in the next three report sections.

3.0 CULTURAL RESOURCES SURVEY
RESEARCH DIRECTION
The research purpose of the cultural resources survey was to collect new data about cultural
history and prehistory and to identify any evidence of cultural resources present in the tracts proposed for
development. The objective of the survey was to identify any significant cultural resources that might be
affected by the proposed activity. The survey was conducted by two technicians in March and on
technician in May of 2012.
METHODS
Before going into the field, technicians reviewed records from the Texas Archeological Sites
Atlas before starting the survey. Historic maps were checked to see if any structures or features were
present in the study area in the past prior to going into the field. An 80 foot wide corridor east was
surveyed in May along the north half of the proposed route. For the southern section surveyed in March, a
100 foot wide study corridor was established along the proposed centerline with 50 feet wide on either
side. Figure 4 shows the areas surveyed.

Cultural Resources Survey

Panda Temple Power Plant Effluent Line

APC performed the intensive survey in accordance with Texas Archeological Survey Standards
with modifications. Systematic transects 20 meters apart were walked by two technicians. Shovel testing
was not performed due to high surface visibility of 40 per cent in pasture and up to 100 per cent in
unplanted fields.
Backhoe trench testing was not performed along the ROW to examine the subsurface APE of 5 to
6 feet below the surface due to the upland setting without streams, due to cultivation, and due to the
absence of cultural material on the ground surface. No stream terraces or flood plains rises with alluvial
soils are present with the potential to contain deeply buried deposits. Instead, calcareous Houston Black
Clay soils and recently deposited silty clays were encountered.
All findings are summarized in this short report of negative findings which follows Council of
Texas Archeologists (CTA) guidelines for short reports of negative findings. Project records will be
stored at APC. A copy of the report a will be stored at the Texas Archeological Research Laboratory
(TARL), the University of Texas at Austin. APC will provide the THC with tagged .pdf versions of the
report with and without location maps and a completed Texas Abstract Form. As required by permit
conditions, additional copies will be distributed to the Texas State Library and Archives and other
research facilities around the state.

4.0 SURVEY RESULTS
INTRODUCTION
The results of the cultural resources survey of the Panda Temple power plant effluent water line
were negative. No new archeological sites were found. No historic buildings were observed inside or
adjacent to the building. No diagnostic artifacts were present and no artifacts were collected. Reviews of
historic maps show that the locale where the line is planned did not contain historic roads and/or
structures. Twentieth century aerial photographs do not show any structures in the locale.
FINDINGS
The proposed easement for the effluent water line is a Low Probability Area for the presence of
cultural resources. The surface visibility ranged from about 40 per cent in pasture land and flood plain
tract to 100 percent in plowed fields and revealed an absence of archeological or historical material.
Modern cultural material was seen on the surface in the eastern limits of the proposed water line easement
along Loop 363. The material is mid twentieth century rubbish fragments and apparently is eroding out of
the fill used to construct Loop 363. Due to the modern age of less than one hundred years old, the material
is judged not to be archeological in nature.
DISCUSSION
The Panda Temple power plant utility survey yielded negative new archeological data about the
rural area inspected southeast of Temple, Texas in eastern Bell County in the Little Elm Creek water
shed. In terms of prehistoric sites, these findings are likely due to the fact that the location is primarily an
upland one and away from major streams. In terms of historic settlement, transportation routes came late
to the local and no rural farms were established until the twentieth century. Lastly, the findings also
showed that construction of the effluent water line to the Panda Temple power plant locale will not affect
any significant cultural resources eligible for listing in the NRHP and or as SALs, because no cultural
resources are present.

5.0 CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS
CONCLUSIONS
From a research perspective, no new knowledge about the region’s prehistory and/or late
nineteenth and early twentieth century settlement resulted from the survey. In terms of new construction,
the absence of any cultural materials in the effluent/water line easement eliminates any potential impacts
to significant historic or archeological properties. The results confirm that the installation of the effluent
water line will not affect any cultural resources eligible for the NRHP or SAL listing. Therefore,
construction of the Panda Temple power plant utility project can proceed without realignment or
additional cultural resources work.
RECOMMENDATIONS
APC recommends that construction of the Panda Temple power plant effluent water line project
proceed, as planned. Lastly, APC recommends that if unexpected archeological deposits are exposed
during construction, digging should stop at the discovery location and the Archeology Division of the
THC should be notified, by telephone at (512) 463-6100. The find should be evaluated by archeologists in
consultation with the THC before digging resumes at the location.
