Microtine Remains From the Coleto Creek Basin
Kenneth M. Brown
Introduction
This report is a partial inventory of known microtine (Microtus or Pitymys) remains from
the Coleto Creek drainage in Goliad County and De Witt County. It is not a complete
listing, because additional specimens almost certainly remain in the large quantities of
unpicked matrix residue from both the upper and lower deposits at Berger Bluff. Most
specimens are the distinctive convoluted microtine molars. I have located and examined
most of these myself, except for the Smith Creek Bridge specimen. For definition of
characters “b” and “c,” see Zakrzewski (1985:Fig. 2). The observations reported here
were made many years ago before the review by Semken and Wallace (2002) was
published, so I was not able to use their criteria for assessing species ID. A superscript
(M1) denotes a maxillary tooth; a subscript (M1) denotes a mandibular tooth.
Description of Specimens
Smith Creek Bridge site (41 DW 270)
Feature 11 (level 9, Lot 591), 1/16” mesh sample, a single M3 is present (Froelich
2002:Table 95).
41 GD 21 (no site name)
Shovel test 9 (0-80 cm; Fox, Black and James 1979:Table 3). This specimen (identified in
the report as Microtus ochrogaster) is listed in Table 3 under 41 GD 21A, although the
map clearly shows that Shovel Test 9 is located in 41 GD 21, agreeing with the
provenience tag that accompanies the specimen. It is a fragmentary, edentulous right
mandible, accompanied by a loose right M1 and right M2, all in the same vial. These are
presumed to have fallen out after recovery (in Fig. 1, A, they have been replaced in the
mandible for photography). The body of the mandible is intact, but is broken through the
alveolus for the M3 and lacks the ascending ramus. The surviving part is about 14.3 mm
long. The right M1 is 3.02 mm long and 1.16 mm wide; character “b” measures 0.12 mm;
character “c” measures 0.19 mm (Fig. 1, B). In morphological terms the occlusal view is
intermediate between pine vole and prairie vole specimens illustrated by Repenning
(1983:Figs. 2, 3). The enamel layer is of uniform thickness.

Berger Bluff (41 GD 30A), Upper Deposits
N97 E99, Level 2 (15-30 cm), Stratum 5. Flynn (1983:Table 23) lists this as an
edentulous left mandible, but the incisor is actually present and retains the orange
pigmentation characteristic of live specimens. The posterior third of the mandible is
broken off, including the coronoid process, mandibular condyle, and angular process.
Part of the M3 socket is broken away, so the alveolar toothrow length cannot be measured
accurately, but it is roughly 5.94 mm long. The M1 socket is approximately 2.84 mm long

and 1.26 mm wide. Other than this breakage, the specimen is uncorroded and appears
relatively fresh and somewhat shiny (Brown 2006:Fig. 10.79, A). This specimen was also
examined by Richard Hulbert.
N98 E97, Level 3 (30-45 cm), Stratum 5. This specimen, identified on the provenience
tag as “Microtus pinetorum,” is also listed by Flynn (1983:Table 23) as edentulous. It
consists of a left mandible very similar to the one described immediately above, and also
has the incisor but none of the molars (Brown 2006:Fig. 10.79, B). The posterior third is
missing, with only the bases of the angular and coronoid processes present. Orange
tinting of the incisor is very faint. Like the other specimen, part of the alveolus for the M3
is broken away, but the alveolar toothrow length can be estimated at 5.81 mm. The M1
socket is 2.79 mm long and 1.40 mm wide.
N98 E97, Level 3 (30-45 cm), Stratum 5. Flynn (1983:Table 23) lists this as pine vole.
This specimen is the anterior part of a skull, broken across the midpoints of the orbits; the
anterior halves of the zygomatic arches are present (Brown 2006:Fig. 10.78). Both
maxillary incisors (with bright orange pigmentation) are present, but the rest of the
dentition is missing. This type of occipital damage is often characteristic of owl
predation. The maxilla is broken approximately at the junction between the alveoli for the
M2 and M3, hence no measurement of the maxillary toothrow length is possible. The
alveolus for the right M1 is about 2.33 mm long and 1.40 mm wide, for the left also 2.33
mm long and 1.40 mm wide. This specimen was also examined by Hulbert.
Berger Bluff (41 GD 30A), Bench Deposits
N109 E96 bulk matrix, various levels
93.08-93.00 m, bag 1 of 3: 1 molar
93.08-93.00 m, bag 3 of 3: 1 molar
92.55-92.50 m, left M1 with dentine conspicuously excavated and salient angles of loops
(posterior loop, T1-3, T5, T7, and part of anterior cap; see Zakrzewski 1985) are eroded
away. This kind of damage is characteristic of gastric etching attributed to hawks
(Mayhew 1977:30) and does not appear on any of the other microtine teeth listed here.
Estimated total length of the tooth is about 3.0 mm, but the surviving part of the occlusal
surface is only about 2.7 mm long; maximum width is 1.2 mm. Character “b” is 0.18
mm; character “c” is 0.22 mm. Mostly because of postmortem damage, this specimen
cannot be identified to species level.
92.35-92.30 m, fractured and heavily digested molar, perhaps part of the middle section
of first molar? Fragment is about 1.7 mm long and 1.1 mm wide; surviving enamel width
is considerably less than 0.1 mm.

Other lots from the bench deposits
Microtine remains from the bench deposits are described in Chapter 10 in Brown (2006).
Below are some additional descriptive details about a few (but not all) of the specimens
listed there.
Unit 2, Feature 5, Lot B-149. Left edentulous anterior mandible consisting of two joining
fragments representing about 40% of the original element; surviving length is about 9
mm. In the same gelcap are a left M1 and a left M2 which evidently were embedded in the
mandible fragment (Brown 2006:Fig. 10.76). Presumably these became separated during
lab handling. The M1 is 3.12 mm long and 1.21 mm wide; character “b” measures 0.17
mm and character “c” measures 0.19 mm. This specimen looks nearly identical to the
first molar from 41 GD 21 described above. It is of similar size and also has enamel of
uniform thickness, but shows more wear than any of the other teeth examined and
presumably comes from a relatively old individual.
N113 E98 (92.443-92.400 m), hearth deposit, Lot B-106. Right M2, a single loose tooth
with lime encrustations, evidently not recently separated from the maxilla.
N113 E98 (92.443-92.400 m), hearth deposit, Lot B-106. Unidentified molar fragment. A
small fragment with the characteristic prismatic shape of ever-growing microtine teeth,
having three loops of the occlusal surface present. Breakage may have occurred during
excavation or lab processing.
