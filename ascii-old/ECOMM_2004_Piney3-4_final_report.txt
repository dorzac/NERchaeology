13. ABSTRACT (Maximum 200 words)
A cultural resource inventory was conducted on 291 acres, in Cass, Marion, and Upshur Counties in East Texas. The
project area includes 146 acres in three inventory parcels at Lake O’ the Pines and 145 acres in a single parcel at Lake
Wright Patman. Timber harvesting has been proposed within the four parcels. Archeological fieldwork was conducted
between November 20, 2003 and December 4, 2003 and consisted of a 100% pedestrian survey accompanied by 426
manually excavated shovel tests.
The inventory documented six archeological sites, including one previously recorded site and five newly discovered sites.
One site (41CS33) has been severely degraded and no longer retains any research potential; it is recommended as not
eligible for inclusion on the National Register of Historic Places (NRHP) and no further work is warranted. Using limited
inventory-level tactics, the integrity and data content of the remaining five sites (41CS286, 41CS287, 41MR262, 41UR294,
41UR295) could not be clearly determined and it is unknown if they may be eligible for inclusion on the NRHP. Because of
this uncertainty, these five sites should be treated as if they were eligible and should be protected and avoided. If the
proposed undertaking cannot avoid adverse impacts to any of the sites, they should be investigated in more detail to
clearly assess their integrity and data potential.

ABSTRACT
This report documents the substantive findings and management recommendations of a cultural
resource inventory conducted on four separate tracts of land, totaling 291 acres, in Cass, Marion,
and Upshur Counties in East Texas. The project area includes 146 acres in three inventory
parcels at Lake O’ the Pines and 145 acres in one parcel at Lake Wright Patman. Work was
conducted at the request of the Piney Woods Project Office of the United States Army Corps of
Engineers, Fort Worth District (USACE). The USACE has proposed timber harvesting within
the parcels and, in compliance with Section 106 of the National Historic Preservation Act, the
inventory was undertaken to ensure that any cultural resource sites located on the parcels would
be considered in planning and conducting the undertaking.
Archaeological fieldwork was conducted between November 20, 2003 and December 4, 2003.
Fieldwork included a 100% pedestrian inventory accompanied by intensive and systematic
shovel testing. Four hundred and twenty-six shovel tests were manually excavated. Thirty-one
tests were positive (7.3%) including 27 positive tests on sites and four isolated positive tests.
Recovered artifacts included prehistoric flakes, ceramic sherds, and historic ceramics, metal, and
glass. All subsurface artifacts were recovered and will be curated at the Texas Archeological
Research Laboratory (TARL).
Six archaeological sites were documented, including one previously recorded site and five newly
discovered sites. One site (41CS33) has been severely degraded and no longer retains any
research potential; it is recommended as not eligible for inclusion on the National Register of
Historic Places (NRHP) and no further work is warranted. Using limited inventory-level tactics,
the integrity and data content of the remaining five sites (41CS286, 41CS287, 41MR262,
41UR294, 41UR295) could not be clearly determined and it is unknown if they may be eligible
for inclusion on the NRHP. Because of this uncertainty, these five sites should be treated as if
they were eligible and should be protected and avoided. If the proposed undertaking cannot
avoid adverse impacts to any of the sites, they should be further investigated in more detail to
clearly assess integrity and data potential.

1.0 PROJECT DESCRIPTION
1.1 THE UNDERTAKING
The United States Army Corps of Engineers, Fort Worth District (USACE) is responsible for
managing certain federally-owned lands in East Texas in association with lakes, reservoirs and
navigable waterways. These management responsibilities include 9,251 acres at Lake O’ the
Pines and 45,063 acres at Lake Wright Patman (acreages are outside conservation pools). Much
of this acreage is forested by mature pine and pine-hardwood stands. In conjunction with the
existing management plans for the several reservoirs and in accordance with accepted
silviculture methodologies, the USACE has planned certain management areas for selective
timber thinning. Commercial thinning removes marketable trees in uneven-aged stands (not
clear-cut) through single tree selection. Removal of crop trees often disturbs the ground surface
but extensive subsurface disturbance is not common.
While planning and conducting undertakings that have the potential to affect historic properties,
the USACE must take such resources into account, and in compliance with Section 106 of the
National Historic Preservation Act (NHPA) of 1966 as amended through 1992 (P.L. 89-665 et
seq.), the inventory was authorized by the USACE to identify any archaeological sites, buildings,
structures, or other resources that may be eligible for inclusion on the National Register of
Historic Places (NRHP). All inventories were conducted on lands owned by the Federal
Government and managed by the USACE.
1.2 LOCATION
The project area, totaling 291 acres (Table 1-1), is comprised of four separate parcels located at
Lake O’ the Pines in Upshur and Marion counties, and at Lake Wright Patman in Cass County,
Texas (Figure 1-1).

1.2.1 Lake O’ the Pines
Lake O’ the Pines is located on Big Cypress Creek 14 km west of Jefferson and approximately
40 km northeast of Longview in Marion, Harrison, Morris, Upshur, and Camp Counties. The
earthen dam was constructed between 1955 and 1959 and impounds a reservoir with 18,700
surface acres. The lake is used for flood control, recreation, and water and wildlife conservation
(Breeding 2002a). Three tracts totaling 146 acres are currently planned for timber thinning.

The Highway 259 Area is located in
Upshur County at the extreme
northwestern (upstream) point of
Lake O’ the Pines, about 4 km south
of the community of Lonestar and
about 10 km north of Ore City
(Figure 1-2). Totaling 22 acres, this
parcel is situated immediately east of
a bend of Highway 259 and west of
Cypress Creek. The tract measures
about 350 m east to west by about
400 m north to south. It is located on
the Ore City USGS 7.5’ topographic
quadrangle. Elevation is about 235 ft
above mean sea level (AMSL).

Figure 1-2 Inventory Areas at Lake O’ the
Pi

The Cedar Springs North Area is in Upshur County about 3.5 km northeast of Ore City (see
Figure 1-2). This parcel is located about 200 m west of the Lake O’ the Pines shoreline at an
elevation of about 240 ft AMSL. The trapezoidal-shaped tract measures about 500 m by about
280 m and totals about 21 acres. It is plotted on the Ore City USGS 7.5’ topographic
quadrangle.
The Cedar Springs South Area is in Upshur and Marion Counties (see Figure 1-2). This area
follows the west shoreline of Lake O’ the Pines for a length of about 2.5 km and has maximum
dimensions of about 1.3 km by about 0.8 km. The southern portion of this inventory area is a
low ridge line which projects out into Lake O’ the Pines as a small peninsula. The area totals
103 acres and is plotted on the Ore City USGS 7.5’ topographic quadrangle. Elevation ranges
from the shoreline to about 254 ft AMSL.
1.2.2 Lake Wright Patman
Lake Wright Patman is on the Sulphur River 18 km southwest of Texarkana in Bowie and Cass
Counties. The far upstream portions of the reservoir extend into Morris, Titus, and Red River
Counties.
Initially known as Texarkana
Reservoir, the lake was renamed in the late
1970s in honor of the East Texas congressman
(Breeding 2002b). The dam was constructed
between 1948 and 1957 and impounds an area
of 20,300 acres. Conservation pool elevation
is 220 ft AMSL. One parcel is currently
planned for timber thinning.
The Armstrong Landing East Area is in
Cass County on the south shore of Lake
Wright Patman, immediately west of
Armstrong Creek (Figure 1-3). It is located

about 8 km northeast of Douglassville. Totaling 145 acres, this parcel measures about 1.7 km
north to south by about 500 m east to west. It is located on the Douglassville USGS 7.5’
topographic quadrangle. The elevation ranges from lake level at about 225 ft to about 300 ft
AMSL.
1.3 NATURAL ENVIRONMENT
The project is located in the Piney Woods region of East Texas. Forested areas in the region
included secondary growth and mature pine and pine-hardwood stands. Pine stands observed
during the field inventory were
typically comprised of loblolly
(Pinus taeda), shortleaf (Pinus
echinata), and longleaf (Pinus
palustris) pines. Hardwood trees
were predominantly various oaks,
including southern red oak
(Quercus falcate) and white oak
(Quercus alba), and the American
sycamore (Platanus occidentalis).
Figures 1-4 and 1-5 illustrate
typical landscape views for the
project.
Wildlife common to the area
included whitetail deer, red fox,

otters, and mink. Lake habitats
support a variety of turtles, frogs and snakes, as well as largemouth bass, flathead catfish,
channel catfish, white and black crappie, white bass, and bluegill and other sunfish. Bird species
include the endangered redcockaded woodpecker, as well as
bald eagles, osprey, bobwhite,
mourning dove, white pelicans,
common loons, herons, and
egrets.

2.0 PREVIOUS RESEARCH
2.1 PREVIOUSLY RECORDED SITES
Of the four inventory areas, only the Armstrong Landing East parcel has any record of previous
archaeological investigations. In 1970, a 100 m (328 ft) wide shoreline portion of this parcel,
totaling about 48 acres (19.4 ha), was inventoried by the New Orleans District of the USACE
(Briggs and Malone 1970). This inventory included the entire shoreline of the lake, which was
named Lake Texarkana at that time. The portion of that survey that is within the current parcel
contained two sites, 41CS33 (originally recorded in 1964) and 41CS76 (Table 2-1). These two
sites are described in more detail in Section 4.0.
None of the other current inventory areas had been previously surveyed and none contained
previously recorded sites. However, previous inventories in the general vicinity of the current
parcels have recorded sites within 1 mile (1.6 km), including four sites within 1 mile (1.6 km) of
the Highway 259 parcel, 17 sites within 1 mile of the Cedar Springs North area, seven sites
within 1 mile of the Cedar Springs South area, and nine sites within 1 mile of the Armstrong
Landing East area (Table 2-1). These had been recorded by various persons and organizations as
long ago as 1957 and the existing site information is incomplete and non-comparable for many
of the sites. Most of the sites contained ceramics; a few aceramic sites were presumed to date to
the Archaic period. About a third of the sites contain a mound or mounds and at least two were
recorded as containing burials.

2.2 PREHISTORIC CULTURAL FRAMEWORK
Humans have lived in the East Texas region for at least 11,000 years. The currently accepted
framework of culture history has been outlined by Kenmotsu and Perttula (1993) in a planning
document for East Texas. This framework includes Paleo-Indian populations (prior to 7000
B.C.), and Archaic foraging cultures (ca. 7000-100 B.C.), though the Caddoan horticultural
adaptations (A.D. 900-1700). These time periods are based on changes in environment,
technology, and/or population requiring cultural adaptations to meet varying circumstances.
The prehistory of East Texas has been investigated by many archaeological investigations. For
cultural-historical details of the prehistoric period, the reader is referred to Kenmotsu and

Perttula (1993) and Perttula (1993; 1995). Many small investigations have been conducted by
the Texas Department of Transportation (TxDOT), on rural developments by the Federal
Highway Administration (FHWA), and various projects for utilities and mineral interests. Of
these small projects, the inventories crossing lowland areas have generally recorded higher site
densities than the upland inventories. Larger investigations have been focused on reservoirs
(Perttula et al. 1998) and on the Big Thicket National Preserve (Shafer et al. 1975; Brown et al.
1999). Large investigations in the region generally show that both prehistoric and historic sites
were found adjacent to the floodplains on first terraces or along the toe slopes of higher ridges.
In general, areas around stream confluences and on small rises within floodplains had a good to
excellent chance of containing prehistoric cultural resources while historic resources can be in
more diverse conditions, including areas away from water.
2.3 HISTORIC PERIOD
The original inhabitants of East Texas are believed to have been first contacted by Europeans
between 1528 and 1533 by the Spanish explorer, Cabeza de Vaca. This foray may have
encountered Caddoan people somewhere between Nacogdoches, Texas and Nachitoches,
Louisiana. It was followed by the explorer Moscoso, whose report of crossing the Angelina
River mentions several distinct Caddoan groups including the Ayish, Nondacoa, Nasoni,
Nacacahoz, and Naquisca. The French Explorer La Salle in 1685 also reported Hasinai Caddo
near Nacogdoches and in 1690 the Spanish began establishing a series of missions in the area,
including two at Nacogdoches by 1716. The Spaniards reported that the local people actively
cultivated fields of maize, which they supplemented with gardens of beans, squash, and other
vegetables, as well as hunting and fishing. Trotlining was a common fishing technique. Surplus
maize was often traded with neighboring people.
The Historic Period (1700-present) describes the history behind the current cultural setting of the
area and also marks a transition from the native populations to the European immigrants’
establishment of farms, towns, and counties. As the indigenous groups were exposed to
Europeans, trade items such as glass beads, metal points, buttons, and gun parts made their way
into the archaeological record. Unfortunately, contact with the Europeans also brought new
diseases, which severely reduced the populations of the Caddoan villages. The descendants of
these people now reside primarily in Texas Oklahoma and Louisiana.
2.3.1 Area of Lake O’ the Pines
Much of the area around Big Cypress Creek and what would become Lake O’ the Pines
remained uninhabited for most of the eighteenth century. The first Anglo-American settlements
were formed in the 1840s, and the town of Jefferson was founded at that time. The settlers were
primarily from Tennessee and Alabama; the area of east Upshur County and Marion County
were inhabited by those from Alabama. They set up a way of life similar to what they had at
home, which included large cotton plantations using slave labor (Atkins 2002; Kirby 2002).
Jefferson quickly became a booming river port town, in fact the largest inland port in Texas.
North Texas agricultural produce was shipped to Shreveport and New Orleans, and as a result of
this connection with the Mississippi River system and factories to the east, new amenities such as

Page 6

Cultural Resource Inventory of 291 Acres at Lake O’ the Pines and Lake Wright Patman, Texas

refrigeration, soda water, artificial gas for lighting, and ice production made their first
appearance as early as the 1870s (Atkins 2002). The white population supported the secession
movement and the Confederacy in the Civil War, and ordnance, rifles, and tinned food were
manufactured for the Confederate forces. Military occupation followed the Civil War, although
white suppression of the black majority continued to persist. Jefferson declined significantly in
1873 when the destruction of the “raft” – a massive log jam - on the Red River above Shreveport
reduced the water levels of Big Cypress Creek, as well as the establishment of rail transportation
in other parts of the state (Long 2002a).
Rich iron ore deposits in eastern Upshur County were mined on and off since the 1860s, but the
town of Ore City was not founded until 1911, anticipating the arrival of the Port Bolivar Iron Ore
Railroad. This railroad was chartered in December, 1910 to connect Longview with an area rich
in iron ore near Hughes Springs, a distance of about 50 miles. Construction began in 1912, but
World War I halted completion of the line and it was abandoned in 1927 (Young 2002). Ore
City operated as a mining and lumbering center, and managed to survive after these major
industries became non-operational (Long 2002b). Oil was discovered in the 1910s and gave a
boost to the manufacturing sector. The Depression dealt the area a hard blow, especially the
agricultural economy, but rising oil prices and federal assistance helped the area recover more
quickly than other areas of Texas. The economy and population of the area declined slightly
over the next 30 years, but the area moved more toward a tourist economy with the development
of urban heritage sites in Jefferson, obtaining NRHP status in 1971, as well as water recreation
from Caddo Lake State Park and Lake O’ the Pines, which were developed in the 1930s and
1950s, respectively.
2.3.2 Area of Lake Wright Patman
The first likely European expedition into the area around Lake Wright Patman was led by Luis
de Moscoso Alvarado in 1542. Moscoso was a member of the Hernando de Soto expedition into
the southeastern U.S. and took over after he died in 1539. Looking for an overland route back to
New Spain, he crossed into the territory that became Bowie County and used existing trails
established by the Caddo to move further into the interior of Texas before turning around and
traveling back to the coast (Bruseth and Kenmotsu 1993). French visitors to the area included
Henri Jountel, who was part of the LaSalle expedition, and Henri de Tonti, who went to the area
to look for survivors from Fort St. Louis (Harper 2002b). Permanent European presence began
in 1719, when Le Poste des Cadodaquious was established by the French at a location just to the
northwest of Texarkana. Although a fort in name, the establishment served more as a trading
station and supply base for further expeditions. The fort was abandoned a few years after the
Louisiana cession to Spain in 1762. The fort was reestablished in 1770 by the Spanish, under the
name San Luiz de los Cadodachos, but the Nasoni tribes with whom they were trying to foster a
relationship left the area soon after (Britton 2002). Finally, the Americans explored the area in
1806 when the Red River Expedition launched by Thomas Jefferson traveled up the Red River to
Spanish Bluff, where they were forced to turn back by Spanish soldiers.
Immigration and settlement of the areas that would become Bowie and Cass Counties began in
the 1820s and 1830s. Both Anglo-Americans and members of the Shawnee, Delaware, and
Kickapoo Indians settled there, but the Native American tribes moved on within ten years. By

1846, the establishment of separate counties had been made and county lines had been resolved.
The white settlers were primarily from the South and set up slave-operated cotton plantations as
well as raising corn, hogs, and some cattle. Just before the Civil War, the slave population
outnumbered the white population in Bowie County, and numbered just under half in Cass
County (Harper 2002a; Harper 2002b). As was expected, the white population strongly
supported the secession movement and the Confederate war effort. Although no battle took
place in the area, federal troops occupied Bowie County in 1867 on behalf of the Freedmen’s
Bureau to assist black residents in obtaining their legal and political equality. This enflamed
white residents, who had lost much of their capital once the slaves were freed, and secretly
supported anti-black movements such as Cullen Baker’s gang and the Ku Klux Klan.
By the 1870s, the Texas and Pacific Railway was being built and several towns sprouted up in
the area. Texarkana was founded in 1873, at the site of an abandoned Caddo village, where two
major railroads would soon meet (Chandler and Howe 1939). It immediately became the largest
trading and manufacturing center in the area. Maud was formed in 1870. Atlanta was founded
in 1871, and it, along with Douglassville, was an economic center for the surrounding rural
community (Hazlewood 2002; Harper 2002c).
The entire area remained primarily rural with an agricultural economy, but small manufacturing
also employed some of the local population. The Depression had a devastating effect on the
area, but World War II brought the establishment of the Red River Army Depot and the Lone
Star Army Ammunition Plant, which increasingly employed many of the local residents from
that point forward (Harper 2002a). Changes in the economic market drew many people away
from farming and into manufacturing and trade. However, populations grew slowly, if at all, and
the inhabitants remained relatively poor. Lake Wright Patman was completed in 1957 and
provided recreation facilities as well as flood control measures.

3.0 FIELD METHODS
The archaeological field inventory was conducted from November 20 through November 26,
2003 and was completed on December 3 and 4, 2003. Twenty person-days were spent in the
field and the Principal Investigator was in the field for seven of the nine field days. Methods and
density of shovel testing complied with, or exceeded, the minimum requirements for field tactics
stipulated by the USACE (2002:10-44).
3.1 SAMPLE STRATIFICATION
Each of the three survey parcels at Lake O’ the Pines had been previously stratified by the
USACE, in consultation with the Texas State Historic Preservation Officer (SHPO), into areas of
high and low probability for containing prehistoric sites. The stratification scheme was intuitive
and was based primarily on differences of elevation and landform; higher elevation landforms
and areas near natural water courses were generally designated as high probability areas. The
work plan developed by the USACE called for the high probability areas to be tested using a rate
of coverage greater than or equal to three shovel tests per acre (7.4 tests per hectare) while the
low probability areas were to be tested using a rate of coverage greater than or equal to one
shovel tests per three acres (0.7 tests per hectare). In contrast, the survey parcel at Lake Wright
Patman was not stratified into zones of high or low probability and the work plan for this area
called for an intermediate rate of survey coverage greater than or equal to one shovel test per
acre (2.5 tests per hectare). For all three probability zones, transect intervals were to be
approximately 30 m.
The stratification scheme identified a total of 56 acres as high probability, including 11 acres at
Highway 259, 6 acres at Cedar Springs North, and 39 acres at Cedar Springs South (Table 3-1).
A total of 90 acres was identified as low probability, including 11 acres at Highway 259, 15
acres at Cedar Springs North, and 64 acres at Cedar Springs South. All 145 acres at Armstrong
Landing East parcel were classified as intermediate.
Applying the USACE minimum requirement for shovel test density, a total of 344 shovel tests
were required, including 37 at Highway 259, 23 at Cedar Springs North, 139 at Cedar Springs
south, and 145 at Armstrong Landing East (Table 3-2). For all parcels, the minimum shovel
testing density was achieved or exceeded. Net density was 1.7 tests per acre at Highway 259, 1.1
tests per acre at Cedar Springs North, 1.6 tests per acre at Cedar Springs South, and 1.4 tests per
acre at Armstrong Landing East. Overall testing density for the project was 1.5 tests per acre
(Table 3-3). This is equivalent to one test per 0.28 hectare or one test per 53 by 53 m grid
square.
3.2 SURVEY TACTICS
For each parcel, a logistical plan was prepared in advance with transect lines drawn at 30 m
intervals on topographic maps. In general, separate transects were used for the high and low
probability areas. Each field archaeologist was given a copy of the topographic map and was
assigned a transect line. The location of each shovel test was marked by the field archaeologist
on the field map. Transect lines were designated with an alpha prefix and individual shovel tests

along each transect line were numbered, so that shovel test G-5 identified the fifth test along the
seventh transect (Transect G). In general, each crew member followed his/her own transect.
Occasionally, for logistical reasons, two crew members doubled up with one person digging the
shovel tests and another screening and recording the field forms. Where possible, tests were
selectively placed on landforms shown by previous research to be preferred site locations, such
as ridge lines, knolls, and promontories. In rare cases, shovel tests could not be dug due to
standing water, erosion, or steep slopes, and these locations were individually recorded on the
shovel testing log.
All shovel tests were 30 to 35 cm in diameter. All tests were dug to the bottom of the Holocene
deposits as indicated by clay, or to 80 cm below ground surface if no clay was present. Tests
were individually recorded with regard to depth, soil type and color, and cultural material
present. Tests were dug in natural stratigraphic levels not exceeding 20 cm in thickness and all
excavated material was screened through ¼-inch (6.4 mm) stainless steel mesh.

Cultural Resource Inventory of 291 Acres at Lake O’ the Pines and Lake Wright Patman, Texas

All cultural material was collected with the exception of recent objects such as bottle glass
shards, nails, and aluminum pop-tabs. These were assumed to indicate recent disturbance and
were not collected. In the Cedar Springs South inventory parcel, several of the initial shovel
tests in widely scattered areas contained occasional glass shards and nails and these were not
collected. Later, it was realized that a very large historic site (41MR262) was present and these
items were then collected from subsequent shovel tests. All shovel tests were backfilled.
Each positive shovel test was further investigated by excavating additional shovel tests in the
immediate vicinity at 10 to 15 m distances up to six tests in an area 25 to 30 m diameter. If more
than one of these tests were positive or if more than two artifacts were found in any single test,
then the location was designated as a site. Otherwise, the positive test was designated as an
isolated occurrence. The coordinates of isolates were plotted and the artifacts were collected, but
these were not further recorded. The recorded locations of previously recorded sites were
similarly investigated using multiple shovel tests. On each site a permanent site datum was
established using a 12-inch iron re-bar fixed with an aluminum survey cap. Caps were stamped
with “ECOM 2003” and with a temporary site number. Site boundaries were delineated by
excavating multiple shovel tests in the area to identify zones of zero or low artifact presence.
Based on the distribution of negative shovel tests, site boundaries were prominently marked with
pink-glo flagging tape. Sites were photographed, sketch mapped and recorded using State of
Texas site forms. All excavated artifacts were recovered and were processed and analyzed by
the authors in Ecological Communications Corporation’s (EComm’s) Austin laboratory. All
artifacts, notes and records will be curated at the Texas Archeological Research Laboratory
(TARL), at the University of Texas, Austin, upon completion of analysis.

4.0 RESULTS
4.1 LAKE O’ THE PINES
The three parcels at Lake O’ the Pines totaled 146 acres and were 100% inventoried using 230
shovel tests. Eighteen of these tests were positive (8%). Three sites and one isolated occurrence
were present.
4.1.1 Highway 259
No cultural resource sites were present in the Highway 259 area. This 22-acre parcel had been
previously stratified into one low-probability area of about 11 acres, a primary high-probability
area of about 10 acres, and one narrow, linear high-probability area (an access road) of about one
acre. The small high-probability area was investigated with five shovel tests, the larger area
received 28 tests, and the 11-acre low-probability area received four tests, for a total of 37 shovel
tests. Net testing coverage was 1.7 tests per acre. All 37 tests were negative and no cultural
resource sites or isolated occurrences are present in this inventory area. The locations of shovel
tests are plotted in Appendix A.
The typical soil profile in the Highway 259 area shows
massive sand to at least 80 cm. Sand color ranges from
brown (7.5YR 5/4) to light brownish-gray (10YR 6/2).
Thirty-three of the 37 tests (89%) were excavated to 80 cm
and in only four tests was clay encountered above 80 cm
and the average depth of all shovel tests was 75 cm below
the surface (Table 4-1).

One cultural resource site was present in the Cedar Springs North area. This 21-acre parcel had
been previously stratified into a single low-probability area of about 15 acres and three highprobability areas ranging from about one to four acres each and totaling six acres. The three
high-probability areas received 18 shovel tests and the 15 acre low-probability area received six
tests for a total of 24 shovel tests. Overall testing density was 1.1 tests per acre. Two of the 24
tests were positive (8%), defining site 41UR294. The locations of shovel tests are plotted in
Appendix A.
Soils in the Cedar Springs North area were similarly deep.
The typical profile consisted of massive strong brown
(7.5YR 5/6) to light yellowish brown (10YR 6/4) sand to
at least 80 cm. Nineteen of the 24 tests (79%) were
excavated to 80 cm and in only five tests was clay
encountered above 80 cm (Table 4-2). The average depth
of all shovel tests was 69 cm below the surface.

Site 41UR294
Site 41UR294 is a newly discovered site, located in one of the high probability areas. It is
evidenced by a low (50 cm) mound feature measuring about 10 m in diameter and would
certainly have been recognized and tested even if it had been in a low-probability area (Figure 41). In fact, the field archaeologist veered off the established transect line in this area to dig a
shovel test into the mound feature.
Six shovel tests were excavated to define this site. All tests were dug to 80 cm without
encountering clay. One test placed on top of the mound recovered seven prehistoric ceramics
from 10 to 70 cm and a second test placed off the mound by about 10 m recovered a single
ceramic sherd at 50 cm (Table 4-3). Four other shovel tests placed in the immediate vicinity
were all negative. On the basis of
the mound feature and the
positive tests, the site size is
estimated to be about 15 to 20 m
in diameter (Figure 4-2).
Seven of the eight sherds are grog
tempered, ranging from 6 to 9
mm in thickness and the eighth
sherd is bone and grog tempered
and measures 7.5 mm in
thickness (Appendix C, Table C1). Three of the sherds are
decorated. The first incised sherd
is a body sherd with three parallel
lines 10 mm apart and 2 mm
wide each in a diagonal pattern
similar to the Maydelle Incised or

Pease Brushed-Incised (Suhm
and Jelks 1962) and likely dating to A.D. 1200-1680 (Appendix C). The incised or punctated
sherd is a rim similar to the Canton Incised (Suhm and Jelks 1962; Bruseth and Perttula 1981)
and dating to A.D. 1000-1400 (Appendix C). It has an element of diagonal parallel incised lines
and an element of punctations all adjacent to a standing rim. The engraved sherd has one slightly
curved line. Together, these sherds suggest a date for the site between A.D. 1200 and A.D. 1400.

4.1.3 Cedar Springs South
Two cultural resource sites and one isolated occurrence were present in the Cedar Springs South
area. This area totaled 103 acres and had been previously stratified into a complex pattern of
eight separate high-probability areas ranging from about two acres to 12 acres each and totaling
39 acres.
A large low probability area encompassed about 61 acres and a much smaller one was about 3
acres for a total of about 64 acres. The eight high-probability areas received 138 shovel tests for
a density of 3.5 tests per acre and the low-probability areas received 31 tests for a total of 0.5
tests per acre. Over all, the inventory parcel received 169 shovel tests and net testing density
was 1.6 tests per acre. Sixteen of the 169 tests (9%) were positive, and were associated with two
cultural resource sites and one isolate. The locations of shovel tests are plotted in Appendix A.

Site 41UR295
This newly discovered site is situated on the shore of Lake O’ the Pines near the northern edge of
the inventory area. The site is located within, but near the edge, of a low-probability sampling
area. The site is evidenced by a very low relief (30 to 50 cm), irregularly shaped mound feature.
The total size of this feature is about 10 m wide by about 25 m long. It may consist of several
smaller features in close proximity but lacking detailed subsurface information, it is treated here
as a single feature.
The site was investigated with seven shovel tests. All “lobes” of the mound feature were tested.
All seven of the tests were dug to 80 cm without encountering clay. Three shovel tests placed on
the mound recovered a total of ten prehistoric ceramics and one lithic from 10 to 50 cm below
the surface (Table 4-5). Four additional shovel tests in the immediate vicinity of the mound were
all negative. A site sketch map is presented in Figure 4-3.
The single lithic is a cortex flake from a tested pebble. The lithic material is a black chert
resembling Big Fork chert. The ceramic assemblage contained one rim and nine body fragments.
Decorative elements were found on the exterior of five sherds, which included two
incised/engraved, one incised/punctated, and two brushed sherds (Appendix C, Table C-1). The
incised/engraved sherds have different patterns. One has two sets of curved designs and the
second has five parallel lines. The sherd with the curved design has remnants of a red pigment in
the design elements. The incised/punctated sherd has an everted rim with an incised line parallel
and adjacent to the lip and a punctation below the line. The limited size of the sherd, 20 mm,
prohibits a more extensive analysis. The two brushed sherds have several shallow parallel lines.
None of the sherds are diagnostic of a particular ceramic type. Surface treatment is smoothed on
all sherds. Temper is almost exclusively grog with only two sherds containing bone and grog.

The site is situated in an area that has evidence of heavy use. Several private residences are
within view just beyond the USACE property line and a floating boat dock is nearby. It is clear
that the area of the site is frequently traversed as lakefront access. The natural vegetation has
been landscaped to a park-like effect and the area is probably used heavily for recreation (Figure
4-4). One of the shovel tests contained recent glass shards that resembled a hurricane lantern.

Site 41MR262
Site 41MR262 is the roadbed of the historic Port Bolivar Iron Ore Railroad. This railroad was
built during 1911-1912 and was abandoned in 1927 (Young 2002). It extended from Longview
in Gregg County to Ore City in Upshur County, across Cypress Creek (now Lake O’ the Pines)
to Warlock (formerly Ero) in the northwestern corner of Marion County. The line was originally
planned to extend north to an iron ore source near Hughes Springs in western Cass County but
was never completed. By 1914, length of the completed line totaled 30 miles (48 km) between
Longview and Ero (Odintz 2003). Here, the site number designates only that portion of the
railroad bed that exists within Marion County.
Not previously recorded as a site, the raised railroad bed is the dominant feature of the landscape
in the southern part of the Cedar Springs South inventory area. It extends into both low- and
high-probability areas. The railroad bed is about 3 to 4 m (10 to 13 ft) above the level of the
surrounding terrain and is about 2 to 3 m (6.5 to 10 ft) wide on the top surface. It extends in a
straight line in an east-northeasterly direction for about 800 m across the entire width of the
Cedar Spring South parcel from the Upshur county line to the Lake O’ the Pines shoreline
(Figure 4-5). West of the inventory area, the railroad bed continues into Upshur County,
presumably to Ore City and thence to Longview.

The raised bed is evenly covered with thick secondary pine forest, and large trees are growing
from the sloping sides and top of the feature (Figure 4-6). In several places, the linear feature is
cut through with stream and erosional channels, but it appears to be mostly intact. No timbers or
large metal artifacts were noted in association with the feature. A shovel cut in one of these
erosional faces revealed massive sand construction with no discernable stratigraphy.
The railroad was probably built in this location because the landform was a ridgeline that closely
approached Cypress Creek (it is now a peninsula into Lake O’ the Pines). A trestle was certainly

Page 18

Ecological Communications Corporation

Cultural Resource Inventory of 291 Acres at Lake O’ the Pines and Lake Wright Patman, Texas

built across Cypress Creek
and the bed was raised above
the surrounding surface in this
location to minimize the
elevational difference while
crossing the creek. The crosssection of the raised bed may
be calculated as roughly 12
m3, and just including the
length of the bed across the
current inventory parcel, up to
9-10,000 m3 (11-12,000 cubic
yards) of fill would have been
needed to construct the raised
bed. The source of this fill is
unknown but would have
almost certainly included the

nearest source including the
sand in the immediate vicinity.
This speculation is supported by the generally irregular topography in the area, with many
winding cuts and berms. Soil profiles of the shovel tests in the surrounding area also were highly
variable, with many shovel tests encountering clay at shallow depths while others were as deep
as 80 cm.
Away from the raised bed itself, the lateral boundaries of this linear historic site are uncertain.
Testing in high probability areas A and F recovered historic artifacts and these areas are here
considered to be within the site. Of 51 tests that were placed in area A and six tests that were
placed in area F, historic artifacts were found in 13 shovel tests, for a fairly high yield of 23%
(Table 4-6). Nineteen historic artifacts were recovered including eight iron nails, six glass
shards, two ceramic sherds, one iron bolt, one iron strap attachment, and one other piece of
tabular ferrous metal. Most of these artifacts were found in the upper 20 cm, but some were
found as deep as 60 cm.

Isolated Occurrence I-6
Shovel test I-6, located in a high-probability area in the southeastern portion of the peninsula,
recovered a single prehistoric ceramic sherd from 20 to 40 cm in a sandy silt deposit that
encountered silty clay at 45 cm. Four additional shovel tests (I-7 to I-10) within a 10 to 15 m
radius encountered the clay horizon at depths ranging from 35 to 50 cm and were all negative.
On this basis, the artifact in test I-6 is considered to be an isolated occurrence and was not further
recorded.
4.2 LAKE WRIGHT PATMAN
The single parcel at Lake Wright Patman totaled 145 acres and was inventoried using 196 shovel
tests for a final testing density of 1.4 tests per acre. These tests confirmed the location of one
previously known site (41CS33) and also recorded two newly discovered sites. In addition, the
location of previously located site 41CS76 was determined not to be within this inventory area.
4.2.1 Armstrong Landing East
Three cultural resource sites and one isolated occurrence are present in the parcel at Armstrong
Landing East. This inventory parcel was not stratified into high- and low-probability areas and
was surveyed with multiple parallel transects. Eleven of

Site 41CS33
Site 41CS33 was first recorded on May 4, 1964 by Leonard Graham of Texarkana. The site was
described as an occupation site with ceramics, lithics and charcoal scattered over a 3 to 4 acre
area. A “grinding slab” was collected from the surface. At that time, the area showed evidence
of previous cultivation and the site sketch map suggests that much of the site area was cleared of
trees, except for patches of “woods”. The site map also shows five “test trenches” in the eastern
portion of the site but these are not further described (Figure 4-7).
Today, the entire site area is wooded and there is no evidence of cultivation, other than a shallow
(20 to 60 cm) ditch which borders the northern and western edges of the site. There is no
evidence of the test trenches and no mounds or other features are visible. The surface of the site
is thickly covered with organic humus and pine duff and the ground surface is not visible; no
artifacts were seen on the surface of the site.

The area of “previous cultivation” shown on the 1964 sketch map is bounded between the ditch
on the west and north and by woods on the south and east. This area encompasses about 225 m
by 155 m and totals about 8-9 acres (3.5 ha.). Other than the five test trenches, shown in the

eastern portion of this area, the precise location of the 3-4 acre habitation area was unknown.
Six inventory transects (A-F) were established crossing the site and two shovel tests along each
transect were placed within the suspected site area (see Figure 4-7). All 12 of these tests were
negative, encountering sterile sand over sandy clay at depths ranging from 20 to 70 cm and at an
average depth of 46 cm. The following day, nine additional shovel tests were placed within the
center of this area. One of these tests (ST 8) was positive, giving overall results of one positive
test out of 21 excavated (5%). Despite these results, the site area is presumed to be the 100 m
diameter that was estimated previously on the basis of artifacts observed on the exposed ground
surface.
The single positive test was dug through sand to 40 cm before encountering clay and recovered
three ceramics from 0 to 20 cm. No lithics and no ground stone were found on the site and none
of the shovel tests observed charcoal.
All three sherds are body sherds with grog temper and smoothed surfaces. One sherd is plain,
one is brushed, and one is engraved. The plain sherd is 6 mm thick with the exterior half
oxidized and the interior reduced. The engraved sherd is 4 mm thick, and is completely
oxidized, with one curved line and one straight line. The straight line has three perpendicular
hatch-like lines extending from one end. This curvilinear design is commonly referred to in the
region as Ripley Engraved, which is dated to about 1430-1680 A.D. (Appendix C); however, the
small size of the sherd prohibits a definite association. The brushed sherd is oxidized and has
two wide parallel lines; no thickness was determined as the sherd is broken along the long axis.
Site 41CS286
Site 41CS286 is a newly discovered historic site. The site is located adjacent to the graded dirt
road that leads to Armstrong Landing. On the basis of positive shovel tests, historic features, and
surface artifacts, the site size is estimated to be about 40 m in diameter, or less than one acre in
area. The site is situated on the crest of a hill and the terrain in the vicinity is flat, very gently
sloping down to the north, east and south. The site area is wooded but undergrowth is minimal.
Two historic features are present (Figure 4-8). Feature 1 is a circular pit about 2 m (6 ft) in
diameter and about 80 to 100 cm (30 to 40 in) deep. The pit has sloping sides and has a few
rocks on the bottom. The function of Feature 1 is unknown but it may be a trash pit or privy.
Feature 2 is a rectangular shaped pit, measuring about 3 m (9 ft) wide (east to west) by about 3.5
m (11 ft) long (north to south) (Figure 4-9). It is about 1 m (3 ft) deep and its sides are
somewhat steeper than Feature 1. This pit has a small, shallow trench or “antechamber” on the
south side that measures about 1 m (3 ft) wide and gradually slopes down from the ground
surface to the bottom of the pit. The pit has abundant rocks in the bottom arranged to make a
smooth floor surface. Several large artifacts are visible in association with this pit and include
several iron barrel hoops, rusted cans, whole glass bottles, and bottle fragments. Feature 2 is
interpreted as the foundation of a small rectangular building, such as a tenant house or
outbuilding, and its subsurface remains, possibly a root cellar.
Despite the heavy ground cover of leaf litter and pine duff, several other large historic artifacts
were noted on the ground. These included tin cans showing triangular-punch openings, canning

jar lids, and glass bottles. To investigate site boundaries based on subsurface artifacts, 12 shovel
tests were dug in an expanding pattern from the site center. A total of six of these were positive,
recovering a variety of historic artifacts (Table 4-8). Of note was a triangular iron file measuring
12 cm long (broken) by 7 mm wide. Also present were six historic ceramic sherds, seven glass
shards including a solarized purple piece, and one thin, flat piece that may be window glass.
Also collected from the surface of the site within Feature 2 were two glass artifacts. The first is
the circular bottom to a canning jar measuring about 4.5 in. (11.4 cm) in diameter. Made of clear
glass, the bottom is molded with the following inscription:

of “previous cultivation” originally noted at site 41CS33, about 500 m (0.3 miles) to the north
and/or with other crop areas. Today, there is no evidence of cleared areas and the vicinity is
thickly and evenly covered with secondary tree growth. The site appears to be undisturbed.

Site 41CS287
Site 41CS287 is a newly discovered site located on a high bluff above Lake Wright Patman at an
elevation of about 245 ft. It is coincidentally located very close to where site 41CS76 had been
previously plotted on TARL maps. However, the two sites are not the same; 41CS76 had been
erroneously plotted. Recorded by James Malone in 1970, the location of 41CS76 is described as
a sandy beach at the mouth of Armstrong Creek at Lake Wright Patman and the elevation is
given as 222-228 ft; neither of
these matches the location
where the site is plotted.
Moreover, the original site
coordinates place 41CS76
about 400 m due north of its
erroneous plot on the TARL
4
maps. The true site location is
now under the lake level. In
consultation with TARL staff,
N
the mapped location of 41CS76
has now been corrected.
On the bluff above the lake is a
low relief (50 to 100 cm)
terrain feature that is 10 m
wide by up to about 60 to 70 m
long (Figure 4-10). This feature
appears to be natural but may
consist of several low mounds
of cultural origin in close
proximity. Other subtle terrain
undulations may be discerned
in this general location and it is
uncertain whether this feature
is natural or cultural.

from 0-20 cm and a tested pebble from 20 to 40 cm (Table 4-9). Four additional tests in this area
were all negative, including two more (O-4 and O-6) that were placed on the elevated mound.
The four tests placed on the mound all went through sand to 80 cm without encountering clay;
the two tests placed off the mound (O-5 and O-7) hit clay at 10 and 30 cm respectively.

Isolated Occurrences
Shovel test I-1, located near the southwestern boundary of the Armstrong Landing East parcel,
recovered two small lithic flakes in a sandy silt deposit that did not encounter clay above 80 cm.
One flake was recovered from 20 to 40 cm and another was found at 40 to 60 cm. Three
additional shovel tests (I-2 to I-3) in the immediate vicinity were all negative and encountered
clay at depths ranging from 30 cm to 55 cm. On this basis, the flakes in test I-1 are considered to
be an isolated occurrence and were not further recorded.
Shovel test JJ-2, located near the northeastern boundary of the Armstrong Landing East parcel,
on the hillslope above Armstrong Creek, recovered a single lithic flake from 40 to 60 cm in a
sandy deposit that encountered clay at 75 cm. Additional shovel tests in the immediate vicinity
(JJ-3 to JJ-5) reached clay at depths ranging from 45 cm to 75 cm, but these tests were all
negative. On this basis, the flake in test JJ-2 is considered to be an isolated occurrence and was
not further recorded.
Shovel test DD-2 was located in the southeastern portion of the inventory area, well away from
historic site 41CS286. This shovel test recovered from 40 to 50 cm an iron and ceramic furniture
caster. The white ceramic caster measures 1 and 3/8 in. (3.5 cm) in diameter by 5/8 in. (1.6 cm)
wide. It turns freely on the heavily rusted iron attachment that measures 2 1/4 in (5.7 cm) from
axle to tip. Additional shovel tests in the immediate vicinity were all negative and encountered
clay at variable depths. No historic features were noted in the vicinity. On this basis, the historic
artifact in test DD-2 is considered to be an isolated occurrence and was not further recorded.
Although spatially separated from historic site 41CS286, there is the strong presumption of
association.

5.0 CONCLUSIONS
5.1 SUMMARY OF RESULTS
This cultural resources inventory investigated four separate locations in three counties of East
Texas. Three parcels were at Lake O’ the Pines in Upshur and Marion Counties, and one parcel
was at Lake Wright Patman in Cass County. The sample consisted of 291 acres and the four
parcels ranged in size from 21 acres to 145 acres. Field methods included a pedestrian inventory
accompanied by excavation of 426 shovel tests. Shovel tests were approximately 30 cm in
diameter and were dug to either the clay horizon or to 80 cm below the surface. Overall testing
density for the project was 1.5 tests per acre. This is approximately equivalent to one test per 53
by 53 m grid square.
The inventory investigated a total of six archaeological sites (Table 5-1). One of these
archaeological sites was previously known and the current investigation recorded five new
archaeological sites. The six sites included four prehistoric sites and two historic period sites.
No historic buildings or structures were present in any of the inventory areas.

of 41MR262 after completion of the field survey.

Of the 426 shovel tests dug within all inventory areas, 31 were positive for an overall yield of
7.3%. Twenty-seven of these positive tests were on the six sites and four were isolated tests not
clearly associated with any site. The remaining 395 tests were negative, including 37 negative
tests that were excavated on sites and 358 negative tests that were dug on transects.
Five of the six sites yielded temporally sensitive artifacts, including prehistoric ceramics from
three sites and historic material from two sites. All of the prehistoric ceramics were grog- and
grog/bone-tempered Caddo and resembled sherds that have been dated elsewhere to the period
A.D. 1200-1500. Both historic sites date to the early decades of the twentieth century. No
projectile points or other temporally diagnostic lithic artifacts were recovered during the survey.
Three of the four prehistoric sites were situated on low mound features. On the basis of
configuration, setting and artifact content, two of these (41UR294, 41UR295) are interpreted as
cultural features while the third mound (41CS287) may or may not be natural.

5.2 MANAGEMENT RECOMMENDATIONS
The eligibility of any given archaeological site for inclusion on the NRHP is determined by
evaluating the site’s “significance,” or its potential to contribute meaningfully to future scientific
research. Research potential is assessed by comparing the types of data that are known - or are
suspected - to exist at the site, together with their provenience, context, and integrity, against a
set of research questions that have been previously recognized for similar sites in the region.
These research questions are discussed in the planning document for East Texas (Kenmotsu and
Perttula 1993).
One of the sites has been shown to be severely degraded and no longer retains any research
potential. Using the limited shovel testing inventory tactics, a clear site evaluation could not be
reached for the remaining five sites. At present, it is unknown whether or not these five sites
may be eligible for inclusion on the NRHP and they should be protected from adverse impacts.
If they cannot be protected, these sites should be further investigated to clearly determine NRHP
eligibility. Each site is discussed briefly below and a tabular summary is presented in Table 5-2.

Site

41CS33
Site 41CS33 is located within the Armstrong Landing East parcel at Lake Wight Patman. It was
originally recorded in 1964 as containing abundant ceramics, lithics, and charcoal, as well as
some ground stone within a previously cultivated clearing measuring approximately 100 m in
diameter. Five subsurface trenches were excavated at that time. This evidence is no longer
visible and the current survey logged one positive shovel test out of 21 assumed to be within the
site area. The positive test recovered three grog tempered Caddo ceramics that are assumed to
date to the period A.D. 1200-1500. Today, the site is adjacent to a boat landing and picnic area
and has suffered from decades of casual artifact collecting. Moreover, the terrain has been
thickly covered with a secondary forest and the ground surface is no longer visible. As a result
of these impacts including the previous cultivation, the site has been severely degraded and no
Page 28

Ecological Communications Corporation

Cultural Resource Inventory of 291 Acres at Lake O’ the Pines and Lake Wright Patman, Texas

longer retains any research potential. The site is recommended as not eligible for inclusion on
the NRHP and no further work is warranted.
41CS286
Site 41CS286 is located within the Armstrong Landing East parcel at Lake Wight Patman. It is a
newly recorded historic site and contains two pit features as well as abundant glass, iron, and
historic ceramic artifacts. Based on the distribution of positive shovel tests, the site area is
assumed to be about 40 m in diameter but may be larger. The site condition is good to excellent
other than a graded dirt road that appears to have clipped one side of the site. Artifacts date the
site to the early twentieth century and are consistent with the remains of a farmstead. The
remaining information potential of the site is doubtful but is unknown nonetheless and the site
should be avoided and protected. If the proposed undertaking cannot avoid impacts to the site, it
should be further investigated to clearly assess its data content and NRHP eligibility. Such
investigations should include both archival research as well as archaeological testing to include
the use of a metal detector to more clearly assess site size, buried features, and artifact content.
41CS287
Site 41CS287 is located within the Armstrong Landing East parcel at Lake Wight Patman. It is a
newly discovered prehistoric site that is coincidentally at the mapped location of previously
recorded site 41CS76. However, the current site is not 41CS76. As is suggested by the original
description of site location, that site is actually located about 400 m due north. The current site is
evidenced by two positive shovel tests and a low semi-circular ridge feature located on a flat hill
top. The ridge feature may be natural or may be several low cultural mounds in close proximity.
The shovel tests recovered only lithic artifacts; no ceramics were present. Currently, insufficient
information is known about the site to permit a reliable assessment of information content and
data potential. Consequently, the site should be protected and avoided. If the proposed
undertaking cannot avoid impacts to the site, it should be archaeologically tested to determine
the nature of the mound feature(s) and whether or not there are intact subsurface archaeological
deposits.
41MR262
Site 41MR262 is located in the Cedar Springs South inventory area at Lake O’ the Pines. It is an
800 m portion of the Port Bolivar Iron Ore Railroad, which was operated between 1912 and
1927. Archival research suggested that the rail line connected Longview in Gregg County with
Ore City in Upshur County, extended across Cypress Creek at this location, and terminated at
Ero (now Warlock) in northwestern Marion County. Here the railroad bed is raised above the
surrounding terrain by up to 3 m and is generally intact, although it has been cut though in
several locations by streams and erosional channels. Shovel tests in the surrounding area
suggested widespread but patchy surface disturbances and recovered a diversity of glass and
metal artifacts. No portion of the Port Bolivar Iron Ore Railroad has previously been recorded as
an archaeological site. While the railroad was a significant chapter in the economic development
of the region, the archaeological potential of the site is uncertain and the eligibility of the site for
the NRHP is unknown. Because of this, the site should be avoided and protected. If the

Ecological Communications Corporation

Page 29

Cultural Resource Inventory of 291 Acres at Lake O’ the Pines and Lake Wright Patman, Texas

proposed undertaking cannot avoid impacts to the site, it should be further investigated to clearly
assess its data content and NRHP eligibility. Such investigations should include both archival
research as well as archaeological testing to include the use of a metal detector to more clearly
assess the presence of unknown features.
41UR294
Site 41UR294 is a newly discovered prehistoric site located in the Cedar Springs North inventory
area at Lake O’ the Pines. The site is evidenced by a single, isolated low mound feature. Two
positive shovel tests contained Caddo ceramics to 40 cm. The site area is presumed to be about
15 to 20 m in diameter but may be larger. The site appears to be in good condition, but using the
limited survey tactics it is unknown whether there are intact archaeological deposits. As a result,
the site should be avoided and protected. If the proposed undertaking cannot avoid impacts to
the site, it should be archaeologically tested.
41UR295
Site 41UR295 is located in the Cedar Springs South inventory area on the shore of Lake O’ the
Pines. It is a newly discovered prehistoric site, evidenced by a low and irregularly shaped
mound that may be several features in close proximity. Three positive shovel tests contained
Caddo ceramics to 80 cm. Based on the positive tests and the mound feature(s), the site area is
presumed to measure about 20 to 30 m in diameter. The site is within sight of occupied dwellings
and has a temporary boat dock nearby. While there is no evidence of looting, recent glass shards
were recovered from a shovel test and the site appears to be heavily used. It is unknown whether
or not there are remaining intact archaeological deposits, and the site should be avoided and
protected. If the proposed undertaking cannot avoid impacts to the site, it should be
archaeologically tested to clearly assess NRHP eligibility.

PREHISTORIC CERAMIC ANALYSIS
Victor Galan
Introduction
The ceramic analysis focused on describing sherd attributes, vessel manufacture, and decorative
techniques. The data collected from the sherds, along with comments about unique
characteristics, are presented in Table C-1. As the sample size was small and being collected
from shovel tests, the interpretation was broad. A total of 22 sherds were examined and
described from an isolated find and three sites: 41CS33, 41UR294 and 41UR295. The analysis
of sherds from 41CS33 included three specimens while 41UR294 and 41UR295 included eight
and ten specimens, respectively. In general, the ceramic description and analysis found the
decorations and sherd thickness suggest Caddoan utilitarian use.
Definitions
Sherd attributes included collection data on vessel part, sherd size, and sherd thickness. Vessel
parts were described as base, rim, and body. Base sherds were identified by a flat and generally
thicker cross section from the underside of the vessel. Rim sherds included the lip of the vessel.
No rims were large enough to make an estimate of vessel size. Body sherds comprise the surface
of the vessel between the rim and base sherds. Sherd size was determined by placing the sherd
in the center of a scale of concentric rings with a 5 millimeter separation. Size was determined
as the ring closest to the edge of the sherd. Thickness was measured in millimeters (mm) with
calipers as the maximum perpendicular distance between the interior and exterior surfaces of the
sherd by pinching the thickest portion of the sherd between parallel edges of the calipers.
Vessel manufacture included examining temper and firing techniques. For this analysis, possible
kinds of temper were sand, bone, grog, or bone/grog. Temper was observed using a reflective
light microscope set at 25x magnification. Bone temper was identified by several white angular
inclusions in the vessel paste. Grog was identified by several fine angular inclusions of fired
clay. Firing was described using Teltser’s (1994:530-543) article with a chart of oxidation
patterns in sherd cross-sections.
Decoration techniques included decoration type, location, and surface treatment. Decoration
type included incised, engraved, punctuated, brushed, and plain categories for this analysis.
Some decorative elements were distinctive enough to relate to a specific type; however, without
decorative elements only descriptive and manufacture data were obtained. As stated in Suhm
and Jelks (1962:19), several varieties of vessels were only decorated around the rim leaving a
large portion of the vessel undecorated. Decoration location was on the exterior of the sherd
(convex side) only for this analysis and surface treatments were described as smooth with
surfaces being created while the vessel was wet.

Sample Descriptions
Site 41CS33. A total of three ceramic sherds were analyzed. All were described as body sherds
with grog temper and smoothed surfaces. One sherd was plain, one was brushed, and one was
engraved. The plain sherd was 6 mm thick with the exterior half oxidized and the interior
reduced. The engraved sherd was 4 mm thick and was completely oxidized, with one curved line
and one straight line. The straight line had three perpendicular hatch-like lines extending from
one end. This curvilinear design is commonly referred to in the region as Ripley Engraved;
however, the small size of the sherd prohibits a definite association. The brushed sherd was
oxidized and had two wide parallel lines; no thickness was determined as the sherd was broken
along the long axis. Given the total sherd count and variations in decoration and firing, no
correlations or patterns could be determined.
41UR294. The site 41UR294 ceramic sherd sample included eight specimens, including one rim
and seven body fragments. Decorative elements were found on the exterior of three (37%)
sherds, which included one incised, one incised/punctuated, and one engraved. The incised
sherd was a body sherd with three parallel lines 10 mm apart and 2 mm wide each in a diagonal
pattern similar to the Maydelle Incised or Pease Brushed-Incised (Suhm and Jelks 1962). The
incised/punctuated sherd was a rim similar to the Canton Incised (Suhm and Jelks 1962; Bruseth
and Perttula 1981) with an element of diagonal parallel incised lines and an element of
punctuations all adjacent to a standing rim. The engraved sherd included one slightly curved
line. Surface treatment was smoothed on all sherds. Temper was almost exclusively grog with
only one plain sherd containing bone and grog. Sherd size ranged from 30 to 50 mm with the
most common size of 30 mm (n=4) with the remaining three sherds between 40 mm and 50 mm
in size. Thickness followed a similar trend with a range from 6 mm to 9 mm. The mode
thickness was 8 mm for three sherds followed by sherds 7 mm and 9 mm with 2 specimens each.
The thinnest sherd was 6 mm and was also the only engraved sherd. Firing oxidation and
reduction had reduced cores and oxidized surfaces 63% (n=5) followed by completely reduced
sherds (n=2) and reduced interior with oxidized exteriors (n=1). The three decorated sherds all
had more reduction than oxidation.
41UR295. The site 41UR295 ceramic sherd sample included ten specimens, including one rim
and nine body fragments. Decorative elements were found on the exterior of five (50%) sherds,
which included two incised, one incised/punctuated, and two brushed sherds. The incised sherds
had different patterns. One had two sets of curved designs and the second had five parallel lines.
The sherd with the curved design had remnants of a red pigment in the design elements. The
incised/punctuated sherd had an everted rim with an incised line parallel and adjacent to the lip
and a punctation below the line. The limited size of the sherd, 20 mm, prohibited a more
extensive diagnosis. The two brushed sherds had several shallow parallel lines. None of the
sherds were diagnostic of a particular ceramic type. Surface treatment was smoothed on all
sherds. Temper was almost exclusively grog with only two sherds containing bone and grog.
Sherd size ranged from 20 to 35 mm with the most common size of 35 mm (n=5) and the
remaining sherds between 20 mm and 30 mm in size. Thickness followed a similar trend with a
range from 6 mm to 9 mm with the majority of the sherds (n=7) between 6 and 7 mm. Firing
oxidation and reduction had reduced cores and oxidized surfaces 90% (n=9) with only one
instance of a reduced interior with oxidized exterior (n=1).

Isolate. The isolated find sherd was a brushed body sherd with a grog temper and a reduced
interior and oxidized exterior. No ceramic type description could be made.
Results
The analysis of the ceramic collections from 41CS33, 41UR294, and 41UR295 found evidence
of general Caddo domestic ceramic use. The fact that the ceramic samples are so small suggest
either more excavations are required to gather a representative sample, or that none of the sites
contain significant amounts of preserved information for further investigation.
