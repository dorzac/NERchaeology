ABSTRACT

This report describes the results of an intensive archeological survey conducted by
Horizon Environmental Services, Inc. (Horizon), on behalf of Williamson County for the Farm-toMarket Road (FM) 1660 realignment project near Hutto in Williamson County, Texas, in the
Texas Department of Transportation’s (TxDOT) Austin District. Williamson County is proposing
to realign approximately 19.5 kilometers (km) (12.1 miles [mi]) of FM 1660 between County
Road (CR) 101 north of Hutto and CR 401 southeast of Hutto. The proposed FM 1660
realignment right-of-way (ROW) would average approximately 61 meters (m) (200 feet [ft]) in
width along its approximately 19.5-km- (12.1-mi-) long route, covering a total area of roughly
131 hectares (ha) (323 acres [ac]). The project area consists of a mix of existing (publicly
owned) road ROWs as well as proposed (privately owned) new ROW, including approximately
38 ha (95 ac; 29%) of existing road ROWs and 93 ha (228 ac; 71%) of proposed new ROW.
Currently available engineering schematics are not to scale; however, the maximum depth of
impacts that is currently anticipated based on typical construction design and practices would
measure no more than 1.5 to 3.0 m (5.0 to 10.0 ft) in depth across most of the Area of Potential
Effect (APE), with areas of deeper impacts exceeding 3 m (10 ft) possible where bridge-support
pylons would be installed into local bedrock and in the vicinity of bridge approaches.
One archeological site, 41WM1134, was documented within the APE as a result of the
intensive archeological survey. Site 41WM1134 was originally recorded in 2005 during a prior
archeological survey performed for an earlier proposed ROW of the FM 1660 relocation project.
During the current survey, the boundaries of site 41WM1134 were expanded into the current
project area on a tract of privately owned land within the proposed new ROW (no portions of the
site were documented within areas of existing public ROW). The portion of the site investigated
during the current survey covers an area of approximately 4.0 hectares (ha) (9.9 acres [ac]).
Site 41WM1134 is a multiple-component site consisting of a very low-density surficial scatter of
aboriginal lithic artifacts, including tested chert cobbles, large decortication flakes, and lithic
cores and debitage, as well as historic-age debris, including bottle glass, whiteware ceramic
sherds, and brick fragments. Archeological materials are scattered across a plowed agricultural
field that also contains an abundance of naturally occurring, chert-bearing cobbles. Thus, the
aboriginal component on the site appears to represent a raw material procurement area (i.e.,
“quarry”), though the lack of temporally diagnostic artifacts on the site precludes establishing a
date of occupation beyond a generalized prehistoric timeframe. The historic-age debris
suggests an early to mid-20th-century presence in the area, though no structures or cultural

features were observed. Based on an informant interview with the current landowner and a
chain-of-title search for the names of prior landowners extending back to 1857, none of the
landowners of the tract on which the site is situated appear to have been historically noteworthy,
and no historic events of importance are known to have occurred on the property. Site
boundaries were documented only within the current project area and may expand beyond
them. Based on the lack of integrity of aboriginal and historic-age archeological materials, the
lack of cultural features or other structural remains, the lack of diagnostic artifacts (for the
aboriginal component), and the lack of associated persons or events of historic significance and
the generalized domestic character of the debris (for the historic-age component), the
investigated portion of site 41WM1134 within the current project area is recommended as
ineligible for inclusion in the National Register of Historic Places (NRHP) and for designation as
a State Archeological Landmark (SAL). No archeological materials were collected from the site
during the current survey.
In addition to the intensive archeological survey, mechanical scraping operations were
performed in the vicinity of the historic-age Monadale Cemetery 1, a small, late 19th- to early
20th-century Hispanic cemetery located just east of the intersection of the existing FM 1660
ROW and CR 133 near the northern end of the project area. The Monadale Cemetery contains
3 graves marked by headstones as well as up to 8 unmarked graves suggested by the presence
of several metal grave markers stacked against a tree by the cemetery entrance. The
boundaries of the cemetery are marked by a continuous woven-wire fence. The cemetery itself
does not fall within the current project area; however, areas of proposed new ROW pass within
23 meters (m) (75 feet [ft]) of the marked cemetery boundaries, and current THC guidelines
require that any portions of a proposed project’s APE that fall within 23 m (75 ft) of marked
cemetery boundaries need to be assessed for unmarked graves. Mechanical scraping
operations were performed along the edge of the proposed new ROW on the side facing the
cemetery to determine whether or not any unmarked graves are present within the APE. The
proposed new ROW in the vicinity of the cemetery consists of an active agricultural field that
had been plowed but not yet planted for the season. The modern plowzone was removed along
a 5-m- (15-ft-) wide scrape extending along the edge of the proposed new ROW facing the
cemetery, and the upper interface of underlying natural soils was carefully observed for any
evidence of grave shafts, burial furniture, coffin hardware, human bone, or other indications of
unmarked graves. In addition, 7 backhoe trenches were excavated to depths of 1.8 to 2.3 m
(5.9 to 7.5 ft) below surface at approximately 15-m (50-ft) intervals along the edge of the
scraped area to verify that the soils observed within the scraped area were, in fact, natural soils
(as opposed to artificial fill) that are conducive to observing unmarked grave shafts (if present).
The soils underlying the plowzone were determined to be natural alluvial sediments deposited
during the Pleistocene era and appear to be conducive to identifying unmarked graves. No
unmarked graves were observed within the APE as a result of the scraping operations.

Originally named Stringtown, the community of Monadale was later renamed after Edward Mandell House’s
daughter Mona. As a result of a later clerical error, the name of the community was inadvertently changed to
Monodale, the name that appears on many area maps. The original spelling, “Monadale,” is preferred throughout this
report.

Based on the results of the survey-level investigations documented in this report, no
potentially significant archeological resources or unmarked graves associated with the
Monadale Cemetery would be affected by the proposed undertaking. One multiple-component
aboriginal and historic-age archeological site, 41WM1134, was documented within the APE,
though the investigated portion of the site that falls within the boundaries of the APE is
recommended as ineligible for inclusion in the NRHP and for designation as an SAL. No
archeological materials were collected during the survey, and no unmarked graves associated
with the historic-age Monadale Cemetery were observed within the APE.

MANAGEMENT SUMMARY

This report describes the results of an intensive archeological survey conducted by
Horizon Environmental Services, Inc. (Horizon), on behalf of Williamson County for the Farm-toMarket Road (FM) 1660 Realignment Project near Hutto in Williamson County, Texas, in the
Texas Department of Transportation’s (TxDOT) Austin District. Williamson County is proposing
to realign approximately 19.5 kilometers (km) (12.1 miles [mi]) of FM 1660 between County
Road (CR) 101 north of Hutto and CR 401 southeast of Hutto. The proposed route of the
FM 1660 realignment right-of-way (ROW) would begin at the intersection of the existing ROW of
FM 1660 and CR 101 north of Hutto and run southeastward along the existing FM 1660 ROW to
the point at which FM 1660 and CR 133 intersect. At this point, the proposed realigned ROW
would diverge from the existing FM 1660 ROW and run eastward along the existing CR 133
ROW to the intersection of CR 133 and CR 132. At the point where CR 132 turns southward,
the proposed realigned ROW would continue eastward within a corridor of proposed new ROW,
turning southward at Little Mustang Creek, crossing US Highway (US) 79, and then curving
southeastward again to terminate at CR 401 a short distance south of Boggy Creek. Roughly
the northern half of the proposed project area follows the ROWs of existing roads, including
FM 1660, CR 133, and CR 132, though the proposed ROW along this segment would be
widened and would therefore include both the existing ROWs of these roadways as well as
adjacent proposed new ROW. Roughly the southern half of the proposed project area consists
predominantly of proposed new ROW, though the proposed ROW would incorporate small
areas of existing ROW at various road crossings, including CR 136, US Highway (US) 79,
CR 132, and CR 134, as well as at the southern terminus of the proposed project area at
CR 401. The Area of Potential Effect (APE) of the proposed undertaking consists of the entire
19.5-km- (12.1-mi) proposed corridor.
The proposed FM 1660 realignment ROW would average approximately 61 meters (m)
(200 feet [ft]) in width along its approximately 19.5-km- (12.1-mi-) long route, covering a total
area of roughly 131 hectares (ha) (323 acres [ac]). The project area consists of a mix of
existing (publicly owned) road rights-of-way (ROW) as well as proposed (privately owned) new
ROW, including approximately 38 ha (95 ac; 29%) of existing road ROWs and 93 ha (228 ac;
71%) of proposed new ROW. Currently available engineering schematics are not to scale;
however, the maximum depth of impacts that is currently anticipated based on typical
construction design and practices would measure no more than 1.5 to 3.0 m (5.0 to 10.0 ft)
across most of the APE, with areas of deeper impacts exceeding 3 m (10 ft) possible where

bridge-support pylons would be installed into local bedrock and in the vicinity of bridge
approaches.
The proposed undertaking is being sponsored by Williamson County, a political
subdivision of the State of Texas; as such, the project would fall under the jurisdiction of the
Antiquities Code of Texas. In addition, the project will undergo review by TxDOT and the
Federal Highway Administration (FHWA); as such, the project would also fall under the
jurisdiction of the National Historic Preservation Act (NHPA). Since the proposed undertaking
represents a publicly sponsored project with the potential for damaging or destroying
archeological resources, Williamson County was required to provide for an archeological
inventory survey of the proposed impact area to meet its legal responsibilities under existing
federal and state guidelines to evaluate the potential effects of the undertaking on significant
archeological resources.
To meet its responsibilities under state and federal statutes, Williamson County
contracted with Horizon Environmental Services, Inc. (Horizon), through its design contractor,
HNTB Corporation (HNTB), to secure applicable clearances for archeological resources.
Horizon performed an intensive archeological survey of the APE between November 30 and
December 3, 2010. Horizon archeologist Michael Mudd served as project archeologist;
Rosemarie Pavel and Jared Wiersema served as archeological field technicians; and Jeffrey D.
Owens served as Principal Investigator. In connection with the intensive archeological survey of
the proposed FM 1660 realignment project, approximately 21 man-hours were expended during
the process of scoping the project, coordinating with regulatory agencies, and obtaining a Texas
Antiquities Permit; approximately 96 man-hours were expended during the archeological survey
fieldwork; 12 man-hours were expended by laboratory personnel after completion of fieldwork
processing field data; and 105 man-hours were expended compiling this technical report
summarizing the findings of the survey. The survey was conducted under Texas Antiquities
Permit No. 5788.
Subsequent to completion of the intensive archeological survey, at the direction of the
Texas Historical Commission (THC) and TxDOT, Horizon performed mechanical scraping
operations within an area of proposed new ROW located in the vicinity of the Monadale
Cemetery 2, a small, late-19th- to early-20th-century Hispanic cemetery located near the
northern end of the proposed project area. The marked boundaries of this small cemetery are
located outside of the proposed project area; however, the western edge of the proposed new
ROW in this area approached to within 23 m (75 ft) of the cemetery fence line. Between
January 25 and 28, 2011, Horizon conducted mechanical scraping operations and backhoe
trenching along the edge of the proposed new ROW facing the cemetery to determine whether
or not any unmarked graves were present within the APE. Jeffrey D. Owens supervised the
mechanical scraping operations; Michael Mudd served as an archeological field assistant; and

Jared Wiersema operated the backhoe. In connection with the mechanical scraping operations,
approximately 70 man-hours were expended conducting the fieldwork. Time spent processing
field data and writing the draft technical report have been combined into the labor estimates
presented above.
During the intensive archeological survey, the approximately 19.5-km- (12.1-mi-) long by
61-m- (200-ft-) wide APE was traversed on foot by Horizon’s archeologists in parallel, linear
transects spaced no more than 30 m (100 ft) apart. The modern ground surface was thoroughly
inspected for historic and prehistoric archeological resources, and cutbanks associated with
stream courses and erosional gullies were carefully examined to obtain information on local
stratigraphy and to identify any exposed subsurface archeological resources. For linear
projects, the Texas State Minimum Archeological Survey Standards (TSMASS) require a
minimum of 16 subsurface probes per mile of 100-ft width of ROW; thus, a minimum of
approximately 387 subsurface probes would be required for the current project. The shovel
testing density may be increased in areas with higher probabilities to contain archeological
resources, such as stream terraces, and decreased in areas with low probabilities for
archeological resources, such as heavily disturbed areas or upland settings with minimal soil
cover.
Horizon excavated a total of 328 shovel tests during the survey; thus, the TSMASS
requirements were not quite met for a project area of this length and width. Approximately 29%
of the APE consisted of existing road ROWs that had experienced extensive prior impacts from
construction, use, and ongoing maintenance of the transportation facilities, many of which had
experienced additional impacts from installation of various overhead and subsurface utility lines
and intersecting driveways. Judgmental shovel testing was conducted within these disturbed
existing road ROWs to confirm the apparent extent of prior impacts inferred via visible surface
conditions, but shovel testing within existing road ROWs was not as extensive as within areas of
proposed new ROW, which had experienced relatively fewer prior impacts from construction.
Of the total of 328 shovel tests excavated during the survey, 64 shovel tests (20%) were
excavated in areas of existing (publicly owned) ROW and 264 shovel tests (80%) were
excavated in areas of proposed new (privately owned) ROW.
Furthermore, 1 segment of proposed new ROW extending northwest of Little Mustang
Creek could not be accessed during the survey due to the refusal of the landowner to provide
access. This segment of proposed new ROW measures approximately 1.0 km (0.6 mi) in length
and represents the only segment of the APE that was not surveyed during the current effort.
This unsurveyed segment, which represents approximately 5% of the total APE, consists of an
open, plowed agricultural field, and this area was casually inspected from within the adjacent
areas of the APE to which access was available during the survey. The unsurveyed area
appeared to be identical to neighboring areas, consisting of mature Blackland Prairie soils under
active cultivation, in which no archeological materials were observed. In the event that any
unrecorded archeological materials are present in the unsurveyed portion of the APE, it is likely
that they would occur in disturbed, eroded, surficial contexts and lack depth or integrity. It is
Horizon’s opinion that no intact archeological deposits occur in the short segment of the APE
that was not accessible for survey.

Management Summary

The vast majority of the areas of proposed new ROW in the APE consist of open,
plowed agricultural fields that are under active cultivation; however, as the survey was
conducted in winter, the fields were not planted and ground surface visibility was 100% in most
areas. While the headwaters of 3 minor streams (Mustang Creek, South Fork of Mustang
Creek, and Little Mustang Creek), cross the APE, 2 of these streams (South Fork of Mustang
Creek and Little Mustang Creek) are little more than erosional divots in the landscape, and
Mustang Creek has been extensively channelized. Soils in the APE consist of mature Blackland
Prairie sediments derived from Pleistocene-age fluviatile terrace deposits and Upper
Cretaceous-age marl formations, and no Holocene-age alluvial sediments are present in the
APE. Based on the geomorphological characteristics of the landforms traversed by the APE,
any archeological materials would be expected to be restricted to surficial contexts that have
experienced moderate to extensive disturbance via plowing and erosion. As such, the APE as a
whole, including both areas of existing and proposed new ROW, possesses low potential to
contain intact archeological deposits. Taking into consideration the extent of prior impacts
within existing road ROWs and the short segment of proposed new ROW that was not
accessible during the survey, as well as the geomorphological characteristics of the areas of
proposed new ROW, it is Horizon’s opinion that the density of shovel tests excavated during the
survey was more than adequate for identifying archeological materials within the APE.
One archeological site, 41WM1134, was documented within the APE as a result of the
intensive archeological survey. Site 41WM1134 was originally recorded in 2005 during a prior
archeological survey performed for an earlier proposed ROW of the FM 1660 relocation project.
During the current survey, the boundaries of site 41WM1134 were expanded into the current
project area on a tract of privately owned land within the proposed new ROW (no portions of the
site were documented within areas of existing publicly owned ROW). The portion of the site
investigated during the current survey covers an area of approximately 4.0 hectares (ha)
(9.9 acres [ac]). Site boundaries were documented only within the current project area and may
expand beyond them. Site 41WM1134 is a multiple-component site consisting of a low-density,
surficial scatter of aboriginal lithic artifacts, including tested chert cobbles, large decortication
flakes, and lithic cores and debitage, as well as historic-age debris, including bottle glass,
whiteware ceramic sherds, and a few brick fragments. Archeological materials are scattered
across a plowed agricultural field that also contains an abundance of naturally occurring, chertbearing cobbles. Thus, the aboriginal component on the site appears to represent a raw
material procurement area (i.e., “quarry”), though the lack of temporally diagnostic artifacts on
the site precludes establishing a date of occupation beyond a generalized prehistoric timeframe.
The historic-age debris suggests an early to mid-20th-century presence in the area, though no
structures or cultural features were observed. The 1936 General Highway Map of Williamson
County, Texas (TxDOT 1936), shows a structure that may be located within or near the
documented boundaries of site 41WM1134 that may represent a historic-age residence that
may account for the historic-age artifact scatter. Mr. Norman Fuessel, the current owner of the
property on which the site is located, stated in an informant interview with the author that no
structures were present in this area when his family acquired the property. The structure does
not appear on the 1982 US Geological Survey (USGS) Hutto, Texas, topographic quadrangle,
the earliest historic-age topographic map that could be located. Based on an informant

interview with the current landowner and a chain-of-title search for the names of prior
landowners extending back to 1857, none of the landowners of the tract on which the site is
situated appear to have been historically noteworthy, and no historic events of importance are
known to have occurred on the property. The historic-age Monadale Cemetery is located just
west of the documented boundaries of site 41WM1134 beyond the current project’s APE, but is
not believed to be related to the historic-age artifact scatter. Based on the lack of integrity of
aboriginal and historic-age cultural material, the lack of cultural features or other structural
remains, the lack of diagnostic artifacts (for the aboriginal component), and the lack of
associated persons or events of historic significance and the generalized domestic character of
the debris (for the historic-age component), the investigated portion of site 41WM1134 within
the current project area is recommended as ineligible for inclusion in the National Register of
Historic Places (NRHP) and for designation as a State Archeological Landmark (SAL). No
cultural materials were collected from site 41WM1134 during the current survey.
In addition to the intensive archeological survey, mechanical scraping operations were
performed in the vicinity of the historic-age Monadale Cemetery, a small late-19th- to early 20thcentury Hispanic cemetery located just east of the intersection of the existing FM 1660 ROW
and County Road (CR) 133 near the northern end of the project area. The Monadale Cemetery
contains 3 graves marked by headstones as well as up to 8 unmarked graves suggested by the
presence of several metal grave markers stacked against a tree by the cemetery entrance. The
boundaries of the cemetery are marked by a continuous woven-wire fence. The cemetery itself
does not fall within the current project area; however, areas of proposed new ROW pass within
23 meters (m) (75 feet [ft]) of the marked cemetery boundaries, and current THC guidelines
require that any portions of a proposed project’s APE that fall within 23 m (75 ft) of marked
cemetery boundaries need to be assessed for unmarked graves. Mechanical scraping
operations were performed along the edge of the proposed new ROW on the side facing the
cemetery to determine whether or not any unmarked graves are present within the APE. The
proposed new ROW in the vicinity of the cemetery consists of an active agricultural field that
had been plowed but not yet planted for the season. The modern plowzone was removed along
a 5-m- (15-ft-) wide scrape extending along the edge of the proposed new ROW facing the
cemetery, and the upper interface of underlying natural soils was carefully observed for any
evidence of grave shafts, burial furniture, coffin hardware, human bone, or other indications of
unmarked graves. In addition, 7 backhoe trenches were excavated to depths of 1.8 to 2.3 m
(5.9 to 7.5 ft) below surface at approximately 15-m (50-ft) intervals along the edge of the
scraped area to verify that the soils observed within the scraped area were, in fact, natural soils
(as opposed to artificial fill) that are conducive to observing unmarked grave shafts (if present).
The soils underlying the plowzone were determined to be natural alluvial sediments deposited
during the Pleistocene era. No unmarked graves were observed within the APE as a result of
the scraping operations.
Aside from the single archeological site (41WM1134), no other archeological materials,
archeological deposits, or isolated occurrences of artifacts—historic or prehistoric—were
observed within the APE during the survey. In accordance with 36 CFR 800.4, Horizon has
made a reasonable and good faith effort to identify archeological historic properties within the
APE. No archeological resources were identified that meet the criteria for listing on the NRHP

according to 36 CFR 60.4 or for designation as State Archeological Landmarks (SALs)
according to 13 TAC 26, and no further archeological work is recommended in connection with
the proposed undertaking. No unmarked graves associated with the historic-age Monadale
Cemetery were observed within the APE during mechanical scraping and backhoe trenching
operations. However, in the unlikely event that any human remains or burial furniture are
inadvertently discovered at any point during construction, use, or ongoing maintenance in the
project area, even in previously surveyed areas, all work should cease immediately and TxDOT
and the THC should be notified of the discovery.

Farm-to-Market Road 1660 Realignment Project, Hutto, Williamson County, Texas

1.0 INTRODUCTION

This report describes the results of an intensive archeological survey conducted by
Horizon Environmental Services, Inc. (Horizon), on behalf of Williamson County for the Farm-toMarket Road (FM) 1660 Realignment Project near Hutto in Williamson County, Texas, in the
Texas Department of Transportation’s (TxDOT) Austin District. Williamson County is proposing
to realign approximately 19.5 kilometers (km) (12.1 miles [mi]) of FM 1660 between County
Road (CR) 101 north of Hutto and CR 401 southeast of Hutto (Figure 1). The proposed route of
the FM 1660 realignment right-of-way (ROW) would begin at the intersection of the existing
ROW of FM 1660 and CR 101 north of Hutto and run southeastward along the existing FM 1660
ROW to the point at which FM 1660 and CR 133 intersect. At this point, the proposed realigned
ROW would diverge from the existing FM 1660 ROW and run eastward along the existing
CR 133 ROW to the intersection of CR 133 and CR 132. At the point where CR 132 turns
southward, the proposed realigned ROW would continue eastward within a corridor of proposed
new ROW, turning southward at Little Mustang Creek, crossing US Highway (US) 79, and then
curving southeastward again to terminate at CR 401 a short distance south of Boggy Creek.
Roughly the northern half of the proposed project area follows the ROWs of existing roads,
including FM 1660, CR 133, and CR 132, though the proposed ROW along this segment would
be widened and would therefore include both the existing ROWs of these roadways as well as
adjacent proposed new ROW. Roughly the southern half of the proposed project area consists
predominantly of proposed new ROW, though the proposed ROW would incorporate small
areas of existing ROW at various road crossings, including CR 136, US 79, CR 132, and
CR 134, as well as at the southern terminus of the proposed project area at CR 401. The Area
of Potential Effect (APE) of the proposed undertaking consists of the entire 19.5-km- (12.1-mi)
proposed corridor.
The proposed FM 1660 realignment ROW would average approximately 61 meters (m)
(200 feet [ft]) in width along its approximately 19.5-km- (12.1-mi-) long route, covering a total
area of roughly 131 hectares (ha) (323 acres [ac]). The project area consists of a mix of
existing (publicly owned) road rights-of-way (ROW) as well as proposed (privately owned) new
ROW, including approximately 38 ha (95 ac; 29%) of existing road ROWs and 93 ha (228 ac;
71%) of proposed new ROW (Figures 2 to 4). Currently available engineering schematics are
not to scale; however, the maximum depth of impacts that is currently anticipated based on
typical construction design and practices would measure no more than 1.5 to 3.0 m (5.0 to
10.0 ft) across most of the APE, with areas of deeper impacts exceeding 3 m (10 ft) possible

where bridge-support pylons would be installed into local bedrock and in the vicinity of bridge
approaches.
The proposed undertaking is being sponsored by Williamson County, a political
subdivision of the State of Texas; as such, the project would fall under the jurisdiction of the
Antiquities Code of Texas. In addition, the project will undergo review by TxDOT and the
Federal Highway Administration (FHWA); as such, the project would also fall under the
jurisdiction of the National Historic Preservation Act (NHPA). Since the proposed undertaking
represents a publicly sponsored project with the potential for damaging or destroying
archeological resources, Williamson County was required to provide for an archeological
inventory survey of the proposed impact area to meet its legal responsibilities under existing
federal and state guidelines to evaluate the potential effects of the undertaking on significant
archeological resources.
To meet its responsibilities under state and federal statutes, Williamson County
contracted with Horizon Environmental Services, Inc. (Horizon), through its design contractor,
HNTB Corporation (HNTB), to secure applicable clearances for archeological resources.
Horizon performed an intensive archeological survey of the APE between November 30 and
December 3, 2010. Horizon archeologist Michael Mudd served as project archeologist;
Rosemarie Pavel and Jared Wiersema served as archeological field technicians; and Jeffrey D.
Owens served as Principal Investigator. In connection with the intensive archeological survey of
the proposed FM 1660 realignment project, approximately 21 man-hours were expended during
the process of scoping the project, coordinating with regulatory agencies, and obtaining a Texas
Antiquities Permit; approximately 96 man-hours were expended during the archeological survey
fieldwork; 12 man-hours were expended by laboratory personnel after completion of fieldwork
processing field data; and 105 man-hours were expended compiling this technical report
summarizing the findings of the survey. The survey was conducted under Texas Antiquities
Permit No. 5788.
Subsequent to completion of the intensive archeological survey, at the direction of the
Texas Historical Commission (THC) and TxDOT, Horizon performed mechanical scraping
operations within an area of proposed new ROW located in the vicinity of the Monadale
Cemetery 3, a small, late-19th- to early-20th-century Hispanic cemetery located near the
northern end of the proposed project area. The marked boundaries of this small cemetery are
located outside of the proposed project area; however, the western edge of the proposed new
ROW in this area approached to within 23 m (75 ft) of the cemetery fence line. Between
January 25 and 28, 2011, Horizon conducted mechanical scraping operations and backhoe
trenching along the edge of the proposed new ROW facing the cemetery to determine whether
or not any unmarked graves were present within the APE. Jeffrey D. Owens supervised the
mechanical scraping operations; Michael Mudd served as an archeological field assistant; and

Originally named Stringtown, the community of Monadale was later renamed after Edward Mandell House’s
daughter Mona. As a result of a later clerical error, the name of the community was inadvertently changed to
Monodale, the name that appears on many area maps. The original spelling, “Monadale,” is preferred throughout this
report.

Jared Wiersema operated the backhoe. In connection with the mechanical scraping operations,
approximately 70 man-hours were expended conducting the fieldwork. Time spent processing
field data and writing the draft technical report have been combined into the labor estimates
presented above.
This report presents the results of the archeological survey of the proposed FM 1660
realignment project. Following this introductory chapter, Chapters 2.0 and 3.0 present the
environmental and cultural backgrounds of the project area, respectively. Chapter 4.0 describes
the research objectives, results of archival research, and archeological survey methods
implemented during the survey. Chapter 5.0 presents the results of the survey and describes
archeological resources documented during the survey, and Chapter 6.0 presents archeological
resource management recommendations for the project. Chapter 7.0 lists the references cited
in the report. Appendix A presents data collected from individual shovel tests excavated during
the project, Appendix B presents data collected from backhoe trenches excavated during
mechanical scraping operations conducted in the vicinity of the Monadale Cemetery, and
Appendix C contains a chain of title on the Fuessel tract, the property on which the single
archeological site documented during the survey (41WM1134) is located.

2.0 ENVIRONMENTAL SETTING

2.1

PHYSIOGRAPHY AND HYDROLOGY

The FM 1660 project area is located in south-central Williamson County, Texas.
Williamson County is situated near the southern end of the Lampasas Cut Plain (Hill 1901; Hill
and Vaughn 1900; Johnson 1931:125) in Central Texas and close to the common junction of 3
significant physiographic provinces—the Lampasas Cut Plain, the Edwards Plateau, and the
Blackland Prairie. The Blackland Prairie, the narrow physiographic zone situated between the
Edwards Plateau to the west and the Gulf Coastal Plain to the east, is a low, rolling land that
extends in a narrow band along the eastern edge of the Balcones fault zone from the Red River
Valley in northeastern Texas to the southern edge of the Edwards Plateau. This is an area of
low topographic relief and poor drainage in which water often ponds after rainstorms and
streams flow at very gentle gradients. The Edwards Plateau and Balcones Escarpment are
associated with a great fault system that arcs across Texas to form a distinct boundary between
uplands composed primarily of limestone bedrock and lower plains composed mostly of softer
rocks. In places, this boundary is marked by an abrupt scarp (the Balcones Escarpment) and in
others by a more gradational ramp, but the entire length of this transition zone is a major
ecotone in terms of topography, bedrock, hydrology, soil, vegetation, and animal life.
The Lampasas Cut Plain is a roughly triangular area of rolling hill country in central and
north-central Texas situated between the Brazos and Colorado rivers ranging in elevation from
230 to 400 m (754 to 1,312 ft) above mean sea level (amsl). The Lampasas Cut Plain forms a
limestone upland that has been dissected by the Brazos River and its tributaries, resulting in
landforms characterized by generally rounded uplands cut by moderately broad, shallow
valleys. Soil is thin to absent on the bedrock and supports a mixed savanna flora, whereas soil
is moderately deep in valley floors, where it supports mixed riparian woodlands and forests.
Karst features include sinks, caves, and rockshelters, but such are neither common nor
extensive. Edwards chert is locally abundant but not widespread across the Lampasas Cut
Plain and is of high quality in some places.
Hydrologically, the study area is situated within the Brazos River basin. While the
project area is situated in a predominantly upland environment, the headwaters of 3 minor
streams—Mustang Creek, South Fork of Mustang Creek, and Little Mustang Creek—cross the
APE. Two of these streams (South Fork of Mustang Creek and Little Mustang Creek) are little

HJN 090047 AR

Chapter 2.0: Environmental Setting

more than erosional divots in the landscape. Mustang Creek is somewhat more substantial, but
it has been extensively channelized where it crosses the APE. Little Mustang Creek and South
Fork of Mustang Creek converge into Mustang Creek east of the project, Mustang Creek flows
generally eastward, discharging into Brushy Creek southeast of the city of Taylor. Brushy
Creek, in turn, flows generally northeastward, discharging into the Brazos River in eastern
Milam County. The Brazos River flows southeastward across the Blackland Prairie and Gulf
Coastal Plain, ultimately discharging into the Gulf of Mexico a short distance northeast of East
Matagorda Bay.
The project area traverses a rolling upland environment that has been lightly dissected
by the broad, shallow valleys of the headwaters of the aforementioned 3 stream channels.
Elevations across the project area range from about 201 to 210 m (660 to 690 ft) amsl,
generally sloping downward from west to east in the direction of predominant overland and
stream channel flow.

2.2

GEOLOGY AND GEOMORPHOLOGY

Two geological formations underlie the approximately 19.5-km- (12.1-mi-) long APE of
the proposed FM 1660 realignment project (Barnes 1974). The vast majority of the project area
is underlain by Pleistocene fluviatile, high-gravel terrace deposits (Qhg), which consist of mature
alluvial terrace deposits near streams composed of gravel, sand, silt, and clay in various
proportions with abundant gravels in the older, higher terraces, such as those that characterize
the current project area . The valleys of Mustang Creek and South Fork of Mustang Creek are
underlain by the Upper Cretaceous Ozan Formation (locally named the Sprinkle Formation or
the “lower Taylor marl”) (Ko). The Ozan Formation consists of calcareous, marly, light gray to
brown (weathering to light gray to grayish orange and white) clay that measures about 183 m
(600 ft) in thickness (Barnes 1974).
The project area is situated on the Branyon-Houston Black-Burleson soil association,
which is composed of deep, calcareous to non-calcareous, clayey soils that formed from clayey
alluvium and marine clays and shales on ancient stream terraces and uplands (Werchan and
Coker 1983). Specifically, the APE traverses a mosaic of specific soils that characterize the
Branyon-Houston Black-Burleson soil association, including Altoga silty clay loam, 3 to 5%
slopes, eroded (AgC2); Branyon clay, 0 to 1% slopes (BrA); Branyon clay, 1 to 3% slopes (BrB);
Burleson clay, 0 to 1% slopes (BuA); Houston Black clay, 1 to 3% slopes (HuB); Houston Black
clay, 3 to 5% slopes, eroded (HuC2); Krum silty clay, 1 to 3% slopes (KsB); Queeny clay loam,
1 to 5% slopes (QuC); and Tinn clay, occasionally flooded (Tn) (Werchan and Coker 1983).
The soils that characterize the APE are deep, poorly drained, clayey sediments that
largely formed prior to any human presence in North America and usually have minimal
potential to contain intact, subsurface archeological resources at any substantial depth. In
Central Texas, aboriginal cultural resources are relatively common on alluvial terraces adjacent
to prominent streams and springs and in upland settings typically associated with exposures of
gravel deposits containing Edwards Chert. Away from streams, clayey sediments are common
on and near the modern ground surface throughout Central Texas. While significant aboriginal
sites may occur at great depths adjacent to streams that contain deep Holocene-age alluvial

Farm-to-Market Road 1660 Realignment Project, Hutto, Williamson County, Texas

packages, intact aboriginal sites are rare in the uplands. Due to the relative antiquity of the
sediments in upland areas, combined with their shrink-swell characteristics and erosional
potential, intact aboriginal archeological resources are rare in the uplands. Where they do
occur, they tend to consist of surficial scatters of artifacts that lack depth and vertical or
horizontal integrity. Historic-age cultural resources may occur almost anywhere in this region
and tend to be visible on or near the modern ground surface.

2.3

CLIMATE

Evidence for climatic change from the Pleistocene to the present is most often obtained
through studies of pollen and faunal sequences (Bryant and Holloway 1985; Collins 1995).
Bryant and Holloway (1985) present a sequence of climatic change for nearby east-central
Texas from the Wisconsin Full Glacial period (22,500 to 14,000 B.P.) through the Late Glacial
period (14,000 to 10,000 B.P.) to the Post-Glacial period (10,000 B.P. to present). Evidence
from the Wisconsin Full Glacial period suggests that the climate in east-central Texas was
considerably cooler and more humid than at present. Pollen data indicate that the region was
more heavily forested in deciduous woodlands than during later periods (Bryant and Holloway
1985). The Late Glacial period was characterized by slow climatic deterioration and a slow
warming and/or drying trend (Collins 1995). In east-central Texas, the deciduous woodlands
were gradually replaced by grasslands and post oak savannas (Bryant and Holloway 1985).
During the Post-Glacial period, the east-central Texas environment appears to have been more
stable. The deciduous forests had long since been replaced by prairies and post oak savannas.
The drying and/or warming trend that began in the Late Glacial period continued into the midHolocene, at which point there appears to have been a brief amelioration to more mesic
conditions lasting from roughly 6,000 to 5,000 B.P. Recent studies by Bryant and Holloway
(1985) indicate that modern environmental conditions in east-central Texas were probably
achieved by 1,500 years ago.
Williamson County is located within the south-central climatic division. The modern
climate is typically dry to subhumid with long, hot summers and short, mild winters. The climate
is influenced primarily by tropical maritime air masses from the Gulf of Mexico, but it is modified
by polar air masses. Tropical maritime air masses predominate throughout spring, summer,
and fall. Modified polar air masses are dominant in winter and provide a continental climate
characterized by considerable variations in temperature.
On average throughout the past century, precipitation and temperature manifest regional
clines with mean annual precipitation totals declining fairly regularly from east to west and mean
annual temperature declining equally evenly from northwest to southeast (Larkin and Bomar
1983:18, 50). Climate has fluctuated from subtropical humid to subtropical subhumid in western
Williamson County. Average annual precipitation totals 81 centimeters (cm) (32 in) and
temperature averages 19°C (67°F) annually, ranging from 36°C (96°F) in August (the warmest
month) to 15°C (59°F) in January (the coldest month). During this time, however, drier periods
lasting from 3 to 7 years, when total annual rainfall ranged from 30 to 64 cm (12 to 25 in) were
followed by abnormally wet years with 114 to 127 cm (45 to 50 in) of rainfall.

HJN 090047 AR

11

Chapter 2.0: Environmental Setting

Two annual precipitation peaks, which typically occur in May and September, are
associated with frontal storms that form when southward-moving cool air masses collide with
warm, moist air masses moving inland from the Gulf of Mexico (Bomar 1983; Carr 1967). The
topographic discontinuity along the Balcones Escarpment lies directly in the path of the Gulf
storm trace and increases the lift in convective storms to produce extreme amounts of rainfall
(Baker 1975). Two extreme examples are the excess of 91 cm (36 in) of rain that fell within an
18-hour period in the vicinity of Thrall, Texas, in September 1921, and the 56-cm (22-inch [in])
deluge that fell in less than 3 hours near O’Harris, Texas, in May 1935 (Baker 1975). Lower
rainfall amounts are characteristic of winter and late summer. In winter, frontal storms pass so
frequently that there is little time for moisture to increase, and prevailing upper-level winds from
west to east often dominate over meridional flow, meaning that much of the available moisture
is derived from the Pacific rather than from the Gulf of Mexico. In summer, cool fronts rarely
penetrate into the region and rainfall occurs primarily as localized, thermal convective storms.

2.4

BIOTA

The project area is in the southwestern portion of the Texan biotic province (Blair 1950),
an intermediate zone between the forests of the Austroriparian and Carolinian provinces and the
grasslands of the Kansan, Balconian, and Tamaulipan provinces. Some species reach the
limits of their ecological range within the Texan province. The boundary, characterized as
“approximate,” between Blair’s (1950) Texan and Balconian provinces passes through western
Williamson County in the vicinity of the project area.
The fauna associated with this region are represented by a mixture of species from the
Austroriparian, Tamaulipan, Chihuahuan, Kansan, Balconian, and Texan biotic provinces.
Common mammalian species include white-tailed deer, opossum, eastern cottontail rabbit,
raccoon, striped skunk, hispid cotton rat, white-footed mouse, nine-banded armadillo, and fox
squirrel. Common bird species include northern bobwhite, eastern meadowlark, mourning dove,
killdeer, field sparrow, red-tailed hawk, turkey vulture, belted kingfisher, and mockingbird.
Reptile and amphibian species common to this biotic zone include six-lined racerunner, rat
snake, eastern hognose snake, Gulf Coast toad, Texas spiny lizard, rough green snake,
copperhead, western diamondback rattlesnake, green treefrog, Blanchard’s cricket frog,
diamondback water snake, Houston toad, and green anole. Although small herds of bison and
antelope were common during the late prehistoric and early historic periods, these species are
no longer native to this region (Jurney et al. 1989:13-14).

3.0 CULTURAL BACKGROUND

The project area is located within the Central Texas archeological region. The
indigenous human inhabitants of Central Texas practiced a generally nomadic hunting and
gathering lifestyle throughout all of prehistory, and, in contrast to much of the rest of North
America, mobility and settlement patterns do not appear to have changed markedly through
time in this region.

3.1

PALEOINDIAN PERIOD (9,200 TO 6,000 B.C.)

The initial human occupations in the New World can now be confidently extended back
before 10,000 B.C. (Dincauze 1984; Haynes et al. 1984; Kelly and Todd 1988; Lynch 1990;
Meltzer 1989). Evidence from Meadowcroft Rockshelter in Pennsylvania suggests that humans
were present in Eastern North America as early as 14,000 to 16,000 years ago (Adovasio et al.
1990), while more recent discoveries at Monte Verde in Chile provide unequivocal evidence for
human occupation in South America by at least 12,500 years ago (Dillehay 1989, 1997; Meltzer
et al. 1997). Most archeologists presently discount claims of much earlier human occupation
during the Pleistocene glacial period (cf. Butzer 1988).
The earliest generalized evidence for human activities in Central Texas is represented
by the PaleoIndian period (9,200 to 6,000 B.C.) (Black 1989). This stage coincided with
ameliorating climatic conditions following the close of the Pleistocene epoch that witnessed the
extinction of herds of mammoth, horse, camel, and bison. Cultures representing various
periods within this stage are characterized by series of distinctive, relatively large, often fluted,
lanceolate projectile points. These points are frequently associated with spurred end scrapers,
gravers, and bone foreshafts. PaleoIndian groups are often inferred to have been organized
into egalitarian bands consisting of a few dozen individuals that practiced a fully nomadic
subsistence and settlement pattern. Due to poor preservation of floral materials, subsistence
patterns in Central Texas are known primarily through the study of faunal remains. Subsistence
focused on the exploitation of plants, small animals, fish, and shellfish, even during the
PaleoIndian period. There is little evidence in this region for hunting of extinct megafauna, as
has been documented elsewhere in North America. Rather, a broad-based subsistence pattern
appears to have been practiced throughout all prehistoric time periods. In Central Texas, the
PaleoIndian stage is divided into 2 periods based on recognizable differences in projectile point
styles. These include the Early PaleoIndian Period, which is recognized based on large, fluted
projectile points (i.e., Clovis, Folsom, Dalton, San Patrice, and Big Sandy), and the Late

HJN 090047 AR

13

Chapter 3.0: Cultural Background

PaleoIndian period, which is characterized by unfluted lanceolate points (i.e., Plainview,
Scottsbluff, Meserve, and Angostura).

3.2

ARCHAIC PERIOD (6,000 B.C. TO A.D. 800)

The onset of the Hypsithermal drying trend marks the beginning of the Archaic stage
(6,000 B.C. to A.D. 800). This climatic trend marked the beginning of a significant reorientation
of lifestyle throughout most of North America, but this change was far less pronounced in
Central Texas. Elsewhere, the changing climatic conditions and corresponding decrease in the
big game populations forced people to rely more heavily upon a diversified resource base
composed of smaller game and wild plants. In Central Texas, however, this hunting and
gathering pattern is characteristic of most of prehistory. The appearance of a more diversified
tool kit, the development of an expanded groundstone assemblage, and a general decrease in
the size of projectile points are hallmarks of this cultural stage. Material culture shows greater
diversity during this broad cultural period, especially in the application of groundstone
technology.
Traditionally, the Archaic period is subdivided into Early, Middle, and Late subperiods.
In Central Texas, the Early Archaic subperiod extends from 6,000 to 3,000 B.C., the Middle
Archaic subperiod extends from 3,000 to 1,000 B.C., and the Late Archaic subperiod covers the
1,000 B.C. to A.D. 800 timeframe. Changes in projectile point morphology are often used as
markers differentiating these three subperiods, though other changes in material culture
occurred as well. Perhaps most markedly, burned rock middens appear during the Middle
Archaic subperiod, continuing into the Late Archaic subperiod, and large cemeteries appear
during the Late Archaic subperiod. In addition, the increasing density of prehistoric sites
through time is often considered to constitute evidence of population growth, though differential
preservation probably at least partially accounts for the lower numbers of older sites.

3.3

LATE PREHISTORIC PERIOD (A.D. 800 TO 1600)

The onset of the Late Prehistoric period (A.D. 800 to 1600) (Black 1989) is defined by
the appearance of the bow and arrow. In Central Texas, pottery also appears during the Late
Prehistoric period (though ceramics appear earlier in Southeast Texas). Use of the atlatl (i.e.,
spearthrower) and spear was generally discontinued during the Late Prehistoric period, though
they continued to be used in the inland subregion of Southeast Texas along with the bow and
arrow through the Late Prehistoric period (Patterson 1980, 1995; Wheat 1953). In Texas,
unifacial arrow points appear to be associated with a small prismatic blade technology. The
Late Prehistoric period is generally divided into 2 phases, the Austin and Toyah phases. Austin
phase sites occur earliest to the north, which has led some researchers (e.g., Prewitt 1985) to
suggest that the Austin phase populations of Central Texas were migrants from the north who
lacked the ceramic industry of the later Toyah phase.

3.4

HISTORIC PERIOD (A.D. 1600 TO PRESENT)

The first European incursion into what is now known as Texas was in 1519, when
Álvarez de Pineda explored the northern shores of the Gulf of Mexico. In 1528, Cabeza de

14

Farm-to-Market Road 1660 Realignment Project, Hutto, Williamson County, Texas

Vaca crossed South Texas after being shipwrecked along the Texas Coast near Galveston Bay.
However, European settlement did not seriously disrupt native ways of life until after 1700. The
first half of the eighteenth century was the period in which the fur trade and mission system, as
well as the first effects of epidemic diseases, began to seriously disrupt the native culture and
social systems. This process is clearly discernable at the Mitchell Ridge site, where burial data
suggest population declines and group mergers (Ricklis 1994), as well as increased
participation on the part of the Native American population in the fur trade. By the time that
heavy settlement of Texas began in the early 1800s by Anglo-Americans, the indigenous Indian
population was greatly diminished.
The earliest known historical occupants of Williamson County were the Tonkawa
Indians. 4 The Tonkawa traditionally followed buffalo herds on foot and periodically set fire to the
prairie to aid them in their hunts. During the 18th century, however, they made the transition to
a horse-based culture and used firearms to a limited extent. Decimated by European diseases
and by warfare with the Cherokee and Comanche, the Tonkawa were generally friendly toward
the early settlers of Williamson County but were nevertheless removed from Central Texas by
the 1850s. Lipan Apaches and Comanches were also associated with the area that would
become Williamson County. Before the arrival of Europeans in the area, the Lipan Apaches
ranged through the western part of present Williamson County, and, after Spanish missions
were established on the San Gabriel River in the 18th century, the Indians frequently raided the
missions for horses. Their enemies, the Comanches, arrived in the area in the 18th century and
lived in parts of the territory of Williamson County until as late as 1838. After they were crowded
out by Anglo settlers, the Comanches continued to raid settlements in the county until the
1860s. There also appear to have been small numbers of Kiowa, Yojuane, Tawakoni, and
Mayeye Indians living in the county at the time of the earliest Anglo settlements.
While Álvar Núñez Cabeza de Vaca may have traveled through the area in the 16th
century, it was probably first explored by Europeans in the late 17th century, when Capt. Alonso
De León sought a route between San Antonio and the Spanish missions in East Texas that
would serve as a drier alternative to the more southerly Camino Real. The new route passed
through the area of Williamson County along Brushy Creek and the San Gabriel River and was
called Camino de Arriba. In 1716, 2 explorers in the Spanish service, Louis Juchereau de St.
Denis and Domingo Ramón, led an expedition that passed through the area and camped on
Brushy Creek and the San Gabriel River, naming them respectively Arroyo de las Bendítas
Ánimas and Rio de San Xavier. The San Xavier missions, which were founded in the mid-18th
century and occupied a series of sites along the San Gabriel River, were just across the eastern
border of Williamson County in present-day Milam County, and the area was extensively
explored by the Spanish. During the Mexican period, parts of the county were awarded as land
grants, first to several Mexican families, then as part of Robertson’s colony, but no settlement
resulted from these grants.

Much of the following discussion of Williamson County history derives from Makemson (1904),
Scarbrough (1973), and the Texas State Historical Association (2011).

Chapter 3.0: Cultural Background

Anglo settlement began during the Texas Revolution and the early days of the Republic
of Texas, when the area was part of Milam County. In 1835, in an attempt to strengthen the
frontier against Indian attack, a military post was built near the headwaters of Brushy Creek in
what would become southwestern Williamson County and was named for Capt. John J.
Tumlinson, Jr., the commander of the company of Texas Rangers who garrisoned the post.
The post was abandoned in February of 1836, when its garrison was withdrawn to deal with the
Mexican invasion. In 1838, the first civilian settlement was established by Dr. Thomas Kenney
and a party of settlers who built a fort, named Kenney’s Fort, on Brushy Creek near the site of
the present-day crossing of the Missouri-Kansas-Texas Railroad. Several other sites on Brushy
Creek were settled soon after, but Indian raids kept Anglo settlement in check, and a number of
the early pioneers, including Kenney, were killed by Indians over the next few years.
In 1842, many of the early farms were abandoned when Governor Sam Houston advised
settlers to pull back from the frontier. The Indian threat eased after 1846, and part of the influx
of settlers who came to Texas after its annexation traveled to the frontier along Brushy Creek
and the San Gabriel River. By 1848, there were at least 250 settlers in what was then western
Milam County, and in the early months of that year 107 of them signed a petition to organize a
new county. Recognizing that the petitioners needed a seat of local government that was
considerably closer to them than Milam County, the Texas legislature established Williamson
County on 13 March 1848, naming it for prominent judge and soldier Robert M. Williamson.
Georgetown, the county seat, was laid out during the summer of that year, and the district court
was in session by October. According to the census of 1850, Williamson County had a
population of 1,379 Anglos and 155 slaves living in agricultural communities on Brushy Creek
and the San Gabriel. As was common in other frontier counties, most of the improved acreage
was used to grow corn. Three families owned 15 or more slaves in 1850, but family farms and
subsistence agriculture remained the norm prior to the Civil War. While most of the settlers had
moved to Texas from other southern states, particularly Tennessee, a substantial contingent
came from Vermilion County, Illinois, and this latter group remained pro-Union and Republican
in its political orientation during the secession crisis.
On the eve of the Civil War, Williamson County had moved beyond the frontier stage
and was a populous, agriculturally diverse county. The Anglo population tripled between 1850
and 1860 to 3,638, while the slave population grew even more dramatically to 891, six times the
number of slaves in 1850. Agricultural pursuits were quite varied and reflected the county’s
geographical diversity. Farmers used the rich blackland soils in the eastern half of the county to
grow wheat and corn. Cotton was introduced in the 1850s, but only 271 bales were grown in
1860, and it was not an important cash crop for most farmers. The early settlers had found
large herds of wild cattle in the 1840s, and cattle ranching for both home consumption and the
market was widespread throughout the county by 1860. The number of cattle on county
ranches had more than tripled from 11,973 head in 1850 to 38,114 head in 1860. Similarly, the
number of sheep grew from 2,937 producing 3,499 pounds of wool in 1850 to 16,952 sheep and
32,994 pounds of wool in 1860.
Williamson County was marked by political divisions during the secession crisis,
divisions that were carried over into the Civil War and Reconstruction. Unionist sentiment was

16

strong in the county, and a resolution denouncing secession was adopted by a Texas
Constitutional Union party meeting in Round Rock in 1860. One of the county’s delegates to the
secession convention, Thomas Proctor Hughes, was among the 8 who voted against the
ordinance of secession. When the ordinance was referred to a statewide election, Williamson
County was one of 19 counties to oppose it, rejecting secession by 480 to 349 votes. When the
war came, most of the citizens of Williamson County supported the Confederate cause, and at
least 5 companies were raised in the county; an independent “spy” company under James O.
Rice, a company of Texas Rangers for border defense under William C. Dalrymple, and
companies in the Fourth, Seventh, and Sixteenth Texas Cavalry regiments. While some of
those who had opposed secession became active Confederate supporters, others remained
loyal to the Union and fled to Mexico or the North, and a number enlisted in the Union army. In
July 1863, 8 Williamson County men were caught by Confederate troops while traveling to
Mexico and were hanged near Bandera, Texas, and other Unionists were persecuted during the
war. The pattern of violence within the community continued into the summer following the end
of the war, when several men were arrested for “flagrant crimes” and “illegal persecution of
Union men.” In September 1865, a mass meeting of the citizens of Williamson County was held
on the San Gabriel River near Georgetown, and the gathering set a general tone of
reconciliation, which seems to have characterized the Reconstruction period in Williamson
County, a period that ended with the return of county government to conservative Democratic
control in 1869. Freed slaves formed several new communities, and the county seems to have
been free of much of the political and racial strife that occurred in other Texas counties during
Reconstruction. On the other hand, there was a great deal of crime, much of it violent, in the
latter 19th century. Horse and cattle thieves and some of the more famous outlaws of the day,
such as Sam Bass and John Wesley Hardin, preyed on the property of citizens, and long-term
family feuds and drunken brawls at the various saloons in the towns added to the toll of
homicides.
Though the Civil War had caused little material damage in the area, the county was a
much poorer place in 1870 than it had been in 1860. The total value of farms had fallen from
$833,418 to $389,239 and the value of livestock from $823,653 to $341,794. The economic
recovery in the 1870s was aided by the growth of the cattle and sheep industries and a dramatic
expansion of cotton farming. Various feeder routes to the Chisholm Trail passed through
Williamson County, and many cattle drives passed through or originated in the county from the
1860s through the early 1880s. With the coming of the railroads to the county in the 1870s,
Taylor, in the eastern part of the county, became an important rail center for the cattle trade.
Cattle-raising, after declining somewhat in importance in the early 20th century, was again a
major part of the agricultural economy by 1950, and in 1969 ranchers owned a record
65,093 cattle. Sheep- and goat-raising followed a similar pattern. Sheep ranching recovered its
pre-war level by 1880 and peaked at 39,961 sheep and 171,752 pounds of wool in 1890, then
declined in the late 19th and early 20th centuries to 13,397 sheep and 39,458 pounds in 1920.
The industry revived in the 1930s and reached a new high of 59,919 sheep and 336,494 pounds
of wool in 1959. Mohair became a significant agricultural product by 1930 and reached a peak
in 1959, when 44,668 goats produced 209,098 pounds of mohair. Cotton, the second boom
industry in Williamson County, developed at about the same time as the cattle industry. As

Chapter 3.0: Cultural Background

early as 1869, the editor of the Georgetown Watchman was advising farmers to “make cotton,
but do not, by any means, neglect the grain crop-diversity.” Cotton production, which had been
insignificant before the war, rose to successive heights of 4,217 bales in 1880, 33,945 bales in
1890, and 80,514 bales in 1900. In 1900 to 1901, Williamson County ginned more cotton than
any county in Texas except Ellis County. The number of improved acres increased almost
tenfold from 1870 to 1880 and doubled again to 306,881 acres by 1890. The proportion of
cropland used for cotton production moved from about one-third of the total in 1880 to a high of
77% in 1910, and cotton was grown on 73% of the cropland as late as 1930. Dramatic changes
in land tenure attended the shift to cotton production. As late as 1880, 1,183 of the 1,538 farms,
or 77%, were still worked by owners. By 1890, only 43% of the farms were operated by owners,
and the percentage of owner-operators remained at 40% until the 1920s, when it dropped still
further to 29% in 1930. Farm tenancy rates began to decline during the Great Depression with
the shift away from cotton and other staple crops and by 1959 had dropped to 36% of the
county’s farmers.
Both the cattle and the cotton booms were aided by the improved communications
available in the county in the later 19th century. The International-Great Northern Railroad,
which later was consolidated with the Missouri Pacific, was built across the eastern part of the
county in 1876 and led to the founding of Taylor (now Williamson County’s third largest city) and
Hutto and to the relocation of Round Rock. It also opened up large areas in eastern Williamson
County to commercial farming. The Taylor, Bastrop, and Houston Railway, which was
eventually consolidated with the Missouri, Kansas, and Texas Railway, was built in the 1880s
and aided in the development of Taylor, Granger, and Bartlett. Roads were generally poor
throughout the county in the early 20th century. There were 11,882 automobiles in the county
by 1930, and extensive improvements, including blacktopping, of all major roads took place in
the 1930s.
The county also became more ethnically diverse in the later 19th and early 20th
centuries. While there were only 111 inhabitants of foreign birth out of a population of 6,368 in
Williamson County in 1870, significant numbers of Scandinavians, Germans, Czechs, Wends,
and Austrians moved to the county in the 1880s and 1890s. The proportion of foreign-born in
the county population remained at about 10% from 1890 to the 1930s. Mexican immigration
reached a significant level by about 1910, just as Europeans stopped arriving in the county.
There were 294 Hispanics in 1900, 732 in 1910, and 4,967, or 11% of the population, in 1930.
In 1980, 9,693 residents, or again 11%, were of Hispanic origin. The immigrants added their
distinctive customs and architectural styles to the mix of county life and introduced new religious
denominations. By the time of the Civil War, Williamson County had a number of Baptist and
Methodist churches and several different factions of the Presbyterian Church. Churches of
other denominations were built after the war, and the new emigrants established Lutheran,
Catholic, and Czech Moravian congregations. By 1930, Williamson County had a culturally
diverse population of 44,146 inhabitants. The economy was still overwhelmingly agricultural;
only 29 manufacturing establishments employed 347 workers that year.
While cotton
production was near its peak in terms of percentage of cropland, the cotton industry was already
undergoing a rapid transformation.

The combined effects of soil depletion, overproduction, and the influx of the boll weevil
had already injured the profitability of the industry by the late 1920s, and the situation of cotton
growers was further worsened by the depression. The black population seems to have been
particularly hard hit by the depression. Of the 944 county families on relief in 1933, 442, almost
one-half, were black, though blacks constituted only 16% of the population. Various federal
relief programs benefited farmers with farm loans and subsidies, and in 1936 a total of $204,000
in subsidy checks was issued. The Depression encouraged diversification among farmers and
a shift away from staple crops to livestock. Between 1930 and 1940, the number of acres used
for cotton-growing fell by almost one-half, and cotton production went from 68,266 to 36,890
bales. Cropland acreage used for corn production increased over the same period by about
one-half, and wool and mohair production more than doubled to 342,983 and 102,517 pounds,
respectively. While cotton continued to be an important crop in eastern Williamson County,
farmers increasingly turned to other crops like sorghum and wheat and to livestock-raising in the
latter 20th century. Along with such traditional livestock as sheep and cattle, poultry farming
played a significant role in the economy by 1950, when the county was fifth in the state in the
production of eggs and chickens. In 1980, it was 10th in the state in the production of turkeys.
The agricultural diversification of the middle decades of the 20th century was followed by
significant social and economic changes in the 1960s, 1970s, and 1980s. The black population,
which had remained at between 15 and 18% of the total in the early and mid-20th century,
began to decline, both proportionately and in real numbers, from the 1940s on and had fallen to
4,111, or about 5%, by 1980. As in other areas of Texas, blacks were relegated to segregated
and inferior housing and educational facilities until the 1960s, when some improvements were
brought about by federal desegregation policies. Along with changes in racial composition,
Williamson County experienced a dramatic increase in population during this period, growing
from 37,305 inhabitants in 1970 to an estimated 85,700 inhabitants in 1982, making it 34th in
population growth among counties in the US in the 1970s.

4.0 RESEARCH OBJECTIVES AND METHODOLOGY

The archeological survey described in this report was undertaken with 3 primary
research goals in mind:
1. To locate and record archeological resources occurring within the designated project
area
2. To provide a preliminary assessment of the significance of these resources regarding
their potential for inclusion in the NRHP and for designation as SALs
3. To make recommendations for the treatment of these resources based on their
National Register of Historic Places (NRHP) and State Archeological Landmark
(SAL) assessments
The first of these goals was accomplished by means of a review of documentation on file
at the Texas Historical Commission’s (THC) online Texas Archeological Sites Atlas (Atlas), the
National Park Service’s (NPS) online National Register Information System (NRIS), the Texas
State Historical Association’s (TSHA) online Handbook of Texas History, as well as a program
of intensive pedestrian survey. The assessment of significance, evaluation of NRHP and SAL
eligibility, and recommendations concerning the treatment options for the archeological
resources recorded during this project are presented in Chapter 5.0, Results of Investigations,
and Chapter 6.0, Summary and Recommendations. The rest of this chapter presents the
results of archival research, the methodological background for the current investigations, and
the specific survey methods used in the field.

4.1

ARCHIVAL RESEARCH

Prior to initiating fieldwork, Horizon personnel reviewed existing information on the
THC’s online Atlas for information on previously recorded archeological sites and previous
archeological investigations conducted within a 1.6-km (1.0-mi) radius of the project area.
Based on this archival research, 3 known cultural resource sites are located within a 1.6-km
(1.0-mi) radius of the proposed project area ROW (Figures 5 to 6). Short segments of the
project area were previously surveyed for cultural resources during a cultural resources survey
conducted by HDR Engineering, Inc. (HDR), of an earlier proposed ROW for the FM 1660
project (Schroeder 2006); however, the project design has changed considerably since then,
and the majority of the current project area has not been previously surveyed.

Chapter 4.0: Research Objectives and Methodology

The first of the known cultural resources is the Monadale Cemetery, a small, late-19thto early 20th-century Hispanic cemetery located just east of the intersection of the existing
FM 1660 ROW and CR 133 near the northern end of the project area (see Figure 5). This
cemetery is located just north of the community of Monadale shown on the US Geological
Survey (USGS) Hutto, Texas, topographic quadrangle, though the actual community of
Monadale no longer exists. A historical marker erected just south of the intersection of FM 1660
and CR 133 reads as follows:
Monodale Community—When Texas was readmitted to the Union in 1870, the land in
this area was owned by three families, including that of nationally known political
statesman Edward Mandell House. Known as Stringtown, the area was so well
populated by 1893 that House donated an acre of land for a school. Settlers pooled their
funds for a building, naming the school and community Monadale in honor of House’s
daughter. A clerical error led to the common spelling Monodale. The people of
Monodale Community were cotton farmers, chiefly Swedish and Czechoslovakian
immigrants. The Monodale School District served the areas’ children until it was
consolidated with Hutto in 1949.

According to current project design, the proposed project area passes just east of the Monadale
Cemetery, though the cemetery would be surrounded by proposed new ROW associated with
the current undertaking to the north, east, and south.
The second site, 41WM1134, was mapped a short distance south of the Monadale
Cemetery just east of the intersection of FM 1660 and CR 133 on a Pleistocene-age terrace
above the southern bank of Mustang Creek (see Figure 5). Originally recorded in 2005 during a
cultural resource survey performed for a prior phase of the FM 1660 realignment project, site
41WM1134 was described as a multiple-component site consisting of a surface scatter of
historic-age and aboriginal artifacts (Schroeder 2006). Historic artifacts included glass shards,
predominantly purple and clear glass; a fragment of a cast iron cooking pot; and ceramic
sherds, including whiteware, opaque milk glass, and a stoneware sherd, suggesting an
occupation in the early to mid-20th century. The site was recorded on a 1-ac tract of land, and
no structural remains associated with the historic-age occupation were observed within the
surveyed area. Aboriginal artifacts included several tested chert cobbles, 2 bifaces, and several
pieces of lithic debitage. The aboriginal component of the site appeared to represent an
aboriginal campsite and/or raw material procurement area (i.e., “quarry”) occupied at an
unknown time in the aboriginal (presumably prehistoric) past. Based on the mapped location of
the site, it appeared to be located within or immediately adjacent to the proposed ROW of the
FM 1660 realignment. During the current survey for the FM 1660 realignment project,
archeological materials associated with site 41WM1134 were observed within the APE, and the
boundaries of this site were expanded into the current project area beyond those that were
recorded by the original investigators.
The third site, 41WM767, is mapped off the north side of State Highway (SH) 79 on the
southern terrace of the South Fork of Mustang Creek (see Figure 6). While site 41WM767 has
been issued a permanent trinomial by the Texas Archeological Research Laboratory (TARL),
the Atlas does not contain any information about this site aside from its location. Based on the

24

090047_arch_survey_report

Farm-to-Market Road 1660 Realignment Project, Hutto, Williamson County, Texas

mapped location of the site, it is located beyond the edge of any project-related impacts north of
the existing SH 79 ROW. At the time the current survey was conducted, road construction
associated with another project was underway on the north side of SH 79, and no traces of site
41WM767 were observed in the APE.

4.2

ARCHEOLOGICAL SURVEY METHODS

The APE of the proposed undertaking consists of the entire 19.5-km- (12.1-mi-)
proposed corridor. The proposed FM 1660 realignment ROW would average approximately
61 m (200 ft) in width along its approximately 19.5-km- (12.1-mi-) long route, covering a total
area of roughly 131 ha (323 ac). The project area consists of a mix of existing (publicly owned)
road ROWs as well as proposed (privately owned) new ROW, including approximately 38 ha
(95 ac; 29%) of existing road ROWs and 93 ha (228 ac; 71%) of proposed new ROW. Horizon
performed an intensive archeological survey of the APE between November 30 and
December 3, 2010. Horizon archeologist Michael Mudd served as project archeologist;
Rosemarie Pavel and Jared Wiersema served as archeological field technicians; and Jeffrey D.
Owens served as Principal Investigator.
During the intensive archeological survey, the approximately 19.5-km- (12.1-mi-) long by
61-m- (200-ft-) wide APE was traversed on foot by Horizon’s archeologists in parallel, linear
transects spaced no more than 30 m (100 ft) apart, and the modern ground surface was
thoroughly inspected for aboriginal and historic-age cultural resources. For linear projects, the
Texas State Minimum Archeological Survey Standards (TSMASS) require a minimum of
16 subsurface probes per mile of 100-ft width of ROW; thus, a minimum of approximately
387 subsurface probes would be required for the current project. Horizon excavated a total of
328 shovel tests during the survey; thus, the TSMASS requirements were not quite met for a
project area of this length and width (Figures 7 to 9).
Approximately 29% of the APE consisted of existing road ROWs that had experienced
extensive prior impacts from construction, use, and ongoing maintenance of the transportation
facilities, many of which had experienced additional impacts from installation of various
overhead and subsurface utility lines and intersecting driveways (Figures 10 to 11). Judgmental
shovel testing was conducted within these disturbed existing road ROWs to confirm the
apparent extent of prior impacts inferred via visible surface conditions, but shovel testing within
existing road ROWs was not as extensive as within areas of proposed new ROW, which had
experienced relatively fewer prior impacts from construction. Of the total of 328 shovel tests
excavated during the survey, 64 shovel tests (20%) were excavated in areas of existing (publicly
owned) ROW and 264 shovel tests (80%) were excavated in areas of proposed new (privately
owned) ROW.
Furthermore, 1 segment of proposed new ROW extending northwest of Little Mustang
Creek could not be accessed during the survey due to the refusal of the landowner to provide
access. This segment of proposed new ROW measures approximately 1.0 km (0.6 mi) in length
and represents the only segment of the APE that was not surveyed during the current effort.
This unsurveyed segment, which represents approximately 5% of the total APE, consists of an

open, plowed agricultural field, and this area was casually inspected from within the adjacent
areas of the APE to which access was available during the survey. The unsurveyed area
appeared to be identical to neighboring areas in which no archeological materials were
observed, consisting of mature Blackland Prairie soils under active cultivation (Figure 12). In
the event that any unrecorded archeological materials are present in the unsurveyed portion of
the APE, it is likely that they would occur in disturbed, eroded, surficial contexts and lack depth
or integrity. It is Horizon’s opinion that no intact archeological deposits occur in the short
segment of the APE that was not accessible for survey.
The vast majority of the areas of proposed new ROW in the APE consist of open,
plowed agricultural fields that are under active cultivation (Figure 13); however, as the survey
was conducted in winter, the fields were not planted and ground surface visibility was 100% in
most areas. While the headwaters of 3 minor streams (Mustang Creek, South Fork of Mustang
Creek, and Little Mustang Creek), cross the APE, 2 of these streams (South Fork of Mustang
Creek and Little Mustang Creek) are little more than erosional divots in the landscape, and
Mustang Creek has been extensively channelized (Figure 14). Soils in the APE consist of
mature Blackland Prairie sediments derived from Pleistocene-age fluviatile terrace deposits and
Upper Cretaceous-age marl formations, and no Holocene-age alluvial sediments are present in
the APE. Based on the geomorphological characteristics of the landforms traversed by the
APE, any archeological materials would be expected to be restricted to surficial contexts that
have experienced moderate to extensive disturbance via plowing and erosion. As such, the
APE as a whole, including both areas of existing and proposed new ROW, possesses low
potential to contain intact archeological deposits. Taking into consideration the extent of prior
impacts within existing road ROWs and the short segment of proposed new ROW that was not
accessible during the survey, as well as the geomorphological characteristics of the areas of
proposed new ROW, it is Horizon’s opinion that the density and coverage of shovel tests
excavated during the survey was more than adequate for identifying archeological materials
within the APE.
Shovel tests were excavated at average intervals of approximately 100 m (328 ft) along
each transect, though shovel tests were clustered more tightly in some areas. Shovel tests
measured 30 cm in diameter and were excavated to a target depth of 1.0 m (3.3 ft) below
surface, to the top of pre-Holocene deposits, or to the maximum depth practicable. In practice,
shovel tests were terminated prematurely due to the presence of near-surface deposits of
compact, nearly impenetrable, very gravelly clay sediments associated with the Pleistoceneand Upper Cretaceous-age soils that characterize the APE. All sediments were screened
through 6.35-millimeter (mm) (0.25-in) hardware cloth. Specific shovel test data for all
328 shovel tests excavated within the APE are summarized in Appendix A.
The TSMASS also require backhoe trenching in stream terraces and other areas with
the potential to contain buried archeological materials at depths below those that shovel tests
are capable of reaching (approximately 1.0 m [3.3 ft] below surface). The project area is located
predominantly in an upland setting with deep clayey and marly soils that formed during the
Pleistocene- and Upper Cretaceous ages prior to the arrival of humans in the New World. While

the project corridor traverses the headwaters of 3 minor tributaries of larger streams, the
streams present within the APE are mainly erosional channels being cut into the surrounding
upland sediments, and no alluvial packages were observed in the field or mapped on geological
maps of the area that may have the potential to contain intact archeological resources at depth.
Shovel testing therefore constituted an adequate survey technique for identifying archeological
resources within the project area. No settings conducive to preservation of deeply buried
archeological deposits are present in the project area, and mechanical trenching was
consequently not employed as a site-prospecting technique. It should be noted that 7 backhoe
trenches were excavated in connection with mechanical scraping and trenching operations
conducted within the APE in the vicinity of the Monadale Cemetery to prospect for unmarked
graves within the APE (see below). No archeological resources were observed during trenching
operations, and soil profiles observed in the trenches consisted of Pleistocene-age terrace
deposits underlying a modern plowzone. Backhoe trench data are presented in Appendix B.
One archeological site, 41WM1134, was documented within the APE as a result of the
intensive archeological survey. Site 41WM1134 was originally recorded by HDR in 2005 during
a prior archeological survey performed for an earlier proposed ROW of the FM 1660 relocation
project (Schroeder 2006). The site boundaries delineated by HDR were constrained to a 1-ac
parcel of land located along the eastern edge of the current project corridor. During Horizon’s
survey, the boundaries of site 41WM1134 were expanded into the current project area on a tract
of privately owned land within the proposed new ROW (no portions of the site were documented

32

Farm-to-Market Road 1660 Realignment Project, Hutto, Williamson County, Texas

within areas of existing publicly owned ROW). Site 41WM1134 is a multiple-component site
consisting of a low-density, surficial scatter of aboriginal lithic artifacts, including tested chert
cobbles, large decortication flakes, and lithic cores and debitage, as well as historic-age debris,
including bottle glass, whiteware ceramic sherds, and a few brick fragments. Cultural materials
are scattered across a plowed agricultural field that also contains an abundance of naturally
occurring, chert-bearing cobbles.
Horizon excavated 8 shovel tests on the portion of site 41WM1134 that occurs within the
current project’s APE (on private land), thereby meeting the TSMASS site recording standards
(which require a minimum of 6 shovel tests on a site), to determine the nature and extent of any
subsurface archeological deposits. No archeological materials were observed in any of the
8 shovel tests, though some shallow subsurface archeological materials may be presumed to
exist in disturbed contexts within the active plowzone that characterizes the agricultural field on
which the site occurs. A standard site recording form was used to record pertinent information
on location, physiographic setting, and local environmental characteristics; types and quantities
of artifacts observed; distribution and densities of artifacts; artificial and natural impacts; and the
condition of surface and any subsurface archeological deposits. A scaled sketch map was
drawn that illustrates site boundaries; locations of shovel tests, cultural features, and/or material
concentrations; as well as notable features of the landscape. The site was thoroughly photodocumented using color digital photography, and a photographic log was maintained of all
photographs taken. As the archeological materials observed in the current project’s APE were
consistent with those observed on the nearby mapped location of site 41WM1134, the decision
was made to extend the boundaries of the previously recorded site to incorporate the
archeological materials observed during the current survey. Based on the information recorded
on the standard archeological site recording forms in the field, an updated Texas Archeological
Data Site Form was completed by Horizon’s laboratory personnel using the most current version
of TARL’s TexSite archeological data collection software, and the form was submitted to TARL.
This archeological survey employed a non-collection policy for archeological materials.
Diagnostic artifacts (e.g., projectile points, ceramics, historic materials with maker’s marks) and
non-diagnostic artifacts (e.g., lithic debitage, burned rock, historic glass, and metal scrap) were
described, sketched, and/or photo-documented in the field and replaced in the same location in
which they were found. No archeological materials were collected during the current project,
and all archeological materials observed on site 41WM1134 were left in place.
The survey methods employed during the survey represented a “reasonable and goodfaith effort” to locate significant archeological sites within the project area as defined in 36 Code
of Federal Regulations (CFR) 800.3.

4.3

MONADALE CEMETERY MECHANICAL SCRAPING OPERATIONS

Subsequent to completion of the intensive archeological survey, at the direction of the
THC and TxDOT, Horizon performed mechanical scraping operations within an area of
proposed new ROW in the vicinity of the Monadale Cemetery, a small, late-19th- to early-20thcentury Hispanic cemetery located near the northern end of the proposed project area. The
marked boundaries of this small cemetery are located outside of the proposed project area;

HJN 090047 AR

33

Chapter 4.0: Research Objectives and Methodology

however, the western edge of the proposed new ROW in this area approaches to within 23 m
(75 ft) of the cemetery fence line, and current THC guidelines require that any portions of a
proposed project’s APE that fall within 23 m (75 ft) of marked cemetery boundaries need to be
assessed for unmarked graves. Between January 25 and 28, 2011, Horizon conducted
mechanical scraping operations and backhoe trenching along the edge of the proposed new
ROW facing the cemetery to determine whether or not any unmarked graves were present
within the APE (Figures 15 to 16). Jeffrey D. Owens supervised the mechanical scraping
operations; Michael Mudd served as an archeological field assistant; and Jared Wiersema
operated the backhoe. In connection with the mechanical scraping operations, approximately
70 man-hours were expended conducting the fieldwork. Time spent processing field data and
writing the draft technical report have been combined into the labor estimates presented above.
The Monadale Cemetery contains 3 graves marked by headstones as well as up to
8 unmarked graves suggested by the presence of several metal grave markers stacked against
a tree by the entrance on the west side of the cemetery. The boundaries of the cemetery are
marked by a continuous woven-wire fence, and the marked boundaries of the cemetery
measure approximately 24 m (80 ft) east to west by 18 m (60 ft) north to south. The cemetery
itself does not fall within the current project area; however, areas of proposed new ROW pass
within 23 m (75 ft) of the marked cemetery boundaries, and current THC guidelines require that
any portions of a proposed project’s APE that fall within 23 m (75 ft) of marked cemetery
boundaries need to be assessed for unmarked graves. During consultation with TxDOT and the
THC, it was determined that scraping operations would begin with a 5-m- (15-ft-) wide scrape
along the edge of the proposed ROW facing the cemetery within any areas of the proposed
ROW that fall within the 23-m (75-ft) buffer zone. If no evidence of unmarked graves was
encountered in the initial 5-m- (15-ft-) wide scrape, then it would not be necessary to continue
scraping outward. However, if any unmarked graves were encountered, scraping would
continue expanding outward in 5-m (15-ft) wide bands until no further unmarked graves were
present.
Specifically, the edge of the proposed ROW is located 21 m (70 ft) north of the northern
cemetery boundary, 6 m (20 ft) east of the eastern cemetery boundary, and 11 m (35 ft) south of
the southern cemetery boundary (Figures 15 to 16). Thus, technically, the scrape along the
edge of the proposed ROW north of the cemetery only needed to be 1.5 m (5.0 ft) wide;
however, it was technically infeasible to excavate such a narrow scrape, so the entire 5-m (15ft) width was excavated along the northern boundary. One continuous 3-m- (15-ft-) wide
scrape, measuring approximately 111 m (365 ft) in length and covering an area of roughly
604 m2 (6,500 ft2), was excavated along the edge of the proposed new ROW to the north, east,
and south of the Monadale Cemetery (Figures 15 to 16).
Prior to the initiation of mechanical scraping, HNTB’s surveyors marked the western
boundary of the proposed new ROW associated with the FM 1660 realignment project so that
Horizon’s archeologists would have a clear project boundary from which to work (Figures 17
to 18). The proposed new ROW in the vicinity of the cemetery consists of an active agricultural
field that had been plowed but not yet planted for the season. The modern plowzone was
removed along a 5-m- (15-ft-) wide scrape extending along the edge of the proposed new ROW

facing the cemetery, and the upper interface of underlying natural soils was carefully observed
for any evidence of grave shafts, burial furniture, coffin hardware, human bone, or other
indications of unmarked graves. Scraping operations were initiated at the northwestern end of
the proposed scrape area and proceeded eastward across the northern boundary, southward
along the eastern boundary, and then westward along the southern boundary. Initially, an
attempt was made to remove the plowzone with the front-end loader on the backhoe. While this
was feasible along the northern edge of the scrape, where the plowzone measured only
approximately 33 cm (13 in) deep (Figures 19 to 20), it proved impossible along the eastern and
southern segments, where it was necessary to excavate through 3 elevated farming terraces in
which the plowzone extended to depths of 89 cm (35 in). Due to the extremely dense nature of
the black, very gravelly clay sediments that compose the plowzone in this locale, especially in
areas where the plowzone was deeper, it was necessary to use the boom of the backhoe,
equipped with a 2-ft-wide, smooth-edged bucket, to remove the plowzone (Figures 21 to 22).
The goal was to expose the natural soil horizon underlying the plowzone so that the
upper interface of the underlying natural soils could be inspected for evidence of unmarked
graves. The soils underlying the plowzone were determined to be weathered, natural alluvial
sediments deposited during the Pleistocene era (Figures 23 to 24). No evidence of grave
shafts, burial furniture, coffin hardware, human bone, or other indications of unmarked graves
were observed within the APE as a result of the scraping operations. Soils removed via
scraping operations were replaced at the end of each day of fieldwork.
In addition, at the direction of the THC and TxDOT, 7 backhoe trenches were excavated
to depths of 1.8 to 2.3 m (5.9 to 7.5 ft) below surface at approximately 15-m (50-ft) intervals
along the edge of the scraped area to verify that the soils observed within the scraped area
were, in fact, natural soils (as opposed to artificial fill) that are conducive to observing unmarked
grave shafts (if present) (Figure 25; also see Figure 16). The soils underlying the plowzone
consist of deep, weathered deposits of interbedded orange-brown clay and white marly clay that
are consistent with the published descriptions of Pleistocene-age alluvial terrace soils mapped
in this area (Barnes 1974; Werchan and Coker 1983). Thus, the sediments underlying the
black, very gravelly clay plowzone in the scraped areas surrounding the Monadale Cemetery
are natural alluvial sediments deposited during the Pleistocene era. No artificial fill or other
disturbances that would mask the observable presence of unmarked graves were observed,
and no unmarked graves were detected within the APE as a result of the scraping operations.
Backhoe trench data are presented in Appendix B.

5.0 RESULTS OF INVESTIGATIONS

The intensive archeological survey conducted for the proposed FM 1660 realignment
project resulted in the documentation of a previously unknown portion of a previously recorded
archeological site, 41WM1134. This chapter describes this archeological site, makes a
preliminary assessment of the eligibility of the site for inclusion in the NRHP and for designation
as an SAL, and offers management recommendations based on the NRHP and SAL eligibility of
the site.
In addition, mechanical scraping operations were performed within the proposed APE of
the current project in the vicinity of the Monadale Cemetery, a small, late 19th- to early 20thcentury Hispanic cemetery located just beyond the boundaries of the proposed APE, to evaluate
whether or not any unmarked burials associated with the cemetery occur within the current
project area. The methods employed during the mechanical scraping operations are detailed in
Chapter 4.0, Research Objectives and Methodology. While no unmarked graves were
encountered within the proposed project’s APE as a result of the mechanical scraping, this
chapter presents a few additional notes about the historic background of the Monadale
Cemetery that were uncovered during the current investigations.

5.1

SITE 41WM1134

Site 41WM1134 is a multiple-component site consisting of an extensive, very lowdensity, surficial scatter of aboriginal lithic artifacts and historic-age debris in a plowed
agricultural field situated on Pleistocene-age alluvial terraces adjacent to Mustang Creek
(Figures 26 to 27). Site 41WM1134 was originally recorded by HDR in 2005 during a prior
archeological survey performed for an earlier proposed ROW of the FM 1660 relocation project
(Schroeder 2006). The site boundaries delineated by HDR were constrained to a 1-ac parcel of
land located along the eastern edge of the current project corridor. During Horizon’s survey, the
boundaries of site 41WM1134 were expanded into the current project area on a tract of privately
owned land within the proposed new ROW (no portions of the site were documented within
areas of existing publicly owned ROW). As the archeological materials observed in the current
project’s APE were consistent with those observed on the nearby mapped location of site
41WM1134 by HDR, the decision was made to extend the boundaries of the previously
recorded site to incorporate the archeological materials observed during the current survey.

Chapter 5.0: Results of Investigations

As delineated during the current survey, site 41WM1134 measures approximately 400 m
north to south by 100 m east to west, covering an estimated area of 4.0 ha (9.9 ac) within the
current project’s APE. The site is located northeast of the intersection of FM 1660, CR 394, and
CR 133 within an area of proposed new ROW just east of the point at which the proposed new
FM 1660 ROW diverges from the existing ROW near the northern end of the project area.
Archeological materials associated with the site extend across the width of the proposed new
ROW, which is somewhat wider in this vicinity (ca. 100 m [328 ft]) than the average width of the
proposed project corridor (61 m [200 ft]). The existing ROWs of FM 1660 to the west and
CR 394 to the south were examined for archeological materials, but none were observed, and it
is likely that prior road construction has destroyed any remnants of this ephemeral site within
areas of existing ROW. No archeological materials were observed south of CR 394, and the
site does not appear to extend farther south. Thus, as currently delineated, the site is contained
entirely within areas of proposed new ROW that were privately owned at the time of the survey,
and no archeological manifestations were observed within any existing, publicly owned road
ROWs. The site may extend farther to the east and west beyond the boundaries of the APE,
but the northern and southern boundaries were defined during the current investigations.
Physiographically, the site is situated on Pleistocene-age alluvial terraces north and
south of Mustang Creek, which flows west to east through the approximate center of the site
(Figure 28; also see Figure 14). The site is situated in active agricultural fields that had recently
been plowed. However, as the survey was conducted in winter, the fields had not yet been
planted, and visibility of the modern ground surface was excellent (100%). Vegetation on the
portions of the site that are under active cultivation is effectively non-existent, though stands of
grass are present along the banks of Mustang Creek, and a thin line of deciduous trees lines the
eastern side of the existing FM 1660 ROW along the western site boundary. Elevations across
the site range from approximately 201 to 207 m (660 to 680 ft) above mean sea level (amsl).
The higher elevations characterize the ancient terrace landforms at the northern and southern
ends of the site, and the terrain slopes down gradually toward the channel of Mustang Creek.
The aboriginal component on site 41WM1134 consists of a very low-density, surficial
scatter of aboriginal lithic artifacts, included tested chert cobbles, large decortication flakes, and
lithic cores and debitage (Figures 29 to 30). Large, naturally occurring, chert-bearing cobbles
are abundant on the modern ground surface across the entire site area, and this locale
apparently represents an exposure of chert-bearing gravels that was presumably deposited
during the Pleistocene era. Aboriginal archeological materials observed on the site consist of a
very sparse scatter of tested chert cobbles, large decortication flakes, chert cores, and lithic
debitage against a very high background density of natural chert cobbles, many of which have
been broken over the course of decades of plowing. Artifact density is on the order of 1 artifact
(or less) per 100-m2 area, and no areas of higher concentration were observed. No chipped
stone tools, burned rock, temporally diagnostic artifacts, organic remains, or evidence of cultural
features was observed on the site, though the original recorders mentioned finding a single
burned rock on the site (Schroeder 2006:35). The aboriginal component of site 41WM1134
would appear to represent a raw material procurement area (i.e., “quarry”) utilized by the
aboriginal inhabitants of the area. As no temporally diagnostic artifacts were observed, the site
can only be dated to an undetermined aboriginal (presumably prehistoric) timeframe.

Chapter 5.0: Results of Investigations

Figure 30. Sample of Aboriginal Lithic Cores on Site 41WM1134

The historic-age component on site 41WM1134 consists of a similarly sparse, surficial
scatter of historic-age domestic debris, including colored and clear glass shards, whiteware
ceramic sherds, and a few brick fragments (Figure 31). Aside from a few small brick fragments,
no architectural materials were observed among the scatter, suggesting that this component
represents a generalized accumulation of historic-age debris in an agricultural field that has
likely been under cultivation for 100 or more years. No evidence of a residential structure was
observed within the documented site area. The original recorders of the site (Schroeder 2006)
suggested that a schoolhouse associated with the historic-age community of Monadale, which
consisted of a cluster of rural farmsteads surrounding the intersection of FM 1660, CR 394, and
CR 132 in the vicinity of the site, may have been located nearby, though no evidence was cited
by the original recorders or observed during the current investigation that the schoolhouse was
located on this site. The original site recorders reported the following artifacts on the site:
Historic artifacts number around 40 or so fragments consisting of glass, ceramic, and
cast iron. Most of the historic materials include fragments of solared [sic] purple bottle
glass and clear bottle glass, while ceramics such as non-diagnostic whiteware,
stoneware, milk glass, and cobalt blue bottle glass were somewhat less prolific
(Schroeder 2006:35).

Historic-age artifacts observed during Horizon’s investigations were consistent with the
assemblage noted by the original recorders, suggesting an early to mid-20th century historicage presence in the area.

Figure 31. Sample of Historic-Age Glass Shards on Site 41WM1134

Historic map research was conducted at TxDOT’s Environmental Affairs Division (EAD)
office in Austin, Texas, and online in the collections of the University of Texas at Austin’s Perry
Castañeda Library in an effort to establish the dates of possible occupation on or near site
41WM1134. The 1936 General Highway Map of Williamson County, Texas (TxDOT 1936), on
file at TxDOT’s EAD office, shows a cluster of structures surrounding the intersection of
FM 1660, CR 394, and CR 132 in the vicinity of the site that presumably represents what then
remained of the late 19th- to early 20th-century community of Monadale (Figure 32). While the
scale and mapped locations of structures may not be completely accurate on this map,
1 structure is observable northeast of the intersection of the aforementioned roads that may or
may not fall within the documented boundaries of site 41WM1134. The earliest version of the
USGS Hutto, Texas, topographic quadrangle on file in the collections of the Perry Castañeda
Library dates to 1982, which is virtually identical to the 1989 map published in this report (see
Figure 2). Only 1 structure is visible off the east side of FM 1660 along the segment of the
highway extending north of Mustang Creek. This structure is located outside the boundary of
the current project’s APE and well to the north of the documented boundaries of site
41WM1134. It is possible that the structure observable on the 1936 highway map and the 1982
and 1986 USGS topographic maps represent the same house; in any case, it seems likely that
this structure, if it is still standing, is located well beyond the boundaries of the APE and site
41WM1134.

In addition to historic map research, Horizon conducted an informant interview with Mr.
Norman Fuessel, the current owner of the land on which site 41WM1134 is located. This
interview was conducted over the course of several conversations that occurred between
January 25 and 28, 2011, while mechanical scraping operations were occurring on Mr.
Fuessel’s land surrounding the Monadale Cemetery. Mr. Fuessel’s family has owned this
property since 1932, and he stated that no structures were present in the vicinity of site
41WM1134 in his memory. Pointing to the top of the rise about 1.0 km (0.6 mi) north of the site,
Mr. Fuessel indicated that several families of Hispanic tenant farmers who farmed the land in
the early 20th century lived in a series of houses along the old ROW of CR 128 extending
eastward from FM 1660 (see Figure 2), but he indicated that no structures were present
anywhere near the location of site 41WM1134. Mr. Fuessel believed the historic-age materials
in the plowed field are simply detritus scattered from various dumping episodes.
Chain-of-title research was conducted for the property on which site 41WM1134 is
situated to determine if any of the previous owners of the land were of historic note
(Appendix C). The earliest record on file in the deed records of Williamson County indicate the
property was transferred from Frederick S. Millard to Henry B. Millard in 1857. According to the
TSHA’s online Handbook of Texas History, an individual named Henry Millard (1796?-1844)
was a veteran of the Battle of San Jacinto; however, as the historical Henry Millard died in 1844,
there is no possibility that he is the same individual as the Henry B. Millard who was the grantee
of the property in question in 1857. Throughout the late 19th to early 20th centuries, the
property passed briefly through the hands of members of the Blanton, Senkel, Krueger, Lindsey,
Lefler, and Teichelmann families before being conveyed to Rudolph Fuessel in 1932. Rudolph
Fuessel was the father of Normal Fuessel, the current landowner, and the property has
remained in the possession of the Fuessel family since 1932. According to the TSHA’s online
Handbook of Texas History, none of the individuals named on the chain of title appear to be of
historical importance.
The boundaries of site 41WM1134 were determined primarily based on the observed
extent of aboriginal and historic-age archeological materials on the surface of the plowed field.
Eight shovel tests were excavated on the site to confirm the apparent surficial and disturbed
context of the artifacts (see Figure 27; Appendix A). Based on the results of shovel testing, the
plowzone extends to a depth of 25 centimeters (cm) below surface (cmbs), and plowzone
sediments consist of dense, very gravelly black clay overlying dense orange-brown clay. No
archeological materials were observed in any of the 8 shovel tests, though some shallow
subsurface archeological materials may be presumed to exist in disturbed contexts within the
active plowzone that characterizes the agricultural field on which the site occurs.
No cultural features associated with either the prehistoric or historic-age components on
site 41WM1134 were observed within the investigated portion of the site. The historic-age
Monadale Cemetery is located just west of the documented boundaries of site 41WM1134
beyond the current project’s APE, but is not believed to be related to the historic-age artifact
scatter. Based on the lack of integrity of aboriginal and historic-age cultural material, the lack of
cultural features or other structural remains, the lack of diagnostic artifacts (for the aboriginal
component), and the lack of associated persons or events of historic significance and the

HJN 090047 AR

53

Chapter 5.0: Results of Investigations

generalized domestic character of the debris (for the historic-age component), the investigated
portion of site 41WM1134 within the current project area possess minimal to no potential to
contribute to meaningful research on the prehistoric or historic past. The investigated portion of
site 41WM1134 is recommended as ineligible for inclusion in the NRHP and for designation as
an SAL, and no further investigations are recommended in connection with the proposed
undertaking. No archeological materials were collected from site 41WM1134 during the current
survey.
While no backhoe trenches were excavated during the archeological survey, 7 backhoe
trenches were excavated in connection with mechanical scraping and trenching operations
conducted in the vicinity of the Monadale Cemetery to prospect for unmarked graves within the
APE. As such, these 7 trenches were excavated within the documented boundaries of site
41WM1134 (see Figures 16 and 27). Trenches were excavated to depths of 1.8 to 2.3 m (5.9 to
7.5 ft) below surface at approximately 15-m (50-ft) intervals along the edge of the scraped area
to verify that the soils observed within the scraped area were, in fact, natural soils (as opposed
to artificial fill) that are conducive to observing unmarked grave shafts (if present). The soils
underlying the plowzone consist of deep, weathered deposits of interbedded orange-brown clay
and white marly clay that are consistent with the published descriptions of Pleistocene-age
alluvial terrace soils mapped in this area (Barnes 1974; Werchan and Coker 1983). Thus, the
sediments underlying the black, very gravelly clay plowzone in the scraped areas surrounding
the Monadale Cemetery are natural alluvial sediments deposited during the Pleistocene era. No
artificial fill or other disturbances that would mask the observable presence of unmarked graves
were observed, and no unmarked graves were detected within the APE as a result of the
scraping operations. No archeological materials or deposits were observed in any of the
backhoe trenches.

5.2

RESULTS OF INVESTIGATIONS AT MONADALE CEMETERY

The Monadale Cemetery is a small, late 19th- to early 20th-century Hispanic cemetery
located just east of the intersection of the existing FM 1660 ROW and County Road (CR) 133
near the northern end of the project area (see Figure 16). The cemetery is accessed via a 2track road that intersects with FM 1660 (Figure 33). The boundaries of the cemetery are
marked by a continuous woven-wire fence, and the entrance to the cemetery is via an ungated
opening in the fence in the northwest corner (Figure 34). The western outer edge of the
cemetery contains beds of irises bounded by brick curbing (Figure 35), and 2 iris stands also
occur within the cemetery. The Monadale Cemetery contains 3 graves marked by headstones
as well as up to 8 unmarked graves suggested by the presence of several metal grave markers
stacked against a tree by the cemetery entrance. At least 2 of the headstones on the cemetery
appear to be in situ; however, the third headstone is broken and located near the western fence
line and may have been moved. Engraved in Spanish, the 3 headstones mark the interments of
Dolares V. de Garcia, 16 September, 1884, to June 4 1909 (Figure 36); Nicholas Martinez,
December 24, 1901, to June 19, 1922 (Figure 37); and P.S., 1883 to 1913 (Figure 38). Thus,
the dated interments in the cemetery range from 1909 to 1922. One of the headstones faces
west, 1 faces east, and the third is leaning against the western fence and is not in situ;
consequently, the orientation of graves is conclusive. The 8 metal grave markers stacked

against the western fence contain small plates for name placards; however, the name plates are
all absent (Figure 39).
The cemetery itself does not fall within the current project area; however, areas of
proposed new ROW pass within 23 m (75 ft) of the marked cemetery boundaries, and current
THC guidelines require that any portions of a proposed project’s APE that fall within 23 m (75 ft)
of marked cemetery boundaries need to be assessed for unmarked graves. Mechanical
scraping operations were performed along the edge of the proposed new ROW on the side
facing the cemetery to determine whether or not any unmarked graves are present within the
APE (see Chapter 4.0). The proposed new ROW in the vicinity of the cemetery consists of an
active agricultural field that had been plowed but not yet planted for the season. The modern
plowzone was removed along a 5-m- (15-ft-) wide scrape extending along the edge of the

proposed new ROW facing the cemetery, and the upper interface of underlying natural soils was
carefully observed for any evidence of grave shafts, burial furniture, coffin hardware, human
bone, or other indications of unmarked graves. In addition, 7 backhoe trenches were excavated
to depths of 1.8 to 2.3 m (5.9 to 7.5 ft) below surface at approximately 15-m (50-ft) intervals
along the edge of the scraped area to verify that the soils observed within the scraped area
were, in fact, natural soils (as opposed to artificial fill) that are conducive to observing unmarked
grave shafts (if present). The soils underlying the plowzone were determined to be natural
alluvial sediments deposited during the Pleistocene era and appear to be conducive to
identifying unmarked graves. No unmarked graves were observed within the APE as a result of
the scraping operations.
Horizon conducted an informant interview with Mr. Norman Fuessel, the current owner of
the land on which the Monadale Cemetery is located. This interview was conducted over the
course of several conversations that occurred between January 25 and 28, 2011, while
mechanical scraping operations were occurring on Mr. Fuessel’s land surrounding the
Monadale Cemetery. Mr. Fuessel’s family has owned this property since 1932, and he stated
that no structures were present in the vicinity of site 41WM1134 in his memory. Pointing to the
top of the rise about 1.0 km (0.6 mi) north of the cemetery, Mr. Fuessel indicated that several
families of Hispanic tenant farmers who historically farmed this land lived in a series of houses
along the old ROW of CR 128 extending eastward from FM 1660. Mr. Fuessel indicated that
the descendents of these families no longer lived in the area, but that members of branches of
the families currently living in various other places, including Austin and Georgetown,
occasionally visit the cemetery to mow the grass and perform basic maintenance and repairs.

6.0 SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS

The archeological investigations documented in this report were undertaken with
3 primary management goals in mind:

•

Locate all historic and prehistoric archeological resources that occur within the
designated survey area.

•

Evaluate the significance of these resources regarding their potential for inclusion in
the NRHP and for designation as SALs.

•

Formulate recommendations for the treatment of these resources based on their
NRHP and SAL evaluations.

At the survey level of investigation, the principal research objective is to inventory the
cultural resources within the APE and to make preliminary determinations of whether or not the
resources meet one or more of the pre-defined eligibility criteria set forth in the state and/or
federal codes, as appropriate. Usually, management decisions regarding archeological
properties are a function of the potential importance of the sites in addressing defined research
needs, though historic-age sites may also be evaluated in terms of their association with
important historic events and/or personages. Under the NHPA and the Antiquities Code of
Texas, archeological resources are evaluated according to criteria established to determine the
significance of archeological resources for inclusion in the NRHP and for designation as SALs,
respectively.
Analyses of the limited data obtained at the survey level are rarely sufficient to contribute
in a meaningful manner to defined research issues. The objective is rather to determine which
archeological sites could be most profitably investigated further in pursuance of regional,
methodological, or theoretical research questions. Therefore, adequate information on site
function, context, and chronological placement from archeological and, if appropriate, historical
perspectives is essential for archeological evaluations. Because research questions vary as a
function of geography and temporal period, determination of the site context and chronological
placement of cultural properties is a particularly important objective during the inventory
process.

6.1

ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA FOR INCLUSION IN THE NATIONAL REGISTER OF HISTORIC
PLACES

Determinations of eligibility for inclusion in the NRHP are based on the criteria presented
in the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) in 36 CFR §60.4(a-d). The 4 criteria of eligibility are
applied following the identification of relevant historical themes and related research questions:
The quality of significance in American history, architecture, archeology, and culture is
present in districts, sites, buildings, structures, and objects that possess integrity of
location, design, setting, materials, workmanship, feeling, and association, and:
a. [T]hat are associated with events that have made a significant contribution to the
broad patterns of our history; or,
b. [T]hat are associated with the lives of persons significant in our past; or,
c.

[T]hat embody the distinctive characteristics of a type, period, or method of
construction, or that represent a significant and distinguishable entity whose
components may lack individual distinction; or,

d. [T]hat have yielded, or may be likely to yield, information important in prehistory
or history.

The first step in the evaluation process is to define the significance of the property by
identifying the particular aspect of history or prehistory to be addressed and the reasons why
information on that topic is important. The second step is to define the kinds of evidence or the
data requirements that the property must exhibit to provide significant information. These data
requirements in turn indicate the kind of integrity that the site must possess to be significant.
This concept of integrity relates both to the contextual integrity of such entities as structures,
districts, or archeological deposits and to the applicability of the potential database to pertinent
research questions. Without such integrity, the significance of a resource is very limited.
For an archeological resource to be eligible for inclusion in the NRHP, it must meet legal
standards of eligibility that are determined by 3 requirements: (1) properties must possess
significance, (2) the significance must satisfy at least 1 of the 4 criteria for eligibility listed above,
and (3) significance should be derived from an understanding of historic context. As discussed
here, historic context refers to the organization of information concerning prehistory and history
according to various periods of development in various times and at various places. Thus, the
significance of a property can best be understood through knowledge of historic development
and the relationship of the resource to other, similar properties within a particular period of
development. Most prehistoric sites are usually only eligible for inclusion in the NRHP under
Criterion D, which considers their potential to contribute data important to an understanding of
prehistory. All 4 criteria employed for determining NRHP eligibility potentially can be brought to
bear for historic sites.

6.2

ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA FOR LISTING AS A STATE ARCHEOLOGICAL LANDMARK

The criteria for determining the eligibility of a prehistoric or historic cultural property for
designation as an SAL are presented in Chapter 191, Subchapter D, Section 191.092 of the
Antiquities Code of Texas, which states that SALs include:
Sites, objects, buildings, artifacts, implements, and locations of historical, archeological,
scientific, or educational interest including those pertaining to prehistoric and historical
American Indians or aboriginal campsites, dwellings, and habitation sites, their artifacts
and implements of culture, as well as archeological sites of every character that are
located in, on, or under the surface of any land belonging to the State of Texas or to any
county, city, or political subdivision of the state are state archeological landmarks and are
eligible for designation.

The Antiquities Code of Texas establishes the THC as the legal custodian of all cultural
resources, historic and prehistoric, within the public domain of the State of Texas. Under
Section 26.8 of Part 2 of Title 13 of the Texas Administrative Code (13 TAC 26), the THC may
designate an archeological site as an SAL if the site meets one or more of the following criteria:
1. [T]he site has the potential to contribute to a better understanding of the prehistory
and/or history of Texas by the addition of new and important information;
2. [T]he site’s archeological deposits and the artifacts within the site are preserved and
intact, thereby supporting the research potential or preservation interests of the site;
3. [T]he site possesses unique or rare attributes concerning Texas prehistory and/or
history;
4. [T]he study of the site offers the opportunity to test theories and methods of
preservation, thereby contributing to new scientific knowledge; or,
5. [T]he high likelihood that vandalism and relic collecting has occurred or could occur,
and official landmark designation is needed to ensure maximum legal protection, or
alternatively further investigations are needed to mitigate the effects of vandalism and
relic collecting when the site cannot be protected.

SUMMARY OF INVENTORY RESULTS

The APE of the proposed FM 1660 realignment project was traversed by Horizon’s
archeologists, the modern ground surface was thoroughly inspected for archeological
resources, and a total of 328 shovel tests were excavated in the approximately 19.5-km- (12.1mi-) long by 61-m- (200-ft-) wide project area. The project area consists of a mix of existing
(publicly owned) road rights-of-way (ROW) as well as proposed (privately owned) new ROW,
including approximately 38 ha (95 ac; 29%) of existing road ROWs and 93 ha (228 ac; 71%) of
proposed new ROW. Of the total of 328 shovel tests excavated during the survey, 64 shovel
tests (20%) were excavated in areas of existing (publicly owned) ROW and 264 shovel tests
(80%) were excavated in areas of proposed new (privately owned) ROW.
Horizon excavated a total of 328 shovel tests during the survey; thus, the TSMASS
requirements were not quite met for a project area of this length and width. Approximately 29%

HJN 090047 AR

63

Chapter 6.0: Summary and Recommendations

of the APE consisted of existing road ROWs that had experienced extensive prior impacts from
construction, use, and ongoing maintenance of the transportation facilities, many of which had
experienced additional impacts from installation of various overhead and subsurface utility lines
and intersecting driveways. Judgmental shovel testing was conducted within these disturbed
existing road ROWs to confirm the apparent extent of prior impacts inferred via visible surface
conditions, but shovel testing within existing road ROWs was not as extensive as within areas of
proposed new ROW, which had experienced relatively fewer prior impacts from construction.
Furthermore, 1 segment of proposed new ROW extending northwest of Little Mustang
Creek could not be accessed during the survey due to the refusal of the landowner to provide
access. This segment of proposed new ROW measures approximately 1.0 km (0.6 mi) in length
and represents the only segment of the APE that was not surveyed during the current effort.
This unsurveyed segment, which represents approximately 5% of the total APE, consists of an
open, plowed agricultural field, and this area was casually inspected from within the adjacent
areas of the APE to which access was available during the survey. The unsurveyed area
appeared to be identical to neighboring areas, consisting of mature Blackland Prairie soils under
active cultivation, in which no archeological materials were observed. In the event that any
unrecorded archeological materials are present in the unsurveyed portion of the APE, it is likely
that they would occur in disturbed, eroded, surficial contexts and lack depth or integrity. It is
Horizon’s opinion that no intact archeological deposits occur in the short segment of the APE
that was not accessible for survey.
The vast majority of the areas of proposed new ROW in the APE consist of open,
plowed agricultural fields that are under active cultivation; however, as the survey was
conducted in winter, the fields were not planted and ground surface visibility was 100% in most
areas. While the headwaters of 3 minor streams (Mustang Creek, South Fork of Mustang
Creek, and Little Mustang Creek), cross the APE, 2 of these streams (South Fork of Mustang
Creek and Little Mustang Creek) are little more than erosional divots in the landscape, and
Mustang Creek has been extensively channelized. Soils in the APE consist of mature Blackland
Prairie sediments derived from Pleistocene-age fluviatile terrace deposits and Upper
Cretaceous-age marl formations, and no Holocene-age alluvial sediments are present in the
APE. Based on the geomorphological characteristics of the landforms traversed by the APE,
any archeological materials would be expected to be restricted to surficial contexts that have
experienced moderate to extensive disturbance via plowing and erosion. As such, the APE as a
whole, including both areas of existing and proposed new ROW, possesses low potential to
contain intact archeological deposits. Taking into consideration the extent of prior impacts
within existing road ROWs and the short segment of proposed new ROW that was not
accessible during the survey, as well as the geomorphological characteristics of the areas of
proposed new ROW, it is Horizon’s opinion that the density of shovel tests excavated during the
survey was more than adequate for identifying archeological materials within the APE.
One archeological site, 41WM1134, was documented within the APE as a result of the
intensive archeological survey. Site 41WM1134 was originally recorded in 2005 during a prior
archeological survey performed for an earlier proposed ROW of the FM 1660 relocation project.
During the current survey, the boundaries of site 41WM1134 were expanded into the current

64

090047_arch_survey_report

Farm-to-Market Road 1660 Realignment Project, Hutto, Williamson County, Texas

project area on a tract of privately owned land within the proposed new ROW (no portions of the
site were documented within areas of existing public ROW). The portion of the site investigated
during the current survey covers an area of approximately 4.0 ha (9.9 ac). Site 41WM1134 is a
multiple-component site consisting of a very low-density surficial scatter of aboriginal lithic
artifacts, including tested chert cobbles, large decortication flakes, and lithic cores and debitage,
as well as historic-age debris, including bottle glass, whiteware ceramic sherds, and brick
fragments. Archeological materials are scattered across a plowed agricultural field that also
contains an abundance of naturally occurring, chert-bearing cobbles. Thus, the aboriginal
component on the site appears to represent a raw material procurement area (i.e., “quarry”),
though the lack of temporally diagnostic artifacts on the site precludes establishing a date of
occupation beyond a generalized prehistoric timeframe. The historic-age debris suggests an
early to mid-20th-century presence in the area, though no structures or cultural features were
observed. Site boundaries were documented only within the current project area and may
expand beyond them. Based on the lack of integrity of aboriginal and historic-age archeological
materials, the lack of cultural features or other structural remains, the lack of diagnostic artifacts
(for the aboriginal component), a and the lack of associated persons or events of historic
significance and the generalized domestic character of the debris (for the historic-age
component), the investigated portion of site 41WM1134 within the current project area is
recommended as ineligible for inclusion in the NRHP and for designation as a SAL. No
archeological materials were collected from the site during the current survey.
In addition to the intensive archeological survey, mechanical scraping operations were
performed in the vicinity of the historic-age Monadale Cemetery, a small, late 19th- to early
20th-century Hispanic cemetery located just east of the intersection of the existing FM 1660
ROW and CR 133 near the northern end of the project area. The Monadale Cemetery contains
3 graves marked by headstones as well as up to 8 unmarked graves suggested by the presence
of several metal grave markers stacked against a tree by the cemetery entrance. The
boundaries of the cemetery are marked by a continuous woven-wire fence. The cemetery itself
does not fall within the current project area; however, areas of proposed new ROW pass within
23 m (75 ft) of the marked cemetery boundaries, and current THC guidelines require that any
portions of a proposed project’s APE that fall within 23 m (75 ft) of marked cemetery boundaries
need to be assessed for unmarked graves. Mechanical scraping operations were performed
along the edge of the proposed new ROW on the side facing the cemetery to determine whether
or not any unmarked graves are present within the APE. The proposed new ROW in the vicinity
of the cemetery consists of an active agricultural field that had been plowed but not yet planted
for the season. The modern plowzone was removed along a 5-m- (15-ft-) wide scrape
extending along the edge of the proposed new ROW facing the cemetery, and the upper
interface of underlying natural soils was carefully observed for any evidence of grave shafts,
burial furniture, coffin hardware, human bone, or other indications of unmarked graves. In
addition, 7 backhoe trenches were excavated to depths of 1.8 to 2.3 m (5.9 to 7.5 ft) below
surface at approximately 15-m (50-ft) intervals along the edge of the scraped area to verify that
the soils observed within the scraped area were, in fact, natural soils (as opposed to artificial fill)
that are conducive to observing unmarked grave shafts (if present). The soils underlying the
plowzone were determined to be natural alluvial sediments deposited during the Pleistocene era

MANAGEMENT RECOMMENDATIONS

Based on the results of the survey-level investigations documented in this report, no
potentially significant archeological resources or unmarked graves associated with the
Monadale Cemetery would be affected by the proposed undertaking. One multiple-component
aboriginal and historic-age archeological site, 41WM1134, was documented within the APE,
though the investigated portion of the site that falls within the boundaries of the APE is
recommended as ineligible for inclusion in the NRHP and for designation as an SAL. No
archeological materials were collected during the survey, and no unmarked graves associated
with the historic-age Monadale Cemetery were observed within the APE.
In accordance with 36 CFR 800.4, Horizon has made a reasonable and good faith effort
to identify archeological historic properties within the APE. No archeological resources were
identified that meet the criteria for listing on the NRHP according to 36 CFR 60.4 or for
designation as SALs according to 13 TAC 26, and no further archeological work is
recommended in connection with the proposed undertaking. However, in the unlikely event that
any human remains or burial furniture are inadvertently discovered at any point during
construction, use, or ongoing maintenance in the project area, even in previously surveyed
areas, all work should cease immediately and TxDOT and the THC should be notified of the
discovery.
