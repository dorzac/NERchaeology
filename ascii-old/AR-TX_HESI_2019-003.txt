Site 50 Landfill Project in McLennan and Limestone Counties, Texas

ABSTRACT

Between 25 and 28 September 2018, Horizon Environmental Services, Inc. (Horizon)
conducted an intensive cultural resources survey of the City of Waco’s proposed 351.0-acre
Site 50 Landfill Project located northeast of Waco in eastern McLennan County and
northwestern Limestone County, Texas (Project Area). The currently proposed landfill design
plan includes 2 waste disposal areas, a small complex of administrative buildings, and
connective roadways. The overall tract containing the development totals approximately 502.5
acres in size. However, the noted waste disposal areas, buildings, roadways, and all other
ancillary disturbances associated with the undertaking total approximately 351.0 acres within
the overall 502.5-acre tract. For purposes of current investigations and report, the 351.0 acres
where proposed impacts will occur are considered to be the Project Area.
As the proposed development would be owned by the City of Waco, a political
subdivision of the state of Texas, the project would fall under the jurisdiction of the Antiquities
Code of Texas (ACT). Additionally, impacts to any “waters of the US” on the tract would require
the utilization of permits issued by the US Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) in compliance
with Section 404 of the Clean Water Act (CWA). As a result, the portions of the development
within the purview of the USACE would also fall under the regulations of Section 106 of the
National Historic Preservation Act (NHPA) of 1966, as amended. Currently, the USACE
jurisdictional areas where the potential use of a NWP might be necessary consist only of a
roadway crossing over Horse Creek in the north-central portion of the Project Area.
At the request of Lloyd Gosselink Rochelle & Townsend, P.C. (LGRT), Horizon
conducted the cultural resources survey of the Project Area on behalf of the City of Waco in
compliance with the ACT and Section 106 of the NHPA. The purpose of the survey was to
determine if any significant archeological deposits are located within the Project Area and, if any
exist, to determine if the project has the potential to have any adverse effects on sites eligible
for formal designation as State Antiquities Landmarks (SALs) or sites listed on or considered
eligible for listing on the National Register of Historic Places (NRHP). The cultural resources
investigations were conducted under Texas Antiquities Committee (TAC) permit no. 8566.
The cultural resources survey of the Project Area resulted in the documentation of 6
newly recorded archeological sites (41ML324, 41LT481, 41LT482, 41LT483, 41LT484, and
41ML325). Five of the newly recorded sites are historic in nature. These include 2 historic-era

farmsteads (41ML324 and 41LT484), a segment of a historic-era railroad grade (41LT481), a
historic-era refuse dump (41LT483), and a historic-era corral feature (41ML325). It is Horizon’s
opinion that none of these 5 sites qualifies for inclusion in the NRHP under Criteria A, B, or C,
nor do they qualify for formal designations as SALs. The sixth site, 41LT482, was recorded as a
prehistoric campsite. It is Horizon’s opinion that this site does not qualify for inclusion in the
NRHP under Criterion D, nor does it qualify for formal designation as a SAL.
In addition to the documentation of the 6 newly recorded archeological sites, the
investigations also resulted in an evaluation of the boundaries of the TK Cemetery located
immediately adjacent to the western boundary of the Project Area. In order to protect any
unmarked graves that could potentially be present outside of modern cemetery boundaries, the
Texas Historical Commission (THC) requires a construction buffer measuring at least 25.0 feet
(7.6 meters [m]) away from the marked cemetery boundaries. As currently designed, all
impacts associated with the current undertaking are located outside of the required 25.0-foot
(7.6-m) buffer around the modern and mid-20th century boundaries of the TK Cemetery. Based
on this, it is Horizon’s opinion that the proposed impacts associated with the undertaking
beyond the THC’s required 25.0-foot (7.6-m) construction buffer will have no potential for
adverse impacts to any unmarked graves that could be present adjacent to the modern
cemetery fencing. Despite this, Horizon still recommends that some sort of visible demarcation
be installed at the 25.0-foot (7.6-m) buffer distance around the cemetery boundaries to ensure
that no accidental impacts occur within the required buffer zone.
Based on the assessment that sites 41ML324, 41LT481, 41LT482, 41LT483, 41LT484,
and 41ML325 are not eligible for inclusion in the NRHP and do not warrant formal designation
as SALs, it is Horizon’s opinion that the development of the proposed Site 50 Landfill Project will
pose no adverse effects to significant cultural resources that are eligible for formal designation
as SALs or that are listed on or considered eligible for listing on the NRHP. It is also Horizon’s
opinion that a 25.0-foot (7.6-m) construction buffer around the TK Cemetery is adequate to
ensure the protection of any potential unmarked graves that could be present adjacent to the
modern cemetery fencing. Horizon therefore recommends that the undertaking be allowed to
proceed relative to the jurisdiction of the ACT, the USACE, and Section 106 of the NHPA.
However, in the unlikely event that any cultural materials (including human remains or burial
features) are inadvertently discovered at any point during construction, use, or ongoing
maintenance within the Project Area, even in previously surveyed areas, all work at the location
of the discovery should cease immediately, and the THC should be notified of the discovery.
All recovered artifacts and records produced during the investigations are to be curated
at the Texas Archeological Research Laboratory (TARL) in accordance with the TAC PermitTerms and Conditions and 13 TAC Section 26.17.

An Intensive Cultural Resources Survey of the City of Waco’s Proposed
Site 50 Landfill Project in McLennan and Limestone Counties, Texas

1.0 INTRODUCTION

This document reports the results of an intensive cultural resources survey of the City of
Waco’s proposed 351.0-acre Site 50 Landfill Project located northeast of Waco in eastern
McLennan County and northwestern Limestone County, Texas (Project Area) (Figures 1-1
through 1-3). As the proposed development would be owned by the City of Waco, a political
subdivision of the state of Texas, the project would fall under the jurisdiction of the Antiquities
Code of Texas (ACT). Additionally, impacts to any waters of the US on the tract would require
the utilization of permits issued by the US Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) in compliance
with Section 404 of the Clean Water Act (CWA). As a result, the portions of the development
within the purview of the USACE would also fall under the regulations of Section 106 of the
National Historic Preservation Act (NHPA) of 1966, as amended. Currently, the USACE
jurisdictional areas where the potential use of a NWP might be necessary consist only of a
roadway crossing over Horse Creek in the north-central portion of the Project Area (see Figures
1-2 and 1-3).
At the request of Lloyd Gosselink Rochelle & Townsend, P.C. (LGRT), Horizon
conducted the cultural resources survey of the Project Area on behalf of the City of Waco in
compliance with the ACT and Section 106 of the NHPA. The purpose of the survey was to
determine if any significant archeological deposits are located within the Project Area and, if any
exist, to determine if the project has the potential to have any adverse effects on sites eligible
for formal designation as State Antiquities Landmarks (SALs) or sites listed on or considered
eligible for listing on the National Register of Historic Places (NRHP). The cultural resources
investigations were conducted under Texas Antiquities Committee (TAC) permit no. 8566.
The 351.0-acre Project Area is currently largely undeveloped and consists of heavily
wooded upland, floodplain, and terrace settings associated with the Horse and Packwood creek
drainages as well as clear, open pastures. The Project Area is bounded roughly by Farm-toMarket Road (FM) 939 (aka TK Parkway) to the southwest and the Limestone-Hill county line to
the northwest. The currently proposed landfill design plan includes 2 waste disposal areas, a
small complex of administrative buildings, and connective roadways. The East Disposal Area
would be located on an upland ridge that forms an interfluve between Horse Creek to the west
and Packwood Creek to the east and would cover an area of approximately 112.9 acres. The
West Disposal Area would be located on an upland formation between Horse Creek to the east
and FM 939 to the west and would cover an area of approximately 62.8 acres. Proposed

Project facility buildings, including a maintenance/administration building and a citizen’s
convenience center, would be constructed within an approximately 3.6-acre area within the
northern portion of the Project Area. Finally, an intrasite roadway would be constructed that
would provide access to the site from FM 939 and provide connectivity between the various
project facilities within the site. The proposed roadway would measure approximately 4.2 linear
miles within the Project Area. Ground disturbances associated with construction, use, and
ongoing maintenance of the facility would be largely constrained to upland areas, with the
exception of a roadway crossing over Horse Creek in the northern portion of the Project Area
near the proposed location of the administration buildings. Aside from this road crossing, no
impacts are currently anticipated on the floodplain or terraces of Horse or Packwood creeks
based on current project design.
The overall tract containing the Project Area totals approximately 502.5 acres in size.
However, the noted waste disposal areas, buildings, roadways, and all other ancillary
disturbances associated with the undertaking total approximately 351.0 acres within the overall
502.5-acre tract. For purposes of current investigations and report, the 351.0 acres where
proposed impacts will occur are considered to be the Project Area.
The cultural resources investigations consisted of archival research, an intensive cultural
resources survey of the Project Area, and the production of a report suitable for review by the
State Historic Preservation Officer (SHPO) in accordance with the Texas Historical
Commission’s (THC) Rules of Practice and Procedure, Chapter 26, Section 27, and the Council
of Texas Archeologists (CTA) Guidelines for Cultural Resources Management Reports. Russell
K. Brownlow (Horizon president) served as the project’s Principal Investigator, while Briana
Smith (Horizon project archeologist), Jacob Lyons (Horizon project archeologist), Foster Duncan
(Horizon archeological field technician), and Rachel Naasz (Horizon archeological field
technician) conducted the field investigations. Eugene Foster (Horizon history program
manager) served as the project historian and conducted all the historical and property research
for the undertaking.
In an effort to document all cultural resources (subsurface and aboveground) within the
Project Area that were 45 years of age or older, Horizon conducted the survey of the Project
Area between 25 and 28 September 2018. This entailed intensive surface inspection and
subsurface shovel testing efforts over the extent of the 351.0 acres comprising the Project Area.
The Texas State Minimum Archeological Survey Standards (TSMASS) require a minimum of 1
shovel test per 3.0 acres for acreage projects over 200.0 acres in size. This equated to a
minimum of 117 shovel tests over the 351.0-acre Project Area in order to meet the TSMASS.
Horizon exceeded the TSMASS by excavating a total of 241 shovel tests within the Project
Area. In addition, Horizon excavated a total of 5 backhoe trenches within alluvial settings along
the western bank of Horse Creek where the proposed development had the potential to impact
deeply buried cultural deposits, if present.
The cultural resources survey of the Project Area resulted in the documentation of 6
newly recorded archeological sites (41ML324, 41LT481, 41LT482, 41LT483, 41LT484, and
41ML325). Five of the newly recorded sites are historic in nature. These include 2 historic-era
farmsteads (41ML324 and 41LT484), a segment of a historic-era railroad grade (41LT481), a

historic-era refuse dump (41LT483), and a historic-era corral feature (41ML325). It is Horizon’s
opinion that none of these 5 sites qualifies for inclusion in the NRHP under Criteria A, B, or C,
nor do they qualify for formal designations as SALs. The sixth site, 41LT482, was recorded as a
prehistoric campsite. It is Horizon’s opinion that this site does not qualify for inclusion in the
NRHP under Criterion D, nor does it qualify for formal designation as a SAL.
In addition to the documentation of the 6 newly recorded archeological sites, the
investigations also resulted in an evaluation of the boundaries of the TK Cemetery located
immediately adjacent to the western boundary of the Project Area. In order to protect any
unmarked graves that could potentially be present outside of modern cemetery boundaries, the
THC requires a construction buffer measuring at least 25.0 feet (7.6 meters [m]) away from the
marked cemetery boundaries. As currently designed, all impacts associated with the current
undertaking are located outside of the required 25.0-foot (7.6-m) buffer around the modern and
mid-20th century boundaries of the TK Cemetery. Based on this, it is Horizon’s opinion that the
proposed impacts associated with the undertaking beyond the THC’s required 25.0-foot (7.6-m)
construction buffer will have no potential for adverse impacts to any unmarked graves that could
be present adjacent to the modern cemetery fencing. Despite this, Horizon still recommends
that some sort of visible demarcation be installed at the 25.0-foot (7.6-m) buffer distance around
the cemetery boundaries to ensure that no accidental impacts occur within the required buffer
zone.
Based on the assessment that sites 41ML324, 41LT481, 41LT482, 41LT483, 41LT484,
and 41ML325 are not eligible for inclusion in the NRHP and do not warrant formal designation
as SALs, it is Horizon’s opinion that the development of the proposed Site 50 Landfill Project will
pose no adverse effects to significant cultural resources that are eligible for formal designation
as SALs or that are listed on or considered eligible for listing on the NRHP. It is also Horizon’s
opinion that a 25.0-foot (7.6-m) construction buffer around the TK Cemetery is adequate to
ensure the protection of any potential unmarked graves that could be present adjacent to the
modern cemetery fencing. Horizon therefore recommends that the undertaking be allowed to
proceed relative to the jurisdiction of the ACT, the USACE, and Section 106 of the NHPA.
However, in the unlikely event that any cultural materials (including human remains or burial
features) are inadvertently discovered at any point during construction, use, or ongoing
maintenance within the Project Area, even in previously surveyed areas, all work at the location
of the discovery should cease immediately, and the THC should be notified of the discovery.

GENERAL PROJECT AREA DESCRIPTION

The Project Area is located approximately 3.4 miles (5.5 km) northeast of Axtell, Texas,
and approximately 3.6 miles (5.7 km) southwest of Mount Calm, Texas, at the intersection of
McLennan, Limestone, and Hill counties (see Figure 1-1). It can be found on the US Geological
Survey (USGS) Axtell, Texas, 7.5-minute topographic quadrangle (see Figure 1-2). The overall
tract containing the Project Area totals approximately 502.5 acres in size. However, impacts
associated with the undertaking will occur on only approximately 351.0 acres within the overall
502.5-acre tract. The 351.0 acres where proposed impacts will occur are considered to be the
Project Area. General photographs of the Project Area at the time of the cultural resources
survey are presented in Figures 2-1 through 2-6.
The 351.0-acre Project Area is currently largely undeveloped and consists of heavily
wooded upland, floodplain, and terrace settings associated with the Horse and Packwood creek
drainages as well as clear, open pastures. The Project Area is bounded roughly by FM 939 (TK
Parkway) on the southwest and the Limestone-Hill county line on the northwest. The currently
proposed landfill design plan includes 2 waste disposal areas, a small complex of administrative
buildings, and connective roadways (see Figures 1-2 and 1-3). The East Disposal Area would
be located on an upland ridge that forms an interfluve between Horse Creek to the west and
Packwood Creek to the east and would cover an area of approximately 112.9 acres. The West
Disposal Area would be located on an upland formation between Horse Creek to the east and
FM 939 (TK Parkway) to the west and would cover an area of approximately 62.8 acres.
Proposed project facility buildings, including a maintenance/administration building and a
citizen’s convenience center, would be constructed within an approximately 3.6-acre area within
the northern portion of the Project Area. Finally, an intrasite roadway would be constructed that
would provide access to the site from FM 939 and provide connectivity between the various
project facilities within the site. The proposed roadway would measure approximately 4.2 linear
miles within the Project Area. Ground disturbances associated with construction, use, and
ongoing maintenance of the facility would be largely constrained to upland areas, with the
exception of 1 roadway crossing over Horse Creek on the northern portion of the Project Area
near the proposed location of the administration buildings. Aside from this road crossing, no
impacts are currently anticipated on the floodplain or terraces of Horse or Packwood creeks
based on the current project design.

2.2

PHYSIOGRAPHY AND HYDROLOGY

The Project Area is located in eastern McLennan County and western Limestone
County, Texas. These counties are located in eastern Central Texas, close to the common
junction of 3 significant physiographic provinces—the Lampasas Cut Plain, the Edwards
Plateau, and the Blackland Prairie (Hill 1901; Hill and Vaughn 1900; Johnson 1931:125). The
Blackland Prairie, the narrow physiographic zone situated between the Edwards Plateau to the
west and the Gulf Coastal Plain to the east, is a low, rolling land that extends in a narrow band
along the eastern edge of the Balcones fault zone from the Red River Valley in northeastern
Texas to the southern edge of the Edwards Plateau. This is an area of low topographic relief
and poor drainage in which water often ponds after rainstorms and streams flow at very gentle
gradients. The Edwards Plateau and Balcones Escarpment are associated with a great fault
system that arcs across Texas to form a distinct boundary between uplands composed primarily
of limestone bedrock and lower plains composed mostly of softer rocks. In places, this
boundary is marked by an abrupt scarp (the Balcones Escarpment) and in others by a more
gradational ramp, but the entire length of this transition zone is a major ecotone in terms of
topography, bedrock, hydrology, soil, vegetation, and animal life.
The Lampasas Cut Plain is a roughly triangular area of rolling hill country in central and
north-central Texas situated between the Brazos and Colorado rivers ranging in elevation from
754.6 to 1,312.3 feet (230.0 to 400.0 m) above mean sea level (amsl). The Lampasas Cut Plain
forms a limestone upland that has been dissected by the Brazos River and its tributaries,
resulting in landforms characterized by generally rounded uplands cut by moderately broad,
shallow valleys. Soil is thin to absent on the bedrock and supports a mixed savanna flora,
whereas soil is moderately deep in valley floors, where it supports mixed riparian woodlands
and forests. Karst features include sinks, caves, and rockshelters, but such are neither
common nor extensive. Edwards chert is locally abundant but not widespread across the
Lampasas Cut Plain and is of high quality in some places.
Hydrologically, the Project Area is situated within the Middle Brazos-Bosque drainage
basin. It is drained to the southeast by Horse Creek, which joins Williams Creek a short
distance south of the Project Area. Williams Creek flows to the southwest, joining Tehuacana
Creek approximately 11.6 miles (18.7 km) southwest of the Project Area. Tehuacana Creek
also flows to the southwest, joining the Brazos River east of Waco, approximately 14.2 miles
(22.8 km) southwest of the Project Area. The Brazos River, in turn, flows southeastward across
the Blackland Prairie and Gulf Coastal Plain, ultimately discharging into the Gulf of Mexico a
short distance northeast of East Matagorda Bay.
Topographically, the Project Area is situated over a series of slightly undulating hills
dissected by Horse Creek and its drainages. Elevations across the Project Area vary from
approximately 520.0 to 580.0 feet (158.5 to 176.8 m) above mean sea level (amsl), with the
higher elevations located on the upland ridges on opposing sides of Horse Creek and the lower
elevations along the terraces bordering the creek channel.

CLIMATE

Evidence for climatic change from the Pleistocene to the present is most often obtained
through studies of pollen and faunal sequences (Bryant and Holloway 1985; Collins 1995).
Bryant and Holloway (1985) present a sequence of climatic change for nearby east-central
Texas from the Wisconsin Full Glacial period (22,500 to 14,000 B.P.) through the Late Glacial
period (14,000 to 10,000 B.P.) to the Post-Glacial period (10,000 B.P. to present). Evidence
from the Wisconsin Full Glacial period suggests that the climate in east-central Texas was
considerably cooler and more humid than at present. Pollen data indicate that the region was
more heavily forested in deciduous woodlands than during later periods (Bryant and Holloway
1985). The Late Glacial period was characterized by slow climatic deterioration and a slow
warming and/or drying trend (Collins 1995). In east-central Texas, the deciduous woodlands
were gradually replaced by grasslands and post oak savannas (Bryant and Holloway 1985).
During the Post-Glacial period, the east-central Texas environment appears to have been more
stable. The deciduous forests had long since been replaced by prairies and post oak savannas.
The drying and/or warming trend that began in the Late Glacial period continued into the midHolocene, at which point there appears to have been a brief amelioration to more mesic
conditions lasting from roughly 6,000 to 5,000 B.P. Recent studies by Bryant and Holloway
(1985) indicate that modern environmental conditions in east-central Texas were probably
achieved by 1,500 years ago.
McLennan and Limestone counties are located within the south-central climatic division.
The modern climate is typically dry to subhumid with long, hot summers and short, mild winters.
The climate is influenced primarily by tropical maritime air masses from the Gulf of Mexico, but it
is modified by polar air masses. Tropical maritime air masses predominate throughout spring,
summer, and fall. Modified polar air masses are dominant in winter and provide a continental
climate characterized by considerable variations in temperature.
On average throughout the past century, precipitation and temperature manifest regional
clines, with mean annual precipitation totals declining fairly regularly from east to west and
mean annual temperature declining equally evenly from northwest to southeast (Larkin and
Bomar 1983:18, 50). Climate has fluctuated from subtropical humid to subtropical subhumid in
McLennan County. Average annual precipitation totals 81.3 centimeters (32.0 inches) and
temperature averages 19°C (67°F) annually, ranging from 36°C (96°F) in August (the warmest
month) to 15°C (59°F) in January (the coldest month). During this time, however, drier periods
lasting from 3 to 7 years, when total annual rainfall ranged from 30.5 to 63.5 centimeters
(12.0 to 25.0 inches) were followed by abnormally wet years with 114.3 to 127.0 centimeters
(45 to 50 inches) of rainfall.
Two annual precipitation peaks, which typically occur in May and September, are
associated with frontal storms that form when southward-moving cool air masses collide with
warm, moist air masses moving inland from the Gulf of Mexico (Bomar 1983; Carr 1967). The
topographic discontinuity along the Balcones Escarpment lies directly in the path of the Gulf
storm trace and increases the lift in convective storms to produce extreme amounts of rainfall
(Baker 1975). Two extreme examples are the excess of 91.4 centimeters (36.0 inches) of rain

12

150184 - Waco Landfill Site 50 - Arch Survey Report

An Intensive Cultural Resources Survey of the City of Waco’s Proposed
Site 50 Landfill Project in McLennan and Limestone Counties, Texas

that fell within an 18-hour period in the vicinity of Thrall, Texas, in September 1921, and the
55.9-centimeter (22.0-inch) deluge that fell in less than 3 hours near O’Harris, Texas, in May
1935 (Baker 1975). Lower rainfall amounts are characteristic of winter and late summer. In
winter, frontal storms pass so frequently that there is little time for moisture to increase, and
prevailing upper-level winds from west to east often dominate over meridional flow, meaning
that much of the available moisture is derived from the Pacific rather than from the Gulf of
Mexico. In summer, cool fronts rarely penetrate into the region and rainfall occurs primarily as
localized, thermal convective storms.

2.4

FLORA AND FAUNA

The Project Area is in the southwestern portion of the Texan biotic province (Blair 1950),
an intermediate zone between the forests of the Austroriparian and Carolinian provinces and the
grasslands of the Kansan, Balconian, and Tamaulipan provinces. Some species reach the
limits of their ecological range within the Texan province.
The fauna associated with this region are represented by a mixture of species from the
Austroriparian, Tamaulipan, Chihuahuan, Kansan, Balconian, and Texan biotic provinces.
Common mammalian species include white-tailed deer, opossum, eastern cottontail rabbit,
raccoon, striped skunk, hispid cotton rat, white-footed mouse, nine-banded armadillo, and fox
squirrel. Common bird species include northern bobwhite, eastern meadowlark, mourning dove,
killdeer, field sparrow, red-tailed hawk, turkey vulture, belted kingfisher, and mockingbird.
Reptile and amphibian species common to this biotic zone include six-lined racerunner, rat
snake, eastern hognose snake, Gulf Coast toad, Texas spiny lizard, rough green snake,
copperhead, western diamondback rattlesnake, green treefrog, Blanchard’s cricket frog,
diamondback water snake, Houston toad, and green anole. Although small herds of bison and
antelope were common during the late prehistoric and early historic periods, these species are
no longer native to this region (Jurney et al. 1989:13-14).

3.0 CULTURAL BACKGROUND

The APE is located within Prewitt’s (1981, 1985) Central Texas Archeological Region.
The indigenous human inhabitants of Central Texas practiced a generally nomadic hunting and
gathering lifestyle throughout all of prehistory, and, in contrast to much of the rest of North
America, mobility and settlement patterns do not appear to have changed markedly through
time in this region.

3.1

PALEOINDIAN PERIOD (CA. 12,000 TO 8500 B.P.)

The initial human occupations in the New World can now be confidently extended back
before 12,000 B.P. (Dincauze 1984; Haynes et al. 1984; Kelly and Todd 1988; Lynch 1990;
Meltzer 1989). Evidence from Meadowcroft Rockshelter in Pennsylvania suggests that humans
were present in Eastern North America as early as 14,000 to 16,000 years ago (Adovasio et al.
1990), while more recent discoveries at Monte Verde in Chile provide unequivocal evidence for
human occupation in South America by at least 12,500 years ago (Dillehay 1989, 1997; Meltzer
et al. 1997). Most archeologists have historically discounted claims of much earlier human
occupation during the Pleistocene glacial period. However, recent investigations of the
Buttermilk Creek Complex in Bell County, Texas, have raised the possibility that a pre-Clovis
culture may have been present in North America as early as 15,500 years ago (Waters et al.
2011).
The earliest generalized evidence for human activities in Central Texas is represented
by the PaleoIndian period (12,000 to 8500 B.P.) (Collins 1995). This stage coincided with
ameliorating climatic conditions following the close of the Pleistocene epoch that witnessed the
extinction of herds of mammoth, horse, camel, and bison. Cultures representing various
periods within this stage are characterized by series of distinctive, relatively large, often fluted,
lanceolate projectile points. These points are frequently associated with spurred end scrapers,
gravers, and bone foreshafts. PaleoIndian groups are often inferred to have been organized
into egalitarian bands consisting of a few dozen individuals that practiced a fully nomadic
subsistence and settlement pattern. Due to poor preservation of floral materials, subsistence
patterns in Central Texas are known primarily through the study of faunal remains. Subsistence
focused on the exploitation of plants, small animals, fish, and shellfish, even during the
PaleoIndian period. There is little evidence in this region for hunting of extinct megafauna, as
has been documented elsewhere in North America. Rather, a broad-based subsistence pattern
appears to have been practiced throughout all prehistoric time periods. In Central Texas, the

HJN 150184 AR 03

17

Chapter 3.0: Cultural Background

PaleoIndian stage is divided into 2 periods based on recognizable differences in projectile point
styles. These include the Early PaleoIndian period, which is recognized based on large, fluted
projectile points (i.e., Clovis, Folsom, Dalton, San Patrice, and Big Sandy), and the Late
PaleoIndian period, which is characterized by unfluted lanceolate points (i.e., Plainview,
Scottsbluff, Meserve, and Angostura).

3.2

ARCHAIC PERIOD (CA. 8500 TO 1200 B.P.)

The onset of the Hypsithermal drying trend marks the beginning of the Archaic period
(8500 to 1200 B.P.) (Collins 1995). This climatic trend marked the beginning of a significant
reorientation of lifestyle throughout most of North America, but this change was far less
pronounced in Central Texas. Elsewhere, the changing climatic conditions and corresponding
decrease in the big game populations forced people to rely more heavily upon a diversified
resource base composed of smaller game and wild plants. In Central Texas, however, this
hunting and gathering pattern is characteristic of most of prehistory. The appearance of a more
diversified tool kit, the development of an expanded groundstone assemblage, and a general
decrease in the size of projectile points are hallmarks of this cultural stage. Material culture
shows greater diversity during this broad cultural period, especially in the application of
groundstone technology.
Traditionally, the Archaic period is subdivided into Early, Middle, and Late subperiods.
Changes in projectile point morphology are often used as markers differentiating these
3 subperiods, though other changes in material culture occurred as well. Perhaps most
markedly, burned rock middens appear during the Middle Archaic subperiod, continuing into the
Late Archaic subperiod, and large cemeteries appear during the Late Archaic subperiod. In
addition, the increasing density of prehistoric sites through time is often considered to constitute
evidence of population growth, though differential preservation probably at least partially
accounts for the lower numbers of older sites.

3.3

LATE PREHISTORIC PERIOD (CA. 1200 TO 350 B.P.)

The onset of the Late Prehistoric period (1200 to 350 B.P.) (Collins 1995) is defined by
the appearance of the bow and arrow. In Central Texas, pottery also appears during the Late
Prehistoric period (though ceramics appear earlier in Southeast Texas). Use of the atlatl (i.e.,
spearthrower) and spear was generally discontinued during the Late Prehistoric period, though
they continued to be used in the inland subregion of Southeast Texas along with the bow and
arrow through the Late Prehistoric period (Patterson 1980, 1995; Wheat 1953). In Texas,
unifacial arrow points appear to be associated with a small prismatic blade technology. The
Late Prehistoric period is generally divided into 2 phases, the Austin and Toyah phases. Austin
phase sites occur earliest to the north, which has led some researchers (e.g., Prewitt 1985) to
suggest that the Austin-phase populations of Central Texas were migrants from the north, and
lack the ceramic industry of the later Toyah phase.

3.4

HISTORIC PERIOD (CA. 350 B.P. TO PRESENT)

The first European incursion into what is now known as Texas was in 1519, when
Alonso Álvarez de Pineda explored the northern shores of the Gulf of Mexico. In 1528, Álvar
Núñez Cabeza de Vaca crossed South Texas after being shipwrecked along the Texas Coast
near Galveston Bay. However, European settlement did not seriously disrupt native ways of life
until after 1700. The first half of the 18th century was the period in which the fur trade and
mission system, as well as the first effects of epidemic diseases, began to seriously disrupt the
native culture and social systems. This process is clearly discernible at the Mitchell Ridge site,
where burial data suggest population declines and group mergers (Ricklis 1994), as well as
increased participation on the part of the Native American population in the fur trade. By the
time that heavy settlement of Texas began in the early 1800s by Anglo-Americans, the
indigenous Indian population was greatly diminished.
McLennan County was established by the Texas legislature on January 22, 1850, and
named for Neil McLennan, one of the early settlers.1 The county government was organized in
August 1850 with Waco as its county seat. The county originally included its present area as
well as the land to the northwest as far as the northern boundary of the Robertson colony; it was
reduced to its present size in 1854 when Bosque County was established. Although McLennan
County was organized too late to be included in the 1850 census, its population at that time has
been estimated at several hundred. Rapid growth was possible because, within 2 years of the
establishment of Waco Village, the frontier was pushed well to the northwest of the area. The
Indians who had lived there were moved to a Texas reservation in 1854 and then to Oklahoma
in 1859. Aside from Waco, the earliest communities in the county were at Bosqueville and Bold
Springs (later called West). Most of the settlers who came to the county before the Civil War
were Americans of English, Scottish, and Irish descent who moved from other parts of Texas or
from the southern United States. Many of them were well-educated, well-to-do people with
money to invest in the establishment of new towns, schools, and churches.
The Baptist and Methodist churches were among the earliest to be organized in the
county. A Methodist church was built in Waco in 1850, and a Baptist church followed in 1851.
Episcopal services were held in Waco as early as 1854, but the church was not formally
organized until 1868. A Presbyterian church was organized in 1855. Few Catholics lived in
McLennan County until after the Civil War, when German and Czech immigrants moved to the
area; a Catholic church was built in Waco in 1870. Jewish ceremonies in Waco were celebrated
in rented rooms or private homes prior to the establishment of a synagogue in 1871. The 1860
census showed the county’s free population to be 3,811; 270 of this number were slaveholders,
who owned a total of 2,395 slaves. The land near the Brazos River was used for the
establishment of large cotton plantations, while the surrounding prairie land was used primarily
for livestock. The 1860 production of the county’s 379 farms included 2,300 bales of cotton,
187,800 bushels of corn, 39,200 bushels of wheat, 46,600 cattle, and 22,000 sheep.

Chapter 3.0: Cultural Background

Richard Coke represented McLennan County at the Secession Convention in January
1861 and voted for secession; McLennan County voters accepted the ordinance later that year
by a margin of 586 to 191. Nevertheless, in spite of the overwhelming support of the county for
secession, the mayor of Waco from 1862 to 1866 was a Unionist. Approximately 1,500 men
from McLennan County served in the Confederate Army, including 6 generals—Jerome
Bonaparte Robertson, Felix Huston Robertson, Lawrence Sullivan Ross, William H. Parsons,
Allison Nelson, and Hiram Bronson Granbury. A company raised by Peter F. Ross served in the
Sixth Texas Regiment, and the Lone Star Guards became Company E of the Fourth Texas
Infantry of Hood’s Texas Brigade. The city of Waco was occupied by federal troops for a short
time in 1868. During the Reconstruction period, the district judge and the county commissioners
arrested each other, the judge citing the commissioners for contempt, and the commissioners
charging the judge with lunacy; all charges were dropped. Election returns for 1869 showed
McLennan County voters choosing Edmund J. Davis for governor over Andrew J. Hamilton by a
vote of 797 to 606; however, in the Congressional election held 2 years later, the Democratic
candidate, Dewitt C. Giddings, carried the county by a vote of 1,520 to 1,162. Waco lawyer
Richard Coke was elected governor in 1873.
Like most areas in the South, McLennan County suffered a severe economic decline
immediately following the Civil War and throughout the Reconstruction period. Between 1863
and 1866, the county experienced a 73% loss in property tax receipts. Recovery was slow
because transportation was poor and the economy was so dependent on agriculture. After the
war, many former slaves remained in the area, some choosing to continue working for former
owners, some finding employment in Waco, and still others establishing communities such as
Downsville and Harrison. By 1870, the black population in the county had increased to 4,627,
slightly more than a third of the total number of residents. Over the course of the next several
decades, the number of blacks in the county increased steadily, although the number of
European immigrants was such that blacks as a percentage of the total population fell from 29%
in 1880 to 16% in 1960. The McLennan County economy began to show signs of recovery by
the late 1870s, mainly as a result of northern capital, improved transportation, and the influx of
European immigrants. The completion of the Waco Suspension Bridge in 1870 provided a
reliable means of crossing the Brazos River and made Waco a major center for trade. The
Waco and Northwestern Railroad passed through Waco in 1872, laying track from Bremond to
Ross and thereby giving McLennan County access to markets through the Houston and Texas
Central Railroad.
The overall population of the county rose from 13,500 in 1870 to 26,037 by 1880, and
the census reported 3,256 farms in 1880, up from 937 10 years earlier. Many of the county’s
large plantations were divided into small farms and leased to tenants in the years immediately
following the Civil War; other farms were broken up and sold for taxes. Immigrants from other
states, as well as European countries, were able to take advantage of the availability of land
and start new farms of their own. Farm acreage in the county in 1880 totaled 405,115 acres, an
increase of 300% over pre-war numbers. Production in 1880 included 197,520 bushels of
wheat, 515,648 bushels of corn, and 12,777 bales of cotton; among the county’s livestock were
30,000 cattle, 12,500 hogs, and 25,000 sheep. More railroads reached McLennan County in
the 1880s, making Waco a principal junction. The Gulf, Colorado and Santa Fe completed its

track between Temple and Fort Worth in 1881; the Texas and St. Louis connected Waco with
Corsicana in 1881 and with Gatesville in 1882; also in 1882, the Missouri, Kansas and Texas
laid track between Hillsboro and Taylor, and the Texas Central connected Ross and Albany;
and finally, in 1889 the San Antonio and Aransas Pass laid track from Waco to Lott. The
International and Great Northern Railroad laid track between Marlin and Waco in 1902 and
between Waco and Fort Worth in 1903. An electric interurban line, which was completed
between Waco and Dallas in 1913, provided convenient and inexpensive passenger service
until improved highways in the 1940s put it out of business. With the railroads came new towns
such as McGregor, Moody, Crawford, Lott, Bellmead, Hewitt, Riesel, Battle, Leroy, and Axtell;
other towns, like West, Eddy, Mart, Hallsburg, and Elm Mott, were already in existence when
the railroads built through and profited from the increased economic opportunity; still other
communities, like Perry, Mastersville, and Elk, were bypassed by the railroads and faded as
their populations were drawn to more convenient locations. In 1890, the population of the
county was 39,204; by the turn of the century it had risen to 59,772.
Cotton was the dominant feature of McLennan County agriculture from the 1880s to the
1950s. As the cotton market recovered after Reconstruction, farmers new to the McLennan
County area began cultivating the black, waxy soil in the eastern sections and found that cotton
grew well there. By 1890, the county had several hundred thousand dollars invested in cotton
mills, cotton compresses, and cottonseed oil works; nearly every town on the railroad had at
least one cotton gin to accommodate area farmers. In 1890, farmers planted cotton on more
than 73,000 acres, nearly a quarter of the county’s improved land, and produced 30,000 bales;
in 1910, the 240,000 acres planted in cotton represented half of the county’s improved acreage,
and the crop yielded 69,000 bales. The Cotton Palace held an exhibition and carnival in 1894
intended to be an annual event. It burned in early 1895, but was reestablished in 1910; it
continued until 1930, with a 21-year attendance of more than $8 million. In the first quarter of
the 20th century, many rural blacks moved to Waco, attracted by the prospect of better schools
and better-paying jobs. Most settled in black neighborhoods in east Waco. An educated black
middle class began to emerge during these years and was possibly perceived as a threat to the
established white society. During the 1910s and 1920s, when large numbers of Mexican
nationals immigrated to the United States, hundreds made their way to McLennan County in
search of work. According to the census of 1900, only 100 McLennan County residents were
natives of Mexico; however, by 1930, Mexican Americans in the county numbered more than
4,100, or 4% of the total population. Some became tenant farmers or sharecroppers, while
others became part of a migratory labor force that helped to sustain the county’s cottondependent economy. Mexican Americans made up 4% of the county’s population through the
1950s, but the percentage began to rise in the 1960s and 1970s as more people immigrated to
join family and friends already in the area. By 1987, the number of Mexican Americans in
McLennan County had risen to 18,872, 10% of the county’s population.
World War I brought Army Camp MacArthur and Rich Field to Waco in 1917, and the
resulting growth in business and population shifted the urban/rural balance of the county. For
the first time, the number of people living in cities and towns was greater than the number of
people living in the country. Waco’s population doubled in the late 1910s, and support services
grew rapidly to meet the demand of the larger population. Because many soldiers chose to live

in Waco after the war, expansion continued in the peacetime economy. Although agriculture
continued to dominate the county, industry was gaining a foothold. In addition to small
manufacturers who were already prospering in the towns, several large businesses moved into
the area to take advantage of the ready access to markets offered by Waco. The Barton
Dyanshine factory, at one time the world’s largest shoe polish manufacturer, was established in
Waco in 1919 and remained until 1927, when it was moved to St. Louis. The Borden Company,
which bottled and distributed milk, and the Atlas Portland Cement Company, later a subsidiary
of US Steel, opened in Waco in 1929. The Great Depression of the 1930s, complicated by
severe drought conditions in much of the area, slowed the county’s growth considerably. Cotton
prices fell from 18 cents per pound to 5 cents between 1928 and 1931. Some city residents
moved to the country to find food; some rural residents moved to the city to find work. Waco’s
population increased by only 2.5% between 1930 and 1940; the county as a whole grew by only
3%. The Work Projects Administration funded several construction projects, such as Tonkawa
Park at Crawford and University High School in Waco. Highway and bridge building projects
also provided work, although much of it was unskilled.
The United States entry into World War II brought an end to the depression and spurred
McLennan County’s industrial growth. During the course of the war, the army established the
Bluebonnet ordnance plant at McGregor and the Waco Army Airfield (later renamed James
Connally Air Force Base) at Waco. The Army Air Corps also leased the municipal airport that
Waco had started building near China Spring and turned the facility into the Blackland Army Air
Field. New companies were established in the Waco area to help the war effort, and they, along
with many existing industries and manufacturers, profited from government contracts. Between
the beginning of the war and December 1944, the federal government spent $42 million on the
construction and maintenance of facilities in McLennan County and $119 million for supply
contracts with local businesses. The industrialization that took place in the 1940s and 1950s
diversified the county’s economic interests and prompted a change in the agricultural system.
Many rural residents, most of them tenant farmers, gave up their farms and moved to the city in
search of industry jobs. Much of the agricultural emphasis was shifted from small family farms
to larger commercial establishments and from cotton to more diverse crops. Between the 1930s
and the 1960s, the number of farms fell sharply, and the average farm size rose from 89 acres
to 259 acres. The number of tenant farmers, who had accounted for a sizeable portion of the
farming operations in the county since Reconstruction days, began to decline. In 1930, tenants
operated 4,752 farms, more than 70% of the farms in the county; by 1950, they numbered only
1,288, or one-third of the county’s farmers. This trend continued well into the 1980s, with less
than 10% of the county’s 1,977 farms being operated by tenants in 1987.
In the years following World War II, Waco and McLennan County experienced a
resurgence of population growth, and the transition to a peacetime economy went fairly
smoothly. In 1950, 130,194 people resided in McLennan County; 65% of that total lived in
Waco. The county, and especially Waco, experienced a serious setback in May 1953, when a
tornado struck the downtown area. Several city blocks were flattened, leaving 144 people dead
and 1,097 injured. Several hundred homes, cars, and businesses were damaged or completely
destroyed, and many buildings had to be razed. The property damage amounted to $51 million.
The 1960s found McLennan County facing several problems—the closure of the Connally Air

Force Base in 1966 left many people out of work. Following the integration of schools, many
white people moved to suburban areas such as Hewitt, Woodway, Beverly Hills, and Robinson.
The decline of the railroad also led to a corresponding decline in several small towns. The
decade did bring improvements, however. Among these were several urban renewal projects,
the construction of Interstate Highway 35, the establishment of McLennan Community College,
the enlargement of Lake Waco, and the establishment of the Texas State Technical College at
Waco. A new interest in local history prompted the reconstruction of Fort Fisher as the Texas
Ranger Hall of Fame and Museum and the renovation of the suspension bridge. In the early
1980s, 76% of the land in the county was devoted to agriculture. Cotton, corn, oats, and wheat
were the primary crops, accounting for 90% of the 310,000 acres harvested; other crops were
sorghum, hay, potatoes, tomatoes, and watermelon. Nearly 60% of the county’s agricultural
receipts came from livestock and livestock products, the most important ones being turkeys,
cattle, milk, sheep, wool, angora goats, mohair, and hogs. Industries in the county surpassed
agriculture in terms of income and number of people employed, but the 2 spheres were closely
interrelated. Poultry processing, manufacture of prepared feeds, and dairy production were
among the county’s important businesses. Other large employers included professional and
related services, wholesale and retail trade, finance, insurance, and real estate. McLennan
County had 170,755 residents in 1980, a 15% increase over the 1970 population of 147,553,
and the population in 1990 was 189,123.

DATABASE REVIEW

Archival research conducted via the THC’s Texas Archeological Sites Atlas (Atlas)
online database revealed that 1 previously recorded archeological site and 1 cemetery occur
within a 1.0-mile (1.6-km) radius of the Project Area, while a review of the National Park
Service’s (NPS) NRHP Google Earth database indicated the presence of no historic properties
listed on the NRHP within the review radius (THC 2018; NPS 2018). The 2 documented cultural
resources within the review radius are summarized in Table 4-1, while their locations relative to
the Project Area are presented in Figure 4-1. No documented cultural resources are located
within the Project Area, and no historic properties or districts listed on the NRHP or designated
as SALs are present within the 1.0-mile (1.6-km) review radius.

The previously recorded archeological site, 41ML76, has minimal information provided
on its site form. Its location appears to have been recorded in the 1930s by local avocational
archeologists, as the site form notes that the site is Frank Bryan’s site 23 and probably Frank
Watt’s McL #118. It is also described as being located on the north bank of Williams Creek just
east of its crossing of the McLennan/Limestone county line road (see Figure 4-1). Aside from
this limited information, the site type, age of cultural component(s), and NRHP eligibility status
of this site are not available.
The TK Cemetery is located off the eastern side of FM 939 (TK Parkway) adjacent to
and outside of the western boundary of the Project Area. This cemetery, also known as the
Kirkland Cemetery, is named after Thomas Kirkland (TK). Kirkland, a local landowner and
founder of the town of Tekay, died in 1914 and is buried in the cemetery (Find a Grave 2018a).

MAYBORN MUSEUM COLLECTION

When Rebecca Shelton, Regional Archeologist/Project Reviewer for the THC, issued the
TAC permit for the field investigations within the current Project Area, she informed Horizon of
the collections and papers of Frank Watt that are housed at the Mayborn Museum in Waco.
Watt was a meticulous avocational archeologist in the Waco area who documented hundreds of
sites between the 1930s and 1960s. Ms. Shelton noted that not all of his sites have been crossreferenced with those on the Atlas database and recommended reviewing Watt’s collection to
determine if he had potentially documented any sites in the vicinity of the current Project Area.
As noted above, the site form for nearby site 41ML76 indicates that the site could be “Frank
Watt’s McL #118”.
Based on information provided by Ms. Shelton, Horizon contacted Sabrina Thomas, the
Assistant Collections Manager for the Mayborn Museum Complex in Waco, Texas. Ms.
Thomas, who is very familiar with the Watt Collection, first provided a scanned image of Watt’s
larger-scale “C.T.A.S Area” map of Waco and the surrounding area (BUMMC 2018a). Watt had
placed a grid over this map and labeled the various areas in relation to smaller-scale maps that
he created for each region (Figure 4-2). It was from this map that Horizon deduced that the
current Project Area could be found on one of Watt’s 40A series maps that were housed in his
collection (BUMMC 2018b). Ms. Thomas provided scans of the smaller-scale maps, and the
current Project Area location was found on Watt’s 40A-4 map (Figure 4-3).
As can be seen in Figure 4-3, Watt marks the presence of 2 surface villages or
campsites (noted as 2 and 3) along Williams Creek to the southeast of the current Project
Area. In addition to these mapped locations, the scan of Watt’s 40A-4 map also contains a
sketch at the bottom of the page that provides additional location information (Figure 4-4).
This sketch shows site 2 as being west of a roadway (FM 939?), east of the county line, north
of a bend in Williams Creek, and near (southeast) of a structure. Matching these features to a
modern topographic map of the area, it is clear that Watt’s site 2 is previously recorded
archeological site 41ML76 that is located southeast of the current Project Area (Figure 4-5).
Following Watt’s sketched bends and forks of Williams Creek on his 40A-4 map, his site 3
(noted as being 1 acre in size on the sketch) appears to be located on a terrace to the northeast
of the confluence of Williams and Packwood creeks. This site is not present on the Atlas
database and does not appear to have ever been formally recorded. Both of the sites noted on
Watt’s 40A-4 map are located outside of the boundaries of the current Project Area and have no
potential to be impacted by the current undertaking.

PROPERTY HISTORY

The Project Area is located within the northwest corner of the WW Boen Survey, a first
class Robertson Colony grant of a league and a labor issued to William W. Boen in February
1838 (Texas General Land Office, Land Grant File No. 298). The Boen grant is primarily in
Limestone County but the western portion of it extends into adjacent McLennan County (Figure
4-6). Horizon’s review of official public property records for the project area indicates Boen’s
land grant was assigned early on to Walter Hinkley and later transferred to non-resident parties,
a practice that was common in the 19th century as original land grants were subdivided into
smaller parcels and sold off to incoming settlers and other commercial business interests.
By November 1880, A. B. Wilie, an agent for non-resident owners from Michigan and
New York, sold a 200-acre tract to Minerva Johnson (Limestone County Official Public records
(LCOPR) Volume M, page 514), a property that is frequently referenced in subsequent deed
records and property descriptions related to the Project Area. Minerva Johnson’s 200 acres
was located in the northwest corner of the Boen Survey and straddles the Limestone-McLennan
county boundary. Johnson is described in deed records as a resident of McLennan County in
1880 and later as a resident of the Chickasaw Nation when she began subdividing her 200
acres in the Boen survey into smaller tracts for her heirs. Between 1880 and 1900, Johnson’s
200 acres was extensively subdivided and sold outside the family with few, if any, of her heirs
retaining ownership and residing in the area. Among the property owners who acquired portions
of the Boen Survey in the late 19th and early 20th century, the most relevant to the current
Project Area are the Kirklands.

Thomas A. (T.A.) Kirkland began acquiring substantial amounts of farm and ranch land
in eastern McLennan County and western Limestone County in the 1880s and 1890s. By the
early 1900s, T.A. Kirkland appears to own most, if not all, of Minerva Johnson’s previously
subdivided tracts east of a county road now known as FM 939. T.A. Kirkland’s family
homestead appears to have been located within the former M. Johnson land, likely at the
location of 2 buildings labeled “Teka” on the 1920 USGS “Mart” topographic quadrangle, just
north of the Project Area and the route of the Saint Louis-Southwestern Railway, which was built
through the area in 1891 (Figure 4-7). T.A. Kirkland, Sr. was a Civil War veteran who is credited
locally with establishing the TK Baptist Church and thereby founding the surrounding TK
(sometimes spelled Tekay) community (Find a Grave 2018a). T.A Kirkland and his wife Laura
A. raised 3 children during their long tenure in the Tekay community – Thomas A. Kirkland, Jr.,
Mattie K. (Kirkland) Barrett, and Archie L. Kirkland.
T.A. Kirkland, Sr.’s death in 1914 appears to mark the founding of the TK Cemetery, just
east of the TK Baptist Church within T.A. Kirkland’s 70-acre tract that spanned the railroad rightof-way. Fifteen years after her husband’s death in 1914, Laura A. Kirkland bequeathed separate
large-acreage tracts in and near the Boen Survey to each of her 3 children along with shared
portions of several small-acreage tracts that appear to comprise the family’s homestead. Laura
Kirkland also set aside a 2.15-acre parcel for public use as the Tekay Church and Cemetery,
expressly limiting its use to Protestant whites and specifically excluding its use by “blacks and
mexicans” (LCOPR Vol. 299/ Page 529). Following their mother’s death in 1930, the Kirkland
heirs, especially Thomas A. Kirkland, Jr. and Archie L. Kirkland, appear to have remained in the
area as resident farmers and ranchers into the mid-20th century. T.A. and Laura Kirkland’s
daughter, Mattie K., received similar allotments of land from her mother, though Mattie K.
married a local doctor, Howard E. Barrett, and does not appear to have continued living in the
immediate vicinity.

By the mid-20th century, the Kirklands’ real estate interests in the project area began
diminishing. In 1946, Mattie K. (Kirkland) Barrett and her husband released their lien on 339.7
acres of land in the Boen Survey to Jim B. and Tant Horn (LCOPR Vol. 302, p 111). The Horn
brothers were World War II military veterans who returned to central Texas after the war and
apparently acquired multiple tracts of former Kirkland ranch lands through the newly organized
Veteran’s Land Board (LCOPR Vol. 498, page 116). Thereafter, the Horns maintained their
ownership and agricultural use of the former Kirkland ranch lands into the early 21st century,
though both Jim Buchanan Horn and Frankie “Tant” Horn appear to have focused their working
careers in Waco, Texas and used their property in the Boen survey for supplementary
agricultural purposes (Find a Grave 2018b). Most of the Project Area remained part of Jim B.
Horn’s ranch and estate through the end of the 20th century. By 2002, Horn transferred his real
estate interests in the Project Area into a living trust before selling it David B. Royalty and his
wife Lori in 2002 (MCOPR Document. No.2002018663).

TK CHURCH AND CEMETERY RESEARCH

The TK Cemetery is located off the eastern side of FM 939 (TK Parkway) adjacent to
and outside of the western boundary of the Project Area (Figure 4-8). Although this cemetery is
located just outside of the current Project Area boundaries, it is unclear if the modern cemetery
boundary is the same as the originally platted boundary. Because the THC requires a
construction buffer measuring at least 25.0 feet (7.6 m) away from the marked cemetery

HJN 150184 AR 03

33

Chapter 4.0: Archival Research

Figure 4-8. View of TK Cemetery gate adjacent to the Project Area, facing southeast
boundaries in order to protect any unmarked graves that could potentially be present outside of
modern cemetery boundaries, Horizon reviewed online cemetery databases, property records,
and historical maps to determine if the boundaries of the TK Cemetery had altered over time.
Horizon first conducted a search for the TK Cemetery online via the Find a Grave
website (www.findagrave.com). This search produced information pertaining to the cemetery,
its namesake, and numerous individuals interred within its limits between its founding in the
early 20th century and the present. The main TK Cemetery webpage notes that the cemetery
is also known as the Kirkland Cemetery. Text on the page describes the cemetery as follows:
This small cemetery is located in East McLennan County and is nicely fenced.
There is good signage and the property is well maintained. There is room for expansion.
There are older headstones in this cemetery and the graves are scattered through-out
the property. There are a few stones that are massive and old (Find a Grave 2018c).

This page has records of 74 graves within the cemetery. The oldest of these appears to
be that of Thomas Augustus Kirkland, Sr. who was born on 23 October 1845 and died on 27
September 1914 at the age of 68 (Figure 4-9). The text on his page is as follows:

An Intensive Cultural Resources Survey of the City of Waco’s Proposed
Site 50 Landfill Project in McLennan and Limestone Counties, Texas

Figure 4-9. Photograph of Thomas Kirkland, Sr. on his headstone (Find a Grave 2018a)
In the Fall of 1864, in McLennan County, TX, at age 18, Tom enlisted in the Confederate
Army--in Greathouse's Company, Simm's Battalion and remained until the close of the
war. With his brother, Edward Pickens Kirkland in 1872 Tom purchased 200 acres of
land. Eventually he owned 3,800 acres of fine farming land. The Kirkland Ranch
straddled the McLennan and Hill County line and flowed into Limestone County, as well.
Tom was a democrat and a member of Mt. Calm Lodge, No. 204, AF & M Royal Arch
Chapter. He was a progressive and public-spirited man. When the Cotton Belt Railroad
arrived, Tom built livestock loading racks and hence the community--Tekay (his initials)
grew.
Tom married Laura A. Allen on 19-Jan-1877 in McLennan County, TX.
The TK (Tom Kirkland) Baptist Church was named for him.
Tom and Laura had three children: Thomas Augustus "Bones" Kirkland, Jr., Mattie
Matilda Kirkland who married Howard J. Barrett, MD., and Archibald Lumpkin "Lump"
Kirkland (Find a Grave 2018a).

Limestone County official property records confirm that the TK Church and Cemetery
parcel was set aside by Laura A. Kirkland in 1930 for public use as a Baptist church and
cemetery (LCOPR Vol. 299, page 529), though the church and cemetery located on this parcel
date from Thomas A. Kirkland’s earlier organization of the TK Baptist church circa 1908 and his
death in 1914. As stipulated in Laura A. Kirkland’s dedication of this parcel in 1930, the 2.15-

HJN 150184 AR 03

35

Chapter 4.0: Archival Research

acre TK Church and Cemetery lot dimensions were 434.0 x 216.0 feet (132.3 x 65.8 m), with the
434.0-foot (132.3 m-) boundaries extending to the center of a public road (now FM 939). Since
1930, the church and cemetery parcel appear to have been continuously used by the Kirkland
family as well as other members of the local church and community.
Topographic quadrangle maps depicting the location of the TK Cemetery note the
presence of an associated church building to the southwest of the cemetery boundary (see
Figures 1-2 and 4-1). An old photograph of Thomas Kirkland, Sr.’s gravesite found on his Find
a Grave entry depicts this small church building in the background behind his crypt and
headstone (Figure 4-10). Matching the alignment of Kirkland’s crypt and headstone on Google
Earth imagery (Figure 4-11), it is clear that the church, although no longer present, was once
located to the southwest of the cemetery, outside of the current Project Area boundaries. The
locations of the TK Church and Cemetery are clearly depicted on 2 editions of the USGS Axtell,
TX topographic quadrangle map (Figures 4-12 and 4-13), though their actual locations and
dimensions are more clearly depicted on a 1955 USGS aerial photograph (Figure 4-14).
After 1930, the separate nature of this 2.15-acre tract was confirmed in several
subsequent deed records pertaining to changes in ownership of the surrounding Kirkland family
lands. For instance, the 2.15-acre tract was specifically excluded when Thomas A. Kirkland, Jr.
transferred his interest in the surrounding 59.69-acre tract to his brother Archie L. Kirkland
following their sister Mattie K. (Kirkland) Barrett’s death in 1954 (McLennan County Official
Public records (MCOPR) Vol. 775, page 457). The 2.15-acre “Tekay Church and Cemetery”
tract is similarly excluded from the First Tract conveyed by Jim B. Horn to himself in 1997 as
Trustee of the Jim B. Horn Revocable Living Trust (MCOPR Document No. 9728638, Vol 202,
page 329), though Horn’s 1997 property description records the boundaries of the Tekay
Church and Cemetery as being 381.0 x 214.0 feet (116.1 x 65.2 m), an area somewhat less
than the 2.15 acres set aside by Laura A. Kirkland in 1930.
While the 214.0-foot (65.2 m-) width of the church and cemetery parcel is reduced by 2.0
feet (0.6 m) from the 1930 description, the greater reduction in the parcel depth from 434.0 feet
to 381.0 feet (132.3 m to 116.1 m) appears to have occurred outside the Project Area where the
church and cemetery parcel meets the northern boundary of the FM 939 right-of-way.
Comparison of the 1955 USGS aerial photo (see Figure 4-13) to the recent aerial imagery (see
Figure 4-10) indicates the area used for the TK Cemetery was expanded after 1955 toward the
church building. Otherwise, the overall boundaries of the church and cemetery property that
abut the Project Area boundaries appear to remain largely unchanged since the mid-1950s.

PROBABILITY ASSESSMENT

Prehistoric archeological sites are commonly found in upland areas and on alluvial
terraces near stream/river channels or drainages. Based on presence of Horse Creek within the
Project Area, in conjunction with the presence of Watt’s sites 2 and 3 to the southwest of
the Project Area on Williams Creek, it was Horizon’s opinion prior to the field efforts that there
existed a moderate to high potential for undocumented prehistoric cultural deposits within the
Project Area.

In regard to historic-era resources, the lack of visible structures within the confines of the
Project Area on modern and historic topographic quadrangle maps suggested a decreased
potential for standing historic-era domestic or agricultural structures within the Project Area.
However, based on the presence of a railroad grade across the Project Area on maps dating as
early as 1920, as well as the presence of several domestic structures and the TK Cemetery and
church just outside of the Project Area boundaries on these maps, it was Horizon’s opinion prior
to the field efforts that there also existed a moderate to high potential for associated historic-era
cultural deposits within the boundaries of the Project Area.

5.0 SURVEY METHODOLOGY

In an effort to document all cultural resources (subsurface and aboveground) within the
Project Area that were 45 years of age or older, two 2-person Horizon archeological field crews
conducted the survey of the Project Area between 25 and 28 September 2018. This entailed
intensive surface inspection and subsurface shovel testing efforts over the extent of the 351.0
acres comprising the Project Area. The TSMASS require a minimum of 1 shovel test per 3.0
acres for acreage projects over 200.0 acres in size. This equated to a minimum of 117 shovel
tests over the 351.0-acre Project Area in order to meet the TSMASS. Horizon exceeded the
TSMASS by excavating a total of 241 shovel tests within the Project Area (Figures 5-1 through
5-4). All excavated matrices were screened through 0.25-inch (6.3-millimeter [mm]) hardware
mesh or were trowel-sorted if the dense clay soils prohibited successful screening.
In addition, to the shovel testing efforts, Horizon excavated a total of 5 backhoe trenches
within alluvial settings along the western bank of Horse Creek where the proposed development
had the potential to impact deeply buried cultural deposits, if present (Figure 5-5). On average,
these trenches measured approximately 4.4 m (14.4 feet) in length and 0.6 m (2.0 feet) wide
(i.e., the bucket width). They were each initially excavated to a depth of approximately 1.2 m
(4.0 feet) in order to allow safe access for field personnel to document the upper extent of the
trench profiles. This included cleaning and analyzing one profile of each trench, followed by the
sketching and photographing of the profile. Subsequent to the documentation of the upper
profile, the trenches were then excavated to an average depth of 1.6 m (5.2 feet) to prospect for
cultural deposits within the deeper reaches of the location. The field crew did not enter any
trench after it was excavated deeper than 1.2 m (4.0 feet) in compliance with standard safety
regulations. The field archeologists monitored all backhoe excavations, and trench walls and
floors, as well as spoil piles, were visually inspected during and after excavation for evidence of
cultural materials (e.g. chert debris or tools, burned rock, preserved bone, charred plant
remains), distinctive stratigraphic anomalies, and/or soil discolorations that could be indicative of
past cultural activities. A sample of backfill removed from each BHT was screened through 1/4inch (6.0-mm) hardware mesh during trench excavation (approximately one 5.0-gallon bucket
from every fifth backhoe bucket load). As these were survey-level investigations, so soil
samples were recovered for flotation or other special assessments.
Field notes were maintained on terrain, vegetation, soils, land forms, shovel tests,
backhoe trenches, and cultural materials observed (if any). Standardized shovel test forms
were completed for every shovel test, and standardized backhoe trench forms were completed

for every excavated backhoe trench. These forms included location data, depth, soil type, and
notations on any artifacts encountered. If any new archeological sites were recorded, standard
site forms were to be completed and filed at the Texas Archeological Research Laboratory
(TARL) for permanent housing. Similarly, if any previously recorded archeological sites were
assessed, updated site forms were to be completed and filed at TARL.
Digital photographs of the Project Area, sites, and artifacts, along with a photo-log, were
completed as appropriate. The locations of all shovel tests and backhoe trenches were
recorded via handheld global positioning system (GPS) units utilizing the Universal Transverse
Mercator (UTM) coordinate system and the North American Datum of 1983 (NAD 83) (see
Figures 5-1 and 5-2). Shovel test data are presented in Appendix A, and backhoe trench data
are provided in Appendix B.
A selective collection strategy was utilized during the survey efforts wherein only
diagnostic cultural materials were to be collected for eventual curation at an approved facility.
Non-diagnostic artifacts were to be tabulated, assessed, and photographed in the field and
placed back where they were found. In the case of the current investigations, the only artifacts
collected for examination and photographing consist of 2 telephone insulator fragments, one
amethyst glass bottle neck, one amethyst glass bottle lid, one small bottle, and one metal clip.
Photographs of these specimens are included later in the text. All other artifacts were assessed
in the field and left on the site on which they were observed. While photographs of most of the
non-collected specimens are presented later in the text in association with the relevant site
descriptions, photographs of all discarded artifacts are presented in Appendix C.
All recovered artifacts and records produced during the investigations are to be curated
at TARL in accordance with the TAC Permit-Terms and Conditions and 13 TAC Section 26.17.

6.0 RESULTS

The cultural resources survey of the Project Area resulted in the documentation of 6
newly recorded archeological sites (41ML324, 41LT481, 41LT482, 41LT483, 41LT484, and
41ML325). Each of these sites is discussed separately below.

6.1

41ML324
General Description

Site 41ML324 is a newly recorded historic-era archeological site that was documented
as the remnants of a mid-20th century farmstead that is currently evidenced by a debris scatter
and cattle corral (Figures 6-1 and 6-2). It is located within an upland cattle pasture in the
southeastern corner of the Project Area, just east of FM 939 (Figure 6-3). Vegetation consists
of dense short grasses and weeds along with scattered mature blackjack oak and hackberry
trees (Figure 6-4).
The site currently consists of a corral constructed from wooden planks, corrugated
metal, and wire nails, as well as an associated debris scatter. According to historic topographic
maps, a house was present northwest of the site in 1956 (Figure 6-5). Additionally, what
appears to be a barn immediately northwest of the corral can be seen on recent aerial imagery
(Figure 6-6). By 2015, the barn structure had been razed. A scatter of brick, concrete, and
wooden posts was observed on the surface within the corral and in the surrounding area. This
structural debris scatter likely represents remnants of the house and barn structures. No
foundation was observed in the area where the house structure once stood.
A total of 6 shovel tests were excavated on this site, and all produced negative results
for subsurface cultural materials. All observed cultural materials on the site were restricted to
surface contexts.
Observed Cultural Materials
Other than structural debris within and around the corral feature, no artifacts were found
in association with the farmstead. Structural debris included 50+ red bricks, 1 concrete pipe
fragment, scattered concrete fragments, and wooden planks (Figures 6-7 and 6-8).

Cultural Features
The only cultural feature present on the site consists of the corral constructed from
wooden planks, wire nails, and corrugated metal. The corral consists of a rectangular pen
measuring 75.0 feet (22.9 m) east-west by 40.0 feet (12.2 m) north-south and an adjacent
circular holding pen measuring 30.0 feet (9.1 m) in diameter.
Horizontal and Vertical Extents of the Cultural Materials
Based on the extent of the observed cultural materials, the assessed horizontal extent of
the site measures approximately 200.0 feet (60.9 m) north-south by 155.0 feet (47.2 m) eastwest.
Based on the lack of recovered subsurface materials from the 6 shovel tests excavated
on the site, the vertical extent of the site appears to be confined only to surface contexts.
Property History
The site is located within a 100-acre tract of Kirkland family ranch lands dating from their
period of ownership in the early to mid-20th century. No evidence of the corral or other
improvements are referenced in the deed records for this tract and no evidence of buildings or
other structures appears on the 1920 USGS “Mart, TX” topographic quadrangle (see Figure 47). After the tract was acquired by Jim B. Horn in 1946, a 1955 USGS aerial photo (Figure 6-9)
and the 1956 USGS “Axtell, TX” topographic quadrangle (see Figure 6-5) depict a residential
dwelling along FM 939 and approximately 300 feet northwest of Site 41ML324. However, the
corral is not depicted at that time nor on the subsequent USGS 1978 revision of the Axtell, TX
quadrangle map.
Summary
Site 41ML324 was documented as the remnants of a mid-20th century farmstead that is
currently evidenced by a debris scatter and cattle corral. While several structures were once
present on this same tract at least as early as 1955, all but the currently standing cattle corral
have been removed from the site.
Property history records associate the property with the Kirkland family in the early to
mid-20th century. The buildings and structures on this property appear to be associated instead
with the Jim B. Horn period of ownership between 1946 and 1997. Horn is believed to have
been a non-resident owner who lived and worked in Waco.
The site generally represents agricultural land use traditions in the area that date from
the 19th century and continue today. There is no archival evidence to associate the
archeological remains of the site with the T.A. Kirkland family who were founding members of
the local community. Instead, Site 41ML324 is associated with the post-WWII ownership of Jim
B. Horn, a local area World War II veteran believed to have worked and lived in Waco.
Consequently, the site does not appear to qualify for NRHP eligibility under either Criterion A or
B.

Based on the lack of aboveground architecture and the lack of subsurface cultural
deposits, it is also Horizon’s opinion that site 41ML324 is ineligible for inclusion in the NRHP
under Criteria C and D. Thus, it is Horizon’s opinion that site 41ML324 is ineligible for inclusion
in the NRHP or for formal designation as an SAL, and that no further investigations are
warranted on this site in connection with the proposed undertaking.

6.2

41LT481
General Description

Site 41LT481 is a newly recorded historic-era archeological site that was documented as
the remnants of a segment of the dismantled late-19th to mid-20th century St. Louis
Southwestern Railway, an associated railroad bridge over Horse Creek, and an adjacent
telephone line (Figure 6-10; see also Figure 6-1). The site stretches across gently undulating
ridges and the floodplain of Horse Creek within the northern extent of the Project Area.
Vegetation along the railroad berm consists of short grasses, weeds and gravels, while
vegetation adjacent to the berm consists of heavily forested areas. A 2-track road is located on
top of the railroad berm. On the southwest end of the site, the railroad berm appears to have
been pushed apart into 2 smaller berms paralleling each side of the 2-track road. (Figures 6-11
and 6-12). A total of 19 shovel tests were excavated along the length of this site. Of these, only
1 produced cultural materials (clear glass) from subsurface contexts.

Site 50 Landfill Project in McLennan and Limestone Counties, Texas

The site consists of the remnants of the St. Louis Southwestern Railway and its
associated bridge and telephone line. The St. Louis Southwestern Railway, also known as the
Cotton Belt, was constructed in the late 19th century to carry cotton from Texas to St. Louis,
Missouri (TSHA 2018b). The railroad appears on topographic maps as late as 1978. A large
grass-covered berm stands 5.0 to 10.0 feet (1.5 to 3.0 m) high where the railroad was once
present, and a 2-track road is now located on top of the berm (see Figures 6-11 and 6-12).
Scattered railroad ties, spikes and large pieces of ballast were observed scattered along the
sides of the dismantled railroad berm. A telephone line paralleled the northwestern side of the
railroad, and some wooden posts associated with the telephone line are still standing. Several
glass insulators were also observed scattered along the berm from the telephone line.
Remnants of a wooden railroad bridge that crossed Horse Creek are present along the banks of
the creek and within the creek itself. These remnants include 6 rows of wooden pillars and
large wooden rectangular beams.
Observed Cultural Materials
Cultural materials observed on site 41LT481 consist of a low to moderate density scatter
of wooden railroad ties, railroad spikes, ballast, wooden telephone line poles, "AM. TEL & TEL
CO." aqua and green glass insulators, clear glass shards, and 2 pieces of glazed stoneware
(Figures 6-13 through 6-15). The glass insulators were produced for the American Telephone &
Telegraph Company by the Brookfield Glass Company from the late 1880s to 1920 (MAGWV
2018).
Cultural Features
Cultural features present on the site consist of the remnants of a late 19th to mid-20th
century dismantled railroad, a railroad bridge, a power/telephone line, and a 2-track road.
Remnants of the railroad include a grass-covered berm standing from 5.0 to 10.0 feet (1.5 to 3.0
m) high in some areas along with scattered railroad ballast, iron spikes, and wooden ties. The
2-track road is located on top of the grass berm (see Figure 6-12). A telephone line parallels
the northwestern edge of the railroad berm, and a few standing wooden poles from the
telephone line are still present (Figure 6-16). Additionally, aqua and green glass "AM. TEL &
TEL CO." insulators were found scattered along the railroad berm from the telephone line. All
that remains of the railroad bridge, which is located over Horse Creek, are approximately 6 rows
of round wooden pillars and large rectangular wooden beams (Figures 6-17 and 6-18). These
pillars measure approximately 1.5 feet (0.5 m) in diameter and stand 1.0 to 4.0 feet (0.3 to 1.2
m) above the ground surface.
Each row of wooden pillars contains 5 pillars spaced
approximately 3.0 feet (0.9 m) apart.
Horizontal and Vertical Extents of the Cultural Materials
Based on the extent of the observed cultural materials/features, the assessed horizontal
extent of the site measures approximately 5200.0 feet (1584.9 m) northeast-southwest by 131.0
feet (40.0 m) northwest-southeast. Most materials on the site were found in surface contexts,
although one shovel test did produce a fragment of glass from between 0.0 and 5.9 inches (0.0
and 15.0 cm) below surface.

Summary
Site 41LT481 was documented as the remnants of a segment of the dismantled late19th to mid-20th century St. Louis Southwestern Railway, an associated railroad bridge over
Horse Creek, and an adjacent telephone line. While the railroad berm, some bridge pilings, and
several telephone poles are still present, the majority of the materials once comprising this
segment of railroad (i.e., the railroad ties, rails, etc.) have been removed from the site. In their
place, the surface of the railroad berm is now utilized as a 2-track road across the property.
Based on the fact that most of the material once comprising the site has been removed
and what remains is confined primarily to scattered surface contexts, it is Horizon’s opinion that
site 41LT481 is ineligible for inclusion in the NRHP under Criteria C and D. Additionally, given
the sparsity of materials on the site and the absence of standing structures, it is unlikely that any
possible association with persons or events of historic importance would be sufficient to
establish significance under Criteria A or B of the NRHP. Thus, it is Horizon’s opinion that site
41LT481 is ineligible for inclusion in the NRHP or for formal designation as an SAL, and that no
further investigations are warranted on this site in connection with the proposed undertaking.

6.3

41LT482
General Description

Site 41LT482 was documented as a moderate-density prehistoric campsite located on a
wooded terrace adjacent to Horse Creek (Figure 6-19; see also Figure 6-1). It is located in the
northern extent of the Project Area, north of the railroad grade comprising site 41LT481, west of
Horse Creek, and just south of the confluence of 2 tributaries comprising the headwaters of
Horse Creek. Vegetation consists of mature blackjack oak, hackberry, elm, cedar, greenbrier,
and various weeds and grasses (Figures 6-20 and 6-21). Due to the dense vegetation, no
cultural materials were observed on the surface of the site, although several fragments of firecracked rock (FCR) were noted in the adjacent channel of Horse Creek.
A total of 13 shovel tests were excavated across this site. Of these, a total of 5
produced cultural materials from subsurface contexts. Additionally, a total of 2 backhoe
trenches were excavated on the site. Despite of the presence of lithic materials within the
shovel tests, no evidence of intact cultural deposits was noted within either of the 2 backhoe
trenches.
Observed Cultural Materials
Observed cultural materials on site 41LT482 consist entirely of aboriginal lithic
specimens. These include chert debitage in the form of 10 secondary and 15 tertiary thinning
flakes and approximately 25 fragments of FCR (Figures 6-22 and 6-23). No visible evidence of
preserved floral or faunal remains (e.g. charred plant materials or preserved bone) and no
temporally diagnostic artifacts were observed during the evaluation of site 41LT482.

Cultural Features
No evidence of any intact cultural features was observed on the modern ground surface,
within any of the 13 shovel tests excavated on site 41LT482, or within either of the 2 excavated
backhoe trenches. However, the presence of FCR from several shovel tests on the site
suggests that thermal features may have been present on the site at one time.
Horizontal and Vertical Extents of the Cultural Materials
Based on the extent of the observed cultural materials within the excavated shovel tests,
the assessed horizontal extent of the site measures approximately 236.2 feet (72.0 m) northsouth by 160.7 feet (49.0 m) east-west.
Based on the subsurface shovel testing efforts, the vertical extent of the site ranges
primarily between 0.0 and 11.8 inches (0.0 and 30.0 cm) below surface. This depth range was
noted in 4 of the 5 positive shovel tests on the site. One test did result in a column of deposits
ranging between 0.0 and 2.0 feet (0.0 and 60.0 cm) below surface. However, this stratigraphic
sequence was not replicated in any of the other shovel tests and was not evidenced in either of
the 2 excavated backhoe trenches on the site.
The shovel test with the deepest recovered cultural deposits (BS24) is located on the
eastern edge of the site overlooking a 20.0 foot (6.1 m) drop down to Horse Creek. This shovel
test produced 33 FCR fragments and 12 chert flakes between 0.0 and 2.0 feet (0.0 and 60.0
cm) below surface. An adjacent shovel test to the west (FD28) produced 1 chert flake between
0.0 and 7.0 inches (0.0 and 20.0 cm) below surface, while 2 shovel tests to the east (BS24 and
BS25) and a shovel test (FD24) and backhoe trench (BHT-3) to the southwest produced
negative results for subsurface cultural materials. The remaining 3 positive tests on the site
collectively produced 2 FCR specimens and 5 chert flakes from depths between 0.0 and 11.8
inches (0.0 and 30.0 cm) below surface. This indicates that the deposits across the site are
generally shallow and sparse with the exception of the extreme eastern area of the site
remaining within the small portion of the site immediately adjacent to Horse Creek.
The field crew indicated that this site is on the high terrace that is roughly 20.0 feet (6.1
m) above of Horse Creek. Horse Creek has visibly eroded the northeastern and southeastern
edges of the site, and the crew noted that the site likely extended further to the northeast and
southeast in the past but have since been eroded away. Currently, all that remains of the
deeper deposits on the site is a small strip of the terrace that currently borders the creek.
Based on the shovel testing and backhoe trenching data, the quantity of depth of the associated
cultural materials decrease as one moves west across the site.
Summary
Site 41LT482 was documented as a prehistoric campsite that, without the presence of
diagnostic implements or preserved/datable charred materials, cannot currently be assigned to
a defined temporal period within prehistory. Given its location on Horse Creek, it is potentially
associated with the hunting and gathering rounds of the same groups that occupied Watt’s sites
2 and 3, which he documented to the southeast of the current Project Area. The site is

HJN 150184 AR 03

Chapter 6.0: Results

evidenced by a moderate-density subsurface scatter of lithic debitage and FCR primarily
between 0.0 and 11.8 inches (0.0 and 30.0 cm) below surface, but with a small area of deeper
deposits on the eastern edge of the creek that range down to a depth of 2.0 feet (60.0 cm)
below surface. No intact cultural features were observed; however, the presence of FCR
fragments from shovel tests on the site surface suggests that features may have been present
at one time. This may also indicate that the site likely served as a formal campsite where food
was prepared via thermal features. No preserved flora or fauna remains (e.g. charred plant
remains or preserved bone) and no temporally diagnostic artifacts were recovered from the site.
Based on the generally shallow nature of the observed subsurface cultural deposits on
the site, the lack of temporally diagnostic implements, the lack of observed cultural features, and
the lack of visibly preserved floral/faunal remains, it is Horizon’s opinion that site 41LT482 is
ineligible for inclusion in the NRHP or for formal designation as an SAL. With this in mind, it is
Horizon’s further opinion that no further investigations are warranted on this site in connection
with the currently proposed undertaking.

6.4

41LT483
General Description

Site 41LT483 was documented as a high-density, surficial scatter of late 19th to mid-20th
century domestic debris (Figure 6-24; see also Figure 6-1). It is located on a wooded interfluve
north of the confluence of 2 tributaries of Horse Creek on the extreme northern edge of the
Project Area. Vegetation consists of scattered blackjack oak, hackberry, yaupon, various
weeds, grasses, and greenbrier (Figure 6-25). A total of 7 shovel tests were excavated on this
site. All 7 produced negative results for subsurface cultural materials.
All cultural materials observed on this site consist of domestic debris such as bottle
fragments, plate and other ceramic fragments, and metal fragments. A review of historic
topographic maps dating as early as 1920 revealed no evidence of any nearby structures, and
no evidence of any structural foundations were observed on the site. While one brick fragment
and one wire nail were noted within the scatter, no other structural debris was present on the
site, suggesting that the debris scatter represents a historic-era dumpsite rather than an
occupation.
Observed Cultural Materials
Materials observed on site 41LT483 consist of a high-density scatter of historic-era
domestic debris including aqua glass, amber glass, green glass, blue glass, amethyst glass, 1
square aqua glass bottle base, 1 complete aqua glass bottle, multiple glass bottle necks,
whiteware fragments, several glazed stoneware jug sherds, 1 red brick fragment, 1 square nail
fragment, and numerous metal pieces (Figures 6-26 through 6-32).
Observed metal included 1 decorative cast iron stove foot, 1 cast iron handle, 1
horseshoe, and various unidentifiable objects (see Figure 6-29).

red floral design. One large plate fragment contained an impressed maker’s mark on the back
reading “Trenton China Co. Trenton, N.J.” The Trento China Company ran from 1859 to 1891
and specialized in production white decorative china (see Figure 6-28) (Barber 2018).
One flat, round clear glass bottle closure with heavy patination was also found on the
site. This type of bottle closure would have been held down with a metal clamp to seal the
bottle or jar (see Figure 6-31).
One complete bottle on the site appears to be a shoe polish bottle made from green
glass. Glass bottle necks observed on the site included one amber glass bottle top, one clear
glass bottle top, and one amethyst glass bottle top. All 3 bottle tops are broken at the shoulders
and have a straight brandy or wine style finish. The amethyst bottle top has a more ornate style
and billowing neck, more commonly seen on liquor bottles. Its amethyst color suggests a pre1915 manufacture date (Munsey 1970). The 3 bottle tops have a fading vertical side mold seam
that terminates at the top of the neck on each bottle, suggesting they are all machine-made
specimens dating to around 1900 (Cleveland 1988; Megura 1991).
The 1 complete bottle found on the site consisted of a small cylindrical aqua glass bottle.
The bottle is embossed with “971” on the base, and the vertical side mold seam fades at the
neck, dating the bottle prior to around 1900 (Cleveland 1988; Megura 1991).
Cultural Features
No evidence of any intact cultural features was observed on the surface of the site or
within any of the 7 excavated shovel tests.
Horizontal and Vertical Extents of the Cultural Materials
Based on the extent of the observed cultural materials on the surface of the site, the
assessed horizontal extent of the site measures approximately 311.6 feet (95.0 m) north-south
by 170.6 feet (52.0 m) east-west.
The vertical extent of the site is confined strictly to surface contexts.
Summary
Site 41LT483 is consists of a high-density, surficial scatter of late 19th to mid-20th
century domestic debris in the extreme northern extent of the Project Area. A review of historic
topographic maps dating as early as 1920 revealed no evidence of any nearby structures, and
no evidence of any structural foundations was observed on the site. While 1 brick fragment and
1 wire nail were noted within the scatter, no other structural debris was present on the site,
suggesting that the debris scatter represents a historic-era dumpsite rather than an occupation.
Based on the lack of aboveground architecture and the surficial nature of the domestic
debris, it is Horizon’s opinion that site 41LT483 is ineligible for inclusion in the NRHP under
Criteria C and D. Additionally, refuse dumps that are not associated with a nearby occupation
can seldom be associated with events or persons of historic importance under Criteria A and B

Site 50 Landfill Project in McLennan and Limestone Counties, Texas

of the NRHP. Because of this, it is Horizon’s opinion that site 41LT483 is ineligible for inclusion
in the NRHP or for formal designation as an SAL, and that no further investigations are
warranted on this site in connection with the currently proposed undertaking.

41LT484
General Description

Site 41LT484 is another newly recorded historic-era archeological site that was
documented as the remnants of a late 19th to mid-20th century farmstead that is currently
evidenced by several debris scatters and a brick well or cistern (Figure 6-33; see also Figure 61). It is located on a lightly wooded ridge on the east side of Horse Creek on the northeastern
portion of the Project Area. The native vegetation appears to have been cleared in the past.
Scattered mesquite, hackberry, greenbrier, pencil cholla, and various grasses and weeds are
now prevalent across the site (Figures 6-34 and 6-35).
Currently, the site consists of a moderate-density scatter of historic-era domestic debris;
2 piles of structural debris composed of wooden planks, corrugated metal, brick, and concrete;
and an intact red-brick well or cistern. A review of historic topographic maps dating as early as
1920 revealed no evidence of any structures at this location, but the piles of structural debris
suggest that at least 1 structure was present on the site at one time.
A total of 9 shovel tests were excavated on the site, and 5 of these were positive for
subsurface cultural materials between 0.0 to 11.8 inches (0.0 and 30.0 cm) below surface.
However, the majority of artifacts were observed in surface contexts on the site.
Observed Cultural Materials
Cultural materials on the site consist of a scatter of domestic debris over the site and 2
piles of structural debris. The observed domestic debris includes a moderate-density scatter of
clear glass shards, amber glass shards, blue glass shards, amethyst glass shards, rose glass
shards, aqua glass shards (heavily patinated), 1 small clear glass bottle top that is broken at the
neck, 1 clear glass bottle base embossed with “1915”, windowpane glass, 1 metal belt buckle,
various unidentifiable metal pieces, whiteware sherds, glazed stoneware sherds, and 1 blue
glass insulator fragment (Figures 6-36 through 6-38). The mold seam on the clear glass bottle
neck ends below the finished neck, suggesting a manufacture date around 1900 (Cleveland
1988; Megura 1991). Similarly, the amethyst glass shards suggest a pre-1915 presence at the
site (Munsey 1970).
The structural debris observed within the 2 separate piles includes various bricks,
corrugated metal, wooden planks, concrete fragments, wire nails, and 1 concrete block stamped
with 2 lines of text (Figures 6-39 through 6-42). These lines are truncated on the left side of the
block, leaving behind “ITY” on the top line and “ACO” on the bottom line (Figure 6-43). It is
probable that these read “CITY OF WACO”, although the function of the concrete block is
currently unknown.

Cultural Features
The only intact cultural feature present on the site consists of a well or cistern
constructed from red Corsicana and Cole bricks and concrete mortar (Figure 6-44). The
aboveground portion of the well or cistern measures approximately 11.8 inches (30.0 cm) tall
from the modern ground surface and 36.6 inches (93.0 cm) in diameter. The upper lip of the
well (cistern) appears to have been truncated over time, as a layer of mortar is still present on
the upper layer of bricks. Wooden 2x4 boards have been nailed down to the top of the well to
serve as a cover. No evidence of an inscribed date within the mortar was noted on this feature.
Below ground, the well or cistern opens up into a bell shape and measures
approximately 16.4 feet (5.0 m) deep (Figure 6-45). The interior walls of the well or cistern
below surface are lined with brick, some of which has begun to collapse. A coil of barbed wire
is present at the base of the feature.
Horizontal and Vertical Extents of the Cultural Materials
Based on the extent of the observed cultural materials on the surface of the site, the
assessed horizontal extent of the site measures approximately 344.4 feet (105.0 m) northeastsouthwest by 170.6 feet (52.0 m) northwest-southeast.
The vertical extent of the site appears to be confined predominantly to surface
contexts. However, shovel testing efforts did indicate a layer of shallow, subsurface cultural
deposits on the site between 0.0 and 11.8 inches (0.0 to 30.0 cm) below surface.
Property History
Site 41LT484 is located within a 339.7-acre tract of agricultural land bequeathed by
Laura A. Kirkland to her daughter Mattie K. (Kirkland) Barrett in 1930 (LCOPR Vol. 299/ Page
529), part of a larger 435.6-acre tract acquired by Jim B. Horn from the Veterans Land Board in
1946 (Limestone County Real Property Record No. R3094). Property history records reviewed
for this site revealed no evidence of direct occupation by the Kirklands or the Horns in the 20th
century. The land appears to have been used instead for agricultural purposes by Mattie K.
(Kirkland) Barrett’s brothers, Thomas A. and Archie L. Kirkland, who lived elsewhere in the
Tekay community. Horizon’s review of historic-period topographic maps and aerial photographs
indicate the first evidence of building construction near Site 41LT484 occurs on a 1955 USGS
aerial photograph (Figure 6-46). In this photograph, a single agricultural barn is located
approximately 650.0 feet (198.1 m) southeast of the railroad bridge over Horse Creek and
approximately 100.0 feet (30.5 m) south of the well site. No evidence of a well or a windmill at
this location is apparent on the 1955 USGS aerial photograph, the 1956 Axtell TX topographic
quadrangle map, or the subsequent 1978 revision of the 1956 Axtell, TX quadrangle map.
Summary
Site 41LT484 was documented as the remnants of a late 19th to mid-20th century
farmstead that is currently evidenced by a debris scatter, 2 piles of structural debris, and a bricklined well or cistern. Property history records associate this site generally with the ranching

activities of the Kirkland family in the early to mid-20th century and later with that of Jim and
Tant Horn after 1946. While a 1955 aerial photograph shows a single agricultural barn located
approximately 650.0 feet (198.1 m) southeast of the railroad bridge over Horse Creek and
approximately 100.0 feet (30.5 m) south of the well site, no evidence of a well or a windmill is
apparent on the 1955 USGS aerial photograph, the 1956 Axtell TX topographic quadrangle map
or the subsequent 1978 revision of the 1956 Axtell, TX quadrangle map.
The site generally represents agricultural land use traditions in the area that date from
the 19th century and continue today. Property history records associate the site with the T.A.
Kirkland family who used this land for ranching and were founding members of the local Tekay
community. There is no evidence that any of the Kirklands lived at this site. The Kirklands’, most
notably T.A. Kirkland, Sr.’s, contributions to the local community are represented locally in the
surviving TK Church and Cemetery, located outside the western boundary of the Project Area.
Consequently, the site represents the Kirklands’ general agricultural use of the land but is not
closely associated with Thomas A. Kirkland, Sr.’s most important contributions to the local
community and does not appear to qualify for NRHP eligibility under either Criterion A or B.
Based on the lack of aboveground architecture and the lack of subsurface cultural
deposits, it is also Horizon’s opinion that site 41LT484 is ineligible for inclusion in the NRHP
under Criteria C and D. Thus, it is Horizon’s opinion that site 41LT484 is ineligible for inclusion
in the NRHP or for formal designation as an SAL, and that no further investigations are
warranted on this site in connection with the proposed undertaking.

41ML325
General Description

Site 41ML325 was documented as a mid-20th century cattle corral (Figure 6-47). The
feature is located on a flat upland area, approximately 82.0 feet (25.0 m) northwest of an
abandoned railroad grade (Site 41LT481) on the northwestern portion of the Project Area. The
area surrounding the site has been moderately disturbed by the construction and use of
mountain bike trails. Vegetation consists of short and medium grasses, sparse mesquite and
oak trees, and various thorny brush (Figures 6-48 and 6-49). A total of 6 shovel tests were
excavated on this site, and all 6 produced negative results for subsurface cultural materials.
The corral on site 41ML325 has been fashioned predominantly from repurposed railroad
ties taken from the nearby segment of the St. Louis Southwest Railway that extends through the
Project Area. According to the Texas State Historical Association (TSHA 2018b), segments of
the St. Louis Southwest Railway were abandoned between 1933 and 1972, placing the date at
which the railroad ties were acquired for the corral somewhere within that mid-20th century time
frame.
Observed Cultural Materials
Cultural materials observed on site 41ML325 consist only of the railroad ties,
dimensional lumber, and wire nails used to construct the corral and chute. No associated
cultural materials were observed in surface contexts around the feature of within any of the 6
shovel tests excavated on the site.
Cultural Features
The only feature comprising site 41ML325 consists of a slightly dilapidated wooden
corral. It is oriented northwest to southeast and has a roughly square footprint measuring
approximately 12.0 by 12.0 feet (3.7 by 3.7 m). The vertical support posts are fashioned from
repurposed railroad ties from the nearby abandoned segment of the St. Louis Southwest
Railway, while the siding materials consist of dimensional lumber of varying sizes (Figure 6-50).
There is a 3.5-foot- (1.1-m-) wide opening with a plank ladder on the western corner of the
northwestern façade (Figure 6-51). Fastening materials consist of modern wire nails.
Horizontal and Vertical Extents of the Cultural Materials
The assessed horizontal extent of the site measures approximately 82.0 feet (25.0 m)
north-south by 75.5 m (23.0 m) east-west.
The vertical extent of the site is confined strictly to surface contexts.
Summary
Site 41ML325 was documented as a mid-20th century corral that has been fashioned
predominantly from repurposed railroad ties taken from the nearby segment of the St. Louis
Southwest Railway that extends through the Project Area. Segments of the St. Louis Southwest

Railway were abandoned between 1933 and 1972, placing the date at which the railroad ties
were acquired for the corral somewhere within that mid-20th century time frame. Aside from the
corral feature, no other cultural materials were noted on the site.
Based on the common nature of the corral feature and the lack of associated cultural
deposits, it is Horizon’s opinion that site 41ML325 is ineligible for inclusion in the NRHP under
Criteria C and D. Moreover, given the modern date of the feature, it is unlikely that any possible
association with persons or events of historic importance would be sufficient to establish
significance under Criterion A or B of the NRHP. Thus, it is Horizon’s opinion that site 41ML325
is ineligible for inclusion in the NRHP or for formal designation as an SAL, and that no further
investigations are warranted on this site in connection with the proposed undertaking.

6.7

ISOLATED FINDS

In addition to the 6 newly recorded archeological sites, the field crew also made note of
2 isolated finds. The first consists of a primary chert flake noted within an artificially cut
drainage on the property (Figure 6-52). This specimen could have been a product of impromptu
prehistoric lithic reduction at the location or more recent modern manufacture during the artificial
drainage construction. There were no other associated specimens on the ground surface or
excavated shovel tests to warrant recording the location as a formal archeological site.
The second isolated specimen consist of a metal clip with a currently undefined function.
It is a small tin or aluminum clip stamped with an ornate “F” and “SAT, SEPT 10” on the front
face, a button-type fastener on the back face, and small teeth within the mouth of the clasp
(Figures 6-53 through 6-55). The date on the front suggests that it was created for a special
event of some type. Some have suggested that the item may be a suspender clasp, while
others have suggested it may be a lapel clip that could be attached to a buttonhole via the
button on the back and then used to hold a nametag or other similar item. This item was found
in a shovel test within a wooded area on the Project Area. No other associated items were
noted on the surface of the location and no other materials were recovered from shovel tests
excavated in the cardinal directions around this find. As such, it also was not formally recorded
as an archeological site.

6.8

TK CEMETERY

The TK (sometimes spelled Tekay) Cemetery is located outside of and adjacent to the
Project Area within a 2.15-acre parcel set aside from the Kirkland family’s surrounding lands in
1930 for public use as a Baptist church and cemetery (LCOPR Vol. 299, page 529). The church
and cemetery located on this parcel date from Thomas A. Kirkland, Sr.’s earlier organization of
the TK Baptist church (circa 1908) and his death in 1914. Deed records describing the 2.15acre church and cemetery parcel as it was set aside in 1930 specify that the property
dimensions at that time were 434.0 x 216.0 feet (132.3 x 65.8 m), with those dimensions
extending to the center of a public road (now FM 939). Since 1930, the church and cemetery
parcel appear to have been continuously used by the Kirkland family as well as other members
of the local church and community.

The separate nature of this 2.15-acre tract is reflected in subsequent deed records
pertaining to changes in ownership of the surrounding Kirkland family lands. For instance, the
tract was specifically identified and excluded when Thomas A. Kirkland, Jr. transferred his
interest in the surrounding 59.69-acre tract to his brother Archie L. Kirkland following their sister
Mattie K. (Kirkland) Barrett’s death in 1954 (McLennan County Official Public records (MCOPR)
Vol. 775, page 457). The 2.15-acre “Tekay Church and Cemetery” tract is similarly excluded
from the First Tract conveyed by Jim B. Horn to himself in 1997 as Trustee of the Jim B. Horn
Revocable Living Trust (MCOPR Document No. 9728638, Vol 202, page 329). Horn’s 1997
property description records the boundaries of the Tekay Church and Cemetery as being 381.0
x 214.0 feet (116.1 x 65.2 m), an area somewhat less than the 2.15 acres set aside by Laura A.
Kirkland in 1930. Though the 214.0-foot (65.2-m) width of the church and cemetery parcel is
reduced by 2.0 feet (0.6 m) from the 1930 description, the greater reduction in the parcel depth
from 434.0 feet to 381.0 feet (132.3 m to 116.1 m) appears to have occurred where the parcel
meets the northern boundary of the FM 939 right-of-way. Though no specific document was
found to confirm any easement or transfer of church and cemetery property to the county for
expansion of FM 939, review of historic maps and aerial photographs indicates that the other
boundaries of the church and cemetery property have remained largely unchanged since the
mid-1950s.
The locations of the TK Church and Cemetery are clearly depicted on 2 editions of the
USGS Axtell, TX topographic quadrangle map (see Figures 4-11 and 4-12), though their actual
locations and dimensions are more clearly depicted on a 1955 USGS aerial photograph (Figure
4-13). Comparison of the 1955 USGS aerial photo (see Figure 4-13) to the recent Google Earth
aerial imagery (see Figure 4-10) indicates the area used for the TK Cemetery was expanded
after 1955 toward the rear of the TK Church building. Otherwise, the overall boundaries of the
church and cemetery property that abut the Project Area boundaries appear to remain largely
unchanged since the mid-1950s.
In order to protect any unmarked graves that could potentially be present outside of
modern cemetery boundaries, the THC requires a construction buffer measuring at least 25.0
feet (7.6 m) away from the marked cemetery boundaries. As currently designed, all impacts
associated with the current undertaking are located outside of the required 25.0-foot (7.6-m)
buffer around the modern and mid-20th century boundaries of the TK Cemetery. Based on this,
it is Horizon’s opinion that the proposed impacts associated with the undertaking beyond the
THC’s required 25.0-foot (7.6-m) construction buffer will have no potential for adverse impacts
to any unmarked graves that could be present adjacent to the modern cemetery fencing.
Despite this, Horizon still recommends that some sort of visible demarcation be installed at the
25.0-foot (7.6-m) buffer distance around the cemetery boundaries to ensure that no accidental
impacts occur within the required buffer zone.

7.0 SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS

7.1

SUMMARY

Between 25 and 28 September 2018, Horizon conducted an intensive cultural resources
survey of the City of Waco’s proposed 351.0-acre Site 50 Landfill Project located northeast of
Waco in eastern McLennan County and northwestern Limestone County, Texas. The currently
proposed landfill design plan includes 2 waste disposal areas, a small complex of administrative
buildings, and connective roadways. The overall tract containing the development totals
approximately 502.5 acres in size. However, the noted waste disposal areas, buildings,
roadways, and all other ancillary disturbances associated with the undertaking total
approximately 351.0 acres within the overall 502.5-acre tract. For purposes of current
investigations and report, the 351.0 acres where proposed impacts will occur are considered to
be the Project Area.
As the proposed development would be owned by the City of Waco, a political
subdivision of the state of Texas, the project would fall under the jurisdiction of the ACT.
Additionally, impacts to any waters of the US on the tract would require the utilization of permits
issued by the USACE in compliance with Section 404 of the CWA. As a result, the portions of
the development within the purview of the USACE would also fall under the regulations of
Section 106 of the NHPA of 1966, as amended. At the request of LGRT, Horizon conducted the
cultural resources survey of the Project Area on behalf of the City of Waco in compliance with
the ACT and Section 106 of the NHPA. The purpose of the survey was to determine if any
significant archeological deposits are located within the Project Area and, if any exist, to
determine if the project has the potential to have any adverse effects on sites eligible for formal
designation as SALs or sites listed on or considered eligible for listing on the NRHP. The
cultural resources investigations were conducted under TAC permit no. 8566.
In an effort to document all cultural resources (subsurface and aboveground) within the
Project Area that were 45 years of age or older, Horizon conducted the survey of the Project
Area between 25 and 28 September 2018. This entailed intensive surface inspection and
subsurface shovel testing efforts over the extent of the 351.0 acres comprising the Project Area.
The TSMASS require a minimum of 1 shovel test per 3.0 acres for acreage projects over 200.0
acres in size. This equated to a minimum of 117 shovel tests over the 351.0-acre Project Area
in order to meet the TSMASS. Horizon exceeded the TSMASS by excavating a total of 241
shovel tests within the Project Area. In addition, Horizon excavated a total of 5 backhoe

trenches within alluvial settings along the western bank of Horse Creek where the proposed
development had the potential to impact deeply buried cultural deposits, if present.
The cultural resources survey of the Project Area resulted in the documentation of 6
newly recorded archeological sites (41ML324, 41LT481, 41LT482, 41LT483, 41LT484, and
41ML325). Five of the newly recorded sites are historic in nature. These include 2 historic-era
farmsteads (41ML324 and 41LT484), a segment of a historic-era railroad grade (41LT481), a
historic-era refuse dump (41LT483), and a historic-era corral feature (41ML325). It is Horizon’s
opinion that none of these 5 sites qualify for inclusion in the NRHP under Criteria A, B, or C nor
do they qualify for formal designations as SALs. The sixth site, 41LT482, was recorded as a
prehistoric campsite. It is Horizon’s opinion that this site does not qualify for inclusion in the
NRHP under Criterion D nor does is qualify for formal designation as a SAL.
In addition to the documentation of the 6 newly recorded archeological sites, the
investigations also resulted in an evaluation of the boundaries of the TK Cemetery located
immediately adjacent to the western boundary of the Project Area. In order to protect any
unmarked graves that could potentially be present outside of modern cemetery boundaries, the
THC requires a construction buffer measuring at least 25.0 feet (7.6 m) away from the marked
cemetery boundaries.
As currently designed, all impacts associated with the current
undertaking are located outside of the required 25.0-foot (7.6-m) buffer around the modern and
mid-20th century boundaries of the TK Cemetery. Based on this, it is Horizon’s opinion that the
proposed impacts associated with the undertaking beyond the THC’s required 25.0-foot (7.6-m)
construction buffer will have no potential for adverse impacts to any unmarked graves that could
be present adjacent to the modern cemetery fencing. Despite this, Horizon still recommends
that some sort of visible demarcation be installed at the 25.0-foot (7.6-m) buffer distance around
the cemetery boundaries to ensure that no accidental impacts occur within the required buffer
zone.

7.2

RECOMMENDATIONS

Based on the assessment that sites 41ML324, 41LT481, 41LT482, 41LT483, 41LT484,
and 41ML325 are not eligible for inclusion in the NRHP and do not warrant formal designation
as SALs, it is Horizon’s opinion that the development of the proposed Site 50 Landfill Project will
pose no adverse effects to significant cultural resources that are eligible for formal designation
as SALs or that are listed on or considered eligible for listing on the NRHP. It is also Horizon’s
opinion that a 25.0-foot (7.6 m-) construction buffer around the TK Cemetery is adequate to
ensure the protection of any potential unmarked graves that could be present adjacent to the
modern cemetery fencing. Horizon therefore recommends that the undertaking be allowed to
proceed relative to the jurisdiction of the ACT, the USACE, and Section 106 of the NHPA.
However, in the unlikely event that any cultural materials (including human remains or burial
features) are inadvertently discovered at any point during construction, use, or ongoing
maintenance within the Project Area, even in previously surveyed areas, all work at the location
of the discovery should cease immediately, and the THC should be notified of the discovery.
