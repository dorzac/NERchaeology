ABSTRACT
On behalf of the City of Georgetown, SWCA Environmental Consultants (SWCA) conducted intensive
cultural resources investigations of the Garey Park Project in western Williamson County, Texas. The
City of Georgetown proposes to construct a 545-acre mixed-use public park with associated
improvements on the north and south banks of the South Fork San Gabriel River between the
communities of Leander and Georgetown, Texas, which is quickly filling with residential and commercial
development. The proposed project includes the construction of cabins, roadways, camping and
equestrian facilities, an amphitheater, playscape and splash pad, a system of trails, and associated
enhancements (e.g., buried and overhead utilities) across the property. Subsurface impacts are anticipated
to extend to a maximum of 3 to 4 feet for most construction, while utility (e.g., sewer, water, electric, etc.)
construction will extend a maximum depth of approximately 5 to 6 feet.
SWCA performed a background review of the project area and surrounding 1-mile radius and an intensive
pedestrian inventory with shovel testing of the entire project area with supplemental backhoe trenching
along the South San Gabriel River. The goal of the work was to locate cultural resources within the
project area, establish vertical and horizontal site boundaries as appropriate with regard to the project
area, and evaluate any site recorded for eligibility as a State Antiquities Landmark (SAL) as defined by
the Texas Administrative Code (TAC) 13, Chapter 26, Subchapters C and D (amended May 20, 2013).
All work was conducted in accordance with the standards and guidelines of the Council of Texas
Archeologists (CTA) and Texas Historical Commission’s (THC’s) minimum survey standards under
Texas Antiquities Permit No. 7028. No federal funding is involved with this project.
The background review determined that four cultural resources surveys have been conducted within or
adjacent to the project area boundaries and three archaeological sites (41WM110, 41WM1100, and
41WM1198) have been recorded within the boundaries of the project area. Of these sites, only site
41WM110 is recommended as potentially eligible for listing as an SAL. This site is a prehistoric campsite
with a burned rock midden and Late Archaic dart points, located in the northern portion of the project
area just south of the South San Gabriel River. Sites 41WM1100 and 41WM1198 are upland prehistoric
lithic procurement areas that were found to extend into the project area from their previous boundaries
just off Farm-to-Market 2243. In addition to the three sites within or immediately adjacent to the project
area, there are an additional 17 sites within a 1-mile radius of the project area. There are no cemeteries,
National Register of Historic Places (NRHP) properties/districts, or historical markers within the project
area.
Typically, investigators encountered shallow rocky soil across the southern majority of the project area,
steep, rocky slopes through the middle, and clay loam alluvium in the north-central portion of the project
area. A total of 201 shovel tests were excavated, exceeding CTA/THC minimum survey standards, which
require 182 shovel tests for the 545-acre project area, or one shovel test per 3 acres for project areas
greater than 100 acres in size. In addition, a total of 10 backhoe trenches were excavated in an area
identified as having the potential for deeply buried archaeological sites along the South San Gabriel
River. As a result of these investigations, a total of 10 archaeological sites were documented: the three
aforementioned previously recorded sites (41WM110, 41WM1100, and 41WM1198), six newly
documented prehistoric sites (41WM1279–1283 and 41WM1285), and one newly documented historic
site (41WM1284). The newly documented prehistoric sites include two campsites (41WM1282–1283),
one lithic scatter (41WM1285), and three prehistoric lithic procurement sites (41WM1279–1281).
Sites 41WM110 and 41WM1282 are recommended as eligible for listing as SALs based on the integrity
of observed deposits. Shovel testing and backhoe trenching was conducted on both sites and, although
cultural deposition was found to be relatively shallow, the sites exhibit the potential for intact, buried
features. Additionally, both sites also contain highly visible burned rock middens and diagnostic artifacts.

i

As such, site 41WM110 and 41WM1282 have the potential to contribute to a better understanding of the
prehistory of Texas. Both sites have been subject to a moderate level of relic collecting and the likelihood
of further vandalism at both locations is very high. SWCA recommends protection of the sites or further
investigation if adequate protective measures cannot be implemented.
The remaining eight sites are not recommended as eligible for SAL listing based on several factors
including an overall diffuse scatter of temporally non-diagnostic artifacts, the absence of cultural features,
the lack of subsurface integrity, and in the case of 41WM1284, failure to meet NRHP Criteria A through
D (TAC 13.26, Subchapter D). A total of three isolated finds (two prehistoric artifacts and one historic
feature), which are not directly associated with archaeological sites, were also recorded.
SWCA has made a good faith effort to thoroughly document cultural resources within the proposed City
of Georgetown Garey Park. Management recommendations regarding the cultural resources identified
within the project area, particularly sites 41WM110 and 41WM1282, are provided as an appendix to this
report.

INTRODUCTION

PROJECT AREA DESCRIPTION

At the request of Cambrian Environmental, and on
behalf of the City of Georgetown, SWCA
Environmental Consultants (SWCA) conducted an
intensive cultural resources survey of the proposed
Garey Park Project in western Williamson County,
Texas (Figure 1). The project involves a 545-acre
tract on the north and south banks of the South
Fork San Gabriel River, upon which the City of
Georgetown proposes to construct a mixed-use
public park with associated improvements; the
majority of the planned park would be on the
south bank of the river. Because the project will
occur on property owned by the City of
Georgetown, a political subdivision of the state,
archaeological investigations were performed to
comply with the Antiquities Code of Texas under
Texas Antiquities Permit No. 7028.

The roughly 545-acre project area appears on a
portion of the Leander, TX (3097-321) U.S.
Geological
Survey
(USGS)
7.5-minute
topographic quadrangle map, and is primarily
along the south bank of South Fork San Gabriel
River. The project area is located between the
communities of Leander and Georgetown, Texas,
which is quickly filling with residential and
commercial development. Based on current aerial
photography, the project area is in a semi-rural
setting and surrounded by pasture and
undeveloped land as well as some residential
subdivisions (see Figure 2). The project area is
oriented generally north to south and extends
across rocky uplands on the southern end and
drops about 250 feet in elevation (800–1,035 feet
above mean sea level [amsl]) to alluvial lowlands
on the northern end. Accordingly, the project area
contains a diverse setting with shallow bedrock
and dense hardwoods to open pastures on deep
floodplain deposits.

The proposed project includes the construction of
cabins, roadways, camping and equestrian
facilities, an amphitheater, playscape and splash
pad, a system of trails, and associated
enhancements (e.g., buried and overhead utilities)
across the property (Figure 2). Subsurface impacts
are anticipated to extend to a maximum of 3 to 4
feet for trail grading and roadway construction,
while utility (e.g., sewer, water, electric, etc.)
construction will extend a maximum depth of
approximately 5 to 6 feet.

ENVIRONMENTAL DESCRIPTION
The 545-acre Garey Park property is situated at the
margins of several macro-regions, including the
Edwards Plateau to the west, the Blackland Prairie
to the east, the Gulf Coastal Plain to the south, and
Grand Prairie to the north. Each of these are
subdivisions of much larger physiographic regions
supporting different biotic communities.

SWCA archaeologists Matthew Stotts, Alamea
Young, Matt Carter, Melissa Garcia, and
Mercedes Cody conducted the initial field work on
September 23–29, 2014. Matthew Stotts and
Alamea Young conducted the subsequent backhoe
trenching on December 31, 2014. The purpose of
the work was to locate and identify all prehistoric
and historic archaeological sites within the project
area, establish vertical and horizontal site
boundaries as appropriate with regard to the
project area, and evaluate the significance and
eligibility of any site recorded for listing as a State
Antiquities Landmark (SAL). All investigations
were conducted in accordance with the Council of
Texas Archeologists (CTA) and Texas Historical
Commission’s
(THC’s)
minimum
survey
standards, with any exceptions thoroughly
documented.

The area is on the eastern edge of the Edwards
Plateau along the South Fork San Gabriel River, a
tributary of the Brazos River (Figures 3 and 4).
The plateau’s southern and eastern margins are
well defined by the Balcones Escarpment, a steep
scarp formed by the Balcones fault zone.
Subsequent to the uplift along the fault, the edges
of the plateau have slowly eroded away, creating
much more of a textured, osmotic boundary
between the plateau and prairies. Waterways,
which drain the plateau into the adjacent prairies
to the east and coastal plain to the south, become
more deeply incised heading westward. In the
vicinity of the project area, the river has cut deeply
into the limestone bedrock, creating prominent
bluffs.

from which the feature gets the name Balcones
Escarpment (Swanson 1995:28). For roughly 300
miles, the uplifted and elevated Balcones
Escarpment divides the Edwards Plateau from the
physiographic regions of the Blackland Prairie to
the east and South Texas Plain to the south
(Spearing 1991; Swanson 1995). Thus, the liminal
zone of the eastern Edwards Plateau and adjacent
prairies, periodically intersected by waterways
draining the plateau, offered a broad spectrum of
resources for prehistoric and historic inhabitants.

The plateau is distinguishable from surrounding
physiographic regions by its prominent
Cretaceous-age limestone, dolomite, sandstone,
and shale deposits. The Edwards Plateau
physiographic region is broad and diverse with the
western plateau margins blending slowly into the
mountain and basin physiographic regions
westward and abruptly transitioning into the plains
regions to the east. The elevation of the western
Edwards Plateau is approximately 2,000 feet amsl
and gradually decreases eastward to about 600 feet
amsl along its eastern margins. Despite the higher
elevation, the western and northern margins of the
plateau are relatively flat in comparison to the
diverse topographic relief of its eastern and
southern margins. This abrupt separation of the
eastern and southern extent of the Edwards Plateau
from the plains to the east is clearly demarcated by
flat-topped hills with eroded tiers that early
Spanish explorers likened to balconies (balcones)

SOILS AND GEOLOGY
The surface geology for the project area, in order
of predominance, includes Lower Cretaceous
Edwards Limestone and Key Valley Marl of the
Fredericksburg Group and recent (Holocene)
Quaternary alluvium (Barnes 1974). The Edwards
Limestone that composes the uplands of the

5

the state into seven biotic provinces that
corresponded to animal habitat and vegetation
regions, and generalized physiography. These
provinces, from west to east are Chihuahuan,
Navahonian, Kansan, Balconian, Tamaulipan,
Texan, and Austropirian. The project area is at the
intersection of the Balconian and Texan biotic
provinces. Blair’s division of seven provinces was
later refined into the present system of 10 or 11
“ecoregions,” or natural vegetation regions. The
two principle physiographic regions within the
project area, the Edwards Plateau and the
Blackland Prairie, are also separate ecoregions as
defined by Omernik (1987). Ecoregions are
defined by water availability, soil types,
topography, potential natural vegetation and
current land use. Omernik’s boundaries were
subsequently further refined (Griffith et al. 2004).
Within the ecoregions, additional, specific
divisions can be made by dominant vegetation
communities into physiognomic regions (Frye et
al. 1984).

project area consists of fine-grained grayish to
brown limestone, dolomite, and chert that forms in
flat areas and plateaus bordered by scarps. The
Keys Valley Marl that composes the upland
slopes, particularly at the western end of the
project area, consists of soft, white marl (e.g., a
lime-rich mud or mudstone) with various marine
fossils (e.g., Exogyra texana and pelecypods). The
recent (Holocene) Quaternary alluvium is situated
along the river bottomlands and consists of clay,
silt sand, and gravel floodplain and low terrace
deposits
with
well-preserved
fluviatile
morphology in point bars, oxbows, and abandoned
channels. Due to the alluvial origin and Holocene
age of the deposit, it has a good potential for
containing buried cultural resources.
In order of prevalence, the soils within the project
area include Eckrant-Rock Outcrop complex (hilly
and rolling), Eckrant stony clay (0–3 percent
slopes), Sunev silty clay loam (0–3 percent
slopes), and Doss silty clay (1–5 percent slopes).
The Eckrant series soils cover the uplands and
slopes in the southern two-thirds of the project
area and are characterized as residuum derived
from limestone overlying very shallow to shallow
bedrock occupying summits and shoulders on
dissected plateaus (NRCS 2014).

The natural regions are further divided into
subregions (Diamond et al. 1987; Diggs et al.
1999; Lyndon B. Johnson School of Public Affairs
1978). The Balcones Canyonlands is one such
subdivision within the Edwards Plateau, and the
prairies to the east comprise a series of other
subdivisions. Of significance, the project area is at
the ecotonal boundary of distinctive vegetation
regimes along the eastern edge of the Edwards
Plateau and eastward to the Blackland Prairies.
Although modern and historic impacts to the
Edwards Plateau and to the Blackland Prairies
have substantially altered the vegetation
composition of both regions, remnant populations
of these regions still exist, providing an insight
into the prehistoric plant communities (Diamond
and Smeins 1985; Fowler and Dunlap 1986;
Riskind and Diamond 1986; Smeins and Diamond
1983).

The Sunev series soils are located at the northern
end of the project area in the lowlands along the
South San Gabriel River and consist of very deep,
well-drained soils that formed in loamy alluvium.
These soils are on nearly level to moderately steep
stream terraces or footslopes of valleys and ridges
(NRCS 2014). Given the alluvial origin of this soil
series, it has a potential to contain deeply buried
cultural materials.
Finally, the Doss series soils are located on the
slopes between the upland ridges and the lowland
terraces. The Doss series is described as
calcareous loamy and clayey residuum derived
from marls and limestone situated on hill slopes of
dissected plateaus (NRCS 2014).

FAUNA
The use of natural or ecoregions is also applied to
the distribution of fauna, although reference is also
made to the biotic provinces. The use of biotic
provinces as proposed by Blair (1950) has been
updated and further refined, but for studying

Prairie, has resulted in several examples of species
parapatry (adjacent or bordering ranges), sympatry
(same geographic range) and allopatry (distinct
separate ranges) (Neck 1986). Although Neck lists
128 as the total terrestrial species for Texas, as
based upon The Mammals of Texas (Davis 1974),
the most recent publication of the Mammals of
Texas (Davis and Schmidly 1997), lists 141 native
species of mammals. Neck’s (1986) analysis
shows that approximately half of the mammal
species occur along the Balcones Escarpment, and
approximately half of these species (34) are
bounded within the escarpment. Of these species,
53 percent occur only west of the escarpment, 35
percent are east of the escarpment, while 12
percent are found only along the line. Endemic
species include a number of aquatic species that
are found only within the spring-fed streams along
the escarpment including freshwaters mussels such
as False spike (Quincuncina mitchelli), Texas
fatmucket
(Lampsilis
bracteata),
Texas
pimpleback (Quadrula petrina), and Golden orb
(Quadrula aurea). These species are dependent
upon flowing water and are not found in ponding
areas or in temporary drainages.

mammals, Davis and Schmidly (1997) reduced the
number of regions in Texas to four: the TransPecos, Plains Country, East Texas, and the Rio
Grande Plains. The Blackland Prairie is included
in the East Texas region, and the Edwards Plateau
is within the Plains Country. The Balcones
Escarpment separates the Plains from the Rio
Grande Plains and East Texas. Between the San
Antonio and Guadalupe Rivers, the boundary
between East Texas and Rio Grande Plains is
where pedocal and pedalfer soils intersect (Davis
and Schmidly 1997). There are 141 species of
native terrestrial mammals, the largest of species
by order are Rodentia (68 species), followed by
Chiroptera (bats, 32 species), Carnivora (28
species), and Artiodactyla (14 species).
There are five distinct patterns to the distribution
of mammals in Texas: 1) species that are or were
endemic to the whole state; 2) species found
within a particular region; 3) western species in
the Trans-Pecos and Plains Country; 4) western
species in the Trans-Pecos, Plains, and South
Plains; and 5) eastern species east of the 100th
meridian. Species do occur outside of their
designated boundaries, which makes the Balcones
Escarpment region potentially rich and diverse in
mammal species.

An example of the biotic richness at the
intersection of the Blackland Prairie and the
Edwards Plateau is depicted by Kutac and Caran
(1994). Although slightly south of the project area,
their south Central Texas region reflects the
diversity expected within the project area. Kutac
(1994) lists 349 species of bird regularly
associated with the region; Toomey and Caran
(1994) list 82 species of mammals; and Hampton
(1994) lists 41 amphibians and 94 reptiles. Caran
and Hubbs (1994) note 130 species of fishes,
including both historic and extinct taxa. Overall,
the majority of mammals are small, from the
orders of Rodentia and Chiroptera (bats). The
overwhelming majority of the fish species are
small as well with Cypriniformes (minnows and
carps) as the most numerous family.

Davis and Schmidly (1994) list 25 species that are
or were found in most of the regions. Larger
species include bison (Bos bison), black bear
(Ursus americanus), white-tailed deer (Odocoileus
virginianus), mountain lion (Felis concolor),
bobcat (Lynx rufus), coyote (Canis latrans),
common gray fox (Urocyon cinereoargenteus),
American beaver (Castor canadensis), common
raccoon (Procyon lotor), and Virginia opossum
(Didelphis virginiana). Smaller mammals include
ringtail (Bassariscus astutus), long-tailed weasel
(Mustela frenata), striped skunk (Mephitis
mephitis),
eastern
cottontail
(Sylvilagus
floridanus), black-tailed jackrabbit (Lepus
californicus), hispid cotton rat (Sigmodon
hispidus), five species of bats, and four species of
mice. Rodents are the most numerous and account
for the majority of regionally specific species.

More specific to the project area, common
mammals include the opossum (Didelphis
virginiana), eastern fox squirrel (Sciurus niger),
eastern cottontail rabbit (Sylvilagus floridanus),
pocket gopher (Geomys breviceps), fulvous
harvest mouse (Reithrodontomys fulvescens),
white-footed mouse (Peromyscus leucopus),

Following standard chronological divisions, we
divide the prehistoric cultural sequence into three
periods: Paleoindian, Archaic, and Late
Prehistoric. The Archaic period is commonly
subdivided into three subperiods (Early, Middle,
and Late), although, as this report addresses,
various labels have been applied to the last few
centuries of the Archaic. To avoid straying too far
down a tautological maze, we generically call the
period from approximately 600 B.C. to A.D. 700
“the end of the Archaic.”

black bear ranged into or near this area (Schmidly
2004).
Similarly, the general reptilian assemblage for the
project area includes the Great Plains rat snake
(Elaphe guttata emoryi), Eastern yellowbelly racer
(Coluber constrictor flaviventris), Yellow mud
turtle (Kinosternon flavescens flavescens), bullfrog
(Rana catesbiana), and the southern leopard frog
(Rana utricularia) (Blair 1950; Kutac and Caran
1994).

PALEOINDIAN PERIOD
The Paleoindian period, which includes the
earliest known peoples in the area, began during
the close of the Pleistocene. Paleoindian artifacts
and sites date from about 11,500–8800 B.P. and
are not uncommon in Central Texas (Collins
2004). Two of the more important Paleoindian
sites in Texas are near the project area: the
Wilson-Leonard site (41WM235) on Brushy
Creek in southern Williamson County, and the
Gault site (41BL323) in adjacent Bell County.

CULTURAL BACKGROUND AND
SETTING
Williamson County is on the eastern edge of the
Edwards Plateau and near the eastern margins of
the Central Texas archaeological region, as
defined by Collins (2004), Prewitt (1981, 1985),
Suhm (1960), and other researchers. Of course, the
Central Texas archaeological region is an artificial
construct, and its boundaries are somewhat
arbitrary (Collins 2004:102). As Collins
(2004:103) points out, it is unlikely that any group
in the past 11,000 years had their key resources,
geographic range, or political sphere conform to
these boundaries. It is worth noting that Perttula
(2004: Figure 1.1) extends the boundaries of
Central Texas much farther east than many
researchers. Nevertheless, situated as it is, on the
Edwards Plateau’s margins, the sites identified
within the project area share many traits in
common with “classic” Central Texas sites (i.e.,
those above the Balcones Escarpment).

Diagnostic artifacts of the period include
lanceolate-shaped and fluted projectile points such
as Clovis, Folsom, and Plainview. These projectile
points were hafted onto wooden spears and often
used to hunt big game such as mammoth,
mastodon, bison, camel, and horse (Black 1989;
Bousman et al. 2004). Recent research has
demonstrated that Paleoindian people relied on a
more diverse subsistence base than previously
thought, exploiting a variety of plants and small
fauna in addition to the larger animals (Bousman
et al. 2004). Paleoindian lifeways gradually
transitioned to a more Archaic-style adaptation
(increasing reliance on plants and smaller game,
better-defined and smaller group territories, and
regional diversification in projectile point styles)
as the big game died off and the climate warmed
following the end of the Pleistocene ice age
(Bousman et al. 2004).

As noted above, the project area is near the eastern
edge of the Central Texas archaeological region.
Its occupants likely ranged west, deeper into the
Edwards Plateau, and east, onto the rolling
Blackland Prairie. Inhabitants of the area,
therefore,
were

cultural
developments taking place in and to the east of
Central Texas. Regardless of the intensity or
nature of influences from off the plateau, we rely
on more developed chronologies from Central

1985). Early Archaic populations supplemented
their hunting diet with a diverse assemblage of
processed plant foods. This is most evident
through the use of hot rock cooking technologies,
which become commonplace at Early Archaic
sites. Early Archaic burned rock features are most
often small- to medium-sized hearths, with
minimal evidence of reuse. However, at a few
Early Archaic sites (e.g., Wilson-Leonard and
Loeve), larger earth ovens have been documented
(Collins et al. 1998; Prewitt 1982); these are
believed to be the precursors to burned rock
middens.

faunal resources. Material culture became more
regionally diversified, and the use of burned rock
middens and ovens became widespread. This
period is known as the Archaic period and dates
from approximately 8800–1200 B.P. in Central
Texas (Collins 2004; Johnson and Goode 1994).
EARLY ARCHAIC
The Early Archaic is commonly dated to ca. 8800
to 6000 B.P. (Collins 2004:119). Research suggests
that Early Archaic people became increasingly
reliant on local resources and residential mobility
decreased (Prewitt 1981:73; Suhm et al. 1954:18).
Early Archaic populations utilized base camps for
longer periods, perhaps seasonally, and hunted a
diverse array of small (e.g., snakes, turtles,
rodents, rabbits), medium (e.g., opossums and
raccoons), and large (e.g., deer and antelope)
game; fished local rivers; and cooked wild plant
bulbs in earth ovens. It is likely that the reduction
in residential mobility was related to a variety of
factors including diminished bison populations,
population increase, tribal territoriality issues, and
climatic change. By the start of the Early Archaic,
well-established resident populations lived in
every biogeographical region of Texas.

A burned rock midden is a large, dense feature of
burned rocks and ash-stained soil that accumulates
from use and reuse as a thermal cooking feature
(Black et al. 1997; Mahoney et al. 2003; Suhm
1960). The number of burned rock middens
increased throughout the Archaic period and it
seems clear that their technological roots lie in the
first earth ovens of the Early Archaic (Black et al.
1997; Collins et al. 1998; Decker et al. 2000).
Burned rock midden technology appears to have
first developed in the eastern plateau around
8,500–8,000 years ago and gradually spread into
the western plateau ca. 6,500–5,000 years ago
(Decker et al. 2000:301). These large features vary
greatly in size and form, but share the common
functional purpose of serving as an earth oven or
similar cooking device (Black et al. 1997; Weir
1976).

Collins (2004:120) and McKinney (1981) observe
that a large number of Early Archaic sites are
documented along the eastern and southern
margins of the Edwards Plateau. They argue that if
our current understanding of Early Archaic site
distribution reflects prehistoric land use, then the
Early Archaic was a time period when people were
living in the better-watered parts of the Edwards
Plateau. With very low population densities across
the state at the beginning of the Archaic, it makes
sense that the environmentally desirable zones,
such as the well-watered ecotone along the
margins of the Edwards Plateau, would be the first
areas to be more heavily settled.

Work completed on the Gatlin site, 41KR621, in
southern Central Texas highlighted the complexity
and diversity in the Early Archaic settlement
system noted by previous researchers (Houk et al.
2008). As Johnson (1991:159) states, “people
acquired different foods at different suitable
places,” meaning that certain sites were visited
repeatedly on a seasonal basis. Johnson
(1991:160) speculated that people in the eastern
part of Central Texas may not have had large base
camps, instead they traveled from site to site in
small groups; the Gatlin site data for the Early
Archaic period supports this hypothesis. In fact,
based on a study conducted as part of the Gatlin
site analysis, only the Wilson-Leonard site was
classified as an Early Archaic base camp out of 16
well-documented Early Archaic components in

During the Early Archaic, projectile points became
more regionally diversified, and stemmed forms
replaced the lanceolate points of the Paleoindian
period. This technological shift may have been
due, in part, to the development of a more
localized, broad-based hunting and gathering
economy that necessitated differing point types for
different game (Johnson and Goode 1994; Story

dome middens, they may be several feet thick.

Central Texas. The other sites all represent shortterm, specialized activity sites (Houk et al. 2008).
MIDDLE ARCHAIC

Early Triangular dart points appear in the
beginning of the Middle Archaic subperiod,
around 5300 B.P. at the Gatlin site (Houk et al.
2008:Figure 13.2). This unstemmed type cooccurs with Bell and Andice points, which are
basally notched, stemmed point forms (Mahoney
et al. 2003; Sorrow et al. 1967). Wyckoff’s (1995)
research suggests that Bell and Andice points (also
known as Calf Creek points) are intrinsically
linked to bison hunting. Their appearance at the
beginning of the Middle Archaic is presumably
related to the return of bison to the area ca. 5000
B.P. Nolan and La Jita points, which have square
to rectangular stems with weak, rounded, or abrupt
shoulders, appear in the Central Texas
archaeological record ca. 4800 B.P. and persist into
the beginning of the Late Archaic (Houk et al.
2008:Figure 13.2).

The Middle Archaic is commonly dated to ca.
6000 to 4000 B.P. (Collins 2004:120) During the
beginning of the Middle Archaic, from
approximately 5750–5250 B.P., Johnson and
Goode (1994:73) contend that a brief warm and
dry period arose. Hudler (2000) also documents a
major climatic shift towards warmer and drier
conditions ca. 5300 B.P., followed by a very brief
wet interval. Johnson and Goode (1994:73) also
believe this dry period was followed by a short
period of climatic amelioration between 5250–
4600 B.P. with moderately wet and cool
conditions.
The Middle Archaic is marked by a significant
increase in archaeological sites on the Edwards
Plateau. It is difficult to determine if this increase
is due to a larger, denser population or an increase
in residential mobility (Turpin 2004). In either
case, there is abundant evidence that settlement
and subsistence became more regionally
specialized during this time. Burned rock hearths,
scatters, and concentrations are common at Middle
Archaic sites; however, none of these features is
more pronounced than the burned rock midden,
the use of which proliferated during the Middle
Archaic (Black et al. 1997; Prewitt 1981, Shafer
1988). There is widespread evidence supporting an
increased reliance on the processing of geophytes
and succulent plant bulbs such as sotol, yucca, and
lechuguilla in burned rock middens (Dering 1999).
Three distinct types of burned rock middens
documented during the Middle Archaic are sheet
middens, dome middens, and annular middens
(Mahoney et al. 2003). Sheet middens are loose
accumulations of displaced and mixed burned
rocks, usually derived from several burned rock
features. The rock displacement may be caused by
natural or cultural processes, including erosion,
flooding, feature maintenance, and/or reuse. Dome
middens are round, dome-shaped accumulations of
burned rock that can be several feet thick. Dome
middens form through repeated feature use and
maintenance, thus resulting in a massive, dense
accumulation of burned rock. Annular middens
(also called crescent, ring, or donut middens) are

LATE ARCHAIC
The Late Archaic began around ca. 4000 B.P. and
lasted until ca. 1200 B.P., ending when the bow
and arrow was introduced into Central Texas
(Collins 2004:121). Late Archaic sites are more
numerous than earlier Archaic period sites (Black
1989; Collins 2004), and some researchers argue
that population increased during the Late Archaic
(Johnson and Goode 1994; Prewitt 1981; Weir
1976).
Increasingly
complex
cultural
manifestations are characterized in the Late
Archaic archaeological record, and increased
population size may have contributed to this
complexity (Johnson and Goode 1994).
Territoriality issues may have also been more
commonplace in the Late Archaic. This argument
is somewhat supported by the development of
more formal cemeteries in many areas of Texas
(Hall 1981; Lukowski 1987; Taylor and Highley
1995). Burials from these cemeteries often contain
grave goods such as marine shell ornaments (from
the Texas coast), boatstones (from Arkansas), and
corner tang knives (from the Edwards Plateau).
The presence of these items ultimately suggests
that plateau populations participated in some form

10

of a trade system during the Late Archaic (Hall
1981).

period, specifically the Toyah phase/interval, as
will subsequently be discussed.

Compared to previous subperiods, an extremely
diverse assemblage of projectile point forms was
utilized during the Late Archaic. Pedernales,
Kinney, and Tortugas points appeared at the
beginning of the period. Pedernales points have
bifurcated stems and a narrow to broad, often leafshaped blade (Turner and Hester 1999). Montell,
Lange, Marshall, Williams, Marcos, Castroville,
and Shumla points appear slightly later and for the
most part are all broad-bladed points that generally
have expanding stems and prominent, barbed
shoulders. Many of these early Late Archaic points
were apparently used for bison hunting (Dibble
and Lorrain 1968).

By the early part of the Late Archaic period,
Central Texas was occupied by broad-spectrum
foragers specializing in the resources available
within specific ranges or territories. Arnn
(2007:274–275) argues that the stabilization of
climatic patterns during the Late Archaic allowed
area-specific cultural material to emerge
throughout the region. For example, the
intensification in plant processing, evidenced by
increased accumulation of rock oven features and
burned rock middens, suggests an increasing
reliance on a resource that is essentially fixed on
the landscape (Arnn 2007:277).
Late Archaic groups did not exist in isolation, and
the eventual spread of most Late Archaic point
styles, particularly the later style types, as well as
exotic materials such as marine shell and perhaps
religious ideas, throughout the state suggests their
participating in a “vast web of social relations”
(Arnn 2007:277). Decorated bone ornaments, Gulf
whelk shells, and atlatl weights of exotic stone are
among the new types of materials to appear during
the Late Archaic (Johnson and Goode 1994).
Exotic materials are recovered from domestic
contexts as well as burials suggesting they were a
pervasive component in the life of Late Archaic
peoples (Arnn 2007:277).

Hot rock cooking technologies developed in
previous periods continued to be employed during
the Late Archaic, and burned rock middens are a
very common Late Archaic site feature. Many of
the burned rock middens that formed during the
Middle Archaic continued to be used by Late
Archaic peoples (Black et al. 1997).
THE END OF THE ARCHAIC AND THE BEGINNING
OF THE LATE PREHISTORIC
As Collins (2004:122) notes, “diverse and
comparatively
complex
archaeological
manifestations toward the end of the Late Archaic
attest to the emergence of types of human conduct
without precedent in Texas.” As is discussed in
detail elsewhere in this report, various labels—
Transitional Archaic (Johnson et al. 1962; Turner
and Hester 1999), Terminal Archaic (Black 1989),
and Late Archaic II (Johnson and Goode 1994)—
have been applied to the end of the Archaic period.
While the names differ, these competing schemes
generally begin after Marcos points appear in
Central Texas, encompass the Fairland-Ensor-Frio
point style intervals, and end with the Darl point
type. The succeeding Late Prehistoric period
began ca. 1200 B.P. with the introduction of the
bow and arrow into Central Texas. The first
widespread arrow point type was Scallorn, and it
is commonly associated with the Austin
phase/interval, or Late Prehistoric I (Collins 2004;
Johnson and Goode 1994). Bone-tempered
ceramics are also indicative of the Late Prehistoric

The end of the Archaic, then, was an interesting
time in Central Texas; one that we are still
struggling to understand. Arnn (2007:278–279)
argues “that the Late Archaic Period may be
viewed as a precursor (in terms of technology,
subsistence, and settlement practices) to similar
technologies and practices observed during the
Late Prehistoric.” Framing the research within that
context, one of continuity rather than change, may
be a useful approach for investigating the
transition from the Archaic to the Late Prehistoric.
As is discussed elsewhere, Johnson and Goode
(1994:40) characterize the termination of the Late
Archaic as the most difficult and complex of all
the period boundaries, noting that it may have
ended either 400 years later with the Toyah phase
or even 400 years earlier, when small dart point
types like Darl appeared.

After Mexico gained independence from Spain,
the newly formed country used a policy of land
grants to attract Anglos from the United States to
help inhabit the sparsely populated northern
regions of Mexico. During the 1820s, Stephen F.
Austin obtained grants from the Mexican
government to settle hundreds of families along
the lower Brazos and Colorado Rivers (Webb
1952). This colony, known as the “Old Three
Hundred Colony”, was successful in pushing the
European settlement frontier further west into the
Central Texas region. Prior to the Texas
Revolution, most of the “Old Three Hundred
Colony” settlement was focused south of Bastrop
and the old La Bahia Road (Webb 1952).

As noted above, the end of the Archaic period
chronologically is marked by the appearance of a
variety of small, side- and corner-notched dart
point types including Fairland, Frio, Ensor, Ellis,
and Edgewood (Turner and Hester 1999). Johnson
and Goode (1994:37) point to social interaction
with the eastern United States as a possible source
for these new point types. These projectiles may
have been part of a package of new cultural items
related to the spreading of Eastern religious ideas
as far as the Edwards Plateau—these included the
exotic items noted above such as marine shells and
atlatl weights (Johnson and Goode 1994:37).
An important cultural trait of the Late Archaic is
the appearance of formal cemeteries off the
Edwards Plateau—on the plateau sinkholes
continued to be used as repositories for the dead.
Cemeteries, where many of the exotic items noted
above have been found, suggest that groups were
tied to specific territories. Cemeteries are more
common in the early Late Prehistoric, and many
individuals buried in them show clear evidence of
violent deaths (Johnson and Goode 1994:40).
Prewitt (1982:Table 4) provides an exhaustive, if
somewhat dated, list of cemeteries and burials in
eastern Central Texas, and notes many incidences
of Scallorn arrow points either with a skeleton or
clearly imbedded in the skeleton. The Loeve-Fox
site (41WM230) contained an Austin phase
cemetery where warfare was “suggested by the
direct association of Scallorn arrow points with
fatal positions in several skeletons” (Prewitt
1982:12).

During the Texas Revolution with Mexico, the
area continued to be inhabited only by aboriginal
Native Americans. After the war, a growing Texan
population led many settlers to move northwards
in search of open, profitable land to plant crops
and raise cattle. This wave of migration spurned
new conflicts with the native groups living in the
area, cumulating in the Battle of Brushy Creek,
near what is today the town of Taylor, in February
of 1839. This battle, between the Comanche and
the Texas Raiders, resulted in numerous deaths
and eventually resulted in the removal of the
Native American presence in the area.
After the battle, the nearby town of Waterloo, on
the banks of the Colorado River, was renamed
Austin and designated the seat of government for
the Republic of Texas in 1839 (Webb 1952).
Williamson County, located north of the new
capital of Austin, was organized shortly afterward
in 1848 as the population in the area grew. The
county was named in honor of Robert M.
Williamson, an area leader and a veteran of the
Battle of San Jacinto. During this battle,
Williamson lost one of his legs and thereafter,
wore a wooden leg, which earned him the
colloquial nickname Three-Legged Willie.

HISTORIC PERIOD
In the early Historic period (A.D. 1630 to present),
the period of European contact and settlement in
Texas, the general Austin area was inhabited by
several aboriginal groups including the Jumano,
Tonkawa, Lipan Apache and Comanche
(Newcomb 2002). The first Europeans into the
area were probably Spanish missionaries who
established three missions at nearby Barton
Springs in 1730 (Webb 1952). The Spanish
mission period in this area was of short duration
and failed to colonize or even tame the area south
of the Colorado River and north of Onion Creek.
An aboriginal presence thus continued in the
Austin area into the 1860s.

The county quickly grew in population and
economic prosperity as the rich soils made
agriculture one of the top industries in the area.
Accompanying the increases in population and
commerce was the rapid adoption of slave labor.
In 1850, two years after the founding of the
county, the slave population in Williamson County

totaled 127. By 1864, less than 15 years later, the
slave count had multiplied by over 10, with an
enslaved population of 1,074 (Campbell
1989:266). Following the Civil War, many of the
planters turned to cattle to regain their ante-bellum
prosperity.
Texas University, later named Southwestern
University, was founded in Georgetown in 1873.
This was the first successful Methodist College in
Texas and it brought several new facets to the
county population. The county remained dedicated
primarily to agriculture and cattle production
through the first half of the twentieth century. As
the modern era and new technology developed,
Williamson County began to see major changes in
its configuration. Due to its proximity to Austin,
the county quickly became home to numerous
large high-tech industries. This rapid influx of
people and industries to the area continues to be
the hallmark of the southern half of the county
today, as the northern half continues to rely on
agribusiness.

FIELD METHODS
HPA DELINEATION
SWCA developed a survey methodology tailored
to high and low probability areas across through
the 545-acre survey area. The cultural probability
areas are based on numerous variables, including
site distribution patterns, background information,
topography, soils, proximity to water, roads, and
disturbances. For this study, high probability areas
are defined as locales that possess or have an
elevated likelihood of containing cultural
resources. These areas are generally identified by
documentation, such as historic structures depicted
on USGS topographic maps, or by distinct
landforms and soil deposits that have been shown
in local and regional surveys to contain
archaeological sites. Conversely, low probability
areas have a negligible or minimal likelihood of
containing cultural resources based on prior
disturbances, previous surveys conducted in the
last 20 years that identified no cultural materials,
known site distribution patterns as established in
adjacent surveys, gradient of slope, depth of
bedrock, and other criteria. Accordingly, the low
probability zones within the project area are
primarily upland settings, slopes, and disturbed
areas unless within close proximity to water.

METHODS
BACKGROUND REVIEW
SWCA conducted a thorough background cultural
resources and environmental literature search of
the project area and surrounding 1-mile radius. An
SWCA archaeologist examined the Leander,
Texas USGS 7.5-minute topographic quadrangle
map on the THC Texas Archeological Sites Atlas
(Atlas). This source provided information on the
nature and location of previously conducted
archaeological surveys; and the location of
previously recorded cultural resources, including
NRHP properties, sites designated as State SALs,
Official Texas Historical Markers (OTHMs),
Recorded Texas Historic Landmarks, cemeteries,
and local neighborhood surveys. However, the
Atlas does not necessarily list all previous work
conducted within a specific area. Previous cultural
resources investigations listed on the Atlas are
limited to projects under the purview of the
Antiquities Code of Texas or the NHPA. In
addition, projects under these regulations may not
be posted on Atlas due to a delay between
completion of fieldwork and report submittal. As a

Based on preliminary analysis, approximately
73.25 percent of the survey area is characterized as
high probability (Figure 5) and 26.75 percent is
characterized as having low probability for

investigations, SWCA refined this model to adjust
to conditions in the project area. The field survey
tested the model, surveying both high and low
probability areas, but adopted a textured approach

data gathering on resources and areas of high
potential. Low probability areas were evaluated
with a pedestrian survey, but shovel test
excavations were more selectively utilized,
particularly on the steep slopes separating the
northern lowland area from the rolling uplands.
The field survey consisted of a team of four
SWCA archaeologists surveying the project area.
Subsurface investigations involved shovel tests
that were approximately 30 centimeters (cm) in
diameter and excavated in arbitrary 20-cm levels
to 100 cm below surface unless soil characteristics
or bedrock precluded reaching that depth. The
matrix from each shovel test was screened through
¼-inch mesh, and the location of each excavation
was plotted using a hand-held Global Positioning
System (GPS) receiver. Each shovel test was
recorded on a standardized form to document the
excavations.

Appropriate State of Texas Archaeological Site
Data Forms were filled out for each site
discovered during the investigations. A detailed
plan map of each site was produced and locations
were plotted on USGS 7.5-minute topographic
maps and relevant project maps. Artifacts were
tabulated, analyzed, and documented in the field,
but not collected. Temporally diagnostic artifacts
were described in detail, mapped, and
photographed in the field.

RESULTS

Portions of the project encompass settings along
the South Fork San Gabriel River that have the
potential for deeply buried archaeological sites.
The primary method for quickly and efficiently
exploring these areas is backhoe trenching. In
these settings, trenches are usually placed
approximately 100 to 300 m apart, with tighter
intervals if necessary. Trench placement was
based on the level of disturbance within the project
area, the location of archaeological sites,
encountered deposits, and the preservation
potential for archaeological sites. Backhoe
trenches were excavated to a depth sufficient to
determine the presence/absence of buried cultural
materials and allowed the complete recording of
all features and geomorphic information to depths
of project impacts. Generally, trenches were 1.5 to
2.0 m deep, 6 to 8.0 m long, and 1.5 m wide. The
trenching was monitored by a competent SWCA

BACKGROUND REVIEW
The background review determined that four
cultural resources surveys have been conducted
within or adjacent to the project area boundaries
and three archaeological sites (41WM110,
41WM1100, and 41WM1198) have been recorded
within the boundaries of the project area. Of these
sites, two (41WM110 and 41WM1100) are fully
within the project area and one (41WM1198) is
located along the project boundary that appears to
overlap into the project area. In addition to the
three sites within or immediately adjacent to the
project area, there are an additional 17 sites within
a 1-mile radius of the project area; these sites are
summarized in Table 1. The three sites that extend
into the project area are also described below.

corticated chert flakes and a single scraper were
found. It was estimated that only 35 to 45 percent
of the site was intact, and no further work was
recommended. A second survey adjacent to the
site was conducted in 2005 by HDR, PAI, and
TxDOT, but that survey was immediately south of
the project area boundaries, across FM 2243.

properties/districts within or adjacent to the project
area. An OTHM was erected in 1974 at the site of
the A.M. Brown Cabin, however, this marker does
not currently appear within the project area on the
Atlas (2014). An historic chimney and well are
still present in this location, which is to be
developed into a garden and historic interpretive
center, including the OTHM (plaque). These
features were once part of the historic A.M. Brown
Cabin, built out of native stone by an early
Williamson County settler. As a result of the
current survey, this historic home site has been
documented as site 41WM1284, and will be
discussed in the Field Survey section of this
report. Aerial photographs also show a barn
located in the lower half of the project area and a
side-gabled house located northwest of the main,
non-historic house.

Site 41WM1198 was recorded in 2008 by AAG,
LLC. It is located at the southeast corner of the
project area and extends into the project area near
the location of the proposed main entry of the park
development. The site is an eroded hilltop used as
a lithic procurement area. No cultural features
were observed. The land at the site is impacted
from erosion and land clearing. The THC
determined the site ineligible in 2011.

SITE 41WM110

HISTORIC MAP REVIEW

Site 41WM110 was recorded by Shafer and
Corbin in 1963 during a survey that covered a
large swath of the South Fork San Gabriel River.
The site is located on the south bank of the river in
the area slated for minimal development referred
to as “The Meadow” day-use area for the planned
park (see Figure 2). The site consists of 1 acre of
occupation and a large burned rock midden
situated on a knoll 50 to 75 yards south of the river
near the base of a hill. A portion of the site extends
into a cultivated field. SWCA archaeologists
found flint and burnt rock at the site, including
both Castroville and Bulverde lithics. The depth of
fill was at least 3 feet.

SWCA reviewed historic maps dating from 1893–
1962 (Foster et al. 2006) to determine if there are
any historic age resources within the project area.
In addition, a review of historic maps from
HistoricAerials.com was conducted in order to
determine if any historic-age built resources were
located within the project area, and to develop an
idea of land development over time. A review was
conducted of aerial topographic maps dated to
1893, 1905, 1916, 1927, 1949, 1966, 1978, 1979,
1986, 1987, and 1992 and historic and modern
aerial maps dated to 1962, 1966, 1985, and 2004.

SITE 41WM1198

The 1893–1949 topographic maps depict the
project area as undeveloped property. The earliest
depiction of resources within the project area is
found within the 1962 topographic map of
Leander and 1962 aerial imagery (Foster et al.
2006). Four structures are depicted within the
northern portion of the project area approximately
1,400 feet (430 meters) south of the South Fork
San Gabriel River. The structures were located at
the north end of an unnamed two-track road that
traversed the project area. This road was in a
similar location as the Garey Ranch Construction
Road that currently traverses the project area. The
1966–1978 topographic maps depict the same four
standing structures discussed above. These
structures are no longer present on the 1979

SITE 41WM1100
Site 41WM1100 was recorded in 2004 by Horizon
Environmental Services. The site is just inside the
project area’s southern boundary along Farm-toMarket Road (FM) 2243, south of an existing
pond and near the proposed location of a proposed
walking trail through “Wildflower Prairie.” (see
Figure 2) The site is a deflated prehistoric open
campsite located on a bluff near an unnamed
tributary of Brushy Creek. Cultural material
observed on the surface and through shovel testing
included burned rock fragments and lithic
debitage. Numerous secondary, tertiary, and

Within the 545-acre project area, a total of 201
shovel tests and 10 backhoe trenches were
excavated. This excavation interval exceeds
CTA/THC Minimum Survey Standards, which
recommends one shovel test per 3 acres for project
areas larger than 100 acres and one backhoe trench
per 3 acres for areas 11–100 acres in size.
Seventy-three of the 201 shovel tests excavated
were positive for cultural material, all but one of
which are associated with archaeological sites.
The other positive shovel test (AY42) is an
Isolated Find (IF). IFs are defined as discrete
locations of cultural material, typically containing
three artifacts or less, that do not warrant
designation as archaeological sites. Three of the 10
backhoe trenches (BHT 01, BHT05, and BHT06)
were positive for cultural material on sites
41WM1282 and 41WM110. Overall, seven new
archaeological sites were recorded, three
previously recorded sites were revisited, and three
IFs were documented during the course of the

subsequently modified during construction of the
Garey home and lake. Another structure is
depicted on the 1979 topographic map
approximately 415 feet (125 meters) west of the
previous structures’ location along Garey Ranch
Construction Road and in the current location of a
cattle corral.

FIELD SURVEY
On September 23–29, 2014, and December 31,
2014, SWCA archaeologists examined the entire
545-acre Garey Park project area in support of the
proposed City of Georgetown park development
(Figures 6a and 6b). Investigators covered the
project area by utilizing pedestrian inspection
along parallel transects, supplemented with shovel
testing and visual inspection of available
exposures (e.g., vertical cut banks and erosional
channels). Backhoe trenching was conducted
within roughly 30 acres along the South San
Gabriel River, previously identified as having
potential to contain deeply buried archaeological
sites.

subject to pedestrian survey with limited shovel
testing on flat benches when they were
encountered.

The general setting can be characterized as a semirural ranching environment with expanding
residential and commercial development at the
margins of Leander and Georgetown, Texas. More
specifically, the project area captures a diverse
environment with rocky uplands, dissected by
spring-fed drainages in the south, which form a
crescent-shaped valley around an alluvial lowland
plain to the north, on the south bank of the South
Fork San Gabriel River (Figure 8). The eastern
and western edges of the lowland are flanked by
high bluffs that overlook the river.

The lowland soils are characterized by clay loam
with little gravel over extremely compact and dry
clay loam with very high gravel content and
calcium carbonate nodules. Shovel tests in this
area frequently terminated around 50 cmbs due to
compact, gravelly soil that was impenetrable by
means of hand excavation (see Appendix A). The
cut banks of a meandering stream channel that
traverses the lowland on the south side of the river
were observed for the presence of cultural features
or potential buried paleosols, and in order to
determine the vertical extent of alluvial soils. The
cut bank profile ranges from 2.5 to 10 meters (m)
high, with approximately 100–200 cm of alluvial
soil over dense, high-energy gravel deposits
(Figure 14). In-filled drainage channels exhibit
alternating low and high-energy flood deposits of
fine silty clay loam and coarse gravels,
respectively. As such, mechanical trenching for
deeply buried cultural material was conducted in
the lowland portion of the floodplain on the south
side of the South Fork San Gabriel River.

Aside from the modern Garey family home and
surrounding, manicured lawn, the property is
largely unmodified (Figure 9). The most pervasive
impact observed within the project area is related
to cedar clearing. Small push piles are present
across the uplands, indicating some level of
surface disturbance. The impact of vegetation
clearing, however, is likely fairly shallow.
Additional forms of disturbance include buried
water lines noted in the southern and western
portions of the project area, paved driveways, an
equipment shed and stock pond in the southern
portion of the project area, and a modern cabin
overlooking the river (Figures 10–12). Just north
of the Garey home is a series of elevated, earthen
(golf) tee boxes that extend down the slope toward
the lowland. Based on typical historic land use, the
lowland area was likely used for agricultural
purposes.

Backhoe trenching revealed relatively shallow soil
as well. A total of 10 backhoe trenches (BHT01–
10) were excavated in support of the project, four
of which (BHT01–04) were located to the east of
the meandering stream channel and six of which
were excavated to the west (BHT05–10). All
trenches terminated at dense gravel, which was
encountered at an average depth of 144 cmbs on
the east side of the drainage and 46 cmbs to the
west (Table 3). An attempt to punch through the
gravels was made in BHT03, however, only a
relatively thin break in the gravel was noted from
156–192 cmbs, below which, the gravels again
become very dense. This supports the previous
observations made in the drainage cut bank of
shallow loamy soil atop deep gravel deposits. The
shallow nature of soils across the northern 30 acres
of the lowland precluded the need for additional
backhoe trenching within the lowland.

Soil in the southern, upland portion of the project
area consists of extremely stony clay that does not
have the potential for intact, buried cultural
material. Shovel tests in the upland areas were
commonly terminated at depths of less than 30
centimeters below the surface (cmbs) due to very
compact gravel or bedrock (Appendix A).
Between the upland and lowland areas are steep
rocky slopes with little to no soil (Figure 13).
These areas are uninhabitable and any prehistoric
or historic artifacts encountered in such locations
are typically in a secondary depositional context as
a result of colluvial wash. As such, the slopes were

maximum depth of approximately 30 cmbs, mixed
with angular limestone gravels and thermally
fractured chert. Although nearly the entire upland
area could be considered as one continuous
archaeological site, minor breaks in landform (e.g.
upland drainages) along with the property fence
lines were utilized to define site boundaries for
future management and planning purposes.
The lowland sites represent both prehistoric and
historic occupations with intact cooking and
heating features, such as burned rock middens in
the case of 41WM110 and 41WM1282, and a
standing, cut-limestone chimney on site
41WM1284. Artifacts were encountered to a
maximum depth of 80 cmbs in the lowland
environment. No burned rock was present at
41WM1285, however, based on the distribution of
artifacts; it is very likely that the site continues to
the north beyond the project area boundary.
Detailed site descriptions are presented below,
followed by a summary and recommendation for
each site, IF descriptions, and an overall project
summary and management recommendations.

traversing the lowland, facing northwest.
Soils on the north side of the South San Gabriel
River (northwest portion of the project area),
became very gravelly and impenetrable at
approximately 40 cmbs in all shovel tests.
Combined with the observation of shallow
bedrock in the scoured profile, this suggests that
the area does not present a high likelihood of
containing deeply buried cultural deposits. Based
on these observations and the results of backhoe
trenching to the south of the river, no backhoe
trenching was conducted to the north of the South
San Gabriel River.

procurement site that extends from the north edge
of an upland hilltop, across rolling open
prairieland to an incised, potentially spring-fed
drainage channel. The area has been largely
cleared of cedar and, as such, vegetation consists
of patchy grass and scattered (large) oaks and
pecans (see Figure 9). Portions of the site near the
north edge of the upland are wooded with mixed
cedar and hardwoods and the ground is covered
with thick leaf litter. Overall, roughly 50–75
percent of the surface was visible at the time of
survey.

All 10 archaeological sites identified within the
project area have cultural material in both surficial
and buried contexts. Site types include five
prehistoric lithic procurement sites (41WM1100,
41WM1198 and 41WM1279–1281), three
prehistoric open campsites (41WM110 and
41WM1282–1283), one prehistoric lithic scatter
(41WM1285), and one multicomponent site
(41WM1284): containing an historic homestead
with sparse evidence of prehistoric activity.

The site boundary measures 830 m north-south by
650 m east-west, although investigation was
limited to the project area and the site likely
extends to the east and west (Figure 15). A total of
43 shovel tests (AY01–03, AY05–07, AY15–20,
AY25, MC01–04, MC09–12, MC15, MG01–06,
MG13–16, MG20, MS01–04, MS11–14, MS16–
17) were excavated across the site, 16 of which
were positive for cultural material to a maximum
depth of 20 cmbs (Appendix A). Soils typically

As a general characterization of site expression
and integrity, the upland lithic procurement sites
cover expansive areas where abundant chert
cobbles are present on the ground surface.
Artifacts are scattered across almost the entire
upland portion of the project area, with smaller,
discrete artifact concentrations where more
intensive lithic reduction occurred. These sites
have relatively shallow cultural deposition, to a

project area.

consist of very cobbly brown to very dark brown
clay loam over thick reddish brown clay between
30–40 cmbs. Shovel tests were terminated due to
either dense limestone and chert gravel or preHolocene age clay subsoil or basal clay.

SITE 41WM1280
Site 41WM1280 is a prehistoric lithic procurement
site located in the northeast portion of the project
area (Figure 16). The site covers the relatively flat
upland, extending from the bluff edge south and
east to the edges of the property. The northern
portion of the site is wooded with mixed cedar and
hardwoods, while vegetation in the southern
portion of the site consists of patchy grass and
scattered (large) oaks and pecans. Overall, roughly
50–75 percent of the surface was visible at the
time of survey.

Artifacts noted within the site area include large
primary flakes, tested cobbles, cores, secondary
and tertiary debitage, and crude bifacial tools.
Thermally fractured limestone and chert was noted
across much of the area that is attributed to natural
burns and freezes, however, no cultural
accumulations were encountered. A roughly 100m by 50-m concentration of moderately dense
lithic debitage was identified on a flat, exposed
portion of the hilltop, within which several crude
bifacial tools were observed. This area represents a
discrete and more intensive lithic reduction event
(or series of events), which contrasts the relatively
sparse but continuous scatter noted across the
remainder of the site. All of the artifacts
encountered are made of local brown to gray, very
fine-grained chert, known as Georgetown or
Edwards chert. No cultural features or temporally
diagnostic artifacts were encountered.

The site boundary measures 650 m north-south by
380 m east-west, although investigation was
limited to the project area and the site likely
extends to the south and east beyond the project
area. A total of 18 shovel tests (AY28–33, MC18–
21, MG22–24, MS24–28) were excavated across
the site, seven of which (MC18, MC19, MC21,
MG22, MG23, MS26, and MS27) were positive
for cultural material to a maximum depth of 25
cmbs (Appendix A). As was the case on site
41WM1279, soils typically consist of very cobbly
brown to very dark brown clay loam over thick
reddish brown clay between 5–35 cmbs. Shovel
tests were terminated due to either pre-Holocene
age clay subsoil or basal clay or limestone
bedrock.

SUMMARY
Site 41WM1279 is a prehistoric lithic procurement
site of unknown temporal affiliation. One area of
increased lithic reduction activity was noted on the
hilltop, however no cultural features were
encountered and the depth of cultural material is
limited to the upper 20 cmbs, which is disturbed as
a result of cedar clearing. No temporally
diagnostic artifacts were encountered, although
based on the location and abundance of raw lithic
material, the area was likely utilized for lithic
procurement throughout prehistory. This site was
evaluated with regard to SAL criteria and based on
the relatively ubiquitous nature of the site, a lack
of subsurface integrity, and the absence of cultural
features or temporally diagnostic artifacts,
41WM1279 appears to have limited research
potential and integrity. SWCA recommends that
the site is not eligible for listing as an SAL and,
accordingly, no further archaeological work or
avoidance measures are recommended. Should
future work impact the areas to the east or west of
the current site boundary, pedestrian inspection
with shovel testing is recommended to document

Artifacts noted within the site area include large
primary flakes, tested cobbles, cores, some
secondary and tertiary debitage, and crude bifacial
tools. In general, artifact distribution is sparse
across the site. Two small areas were noted (near
shovel tests MC18 and MG23) where lithic
debitage was moderately dense, including
secondary and tertiary flakes. These areas may
represent discrete and more intensive lithic
reduction events (or series of events) than was
noted elsewhere across the site. All of the artifacts
encountered are made of local brown to gray, very
fine-grained chert, known as Georgetown or
Edwards chert. No cultural features or temporally
diagnostic artifacts were encountered.

extends to the southwest. A total of six shovel tests
(AY40, AY41, MC28, MG29–30, and MS32)
were excavated across the site, four of which
(AY40, AY41, MG30, and MS32) were positive
for cultural material to a maximum depth of 20
cmbs (Appendix A). Soils are typical of those
found elsewhere within the upland portion of the
project area, consisting of very cobbly brown to
very dark brown clay loam over thick reddish
brown clay between 15–35 cmbs. Shovel tests
were terminated due to either pre-Holocene age
clay subsoil or basal clay or limestone bedrock.

SUMMARY
Site 41WM1280 is a prehistoric lithic procurement
site of unknown temporal affiliation. Two areas
near shovel tests MC18 and MG23 exhibiting a
higher density of artifacts than the surrounding
areas may represent locales of more intense lithic
reduction activity or are the result of sorting
through erosion. However, no cultural features or
temporally diagnostic artifacts were encountered
within these areas. This site was evaluated with
regard to SAL criteria and based on the relatively
ubiquitous nature of this site type in the region, a
lack of subsurface integrity, and the absence of
cultural features or temporally diagnostic artifacts,
41WM1280 has limited integrity and research
potential. SWCA recommends that the site is not
eligible for listing as an SAL and, accordingly, no
further archaeological work or avoidance
measures are recommended. Should future work
impact the areas to the south or east of the current
project boundary, pedestrian inspection with
shovel testing is recommended in those areas to
document the site extent beyond the limits of the
currently proposed development.

Artifacts noted within the site area include large
primary flakes, tested cobbles, cores, some
secondary and tertiary debitage, and crude bifacial
tools. In general, artifact distribution is sparse
across the site and no discrete artifact
concentrations were encountered. All of the
observed artifacts are made of local brown to gray,
very fine-grained chert, known as Georgetown or
Edwards chert. No cultural features or temporally
diagnostic artifacts were encountered.
SUMMARY
Site 41WM1281 is a prehistoric lithic procurement
site of unknown temporal affiliation. No cultural
features or temporally diagnostic artifacts were
encountered. This site was evaluated with regard
to SAL criteria and based on the relatively
ubiquitous nature of this site type in the region, a
lack of subsurface integrity, and the absence of
cultural features or temporally diagnostic artifacts,
41WM1281 has limited integrity and research
potential. SWCA recommends that the site is not
eligible for listing as an SAL and, accordingly, no
further archaeological work or avoidance
measures are recommended. Should future work
impact the areas to the south of the current site
boundary, pedestrian inspection with shovel
testing is recommended to document the site
extent beyond the limits of the current project
area.

SITE 41WM1281
Site 41WM1281 is a prehistoric lithic procurement
site located in the northwest portion of the project
area (Figure 17). Similarly to site 41WM1280 on
the eastern bluff, site 41WM1281 covers the
relatively flat upland, extending from the western
bluff edge south to roughly the center of a
prominent ridge. There is a wooded swath, which
consists of mixed juniper and hardwoods, trending
southwest to northeast, roughly through the center
of the site. The remainder of the site is sparsely
vegetated with patchy grass and scattered oaks.
Overall, roughly 75 percent of the surface was
visible at the time of survey, much of which
consists of exposed bedrock.
The site boundary measures 215 m north-south by
450 m east-west, although investigation was
limited to the project area and the site likely

cmbs in shovel test AY61, east of the mounded
portion of the midden. This shovel test was
terminated due to difficulty excavating through the
dense burned rock below 70 cmbs. Additional
artifacts noted in the assemblage include
approximately 10 bifacial tools and lithic debitage
representative of all stages of reduction.

SITE 41WM1282
Site 41WM1282 is a Late to Transitional Archaic
open campsite located within the floodplain of the
South Fork San Gabriel River on a relatively flat
terrace between the base of a steep bluff to the
southeast, an unnamed tributary drainage to the
west, and the terrace edge to the north (Figure 18).
A large burned rock midden is located at the base
of the slope, in an area wooded with mixed
juniper, hardwoods, short grass, and briar/vines.
The remainder of the site, across the flat lowland,
consists of short to mid-length grasses. Surface
visibility across the site ranges from
approximately 10–75 percent.

Backhoe trenching was also conducted within the
portion of site 41WM1282 that extends away from
the rocky slope across the flat alluvial lowland. A
total of four trenches (BHT01–04) were
excavated, one of which (BHT01) was positive for
cultural material. BHT01 was excavated on the
level terrace, approximately 50 m northwest of the
burned rock midden (see Figure 18). Lithic
debitage was observed within the upper 40 cm of
BHT01 during initial trench excavation and one
burned rock concentration was encountered at a
depth of 35–40 cmbs (Figure 20). This feature
consists of roughly 20 burned limestone cobbles
within an 80-cm-diameter area and another 10
rock fragments scattered within 2 m at the same
elevation. The feature was left in place and the
trench was shifted to the south to continue
excavation. Probing within the feature indicates
that the burned rock is limited to a single course
and no discernable patterning was evident in plan
(see Figure 19). Based on the depth at which this
feature was encountered, it is possible that
stratigraphically higher portions of the feature
were removed by historic clearing or agricultural
activity.

The site boundary measures approximately 175 m
north-south by 275 m east-west as defined by the
extent of positive shovel tests and the limits of the
landform. A total of ten shovel tests (AY57,
AY60, AY61, MC41, MC44, MG44, MG47,
MG48, MS41 and MS43) were excavated in order
to delineate the site, nine of which were positive
for cultural material to a maximum depth of 70
cmbs (Appendix A). In addition, four backhoe
trenches (BHT01–04) were excavated within the
site, of which only one (BHT01) was positive for
cultural material to a maximum depth of 80 cmbs
(see Table 3). Soils consist of very dark brown
silty clay loam that becomes extremely compact
and gravelly. All shovel tests and backhoe
trenches were terminated due to compact soil or
impassable gravel.

A 30-cm by 30-cm column sample (CS01) was
excavated in the east wall of the trench to further
investigate the subsurface cultural integrity of the
terrace deposits. Within the column sample,
observed cultural materials included primary and
secondary flakes and burned rock fragments, from
0–60 cmbs (Table 4). Following 20 cm of sterile
soil within CS01 (60–80 cmbs), one proximal
biface fragment was recovered at 80 cmbs. As
such, the column was excavated another 20 cm to
a total depth of 100 cmbs and no additional
artifacts were encountered. The remaining three
trenches (BHT02–04) were negative for cultural
material and all were terminated within dense,
angular and stream-rolled gravel (see Table 3).

An extensive (45-m north-south by 20-m east-west
by 1.5–2.0-m high) burned rock midden is situated
against the base of a steep slope in the western
portion of the site. The feature has been looted, as
evidenced by one large pit measuring roughly 2 m
wide by 1 m deep and several smaller pits around
the area (Figure 19). Castroville and Williams dart
points were found on the midden surface.
Although shovel test placement was intended to
avoid the midden, buried deposits including a
Pedernales dart point stem, over 200 pieces of
lithic debitage, one biface fragment, bone and
burned turtle carapace fragments, and abundant
burned rock fragments were found to a depth of 70

has been heavily disturbed during presumed
modifications to the drainage for flood control
measures. A total of 10 shovel tests (AY50–52
MC35–37, MG37–39, and MS38) were excavated
within the site, six of which (AY51, MC35,
MC36, MG37, MG38, and MS38) were positive
for cultural materials to a maximum depth of 50
cmbs (Appendix A). A single backhoe trench
(BHT10) was excavated within the site as well;
however, no cultural material was observed in the
trench walls or excavated soil (see Table 3). Soils
consist of very dark brown silty clay loam that
becomes extremely compact and gravelly. All
shovel tests and BHT10 were terminated due to
compact soil or impassable gravel, respectively.

SUMMARY
Site 41WM1282 is a prehistoric campsite with
temporally diagnostic artifacts, surficial and buried
cultural material, an extensive burned rock
midden, and one buried burned rock concentration.
A total of nine shovel tests and four backhoe
trenches were excavated across the site, within
which cultural material was recovered to a
maximum depth of 80 cmbs. Diagnostic artifacts
identified on site 41WM1282 include one
Pedernales dart point stem, one Williams and one
Castroville dart point, all of which date to the Late
to Transitional Archaic periods
This site was evaluated with regard to SAL criteria
and based on the potential to contribute new or
important
information
regarding
regional
prehistory and the increased likelihood of adverse
effects to the site as a result of the proposed park
project, site 41WM1282 is recommended for
listing as an SAL. As such, SWCA recommends
that impacts to the site be avoided and that the site
be protected from further destruction as a result of
looting activity. If these measures cannot be met,
further testing of the subsurface deposits via
additional mechanical and hand excavations is
recommended.

Artifacts noted within the site area include primary
secondary and tertiary debitage, crude bifacial
tools, and burned rock. Artifact distribution across
the surface varies from approximately 1–5 artifacts
per 5 square meters. Artifacts were encountered to
a maximum depth of 50 cmbs, although most of
the shovel tests terminated at shallower depths due
to dense gravel. In shovel test MS38, a relatively
high quantity of cultural material was found,
intermixed with the dense gravel. All of the
artifacts encountered are made of local parent
material: brown to gray, very fine-grained chert,
some of which is translucent. No cultural features
or
temporally diagnostic
artifacts
were
encountered.

SITE 41WM1283
Site 41WM1283 is a prehistoric open campsite
located immediately south of the South Fork San
Gabriel River and west of a deeply incised
drainage channel (Figure 21). Vegetation consists
of short to mid-length grasses across most of the
site, with large trees at the northern site boundary
and the edge of the flat floodplain terrace. Surface
visibility is approximately 50–75 percent across
the site.

SUMMARY
Site 41WM1283 is a prehistoric open campsite of
unknown temporal affiliation. No cultural features
or
temporally diagnostic
artifacts
were
encountered. This site was evaluated with regard
to SAL criteria and based on the relatively
ubiquitous nature of this site type in the region, a
lack of subsurface integrity, and the absence of
cultural features or temporally diagnostic artifacts,
41WM1283 has limited integrity and research
potential. SWCA recommends that the site is not
eligible for listing as an SAL and, accordingly, no
further archaeological work or avoidance
measures are recommended.

The site boundary measures 225 m east-west by
165 m north-south. The site is bounded on the
north by the edge of the terrace, to the east by an
unnamed drainage, and to the south and west by
the absence of cultural material as delineated
through pedestrian survey and shovel test
excavation. The southeastern portion of the site

contemporaneous with the Brown occupation,
from the mid-1800s to early 1900s. Prehistoric
artifacts are limited to two pieces of lithic debitage
recovered in shovel tests AY54 and AY63. No
burned rock or temporally diagnostic prehistoric
artifacts were encountered.

SITE 41WM1284
Site 41WM1284 is a multicomponent site
consisting of the remnants of the historic (ca.
1853) A.M. Brown homestead and a minimal
scatter of prehistoric lithic debitage (Figure 22).
Although not previously documented as an
archaeological site, a OTHM plaque was dedicated
to the “A.M. Brown Cabin” in 1974 (No. 9036;
Atlas 2014). The site is primarily situated within
the northern extent of the fenced and maintained
lawn around the modern Garey home, also
extending slightly beyond the fence line into open
pastureland to the north. Vegetation consists of a
mix of native grasses that are mowed, permitting
approximately 30 percent surface visibility across
the site at the time of survey.

Historic features on the site include a standing
chimney and well associated with the 1853 A.M.
Brown cabin. Both are constructed of hand-cut
limestone blocks and mortar. The chimney stands
roughly 10 feet tall (Figure 23). The fireplace
opening is supported by a curved wrought iron
lintel and the interior of the fireplace shows signs
of repair, as does the front of the chimney where it
appears to have been patched with concrete and
covered with wooden boards. The well is located
approximately 60 feet behind (or west of) the
chimney. It is a circular, hand-dug well that is
roughly 20 feet deep (Figure 24). The interior of
the well shaft is 1.5 feet in diameter and the
above-ground portion of the well is approximately
3 feet high and square. There is a recent grave
directly west of the chimney, where one of Mr.
Garey's dogs, “Sadie”, is buried (personal
communication 2014). No prehistoric features
were encountered.

The site boundary measures approximately 95 m
north-south by 175 m east-west, bounded by the
extent of surficial features, artifacts and buried
material within shovel tests. A total of six shovel
tests (AY54, AY62, AY63, MC38, MG49, and
MS44) were excavated within the site boundary,
five of which (AY54, AY63, MC38, MG49, and
MS44) were positive for cultural material to a
maximum depth of 20 cmbs (Appendix A). Soil
consists of brown clay loam that becomes compact
with dense gravel at a depth of 30 cmbs. All
shovel tests were terminated due to impassable
gravelly clay loam around 35 cmbs.

The OTHM text for the A.M. Brown Cabin reads:
“When Asa M. Brown cut cedar, elm, and
oak trees and built this cabin on his 317acre State of Texas claim in 1853, this
land was on the frontier. His chimney and
fireplace were of hand-hewn native stone,
the floor of dirt. William Wood, one of the
many later owners, enlarged the home. In
1909-66, L. M., T. L., Annie, and Charles
Hughes by turns owned and occupied the
property. Mr. and Mrs. Jack Garey
restored the cabin after their purchase,
1966. Recorded Texas Historic Landmark
– 1974”

A large number of artifacts noted on the site are
part of a surface collection that had been placed on
the fireplace hearth by unknown persons prior to
survey, including one button; three whiteware
sherds; two milk glass fragments; manganesebleached bottle glass (1 bottle neck, 1 bottle base,
16 body fragments); one clear glass bottle base;
five light green bottle glass fragments; one light
green bottle neck; 19 patinated, clear glass
fragments; two iron axe heads; one metal file; one
metal chain; one metal buckle; one metal fireplace
tool; three metal spoons; one metal knife; one
screw; one staple; and 55 square-cut nails. All
historic temporally diagnostic artifacts are

The cabin has since been removed from the
property, leaving the chimney and well as the only
remnants of the home (City of Georgetown 2006).

the property boundary fence line (Figure 26).
Patchy grass covers the majority of the site within
the project area, which afforded approximately
50–75 percent surface visibility at the time of
survey.

SUMMARY
Site 41WM1284 is a multicomponent site centered
on the remnants of the historic A.M. Brown cabin.
Prehistoric artifacts are minimal, consisting of two
debitage specimens recovered during shovel
testing. All artifacts are limited to the surface or
the upper 20 cmbs in an area that has been subject
to historic and modern modification. This site was
evaluated according to NRHP criteria and based
on the fact that the cabin was removed from the
property and the only features remaining are the
chimney and an associated water well, it is
SWCA’s opinion that site 41WM1284 exhibits a
lack of integrity and research potential. SWCA
recommends therefore, that the site is not eligible
for inclusion in the NRHP under Criterion A
through D. Accordingly, no further archaeological
work or avoidance measures are recommended.
However, according to the Garey Park Master
Plan, the structural features will be preserved
while incorporated into the park as part of the
A.M. Brown Pavilion (City of Georgetown 2006).

The site boundary measures 65 m north-south by
360 m east-west. The eastern and western edges of
the site are defined by the limits of the landform,
the southern edge by the absence of cultural
material, and the northern edge is currently
defined by the property boundary. As such, it is
very likely that the site extends to the north. A
total of seven shovel tests (AY55, AY56, MC39,
MC40, MG42, MG43, and MS40) were excavated
to delineate the site within the project area, four of
which were positive for cultural material to a
maximum depth of 50 cmbs (Appendix A). The
majority of artifacts, however, were limited to the
upper 30 cmbs. Soil consists of brown clay loam
that becomes extremely gravelly at a depth of 30–
60 cmbs. All shovel tests were terminated due to
dense impassable gravel.

SITE 41WM1285

Artifacts noted within the site area include
primary, secondary, and tertiary lithic debitage,
one core, and crude bifacial tools. No burned rock,
cultural features, or temporally diagnostic artifacts
were observed..

Site 41WM1285 is a prehistoric lithic scatter
located on the edge of a low terrace on the north
side of the South Fork San Gabriel River
(Figure 25). The area is cleared of vegetation aside

the base of the slope. Surface visibility averaged
approximately 30–50 percent at the time of survey.
Previous site records indicate a 1-acre site area,
situated on a knoll “50–75 yards” south of the
river, at the base of a hill and partially within a
cultivated field (Atlas 2014). The midden was
reported to have been “potted,” with a total depth
of at least 3 feet. Two Bulverde and two
Castroville dart points dating to the Late to
Transitional Archaic periods were previously
collected from the site. Comments regarding
additional artifacts are limited, stating only that
flint and burned rock were observed. Testing was
recommended for the site, however, no specific
details were given (Atlas 2014).

Figure 26. General site 41WM1285 overview
facing east. Note the high bluffs on the south side
of the South San Gabriel River.

The updated site boundary measures 80 m northsouth by 240 m east-west, covering approximately
4 acres. The previously documented knoll area
containing the midden is situated within the
eastern-central portion of the current project area
(Figure 28). The recent investigations expanded
the site eastward into the open lowland field and to
the west along the base of the slope based on
shovel testing.

SUMMARY
Site 41WM1285 is a prehistoric lithic scatter of
undetermined temporal affiliation, located on the
north side of the South Fork San Gabriel River.
This site was evaluated with regard to SAL criteria
and based on the relatively ubiquitous nature of
the site, a lack of subsurface integrity, and the
absence of cultural features or temporally
diagnostic artifacts, 41WM1285 appears to have
limited integrity and research potential within the
current project area. SWCA recommends that the
site is not eligible for listing as an SAL and,
accordingly, no further archaeological work or
avoidance measures are recommended. Should
future work impact the areas to the north of the
current site boundary, pedestrian inspection with
shovel testing is recommended to document the
site extent beyond the limits of the current project
area.

A total of 11 shovel tests (AY43, AY44, AY46,
MC29, MC31, MC32, MG32–34, MS34, and
MS35) and two backhoe trenches (BHT05 and
BHT06) were excavated across the site. Both of
the backhoe trenches and seven shovel tests
(AY43, AY46, MC31, MC32, MG34, MS34, and
MS35) were positive for cultural material to a
maximum depth of 50 cmbs (Appendix A and
Table 3).
BHT05 was excavated on the north edge of the
site and BHT06 was excavated at the northeast
edge of the site (see Figure 27). Two pieces of
lithic debitage were observed in the BHT05 profile
between 19–44 cmbs, while only a single flake
was observed in the BHT06 profile at 50 cmbs
(see Table 3). The backhoe trenches were
excavated to 140 cmbs and 85 cmbs, respectively,
and terminated at dense gravelly soil (Figure 29).
Soils consist of brown very dark grayish brown
clay loam that becomes extremely gravelly with
limestone cobbles, typically around 30 cmbs. All
shovel tests and backhoe trenches were terminated
due to dense gravel.

SITE 41WM110
Site 41WM110 is a previously recorded
prehistoric open campsite with a burned rock
midden that was initially documented by Harry
Schafer in 1963 (Figure 27). The site is located on
and around a small knoll at the base of a steep
slope and within the floodplain immediately south
of the South Fork San Gabriel River. Vegetation
consists of mid-length grasses within the open
floodplain, and mixed juniper and hardwoods at

Artifacts noted within the site area include chert
flakes, cores, bifacial tools, and dense burned rock
around the midden. Several artifacts were noted on
the surface of the knoll, which rises slightly above
the level floodplain, however, very little cultural
material was noted on the ground surface in the
surrounding area. No temporally diagnostic
artifacts were encountered during the current
investigation but, as noted, Schafer collected four
Late to Transitional Archaic dart points in 1963
(Atlas 2014). This places the period of occupation
as contemporaneous with site 41WM1282, located
in a nearly identical environmental setting on the
opposite side of the floodplain (see Figure 5).
Figure 28. Knoll within the lowland on site
41WM110, facing southwest.

The burned rock midden is on the side of the low
knoll, spilling down into the level floodplain.
Shovel test MS35, for example, was placed just
downslope from the midden in an area where little
burned rock was present at the surface. The
excavated matrix, however, was full of midden
debris, including lithic debitage and dense burned
rock. As such, the size of the midden is difficult to
determine. The visible extent is roughly 5 m
diameter and the midden exhibits evidence of
looting (i.e., hand-excavated pits) (Figure 30). The
limestone cobbles that were utilized in earth oven
preparation and concurrent midden formation are
abundantly available along the base of the slope.

dimensions, so the exact location and dimensions
previously documented are unclear (Atlas 2014).
During the 2004 project, burned rock and lithic
debitage was noted across the site and one
unifacial scraper was encountered in a shovel test.
The total depth of deposits was recorded as 10–20
cmbs and based on the shallow and deflated nature
of the cultural deposits, the site was not considered
eligible for listing on the NRHP or as an SAL.
Accordingly, no further investigation was
recommended.

SUMMARY
Site 41WM110 is a prehistoric open campsite with
a burned rock midden and multiple diagnostic dart
points (Bulverde and Castroville) dating to the
Late to Transitional Archaic periods. The site was
initially documented by Harry Schafer in 1963 and
was expanded to encompass a larger area as a
result of the current revisit. A total of 11 shovel
tests and two backhoe trenches were excavated
across the site, within which cultural material was
documented to a maximum depth of 50 cmbs.

The updated site boundary measures 250 m northsouth by 720 m east-west, covering the extent of
the rolling upland landform within the current
project area. Based on the site boundary on file at
the THC, SWCA expanded the site to the west,
north and east. A total of 14 shovel tests (AY09–
13, MC06–07, MG08–10, MS06–07, and MS09–
10) were excavated across the site, eight of which
(AY11–13, MC06–07, MG08, MG10, and MS10)
were positive for cultural material to a maximum
depth of 30 cmbs (Appendix A). Soils typically
consist of very cobbly brown to very dark brown
clay loam over bedrock between 10–30 cmbs.
Shovel tests were terminated due to either dense
limestone and chert gravel or solid limestone
bedrock.

Based on the potential to contribute valuable
information regarding prehistoric occupations in
the region, and the likelihood of adverse effects
resulting from potential impacts by future park
visitors, the site is recommended for listing as an
SAL. As such, SWCA recommends that impacts
to the site be avoided and that the site be protected
from further destruction as a result of looting
activity. If the site cannot be adequately protected,
further testing of the subsurface deposits,
particularly in and around the midden, is
recommended.
SITE 41WM1100
Site 41WM1100 is a previously recorded site
initially documented as a deflated open campsite
by Horizon Environmental Services, Inc. in 2004
(Figure 31). Based on the results of the current
investigation, the site is a prehistoric lithic
procurement locale. The site is located on a rolling
upland landform with abundant chert cobbles,
immediately north of FM 2243. The area has been
largely cleared of cedar, and as such, vegetation
consists of patchy grass and scattered oaks, elms,
and pecans. Overall, roughly 50 to 75 percent of
the surface was visible at the time of survey.

Artifacts noted within the site area include large
primary flakes, tested cobbles, cores, secondary
and tertiary debitage, and crude bifacial tools.
Burned limestone fragments were encountered
within shovel test MC07, however, thermally
fractured limestone and chert was noted across
much of the area that is attributed to natural burns
and freezes. Overall, the surficial scatter is
relatively sparse, consisting of roughly 1–5
artifacts per 25 square meters. All of the artifacts
encountered are made of local parent material:
brown to gray, very fine-grained chert. No cultural
features or temporally diagnostic artifacts were
encountered.

Previous site records indicate a site boundary
measuring 150 m northwest-southeast by 750 m
northeast-southwest, however, the boundary on
file with the THC does not match these

north-south by 575 m east-west. A total of eight
shovel tests (AY08, AY14, MC05, MC08, MG07,
MG11–12, and MS05) were excavated across the
site, six of which (AY08, AY14, MC05, MC08,
MG12, and MS05) were positive for cultural
material to a maximum depth of 25 cmbs
(Appendix A). Soils typically consist of very
cobbly brown to very dark brown clay loam over
bedrock between 10–30 cmbs. Shovel tests were
terminated due to either dense limestone and chert
gravel or solid limestone bedrock. A buried water
line extends across the site paralleling the road,
where artifacts were observed within the disturbed
soil.

SUMMARY
Site 41WM1100 is a prehistoric site, initially
documented as a deflated campsite. Current survey
results suggest the locale is an upland lithic
procurement site of unknown temporal affiliation.
No cultural features or temporally diagnostic
artifacts were encountered on site. Based on the
relatively ubiquitous nature of this site type in the
region, a low density subsurface component, and
the absence of cultural features or temporally
diagnostic artifacts, it is SWCA’s opinion that
41WM1100 has limited integrity and research
potential. As such, SWCA recommends that
41WM1100 is not eligible for listing as an SAL
and, accordingly, no further archaeological work
or avoidance measures are recommended. Should
future work impact the area across FM 2243 to the
south, pedestrian inspection with shovel testing is
recommended to determine if the site extends
beyond the limits of the current project area.

Artifacts noted within the site area include large
primary flakes, tested cobbles, cores, secondary
and tertiary debitage, and crude bifacial tools. In
general, artifact distribution is sparse across the
site. Two small areas were noted east of shovel
tests MC05 and MS05 where lithic debitage,
including secondary and tertiary specimens, is
moderately dense. These areas may represent
discrete and more intensive lithic reduction events
(or series of events) than was noted elsewhere
across the site. All of the artifacts encountered are
made of local parent material: brown to gray, very
fine-grained chert. No cultural features or
temporally diagnostic artifacts were encountered.

SITE 41WM1198
Site 41WM1198 is a previously recorded
prehistoric lithic procurement site initially
documented by American Archaeology Group,
LLC (AAG) in 2008 (Figure 32). The site is
located on a rolling upland landform with
abundant chert cobbles immediately north of FM
2243, in the southeastern portion of the project
area. The area has been largely cleared of cedar,
and as such, vegetation consists of patchy grass
and scattered oaks, elms, and pecans. Overall,
roughly 50 to 75 percent of the surface was visible
at the time of survey.

SUMMARY
Site 41WM1198 is a prehistoric lithic procurement
site, initially documented by AAG in 2008 (Atlas
2014). No cultural features or temporally
diagnostic artifacts were encountered on site. The
site was evaluated with regard to SAL criteria and
based on the relatively ubiquitous nature of this
site type in the region, a low density subsurface
component, and the absence of cultural features or
temporally diagnostic artifacts, 41WM1198 has
limited integrity and research potential. SWCA
recommends therefore that the site is not eligible
for listing as an SAL and, accordingly, no further
archaeological work or avoidance measures are
recommended. Should future work impact the area
to the east of the property boundary, pedestrian
inspection with shovel testing is recommended to
document the site extent beyond the limits of the
current project area.

Previous site records indicate a site boundary
measuring 20 m north-south by 740 m east-west,
that appears to be restricted a result of project area
limitations (Atlas 2014). Artifacts were limited to
lithic debitage scattered across the ground surface.
No buried cultural material was encountered. The
site was not considered eligible for listing on the
NRHP or as an SAL, and accordingly, no further
investigation was recommended.
The updated site boundary expands the site to
cover a rolling upland landform in the southeast
portion of the project area, measuring 250 m

ISOLATED FINDS

SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS

IFs consist of artifacts or features encountered
within in APE that did not warrant documentation
as archaeological sites due to an absence of
additional cultural material. Within the project
area, a total of three IFs were encountered, two of
which are prehistoric. and one of which is historic.

At the request of Cambrian Environmental and on
behalf of the City of Georgetown, SWCA
conducted an intensive cultural resources survey
of the proposed 545-acre Garey Park Project in
western Williamson County, Texas. The proposed
park is located primarily on the southern bank of
the South Fork San Gabriel River between the
growing
communities
of
Leander
and
Georgetown. All work was conducted in
accordance with the standards and guidelines of
CTA and THC minimum survey standards under
Texas Antiquities Permit No. 7028. No federal
funding is involved with this project. Ken
Lawrence served as Principal Investigator.

IF01 is an edge-modified chert flake that was
observed on the ground surface on the margin of
an upland drainage channel and adjacent to shovel
test MS30. As no additional surface or subsurface
cultural materials were noted and the area is
heavily eroded, the flake is likely in a secondary
context as a result of slope wash.

The proposed project includes the construction of
cabins, roadways, camping and equestrian
facilities, an amphitheater, playscape and splash
pad, a system of trails, and associated
enhancements (e.g., buried and overhead utilities)
across the property. Subsurface impacts are
anticipated to extend to a maximum of 3 to 4 feet
for most construction, while utility (e.g., sewer,
water, electric, etc.) construction will extend a
maximum depth of approximately 5 to 6 feet.
SWCA’s cultural resources investigations included
a background review and an intensive pedestrian
survey with subsurface (i.e., shovel testing and
backhoe trenching) investigations.

IF02 was encountered with shovel test AY42. One
tertiary chert flake was encountered in this shovel
test at a depth of 0–10 cmbs, which is also likely a
result of slope wash.
IF03 consists of two linear segments of rock
rubble along the east edge of a spring-fed drainage
in the northern-central portion of the project area.
The two segments are roughly 1.5 feet high, 30
feet apart and create a single, straight line
(Figure 33). The rubble represents the remains of a
rock wall possibly associated with the historic
A.M. Brown occupation. The majority of the rock
was either repurposed or destroyed by modern
construction and clearing activity. The remaining
18-foot and 25-foot segments are in very poor
condition and were not included as part of site
41WM1284 due to the substantial distance from
the cabin location.

The background review determined that four
cultural resources surveys have been conducted
within or adjacent to the project area boundaries
and three archaeological sites (41WM110,
41WM1100, and 41WM1198) were previously
recorded within the boundaries of the project area.
Of these sites, only site 41WM110 was
recommended as potentially eligible for listing as
an SAL. Sites 41WM1100 and 41WM1198 are
upland prehistoric lithic procurement areas that
were found to extend into the project area from
their previous boundaries just off FM 2243. In
addition to the three sites within or immediately
adjacent to the project area, there are an additional
17 sites within a 1-mile radius of the project area.
There
are
no
cemeteries,
NRHP
properties/districts, or historical markers within
the project area.

Sites
41WM110
and
41WM1282
are
recommended as eligible for listing as SALs based
on the integrity of observed deposits and the
potential for the site to contain new or important
data concerning regional prehistory. Shovel testing
and backhoe trenching was conducted on both
sites and, although cultural deposition was found
to be relatively shallow, the sites exhibit the
potential for intact, buried features. Additionally,
both sites also contain highly visible burned rock
middens and diagnostic artifacts. As such, site
41WM110 and 41WM1282 have the potential to
contribute to a better understanding of the
prehistory of Texas. Both sites have been subject
to a moderate level of relic collecting and the
likelihood of further vandalism at both locations is
very high. As such, SWCA recommends
protection of the sites or further investigation if
adequate protective measures cannot be
implemented. Appendix B provides a series of
suggested management recommendations for
preserving and protecting these potentially
significant cultural resources within the future
park.

A total of 201 shovel tests were excavated,
exceeding CTA/THC minimum survey standards.
Additionally, 10 backhoe trenches were excavated
in an area identified as having the potential for
deeply buried archaeological sites along the
southern bank of the South Fork San Gabriel
River. A total of 73 shovel tests and three backhoe
trenches were positive for cultural material and 10
archaeological sites were documented as a result
of the investigations: the three aforementioned
previously
recorded
sites
(41WM110,
41WM1100, and 41WM1198), six newly
documented prehistoric sites (41WM1279–1283
and 41WM1285), and one newly documented
historic site (41WM1284). The newly documented
prehistoric
sites include
two campsites
(41WM1282 and 41WM1283), one lithic scatter
(41WM1285), and three prehistoric lithic
procurement sites (41WM1279–1281). Three IFs
were also documented, including two prehistoric
artifacts and the remnants of an historic rock wall.
The project area captures a diverse environment
with rocky uplands, dissected by spring-fed
drainages in the south, which form a crescentshaped valley around the floodplain on the south
bank of the South Fork San Gabriel River. In
general, the upland lithic procurement sites cover
expansive areas where abundant chert cobbles are
present on the ground surface. These sites have
been subject to surface disturbance and exhibit
very shallow, mixed cultural deposits to a
maximum depth of 30 cmbs. The lowland sites at
the north end of the project area represent both
prehistoric and historic occupations with intact
cooking and heating features such as burned rock
middens in the case of 41WM110 and
41WM1282, and a standing, cut-limestone
chimney on site 41WM1284. Artifacts were
encountered to a maximum depth of 80 cmbs in
the lowland environment.

The remaining eight sites are not recommended as
eligible for SAL listing based on several factors
including an overall diffuse scatter of temporally
non-diagnostic artifacts, the absence of cultural
features and the lack of subsurface integrity.
SWCA made a good faith effort to thoroughly
document cultural resources within the proposed
City of Georgetown Garey Park. Provided that
adverse effects to sites 41WM110 and 41WM1282
are mitigated by means of 1) adequate protection
from further vandalism or project-related impacts,
or 2) testing and/or data recovery excavation are
conducted to fully assess the sites’ data potential,
SWCA recommends that the Garey Park project
be allowed to proceed to construction without
additional cultural resources investigations.

ARCHAEOLOGICAL SITE MANAGEMENT RECOMMENDATIONS

MANAGEMENT RECOMMENDATIONS FOR ARCHAEOLOGICAL SITES
DOCUMENTED WITHIN THE 545-ACRE GAREY PARK PROJECT

Prepared by
Matthew C. Stotts and Brandon Young

B-1

INTRODUCTION
At the request of Cambrian Environmental, and on behalf of the City of Georgetown, SWCA
Environmental Consultants (SWCA) conducted intensive cultural resources investigations of the 545-acre
Garey Park Project in western Williamson County, Texas. The proposed project includes the construction
of cabins, roadways, camping and equestrian facilities, an amphitheater, playscape and splash pad, a
system of trails, and associated enhancements (e.g., buried and overhead utilities) across the property. The
following Management Recommendations are meant to assist the City of Georgetown in protecting
identified cultural resources in a proactive manner without altering park plans or aesthetics, while
satisfying the requirements of the Antiquities Code of Texas (ACT).

LEGAL GUIDELINES
The ACT mandates that the State of Texas locate and protect all archaeological sites on land owned by
the State or any political subdivision thereof. As such, SWCA has made an effort to identify all sites
within the Garey Park property and evaluate those sites with for eligibility as State Antiquities Landmarks
(SALs) as defined by the Texas Administrative Code (TAC) 13, Chapter 26, Subchapters C and D
(amended May 20, 2013) (Stotts, et al. 2015): Following nomination, the Texas Historical Commission
(THC) and the State of Texas’ State Historic Preservation Office (SHPO) ultimately designate SALs
based on whether or not an archaeological site meets one or more of the following criteria:
1)

the site has the potential to contribute to a better understanding of the prehistory and/or history of
Texas by the addition of new and important information;

2)

the site's archeological deposits and the artifacts within the site are preserved and intact, thereby
supporting the research potential or preservation interests of the site;

3)

the site possesses unique or rare attributes concerning Texas prehistory and/or history;

4)

the study of the site offers the opportunity to test theories and methods of preservation, thereby
contributing to new scientific knowledge; and

5)

there is a high likelihood that vandalism and relic collecting has occurred or could occur, and
official landmark designation is needed to ensure maximum legal protection, or alternatively,
further investigations are needed to mitigate the effects of vandalism and relic collecting when the
site cannot be protected.

CULTURAL RESOURCES SURVEY SUMMARY
As a result of SWCA’s cultural resource investigations for the City of Georgetown’s proposed Garey
Park, 10 archaeological sites were documented. Of these, nine are prehistoric sites (41WM110,
41WM1100, 41WM1198, 41WM1279–1283 and 41WM1285), and one (41WM1284) is historic in
nature. The prehistoric sites include three campsites (41WM110, 41WM1282 and 41WM1283), one lithic
scatter (41WM1285), and five prehistoric lithic procurement sites (41WM1100, 41WM1198, and
41WM1279–1281). The historic site (41WM1284) is the former location of the A. M. Brown cabin,
located north of the existing modern Garey home.
Sites 41WM110 and 41WM1282 are recommended as eligible for listing SALs based on the integrity of
observed deposits. Shovel testing and backhoe trenching was conducted on both sites and, although
cultural deposition was found to be relatively shallow, the sites exhibit the potential for intact, buried

B-2

cultural features. Additionally, both sites contain highly visible cultural features (e.g., burned rock
middens) and temporally diagnostic artifacts. As such, sites 41WM110 and 41WM1282 have the potential
to contribute to a better understanding of the prehistory of Texas. Both sites have been subject to a
moderate level of previous relic collecting and the likelihood of further vandalism at both locations is
very high. SWCA recommends protection of the sites or further investigation if adequate protective
measures cannot be implemented.
The remaining eight sites are not recommended as eligible for SAL listing based on several factors
including an overall diffuse scatter of temporally non-diagnostic artifacts, the absence of cultural features
and the lack of subsurface integrity. However, as part of the proposed park landscape, visitors should be
discouraged from disturbing all cultural resources sites.

MANAGEMENT RECOMMENDATIONS
It is important that all future park visitors be made aware of the importance of archaeological sites and
artifacts, as well as the penalties for vandalism. As the archaeological sites within Garey Park will be
exposed to some level of disturbance as a result of public access and park maintenance, SWCA
recommends that:
1)

notice of penalties and fines be posted prominently on signs at the primary and secondary park
entrances, within the park, and potentially on brochures, maps, and receipts. Sign placement,
however, should not draw attention directly to cultural resources. As the former site of the A.M.
Brown cabin is to be used as a gathering point and historic interpretive center, the addition of a
brief prehistoric interpretive display may help guests understand the value of the sites within the
park and help prevent vandalism.

2)

the condition of all sites be monitored twice a year to document the effects of public access, foot
traffic, etc. on site integrity. Site monitoring could easily be incorporated into regularly scheduled
trail and facility maintenance.

3)

sensitive areas on SAL eligible sites 41WM110 and 41WM1282, including existing looters’ pits,
be capped with soil and smoothed to follow the existing contours in order to obscure visible
archaeological features, in order to preserve and protect the buried deposits. The addition of select
vegetation (cacti or other species with shallow root systems) can be utilized in this manner as
well.

4)

should site monitoring document impacts to a site, the THC should be notified to discuss the
extent of disturbance and, if necessary, additional protective measures. Should preservation and
protective measures for sites 41TV110 and 41TV1282 not be possible due to construction and
design changes or constraints, additional investigations (e.g., a phase of excavations at each site)
may be necessary, depending upon consultation with the THC.
