Program Cancellation:

Dear members of the Panhandle Archaeological Society,
I am very sorry, but our meeting for this month must be cancelled as well. There are many factors
in our way of making this next meeting happen, including shelter-in-place orders for the Amarillo and
Canyon areas, social distancing orders for the entire nation until April 30th, and the fact that the libraries
are currently closed to the public (at least according to an email that I received about the cancellation of
the March meeting for Texas Master Naturalist).
Essentially, all April events are out! Science Day has now been postponed until May. They have
not decided on a day in May and it is also possible that it will not happen at all for this school year. If it
does happen in May, I’m sure it will still likely be on a Friday, so, even with that vague information,
please let me know if you think you might be willing and available to do that. The Stone Age Fair has
also been postponed until October. The Amarillo Botanical Gardens is no longer holding Garden Fest in
April. I’m not sure if they plan to reschedule, but I’ll let you know if I hear anything about that, or if you
hear anything, please let me know. I have not been able to get ahold of anyone at Wildcat Bluff Nature
Center, but I think it is still safe to assume that they will likely not be holding their Earth Day event in
April.
Also, for those of you who have not heard, the Texas Archeological Society has cancelled their
2020 summer field school. They have also postponed their Ceramics Academy and Archeology 101
Academy. The new dates for those events have not been decided at this time.
If you are still interested in cultural resource monitoring, please let me know and I will pass that
information along to Chris Podzemny. Hopefully the Amarillo Community Market is still on for the summer, and if you are interested in doing that at all, please let me know. And please let me know of any outreach/volunteering and “just for fun” events that you would like to do! Hopefully this pandemic doesn’t
ruin all of our plans, so let’s keep thinking of stuff to do!
I will provide you with more updated dates and information as I find them or as they are provided
to me. However, should you hear anything before I do, please feel free to let me know.
In this time of great uncertainty concerning this pandemic, please keep checking your email (and
the social media pages if you follow those) to stay up to date on our meetings and events. At this time,
there is no guarantee that we will be able to meet again until September. And even then, who knows!
Hopefully everything has calmed down by then and hopefully we can still have our May 2020 meeting
and have some volunteer opportunities over the summer!
In the meantime, until we all meet again, please be careful, stay safe and well, and stay home as
much as you can! And even with all these limitations and challenges that we face in this crazy time, I
hope you all still manage to have a very happy Easter!

In Memory of Evans Turpin
Dear members of the Panhandle Archaeological Society,

For anyone who may have not heard, Evans Turpin passed away in March of 2020. We
were notified of his passing on March 21st. As a long-time member of the Iraan Archeological
Society and a participant in the Southwestern Federation of Archeological Societies, his love
for history and archeology was recognized by all. He was a dear friend and colleague of many
in our society and he will be greatly missed by all.

Sincerely,

Erin Frigo
Panhandle Archaeological Society President
