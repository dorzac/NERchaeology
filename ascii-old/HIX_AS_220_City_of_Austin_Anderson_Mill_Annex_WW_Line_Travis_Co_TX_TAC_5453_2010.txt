Introduction and Management Summary

INTRODUCTION AND MANAGEMENT SUMMARY
In November of 2009, archeologists at Hicks & Company conducted a 100 percent intensive
linear archeological survey of a 400-meter segment of land as a part of the City of Austin’s
Anderson Mill Annexation project. The cultural resource investigation was conducted on behalf
of design engineers Baker-Aicklen & Associates in coordination with the Texas Historical
Commission (THC) in preparation for the City of Austin’s planned improvements to private
water and wastewater utilities following its incorporation of Anderson Mill. The proposed
project area is located approximately 350 meters southwest of the intersection of Anderson Mill
Road and Pecan Creek Road between Farm to Market (FM) 620 and US 183. The improvements
will involve placing new water and wastewater lines beneath segments of Sierra Blanca Street,
Centennial, Ozark, and Glass Mountain Trails, and Bitteroot and Omaha Circles, comprising a
total project area of 84 acres. The majority of proposed lines will be installed beneath existing
paved roads within a residential neighborhood. The 400-meter segment surveyed remains the
only undeveloped portion of the project area, extending south from Chama Circle toward and
along Laurel Creek, a small tributary of Bull Creek (Figures 1 and 2).
Figure 1: View of adjacent Laurel Creek near the southern terminus of the alignment.

In a letter dated September 23, 2008, Hicks & Company recommended that only those portions
of the improvements located outside of existing streets required archeological survey. The THC
concurred with this recommendation on October 14, 2008. Subsequent to coordination,
engineers removed plans for the lifting station, leaving only the connecting line subject to further
archeological investigation. Archeologists at Hicks & Company carried out the investigation of
the 400-meter segment on November 11, 2009. The project lacks any federal funding or
permitting that would require compliance with Section 106 of the National Historic Preservation
Act (NHPA) of 1966, as amended; however, since the City of Austin will own and control the

Introduction and Management Summary

75-foot easement, the proposed project is subject to the Antiquities Code of Texas (13 TAC 26).
All work was performed under TAC Permit No. 5453 (Appendix A).
During survey, archeologists noted three distinct landform types: an upland terrace at the
northern terminus, intermediary steep slopes, and riparian lowlands through the southern
terminus. Soils in the area consist of upland Tarrant and Brackett soils overlying limestone
bedrock, typically with a depth of less than 30 centimeters (GAT; USDA/NRCS). Intensive
linear archeological survey of the 400-meter segment resulted in documentation of no cultural
resources beyond those associated with Site 41TV1723, a previously recorded burned rock
midden and related lithic scatter that was revisited. Seven of the 15 shovel tests conducted
during survey were within the site boundaries of 41TV1723, though only one shovel test (Shovel
Test 6) was positive for cultural materials. An insignificant amount of cultural resources along
with the site’s overall poor integrity indicates it has minimal research potential. However,
evidence of repeated looting warrants the site’s nomination as a State Archeological Landmark
(SAL) to afford it greater legal protection. In an effort to avoid impacts to a City of Austin
Critical Environmental Feature (CEF; in this instance rimrock) project engineers will be
installing the wastewater line through subsurface boring (Appendix B). This boring will
simultaneously avoid all impacts to Site 41TV1723 as well.
Mason Miller was the Principal Investigator for the project while Samantha Walden served as the
Project Archeologist. Mason Miller and Samantha Walden conducted field investigations and
also authored the report. Twelve man hours were spent completing field investigations. Jerod
McCleland conducted Geographic Information Systems (GIS) processing and map production.
Cheryl Hardy and Melita McAtee aided in report formatting and production. This investigation
followed a no-collection policy and no artifacts were removed from the study area; however, all
project related records and photographs will be permanently curated at the Texas Archeological
Research Laboratory (TARL) in Austin. This report serves as partial fulfillment of the
requirements of TAC Permit No. 5453.

Methodology

METHODOLOGY
Hicks & Company archeologists conducted a 100 percent intensive linear archeological survey
of the proposed 400-meter alignment south of Chama Circle in accordance with the minimum
standards established by the THC for linear projects. Investigators navigated the alignment using
a Trimble GeoExplorerXT sub-meter GPS unit as well as by following survey flags used to
delineate the connecting line corridor. The pedestrian survey was supplemented by 15 shovel
tests, seven of which were excavated within the boundaries of Site 41TV1723, the rest of which
were interspersed along the alignment at a rate of at least one shovel test per every 100 linear
meters. Shovel testing was not conducted in areas with high ground surface visibility (i.e. areas
with exposed bedrock) and was concentrated in areas with a higher probability for artifact
recovery. Shovel tests were excavated to a maximum depth of one meter or termination due to
sterile subsoil, bedrock, or impenetrable matrix, whichever occurred first, and soils were
screened through ¼-inch hardware mesh. All relevant shovel test information was recorded on
standard forms and each was marked using the sub-meter GPS unit. Photographs were taken to
document project area and site condition and to aid in reporting. Due to shallow soil depths,
backhoe trenching was not employed to complete investigations.
One previously recorded archeological site (Site 41TV1723) was revisited during survey. A total
of seven shovel tests were excavated to investigate the resource and delimit its boundaries. Site
boundaries were denoted using the sub-meter GPS unit, and several photographs were taken of
the related features, artifacts, and site area in general. Pertinent information was recorded on a
standard site form, and a revisit form was completed and submitted to TARL to supplement the
existing site file created in August of 1994.

Results of Field Investigations

RESULTS OF FIELD INVESTIGATIONS
Investigations revealed no artifacts or features within the surveyed alignment with the exception
of those associated with Site 41TV1723. Due to shallow soils throughout the project area,
shovel tests did not exceed a depth of 55 centimeters and were overwhelmingly negative with the
exception of Shovel Test 6, located atop the burned rock midden associated with Site 41TV1723.
According to the Blackland Prairie profile from the Texas Parks and Wildlife Department
(TPWD), underlying marls, shales, limestone, and chalks of the Upper Cretaceous result in the
heavy, alkaline, calcareous clays seen within the area. Soils within the alignment are
characterized as Tarrant and Brackett soils, a very stony, clayey soil and gravelly-surfaced soil,
respectively (USDA/NRCS). Most of the shovel tests excavated yielded very dark (10YR3/2) to
black (10YR2/2) dense clay with limestone gravels throughout, immediately overlying limestone
bedrock.
Topography within the project area varies from high upland terrain in the northern portion of the
segment to abrupt slopes leading toward the drainage and riparian lowlands throughout the
remainder of the alignment. The southern 250 meters of the surveyed project area parallels
Laurel Creek approximately five meters to its north until the alignment terminates at the existing
waterline infrastructure. In the interest of clarity, the project area is discussed in reference to the
three distinct landforms observed during survey: the upland northern terminus, intermediary
sloping rock face, and southern 250 meters of riparian lowland.
Upland terrain within the surveyed project area is exclusive to the northern 100 meters of the
alignment near Chama Circle along a residential fenceline (Figure 3). Surface visibility within
this upland locality varied from 40 to 100 percent with some areas composed of completely
exposed limestone bedrock. The three shovel tests conducted in this segment (Shovel Tests 1-3)
did not exceed a depth of five centimeters, and soils generally consisted of very dark clay with
limestone gravels throughout. Shovel Test 2, for example, contained black (5YR2/1) sticky clay
and limestone gravels and reached a total depth of four centimeters. No artifacts were recorded
during survey of the northern quarter of the alignment. Vegetation in the area included low,
sparse grasses, cedar trees, and brush, and disturbance was limited to brush clearing and natural
erosion of the shallow soils.
The intermediary landform steeply slopes toward the drainage directly below the northern upland
for approximately 50 meters (Figure 4). Exposed rock face and sparse vegetation characterize
the alignment as it nears its intersection with an unnamed tributary of Laurel Creek. Surface
visibility varied from zero to 100 percent (with an average of 40 percent), mainly obstructed by
litter from surrounding trees. A total of seven shovel tests were conducted within the area
(Shovel Tests 4-9, 15), all of which were within the site boundaries of 41TV1723. Only one
shovel test was positive for cultural materials (Shovel Test 6), and each exhibited no more than
35 centimeters of compact clay with limestone gravels. Shovel Test 5, for example, was
excavated on the edge of the drainage just below the burned rock midden associated with Site
41TV1723, reaching a depth of ten centimeters with dense, dark (10YR3/2), compact clay and
limestone gravels throughout. Disturbance was limited to natural erosional effects, mainly
flooding associated with the creek below.

Results of Field Investigations

The remaining 250 meters of the alignment closely parallels Laurel Creek and characteristic of
riparian lowlands (Figure 5). Surface visibility was generally low (zero to 50 percent); therefore,
shovel tests were conducted at a rate of at least one per every 100 meters. No artifacts were
recorded in any of the five shovel tests excavated (Shovel Tests 10-14). Shovel Test 12 was
typical of the segment, consisting of dark brown (10YR3/1) dense, crumbly clay, reaching a
depth of 41 centimeters before terminating at sterile subsoil. Shovel tests within the riparian
corridor did not exceed a depth of 55 centimeters and contained varying textures of dark clay.
Erosion within the southern 250 meters of the alignment was moderate to low and was mostly
the result of creek flooding and riparian overgrowth (Figure 6).

terminus of the project area.

Site 41TV1723

SITE 41TV1723
Site 41TV1723 consists of a small, heavily looted burned rock midden with an associated sparse
surficial scatter of lithic debitage and burned rocks located immediately east of the currentlyproposed project alignment (Figure 7). Site 41TV1723 was initially recorded by archeologists
from Horizon Environmental as part of their 1994 survey of the area. Site Atlas maps indicate
that the site is not at this mapped location but is rather on the higher upland, essentially adjacent
to the house around which the proposed waterline passes. However, initial data recorded
matches site characteristics observed in the field, therefore the current field efforts are considered
a site revisit. Site data was not accessible on the Sites Atlas, and a copy of the field report from
that survey was not readily available, however Horizon was able to provide archived electronic
recording data for the site to Hicks & Company. This data indicated it was recorded as a burned
rock midden with an associated scatter of scrapers, and three limestone manos. The midden was
recorded as heavily disturbed from looting and likely subject to extensive future erosion from
increased impervious cover on the surrounding uplands. Overall the site was estimated to be 40
percent intact and was recommended as ineligible for listing in the NRHP or as a SAL during its
initial recording.

Site 41TV1723

The primary components of the site are located on a slight finger terrace that overlooks the
confluence of Laurel Creek and one of its unnamed tributaries while the sparse surficial artifact
scatter continues south - into the unnamed tributary channel, and east – beyond the study
corridor. The site lies near the low point in a “V”-shaped shallow wash that extends from the
rock face to the north to Laurel Creek to the south, an a likely high-energy flood area during
periods of heavy rains. The site area is lightly wooded with generally good (60-80 %) surface
visibility, and covered by an extensive riparian canopy of oaks and cedars. While much of the
surrounding area has been subject to disturbance through residential lot construction, the
immediate site area is largely untouched by modern intrusion. In many segments, the site area is
composed of sheets of exposed limestone bedrock, or pockets of minimal soils. Site 41TV1723
was delineated by the extent of surficial lithics and is estimated to be approximately 50 meters
(NE-SW) x 30 meters (NW-SE), or 1500 square meters in size.
41TV1723’s lone feature, the burned rock midden, is located at the site’s western periphery,
nearest to the project corridor, but still east of the actual water line footprint (Figure 8). The
midden is generally linear to ovoid in shape and measures approximately 15 meters (E-W) x 7
meters (N-S). At its highest points, the midden stands approximately 1 to 1.5 meters above the
surrounding grade. Four prominent depressions along the midden’s northern (uphill) face appear
to be remnants of looters’ pits with associated spoils scattering farther toward the north
(Figure 9). Rocks within the midden were an even mix of angular and sub-angular-, clearly
burned, and rounded, unburned, fist-sized limestone clasts intermixed within a black to very dark
brown (10YR2/1) dense clay matrix that matched soils encountered in much of the surrounding
survey corridor. Midden soils were noted to distinctly lack any semblance of sooty, ashy
sediment that is common for such features. Looters’ pits were extensive enough that functional
components of the midden (central depression, activity areas, etc.) could not be discerned by
survey-level efforts.

Site 41TV1723

Figure 9: Looters’ pits along northern/central portions of the midden.

A very scant and diffuse complement of artifacts was encountered on the midden surface and on
the ground surface surrounding it (1-2 artifacts per 10 x 10 meter area). Most notable of these
artifacts was a single nearly complete Stage 3 biface lying on a rock in the center of the tributary
channel along the site’s southern boundary (Figure 10). The tool measured seven centimeters in
length and approximately four centimeters in width and approximately 0.75 centimeters thick at
its thickest point. The biface is composed of strongly-banded gray chert with a prominent, white
coarse-grained inclusion band near its distal tip. The tool did not appear to be completely
worked and did not exhibit any apparent use wear.
No other tools were found in any other portions of the site area; however, surficial lithic flakes
(primarily secondary and tertiary flakes) and occasional burned rock clasts were noted,
particularly on the midden surface. Additionally, archeologists walked the tributary channel and
observed its cutbanks along the length of the site corridor, noting five to seven additional flakes
near the channel profile’s upper surface. Archeologists observed a conspicuous lack of
additional artifacts in non-midden surficial contexts at the site, though a single tertiary flake was
observed on the ground surface adjacent to Shovel Test 8 (see below). This lack of surface
artifacts in the midden periphery is likely attributed to flood wash, given the lack of soils in the
area and the likely high-energy context in which the site is located. Flakes observed in the
tributary cutbank are likely attributed to those flooding episodes.

In completing archeological investigations, archeologists excavated seven shovel tests on the
midden and in the surrounding site area. Of those seven, one shovel test (Shovel Test 6, dug on
the top of the midden) was positive for cultural materials (three tertiary flakes and one small
charcoal chunk) in the upper 20 centimeters (Table 1). The flakes were gray and tan limestone
chert measuring approximately 1-2 centimeters in diameter with no apparent use wear. One of
the flakes did exhibit a prominent recess along one edge that was reminiscent of a projectile
point shoulder and a distinct point that could have been used as a burin or drill. The single
charcoal chunk measured approximately 5 millimeters in diameter and appeared to the
investigator to be very clean and likely the result of a more recent burning episode. One
additional flake was observed on the ground surface immediately adjacent to this test (Figure
11). No scrapers or manos, as noted by the site’s earlier recorders, were observed during the
current investigations.

Figure 11: Tertiary flakes observed in (and adjacent to) Shovel Test 6 (possible burin/drill

Shovel tests indicated that, away from the midden, soils were generally very shallow (2-40
centimeters) and composed of black, dense, cobbly clay loam overlying solid limestone bedrock.
As mentioned above, within the midden itself, shovel tests were deeper, but composed of matrix
that was not appreciably different from the prevailing soils.
From available information gathered during the course of the current investigations, Site
41TV1723 does not appear to warrant further investigation and has minimal research potential
beyond that gathered during this and previous survey. The midden is heavily looted with only
minimal associated artifacts observed in its vicinity. It is possible that more extensive

Site 41TV1723

excavations within the midden itself could isolate functional components and shovel tests did
contain at least one small piece of charcoal; however, the extent of disturbance within the
midden’s central region has likely severely limited its research potential while the charcoal itself
was attributed to a more modern burning episode. The lack of sediments and nominal
complement of associated artifacts on the surrounding ground surface indicates that the site has
been subject to extensive erosion and it is likely that artifacts attributed to the occupation itself
have long since been washed away during previous sheet wash episodes. When Site 41TV1723
was initially recorded, it was recommended as ineligible for listing as a SAL and further
investigations at the site were not recommended.
While the project centerline likely avoids impacts to the midden and only clips the western edge
of the site boundary (if at all), the project engineer is already avoiding impacts to the rimrock to
the site’s immediate north (categorized as a City of Austin CEF) by installing the line through
steel-encased subsurface boring. This boring, in turn, is also avoiding any impacts to Site
41TV1723 (see Appendix B).
Citing the abundance of evidence of repeated looting episodes in the midden, Hicks & Company
does not concur with previous investigators regarding 41TV1723’s overall SAL eligibility.
Hicks & Company recommends that, despite its limited research potential, the midden does
warrant additional legal protection to dissuade further site disturbance and should be nominated
as a SAL under eligibility Criterion 5 outlined in Section 26.8 of the Antiquities Code of Texas
(below).
(1) the site has the potential to contribute to a better understanding of the prehistory and/or
history of Texas by the addition of new and important information;
(2) the site's archeological deposits and the artifacts within the site are preserved and intact,
thereby supporting the research potential or preservation interests of the site;
(3) the site possesses unique or rare attributes concerning Texas prehistory and/or history;
(4) the study of the site offers the opportunity to test theories and methods of preservation,
thereby contributing to new scientific knowledge;
(5) the high likelihood that vandalism and relic collecting has occurred or could occur, and
official landmark designation is needed to insure maximum legal protection, or
alternatively further investigations are needed to mitigate the effects of vandalism and
relic collecting when the site cannot be protected.
With the site successfully avoided by proposed construction, only a small portion of the midden
will fall within an easement owned by the City of Austin. The overwhelming majority of
41TV1723 is located within private land and landowner approval will be required prior to SAL
listing.

Conclusions and Recommendations

CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS
Under TAC Permit No. 5453, archeologists from Hicks & Company, on behalf of the City of
Austin, intensively surveyed a 400-meter segment of proposed water line improvements in the
Anderson Mill area in northern Travis County. The study corridor begins at the edge of Chama
Circle and extends south to Laurel Creek, where it turns to the west, following the channel edge
to its terminus at a junction with existing waterlines. Investigators found the study corridor to
carry minimal depositional potential with shallow rocky, uplands to the north and denselywooded riparian zones along Laurel Creek to the south, with an intermediary rock face. Fifteen
shovel tests were excavated during the course of investigations with one, Shovel Test 6, being
positive for prehistoric lithic debitage and charcoal. This positive test was excavated within
previously-recorded Site 41TV1723, which was composed of a looted burned rock midden and
an associated light surficial lithic and burned rock scatter. The site is in a likely high-energy
flood zone that is subject to repeated scouring episodes, resulting in a generally low complement
of artifacts associated with the midden. Citing the abundance of disturbance from looting and a
general paucity of associated artifacts, current investigations indicate that the site has minimal
research potential. Nonetheless, project engineers have elected to bore the wastewater line
segment adjacent to the site area to avoid further impact to the midden.
While the site is not likely to be impacted by the current proposed construction and is considered
to be of minimal research potential, the evidence of extensive looting indicates that the site
warrants legal protection as a SAL under nomination Criterion 5 (“the high likelihood that
vandalism and relic collecting has occurred or could occur an official landmark designation is
needed to insure maximum legal protection, or alternatively further investigations are needed to
mitigate the effects of vandalism and relic collection when the site cannot be protected”) outlined
in Section 26.8 of the Antiquities Code of Texas. The site is largely located within private land
and landowner approval would be required prior to nomination.
Beyond Site 41TV1723, no other archeological materials, features, or other evidence of cultural
activity were encountered and the project has minimal potential to impact significant
archeological resources. The project is recommended to proceed to construction with no further
coordination required under the Antiquities Code of Texas. In the unlikely event that
archeological resources are identified during the course of construction that was not identified
during the field survey, all work in the immediate vicinity should cease until such time as the
THC can be contacted and those resources can be assessed for SAL eligibility. Hicks &
Company offers this report in partial fulfillment of TAC Permit No. 5453. Upon approval of the
final report, Hicks & Company will curate all project related materials at TARL.
