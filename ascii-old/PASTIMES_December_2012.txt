Studer Banquet Features Richard and Shirley Flint

Studer Banquet Guest Speakers Richard and Shirley Flint, Saturday Evening, December 15, 2012 at the
Panhandle-Plains Historical Museum Hazlewood Room (2nd Floor), 2503 4th Avenue, Canyon, TX.

Where on Earth Was the Coronado Expedition Going?
Richard and Shirley Flint will discuss some of the geographical misconceptions that motivated the Coronado Expedition, especially the notion that what we know as North America was still thought by most Europeans in the late 1530s to be a part of Asia. Literally,
most members of the Coronado Expedition thought they would reach China when they
left Mexico City in late fall 1539.

The Borger Bridge Site 1971 Pictures from November issue were mislabeled as a NORPAN excavation. Thanks to Rolla Shaller for setting the record straight and adding
these additional comments:
The Borger Bridge Site PPHM A34 was not excavated by NORPAN. They were no longer in existence.
Organizations included in the excavations were the Panhandle Archaeological Society, West Texas State
University Anthropological Society, Panhandle -Plains Historical Museum, Amarillo College and other volunteers.
The Crew Chiefs for the excavations were Roy Thompson, Ray Thompson, Stan James, Terry Gerhardt,
Bill Harrison, Dick Carter, Jerry McGlohan, James Reese, and Charles Oman.
Files, excavation records including profiles, newspaper clippings, Bill Harrison’s and Jack T. Hughes
field notes are all on file at the PPHM. Maybe the files should be looked at for other useful information to
add to farther discussions of the site.

From Chris Linz and Dick Carter: The man in “Beginning Level 3” in the lower right of Page 6 is Jack T.
Hughes.

Searching for Custer and the 7th Cavalry in Wheeler County
