MANAGEMENT SUMMARY

This report presents the results of an intensive archeological survey conducted by Geo-Marine,
Inc., under subcontract to Quaternary Resource Investigations, LLC, for the General Services
Administration. The proposed project involves the construction of a build-to-suit office for the
Social Security Administration. The project area encompasses approximately 9.5 acres fronting
North Beach Street between East Long Avenue and Stanley-Keller Road in Fort Worth, Tarrant
County, Texas. This document provides an assessment of the cultural resources within the
proposed project area pursuant to Sections 106 and 110 of the National Historic Preservation Act.
Fieldwork for this project was conducted on 6 July 2011 by Geo-Marine, Inc., Project
Archeologist Christopher Goodmaster. Much of the project area has been subjected to grounddisturbing activities associated with recent commercial development, railroad and underground
utility easements, and the expansion and maintenance of North Beach Street. No significant
cultural resources were encountered during this survey. It is therefore recommended that
construction of the proposed Social Security Administration building be allowed to proceed. No
artifacts were collected during this fieldwork. All other materials generated by this project will
be housed at the Geo-Marine office in Plano.

INTRODUCTION
This report presents the results of an intensive archeological survey conducted by Geo-Marine,
Inc. (project #30623.00.15), under subcontract to Quaternary Resource Investigations, LLC, for
the General Services Administration. The proposed project involves the construction of a buildto-suit office for the Social Security Administration.
The project area encompasses
approximately 9.5 acres of currently undeveloped property fronting North Beach Street between
East Long Avenue and Stanley-Keller Road in Fort Worth, Tarrant County, Texas (Figure 1).
Located near the city limits of Fort Worth and Haltom City, the project area is approximately 4.5
miles (mi; 7.2 kilometers [km]) northeast of downtown Fort Worth.
The purpose of these investigations was to determine the presence/absence of archeological
resources (as defined by 36 CFR 800.4) and to evaluate identified resources for their eligibility
for inclusion in the National Register of Historic Places (NRHP), as per Sections 106 and 110 of
the National Historic Preservation Act of 1966, as amended. The archeological fieldwork
conducted for this project conforms to the guidelines set forth in the Archeological Survey
Standards for Texas proposed by the Council of Texas Archeologists (CTA) and adopted by the
Texas Historical Commission (THC). This investigation consisted of a background literature and
site records review, an assessment of archival sources, and a systematic intensive archeological
survey of the project area. Fieldwork for this project was conducted on 6 July 2011 by GeoMarine Project Archeologist Christopher Goodmaster. A total of 8 person-hours was spent
conducting fieldwork. Melissa Green served as the project Principal Investigator throughout the
process of this investigation. Although no artifacts were collected during this investigation, all
other materials generated by this project will be permanently housed at the Geo-Marine office in
Plano.
The following sections of this report provide a review of the environmental setting and cultural
context of the region, and summarize the methods, results, and recommendations of this cultural
resources survey. Following the main body of the report is a complete list of all references cited.

ENVIRONMENTAL SETTING
The proposed project area is located within the generally flat uplands of the Grand Prairie, an
ecological subdivision of the Blackland Prairie situated between the Eastern and Western Cross
Timbers in central Tarrant County, Texas (Griffith et al. 2004). This region is located within the
Texan biotic province (Blair 1950), which supports a variety of flora and fauna. The project area
occupies an elevation range of 558â587 feet (ft; 170â179 meters [m]) above mean sea level
(amsl) with slopes of 0â3 percent (Figure 2). The soils in this region are predominantly clay-rich
vertisols derived from the in situ weathering of the underlying Early Cretaceous-age limestones,
marls, and clays of the Pawpaw, Weno Limestone, and Denton Clay formations (Bureau of
Economic Geology 1987; Hill 1901). The project area is situated within the upper Trinity River
drainage basin. Little Fossil Creek, an intermittent drainage that dissects the Grand Prairie, is
located to the southwest. The project area is situated across one soil complex and two soil series
(Table 1; see Figure 2). Information regarding the soils of the project area has been synthesized
and summarized from data supplied by the Soil Conservation Service (Ressel 1981) and the
Natural Resources Conservation Service (2011). A minor portion of the project area,
approximately 0.3 acres, consists of the poorly developed floodplain of Little Fossil Creek. This

area is occupied by the silty clay soils of the Frio series and supports dense vegetation. A 2.2Â­
acre portion of project area occupies a dissected terrace above Little Fossil Creek. This area
supports a more dense concentration of trees, and the soils are mapped as the Sunev-Urban Land
complex. These areas have been heavily disturbed by earth-moving and dumping activities.
Approximately 7 acres of the project area occupies a level upland mantled by soil mapped as
Sanger clay. This area supports a variety of forbs, gramminoids, mixed hardwoods, and junipers.
The easternmost portion of this area has been disturbed by earth-moving activities associated with
the recent expansion of North Beach Street, and the westernmost portion has been disturbed by a
buried natural gas pipeline corridor. The southern margin of the project area has been recently
disturbed by the construction of a light commercial complex. In light of these modern
disturbances, perhaps 50 percent of the project area remains undisturbed.

CULTURAL HISTORY
Prikryl (1987, 1990) established a generalized prehistoric chronological framework of six periods
for the upper Trinity River basin. Investigations at Lewisville Lake in Denton County (Lebo and
Brown 1990) and Joe Pool Lake in Dallas County (Peter and McGregor 1988) refined this
framework to a four-period model. The overall regional applicability of the phases recognized at
both lakes, however, remains to be demonstrated. The generalized chronology presented here
(Table 2) reflects the present state of knowledge as interpreted from both sets of investigations
but is based primarily on the model provided by Peter and McGregor (1988). Lebo and Brown
(1990; Brown and Lebo 1991) present a chronology formulated specifically for Lewisville Lake,
but it closely follows the chronology proposed for Joe Pool Lake. Detailed synopses of the
chronology of the area can be found elsewhere and will therefore not be discussed in this report.

PREVIOUS INVESTIGATIONS
Prior to fieldwork, review of the Texas Archeological Sites Atlas maintained by the THC
indicated that four previous cultural resources survey have been conducted within 1 mi (1.6 km)
of the proposed project area. A 1991 cultural resources survey for the Federal Highway
Administration investigated a 3-mi (4.9-km) section of the North Beach Street corridor. No
additional information is available regarding the survey. In 2004, Geo-Marine, Inc., conducted a
cultural resources survey to the northwest of the proposed project area for the General Services
Administration (Dongarra and Hunt 2005). After encountering two historic-aged cornerstones
during construction at the Tarrant County Juvenile Center, AR Consultants, Inc., documented
remains of the Tarrant County Poor Farm (1879âc. 1960) southwest of the proposed project area
(Davis and Todd 2008). These historic-period remains were designated as site 41TR222 and
were recommended to be not eligible for inclusion in the NRHP. The most recent cultural
resources survey in the vicinity was conducted by Geo-Marine, Inc., in 2009 for the Texas
Department of Transportation along the Tower 55 Reliever corridor, which extends to the north
of the proposed project area (Tinsley and Forbes 2010).
Based on these previous cultural resources survey efforts, one archeological site has been
previously documented within 1 mi (1.6 km) of the proposed project area. Site 41TR222, located
1 mi (1.6 km) southwest of the proposed project area, consists of the remains of the Tarrant
County Poor Farm, which was established in 1879 and operated until the 1960s. Due to previous
ground-disturbing activities at the site and the lack of significant architectural or archeological
remains, the site was recommended as not eligible for inclusion in the NRHP (Davis and Todd
5

2008:22). In addition to previously recorded archeological site 41TR222, the historic-aged
Peoples Burial Park (also known as the Fretwell and New Trinity cemeteries) is located
approximately 0.9 mi (1.5 km) to the southeast of the proposed project area. Neither site
41TR222 nor the Peoples Burial Park will be adversely affected by the proposed project.
The closest previously recorded prehistoric archeological site to the proposed project area exists
on the floodplain along the West Fork of the Trinity River nearly 3 mi (4.9 km) to the southwest,
indicating that prehistoric archeological sites are rare in the uplands of the Grand Prairie.
Therefore, the probability of encountering prehistoric cultural resources within the proposed
project area is considered low. The presence of site 41TR222 and the Peoples Burial Park within
1 mi (1.6 km) of the project area, coupled with the proximity to both Fort Worth and Haltom
City, indicates that there is at least a moderate probability for the existence of historic-period
cultural resources within the project area.

METHODS
ARCHIVAL METHODS
Various sources of historical and geographic data were consulted to ascertain the likelihood of
historic-era structural cultural resources existing within the proposed project area. These
materials included historic highway maps, topographic maps, and soil surveys (which often
record cultural resources such as cemeteries, houses, and related features) and aerial photography.
With the exception of the Union Pacific Railroad (UPRR; formerly the Texas and Pacific
Railroad and more recently the Missouri Pacific Railroad) right-of-way, which has occupied its
current corridor since the late nineteenth century, historic period land use of the project area
appears to have been minimal. The home of J. Earl is depicted on the opposite side of Little
Fossil Creek, approximately 0.1 mi (0.16 km) southwest of the project area, on the 1895 Sam
Street map of Tarrant County. Based on a review of the 1920 Tarrant County soils map and the
1930 Chamber of Commerce map prepared by Utter and Evans, Inc., no historic development
appears to have taken place within the project area in the early twentieth century. By the midÂ­
twentieth-century, the floodplain and terrace above Little Fossil Creek had been extensively
disturbed, as recorded on 1952 United States Geological Survey (USGS) aerial photography. The
remainder of the project area appears to have been in pasture or prairie at that time. Two primary
structures are depicted on the opposite side of North Beach Street on the 1955 USGS 7.5-minute
(1:24,000-scale) Haltom City topographic map. Riparian and prairie vegetation appear to have
reclaimed the extensively disturbed portions of the project area by the late 1960s, as depicted on
1968 USGS aerial photography. By the mid-1970s, the floodplain and terrace above Little Fossil
Creek had again been extensively disturbed, as recorded on 1974 National Aeronautics and Space
Administration (NASA) aerial photography.
Additionally, aerial photography and low-altitude satellite imagery recorded during the last 15
years was reviewed to determine the rate and degree of recent urban and suburban development
within the project area. These sources indicate that much of the project area has been subjected to
extensive ground-disturbing activities. Post-1990 residential development in the vicinity of the
project area necessitated the expansion of North Beach Street. Between late 2003 and early 2005,
the southern portion of the project area was disturbed by the construction of a light commercial
development on the adjacent parcel. A buried Chesapeake Energy natural gas pipeline and
6

cathodic protection test station parallels the UPRR corridor on the northwestern portion of the
project area. Based on this review, approximately 50 percent of the project area is likely to
remain undisturbed.

SURVEY METHODS
The proposed project area was intensively investigated to determine the presence of cultural
resources using a combined technique of systematic reconnaissance and the excavation of
screened shovel tests. Each shovel test was approximately 40 centimeters (cm; 16 inches [in]) in
diameter and excavated in approximately 20-cm (8-in) arbitrary levels to 80 cm (32 in) below
surface, or until subsoil was encountered. Due to the high clay content of the soil and the drought
conditions at the time of survey, the excavated soil from each shovel test could not be passed
through 0.635-cm (0.25-in) mesh screen to facilitate the recovery of artifacts and was
systematically troweled through. The location of each shovel test was recorded with a submeterÂ­
accurate TrimbleÂ® GeoXHâ¢ global positioning system (GPS) unit, and the soil profile exposed
in each of the shovel tests was documented on standardized forms. All areas not intensively
investigated due to prior disturbance were documented. Digital photographs were used to
document the survey conditions, disturbances, and any cultural features observed. All data
generated from this project will be permanently housed at the Plano office of Geo-Marine at the
conclusion of the project.

RESULTS
The majority of the project area is located in a generally level upland setting that gradually slopes
to the terrace and floodplain of Little Fossil Creek (Figures 3 and 4). Ground cover consists of
tall grasses and scattered trees across the upland portion of the project area with increasing
riparian forest cover in proximity to Little Fossil Creek. Ground surface visibility was highly
variable across the project area and ranged from zero to 100 percent. The land use in the
surrounding area is transitioning from a rural landscape to a mixed residential and light
commercial suburban landscape. The majority of development within the project area has
occurred over the last decade in response to the rapid growth rate of Fort Worth and Haltom City.
Twenty shovel tests were excavated to assess the presence of buried cultural resources within the
project area (Figure 5). The majority of shovel tests excavated within the project area
encountered either disturbed fill or exhibited truncated soil profiles (Table 3). The depths of
shovel tests varied from 20â80 cm (8â24 in), depending on the degree of previous disturbance.
Shovel Test (ST) 1 encountered an undisturbed soil profile, consisting of dark grayish brown
(10YR 3/2 and 4/2) clay, typical of the Sanger series soils of the Grand Prairie region. The areas
investigated by STs 2 and 3 exhibited truncated and disturbed soils, respectively; likely disturbed
by the construction of the Chesapeake Energy natural gas pipeline and cathodic protection test
station. At the location of ST 7 (Figure 6), surface artifacts consisting of two fragments of yellow
glazed refined earthenware ceramics with exterior molding (ca. 1930â1960) were observed. STs
8â11 were excavated around ST 7 in 5-m (16-ft-) intervals, but no additional artifacts were
encountered. These artifacts are likely associated with the primary structure depicted on the
opposite side of Beach Street on the 1955 USGS Haltom City topographic map. These artifacts
do not constitute an archeological site and were recorded as Isolate 1. Along the southern margin
of the project area, surface artifacts consisting of a fragment of blue tableware glass, a blue-glazed

ceramic tile fragment, and a machine-made brick fragment were observed within an area
disturbed by construction of the light commercial complex to the south (Figure 7). STs 13â15
were excavated along the southern margin of the project area in 10-m (33-ft-) intervals, but no
additional artifacts were encountered. These artifacts are likely associated with the modern (postÂ­
1950) dumping activities that took place in the southwestern portion of the project area, as
described below. These artifacts do not constitute an archeological site and were recorded as
Isolate 2. The southwestern portion of the project area, encompassing approximately 1 acre
(Figure 8), was found to be almost entirely devoid of topsoil. Observed across the area was a
diffuse and fragmentary scatter of modern artifacts (Figure 9), consisting of machine-made brick
fragments, concrete fragments, sheet metal, sheet vinyl, asphalt shingles, white-glazed ceramic
tile, blue-glazed ceramic tile, asbestos tile fragments, colorless and amber glass fragments,
window glass fragments, steel sanitary cans, glazed and unglazed coarse earthenware ceramic
fragments, three brown glazed refined earthenware ceramic fragments, one refined earthenware
ceramic fragment with a blue geometric decal decoration, and one aqua glass insulator fragment.
The surface artifact density decreases from southwest to northeast. Two concentrations of irises
(Iris sp.) and at least five piles of concrete and cinder blocks were observed within this area
(Figure 10). Due to the presence of architectural and domestic artifacts, as well as the presence of
domesticated plants, five shovel tests (STs 16â20) were excavated in 20-m (66-ft) intervals in a
cruciform pattern across the area of observed surface artifacts. No additional artifacts or
architectural features were encountered in these excavations. No structures are recorded at this
location on any of the historic maps or aerial photographs reviewed. This area, encompassing the
floodplain and much of the terrace of Little Fossil Creek, has been extensively disturbed by
modern ground-disturbing activities, as documented on 1952, 1968, and 1974 aerial photography.
It is likely that this area was used between the late 1950s and mid-1970s as a dumping area for
domestic and construction refuse. This area does not constitute an archeological site.

None of the isolated surface artifacts or the modern (post-1950) dumping area documented during
this survey is believed to have the potential to contribute significant information regarding the
history of the area. In the absence of additional artifacts in more well-preserved contexts or intact
structures or other cultural features, none of these areas meet the criteria for archeological site
designation and are therefore not eligible for inclusion in the NRHP as per 36 CFR 60.4. It is
therefore recommended that no further work is necessary at these locations.

RECOMMENDATIONS
The results of the reconnaissance and intensive archeological survey conducted within this 9.5Â­
acre parcel for the proposed build-to-suit Social Security Administration office did not encounter
any significant cultural materials and indicated that the majority of the project area has been
significantly disturbed by modern activities associated with rapid suburban growth. None of the
isolated surface artifacts or modern dumping materials is believed to have the potential to
contribute significant information regarding the history of the area. Additionally, no historic-age
architectural resources are located within the project vicinity. No historic properties, as defined
by 36 CFR 60.4, were identified during the archeological investigation of the parcel. The upland
setting and the scarcity of a reliable water supply indicate that prehistoric archeological remains
within the project area are not probable. The only water supply near the project area is Little
Fossil Creek, an intermittent tributary of Fossil Creek. Any intact deposits that may have been
associated with this drainage have been adversely affected by repeated dumping and clearing
episodes along the narrow terrace and floodplain of the drainage. Historic remains (e.g., remains
from early farmsteads or tenant houses), although more likely to be encountered within the
region, were not found during this survey. If any archeological resources had been present within
the project area, previous impacts from road construction, buried utility placements, and
commercial construction would have severely compromised the integrity of such resources.
Therefore, based on the results of this survey, there is low to no potential for deposits containing
archeological materials within the proposed project area. In accordance with 36 CFR 800.4(d)(2),
no further investigation is recommended.
