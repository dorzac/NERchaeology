Abstract

Antiquities Planning & Consulting (APC), Kyle, Texas, conducted an intensive
cultural resources survey of 2.7 acres in preparation for the construction of a new
maintenance facility for the City of Austin’s Zilker Park***. The results were positive.
Prehistoric and historic deposits were found in the Area of Potential Effect (APE) where
the new construction will take place. To determine if the deposits were a part of existing
Site 41TV1364, the survey was extended outside the APE. An additional 24 acres were
inspected for surficial material for a total area covered of 26.7 acres.
The survey was performed under Antiquities Permit 5162. No diagnostic artifacts
were recovered from the surface or from controlled shovel tests or backhoe trenches.
Redundant prehistoric and historic materials were recovered and analyzed and discarded.
No artifacts were collected and not artifacts were curated.
The newly found deposits were shown to be part of significant Site 41TV1364.
However, the newly found deposits were also found not to be a contributing factor to the
site’s State Antiquities Landmark (SAL) and National Register of Historic Places
(NRHP) eligibility status. APC therefore concludes that no significant components of Site
41TV1364 will be affected by the proposed construction activity and no further
investigation is needed.
APC recommends therefore, that construction proceed as planned, with no further
cultural resources investigation. If the project design is changed and the change will
affect the newly found parts of the site, the locales should be inspected by archeologists
before construction begins. Lastly, if any unexpected cultural resources are uncovered
during construction, digging should stop at that location, and the Texas Historical
Commission (THC) should be notified by telephone at (512) 463-6096. Activity should
ceases at the location until the find is evaluated by an archeologist in consultation with
the THC.

*** Note: The project was canceled by the City of Austin. The new maintenance
facility was not constructed. The existing maintenance facility will not be
demolished and will continue to be used. There are no plans to resurrect the project.

1.0 EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

The City of Austin (COA) proposes to relocate the Zilker Park Maintenance
Facility from the Barton Creek floodplain to an upland location in the west part of the
park currently in use as a disc golf course in 2009. *** Approximately 2.7 acres will be
affected by the construction which is situated inside the limits of the Barton Springs
Archeological and Historical District. For this reason, the proposed new facility locale
was intensely surveyed for cultural resources by Antiquities Planning & Consulting
(APC) in accordance with the Texas Antiquities Code and under Texas Antiquities
Permit Number 5162.
The survey was sponsored by Weston Solutions, Inc., on behalf of the COA. Due
to positive finds in the Area of Potential Effect (APE) where new construction will occur,
the survey was extended beyond the APE to cover the stream terrace south of Barton
Spring Drive and north of Andrew Zilker Road where the Polo Fields and the Disc Golf
Course are currently located. In all, 26.7 acres were examined. Although the results were
positive, no diagnostic artifacts were found and therefore, no artifacts were curated.
New archeological deposits were found and the boundary of previously recorded
portion of Site 41TV1364 will be impacted by the proposed activity and that no
additional archeological investigations s needed. APC, therefore, recommends that
construction of he proposed Zilker Park Maintenance Facility proceed as planned. Lastly,
if any unexpected cultural resources are uncovered during construction, digging should
stop at the discovery location, and the Texas Historical Commission (THC) should be
notified by telephone at (512) 463-6096. Activity should ceases at the location until the
find is evaluated by an archeologist in consultation with the THC.
The existing Zilker Park maintenance building is located to the east of the current
study area adjacent to Barton Creek. Decommissioning of the existing building will be
undertaken at a later date. Before the building is demolished, additional archeological
work will be performed to determine the contents and integrity of any 41TV1364
deposits present beneath the existing maintenance facility locale. The additional work
will be conducted and the findings reported under separate antiquities permit and are not
included in the current scope of work

*** Note: The project was canceled by the City of Austin. The new maintenance
facility was not built. The existing maintenance facility was not demolished and will
continue to be used. No additional work cultural resources work will be performed
at the existing facility locale. There are no plans to resurrect the project.

2.0 PROPOSED ZILKER PARK MAINTENANCE FACILITY
INTRODUCTION
The COA Parks and Recreation Department plans to construct a new maintenance barn
and decommission the existing one at Zilker Park. As part of the project, buried and above-the
ground utilities will also be installed. The proposed location falls inside the Barton Springs
Archeological and Historical District. The reason for the cultural resources survey is to
determine the presence and/or absence of significant intact archeological resources that might be
affected by the proposed action, in accordance with the Texas Antiquities Code. At this time,
decommission of the existing maintenance facility is not a part of the current survey
investigation. Instead, it will take place in the future, and the findings will be reported under
separate cover and a separate permit. Reported below are characteristics of the proposed new
facility locale.
PROJECT AREA
The project area is located in the center of Austin, Texas on the banks of the Colorado
River (Figure 1). The proposed facility will be located in Zilker Park west of the Polo Field,
between Andrew Zilker Drive and Columbus Drive near the Girl Scout Cabin (Figure 2).
Reported historic land use included a mission, a plantation, mills, and an ice house (Humphrey
and Crawford 1992). In 1918 and in 1932, A. J. Zilker donated the land to the City of Austin that
was developed into Zilker Park (http://www.ci.austin.tx.us/zilker).

The project area climate is mild to humid with about 32.5 inches of rainfall per annum
(Werchan et al. 1974). The project area straddles the uplands, the flood plain stream terrace, and
the transitional slope between. The uplands consist of a rocky limestone hill overlooking a stream
terrace of the Colorado River. Elevations in the uplands range from 530 feet above mean sea level
(ft amsl) on the south to 520 ft amsl on the north with a slope of ca 5 per cent. At the base of the
hill, from 520 ft amsl to 517 ft amsl, is a gradual slope where colluvial sediments and alluvial
sediments from the flood plain mix. Flood plain elevations are 517 ft amsl to 509 ft amsl.
Tarrant Soil Associations cover the project area (Werchan et al. 1974). Tarrant, Rolling
clay, is present in the uplands and Tarrant clay, 0-2 percent slope, in the flood plain. The soils are
shallow, rocky, clayey soils over limestone. A characteristic profile is 50 percent bedrock ground
cover, 0-5 inches of dark grayish brown clay, over 5-8 inches of brown clay, resting on 8-12
inches of decomposing limestone.

To the east, the shallow Tarrant Soils abut Hardeman soils which adjoin Bergstrom soils
located at the confluence of the Colorado River and Barton Creek. These soils mantle the
Colorado River First Street Terrace, one of a series of fluvial terraces identified along the river
(Caran and Mandel 2002). The First Street Terrace deposits at the Vara Daniels Site
(41TV1364), 500 meters to the east of the project were investigated to depths of six meters (19.68
feet) (Collins 1990). Radiocarbon dates collected from the strata were dated at 2600 to 11,000
years ago (Ricklis et al. 1991).
The project area is bordered by two drainages. The western portion of the project area
falls in the Eanes Creek watershed, while the eastern portion is in the Barton Creek watershed.
Both streams drain into the Colorado River, located to the north of the park, and making up the
park=s northern boundary. The park locale and lower portions of the project area were subjected
to periodic floods of historic proportions. In contrast, the uplands have been subject to sheet
wash and deflation. Soils are made up of a rocky, thin silty clay veneer and overly decomposing
limestone. Vegetation consists of oaks and cedar elm with native and introduced understory and
grasses.
PROJECT DESCRIPTION
The APE where new construction will occur is made up of ca. 2.7 acres and includes a
building footprint, parking, underground utility lines, access road, and an above-the-ground storm
catchment area (Figure 3). The building locale is situated in the uplands. Utility lines span the
uplands, cross the transition zone between the uplands and flood plain, and terminate in the
stream terrace that mantles the flood plain.
The existing Zilker Park maintenance facility near the Barton Springs pool will be
replaced with a new building, pole barns, a parking lot, access roads, and utilities covering about
1.3 acres in area. The new facility will be located on a wooded hillside location (Figure 4). The
new metal Maintenance Building (256,000 square feet or .63 acres), retention pond (640 square ft
or .0016 acres), two pole barn locations, and a parking area (3400 square feet or .0083 acres)
will cover about .6399 acres total. The facility locale is rocky and sloping and will require fill to
level roads, parking lots, and slab foundations.
About 1.4 acres of linear utility features will also be constructed to the facility locale
(Figure 5). An access road (0.2 miles x 36 feet wide or .96 acres) will be constructed to the new
location. A water line 800 ft. by 10 feet wide (0.15 miles or .02 acres) 3 feet deep and a
wastewater line 2480 feet by 10 feet wide (.47 miles or .06 acres) up to 2.5 feet deep will also be
installed. A storm water catchment route 1400 ft (0.27 miles or .0324 acres) will also be
inspected; however; no below-the-ground impact is planned for the catchment. The depth of the
utilities will not exceed 36 inches and the width of trenches will not exceed 3 feet.
In addition to the APE, ca 24 acres outside the APE were also examined in order to
ascertain if newly found deposits connected with and were a part of any existing archeological
sites. The new deposits were found to be part of the western limit of Site 41TV1364. Known
41TV1364 boundaries were extended about 500 meters to the west inside the park and to the
north, along the south side of Barton Springs Drive. On the south side, the known site limits
follow the limestone escarpment and Columbus Drive.

CULTURAL HISTORY
Introduction
Zilker Park lies in the Central Texas archeological region (Biesaart et al. 1985). It is a
unique ecotone that attracted prehistoric and historic groups. The park is bounded on the south
by the Balcones Escarpment, on the east by Barton Creek and its springs, on the west by Eanes
Creek, and on the north by the Colorado River. The park contains known archeological sites,
including the Vara Daniel Site, 41TV1364, which, according to Collins (1996a), has been
occupied throughout the known span of human presence in the area.
Prehistory
Barton Springs and Zilker Park have been intensively used by population groups for more
than 10,000 years before the present (BP) (Collins 1990). Evidence of deeply buried prehistoric
materials has been found dating from the PaleoIndian period 11,000 years before the present
(B.P.) to the Late Archaic period (2,500 B.P.) (Collins 1996a). Numerous archeologists have
discussed the prehistory of the park. The reader is directed to Collins et al. (1990), Nash et
al.(2008), Ricklis et al. (1991), Takac et al. (1992), and Voellinger (1992) for detailed discussions
about park prehistory.
History
According to Hendrix (n.d.), the record of ownership begins for parts of the park tract
along Barton Creek (also called Spring Creek), as early as 1835. Settlement at the mount of the
creek began when Billy Barton acquired the Barton Labor and built a cabin on it in 1840. The
tract was acquired by A.B. McGill in the 1850s, sold in 1860 to Phineas de Cordova, who sold it
in 1867 to W.C. Walsh. Colonel Andrew J. Zilker bought the land in 1901.
Zilker first donated part of the parcel to the city in 1917 and later added more acreage in
1928. Development started slowly in the 1920s and accelerated in the 1930s. The Barton Springs
Pool and Dance Pavilion became a popular visitor=s attraction in the 1930s (Figure 6). In 1934,
the Civilian Conservation Corps (CCC) made major improvements to the park (Figure 7). While
making the improvements to the park, the CCC established a camp east of today’s polo field. The
camp operated during the spring, summer, and fall of 1934.

PREVIOUS ARCHEOLOGY
Rock shelters and prehistoric artifact scatters can be found in along Barton Creek from
Barton Springs to Campbell=s Hole (McCormick 1979). Four known archeological sites are
present inside and in the vicinity of the park and are listed below (Texas Archeological Sites
Atlas 2009). Of the four sites, one has been investigated frequently and that is the Vera Daniel
Site, 41TV1364.
41TV2

Crossing
41TV1364
Vera Daniel Site: Prehistoric Deposits Deeply Buried (3 meters to 10
meters)
Stratified from Barton Springs to Soccer Fields
Many levels of archeological investigations have been undertaken at Site 41TV1364
related to the South Austin Outfall wastewater line and a tunnel that will be constructed by the
city. Archeological work at the site began with a pedestrian and mechanical survey, followed by
testing, significance/eligibility testing, and mitigative excavations A brief overview of
investigations follows and the reader is directed to Collins et al. (1990), Nash et al.( 2008),
Ricklis et al. (1991), Takac et al. (1992), and Voellinger (1992) for detailed discussions about
park investigations.
Site 41TV1364 was found using mechanical survey methods north of the Barton Springs
Road in the soccer fields and south of Barton Springs Road in the rugby field and recorded in
1988 (Vollenger 1992). Collins et al. (1990) determined that multiple, stratified components up
to 6 meters deep and dating to 10,000 - 3300 years ago are present on the north side of Barton
Springs. Archeological testing by Ricklis et al. (1991) revealed the presence of stratified
archeological deposits of good integrity sealed by depositional events created by over bank and
back water flooding of the Colorado River beneath the rugby field on the south side of Barton
Springs Road. The study further revealed that the prehistoric occupation in the area of the rugby
field spans PaleoIndian to late Prehistoric time periods from 10,000 years ago to 500 years ago.
The archeological and geomorphological study by Takac et al. (1992) identified nine
natural Late Holocene depositional strata and stratified archeological deposits north of Barton
Springs Road dating from the Middle (4700 B.P.) and Late Archaic (2500-1250 B.P.) periods and
possibly the Late Prehistoric period (600 B. C. to A.D. 700). Two phases of testing investigations
were completed in 2003 and 2006 in the area beneath the rugby field on the south side of Barton
Springs Road. They demonstrated that intact, stratified deposits dating from the middle
PaleoIndian stage (11,500-8500 B.P.) through the Late Archaic (5000-1250 B.P.) period were
recovered. Lastly, the north central portion of the rugby field was recommended for mitigation
and data recovery (Nash et al. 2008). Excavations in the rugby field portion of Site 41TV1364
were underway during the current survey and results are not yet available.
The historic period of the park’s historic archeological deposits have not been as
thoroughly studied by archeologists as the prehistoric period (Hendrix n.d; Nash 2008). Due to
the presence of Barton Springs and its proximity to the State Capitol City of Austin, the Colorado
River, and the river=s low water crossings; the locale played an early part in the history of Central
Texas and the City of Austin. Since 1918, the Barton Springs have been one of the region=s public
natural treasures and one of the City of Austin=s landmark parks since 1934.

3.0 CULTURAL RESOURCES SURVEY
INTRODUCTION
The purpose of the survey is to collect new data from upper strata in parts of Zilker Park
that have not been inspected by archeologists. The goals of the survey are multi-fold. The first
goal is to identify and delineate any archeological deposits present in the area planned for
development known as the Area of Potential Effect (APE). The second is to examine any deposits
present for content, integrity, and relationship to known deposits. Lastly, the third goal is to
formulate management recommendations for any deposits that will be affected by the proposed
development.
RESEARCH DIRECTION
Many archeological investigations have been conducted at Site 41TV1364 (Nash et. al.
2008; Voellinger 1992; Takac 1992; Ricklis et al. 1991; Collins 1990), while few have examined
the uplands above and away from the springs (McCormick 1979; Collins 1996b). An inventory of
National Register-eligible loci in the park resulted in the creation of the Barton Springs
Archeological and Historical District. Portions of the project area fall inside the district
boundaries.
The proposed project area lies outside the previously known archeological site
boundaries. A walk-over of the proposed facility site with COA personnel on February 3, 2009;
however, revealed a surficial scatter of prehistoric Native American artifacts in the uplands. A
sparse (<5 artifacts per square meter of exposure) to moderate (5-10 artifacts per square meter)
scatter of lithic debitage was present in walking trails and in erosional features in the uplands.
The debitage is small (< 5 cm in length) to medium- (5-20 cm in length) sized decorticate flakes
and exhibits a heavy patina.
In addition, at the northern end of the proposed waste water line in the terrace (and the
part of the project area closest to Barton Springs Road), a sparse scatter of historic artifacts was
observed on the surface. The scatter was made up of white ware sherds, a decal -ware sherd, and
clear glass fragments. The types of historic materials represent a residential locale and were
commonly used from 1890s-1940s.
An intensive pedestrian survey with shovel testing is planned for the upland facility
locale. It is not yet known if any intact subsurface archeological deposits are present in the area
planned for construction. In addition, Tarrant soils have not yet been examined in this part of the
park for buried deposits. Backhoe trenching will therefore be used to inspect utility line locales
and confirm the presence or absence of any intact upper cultural zones/strata, and, if present, to
examine them for their cultural affiliation and horizontal and vertical extent. Lastly, the
relationship of any new deposits to previously known deposits will be evaluated.
METHODS
APC reviewed records, reports, and maps from the Texas Archeological Sites Atlas, the
Austin History Center, and the Tex Share San Born map database. Site files and pertinent
literature were researched to develop this scope of work. It was determined that the park is
located in the Barton Springs Historical and Archeological District and is located near the Vara
Daniels Site (41TV1364). In addition, three previously known sites (41TV2, 41TV689, and
41TV690) fall inside the park. Following the background work and before field work, APC
obtained an Antiquities Permit from the THC for an intensive surface and subsurface survey.
Geotechnical borings were taken by Holt Engineering. APC reviewed geo-technical logs to
augment shovel test data.

COA Zilker Maintenance Facility

The survey was conducted by 2-5 personnel between February and April of 2009.
Parallel transects were walked by 2-3 technicians inside the maintenance facility foot print at 1015 meter intervals to locate any features or artifact concentrations in the facility locale. Two
transects were walked inside each of the narrow (<15 feet) utility easements. Shovel tests totaled
four, and were performed at the rates of one per .13 acres at the facility foot print. Six backhoe
trenches were placed along the wastewater line route for the ca. 0.5 miles in the flood plain at the
rate of .4 acres. Although twelve shovel tests per mile for segments of the utility lines in the
uplands were planned for the water line, visibility exceeded 30 per cent and none were dug.
The shovel tests were dug, checkerboard fashion, in the .63-acre location of the facility.
Six shovel tests were planned at regular intervals for the uplands portion of the utility route,
however, soils were deflated and very shallow; therefore, boring data were used instead of shovel
test data. From the transitional slope at the base of the uplands, across the flood plain, another
boring data were also used for the upland portion of the water line, wastewater line, and storm
water catchment routes. Soil from the shovel tests was described and dry-screened using 1/4 inch
mesh. No diagnostic artifacts were collected for laboratory analysis. Non diagnostic and
redundant materials were tallied, described, and discarded.
Backhoe trenching was used to identify deposits within 36 inches/3 feet/ of the surface in
the waste water utility easement. Six backhoe trenches were dug and placed parallel to the
proposed utility right-of-way. They were used to ascertain presence or absence of any intact,
buried cultural strata and examine sediments. A controlled sample of soils from the trench back
dirt was screened using 1/4 inch mesh, dry. No diagnostic artifacts were collected for laboratory
analysis. Non diagnostic and redundant materials were tallied, described, and discarded. One
measured profile was drawn for each trench documenting soils present. Geomorphic study was
not a part of the Scope of Work due to the shallow nature of the proposed impacts.
Due to a paucity of artifacts recovered from shovel testing and backhoe trenching, and
the presence of moderate to dense surficial artifact scatters, a controlled and a random surface
collection were made to examine the attributes for any artifacts present. The controlled surface
collection sample area of 1 meter in diameter was located 10 meters southeast of Holt Bore
Location B0-4 where the maintenance facility will be built. It yielded a sample of concentrated
mixed, temporally compressed material.
A second random sample was taken to collect items not found in the other collections. It
was representative of commonly observed cherts, flake types, and any chipped stone tools. Also
of interest was the condition of artifacts present. The random surface collection consisted of
prehistoric and historic artifacts and was taken throughout the area surveyed. Lastly, the survey
area was extended outside the APE. New archeological deposits/sites encountered during the
survey were determined to be part of Site 41TV1364. Routine documentation procedures were
followed, including shovel testing. A TexSite Revisit Form was completed for the new site data
collected. The new site data was entered into the Texas Archeological Site Atlas electronic
database. Preliminary archival research was performed at the Austin History Center to identify
historic components encountered.
Field notes completed included sketch maps, artifact analysis data, shovel test forms, and
backhoe trenching forms. Data analysis, interpretation, and findings were summarized in this
technical report that follows Council of Texas Archeologists (CTA) standards. Project records
were temporarily stored at APC. Site data will be permanently stored at the Texas Archeological
Research Laboratory, the University of Texas at Austin.

4.0 SURVEY RESULTS

INTRODUCTION
The results were positive and yielded new data about the cultural history of the western
part of Zilker Park. Deposits consisting of mixed prehistoric, historic, and modern materials were
found on the surface in two collection areas and to depths of 24-36 inches below the surface (bs)
in four shovel tests, and five backhoe trenches (Figure 8). Findings further revealed that the new
deposits are part of Site 41TV1364 and extend outside the APE. The newly recorded portion of
Site 41TV1364 continues west to the Mopac/Loop 1 access road and south of Andrew Zilker
Road and Columbus Road. In addition to prehistoric elements, Site 41TH1364 contains
nineteenth and early twentieth century historic components.

PEDESTRIAN SURVEY
The maintenance facility footprint, utility easements, and the route of the existing
wastewater line were walked. Surficial archeological deposits were found in the western part of
the park inside today=s Disc Golf Course where the maintenance facility will be built and in the
Polo Field where the wastewater line will be installed. The new deposits are a part of Site
41TV1364. This fact was confirmed by extending the current study outside the proposed
wastewater line route across the stream terrace to the previously known site limit. Other parts of
the Disc Golf Course and the Polo Field were inspected outside the APE where visibility was 100
percent. Artifacts were present on the surface in disturbed and undisturbed locations and extend
west into the Disc Golf Course toward Eanes Creek. The artifact scatter also increases in
concentration to the east of the Polo Field and connects with the surficial scatter of 41TV1364 in
the Barton Creek flood plain.
Four shovel tests (STs) were dug in the uplands where the maintenance facility will be
constructed and in the newly recorded upland portion of site 41Tv1364. Reddish brown and very

dark gray silty clay loam and silty clay were exposed in tests with many limestone gravels and
loam and silty clay soils were exposed in tests with many limestone gravels and rocks forming a
cobble rock layer in ST#2, ST#3, and ST#4. All soil from shovel tests (30 cm by 40 cm by ca.
20-40 cm deep each) was screened using 1/4 inch mesh. A very small sample of artifacts (n=6)
was recovered and was made up of historic (n=5) and prehistoric (n=1) items from 10-30 cm
below the surface (bs).
ST#1 contained a metal bottle cap (n=1) in Level 1 (0-10cm bs). In ST#2, a single
prehistoric flake (n=1) was recovered from Level 2 (10-20cm bs). ST#3 had clear glass bottle
fragments (n=2) in Level 1 (0-10 cm bs). From ST#4, Level 1 (0-10cm bs), modern brown bottle
glass fragments (n=2) were recovered. All items recovered were described and discarded due to
the fact that they are redundant and/or modern specimens and do not have the potential to provide
important new scientific information (See Appendix I).
MECHANICAL SURVEY
Six back hoe trenches (BHTs) were dug in the new portion of the site located in the
terrace where the wastewater line will be installed and where it will connect with an existing
wastewater line. BHT#1 was placed south of Andrew Zilker Road at the base of the upland slope.
BHT#2, BHT#3, and BHT#4 were in a low-lying transitional zone between the upland margin
and the terace. BHT#5 and BHT#6 were located in the southern part of the terrace. Trenches
measured 10 feet in length by 3 feet wide and ranged from ca. 18-32 inches deep. Levels were
removed in ca. 6-inch increments. Silty clay loam and silty clay soils were exposed in all
trenches. Many limestone gravels and rocks were present in BHT#2, BHT#3, and BHT#4, which
were in a low lying, down cutting drain, flowing into Eanes Creek to the west. The trenches
exposed 4 to 6 inches of Recent reddish-brown silty clay loam overlying 6-32 inches of deposits
thought to be Holocene in age (Figure 9).

A measured sample of the back dirt, ca. 2 cubic meters in volume, was screened from
each of the six trenches using 1/4-inch dry mesh to recover artifacts. Results were positive and
yielded a small sample (n=8) made up of historic (n=3), and prehistoric (n=5) items found from
0-24 inches below the surface. Level 1 (0-6 inches bs) of BHT#1 yielded prehistoric flakes in
Level 1 (0-6inches bs) (n=2) and in Level 2 (7-12 inches bs). No cultural material was recovered
from BHT#2. An clear glass fragment (n=1) was recovered from Level 1 (0-6 inches bs) of
BHT#3, while BHT#4 recovery was a prehistoric flake (n=1) in Level 2 (7-12 inches bs). BHT#5
recovery were lithic shatter (n=1) and a pocket knife (n=1) in Level 1 (0-6 inches bs). BHT#6
recovery was a golf ball (n=1) in Level 2 (7-12 inches bs) (See Appendix II).
GEOTECHNICAL BORINGS
Holt Engineering laid out and drilled nine borings to depths of 6 and 15 feet below
existing grades inside the footprint of the proposed maintenance facility (Figure 10) and collected
borings with stratified sediments. Limestone bedrock was encountered at depths of under 1 foot
deep to 13 feet deep. Deep fill 12-13 feet deep underlain by gravel deposits were encountered at
the base of the slope, indicating the presence of a deep relict stream channel that has been filled in
with colluvial and alluvial fill. The borings show that Recent sediment and colluvial deposits
(termed AFat Clay@) are .7-3 feet deep, while older Late Holocene deposits ( ALean Clay@) range
from about 1-12.5 ft deep. No evidence of cultural material was observed in the auger back dirt
(See Appendix III).

SURFACE COLLECTIONS
The concentration observed in the uplands included modern and historic material such as
plastic screw caps, aluminum ring tabs and tin pull tabs; brown, green, and clear bottle glass; wire
nails and metal fragments, white ware ceramics and decal ware ceramics. The surface scatter
observed in the terrace contains prehistoric and historic artifacts, including evidence of multiple
components within the time periods.
Artifacts were collected from two locations. The first was a controlled 1-meter diameter
surface collection locale inside the footprint of the proposed maintenance facility near locations
that were augered to examine the content and integrity of upper deposits that will be affected by
the new construction. The second collection was taken inside the newly found parts of the site,
outside the APE, to examine contents and condition of newly found surficial deposits.
All items within a delineated one square meter area were collected for a controlled
sample and totaled 29 items, 24 prehistoric and 5 historic specimens. The prehistoric specimens
collected consist of a Uvalde projectile point basal fragment (n=1), a biface fragment (n=1), and
lithic debitage (n=22). The debitage consists of primary (n=2), secondary (n=11), and tertiary
(n=9) whole and broken flakes under 4 cm in length. (See Appendix II). Historic specimens
include nineteenth and twentieth glass (n=2), ceramic (n=1), metal (n=1), and vinyl (n=1) pieces.
A random partial surface artifact sample was collected throughout the site. The sample
(n=46) consisted of representative types of prehistoric raw material, flake types, and flake tools
and historic items observed. It was not 100 percent. The three prehistoric chipped tools collected
are a uniface (n=1) and biface fragments (n=2). Worked and exhausted cores (n=2), flakes
(n=36), and shatter (n=10) were also found. Historic specimens from the random sample included
late nineteenth and early twentieth century glass (n=5), ceramic (n=6), and metal (n=1).
ARCHIVAL RESEARCH
Preliminary archival research showed that structures were present in the early twentieth
century east of the Polo Field where the historic artifact concentration was located during the
survey. There was a reptile farm in Zilker, known as the ATexas Reptile Institute@ run by Mr.
G.E.S. Tordt (Kendall 1934). It was open to the public for snake feeding and venom Amilking@
and was a popular Sunday destination. The Zilker Riding Club made it home in the park (Figure
11). A blacksmith=s house was also present (Figure 12).
From May to September of 1934, a camp of more than 200 Civilian Conservation Corps
(CCC) members lived and worked inside the park for a period of six months (American
Statesman May 29, 1934). An American Statesman newspaper article dated April 24, 1934,
describes the CCC camp and provides facts about it=s construction and operation. Two hundred
workers were stationed there from April or May until the fall of 1934. The camp contained a mess
hall (Figure 13), five camp buildings, and 40 screened tents with floors (Figure 14). The location
of the camp is believed to have been east of the Polo Field.
The CCC workers built paved roads, picnic tables, a caretaker’s house, a bath house,
sunken gardens and ponds, and walking and bridal paths. Other tasks were construction of
lookouts, move the reptile farm, build a riding ring, perform tree surgery and ant eradication,
build foot and horse trails and bridges, the polo field, outdoor fire places, and create desert and
rock gardens (American Statesman July 2, 1934). All improvements were completed in time for
a 4th of July opening in 1934 and most are still in use today.

5.0 ARCHEOLOGICAL SITE 41TV1364
As a result of the survey findings, the boundary of the Vera Daniel Site, 41TV1364, was
extended to the west ca. 400 meters from the rugby field. It spans the Polo Field and covers the
disc golf course. Deposits were observed from Barton Springs Road south to Columbus Drive.
Historic components were identified that are also part of the site. The upper components of the
newly recorded deposits in the western part of the site were examined. They are mixed and are
not judged to be contributing factors to the site=s eligibility status. The contents and depths of any
cultural deposits below 1 meter deep were not examined and are not yet known.
SITE DESCRIPTION
The newly recorded potion of Site 41TV1364 measures about 24 acres (300 meters north
to south and 500 meters east to west). It is made up of the area east of the Polo Field, the Polo
Field, and the Disc Golf Course. It is located south of Baton Springs Road, east of the Loop 1
northbound access road, and north of Columbus Drive. The portion of the new deposits south of
Andrew Zilker Road falls in an upland setting, while the deposits to the north of Andrew Zilker
Road are in a terrace setting.
The western part of Site 41TV1364 contains surficial mixed prehistoric and historic
artifacts and historic features. In the upland portion of the site sparse (1<5 artifacts per square
meter) to dense (30 + artifacts per square meter) mixed artifact scatters were found. In the terrace
locale, prehistoric materials are prevalent on the western end of the expanded area. Moving east
toward the springs; however, historic materials increase and dominate the scatter which
terminates near the Austin Moon light tower. Artifacts are fragmentary. Two twentieth century
native stone features were found: a limestone walkway segment is present in the uplands, and the
transition zone between the uplands and flood plain contains limestone blocks from the Zilker
Stables. The historic features are also fragmentary and are remnants.
ENVIRONMENTAL SETTING
The uplands consist of a rocky limestone hill overlooking a stream terrace of the
Colorado River. Elevations in the uplands range from 530 ft amsl on the south to 520 ft amsl on
the north with a slope of ca. 5 per cent. Vegetation consists of juniper and cedar elm trees with
dense shrub under story, some of which is introduced. At the base of the uplands, from 520 ft
amsl to 517 ft amsl, is a gradual slope where colluvial sediments and alluvial sediments from the
flood plain mix. Oaks are present in this part of the study area which is manicured park land The
flood plain is at elevations 517 ft amsl to 509 ft amsl.
The Tarrant Soil Association covers the project area (Werchan et al. 1974). Tarrant,
Rolling clay, is present in the uplands and Tarrant clay, 0-2 percent slope, in the flood plain. The
upland soils are shallow, rocky, clayey soils over limestone. A profile of the upland clays is 60
percent bedrock ground cover, 0-3 inches of dark brown clay, 3-5 inches of reddish brown clay,
over decomposing limestone. A characteristic profile of flood plain Tarrant clays is 30 percent
bedrock ground cover, 0-5 inches of dark brown clay, 5-8 inches of reddish brown clay, over 812 inches of decomposing limestone.
FEATURES
No prehistoric features or evidence of prehistoric features was found. One twentieth
century feature was found east of the maintenance facility locale out of the APE. The feature is a
short segment of a limestone paver sidewalk located southeast of the proposed foot print (Figure
15). The walkway curves down hill toward Barton Creek. It is reported that walkways such as
these were installed throughout the park by the CCC crews to connect scenic and look out points

(American Statesman July 1, 1934). It is also reported by park personnel to be part of a stable
present from the 1930s to 1940s (?). Preliminary archival research showed that bridle trails and a
stable were present in the western portion of the park and were used by members of the Zilker
Riding Club. Outside the proposed maintenance facility locale foot print to the northwest inside
of the disc golf course is a limestone foundation remnant (Figure 16).

ARTIFACTS
Artifacts and concentrations of artifacts are present on the surface throughout the project
area. Together, shovel testing, back hoe trenching, and surface collecting yielded 101 items for
examination. Of the specimens, 76 are preshitoric (See Table 1) and 25 are historic (See Table 2).
A very small sample (n=6) of mostly historic (n=5) items mixed with a sparse number of
prehistoric (n=1) artifacts was recovered from shovel tests. An equally small sample (n=9) was
recovered by screening a larger volume of back dirt from trenches; however, prehistoric items
(n=6) outnumbered historic items (n=3). To augment sparse subsurface samples, surface samples
were collected.
A controlled artifact sample (n=29) was collected from the surface where the facility will
be built and prehistoric items (n=24) were more frequent than historic items (n=5) almost 5 to 1.
An uncontrolled artifact sample (n=58) from inside and outside the APE was also collected from
the surface and produced prehistoric items (n=46) over historic items (n=12). The location is
deflated and has been surface collected by visitors for many, many decades, skewing any sample
taken today; therefore, the remaining surficial sample is not representative of original deposits.
Despite these facts, the artifacts present provided data about types of activity at the site and the
content and condition of the site=s deposits.

Prehistoric
Concentrations of artifacts were observed on eroded surfaces where the maintenance
facility will be built. The concentrations contain about 30 artifacts per square meter. Prehistoric
items observed included cores, bifaces, unifaces, and lithic debitage at the average rate of ca. 10
specimens per square meter. Prehistoric artifacts from the Late Archaic period and other
unidentified time periods were found in ST#1 and ST#2, BHT#1 and BHT#6, and both surface
collections (Table 1).The prehistoric sample collected includes chipped stone (n=6), flaking
debitage (n=74), and cores (n=2).
Chipped Stone. Chipped stone items number 7 and make up ca. 9 percent of the lithic
collection. The items were categorized and quantified, but not analyzed (Table ). Of the chipped
stone sample of eight specimens, four are biface fragments, one is a complete uniface, and two

Antiquities Planning & Consulting

22

Cultural Resources Survey

are cores. The four fragments include a Middle Archaic (6500-5000 B. P.) period Uvalde base
fragment, a medial dart point fragment, a thin biface fragment, and a biface preform. Two biface
fragments from projectile points were used for hunting and/or as weapons from Archaic times and
later. The uniface was a scraper made from a small cobble with a steep edge for scraping animal
hides or plant material.
The cores recovered number 2 or .03 percent of the lithic collection. Both have had all
cortex removed by hard hammer percussion. One is 5cm in diameter and has been subjected to
substantial reduction. The second is ca. 3 cm in diameter and is exhausted. The cores and
abundant Colorado River gravels are available on-site (See Appendix IV).
Debitage. Debitage includes flakes (n=30) and shatter (n=16) makes up 61 percent of the
collection. Debitage specimens were recovered from one of four shovel tests (ST#2) , four of
six backhoe trenches (BHT#1, BHT#2, BHT# 4, and BHT#5), a 1 meter diameter controlled
surface collection, and a random surface collection. A very small number (n= 6) of the prehistoric
lithic specimens were recovered from ST#2 ( n=1), BHT#1 ( n=2) , BHT #4 (n=1), and BHT#5
(n=2), while the controlled 1 meter diameter surface collection (n=20) and a random surface
collection (n=10) together yielded 30 specimens.
Examination of debitage was limited to analysis of four flake attributes including type,
size, amount of cortex, and edge wear. Flake type (Whole, Proximal, or Distal Fragments) was
looked at to determine the condition and research potential of the sample. Flake size and amount
of cortex were measured to identify levels of reduction. Distal and lateral flake edges were
examined to quantify percentage of utilization of expedient tools. The lithic debitage sample
analyzed (n=69) was collected from subsurface (n=6) and surface deposits (n=63) and consisted
of whole flakes, flake fragments, and shatter (See Appendix V).
Whole flakes (n= 34) make up ca. 49 percent of the sample analyzed. Flake fragments
(n=18) are 26 per cent of the sample. Shatter (n=17) is about 25 percent of the collection. A total
of 63 or about 91 percent of the debitage is made up of small flakes, 1-4 cm (100-400 mm) in
length of which 30 are whole flakes, 18 are fragments, and 13 are comprised of shatter. Medium
sized debitage,(4.1-10cm or 400-1000 mm) in length number 6, pieces of which 3 are whole
flakes and 3 are shatter. No debitage over 5 cm in length was found indicating, lithic reduction in
this part of the site, is late stage.
Tertiary level of cortex reduction is present on 42 specimens or ca. 61 percent, followed
by 19 (ca. 28 percent) secondary, and 7 or 10 percent exhibit primary level reduction. The
majority of the flakes possess edge wear. Utilized whole flakes number 29 or ca. 42 percent of the
sample. Utilized flake fragments (n=6) and shatter (n=4) number 10 or 14 percent of the sample
examined. Of the utilized flakes, fragments, and shatter, 15 or 22 percent of the debitage found
exhibited multiple edge use wear.
The debitage sample analyzed provided limited new data about area chronology,
prehistoric activity, lithic procurement, and tool manufacture and use in the western part of
41TV1364. Most frequent in number in the collection are whole flakes, 1-4 cm long, tertiary in
reduction level, and utilized on one lateral or distal edge. The small flakes are the result of late
stage tool manufacture, sharpening, and resharpening.
The small flakes and flake fragments were also used as discardable tools of expediency
probably for cutting. The presence of flake fragments in fewer numbers than whole flakes
indicates that the condition of the artifacts buried and on the surface is good and although they

may not be in good context , the artifacts are generally whole. Raw material was available locally
and on site and consisted of Colorado River cobbles and gravels of fine- and coarse grained chert
and, quartzite of a variety of colors. Imported materials were not noted in this sample.
Historic
The concentration observed in the uplands included historic material such as plastic
screw caps, aluminum ring tabs and tin pull tabs; brown, green, and clear bottle glass; wire nails
and metal fragments, white ware ceramics and decal ware ceramics Historic artifacts (n=22) from
the 1890s to ca. the 1970s were recovered from ST#3, BHT#5 and BHT#6, the controlled surface
collection, and the random surface collection (Table 2). A very small number (n= 4) of the
historic specimens were recovered from subsurface examination and screening.
The controlled 1 meter diameter surface collection yielded a sparse number of items as
well (n=5). A random surface collection from the Polo Field and the historic artifact
concentration contained a slightly larger number (n=12). Historic items were identified,
described, and categorized. Of the 25 specimens examined, the sample is made up of glass
(n=12), metal (n=4), ceramic (n=7), and plastic (n=2) items were recovered. Most items are
residential in nature, followed by recreational.
RESEARCH VALUE
The research value of the new archeological deposits at Site 41TV1364 are high related
to potentially buried prehistoric components below 1 meter in depth. In addition, the research
value related to historic archeological components may also high. Of great interest to historians
is the CCC camp and its involvement at Zilker Park. Historic components and past structure
locations merit more archival and historical research. Historic features are present outside the
APE that do have research value related to 1934 CCC improvements. Historic components are of
interest and historic artifact concentrations can shed light on the location of the CCC camp and
The Texas Reptile Institute. Related to historic features and those possibly constructed by the
CCC, the research value of the limestone paver sidewalk in the uplands is medium. Foot paths,
abandoned road beds, concrete pic-nic tables are present in the uplands.
The research value of the upland portion of the site where the maintenance facility, the
water line, and the access road are planned; is very low related to intact prehistoric and historic
components. The deposits are surficial and mixed with modern refuse and are not associated with
features or intact diagnostic artifacts. Upland sediments are deflated and formed on Pleistocene
surfaces and are shallow (< 40 cm deep) reddish-brown silty clay over a cobble rock layer.
Upland deposits are disturbed by historic activity and park development, deflation, and intensive
recreational use.
The wastewater line will cross a low lying area below the uplands where recent, colluvial
and terrace deposits mix. It then continues north into a flood plain setting where ancient stream
terraces are present. The research value of the upper strata (<1 meter deep) portion of the site
examined in the part of the park where the wastewater line is planned is low. The storm water
catchment route is also low-lying. It follows a natural runoff channel that may be a relict ancient
channel feeding the Eanes Creek drainage. The catchment area will remain in its current natural
state and no excavation is planned inside the route.
Recent to Late Holocene sediments examined in upper strata (ca. 1 meter deep) are
brown silty clay over reddish-brown silty clay over cobble rock layers and/or limestone bedrock.
Surficial deposits are disturbed by deflation, intensive recreational use, and the previous
installation of underground utilities. Geoarcheological/geomorphic research value of lower

Antiquities Planning & Consulting

24

Cultural Resources Survey

COA Zilker Maintenance Facility

terrace strata is not yet known and could be high related to any deeply buried, stratified,
archeological deposits present 6-15 feet deep.
SIGNIFICANCE
The new portion of the site where the maintenance facility will be built does not contain
significant upper deposits (<1 meter) that are contributing factors to Site 41TV1364 eligibility.
The portions of the site where the wastewater line will be installed are eroding and disturbed by a
previously installed wastewater line, disc golf course features, and high volume pedestrian traffic.
The prehistoric deposits above 1 meter are not eligible, while the eligibility status of deposits 1
meter or more is not yet known. Historic features and components are fragmentary and have poor
integrity.
RECOMMENDATIONS
Related to construction of the maintenance facility, the wastewater line, access road, and
storm water catchment, no further work is needed. If in the future, any development is planned by
the COA that exceeds 1 meter in depth in the western part of 41TV1364 limits, the COA should
notify the THC and request a project review. In the future, additional scientific research in this
part Site 41TV1364 should address the content, extent, and integrity of any buried prehistoric
deposits in the terrace. Further archival and historical work is warranted to identify historic
components, including the location of the CCC camp, the Texas Reptile Institute, and other late
nineteenth or early twentieth century structure locations.
DISCUSSION
The proposed new Zilker Park Maintenance Facility will not affect any eligible or
potential eligible deposits at Site 41TV1364. Shovel testing and controlled surface collection
revealed that upland soils are made up of shallow compressed colluvial sediments with
temporally mixed material.The uplands contain compressed archeological deposits of low
research value and are not contributing factors to the site=s eligibility status. In addition,
archeological deposits in the upper strata of the stream terrace are sparse, mixed, and have low
research value. Mechanical survey showed that upper deposits (0-36 inches) in the proposed
wastewater line easement are sparse, absent of intact features, and temporally mixed. Similar
finds can be inferred for the storm water catchment locale The stream terrace, however; has the
potential to contain buried archeological deposits. Late Holocene sediments are present in excess
of 1 meter deep. However, the planned wastewater line will be installed no more than 3 feet deep
and will not affect lower strata.
The single diagnostic prehistoric artifact found in the controlled surface collection, a
Middle Archaic Uvalde basal fragment, provides a relative time period affiliation and an
indication of how heavily the surface has been collected for whole artifacts. The prehistoric
artifact sample recovered and analyzed does not tell much of a detailed story about prehistoric
lithic technology practices carried out at the site. The assemblage does provide clues to activity
in the western part of the site. It was not a lithic procurement area, but it was a late stage lithic
reduction loci where tool reuse and resharpening occurred. The upland artifacts examined show
the locale was a temporary activity area in prehistoric and historic times. The artifacts analyzed
from the terrace tell a similar story, evidence of temporary activity was found in the upper strata
investigated and on the ground surface. Raw material was available on site and was Colorado
River gravels of fine- and coarse grained chert and, quartzite of a variety of colors.

Historic items observed and recovered in the uplands were also non diagnostic and
twentieth century in age. Flood plain artifacts from the historic period were sparse inside the
wastewater line easement and were mixed with modern refuse. The scatter of historic artifacts
increases considerably east of the Polo Field, where a concentration of late nineteenth and early
twentieth century specimens are present.
Although, not a part of the survey Scope Of Work, preliminary statements can be made
about the geomorphic setting of the western part of 41TV1364 located in the Polo Field and the
Disc Golf Course. Both fluvial and colluvial processes have occurred in the terrace. Colorado
River back water flooding has created an extension of the stream terrace that has built up between
two upland limestone outcrops. When the area was an active flood plain a tributary down cut the
terrace at the base of the upland slope on the south side of the terrace and it was later filled in by
erosion, colluvial, and likely fluvial processes.
In sum, the survey provided important new data related to Zilker Park prehistory and
history. The boundaries of Site 41TV1364 were expanded. Historic components were also added,
including the location of stables and possibly, the reptile house and/or the CCC camp. In the new
areas of the site, only the surface and the upper 1 meter of cultural strata in Recent and Late
Holocene sediments were examined and evaluated for significance and were found to have low
research value and to be non-contributing factors to the site=s eligibility. The content and the
extent of deposits below one meter are not yet known.

6.0 CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS
CONCLUSIONS
The cultural resources survey showed that construction of the proposed Zilker Park
Maintenance Facility will not affect significant cultural deposits, despite the fact that the
proposed new maintenance facility is inside Site 41TV1364, a major component of the Barton
Springs Archeological and Historical District. The Zilker survey contributed important new data
about the cultural history of Zilker Park. Survey results showed that the Vera Daniel Site,
41TV1364, is larger than previously known.
Shovel testing and back hoe trenching demonstrated that the upper 36 inches of
archeological deposits in the western portion of Site 41TV1364 are not to be contributing factors
to site=s eligibility status. Geotechnical boring revealed that Late Holocene stream terrace
sediments present are about 1- 3.5 ft to 12 feet deep, however; terrace deposits will not be
impacted below 3 feet deep. APC concludes, therefore, that no significant or potentially eligible
components of Site 41TV1364 will be affected by the construction of the proposed maintenance
facility and its underground utilities, as planned.
The Zilker Park locale is a very unique ecotone and a location that has played a
significant part in many aspects of Central Texas life from prehistoric times to the present. The
locale has been occupied by the area=s earliest prehistoric inhabitants and historic settlers and the
site of human activity for at least 11,000 years before the present. Evidence of this activity has
been preserved by rapidly deposited river and creek sediments creating a pristine archeological
setting for the study of ancient culture in Central Texas. Today, Zilker park continues to be a
beloved Central Texas and a City of Austin treasure and its visitors continue to leave behind
traces of their time spent along the banks of the Colorado River and at Barton Springs.
RECOMMENDATIONS
APC recommends that construction of the new Zilker Park Maintenance Facility and
ancillary features proceed with no additional archeological investigation. If design changes
should occur inside the Site limits, the areas should be inspected by archeologists, before any
construction begins. Lastly, if unexpected archeological or historical features are uncovered
during construction, digging should stop at the location. The THC, Archeology Division, should
be notified by telephone at (512) 463-6096. Digging at the location of the find should not resume
until the find is inspected and evaluated by an archeologist in consultation with the THC.
