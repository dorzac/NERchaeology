13. ABSTRACT (Maximum 200 words)

A cultural resource survey of less than one acre of agricultural field adjacent to the north bank of Old Ten Mile Creek in northeast Ellis County was conducted prior to the
repair of 500 feet of flood-damaged levee maintained by the Ellis County Levee Improvement District No. 3 along Red Oak Creek. The field investigation consisted of a
pedestrian survey of the ground surface in the vicinity of the new proposed borrow pit extension as well as the excavation of 2 trenches within a 10-ft wide area that
extended 50 m along the existing borrow pit edge. Backhoe trenches 1 and 2 spanned 68% of the total length that will be impacted by borrow activities. Based on trench
observations and background research the proposed borrow area is highly unlikely to contain archeological historic properties (36 CFR800.16: [I]) or State Archeological
Landmarks (13 TAC 26.12) and no further archeological investigations are recommended for these areas

CULTURAL RESOURCES SURVEY OF ELLIS COUNTY
LEVEE REPAIR BORROW AREA,
ELLIS COUNTY, TEXAS
The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) proposes to repair 500 feet of flood-damaged levee
maintained by the Ellis County Levee Improvement District No. 3 along Red Oak Creek. The
current project involved the cultural resource survey of less than one acre of agricultural field
adjacent to the north bank of Old Ten Mile Creek in northeast Ellis County (Figure 1). GeoMarine, Inc. (GMI), was contracted by USACE, Fort Worth District, under Contract # W9126G05-009 to conduct these investigations. This work was performed on November 2, 2007 under
the authority of Section 106 of the National Historic Preservation Act as amended. Tiffany
Osburn of GMI served as Project Archeologist and meets the Secretary of Interiorâs Professional
Qualification standards.
The objectives were to locate, identify, and describe all cultural resources that can reasonably be
detected from an inspection of the ground surface, and through backhoe trenching, in previously
undisturbed portions of the borrow areas along Old Ten Mile creek. The project area is located
on private land and will consist of the removal of sediment from the northeastern edge of an
existing borrow pit at the edge of a large agricultural field (Figure 2).
A records search was conducted prior to entering the field. This included a search of the National
Register of Historic Places (NRHP), as well as the Texas Archeological Sites Atlas, and Historic
sites Atlas, maintained by the Texas Historical Commission and TARL. No sites that are listed
on the NRHP, archeological sites or recorded historic sites are located within a mile of the project
area.
The field investigation consisted of a pedestrian survey of the ground surface in the vicinity of the
new proposed borrow pit extension as well as the excavation of 2 trenches within a 10-ft wide
area that extended 50 m along the existing borrow pit edge. Backhoe trenches were excavated in
accordance with the Texas Historical Commissionâs Archeological Survey Standards.
Backhoe trench 1 was 22 m long and was excavated to a maximum depth of 270 cm bs. This
trench extended along the proposed borrow area from the western end of the existing borrow pit
toward the east. A typical profile and description of the sediments observed in this trench are
presented in Figure 3. Although a buried soil was identified (Zone IV), no cultural materials were
identified during careful trench scraping and observation.
Backhoe trench 2 was 12 meters long and was excavated to a maximum depth of 265 cm bs. This
trench was excavated along the proposed borrow area east of Backhoe trench 1. Sediments
observed in this trench mirrored those observed Backhoe trench 1 and depicted in Figure 3. The
same buried soil was observed in Zone IV, however, no cultural materials were associated with
this surface.
The excavation of Backhoe trenches 1 and 2 spanned 68% of the total length that will be
impacted by borrow activities. Based on trench observations and background research the
proposed borrow area is highly unlikely to contain archeological historic properties (36
CFR800.16: [I]) or State Archeological Landmarks (13 TAC 26.12) and no further archeological
investigations are recommended for these areas.
