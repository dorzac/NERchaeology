INTRODUCTION

As contracted through the Texas Army National Guard
(TXARNG), in August 2000 personnel from the Texas Archaeological Research Laboratory (TARL) conducted an
intensive pedestrian cultural resources survey of the Texas
National Guard Eagle Mountain Lake Training Site (EML),
located in northwest Tarrant County, Texas (Figure 1).
The project area is currently owned by the Texas Military Facilities Commission, but is used primarily by the Texas
Engineering Extension Service (TEEX), a program of the
Texas A&M University System. TEEX is a school program
for the training of heavy machinery operators in the use of
backhoes, graders, and other types of large earth moving
equipment. The TXARNG conducts occasional training at
the site and the area is also leased for cattle grazing.
While researching the background history of Eagle
Mountain Lake and the surrounding communities, multiple
and disparate views of the landscape and its use in the past
were revealed. Everything from the mundane to the bizarre
was uncovered; from concrete foundations to the grave of
the celebrated Texas singer/songwriter Townes Van Zandt
(located a scant 1 and 1/2 miles away from the facility).
From whiteware sherds to the account of an alien space-

craft crashing within the bounds of the base or its immediate vicinity in 1897. Where extant historical documentation
would permit, a detailed history of the first settlement of
the Eagle Mountain Lake property was created. In particular, the history of the Jeffersons, the first known Anglo family to reside within the confines of the base property, is
chronicled. This history was both spurred and aided by the
presence of the Jefferson Family Cemetery in the southern
portion of the base, containing the mortal remains of at least
five individuals. Historic period land use is also reviewed,
revealing that most of the acreage within the present EML
training site was used in the past primarily as grazing lands
for horses, cattle, and sheep.
The creation of the Eagle Mountain Lake Base itself,
as a Marine Corps glider training facility during the early
years of World War II, is presented in great detail. Additionally, the transformation of the W.W.11 base to a Cold
War auxiliary field and training facility is documented. In a
sense, of course, there are multiple histories, and multiple
points of view. As many as possible were given a voice
within this report, though each history presented is far from
exhaustive.

PREVIOUS INVESTIGATIONS AND RESEARCH DESIGN

The first of these investigations, by the environmental contract firm of SWCA, Inc., consisted of an intensive pedestrian survey (with shovel testing) conducted over a 270 acre
tract of land just to the north and west of Eagle Mountain
Lake training site, in neighboring Wise County. Although
93 shovel tests were implemented over 270 acres, none were
positive for cultural materials. In sum, not a single prehistoric artifact was observed during the entire SWCA survey
(Barile 2000).
The second archaeological survey covers much less
ground, but is located a scant two miles due south of the
EML training site. AR Consultants, an environmental firm,
investigated a tiny 20 square foot tract of land, placing only
two shovel tests into the property. Both were negative for
cultural materials, and no other prehistoric artifacts were
observed (Skinner 1997).
The complete lack of recovery of evidence for prehistoric occupations within the project area may be explained
by the nature of the landscape in prehistoric times. It is important to understand that the modem day environmental characteristics of the region in many ways bear little resemblance
to early historic or more importantly, prehistoric conditions.
Prior to 1934, the largest and most permanent water source
in the area was the West Fork of the Trinity River, which
once flowed approximately two to three miles to the west of
the Eagle Mountain Lake training site. Prehistoric peoples in
the region would likely have camped along the West Fork,
and generally avoided the more impermanent drainages in the
upland areas that fed into this larger water source. Between
1930 and 1934 the West Fork of the Trinity was impounded
by the county government to provide a constant water supply to feed the needs of Fort Worth, flooding the shallow
river valley of the West Fork, and inundating its former banks
that likely held material evidence of prehistoric occupation.
On average, this reservoir covers 9,200 acres in area (Breeding 1999).

GENERAL SETTING

The Eagle Mountain Lake National Guard training site is located in north-central Texas in the northwest
corner of Tarrant County. The training site and project area
are in the drainage of the West Fork of the Trinity River in
the Cross Timbers physiographic region of Texas. The Cross
Timbers consist of north-south trending bands of prairies
and oak woodlands that are bordered to the northwest by
the Grand Prairie and on the east by the Blackland Prairie.
PREVIOUS ARCHEOLOGICAL
INVESTIGATIONS

Binford (1982:9-11) has discussed a theoretical 20 kilometer economic zonation (foraging area) around huntergatherer sites. Twelve prehistoric sites have been recorded
within 20 kilometers of the Eagle Mountain Lake Training
Site (see Figure 2), suggesting that the prehistoric landscape
at the training site could have been exploited from some I
all of these 12 sites. Time diagnostic artifacts from these
sites cover the Late Pleistocene and Holocene time periods.
Two of the sites have time diagnostic artifacts from the
Paleoindian period (41PR26/Plainview and 41TR149/
Golondrina). One site (41 WS47) has time diagnostics from
the Early Archaic, two sites (41WS47 and 41TR149) have
time diagnostics from the Middle and Late Archaic, and
five sites (41WS46, 41WS47, 41TR114, 41TR124, and
41TR155) have time diagnostics from the Late Prehistoric.
Seven of the 12 sites contain freshwater mussel shell and
41 TR132 is described as a shell lens, suggesting that riverine resources found in the Trinity River drainage were exploited at these sites.
Of the two most recent archaeological investigations
in the immediate vicinity of Eagle Mountain Lake, both
failed to recover any indication of prehistoric occupation.

RESEARCHDF.SIGN
As has been previously pointed out "compared to
other regions of Texas, north-central Texas has been the
focus of relatively little archeological research to date"
(Brownlow et al 1999:9). As this is the case virtually any
prehistoric deposit with reasonable integrity could provide important information necessary to refine the poorly
documented regional culture history. Moreover, beyond
this basic research theme, contributions to more broadbased, cultural understandings of subsistence, settlement
patterns, environmental interaction and social organization in the prehistoric period of the area are virtually wideopen.
All this is further underscored by the fact that no previous archeological investigations have been undertaken
within the 1250-acre tract that constitutes the project area

and the few investigations that have been conducted within
the immediate vicinity have discovered no potentially eligible cultural resources.
Any cultural resources located during this project will
be assessed by their ability to answer broad research questions such as:
Does this site have the potential to increase our understanding of local chronology and/or general lifeways
(subsistence, etc.) of a particular underrepresented chronological period (e.g., paleoindian, early archaic, etc.)?
Do the resources recorded during the survey add to our
understanding of increase and/or decline of area utilization through time?
Do the cultural resources encountered within the project
area have the potential to shed light on resource strategy changes, such as a shift in raw material type for
lithic manufacture?

America Goes to War: The Archeology of the Eagle

If little is known about the prehistory of north-central
Texas the same may be said for any archeological understanding of the historic period of the region. Although innovative works have looked at historic lifeways in large
spatial areas, such as Richland Creek (e.g., Moir and Jurney
1987), little follow-up work has been done to flesh out our
understand of more than the most particular of historical
sites.
Although there was certainly an effort to settle the northcentral Texas area by the 1830s, Tarrant County was not
carved out of Navarro County until 1849. Even given this
date the pertinent portion of the northwest comer of Tarrant
County does not appear to become largely settled until the
mid 1860s (see Chapter 5).
With this in mind several research themes central to
this project become evident. 1) when did settlers first enter
the vicinity of what is now known as Eagle Mountain Lake?;
2) how did they utilize the existing landscape, or alter that
landscape to better suit their needs?
Nineteenth and early twentieth-century sites discovered
during the course of this survey will be evaluated by their
ability to address these questions as well as their ability to
help us understand:
Do historical resources within the project area have the
potential to help us understand general patterning and
variability in rural historical settlement patterns in northcentral Texas?
Do the historical cultural resources encountered during the survey help us understand economic, sociocultural, race or ethnic variables at work within the groups
which settled the region during the nineteenth and early
twentieth centuries?
What can these resources tell us about general historical adaptations to north-central Texas? How were nonnative economies and life ways changes and modified
to work within the environmental and social frame of
north-central Texas? For example what farmstead landscapes are employed and what do they say about gender and social organization? Do these landscapes
change through time and, if so, in response to what?
(see Beedle and Gyrisco 1996).

A growing number of mid-twentieth century cultural
resources are being considered eligible for inclusion on
the National Register of Historic Places across America.
Fifty years is obviously "not the only length of time that
defines 'historic' or makes informed, dispassionate judgment possible" and World War II era and cold war sites
are increasingly being seen as an important part of our
cultural landscapes which need to be, in some cases, preserved (Sherfy and Luce 1996: 3-5; Slaton and Shiffer
1995).
As the Second World War was a decisive turning point
in the historical trajectory of American culture, resources
such as wartime-constructed military bases are quite frequently included under this rubric (Albrecht 1995; Sherfy
and Luce 1996). However, historic context and integrity
become all the more important in assessing the eligibility
of cultural resources belonging to the recent past. With this
in mind we will examine some of the important questions
we will be asking of the remains of the various military
operations that have called the Eagle Mountain Lake facility home.
First, it is clear that this cultural occupation (that is, the
Eagle Mountain Lake military facility constructed in 1942),
must be considered as a whole (see Seifert 1995:36-41).
Furthermore, in order to assess the eligibility to the training
site as whole we will be asking the following questions about
the resources encountered.
What are the number, kinds of above-ground resources
contributing to the potential eligibility of the EML training site occupation?
â¢ To what extent is the cultural landscape of EML training site intact and interpretable? How can these resources help us understand the functionality, power
relations and general worldview present in daily lived
experience in the period?
What are the quality and integrity of subsurface archeological deposits associated with the EML training site
and do they have the potential to add to our understanding of consumer behavior, gender roles, etc. at work
(and changing) during the middle portion of the twentieth century.

SURVEY METHODOLOGY

continuously since 1982. These training activities have effectively disturbed approximately 40 percent (or 500 acres)
of the property, at times up to tens of meters in depth.
Since these disturbed areas have been constantly recontoured and landscaped, many were not immediately obvious. Therefore, it was necessary for the on site director of
TEEX, Mr. Mike Griffith, to help us delineate and map these
disturbances. According to Mr. Griffith, some of the disturbed areas covered several football fields in area and were
up to 100 feet deep. Due to the extremely disturbed nature
of much of the project area, shovel testing was limited only
to the undisturbed (or least disturbed) portions (Figure 3).
Unfortunately, many of the disturbed areas would, under
ideal circumstances, have once been considered of highest
probability for prehistoric occupation; most notably portions
of the terraces present along the two drainages (Moss Branch
and Indian Creek).
The third category of acreage at the Eagle Mountain
Lake training site were areas possessing sufficient sediments
that also were ''intact" or at least minimally disturbed by
heavy earth moving activities. This category includes the
southern and southeastern portions of the Eagle Mountain
Lake facility. Shovel testing was conducted in all intact (or
minimally disturbed) areas of the Eagle Mountain Lake training site, except for two areas in the southeastern portion of
the project area where backhoe trenching was accomplished.
However, it should be emphasized that the areas where
shovel testing occurred were not necessarily the ones with
the highest probabilities for prehistoric sites. Rather, these
areas are those that remained most intact, regardless of the
estimated potential for prehistoric deposits.
Shovel tests were implemented within three discrete
survey areas where relatively undisturbed landforms made
them feasible: 1. the West Oak Motte; 2. the East Oak Motte;
and 3. the wooded area along Indian Creek and the southern
boundary of the survey area (Figure 3). Shovel testing protocols as defined by current CTA standards were followed.
Thirty meter intervals were maintained between individual

The field portion of the investigation began on August
7, 2000, and was completed on August 15, 2000. Additional
geomorphological assessments were made in November
2000. As stipulated by contract, an intensive pedestrian survey was conducted using a four person crew maintaining a
transect interval between crew members of no greater than
30 meters at all times. The entire 1250-acre facility was
walked, and systematic shovel testing was conducted (every 30 meters) wherever feasible.
CHARACTERISTICS OF SURVEY AREA
For the purposes of a cultural resources assessment,
the 1250 acres that comprise the Eagle Mountain Lake facility can be broken down into three broad categories, dependent upon either natural or cultural characteristics (see
Figure 3).
First, the northern portion of the project area is composed of exposed limestone bedrock or extremely shallow
sediments (averaging only bet ween 7 and 17 inches in depth)
overlying fractured bedrock (Figure 3). This area constitutes approximately 40 percent (or circa 500 acres) of the
current training site. Shovel testing was not accomplished
within this portion of the project area due to the thin/nonexistent nature of the soil layer, but it was traversed in its
entirety with standard transects (at 30 meter intervals).
The second category of acreage at the Eagle Mountain
Lake facility consists of extremely disturbed soils. Historically, the earliest known disturbances were two large gravel
pits (ranging up to 100 feet in depth) located in the middle
and southern portions of the training site. The southernmost gravel pit is demarcated on the 1951 Marine Air Station base map (see Figure 9), and both pits are present on
the 1955 Avondale quadrangle map.
In recent years these gravel pits have been in-filled by
the Texas Engineering Extension Service (TEEX) heavy
earth moving training courses. TEEX has been using the
property to train individuals in heavy equipment operation

surveyors, and a shovel test was placed every thirty meters
along each transect. All sediments were screened through
1/4 inch mesh.
Shovel tests were attempted but not systematically
performed in either of the "pastures" located in the southeastern portion of the survey area, due to the unyielding
nature of the surface matrix; an extremely hard sun baked
clay, and the depth of the Holocene sediments (more than
2.5 meters). However, both areas had been subjected to
recent plowing, and surface visibility was fair to excellent. Additionally, a total of7 backhoe trenches were placed
within these pastures to explore the possibility of buried
cultural deposits.
In all, a total of 332 shovel tests were performed during the course of the pedestrian survey at EML. All shovel
tests were negative for cultural material. Further, no prehistoric artifacts or other indications of prehistoric occupations
were observed during the course of the pedestrian survey.
Field conditions were extreme. No precipitation fell in
Tarrant County during the month of August, and under cloudless skies, temperatures soared as high as 107 degrees in the
afternoons. Because of these conditions the two major drainages on the property, Indian Creek and Moss Branch (which
form the southern and eastern boundaries of the survey area,
respectively), were reduced to small, isolated pools of water. These conditions allowed easy access to the cut banks
of both drainages. The survey crew walked the essentially
dry riverbeds and at every opportunity used shovels to cut
back the banks and expose profiles (at times 4 to 5 meters
in height), in search of buried soils or cultural deposits.
No prehistoric sites, isolated artifacts, or even lithic raw
materials were encountered during the pedestrian survey or
within the 7 backhoe trenches. A total of 5 pre-World War II
historic sites or localities were recorded in the field, though
only two of these were deemed intact enough to necessitate
a formal site trinomial assignment (41TR182 and 41TR183).
Finally, 8 World War II or later architectural features were
recorded. None of these more recent features were given
formal site status.

CHAPTER4

GEOMORPHOLOGICAL ASSESSMENT OF EAGLE MOUNTAIN LAKE

The first phase of the geomorphological assessment of
the Eagle Mountain Lake training site occurred while the
pedestrian survey was ongoing in August. After assessing
these results, it was believed that additional data, in the form
of more extensive back hoe trenching, was necessary to
better understand the nature of the terrace deposits and to
determine their potential to contain buried cultural deposits. In all, 7 backhoe trenches were excavated with the generous assistance of TEEX personnel (Figure 3). The first
two trenches (No.' s 1 and 2) were excavated in August 2000.
The remaining trenches (numbered consecutively as 3
through 7) were placed in the terrace deposits of Indian
Creek in November 2000.
In reference to the Tarrant County Soil Survey (Ressel
1981 ), there are a myriad of soil types that make up the
Eagle Mountain Lake training site. Many of these types,
however, share certain characteristics. Typically, sediments
are composed of clay loam to pure clay within the terraces
adjacent to the two major drainages on the property (e.g.,
Frio Silty Clay; Ressel 1981).
The upland portion of the Eagle Mountain Lake National Guard training site tract appears to be essentially outcrops of bedrock formations, as in'dicated on the Dallas sheet
of the Geologic Atlas of Texas (Bureau of Economic Geology 1972), but there is minor soil development on the bedrock and one can presume locally there are thin colluvial
deposits. Within the survey area, there are no bedded cherts
or other lithic raw materials suitable for the manufacture of
stone tools. Further, only the southeastern portion of the
tract - along Indian Creek - contains geological deposits
that have a significant chance of containing widespread
buried prehistoric cultural remains. This area is shown on
the Dallas Sheet as Qt, Quaternary Fluviatile Terrace Deposits. Typically, Qt represents Pleistocene sediment that

predates human occupation, but the age of units like the
one in the project area is usually poorly constrained. One
cannot assume, therefore, that the Qt at Eagle Mountain Lake
does not include Holocene fluvial sediments in which prehistoric material is encased.
Broad fluvial terraces ("Terraces") are developed
along the eastern side of Indian Creek in the southeastern
portion of the Eagle Mountain Lake property. They are
now agricultural fields referred to informally as the "pastures." Narrow terraces of comparable elevation also occur west of the Creek opposite these fields, and upstream
of them for at least several hundred meters. Indian Creek,
and its tributary Moss Branch, are entrenched into the deposits of the terraces (called the "Terrace Deposits" here)
to a depth of over 4m. These terrace deposits are composed primarily of loamy clay to almost pure clay, which
also crop out along the drainages and extend a short distance west of Indian Creek before pinching out against
bedrock. Where exposed along Indian Creek these deposits are 2 to 5 meters thick, and locally can be seen to rest
on bedrock.
The cut banks of the entrenched drainages on the property, Indian Creek and Moss Branch, were examined through
their entire lengths. Where appropriate, these banks were
cut back with shovels to obtain a clear profile (Figure 4).
Although what appeared to be buried "A horizons" and dark
staining were occasionally observed at depths as great as 3
meters below the present ground surface, no associated cultural materials were observed.
Seven backhoe trenches were placed on the Eagle
Mountain Lake Training Site property. These backhoe
trenches were situated to reveal the stratigraphy of the terrace deposits and to further assess their potential for buried
cultural deposits.

tural materials could have been established if bedrock had
been very shallow under the terrace. With the over three
meters of almost pure clay deposits within BHTl , however,
there remained the potential for buried archaeological remains. The fine-grain nature of the sections indicates that it
formed as overbank flood sediments, thus on a flood plain
that could have been occupied periodically by people. Additionally, the modest extent of soil development suggests
a latest Pleistocene/Holocene age, thus of potential cultural
significance.
BACKHOE TRENCH NO. 2 (BHT2)

FIGURE

4. Moss Branch Drainage Cut Bank.

BACKHOE TRENCH NO. 1 (BHTl)

BHTI was placed in the middle of the northern pasture,
which is clearly formed on a fluvial terrace feature. The pasture has a clayey soil, cracked by dry conditions. At some
time in the past the pasture was subject to flooding from Indian Creek and Moss Branch. Considering the pasture stands
>3m above the creek bottom now, it is unlikely if the pasture
has flooded recently. However, entrenchment of the creek
could have been active in historic times, so current circumstances certainly does not preclude the possibility of flooding in prehistoric times, even late prehistoric times.
BHTl was dug to a depth of 3.1m. It was anticipated
that gravel s would be found within the lower 1m of the
trench because of the presence of such materials in the Indian Creek bank 100 +1-m away. No gravels were found,
however, the whole section being clay. It is natural to assume (i.e., simplest explanation) that the Indian Creek bank
section is the same age as the one in the adjacent field , but
at the point where BHTl was dug, the section could be far
older_a Pleistocene deposit into which the creek incised and
then backfilled. Little potential for significant buried cul-

BHT2 was located in the upper portion of the west bank
of Indian Creek, several hundred meters upstream from the
northern pasture. Specifically, the site was chosen because
of the almost Sm of terrace deposits exposed in a -50m
long stream bank outcrop there (and the trencher could get
to the site) (see Figure 5). The lower -3m is light-colored
limestone gravel (comprised mostly of pebbles and small
cobbles) typical of the deposits along the Creek, and the
upper -2m in darker colored, clay sediment with sand/gravel
lenses, again typical of what occurs at the top of the section
along the creek.
A single, isolated bivalve shell was recovered from
BHT2. The shell was about 8 cm long and found at l .2m
below the ground surface. Although not associated with artifacts, it was initially believed to have the potential to be a
cultural item. Consequently, it was sampled as BHT2-la,
and its matrix was sampled as -1 b. However, later back hoe
trenching activities exposed several shells of this variety,
and it is believed that they are fossil bivalves scoured from
the limestone bedrock of Moss Branch (where they commonly occur) and re-deposited within the clay during episodic flood episodes.
In November 2000, an additional five backhoe trenches
were dug into the terrace surface of the pastures located
within the southeastern portion of the project area, along
the eastern banks oflndian Creek and Moss Branch. BHT 1,
dug in August, was placed near the center of the northern
pasture, and it was originally intended to site the new backhoe trenches near BHTl. However, upon our return in November, we found that the pastures were planted, thus preventing us from crossing them freely . We therefore positioned the new trenches at the perimeter of the planted areas, some distance away from BHTl.
The southern boundary of the north pasture is formed
by a grouping of trees lining a small drainage. BHT3-5 were

hoe trenches contained any artifacts or recognizable archaeological features.
BACKHOE TRENCH NO. 3 (BHT3)

BHT3 was actually notched into the bank of Indian
Creek (much as was BHT2). and was dug to a depth of2.3m.
The creek bank here exposes 3.6m of flu vial sediments with
a weak soil developed on them. The upper -2m is a finegrained sandstone, the underlying - I .6m is composed of a
pebble to small cobble size gravel bed, and the two units
grade into one another over a thickness of -0.3m. The A

horizon is - Im thick, and the B horizon has virtually no
discernible structure but does contain disseminated CaC03
filaments in the upper -0.5m.
While BHT3 was being excavated, the narrow terrace
west of (i.e., across the creek bed from) BHT3 was examined upstream for several hundred meters. The top of the
Terrace along the eastern bank of Indian Creek is about Im
higher than it is farther west, an indication that the upper
portion of the Terrace Deposits here were formed by
overbank deposition that created a levee near Indian Creek.
This depositional scenario is consistent with the fine-grained
nature of the upper portion of the alluvial sedimentary rock

exposed in the creek bank. BHT3 did not reveal any indications of prehistoric human activities of any kind.
BACKHOE TRENCH NO. 4 (BHT4)
BHT4 was located approximately 75m east of BHT3
and the Indian Creek bank; the ground elevation is about
-0.Sm higher at BHT4 than at BHT3. BHT4 has a geomorphic position similar to BHTl. BHT4 was dug to a depth of
1.7m. Although containing some pebble-sized clasts, especially below Im, the material exposed is fine-grained sandy
loam. The pebbly-sized clasts include some shells. An A
horizon of -0.6m thickness overlies a weakly developed B.
BACKHOE TRENCH NO. 5 (BUTS)
BHTS was dug to a depth of 2m, and exposed what is
likely a typical sequence under the pastures-a thick but
weakly developed soil formed on fine-grained, mostly
muddy sediments which contain higher amounts of sand
and gravel below about a meter. BHT5 is - lOOm east of
and >0.Sm higher than BHT4. The upper -0.5m in the BHT
is an A horizon with a vaguely recognizable plow zone; the
horizon is dark gray (7.5YR3/l) loam that is soft when dry
and, when wet, moderately plastic. The A horizon grades
into a B horizon over -0.3m. The B horizon, which is> I .Sm
thick, is a brown (7.5YR4/2), structureless, slightly sandy
and pebbly loam that is friable when dry and slightly plastic when wet. Lenses of pebble gravel and scattered small
shells occur throughout. The shells appear to be reworked
Cretaceous fossils. One 15cm thick gravelly lens that occurred at -1.0m in depth was sampled; BHT5-A is a collection of the shells, and BHTS-B is the matrix of the lens. An
aggregate of shells found on the surface near BHTS was
collected also, as BHT5-C, to illustrate the nature of the
bedrock producing the shells.
BACKHOE TRENCH NOS. 6 & 7 (BHT6, BHT7)
Two shallow trenches were dug at the western tip of
the southern pasture, -50m east of the bank oflndian Creek
and in the proximity of a prominent dirt-road crossing of
the creek. Neither of the trenches contained any artifacts or
recognizable archaeological features. BHT6 was - lm deep,
and BHT7 -0.9m. The two holes are about 20m apart (BHT6
is north of BHT7), and expose essentially the same section.
The upper -0.Sm is loam, while the underlying material
gravel (BHT6) or gravelly loam (BHT7) containing fossil
shell (sampled in BHT7).
Instructive creek-bank exposures were examined near
the road crossing, about 1OOm south of BHT7. On the east
side of the creek at this point, fluvial sediments like those
found in the two BHT6 and 7 are -4m thick. On the west
side of the creek, however, fluvial sediments are lacking.

The road cut and creek bank instead expose a well-developed, multicolored soil that has formed on the upland bedrock, plus east-dipping layers of gravel and sand that appear to be colluvium comparable in age to the Terrace Deposits found on the east side of the creek. These relationships suggest that during the Holocene, Moss Branch lay to
the east of its current west bank at this point, and thus under
the pasture Terrace.
GEOMORPHOLOGICAL ASSESSMENT
Nature of the Terrace Deposits
The "pastures" in the southeastern portion of the Eagle
Mountain Lake property are underlain by flu vial sediments
to a depth of more than 2.5m and possibly 5m or more. The
upper portion of the sequence generally is muddy sediment
that formed as overbank deposits from Indian Creek. The
lower part of the sequence contains pebbles (and is partially gravel), indicative of creek bottom conditions or deposition from high velocity water during floods. This decrease
in the coarseness of deposits within the upper strata generally reflects a temporal change in depositional (and possibly climatic) conditions. However, the lateral variability in
the nature of the mud-gravel sequence means that the two
facies also are in part laterally equivalent to one another.
The soil developed on these fluvial deposits is both thick
(>2m) and weak (e.g., little structure or CaCO development),
suggesting contemporaneous sedimentary deposition and
soil formation during the latest Quaternary.
Age of the Terrace Deposits
Without radiocarbon dates, assessing the age of the
Terrace Deposits is a matter of inference. Because of their
thickness, the deposits represent deposition over thousands
or a few ten-thousands of years. Before the Deposits were
laid down, the stream system was even more deeply entrenched than it is today. The entrenchment seen today may
have formed since historic settlement of the area, or could
date from sometime earlier in the late Holocene.
Two relationships indicate that the Deposits are at least
in part latest Pleistocene and Holocene in age. First, no
unconformities were seen in the sequence exposed by the
backhoe trenches in the pastures, or in the creek banks along
the pastures. Sedimentation apparently was continuous until the recent downcutting of Indian Creek and Moss Branch.
An observation at odds with this conclusion is the section
observed at BHT2, upstream from the pastures along Moss
Branch; here, a change in sedimentation occurs at -2m in
depth, possibly indicating a significant temporal hiatus (see
Figure 5). Nonetheless, it is likely that the deposits represent several thousand or several tens of thousands of years
of fluvial sedimentation that ended in the late Holocene.

Chapter 4: Geomorphological Assessment of Eagle Mountain Lake

Second, soil development in the deposits is modest.
Geoarchaeology Potential

The age and nature of the Deposits indicates that
they are likely to contain archeological materials. How-

13

ever, the lack of recovery of any cultural materials in
the backhoe trenching (save for the possible cultural
significance of the bivalve shell in BHT2) and prior
surveying indicates that the density of archaeological
materials is likely to be low in the Terrace Deposits,
except perhaps locally.

HISTORICAL OVERVIEW OF EAGLE MOUNTAIN LAKE

EARLY HISTORY OF TARRANT COUNTY
AND THE REGION

The project area is located in the extreme northwest
corner of Tarrant County, and in fact the northernmost portion of the training site borders Wise County. Tarrant County
was carved out of Navarro County by the Texas Legislature
in 1849, and the county was organized in 1850 (Sergeant
1953:87-88).
Most portions of Tarrant County were settled by whites
in the late 1850s and early 1860s, but during this period the
actual numbers of settlers was low. As illustrated in the 1857
GLO map for Tarrant county (Figure 6), even into the late
1850s large areas within and adjacent to the project area
had not even been formally surveyed and platted. This lack
of settlement can be traced principally to a very real fear of
Indian attack. This was especially true of the lands located
in the northwest portion of the county. The Eagle Mountain
Lake training site property lies just outside (to the west and
north) of the protective line of forts constructed by the Texas
Republic and later the United States Army to guard against
incursions by Native American groups. The nearest fort in
the region was Fort Worth, approximately 15 miles to the
southeast (Knight 1953: 10).
One early incident that occurred in the immediate vicinity of the project area (and named for the drainage that
forms its southern boundary) is known as "The 1865 Indian
Creek Raid." A state historical marker commemorating this
event was placed along FM Road 1220, the road that skirts
the western edge of the current property line. The text of the
marker simply states that in September 1865, two Anglo
residents of Denton County were attacked and killed by 15
"Indians" (tribal affiliation is not given) (Awbrey and
Dooley 1992:169).
Another violent episode between Native American
groups and Anglo settlers occurred two years later along
the banks of Walnut Creek in the immediate vicinity of the

FrauRE 6.

EML training site. Now under the waters of Eagle Mountain Lake, in the spring of 1867 the homestead of William
and Sally Hamleton was raided by 60 Kiowa Indians, resulting in the death of Sally and the capture of their two
daughters (Awbrey and Dooley 1992: 27). These isolated
incidents are apparently indicative both of historic Native
American occupation of the region, and the understandably
open hostility felt by these native groups towards Anglo
settlement.
Even after Native American groups had been forcibly
removed from the region, Tarrant County remained sparsely
populated. For example, the largest settlement (and later
county seat) was Fort Worth, which could boast a population of only 67 individuals in 1856, the year of the first GLO
land map for the county, and a whopping circa 3,000 souls
in 1876 (Talbert 1956:45). The population figures forTarrant
County as a whole are just as spare; in 1860, it could claim
only 6,020, and in 1870, the county's enumeration actually

15

Texas Army National Guard Eagle Mountain Lake Training Site

16

recorded a loss of population from just a decade prior, due
to Indian attacks and the unrest of the Civil War (Knight
1953: 217). This lack of settlement in the 191h century, common throughout Tarrant county, was especially true for the
area surrounding Eagle Mountain Lake, perhaps due in part
to the rather shallow and overall poor quality soils that predominate.
COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT AND EARLY
INHABITANTS: LAND USE PRIOR TO THE
FORMATION OF THE BASE
Research into the initial historic occupation of the Eagle
Mountain Lake project area proper was hampered by the
lack of any pre 1876 land deed records on file at the Tarrant
County Courthouse in Fort Worth, due to their loss in a fire
in that year. The presence of the Jefferson family cemetery,
located within the southern portion of the project area, however, did open a small window, allowing an entry point into
the past. Because the Jefferson's are the earliest known anglo
settlers within the survey area, their family history will be
discussed in some detail.
The Jefferson family is not listed in the 1850 Federal
Census for Tarrant County, and another study cannot place
them in the county up to 1859 (Hudson 1963). Further frustrating our efforts to place the Jefferson's at Eagle Mountain Lake in 1860 was the lack of a federal census enumeration for Tarrant County for that year. The Jefferson's, however, were found in the Tarrant County Tax rolls (see Table
I), beginning in 1860. In this year, although the Jefferson
men are listed (given as Henry, Thomas, J.D., and S.), no
lands are assigned to them, and no tax on lands were assessed. Reasonable assurance of the Jefferson's move to
Eagle Mountain Lake by 1860 can be made, however, by
noting the presence of a tombstone with a death date of
October 1860 within the Jefferson Family Cemetery (see
Headstone #4, below). Therefore, it is assumed that sometime in 1859 or 1860 the Jefferson family moved to northwest Tarrant county, and occupied the southern portions of
the Eagle Mountain Lake training site.
By 1861, the Jefferson's land holdings are given in the
Tarrant County tax rolls (see Table 1). Listed in Henry's
name, the tracts owned by the family include the D. Neighbors, W. G. King, Peter Dikeman, and Robinson Surveys.
Of these lands, only the King and Dikeman are contained
within the current boundaries of the Eagle Mountain Lake
training site.
Ten years later, at the time of the enumeration in 1870,
the Jefferson's associated with the Eagle Mountain Lake
property comprise at least two immediate families, the first
of which was made up of six individuals.
â¢
James D. Jefferson. Husband of Emily, his occupation
given as farmer. Born on August 28, 1828 in Tennessee, he was 42 years of age in 1870. Because of their
close relationship and relative ages, it is presumed that

â¢

James is the son of Henry Jefferson. In 1870, J. D. had
a net worth of $10,000 in land and$ I 000 in cash. James
Jefferson died on May 3, 1879, and was buried within
the family cemetery at Eagle Mountain Lake.
Emily G. (or Emalie) Jefferson. Wife ofJames, Emily's
occupation was given as "keeping house," meaning she
worked within her own household. Born in 1835 in the
state of Alabama, Emily was 35 years of age in 1870.
Her date of death is unknown, and she is not believed
to be interred within the Jefferson Cemetery.

By 1870, J.D. and Emily Jefferson had had at least four
children, though only three were alive in 1870.
â¢
Mary Ann Jefferson. Born in 1866, Mary Ann died 1869.
She is buried in Jefferson Family Cemetery with a
marked tombstone.
â¢
Martha Jefferson. Born in 1861 in Texas; Martha was
nine years old in 1870. Her date of death is unknown,
but it is believed that she lived at least until circa 1886,
as her name appears in land deed records up to that
year (e.g., Tarrant County Deed Records; Vol. 41, p.
583).
Minerva D. Jefferson. Born in 1868 in Texas, Minerva
lived to be only nine years of age. She died in 1877 and
was buried in the Jefferson Family Cemetery on the
Eagle Mountain Lake training site.
In addition to the immediate family of James D. and
Emily, the extended Jefferson family included the family of
Henry and Nancy Jefferson.
Henry Jefferson. Henry was born in North Carolina in
1802, and his primary occupation was as a farmer. In
1870, he is listed as having a net worth of $2,000 in
land and $500 in cash. Henry died on October 4, 1875,
at the age of "73 years, 11 months, and 11 days," and
has a marked tombstone in the Jefferson Family Cemetery. It is believed that Henry Jefferson was the father
of James D. Jefferson.
Nancy Jefferson. The wife of Henry Jefferson, Nancy
was born in Kentucky in 1830. As is typical of the period, Nancy's occupation was given simply as "keeping house." From land deed records, it is known that
Nancy Jefferson was alive as late as 1879. Lacking a
tombstone, and the fact that the Jefferson family likely
had moved from the area by circa 1880, it is very unlikely that Nancy is interred within the Jefferson Family Cemetery at Eagle Mountain Lake.
At the time of the census enumeration of 1870, Nancy
and Henry Jefferson had 4 living children, all daughters,
ranging in ages from 1 to 7 years (J. Jefferson - age 7 years;
J. Jefferson - age 5 years; M. Jefferson - age 2 years; S.
Jefferson - age 19 years). Since no headstones with these
names are present in the Jefferson Cemetery, it is unlikely
(though certainly possible) that any of Henry and Jefferson's

The Jefferson's were a slave holding family. In 1860,
the earliest listing of the Jefferson's in the Tarrant County
tax rolls, Henry, the patriarch of the family, is taxed for 4
enslaved African-Americans (assessed for a total value of
$4000; see Table 2). In 1861, this number jumps to 9 and
remains constant (except for 1863, when 8 enslaved individuals are listed) until 1865 and Emancipation occurs.
Following the general sentiments of North Texas, at
the start of the American Civil War the Jefferson family supported the Southern cause and even took up arms against
the Union. In March 1862, James D. Jefferson enlisted in
the Confederate Army with the rank of Sargent. He served
in Company Funder the command of Captain J. C. Terrell.
Additionally, two other Jefferson are listed as serving under
Captain Terrell; D.D. and Sam. Sam Jefferson appears to be
a direct relation to James D, possibly a brother (Garrett 1972:
363-364).
After the war, the Jefferson family remained in Tarrant
County and was still sufficiently affluent and well known
for Henry Jefferson to be appointed to a County Commissioner seat in 1869 (Garrett 1972:295). Between 1867 and
1873, any persons filling county governmental positions
were chosen or approved of by representatives of the Union
Army (Knight 1953:249). Given the family's pro Confederacy stance, either Henry Jefferson swore a loyalty oath to
the Union or otherwise reformed his image in the eyes of
the United States Government.
Six years later (or in 1875), Henry died and was interred in the Jefferson family Cemetery. While Henry's death

Total Property Value

$2,010

was likely a blow to the family, it was the death of James D.
Jefferson that radically altered their lives. James died on
May 3, 1879. Almost immediately after his death, the
Jefferson family began selling off their land holdings at Eagle
Mountain Lake, with the first in a series ofland sales beginning on May 30, 1879 (e.g., Tarrant County Deed Records;
Vol. 0, pp. 546-547; see Table 3).
A summary of all discernible land sales occurring to
properties contained with the current Eagle Mountain Lake
training site is given in Table 3. Although some of the chains
of title are less than complete for certain tracts, they suffice
for the purpose of their construction; a historical reconstruction of land use prior to the founding of the Marine Corps
Air Base at Eagle Mountain Lake.
Presumably, the Jeffersons' farmed portions of their
land, but a goodly portion of the acreage that makes up
the current boundaries of the Eagle Mountain Lake training site was not suitable to farming due to poor soils or
extremely shallow soils. From the numbers of livestock
held by the Jefferson's between 1860 and 1879 (Table 4),
it's clear that the lands were more commonly used for grazing well into the early 1880s. As well, prior to the federal
government's acquisition of the base, the majority of the
private land holders did not actually reside on their property, but used it as grazing lands for cattle, or held it as a
potential investment. In fact, at the time of the Federal
Government's seizure of the EML training site lands by
imminent domain in 1942 (see below for details), only six
residences (i.e., structures) owned by three men were standing (see Table 5).

The Tarrant County Tax Office retained information
regarding the historical assessment of the physical characteristics of lands. For Eagle Mountain Lake, these assessments are given in Table 6. As can be seen, most of the
lands within the current boundaries of the EML training
site were classified as second class grazing (a minimum of
868.75 acres; or approximately two thirds of the current
training site). At least 103 acres (or circa 8% of the training
site) had an official designation of "wasteland."
LAND USE/IMPROVEMENTS
Archived records retained by the Tarrant County Tax
office contain detailed information on property arranged first
by Survey and then by individual tracts. The types of tax
data include a list of recent landowners, any improvements
made to the property, the date on which improvements were
made, and in the case of buildings, even dimensions and
construction details. This information is extremely valuable,
for it provides details regarding any structures that were
standing when the federal government took possession of
the property in 194 2. Since all of these structures were razed
after the Federal Government took possession of the property, in large part this assessment represents the most detailed account of the pre-World War II development of the
Eagle Mountain Lake base property. In all, there are 13 tracts
for which detailed information is known (see Table 5; Figure 7).
Of the 13 tracts of land that make up the current EML
training site, only four had structures of any kind prior to
the establishment of the Marine Corps Glider base in 1942.
These structures are summarized in Table 5. The past 60
years of Marine Corps, Navy, Army, and National Guard
utilization of the property, as well as the incredibly extensive earth moving activities conducted over the pa'it 20 years,
have all combined to successfully eradicate virtually every
indication of a non military presence at Eagle Mountain
Lake. Beyond the possibility of pinpointing these structures
within the greater landscape, archaeology can provide little
additional information, since virtually all of the sites have
been subjected to extreme disturbances several meters deep.
Only a single house foundation was found during our survey of the property, constituting the only foundation of a
pre-World War II structure known to exist. Located within

19

the Chubb Survey (41 TR183), this house site exhibited both
late 19th and early 20th century artifacts (e.g., cut and wire
nails; for a more detailed discussion, see below).
A careful appraisal of this listing, in conjunction with
reference to the map of the tracts created by the Tarrant
County Tax office (see Figure 7), reveals the habitation of
the Jefferson lands and adjacent properties during and after
the Jefferson occupation (see also Tables 3 and 5 for land
deed information).
The William G. King Survey, located along the southwestern portion of the EML training site, was once the property of the Jefferson's, and this is where the Jefferson Family Cemetery is located. However, the only structure listed
as standing when the Navy took possession of the property
in 1942 was a house built in 1936. Clearly, the original
Jefferson home was no longer in existence in 1942, but when
it was actually razed or moved is unknown. No architectural footprint of a structure was discovered on the King
Survey during the pedestrian survey, although a handful of
whiteware sherds were observed scattered within the dirt
road to the north of the cemetery and adjacent to an area
that had been severely disturbed by earth moving activities.
Further, a highly disturbed concentration of 19th century
domestic ceramics and glass were found on the King Survey, also located to the north of the Jefferson Cemetery (site
41TR186). Both areas suggest possible candidates for the
locus of the Jefferson home.
Interestingly, a court case dating to December 27, 1873,
between Henry Jefferson (the patriarch of the Jefferson family) and J. W. Boothe resulted in the Tarrant county sheriff
seizing at least a portion of the William King Survey (i.e.,
Tract #3) and selling it at public auction (Tarrant County
Deed Records, Vol. H, pp. 101-103).Although the Jefferson's
seemingly lost Tract #3 of the King Survey, they presumably continued to reside on it or adjacent properties, as they
buried their deceased loved ones within the family cemetery (including Henry Jefferson in 1875) years after the
court finding; the Jefferson Cemetery is located on Tract
#3.
As for other early residents of the Eagle Mountain Lake
property, in reference to Table 5 it is apparent that the earliest standing structure present on the Chubb survey (i.e.,
present immediately prior to the Federal Governments taking of the land in 1942), is a barn constructed in 1880, though
the earliest listed residence was not constructed until 1885.
This suggests that the Hall's purchased the property circa
1880 or immediately prior. In all, the Chubb Survey once
contained eleven structures prior to 1943, and further, it does
contain some portions of undisturbed land, suggesting that
at least a portion of these structures would have been recognized during the pedestrian survey. However, most of these
more pristine areas are river bottom/flood plain not conducive to home building. The barn and other outbuildings were
also likely located on higher ground, and it is these portions
of the tract that have suffered repeated and intensive im-

HISTORY OF EAGLE MOUNTAIN LAKE
MILITARY BASE
The TXARNG Eagle Mountain Lake facility was not
created by the Texas National Guard out of whole cloth.
Rather, the base can trace its origin to the necessities of the
Navy and Marine Corps during World War IT (Figure 8).
The base was originally commissioned as the Eagle Mountain Marine Corps Air Station in late 1942. It was first utilized by the Marine Corps as a glider training facility and
later by the Navy as a landing site for amphibious and land

based aircraft in transit across the United States. Finally, it
was transferred to the Texas Army National Guard, though
for a number of years it was leased to the Army for use as
an auxiliary air base.
It is important to remember that the Eagle Mountain
Lake facility was originally much larger than its current
boundaries would suggest. At its greatest extent, the entire
base covered 2,922 acres (data on file, AFHRA, Maxwell
AFB, AL). In contrast, the present boundaries of the
TXARNG Eagle Mountain Lake facility encompass only
1250 acres. Thus approximately two thirds of the original
World War II era base are no longer owned by the Guard.
Further, the greatest amount of base infrastructure, in the
form of buildings, docks, runways and hangers, all lie within
the portion of the base now in private hands. Therefore, at
times infrastructure and other elements of the former Marine Corps Air Station discussed in the historical narrative
will not necessarily be located on TXARNG property. The
history of the base and accompanying documentation (e.g.,
historic maps), however, will be holistic and inclusive.

The Marines Corps Glider Program: Founding the
Eagle Mountain Lake Base
Not long after America's entry into World War II, the
United States military recognized the potential of the glider
as a weapon of war. Hitler's effective use of glider troops in
the assaults upon Crete in May 1941 spurred both the United
States Army Air Force and Marine Corps aviators to pursue
the development of glider programs for use in the eventual
Allied invasion of Europe and the Pacific theater (McKillop
2001).
By April 1942, the Marine Corps had organized their
first glider program, Marine Glider Group Seventy-One
(MLG-71), at the Marine Corps Air Station (MCAS) on
Parris Island, South Carolina. Only a month later, Glider
Group 71 spawned the Marine Glider Squadron Seven Hun-

dred Eleven (MLS-711 ). This later group was charged with
the difficult task of implementing the day to day operations
of the glider program. At the beginning of the project, the
Marine Corps glider program had a modest goal of acquiring 75 gliders and training 150 pilots. This number was believed to be sufficient to effectively transport two battalions. Only three months later (or in June 1942), this number
was dwarfed by the inflated goals of training 3,436 pilots in
1,371 gliders, with a maximum carrying capacity of 10,800
troops (McKillop 2001).
Likely spurred by their radically increased goals, the
Marine Corps Group 71 began the search throughout the
country for other locales ideal for the placement of additional glider training facilities. Their sights soon fell upon
Tarrant county and Eagle Mountain Lake in particular. According to official sources, "The Marine Corps established
an air station at Eagle Mountain Lake on 13 July 1942 as a
training facility for Marine Corps aviators" (Roberts
2000:742). This means that only four months after the glider
program had been implemented by the Marine Corps, Group
71 had established a foothold at Eagle Mountain Lake. This
founding date is identical to the establishment of the second glider training program in the United States. On July
13, 1942, the Secretary of the Navy created the Naval Air
Station at Edenton, North Carolina, for the primary purpose
of training Marine glider pilots. Period accounts state that
the Eagle Mountain Lake facility was the largest of the
Marine glider bases in the United States (Roberts 2000: 742;
Ft. Worth Star Telegram Dec 8, 1942; Belo Corporation
1943:210).
The Marine Corps' selection of Eagle Mountain Lake
as the location for the new glider base was not a capricious
one. Rather, the search for the base entailed a great deal of
forethought, and was described as a rather painstaking "almost acre-by-acre survey of the entire county" (Ft. Worth
Star Telegram Dec 8, 1942). All of the following geographic
parameters had to be met: ''They must have a large body of
water, but not too large. They must have adjacent flatlands,
but not all flat. They must have certain thermal conditions,
hospitable weather and accompanying shorelines" (Ft. Worth
Star Telegram Dec 8, 1942).
The man primarily responsible for the selection of Eagle
Mountain Lake as the perfect setting for the new glider training program was Colonel Vernon M. Guymon, Group commander of the Marine Corps Glider Group 71 training program. A detailed biography of Colonel Guymon and other
base personnel is contained in the Operational History below (Ft. Worth Star Telegram Dec 8, 1942).

locale for the new Marine Corps air base, the various tracts
that would eventually combine to form the base were all
private property, owned by several individuals. The land
was used primarily as grazing for cattle, with some farming
as well. As eager as the Fort Worth Chamber of Commerce
may have been to facilitate the Marine Corps presence in
the county (Fort Worth Star Telegram Dec 8, 1942), the
ranchers and farmers whose lands were chosen for the new
base apparently were not as welcoming. The United States
government had to obtain the lands through eminent domain procedures. The base was created on paper on July
13, 1942, although the federal government did not file its
case for eminent domain until some two weeks after this
creation, on August 3, 1942. Apparently, the filing of this
case was only a hollow formality, the outcome already all
but decided. The homes of L. P. Lowery, G. W. Duke, and
William Fleming were razed and the base was built and formally commissioned, all while the case was still working
its way through the courts. On January 11, 1943, in a Fed-

board
board

board
board

eral District Court of the United States (Northern District,
Fort Worth Division), the case of "the United States Vs.
Certain Parcels of Land, Situate in Tarrant County, Texas,
and William Fleming, et al." was heard. A day later, United
States District Judge James C. Wilson decided in favor of
the Department of the Navy (Tarrant County Deed Records;
Vol. 1548, pp. 452-462; January 12, 1943). In February and
March of 1943, three amendments or alterations were added
to this declaration, all apparently issued to clarify ambiguous tract descriptions or to shore up the legal language of
the decision (Tarrant County Deed Records: Vol. 1552, pp.
348-350, Feb 16, 1943; Vol. 1566, pp. 347-349, May 10,
1943; Vol. 1567, pp. 73-75, May 4, 1943).
Even as the condemnation procedure was winding its
way through the courts, the United States Navy and Marine
Corps forged ahead and constructed the large air base and
pilot training school in remarkably short order. The officer
in charge of the Eagle Mountain Lake base construction was
Lieutenant W. L. Powell, USNR. The base was formally

Chapter 5: Historical Overview of Eagle Mountain Lake

commissioned on December 1, 1942, all in a span of only
four months (Fort Worth Star Telegram Dec 1, 1942).
The ceremony marking the official opening of the Marine Corps Air Station at Eagle Mountain Lake was a very
brief, 3 minute affair. Officers and men stood at attention in
front of the as yet still unfinished administration building,
while the base executive officer, Captain Joseph Weldon
Bailey, Jr., read the formal authorization from the vice chief
of naval operations that formally commissioned the air station. Then, with full honor guard and a sailor bugler blowing colors, the American flag was raised for the first time
over the base. The base commander, Lt. Colonel Lee, ended
the ceremony by reading a brief statement; " In accordance
with the authority contained in Reference A, as read by
Captain Bailey, the United States Marine Corps Air Station
at Eagle Mountain Lake, Texas, is commissioned as of this
date" (Fort Worth Star Telegram Dec 1, 1942). The total
area of the Eagle Mountain Lake base was described as 2,922
acres, and construction costs totaled an impressive
$4,740,500 (Fort Worth Star Telegram Dec 8, 1942).
Even though the base was ostensibly open for business,
on the day of its commission Colonel Lee stated that only
70 percent of it was actually completed. The major missing
elements included various access roads, as well as detail
work on several buildings (Fort Worth Star Telegram Dec
1, 1942). Additionally, the infrastructure necessary for the
operation of the Marine Air Station at Eagle Mountain Lake
did not stop at the borders of the base proper. Rather, roads

had to be constructed for easy access to the base. On December 27, 1942, the chairman of the Tarrant County Chamber of Commerce highway committee, T.C. Jones, announced that nine new roads would be constructed in Tarrant
County for the war effort. In particular:
To serve the Marine Air Station an access road
is being constructed from Highway 81 west to
Tarrant-Wise County line at a cost of $83,200.
Another unit of this project will carry the highway
to Newark and a connection with Highway 114 near
Rhome. Cost of this segment is estimated at
$110,400. The road is being built to the Marine
auxiliary base on Lake Bridgeport, five miles long,
is to cost $53,800 (Fort Worth Star Telegram Dec
27, 1942).
Road construction required for other war effort projects
included access roads to the Quartermaster Depot, Tarrant
Field, the Consolidated Aircraft Corporation plant, and the
Globe Aircraft Corporation plant (Fort Worth Star Telegram
Dec 27, 1942). Clearly the physical landscape of northwest
Tarrant County was being altered to a remarkable extent.
Even the Eagle Mountain Lake reservoir itself was altered
to accommodate the needs of the Air Base; it was dredged
so as to assure a minimum seven-foot depth required for
safe amphibious take-offs (Belo Corporation 1943:210).
In March, 1943, it was announced that the infrastructure of the Eagle Mountain Lake facility would be augmented

by the addition of buildings originally constructed for Oklahoma CCC camps. Throughout the month of March and
April, a total of 25 buildings would be moved to either the
main Air Station at Eagle Mountain Lake, or the auxiliary
base at Rhome, Texas. The buildings would be employed as
barracks, recreation buildings, commissaries and office
buildings (Fort Worth Star Telegram Mar 17, 1943).

OPERATIONAL HISTORY
OF EAGLE MOUNTAIN LAKE
As stated previously, the commander of the whole
Group 71 Glider training program was Colonel Vernon M.
Guymon, while the base commander at Eagle Mountain Lake
was Lt. Colonel Harold R. Lee. The executive officer of the
base was Captain Joseph Weldon Bailey, Jr. Finally, the commanding officer of Squadron 711, and the "Dean of Marine
Corps Glider pilots" was Major E. M. Mallory.

Colonel Vernon M. Guymon
Colonel Vernon M. Guymon, was Group commander
of the Marine Corps Glider Group 71 training program.
Colonel Guymon was born on November 2, 1898, in
Rexburg, Idaho. At the beginning of World War II, Guymon
was already a seasoned veteran. He had joined up with the
Marines the day after America's entry into World War I
(i.e., April 6, 1917), and served as an infantryman in the
Second Division. By war's end Guymon had been awarded
" ... the French Croix de Guerre with bronze star, the Purple
Heart with oak leaf cluster, the Second Division citation,
the Victory Medal with Aisne, Aisne-Marne, MeuseArgonne and Defensive-Sector clasps, the French Fourragere
and the Silver Star for overseas service." He received his
pilot training at Pensacola, Florida in 1926. In 1928, he was
awarded the Navy Cross for his courage as a pilot in Nicaragua (Fort Worth Star Telegram Dec 8, 1942).

Lt. Colonel Harold R. Lee
The base commander of the new1y created Marine Corps
Air Station at Eagle Mountain Lake was Lt. Colonel Harold
R. Lee. Born in Ohio on August 31, 1903, Lee enlisted in
the Marines in 1925. He took his preliminary flight training
at Norfolk, Virginia, in 1928, before earning his wings in
1931 at Pensacola. Between 1931 and 1936, Colonel Lee
served as a Marine aviator on such aircraft carriers as the
Langley, the Lexington, the Saratoga, the Yorktown, and
the Ranger. In 1938, he was assigned to the Army Ordnance
School at Lowry Field, Colorado, before serving as a fighter
pilot at Quantico, Virginia. Before arriving at Eagle Mountain Lake in September 1942, Lee's last posting was at
Quonset Point, Rhode Island, where he trained AVS officers (Fort Worth Star Telegram Dec 8, 1942).

Major E. M. Mallory
The remaining principal figure involved in the operational history of Marine Air Station Eagle Mountain Lake
was the commanding officer of Squadron 711, Major E. M.
Mallory. Mallory's job was to train the men assigned to him
to operate glider craft under all conceivableÂ· conditions.
At the time of the base's founding in 1942, the Major
was 31 years old, having been born in 1911 in Alabama.
Mallory graduated from the University of Florida in 1933,
and originally had a reserve commission in the United States
Army before joining the Marines in 1935. After a tour of
duty at sea, Mallory was sent to Pensacola, Florida, to receive pilot training. In 1939 he was transferred to Lakehurst,
New Jersey, and placed in charge of organizing the Marine
Corps parachute troops there. In June 1940, Major Mallory
was sent to Marine Corps headquarters in Washington to
work with the plans and policies division of the glider program. He was the first Marine flyer to go to the Motorless
Flight Institute in Chicago for glider training. Because he
was the first Marine pilot trained in motorless flight, he was
referred to as the "Dean of Marine Corps glider pilots."
Certainly the most experienced glider pilot in the Marines,
Major Mallory joined Glider Group 71 when it was first
organized at Paris Island, South Carolina (Fort Worth Star
Telegram Dec 9, 1942).
The command structure of Marine Glider Group 71, as
well as many of its key personnel, came together at the
Marine base on Parris Island, South Carolina. As referred
to above, when the initial plans for the Marine glider program were deemed too small, the expanded program required
the construction of two major glider-pilot training schools
and auxiliary bases. To achieve these goals, the Eagle Mountain Lake facility (along with its sister base in Edenton, North
Carolina), was created on paper in July 1942. Although the
base was not yet completed, in the middle of November the
Group 71 Glider Program left Parris Island and arrived at
Eagle Mountain Lake, towing their gliders behind them"
(Fort Worth Star Telegram Dec 8, 1942). An excerpted description of the glider-training program taken from the local Ft. Worth newspaper is given below:
When in full operation, the training program
here will be a university course in gliders, carried
on at three colleges. The main base on Eagle Mountain Lake will be headquarters, and the site for preliminary and ground school training. An all-water
school likely will be conducted from an auxiliary
base farther up on Lake Bridgeport. Land training
will be from a 1,000 acre field at Rhome. The
Rhome base is under construction. Pilots, co-pilots and crews for large transport and cargo gliders
will be trained at the Marine Air Station. When
they leave here, they will go as organized and tramtrained groups (four squadrons to the group) to

31

advanced school for combat education. Students
will be naval aviators before they get here. Some
will be officers and some enlisted men. Here they
will learn to handle and tow gliders under every
circumstance - except gunfire. They will learn to
take off under winch-tow and sea plane-tow (Fort
Worth Star Telegram December 8, 1942).
At its height of operations, Marine Corps Air Station
Eagle Mountain Lake (along with its auxiliary field at
Rhome, Texas) supported an impressive total of 141 officers, 1,003 enlisted personnel, and 75 aircraft (Roberts
2000:742).

simple cross-bar landing gear, hydraulically actuated brakes,
a steerable tail wheel and increased fin area (McKillop
2001).
In August 1942, the United States Army Air Corps ordered a total of 253 of these gliders, the army models designated as TG-8-PI. In turn, the United States Navy acquired
three of the Army's TG-8's to evaluate their effectiveness
in their own glider program, re-designating them as LNP-1
(McKillop 2001). The specifications exclusively for the
glider models produced by Piper are not known, but the
specifications for the NE-1 Cub (that is, the motor driven
models) are given below (McKillop 2001).
Piper NE-1 and NE-2-1

THE GLIDERS OF EAGLE MOUNTAIN LAKE

Marine pilots at Eagle Mountain Lake began training
with Army type gliders, with the assumption that specially
built amphibious naval models would later be constructed
(Belo Corporation 1943:210). This apparently never occurred, likely due to the very brief tenure of the Marine Corps
glider program.
There were two principal glider aircraft used in the
Marine Corps training program at Eagle Mountain Lake.
The first was the Piper LNP (a modification of the Piper
J3C-65 Cub, and known by the Army Air Corps as the TG8-PI ). The second type of glider aircraft was the Schweizer
LNS-1 (an adaptation of their civilian model SGS-2-8, designated by the Army as the TG-2).
Piper LNP-1

The Piper LNP glider was a war-time modification of a
very popular private aircraft model manufactured by the
Piper Corporation, the Piper J3C-65 Cub. Several thousand
civilian model Piper Cubs were used by all branches of the
American military during World War II, but at the request
of the Army Air Corps, the Piper Corporation developed a
glider aircraft out of the existing Piper L-4A Cub design.
The engine and landing gear were removed and replaced
with" ... an extended nose accommodating an instructor pilot and two students, all with full controls. Other modifications included the addition of a simple cross-bar landing
gear, hydraulically actuated brakes, a steerable tail wheel
and increased fin area" (McKillop 2001). Piper LNP glider

Apparently the Piper gliders were deemed by the Marines as adequate to the task required of them. When Squadron 71 arrived at Eagle Mountain Lake in November 1942,
they were towing behind them a total of seven LNP-1 gliders, in addition to flying two of the standard motor driven
Piper NE-1 's (and nine other aircraft). The number of gliders at MCAS Eagle Mountain Lake would later increase to
21 (McKillop 2001). The additional 14 gliders were presumably Schweizer LNS-1 models.
Schweizer LNS-1 Glider

The second glider model used in the Marine Corps
Glider program at Eagle Mountain Lake was manufactured
by the Schweizer Company at the Elmira Knitting Mills in
Elmira Heights, New York. The Schweizer gliders were first
used by the Army, and soon after were adopted by the Navy.
The Amy designation for the gliders was TG-2, while the
Navy referred to the Schweizer gliders as LSN-1. Their initial construction of steel and aluminum tubing was somewhat unusual for the time, though later wartime models were
manufactured out of the more typical wood. In all, between
1942 and 1943 twelve Schweizer LSN-1 gliders were ordered by the Navy for use in the Marine glider training program. As with the Piper gliders, most of the LSN-1 's were
likely destroyed on site at Eagle Mountain Lake, when the
glider-training program was terminated in 1943. However,

32

at least one of the Marine Corps LSN-1 's assigned to Eagle
Mountain Lake was saved from destruction, and is currently

EAGLE MOUNTAIN LAKE AUXILIARY BASE:
RHOME FIELD

Two auxiliary fields, Rhome Field and Lake Bridgeport, are initially mentioned in regard to the Air Station at
Eagle Mountain Lake. Apparently, however, only the airfield at Rhome was actually constructed. In fact, Rhome
Field was established by the United States Marine Corps on
December 1, 1942, the day that the Air Station at Eagle
Mountain Lake went operational. Again, as with Eagle
Mountain Lake, this date marks only its creation on paper.
Colonel Lee, the base commander at MCAS EML told the
press on December 1 that construction at Rhome Field had
not yet begun. Rhome Field was located only 4.8 miles southeast (by air) from the Air Station at Eagle Mountain Lake
(data on file, AFHRA, Maxwell AFB, AL).
In official naval records, the base was first designated
as an MCAAF, or Marine Corps Auxiliary Air Field. From
December 1942 to July 1943, the Rhome base operated as a
landing field for glider craft. The MCAAF designation was
later changed to NAAS, or Naval Auxiliary Air Station in
July 1943. This switch corresponds to the curtailment in the
glider training program generally, and the date matches Eagle
Mountain Lake's change from a Marine Air Station to a
Naval Air Station (Fort Worth Star Telegram Dec 1, 1942;
Roberts 2000:749).
After July 1, 1943, the base functioned as a convenient
mid-way stopping point for land based air craft en route
between the east or west coasts. In March 1944, the base at
Rhome was once again designated as a Marine corps installation (MCAAF), and functioned as such until its closure
on July 28, 1945 (Roberts 2000:749).
The base at Rhome Field was never as large or as elaborate as that found at Eagle Mountain Lake. It covered less
than half the area (1,244 acres) and possessed little of the
larger base's infrastructure. For example, it never had barracks nor a control tower (Eagle Mountain Lake Air Station
file: n.d.).

THE END OF THE MARINE CORPS AIR BASE
AT EAGLE MOUNTAIN LAKE

With the rapidity of events during World War II, many
programs begun in earnest at the onset of the war were soon
outpaced and rendered obsolete. This obsolescence occurred
with the Marine Corps glider-training program. While gliders did see limited use in the European theater, it became
increasingly apparent that there was very little practical application for gliders among the small Pacific Islands. Thus
the entire Marine glider program was terminated in May
1943 and both MLG-71 and MLS-711 were decommissioned. All of the gliders (save for at least one Schweizer
LNS-1 glider; see above) were destroyed and disposed of
on site at MCAS Eagle Mountain Lake (McKillop 2001).
After the curtailment of the United States glider program, the Navy re-designated the Marine Corps Air Station
as a Naval Air Station (NAS) on July 1, 1943. Reflecting
this change, the base at Eagle Mountain Lake shifted its
focus and provided training for mainly amphibious aircraft.
It also served a very strategic function as a refueling, maintenance and repair station for seaplane squadrons on transcontinental flights (Roberts 2000:742; A.H. Belo Corporation 1945:81). For example, it is recorded that on July 14,
1944, a naval aircraft, a Douglas (SBD-5) Dauntless, was
forced to make an emergency landing immediately after take
off from the runway of the MCAS Eagle Mountain Lake
(Baugher 2001).
Somewhat inexplicably, on March 31, 1944, or only a
year after the Navy changed its designation from an MCAS
to an NAS base, it reversed itself and re-designated the Eagle
Mountain Lake facility (as well as the Rhome Field base)
as a Marine Corps base once more. Since the glider program was all but eliminated, the newly designated Marine
base instead maintained 54 fighter and dive-bomber aircraft,
while 18 aircraft were kept at the auxiliary Rhome Field
(Roberts 2000:742).
With the war over, the necessity of the airfield at Eagle
Mountain Lake was greatly diminished. Accordingly, the
order came down on April 1, 1946, for the base personnel to
be pared down to just a skeleton crew. Finally, on December 15, 1946, Marine Corps Air Station Eagle Mountain
Lake, Texas, was disestablished altogether (Roberts
2000:742).
ESTABLISHMENT OF THE EAGLE
MOUNTAIN LAKE NATIONAL GUARD
BASE/ARMY AIR BASE

In 1947, a document from the Navy Department revealed that the official closure of the MCAS at Eagle Mountain Lake was being rethought in light of the cold war. The
Navy Department admitted that the base was only intermit-

Chapter 5: Historical Overview of Eagle Mountain Lake

tently needed for" ... Naval Air Reserve and Naval Reserve
Training." In this vein, the Naval Department issued a permit (as Chief of Naval Operations Naval Message# 151530)
in January 1947, allowing the Texas National Guard Armory Board access to the base for" ... joint use of a public
airport and to provide Armories, Training and Recreational
facilities for the Texas National Guard." This permit was
signed by all parties on February 28, 1947 (Eagle Mountain
Lake file: n.d.).
It is important to note that this agreement was only a
temporary permit, allowing the joint use of the base at Eagle
Mountain Lake by the Navy and the Texas National Guard.
It did not constitute the sale or leasing of the property to the
Guard. Despite this agreement, it is unknown how much
usc the Eagle Mountain Lake facility actually saw from either entity during these years. A 1951 map of the base describes it as the "Former" United States Marine Corps Air
Station (Figure 9), but does reveal that the infrastructure of
the base created during the war remained virtually intact.
On September 2 1957, an act of Congress (Public Law
85-258) allowed for the transfer of ownership of the old air
base at Eagle Mountain Lake to the state of Texas, and more
specifically, the Texas Army National Guard. The actual
quit claim deed between the federal government and the
state of Texas, officially transferring ownership of the base
to the state of Texas, was filed on November 22, 1957. (A
quit claim involves deeding the property without a guarantee that it was free of debts or claims of ownership by others.) The extent of property was described as 2,477 .43 acres
(Tarrant County Deed Records; Vol. 3213, p. 365).
One of the stipulations of the law was that the state of
Texas could dispose of or salvage any or all of the buildings
located on the base (Eagle Mountain Lake file: n.d.). A year
after the state took ownership of the property (or on August
25, 1958), the north eastern portion of the Eagle Mountain
Lake property (some 16.96 acres) was designated by the
State of Texas, under the Texas Civil Defense Protection
Act of 1951, as an area to be developed as:
... an underground civil defense control center which would serve as a communications point
and temporary headquarters for city and county
government in the event of enemy action, and
which would also provide space for a sub-district
command post for the State of Texas Disaster District, and which control center would contain above
ground facilities including parking area, two 150
foot radio antenna towers and protective fence ...
(Eagle Mountain Lake file: n.d.).
It is unknown if any elements of this proposed facility
were ever constructed. Certainly no buildings or other elements of this Civil Defense base are present on the 1960
Eagle Mountain Lake training site map (Figure 10). During
our pedestrian survey, however, building debris, largely in

33

the form of bricks and concrete, was present in the immediate vicinity of the area designated, though overall the debris was slight, and certainly no indications of an "underground civil defense control center" were observed. This
building debris likely represents only the remains of the
small "main gate house" and "gas meter house" demarcated
on the 1960 Army training site map (see Figure 10).
Somewhat inexplicably, on March 18, 1959, or less than
two years after the federal government quit claimed the Eagle
Mountain Lake facility to the state of Texas, the United States
Army leased a large portion of the training site from the
state (Tarrant County Deed Records; Vol. 3907, p. 341).
The purpose of this lease is clear - the establishment of an
Army Air Base. An earlier document, dated February 18,
1959, contains explicit language requiring the rehabilitation of certain facilities, mainly pertaining to the aircraft
hangers, prior to the completion of the lease agreement. In
fact, all of the improvements made at this time were located
within the western portion of the base, which lies outside
the boundaries of the current Eagle Mountain Lake facility.
The result of this agreement can be seen in the General Site
Map of the Eagle Mountain Lake Army Air Field, drafted
on August 29, 1960 (Eagle Mountain Lake file: n.d.).
The specific length of time that the lease (granting the
Army access to the base) was to remain in effect is not stated.
Rather, the lease reads:
To have and to hold the said premises for the
term beginning 18 March, 1959, through June 28,
1959, provided that unless and until the Government shall give notice of termination in accordance
with provision 6 hereof, this lease shall remain in
force thereafter from year to year without further
notice; provided that this lease shall in no event
extend beyond June 30, 2009 (Eagle Mountain
Lake file: n.d.); Tarrant County Deed Records, Vol.
3907, p. 341).
A few months after filing the 1959 lease, a supplementary agreement was entered into between the United States
Army and the Texas National Guard, for access to additional portions of property and buildings at Eagle Mountain
Lake. This document is referred to as Supplemental Agreement Number l. This was soon followed in 1961, with
Supplemental Agreement Number 2. (Tarrant County Deed
Records: October 13, 1959, Vol. 3381, p. 2; Eagle Mountain Lake file: n.d.).

and isolated (in context as well as time) were actually found
combined in a way oddly congruous with this postmodern
era. This brief footnote to history is regarding the Aurora
Air Ship (i.e., U.F.O.) Crash of 1897, and the rationale for
the founding of both the Eagle Mountain Lake base, as well
as the auxiliary Rhome Field.
According to an 1897 article that appeared in the Dallas Morning News, the little town of Aurora, Texas, located
some 5 miles north of the EML base, was witness to an
airship of unknown origin flying across its early morning
skies. It had been sighted on more than once occasion for
several days, but according to this l 91h century account, on
April 19, 1897:
about 6 o'clock this morning the early risers
of Aurora were astonished at the sudden appearance of the airship which has been sailing around
the country. It was traveling due north and much
nearer the earth than before. Evidently some of the
machinery was out of order, for it was making a
speed of only ten or twelve miles an hour, and
gradually settling toward the earth. It sailed over
the public square and when it reached the north
part of town it collided with the tower of Judge
Proctor's windmill and went into pieces with a terrific explosion, scattering debris over several acres
of ground, wrecking the windmill and water tank
and destroying the judge's flower garden. The pilot of the ship is supposed to have been the only
one aboard and, while his remains were badly disfigured, enough of the original has been picked up
to show that he was not an inhabitant of this world
(Dallas Morning News Apr 19 1897).
An officer with the U.S. Army Signal Service examined the body and wreckage, and offered his professional
opinion that the ship and its pilot were from Mars. The ship's
material was described as "an unknown metal, resembling
somewhat a mixture of aluminum and silver,'' and the ship
itself was described as massive (weighing several tons), with
wreckage scattered over several acres. The remains of the
pilot, whatever his origin, were buried in the community
cemetery of Aurora, Texas (Minor 1999; Dallas Morning
News Apr 19 1897).
In truth, we will never know what actually transpired
in the skies over the little town of Aurora on that Spring
morning in 1897. Even at the time of the crash, there was
some healthy skepticism suggesting that it was all just a
hoax to generate interest in a dying town. What is just as
interesting, however, is America's current obsession with
government conspiracies and extra terrestrials, and how this

obsession has worked elements of both Eagle Mountain Lake
and the Aurora Crash into a single narrative.
On two current conspiracy websites, "histories" of the
1897 Aurora Crash are presented, and their interpretation
of events suggests that the Aurora crash was " ... covered up
by the Government," and later passed off as a hoax to hide
the truth (Hickman 2001; Horak 2001).
The connections made by conspiracy theorists between
the 1897 crash and the Eagle Mountain Lake Air Base are
based on two different arguments. First, it is suggested the
location of the auxillary Rhome Field base was not an accidental one. Rather, it is argued that Rhome Field was constructed as an " ... alien recovery base," and it is further suggested, somewhat inexplicably, that it was " ... set up and
running from clear back 100 years ago" (Hickman 2001).
The second argument is that the crash site of the 1897
Aurora UFO actually occurred on the Eagle Mountain Lake
Base itself, and that in 1942 the selection of the property
that would later combine to form the EML base was purposely done to prevent the recovery of any more space ship
debris from falling into the hands of private citizens. According to Hickman, such fragments have interesting properties suggesting a non terrestrial origin, and have been commonly "confiscated for analysis by the military and never
returned" (Hickman 2001).
James Horak, one conspiracy website author, claims
that the crash site is specifically located on that portion of
the former EML Marine Base belonging to Kenneth
Copeland's International Ministries, although it is implied
that all of the TEEX heavy machinery training and earth
moving activities conducted on the National Guard's portion of the EML base has been done as a simple cover up,
and that the actual rationale for all of that earth moving over
the years has been to literally "mine" the crash site for ship
debris (Horak 2001).
These interpretations are "fascinating," to say the least,
and are in the best postmodern, conspiracy laden traditions
of our times. Truly, the Great Aurora Air Ship Cover Up
story would make a worthy addition to any "X-Files" episode. All that can be said is that perhaps something did occur in 1897. The establishment of the Marine Corps air base
along the shores of Eagle Mountain Lake, however, is an
unlikely (and somewhat cumbersome) addition to the myth,
for in shoehorning the UFO crash story into the story of the
formation of the World War II era glider base, some quite
basic and incontrovertible truths were discarded in the process. Suffice it to say, no one hundred year old flying saucer
debris was recovered from any of our shovel tests, nor were
any other indications of the great 1897 Aurora air ship crash
discovered in the process.

RESULTS: A SUMMARY OF SITES, FEATURES, AND LOCALITIES

During the pedestrian survey, the remains of every historic structure or element of material culture 50 years of
age or older were noted. Since no prehistoric materials, not
even isolated finds or lithic raw materials, were encountered during the survey, all of the discussion that follows
concerns only the historic use of the Eagle Mountain Lake
property. Although several elements of both the ranching/
farming life and the World War II era base were noted, formal site designations were assigned to only two of these
remains, namely the Jefferson Family Cemetery (41TRI82)
and the foundation of an historic house site (41TR183).
The remaining elements of the original MCAS base and
its various permutations over the subsequent years (e.g.,
Naval Air Station, Army Air Field, National Guard training
site), were also duly recorded in the field, and are described
in some detail below. They were not, however, assigned
formal site status. In a sense, the Eagle Mountain Lake base
as a whole is a site unto itself, and the remains of its former
infrastructure merely features within this larger landscape.
As well, although artifacts demarcating the locus of preWorld War II historic occupations were encountered during the pedestrian survey, all (save the two formally designated sites and another located on bedrock) were extremely
disturbed to depths between 1 to 6 meters below present
ground surface, virtually assuring no possibility of intact
deposits.
Given this, all of these historic residues, no matter how
disturbed, still have value, as they allow the placement of at
least some of the pre-World War II farming/ranching activities across the landscape. This is something that the list
of structures discovered buried in the Tarrant County Tax
Office, no matter how detailed otherwise, could never do.
Accordingly, the "site" descriptions that follow will include
the two formally designated sites, as well as the extremely
disturbed remains of the 19th/early 20th century occupation of the survey area. Finally, there is an assessment of the
condition (all fragmentary) of the infrastructure once asso-

ciated with the World War II era Eagle Mountain Lake Marine Corps Air Base.

PRE-WORLD WAR II SITES
All of the pre-W.W.11 era historic sites (save for
41TR188) are located in the southern portion of the survey
area. Except for the Jefferson Cemetery, all of these sites
are either located on slivers of relatively undisturbed deposits that are surrounded by highly disturbed areas, or are
actually disturbed remnants of previously intact sites.
Although the lands that make up the current boundaries
of the training site were settled as early as 1860 and experienced the occupation of small scale ranchers and farmers up
to 1942, the archaeological (i.e., material) remains of these
occupations are slight. Save for the Jefferson Cemetery, little
remains materially to tell the story of those who undoubtedly
endured many privations and risked constant conflict with
Native American groups even into the late 1870s.

Jefferson Family Cemetery (41TR182)
The Jefferson Cemetery consists of a small family burial
ground, associated with one of the early pioneer families
who homesteaded the southern portion of the EML project
area (as discussed above; see Figures 11, 12). This site was
thoroughly documented. First, the site was photo documented, the tombstones were measured, drawn and described, and the accompanying text was transcribed verbatim. Charcoal rubbings of the gravestones were also done.
Finally, a plan map was drafted (Table 7).
In all, 5 formal, commercially made headstones (with
associated footstones) are present. There is also evidence to
suggest the presence of at least one additional grave, due to
the observation of a partial limestone tablet fragment that
does not match any of the other intact or partially intact stones.
Beyond the presence of the additional tablet stone frag-

ment, there is no further evidence for other graves (e.g.,
linear depressions outside the fence, etc.), and so a minimum of five and likely six individuals are interred within
the Jefferson graveyard. The possibility certainly exists,
however, that other interments may be present.
All of the gravestones are contained within a whitewashed wood picket fence constructed by TEEX personnel. According to Mike Griffith, TEEX field director at Eagle
Mountain Lake, when he arrived at the EML training site in
the early 1980s several of the stones were haphazardly
strewn across the clearing. To protect them from incursions
by heavy equipment, TEEX personnel arranged the displaced stones around a single and apparently in situ stone,
marking the remains of Henry Jefferson. Henry's stone is a
well carved tablet that is no longer socketed within its associated plinth, but instead lies horizontally, broken into 4
pieces and partially embedded in the ground. Further suggesting the in situ nature of Henry Jefferson's stone is the
slight linear depression that exists between the headstone
and footstone.
Two slight linear depressions are also apparent between
headstones 1 and 2 and headstones 2 and 3, both with east/
west alignments paralleling the current alignment of the
headstones and foot stones. If these depressions are truly
indicative of human burials, it suggests that the current stone

alignment closely matches the actual grave positioning.
Of the five intact tombstones, all were commercially
manufactured and each was associated with a small commercially made footstone. In the following descriptions, the
headstones are individually numbered from 1 through 5,
while the footstones have a corresponding numeration of
lA through SA. Finally, the fragmentary tablet stone is referred to as Headstone No. 6.
Although some of the stones are known to have been
moved from their original positions, they are now orientated in the traditional east/west alignment (i.e., headstones
at the west and the footstones at the east), typical of Protestant traditions.

a slanting face (i.e., the top of the marker is narrow, and it

deaths of these two children are separated by some eight
years (Figure 15). It is possible that specific styles in locally

Notes: This headstone is broken and incomplete, as
can be seen from the missing elements in the above inscription (Figure 16). Interestingly, the stone cutter's mark, namely
W. M. Mann of Sherman, Texas, was also observed on a
stone in the nearby community graveyard known as Indian
Creek Cemetery. This stone, marking the grave of William
Lytle, is almost identical to the intact portion of the Jefferson
stone# 4. It maintains an identical style of representing the
name of the deceased in a recessed arch. It also offers some
insight into the likely original appearance of the Jefferson
stone# 4.
The upper portion of the Lytle stone has a single hand
pointing upward, with the carved words "GONE HOME,"
present where the missing elements of the Jefferson stone
should be. Even the means by which the age (birth and death)
of the deceased is rendered is identical on the two stones
(e.g., WILLIAMLYTLE/DIEDMARCH21, 1870/ AGED56
YRS,2MS, lD).
Certainly one of the early settlers in northwest Tarrant
County, William Lytle is believed to have owned property
located within the current boundaries of Eagle Mountain
Lake training site. This belief is based on the 1872 land sale
of the P. H. Pope Survey occurring between Helona Lytle
(possibly William Lytle's widow) and N. G. Holt. Although
this deed was lost in the 1876 Tarrant County Courthouse
fire, it is described in a later deed (Tarrant County Deed
Records; Vol. 188, p. 80).

Plinth Dimensions: 61 cm (length), 31.5 cm (width), 5
cm (height of plinth exposed above ground surface)
Notes: Above the inscription, at the top of the stone is a
carved representation of an open book, with the words
"HOLY BIBLE" carved across the open pages (Figure 17}.
This open bible motif is resting atop a small, carved pedestal or base, with a tassel/rope motif dangling at either end.
Another carved decorative element is a simplistic fleur de
Lis located between the words "Henry Jefferson" and "Died."
Henry Jefferson's headstone is a simple limestone tablet. It is the only one that is no longer upright and socketed
within its associated plinth. Rather, it lies horizontally, face
up on the surface, and in fact is partially embedded within
the ground. Headstone # 5 is also broken into four large
pieces.
Footstone #SA
Ii:iscription: H. J.
Dimensions: 21.2 cm (length), 5 cm (width), 24.5 cm
(height; above ground surface only)
As with the other footstones, this example is a simple
limestone tablet of presumed commercial manufacture.
Footstone #SA is inscribed with the initials of Henry
Jefferson, and so its current association with headstone #5
is presumed to be correct.
Headstone # 6 (fragment)
Inscription: no inscription
Dimensions: 23 cm (length), 19 cm (width), 16.5 cm
height; 5.2 cm thick
Notes: This stone is a roughly triangular shaped fragment of a finely cut limestone tablet. The fragment observed
is blank, with no carved elements present (either recessed
or in relief). It did not match any of the other stones in the
cemetery, and so may well represent an additional interment.
The establishment of an exclusive family cemetery
on private land was not unusual in the rural 19th century,
but what is unusual is the presence of two community
cemeteries located approximately 1 and 1/2 miles to the
southwest and east of the Jefferson Family Cemetery, one
of which (Indian Creek), actually predates the Jefferson
burials.
The Indian Creek Cemetery, located to the immediate
east of the I=;:agle Mountain Lake base property, was likely
in existence at least as early as 1856, as this is the date of
the earliest marked grave (John Hudson; died September
19, 1856). Thus, it predates the settlement of the Jefferson
family on their EML properties by approximately 4 years.
The Indian Creek Cemetery is a large community graveyard,
containing in excess of 150 burials. Its name (i.e., Indian
Creek) is probably a relatively recent assignment. The cemetery was (and still is) associated with the present day com-

Figure 17. Headstone 5 (Henry Jefferson).

munity of Newark, which itself was originally named Odessa.
The formation of the community of Newark can be dated to
September 8, 1855, as this is when the post office was opened
(Texas State Historical Marker on site).
The community cemetery to the immediate west of the
Jefferson Cemetery and the Eagle Mountain Lake training
site is known as the Dido Cemetery, and serves the needs of
the small community of Dido, Texas. It is far larger than
the Indian Creek Cemetery (estimated to contain over 1000
burials), and of more recent origin, having been formally
dedicated in 1887. Although both the Jefferson Family Cemetery and the Indian Creek Cemetery predate its founding,
the Dido Cemetery still contains some historic graves of
the area's early settlers. For example, many graves of one of
these settler families, the Van Zandts, are interred at the
Dido Cemetery.
The earliest appearance of the Van Zandt family in
Texas can be traced to Isaac Van Zandt, who negotiated, on
behalf of the Texas Republic, the annexation of Texas to
the United States Government. In more recent times, the
cremated remains of the celebrated Texas singer/songwriter
(John) Townes Van Zandt (born March 7, 1944, died January
1, 1997) were interred in the Van Zandt family plot at Dido
Cemetery (Personal observation; Schmidt 1984: 74; 78).

SITE3(41TR183)

Site 3 (41TRI83) consists of a late 19th and early 20th
century domestic house site (Figures 18, 19). In its current
state, the site is most obviously marked by a remnant limestone foundation and a stone and brick chimney fall. Additionally, the surface surrounding the immediate site area
exhibits a rather diffuse scatter of historic artifacts, including container glass, ceramic shards, and metal refuse.
With some important caveats, the immediate site integrity appears to be fairly good. Although the foundation
of the former structure appears to be "intact," the surrounding yard area is almost certainly truncated, the house foundation literally surrounded by moderate to severe disturbances on all four sides (Figures 3 and 19).
The edge of one of the training site's large gravel pits
borders the site to its immediate north, while a circa 1950s
or later military "pop up" target (excavated into the ridge
top) and associated modern construction debris litter the
eastern boundary of the 19th century site. To the immediate
south lies one of the training site's main dirt roads and disturbed soils from heavy earth moving activities, while another road and disturbed field lies to the immediate west of
the house foundation.
Apparently what saved the foundation from destruction can be attributed to two main factors; the reluctance to
disturb the three large elm trees that have grown up on the
site in the past 50 years, and the fact that the ridge upon
which the foundation was placed is essentially bedrock.
The house foundation measures approximately 5 meters
by 6 meters, and is composed of undressed, native limestone. A chimney fall is present along the northeast wall,
made up of limestone cobbles, commercial and apparently
handmade brick. The occupation of the site would seem to
be late 19th and early 20th century. Both cut and wire nails
were observed, and other temporally diagnostic artifacts
dating to this period were scattered around the area (e.g.,
canning jars, ironstone sherds, etc.).
Although it is presumably a residence (and not an outbuilding), its relatively small dimensions (i.e., 5 by 6 meters)
do not correlate with any of the structures listed in Table 5.
Either this structure is unaccounted for in Table 5, or the
existing foundation/architectural footprint does not accurately reflect the structure's original dimensions.
LATE 19TH/EARLY 20TH CENTURY DOMESTIC
REFUSE SCATTER (41TR186)

Located to the south of the east Oak Motte and north of
the Jefferson Cemetery, this locality consists of a late 19th
and early 20'h century domestic refuse scatter (e.g.,
whiteware sherds, container glass, cut nails, etc.). This scatter
is both diffuse and highly disturbed (to several meters in
depth), with all of the observed artifacts ringing the edge of
a large "crater" or artificial pit constructed by heavy equip-

ment earth moving operations. No house foundations or
other architectural remains were observed. No artifacts were
collected.

REFUSE SCATTER (41TR187)

A very diffuse scatter of late 19thand early 20'hcentury
ceramics (predominately plain whitewares) were observed
in the area between the two Oak Mottes. This area is marked
by a dirt road and severely disturbed soils flanking the road
on either side. Site integrity is virtually non-existent, as large-

scale heavy machinery earth moving activities have disturbed
the soils in this area to two or meters in depth. During the
pedestrian survey, large open trenches approaching these
depths were observed in this area over broad portions of the
landscape.
LATE 19TH/EARLY 20TH CENTURY DOMESTIC
REFUSE SCATTER (41TR188)
A late 19th and/or early 20th century artifact scatter was
encountered in the northernmost portion of the EML training site, on the northern addition adjacent to the fence line
separating the training site property from the right of way for
the 0, K & T Railroad track. Very few artifacts were present
over all, those observed consisting of a zinc washtub, amethyst glass fragments (i.e., manganese glass), stoneware
crock fragments (Albany interior glaze, Bristol exterior), and
a few large soft paste porcelain fragments. Although this
locality has not been subjected to heavy equipment disturbances typical of the training site as whole, the artifacts are
resting on outcrops of exposed bedrock with very little sediments present. Therefore, there is little to no possibility for
subsurface deposits. The artifact scatter suggests an isolated dumping episode (or episodes), and not a formal in situ
habitation. No artifacts were collected.

factured in 1951, and a 6 oz Dr. Pepper bottle, dated to 1955.
Apparently this barracks complex was razed sometime
between 1955 and 1960, as it is no longer present on the
1960 Army training site map (see Figure 10).
TWO BRICK/CONCRETE TOWERS WITH
ASSOCIATED CONCRETE FOUNDATIONS,
SIDEWALKS, AND BRICK SCATTER (41TR190)
The two towers and building remains are located in the
northern portion of the property (Figures 3; 21, 22). Both
towers are constructed of red brick. One of the towers is a
single story in height, while the second (though identical in
construction), is two stories tall. These two structures are
essentially intact. Both date to the post W.W.11 era, and are
presumed to have been specifically built on the property
for use by the Texas National Guard. This belief is based on
the absence of both towers on the both the 1951 EML base
map (Figure 9), the original 1955 Avondale quad map, and
the 1961 Army training site map (Figure 10). Rather, the
earliest map upon which they appear is the 1968 photo revised quad. Further, in the 1964-65 Texas Almanac, the
Eagle Mountain Lake facility is described as "for use as
rifle ranges and training areas for the Texas National Guard"
(Belo Corporation 1964:632). Sometime between 1960 and
1964/1968, the towers were constructed to presumably serve
as firing range observation posts.

World War II Era Barracks or Cantonment Area
(41TR189)
Delineated on the 1951 EML Base Map as "Housing
Project" (Figure 9), this site (even in its ruined state) is easily the largest and most massive remnant of the old MCAS
base still in existence on public lands (Figures 3, 20). Even
in its present condition, it clearly can be seen on aerial photographs (e.g., Ressel 1981). Currently the site consists of a
complex series of concrete sidewalks and foundations for
barracks. Additionally, at least four large, above ground concrete boxes, surrounding rectangular, subsurface shafts cut
into the hill, are present.
Presumably build in the early years of W.W.II, a period
reference describes the housing at Eagle Mountain Lake as,
"the Air Station has commodious barracks for men and bachelor officers" (Ft. Worth Star Telegram Dec 8, 1942). This
barracks complex was apparently intact and saw at least intermittent use into the 1950s. This was established through
two lines of evidence. First, the complex was still intact in the
early 1950s, as it is delineated on the 1955 Avondale quad
map (the earliest USGS 7.5 minute quad map available of the
project area). Second, two surface artifacts observed on the
site were both dated to the 1950s: an amber bottle/jar base,
with an Owens Illinois Glass Company maker's mark, manu-

(41TR191)

Located on the 1951 EML Base Map (keyed as "concrete surfacing"), this likely W.W.II era bridge remnant lies
in ruins across Moss Branch, north of its confluence with
Indian Creek. In its present condition, it is collapsed and
impassable.
CONCRETE FOUNDATIONS AND SIDEWALKS
(41TR192)

Site consists of a relatively large complex of foundations, located along the county road and the western edge
of property line. This complex of foundations are identified
on the 1951 Base Map (Figure 9) as being associated with
the "Visual Training" Building(# 87), "2 and 3 Dimensional
Night Vision Training" Building (#88), "Mobile Maintenance
Trainer" (#'s 89, 90), and the "Synthetic Training" Buildings
(#'s 102, 103). These buildings were standing in 1955, as
their presence is indicated on the 1955 Avondale USGS 7.5
minute quad. These structures are missing from the 1960
Army training site map (Figure 10) as well as the revised
1968 Avondale quad, suggesting that they were razed sometime between 1955 and 1960.

Now consisting of a number of concrete foundations
and concrete sidewalks located immediately adjacent and
to the south of the modem day main entrance gate and
TEEX trailers, this site once marked the location of at least
three structures. This former complex of buildings is identified on the 1951 MCAS Eagle Mountain Lake base map
(Figure 9) as the "Officer's Mess" (#16) the "Recreation
Building"(# 18) and the "Garbage Shed" (#82). By 1961,
the number of structures has been reduced (Figure 10);
the Officer's Mess is now identified as a "Squadron Building" (#6), and the Garbage Shed is now identified as "Garbage Shed, Officer's Mess" (#82). These buildings were
demarcated on the 1955 Avondale 7.5' quad map as well
as the 1960 training site map (Figure 10) but are absent
from the 1968 photo-revised Avondale quad. This means
that all of the structures were razed sometime between 1961
and 1968.
CONCRETE FOUNDATIONS AND SIDEWALKS;
MODERN CORRAL (41TR194)

This site is located in the northern portion of the project
area. Like the other W.W.II era localities, this one consists
of building debris in the form of brick, concrete, sewer pipe,
etc., along with some indication of domestic use (e.g., household ceramic, etc.). Identified on the 1951 Base Map (Figure 9) as (five) "Public Works Warehouses" (#'s 58-64),
these buildings are no longer present on the 1960 Army
training site Map (Figure 10).
Like many of the World War II era infrastructure, these
warehouses appear to have been systematically destroyed.
There is a wooden corral, however, that is still intact and

this rubble is actually in the drainage itself, presumably

CONCRETE, BRICK RUBBLE (41 TR195)

RUINED BRICK STRUCTURE (41TR196)

A small concrete pad that appears to mark the remains
of a single room brick structure is present at the comer of the
property that borders the Fort Worth/Decatur Road. There
is no structure present on this site on the 1951 base map
(Figure 9). There are two small structures present on the
1960 Eagle Mountain Army Air Field Map (Figure 10). They
are denoted as the "Former Main Gate House" (#35), and the
"Gas Meter House." Tailing away to the east of these concrete footings is a large amount of concrete and brick rubble
that extends to the western bank of the terminus of Moss
Branch, at the northeastern comer of the property. Much of

Located at the northeastern comer of the northern addition of the EML base, this brick structure is identified on
the 1951 Base Map (Figure 9) as the "Pump House" (#47).
This structure is not illustrated on the 1960 Army training
site Map (Figure 10), though it or a replacement building is
still standing today (Figure 22).
Constructed of red (hollow) brick on a concrete pad,
the building is rather small: 5.1 meters (N/S) by 3.5 meters
(E/W). Its roof, formerly composed of wood, is largely missing. It has three windows, and a large sliding doorway that
encompasses most of its south wall.

private hands, historically contained most of the Marine
Corps base's infrastructure, including its runways, hangers, and offices.
As for the historic sites and artifact scatters from the
pre-World War II era, only the Jefferson Cemetery is both
intact enough and historically significant enough to warrant National Register status and protection.
In regard to future work or potentiality of the EML
training site to provide insight into the prehistoric past,
clearly the minimally impacted agricultural terraces (or
"pastures") located in the southeastern portion of the training site hold potential for buried prehistoric cultural deposits. It is certainly within the realm of possibility that
Archaic or even Paleoindian cultural deposits arc contained
under the 2 to 5 meters of alluvial clays present in these
terraces, and believed to have been deposited in the late
Quaternary.

The historical and cultural value of the Eagle Mountain Lake base, as history, is great indeed. In its guise as a
Marine Corps Glider training base during wartime, it was
virtually unique within the Nation's efforts during World
War II. However, the historical and cultural value of the
Eagle Mountain Lake base, as a physical artifact, is very
limited, due primarily to two factors. First, the physical infrastructure related to the World War Two era glider base
and the base's other permutations over the years (in the
form of buildings and other elements on the landscape) has
been systematically and purposefully dismantled, razed, and
otherwise impacted, severely limiting what remains to add
to our knowledge of even the recent past. The second factor is that over half of the base has been sold in recent years
to private individuals, principally the television evangelist
Kenneth Copeland and the Eagle Mountain International
Church, Inc. The western portion of the EML base, now in
