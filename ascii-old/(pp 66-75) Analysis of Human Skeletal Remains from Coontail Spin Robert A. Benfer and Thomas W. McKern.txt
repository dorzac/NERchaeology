Analysis of Human Skeletal Remains
From Coontail Spin
ROBERT A. BENFER AND THOMAS W. MCKERN

ABSTRACT
Six adult skeletons and the remains of one fetus were excavated from
the Coontail Spin Rockshelter during salvage archeological excavations
at Amistad Reservoir in the fall of 1962. Five of the adult skeletons and
the fetus skeleton came from relatively late Archaic stratigraphic contexts (Nunley, et al. 1965: 8-12). Individual No. 2139 was unearthed
at some distance from the other four adult skeletons, but at approximately the same depth. Individual No. 2137, found on the surface,
cannot be assigned to a particular stage on archeological evidence. With
the above reservations, the skeletons of the six adult individuals are
considered as a sample of one population in the following description.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
In general, the preservation of skeletal material was quite good. The
individual found on the surface, No. 9,137,’ is represented by both
femora, tibiae, and innominates; the sacrum; right clavicle; and a
few vertebrae and ribs. This male was in his early twenties at time
of death. The fetus, No. 2142, lacks one fibula and radius. Individual
No. 9.189 (Burial No. 1) is a very complete skeleton of an approximately 9.3 year old female with practieally all the bones present, most
in excellent condition.
A male over 50 years of age, No. 2138 (Burial No. 2) is represented by a slcull, mandible, left humerus, right scapula fragments, a
right tibia, all five lumbar vertebrae, and both ealeanea and astragali,
fragments of the right humerus, right and left ulnae, right and left
fibulae, ribs and vertebrae. Another male over 50 years of age, No.
9.140 (Burial No. 3), is represented by a complete skull and mandible,
and fragments of a right and left femur and tibia. Right and left
humeri fragments, a left clavicle, four lumbar vertebrae, a complete
right astragalus, and fragments of the right caleaneum, scapula, rib,
vertebrae, and hand and foot bones were excavated with the previously
mentioned skull and thought to belong to that individual. In the lab,
however, it became obvious that the postcranial material represented
another individual, an adult female.
Skull fragments, a mandible, fragments of a right humerus, a manubrium, a right clavicle, and a few vertebrae and rib fragments represent individual No. 2141, a female(P) past 50 years of age. Because

of the paucity of material, this individual is not definitely identifiable
as to sex, but the material is more suggestive of female than of male.
The last individual, No. 2143, which is represented by a mandible and
a few skull fragments appears to be a male over 50 years old. In
addition to the seven individuals, a few foot bones, a sternum, and a
light patella fragment-all apparently adult-were not assignable to
any individual and are excluded from the analysis.
Age was estimated by using eritelia suggested by McKern and
Stewart (1957), while the sex identifications are based on criteria
from Montagu (1960). All measurements and observations correspond
to those defined by Montagn (1960) and Hrdlieka (1952). Post-cranial
indices were computed only when bones were present from the same
side of the skeleton.
ANTHROPOMETRIC DATA AND OBSERVATIONS
Measurements for the skeletal remains from the Coontail Spin Site
are presented in Table 1. The two individuals with measurable skulls,
No. 2140 and No. 2139, are both extremely long-headed with cranial
indices that fall in the hyperdolichocranic range. No. 2140, a male,
has cranial index of 66.8 and No. 2139, a female, has cranial index of
62.4. Individual No. 2138, a male, while not measurable, had a skull
complete enough also to suggest hyperdolichocrany.
Individual No. 2140 has a skull higher than it is wide. It has a
complete Inca bone, and small wormian bones occur in the lambdoid suture. Most of the maxillary and mandibular dentition were lost
during life. Only the maxillary first left molar and both canines were
present, and absorption of the alveoli was generally complete. Bony
response to musculature was noted as medium on the skull.
Individual No. 2139 is similar in most respects to the preceding
male. This 23 year old female also has a long, narrow, rather high
skull. Wormian bones were present in the lambdoid suture, but there
was no Inca bone. The metopie suture is visible only in the nasalglabella area. All the mandibular teeth had been lost during life, and
the alveoli were completely absorbed. The same condition was found
in the maxilla where the only remaining tooth was a first right molar
which was eroded down to the root. The musculature of this individtfal
was also noted as medium.
Individual No. 2138 is represented by a nonrestorable skull. This
male of 50 years or more had lost all of his mandibular and most of
his maxillmT teeth during life. A left canine, premolar, and first molar
were present in the incomplete maxilla. Of pathological interest is a
small indentation in the frontal bone, above the lateral edge of the

68

left supraorbital ridge. The depressed area is about 15 mm. in diameter and protrudes about 5 mm. into the interior of the skull. There is
no evidence of necrotic intrusion into the surrounding bone. This male
also had a very pronounced inion.
A complete mandible is all that represents individual No. 2143, a
male over 50 years of age. The teeth present show exeessive wear and
all the crowns are completely worn down to the alveolar borders. A
left ineisor and first and second molars were lost during life. An interesting feature of the mandible are the extremely large mental foramina.
Individual No. 2141, a female(P) over 50 years old, is represented
by only a few skull fragments. Portions of the maxilla and mandible
are present. From the nature of the alveoli, it appears that the incisors
and canines were lost shortly before death. The remaining alveoli
were completely absorbed.
The posteranial material tends to represent individuals of gracile
proportions with rather heavily muscled males and medium to heavily
muscled females. Individual No. 2138 demonstrated a healed fracture
of two carpal phalanges. The anterior borders of the lumbar vertebrae
all tended to be moderately lipped, both superiorly and inferiorly,
but this is hardly unusual considering the mature age of the individuals. The only other abnormality noted was a bony growth, possibly
an exostosis, on the inferior side of the right sternum of Individual
No. 2141; the manubrium was also involved.
Stature, as calculated by the Mongoloid formula of Trotter and
Cleser (1958: 111), is presented in Table 4. The two males, No. 2137
and No. 2138, are 5’5" and 5’4" respectively, while the female, No.
2139, is 5’6". They have been compared with males from the Langtry
Creek Burial Cave (Greer and Benfer 1963: 247, Table 4) whose
statures were 5’9" and 5’7" (measurements taken only from the tibia).
As is generally known, stature tends to decrease ~vith age, and the
disparity in height is probably explained by the age difference of the
two samples. The two Langtry Creek males were 33 and 30 years old
at time of death.
Comparative data from the Cuadalupe Mountains of southeastern
New Mexico (Mera 1938: 61-63) and Langtry Creek Burial Cave in
Val Verde County are presented in Tables 2 and 3. The general impression is that the three samples, within the bounds of normal variability, represent one population. However, more speeifie relationships
can be pointed out. Female No. 2140 from Coontail Spin compares
quite closely to the Guadalupe Mountain material. The skull is much
shorter and narrower than either the Langtry Creek individual or the

69

COONTAIL SPIN

two females from the Cuadalupe mountains. It is interesting to note
the rather large disparity in size between the smaller Coontail Spin
postcranial measurements and the larger Langh7 Creek individual.
Cultural evidence also points to more similarities than differences
among the three groups. The artifact assemblages of the two Val
Verde County sites and the sites from the Cuadalupe Mountains valT
only in minor details. The only significant cultural differences would
appear to be the occurrence of pottery in the New Mexico sites and
some differences in dm-t point morphology. Significant similarities are:
side-notched projectile points (dart points), similar cordage, similar
sandals, rabbit sticks (or fending sticks), and similar burial practices
(Mera 1938; Creer and Benfer 1963; Nunley et al. 1965). Therefore,
on the basis of cultural similarities, the sample from the Cuadalupe
Mountains, though coming from a variety of sites-i.e., mortuary eaves,
occupational shelters, middens, and midden circles ("sotol pits")would seem to date at approximately the same time (Late Archaic)
as the samples from Coontail Spin Rockshelter and Langtry Creek
Burial Cave. The Langtry Creek Burial Cave is dated as Late Archaic
by Creer and Benfer (1963: 9.48). This evidence eonfilTns the impression of similarity derived from the Late Archaic skeletal evidence from
West Texas and southeastern New Mexico.
CONCLUDINC STATEMENT
Six adults and one fetus from Coontail Spin Site have been described. The sample was found to compare quite closely with other
skeletal material from the Late Archaic Stage in Val Verde County
and southeastern New Mexico. Because of the small number of published reports describing skeletal matel~al, these conclusions must remain tentative. Further excavation and analysis of skeletal material
are highly desirable, if not absolutely necessary, before our knowledge
of the biological nature of prehistoric human populations from Texas
and surrounding areas can be expanded.
