ABSTRACT
In anticipation of development of the Cummins Creek Lignite Mine in Fayette
County, Texas, the Lower Colorado River Authority sponsored a broad cultural resource
program that included large area surveys, site testing, historical research, and the
preparation of a mine management plan, all accomplished by the Texas Archeological
Research Laboratory at The University of Texas at Austin. In January 1986, the decision
to abandon mining plans caused immediate cessation of all field work. A number of
interim documents reporting specific aspects of the cultural resource assessment were in
review and analyses of other site investigations were still in progress at that time. This
volume combines the results of the ongoing field work and analyses, and the previously
unpublished interim reports to conclude the publication series on the Cummins Creek
Mine.
Intensive survey of a proposed Overland Conveyor route produced four prehistoric
and five historic site recordings. One of the prehistoric sites, 41FY442, was tested and
three historic sites were further investigated by subsurface tests, archival research, and
informant interviews. Survey of a segment of the Winchester to Salem transmission line,
scheduled for rerouting, resulted in a recommendation for further work at known sites
41FY327 and 41FY336, and newly recorded 41FY457. Only 41FY336 had been tested
prior to the cessation of field work. The final small area survey along a proposed reroute
of county roads 112 and 114 in the hamlet of Waldeck resulted in Texas Historical
Commission mandated testing of four totally demolished historic structures: a gin, a
smithy, a school, and a house.
The testing of three historic sites in the Overland Conveyor Corridor, four in the
Waldeck community, and one isolated tenant house is reported in Section 3. None of
these sites merit National Register of Historic Places status as entities but all contribute
information about early lifeways in Fayette County. The bulk of the relevant data was
acquired through archival research and informant interviews; the contribution of subsurface testing was negligible except in the case of 41FY413, the tenant house.
Section 4 details the results of testing at four of the ten prehistoric sites that were
scheduled for field investigation in 1985-1986: 41FY264, 41FY336, 41FY362, and
41FY442. Additional data collection at 41FY362 was in progress when the project was
terminated, leaving the site only partially excavated. Testing of the other three was
completed and no further work was recommended. Although a mine management plan
is in place and a National Register of Historic Places District established for the Cummins
Creek mine, all work accomplished to date and all recommendations for further investigation will require reevaluation if and when mine development resumes.

PROJECT BACKGROUND
Steven M. Kotter

This, the fourth volume in a series describing cultural resource investigations in the
Lower Colorado River Authority's (LCRA) Cummins Creek Mine in northern Fayette
County, details the results of investigations at ancillary facilities carried out by the Texas
Archeological Research Laboratory, The University of Texas at Austin, during 1985 and
1986. Intensive survey was conducted along a 12.5-mile conveyor corridor connecting
the Cummins Creek Mine and the Fayette Power Plant, in sections of an alternate route
of the Winchester to Salem transmission line, and along planned reroutes of County
Roads 112 and 114 in the small community of Waldeck. Due to potential construction
conflicts, four prehistoric sites-41FY264, 41FY336, 41FY362, and 41FY442-were
tested. Archival research, oral history, and limited testing were conducted to determine
the National Register eligibility of eight historic sites-41FY400, 41FY418, 41FY419,
and 41FY446 in Waldeck; 41FY445, 41FY447, and 41FY448 in the conveyor corridor;
and 41FY413 in a proposed retention pond. Due to cessation of field work in January
1986, testing recommended for prehistoric sites 41FY245,41FY256,41FY257,41FY258,
41FY327, and 41FY457 was not initiated. Work was conducted under Texas Antiquities
Permit number 533, with Solveig A. Turpin serving as Principal Investigator. Ken Launius
and H.G. Wooldridge of the LCRA oversaw the work accomplished.
During April through October 1982, Phase I survey of 13,300 acres within the Cummins Creek Mine permit area (Fig. 1) identified 56 prehistoric and 34 historic site
components (Nightengale and Jackson 1983). The area included 6100 acres of the
primary mining zone and 7200 acres of buffer zone. Phase II survey (Nightengale,
Jackson, and Moncure 1985), accomplished between September and November 1983,
recorded an additional 77 prehistoric and 29 historic site components on nearly 8900
acres within an expanded study area. Seventeen of the 133 prehistoric sites were tested
between May and July 1984 to provide a preliminary assessment of information potential
(Nightengale n.d.).
Based on the results of survey and testing, in September 1985, the EPA obtained a
ruling that the identified cultural resources were eligible for nomination, as a district, to
the National Register of Historic Places. The resulting Fayette Power/Rabbs â Cummins
Creek Mine Historic District (Fig. 2) includes sites recorded during earlier investigations
at the Fayette Power Plant (Skelton 1977), currently known sites within the Cummins
Creek Mine study area, as well as cultural resources to be located during future investigations if mine operation is resumed. All prehistoric and historic properties which
currently comprise the district are listed in Tables 1 and 2.

Corps of Engineers and LCRA, was established to approve an appropriate Management
Plan and ensure its successful implementation. During a meeting held in December 1985,
the Committee, after a review of project history, work completed and contemplated,
regional and local research designs, and project scheduling and effects, authorized
additional archeological investigations. During Phase IV, survey of ancillary facilities and
improvements would be followed immediately by assessment testing and data collection.
Data collection at the primary significant sites within years 1 through 4 of the mining zone
would comprise Phase V. During Phase VI, other sites within this portion of the mining
zone and specific topographic features identified by a geomorphologist would be investigated if Phase V data was not sufficient to answer questions posed by the Research
Design.

Whenever possible, the LCRA avoided known cultural resources in planning the
locations of ancillary facilities. The Main Mine Facility and Erection Site were placed in
upland areas and completed without impact to significant sites except for 41FY398, the
Sternadel Farm, which was demolished. Not all sites could be avoided during proposed
construction of other facilities, which would have included an overburden stockpile, an
overburden conveyor, a main access road, a series of retention ponds, an overland
conveyor, and a transmission line reroute. A summary of the completed and scheduled
archeological investigations at affected sites, and those that are the subject of this report,
is provided in Table 3. Work ceased in January 1986 when plans to mine lignite at the
Cummins Creek Prospect were abandoned by the LCRA.

ENVIRONMENTAL AND CULTURAL SETTING

Steven M. Kotter, Bruce A. Nightengale, and Michael W. Davis
This section provides the environmental and cultural background necessary to understand the results of archeological investigations within the Cummins Creek Mine and
larger Historic District. A regional overview relates the project area to the major
physiographic zones of adjacent portions of Texas and briefly summarizes information
concerning defined cultural areas that generally follow these physiographic divisions. A
study area which subsumes local environmental variability and defines a number of local
environments is then outlined. Brief summaries of previous investigations in each of
these strata conclude the section. Historic background material has been presented
previously (Nightengale and Jackson 1983; Nightengale, Jackson, and Moncure 1985) and
will not be repeated here.
Regional Setting

The location of the Historic District relative to regional cultural areas and
physiographic zones of Texas is shown in Figures 3a, following Brown et al. (1982) and
3b, following Chambers (1948). Although boundaries have changed through time, cultural areas subsume the majority of variability within regional environments, where
differences in the composition and distribution of biotic and other resources have
resulted in differences in cultural adaptation and history. East Texas includes a variety
of wooded environments east of the Brazos River that crosscut physiographic zones.
Other cultural areas follow zone boundaries more closely, although Central Texas includes a portion of Blackland Prairie, as well as the Edwards Plateau. The Historic
District is within an area of cultural mixing where affiliations are both varied and poorly
defined. Portions of the Outer Coastal Plain and Post Oak Belt are also transitional in
the sense that the ranges of primarily eastern and western biotic species overlap.
OUTER COASTAL PLAIN

The Outer Coastal Plain, which includes the study area, consists of dissected portions
of the Gulf Coastal Plain and the Post Oak Belt where terrain is gently rolling to hilly.
Exposed geologic strata are primarily Cenozoic sandstones and gravelly clays. Surface
soils are mostly sandy, and subsoils are clayey. Abundant water resources are provided
by surface streams and the Gulf Coast Aquifer, which includes the Catahoula and
Oakville formations (Brune 1975). Lithic resources are also abundant, although of highly
variable quality. Pleistocene gravels are generally larger and more easily worked than
geologic gravels, the majority of which are only marginally useful for tool manufacture.

Present vegetation consists of Post Oak Savannah (Gould 1975:3), composed of post
oak, blackjack oak and hickory, and an understory of little bluestem, indiangrass,
switchgrass, purple top, and long-spike silver bluestem. This savannah extends from the
Texas-Oklahoma border to Bexar and Wilson counties in south-central Texas, between
the Piney Woods of East Texas, the Gulf Prairie along the coast, and the Blackland Prairie
to the northwest. Mixed hardwood forest parallels perennial streams.
Common mammals (Blair 1950:101) are more similar to the eastern woodland than
the western grassland populations, and include the opossum, least shrew, badger, fox,
striped skunk, ringtail, raccoon, coyote, bobcat, cottontail rabbit, fox squirrel, plains
pocket gopher, various mice and rats and whitetail deer (Davis 1978). Prehistoric
exploitation of bison and freshwater mussels was documented at the Cedar Bridge Site,
41FY74 (Skelton 1977). Evidence from excavations in Austin County (Lord 1981:422423) indicates consumption of a wide variety of mammal, fish, and bird species, many still
living in the region.
Past researchers have generally considered the study area part of a transitional zone
most closely aligned with Central Texas and, occupied continuously since at least late
Paleoindian times. A cultural chronology for the Outer Coastal Plain, based on Hall's
(1981) data from Aliens Creek, is presented in Table 4. In his report on the Fayette Power
Project investigations, Skelton (1977) presented evidence for eastern and coastal in-

fluence, supporting a tricultural hypothesis. He suggested that groups from different
areas may have exploited the abundant chert cobbles in upland areas along Cedar Creek,
and largely endorsed the diffusion of stylistic ideas from adjacent cultural areas (Skelton
1977:118).
Hall (1981) also noted variability in cultural traits at sites overlooking the Brazos
River floodplain in Austin County. Artifact assemblages suggest influences from Central,
Coastal, and East Texas, and further northeast. Through analyses of burial remains and
occupational debris, Hall (1981:308) hypothesized that an eastern-influenced, importexport sphere flourished during the Late Archaic Period. Prewitt (1982:218) presented
further evidence for either direct contact or extensive trade with the coast at the LoeveFox Site (41WM230) between 2600 and 2250 years B.P. Conch bead manufacturing
technology observed at the site favors the trade hypothesis.
Central to the question of the cultural affiliation of Fayette County is the presence or
absence of distinct groups adapted to the Outer Coastal Plain. Early research concentrated on differences in artifact assemblages and tool morphology, and side-stepped
the issue of an integrated local adaptation, although Skelton (1977:123) did not rule out
this possibility. Fullem (1977) examined dart point types recovered from the Black
Hopper Site (41FY25), located on Cedar Creek just above the valley floor of the
Colorado River. Projectile points from the Black Hopper Site are morphologically
distinct from such classic types as Bulverde, Wells, and Godley. Fullem suggested that
the variation is best explained by exchange among adjacent cultural areas. Based on
excavations in Bastrop and Fayette counties, Goode (1984a,b) suggested that at various
times during prehistory, indigenous populations developed local traditions, similar but
not identical to those of neighboring cultural areas. Analysis of projectile points indicated that local identity may have been achieved as early as the Early Archaic, and
definitely by the Middle Archaic Period.
CENTRAL TEXAS

Grasslands extend beyond the margins of the High and Low Plains of north Texas,
onto the Edwards Plateau and adjacent Blackland Prairie. The upland plateau is generally flat, but local stream dissection can be considerable. Cretaceous limestones underlie
thin, clayey upland soils. Juniper/oak woodlands grow in upland grasslands and dominate
slopes while loamy soils along streams support mixed hardwoods. The fauna have a
primarily western character. Water and workable lithic materials are locally abundant.
The Blackland Prairie with its deep clayey soils is undissected grassland below the
Balcones Escarpment. Resources are concentrated in broad stream valleys.
The most recent cultural sequence proposed for Central Texas (Prewitt 1981:65-89)
divides the 10,000 year prehistory into five periods, four of which are further divided into
phases (Table 5). Paleoindian remains include Clovis, Folsom, and Plainview projectile
points generally associated with hunting of now-extinct megafauna. Later point types
with Paleoindian attributes, such as lanceolate shape and basal grinding, are included
within the initial phases of the Early Archaic Period, since they are associated with
indications of a wider subsistence base.

During the Early Archaic Period, the transition from a hunting adaptation to a mixed
hunting and gathering economy was made. A variety of stemmed dart points, such as
Gower, Hoxie, Wells, Bell, and Martindale evolved, and the increased importance of food
grinding and mussel consumption is noted.
The majority of known components are in upland areas, and reliance on upland
resources may have carried over from the preceding Paleoindian Period. In the last phase
of the Early Archaic, burned rock middens first appear, associated with triangular dart
points, Baird and Taylor.
The Middle Archaic period is characterized by the proliferation of burned rock
middens and dart point types Nolan, Travis, Bulverde and Pedernales. Middens are a
type of specialized cooking oven, and a heavy reliance on plant foods, possibly of a single
source, is indicated. However, hunting continues to be of importance. Both upland and
stream environments were utilized.
During the Late Archaic Period, use of middens rapidly declines and bison reappear
after an absence during the Middle Archaic Period. Subsistence is even more dependent
on plant resources, and probably more varied. Increased use of riverine resources,
especially when compared to Early Archaic remains, is indicated. Characteristic artifacts
include Marcos, Montell, Castroville, Frio, and Fairland type dart points and a variety of
other distinctive bifacial tools.

18 / INTRODUCTION

The Late Prehistoric or Neo-Archaic Period is marked by the appearance of the bow
and arrow and, during the Toyah phase, by ceramics. Arrow point types, Scallorn and
Granbury during the Austin phase, and Perdiz and Cliffton for the Toyah phase, are widely
distributed outside Central Texas. Current evidence suggests the latter phase may represent intrusive Plains groups following migrating buffalo. During the Late Prehistoric,
hunting increases in importance.
EAST TEXAS

East Texas marks the eastern extent of pine forests which cover inland portions of the
southeastern United States. Wetter areas support mixed hardwoods. Cenozoic sands and
gravelly clays underlie predominantly sandy surface soils. The terrain is hilly and the
fauna consists primarily of eastern species. Water is abundant, but lithic materials are
generally small in size and poor in quality.
The evidence for the presence of early groups in East Texas is generally confined to
the recovery of single or small groups of fluted or lanceolate projectile points during
excavation of sites with later components, or their presence in the collections of local
surface collectors. Story (1965:240) reported a Folsom point and an Eden point in the
lower levels at the Wild Bull Site (41HE61) in Henderson County. Testing and mitigation
at Lake Limestone along the Upper Navasota River produced limited numbers of
Plainview, Angostura, and Folsom points (Prewitt 1975; Prewitt and Mallouf 1977;
Mallouf 1979). Excavations in Leon and Freestone counties yielded a Golondrina and
two San Patrice points (Espey, Huston and Associates, Inc. 1982) from an area where
surface collections contain examples of Plainview, Golondrina, Scottsbluff, Angostura,
Meserve, Gower, and San Patrice points. Actual dating of these Early Man manifestations, or statements on their lifeways in East Texas, remain unresolved questions.
The preliminary descriptive statement on the East Texas Archaic Period was
presented by Suhm, Krieger, and Jelks (1954). Story (1976:46) acknowledged that the
definition was "skimpy and generalized", using as a primary criteria the presence of dart
points and absence of ceramics. The major dart point types affiliated with the East Texas
Archaic were Gary, Ellis, Yarbrough, Kent, and Wells. The time period represented was
3000 B.C. to A.D. 500 or 1000. Webb (1958) expanded on the previous outline and
broadened the artifact assemblage to include:
. . . pitted stones; hammerstones; hand-sized manos; milling stones with
shallow oval basins; full-grooved axes of sandstone, quartzite, or hematite;
fist-axes; drills; large and small end scrapers; end scrapers made by
reworking projectile points ("bunts"); small side scrapers. (Webb 1958:48)
Also noted was an apparent Paleoindian-Archaic overlap manifested by the presence of
Meserve and San Patrice points in Archaic context.
Johnson (1962) presented a more comprehensive definition of the Archaic of East
Texas when he proposed the La Harpe Aspect. His analysis included sites located in a
band running from near Houston north to Oklahoma at the fringe of the eastern woodlands. The aspect is characterized by:

ENVIRONMENTAL AND CULTURAL SETTING I 19

(1) flexed burials, usually without accompanying furniture; (2) pitted
manos; (3) expanding stem dart points (early phase); (4) contracting stem
dart points (later phase); (5) plain ceramics (terminal La Harpe Aspect);
and (6) various polished and ground stone artifacts (axes, gorgets, etc.)
which vary considerably in style and abundance from locality to locality
within the La Harpe Aspect. (Johnson 1962:249)
The Late Prehistoric Period in East Texas is characterized by cultural groups (Caddo
Indians and their ancestors) who constructed raised earth platforms or mounds, manufactured a wide variety of pottery and practiced horticulture as a main stem of their
subsistence (Davis 1970). Two sequential aspectsâ Gibson and Fultonâand five periods
have been defined covering the period from approximately A.D. 500 through and beyond
contact with European cultures.
The initial Caddo I phase is known primarily from the type site, the George C. Davis
Site in Cherokee County, Texas. Artifact types diagnostic of the period include Holly,
Hickory Fine Engraved, Davis and Weches Fingernail-Impressed ceramics and Alba
arrow points. Mound building and reliance on agriculture became pronounced during
later Caddo II times (Richner and Lee 1976). Diagnostic pottery types include Sanders
Plain and Engraved, and Monkstown Fingernail Punctated; arrow point types include
Bonham and Perdiz. The Caddo III manifestations identified in Texas, dated by radiocarbon assays to the fifteenth century, consist of single or groups of small mounds on which
structures were erected. Temporal markers are Ripley and Taylor Engraved, Maydelle
Incised and Bullard Brushed ceramics and Perdiz arrow points. Several sites of this phase
were investigated during the construction of Lake O' the Pines (Davis 1958; Jelks and
Tunnell 1959). During Caddo IV times, sites are smaller and mound building apparently
diminished in importance. Maud, Bassett, and Talco arrow points represent the lithic
diagnostics, while ceramics are Killough and Bullard Brushed, and Poyner Engraved.
Caddo V is the historic era of the Caddo Indians, marked by the presence of European
trade goods. Triangular arrow points become prominent.
Recent investigations along the Brazos River in Austin County (Hall 1981) provide a
more refined cultural sequence pertinent to the study area (Table 4). The Late Archaic
Period, including the time of the hypothesized eastern inland interaction sphere, is
characterized by both East and Central Texas dart point types. Following the breakdown
of the sphere, East Texas traits predominate until the appearance of Perdiz arrow points.
Comparison with the Central Texas chronology shows time lag between this area and
Aliens Creek, which is located within the defined transitional zone. Models presented
by Hall (1981) provide a framework essential to an understanding of prehistory within
the study area.
UPPER COAST

Below the dissected Outer Coastal Plain is a flat coastal prairie composed of Pleistocene age clays. Clayey soils support short grasses; mixed hardwoods grow along major
streams. Compared with more inland areas, the Coastal Prairie is resource poor. The
number of habitats are fewer and biomass is less. In contrast, the coastal littoral repre-

20 / INTRODUCTION

sents a concentration of food resources. Abundant shell fish and other species, available
to prehistoric groups, thrive in bay and stream environments. However, lithic resources
are absent from near coastal areas. Water is limited primarily to surface sources, but
scattered springs flow along the coast.
The presence of Late Paleoindian and Early Archaic occupations has been
demonstrated for both Coastal Prairie (Wheat 1953) and littoral zones (Aten 1979). Late
Paleoindian projectile points are similar to Plainview, Angostura and Scottsbluff types
(Patterson 1979) which have a widespread, mostly grassland distribution. However, by
terminal Paleoindian and Early Archaic times, an eastern forest association may be
indicated by the presence of San Patrice and Wells point types. Eastern affiliation of the
Coastal Prairie continues through the Middle Archaic Period when Carrollton, Trinity
and Williams type points are common. Middle Archaic remains are absent from the
coastal littoral. There is no evidence prior to the Late Archaic Period of intensive use
of littoral resources. Data indicate inland groups explored the possibilities of the coastal
environment. Early and Middle Archaic periods may have been drier (Hall 1981) than
either preceding or succeeding periods. Antelope inhabited the Coastal Prairie (Wheat
1953) and widespread erosion is indicated (Kotter and Fields 1983).
The following Late Archaic Period was wetter and apparently marked by an increase
in population. An initial pre-ceramic phase is characterized by Gary and other dart
points with a widespread eastern distribution. Groups from the Brazos River were
participating in an inland trade network at this time, but the absence of extensive shell
ornament manufacturing may indicate near-coastal areas were less involved. Although
littoral subsistence patterns developed during the pre-ceramic phase, distinct coastal
groups were not present, at least along the Trinity River (Dillehay 1975).
Ceramics were introduced near the beginning of this millennium through the apparent movement of coastal groups from Louisiana into the Sabine and Trinity river
valleys (Aten 1979). The ceramic Archaic phase, which shares many traits with the
Tchefuncte phase of the Lower Mississippi Valley cultural area, is the earliest phase of
Aten's Galveston Bay cultural sequence (Table 6). Clear Fork phase sites occur within
the Coastal Prairie (Wheat 1953) and abundant lithic remains may indicate use of the
Outer Coastal Plain. An eastern-affiliated cultural history continues to characterize the
Upper Coast until the late appearance of groups with Perdiz arrow points.
COASTAL BEND AND SOUTH TEXAS

The Colorado River drains the eastern edge of the Coastal Bend, where the
distribution of environments is similar to the Upper Coast. Further south, nearer the
Nueces River, inland prairies and woodlands are gradually replaced by a scrub savannah
(Arbingast et al. 1973) that supports extensive stands of prickly pear. The majority of
inland resources, however, are less abundant and more dispersed. Bay environments,
where littoral resources are concentrated, are more numerous, and differences between
the resource bases of coastal and inland areas are more pronounced.
Although the prehistory of the Colorado River Basin has more in common with the
Upper Coast than does the Nueces River, in general the Coastal Bend is more closely

affiliated with the Lower Coast and South Texas. Cultural history is not well defined, but
of primary importance is the documentation of coastal groups only during the Transitional
Archaic and Late Prehistoric periods (McGuff 1978). Prior to that time, coastal resources formed only a part of an adaptation relying on inland stream resources. Artifacts
similar to types found in Central, South and East Texas are found, but there is significant
variation. The absence of lithic resources and the availability of other materials apparently influenced the composition of site assemblages. Widespread arrow point types,
Scallorn and then Perdiz, appear only after A.D. 1100 (Story 1968).
Of particular importance to an understanding of Fayette County prehistory is the
distinctive unifacial tool technology, including use of both flakes and split cobbles, that
characterizes the Nueces River Basin. Influenced equally by South and Central Texas,
prehistoric groups developed a unique adaptation to their environment, which required
considerable movement and an expedient tool kit (Nightengale n.d.). Recent investigations at Choke Canyon Reservoir (Hall, Hester, and Black 1986) documented relatively
intensive occupations beginning during the Middle Archaic period and culminating in
the Late Archaic Period, a trend noted in other cultural areas of Texas.

22 / INTRODUCTION

Area Setting

Creation of the Historic District expanded the scope of both known sites and distinct
environments, from the upland mine setting to include a major river slope drainage,
Cedar Creek, as well as the varied environments crossed by the Overland Conveyor. In
order to accommodate this variability, a study area consisting of a portion of the Colorado
River watershed in Fayette and Colorado counties was proposed (Fig. 1). The southern
boundary of the area is formed by 40 linear km of river between the confluences of two
left-bank tributaries. The larger of the two, Cummins Creek, comprises the eastern and
most of the northern boundaries. Rabbs Creek flows at the western edge of the study
area. In an area between these tributaries, and below the river valley margin, a series of
slope drainages flow directly to the river. North and east of the study area are watersheds
of the Brazos and San Bernard river systems. The right half of the Colorado River
watershed is south of the area.
The study area is divided into six major microenvironments on the basis of stream
rank and location within the stream profile. The entire river valley floor (including
tributary confluences) and lower valley walls comprise the river terrace stratum. The
upper portion of valley walls, or divides between slope drainages, is defined as river
upland. Slope drainages are separated from other tributaries with more fully developed
watersheds. The headwaters of river tributaries are defined as creek upland and lower
courses as creek terrace. Areas above primary stream downcutting comprise the upland
summit stratum.
UPLAND SUMMIT

The Cummins Creek Mine includes an extensive portion of the upland summit that
separates Cummins and Rabbs creeks where, except for chert and petrified wood gravels,
resources are sparse and dispersed. Investigations documented sporadic use of
landforms distant from water and ephemeral upland streams in contrast to more intensive
use of the creek upland environment.
CREEK UPLAND

The majority of the prehistoric sites within the Historic District are along the upland
portion of two dissimilar river tributaries, Cummins and Rabbs creeks. Cummins Creek
drains a linear basin oriented northwest to southeast that is 62 km in length and 13 km
in maximum width. The mine is below the headwaters within the defined creek upland
environment where the valley is broad and open. Low-flow lateral tributaries augment
the creek seasonally, but no springs or areas of potential impoundment were observed.
Lithic resources, however, are abundant and varied. The Rabbs Creek watershed is
L-shaped and approximately 43.5 km (27 miles) long. From its headwaters, the creek
flows southeast to the river valley margin, then due south. Tributaries within the study
area drain the area above the southward creek bend, which is only about 14.5 km (9 miles)
from the river. Intensive prehistoric use of this area, documented during survey and
described in following sections, indicates that Rabbs Creek is an area of diverse resource

ENVIRONMENTAL AND CULTURAL SETTING I 23

concentration. Spring water, and therefore game, are abundant. Lithic resources are
scattered, but consist of fine-quality petrified wood.
Survey and limited testing within the Cummins Creek Mine provide significant data
concerning creek upland history and settlement (Nightengale and Jackson 1983; Nightengale, Jackson, and Moncure 1985). Noted differences in environments represented by
Cummins and Rabbs creeks are reflected by differences in the nature and distribution of
sites. The majority of Cummins Creek occupations are concentrated near the creek
proper, with only scattered sites along tributary streams. Only two early site components
were located. In contrast, the tributaries of Rabbs Creek were intensively occupied,
beginning at least during the Early Archaic Period. A pronounced stream orientation is
indicated for both zones. Topographically, the favored camp location along Rabbs Creek
was between the crest of an interfluvial divide and creek bank, sheltered by the hill rising
behind. The Cummins Creek valley is more open.
Testing of 15 sites within the Rabbs Creek Basin demonstrated a consistent pattern
of recurring occupation at the same locale over a long period of time. The presence of
hearths at most sites, many of them still stratigraphically sequenced by rapid colluvial
burial, indicate the basically domestic nature of occupations. Sites may be extensive, but
tools are relatively few in number. Lithic procurement and initial reduction may be an
emphasis of upland occupations. Analysis of tool diversity indicates uniformity among
sites, with between four and six types noted, principally projectile points, generalized
bifaces and utilized flakes, and occasionally gouges, unifaces and ceramics.
The majority of distinctive tools are similar to Central Texas types, especially before
and during the Middle Archaic Period. An apparent increase in the number of occupations during the Late Archaic Period mirrors increasing population density in adjacent
areas (Weir 1976; Hall 1981; Goode 1984a). Central Texas influence is less, and interaction with East Texas is more intensive. The Late Prehistoric Period is more
homogeneous, although sites with Scallorn points with and without sandy paste ceramics
occur. Perdiz points were noted in area collections but have not been recovered during
investigations at Cummins Creek. A high degree of variation from established projectile
point types of other cultural areas suggests the presence of indigenous populations during
portions of the Middle and Late Archaic periods.
A number of hypotheses were generated during survey and testing phases to account
for the observed cultural variability (Nightengale and Jackson 1983:29-29; Nightengale,
Jackson, and Moncure 1985:31-32). The first two hypotheses which provide a model to
explain apparent differences in both resource base and cultural history between the
Rabbs and Cummins Creek basins were demonstrated at least in basic outline. Cummins
Creek sites were seen as primarily short-term extractive camps used when the stream was
flowing and oriented toward the acquisition of raw materials for lithic tool production.
Within the Rabbs Creek Basin, where water was more abundant and reliable, sites were
repeatedly occupied for more extended periods of time and were used for habitation or
non-specialized activity. Differences in settlement were constant throughout prehistory.
The third hypothesis concerns the place of the study area within regional cultural
history, and seeks to confirm the presence of a cultural transition zone influenced by East,

24 /

INTRODUCTION

Central and Coastal Texas cultures. Results confirm the complexity of interaction at the
boundary of these major cultural areas, expanding the sphere of influence to include the
Coastal Bend and South Texas. Additional investigations are necessary to understand the
complexity of group development, movement, and adaptation within the Historic District.
CREEK TERRACE

This stratum separates the lower portion of each creek; natural processes and resources are similar to the river, in contrast to areas near the headwaters which have a distinct
resource array. Although investigations have been extremely limited, settlement of creek
terraces is also expected to be similar to, but less intensive than, that described for river
terraces in the following section. Investigations along the Overland Conveyor where the
corridor crosses Clear Creek, an intermittent tributary of Cummins Creek, identified two
sites, a small lithic scatter and an extensive extractive site (41FY442).
RIVER TERRACE

A number of distinct environments near the river have been defined through investigations at Shaw's Bend Reservoir (Keller and Campbell 1984) and in Bastrop County
(Robinson 1987). River meandering has differentiated areas of the modern floodplain
and created several terrace levels. Bar gravels, hardwood tree species, and a developed
aquatic community provided an abundant resource base concentrated at the tributary
confluences. The resource array of the margins of the valley floor and lower slopes is
more restricted, consisting primarily of lithic gravels.
At Shaw's Bend, along the Colorado River between La Grange and Columbus, data
from 89 prehistoric sites were used to describe the locations of kinds of sites. Habitation
sites are widely distributed, but are more numerous along creek and high river terraces.
Quarries are predominantly upland and absent from the river floodplain. The majority
of sites investigated are defined as special activity sites, which vary in size and materials
present. Special activity sites occur in all strata, but increase in number with distance
from the river. These types of sites suggest a generalized hunting and gathering adaptation throughout the span of occupation. Diagnostic artifacts were few in number and
discussion of changes in settlement limited. However, Late Paleoindian sites tend to be
located in upland areas above steeply sloping valley walls. Little evidence of coastal or
eastern influence was obtained.
A recent study of prehistoric sites in Bastrop County that included analysis of both
previously and newly identified sites (Robinson 1987) provides significant comparative
data from along the Colorado River. Robinson (1987:133-137) finds a pronounced
concentration of biotic remains at sites on river terraces, significant even if better organic
preservation is disregarded. There is evidence of both an emphasis on river terrace
occupation throughout the Archaic Period, culminating in the Late Archaic Period, and
an increase in mean site size to a Late Archaic maximum. During the following Late
Prehistoric Period, sites were smaller, more dispersed, and were environmentally in-

ENVIRONMENTAL AND CULTURAL SETTING I 25

elusive. Analysis of stage bifaces found that initial stage failures are more prevalent in
upland areas while final stage failures are more abundant at river terrace sites.
Robinson notes that these results suggest a pattern discernible within the Central
Texas region especially during the Late Archaic and Late Prehistoric periods. River
terraces were the focal point of the yearly round following the Late Archaic model, with
base camps occupied continuously about six months or more, including winter. At other
times of the year, late spring and summer, smaller groups moved away from the river and
performed a number of specialized economic tasks. High population density and optimum environmental conditions characterize the end of the Archaic period.
During the Late Prehistoric Period, population decreased during a drying trend
culminating in the present climate. A shift to smaller group size and corresponding site
size occurred and the number of environments exploited increased. Large base camps
were replaced by primary dry season habitations near reliable water and smaller dispersed camps during seasonal rains. The model, which implies that resources are more
or less equally distributed, would result in little artifactual variability.
RIVER UPLAND

Investigations within the River Upland stratum are limited to the upper valley walls
of Cedar Creek (Fayette Power Project) and the divide between this and Baylor creeks
(Cummins Creek Overland Conveyor). Except for lithic gravels, available resources,
especially water, are more limited than others near river environments. This fact is
reflected by the results of investigations, which found no evidence of prehistoric use.
Upland areas near the river may have been part of an extensive gathering strategy, but
apparently not activities that left identifiable remains.
SLOPE DRAINAGES

Slope drainages of the Colorado River within the study area include Cedar Creek, the
subject of investigations by Skelton (1977) during the Fayette Power Project. The
headwaters of the creek are at the valley margin about 4.8 km (3 miles) north of the river.
Abundant lithic and biotic resources are available, but water is limited to local impoundments. The 17 prehistoric sites within the 2400-acre project were concentrated at
confluences of branches, a setting comparable to creek headwaters. Skelton noted a high
degree of similarity in site assemblages throughout the approximately 7000 years of
occupation. Although stylistic variations occur, basic types of artifacts and debitage
remain consistent. Tool manufacturing and hunting subsistence predominated at all sites,
but varied in intensity and duration. Use of the area for upland work camps, characterized by specific extractive tools, increased during Late Prehistoric times. Skelton
suggested groups from other areas may have been attracted to upland gravel sources.

CULTURAL RESOURCE SURVEYS

INTRODUCTION TO THE SURVEYS

This section of the report summarizes the results of three surveys of areas to be
affected by the construction of ancillary mine facilities. The most extensive survey,
carried out during February and June 1985, covered 12.15 miles (19.6 km) of 150-footwide corridor, right-of-way for an overland conveyor that would transport lignite from
the Cummins Creek Mine to the existing Fayette Power Project in eastern Fayette County.
A 65-foot (19.5 meters) right-of-way was leased for construction as well as basic operation
and maintenance of the conveyor, which was designed to be covered and elevated 5 feet
(1.5 meters) above the ground surface by supporting rods. Construction would affect
cultural resources located along the right-of-way in several ways: 1) surface and subsurface damage from bulldozing sections of the line for clearing purposes; 2) surface damage
from heavy equipment transporting conveyor parts; and 3) subsurface damage from
mounting the conveyor on supporting rods.
A second, less extensive survey of a proposed reroute of the existing Winchester to
Salem transmission line was completed during October 1986. The line currently crosses
the project area from southeast to northwest, traversing the planned mining zone.
Although the major portion of the 100-foot wide right-of-way had been previously
surveyed, approximately 0.75 miles (1.2 km) crosses land where access had been denied.
Outside of the Permit Area, upgrading of the current line will not adversely affect cultural
resources. Impact within the permit area was anticipated: 1) clearing of vegetation from
within the right-of-way; 2) movement of vehicles and equipment; and 3) placement of
towers supporting the lines.
The third survey, conducted on January 30 and May 13, 1985, was of lands to be
affected by the extension of County Road 112, upgrading its surface to meet farm-tomarket standards, and modifications to the intersection of County Roads 112 and 114.
Cultural resources buried beneath the road will not be further disturbed, but construction
of new roadway and excavation of runoff ditches extended to land where access was
denied during previous surveys.
Each of the surveys was designed to conform to the Texas Historical Commission
guidelines for intensive survey and to comply with provisions of the National Historic
Preservation Act of 1966 and its implementing regulations 36CFR800. The objectives of
the survey were:
1.

to locate and record prehistoric and historic cultural resources;

2.

to determine the relative significance of these resources;

3.

to recommend additional work if necessary for assessment, beyond the survey level; and

4.

to recommend mitigative measures for significant sites which would be adversely affected by proposed construction.

THE OVERLAND CONVEYOR CORRIDOR
Steven M. Kotter, Henry B. Moncure and William A. Cloud
The 12.15-mile-long conveyor corridor which crosses a number of distinct environments from near river to the upland mine is divided into six descriptive segments (Fig.
4), which subsume major variability. In addition, segments separate disturbed areas near
the Fayette Power Plant (Segment A) and previously investigated areas (Segment F) from
remaining portions of the corridor. Segments are described from south to north, that is,
beginning at the end nearest the Colorado River. Tables 7, concerning topographic
setting, and 8, concerning current land use, summarize data used to characterize segments
and assess both site potential and archeological visibility.
Descriptions of Corridor Segments
SEGMENT A

This segment includes the 0.85 miles (1.4 km) of proposed corridor disturbed by
construction of the Fayette Power Plant. Approximately half of the total length is within
the plant compound, while remaining portions cross the retaining wall of the spillway.
The area is underlain by Willis Formation gravels and covered by sandy soils of the Vernia
Association. Vegetation is either absent or consists of introduced grasses.
SEGMENT B

Segment B includes land north of the power plant to State Highway 159. The
2.02-mile (3.25 km) long corridor follows the upland divide between Baylor and Cedar
creeks, slope tributaries to the river. The segment runs along the western edge of Cypress
Creek Reservoir, where Oakville Formation strata have developed clayey soils of the
Heiden-Crockett Association. Over 80% of the land crossed is improved pasture. Small
areas of fields and woods are at the northern end of the segment near Park, Texas.
Portions of the corridor below 390 feet MSL had been previously surveyed (Skelton
1977), but no sites were recorded. An existing power line and access road, which were
apparently not investigated prior to placement, parallel the corridor. Clearing of woody
vegetation, construction and minor erosion provide fair to good archeological visibility.
The head of a Baylor Creek tributary (located between 600 + 00 and 65 + 00) is the only
area judged to have a high site potential. Erosion has exposed subsurface deposits at the
margins of sandy rises on either side of this canyon head.

FIGURE 4. Route of Cummins Creek Overland Conveyor and Historic Microregions.
SEGMENT C
This corridor segment, between State Highways 159 and 237, crosses Clear Creek, a
perennial right-hand tributary of Cummins Creek. Over half of the 2.24-mile (3.6 km)
long corridor traverses uplands, above the developed river valley. Creek terraces and
lower slopes above the stream floor comprise nearly 40% of the segment length; remaining areas are disturbed highway right-of-way. Heiden-Crockett soils overlie Oakville
Formation strata. Nearly 80% of the land has been modified, approximately 50% for
pasture and 30% for crops.
Segment C had not been previously surveyed. Archeological visibility varied between
fair in woods and pasture land and good to excellent in fields. Portions of the corridor
with high site potential are limited to Clear Creek, where erosion and exposed stream
banks provided good visibility.

34 / CULTURAL RESOURCE SURVEYS

SEGMENT D

Segment D includes 3.56 miles (6.7 km) of corridor from State Highway 237 north to
FM 1291. The route follows the divide between two intermittent tributaries of Clear
Creek, Spencers Pool Creek, and an unnamed tributary. The entire segment length,
which is defined as upland, has been modified, over 40% for crop production. Oakville
geologic strata are overlain by clayey soils of the Heiden-Crockett Association.
The segment had not been previously surveyed. Although archeological visibility in
pasture land was only fair, fields provided large areas of good to excellent visibility. The
corridor also crosses eight stock ponds where samples of the entire soil profile were
visible. Ponds are generally located at the upland ends of stream tributaries where site
potential is greatest.
SEGMENT E

This segment includes 1.24 miles (2.0 km) of corridor between FM 1291 and the
Cummins Creek Lignite Prospect. The corridor first parallels and then crosses Hellers
Branch of Shaw Creek, a major right hand tributary of Cummins Creek. Areas adjacent
to the creek comprise 13% of the total length, with remaining portions defined as upland.
Clayey soils of the Vernia Association have developed over the strata of the Oakville
Formation. Pleistocene gravels occur at the northern end of the segment. Approximately
50% of the corridor is pasture land, with subequal amounts of both woods and fields.
Segment E had not been previously surveyed. Areas of good archeological visibility
were limited to fields. Visibility along other portions of the corridor was fair. Only the
crossing of Hellers Branch has high site potential.
SEGMENT F

Segment F includes the northern end of the corridor within the Cummins Creek
Lignite Prospect. The 2.23-mile (3.6 km) long segment crosses three branches of the
Shaw Creek headwaters, Hellers Branch, Albers Branch and the creek proper. Upland
slopes and areas adjacent to the creeks are equally well represented. Surficially exposed
Catahoula geologic strata are covered by sandy soils of the Tabor-Axtell Association.
Pleistocene gravels are exposed at the northern end of the segment. Fields comprise 40%
of the corridor length, with lesser but still significant areas of pasture land and woods.
The entire length of Segment F had been previously surveyed (Nightengale, Jackson,
and Moncure 1985), and was not resurveyed during the current project. No sites were
recorded within the corridor right-of-way.
Methods
A predictive model of high site probability areas between the lignite prospect and the
power plant, formulated by David G. Robinson, was provided to the LCRA as a planning
tool before the conveyor route was established. The model is based on Fayette County

THE OVERLAND CONVEYOR CORRIDOR I 35

site data and predicted a high correlation between upland fluvial terraces and prehistoric
cultural manifestations. The terraces of Clear Creek and its tributaries are thought to be
the areas of highest site probability, with a lesser probability along intermittent streams.
Exposures of Pleistocene gravels also represent areas of high site probability. Upland
areas are felt to have a low site potential.
Aerial photographs (scale 1" = 100') of the proposed corridor were provided by the
LCRA. Surveyed distances from the southern end of the line were used to compute the
dimensions of corridor segments.
The project area is conveniently cut by several roads which served as starting points
for transects. Surveyors walked either edge of the conveyor right-of-way out, then
returned on either side of the centerline, covering the 65-foot corridor with four serpentine transects. Located sites were recorded on State of Texas Archeological Site Data
forms, mapped, plotted on 1" = 100' blueline aerial project maps and USGS 7.5'
topographic quadrangle maps, and photographed. A daily journal was kept summarizing
survey methods and results. Sites were assigned numbers in the trinomial system, i.e.,
41 = Texas, FY = Fayette County, 441 = the four hundred forty-first site recorded within
the county.
Shovel tests were used primarily to establish the presence or absence of buried
cultural materials at located sites. Testing was limited to the actual corridor right-of-way,
and could not be used effectively to establish the areal extent of some sites. All tests are
30 by 30 cm in size and were dug in 20 cm arbitrary levels. Matrix was screened through
V4-inch mesh hardware cloth. Each test was plotted using a bearing and paced distance
from a relocatable datum. Historic sites and the prehistoric site 41FY443, situated on
an exposed gravel outcrop, were not tested. High site probability areas, primarily creek
terraces along the corridor, were tested when archeological visibility was low and no
cultural manifestations were evident. At historic sites, structural drawings were made,
showing dimensions and door and window placements. No collections were made since
no temporally or functionally diagnostic artifacts were observed at prehistoric sites.
Historic sites recorded during the pedestrian survey were revisited following preliminary research on the specific land tract on which they were found. The records of the
Fayette County Clerk, those of the Barker History Center at The University of Texas, the
General Land Office of the State of Texas, the Texas Archeological Research Laboratory
files and the Texas State Archives were screened where necessary to establish an initial
evaluation of the resources recorded. Informants were interviewed when available, but
a formal search for additional knowledgeable persons was deferred to later investigations. Photographic recording was accomplished in accord with the basic
recommendations of the Historic American Buildings Survey (HABS) with full detail to
be accomplished during a subsequent mitigative phase. Artifact collections were not
made as the majority of sites were occupied and because the right-of-way usually does
not include the entire site.

36 / CULTURAL RESOURCE SURVEYS

Prehistoric Resources
Four prehistoric archeological sites, the series 41FY441 through 41FY444, were
identified along the conveyor corridor. Sites 41FY441, a small lithic scatter, and
41FY442, an extensive campsite, are located adjacent to Clear Creek. Site 41FY442 is a
lithic resource procurement area situated on Pleistocene gravels above the Hellers
Branch of Shaw Creek. Site 41FY444 is a small upland lithic scatter. No temporally
diagnostic artifacts were observed at these sites.
Three of the four prehistoric sites are within high site probability areas defined prior
to the survey. Sites 41FY441 and 41FY442 are situated on terraces on either side of Clear
Creek (Segment C). The latter site is located at a tributary confluence, where cultural
materials have been exposed by field terracing and plowing. There is abundant evidence
of camp maintenance activities (hearth construction) and lithic tool production. A single
thin biface was observed, indicating tool use. Since no temporally diagnostic artifacts
were noted, the frequency of site use is unknown. Site 41FY441, across the creek, is a
small lithic scatter consisting of 2 chert cores and at least 14 flakes. Two of the flakes
may have modified edges.
The third site within a high probability area, 41FY443, indicates use of Pleistoceneage gravels near the northern edge of the corridor (Segment E). Cultural materials
present indicate cobble selection and limited cobble reduction as site activities. The
relative abundance of primary flakes suggests tool production took place elsewhere.
Only one site, 41FY444, was identified in the low probability upland areas which make
up the remainder of the corridor. Less than 20 lithic artifacts, exposed by plowing,
comprise the site which is located in Segment E. Lithic processing is apparently the
primary site activity, but one edge-modified flake was observed. The nearest water
source is 600 meters distant.
Compilations of locations for Fayette County (Robinson 1984) indicate concentrations of sites along area creeks. The low density of upland sites has been demonstrated
within the Cummins Creek Lignite Prospect, including previous survey of Corridor
Segment F. Here, three prehistoric sites, identified along the divide between Cummins
and Rabbs creeks, represent a density of about one site per 10 square km. Given this low
density, the one upland site found along the conveyor corridor is well within expectations.
41FY441

This small lithic scatter is situated on a gently sloping terrace, about 150 meters south
of Clear Creek and across from the confluence of an unnamed left bank tributary. About
1.75 km upstream from the conveyor right-of-way, Clear Creek, augmented by spring
flow, changes from intermittent to perennial. Site 41FY441 is in an open field at an
elevation of approximately 365 feet (111 meters) MSL. Apparently, maize has been
cultivated in this field during past growing seasons, but it was fallow at the time of the
current survey.

THE OVERLAND CONVEYOR CORRIDOR I 37

Limited cultural material, consisting of two chert cores, two burned chert chunks, two
secondary chert flakes, approximately ten tertiary chert flakes and two edge-modified
chert flakes (one secondary and one tertiary) are surficially scattered across the eastern
section of the conveyor corridor. The actual site boundary extends about 35 meters east
of the right-of-way, with the site dimensions being approximately 50 by 50 meters.
Surface soils, which are a dark brown to black clay, have been churned by cultivation.
One shovel probe revealed no cultural material and no soil change to 30 cm below the
surface.
41FY442, THE OSWALD MIKES SITE

This large prehistoric campsite is located in an open field across Clear Creek from
41FY441, but on a slightly higher terrace. Site 41FY442 extends from near the creek,
paralleling the unnamed tributary up a gradual slope approximately 200 meters to the
north. The western edge of the site abuts a meander bend of the tributary and follows
the left bank, except for a wide meander near the creek confluence. An outcrop of chert
and quartz pebbles was observed upslope from the site to the north. The site is underlain
by Oakville sandstone, which is exposed in both the Clear Creek channel and the stream
bed of the tributary. Elevation of the site at its approximate center is 380 feet (116
meters) MSL. The terraced, normally plowed field was not presently in cultivation, but
has been planted in maize the preceding fall. Only along the northern edge of the site
do abundant low grasses obscure the ground surface. Along the western site periphery
adjacent to the tributary, juniper, post oak, yaupon holly, and greenbriar predominate.
Artifactual materials at 41FY442 are diverse, although no diagnostic projectile points
were found. Burned quartz, chert and some sandstone were seen in several areas across
the site. Chert debitage (primary, secondary and tertiary flakes), chert cores and core
fragments, quartzite hammerstones, several chert biface fragments, a petrified wood
chunk exhibiting one worked edge, and a large number of utilized chert flakes were
observed. Some of the chert flakes and core fragments are a lustrous reddish-gray,
possibly from thermal alteration of workable lithic material. This process, known as
annealing, improves the workability of the material and has been documented in the area
(Skelton 1977). Site dimensions are about 200 meters (north-south) by 100 meters
(east-west). Artifactual materials are concentrated following a north-south linear pattern along the west central portion of the site. Two subsurface probes revealed light
brown sandy loam surface soils change to a mottled orange sandy clay between 25 and 35
cm below the surface. Cultural materials were present in the upper zone but were not
recovered from the sandy clay. Subsequent testing of 41FY442 is reported in a later
section of this report.
A very minor historic component at this site is represented by green bottle glass and
broken ceramic whiteware. Materials are very thinly scattered across the site, with no
apparent concentrations. No structural remains or other historic features were observed.

38 / CULTURAL RESOURCE SURVEYS

41FY443

This large lithic scatter is located approximately 260 meters south of Hellers Branch
on a mapped Pleistocene terrace deposit (Bureau of Economic Geology 1974). Surficially exposed gravels and cobbles are predominantly high quality chert and quartzite mixed
with minor amounts of other rock types. Site 41FY443 is situated on a gentle slope
overlooking intermittent Hellers Branch, part of the headwaters of Shaw Creek which
drains into Cummins Creek about 8 km to the east. Elevation at the site center is about
430 feet (131 meters) MSL. Three-quarters of the site is in dense woods, composed
primarily of juniper and post oak. The northeastern quarter of the site is open pasture
used for grazing cattle. Low grasses and scattered annuals grow in both the pasture and
the woods.
Tested chert cobbles, chert cores and core fragments, primary and, to a lesser extent,
secondary chert flakes, both broken and whole quartzite hammerstones, and one crude
chert biface were observed on the surface over an area 160 by 125 meters in size. Surface
soils are a sandy loam interspersed with gravels. No shovel probes were excavated since
the gravels are Pleistocene in age.
41FY444

This small site is situated on a gentle slope at the headwaters of Shaw Creek, between
Hellers Branch and an unnamed branch. Each branch is approximately 600 meters
distant. Site 41FY444 is exposed in a large open field, apparently cultivated in the recent
past. An excellent view to the north and northwest is afforded from the site.
Limited cultural material, including several small pieces of burned chert, one
quartzite hammerstone, chert debitage (approximately 15 primary, secondary and tertiary flakes), and one edge modified secondary chert flake were observed in an area 50
meters in diameter. No shovel probes were excavated, but a hole located at the site
periphery revealed no soil changes. Backdirt was examined but no cultural material was
observed. Soil is a dark brown/black clay to clay loam of the Heiden-Crockett association. The site rests on the Catahoula Formation, where soils develop locally into the
fertile Houston Black-Heiden association in many locations (Jackson and Garner 1982).
Historic Resources
The conveyor corridor survey produced six locations with historic components within
the right-of-way. Four of these were recordable as archeological sites and their descriptions are included in this report.
The other two proved to be of recent origin and without particular significance. One
of these latter is an abandoned outhouse of the shallow, lime-containing variety, its
concrete receptacle now empty. Construction materials are recent (within the last
quarter century), consisting of an undercut lumber frame and a corrugated metal roof
held together by galvanized wire nails. All its inside amenities have been removed and
the shed-like structure displaced from its position over the concrete receptacle. It is

THE OVERLAND CONVEYOR CORRIDOR I 39

associated with a farmstead composed of 1960s vintage structures, outside the right-ofway. The other historic locale not accorded site status is a 1950s vintage I-cottage
converted to use as a storage building for a cattle feed lot not now operating. Both the
outside and inside of this structure have undergone extensive modification, including
removal of the flooring and room partitions and closure of the entrances. There is no
evidence, material or archival, that this structure is anything other than a very cheaply
constructed modern dwelling which was converted from its original use to a feed lot
storage barn after about a decade as a domicile. The surrounding area has been modified
in the extreme by the placement of concrete drain channels and feeding troughs for the
adjacent feed lot, as well as by the operation of the lot itself. These two structures are
included herein for the sake of completing the record.
Owing to the linear nature of the conveyor corridor, the four recorded sites are
associated more with nearby communities than with each other (Fig. 4). The site
descriptions address these basic associations where appropriate. The sites include a
ruined former farmstead, a nearly intact farmstead with nine standing structures of
various ages, an occasionally occupied farmstead whose main structure is scheduled to
be moved from the construction right-of-way, and a nineteenth century structure, once a
house, which was moved to its present location for use as a barn about the turn of the
century.
In addition to the above-mentioned sites, a structure with possible archeological/historical significance was noted outside of the construction right-of-way. It is not affected
by the conveyor line nor by any currently anticipated activity attendant to the power plant,
its operation, or its fuel mining activities. However, it will be recorded as an archeological site to the extent its owner permits as a "flag" to future investigators and as a property
with probable significance within the cultural/ethnic microregion. A preliminary site
description is included herein.
41FY440, THE DOMEL-HACKEBEIL STRUCTURE

The site consists of a nineteenth century frame house of the simple, English square
plan which has been modified for use as a barn (Fig. 5). It was moved from its original
location to the present one about the turn of the century and had been unoccupied for
an undetermined amount of time prior to the move (Domel 1985, personal communication). The original location is in the general vicinity of the present one and is thus within
the cultural/ethnic microregion. Owned by H.O. Hackebeil at the time it was moved, it
became the property of Herman Domel, father of the present owner, Raymond Domel,
in 1925 (Fayette County Deed Record 143:244-245).
The structure is of vertical board construction on a pegged mortise and tenon braced
frame. The structure's current condition is such that any attempt to move it again would
result in severe damage, as the pegged joins show evidence of differential aging of the
woods involved and are weakened by it. The house/barn stands on what appears to be
original, or at least early, stone piers.
The structure is located at the extreme western boundary of the conveyor right-of-way
in Section B of the corridor. Although nearer the Park community, it is probably more

40 / CULTURAL RESOURCE SURVEYS

FIGURE 5. The Domel-Hackebeil Barn, 41FY440.
closely linked with Oldenburg, the closest commercial community with postal service in
the late decades of the nineteenth century. Since Oldenburg was not a voting precinct
location at the time (Lotto 1902:400), the area's residents were politically linked to either
Warrenton or Rutersville. If Warrenton's voting district included this residence, it would
fall within the influence area of the German-Texas cultural/ethnic microregion centered
in the Cummins Creek area.
The structure is a fine example of braced frame construction and excellent nail-free
joinery, two carpentry methods now only infrequently employed. Its relocation from the
original site rules out practical investigation of artifact locational pattern at the current
location would be heavily affected by nearby, much more recent structures, and the site's
twentieth century use as a barn. Its potential for National Register determination or State
Archeological Landmark status hinges on further archival investigation and whether or
not its original location can be pinpointed. The structure's location outside but close to
the construction right-of-way and the wishes of Mr. Domel that it not be moved, necessitate some active measures be taken to ensure it is protected from accidental damage if
conveyor construction is resumed.
41FY445, THE ZINGELMANN SITE

The Zingelmann farmstead is a multi-component site directly in the path of the
conveyor corridor. The historic component consists of a farmhouse, cistern, and associated outbuildings. The basic house structure, which has seen a number of
modifications and additions, the cistern, and at least one end-gabled shed are in excess

THE OVERLAND CONVEYOR CORRIDOR I 41

of 50 years of age. The house is a one and a half-story, side-gabled, four unit masse plan
structure with a varied pitch to its roof and full facade front porch (Fig. 6). There is
evidence of material reuse in the construction of the porch and in the siding and of
alteration in the roof pitch to provide additional upstairs space.
The current owner, Mrs. Lillian Zingelmann, believes the house dates to the midnineteenth century, based on family oral history (Zingelmann 1985, personal
communication), but the archival record does not thus far support this. Construction
methods and materials viewable from outside the structure (it is occupied sporadically
as a weekend or vacation home) support a late nineteenth century â early twentieth
century date, but detailed examination of the house core could alter this impression. A
modern skirt siding denies direct viewing of the foundation at the sides of the structure
and a modern rear addition and the porch effectively screen viewing from the front. The
fenstration particulars are modern with respect to frames, glass, glazing, and hardware,
but modern undercut novelty siding may mask much earlier materials.
The end-gabled shed has wood shingles showing beneath modern roofing material.
Its shape, profile and lines are harmonious with that of the house, pointing to obvious
alterations and additions, with the implication that they are of contemporary origin. The
covered cistern has a 1930s date incised in its concrete rim, but that rim appears to have
been laid to accommodate the use of a hand pump followed later by an electric one, with
some indication of an earlier windlass and bucket arrangement.

FIGURE 6. The Zingelmann House, prior to its relocation outside the corridor.

42 / CULTURAL RESOURCE SURVEYS

The house is located geographically in proximity to Oldenburg (1.4 miles distant), a
community founded in 1886, but may also have ties to Warrenton and thus to the
German-Texas cultural/ethnic microregion of Cummins Creek (the North Central Fayette
Microregion; see Moncure 1985). The current owner moved the house to a point on her
property outside the conveyor right-of-way subsequent to the survey. Further testing and
oral history are reported in a subsequent section of this report.
41FY447, THE TSCHIEDEL SITE

This site is a historic farmstead, dismantled for its materials according to Charles H.
Rose, the owner since 1959 (Rose 1985, personal communication). The remnants of
native stone foundation piers mark its location. Materials not removed from the site after
demolition are stacked in the general area of the foundation and include hand-molded
brick, pegged joint window frames, evidence of board and batten siding and some
hardware (hinges, latches, and braces) of the type which could have been obtained as
early as the turn of the century. A complete description of the house, based on informant
information and historic documentation, can be found in the section on historic site
analysis.
A stone-lined well with an upper rim finish of hand-molded brick and a twentiethcentury angle iron and stamped metal windmill lie just outside the conveyor construction
right-of-way near the former house site (Fig. 7). Reuse of the brick at a date much later
than their manufacture cannot be ruled out as there appears to be two types of mortar
on some loose specimens and the joints of those still in place show poor adhesion.
A standing barn is located on a pace-measured 180 feet from the house foundation
stones to their east (Fig. 8) and about 40 feet outside the construction right-of-way. This
structure shows a number of relatively recent modifications, including the use of undercut
lumber, mold-formed concrete foundation piers and recent hardware, but also utilized

FIGURE 7. Capped well at

large, hand-shaped beams in its sill beams and joists. Felling axe and broadaxe marks are
present. Owing to these being supported on the mold formed concrete piers, the barn
may have been moved in from another location. Initial examination did not reveal
evidence of earlier foundation material though it may have been removed. Next to this
barn is a concrete watering trough with an incised date of 1938.
Within the construction right-of-way and a paced 100 feet north of the house foundation stones is a long, narrow concrete watering trough/feeding trough without markings.
The concrete aggregate used is not noticeably different in finish or surface materials from
that used in the smaller, dated trough located next to the barn.
The ruined house site presents no unusual employment of materials, examples of
outstanding craftsmanship, or significant architectural features that might meet National
Register of Historic Places criteria. The site is close to the unincorporated community
of Park, which was settled in the 1860s (Webb 1952:3335). Further oral history, archival
searches, and testing which traced the affiliation of this site to the original owners, the
Tscheidels, is reported in a subsequent section of this report.
41FY448, THE FRENZEL SITE

The Frenzel farm is part of the Walhalla community by location and economic
affiliation, and parts of it date to 1869 (Williams 1976:404; Fayette County Deed Records
58:114-115). The sons of the farm's original purchaser operated a molasses press in
Walhalla in the early twentieth century following the example of their father who
operated an earlier such press in the 1880s (Williams 1976:404). The second mill, at
Walhalla, was sporadically operated from circa 1918 to 1955 by four generations of
Frenzels and has since been dismantled.
The farmstead consists of nine standing structures, seven of which are located within
the conveyor construction right-of-way. Three of the nine structures, one of these outside
the right-of-way bounds, show materials indicative of age greater than 50 years and
possibly as much as 100 years. At the time of the survey, the farmstead was occupied and

44 / CULTURAL RESOURCE SURVEYS

in use although no one was at home. Accordingly, on-site investigation was limited to
photographs, and outside observation of the yard and buildings within the right-of-way.
The current farmhouse and four of the six outbuildings within the right-of-way show
the outward characteristics of mid-twentieth century construction, as does one small shed
outside the right-of-way. A barn and a small shed in the corridor appear to be older. A
second barn located about 90 feet west of the corridor construction boundary shows
characteristics which hint it may have seen use as a residence and that it may date to the
turn of the century (Fig. 9). Further archival research, the seeking of oral history
informants, and examination of building interiors are reported in the testing section of
this report.

FIGURE 9. Extant outbuilding at the Frenzel site, 41FY448.
41FY449, THE WHITE SITE

This historic site, a part of the Walhalla community, is not located within the bounds
of the conveyor corridor right-of-way and is unaffected by its construction. The site is
included here, although not in the surveyed area, as one believed to be important in the
early settlement of the Walhalla area and worthy of flagging for future reference.
In a complex of buildings ranging from a modern mobile home, a 1950s dairy barn,
recent sheds and fenced garden/yard is a T-plan structure, the front portion of which is a
two story I-type house constructed in 1923 (White 1985, personal communication). The
one-story stem of the T is a much earlier, often altered structure alleged to be at least a

THE OVERLAND CONVEYOR CORRIDOR I 45

century old (White 1985, personal communication). The obvious outward characteristics
support this. Materials, construction methods, plan and roof profile are consistent a with
nineteenth-century origin. The property once belonged to the Blume family (Fayette
County Deed 88:371-372; 87:216; Probate Record 5983). J.H. Blume was one of the early
German settlers in Walhalla (Williams 1976:24). The site is well protected from conveyor
construction impact by distance and fencing and is occupied by its owner, Mrs. Gladys
M. White.
Assessments and Recommendations
This section of the report assesses the research potential of the four prehistoric and
four historic sites within the overland conveyor corridor and makes recommendations
toward a no-adverse-effects determination. Prehistoric and historic resources are discussed separately.
PREHISTORIC RESOURCES

Of the four prehistoric sites identified, only 41FY442 has high research potential.
Positive assessment of this site is based primarily on its location along a Cummins Creek
tributary near the Colorado River. Site 41FY442 represents the only opportunity within
the project area to compare upland creek sites within the lignite prospect and sites near
the river within Columbus Bend Reservoir. Information potential is limited by disturbances to the site as a result of field terracing and plowing, although deeply buried
deposits may be intact. Regardless of the fact that cultural materials are probably without
context, data concerning period of occupation and tool assemblages represented are vital
to an understanding of area prehistory. Testing to assess the nature of buried deposits
and quantities of tools present is recommended prior to construction. If possible, tools
and other cultural materials previously removed from the site by collectors should be
examined and photographed.
The research potential of the remaining three prehistoric sites is low. Defining areas
of lithic resource procurement is necessary to understand prehistoric settlement, but
little data beyond the survey level can be obtained from sites such as 41FY443, where
evidence of tool production is lacking. Further work at this time would not be scientifically productive.
Cultural materials observed at identified lithic scatters, 41FY441 and 41FY444, are
similar despite differences in location. Both sites contain lithic processing remains â
cores, flakes, and hammerstones â and utilized flakes. Although recognition of
distinctive kinds of upland sites is important, the research potential of the individual sites
is not high. The low information yield of upland sites has been demonstrated by testing
within the prospect (Nightengale n.d.). Further work at either site 41FY441 or 41FY444
would not prove scientifically productive at this time.

46 / CULTURAL RESOURCE SURVEYS

HISTORIC RESOURCES

Four of the five historic sites will be affected by construction of the overland conveyor.
The White Site, 41FY449, is well protected by distance and by its resident owner.
41FY440 (the Domel-Hackebeil structure), 41FY445 (the Zingelmann Site), 41FY447
(the Tschiedel Site), and 41FY448 (the Frenzel Site), all contain early historic components, but the survey level documentation is not adequate to evaluate the role of each
of these farmsteads in the local history. Further archival work will place each within a
factual context, enabling more precise determinations of their standing as contributing
members of the Cummins Creek-Fayette Power Plant Historic District.
Summary of the Overland Corridor Survey

In summary, intensive survey of an overland conveyor corridor, connecting the Cummins Creek Lignite Prospect to the Fayette Power Plant, resulted in the recording of four
prehistoric and five historic sites. Three of the prehistoric sites were in high probability
areas as defined prior to survey as a planning aid for the LCRA. Only site 41FY442 holds
some potential for contributing to regional research problems. The results of testing are
reported in a subsequent section.
One of the historic sites, 41FY449, the White Site, is peripheral to the right-of-way
and was recorded to advise future researchers of its location. The Domel-Hackebeil
barn, 41FY446, is just outside the proposed construction corridor and can be avoided.
Additional archival research and documentation to identity the particulars of their age,
origin, and community affiliation of the remaining three was carried out (see Historic
Testing). All recorded sites lie within the Cummins Creek-Fayette Power Plant National
Register District. Future research is intended to determine their role within the larger
cultural sphere and to assess their status as contributing members of this District.

WINCHESTER-SALEM TRANSMISSION LINE REROUTE
Steven M. Kotter and Bruce A. Nightengale
The major portion of the proposed new right-of-way of the Winchester to Salem
transmission line reroute traverses the upland divide separating Cummins and Rabbs
creeks. Beginning near the southeastern corner of the Permit Area, the line runs west
and a little north to near the community of Nechanitz, above the Rabbs Creek Basin. The
right-of-way crosses two upland tributaries of Cummins Creek, Turkey, and Shaw creeks.
The western end of the line crosses Jones Creek, then Owl Creek, and Rabbs Creek
tributaries, before rejoining the existing transmission line. The line crosses the majority
of environments defined within the Permit Area boundaries.
Methods
During 1984, the LCRA initiated a Region of Interest Study for a possible reroute of
the existing Winchester-Salem transmission line where it crosses the proposed Cummins
Creek mining zone. As part of this study, the Texas Archeological Survey was provided
maps of a preliminary reroute that followed the eastern and southern boundaries of the
mine permit area. A literature and records search was undertaken during December
1984 which identified:
1.

unsurveyed land to be affected by proposed construction;

2.

high site probability areas within unsurveyed land based on the results of
previous surveys;

3.

potentially significant known sites within the reroute; and

4.

potentially significant known sites near the reroute.

On the basis of the information provided, the LCRA modified the transmission line
location to avoid a number of known sites and culturally sensitive areas. The corridor
was then surveyed to determine its effect on the remaining cultural resources in its path.
Results
Two known prehistoric sites, 41FY327 and 41FY336, were reinvestigated and a third
prehistoric site, 41FY457, was identified by the transmission line survey. Both of the
previously recorded sites occur above high banks at the outside edge of a meander, site
41FY327 above Jones Creek and 41FY336 above Owl Creek. In both instances, the sites
are bisected by a property boundary fence that separates the cleared eroded portion
viewed during the earlier survey from the portion under current investigation. Also in
both instances, the wooded site areas are less eroded, although some deflation was noted.
Surficial cultural materials were found only adjacent to the creek bank, and prehistoric

47

48 / CULTURAL RESOURCE SURVEYS

remains elsewhere are assumed to buried and relatively intact. The presence of buried
deposits is particularly important since only an early lanceolate projectile point, a bifacial
Guadalupe gouge and a split cobble scraper were recovered during the survey.
Site 41FY457 occupies a small rise adjacent to Jones Creek and across from site
41FY327. Although only interior flakes were observed, the majority of materials are
buried. Available geomorphic data suggests that the rise may be of recent origin and the
potential for a single occupational episode is correspondingly greater than at landforms
of greater age. A detailed description of this site follows.
41FY457

Site 41FY457 is a small, 25 by 25 meter site located adjacent to Jones Creek and
classified as a lithic scatter on the basis of current data. Cultural materials were noted
on rodent spoil piles that dot the crest of a low rise within the creek floodplain. Sandy
surface soils primarily support short grasses, but trees grow only along the creek margin.
Cultivation of the field above the site apparently did not extend near enough to the creek
to affect site deposits. Elevation is approximately 350 feet MSL.
Variability of artifactual materials is low, since only scattered small interior flakes
were observed. However, factors affecting site condition are limited to rodent and other
bioturbation. The type and uniformity of remains are consistent with a late occupation
(such as the Driftwood phase occupation at 41FY264) suggested by the location and
origin of the landform. A moderate to high information yield potential is indicated.
Assessments and Recommendations

Each of the prehistoric sites investigated during the transmission line survey is felt to
warrants additional investigations, if avoidance is not feasible. The initial assessments
of information yield potential of sites 41FY327 and 41FY336 (Nightengale, Jackson, and
Moncure 1985) were based on the eroded nature of the known site areas. The identification of more intact portions of each site during the current survey modifies this
assessment, especially of site 41FY327, where late Paleoindian or Early Archaic artifacts
have been found. Testing to determine the nature and context of buried cultural materials
was recommended. The results of assessment testing at site 41FY336 are described later
is this report.
Testing was also recommended at site 41FY457, located on a recent alluvial landform
where the potential for mixing of early and late occupations is less. The site may mark
intensive use of this portion of Jones Creek documented at nearby site 41FY326, beginning during the Middle Archaic Period. Cessation of mine development halted the
proposed testing of this site.

IMPROVEMENTS TO COUNTY ROADS 112 AND 114

Bruce A. Nightengale and Henry Moncure
The community of Waldeck, a hamlet documented during the second intensive survey
of the Cummins Creek Mine (Nightengale, Jackson, and Moncure 1985) is located on the
crest of the divide between Cummins and Rabbs creeks. Upgrading county roads to
accomodate anticipated heavy truck traffic mandated survey of a small area within the
town. Two historic sites, designated 41FY418 and 41FY419, were identified on the basis
of scattered surface remains augmented by informant interviews. Site 41FY400, the Bell
Settlement School, had been recorded during the second major Cummins Creek survey
(Nightengale, Jackson, and Moncure 1985). Informant interviews ascertained the outward appearance, layout, and function of the industrial and educational facilities. A
testing program at these sites, and a fourth, 41FY446, discovered subsequent to the
survey during clearing operations, was previously reported to the LCRA and THC
(Moncure 1985; Bartholomew 1985) and is summarized in the following section concerning data collection within the Waldeck community.

SECTION III
HISTORIC SITE TESTING

Page intentionally left blank.

INTRODUCTION TO HISTORIC SITE TESTING
This section of the report summarizes investigations of historic sites that would have
been affected by Phase IV mine activities. Mandated testing at three sites âthe Zingelmann home (41FY445), the Tschiedel barn (41FY447), and the Frenzel farm
(41FY448)âwithin the Overland Conveyor Corridor, was completed in January, 1986.
A fourth site, the Domel-Hackebeil barn, was avoided. Two phases of field testing, during
March and June, 1985, were conducted at three adjacent sites within the Waldeck
community and at the Bell Settlement school; all had experienced such severe prior
disturbance that the field work contributed little beyond what had been learned from
informant interviews. The main access road surrounding the mine would have adversely
affected the Ahschlager Tenant House, 41FY413, where subsurface testing was completed during September 1985.
Several different approaches were used to investigate these historic sites for several
reasons. The work described herein took place in 1985 and 1986 and was carried out by
a number of different people, listed as authors on the various segments of this section.
The major sources of variability, however, are attributable to the prescribed methods
imposed by the regulatory agencies. Along the Overland Conveyor Corridor, if field work
had been held in abeyance until the archival and oral historical research was completed,
testing of the Zingelmann, Frenzel, Tschiedel sites would not have been necessary.
Fieldwork at all three sites in the Overland Conveyor Corridor contributed nothing to
their historic context that was not much more easily obtained through informant interviews.
Excavating 50 cm square test units at Waldeck was also mandated despite the wealth
of evidence gained from local informants about the history of land use and the extent of
damage done to the sites by demolition and road construction. In the case of the Bell
Settlement School, only the very periphery of the grounds bordering the road was tested,
producing modern roadside garbage. The accounts of former teachers and students were
much more useful in reconstructing the school and its history.
The final historic site, the Ahschlager Tenant House, was approached from a different
perspective. There, archival research was of little value in tracing the history of this
tenant dwelling and only one previous occupant could be located. So little information
was available that standard excavation units were established to reconstruct the layout of
the property and to recover a sample of artifacts. This report clearly demonstrates the
advantages in pursuing archival and oral historical avenues of research before resorting
to field testing of historic sites.

ADDITIONAL INVESTIGATION AT THREE HISTORIC SITES
WITHIN THE OVERLAND CONVEYOR CORRIDOR
Patience E. Patterson and Dan K. Utley

Additional investigations at three historic sites within the Overland Conveyor Corridor, the Zingelmann Site, 41FY445; the Tschiedel Site, 41FY447; and the Frenzel Site,
41FY448; were conducted to evaluate the data potential and significance of each site.
The nature of the investigations and the requisite procedures were mandated by the State
Historic Preservation Officer (THC letter, 12-23-85) as follows.
41FY445, The Zingelmann Site

1.

Prepare a scaled map of the fenced area and the outbuildings; include
vegetative sample.

2.

The new location of the house should be recorded and photodocumented.

3.

Photodocument all structures and the fence.

4.

Conduct oral interviews on the functions of each structure and feature, and
the arrangement of the yard/garden through time.

5.

Methods

Field methods employed at each of the sites were similar but varied in accordance
with the specified requirements. Initially, a 5- and/or 10-meter grid was established along
and within the conveyor corridor. The grid system was centered on the corridor midline
and numbered N100/W100, unit numbers increased toward the north and west. Constant
volume tests of 50 x 50 x 30 cm were excavated to maintain comparability on an intra-site
basis. A 50 by 50 cm wooden template was placed on the surface in the northwest corner
of the units to assure exact same-size excavation units across the site. In some cases, a
test unit was moved to accommodate an obstruction. All matrix was screened through
V^inch mesh hardware cloth. Artifactual materials were bagged and marked with the
site number, date, grid coordinates and excavators. A preliminary specimen inventory
was recorded after each day's work.
Mapping of the site was accomplished with a transit and stadia rod. All cultural
features were mapped along with major vegetation, such as trees and flower beds.
Photographs (35 mm) were taken during the course of fieldwork to document buildings, features and general work progress. Black and white (4x5 inch format) photographs
were taken of appropriate structures in accordance with the mandates of THC. Oral
interviews were conducted by Dr. Thad Sitton, head of the Texas Sesquicentennial Oral
History Committee, and Dan Utley, staff historian.

41FY445, The Zingelmann Site
The Zingelmann Site is a multicomponent site located 1.4 miles east of Oldenburg,
Texas, overlooking an unnamed intermittent tributary of Clear Creek some 1400 feet (426
meters) to the south. The site consists of a minor prehistoric component and the remains
of an historic homestead. The house had been moved 300 yards (274 meters) to the
northeast of its original site subsequent to the survey. Associated buildings that remain
in their original context are the smokehouse, old barn, new barn, hog pen and a turkey
pen (Fig. 10).
The house faced south-southeast and was surrounded by a fence, some sections of
which are very recent. Included within the fenced area and east of the house is a garden
(Fig. 10) separated from the house by three large hackberry trees, a long bed of iris and
a small pecan tree. Lillian Zingelmann noted that in the 1950s they put in "carpet grass,"
San Augustine grass; until that time the family swept the yard. The fenceline in front of
the house is bordered on the inside by five crepe myrtles and one hackberry tree. Iris
beds line the walk leading from the fence to the cement steps at the front of the house.
A cistern immediately behind of the house and a capped well inside the house provided
water for the homestead. The fireplace and kettle, the site of many home activities such
as soap making, boiling clothes, rendering butchered hogs, etc., was near the northeast
corner of the yard. The smokehouse, located north of the house at the edge of the
backyard, has been modified by the addition on the east side of a tack room and on the
north side by a tractor shed. The old and new barns are to the northeast of the house
site. The hog and goat pens are to the northeast and east of the house and garden, while
the turkey pen is situated to the southwest (Fig. 10).
ORAL INTERVIEWS AND ARCHIVAL DATA

The orientation of research at the Zingelmann Site was determined by the relatively
intact condition of the farmstead and the availability of oral history subjects. Because of
these factors, emphasis was placed on the oral account of historic lifestyles, community
activity and land use. Extensive interviews were conducted with Lillian and Irene
Zingelmann, both of whom were raised on the property. They are the daughters of
Thaddeus and Johanna Keilers, and were conveyed the property in 1921 by Henry
Wubbenhorst, Mrs. Keilers' father. Lillian and Irene later married the Zingelmann
brothers, resulting in the shared last name. The interviews were conducted both in the
family home and later at the original house site, which was then being tested by the
archeologists. There, additional information was obtained regarding specific uses of
existing structures.
The Zingelmann interviews provide good background material and insights into rural
life in the Oldenburg community of the 1920s through 1940s. Lillian Zingelmann expressed fond memories of the time, primarily for the strong sense of community that was
evident then:
And this is where we've lost a lot of our America, because when they built
a barn, the neighbors helped. When they made their hay, the neighbors

helped. When there was somebody sick, the neighbors helped. The
neighborhood was definitely a neighborhood then. They really did watch
out for one another. And this is something that I really have to say truthfully
I miss alot, because some of the best times we had were the ones where
neighbors got together.
The Zingelmanns remember Oldenburg as the center for most of the family's community activity. The settlement was established in 1886 and by the 1920s included a
blacksmith shop, tin shop, doctor's office, two grocery stores, one saloon with a barber
shop (Thaddeus Keilers was the town's barber for many years), one meat club house, a
cotton gin and a dance hall. Oldenburg also had a school, which served as an important
focal point for the surrounding community. Lillian and Irene Zingelmann, both of whom
became teachers, remember the school fondly.
The schoolhouse, located at the intersection of County Road 213 and State Highway
237, could be reached by crossing neighboring farms in a relatively direct route. Lillian
recalls the children of as many as ten families would meet in front of the Zingelmann
house. She describes the route as approximately three miles in length and notes that
many of the children inscribed their names on the inside of the Zingelmann rent barn
(since razed) as they passed through. She added:
You had to get permission from your neighbors for your children to walk
(across their property). And you know what else you had to do? You had
to educate your children to dodge all the bulls in the pasture. That was a
real hazard when I taught my first year in school.
An important social event of the year was the school's annual Christmas program
where families from across the community would gather to watch their children perform.
Another important event for the students was the annual scholastic league competition
in La Grange, in which the Oldenburg Owls participated. The closing of the school year
was marked by a large picnic.
Both Lillian and Irene noted that they did not speak English when they first enrolled
in school. However, the teachers knew German and assisted the students in making the
transition. Lillian added that after the early 1920s, her father's generation began speaking more English in the home. "It was your grandmothers and grandfathers that kind of
insisted on speaking German language." The change to English was, therefore, a transition for the family as well as for Lillian and Irene. Lillian said her father had attended a
more traditional German school, near Clear Creek, known as Welcome and that the
school name was even considered at one time for the community. However, since many
of the area's settlers were from Oldenburg, Germany, that name was chosen instead. The
school closed in 1945, when it was consolidated with Fayetteville. Lillian taught at
Oldenburg the last two years before the school closed. It is interesting to note that both
Lillian and Irene were less than 20 when they began teaching.
Although a focal point for a wide agricultural area, Oldenburg was also a dispersed
settlement in several ways. It was not a voting district, so residents cast their ballots in
Walhalla. Likewise, since it lacked a Lutheran church, the German farming families
traveled to worship services in Rutersville and other communities.

60 / HISTORIC SITE TESTING

One institution that did not necessarily follow community lines, but provides insight
into the significance of the rural neighborhood is the meat club. Each community had
one that supported the various farms of the immediate area. Although not typically
German in origin, the meat club is representative of rural Texans in the 1920s - 1940s. At
least 20 families would be included in each club, which was a communal effort to quickly
butcher the available meat stock each year. Lillian described the purpose of the meat
clubs:
... in the early part of the spring, most of the communities around here had
a beef club. The neighborhood would get together, and if they wanted to
âyou were a farmer and you lived in the communityâyou were invited to
join a club. They called it the meat club, and one was the butcherer. At
first, he just got a little extra meat, but later on they gave him money.
Everyone was fattening up a steer during the year for this club. You would
have a number and this steer would have to dress out a certain number of
pounds, and they would figure that out by the number of people.
She added that the butcher would come to the farmer's house and would butcher the
steer there. "That's when we used our butchering tree. They'd hang it up in there and
gut it and clean it and skin it. Of course you sold the skin." She noted that the skin and
tripe were often sold to neighboring Black families. The whole butchering process was
operated as a business. "There was bookkeeping involved in this âat the end of the year
they would say 'You have had so many pounds of meat and you owe so much to the
communal pot.'"
Each participating family had a number, equivalent to their share of the meat. Small
families might have half a number while larger ones might get two numbers. Each
family's share was hung on the hook corresponding to their number at the meat storage
place. When the meat was ready, the family would take their portion home, where they
quickly prepared it by cooking it and storing it in sterilized fruit jars. The families
received different parts of the steers in a rotating sequence; their portions and cuts varied
with each steer that was butchered.
The butchering of hogs was usually conducted by each family at their homesite, but
the Zingelmanns had a large smokehouse that was frequently used by other families.
Detailed photos of the smokehouse interior were made to supplement the oral history
descriptions of the butchering processes (Fig. 11). The only major element that is missing
is the butchering table, which Lillian remembered as originally belonging to her
grandfather.
Lillian and Irene recalled the hog butchering process:
LILLIAN: The hog was killed and hung in that big tree down there on the
corner (pointing in a direction between the current and former house sites),
and gutted. They'd shoot him with a rifle, then jump over the fence with a
pan to catch the blood (for blood sausage). Then they'd stick that hog. I
used to just cryâI wouldn't want them to do that. They would stick that
hog in that vein, then they would catch that blood in the pan, then they
would let it sit a little while, then they would sift it.

FIGURE 11. The smokehouse at the Zingelmann Site.

62 / HISTORIC SITE TESTING

IRENE: Then they would have a wash kettle of boiling water, and that was
my job. I'd take a little bitty pot with a handle and pour a little bit on that
hair and Daddy would pick at it. Then they'd bring it into the smokehouse
and cut it up. They'd lay it in quarters on those sides âthere used to be
sides up. The back one is where after they were through cutting and
trimming off their hamsâyou know, shaping them the way they wanted
them and sticking a big old twine through that hole that they would hang
'em with laterâ then they would lay their hams and their bacons on there,
and then you went with the salt and the pepper. They would lay there to
drain. Then, after about five days they would hang 'em. Of course, at the
same time, they were already smoking in the smokehouse.
The smoke was provided by a fire in a tub that was set in the center of the smokehouse.
A variety of woods, including oak, cedar and small pieces left from the family woodpile
were burned without particular concern over the type of wood used. The smokehouse
was large because several hogs, owned by different members of the extended family, were
smoked together. Multi-family smokehouses are not common in other rural areas of the
state, particularly east of Fayette County, and may represent a typically Texas-German
adaptation.
Once the hog butchering process was begun, it had to be completed as soon as possible
because of the danger of meat contamination. Family members would bring kerosene
lamps and work well into the night. Lillian provided more detail about the process:
What they'd do after they got through scraping it, they'd fill the kettle up
again and really stir up the fire, because then that boiling water was used
to clean the intestines that they used to stuff the sausage with. Okay, then
they'd fill it up another time and really go to stirring again. While the
women cleaned the intestines, the men were cutting up the carcass. The
tongue would be taken out and cleaned (by the uncles) and then they would
take all of that meat and throw it back in the kettle and boil it. Pigs feet
were not boiledâthey were set aside in a pail. They would boil all of this
meat in the big kettle, then take it outside and put it in big tubs and stuff
and let it cool down until they could handle it.
There was no seasoning used at that time. You wouldn't put salt in the
water â nothing like that â it was just clean boiled. And then you seasoned
it when you fixed your head sausage or blood sausage as some people called
it. You would take all of this meat and grind it... Now, people around here
used many different kinds of ways to do it, but we never put rice in oursâwe
never put crackers in ours that I can remember.
The only spices used during curing were cloves and allspice, but some relatives used
a small amount of sugar, as well. Salt, pepper, and saltpeter were added to the regular
sausage. When asked if they used sage in their sausage, Lillian noted that the Czechs did,
but that their family "didn't grow up that way."

OVERLAND CONVEYOR CORRIDOR / 63

The family kept smoke in the smokehouse for several months. The warmer it was and
the more moisture there was in the air, the more important it was to keep smoke. Lillian
said "Grandpa always said, early in the morning, keep the dew out of the smokehouse."
A theme central to interviews with the Zingelmann sisters was the total family effort
in the operation of the farm. From an early age, the children were trained to work in the
fields and to assume responsibility for important daily chores. Mrs. Keilers also worked
in the fields, even when the children were young. Lillian remembered her mother's
contributions to the family effort:
Mama always packed a lunch and took us up to the fields. We'd take our
toys alongâthe little ones âwe'd play in the wagons. She'd change diapers
there and everything else. We just stayed there. It was my duty to take care
of her (Irene). I'd be too little to do much in the fields, so they'd say, 'You
babysit Irene at the wagon.' And then they'd start picking the cotton way
down on the other side and you couldn't see Mama and Daddy, and here
was this little old mourning dove or whatever in the woods and you'd get
scared, start screaming for Mama and then Mama would drop her sack and
come help us.
As Lillian noted in her statement, the cotton fields were not near the home. According
to geographer Terry Jordan, who has written extensively on the German-Texans, this was
considered the norm. Gardens were usually adjacent to the farmstead, while cotton fields
were located further away.
The Keilers', and later Zingelmann's family garden, which was located immediately
to the side and behind the home, supplied such vegetables as corn, cabbage, tomatoes,
beets, okra, string beans, potatoes, and English peas, and also some herbs, including dill
and parsley. When a portion of the garden yielded a large amount, Mrs. Keilers' sisters
and mother would be called to help with canning. Describing a bountiful crop of beets,
Lillian noted:
... they would pull out these maybe two rows of beets and put them in this
big washpot and boil them up and then take them out in the tubs, you know,
and they'd be canning beets all day long. And while they were doing that
they were having a good time visiting and their kids were having a good time
playing.
At the end of the spring garden, Mrs. Keilers and her sisters harvested remaining
vegetables and made a vegetable soup that was put up in jars to be added to meat for
meals all winter long.
An interesting aspect of the home garden was the children's garden. Early on, their
mother set aside a plot of land for the children to cultivate and made them stay out of the
larger family garden. The children often gathered seeds from their plants and sold them
through the mail. Adjacent to the gardens was a large kettle used for making lye soap
and cracklings, or for cooking larger crop yields, such as the beets. When asked if they
ever made hominy in the pot, the reply was "That was not part of our culture â sauerkraut
and Haters."

64 / HISTORIC SITE TESTING

The home stood on rocks brought up from the creek. The underside was not enclosed,
providing space for the prowling of such wild animals as armadillos and dogs, cats and
turkeys that were an important part of the farm operation. Irene recalled, "We depended
on turkeys and chickens alot. Mama and Dad raised turkeys and later on had droves of
turkeys." When asked if they used turkey bells to keep up with their poultry, she replied
that they allowed them to range free on the land. The turkey pen, shown in Figure 11,
served as the central feeding area.
The family also sold milk, and in the late 1930s and early 1940s, efforts were made to
upgrade the farm's milk operation to meet the standards of the grade A milk program.
LILLIAN: By that time they had started little milk route that they hauled
to Schulenburg, cause the Carnation company was taking the grade B milk
then, in Schulenburg. This new barn up here has a real, real nice spot where
they always milked their cows.
IRENE: Well, and they had wanted to go into grade A because they were
discontinuing the grade B milk, but then the barn somehow or another
didn't quite qualify, so he just continued with the grade B and used the new
barn for a milking pen.
The Zingelmanns date the milk barn to the late 1930s, although they are not certain.
Dates are incised in other cement foundations on the property, but no such record could
be found for the milk barn. Lillian summed up the significance of the barn, however, by
adding, "the reason the house is still like it is, we didn't have any money to spend on the
house. We spent money on the barn, you know. That was the lifeline."
The Keilers usually had one renter, a sharecropper, whose home and barn were
located near the white gates that can be seen across the stock pond from the homesite.
The sharecropper received one-fourth of the crops, but had to help with the fieldwork.
At least one sharecropper was a family member, possibly a first cousin.
SITE TESTING

A total of 65 test units (50 x 50 x 30 cm) was excavated at the Zingelmann Site within
the construction right-of-way of the conveyor corridor (Fig. 10). The 1,630 artifacts
recovered from the test units are from the upper zone of the sandy loam soil, usually the
upper 20 to 30 cm of the excavated units (Table 9; Fig. 12). No artifacts were found in
the reddish clay in those units where the 30 cm depth included the sub-soil. Test units in
the garden area usually were entirely within the sandy surface zone; the clay appeared to
be just under 30 cm in depth. Throughout the area, bioturbation was a factor in mixing
of artifactual materials.
Table 10 and Figures 13 and 14 present the artifacts by functional categories. The
architectural/construction category, made up of window glass, square nails and wire nails,
represents 18% of total artifacts. Domestic ceramics, bottle glass, thin glass, bone, and
thin metal, such as tin can fragments, are the most abundant historic artifact category, at
27%. The personal category contains only buttons, since other items, which may have
been personal, could not be separated, and comprise less than 1% of the total. Fourteen

percent are within the farm/maintenance category, made up of wire, ammunition, and
miscellaneous metal parts. Although some of these items may have had other functions,
such as constituents of construction, they could not be differentiated with any assurity.
The prehistoric component constitutes the majority of artifacts at 41%.
The Zingelmann Site, according to oral and archival evidence, has been occupied for
at least 75 or 80 years, with only the intensity of use changing through time. Historic
artifacts recovered from the Zingelmann Site document traditional rural lifeways beginning during the early 1900s, and continuing until the present. Sherds of a brown glazed
earthenware, produced from the 1880s to the present, were possibly the earliest dated
artifacts found. Later remains include fragments of intentionally crazed porcelain,
popular in the 1910s. Fragments of glass stained purple by manganese, a process utilized
in glass-making prior to 1920, and fragments of brown, alkaline glazed Marshallware
which date from 1900 to the 1920swere also recovered. Milk glass canning tops found at
the site were also prevalent in the 1920s. Other artifacts indicate a wider temporal range,
such as fragments of yellow glass called Carnival Glass, popular in the 1930s. The

68 / HISTORIC SITE TESTING

artifacts are evidence of the daily activities of the inhabitants described by the Zingelmanns.
Figures 12 through 14 illustrate general distributional trends of artifacts recovered
from the test units. Figure 12 shows the distribution of all artifacts. Figure 13 shows
general spatial trends without architectural items such as nails and window glass. Figure
14 reflects the absence of both architectural items and prehistoric materials. The influence of the prehistoric component within the density patterns is illustrated by
comparing Figures 13 and 14.
There are two clusters of higher artifact densities on the east side of the house site,
one just east of the edge of the house and the other about 12 meters from the southeast
corner of the dwelling (Fig. 12). In between is an area of low artifact density that begins
5 to 10 meters from the house and extends to the garden. Very little historic material
occurs in this area (Figs. 13 and 14). Just east of the low density area, at the garden's
edge where Mrs. Lillian Zingelmann reported that up until the 1950s they swept their
yard, artifact densities increase (Figs. 13 and 14). The higher density of artifacts at the
western edge of the garden is a result of this practice. The high density area located off
the southeast corner of the house contained a very high count of wire. Lillian Zingelmann
reported that the wire may have been associated with the clothesline, located in that area.
41FY447, The Tschiedel Site
The Tschiedel House is located in the immediate vicinity of the Park Community south
of old County Road 159 and 2.5 miles south of Oldenburg. The site is east of a high
voltage transmission line that connects to the Fayette Power Plant 2 miles to the south.
The house was in ruins prior to 1959 when Charles Rose acquired the property from the
Veterans Administration (Fayette County Deed Records). Three stone foundation piers
indicate a general position of a dismantled house which was of pier and beam construction
with beaded siding. Building materials had been salvaged from the site, the remainder
piled in three locations adjacent to the house site. A windmill stands over a stone-lined
well east of the house and a hay barn is located 60 meters northeast of the house. The
barn, windmill and well are outside the conveyor right-of-way. Two recent cement
troughs north and northeast of the house are of similar construction; the smaller has the
date 1938 scratched in the concrete (Fig. 15).
Subsequent to the initial survey, the barn was moved to another location on the
adjacent property. Recent modifications include new hardware and concrete foundations
piers. Hand hewn beams are present in the building and some were lying on the ground
next to the structure.
ORAL INFORMATION AND ARCHIVAL RESEARCH

Initial attempts to trace the history of house construction and demolition were
frustrated by an inaccurate deed record that showed the Rose family acquiring the
property from the Wenzel Kasparek estate, but no evidence of his occupation of this site
could be located. Local informants finally resolved this problem by recalling that the

Tschiedel family had formerly owned this tract. Mrs. Josie Tschiedel Schuldt of
Beaumont provided details on family history and house construction.
Joseph and Theresia Tschiedel were born in Bohemia but emigrated to Fayette County
where they purchased a store and dance hall in the Park community. Their family home
was immediately adjacent to his commercial enterprises. Seven children were born
between 1855 and 1876. The third of these, Franz (Frank) Frederich, married Pauline
Brendle and built the house now known as 41FY447 in 1895.

70 / HISTORIC SITE TESTING

Pictures in Mrs. Schuldt's family album show the house was a two-story, modified
I-plan of style transitional between Greek Revival and Victorian (Fig. 16). The front is
symmetrical with a one bay, single story porch over the central entry. Gingerbread
detailing ornaments the porch brackets (Fig. 17). The roof had gabled ends with returns.
The pier and beam construction noted in the survey report was verified. A room at the
rear of the house, originally the kitchen, had been attached. The windows were fourover-four lights with shutters; the house was encased by clapboard siding.
FIELD TESTING

A total of 75 test units was excavated at the Tschiedel Site within the construction
right-of-way (Fig. 15), producing 1,106 artifacts. The major artifact categories are tabulated in Table 11.
The top soil in the site area is a dark brown loamy material that varies in depth from
0 to 10 cm. The underlying stratum is reddish, compact, gravelly clay. Artifacts are found
mostly in the darker soil, although a few were noted on the contact zone between the two
soil types.
Table 12 presents a breakdown of artifacts by functional categories. House associated
artifacts comprise 62% of the total. Window glass, nails, wood screws, window screen
fragments, porch posts, window frame, and shutter fragments and other architectural
elements testify to the on-site decline and ultimate razing of the structure. Domestic
artifacts make up 29% of the assemblage. Only 9% can be related to farm maintenance
and less than 1% were assigned to the personal category.
The artifacts recovered during testing conform to the construction date of 1895 as
recalled by Mrs. Schuldt. Modern artifacts scattered on the surface included plastic
shotgun shells and aluminum pull tabs. The dates of manufacture or use of some of the
recovered artifacts can only be estimated. For example, a basal frament of a milk glass
meat extract container was common in the early 1900s, manufactured from around 1890

until before World War I (1917). A bottle neck finish of manganese glass is dated from
about 1880 to pre-1903. A basal fragment of a glass container made by the Illinois Glass
Co. dates to the early 1900s. Other artifacts, such as a molded glass, four-hole button
and an extract bottle base, are later than the turn-of-the-century.
Fragments of hand-painted Chinese porcelain and fluted lamp chimneys give an
indication of a more refined genre of domestic artifacts. Traditional lifeways of the early
twentieth century were apparently practiced in the Tschiedel home.
Figures 18 and 19 illustrate general distributional trends in the artifacts recovered
from test units. Comparing the distribution of all artifacts (Fig. 18) with the modified
distribution lacking architectural items, the influence of the latter can be seen. The
highest density of artifacts occurs southwest of the house site. When the architectural
items are subtracted, the same units reflect a much lower density. It is speculated that
nails were removed from the lumber in this particular area as part of the salvage
operation, accounting for the inordinately high count of nails adjacent to the house. The
next highest artifactual density is in N80/W95, a unit within the house site area. The
materials are almost exclusively architectural and probably resulted from dismantling of
the house. Higher densities of non-architectural remains trend south of the house 10 to
30 meters, suggesting this may have been a refuse discard area, but aerial photographs
seem to indicate a possible garden plot. A thin to non-existent mantle of top soil north
of the house contained very few artifacts. Low artifact density areas inside and immediately outside the house site area are anomalies that cannot be reconciled.

The house faces east-northeast and is surrounded by hackberry, pecan and crepe
myrtle trees and a fence (Fig. 20). A garden where cotton, okra, tomatoes and brussel
sprouts were still evident, in back of, or west-southwest, of the house. The barn, built of
salvaged materials in 1951, and a storage shed are north of the house. The shop is east

ORAL INTERVIEWS AND ARCHIVAL DATA

Research on the Frenzel homestead was compiled through a variety of sources,
including oral history, county records, genealogy, family history, and on-site investigations. The most helpful source was a thorough family history, A Miller's Yield, written by
Barbara Frenzel Mueller and Judy Anderson Matejowsky (1982). More specific information about the property was obtained through an interview with Alfred Frenzel, uncle
of the homestead's most recent owner, arranged by Barbara Frenzel Mueller.
The patriarch of the Fayette County Frenzel family was Christian Andreas Frenzel
(1816-1892), a native of Germany, born in the Saxony region near Oberscheibe at
Scheibenberg. Although his parents and most of his family members were farmers in
Germany, Andreas Frenzel trained as a miller and baker under apprenticeship to his
Grandfather Sehmisch. He later took over the business upon the death of his
grandparents. In 1838, Andreas married Augustine Wilhelmine Picker (noted in some
records as Fiecker) (1818-1899). To the union were born twelve children, six in Germany
and six in the United States. With five children (a daughter, Ida Anna, died at the age of
two before the family came to the United States), the Frenzels migrated to America in
1853, leaving the port of Bremen aboard the ship "Herman Theodor" in September of
that year. During the passage, Andreas was recruited to serve as a baker.
The family entered Texas through the Port of Galveston on November 28, 1853, and
made their way to Fayette County, where they settled in the vicinity of Walhalla, 14 miles
north of La Grange. Named for the German pagan word for heaven, Walhalla served as
the commercial center for a widespread rural community of German farmers. Over the
years, the small town was the site of a store, blacksmith stop, post office, school, and
doctor's office. Shortly after arriving in Walhalla, Wilhelmine contributed to the growth
of the community when she gave birth to twin girls, Amelia Augusta and Louise Ernestine.
By 1856, the Frenzels had established a grist mill, lumber mill, and cotton gin in
Walhalla. Ruins of their early home north of the community on a high hill, across FM
1291 from the present Frenzel property, are still evident behind a generating plant site.
The Frenzel business operation was successful, and between 1866 and 1870, Andreas and
Wilhelmine returned to Germany, where they persuaded others to join them in America.
Some of the new immigrants, notably Carl Meinholdt and Helene Glosser, may not have
required much persuasion since they soon married into the Frenzel family.
The family's occupation of the present farm site was initiated by Richard Dethor
Frenzel (ca. 1856-1947), one of the FrenzePs younger children. Richard farmed in
Fayette County for a few years before he and his wife Elizabeth "Lizzie" (Schroeder)
(1867-1949) moved to Hempstead, where he worked for the railroad. In the late 1880s,
however, they returned to Walhalla to assist Andreas and Wilhelmine in the daily
operation of the family farm.
In the 1890s, Richard and Lizzie purchased from the family a 271-acre tract, including
the land now part of the proposed conveyor corridor, and located their family home
approximately a half mile up from FM 1291 on a hill. Richard and Lizzie had six children,
two of whom died in infancy. As the new center of a nuclear family, Richard and Lizzie
provided for their grown children by conveying land or constructing homes in the area.

78 / HISTORIC SITE TESTING

One home, built in 1928 for son Alfred, was later moved to the present corridor site,
where it became the home of another son, Virgel, and his wife Ora Lee (Eckert). The
home and the surrounding land was conveyed to Virgel and Ora Lee following their
wedding in 1935, after which all of the other buildings on the property were constructed,
The Frenzels' daughter, Barbara, was born in the early 1940s and recalls the construction
of the largest outbuilding, the barn, when she was about eight or nine years old. This
would place the construction date around 1951. An on-site inspection of the building
revealed a later addition, which contributed to the exterior saltbox design. Another large
building on the property housed Virgel's commercial garage operation, where he worked
on cars and tractors. Later, he went into the dirt-moving business and used the garage
to work on his own machines (Mueller and Matejowsky 1982).
The surrounding land was used primarily for agriculture, with Alfred, and possibly
Virgel, using tenant farmers to help. According to Alfred, cotton was the money crop,
although they also sold corn. Alfred notes:
The most I ever had (in cotton) was about fifty acres. That was when it
wasn't controlled. We had three or four renters on the place. The bigger
the family, the more land they had. They got one-third of the corn and
one-fourth of the cotton, was rent. Furnished them nothing.
The Frenzels continued to operate a saw mill and syrup mill just northeast of Richard's
house. The home and mills have since been torn down, but the ruins of the latter can still
be seen. Although the saw mill was important to the community, providing lumber for
many of the area's houses, it was the syrup mill that many residents still remember. The
Frenzels produced a cane syrup, while other mill operations in the county processed grain
sorghum. Alfred Frenzel describes his connection with the business, which he purchased
from a neighbor who had a mule power press.
Finally, I bought him out, more to get him out of business than I could use
any of the equipment, cause I got a power-driven mill, first with one of the
old time gasoline engines. Then, when it wore out â I believe I broke a
crankshaft on it â then I used a Model T motor. I started that business in
1927 and worked it until sometime âI don't know ...
At first we were using wood for the fire to boil it down. The second time I
fixed up a burner and burned butane fuel
We got, I believe, fifty cents
a gallon for the syrup. Before, it had never been over two bits a gallon. Still,
we didn't make much because the butane was too high. The last year we
cooked some over 4500 (gallons).
Most of the syrup business was "customer work", which meant area farmers brought
their cane by and had it made into syrup. Alfred noted that he would grow cane on
occasion for his own syrup, but that they were usually too busy to get help with the harvest.
"Mostly all that I tried to sell would be what I took on shares."
He describes the process:
People brought the cane, and then I had them on slides numbered. Then
the bookkeeper was supposed to keep them in order. I charged around

OVERLAND CONVEYOR CORRIDOR I 79

twenty cents a gallon, mostly. One year when everything was so
topsy-turvey in the early 30s, I charged 18 cents, only. Finally, the last time
I believe it was around two bits.
Quite often I took syrup for paymentâtwo-fifths. We didn't get rich, we
made a little. Two of the customers during that time â one had a 150 gallons
cooked and the other had 104 gallons. They were the highest. That went
all the way down to mostly around 15 or 20 gallons, although one had such
a little bit of cane I had to put it together with somebody else's to have
enough to cook, He had about 3 gallons (laughs).
Alfred's description of the sugar cane they used shows the varieties of the crop grown
in the neighboring areas.
The best was called the Texas Seeded Ribbon Cane âthat made the best
syrup. Some had old-time gooseneck cane yet. When it was ripe, the heads
would hang down, black-seeded. Sometimes they cut off the heads and
brought the cane with the bent stems on the stalkâthe trouble in handling
you might guess. It made good syrup, too, but the Texas Ribbon Cane was
about the best. Then there were different varieties of what we called
common cane-red top, orange. Orange made the best of the different
varieties.
Although it was not part of the oral history interview, it is assumed some of Andreas
FrenzePs recipes were handed down to his descendants who hopefully enjoyed a merger
of generations represented by a biscuit floating on thick ribbon cane syrup.
Alfred Frenzel also provided detailed information about the community of Walhalla,
which he notes eventually "went to sleep." He remembered when the town included a
"dance hall and a separate drink joint, called a saloon in those days." He also recalled
the school, which he described as "just a plain, square house, probably about 30 feet wide
and maybe 40 feet long with clapboard siding, the weather boards, and a shingle roof, and
on rocks."
He added that the interior space included a row of desks for the girls and one for the
boys, along with a recitation bench. "When the teacher called a certain class, the boys
and girls all in that class or that grade would come up and sit down there on that recitation
bench." Alfred was educated at home for several years before attending the public school.
When he did enroll, they placed him in the third grade.
I could read even out of the fourth reader. They had me read the 19th
psalm, 'The heavens declare the glory of God', and I read that. Said, 'Well,
I guess I'll put you in the third grade.' That was something that stayed with
the other kids. They kind of envied me ...
The Frenzels were German Lutherans, who originally were members of St. John's
Evangelical Lutheran Church, located at the present site of the Drawe Cemetery near
Round Top. In 1873, the congregation joined a group from Warrenton to form the
German Evangelical Lutheran Church of that town. The records of the earlier church
have been preserved and have provided the family with dates of baptisms and confirma-

80 / HISTORIC SITE TESTING

tions for their ancestors. Frenzel family members, including Andreas, Wilhelmine,
Richard, and Lizzie, are buried at the public cemetery in Waldeck.
FIELD TESTING

A total of 18 test units were excavated at the Frenzel Site (41FY448) within the
construction right-of-way (Fig. 20). The 346 artifacts recovered from the test units are
summarized by major artifact categories in Table 13.
All categories of artifacts were found in the upper 10 to 15 cm of the compact clayey
soil. Eleven of the 18 test units were in traffic areas for farm equipment, automobiles
and cattle, where the soil was a densely compact, dark brown clay. Sandstone was
encountered at the bottom of one or two of the units near the barn.

Table 14 presents tabulati ons of the artifacts by functional categories. The domestic
category has the largest representation at 42%. This category includes small fragments
of glass, metal, and some bone, but no ceramics were recovered in any test units.
Percentages for the farm-maintenance and architectural-construction categories are
approximately equal, representing 28% and 27%of the artifacts, respectively. Personal
items account for only 3% of the recovered artifacts, but the majority of the test units
were placed around the barn where the expectation for personal items was low.
The Frenzel Site dates from 1935, when the house was moved onto the property. The
multi-leveled barn was built about 1951 and the back shed portion was added on later,
creating the saltbox line of the roof. The artifacts recovered during the testing confirm
a relatively late date of occupation. Rubber fan belt fragments, plastic strapping, and
Barq's root beer bottle fragments illustrate a modern array of artifacts. Many artifacts
reflect the farm-maintenance and machine repair shop activities of the inhabitants.

INVESTIGATIONS AT FOUR HISTORIC SITES
WITHIN THE WALDECK COMMUNITY
Henry B. Moncure, Wayne Bartholomew and Leland C. Bement
History of Waldeck
Waldeck is a small hamlet located 14 miles north-northwest of the county seat, La
Grange, at the periphery of the proposed Cummins Creek Mine (Fig. 4). The community
lies within the John Vanderworth League, a property which passed from the original
grantee to a speculator and, in 1856, was purchased by a La Grange store owner, Robert
Zapp. Zapp soon began sales of his property to prospective settlers and farmers and in
1859 opened a store at what was to become Waldeck. As was the case in many instances
within the county, the store became the center of commerce in the area, as postal facility,
voting location, and focal point of social and business activity. The hamlet which
developed around the store was originally known as Long Prairie after the physiographic
area in which it lies. As Zapp continued to sell off parts of his league through the 1860s,
the hamlet grew in population and facilities to serve the needs of the increasing number
of farms. Based on voter records, the maximum number of people associated with
Waldeck reached a peak in the mid-1870s when the voters from the town and farmers
from the surrounding six leagues reached 135. A better idea of actual local population
density is obtained from the 1878 voter records, following a redistricting which reduced
the area served to around two and a half leagues. A total vote of 39 persons, all adult
males, indicates the actual population of the voting district was perhaps five times that
many, although the hamlet itself could probably claim no more than two dozen persons,
men, women and children.
In addition to the store, the hamlet proper consisted of a church, cotton gin, molasses
press, smithy, cemetery, school and a few houses. It should be noted that all these were
not concentrated in a nuclear town. The church, cemetery, school, and most of the houses
are far from the crossroads of County Roads 112 and 114. During the middle decades of
this century, the ginning activity, molasses press, school and much of the mercantile
functions of the town were lost to other centers or were rendered obsolete. The smithy
evolved into an auto repair shop and then went out of business. Today the crossroads
consist of a small country store, a few houses, and a few outbuildings. No extant structure
was affected by road upgrading.
Data collection accomplished over two periods (June 3 through 7 and June 25 through
28,1985) included hand and auger excavation, backhoe trenching, sifting of backdirt, and
surface collecting (Fig. 21). During the first week of testing, a 5 x 5 meter grid was
established and 78 test units were hand excavated. On instructions from the Texas State
Historical Commission, 118 auger tests were machine dug following a new grid system
plotted by LCRA surveyors. Initial hand excavated units were felt to be inadequate

because the pits were not all a standard size and because the pits did not appear to
penetrate the ground surface sufficiently so as to adequately recover and define the
artifact distribution at the Waldeck sites.
Description of Sites

Three of the investigated sites, the smithy location (41FY418), cotton gin (41FY419),
and house site (41FY446), are adjacent to one another just east of County Road 112 and
on either side of County Road 114 (Fig. 21). Subsurface testing of the site of the second
Bell Settlement school was restricted to right-of-way extensions, a very limited stretch
paralleling the existing county road. Summaries of known information concerning each
site follow.
SMITHY LOCATION- 41FY418

The former blacksmith shop is today marked only by an iron hitching ring imbedded
in a tree along with the remnants of three strands of barbed wire of non-diagnostic type
(Fig. 22b). The area which it once occupied is now a pasture. No surface artifact scatter
attributable to the shop is evident, possibly because the pasture surface shows undulations attributable to disking in the recent past.
According to informants, the smithy originally consisted of a shop building, storage
shed with a garage shed added in later times, and outdoor area where cattle and swine
were butchered. None of the structures had underlying stone foundations, but the board
and batten shop stood on wooden piers. The sheds, also board and batten, had dirt floors
and were set directly on the ground. Blacksmith Rudolph Manske used the storage shed
to hold coffins which he sold as a sideline. About 1955, all operations having long since
ceased at this location, these structures were torn down and some of the lumber salvaged
according to Mr. Harvey Albers, an informant who assisted in that episode.
THE COTTON GIN COMPLEX -41FY419

With the exception of the well, now capped with modern materials, the sole remnants
of these former businesses are the small foundations which once supported the structures.
These are in a malaligned row paralleling County Road 114 east-southeast of the smithy,
commencing 70 meters (230 ft) from the intersection of the two county roads (Fig. 22a).
Foundation blocks A and C are, according to informants, those of the gin. Each still
contains lag bolts of American standard thread pitch and of standard English sizes (A"
and /8") set into the concrete, with hex-headed nuts still in place. The larger of the two,
the T-shaped foundation A (4.2 meters total length, 3 meters across the T) has a
substantial section of mill cut lumber attached to the left arm of the cross and a small
rectangular concrete foundation segment (1.1 meters x 38 cm) is in place beneath this
same arm and parallel to the T stem. It also still holds /4" lag bolts. The smaller gin
foundation, C, is a 1.56 meter by 1.22 meter rectangle with six A" lag bolts protruding
from it and an unattached molded concrete segment lying on it. It sits 9 meters (30 ft)

88 / HISTORIC SITE TESTING

from foundation A. The gin operated at this location from the turn of the century until
about 1912 when the owner, John Knutzen, relocated to Round Top.
Foundation B is attributed by the informants to the former molasses press. It is
located 23 meters (75 ft) east of Foundation A and consists of two small concrete slabs,
the larger 1.5 by 1.03 meters and the smaller 1.3 by .13 meter, about 2.5 meters apart.
The larger one has two short lengths of 5x5" lumber attached to it by lag bolts set in the
concrete. The smaller slab lacks bolts and sits with its upper surface on a slant, suggesting
it has been moved from its original location.
The well is adjacent to the gin Foundation A, immediately to the south. The cover is
a recent, box-like top with hinged doors, one of which is open. The top, placed to keep
pastured livestock from falling into the well, was mismatched undercut lumber and
miscellaneous hinges and bolts, characteristic of construction from salvaged materials.
The well is deep enough to reach the present water table about 20 feet down and is lined,
at least to the water level, with coursed stone. The inner diameter is 27 inches and is so
circularly regular it implies a machine auger was used to excavate the hole. Informants
do not recall the well as part of the gin complex when that facility was functioning.
THE HOUSE LOCATION -41FY466

Sandstone foundation blocks and a bulldozed pile of bricks mark this former house
site between the gin and the smithy on the east side of a farm lane (Fig. 22c). Through
local informants it was learned that the house had been moved onto the property and
later removed to the Hughes Farm where it was recorded as 41FY290 (Nightengale and
Jackson 1983:96). The original location of the structure and the dates of moving could
not be reconstructed. Testing as part of the gin smithy complex uncovered a stone slab
patio extending from the eastern foundation line and domestic artifacts that indicated
the structure was used as a domicile while in its Waldeck location.
THE SECOND BELL SETTLEMENT SCHOOL-41FY400

Bell Settlement is an imprecise term derived from the name of land speculator James
C. Bell who, in the late nineteenth century, sold much of the Elias Gilpin land grant in
small farm-sized segments. The settlers who moved into the area within a few years of
each other became known as the Bell Settlement in much the same fashion as today's
developer subdivisions are labeled. The actual extent of Bell lands is exceeded by the
area which came to be loosely referred to by that name.
About the turn of the century, a primary school was established in the area, one of
thirteen established within the Round Top-Carmine School District. That school, the
first Bell Settlement School, is said to have been in a private home. J.W. Neese, in
1898-99, is the first recorded teacher at the facility, which usually had only a single teacher
at a time (Krause 1976:80, 83). According to Mr. Kermit Blume of Ledbetter, who taught
at Bell Settlement between 1935 and 1938, the second school, a building constructed
specifically for that purpose, and built about 1920, is represented at site 41FY400.

OVERLAND CONVEYOR CORRIDOR I 89

Bell Settlement's second school was originally a one-room rectangular building with
concrete steps at the front entrance. The balloon frame construction was covered with
overlapping "drop" siding elevated on concrete piers arranged horizontally and roofed
with corrugated tin. This roof had gutters that fed a cistern, the water supply. About
1930, a second, slightly more elevated room was added to the rear of the original building.
The double doors that separated the rooms opened to allow the newer one to be used as
a stage when desired (Blume 1985, personal communication). This school was described
by Mr. Blume as "the bare necessities." The entire school complex consisted of the
one/two room building, separate privies for girls and boys, a baseball diamond and a
volleyball/basketball court (Fig. 23).
By 1944, all the schools of the Round Top-Carmine School District were consolidated,
consumating a process which began in 1938. Bell Settlement, along with the schools at
Nechanitz and Waldeck, was one of the last to be absorbed (Krause 1976:84). Improved
transportation, a better road system and the demands of multigrade education brought
about and made feasible the consolidation. The building stood idle until about 1950 when
it was purchased by a La Grange businessman and moved. Only the concrete front steps
and two cedar post stubs remain along with a concrete curb/foundation in the location of
the girl's privy. Vegetation, some of it sizeable trees and shrubs, has obscured all trace
of the athletic fields and courts. The area has a thin surface trash scatter in which no fine
grained diagnostics were noted and no items indicative of an age other than that stated
by informants were found.

90 / HISTORIC SITE TESTING

Methods
THE SMITHY, THE GIN AND THE HOUSE

Archival sources, including county records, state records, the archives of The University of Texas' several libraries, those of the history center of the La Grange library as well
as the county files of the Texas Archeological Research Laboratory, were specifically
reviewed for Waldeck/Aschen's Store/Long Prairie references. Long-time local residents were interviewed as were a number of former residents still living in the general
area. During the pedestrian survey of the affected area, structural remnants were
mapped and photographed.
A total of 78 hand-excavated test units, 118 auger tests and 9 backhoe trenches, three
at each site, were dug. In addition, a bulldozer swath was placed perpendicular to the
road, bisecting the house site, in anticipation of construction of a culvert. Augered test
pits ranged in depth from 3 to 63 cm below ground surface, depending on the depth of
surface soil and the degree of previous surface disturbance(s). A 1982 Soil Conservation
Service (SCS) survey identifies the soils as belonging to the Wilson series of "somewhat
poorly drained, very slowly permeable soils .. formed on old alluvium or nearly impervious marine clay." The A soil horizon ranges in depth from 0 to 5 inches (0-12.7 cm).
Although this horizon is "very hard and firm" when dry, it is relatively easy to dig
compared to the "extremely hard, very fine B horizon . .. which consists of 30 to 50%
montmorillonitic clays" (Soil Conservation Service 1982). Agricultural modifications
such as plowing or the redistribution of backfill from nearby watering tanks, artificially
added to or subtracted from the A soil horizon. Because excavation through this horizon
was not an insurmountable problem, test pit depth would usually vary in accordance with
the thickness of this overlying horizon. However, neither hand nor auger tests were able
to penetrate more than a few cm into the underlying B horizon.
Artifacts are primarily concentrated in the A horizon, although 0.4 to 0.8 inch wide
cracks which extend to depths of 24 inches according to SCS, resulted in the infiltration
of some artifacts into lower levels. The spoil from all augered holes was screened for
artifacts. In addition, a backhoe excavated two east-west trenches, 10 meters by approximately 65 cm wide by approximately 60 cm deep. A bulldozer also inadvertently
removed several large oak trees adjacent to the site. Artifacts were collected by hand
from the backdirt of these two operations. Table 15 presents a summary of cultural
materials collected from all Waldeck sites.
BELL SETTLEMENT SCHOOL

The site was recorded using standard Texas Historical Commission site forms and
photographs during the pedestrian survey described in Nightengale, Jackson, and Moncure 1985. State, county and Fayette County Historical Center archives were researched
along with the libraries of The University of Texas and those of the Texas Archeological
Research Laboratory. Informants Alma Shultz and Kermit Blume, who taught at Bell
Settlement (Kermit Blume succeeding his brother Edgar in that capacity) and students
Emit Mueller and Lorene Fisher provided a description of the school.

Summary
During current investigations, the former locations of a smith, gin and molasses press,
now long defunct, and a former house location within the community of Waldeck were
recorded and archival and informant sources researched. The results of systematic data
collection provide little new information useful to site interpretation. As expected, scrap
metal and auto parts were dense in the area of the blacksmith shop-auto repair shop.
Domestic refuse identified the house site and the gin material culture was mixed.
The Bell Settlement School, 41FY400, is a remnant of a small community, primary
school system which operated for 46 years, the last 24 of these in this location. Visible
site remains are limited to front and back steps of the school and the concrete base of an
outhouse. Results of current data collection indicate that artifactual materials associated
with the school are sparse and provide little additional information concerning use of the
site. The majority of recovered materials were modern discards along the roadway.

ASSESSMENT AND TESTING AT
THE AHSCHLAGER TENANT HOUSE 41FY413
Steven M. Kotter
Site 41FY413 is located at the margin of the upland summit overlooking a branch of
Jones Creek, a Rabbs Creek tributary. Vegetation within the creek valley is a climax post
oak/juniper/pine woodland, but upland areas have been cleared of trees for pasturage.
Sandy surface soils are eroding from the upland margin and being deposited on the slope
below. Two clayey subsoil units are evident in the walls of the borrow pit and surficially
exposed by erosion. Although the reddish clay overlies a dark gray unit, the distribution
of subsoils is complex and either subsoil unit may directly underlie the sandy soil,
depending on location within the site. The upper portion of the Catahoula Formation
has also been exposed by borrow activities.
The Ahschlager Tenant House was one of three similar structures built on land owned
by Wenzel Matejowski and his decendents during the early twentieth century. Although
none are extant, the basic floor plan was the same as the Bernhausen-Koopman House,
41FY297, but without the loft (Nightengale and Jackson 1983:66-67). Mrs. Ahschlager,
who occupied the site with her family between 1922 and 1925, recalls the rectangular
four-room, end-gabled house. Two front bedrooms on the south side of the house were
identical to two rooms, a kitchen and a dining room on the north side. The house was
entered via an open porch on the southeast side of the house. Construction was vertical
board and batten. The only other structure mentioned by Mrs. Ahschlager is a barn used
to house horses and a cow. Water was brought in from a well somewhere to the west of
the site. Corn and cotton were the primary cash crops grown. Mrs. Ahschlager did not
remember other later tenants, but rather use of the house for storage until it finally
collapsed.
Site Description
Current site remains consist of sandstone foundation stones, old fence lines and
artifactual materials within an area approximately 60 by 50 meters in size (Fig. 24). The
former house location is apparently marked by an area of upland sandy soil between the
borrow pit and the valley slope and protected beneath the house from erosion. The front
of the house probably faced south toward the borrow pit, with the long axis being
east/west. The western edge of extant soil coincides with a cedar post and wire fenceline
that apparently separated the house and yard from other portions of the homestead.
Displaced foundation stones within this area are concentrated at the western edge and
near the fence.
Other extant historic features include the partial foundations of two small outbuildings, a depression, and an additional fence line. Foundation stones just west of the house
location define a structure of unknown function approximately 1.5 meters on a side. The
other outbuilding, located on the valley slope, is less defined, but there is no evidence of

a barn or other extensive structure on the site. A shallow depression can be observed at
the eastern edge of the apparent house location. Investigations were not able to determine feature function, but a buried cistern is not represented. The second fenceline
appears to mark the extent of a former pasture, and at one time may have connected with
the fence adjacent to the house. Artifactual materials occur scattered throughout the site
area, but no concentrations of trash were observed which might indicate a buried dump.
Summary of Investigations

Work performed at the site consisted of transit mapping and excavation. The initial
test unit was placed west of the house location, near the partially intact outbuilding
foundation where surface artifacts were abundant. Unit 1 was excavated primarily to
characterize the gray, clayey subsoil unit which apparently predates human occupation
of the area. Although the reddish-colored unit overlies the gray unit, it too is assumed
to be devoid of cultural materials not mechanically displaced from the overlying sandy
soil. The final test, Unit 7, was also dug into clayey subsoil in order to define the
depression at the eastern edge of the house location. Mixing of soils and other matrix,
expected if the feature was a filled cistern, extended only 5 to 10 cm below the surface.
The majority of test units, units 2 through 6, were placed to assess cultural deposits
buried within the sandy soil near the apparent house location. Units 2 and 4 are at the
assumed front of the house (Unit 4 near the front porch), and Units 3 and 5 along the
upper portion of the slope within the assumed backyard. To corroborate house location
and orientation, Unit 6 was excavated in an area that would have been under the center
of the house. Between 8 and 26 cm of loose to moderately compacted sandy soil occur,
with slightly deeper soils in Units 3, 4, and 5. Historic and prehistoric remains are
thoroughly mixed, with surficial prehistoric materials and historic materials resting on
clay.
DESCRIPTION OF CULTURAL MATERIALS

Cultural materials recovered during testing include the 452 historic items listed by
material in Table 17. Descriptions of the historic artifacts, and discussion of their
distributions, are presented by functional category, and summarized in Table 18 which
lists the kinds of materials and associated function within each category (Figs. 25, 26).
Table 19 describes the distribution of functional categories in terms of the percentages
of the total recovered from each test unit and of each category within individual units.
Construction nails and window pane, not including the foundation stones described
previously, comprise nearly 30% of the total materials. The cut nails appear to date from
the original house construction near the turn of the century, and are widely but unevenly
distributed. The significant number of nails in each unit except 1 and 7 (Fig. 25a),
appears to corroborate house location. The unusually high number of nails in Unit 4 may
have accumulated during house demolition or other activity. The scarcity and localized
distribution of wire nails indicates limited maintenance or repair, not inconsistent with
tenant occupations. The majority of flat glass specimens are interpreted as fragments of

window panes broken during all phases of the house's history. Distribution of window
pane fragments appears to confirm that the placement of Unit 6 was beneath the center
of the house since the numbers are lower than units 2 through 5 which were placed at
either edge of the supposed house location (Fig. 25a).
Domestic materials that comprise over 66% of the total materials, are varied but all
are the result of normal household functions (Fig. 26). Ceramics include white
stoneware, mostly undecorated, and glazed earthenware which represents dishes and
storage crocks, respectively, made during the twentieth century. Bottle glass provides
evidence of the use of a variety of machine-made commercial containers of various shapes
and colors. The presence of a lantern chimney probably dates the occupation of the site
to before about 1940 when electricity was introduced. The majority of the metal appears
to be can fragments. The few bone fragments recovered are from domestic cow. The
distribution of the various domestic materials (Fig. 26) provides evidence of yard
patterning north (Units 3 and 5) and south (Unit 4) of the house. The relative abundance
of ceramics, bottle glass and lantern chimney in Units 3 and 5 clearly define differences

the exception of tin metal.
Only about 1% of historic materials recovered are juvenile in nature. Items of
playâporcelain doll fragments, toy cup fragment and a marble âoccur north and east of
the house location (Fig. 25b). The single educational artifact, a slate tablet fragment, is
from Unit 6 beneath the house. In sum, the artifact recovery from 41FY413 is entirely
consistent with its function as a tenant house as described by former occupants. No
unusual or significant items were recorded and the house site was never home to
individuals of regional or local historic importance. The site does, however, represent a
number of similar houses in the Cummins Creek Prospect that served the immediate
needs of tenants in the post-World War I era. The potential of the site deposits has been
fully explored by the testing program and no further work is recommended.

SUMMARY

Three historic sites, all farmsteads, were recorded within the boundaries of the
proposed conveyor corridor. Two of the sites, 41FY445, the Zingelmann Site and
41FY447,the Tschiedel Site, represented agricultural development in Fayette County
from around the turn of the century through the 1940s. The third site, 41FY448, the
Frenzel Site, was not developed until the 1930s. 41FY445 and 41FY448 remain largely
intact and were occupied and functioning as farms until recently. The farmhouse at
41FY447 has been razed, although a barn and windmill were still present at the time the
survey was conducted.
Field testing was conducted at each of the three sites, but provided only minimal data
recovery. In each case, the amount of archival and informant documentation far outweighed the buried artifactual remains. Oral history interviews, involving former
occupants of the properties, were conducted for each of the sites. In addition, family
records, historic photographs, and courthouse collections were utilized extensively. Architectural features at the sites were documented appropriately using large format
photography.
The two intact sites, 41FY445 and 41FY448, were the easiest to document orally;
little, if any, of the relevant site data was left to conjecture. On the Tschiedel site
(41FY447), a direct descendant of the builders was able to provide a detailed floorplan
of the house along with early photographs of the family in front of the structure.
The three sites are representative of early twentieth-century farmsteads throughout
the area of Fayette County populated by Germans. The cultural and historical backgrounds of the sites has been adequately explored through a variety of means and no
further work is recommended.

PREHISTORIC SITE TESTING

INTRODUCTION
Steven M. Rotter

The results of testing at four prehistoric sites in areas where ancillary facilities were
planned are summarized in this section of the report. Site 41FY442, on Clear Creek, a
tributary of Cummins Creek and within the Overland Conveyor corridor, was tested
during September, 1985. The other three are within the Mine Permit Area along Rabbs
Creek tributaries. Sites 41FY336, within the transmission line right-of-way, and
41FY362, to be impacted by road construction, are adjacent to Owl Creek. The fourth
site tested, 41FY264, is within the Jones Creek basin and was to be affected by road
construction. The three mine sites were tested during September and December of 1985,
and January of 1986. Sites are presented in numerical order beginning with site 41FY264.
Assessment of the research potential of prehistoric sites was based on procedures
described in the Management Plan for the Fayette Power/ Rabbs-Cummins Creek Mine
Historic District (Kotter et al. 1987) which outlines three primary research goals. Information yield potential relative to these goals was first defined during field investigation
based on the nature and apparent context of the cultural materials present. Confirmation
of the field assessment was then to be obtained by preliminary analysis of results which
could be used to justify either continued investigations or cessation of work. In the case
of site 41FY264, initial stage analysis was part of the report preparation phase, since field
investigations at the mine have been discontinued. If the information yield potential was
moderate to high, the contribution of known site data to each of the research goals was
then defined. Continued work was justified only at sites with a positive information yield
potential, where the research goals could not be addressed by current data.

SITE41FY264

Steven M. Kotter
Prehistoric site 41FY264 is one of a series of small occupations located on landforms
adjacent to Jones Creek, between its headwaters and its confluence with Owl Creek
(Nightengale, Jackson, and Moncure 1985). The site is situated on an inside meander
along the left bank of the primary creek branch, approximately 2 km from the stream
headwaters. Above and east of the site is a low, flat crested divide which separates Jones
Creek and an Owl Creek tributary. Across the creek to the west and upstream, the valley
has steeply sloping walls and a narrow floor. The valley downstream from the site is much
more broad and open.
The meander interior containing the site is gently sloping and bounded by a high
vertical bluff at either end. Construction of a creek crossing, part of an earlier road
system, has destroyed the central portion of the site by reducing the bank slopes to clayey
subsoil. The road effectively divides the wooded site into eastern and western halves,
each of which includes the creek bank, a relatively flat area above the bank, and a gentle
bank slope (Fig. 27). Cultural materials are exposed in the roadbed, but were not
observed on the surface or at the high banks which bound the site.
The initial survey and recording of 41FY264 resulted in the recovery of six projectile
points. At that time, five were typed as Ensor dart points and one as an unusually large
Scallorn arrow point (Nightengale and Jackson 1983:92). These surface finds are included in the following discussion with the Scallorn point reclassified as a Darl dart point
(Fig. 28a) and with one Ensor point reassigned to the as-yet informally defined Sandbur
type (Fig. 28e).
Summary of Investigations

Initial work at the site consisted of a surface examination and review of known site
data. The distribution of surficial materials appeared to indicate that occupation was
associated with the sloping meander interior rather than the high banks, a distribution
seen at other sites. Prior to excavations, a primary east/west grid line paralleling the bank
was established, connecting the separated areas of the site. Initial tests were placed off
of this line in order to verify the concentration of visible materials west of the road (Unit
1) and to provide preliminary assessment data from east of the road (Unit 2). Negative
results from Unit 1 were expected since the relative concentration of cultural debris was
recoved to the east.
West of the road, very sparse lithics and scattered, small burned rocks were equally
distributed within 50 cm of sandy soil overlying a clayey subsoil in Unit 1. A light organic
staining of the upper 15 cm and a lighter color and larger grain size in the lower 15 cm

were the only soil differences noted. Significant site deposits, if present west of the road,
were nearer the toe of the slope. Although more numerous than in Unit 1, cultural
materials from Unit 4 were confined to scattered burned rocks and lithic flakes. Soil
morphology was similar, but depth of surface soils was greater, approximately 70 cm.
At this point, effort was concentrated in the area of potentially significant site deposits
east of the road. Unit 3 was begun adjacent to Unit 2 in order to fully expose Feature 1
and define its stratigraphic context. Excavations documented a lens of culturally stained
soil located between 40 and 80 cm below the surface which separated near-surface
deposits from the coarser sand above clay at 110 cm. The presence of woody charcoal
and projectile points, as well as a clearly defined soil stratigraphy, indicated that specific
site components could be separated and defined by additional investigations.
Three 50 x 50 cm units were placed around Units 2 and 3, except in the direction of
the road, to determine the extent of deposits. Unit 5 results indicated that the main site
area does not include the toe of the bank, which is more steeply and irregularlysloping
than that west of the road. Artifacts found above the creek bank in Unit 7 were only
slightly more numerous, but were concentrated at a level which may correspond to the
intensive occupation identified in Units 2 and 3. However, culturally stained soil was
noted only further east in Unit 6, which was later expanded to 1 x 1 meter in size. The
additional excavations recovered more abundant scattered burned rock than in Units 2
and 3.

108 / PREHISTORIC SITE TESTING

The final site test, Unit 8, was placed adjacent to Unit 4, west of the road, in order to
obtain a larger sample of potentially distinctive materials identified during preliminary
analysis. Feature 2 and a portion of another small rock hearth were shallowly buried and
may post-date the cultural zone identified east of the road. Associated artifactual
remains, however, were sparse and undistinctive.
Feature Descriptions
Features recognized during current investigations at site 41FY264 are limited to two
small rock pavements designated as Features 1 and 2. Small rock pavements are contiguous arrangements of burned rocks which are circular in shape, flat-laid and less than
one meter in diameter.
FEATURE 1

Feature 1, a disturbed rock pavement uncovered in Level 4 of Units 2 and 3, is
approximately 65 cm in diameter and consists of 6640.5 grams of burned rocks. Feature
fill is not distinct but matrix between rocks and a large chunk of charcoal were collected.
This sample rendered a radiocarbon age of 1920Â±60 (Tx-5549). A large unburned
sandstone boulder, several small burned rocks, and two tools (Fig. 29a) comprise a
surface above the feature in Level 3.
FEATURE 2

Feature 2 is an intact rock pavement in Level 2 of Unit 8 (Fig. 29b). Although
disturbed during excavation, the rocks concentrate in an area approximately 40 cm in
diameter and weigh 2562 grams. The scatter of burned rocks in the southeast corner of
the unit may represent another small hearth which, with Feature 2, represents a distinct
surface.
Artifact Descriptions
This section of the report briefly summarizes major categories of cultural materials
and detailed descriptions of distinctive artifacts and debitage. Results, organized by
material type and representative technology, are provided in the tables below.

Remains within the cobble sequence consist of a single grinding stone and several
hammerstones. No chert or petrified wood cobbles of useful size occur either on site or
near the creek, and both hammerstones and siliceous raw materials were obtained
elsewhere and brought to the site. Sandstone does outcrop and there is evidence, in the
form of sandstone flakes, of procurement and alteration of this resource.

110 / PREHISTORIC SITE TESTING

Tools
The grinding stone is a fragment of a tabular sandstone slab shaped to form a rough
circle 9.5 cm in diameter and 2.8 cm thick. Tool edges have been modified by flaking, but
are not smoothed. The single utilized surface is smoothed and slightly basin-shaped and,
although the size of a handstone, may have been used as a slab. The hammerstones are
fist-sized cobbles of hard quartzite battered and/or flaked at one end through use.
Debitage
The five sandstone flakes from the site, which range in length between 5 and 12 cm,
appear to represent waste from the manufacture of tools, probably grinding slabs or
metates.
BIFACIAL SEQUENCE

Over 80% of cultural material recovered from site 41FY264 is classified within the
bifacial sequence (Tables 20 and 21). Although the bulk of these materials are soft-hammer and pressure flakes, six unfinished tools and six manufacturing failures are also
represented.
Tools
All of the bifacial tools (Table 20) recovered from both testing and surface collecting
are dart points. Half of the six specimens are side-notched and fall within the Ensor type
(Fig. 28b,c). Also represented are single examples of Travis (Fig. 28g) and Sandbur (Fig.
28e) types, and an untyped corner-notched point.
Discards
Discards from the manufacture of bifacial tools include abundant soft-hammer and
pressure flakes, as well as six stage bifaces (Table 21). All but one of the stage bifaces, a
broad rectangular knife manufacturing failure, are partially reduced dart points. A
leaf-shaped, thin biface similar to the Hare type (Prewitt 1981:104) is assumed to be a
dart point preform (Fig. 28f). The remaining specimens, two Ensor and two Pedernales
point failures (Fig. 28h,i), have been sufficiently worked to identify tool function and
type.
CORE FLAKE SEQUENCE

The core flake sequence at the Jones Crossing site, which consists of seven cores, all
hard-hammer flakes, and six tools comprises about 17% of the materials recovered.

Tools

The six flake tools are equally divided between concave scrapers (Table 22) and
utilized flakes (Table 23). Two of the concave scrapers are thick hard-hammer flakes,
one of which has been modified, with bit angles of 66Â°and 83Â°. The third is a soft-hammer
flake with two concave surfaces and low bit angles of approximately 40Â°. Flakes utilized
as scrapers include two which are blade proportioned (one a thinning flake, the other a
single-facet platform) and a soft-hammer flake that may be a true blade. The remaining
utilized specimen is a hard-hammer flake. Regardless of the presence of a blade technology, there appears to have been a preference for long, thin flakes for use as tools.

Debitage
Debitage from flake production includes four bifacial and three platform cores, in
addition to hard-hammer flakes. Both the number and variety of cores recovered appears
out of proportion to the flake tools identified and to the core flake sequence in general.
The reason for this discrepancy is unknown, since none of the cores are large enough to
have produced flakes suitable for reduction to dart points or other large bifacial tools.
The only flake tool not used as a scraper is a perforator made of petrified wood,
recovered from the surface. The specimen is roughly oval in shape, 37 mm in length, 14
mm in maximum width, and 8 mm in maximum thickness. Tool edges have been shaped
and smoothed by grinding. A 7-mm long projection at one end has been further smoothed
by use as a perforator.
BONE TOOLS

The only preserved non-lithic tool is the medial portion of a bone awl recovered from
Level 2 in Unit 2. The 20-mm long, 14-mm wide fragment is half of a long bone of a
medium- to large-sized mammal, which has been split and smoothed along the exposed
edges. Although the tip is missing, use as an awl or perforator is assumed based on the
known tool types from this area.
Soil and Cultural Stratigraphy
Primary evidence of sequential occupations at site 41FY264 consists of apparent soil
stratigraphy and feature distribution within the eastern site area. The culturally stained
zone observed in Units 2, 3, and 6 clearly separates a relatively intensive period of
occupation from both earlier and later site deposits. The integrity of both the features
and the soil discoloration indicates that the zone represents a consistent temporal
marker. However, the restricted distribution of cultural staining limits its application to
other site areas, where differences in soil may not be culturally meaningful.
Some indication of cultural stratigraphy west of the road is provided by Feature 2 and
the results of Units 4 and 8. Differences between this feature and Feature 1, as well as
between associated materials, appear to indicate that different occupations are represented.
Socio-temporal affiliations of the defined site occupations are clearly documented
only for the coarse sand above clay, where two Middle Archaic components occur in
mixed context. Recovery of Travis and Pedernales dart points date the initial occupation
to as early as 4600 years B.P. during the Clear Fork equivalent phase, and continuing into
the Round Rock equivalent phase between 2600 and 3400 years B.R (Prewitt 1981). The
calibrated radiocarbon date of 1881Â±65 years B.P. (TX 5549: 1920Â±60 years B.P.) obtained from Feature 1, associated with the Uvalde phase, corresponds to the earlier part
of the Late Archaic in Central Texas (Prewitt 1981). Two Ensor-type dart points, in
addition to surficial artifacts, date later site occupations to the Late Archaic period.
Since the majority of identified points date to the Twin Sisters equivalent phase, the

cultural horizon marking relatively intensive occupation east of the road may be associated with this phase. The most recent site occupation within the upper tan fine sand
would date to the later Driftwood equivalent phase, represented in the surface collection.
In order to more clearly differentiate and define site components, the unit levels
excavated are grouped into three distinct periods of occupation. The association of
levels, shown in a series of profiles through the site (Fig. 30a,b), is uncertain only in Units
1, 5, and 7, located at the periphery. Group 1 (Table 24) includes Levels 1 and 2, which
are characterized by sparse small pressure flakes and are associated with Feature 2 in
Unit 8. Group 2 consists of the cultural zone in Units 2,3, and 6 (Levels 2 and 4), as well

as the lower levels of other units. Group 3 includes deposits beneath the cultural zone
and is restricted to Units 2, 3, and 6.
Extent and Intrasite Variability
Results of investigations indicate that the main site area is on the sloping portion of
the meander interior at or below the creek bank. Materials are concentrated within an
area approximately 30 x 10 meters in size which extends on either side of, and is truncated
by, the road. Units 1 and 7, placed on the flat above the bank, as well as Unit 5, placed
at the toe of the slope, are outside the main area.
The initial occupation area is apparently restricted to the eastern area, but once
extended west at least to the road, where a Pedernales dart point failure was collected
from the surface. This horizontal distribution conforms to an area where sandy surface
soils are deepest; it is possible that stratigraphically equivalent soils are absent or very
thin over other areas. The steeply sloping subsoil surface noted in Unit 6 may indicate
that the occupation follows an older clay bank which was buried when stream movement
created the present meander.
Later occupations are present throughout the site, but exhibit considerable horizontal
variability. An intensive area of hearth construction and other activities during the
Uvalde occupation is clearly marked by culturally stained soil east of the road. Cultural
materials are three to six times more numerous here than in Units 4 and 8, and more
varied as well. Specific clusters of artifact types within this approximately 7 by 2 meter
area of features include cores and utilized flakes (Units 2 and 3), and large sandstone

116 / PREHISTORIC SITE TESTING

flakes (Unit 6). Activities west of the road were not as intensive, but included limited
tool use and ubiquitous lithic processing.
Summary of Site Occupations
The three occupational episodes defined for site 41FY264 are based on a number of
indices and comparisons (Table 25). Both the separation of levels representing each
episode and the integrity of the corresponding deposits are felt to be fairly good. The
only potentially diagnostic artifact which could not be assigned to a specific occupation
is a rectangular knife manufacturing failure. Since only a single example is represented,
its inclusion would not substantially change the interpretation of basic site function and
activities.
TOOL USE

Six different tool types are represented at the Jones Crossing Site, a maximum of four
by any component. Only projectile points and concave scrapers are common to each.
The Middle and Late Archaic tool inventories are similar, the only difference being the
presence of a hammerstone with the later occupation. Associated dart points and varied
scrapers suggest basic subsistence and equipment maintenance activities. The Driftwood
phase inventory is somewhat more varied with the addition of a grinding stone and bone
awl, although flake scrapers which occur in earlier occupations are absent. If possible
differences in organic preservation are ignored, the awl may indicate expanded equipment maintenance during the final site occupation. Grinding stones, which are not
common in the Rabbs Creek Basin, are associated with subsistence activities, particularly
hard seed processing.
LITHIC TOOL MANUFACTURE

Although the bifacial reduction sequence dominated the lithic remains during each
occupation, significant variation can also be noted. The very high percentage of
soft-hammer and especially pressure flakes associated with the Driftwood phase reflects
the importance of final stage biface reduction and formal tool production during this
time. However, associated stage bifaces are limited to a dart point preform. Although
the higher percentage of materials for early occupations may be in part related to the
presence of hard-hammer bifacial debitage, there appears to be a real decline in the
importance of informal tools during the Driftwood occupation. Flake tools and cores are
limited in number to single specimens of each, and the tool is on an unmodified
soft-hammer flake which might represent fortuitous use.
During the Uvalde Phase, tool production goals and corresponding reduction
strategies are apparently more varied. Not only are core flake remains more abundant,
but cores are more numerous and varied, and utilized flakes show evidence of core
preparation and/or modification. A true blade technology may also be represented. The
presence of large sandstone flakes appears to indicate that cobble tool production, in this

instance probably grinding stones, was a significant site activity. Bifacial tool reduction
was similar to the later Driftwood phase in that stage bifaces are few in number and are
limited to dart point failures. However, the higher percentage of soft-hammer flakes
relative to pressure flakes indicates on-site reduction of tool blanks.
Bifacial and core flake sequences are more equally represented during the apparent
Middle Archaic occupation. A relatively high percentage of hard-hammer flakes were
recovered, the majority of which appear to be the result of on-site cobble reduction. Two
partially reduced Pedernales dart point failures are additional evidence of working whole
petrified wood cobbles. Stage bifaces are few in number and include only dart point
failures. Cores are relatively abundant and there is some evidence of core preparation
and flake modification.
Summary
Although minor differences were noted during the previous discussions of feature and
tool use, the occupations exhibit a similar pattern of simple subsistence features, sparse
cultural materials, and a general tool inventory. Although the apparent intensity of use
varies, in each instance the occupations are felt to represent small seasonal encampments
established for the exploitation of a variety of resources. Theoretically, the groups
involved would be small but fully integrated; that is, all age and sex classes would be
included. The prevalence of this kind of site within the Rabbs Creek Basin, and the
absence or sparsity of base camps and resource-specific extraction sites, has been previously noted (Nightengale, Jackson and Moncure 1985; Nightengale n.d.)
The low number of features suggests both a small group size and short duration of
use. However, their clustered distribution indicates the intensity of use was sufficient to
organize site activities into core and peripheral areas. It is felt that incidental overnight
camping would not result in a distinctly patterned distribution of remains. The presence
of low numbers of subsistence artifacts and equipment maintenance tools, such as flake
scrapers and perforators, are also evidence of general camping activities. The number
and nature of both bifacial tools and stage failures are consistent with production of
formal tools as necessary to replenish curated stores. Fortuitous use of debitage for flake
tools and light use wear would also be expected at seasonal encampments.
Three aspects of the Uvalde phase occupation need to be discussed in light of the
expectations of hypothesized site function. Use, and apparently reuse, of the site is more
intense at this time than during either the earlier or later episodes. However, the higher
number of materials recovered only provide a greater sample of artifacts which corroborate basic site function. The noted increase in the effort expended in on-site,
informal tool production is not on the same scale as that at site 41FY442, which may be
extractive in nature. A slightly longer duration of use or a greater need for equipment
maintenance might account for the increased care in manufacture. Specific resource
extraction may be indicated by the absence of grinding stones and the presence of
debitage resulting from their production. Although the sample of deposits is not sufficient to preclude the use of grinding stones, estimates of the season of occupation
(discussed below) may provide additional evidence of extractive activity.

41FY264/H9

Of particular importance to defining apparent settlement is evidence of seasonality
from the later site occupations. The burned nut hulls recovered in association with the
Uvalde phase indicate occupation during the fall or winter. Hard seed processing using
grinding stones suggests that the Driftwood occupation centered on the summer months.
If the activities represented are accurately ascribed, both nut hulls and grinding stones
would not be associated, and working of sandstone during the Uvalde phase is more surely
extractive. Use of the site at different times of the year is also a possibility.
Assessments and Recommendations
The eight units excavated to culturally sterile clay provide sufficient data to assess the
information yield potential of site 41FY264. Two areas of intact features are present, but
only east of the road are associated cultural materials relatively abundant. The extent of
both areas is very restricted, and the major portion of the area west of the road may have
been destroyed during construction of the crossing. Although disturbed by bioturbation,
cultural deposits are sufficienty intact to separate sequential site occupations during both
excavation and later analysis. A zone of culturally stained soil dated by radiocarbon assay
provides a consistent temporal marker for the eastern area. Site history can probably be
reconstructed on the basis of data provided by geomorphological studies and current
testing results. Negative assessment factors include the general sparsity of cultural
materials, the low numbers of tools and tool types, and the poor preservation of non-lithic
materials.
According to the mine management plan, site assessments are made on the basis of
information potential relative to three research goals. Goal 1, an understanding of site
organization relative to topography and other environmental factors, is satisfied in part
by the identification of core areas for later occupations. Areas of intensive activity,
including hearth construction and surrounding scattered remains, can be associated with
different portions of the sloping meander interior. Access and proximity to the creek was
obviously an important factor in both the site selection and core area location. Middle
Archaic site physiography cannot be reconstructed on the basis of current data. Geomorphological investigations are needed before this period of site history can be fully
understood.
Goal 2, the definition and association of site occupations, is satisfied, especially
considering the sample of materials exposed on the surface by road construction. There
is little possibility that a major episode has been overlooked. The nature of each
occupation can be characterized (Goal 3) within the confines of sparse site remains
The research potential of site 41FY264 does not appear sufficient to warrant further
work, except possibly during geomorphological study of other sites in the area. Each of
the three research goals can be satisfied by information already available. The sparsity
and lack of diversity of cultural remains indicate that additional data collection would
not be scientifically productive.

SITE41FY336
Steven M. Kotter
Site 41FY336 is one of two prehistoric localities along the main branch of the Owl
Creek drainage that was investigated during the current testing program. The site is
located a little over 3 km from the headwaters between the confluence of converging
branches, on a slight rise that parallels a high bank where the southward-flowing creek
makes a right angle turn west. South and east of the site is the relatively flat divide
between Owl and Jones Creeks; north and west are dissected stream valley. An erosional
gulley has developed at the northern site boundary, deflating soils and exposing buried
cultural materials.
When originally recorded, only the eroded northern end of the site was within the
survey area, and no further work was recommended. Subsequent investigations for the
Winchester-Cummins-Salem transmission line identified an additional site area which
appeared more intact and was tested by the current project. Work was concentrated in
a linear clearing which includes the rise crest and extends to near the high bank overlooking the creek (Fig. 31). Micro-topographic mapping revealed that the site can be divided
into two areas, the rise crest which is separated into two lobes by a small gulley, and a
gentle slope to the creek bank.
Summary of Investigations
Prior to excavations, a primary grid line was established oriented to magnetic north
from the southern end of the site clearing to near the bank. The initial test was a
stratigraphic unit placed on the more prominent lobe of the rise crest approximately 32
meters away from the bank. Unit 1 revealed that sparse lithic flakes and tools were
scattered throughout 74 to 78 cm of sandy surface soil without apparent stratigraphy or
cultural features.
At the same time Unit 1 was being excavated, four shovel tests were dug to sample
other site areas before beginning more extensive investigations. Since surficially exposed
materials were sparse, topography was the best criterion for probe locations. Shovel Test
1, placed in shallow soil (16 cm) on the slope between the rise crest and the creek bank,
recovered burned rocks and a biface fragment in addition to debitage. Shovel Test 2, at
the forward edge of the rise crest near the eastern edge of the clearing,produced only
flakes, but surface soils were deeper (40 cm). The rear edge of the rise (Shovel Tests 3
and 4) tested negatively and is apparently outside the main site area.
Despite the lack of soil depth on the rise slope near the creek, Unit 2 was excavated
to define the context of the relatively abundant materials noted in Shovel Test 1. Results

were comparable to Unit 1, but burned rocks were more abundant. However, deflation
and displacement of cultural materials were even more evident in the larger unit.
The remaining tests, Units 3 and 4, were placed on the lower of the two lobes of the
rise crest approximately equidistant from Units 1 and 2. Although soil depth was similar
to that in Unit 1, Unit 3 apparently defines the center of the site where lithic debitage
and tools are most numerous. Two projectile points were recovered that may date early
site deposits. Investigations in this area were subsequently expanded by the excavation
of Unit 4.
Feature Descriptions
No cultural features were identified during the current testing, although a small rock
pavement was partially exposed in a shovel probe during the survey. Scattered burned
rocks were recovered from the majority of units, but not in great numbers.
Artifact Descriptions
This section of the report provides brief summaries of major categories of cultural
materials and detailed descriptions of distinctive artifacts and debitage. Results,
presented by the material and technology, are provided in Table 26.

124 / PREHISTORIC SITE TESTING

COBBLE SEQUENCE

Artifacts from site 41FY336 included within the cobble sequence are limited to two
tested gravels. Although the use of hammerstones can be inferred from the presence of
hard-hammer flakes, no cobble tools were recovered. Lithic gravels do not occur on-site
or along the creek below the site, but can be obtained from nearby upland areas.
BIFACIAL SEQUENCE

Evidence of bifacial reduction at the site, which comprises about 66% of total
materials, consists of two tools, a tool manufacturing failure and soft-hammer and
pressure flakes.
Tools
Both bifacial tools from the site are projectile points. An untyped dart point made of
fine-grained, light brown chert (Fig. 32a) comes from Level 3 of Unit 3. This whole tool
is 72 mm long, 25 mm wide, and 8 mm thick. Shoulders are distinct, but unbarbed. The
stem is not complete, but is rectangular in outline and 13 by 13 mm in size. Neck width
is 9 mm. The point is tentatively placed within a local Middle Archaic tradition characterized by rectangular stems and unbarbed shoulders. A basal fragment of a Nolan type
dart point (Fig. 32c) recovered from Level 4 of Unit 3 may be a manufacturing failure.
The length of the fragment, 39 mm, is estimated to be from one half to two-thirds of the
original. Maximum blade width is 23 mm and thickness is 9 mm. Shoulders are distinct
but unbarbed. The stem is rectangular in shape, 17 mm in length, 16 mm in width, and
alternately beveled at the neck, which is 15 mm wide. Material is fine-grained tan chert.
Debitage
Except for flakes, bifacial debitage is limited to a single Stage 4 biface manufacturing
failure from Level 4 in Unit 1.
SPLIT COBBLE SEQUENCE

A single split and discarded cobble, spherical in shape and approximately 4 cm in
diameter, was recovered from Level 2 in Unit 1 (Fig. 32b).
CORE FLAKE SEQUENCE

Approximately 32% of the materials recovered from site 41FY336, the majority of
which are hard-hammer flakes, are included within the core flake sequence. Three cores
and ten tools were also identified*

126 / PREHISTORIC SITE TESTING

Tools
Flake tools include concave scrapers and utilized flakes individually described in
Tables 27 and 28. Two of the concave scrapers have been modified to produce surfaces
on the dorsal side opposite the bulb (Fig. 32d). Three are chunky flake fragments utilized
along one lateral edge, only one of which required modification (Fig. 32e). Bit angles on
the above specimens vary between 68Â° and 78Â°. The remaining concave scraper is a
blade-proportioned soft-hammer thinning flake, with two working surfaces and bit angles
of45Â°(Fig.32f).
The four utilized flakes are unmodified and exhibit use wear, but not retouch.
Selection of the flakes appears fortuitous, since each is different and none have characteristics that might indicate systematic flake production.
Debitage
The three cores from the site are petrified wood cobbles with established platforms
(Fig. 32g). The production of petrified wood flakes for use as tools may be indicated, and
is partially verified by the relative abundance of tools of this material, especially concave
scrapers.
Cultural Stratigraphy
Data pertaining to the cultural stratigraphy of site 41FY336 is limited to the location
of the two dart points recovered. The nature of surface soils was obscured during
excavation by water saturation, but appeared to conform to the standard profile for sandy
soils in this area, i.e., light brown fine sand overlying a tan coarse sand with gravels. No
culturally meaningful soil strata were defined. Cultural features are absent and there are
no distinct vertical concentrations of artifactual materials or burned rocks.
Both dart points from the site were deeply buried and there is nothing to indicate the
age of the upper 40 cm of sandy soil. The initial site occupation was apparently during
the Clear Fork equivalent phase (4600 to 4000 years B.P.) of the Middle Archaic period,
represented by the Nolan dart point recovered between 60 and 80 cm below the surface
and just above clayey subsoil. The remaining dart point can not be assigned to a known
type, but is felt to date to the Middle Archaic due to stratigraphic association. The point
was recovered from between 40 and 60 cm depth in light brown, fine sandy soil.
Although results are inconclusive, both dart points are from the lower portion of the
surface layer. Unit levels are tentatively divided into two groups, Middle Archaic and
later occupations, meant to determine if significant differences could be defined.
Analysis results are discussed in the Summary of Site Occupations.

Extent and Intrasite Variability
Determing the extent of occupations at site 41FY336 is complicated by the presence
of cultural materials exposed on the eroded portion of the tested area. The current
investigations appear to define use of a discrete rise approximately 30 x 15 meters in size,
rather than more inclusive use of all areas above this high bank of Owl Creek. Probably
more than one area of occupation is represented. Although the presence of core (the
tested rise) and peripheral areas (the eroded area) can not be eliminated, the absence of
hearths at the rise and their possible presence elsewhere favors the former hypothesis.
There is no evidence of horizontal variability in the area tested.
Summary of Site Occupations
Differences in the values of indices comparing site occupations, provided in Table 29,
appear to justify separation of upper and lower site deposits. Although associations are
very weak, the contrast in site activities and possible function represented appears
meaningful. Too few temporally diagnostic artifacts were recovered to accurately judge
the integrity of site deposits. No diagnostic artifacts were recovered from the surface
during the survey.
FEATURE USE

The construction and use of hearths is evidenced by the burned rock concentrations
in several units on the rise crest, as well as by surficial burned rock on the deflated site
area. Since associations are tentative at best, the construction of features may be linked
to one or both occupations. The function, size, and location of features are indeterminable from the available data.
TOOL USE

Only three types of tools were identified: dart points, concave scrapers, and utilized
flakes. All three types are associated with the Middle Archaic occupation, and indicate
basic subsistence and equipment maintenance activities. The tool inventory of later site
deposits is extremely limited, consisting solely of two concave scrapers.
TOOL MANUFACTURE

The bifacial reduction sequence dominates the lithic remains only during the later
occupation. Despite the relative abundance of soft-hammer and pressure flakes, neither
bifacial tools or manufacturing failures were recovered. Cores are also absent, although
some degree of core preparation and flake selection for tool use is evident. Minor use
of split cobble technology is indicated by a single rejected half-cobble.
Percentages of bifacial and core flake sequences are co-equal during the Middle
Archaic occupation. The majority of bifacial remains are soft-hammer flakes, although

finished tools and both initial and final stage failures are also represented. The number
of tools and failures are equal and final stage bifaces are general in nature. Both platform
cores and flake tools are relatively abundant. The majority of flakes used are hard-hammer and a number have been modified. Selection of useful debitage is indicated by a
single facet platform, soft-hammer flake of blade proportions.
Summary
The Middle Archaic occupation at site 41FY336 exhibits a pattern of simple subsistence, with sparse materials and a limited tool inventory similar to that noted at 41FY264,
a small seasonal campsite where a variety of activities may have occurred. If the scattered

130 / PREHISTORIC SITE TESTING

distribution of burned rock is correct, camping may have been of short duration or of a
non-intensive nature. Low numbers of basic tool types, as well as the nature of bifacial
debitage, are within the expectations of such a camp where tools were manufactured or
replaced as needed.
The later site occupation is consistent with this model only if duration was too limited
for tools to be discarded or lost and/or for curated tools to need replenishing. However,
if this is the case, incidental rather than seasonal camping is represented, a change in site
function. It is also possible that burned rocks at the site are associated only with the
Middle Archaic occupation and later use was more temporary and limited in nature.
Assessments and Recommendations
The four 1x1 meter and three 50 x 50 cm units excavated to culturally sterile clay are
sufficient to assess the information potential of site 41FY336. The crest of the small rise
tested apparently represents a distinct occupational locus separate from the eroded
portion of the site, since the abundance of materials drops in all directions from the crest.
The features once present were few in number and have been totally dispersed. Cultural
materials are very sparse, no culturally meaningful soil stratigraphy was observed, and
there is evidence of bioturbation. None of the site remains are datable since charcoal is
absent and burned rock is out of context.
Assessment testing has defined the use of a small rise above a high creek bank, under
Goal 1 of the Research Design. Except for one of the two Middle Archaic components
associated with the Nolan dart point, the age and cultural affiliation of site occupation
can not be determined with certainty. However, the realization of Research Goal 2 would
require extensive investigations not warranted on the basis of other criteria. The identification of the Middle Archaic occupation as a seasonal encampment, and comparisons
between this and later site use, partially satisfy Goal 3.
The research potential of site 41FY336 does not appear sufficient to warrant further
work. The sparsity and lack of diversity of cultural remains indicate that further data
collection would not be productive.

SITE41FY362

Steven M. Kotter and Leland C. Bement
The second of two sites under study along Owl Creek is further downstream from site
41FY336 at the upland margin of the divide between Owl and Jones creeks. Approximately 2 km above the confluence, the divide is narrow and dissected along its
margin by slope drainage development. The site faces north, overlooking a slope
drainage which meets Owl Creek opposite the confluence of a minor tributary. The creek
is well incised, but the terrain is less dissected than other portions of Owl and Jones
creeks. Dense woods generally cover both the crest of the divide and valley slopes.
At the site, the upland margin at the site is a relatively flat bench which separates the
rounded divide crest from the more steeply and uniformly sloping valley wall. The site
is in a small clearing which coincides with two low rises where scattered cultural materials
were observed during survey (Fig. 33). The eastern rise is smaller and higher than the
broader, less prominent western rise. The two rises are separated by a topographic low,
and the eastern rise abuts a cleared roadcut. No cultural materials were noted either
within the roadcut or along the slope below the site.
Summary of Investigations

An east/west primary grid line, established at 72Â° magnetic, ran the length of the site
clearing and connected areas of potential investigations. The results of shovel testing
during the survey indicated that two areas of concentration, corresponding to the rise
crests, were separated by an area with few cultural materials. Initial tests excavated
during the assessment phase, placed to confirm this distribution, recovered relatively
abundant cultural materials from between 60 and 80 cm of sandy soil which overlay clayey
subsoil at either rise crest. Both stratigraphic tests were expanded to 1 x 2 meter units.
Results from Unit 5, dug in the low area between the rises, indicated sparse material
distribution, corroborating results of survey shovel testing.
A series of 50 x 50 cm units were then dug to determine the extent of significant site
deposits centered on the crests of the two rises. Cultural materials were recovered only
in Unit 6, placed in the wooded area west of the known site perimeter. Units 7 and 8
excavated near the crest of the upland divide, and Unit 9 located east of the rise within
the road cut were negative. The site apparently consists of two small discrete areas of
occupation, separate from each other and not extending far beyond the crest of their
respective rises. In order to provide a sample of materials from each rise, each of the
excavated 1x2 meter units was expanded to 2 x 2 meters. Tests 10 and 12 located at the
western rise and Test 11 at the eastern rise were completed by the end of the assessment

phase. Data collection was recommended based on the number and diversity of tools
recovered, although considerable mixing of temporally diagnostic artifacts was observed.
Excavations began in the eastern site area, leaving the larger of the two rises for later
investigation. The final unit of the 2 x 2 meter block begun during the testing phase was
dug first, followed by a series of units placed surrounding this excavation. Unit 14,
located 3 meters further east toward the road, was within the area of significant cultural
deposits. Fewer cultural materials were recovered from more shallow soils at the base
of the rise slope in Units 15 and 16.
At this point it was decided that a 5 x 2 meter block, including the previously excavated
2 x 2 meter block and Unit 14, would provide a sufficient sample of the eastern site area.
Horizontal patterning of artifacts within such a small area was likely to be totally
obscured, and excavations were placed to maximize tool recovery. Subsequently, five
additional 1 x 1 meter units were laid out and partially excavated before field work
associated with the Cummins Creek Mine ceased.
Feature Descriptions
Only a single feature was designated at site 41FY362, although scattered burned rocks
rested on clayey subsoil in the majority of units. It soon became evident that separation
and/or groupings of burned rocks would be entirely arbitrary, and that documentation
could most easily be accomplished using each unit as provenience. Feature 1 in Unit 11
(Fig. 34) is typical of the scattered distribution of burned rocks, but rocks were generally

less abundant in other units. The loose cluster of rocks shown in the northwest corner
of Unit 11 may, on the basis of proximity, mark a former hearth location, although the
undulating nature of the subsoil surface makes reconstruction impossible. The majority
of burned rocks are sandstone, intermixed with only a few quartzite cobbles.
Artifact Descriptions
This section of the report provides brief summaries of the major categories of cultural
materials and detailed descriptions of distinctive artifacts and debitage. Results, grouped
by material and technology, are summarized for the eastern site area in Table 30 and for
the western site area in Table 31.
COBBLE SEQUENCE

The cobble sequence from site 41FY362 includes five artifacts: three edged tools
from the eastern rise and two hammerstones from the western rise. Debitage from the
production of the edged tools could not be separated from other hard-hammer flakes
attributed to the core flake sequence.
Tools

Three petrified wood tools recovered from the eastern area are evidence of the use
of only slightly modified lenticular cobbles as choppers or for other tasks requiring an

edge. An extensively used tool, recovered from Level 3 of Unit 4, consists of half of a
thin rectangular cobble 80 x 50 mm in size and 21 mm thick. The broken end and one
lateral edge are backed and partially ground so that the tool could be hand-held. The
dorsal surface of the other lateral edge exhibits step fractures consistent with use as a
chopper. The end opposite the break shows evidence of minor use, but a previous surface
may have been removed by a large flake that obscures the original configuration of this
portion of the cobble. A similar tool type, only lightly used, was recovered from Level 1
of Unit 17. Modification by flaking and the use of backing are represented, but wear is
too slight to characterize tool function.
The final cobble tool from the eastern rise has a bifacial edge and appears different
from the type of tool described above. The subrectangular tool from Level 2 of Unit 11
is 47 mm in length, 37 mm in width, and 12 mm in thickness. Three edges are backed,
while the bifacial edge is smoothed by use. Tool function is unknown.
The two hammerstones, one from Level 2 in Unit 1 and the other from Level 2 in Unit
3, show extensive evidence of use. Both are white quartzite.
BIFACIAL SEQUENCE

Between 58% (eastern rise) and nearly 70% (western rise) of the total materials
recovered are included within the bifacial sequence. The majority of specimens are
debitage, but 14 tools were recovered. Tools are more numerous at the eastern rise,
despite the relative sparsity of total sequence remains compared to the western rise.
Tools

A total of 14 bifacial tools were recovered, 10 from the eastern rise and 4 from the
western rise. Varied projectile points comprise nearly 70% of these tools. The eight
points from the eastern rise (Table 32) include two Hoxie (not shown) and two Sandbur
and a single specimen of the Darl type (Fig. 35a-c). Two examples of an untyped
transitional point, similar in outline to Figueroa type points (Johnson 1964), and an
untyped arrowpoint fragment were also recovered (Fig. 35d-f). Dart points from the
western rise (Table 32) are more limited in number and include a Uvalde and a Williams
specimen.
Bifacial tools other than projectile points are much fewer in number. Only single
specimens of a knife from Level 1 of Unit 11 and a possible gouge from Level 3 of Unit
13 were recovered from the eastern rise. The knife is represented by a distal fragment
of a thin biface with dulling along both lateral edges (Fig. 35g). The artifact is made of
fine-grained tan chert and has a rectangular outline and cross-section produced by
soft-hammer and pressure flaking. The fragment is 44 mm in length, 34 mm in maximum
width, and 8 mm in maximum thickness. The possible gouge is the butt end of a crudely
flaked biface with a plano-convex cross-section. Material is a medium-grained brown
chert which has been annealed. Interpretations of function are based primarily on
cross-section and thickness.

A bifacial tool from the western rise may also be a gouge fragment, made from a large
flake or a split cobble of coarse-grained tan chert (Fig. 35h). Cortex is visible at the butt
end of this plano-convex, crudely flaked biface recovered from Level 1 of Unit 1. Again,
function is based primarily on tool morphology. The drill from Level 3 of Unit 10 (Fig.
35i) is long (50 mm) and slender (maximum width = 11 mm) and completely bifacially
worked. The base has been thinned, presumably for hafting. The maximum thickness (6
mm) is near the top of the drill.
Debitage
In addition to thinning and pressure flakes, bifacial debitage from the eastern area
include six initial stage and four final stage manufacturing failures. The majority of
failures are general in nature, with subtriangular outlines and regular cross-sections.
However, two failures âa distal fragment from Unit 18 and a complete specimen from
Unit 14 âare markedly beveled an alternate edges. Both artifacts are from Level 1. The
complete failure is leaf-shaped, 73 mm long, 40 mm wide, and 11 mm thick. Cortex is
absent except at the distal tip, and material is a tan, speckled opaque chert. The intended
finished tool is unknown, but the degree of beveling is not consistent with any of the
bifacial tools recovered from the site. Bifacial debitage other than flakes from the
western rise is limited to four initial stage bifaces, a final stage general biface of petrified
wood, and an overshot flake
CORE FLAKE SEQUENCE

The core flake sequence, primarily hard-hammer flakes and other debitage, comprises between 30 and 41% of the total cultural materials recovered. Non-flake debitage
includes 29 cores and four tool resharpening spalls. Although not the most abundant
sequence overall, the majority of tools (41 or 63.1%) and tool types are made on flakes.
Tools

The 41 flake tools from the site include concave and convex scrapers (with retouch),
two categories of utilized flakes and a number of beaked artifacts. The majority of tools
(N = 30) are from the eastern rise. Three of the six concave scrapers (Table 33) are
relatively large and thick hard-hammer flakes which have been extensively modified. The
remaining three tools are thin and only one has been retouched. The edge angle on
modified scrapers is high, varying between 75Â° and 80Â°. All but one, made from opalized
wood, are chert.
Flake tools also include three flake fragments with retouched convex edges. The one
nearly complete tool from Level 2 in Unit 11 is 36 mm in length and maximum width and
4 mm in thickness. The ventral surface of the distal end has been retouched to an angle
of 65Â°. Remaining specimens from Level 1 in Unit 11 and Level 2 in Unit 13, are very
small fragments with steep edge angles (65Â° and 85Â°). All scraper fragments are chert.

A third of the tools from the eastern rise (10) are utilized flakes with straight to slightly
convex edges (Table 34). Only two have been modified to some extent, but the use of a
blade-like flake indicates some core preparation. All but one, or possibly two, of the
flakes are hard-hammer and have some cortex remaining. Two specimens have adjacent
straight surfaces which form a distinct angle. Three utilized flakes have strongly convex
edges (Table 35). Two tools are hard-hammer flakes specifically modified to produce a
defined edge of a specific length and convexity. The remaining tool is an unmodified
blade-proportioned thinning flake.

The 10 beaked artifacts from the site, which include eight flake tools from the eastern
rise, are grouped into four forms with numeric designations. Beaked Form 1 tools (Fig.
36a,b) are very distinctive, consisting of two straight surfaces at right angles to one
another, each with a medial "beak." Of the two specimens recovered, one is on a split
cobble and is described later. The second tool is a chert flake fragment from Level 1 in
Unit 14 (Fig. 36a). The proximal flake end, which was opposite the intersection of the
two working surfaces, has been trimmed. The distal end and one lateral edge have been
modified by retouch to produce the characteristic working surface. Tool length and
maximum width are 40 mm; maximum thickness is 9 mm. The beaks, which are 8 mm
wide at the base, protrude about 5 mm beyond the straight surfaces and the tips are
heavily faceted.
Beaked Form 2 tools (Fig. 36c-f), represented by three specimens from the eastern
rise, are blocky tools with a single beak at one end. Each tool has subtriangular crosssection. The working surfaces are created by retouch so that a concavity is adjacent to
the beak, which is in line with either a dorsal ridge or one edge of the tool. Both proximal
and distal flake ends were utilized. One example is a cortical, hard-hammer chert flake
from Level 1 in Unit 4 (Fig. 36c) which is 42 mm long, 27 mm wide, and 17 mm thick.
The unfaceted beak is 8 mm long and 10 mm wide at the base. An opalized wood
specimen from Level 3 of this unit is an interior hard-hammer flake modified at the
proximal end (Fig. 36d). This tool, which is 34 mm long, 19 mm wide and 10 mm thick,
has a beak 6 mm long and 7 mm wide at its base. A burin spall has been removed along
one edge and the distal end used as a graver. The third Beaked Form 2 tool (Fig. 36e) is
a chert core fragment 47 mm in length, 28 mm in maximum width, and 24 mm in maximum
thickness. The beak is 10 mm in length and 11 mm in width at the base.
Beaked Form 3 consists of two chert thinning flakes from Level 1 in Unit 4 (Fig. 36g,h)
and an opalized wood chip from Level 2 in Unit 11 (Fig. 36i). The distal ends of the two
flakes have been modified to produce beaks at the intersection of either lateral edge and
in the middle of the distal end. The locations of the beaks are in line with ridges on the
dorsal surface. One edge of each beak has usually been retouched and the majority of
beak tips are faceted. The medial beak of one is broken, but other beaks show only slight
use. This specimen is 33 mm in length, 42 mm in width, and 4 mm in maximum thickness.
The second tool â35 mm long, 31 mm wide, and 4 mm thick has been more extensively
used, broken, and retouched. The third Beaked Form 3 tool is a medial fragment with
three beaks, two of which are faceted by intensive use.
The original morphology of the single Beaked Form 4 specimen (Fig. 36j) is uncertain
since it is a fragment with a resharpening spall scar along the edge most utilized. The
chert tool from Level 2 in Unit 13 is 50 mm long, 28 mm wide and 11 mm thick. The edge
of the spall scar, which consists of a series of concavities produced by removing flakes
from the dorsal flake surface, is smoothed by use. A beak created when the tool
fragmented may indicated expedient use of an otherwise expended tool. The beak is 8
mm long, 14 mm wide.
The 11 tools from the western rise include two concave scrapers made on chert flakes
(Table 33). One tool is evidence of the selection and intensive use of blade-proportioned
thinning flakes also noted at the eastern rise and at sites 41FY264 and 41FY336. Use of

the distal flake end of the other concave scraper is distinctive. Both tools have low edge
angles and are made of chert. No convex scrapers were recovered from the western rise,
although a resharpening spall is described under Debitage.
Ten utilized flakes from the western rise include six with straight to slightly convex
edges (Table 34). The number of chert and opalized wood specimens are equal; five are
whole flakes and one is a chip. None of the tools have been modified and all working
surfaces are simple. The flakes used indicated little or no core preparation or selection
based on considerations other than expediency. Four utilized flakes have strongly convex
working surfaces (Table 35), two of which required modification of flake edges. Three
of the specimens are opalized wood, and all have some cortex remaining.
Beaked tools from the western rise are limited to a single Form 2 specimen from Level
2 in Unit 12 (Fig. 36f). A cortical hard-hammer flake of opalized wood has been modified
along one lateral edge and part of the distal end to produce a beak. One edge of the beak
has been retouched, but not to the extent noted on similar tools from the eastern rise.
The tool is 31 mm long, 53 mm wide, and 17 mm thick. The beak is both 16 mm long and
wide from the base. Beaked Form 1, a manufacturing failure, was also recovered and is
described under Debitage.
Debitage
Hard-hammer flakes and cores comprise the major portion of identified core flake
debitage. Cores from the eastern rise include 12 bifacial and 5 platform specimens, but
platform cores are more abundant from the western rise, seven compared to five bifacial
examples. The majority of cores are opalized wood and either expended or fragmented.
In addition, three apparent resharpening spalls, recovered from the eastern rise, share
a common morphology, with a medial dorsal ridge separating a portion of the ventral
surface of a flake and a retouched scraping edge. Similar spalls have been documented
along the Colorado River by Shafer (1970) and Kotter (Kotter and Moncure 1985). One
of the spalls, from Level 1 in Unit 11, shows scant evidence of use as a concave scraper,
and resharpening of a totally dulled edge is not represented. The spall may possibly be
the result of edge preparation.
The remaining spalls, a chert specimen from Unit 13 Level 1 and an opalized specimen
from Level 2 of the same unit (Fig. 37a,b), are convex scrapers with considerable evidence
of use and bit angles of 83Â° and 85Â°. Dimensions are also nearly identical, with lengths
between 36 and 39 mm, maximum widths between 13 and 14 mm, and maximum thicknesses between 6 and 7 mm. Although both scraping surfaces show evidence of extensive
use, the pattern of wear is not distinctive.
Distinctive debitage from the western rise includes a single resharpening spall and
beaked tool manufacturing failure (Fig. 37c,d). The opalized wood spall from Level 2 of
Unit 3 is similar in form to those described above. The spall is 54 mm in length, 14 mm
in maximum width, and 6 mm in thickness. The working surface is 36 mm in length,
retouched to an angle of 65Â°, and smoothed by use.

The manufacture failure from Level 2 of Unit 3 is a hard-hammer secondary flake of
tan, medium-grained chert. The distal flake end has been modified to produce a convex
bifacial edge with distinct beaks formed at either lateral edge. Although not completely
worked, morphology suggests that a Beaked Form 1 tool is represented. The tool is 39
mm long, 50 mm wide, and 15 mm thick.
SPLIT COBBLE SEQUENCE

The split cobble sequence consists of five tools and a single un-utilized half-cobble,
although other remains may not be recognizable due to extensive modification. Flash
from the manufacture of split cobble tools could not be separated from other debitage.
Tools
The four tools from the eastern rise show evidence of annealing. Two specimens, both
from Level 2 of Unit 2 (Fig. 37e,f), are fragments of formal end scrapers that are
sub-triangular in outline and plano-convex in cross-section. The butt end fragment is 33
mm wide at the break, tapering to 17 mm at the distal end and 11 mm in thickness. Cortex
covers the dorsal surface, but not the edges which have been steeply retouched.
The butt end fragment appears to have been split twice, once to remove cortex from
the dorsal tool surface and a second time to produce the ventral surface. The edges of
the resulting tabular blank were then retouched to shape the tool. The bit, established
at the struck end of the half cobble, is 47 mm wide and 11 mm thick. Distinct points at
either edge of the bit clearly define the area of use which is beveled to a 60Â° angle.
Reconstructions of tool technology and use of these scrapers can be made on the basis
of both morphology and microscopic use wear. The original tool represented by the
fragments was probably between 85 and 95 mm in length and hafted. Hafting is indicated
by the size and shape of the tool, the vegetal polish noted on either lateral edge of the
tool, and, less assuredly, by the location of the snap fracture on the bit end fragment.
One of the remaining two tools is a Beaked Form 1 specimen similar in morphology
to the previously described flake tool (Fig. 37g). Only a small portion of the original edge
and cortex of the half cobble is left; the remainder has been modified during tool
manufacture and use. The subrectangular-shaped specimen is 42 mm in length, 36 mm
in maximum width, and 14 mm in maximum thickness. Two working surfaces were
created by soft-hammer flaking of the dorsal half cobble surface which produced distinct
beaks separated by the concavities where flakes were removed. The concave areas of the
edge adjacent to each beak were then retouched to form a straight edge divided in half
by the protruding beak. Two such surfaces were originally created at right angles to one
another, but a spall meant to resharpen the one beak has removed the point where the
two surfaces met.
The final split cobble tool is a multiple concave scraper recovered from Level 3 in
Unit 2. The half cobble of annealed, fine-grained brown chert is modified by flaking of
the dorsal surface to produce a series of indentations that were utilized as scraping edges.

148 / PREHISTORIC SITE TESTING

Two such edges and a portion of the third remain on the fragment which is 45 mm by 38
mm and 17 mm thick. Each of the intact edges is 11 mm long. Depth varies between 2
and 3 mm and edge angle between 58Â° and 62Â°. Cortex covers the dorsal surface of the
tool except where modified.
The single split cobble tool from the western rise is a butt end fragment similar to the
formal end scrapers described above. Cortex covers the entire dorsal surface and the
ventral surface has been thinned along one edge. The subtriangular-shaped fragment
from Level 2 in Unit 1 is made of light brown chert.
Debitage
No debitage specifically attributed to the production of split cobble tools was identified from the eastern rise. The half cobble from the western rise is small and annealed,
but otherwise unmodified.
Activity-Specific Assemblage
On the basis of data summarized below, 20 artifacts from the site comprise an
activity-specific assemblage (Fig. 38) attributable to a single occupational episode. The
abundance of beaked tools and the distinctive nature of the split cobbles and scrapers
were noted during preliminary sorting of materials. An intensive examination of these
and other artifacts, and subsequent analysis, resulted in the addition of convex scraper
fragments and spalls as elements of the assemblage (Table 36). The association of specific
types of remains is based on: 1) demonstrated wear characteristics; 2) morphological
consistency; 3) vertical and horizontal context; and 4) comparisons with other sites.
ASSOCIATIONS

Examination of the working surfaces of tools and spalls within the assemblage under
a binocular microscope revealed extensive wear on the majority of specimens. In most
instances, wear consisted of simple smoothing of edges and lines between flake scars
which were undiagnostic. Distinctive wear patterns, however, were noted on at least one
example of each of the various tool types which make up the assemblage (Table 36). The
observed faceting of scraping edges is characteristic of use on hides, as is in several cases,
striating of the facets (Hayden 1979:81). The presence of similar faceting on Beaked
Form 1 specimens also indicates hide working, and is the primary evidence associating
scraping and beaked elements of the assemblage. The faceting of beaked tips is less
surely the result of use on hides, but is not characteristic of either drilling or incising of
a hard substance.
At least two different tasks are represented within the assemblage by convex scrapers
and beaked tools, which occur in approximatedly equal numbers. The function of the
scrapers is obvious âto remove unwanted tissue, and possibly hair, thinning the hide to
the desired thickness. All of the scrapers performed the same task, since their functional

variability is limited by the nature of the scraping edge. The task, or tasks, represented
by the variable beaked forms was apparently as important as scraping to hide processing,
but tool function is less definite. Beaks would be suitable for either cutting or perforating
hides. Beaked Forms 1 and 2 have consistent morphologies which are different from each
other, and may represent different functions as well as different kinds of tools. Beaked
Form 3 is a simple expedient tool, while the nature of the single Form 4 fragment is not
certain.
Wear patterns on Beaked Form 1 tools, which are the most obvious and characteristic
of those observed, provide evidence to reconstruct tool use. The faceting of straight
edges at either side of the beak indicates that these edges were in contact with hide while
the tools were use with a motion similar to scraping. If this was the case, the beak would
protrude into and cut the hide. The tip of the beak, which performed the major portion
of the work, is faceted as if the straight edge were aligned with the direction of motion.
The nature of Beaked Form 3 specimens, thin flakes with sharp edges, also favors a
functional interpretation as a cutting tool; these tools may be expedient variants of Form
1. However, both the shape of Form 2 specimens and the limited faceting of beak tips
on this type of tool may be more consistent with used as a perforator. Exact function is
uncertain.
Primary vertical context for the assemblage is provided by the eastern rise, where
elements are nearly equally abundant in Levels 1 and 2 and almost absent from lower
deposits (Table 37). Although a common late date is suggested, the observed distribution
is not sufficiently discrete to confirm the association based on tool morphology and wear.

The use of 20 cm arbitrary levels may have been unfortunate in this regard if the artifacts
were concentrated between 10 and 30 cm below the surface. All assemblage elements
from the western rise are from Level 2 between 20 and 40 cm below the surface.
If the stratigraphic context of the assemblage is less than clear, the horizontal distribution of artifacts demonstrates their association. There appear to be five distinct loci
within the 5 x 2 meter eastern block where different kinds of elements and projectile
points occur (Fig. 39). Although there is some overlapping of types, the exclusive
distribution of some artifacts and clustered distribution of others is evidence of the
horizontal integrity of the remains. The loci appear to demarcate task organization
similar to that documented at the Late Prehistoric age Garnsey Bison Kill Site (Speth
1983), located along the Pecos River in New Mexico. The primary distribution of scrapers
and projectile points at this secondary processing campsite occur on opposite sides of a
centrally located hearth (Speth 1983:33, Fig. 17). At site 41FY362, no evidence of a
hearth was observed, but two distinct concentrations of beaked tools accentuate the
patterned distribution of remains.
TOOL HISTORY

Several of the tools within the assemblage may have been brought to the site as
curated tools, but the majority were apparently made and used on site. The split cobble
end scrapers and Beaked Form 1 specimen are both well made and annealed, a process
not associated with more expedient tools at the site. In addition, artifacts and the single
Beaked Form 4 tool are made of a non-local chert with a yellow or purple cast. If curated
artifacts are indeed represented, then specialized hide processing tools were probably
part of the basic tool kit of the group. As the need arose during activities at the site,
similar and other kinds of tools were made of locally obtained cherts and opalized woods.
The number of tools needed to complete the processing reflects both task difficulty and
the rapid expenditure of individual tools.
The nature of the artifacts within the assemblage is highly diagnostic of patterns of
use, resharpening, and eventual discard of the tools. The split cobble end scrapers, which
were probably hafted, were discarded due to breakage since both specimens have distinctive snap fractures and the single scraping edge is not dulled. The task of rehafting the
usable fragments or removing the tools entirely from the haft was a localized activity

limited to a single unit (Fig. 40). The location of tool use, however, may have been
elsewhere, most likely to the north where other convex scrapers are concentrated (Fig.
40). Useless fragments were discarded and incorporated into site deposits.
Other concave scrapers from the assemblage fulfilled the same function as the formal
split cobble scrapers and probably represent the use of an expedient alternative once
curated tools were expended. Manufacture of new formal tools was either not possible
given the available materials, or more likely, simply not efficient. Both scraper fragments
and resharpening spalls are confined to a 1 x 2 meter area that may identify the location
of use, resharpening, and discard. Still serviceable scrapers, at least judging by the
absence of whole specimens, were removed from the site when the camp was abandoned.
The nature and horizontal distribution of beaked tools are also very distinctive. Both
Beaked Form 1 specimens, which are heavily worn and were apparently discarded, are
from the same unit level. Except for the hafted end scrapers, current data suggest the
primary disposal of tools where they were used. Since Form 1 tools were unhafted, they
probably mark the location of the bulk of hide cutting activity. Why this task was isolated

from other processing activities involving beaked tools is uncertain, but two different
activity loci are probably represented. If this is indeed the case, the tasks performed by
the remaining beaked forms are associated, at least to the extent of being accomplished
within the same confined area.
Within this second locus of tool use and/or discard, the majority of specimens-two
each of Forms 2 and 3 â occur in a single unit. Remaining tools are scattered throughout
the area, with single examples of different forms from each of three units. None of the
Beaked Form 2 specimens are exhausted, although the breakage of Form 3 tools may
account for their discard. Although the original use of the Form 4 tools is obscure, a long
history possibly culminated in expedient use of this fragment in a manner similar to Form
3. A single task completed after scraping and primary cutting, and requiring two different
kinds of tools may be represented.
Soil and Cultural Stratigraphy
Neither soil stratigraphy nor feature distribution can be used to separate cultural
deposits into temporally meaningful units. Surface soils exhibit horizons noted at other
area sitesâfine upper sands and coarse sands with gravels above clay â that are developmental in nature. The majority of burned rocks occur on top of the subsoil surface, and
are either remnants of the earliest occupation or totally displaced from above. Current
results indicate both a long period of site use and considerable mixing of temporally
diagnostic artifacts. Although the number of episodes represented is greater, the vertical
distribution of artifacts defines only two gross divisions of cultural deposits. Upper and

154 / PREHISTORIC SITE TESTING

lower portions of surface soils (Fig. 41) exhibit differences that are consistent across the
site.
As noted previously, the primary distribution of hide-processing tools is within the
upper 40 cm of deposits. Although the remains of other episodes are also included,
assemblage elements are clearly associated with later occupations. The distribution of
bifacial and cobble tools provides little additional information that further defines
cultural stratigraphy. Differences between both the types of flake tools and lithic
material used, however, corroborate the separation of upper and lower deposits. Concave scrapers are fairly evenly distributed, but straight-edged utilized flakes are
characteristic of later occupations while convex-edged flakes dominate earlier occupations. Also, chert is relatively more abundant in lower deposits and co-equal with
opalized wood in upper deposits.
The initial occupations documented at site 41FY362 were during the Early Archaic,
Jarrell phase equivalent (6000-5000 years B.P.) based on the recovery of a Uvalde and
two Hoxie dart points. Both site areas were used, but each point is apparently out of
context, being displaced upward to Levels 1 and 2. At first the Hoxie points were
classified as Darl points because they occur in a Late Archaic context at the eastern rise.
However, comparisons made with other Hoxie points, as well as a wide range of Darl
variants from the area, indicate an early affiliation. The burned rocks scattered on the
clayey subsoil surface may be associated with the Jarrell phase occupation, but the
processes involved in the apparent upward movement of both dart points are obscure.
Evidence of Middle Archaic use of the site is limited to a single Williams dart point
from the western rise, which occurs in Central Texas during the San Marcos phase
(2600-2250 B.P.) If this point is in context, Level 2 dates to the final phase of the Middle
Archaic period, with the Uvalde point from Level 1 being displaced upward. This
association is not entirely contradicted by the apparent Late Archaic age of Level 2 at
the eastern rise. However, elements of the hide processing assemblage, which are felt to
date to the Late Archaic period, were recovered from the western rise from the same
level as the Williams point. The stratigraphic context of the western area remains
unknown. No evidence of a Middle Archaic occupation of the eastern rise was identified.
The association of hide processing tools from the eastern rise is critical to the
interpretation of site 41FY362. The majority of remains from the upper 40 cm of deposit,
regardless of the extent of mixing, are felt to date to the Driftwood phase equivalent
(1400-1250 B.P.) of the Late Archaic period. Although there is some overlapping of types
due to the use of 20 cm levels, three successive occupations may be represented: 1)
Driftwood occupations characterized by Sandbur dart points; 2) a second Driftwood
occupation represented by a Darl dart point; 3) a later occupation with side-notched
points possibly used on either arrow or dart shafts. Tools other than points define a Late
Archaic occupation of the western rise contemporaneous with at least one of these
components.
The final site occupation is represented by the untyped arrowpoint fragment from
near clay. The point is entirely out of context, but some portion of the deposits apparently
date to the Late Prehistoric period.

FIGURE 41. Site profiles at 41FY362 for Eastern and Western Rises.
Horizontal Extent and Intrasite Variability
The location and horizontal extent of occupations at site 41FY362 appear to be
controlled by micro-topography; that is, primary activity was concentrated and centered
on the crests of two small rises. The distribution of cultural materials indicates that a
single area later bisected by an erosional gully is not represented. The rises have been
distinct and recognizable for at least the period of time that witnessed intensive occupation of the eastern area and possibly throughout the period of use. This impression, based
on concentrations of all types of materials, is strengthened by differences in projectile
point types from the two rises.
Significant deposits in the eastern site area are limited to the 10 x 10 meter crest,
although scattered materials may include an area twice this size. A 10% sample of the
rise crest obtained during excavation of the 5x2 meter block defines a distinct core area,
centered on the rise summit. East of the summit, in Units 14,17,19 and 21, the quantity
of materials drops sharply. A similar pattern is assumed south and west of the summit as
well, but high densities may characterize the crest north of the block excavation and near
the creek. Although the sample of peripheral areas is only 0.05%, the number and
intensity of site activities, especially those involving tool use, are clearly more limited
below the crest of the rise.
Data concerning the horizontal distribution of cultural materials from the western
rise are more limited in nature. Based on the results in Unit 5 and Unit 6, the excavated
2 x 2 meter unit apparently samples an area potentially 30 x 15 meters in size. The area

156 / PREHISTORIC SITE TESTING

of occupation is more linear in shape than the eastern rise, and cultural materials may be
more evenly distributed. There is specific evidence, in the form of beaked tools and a
split cobble scraper, of concurrent occupation of both rises. Less conclusively, hammerstones and more abundant debitage at the western rise, and more abundant tools at
the eastern rise, may indicate horizontal differentiation of site activities. The sample
from the western rise, however, is too small to be more than suggestive. A detailed
summary of the distribution of the tools from the eastern rise is provided with the
description of tool use at the site.
Summary of Site Occupations
There were apparently at least seven different occupation episodes at site 41FY362 â
two Early Archaic, one Middle Archaic, three Late Archaic, and one Late Prehistoric.
Due to vertical mixing of diagnostic artifacts and other factors, the isolation of specific
episodes is limited to the association of hide-processing tools. The separation of cultural
deposits into upper and lower units does little to associate particular tools with these
episodes. Since temporal association is either uncertain or general in nature, Tables 38
and 39 summarize the types of materials recovered by keeping Levels 1 and 2 separated.
FEATURE USE

There are sufficient burned rocks for the site to be defined as a camp, but feature use
is not well defined. If the rocks scattered on the underlying clay surface are in context
except for horizontal displacement, relatively intensive camp maintenance may be represented. Total weight of burned rocks in Levels 3 and 4 of units within the eastern block
(Table 40) are equal to one or two hearths based on features documented at site 41FY264.
The earliest site occupation would be classified as a seasonal encampment, where hearth
construction and use were a significant site activity. Only minimal amounts of burned
rock were recovered from upper deposits (Table 40) at the site, and hearth construction
was not as important to overall effort as other activities involving tool manufacture and
use.
TOOL USE

Although the most notable aspect of tool use at site 41FY362 is the identification of
the hide-processing assemblage, other kinds of tools comprise about half of the total.
These tools provide evidence of non-specialized tasks which could be associated with any
of the previously defined occupational episodes. The majority of these tools types are
indicative of activities associated with general camp maintenance. Projectile points,
evidence of hunting, are relatively abundant, especially at the eastern rise, but the
number from any particular episode is not great. Low numbers of other bifacial tools,
represented by single drill and knife specimens, are also within expectations of multipurpose or seasonal (rather than extractive) campsites. The two fragments of large
bifacial gouges indicated more specialized activities, possibly involving rough woodwork-

ing. However, gouges are fairly common at early sites and may not represent a radical
departure from the basic tool assemblage of Early Archaic inhabitants of the area.
Flake tools from the site provide evidence of a variety of scraping tasks which are
mostly undefined. The generally accepted function of concave scrapers is to finish
wooden shafts (Prewitt 1981), but a number of activities could be represented by the
utilized flakes. Noted differences between types of utilized flakes during early and late
occupations may denote different tool function, but do not define specific activities. At
least at the eastern rise, the distribution of flake tools (Fig. 41) in the upper deposits is
patterned and an association with elements of the hide-processing assemblage may be
indicated.
TOOL MANUFACTURE

Methods of tool manufacture are varied including bifacial and core flake reduction,
as well as use of whole and split cobbles (Tables 38 and 39). Total bifacial remains
predominate only in Level 1, being co-equal with core flake remains in other Levels.
Finished flake tools are most abundant in each level, with the percentage represented
increasing slightly with depth. Bifacial cores are more numerous than platform cores,
except in Level 2. The presence of blade-like flakes in Level 2 indicates some purposeful
core preparation. The majority of flakes have been modified. Evidence of on-site
bifacial tool production was noted in Level 1; the relative intensity of production may
indicate the manufacture of some tools for non-site use. Otherwise, replenishment of
curated stores is indicated.
Summary
Although not clearly demonstrated, early site occupations, and possible the majority
of late occupations, appear to be within the expectations of seasonal campsites. General
types of features and tools are present in numbers that suggest encampment to exploit a
variety of resources, none intensively. The possible association of gouges and cobble
choppers with earlier occupations may be more indicative of differences in tool as-

160 / PREHISTORIC SITE TESTING

semblages than of differences in site function. The nature of the Middle Archaic
occupation at the site remains problematic.
The identification of the hide-processing assemblage, however, allows a more
detailed characterization of at least one of the Late Archaic episodes. The following
reconstruction is based on a number of assumptions, the first of which is that the nature
and number of recovered tools are appropriate only for working bison hides. Beaked
Forms 1 and 2 especially are made for heavy use, and the degree of wear evident is not
consistent with working deer hides. A second basic assumption is that the tools imply
knowledge of hide processing which indicates a lifeway (at least in part) geared to the
exploitation of bison. Such knowledge and the mastery of specialized skills are not part
of a generalized gathering strategy.
The tasks represented by the assemblage are those expected at secondary processing
campsites, generally located near kills (Skelton 1977). Most likely, a group specifically
in search of bison tracked an animal and made a kill nearby, probably the upland ridge
crest above the site. A camp was established at site 41FY362, convenient to both the kill
and water where the remains of initial processing were brought. The small eastern rise
was made the center of hide processing as well as both the manufacture and use of other
types of tools. Tool design, use, and discard patterns and discrete task organization are
evidence of efficient and purposeful activity and total familiarity with processing bison
hides.
The equal abundance of scrapers and beaked tools at 41FY362, however, was not
expected based on results at other sites, where only scattered beaked tools have been
documented. Cutting and perforating of the hides was as important a scraping, it the
number of tools is any indication. If the hide was simply processed to be transported,
cutting would not be necessary, and the manufacture of articles from hides would appear
to be indicated. These articles were probably needed immediately, or the hide would
have been stored for later use. A secondary processing site is essentially a field situation
away from the primary habitation site, the usual location of non-critical equipment
manufacturing. The simplest explanation which accounts for the data is that hide bags
were constructed to transport dried meat to an area of habitation some distance from the
site.
The presence of bison hunters with appropriate technologies in Fayette County is
significant during the Driftwood phase, a period when bison were not common (Dillehay
1974). The Darl and Sandbur dart points at the site are manifestations of local Late
Archaic groups that occupied numerous sites in the Rabbs Creek basin and portions of
the east-central region. During this period of high population density, a number of
groups that exhibit only slight variation, intensively exploited varied environments
(Prewitt 1985). There is no evidence of specialized knowledge concerning bison, and it
is doubtful if the tools recovered could have been developed to meet the needs of a
chance encounter without prior knowledge.
If local groups are not represented, the assemblage is probably associated with the
later site occupation with small, untyped side-notched points. Similar points occur at a
few other sites within the Mine District and are occasionally within local collections.

41FY362 I 161

Both size and morphology are within the range of variation of the Figueroa type (Johnson
1964) which have a distribution centered in the Trans-Pecos region. This type in turn is
similar to the Zavala type of South Texas (Turner and Hester 1985). Although the
relationship between types is uncertain, the probable origin of the points from the site is
to the south and west of Fayette County.
The large end scrapers from the assemblage, especially as curated tools, provide
additional evidence concerning cultural affiliation. The split cobble scrapers are not the
snub-nosed variety typical of Plains and Trans-Pecos groups, but are larger and worked
with greater care. Within Fayette County, split cobble technology has been documented
during the Circleville phase equivalent (at site 41FY314, Cummins Creek II) and again
in a Late Archaic context (at site 41FY442). Tool form and the use of ventral thinning
suggest a South Texas origin, where split cobble unifaces are abundant. Tools similar to
the end scrapers from the assemblage were collected from the Nueces River basin (Cloud
1986) but they are not as well made.
Given the possible associations of both projectile points and end scrapers, the suggested origin of the group occupying site 41FY362 is to the south and west of Fayette
County. Long distance treks in search of bison to augment prickly pear and other
resources within the Nueces River basin are part of the ethnohistoric record (Hester
1980). Although not demonstrated, a similar origin for the site occupation is suggested.
Assessments and Recommendations
Seven 1x1 meter and four 50 x 50 cm units were excavated to sterile clay during site
assessment. Two areas of intense occupation date to the Early Archaic period. Despite
the noted vertical mixing of diagnostic elements and the absence of intact features,
information potential was sufficient to justify additional work. Cultural materials are
relatively abundant and areas of occupation are discrete. The presence of numerous and
varied lithic tools at the eastern site area, and the identification of a possible East Texas
component represented by a Williams dart point, indicated that specific questions raised
by the Research Design can be addressed by further investigations.
Data collection at the eastern areas was designed to expand the sample of tools and,
if possible, associate specific types of tools with site occupations. If context was as poor
as testing indicated, investigations at other, more intact sites might provide key associations for similar tool types. The total or partial excavation of ten 1 x 1 meter units
collected data that justify the positive assessment of research potential. Artifacts are not
only numerous but include distinctive task-specific tools. Temporally diagnostic artifacts
are more abundant than initial test data indicated, but context is still as uncertain.
The loss of site 41FY362 has not been completely mitigated, and additional work in
both site areas is necessary to avoid impact to this significant cultural resource. Within
the eastern area, the remainder of the 5 x 2 meter block should be excavated to sterile
clay. These results should be evaluated and if either: 1) components can be separated,
or 2) apparent extractive tasks can be further defined, continued excavations west and
north of the block unit are recommended. In all further investigations, the upper 40 cm

162 / PREHISTORIC SITE TESTING

of deposits should be dug in 10 cm levels to help clarify the context of the Late Archaic
deposits.
Data collection strategies for the western rise, which is larger and more linear in
shape, should be different. Initially, units should be placed to define the horizontal
distribution of materials, especially those associated with either the Williams dart point
or the hide-working tool kit. If a Middle Archaic East Texas occupation can be defined,
additional work is recommended to the extent justified by the degree of separation of
components and the content of associated cultural materials. Continued investigations
would be recommended if sufficient task-specific tools are recovered to further define
activities at the eastern rise or concurrent use of both rises. Small block excavations of
positively assessed site areas are recommended if tools and other materials are widely
and equally distributed. Larger units would be productive only if concentrations of
materials similar to that at the eastern rise are identified.

Site 41FY442
Steven M. Kotter

Additional investigations at prehistoric site 41FY442, the Oswald Mikes Site, were
conducted between September 9 and 13, 1985. The site provided an opportunity to
compare an extensive campsite located on a creek tributary near the river with similar
sites along upland creeks (Nightengale n.d.). Testing was to assess research and information yield potential, and, if warranted, gather data toward a no-effect determination for
proposed conveyor construction.
The Oswald Mikes Site is located along the left bank of Clear Creek about 10 km (6.2
miles) upstream from the confluence with Cummins Creek, and is approximately equidistant from the Colorado River and sites within the Lignite Prospect along the upper
reaches of Cummins Creek. The site is linear in shape, following an unnamed tributary
from Clear Creek upslope 200 meters (Fig. 42). Maximum width is about 50 meters.
Cultural materials are exposed in an agricultural field separated by berms into three
terrace levels. The most southern level, nearest the creek, is a flat, alluvial terrace,
unaffected by berm construction but repeatedly plowed. Other levels are on the gently
sloping valley wall covered by colluvial soils, altered by both berm construction and
plowing. Woodlands dominate nearby areas not cleared for agricultural purposes. Apparently both geologic and alluvial gravels occur on site.
Summary of Investigations

Initial work at 41FY442 consisted of an intensive examination of surficially exposed
cultural materials, during which tools and nonflake debitage were flagged. Evidence of
camp and equipment maintenance was less abundant, and lithic processing more abundant, than initially thought. Many of the burned rocks appeared to be the results of
annealing prior to tool production, rather than hearth construction. Finished tools, if
present in significant numbers, were buried, but biface manufacturing failures were
numerous. Flake cores, possibly distinctive flakes and split cobbles were evidence of
diversified lithic reduction.
Prior to site testing, the centerline of the proposed corridor right-of-way was resurveyed at 349.6Â° magnetic, using an LCRA survey stake as datum. Secondary north/south
grid lines were then established 10 meters on either site of, and parallel to, the centerline,
with stakes placed every 20 meters. The resulting 100 by 20 meter grid system, which
included the majority of the site within the corridor right-of-way, provided horizontal
provenience for test units and potential surface collections. Tests were 1 by 1 meter in
size and oriented to grid. Sandy surface soils, which varied between 15 and 25 cm in

depth, were removed as a single level. Matrix was dry-screened through /4-inch
hardware cloth.
Four units were excavated to determine the context and nature of buried cultural
materials (Fig. 42), one in each of the three agricultural terrace levels apparent on the
surface. Cultural materials are few in number and undiagnostic, except within the flat
area nearest the creek (Unit 2), where two biface manufacturing failures were recovered
(Table 41). Unit 4, excavated to provide an additional sample from this area, did not
contain additional distinctive materials. In all site areas, surface soils which contain
prehistoric occupations have been disturbed by field terracing and plowing.
At this point, investigations had defined critical site assessment factors. Potential data
recovery is limited by horizontal and vertical displacement of cultural materials to a
general site collection. Such a collection could be easily obtained from surface materials,
but would not be substantially augmented by excavation. The nature of exposed cultural
materials indicated lithic reduction strategies and tool use could define site activities and
apparent function for a portion of the Late Archaic period. Data recovery to the extent
of collecting surficial materials was warranted. Subsequently, all exposed materials,
except distal flake fragments and burned rocks, were collected from 20 10 x 10 meter
units within the previously established grid. Tools and cores outside the collection area
were plotted and described during site mapping; four were collected.
A site topographic map was made using transit and stadia incorporating the established grid. Contour lines express general slope and ignore berms, the crests of which
were mapped separately. Other documentation consists of written reports of excavations
and both black and white and color photographs. A daily journal was maintained,
summarizing procedures and results.

Artifact Descriptions
Results of investigations at Site 41FY442 document lithic processing and informal
tool use during the later portion of the Late Archaic Period. A Mahomet type dart point
(Fig. 43a), two Mahomet manufacturing failures, and a small Ensor variant (Fig. 43c)
date site components to the equivalent of Prewitt's (1981) Driftwood Phase, between
1250 and 1400 years B.P. The relative sparsity of cultural materials may indicate the
number of episodes represented is also limited. Collected materials provide evidence of
diverse lithic strategies, including bifacial, core flake and split cobble reduction, although
only flake tools are numerous.
Results described herein are presented within a framework of lithic reduction
strategies. Discussion of core flake techniques includes descriptions of all informal tools.
Surface materials collected or noted on site are itemized in Tables 42 and 43.
COBBLE SEQUENCE

Cobble selection at the Oswald Mikes Site was a relatively complex procedure
involving a number of variables. Cherts located on site were used almost exclusively.
However, the presence of two petrified wood flakes indicates limited use of material
obtained off site, probably from an upland source. Available chert cobbles vary in size,
shape and flaking characteristics. Size and shape undoubtedly affected which cobbles
were selected for specific kinds of tools and/or reduction techniques. In most instances,
an attempt was made to improve the working quality by annealing. Four cobbles collected from the site had been tested and rejected as unsuitable.
A brief discussion of annealing is pertinent at this point. The internal structure of
chert can be thermally altered by various methods of placing cobbles in proximity to heat.
As a result, individual silica grains are reduced in size and recrystalized, increasing
elasticity and causing the chert to respond more favorably during flaking (Crabtree and
Butler 1964). Annealed materials exhibit a modified texture which feels "greasy" or
"waxy", a general darkening in color and, often, a reddish hue caused by oxidation of iron
oxides. Annealing has been recognized in the immediate area by Skelton (1977:211-232),
who conducted a number of replicative studies verifying local use and methods. Between
325Â° and 375Â°C was established as the critical temperature range for Fayette County chert.
BIFACE SEQUENCE

Evidence of biface tool production at the site consists of manufacturing failures and
soft-hammer flakes. Biface tools, although described within this section, were not
necessarily made on site. Hard-hammer flakes removed during initial shaping and
thinning could not be systematically separated from other hard-hammer flakes, which are
described under core flake reduction. Manufacturing failures are classified into stages
(Skelton 1977) from initial edge preparation (Stage 1) through hard-hammer thinning
(Stage 2), cortex removal (Stage 3), soft-hammer thinning (Stage 4) and pressure flaking
(Stage 5). Soft-hammer flakes include 10 with single facet platforms and 47 thinning
flakes.

170 / PREHISTORIC SITE TESTING

Annealing is evident on half of the 14 manufacturing failures examined (Table 44).
Reduction of cobbles is indicated by two initial stage bifaces with cortex remaining on
both surfaces. No evidence of biface production from large flake blanks was noted.
However, suitable flakes (described later) are present on site, and their use cannot be
eliminated. Tools were apparently finished on site, since all stages of failures and stylistic
shaping are represented. Numbers of finished tools (Fig. 43a-e) indicate that the
majority of those produced, principally thin knives and dart points, were removed from
the site when it was abandoned. Evidence of biface tool use at the Oswald Mikes Site is
limited to one whole and two fragmentary dart points and a drill or perforator (Table 45).
SPLIT COBBLE SEQUENCE

Split cobble technology is a distinctive but minor method of lithic reduction at the
site. Cobble splitting is useful in working rounded alluvial gravels, where initial entry
necessary to begin biface reduction or flake removal is difficult. Spherical cobbles are
more easily split by bipolar technique, placing one end of the cobble against an anvil and
striking the opposite end (Crabtree 1972). Cones of force are created at both ends,
causing the cobble to split along its long axis. Since force of percussion is dispersed over
the entire interior surface, the ventral face of the resulting half cobble is essentially flat
and undamaged. Skelton (1977) defines a group of indeterminant split cobbles which
exhibit shattered bulbs of percussion at one end.
Debitage
Split cobble debitage from the Oswald Mikes Site (Table 46), except the core, appears
to represent a manufacturing sequence from cobbles rejected after splitting and initial
attempts at thinning to finished tools. The majority of specimens have been annealed,
and a preference for spherical cobbles with smooth exteriors is evident. Only finegrained cherts were selected for reduction beyond initial splitting. The core is a natural
half cobble, with the surface of the old break used as a platform. Flakes were removed
from the split surface to develop a platform for a blade-like flake (See also following
sections).
Tools

The single split cobble tool recovered is a disc-shaped scraper (Fig. 43f) 66 mm in
length, 56 mm in width and 57 mm in maximum thickness. The tool's ventral surface has
been thinned except in the area of the utilized edge. Ventral thinning is most prominent
opposite the scraping edge so the tool can be comfortably hand held. Cortex has been
completely removed from the dorsal surface, but thinning failed to remove a knob in the
center of this surface. The working edge is 40 mm in length and + 6 mm in depth.

Analysis defines those kinds of flakes which may have been intentionally and systematically made for tool use, and contrasts these with informal tools which appear to represent
fortuitous use of debitage. A summary of the origins of the informal tools (Table 47)
indicates that hard-hammer flakes were produced and/or selected for use over cobbles,
cores and soft-hammer flakes. Unfortunately cores, although diverse, are generally
undistinctive. However, several kinds of flakes have distinctive and consistent morphologies which provide evidence of tool production strategies.
Debitage
The 44 cores observed on site, 20 of which were collected and examined, include those
with fixed platforms and those bifacially reduced. Flakes were removed from bifacial
cores, beginning at one end of the cobble, until only the portion held in the hand
remained. After initial entry, flakes were alternately struck from either cobble surface
using the platform created by the preceding flake. Platform cores are more varied, but
retain a fixed platform(s) from which a series of flakes were struck. The distinction
between the two kinds of cores is not always clear, since technique could be changed
during the reduction of the cobble. Cores recovered from the site are not individually
described, except in the few instances which can be associated with the production of
specific kinds of flakes.
Regardless of core type, the first flake removed will have an unprepared platform and
corticate dorsal surface (Fig. 44a). Six of the eight unprepared platform flakes appear to
be from initial entry. However, two are large, regularly shaped and nearly twice as long
as they are wide. The flakes were probably intentionally struck using platform core
technique, but without recognizable platform preparations. Both specimens have been
worked along one or both lateral edges, although flaking is not systematic and preliminary

shaping and/or thinning may be represented. Neither flake has been utilized, but both
are suitable for either biface or flake tool production.
Once a platform has been created, subsequent flakes removed from the cobble have
prepared, single-facet platforms, and decreasing percentages of dorsal cortex. The
majority of the 38 recovered flakes with more than 50% of cortex remaining are debitage
which could have resulted from a variety of reduction strategies. However, seven of the
eight utilized flakes recognized within this category appear distinctive. Four are large
flakes, one of which has been trimmed, apparently struck from platform cores. One is
wedge-shaped and, except for the percentage of cortex present, similar to flakes
described later. The remaining two flakes are distinctive in that the proximal ends have
been trimmed, apparently to reduce tool length to fit between thumb and fingers.
The majority of hard-hammer flakes (63 of 109) have less than 50% of cortex remaining on the dorsal surface. Flakes removed from more interior portions of cores exhibit
greater evidence of preparation and more clearly defined indications of origin. Five
distinctive kinds of flakes are recognized on the basis of consistent morphology, which
were intensively used as tools. Remaining flakes which have irregular outlines and/or
cross-sections are classified as miscellaneous. Use of miscellaneous flakes is apparently
fortuitous since only one of 19 is a tool. Distinctive flakes and tools are described below.
Fifteen hard-hammer flakes are classified as blade-like, since they exhibit dorsal
ridges and parallel edges. Although length is generally not much greater than width, the
intent was to produce a strong thin flake of blade proportions. Technique and effort
required to produce such flakes are indicated by two cores, where platforms have been
prepared but not struck (Fig. 45). In both instances, either end of a platform edge has
been flaked to produce a peak in the center of the edge, which served as the platform for
the flake and created its distinctive triangular shape. Preparatory flaking also defined
the dorsal ridge which later directed the force of impact. The cores also indicate that site
occupants worked an entire cobble to obtain a blade-like flake for use as a tool. Nearly
half of blade-like flakes (7 of 15) have been utilized.
Thirteen flakes are defined as wedge-shaped on the basis of cross-section (Fig. 44b-c).
Types have decorticate ventral and dorsal surface, one thick lateral edge with cortex and
a thin opposite edge. The thick corticate edge protected the hand, while the thin edge
was used. In some specimens, cortex extends to the middle of the dorsal surface, and on
one forms nearly the entire edge of the flake. Wedge-shaped flakes could have been
produced from either platform or bifacial cores. The six tools recognized include both
large, blocky flakes and long slender flakes.
Five flakes are large, thick and have a pronounced dorsal ridge. Only one of the flakes
is regular in outline (Fig. 44) and systematically prepared prior to flaking. Remaining
specimens are angular and resemble core fragments in general appearance. Although
fortuitous use may be represented, the percentage of flakes utilized is similar to more
distinctive kinds of flakes. This category was probably struck from platform cores.
Four large flakes recovered were prepared before being struck from platform cores
by removing one or more flakes from the area of the dorsal surface. The resulting flake
is as broad as it is long, of uniform thickness and mostly decorticate (Fig. 47d-e). In one

instance, the negative bulb of a previously struck flake was used as a working surface.
Both unused specimens have been edge-modified.
Flakes removed sequentially from a bifacial core are represented by seven specimens,
three of which have been utilized (Fig. 44f-h). A flake of uniform thickness can be
removed by striking the core in the same area as a previously struck flake, but several
millimeters nearer the core interior. Resulting flake edges are thick, mostly cortical, and
steeply sloping.
Fortuitous use of debitage at the Oswald Mikes Site is represented by a cobble tool,
a single core, and four flakes. The cobble tool is a thin fragment which was trimmed and
used the same as a large flake. The bifacial core was used, taking advantage of its wedge
shape and cortical backing. Use of soft-hammer flakes, as well as irregularly shaped
hard-hammer flakes was apparently fortuitous.
Summary of Site Occupations
During the Late Archaic Period, the Oswald Mikes Site was successively occupied by
two different groups of people. Probably the more recent of the two is represented by
Mahomet dart points, mostly manufacturing failures. Groups characterized by Mahomet
points occur in Central Texas during the Driftwood Phase (1400 to 1250 B.P.), but may
be centered at the eastern fringe of this region (Goode 1984a). The affiliation and age
of the occupation with Ensor-like dart points are less certain, since the points differ from
the more classic Ensor which defines the Twin Sisters Phase of Central Texas (1750 to
1400 B.P.). Smaller Ensor variants are probably later (extending into the Driftwood
Phase), and may indicate differentiation of groups along the southern and eastern
margins of Central Texas. The following summary is a composite of both occupations.

41FY442 I 177

General inferences made are probably applicable to either component, but more specific
results (such as split cobble reduction) may be associated with only one occupation.
The Oswald Mikes Site apparently represents a short-term campsite occupied by a
small group of people. It is assumed (although not demonstrated) that use of Clear Creek
is part of a strategy, possibly based along the river but intensively exploiting perennial
tributary streams. Groups moving up Cummins Creek might exploit spring-fed auxiliary
streams where potable water and chert gravels occur. Cobbles were needed to perform
the two primary activities identifiedâproduction of bifacial and informal tools. Comparison of effort expended in these activities, relative to evidence of camp and equipment
maintenance provide some indications of site function.
Bifacial thin knives and dart points were reduced on site from cobble to finished
artifact. Bifacial tool use is more limited, and apparently much of the effort expended in
manufacturing was for off-site use. This fact, and the widespread use of annealing,
indicate site function was in part extractive in nature. Sparse hearth stones and bifacial
tools are consistent with short-term camp and equipment maintenance, which would be
an imbedded activity necessary for a small, possibly all male group to manufacture
bifaces. Utilized flakes would be expected to be present as well. However, the number
of informal tools and effort expended in producing and modifying flakes appears greater
than expected from routine camp maintenance activities. The Mikes Site was apparently
not occupied simply to manufacture bifaces.
Informal tool use at the Oswald Mikes Site appears related either to more intensive
camp maintenance and/or additional extractive activities. If site occupation was by a
larger, more integrated social unit than the previously hypothesized small, all male
extractive unit, abundant and varied informal tools might be expected. However, the
sparsity of hearth stones and bifacial tools argues against this supposition, and additional
extractive activities are probably represented.
Analysis of informal tools does indicate the use of both hand-held and thumb scrapers.
No evidence of hafting was noted, although smaller flake tools are suitable. Large flakes
(and utilized cobble and core) were often trimmed to a subrectangular shape between 40
and 50 cm in size to fit the palm. The hand was protected by cortex or a series of small
flakes which dulled sharp tool edges. Shaping and backing of tools implies either heavy
duty use where repeated impact would damage the hand, or long-term light use and tool
conservation. Evidence of heavy duty use is present on only a few tools, and generally
use was light duty and/or short term. The majority of informal tools were apparently held
between thumb and fingers.
All informal tools exhibit a series of small overlapping flakes removed from the edge
of one side of the tool, apparently from use as a scraper. None of the tool edges has been
dulled by cutting. Analysis of working surfaces (Fig. 46) indicates the use of concave
(N = 13), straight (N = 16), and convex (N = 8) scrapers. The normal distributions of both
depth and length of concave surfaces may indicate a single activity is represented. Wear
at 45Â° angle noted on some specimens suggests use as a draw knife. The single exception
exhibits wear consistent with rougher chopping.

The numbers of tools without depth indicate that straight edges are distinct from
either concave or convex. The majority of straight edges are between 10 and 15 mm in
length, the same as concave scrapers. Although this fact may be coincidental, both kinds
of tools may have been used to perform different tasks related to a single extractive
activity. Remaining straight edges are between 20 and 35 mm in length, distinctly longer
than the majority. These tools, and those with convex edges, may have been used during
more general camp maintenance activities. Two kinds of convex surfaces were recognized, one long and gently curved, and the other narrow and strongly curved.
Assessment and Recommendations

Testing at site 41FY442 demonstrates that the site has been disturbed by field
terracing and plowing. Test excavations of four units yielded little cultural material and
no diagnostic artifacts; no culturally meaningful strata were defined. The vertical and
horizontal displacement of artifacts at the site would prevent any useful information,
beyond a surface collection from being obtained. Therefore, additional testing of this
site is not recommended.

INTRODUCTION
The results of the archeological survey, historic site testing and prehistoric site
assessment were originally intended to determine the relative contribution of each site
to the Fayette Power/Rabbs-Cummins Creek Historic District. None of the historic sites
would, as entities, meet criteria for listing on the National Register of Historic Places
but, based on local informant interviews, all contribute to the reconstruction of early
lifeways in Fayette County.
The tested prehistoric sites were relatively undistinguished open campsites typical of
the general settlement pattern in this region. Only 41FY362, where excavations were in
progress at the time of work stoppage, requires additional investigation if and when mine
development resumes.
Survey and Results
Intensive survey was restricted to areas that would be affected by ancillary facilities
and that were not included in the previous large area surveys (Nightengale and Jackson
1983; Nightengale, Jackson, and Moncure 1985). The Overland Conveyor Corridor, a
little over 12 miles in length, was intended to serve as a tranportation route from the mine
to the power plant. Five historic and four prehistoric sites were recorded in or adjacent
to the 65 ft wide linear swath. Three of the four prehistoric sites were found on creek
terraces and Pleistocene gravel deposits, high probability areas predicted prior to survey.
The fourth, 41FY444, an upland site, was a light lithic scatter, too sparse to merit
additional testing. Prehistoric site 41FY442 and three of the five historic sites were
tested based on recommendations made by the Texas Historical Commission.
Short sections of County Roads 112 and 114 in the community of Waldeck were
straightened and improved to meet governmental standards for heavy traffic. Four
historic sites, the former locations of a smithy, a gin, a domicile and a school, were
recorded and tested. No standing structures remained but local informants were able to
reconstruct much of the history of each locale. A tenant house site, 41FY413, was also
tested in anticipation of road construction.
The proposed reroute of the Winchester to Salem transmission line crossed a .75-mile
segment of previously inaccessible lands. One prehistoric site was recorded and two that
abutted the boundaries of the earlier large area surveys were reassessed. The portions
of the previously recorded sites 41FY327 and 41FY336 that extend into the right-of-way
were tested.

182 / SUMMARY AND

RECOMMENDATIONS

Historic Site Testing
OVERLAND CONVEYOR

Three historic sites recorded within the Overland Conveyor Corridor were further
researched by archival searches, informant interviews, and subsurface testing. Although
indirectly related to an early pioneer family, the Frenzel Site, 41FY448, proved to be
recent, built in the 1930s, and no additional significance was demonstrated by the
archeological probes. The original home of the pioneer Frenzel family is well outside
the corridor.
The Zingelmann Site, 41FY445, consisted of a house and outbuildings when recorded.
The house was moved to a new location, outside the corridor, prior to testing. Family
members were able to accurately reconstruct the original layout and functions of the
farmstead and provide a lively account of their daily lives.
The Tschiedel Site, 41FY447, presented the greatest challenge. All that remained at
the time of survey was a barn and a debris pile, obviously from a dismantled house.
Inaccuracies in the abstract frustrated attempts to trace the ownership until local informants recalled that the farmstead was once the property of Frank Tschiedel and directed
us to Mrs. Josie Tschiedel Schuldt, his grandaughter. Mrs. Schuldt provided a family
history and photographs of the house taken immediately after construction in 1895.
Testing of the three Overland Conveyor Corridor sites produced no information beyond
that contributed by local informants. No further work is recommended.
WALDECK COMMUNITY

Four historic sites that would be affected by modifications to County Roads 112 and
114 were also tested. Three adjacent now-vacant lots were once the site of the Waldeck
smithy, the Waldeck gin, and a house. Local residents were able to describe the industrial
structures and document their various functions over the early twentieth century. The
third site once held a house, moved in from an unspecified location and removed at an
unknown date. The structure, in its new location, was recorded as 41FY297 by the first
Cummins Creek survey (Nightengale and Jackson 1983). The fourth historic site, also
now a grassy pasture, was once the site of the second Bell Settlement school building.
All that remains are the front steps and the cement remnants of the girls privy. Former
school teachers and pupils reconstructed the appearance and layout of the school yard.
Testing was restricted to the immediate road right-of-way and yielded only modern trash.
None of the Waldeck sites are intact and further work would not produce any additional
pertinent information.
41FY413

The Ahschlager tenant house, 41FY413, was mapped and tested by the excavations of
seven 1 x 1 meter units. The distribution of artifactual material reflected some yard
patterning as inferred from the extant features. The information potential of 41FY413
was fully exploited by testing and no further work is recommended.

SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS

I 183

Prehistoric Site Testing
Originally, ten prehistoric sites that would be affected by construction of various
ancillary mining facilities were scheduled for testing in 1985-1986. All are within the
Fayette Power/Rabbs-Cummins Creek Historic District so testing was intended to determine the relative contribution of each site to an understanding of prehistory. Field work
was terminated after testing of three sites, 41FY264, 41FY336 and 41FY442, had been
completed. Extensive excavations at 41FY362 were halted, leaving several units unfinished.
Site 41FY264, recorded during the initial Cummins Creek survey (Nightengale and
Jackson 1983), lay within a corridor where road construction was anticipated. The
recovery of several diagnostic dart point styles led to subsurface testing of the site despite
obvious damage inflicted by bioturbation and a previous road crossing of the creek. Six
1x1 meter units and two 50 x 50 cm probes were excavated. Site 41FY264 yielded two
features, one dated to 1920Â±60 radiocarbon years ago. Repeated occupation during the
Middle and Late Archaic periods was indicated by the temporally diagnostic artifacts
recovered during survey and testing, but the relative uniformity of the assemblage
suggested the nature of site use was limited to small seasonal encampments. The sparse
cultural materials, simple subsistence features, and general tool inventory, recovered
from a disturbed context, indicated that 41FY264 lacked significant research potential
beyond that gained by testing.
Site 41FY336, recorded during the second Cummins Creek survey (Nightengale,
Jackson, and Moncure 1985), was reassessed in anticipation of the rerouting of the
Winchester-Salem transmission line. The portion of the site that extends onto previously
inaccessible property was recommended for testing. Four 1x1 meter and three 50 x 50
cm units were excavated; the only feature identified was encountered during shovel
probing during the survey phase. Two dart points attributed the lower strata to the
Middle Archaic Period but the upper occupation level yielded no evidence of its age. The
sparse recovery and limited tool inventory suggested that 41FY336 was a small, seasonal
campsite much like 41FY264 and no further work was recommended.
Downstream of 41FY336, 41FY362 lies at the upland margin of the divide between
Owl and Jones creeks. Recorded during the second Cummins Creek survey, the site was
evaluated as disturbed by sheetwash erosion, but with a potential for intact deposits with
depth. Testing concentrated in two areas of the site defined by two rises separated by a
topographic low. The initial yield of a significant number of tools from the first 12 units
excavated led to the decision to expand into large block excavation. Four additional 1 x
1 meter units were placed on the eastern rise and completed prior to termination of field
work when mining plans were abandoned. Five 1x1 meter units planned for the western
rise were only partially excavated.
The only feature recorded during testing was scattered burned rock resting on the clay
subsoil, symptomatic of the distribution of burned rock throughout the site. Projectile
point styles ranging from a Uvalde to an untyped arrow point reflect the long but probably
intermittent use of this site location. The most significant result of the artifact analysis
was the definition of an activity-specific assemblage comprised of beaked tools used in

183

184 / SUMMARY AND

RECOMMENDATIONS

hide-processing during at least one Late Archaic episode. Projectile point and end
scraper styles suggest that the occupants of 41FY362 originated south and west of Fayette
County. The loss of 41FY362 has not been completely mitigated and if mining plans
resume, the work begun at this site should be completed.
The Oswald Mikes Site, 41FY442, was recorded during survey of the Overland
Conveyor Corridor. This extensive campsite located on a creek tributary near the river
was selected for testing in order that a comparison between this setting and similar sites
on upland creeks could be made. The four 1 x 1 meter units that were excavated
demonstrated that the majority of the cultural materials were seriously displaced both
vertically and horizontally. Subsequently, 20 10 x 10 meter units were surface collected
to provide a sample for determining lithic reduction sequences during the Late Archaic
Driftwood Phase indicated by the diagnostic projectile points recovered. The limited
potential of the Oswald Mikes Site was fully exploited by testing and additional excavation is unlikely to add to a broader understanding of regional prehistory.
SITE STATUS
The testing of eight historic sites in the Cummins Creek district demonstrated the
value of oral history in a rural area such as Fayette County. By far the most significant
findings were those generated by interviews with longtime residents and their descendants. Each of the sites fails to meet individual criteria for National Register of Historic
Places eligiblity but in sum they contribute to the reconstruction of the rise and demise
of the rural economy and now-abandoned lifeways in the early twentieth century.
The results of prehistoric site analysis confirmed the pattern detected in earlier
Cummins Creek studiesâthe repeated occupation of creek-oriented landforms by small
groups for specific purposes from Middle Archaic through Late Prehistoric times. Only
one of the four prehistoric sites tested, 41FY362, demonstrates an information potential
beyond that exploited by this phase of Cummins Creek investigations. The recovery of
activity-specific tool assemblages with affinities to southern and western tool kits is
relevant to the oft-hypothesized role of Fayette County as transitional between more
cohesive cultural areas. Testing of six additional sites had not been initiated at the time
of project termination. If mining plans are resumed in the near future, the research
problems addressed in this phase can contribute to a refinement of goals and methods
outlined in the Fayette Power/Rabbs-Cummins Creek Mine Management Plan (Kotter
et al. 1987).
