ABSTRACT
An archaeological survey for the proposed Richards, Texas Farm-to-Market
Road 149 fiber optic cable project in northwest Montgomery County, Texas was
performed by Brazos Valley Research Associates (BVRA) on December 2 and 3,
2011 for United Telephone of Texas of Overland Park, Kansas who is doing
business as Centurylink. The Texas Historical Commission (THC) issued permit
6097 for this project, and BVRA is the holder of an Archeological Resource
Protection Act (ARPA) permit from the National Forests and Grasslands in Texas
for work on their land. The area investigated consists of 2.4 miles of proposed
cable with an easement of 10 feet (2.9 acres). The project area is in Forest Service
Compartment C-5. No archaeological sites were found, and no artifacts were
collected. The area was investigated through a surface survey and shovel testing.
Two streams cross the highway, and these are minor tributaries that are low
probability areas for significant cultural resources. Copies of the report are on file at
the THC, Texas Archeological Research Laboratory (TARL), the Texas State
Library, Centurylink, and BVRA.

at TARL were checked by Jean Hughes, Assistant Curator of Records at TARL, for
previously recorded sites in the project area. J. Randy Ferguson assisted with the

DEFINITION OF STUDY AREA
Centurylink (client) of Overland Park, Kansas plans to install a four-inch
fiber optic cable starting at the community of Richards where it will connect to an
existing fiber optic cable and ending at a cellular phone tower near Farm-toMarket Road 1791 in the Sam Houston National Forest. The project as currently
proposed is 5.7 miles in length. The client stated that the focus of this project is
the 2.4-mile segment within the Sam Houston National Forest, and the remainder
of the project was not to be surveyed at this time. The cable will be in the right-ofway of Farm-to-Market Road 149 and on the north side (Figure 1), and this area
is in Forest Service Compartment C-5. Only two areas were considered to have
potential for the presence of cultural resources. These are the crossing of Farmto-Market Road 149 by Bay Branch and a tributary of Caney Creek. The project
area is depicted on the USGS 7.5â topographic quadrangles Richards (3095-321)
dated 1962 and photorevised 1997 and San Jacinto (3095-312) dated 1959 and
photorevised 1997 (Figure 2).

MANAGEMENT SUMMARY
This project was performed in order to identify any cultural resources that
might be present within the project area. The client (sponsor) is Centurylink of
Overland Park, Kansas who intends to install a fiber optic cable from Richards,
Texas to a cellular phone tower in the Sam Houston National Forest. BVRA was
hired to perform the archaeological survey. William E. Moore was the Principal
Investigator, and J. Randy Ferguson was the Project Archaeologist. The field
survey involved 20 person hours and was performed on December 2 and 3,
2011. The reviewing agencies are the THC and the Lufkin office of the National
Parks and Grasslands in Texas.

METHODS
The project consisted of three phases. Phase I was archival research that
included checking the site records at TARL and the Texas Archeological Sites Atlas
were checked for the presence of previously recorded sites and prior surveys and
projects in the project area and vicinity. Relevant archaeological reports
documenting work in Montgomery County were reviewed in order to become
familiar with the types of prehistoric and historic sites found in the area. Those
reports reviewed document work at Lake Creek Reservoir (Bement et al. 1987), the
San Jacinto River basin (Shafer 1968), and investigations at Scottâs Ridge on Lake
Conroe (Shafer and Stearns 1975; Shafer and Baxter 1975). The second phase
was a reconnaissance of the area by the Principal Investigator. The entire APE was
examined through a âwindshield surveyâ and a Pedestrian Survey. Phase III
involved the subsurface investigation that was performed through shovel tests on
both banks of the two streams that cross Farm-to-Market Road 149. The project
area was investigated by a surface inspection and shovel testing. Excavated earth
from the tests was screened using Â¼ inch hardware cloth, and shovel test data
were entered onto a log. In addition, the project was documented through field
notes and digital photography. A photograph was taken of each shovel test
(Appendix I). Six shovel tests were excavated at Bay Branch (Figure 3), and two
tests were excavated at the point where an unnamed tributary of Caney Creek
crosses the road (Figure 4). Shovel tests were terminated when clay was
encountered or it became obvious that the area had been significantly disturbed.
The first area examined was Bay Branch. Shovel Test 1 was excavated ten
meters from the west bank of the creek (Appendix II, Figure 1), and this area was
found to have been disturbed through road construction. The rest of the tests were
dug at intervals of fifteen meters. At this point, the channel of the creek is wider
than normal because of disturbance and erosion associated with road construction.
The landowner allowed me to observe the stream channel to the north, and it is
only about three feet wide in most places. The upper level of these tests consisted
of disturbed clay over clay loam at depths between 20 and 35 cm. Mottled clay
subsoil was encountered at depths of 43 to 115 cm. In those areas where intact
soil appeared to be present, very few pebbles and other natural objects were found.
Two tests were excavated on the east bank in an area that also appeared to have
been heavily disturbed. The soil in these areas was disturbed clay containing
asphalt and other intrusive materials over intact clay. Next, a shovel test was
excavated on each bank of an unnamed tributary of Caney Creek. The soil in this
area was very disturbed and consisted of road base materials in the first 40 cm
over clay. There was no need to dig additional tests in this area because of the
observed disturbance.

RESULTS AND RECOMMENDATIONS
Examination of the files at TARL in Austin, Texas and the Atlas revealed no
previously recorded prehistoric sites are in the project area. Also, there is no
evidence that the area has been surveyed or visited by a professional
archaeologist. No cultural resources were found as a result of this survey. The two
streams within the project area are tributaries of major creeks. Based on personal
experience in Southeast Texas and findings by other archaeologists, prehistoric
sites are usually found on elevated landforms that have sandy soil and are near
dependable sources of water. These areas are usually ridges, terraces, and pimple
mounds. Buried sites can be present in the floodplains of major creeks. Not one of
these scenarios is present in the project area. It is, therefore, my opinion that the
APE is in a very low probability area for a significant prehistoric site. Historic sites
can occur anywhere on the landscape. However, no evidence of historic utilization
of the area was observed. Should a site be present, it is probable that its main
locus would be on private property outside the highway right-of-way.
It is recommended that the client be allowed to proceed with construction as
planned. Should evidence of an archaeological site be encountered during the
construction of the road, all work must stop until the THC can evaluate the situation.
This survey was conducted in accordance with the Minimum Survey Standards as
outlined by the THC.
