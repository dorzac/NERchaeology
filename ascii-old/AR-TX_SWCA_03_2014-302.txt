ABSTRACT
On behalf of Texas Parks and Wildlife Department (TPWD), SWCA Environmental Consultants (SWCA) conducted
an intensive cultural resources survey of portions of the 4,395-acre Palo Pinto Mountains State Park (PPMSP), located
in southwestern Palo Pinto and southeastern Stephens Counties, Texas. Investigations occurred over fiscal year 2013
and 2014 and focused on select areas encompassing 3,400 acres within PPMSP. These areas were identified by TPWD
as having a priority for improvement and use, which compelled the cultural investigations. The goal for this study
was to obtain survey-level data on the presence of cultural properties and materials on lands controlled by TPWD to
address the stewardship and management of those resources. To meet these goals, an intensive survey was conducted to
identify any prehistoric and historic cultural resources within the park, establish vertical and horizontal site boundaries
as appropriate, and evaluate the significance and eligibility of any site for designation as a State Antiquities Landmark
(SAL) by the Texas Historical Commission. All work was done in accordance with the standards and guidelines of the
Antiquities Code of Texas. The work was conducted under Texas Antiquities Permit 6558, with Kevin A. Miller serving
as Principal Investigator.
The background review determined that PPMSP has not been subjected to any formal archaeological survey and no
previously recorded archaeological sites were within the park prior to the current investigations. The Tarrant County
Archaeological Society (TCAS) had hiked in select park areas and recorded the locations of surficial cultural materials.
Although the TCAS had not officially recorded any archaeological sites, their data were used for the formal recording
of several archaeological sites.
From June 2013 to May 2014, SWCA archaeologists conducted an intensive pedestrian survey of PPMSP. The field
investigations culminated in newly recording 40 prehistoric and historic archaeological sites (41PP389–415 and 41SE308–
320) and documenting 69 isolated finds (IFs). The prehistoric activities include campsites and lithic scatters extending
from the Late Paleoindian to Late Prehistoric time periods. The historic activities involve early to mid-twentieth-century
railroad construction and use, petroleum exploration and extraction, cedar chopping, community and civic development,
and recreation.
Based on the results of intensive inspection and assessment, eight sites (41PP391–392, 41PP396, 41SE311, 41SE316,
and 41SE318–320) have undetermined NRHP-eligibility, but due to their exposure to the public (e.g., proximity to public
road and/or presence of large structural features) they are recommended as eligible for designation as SAL sites and
further work is recommended. Nine sites (41PP395, 41PP399, 41PP403–405, 41PP414–415, 41SE310, and 41SE312)
pending further work have an undetermined eligibility regarding their NRHP and SAL designation status. Twentythree archaeological sites (41PP389–390, 41PP393–394, 41PP397–398, 41PP400–402, 41PP406–413, 41SE308–309,
41SE313–315, and 41SE317) for various reasons are not recommended for designation as SAL sites or as eligible for
listing on the NRHP and no further protective measures are warranted for the sites. No further actions are recommended
for IFs as they are interpreted as having the lowest priority for management and protection.

ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS
The successful completion of a large cultural resources survey such as Palo Pinto Mountains State Park (PPMSP) requires
the support and dedication of numerous individuals. SWCA would like to particularly thank Tony Lyle, John Ferguson,
and Michael Strutt with Texas Parks and Wildlife Department (TPWD) who made the project logistics and various field
efforts occur with relative ease. Tony Lyle oversaw the cultural resources investigations of PPMSP and actively provided
input before, during, and after field work. Similarly, John Ferguson acted as guide and host while field work commenced
and assisted the field crews in innumerable ways. Both of these individuals were a pleasure to work with and SWCA
greatly benefitted from their assistance. Also, SWCA would like to express gratitude to the Tarrant County Archaeological
Society (TCAS) whose previous volunteer work in the park aided in the documentation of several archaeological sites.
SWCA also extends immense gratitude to Martha Doty Freeman who conducted an intensive archival review of the
PPMSP for TPWD. Freeman’s research slightly preceded that of SWCA’s investigations and she frequently offered
insights to our historic site interpretations and guidance to our fieldwork.
The PPMSP project also benefitted from the hard work of many individuals who participated in the field work, the various
reporting phases, and management of the project. Kevin A. Miller served as Principal Investigator for the duration of the
project, ably overseeing the survey methods, quality of work, and reporting. Judith Cooper, Cultural Resources Program
Director, coordinated the disparate project staff and oversaw agency coordination. Mary Jo Galindo served as Project
Manager with co-manager Ken Lawrence who also acted as Project Archaeologist. The Project Archaeologist was ably
assisted during the numerous field mobilizations by crew chiefs Alamea N. Young, Walker Van Item, James E. Barrera,
Matthew Carter, and Leonard Kemp and field technicians Ashley Eyeington, Katie Sloan, Stephen Schooler, Chris
Kugler, Lindsey Skelton, Allyson Walsh, and Jessica Ulmer. These individuals conducted themselves professionally
and are commended for their efforts that occurred with nary a complaint. Christian Hartnett constructed the probability
models used to guide the investigations and interpretations. Kristen N. Brown served as project architectural historian,
who, with the guidance of Martha Doty Freeman, conducted historic archival research for the project. Carole Carpenter
and Christian Hartnett expertly produced all field and report maps for the project, while Lauri Logan and Judith Cooper
provided a thorough editorial and technical review of the document. Finally, Christina Nielsen served as SWCA’s laboratory
manager and supervised all project collections and coordinated the subsequent curation with TPWD.

MANAGEMENT SUMMARY
Project title: Intensive Cultural Resources Survey of Palo Pinto Mountains State Park (FY13 and FY14), Palo Pinto
and Stephens Counties, Texas.
SWcA Project Number: 26261-224-AUS.
Project DeScriPtioN: In the effort to compile inventory-level information on archaeological sites located on lands
owned and controlled by the Texas Parks and Wildlife Department (TPWD), an intensive cultural resources survey was
conducted to identify any prehistoric and historic archaeological sites within roughly 3,400 acres of PPMSP in Palo
Pinto and Stephens Counties, Texas.
locAtioN: The PPMSP is located west of Strawn, Texas, and north of Interstate Highway 20 along the Palo Pinto/
Stephens County Line, mainly in southwestern Palo Pinto County, Texas. The park survey areas appear on the Strawn
West and La Casa U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) 7.5-minute quadrangle maps.
Number of AcreS SurveyeD: 3,400 acres.
PriNciPAl iNveStigAtor: Kevin A. Miller.

of

Work: All work was done in accordance with the standards and guidelines of the Antiquities Code of

Number of SiteS: Forty new archaeological sites (41PP389–415 and 41SE308–320).

eligibility of SiteS: Eight sites (41PP391–392, 41PP396, 41SE311, 41SE316, and 41SE318–320) have undetermined
NRHP-eligibility, but due to their exposure to the public (e.g., proximity to public road and/or presence of large
structural features) they are recommended as eligible for designation as SAL sites and further work is recommended.
Nine sites (41PP395, 41PP399, 41PP403–405, 41PP414–415, 41SE310, and 41SE312) pending further work have an
undetermined eligibility regarding the NRHP and SAL designation status. Twenty-three archaeological sites (41PP389–
390, 41PP393–394, 41PP397–398, 41PP400–402, 41PP406–413, 41SE308–309, 41SE313–315, and 41SE317) for
various reasons are not eligible for inclusion to the NRHP or for designation as an SAL and no further protective
measures are warranted for the sites.
curAtioN: Artifacts will be permanently curated by the TPWD.
commeNtS: In addition to the 40 archaeological sites investigated in the PPMSP, 69 isolated artifacts (26 prehistoric and
43 historic) were identified throughout the park. Three of the PPMSP prehistoric sites (11 percent) appear to contain a
prehistoric hearth feature. The isolated prehistoric objects include chipped stone tool fragments, debitage, and projectile
points. The isolated historic artifacts consist of tin cans, bottle/glass fragments, fragmented houseware items, railroad
debris, and artifacts associated with oil and gas development and expansion. Overall, the cultural resources in the park
exhibit prehistoric human activities from the Late Paleoindian to Late Prehistoric time periods and historic early to
mid-twentieth-century activities. Finally, all figures illustrating PPMSP indicate the park boundaries as of January 2014.

On behalf of the Texas Parks and Wildlife Department
(TPWD), SWCA Environmental Consultants (SWCA) con­
ducted an intensive cultural resources survey of portions of
the 4,395-acre Palo Pinto Mountains State Park (PPMSP),
located in southwestern Palo Pinto County and southeastern
Stephens County, Texas (Figures 1.1 and 1.2). PPMSP is
situated along rocky uplands overlooking the Palo Pinto
Creek valley to the north. The project area is situated within
the Western Cross Timbers physiographic region along the
Palo Pinto/Stephens county line. Prior to becoming a state
park in 2013, the land had been privately owned and used
for ranching and hunting activities.
SWCA’s investigations constitute the first systematic inten­
sive survey of PPMSP. The goal for this study was to obtain
survey-level data on the presence of cultural properties
and materials on lands controlled by TPWD to address the
stewardship and management of those resources. Specifi­
cally, TPWD seeks to identify previously unrecorded cul­
tural resources and recover specific data that can be used
by TPWD for conservation, planning, and management
purposes within the park. To meet these goals, SWCA 1)
identified and fully inventoried any prehistoric and historic
cultural resources within select areas of PPMSP extending
over 3,400 acres; 2) analyzed all data and artifacts recov­
ered during the investigations; and 3) prepared resource
management recommendations contained in the following
report of the results (Figure 1.3). In an effort to direct the
survey investigations towards the production of meaning­
ful data, SWCA prepared a probability model to guide the
methods and analyses utilized on the project. The goal of
the model was to provide a framework in which to uncover
and explore new information regarding the history of hu­
man occupation within the park and offer further avenues
of study for future researchers.
This document details the results of the cultural resources
investigations of select portions of PPMSP, which encom­
pass over 80 percent of the current park boundaries.

Project timeline
SWCA conducted cultural resource investigations at PPM­
SP between June 2013 and May 2014. Work corresponded
to fiscal year (FY) funding from TPWD and was generally
divided up into investigations conducted in 2013 (FY13)

and 2014 (FY14). All work was done in compliance with
the standards and guidelines of the Antiquities Code of
Texas and TPWD stipulations. The work was conducted
under Texas Antiquities Permit 6558 with Kevin A. Miller
serving as Principal Investigator.
Cultural resource investigations conducted in FY13 began
in June 2013 and included the intensive pedestrian survey
with shovel testing of approximately 1,091 acres over the
course of four field mobilizations. A total of 1,074 shovel
tests were excavated and 14 archaeological sites and 20
isolated finds were documented. An interim report detailing
the results of the FY13 field investigations was submitted
to TPWD in August 2013 (Lawrence et al. 2013).
Beginning in FY14, the boundary of PPMSP (including
Tucker Lake) was enlarged from roughly 3,536 acres to
approximately 4,395 acres. Prior to field investigations an
analysis of the overall distribution of archaeological sites
in the surrounding region was conducted. The purpose of
this study was to refine survey methodology through the
identification of high, medium, and low probability areas.
Using these data and a suite of other variables (e.g., soils
and topography) a predictive model was developed and
submitted to TPWD in January 2014. The predictive model
provided a framework for conducting FY14 archaeological
field work.
Field investigations for FY14 commenced in March 2014
and resulted in the survey of approximately 2,400 acres
over the course of three field mobilizations. A total of
1,438 shovel tests and 19 backhoe trenches were exca­
vated culminating in the discovery and documentation of
26 archaeological sites and 49 isolated finds. Finally, an
architectural historian conducted an archival review and
in May 2014 visited PPMSP and evaluated several of the
historic-age resources identified during the archaeological
investigations. Notably, under a separate TPWD contract,
historian Martha Doty Freeman conducted an intensive
archival review of the PPMSP. The historian’s research
slightly preceded and overlapped that of SWCA’s PPMSP
historic investigations. These data (i.e., Freeman 2014)
guided portions of SWCA’s fieldwork and greatly enhanced
the historic site interpretations.
The following report details the combined results of the
cultural resource investigations conducted in FY13 and

FY14 at PPMSP by SWCA. Finally, all figures illustrating
PPMSP indicate the park boundaries as of January 2014.

Project SettiNg
The PPMSP is in the Western Cross Timbers ecoregion
of North Central Texas and offers a great diversity of to­
pography, as well as a great variety of plants and wildlife.
As of this report date, the park consists of approximately
4,395 acres (including the 206-acre Tucker Lake), several
small artificial ponds, over 4 miles of Palo Pinto Creek,
and a northern boundary that parallels the Union Pacific
Railroad. Tucker Lake is the water supply for the nearby
city of Strawn, and was built in 1937 by the Works Progress
Administration (WPA). The main hydrologic features in the
park include Palo Pinto and Russell Creeks and a series of
unnamed tributaries, the latter of which is dammed to cre­
ate Tucker Lake. Prior to its formation, over 3,300 acres of
the park was an undeveloped ranch with cattle and oil and
gas operations owned by the Copeland family from nearby
Strawn, Texas.
Broadly defined, the park rests upon predominantly
Pennsylvannian-aged limestone, marl, sandstone, and shale
with intermixed pockets of sandstone. These sedimentary
rocks exclusively compose the upland areas of the park
while the lowland areas along Palo Pinto Creek and its
tributaries are Quaternary alluvium and recent flood plain
sediments originating from the surrounding uplands. The
sedimentary bedrock of the uplands around the park differs
in resistance to erosion with the sandstone and shale yield­
ing first, followed by the limestone (Figures 1.4–1.5). As a
consequence of the varying erosion, the topography of the
park can fluctuate from gently sloping to very steep over
a short distance (Figure 1.6). Similarly, the soils around
the park vary considerably, but are attributable to three
types of parent material. With few exceptions, these soils
include dark grayish-brown to brown loam-clay loams,
strong brown to reddish-brown sandy loams, and brown
to yellowish brown silt loams. The brown loam-clay loam
and the strong brown to reddish brown sandy loam almost
exclusively occupy the upland areas and adjoining slopes.
The loam-clay loams are derived from the limestone bed­
rock in the park, while the sandy loams are attributed to the
sandstone bedrock in the area.
The remaining silt loam was observed along Palo Pinto
Creek and some of its tributaries. The examination of the
cut bank profiles along Palo Pinto Creek and some select
drainages revealed some very deep (greater than 2 m) al­
luvial deposits in some locations (Figure 1.7). The main
channel of the drainage has meandered considerably for
some time with some high energy flashy deposits (Figure
1.8). However, there does appear to be some large pockets

of integrity, including the area around 41SE312, discussed
in Chapter 5.
Human use and disturbances through the park vary in se­
verity and include fence lines, dirt road or two-track roads,
range fires, heavy equipment earth movement, construc­
tion of stock tanks, petroleum exploration and extraction,
vegetation cutting, and slope erosion (Figures 1.9–1.11).
A review of historic aerial maps revealed that areas within
PPMSP have been cleared of vegetation in the past 100
years. This was likely the result of local cedar harvesting,
a regional industry that was prominent in the park in the
early 1900s.
The PPMSP and surrounding area is rich in cultural his­
tory. The construction of the Texas and Pacific Railroad
(T&PRR) along the PPMSP boundaries began in 1880.
This railroad spawned a considerable influx of people to
the area that resulted in the establishment of the commu­
nity of Strawn. Similarly, the petroleum industry has had
a profound effect on PPMSP and the region. Oil was first
discovered near Strawn in 1895 followed by a discovery
of oil in Palo Pinto County in 1915. These discoveries
ultimately led to the vast oil and gas development that
characterized west/central Texas in the 1920s. The evidence
of both of these industries is present in PPMSP today. The
Wiles railroad siding and associated community was built
in circa 1915 and by the early 1920s, a small community
called Wiles was established. This community contained
houses, a grocery, and a train station, as well as the oil
operations was found during the SWCA investigations and
recorded as 41SE320. Similarly, records indicate that in the
early twentieth century Oil Well No. 1 owned by prominent
regional figure William Knox Gordon, was drilled in or near
PPMSP. This historic site could be one of three archaeologi­
cal sites (41PP397, 41PP403, or 41PP415) found during the
SWCA investigations. The PPMSP also includes Tucker
Lake, a drinking water reservoir constructed by the WPA
for the community of Strawn during the Great Depression.
During the late 1930s and early 1940s, Tucker Lake had
become a popular recreation area with vacation cottages
lining the western shoreline. Essentially, the results of the
PPMSP cultural resources survey indicate a long, interest­
ing, and varied history of human subsistence, occupation,
activity, and recreation.

This chapter discusses the environmental setting of
the PPMSP and the surrounding area. The PPMSP is
located along the southern margin of Palo Pinto Creek in
southwestern Palo Pinto County and southeastern Stephens
County, Texas, just west of the City of Strawn between
Fort Worth and Abilene. It is situated within the Western
Cross Timbers sub-region, with the western one-third of
the park within the Carbonate Cross Timbers sub-region,
of the Cross Timbers Ecoregion of North Central Texas.
The Cross Timbers region is bordered to the east by the
Texas Blackland Prairies, to the west by the Central Great
Plains, and to the south by the Edwards Plateau and Llano
Uplift Ecoregions of Texas. The property, previously
private ranch land, is largely undeveloped. This review
encompasses geology, soils, vegetation, fauna, hydrology,
and the paleoenvironment of the region.

GeoloGy
The surface geology of PPMSP is predominantly mapped
as an assortment of Pennsylvanian-aged sedimentary
deposits that get progressively older from west to east
across the park (Barnes 1972). These deposits belong to
the Canyon and Strawn Groups and consist of alternating
formations of limestone, shale, and sandstone. As a
consequence, deposits more resistant to erosion are more
prominent in park exposures and on the ground surface.
The PPMSP formations include the Winchell Limestone;
Wolf Mountains Shale; and the Palo Pinto and Mineral
Wells Formations, which contain deposits of limestone and
sandstone (Barnes 1972). In contrast, the Palo Pinto Creek
drainage valley contains Holocene alluvium composed
of sediment (e.g., gravel, sand, silt, and clay) from the
surrounding valleys (Barnes 1972). Notably, the Winchell
Limestone formation along the western end of the park is
recorded as containing some black chert nodules (Barnes
1972).

SoilS
The soils within the PPMSP in the general order of
predominance include: Set-Palopinto complex, Palopinto
extremely stony clay loam, Palopinto very flaggy loam,
Bosque clay loam, Hensley very stony clay loam, Set
clay, Santo-Bunyan loams, and Owens very stony clay,
(Cyprian 1994; Moore 1981; NRCS 2014). In general, the

predominant soil mapped for PPMSP is shallow stony clay
or clay loam, suggesting a low potential for deeply buried
intact archaeological sites. The exceptions are the lowland
valley deposits (i.e., Bosque clay loam and Santo-Bunyan
soils) that appear to have a high potential of having deep,
intact deposits.
The soils on the upland ridges and slopes include the SetPalopinto complex, 8 to 40 percent slopes, described as
extremely stony clay and clay loam and occupying long
narrow bands along steep escarpments. The Palopinto
extremely stony clay loam, 1 to 8 percent slopes, is
described as shallow (about 1 foot thick) clay loam
occupying gently sloping ridgetops overlying limestone
bedrock. The Palopinto very flaggy loam (undulating) is
characterized as very shallow to shallow, dark brown flaggy
(i.e., platy limestone) loam located on narrow, convex
ridges. The Hensley very stony clay loam, 0 to 5 percent
slopes, is characterized as 6 to 15 inches thick, occupying
level to gently sloping uplands overlying limestone bedrock.
The Set clay, 3 to 5 percent slopes, is situated along knolls
and footslopes and is described as a variety of clays derived
from clayey and shaly parent materials in uplands. Owens
very stony clay occupies uplands and consists of shallow,
clay originating from shale parent materials.
The soils for the lowland areas are the Bosque clay loam
(occasionally flooded), which is located along Palo Pinto
Creek and surrounding valley floors. This soil consists of
deep, bottom land soils derived from loamy alluvium parent
material. The frequently flooded Santo-Bunyan soils occupy
localized areas along Palo Pinto Creek and are characterized
as very deep, calcareous stratified loams.

VeGetation
The PPMSP is in the Western Cross Timbers sub-region
of the Cross Timbers and Prairies vegetative area of Texas
(Correll and Johnston 1979). This area is evident by strips of
woodland stretching across grassland, hence the term “Cross
Timbers” (Tharp 1939). Typical vegetation communities in
this region consist of post-oak (Quercus stellata) and eastern
red cedar (Juniperus virginiana) woodland with recent
human activities producing a marked increase in Ashe
juniper (Juniperus ashei). This combination creates a cedarmesquite re-growth forest. Other trees include hackberry
(Celtis laevigata), American elm (Ulmus Americana),
cedar elm (Ulmus crassifolia), Texas oak (Quercus texana),

10

Chapter 2

bitternut hickory (Carya cordiformis), bur oak (Quercus
macrocarpa), and sand post oak (Quercus margaretta) with
an understory of shrub and herbaceous layers that occur in
low densities and include sapling American beautyberry
(Callicarpa americana), saw greenbriar (Smilax bona­
nox), cedar sedge (Carex planostachys), laurel greenbriar
(Smilax laurifolia), yaupon holly (Ilex vomitoria), and Texas
bluebonnet (Lupinus texensis) (Brown 1985; Kricher and
Morrison 1998; Stein et al. 2003; Sutton and Sutton 1985).
Additionally, the park contains isolated areas of open
savannah and small prairies composed of grasses,
wildflowers, and brush along the edge of the wooded areas.
Grasses present include little bluestem (Schizachyrium
scoparium) and side oats gramma (Bouteloua curtipendula).
Several xerophytic species, including acacias (Acacia sp.)
yuccas (Yucca sp.), and prickly pear (Opuntia sp.) were
noted in the park area. In forested areas, such as along
drainages, vegetation includes isolated sugar hackberry
(Celtis laevigata), pecan (Carya illinoensis), blackjack oak
(Quercus marilandica), live oak (Quercus virginiana),
and post oak (Quercus stellata) with a common dense
understory of greenbriar (Smilax sp.) and Virginia creeper
(Parthenocissu quinquefolia) (Gould 1975).

Fauna
The PPMSP lies at the juncture of the Texan and Kansan
biotic provinces with the eastern half of the park within
the former and the western portion of the park within the
latter. These provinces represent transitional zones from
the mesic forests of eastern North America to the xeric
grasslands of the central United States. The Texan and
Kansan biotic provinces have a high faunal diversity. Due
to the transitional nature of the region, the fauna is a mix of
both forest and grassland species. Blair (1950) identified at
least 49 species of mammals, 57 species of reptiles, and 23
species of amphibians native to the Texan biotic province.
For the Kansan biotic province Blair (1950) recorded
59 mammalian species, 45 reptilian species (snakes and
lizards), and 16 amphibian species.
The following mammals are common within the Texan
province as identified by Blair (1950): whitetailed deer
(Odocileus virginianus), muskrat (Ondatra zibethicus),
raccoon (Procyon lotor), coyote (Canis latrans), opossum
(Didelphis virginiana), eastern mole (Scalopus aquaticus),
eastern pipistrellus bat (Pipestrellus subflavus), red bat
(Lasiurus carolinensis), fox squirrel (Sciurus niger), gray
squirrel (Sciurus carolinensis), southern flying squirrel
(Glaucomys volans), gopher (Geomys breviceps), fulvous
harvest mouse (Reithrodonomys fulvescens), whitefooted
mouse (Peromyscus leucopus), marsh rice rat (Oryzomys
palustris), cotton rat (Sigmodon hispidus), packrat (Neotoma

floridana), eastern cottontail (Sylvilagus floridanus), and
swamp rabbit (Sylvilagus aquaticus). Historically, red
wolf, bison and black bear ranged into or near the park area
(Burt and Grossenheider 1976; Kricher and Morrison 1998;
Sutton and Sutton 1985).
Snakes, amphibians, and birds are also present in
considerable numbers and diversity within the Texan
province (Blair 1950). This includes the racer (Coluber
constrictor), rat snake (Elaphe obsoleta), timber rattlesnake
(Crotalus horridus), common kingsnake (Lampropeltis
getulus), woodhouse toad (Bufo woodhousii), bullfrog
(Rana catesbiana), northern leopard frog (Rana pipiens),
and the gulf coast toad (Bufo vallicepus) (Blair 1950;
Brown 1985; Conant and Collins 1998; Sutton and Sutton
1985). Common land turtles include the eastern box turtle
(Terrapene Carolina) and western box turtle (Terrapene
ornate), while the snapping turtle (Chelydra serpentinia),
river cooter (Chrysemys concinna), and diamondback
terrapin (Malaclemys terrapin) comprise common
water turtles. Common lizards include the green anole
(Anolis carloinensis), eastern fence lizard (Sceloporus
undulates), broad-headed skink (Eumeces laticeps), sixlined racerunner (Chemidophorus sexlineatus), and eastern
grass lizard (Ophiosaurus ventralis).
Breeding birds common to the wooded areas within the
Texan province include: black vulture (Coragyps atratus),
turkey vulture (Cathartes aura), wild turkey (Meleagris
gallopavo), northern bobwhite quail (Colinus virginianus),
mourning dove (Zenaida macroura), red-bellied woodpecker
(Melanerpes carolinus), downy woodpecker (Picoides
pubescens), scissor-tailed flycatcher (Tyrannus forficatus),
blue jay (Cyanocitta cristata), American crow (Corvus
brachyrhynchos), eastern bluebird (Sialia sialis), northern
mockingbird (Mimus polyglottos), northern cardinal
(Cardinalis cardinalis), painted bunting (Passerina ciris),
and lark sparrow (Chondestes grammacus). Migratory
species within wooded areas include yellow-bellied
sapsucker (Sphyrapicus varius), northern flicker (Colaptes
auratus), eastern phoebe (Sayornis phoebe), ruby-crowned
kinglet (Regulus calendula), hermit thrush (Catharus
guttatus), American robin (Turdus migratorius), and many
sparrows (Brown 1985; Bull and Farrand 1977; Kricher and
Morrison 1998; Sutton and Sutton 1985).
Comparatively, the mammalian fauna encountered
within the Kansan province include: Ord’s kangaroo rat
(Dipodomys ordii), deer mouse (Peromyscus maniculatus),
eastern mole (Scalopus aquaticus), swift fox (Vulpes
velox), plains pocket mouse (Perognathus flavescens),
black-footed ferret (Mustela nigripes), striped skunk
(Mephitis mephitis), badger (Taxidea taxus), coyote (Canis
latrans), spotted ground squirrel (Citellus spilosoma),
blacktail prairie dog (Cynomys ludovicianus), yellow­

Environmental Background
faced pocket gopher (Cratogeomys castonops), hispid
pocket mouse (Perognathus hispidus), Merriam pocket
mouse (Perognathus merriami), northern grasshopper
mouse (Onychomys leucogaster), white-footed mouse
(Peromyscus leucopus), whitethroat woodrat (Neotoma
albigula), southern plains woodrat (Neotoma micropus),
blacktail jackrabbit (Lepus californicus). Three mammalian
species within this province, eastern cottontail (Sylvilagus
floridanus), eastern mole (Scalopus aquaticus) and eastern
fox squirrel (Scirurus niger), are at their western limit.
Bison once existed in this area but no longer remains in this
region (Blair 1950; Burt and Grossenheider 1976; Davis
and Schmidly 1994).
Of the reptilian species encountered within the Kansan
province, there are 14 lizard species and 31 snake species.
Some of the lizard species include: eastern collared lizard
(Crotaphytus collaris), Great Plains skink (Eumeces
obsoletus), and prairie lizard (Sceloporus undulatus),
of which none are limited to this province. Some of the
snake species include: eastern glossy snake (Arizona
elegans), western diamond-backed rattlesnake (Crotalus
atrox), western rattlesnake (Crotalus viridis), plains blind
snake (Leptotyphlops dulcis), gopher snake (Pituophis
catenifer), long-nosed snake (Rhinocheilus lecontei), plains
black-headed snake (Tantilla nigriceps), checkered garter
snake (Thamnophis marcianus), and common garter snake
(Thamnophis sirtalis) (Blair 1950, Conant and Collins 1998;
Werler and Dixon 2004).
Of the amphibian species encountered within the Kansan
biotic province, there is only one land turtle species, ornate
box turtle (Terrapene ornate). There is also only one
urodele, eastern tiger salamander (Ambystoma tigrinum),
observed within this province. Some of the anuran species
encountered within the Kansan biotic province include:
southern cricket frog (Acris gryllus), Great Plains toad
(Bufo cognatus), eastern green toad (Bufo debilis), redspotted toad (Bufo punctatus), and Woodhouse’s toad (Bufo
woodhousii) (Blair 1950; Conant and Collins 1998).
Of significance, bison constituted one of the major game
resources throughout prehistory. However, this resource
was intermittently absent from the region (Dillehay 1974).
Possibly more than any other resource except cultigens in
latter prehistory, bison played a profound role in nearly all
aspects of some prehistoric societies. Specifically, bison
influenced to some extent technological organization,
mobility, population size, and political organization.

along the northern margin of the park. Although there are
small areas of prairie present, the majority of the terrain
within the park consists of hills, ridgetops, escarpments,
steep slopes, and irregular surface features. The area ranges
in elevation from as low as 1,020 feet above mean sea level
(amsl) to a maximum height of 1,485 feet amsl. The high
variance in elevation within the park creates high gradient
slopes and dramatic topography.
The PPMSP is situated within the Palo Pinto Basin of the
Middle Brazos River Valley. The park overlooks Palo Pinto
Creek, located along the northern portion of the park. The
Palo Pinto Creek drains eastwardly into Lake Palo Pinto
and then continues until eventually draining into the Brazos
River. The PPMSP surrounds city-owned Tucker Lake,
fed by Russell Creek. Tucker Lake, the drinking water
source for the City of Strawn, was built during the Great
Depression by the Works Project Administration.

PaleoenVironment
The paleoenvironmental record for the last 18,000 years
or so generally has been reconstructed through various
lines of proxy data (e.g., bog pollen, speleothems, and
various isotopic analyses). Admittedly, not all data are
unanimously accepted and there are gaps in the record,
but most researchers generally accept the review provided
here. To date no detailed paleoenvironmental research has
been conducted in the immediate vicinity of PPMSP. Data
from regional studies must therefore be used to provide a
foundation from which to compare the past environmental
records of PPMSP. The following combined summary is
based on research at Ferndale Bog about 195 miles northeast
PPMSP (Albert and Wyckoff 1984; Ferring 1994; Wyckoff
1984), regional studies (Hall 1988), and multiple studies
in central Texas south of PPMSP (Bousman 1998; Bryant
and Holloway 1985; Bryant and Shafer 1977; Hudler 2000;
Musgrove et al. 2001; Nordt et al. 2002, 2007; Sylvia and
Galloway 2006; Toomey et al. 1993).
Subsequent to the last glacial maximum, approximately
18,000 b.p., the climate was interpreted to have cooler
temperatures and more mesic conditions for the central
Texas region, South Texas Plains, and Texas Coastal Plain
(Bousman 1998; Bryant and Holloway 1985; Bryant and
Shafer 1977; Hudler 2000; Musgrove et al. 2001; Nordt
et al. 2002, 2007; Sylvia and Galloway 2006; Toomey
et al. 1993). These cool and mesic conditions prevailed
until 15,000 b.p. and again around 12,000 b.p. when it is
interpreted from pollen data and isotopic analyses that
glacial melt waters entered the Gulf of Mexico and triggered
arid and presumably warmer conditions in southern and
central Texas (Bousman 1998:214; Nordt et al. 2002:182).
This assessment is further supported by low growth rates
on speleothems from dated stalagmites in several central

12

Chapter 2

Texas caves implying more xeric conditions (Musgrove et
al. 2001). The xeric period around 12,000 b.p. was followed
by a shift back to cooler temperatures and moist conditions
in central and southern Texas, which continued into the
Early Holocene (Bousman 1998:214).
From the Early to Middle Holocene (approximately 10,500–
5,000 b.p.) the proxy data suggest that the climate became
gradually warmer and more xeric (Bryant and Shafer
1977; Toomey et al. 1993). These data include: 1) pollen
evidence suggesting a decrease in arboreal canopy and
more open grassland (Bousman 1998; Wyckoff 1984:19), 2)
various fauna indicator species from cave deposits (Hudler
2000; Toomey et al. 1993), 3) the presence or absence of
various Molluscan fauna (Neck 1983, 1987), and 4) shifts
in C3–C4 plant production (Nordt et al. 1994, 2002). The
prominent period of warmer temperatures, decreasing
moisture, and a recession of woodlands is sometimes called
the Altithermal or Hypsithermal, among others (Collins
2004; Neck 1987; Story 1990; Toomey et al. 1993). These
warming and xeric conditions existed throughout this
time with some minor deviations and probably localized
variations (Hudler 2000:88–89). One anomaly of note is a
brief episode of moister conditions in southern and central
Texas occurring approximately 6,000 b.p. as evidenced
by an increase in arboreal pollen and data from isotopic
composition of organic and inorganic carbon (Bousman
1998; Nordt et al. 2002:186). This brief cool and moist
episode was immediately followed by an extremely arid
and warm climate (Bousman 1998; Nordt et al. 2002). This
xeric period, lasting roughly 1,000 years, was exhibited
by a drastic reduction in arboreal pollen and an increase in
grassland pollen with the former reaching its lowest point
and the latter reaching its zenith at approximately 5,000
b.p. (Bousman 1998).
From this extreme of the arid and warm period, the Late
Holocene climate is described as gradually increasing in
moisture, and cooling in temperature (Bousman 1998; Nordt
et al. 2002, 2007). Nordt et al. (2007:159) characterize
this period as a ‘cool interlude’ before conditions again
transition into a more xeric and warm climate. This arid
interval extends from roughly 2,600 to 1,000 b.p. before
again becoming slightly more mesic and continuing as
such up to the present (Hall 1988:208; Nordt et al. 2007).
Concurrent with this drying trend, the spread of short grass
prairie has been cited as a contributing factor to the apparent
increase in bison on the southern Plains (including PPMSP),
particularly about 800 years ago. Finally, Bousman
(1998:216) notes brief fluctuations of arid conditions
occurring around 300 to 500 b.p. before trending toward
modern climates of the present.

The area containing PPMSP is identified as the Northcentral Texas archaeological region (Perttula 2004:7); no
recent synthesis for this area has been created. Despite
the dearth of regional data, North-central Texas is on the
periphery of established cultural complexes, which suggests
that it is situated at a confluence of major cultural influences
and activities. PPMSP is at the southern end of the Southern
Plains (Holliday 2000), west of the Lower Elm Fork area
(Prikryl 1990), north of the Edwards Plateau, and east of
the High Plains and Caprock Canyonlands (Boyd 2004).
The influence of cultural groups interacting and surviving in
these surrounding environments likely spilled into this area.
These identified archaeological regions define specific
geographic areas particularly where prehistoric communities
with common cultural traits were located. Notably, huntergatherer groups by definition were nomadic, but there
are some indications of environmentally based behaviors
specific to each of these regions. Although the defined
archaeological regions are not absolute, they do generally
reflect recognized biotic communities and physiographic
areas in Texas (Perttula 2004:6). The North-central Texas
archaeological region, as its name implies, is in north central
Texas and covers the Eastern and Western Cross Timbers,
which is bordered by prairie grasslands. The Trinity and
Brazos river basins bisect the region with the Red River
serving as an artificial boundary to the north. These three
waterways are amongst the largest of the Texas drainages
and were a source for prehistoric and historic systems of
subsistence and settlement.
In addition to providing a review of previous archaeological
investigations in the North-central Texas archaeological
region, the chapter provides a synopsis of human prehistoric
and historic activities in and around PPMSP.

PreviouS iNveStigAtioNS
reGional
The North-central archaeological region of Texas with
few exceptions has not been the subject of intensive
archaeological study. Information pertaining to the
prehistoric record is generally lacking. This situation is
somewhat better for the historic record. The majority of past
archaeological investigations have consisted of reservoir

and roadway projects with few of those investigations
developed beyond the basic site identification and recording
stage. An examination of the Texas Archeological Sites
Atlas database lists 388 archaeological sites in Palo Pinto
County and 307 archaeological sites in Stephens County.
The types of sites found in either county are quite variable,
but open prehistoric campsites dominate the sample,
followed by lithic scatter and lithic procurement sites.
Historic sites include homesteads, agricultural/ranching
infrastructure, transportation facilities, and small industrial
facilities.
The regional database developed primarily through
information gleaned from multiple reservoir projects.
One exception to the predominance of reservoir projects
is the Harrell Site in south central Young County. It was
excavated by the Works Project Administration between
1938 and 1939 prior to the construction of the Possum
Kingdom Reservoir. The Harrell Site is the type site for the
Henrietta focus as defined by Alex Krieger in 1946. The
Henrietta focus dates to the Late Prehistoric period and is
a manifestation of the Southern Plains Village complex.
While present archaeological theory and method negate
some assumptions about its role within chronology, it
remains one of the few thoroughly investigated sites in
the region.
The creation of reservoirs for the developing Dallas/
Fort Worth area entailed archaeological investigation.
Stephenson (1949) recorded 27 prehistoric sites at
Lewisville Lake in Denton County during the Smithsonian
Institution River Basin Survey. Subsequent investigations
(Barber 1966; Harris 1951; Nunely 1973; Schiley et al 1985;
Stanford 1982; Yates 1984) have been initiated when the
volume of water is reduced, allowing further investigation
of known archaeological sites such as two Paleoindian
sites: Lewisville Site (41DN72) and the Aubrey Clovis
Site (41DN479).
Beginning in 1972, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers
initiated an archaeological investigation for the construction
of Lake Ray Roberts in Denton and Cooke Counties. This
investigation, lasting approximately 15 years, provided
much needed data about the Late Archaic and Late
Prehistoric periods, as well as historic period sites in the
North-central Texas region. The data recovered during
this investigation has in essence served as the basis for the
North-central Texas chronology.

Chapter 3

At present, the North-central Texas region is an essentially
rural area with little reason to mandate archaeological
investigations beyond small-scale projects. As such regional
prehistory likely will remain enigmatic for some time
to come. Fortunately, the history of the region has been
the subject of various local historical societies who have
contributed to our present knowledge of the region.

PrehiStoric culturAl SettiNg
The following prehistoric cultural history derives its
information from major reports by Hofman et al. (1989),
Peter and McGregor (1988), Prikryl (1987, 1990) and Yates
and Ferring (1986). The North-central Texas archaeological
region is generally divided into three periods that include the
Paleoindian (11,500–8,500 b.p.), the Archaic (8,500–1,200
b.p.), and the Late Prehistoric (1,200–250 b.p.). The Archaic
period is further subdivided into Early (8,500–6,000 b.p.),
Middle (6,000–3,500 b.p.), and Late (3,500–1,200 b.p.)
(Perttula 2004:9). The historic period in central and south
Texas begins with the arrival of the Spanish at the beginning
of the seventeenth century. However, the Spanish rarely
explored the North-central region, with the area mainly
inhabited by native groups until the 1830s. Thus, the period
from a.d. 1600 to 1800, is considered the Protohistoric
period for the Central Brazos River Basin area (Hunt et
al. 1989:7).

Paleoindian Period
The Paleoindian period of occupation in North-central Texas
is known through the presence of diagnostic lithic projectile
points including Clovis, Folsom, Dalton, Scottsbluff and
Plainview types, mainly from surface collections. Due
to the paucity of intact Paleoindian sites and the fact that
most artifacts are manufactured from non-local materials,
researchers characterize these Paleoindian groups as highly
mobile. As the presence of megafauna diminished and the
climate warmed following the end of the Pleistocene ice
age, these groups may have transitioned from a subsistence
base that emphasized big game supplemented with smaller
animal resources (i.e., smaller game species, turtles, and
snakes) and plant foods, to a hunter-gatherer adaptation
strategy with increased harvesting of floral species and
small game. Very few sites in this area exhibit definitive
contextual integrity; however, In addition, the Lewisville
and Aubrey Sites in North-central Texas showed discrete
Paleoindian components with the recovery of Clovis points
(Owens 2007). The Lewisville Site contained 27 hearth
features in association with a Clovis point and other sparse
lithics in a near-surface context (Crook and Harris 1957,
1958; Story 1990:182–184). The Aubrey Site contained a
Clovis component in association with cultural features and
concentrations of lithics and animal bones near the Elm Fork
floodplain in Denton County (Ferring 2001).

Late Paleoindian sites in the North-central Texas region,
such as the Ballew and Acton Sites, generally represent
either deflated late Paleoindian occupation or a mixed
assemblage that includes projectile points typologically
similar to other Paleoindian material in other areas (Peter
et al. 1990). Archaeological data concerning the late
Paleoindian period in the region is limited, and the ratio of
big-game hunting to smaller plant and animal subsistence
strategies is unknown. Point types dating to the late
Paleoindian period in the North-central region include
Angostura, Folsom, Plainview, Dalton, and Scottsbluff
(Green et al 2013). Some Plainview material associated
with a radiocarbon date of 9310 b.p. was found at the Horn
Shelter (Hunt et al. 1989; Peter et al. 1990).

archaic Period
The Archaic period is subdivided into Early (8,500–6,000
b.p.), Middle (6,000–3,500 b.p.), and Late (3,500–1,200
b.p.) based on perceived (though not fully agreed upon
by all scholars) technological, environmental, and
adaptive changes (Perttula 2004:9). In the eastern and
southwestern United States and on portions of the Great
Plains, development of horticultural-based, semi-sedentary
to sedentary populations succeeded the Archaic period. In
these areas, the Archaic truly represents a developmental
stage of adaptation as Willey and Phillips (1958) define it. It
generally is believed to represent a shift toward hunting and
gathering of a wider array of animal and plant resources and
a decrease in group mobility (Willey and Phillips 1958:107–
108). For North-central Texas, this characterization of the
Archaic is somewhat problematic. An increasing amount
of evidence suggests that Archaic-like adaptations were
in place before the Archaic (Bousman et al. 2002; Collins
2004:117–118, 1998; Collins et al. 1989) and that these
practices continued into the succeeding Late Prehistoric
period (Collins 2004:118–119; Prewitt 1981:74).

eArly ArchAic
Within the North-central Texas region, the Early Archaic
period (8,500–6,000 b.p.) is marginally better documented
than the Paleoindian period. Both Early and Middle Archaic
sites are few in number due to extensive erosion of midHolocene deposits (Ferring 1994). Lynott (1981) proposes
that population increased slowly over time, responding to
warmer and drier environmental conditions. It is thought
that these factors may have led Archaic populations of the
Cross Timbers and prairie areas of North-central Texas
to develop a diversified hunting and gathering pattern
based on bottomland resources of the rivers and major
creeks (Hofman 1989). In general, projectile points were
manufactured from local lithic sources suggesting that
populations were less mobile during the Early Archaic
period relative to the preceding Paleoindian period. The

Cultural Background
Early Archaic diagnostics include Angostura, Bulverde,
Gower, Hoxie, Martindale, Uvalde, and Wells projectile
points, as well as early split-stem projectile points.
The construction and use of rock hearths and ovens, which
had been limited during the Paleoindian period, become
commonplace in the Early Archaic. The use of rock features
suggests that retaining heat and releasing it slowly over
an extended period was important in food processing and
cooking and also reflects a specialized subsistence strategy.
Such a practice probably was related to cooking plant
foods, particularly roots and bulbs, many of which must
be subjected to prolonged periods of cooking to render
them consumable and digestible (Black et al. 1997:257;
Wandsnider 1997; Wilson 1930). Botanical remains, as
well as other organic materials, are often poorly preserved
in Early Archaic sites, so the range of plant foods exploited
and their level of importance in the overall subsistence
strategy are poorly understood. But recovery of charred wild
hyacinth (Camassia scilloides) bulbs from an Early Archaic
feature at the Wilson-Leonard Site provides some insights
into the types of plant foods used and their importance in
the Early Archaic diet (Collins 1998).

miDDle ArchAic
Cultural patterns during the Middle Archaic period
(6,000–4,000 b.p.), point toward an increasingly sedentary
population intensively harvesting acorns, pecans, cacti,
and hunting small and medium-size game such as deer and
turkey. However, there is evidence that large game hunting
(i.e., bison) in the early Middle Archaic again became an
important dietary component. Johnson and Goode (1994:25)
suggest that the Bell and Andice dart types are parts of a
specialized bison-hunting tool kit. Johnson and Goode
(1994:25) believe that an influx of bison and bison-hunting
groups from the Eastern Woodland margins during a slightly
more mesic period marked the transition from the Early
Archaic to the Middle Archaic. Bison populations decreased
as more xeric conditions returned during the latter part of
the Middle Archaic. It has been postulated that the shift
to drier conditions facilitated the development of special
thermal features for food processing. Specifically, burned
rock middens begin appearing in the archaeological record
at this time as a presumed adaptation to an intensified use
of geophytic or xerophytic plants more prevalent during
the drier climatic regime. Johnson and Goode (1994:26)
believe that the dry conditions promoted the spread of
yuccas and sotols, and that it was these plants that Middle
Archaic peoples collected and cooked in large rock ovens.
The Middle Archaic period site is recognized by the
presence of particular projectile points some of which
include Carrollton, Dawson, Morrill, Wells, and basalnotched forms such as Andice and Bell (Prikryl 1990).

15

Other artifacts from the Middle Archaic include choppers,
gouges, and expediency tools such as the small, bifacial
and unifacial Clear Fork tools. Grinding stones and bases,
referred to as manos and metates, show up in Middle
Archaic artifact assemblages as well as a number of
perforators, drills and awls.

lAte ArchAic
During the Late Archaic period, populations continue to
increase (Prewitt 1985:217). Prikryl (1990) describes a
threefold increase in the number of Late Archaic sites
compared to the earlier periods. Late Archaic diagnostics
includes Bulverde, Castroville, Dallas, Edgewood, Elam,
Ellis, Ensor, Gary, Godley, Marcos, Marshall, Palmillas,
Trinity, and Yarbrough. Projectile point styles overlap with
both Eastern and Central Texas archaeological regions
possibly suggesting increasing interaction with groups
in those regions (Green et al 2013). In addition, the first
evidence of ceramics was found at Cedar Creek and the
Richland-Chambers reservoirs at the eastern margins of
North-central region.
Deer, small game turtle, birds, fish, and a continuing
increase in the exploitation of plant resources (evidenced
by large, presumably communal burned rock features)
characterize subsistence adaptations during this period.
The so-called “Wylie pit” is a large human-made pit used
for the communal processing of plant foods. This suggests
that plant foods were part of a broad-based diet (Kibler and
Scott 2000:134) As with the early Middle Archaic, there
is evidence for temporary shifts to a specialized economy
focused on bison hunting (Kibler and Scott 2000:125–137).

late PrehiStoric Period
Prikryl (1990) divides the Late Prehistoric period into
two phases: Late Prehistoric I (1250–750 b.p.) and Late
Prehistoric II (750–350 B.P.). Late Prehistoric I is marked
by the introduction of the bow and arrow, as well as sandand-grog-tempered ceramics, appearing around 1000 B.P.
(Prikryl 1990). Diagnostics associated with this period
include Alba, Bonham, Catahoula, Scallorn and Steiner
arrow point types.
The Late Prehistoric II (750–350 b.p.) in North-central
Texas is influenced both by the southern Plains and eastern
Texas populations (Lynott 1981:106; Prikryl 1990:80).
Projectile points associated with this phase include Fresno,
Harrell, Maud, Perdiz, and Washita.
An apparent increase in bison use during this period is
identified by tools thought to be specific to bison processing,
including snub-nosed or thumbnail scrapers and edgebeveled Harahey knives. While bison continued to play an
important role in the subsistence base, presumably shrinking
territory sizes continued the trend toward horticulture and

16

Chapter 3

settled village life (Harris and Harris 1970; Morris and
Morris 1970). Bison scapulas, used as hoes, have been
recovered from sites in the Lewisville Lake and Lavon Lake
areas of Denton and Collin Counties (Barber 1969:118–119;
Harris 1945).
The Henrietta focus as defined by Krieger (1946) is the
southernmost manifestation of the Southern Plains Village
tradition. It dates from the Late Prehistoric period and
continues into the historic period. This complex extends
from the Red River south along the headwaters of the
Trinity and Brazos Rivers. The type site for the Henrietta
Focus is the Harrell Site (41YN1), recorded and excavated
between 1937 and 1938 by the Works Progress Adminis­
tration (WPA) as part of the Possum Kingdom Reservoir
project. Other excavated sites similarly attributed to the
Henrietta complex include the Coyote and Glass Sites
located on the Red River in Montague County (Lorrain
1967:24–44; Woodall 1967) and the Dillard Site in Cooke
County (Martin 1994).
The Henrietta Focus is recognized by shell-tempered
pottery, basally and notched triangular arrow points, beveled
knives, gravers, and scrapers (Drass 1998). Ground stone
tools include manos, matates, and abraders. The largest
village sites contained oval-shaped houses with interior
hearths and cylindrical cache pits (Drass 1998), although
no houses were found at the Harrell Site (Lynott 1977).
Maize has been recovered from many Henrietta Focus sites,
including Harrell (Drass 1998). Imported ceramics and
lithic materials suggest exchange with Southwest Pueblo
cultures to the west and Caddoan groups to the east (Drass
1998).
By the eighteenth century, immigrant Plains Indian groups
had moved into and beyond north-central Texas, and
their documentation by traders and explorers marks the
start of the historic period. Documentary sources suggest
that the Tonkawa, Apache, Comanche, Wichita, Kitsai,
Yojaune, Caddo, Delaware, and Kickapoo were within the
region at various times during the period (Campbell 1983;
Newcomb 1961; Newcomb and Campbell 1982). However,
archaeological sites that can be associated definitely with
historic groups are few. The Wichita are known to have
moved into Texas from Oklahoma and Kansas in the early
1700s. Sites attributable to the historic Witchita have been
identified at the edges of north-central Texas. Among these
is the Stansbury site located in Hill County, now inundated
by Lake Whitney (Stephenson 1970). Excavations at
the site produced burials, house structures, storage pits,
and a variety of aboriginal artifacts along with European
ceramics, glass beads, metal arrow points, and flintlock
musket parts. A cluster of Wichita sites also occurs to the
north along the Red River in Montague County. These sites
are known collectively as “Spanish Fort” and occur on both

the Oklahoma and Texas sides of the river. Woodall (1967b)
excavated one of these sites, named the Upper Tucker site;
it produced artifacts and features similar to those discovered
at the Stansbury site. Wichita sites both on the Brazos and
Red Rivers were located atop high terraces that overlook
the rivers.

hiStoric culturAl SettiNg
The following historic cultural history derives its infor­
mation from a variety of research of varying scope and
focus. These historic studies range from broad reviews that
encompass Texas as a whole to those that focus solely on
Palo Pinto and Stephens Counties.
The Historic period (a.d. 1630 to present) in Texas as a
whole roughly begins when Europeans first entered the
region. This period is typically recognized to have occurred
after a.d. 1550 to the late 1600s although European journeys
into the area were extremely rare. The first Europeans into
Texas were probably Spanish explorers and missionaries
unknowingly motivated by European politics (Foster 1995;
Murphy 2007). With the exception of these Spanish expe­
ditions or entradas, Texas during the early Historic period
was claimed by Spain but basically remained without an
established physical Spanish presence (Foster 1995; Taylor
1996). Further, the region encompassing PPMSP during this
time was inhabited by indigenous groups, which effectively
discouraged settlement into the region by Europeans.

SPaniSh colonial / mexican indePendence
Period (1630–1820S)
The Spanish Colonial period (a.d. 1630–1821) may be
characterized as the initial period of Aboriginal/European
contact and European settlement in Texas. During this time,
the region encompassing the PPMSP was inhabited by the
Comanche and Lipan Apache (Murphy 2007). Early over­
land Spanish entradas followed established Indian trade
routes, with the first led by Governor Alonso de Léon in
1689 and 1690 (Foster 1995).
As Spain tried to settle and make productive the vast re­
gion of Texas, the government needed people to move in
and begin the farming, mining, and ranching activities that
would generate revenue (Hall 2009). Motivated partly by a
fear of French expansion into this potential mining region,
the Spanish explored and established settlements in cen­
tral Texas during the latter part of the seventeenth century
(Foster 1995). The region north of Central Texas remained
unpopulated by Europeans.
Coinciding with the entradas was the introduction of the
horse into the Plains Indian culture. The horse was traded
or captured and by 1700 all Texas plains tribes had access
to the horse (Gwynne 2010). The horse permitted mobil­

Cultural Background
ity to hunt bison, to establish dominance over other tribes,
and to challenge European incursions. The Comanche, a
Shoshone tribe, mastered horsemanship and became the
dominant political, economic, and military power in the
Southern Plains region establishing the Comancheria. The
Comancheria was situated with the Southern High Plains
of Texas and Oklahoma, although the Comanche sphere of
influence included raids into northern Mexico as well as
trade with the Pueblos of the Northern Rio Grande Valley
in New Mexico. It was an effective military presence on
the Plains from the early 1700s through the 1840s, finally
defeated by the U.S. military in the 1870s.

rePublic oF texaS/Pre-ciVil War (1836–
1860)
During the Republic of Texas era, from 1836 to 1845, the
North-central region of Texas was not effectively settled by
Europeans and Americans until the mid-nineteenth century
due to on-and-off-again hostilities. One example of the
precariousness of settling the frontier was the attack on
Fort Parker in 1836. Fort Parker was established in Lime­
stone County in 1834. It was attacked by a combination of
Comanche, Kiowa, Wichita and Caddo tribes resulting in
the death of five individuals, the capture of five with ap­
proximately 25 escaping. One of the captive was Cynthia
Parker who became a member of the Comanche Naconi
band and married its leader Peta Nacona. She gave birth to
Quanah Parker, the last chief of the Comanche and a found­
ing member of the Native American Church.
William (Bigfoot) Wallace was the first to survey Palo
Pinto County in 1837. On December 29, 1845, Congress
signed the Texas Admission Act, the result of several years
of annexation debate. A few months later on February 19,
members of the newly formed state government conducted
a ceremony in front of the Capitol at Austin marking the
official annexation of Texas into the Union and the end of
the Republic of Texas (Campbell 2003:186; Miller and
Faux 1997:78).
Early settlers included Oliver Loving, Charles Goodnight,
and Reuben Vaughn who individually established the first
cattle ranches in the region. After the Mexican War, the
U.S. military urged by the Texas legislature to create a
buffer between the settlers and Plains tribes. The Wichita
signed treaties with both the Republic of Texas (1843) and
the U.S. government (1837 and 1856). However regional
conflict and misunderstandings between early settlers and
native groups resulted in the creation of the Brazos Indian
Reservation. It was formed in 1854, 12 miles south of Fort
Belknap in Young County from remnants of the Wichita,
Delaware, Shawnee, Tonkawa, and Caddo tribes. The res­
ervation was moved to the Indian Territories (present-day
Oklahoma) in 1856 due to the perception that reservation

17

members were responsible for cattle thefts and raids com­
mitted by the Comanche and Kiowa. From the early 1850s
until the beginning of the Civil War, the U.S. military en­
gaged in a numerous campaigns to pacify the region with
minimal success.
The Texas Legislature formed Palo Pinto County from
parts of Bosque and Navarro Counties in 1856 to develop
the jurisdictional infrastructure needed to foster regional
development. In 1858, Stephens County was formed from

the ciVil War (1860–1865)
Texas’ involvement in the Civil War is beyond the scope
of discussion here, although Texas played an integral part
for the Confederacy. The citizens of Texas overwhelmingly
approved of the secession from the Union. In a vote held
on February 23, 1861, 75 percent of the voters favored
secession (Campbell 2003: 244).
The feeling of secession held by the majority may be at­
tributed to the immigrants of Texas primarily coming from
southern, slave-holding states (Campbell 2003:207). These
immigrants brought with them the institution of slavery
and created an economy and society based on agriculture
(Campbell 2003:207). Texans of the North-central region
had mixed opinions concerning secession due in part to the
relatively low number of enslaved people. The 1860 cen­
sus documented a Palo Pinto County population of 1,524,
with a slave population of 130 while in Stephens County
the population was 198 with none listed as slaves (Hanna
2014; Leffler 2014a).
During the Civil War, the small farmers and ranchers of
North Texas were severely impacted by the Confederate
Conscription Act (1862) which called for military service
of all men over the age of 18 for a minimum of three years.
The Exemption Act passed five days after the Conscription
Act provided exemptions for a select few, mostly from the
upper economic class. The effect of these two acts further
exacerbated animosity between Unionists and Confederate
supporters. The “Great Hanging” in 1862 in Gainesville,
north of Fort Worth, is the culmination of the friction be­
tween Union sympathizers or perceived sympathizers and
Confederate authorities (McCaslin 1997). In October of
1862, Confederate authorities and mobs hanged approxi­
mately 40 men to suppress pro-Union activities in Gaines­
ville. The violence spread throughout the region resulting
in an unknown number of people killed.
With many of the men absent fighting in the war, raids
by hostile Comanche and the Kiowa increased within the
region (Rhoades 2009). Comanche raids would remain a
common occurrence until the 1870s. In 1872, a year thought
to be the worst in the hostilities, the justice of the peace for

the PoSt-ciVil War to early tWentieth
century (1865–1920)
Subsequent to the Civil War, Texas entered the Reconstruc­
tion period. To begin reconstruction, federal troops, in part,
had to spread the word of the Emancipation Proclamation
(Campbell 2003:268). In Galveston on June 19, 1865,
General Gordon Granger and the Union army spread the
word of the slaves’ emancipation (Campbell 2003:268).
Thus, this day became known as ‘Juneteenth’ and has
been celebrated by Texas African Americans ever since
(Campbell 2003:268).
After the Civil war, cattle became the dominant economic
driver of the region. Loving and Goodnight established
cattle trails to market the growing national demand for
beef (Leffler 2014a). In 1877, the Stock Raiser’s Associa­
tion was formed to combat cattle rustling, with C.L. “Kit”
Carter of Palo Pinto County its first president. By 1880,
there were 648 farms and ranches in Palo Pinto County
and approximately 42,500 head of cattle (Leffler 2014a).
In Stephens County, there were 567 farms and ranches and
approximately 35,000 head of cattle (Hanna 2014). Re­
covery during this period was slow but steady, assisted by
a diverse agricultural economy. Corn, oats, wheat and the
cash crop, cotton, emerged as primary crops. In addition,
sheep ranching was an important industry in both Stephens
and Palo Pinto Counties during the late nineteenth century
(Leffler 2014a, 2014b).

A railroad northeast of Strawn, the 25-mile long Weath­
erford, Mineral Wells, and Northwestern Railway, was
completed in 1891 and spurred the growth of Mineral
Wells (Leffler 2014a). In the early 1900s Mineral Wells
became famous for its mineral springs, whose water was
said to cure all ailments. The town experienced a tourism
boom and many hotels, drinking pavilions, and baths were
constructed in the 1920s.
Strawn was one of several area communities that grew up
around the Texas and Pacific Railway. In 1880 the town was
laid out on the land of two ranchers, Stephen Bethel Strawn
and James N. Stuart, and ultimately incorporated the small
nearby communities of Russell’s Pocket and Davidsonville
(Hunt 2013). Coal mining started in Strawn in 1903 when
the Mount Marian coal shaft was dug (Figure 3.2). The
mine was later sold and became the Strawn Coal Mining
Company (Hunt 2013).
Strawn benefited from the construction of the Bankhead
Highway, a transcontinental automobile route whose con­
struction began in 1916 in Washington, D.C. The highway
became a vital corridor between cities and also a popular
road-trip route for vacationers (Figure 3.3). The Bankhead
passed through Strawn between Palo Pinto and Ranger.
Portions of the Bankhead Highway, and many of Strawn’s
streets, were paved with red Thurber bricks. Thurber was
a company-owned coal mining and brickmaking town lo­
cated 5 miles southeast of Strawn in northern Erath County.
Thurber existed from 1886 to about 1937 (Maroney 2014).
At its height, Thurber was the principal bituminous-coal-

One invention that had an effect on Texas and its economy
during this time was barbed wire. Barbed wire, first
demonstrated in 1871, enabled ranchers to alter land and
cattle control to a less-intrusive, more profitable plan, and
brought additional commerce and trade to north central
Texas (NRHP 1976).
Though barbed wire was one of the largest influences on
Texas in general, the most influential ‘invention’ on the
region was the railroad. The completion of the Texas and
Pacific Railway through Palo Pinto and Stephens Counties
spurred regional growth resulting in the founding of Bra­
zos, Santo, Gordon, Mingus, and Strawn Counties (Leffler
2014a). The Texas and Pacific Railway was chartered in
1871 and was originally intended to extend to San Diego,
California. However, a financial crisis cancelled the ef­
fort to reach the Pacific Ocean and instead development
concentrated on Texas (Werner 2013). When the railroad
was complete in 1880, many new towns sprang up, helped
in part by advertisements that lured settlers to the newly
accessible lands (Figure 3.1).

mining town in Texas and had the largest brick plant west
of the Mississippi. Thurber’s population reached 10,000
by 1921 (Maroney 2014). However, in the early 1920s
railroad locomotives stopped using coal in favor of oil,
and coal prices dropped. In the early 1930s, roads were
increasingly paved with asphalt rather than brick. By the
late 1930s Thurber was a ghost town. The Thurber Historic
District is the only resource in the PPMSP vicinity listed in
the National Register of Historic Places (NRHP).

oil in January 1915, in the northwest corner of the Wil­
liam Dykes Survey approximately 2 miles west of Strawn,
and later referred to this well as Oil Well No. 1 (Freeman
2014). This discovery led to many more, including William
Knox Gordon’s McClesky Gusher, which kicked off the
oil boom in nearby Ranger (Figure 3.4). The area became
a significant producer of oil within a very short time. For
example, in 1921 the Breckinridge oilfield in Stephens
County accounted for 15 percent of all the oil produced in
the United States (Leffler 2014b).

In both Stephens and Palo Pinto Counties, oil was dis­
covered at the turn of the century and ultimately became
profitable and added another dimension to the regional
economy (Leffler 2014a, 2014b). Before 1915, some
success had been found in shallow wells that produced a
limited amount of oil and gas. However, in 1915, William
Knox Gordon struck oil west of Strawn within the current
boundaries of PPMSP (Freeman 2014). Gordon was a civil
engineer from Virginia who moved to Texas to survey a
proposed railroad route near Thurber. He was then hired
by the Texas and Pacific Coal Company and worked as an
engineer and manager at the coal mines in Thurber. During
this time, Gordon believed that the region also contained
oil and sought backing for his explorations.
Despite skepticism from Texas and Pacific Coal Company’s
president Edgar L. Marston and the company’s geologists,
Gordon persisted in exploratory drilling. He finally struck

One of the oil businesses active in the area was the Pierce
Oil Company (Freeman 2014). Their operations were lo­
cated along the Texas and Pacific Railway about 6 miles
west of Strawn near a railroad siding known as Wiles. The
railroad siding was originally called Canyon Station, and
was built on the only available level area in the Palo Pinto
Creek canyon (Kay 1958). The siding’s name was changed
to Wiles some time before 1910, and section quarters and
a telegraph station were constructed (Kay 1958) (Figure
3.5). During this time period it was common for simple
bunks, cabins, or converted rail cars to be used as housing
for switch men and track walkers assigned to the railroad
section (Figure 3.6). During the oil boom in about 1919
to 1921, spur tracks and additional buildings were con­
structed at Wiles. A 1922 U.S. Geological Survey bulletin
reports that Wiles was the largest settlement in the area, but
consisted of “only a few houses and is used principally as

operations” (Dobbin 1922). The Pierce oil camp near Wiles
is known to have contained worker housing and other build­
ings (Freeman 2014) (Figures 3.7 and 3.8).
In 1925, Camp Wolters was created near Mineral Wells
to train the Texas National Guard’s 56th Brigade (Minor
2014). During World War II, Camp Wolters was the U.S.
Army’s infantry replacement training center (Minor 2014).
The camp eventually became the largest training center in
the country. It was deactivated following the war but reac­
tivated in 1951, first as a U.S. Air Force facility and then
the Army’s Primary Helicopter Center until deactivation in
1975 (Minor 2014).
At the turn of the twentieth century, the population of Palo
Pinto and Stephens was 12,259 and 6,466, respectively
(Leffler 2014a, 2014b). By 1920 the population grew to
23,431 in Palo Pinto County and 15,403 in Stephens County
(Leffler 2014a, 2014b).

(1930–1950S)
During the Great Depression, the Franklin D. Roosevelt and
the Federal Government established the WPA in order to put
the nation’s unemployed to work building infrastructure,
public buildings, parks, and recreational facilities. Tucker
Lake, located within present-day PPMSP, was built by
the WPA as a drinking water reservoir for Strawn. Funds
for paving the slopes of the spillway and the stilling pool
($2,772) were approved in 1937 for the Russell Creek Dam
(WPA Work Project No. 9502). The lake was originally

named Strawn Lake but was renamed in honor of Strawn
mayor J.M. Tucker (Clark 2010). In the 1930s and 1940s,
vacation cottages were built on the west bank of the lake.
Supplies to build the cabins were brought in by boats from
the more accessible eastern shore (Clark 2010). The lake
became a popular spot for day-trippers as well (Figure 3.9).
The Palo Pinto County population totaled 17,576 in 1930
and increased to 18,356 in 1940 (Leffler 2014a). The
Stephens County population totaled 16,560 in 1930 and
decreased to 12,356 in 1940 (Hanna 2014). Difficult agricul­
tural conditions in the 1920s followed by the Great Depres­
sion and mechanization affected farming, the mainstay of
the region, resulting in a general population decline within
North-central Texas.
By 1940, the number and value of farms declined as mecha­
nization occurred and people began to migrate to urban
areas (Rhoades 2009). In Palo Pinto County, by 1950 the
number of farms decreased to 1,026, and the population
declined to 17,154 (Leffler 2014a). In Stephens County,
by 1950 the number of farms decreased to 685, and the
population declined to 10,597 (Hanna 2014). However,
oil and natural gas production increased during the 1950s
and remains a significant part of the modern economy of
both counties.

iNtroDuctioN
This chapter defines the methods and research domains
that guided the SWCA PPMSP archaeological survey.
The SWCA investigations focused on collecting data that
contributed to a reconstruction of prehistoric and historic
activities within the park that partially characterize human
adaptation in the region. Specific focus was given to data
that complemented the findings of the intensive historical
research, as well as the feasibility for advancing new
techniques (e.g., predictive modeling), methods, and
theories of analysis. Granted, the SWCA investigations
were solely at the survey level, but a holistic approach to
the cultural resources at the park utilizing various tools
(e.g., geographic information systems) and lines of inquiry
were believed to have potential to ultimately garner new
and beneficial information.

methoDology
backGround reVieW
As the first step in the studies, SWCA conducted a thorough
archaeological literature and records search of the project
area. For this research, an SWCA archaeologist examined
site files, records, and map files housed at the Texas
Archeological Research Laboratory (TARL) and the THC
library. Further, the Texas Archeological Sites Atlas (Atlas),
an online database, was examined for any previously
recorded surveys and historic or prehistoric archaeological
sites located in or near the project area. In addition to
identifying previously recorded archaeological sites, the
Atlas review included the following types of information:
NRHP properties, State Antiquities Landmarks (SALs),
Official Texas Historical Markers, Registered Texas Historic
Land Marks, and cemeteries.

hiStorical reSearch
SWCA conducted intensive historical research and archival
studies for the project, a task critical to reconstructing the
park history and understanding the archaeological record
These investigations involved the exploration of the history
of Tucker Lake, the Union Pacific Railroad, and related
facilities on or adjacent to park lands. The research focused
on the region’s original settlers and landowners, and land
use practices (e.g., cattle ranching) and their role in shaping

the region. Research was conducted using primary and
secondary sources such as books, historic newspapers
and other periodicals, deed records, United States Census
records, marker files for designated properties, and existing
survey reports. Archival repositories in both Austin and
the PPMSP area were visited, including the Dolph Briscoe
Center for American History, the Texas State Library and
Archives, the Strawn Historical Museum, and other local
repositories. In addition, research was conducted using
internet databases such as the Portal to Texas History and
the Texas State Historical Association’s online Handbook
of Texas. In addition, a historic map review of the project
area was also conducted. The results of the review are
presented in Appendix D. Finally, an intensive archival
review of PPMSP was conducted by Martha Doty Freeman
concurrently with the SWCA archaeological FY13 and
FY14 investigations. Freeman’s research is separate from
this document and referenced (Freeman 2014). However,
the results of Freeman’s standalone research was compared
with the results of SWCA archaeological investigations and
considered during interpretations and recommendations of
the historic sites.

PredictiVe modelinG and Field aPProach
Researchers have effectively used predictive modeling as
an analysis and management tool in archaeology since the
1980s (e.g., Altschul 1990; Kvamme 1985; Parker 1985).
Scientists have developed numerous methods of modeling,
ranging from simple univariate studies to complex multi­
variate statistical analyses. One such multivariate method,
called deductive modeling based on Kohler and Parker
(1986:432), takes the following assumptions in to account:
1. Humans make choices concerning location as
a. a mechanism for decision making; and
b. an end for decision making.
2. There are specific variables which affect locational
decisions.
3. These variables must be capable of operationalization,
with a means of measurement and allow for a set of pre­
dictions that can be compared with archaeological data.
By using these three basic assumptions, one can build a
complex multivariate model that considers numerous fac­

Figure 4.1.

tors concurrently. However, it has been noted that only a few
variables are necessary to generate a workable predictive
model (Dalla Bona 2000:81; Dean 1983:11; Kohler and
Parker 1986:433). Dalla Bona (2000) approached predic­
tive modeling by creating a weighted value model, where
it is assumed that different factors contributed differently
to the previous use of the landscape. Each variable is given
a different numeric weight to account for its contribution.
These weighted quantitative values are then combined to
produce a predictive map. The results were then subjected
to additional scrutiny by researchers to include local experi­
ence and knowledge of the study area.
As initially requested by TPWD in 2013, the PPMSP proj­
ect area was categorized by rank of probability (i.e., low,
medium, and high probability) of containing intact cultural
properties (Figure 4.1). SWCA’s methodology follows an
approach similar to that outlined above. The determination
of probability areas was based on a deductive weighted
predictive model that utilized numerous variables, includ­
ing topography (e.g., gradient of slope), soils, distance to
water (hydrology), elevation, roads, and disturbances. These
variables were chosen because they can be seen as proxies
for human spatial decisions for habitation locations. They
speak to access to water, food, and raw materials, as well
as integrity of deposits. Further, the model used the density
and nature of previously recorded cultural resources in the
surrounding four counties as well. Even more importantly,
after the first round of field surveys in PPMSP FY13, survey
results were integrated into the model, further strengthen­
ing its potential. In short, the predictive model was reactive
to new sources of data, which provided the most accurate
guidance possible and intended to assist TPWD with future
planning and acquisitions.

PreDictive moDel methoDS
Based on Dalla Bona’s methodology, SWCA developed a
deductive, weighted predictive model to be implemented
at PPMSP. Locational data for all of the archaeological
sites (n=728) from the four counties surrounding PPMSP
(Palo Pinto, Stephens, Erath, and Eastland) were obtained
from the TARL.
The variables selected to drive the model were soils, sur­
face geology, distance to water (hydrology), and elevation.
These variables were chosen because they meet the three
basic assumptions required for modeling. These variables
in particular can be seen as proxies for human spatial de­
cisions for habitation locations as they speak to access to
water, food, and raw materials.
Nominal data are required as inputs for the analysis. As
such, distance to water and elevation were reclassified into
usable categories. National Hydrographic Data (NHD) was
buffered into distance bands of 100, 200, 300, 400, 500,

25

and 1000 meters. Elevation data were categorized into five
categories of 200–297, 297–374, 374–451, 451–528, and
528–605 meters based on the Jenks optimization method.
Using ArcGIS’s “intersect tool,” the location of each
archaeological site and their underlying environmental
variables were tabulated.
These results were subsequently subjected to a Chi Square
test to show if there is a statistical relationship between
archaeological site location and underlying environmental
variables. Based on positive results, the categories of each
variable were coded with a value of “2” if they showed a
greater number of expected values than observed values,
a value of “1” if there were an approximate equal number
of expected values compared to observed values, or “0” if
there were more expected values than observed. Upon cod­
ing these values, the results were converted to raster data
sets and added together using ArcGIS’s “Map Algebra”
function (CodedSoilsRaster + CodedHydrologyRaster +
CodedElevationRaster + CodedGeologyRaster).
This raster data set was clipped to the project area and clas­
sified into three categories based on equal intervals Low
(0–3), Medium (3–6), and High (7–9). Slopes greater than
20 percent were also factored in to remove areas that would
be infeasible and unlikely to contain intact deposits warrant­
ing evaluation. The resulting model identified that approxi­
mately 36 percent of the park area was of low probability,
36 percent was of medium probability, and 28 percent was
of high probability for locating archaeological sites.
For the PPMSP study, high probability areas were defined
as locales that possess or have an elevated likelihood of
containing cultural resources. These areas are generally
identified by documentation, such as historic structures
depicted on USGS topographic maps, or by distinct
landforms and soil deposits that have been shown in
local and regional surveys to contain archaeological sites.
Prehistoric sites in the region are generally located in three
topographic settings: 1) near permanent and/or seasonal
water sources in the uplands like springs and ephemeral/
intermittent drainages; 2) rock shelters in bluffs along
drainages; and 3) terraces of the Palo Pinto Creek and other

perennial streams. Prehistoric sites in the region tend to
include campsites and scatters of chipped stone and burned
rock middens located near springs or other water sources
in the uplands, and buried sites on flood plain terraces of
drainages.
In PPMSP, SWCA defined the high potential areas to
include ridge and toe slope landforms at and adjacent to the
creek and its tributaries and the crest of landforms above
moderately steep slopes. As previously indicated, soils in
these areas are mainly mapped Set-Palo Pinto Set-Palo Pinto
complex, 8 to 40 percent slopes, extremely stony, OwensHarpersville complex, 8 to 45 percent slopes, extremely
boulder, and Set clays, 1 to 5 percent slopes.
Of the surveyed areas in PPMSP, approximately 933
acres compose ridges and ridgelines, identified by SWCA
as having the probability to contain a high potential
to yield archaeological sites (Figure 4.2; Table 4.1).
SWCA concentrated the archaeological survey in areas
and landforms that were considered to have the highest
probability of containing significant archaeological sites of
prehistoric and historic age. This allowed the archaeological
survey investigations and permitted any future management
actions to focus on the sites that promised to contribute new
and important information on the prehistory and history
of this part of North-central Texas, and readily allow the
development of accurate zones of high, medium, and low
archaeological sensitivity.
For project areas larger than 200 acres, the THC recommends
consultation with them regarding survey methodology prior
to instigating fieldwork. However, solely for planning
purposes and in coordination with the TPWD, SWCA
utilized the standards suggested for project areas 200 acres
in size or less for the defined high probability acreage.
Specifically, these standards indicate one shovel test for
every 3 acres, unless it can be demonstrated that due to
disturbances or setting, fewer shovel tests are sufficient to
adequately assess the potential for buried cultural resources
to be present. According to THC standards, roughly 300
shovel test excavations would be needed to investigate
PPMSP high probability zones. SWCA examined the
identified high probability areas with typical shovel test
intervals ranging from 30 to 60 m apart. Notably, in high
probability areas where backhoe trenching was warranted
and shovel testing was intended to supplement the trenching,
testing intervals ranged from 60 to 100 m apart.
The Medium probability areas were defined as locales
where archaeological resources/sites are possibly absent
or have moderate potential to be present (e.g., certain
uplands, slopes or terrace settings) (Figure 4.2; see Table
4.1). The medium probability areas differed slightly from
the high probability areas in that they had a slightly greater
distance to water, situated on a higher gradient slope,

27

and/or had a higher elevation. Based on these criteria,
roughly 1,266 acres of the surveyed acreage in PPMSP
is identified by SWCA as having a medium probability to
contain archaeological sites, particularly those with buried
deposits. According to THC standards, roughly 420 shovel
test excavations would be needed to investigate PPMSP
medium probability zones. SWCA examined the medium
probability areas with shovel test intervals ranging from
60 to 100 m apart.
The Low probability areas are defined as locales where
archaeological resources/sites are likely absent or have low
potential to be present (e.g., steep slopes or very recent
alluvial flood plains) (Figure 4.2; see Table 4.1). The low
probability zones within PPMSP are characterized as broad,
uplands, steep slopes, and disturbed areas. Understandably,
most low probability acreage defined by SWCA is away
from water sources with little to no soil or potential for sites
such as rock shelters. Based on these criteria, about 1,230
acres of the surveyed acreage in PPMSP is identified by
SWCA as having a low probability to contain archaeological
sites, particularly those with buried deposits.
Low probability areas were evaluated with a pedestrian
survey and shovel test excavation, which was very
selectively used. Accordingly, the shovel test coverage
in these areas varied widely and was determined by the
experience of the SWCA archaeologist who was guided by
the presence of intact soils, degree of slope, and identified
disturbance. The shovel test intervals in these areas typically
ranged from 100 to 200 m apart.

General SurVey methodS
In all settings, archaeologists surveyed in 30-m-wide
transects, examining the ground surface and erosional
profiles for cultural resources. Shovel tests were excavated
where appropriate to test for subsurface archaeological
deposits and to assess the geomorphic setting of the area.
When conducted, shovel tests were excavated in 20-cm
arbitrary levels to 1 m in depth or to culturally sterile
deposits, whichever came first. The matrix was screened
through ¼-inch mesh. The location of each shovel test was
plotted using a Global Positioning System (GPS) receiver
with submeter accuracy, and each test was recorded on
Portions of the project encompass settings along Palo
Pinto Creek that have the potential for deeply buried
archaeological sites. The primary method for quickly and
efficiently exploring these areas is backhoe trenching. In
these settings, trenches are usually placed approximately
100 to 300 m apart, with tighter intervals if necessary.
At PPMSP, trench placement was based on the level of
disturbance within the project area, the location of buried
utilities, the location of any previously impacted areas,
encountered deposits, and the preservation potential for

28

Chapter 4

archaeological sites. Backhoe trenches were excavated
to a depth sufficient to determine the presence/absence
of buried cultural materials and allowed the complete
recording of all features and geomorphic information to
depths of project impacts. Generally, trenches were 1.5 to
2.0 m deep, 6 to 8.0 m long, and 1.5 m wide. The trenching
was monitored by a competent SWCA archaeologist while
excavations are underway. Stratigraphic profile drawings
with soil descriptions were recorded for each trench by an
experienced SWCA archaeologist. All Occupational Safety
and Health Standards (OSHA) safety protocols were used in
these trenches and excavations were backfilled and leveled
upon completion of recording.
All artifacts encountered during shovel testing were collected
and a sample of temporally diagnostic artifacts observed
on the surface of all archaeological sites was collected.
Similarly, all temporally diagnostic artifacts encountered
atop the ground surface were mapped and collected and
were considered an isolated find unless associated with
an archaeological site. Hand-held submeter GPS receivers
were used to provide accurate, fast plotting of any site
areas in relation to the property boundaries. Appropriate
State of Texas Archaeological Site Data Forms were filled
out for each site discovered during the investigations. A
detailed plan map of each site was produced and locations
were plotted on USGS 7.5-minute topographic maps and
relevant project maps.
All discovered archaeological sites encountered in PPMSP
during the investigations were explored as much as possible
with consideration to land access constraints beyond TPWD
boundaries. At least eight shovel tests were excavated on
a cardinal grid at each newly discovered site (as per THC
standards) to determine their size and depth, as well as
their depositional character and contextual integrity. Two
negative shovel tests in each direction were used to identify
site boundaries, as well as clear changes in landform
character, slope, erosion, and the boundaries of PPMSP.

Site eValuationS
Each prehistoric and/or historic archaeological site
discovered during the survey was evaluated for suitability
for official SAL designation, with reference to the criteria
given in 13 TAC 26.10, of the Rules of Practice and
Procedure for the Antiquities Code of Texas, and for
eligibility for inclusion to the NRHP according to 36 CFR
60.4. Recommendations regarding the suitability of each
archaeological site for these official designations were
made in support of TPWD’s commitment to establishing
priorities for effective archaeological resource preservation
and management, and to providing a foundation for longrange planning.

For official SAL designation, five criteria for each
archaeological site were relevant: 1) has potential to
contribute to a better understanding of the prehistory or
history of Texas; 2) contains preserved, intact archaeological
deposits; 3) possesses unique or rare attributes related to
Texas prehistory or history; 4) provides opportunities to
test theories and methods of preservation contributing to
new scientific knowledge; and 5) target or likely target of
vandalism or relic collecting.
NRHP eligibility of resources was assessed utilizing these
four criteria: a) associated with events that have made a
significant contribution to the broad patterns of our history;
or b) associated with the lives of persons significant in our
past; or c) that embody the distinctive characteristics of a
type, period, or method of construction, or that represent
the work of a master, or that possess high artistic values, or
that represent a significant and distinguishable entity whose
components may lack individual distinction; or d) that have
yielded, or may be likely to yield, information important in
prehistory or history.

laboratory methodS
All artifacts recovered from the newly recorded
archaeological sites were collected, bagged, and labeled
according to the TPWD lab manual. Specifically, the
archaeological collections were organized by site and
given lot numbers before being cleaned and catalogued.
All materials were cleaned and stabilized using appropriate,
nondestructive, and reversible techniques. Each site was
given its own set of lot numbers, beginning with lot number
one. The lot numbers and bag information was recorded on a
Lot Number Inventory List for each site. All written records
pertaining to the excavation, handling and conservation of
the artifactual materials will be curated with the materials.
This includes the original catalogs—field and laboratory,
and the final specimen inventory. TPWD Archeology
Laboratory will serve as the curation facility for this project.

SettiNg

Cultural resources investigations were conducted by SWCA
in the PPMSP in several phases between June 2013 and
May 2014. The main objective of the investigations was
to identify any prehistoric and historic archaeological
sites within the boundaries of the park, establish vertical
and horizontal site boundaries as appropriate, and evaluate
each site for its eligibility for inclusion to the NRHP
and for designation as an SAL. The site evaluations also
considered the management priorities and recommendations
for management practices for the identified resource (Table
5.1).

At the time of SWCA investigations, PPMSP was recently
established and consisted of approximately 4,395 acres,
including the 206-acre Tucker Lake (Figure 5.2 Appendix
C). The park extends about 6 miles east to west and 2 miles
north to south with the western, southern, and eastern
boundaries defined by property fence lines. With the
exception of the far western end of PPMSP, the northern
boundary follows Palo Pinto Creek along the south side of
the drainage. The park is a mixture of broad upland ridges
and lowland valleys. The upland ridges align and overlook
the Palo Pinto Creek valley to the north and typically have
steep to very steep slopes. The PPMSP upland slopes
hydrologically drain into tributaries of varying size and
magnitude, which generally run northward to empty into
Palo Pinto Creek. Vegetation is varied across PPMSP, with
scattered to very thick cedar, short grasses, and cacti in the
uplands and side slopes while the lowlands have mixed
hardwoods, occasional green briar, and short grasses.

The fieldwork for PPMSP occurred over multiple
mobilizations and consisted of multiple teams of SWCA
archaeologists evaluating roughly 3,400 acres of the park.
Specifically, the 2013 investigations examined over 1,000
acres consisting of more than 26 miles of proposed roadway
and boundary fence lines and about 850 acres in varioussized survey blocks. The 2014 investigations examined
about 2,400 acres and focused on five survey blocks of
varying sizes arranged in “priority areas” for use by the
TPWD.
Across both years, the fieldwork resulted in the excavation
of 2,512 shovel tests and 19 backhoe trenches, the discovery
of 69 isolated finds (IFs), and the documentation of 40
archaeological sites within the surveyed areas (Figure 5.1;
Appendix C). The PPMSP survey results indicate a long and
varied history of human subsistence, occupation, activity,
and recreation. The 40 archaeological sites within PPMSP
range from prehistoric Paleoindian activity to twentiethcentury cedar chopping and petroleum exploration
sites. The 69 IFs, are scattered throughout PPMSP and
consist of historic and prehistoric artifacts (Appendix
C). Each IF, when discovered, was investigated as if it
were an archaeological site, but was then designated an
IF after determining there was insufficient data to warrant
recordation as an archaeological site.
This chapter first discusses the general setting and
geomorphology encountered in PPMSP, followed by a
detailed description of each archaeological site. The chapter
concludes with a description of the IFs encountered during
the PPMSP cultural resources survey.

Drainages within PPMSP consist of the aforementioned
Palo Pinto and Russell Creeks and their tributaries. Palo
Pinto Creek, as it passes through the park, has a sinuosity
ratio (SR) of 1.4 designating it as a sinuous channel
(Charlton 2008). This indicates that the drainage has had
some lateral migration across the valley floor. Notably, the
presence of a relict channel of Palo Pinto Creek suggests
that the drainage likely has had a higher SR in the past with
a higher hydrologic flow (Figure 5.3). The SR of a waterway
has implications for archaeological site integrity, depending
on whether the site is situated on the interior or exterior
of a meander bend. Simply put, an interior meander bend
would be conducive to preservation and integrity of cultural
resources that may be present. Generally, all of the PPMSP
drainages have a riffle and pool base with clast materials
ranging from boulders to pebbles, which can suggest
“flashy” hydrologic flow (Knighton 1998).
Maintained features within or adjacent to PPMSP include
the Tucker Lake reservoir and associated features (e.g.,
dam), Farm-to-Market (FM) 2372, Union Pacific railroad
and right-of-way (ROW), a small City of Strawn picnic
area, and numerous roads in varying stage of development.
Portions of the park have been, and occasionally still are
used, for petroleum exploration and drilling, ranching, and
cedar harvesting.

geomorPhology
The park uplands have prevalent areas of exposed sandstone
or limestone bedrock with eroding sandstone or limestone
cobbles and gravels. In these areas soils are thin or non­
existent, which depending on the parent material are dark
calcareous clay loam (limestone) or red sands (sandstone).
Overall, the observed PPMSP soils are attributable to three
types of parent material. With few exceptions, these soils
include dark grayish-brown to brown (10YR4/2–4/3) loam/
clay loams, strong brown to reddish-brown (7.5YR5/6–
5YR4/6) sandy loams, and brown to yellowish-brown
(10YR5/3–5/4) silt loams. The brown loam/clay loam and
the strong brown to reddish-brown sandy loam almost
exclusively occupy the upland areas and adjoining slopes.
The loam/clay loams are derived from the limestone
bedrock in the park while the sandy loams are attributed
to the sandstone bedrock in the area.
The remaining silt loam was observed along Palo Pinto
Creek and some of its tributaries. The examination of
the cut bank profiles along Palo Pinto Creek and some
select tributaries revealed some very deep (greater than
3 m) alluvial deposits in some locations (Figures 5.4 and
5.5). The main channel of the drainage has meandered
considerably for some time with occasional high energy
flashy deposits, but there does appear to be some large
pockets of integrity, including the area around site 41SE312,
discussed below.

the foot slopes of some of the surrounding uplands. These
investigations typically encountered a surface horizon of
very dark grayish-brown to brown (10YR3/2–4/3) loam/
sandy loam with subangular blocky structure with a clear
and smooth lower boundary. Underlying the surface horizon
is a stratum of brownish yellow (10YR5/6–6/6) loam/clay
loam with an angular/subangular blocky structure and clear
and smooth lower boundary. This horizon typically overlies
a brownish-yellow (10YR6/6) clay loam/silty clay with
an angular blocky structure, calcium carbonate (CaCO3)
filaments ranging from 8 to 15 percent that increased in
size and frequency with depth. The lower boundary of
this horizon was generally unobserved, but in BHT03 was
abrupt and irregular, overlying degrading limestone bedrock
(Appendix B).
In contrast to the predominant backhoe trench stratigraphy,
several trenches (BHTs 17 and 19), closer to the upland foot
slope, had a stratigraphy that was notably more shallow and
rockier. These deposits appear to be from colluvial wash.
Similarly, BHTs 14 and 15 also contained shallow, rocky
strata with subrounded/rounded cobbles and gravels. These
deposits are likely point bar deposits from the meandering
Palo Pinto Creek.
Overall, these deposits most closely correlate with the
description of the occasionally flooded Bosque clay
loam, characterized as very deep soil derived from loamy,
calcareous alluvial sediment parent material (NRCS 2014).

In select low land areas near Palo Pinto Creek, backhoe
trench excavations were conducted during the PPMSP survey
(Appendices B and C). Nineteen trenches were placed on the
margins of the flood plain, on prominent terraces, and along

In regard to prehistoric lithic raw materials in the PPMSP
area, no toolstone sources (i.e., quarries) were identified
during the survey. However, chert raw material of moderate
quality was occasionally observed scattered on the ground

surface in PPMSP. This slightly white- to grey-colored
raw material consists of small (less than 6 cm diameter),
angular chert cobbles and gravels that were infrequently
observed scattered along some of the foot slopes of the
upland ridges at the western end of the park. A small portion
of the debitage encountered at several of the prehistoric
sites along Palo Pinto Creek contained chert that is similar
in appearance to this raw material. Although not definitive,
there may be a chert raw material source within PPMSP or
upstream from the park.

ArchAeologicAl SiteS
The SWCA cultural resources investigations for FY13
and FY14 in PPMSP culminated in the documentation of
40 archaeological sites (see Figure 5.1; Appendix C). The
archaeological sites are roughly split between 17 (43%)
prehistoric and 18 (45%) historic occupations/activities.
Five sites (12%) contain activity from both prehistoric and
historic occupations. Not surprisingly, the historic sites are
primarily located in uplands and along roadways while the
prehistoric sites are situated along drainages including Palo
Pinto Creek and its tributaries.
All of the archaeological sites in PPMSP were evaluated for
their eligibility for inclusion to the NRHP using Criteria A,
B, C, or D of 36 CFR 60.4. The Criteria A, B, and C were
particularly evaluated for each of the historic sites. All
of the historic and prehistoric sites were considered under
Criterion D, which considers its ability to yield information
important in history or prehistory. Similarly, SWCA also
evaluated each site’s eligibility for SAL designation
according to 13 TAC 26.10. Finally, the site evaluation
process also involved formulating management priorities
and recommendations for management practices for each
identified resource (Table 5.1).
The detailed archaeological site discussion below is arranged
by year of discovery. Specifically, the archaeological sites
discovered in FY13 are discussed first followed by the FY14
archaeological sites.

fy13 ArchAeologicAl SiteS
Site 41PP389
Site 41PP389 is a surficial multicomponent site situated
on an upland terrace overlooking Palo Pinto Creek to the
north. The site spans the edge of a rocky, erosional upland
terrace bordered by a steep drop in elevation to the north
and a steep upward slope to the south (Figure 5.6; Appendix
C.6). The site was originally identified by Tarrant County
Archaeological Society (TCAS) volunteers. Intensive
pedestrian survey identified a somewhat diffuse yet
clustered accumulation of prehistoric debitage and chipped
stone tools, as well as a sparse scatter of historic debris. The

vegetation on the site is a mixture of cedar and sparse oak
trees with an understory of short grasses and cacti. The site
is bound by natural topography to the north and south and
the extent of cultural materials to the east and west.
Prehistoric artifacts were observed diffusely scattered
along the landform with small concentrations observed
in areas subject to frequent erosional processes. A lowlying wash area located near the center of the site contains
an accumulation of roughly 20 tertiary chert flakes, two
early-stage bifaces, and four late-stage biface fragments.
The artifacts are primarily composed of chert, although the
two early-stage bifaces appear to be composed of coarsegrain materials similar to basalt. Notably, 41PP389 is the
only site in PPMSP observed to contain this coarse-grained
material. The artifact cluster is likely a product of frequent
slope wash. One fragmented dart point was also observed
on the ground surface, yet lacks temporally diagnostic
characteristics (Figure 5.7). A prominent landmark is
located near the eastern extent of the site, which is a knoll
covered with limestone cobbles and gravels that appears to
have been historically quarried at some point in the recent
past. Notably, only two chert flakes, a biface fragment, and
the dart point fragment were collected for TPWD curation
(Appendix E).
The historic component consists of a sparse quantity of
artifacts diffusely scattered across the site. Remnants of
an overhead telephone or utility line were observed with
one power line pole lying on the ground surface next to
its original location. In addition, an aqua-colored glass
insulator was observed on a minor slope somewhat close
to the transmission line pole. Other historic artifacts were
observed throughout the site area including crushed tin can
fragments and crushed sanitary cans. One clear glass bottle
neck finish was observed exhibiting a slightly solarized
double-ring neck. This type of finish usually employed a
cork closure and was in common production between 1850
and 1910 for patent medicine bottles, liquor flasks, sauce or
narrow neck food bottles, and ink bottles (IMACS 2001).
Lastly, one slightly solarized clear glass bottle base was
observed. The base is plain oval in shape and contains an
embossed basket-like pattern. The historic component of
the site likely dates to the early to mid-twentieth century.
A total of 16 shovel tests (AE50, AE62, AY55, KL60,
KL68–69, KL202–203, KS71, SRS40–41, SRS134,
WV57–59, and WV157) were excavated within site
41PP389 revealing very rocky sandy loam to an average
depth of 15 centimeters below surface (cmbs). All shovel
tests were negative for cultural materials and terminated at
bedrock (Appendix A).

the upland ridge. Artifacts observed include common
houseware items such as enamelware bowl fragments,
whiteware and porcelain sherds, and bottle glass fragments.
A small burn pile located in the south central portion of the
site contains a low quantity of brick fragments, glass shards,
and miscellaneous metal fragments. A few large pieces of
lumber were noted near a partially crushed lantern. One
possible well or cistern is located on the eastern side of the
site. The apparent feature consists of a circular depression
measuring approximately 4.5 feet (1.5 m) in diameter
(Figure 5.9). The depression is lined with tabular chunks
of local bedrock. The feature is infilled and overgrown with
cedar, which precluded further investigation. The historic
assemblage of the site likely dates to the mid-twentieth
century.

41PP389 SummAry AND recommeNDAtioNS
Site 41PP389 is a purely surficial scatter of fragmentary
prehistoric and historic artifacts. The prehistoric component
is composed of lithic debitage and chipped stone tools
of unknown age or cultural affiliation while the historic
component is composed of fragmented artifacts dating to the
early to mid-twentieth century. Based on the sparse quantity
of diffusely scattered artifacts, highly erosional setting,
and no potential for intact, buried cultural deposits, SWCA
recommends that site 41PP389 is not eligible for inclusion
to the NRHP or for designation as an SAL; accordingly, no
further archaeological work is recommended. Although the
surficial nature of the site and its location within a public
park makes it a likely target of vandalism or relic collecting,
the assemblage is very fragmentary and has been certainly
reworked by erosion. No monitoring or management is
recommended.

Site 41Se308
Site 41SE308 is a historic mid-twentieth-century artifact
scatter initially identified by a dense scatter of fragmented
glass and whiteware within a two-track road (Figure 5.8;
Appendix C.7). The site is situated on a gently sloping
landform 200 m south of Palo Pinto Creek. The vegetation
on the site is generally open with scattered cedar and a few
oak trees with an understory of short grasses and cacti. The
extent of cultural materials extends 200 m northwest to
southeast and 150 m northeast to southwest.
Intensive surface inspection revealed a moderately dense
scatter of surficial artifacts extending along the edge of

Notably, a diagnostic assortment of artifacts (i.e., a complete
clear glass bottle, clear glass “Illinois” bottle base, round
metal nail, decorative iron fragment, amethyst glass shard,
clay pipe fragment, whiteware fragment, clear glass shard,
milk glass fragment, and a metal belt stud) were collected
for TPWD curation (Appendix E).
A total of eight shovel tests (AE53–54, AE63–64, KS64,
KS72, SRS42, and WV60) were excavated within the site
area revealing rocky clay loam to an average depth of 30
to 40 cmbs (Appendix A). All shovel tests were negative
for cultural materials and terminated at bedrock. Artifacts
observed were heavily fragmented and/or burned and
generally clustered along the two-track road. The landform
has been heavily affected by the existing two-track road
and extensive mechanical vegetation clearing and burning.
Large cedar push piles are common across the site area. The
small amount of structural debris and the possible well/
cistern suggest a longer period of habitation or repeated
visits and the site may represent the remnants of a possible
hunting or oil field camp.
Freeman’s (2014:127–137) archival research encompassed
site 41PSE308, which is indicated to be within the in the
James Price survey. This survey is a 320-acre tract of land
in Stephens County patented to James H. Price in 1872,
along with another 320 acres in Eastland County. In 1882
Price sold the Stephens County land to L.G. Merrill of
Wisconsin. In 1901, Nancy Merrill sold the Price survey
land to Stockman Sam A. Satterfield, less an approximately
12-acre right of way deeded to the Texas & Pacific Railroad
Company. When Sam Satterfield and his wife Rhoda died,
their children claimed possession of the Price land, with
son Henry C. Satterfield holding 3/4 interest and daughter
Mrs. Mary H. Thomas holding 1/4. In 1918, last remaining
heir Mary E. Thomas took possession of the land and
conveyed one-half interest to her son Randle B. Thomas.
He obtained the other half after her death in 1920. He lost

the land in a lawsuit in 1932, and the Stockyards National
Bank sold it to North Texas Farms, Inc. in 1934. In 1939
North Texas Farms Inc. conveyed the land to J.P. Kittrell,
who then sold it to Shalor Copeland in 1941. In 2011, the
Copeland family transferred the tract to TPWD for the
PPMSP (Freeman 2014:127–137). The artifact assemblage
for the site corresponds to the time that the Copeland family
owned this property.

Site 41SE308 is a historic artifact scatter with one
possible well/cistern feature. The majority of artifacts are
fragmented and likely displaced due to extensive vegetation
clearing and road construction. The site appears to have
been almost completely destroyed based on the extent of
prior disturbances. Furthermore, the artifact assemblage
correlates with the time the Copeland family owned
the property. None of these individuals are recorded as
historically prominent individuals at a local, regional, or
national level. Therefore, the site offers limited research
potential based on the extensive, severe disturbances
and the sparse quantity of cultural materials that are

44

Chapter 5

diffusely scattered over a heavily trafficked area. SWCA
recommends that the site is not eligible for inclusion to the
NRHP or eligible for designation as an SAL. No further
archaeological work is recommended and no monitoring
or conservation measures are warranted.

Site 41Se309
Site 41SE309 is a multicomponent site including one piece
of prehistoric lithic debitage and a historic artifact and
debris scatter. The site is located on a prominent upland
ridge south of Palo Pinto Creek (Figure 5.10; Appendix
C.7). An unnamed tributary to Palo Pinto Creek flows
northward along the western edge of the site area. The site
area has been previously subjected to extensive vegetation
removal as evidenced by large, deteriorating brush piles.
The vegetation on the site is open with a few hardwoods
(e.g., oaks) and an understory of short grasses and thistle.
The site is bounded by the extent of cultural materials to
the north, east, and south and the tributary to the west, and
is roughly 300 m north to south and 200 m east to west.

Figure 5.10.

Site map 41SE309.

The site predominantly consists of a broad, diffuse scatter of
fragmentary historic debris. An accumulation of roughly 20
brick and brick fragments were observed within a recently
cleared area near the center of the ridge. The bricks are
impressed with “EVENS.HOWARD/EXTRA” that likely
corresponds with the Evens & Howard Fire Brick Company
originally established in St. Louis in 1855 by Richard Howe
(Heinrich and Leighton 1909). Small, clear glass shards;
round nails; and decorative iron fragments were observed
scattered throughout the brick accumulation.
A possible well/cistern is located just northeast of the brick
scatter near the northeast edge of the landform. The feature
is composed of a circular depression, measuring roughly
4.5 feet (1.5 m) in diameter, lined with tabular pieces of
local limestone bedrock (Figure 5.11). The feature is infilled
and overgrown and only few pieces of rusted metal were
observed in proximity to the feature. The surface scatter
extends south across a dirt two-track and onto an erosional
slope. Two horseshoes, roughly ten crushed tin cans, one
cobalt glass shard, and ten clear glass shards were observed

in the road and the erosional slope. One brown glass beer
bottle was observed between the brick scatter and the twotrack road that dates to the early twentieth century based
upon the semi-automatic manufacturing technique and the
embossing “N.B.B.G. Co.” corresponding to the North
Baltimore Bottle and Glass Company (IMACS 2001). No
additional structural debris was observed in the site area.
The historic component of the site likely dates to the early
or mid-twentieth century.
Of note, a diagnostic assortment of artifacts (i.e., brown
glass bottle, brick fragment, round metal nail, and metal
handle with hinges) were collected for TPWD curation
(Appendix E).
Ten shovel tests (AE44, AE82, AY56–59, KS83–84,
MC30, and WV63) were excavated at the site, of which
one (MC30) was positive for cultural material. Shovel test
MC30 revealed one large, secondary flake composed of dark
gray fossiliferous chert at 0 to 20 cmbs. In general, shovel
tests revealed shallow, rocky soils (Appendix A). The site
has been heavily impacted by recent mechanical vegetation
removal, road construction, and frequent slope wash.
Similar to site 41SE308 above, this site is located in the
James Price survey of which Freeman (2014:127-137)
conducted an intensive archival review. The chain of title
information and the temporally diagnostic historic artifacts
for this site correlates with the time that either the Kittrell
or Copeland families owned this property.

41Se309 SummAry AND recommeNDAtioNS
Site 41SE309 is a multicomponent site including one piece
of prehistoric lithic debitage and a historic artifact and
debris scatter. Based on the extremely sparse quantity of
artifacts diffusely scattered over a broad area, the extent
of prior disturbances, and no potential for intact, buried
cultural deposits, the prehistoric component of the site is not

45

considered eligible for inclusion to the NRHP. Based upon
the presence of prevalent subsistence artifacts (tin cans,
beverage bottles) as well as some structural remains (bricks)
and features (possible cistern), the historic component of
the site may be the remnants of a homestead or a farm.
However, no evidence of structure foundations are present,
but these may have been razed and removed. The majority of
the historic component is heavily fragmented and apparently
destroyed. Furthermore, the artifact assemblage correlates
with the time that either the Kittrell or Copeland families
owned the property. None of these individuals are recorded
as historically prominent individuals at a local, regional, or
national level. Thus, the site offers limited research potential
based on the extensive, severe disturbances and the sparse
quantity of cultural materials that are diffusely scattered
over a heavily trafficked area. SWCA recommends that site
41SE309 is not eligible for inclusion to the NRHP or eligible
for designation as an SAL. No further archaeological
work is recommended and no monitoring or conservation
measures are warranted.

Site 41Se310
Site 41SE310 is an Early Archaic to Late Prehistoric
campsite at the northwestern end of the park (Figure
5.12; Appendix C.8). The site is situated on the right bank
(southeast side) of Palo Pinto Creek on a level to gently
sloping terrace of the drainage, which is 30 m to the north.
Further, the site is positioned on the tread of the current
floodplain that is about 2 m above the drainage thalweg.
Several two-track roads crisscross through the site and an
east-to-west trending fence line is located south of the site
that marks the railroad right-of-way boundary. The terrace
has been previously affected by extensive vegetation
removal, while the eastern half of the site appears to have
been plowed in the recent past. However, sheet-wash
erosion appears to be the most detrimental impact due to the
clustering of artifacts in erosional washes. The vegetation
on the site is open with a few short cedars and sparse oak
trees along the tributary drainage with an understory of short
grasses. Based on the extent of the cultural materials, the site
dimensions are 115 m east to west and 75 m north to south.
A dense accumulation of tertiary flakes and chipped stone
tools, including one complete Early Archaic stemmed
dart point and one fragmented Scallorn arrow point, was
observed in an erosional wash; however, additional artifacts
were not observed in the immediately surrounding area
(Figure 5.13). The site is bordered by Palo Pinto Creek to the
north and a fence line and railroad grade to the south. Five
shovel tests (AE83, KL78, KL106, KS85, and SRS59) were
placed in a crescent pattern around the surface artifacts, and
all were negative for cultural materials (Appendix A). One
additional shovel test (AE84) was placed in the center of
the surface scatter and yielded three tertiary chert flakes

between 20 to 40 cmbs. Soils encountered in the shovel
tests consist of sandy clay loam overlying very compact
clay. No burned rock or features were identified. Although
the site appears mainly surficial, there is a potential for
intact, buried cultural deposits. The temporally diagnostic
artifacts indicate occupations from the Early Archaic to
Late Prehistoric, though primarily mixed on the surface,
creating a palimpsest.
Of note, five chert flakes, two biface fragments, the dart
point, and the Scallorn projectile point were collected for
TPWD curation (Appendix E).

The presence on the surface of two widely varying
temporally diagnostic artifacts spanning several thousand
years suggests a palimpsest. However, the clustering of
artifacts around an ephemeral wash suggests these artifacts
have been translocated. SWCA recommends further
investigation with backhoe trenching to explore the full
horizontal and vertical extent of the prehistoric component
within the deeper alluvial deposits and to determine whether

intact cultural materials are present. With this in mind,
the site’s NRHP eligibility and SAL designation status
remains undetermined pending further work. Further
investigations with backhoe trenching are recommended to
determine the presence of buried deposits and to evaluate
the site for NRHP inclusion or SAL designation. Avoidance
is recommended until the site can be fully evaluated.
Finally, as a precautionary measure, routine monitoring is
recommended to protect against lateral erosion, vandalism,
and looting.

Site 41PP390
Site 41PP390 is a Late Prehistoric campsite located at the
northeast corner of the park on a level terrace, east of an
unnamed tributary to Palo Pinto Creek and southeast of
the confluence of two tributary drainages (Figure 5.14;
Appendix C.2). The site area has been mostly cleared of
vegetation leaving short grasses dotted with cedar atop
the terrace and somewhat dense cedar, hardwoods, and
vines bordering the drainage. One two-track road, trending
roughly east to west, traverses the southern portion of the
site. The site is bound by the main tributary channel to the

west, a smaller tributary to the north, the park boundary to
the east, and the extent of cultural materials to the south.
A moderately dense accumulation of tertiary flakes, one
Clifton-like arrow point, and two biface fragments were
observed within the road cut, approximately 30 m east of
the drainage channel. In addition, a few small fragments
of mussel shell and a few possible burned rock fragments
were also observed in the road cut. A very sparse surface
scatter of chert flakes was also encountered north of the
road along the level terrace.
A total of 19 shovel tests (AE128, AE130, AY72, AY93–
95, KL134–136, KS96, KS117–119, SRS83–85, and
WV93–95) were excavated within the site, of which five
were positive for cultural materials (Appendix A). Chert
flakes, shatter, and one untyped dart point were recovered
between 0 to 30 cmbs (Figure 5.15). One shovel test
(SRS85) encountered several shallowly buried (10–20
cmbs), thermally altered rock fragments, but no definitively
cultural features were encountered. The site is bounded
by the main tributary channel to the west and a low-lying
wash area to the north. As mentioned before, the terrace

site area has been previously subjected to some erosion,
vegetation removal, and extensive mechanical excavation,
particularly downslope from the foundation. The vegetation
on the site is a mixture of hardwoods and some cedar and
an understory of short grasses. The site is delineated solely
by the foundation (about 30 square feet) as no cultural
materials were observed in the area.

has been cleared of vegetation in the past and is disturbed
to some degree. All subsurface artifacts were recovered
from depths corresponding to a common plow zone range,
and the majority of surficial artifacts were observed within
a road cut. The thermally altered rock fragments that
were observed could not be definitively associated with
prehistoric cultural activities due to the likely possibility
that the landform may have been impacted by controlled
burning episodes in the recent past. The extent of cultural
materials has not been determined beyond the property
boundary to the east.
Of note, the Clifton projectile point as well as all subsurface
lithic artifacts (i.e. 16 flakes and 1 dart point) were collected
for TPWD curation (Appendix E).

41PP390 SummAry AND recommeNDAtioNS
Based on the cultural materials being situated at or near the
ground surface within a disturbed zone, the site appears to
have limited integrity. SWCA recommends that the site is
not eligible for inclusion to the NRHP or for designation
as an SAL; accordingly, no further archaeological work is
recommended and no monitoring or conservation measures
are warranted. The eastern extent of the site beyond the park
boundary, however, needs to be determined in the future,
should access permit.

Site 41PP391
Site 41PP391 is a historic foundation located at the
northeast end of the park, on a steep slope (40–45 degrees)
about 45 feet south of FM 2372, 150 to 175 feet south of
the railroad, and 6 feet south of a road cut (Figure 5.16;
Appendix C.2). The site consists of a foundation platform

The foundation has three poured concrete support walls
extending north to south that parallel the orientation of
the slope and are roughly 9 to 10 feet apart (Figure 5.17).
Each support of the three walls measures 18 feet in length
with a width of 8 inches at the top, which thickens to 1
foot near the base. The walls protrude from the slope wall
gaining a maximum height of roughly 5 feet above the
ground surface. Each support wall contains two concave, or
U-shaped segments, likely used to support cylindrical tanks
or basins. In addition, 15 brick pillars are located around the
concrete supports. The pillars are generally rectangular in
shape composed of unmarked brick with common mortar
with a concrete base. Each pillar is about 1 foot wide and
20 inches long, and is composed of three to six courses high
of mortared brick. A 6- to 8-inch segment of rebar was also
observed protruding from all pillars except the four corner
supports. The pillars surround the concrete support walls
with the north and south row of pillars located roughly 4
feet from the ends of the support walls. The east and west
row of pillars are set 8 feet from the edges of the supports.
The east row of pillars contains natural slabs of sandstone
to form a low wall. This abundance of natural stone was not
observed along the north, south, or west rows. Due to the
prevalence of exposed bedrock and steep slope upon which
the foundation was erected, no shovel test excavations
were conducted at the site. No inscriptions or temporally
diagnostic artifacts are present to verify age of construction.
Based on construction techniques and the presence of
several large (13- to 17-inch diameter) cedar trees growing
between the support walls, this feature is interpreted to be
historic, possibly sometime in the early to mid-twentieth
century. Notably, similar features are present at 41SE320
located at the western end of PPMSP (discussed below) and
this site may be associated with the features on that site.

41PP391 SummAry AND recommeNDAtioNS
The historic feature consists of three poured concrete
support walls surrounded by 15 rectangular brick pillars.
Each support wall contains two U-shaped depressions likely
used to hold or support a large tank. The surrounding brick
pillars likely served to support a roof to shelter the tanks.
This feature may have served as water or fuel storage for
the nearby railroad or for the adjacent roadbed. SWCA

to determine site function, chronology, and any association
with site 41SE320. With this in mind, the NRHP-eligibility
status of the site is currently undetermined until additional
work is able to fully assess the significance of the site.
Based on the surficial nature of the site with structural
features along a public roadway (FM2372), it is considered
a likely target of vandalism or relic collecting; therefore,
SWCA recommends that the site is eligible for designation
as an SAL. Further investigations may reveal that the site
also meets other criteria for SAL designation. Finally, as a
precautionary measure, routine monitoring is recommended
to protect against erosion, vandalism, and looting.

Site 41PP392 is a large early to mid-twentieth-century
scatter of structural features and debris located in the
northeastern portion of the park (Figure 5.18; Appendix
C.2). The site is situated on top of a prominent north to south
trending ridgeline. The site consists of five historic features
(Features 1–5) scattered in the vicinity of a natural spring

surrounded by surficial debris. The area has been previously
subjected to some erosion, vegetation removal, vehicular
traffic, and mechanical grading for road construction. The
vegetation on the site is a mixture of cedar and rare oak trees
with an understory of short grasses and cacti. The site is
delineated by the extent of surficial cultural materials that
extend 730 m north to south and about 175 m east to west.
The five historic features (Feature 1–5) are located at the
northern side of the site, on the eastern side of the ridge.
Feature 1, at the northern end of the site, is a dry-laid
limestone rock wall just east of a fork in an existing twotrack road (Figure 5.19). The rock wall is constructed from
flat, tabular limestone fragments of varying sizes (ranging
20–24 inches by 4–6 inches) and varies in height (2–3 feet)
between four and six courses. The limestone wall is roughly
rectangular in shape and measures 55 feet northwest to
southeast and 35 feet northeast to southwest and has one
20-foot-wide opening on the west-facing wall.
Feature 2 is a circular concrete foundation located about
32 feet west of Feature 1. The foundation is 51 inches in
diameter, composed of concrete with a matrix of angular
limestone fragments, and has a metal rod protruding from
the south side. No inscriptions are present on this feature.
Feature 3 is an 11-square-foot concrete foundation that
contains a raised, rectangular section that spans the center
of the foundation. The raised portion is 11 feet long, 6
inches high, and 6 inches wide. Various diameter rebar
extend vertically from the foundation about 3 to 4 inches
out of the concrete.
Feature 4 is about 50 feet south of Feature 1 and consists
of a large metal tank. The circular tank is collapsed and
partially crushed, measuring about 10 feet in length and 6
feet in width, with a 2-foot-diameter circular opening on the
top. The tank is constructed from a series of prefabricated

Figure 5.19.

Feature 1 at 41PP392.

51

metal sections that were bolted together and may have been
constructed on site.
Feature 5 consists of eleven wooden posts systematically
arranged across the site, primarily located east of the twotrack road and clustered around Features 1 to 4. The posts
are anchored into the ground with concrete and limestone
bedrock fragments, range in height from 3 to 5 feet, and
have a U-shaped notch on the top. The notches measure
1 to 2 inches deep and each appears to have been burned/
cauterized (Figure 5.20). Notably, two similar posts were
observed roughly 575 feet to the northwest of the feature.
The artifact assemblage of the site is solely surficial, highly
fragmented, and diffusely scattered near Features 1 to 5. The
artifacts include brick and brick fragments; miscellaneous
metal fragments; metal braided cable; glass fragments (clear
and amethyst colored); and a 1928 license plate, observed
within the southern portion of the site near an existing
two-track road. A bottle base containing a maker’s mark:
“Design Patented/Pat Aug 9, 1898” corresponds to the
Olympia Flask produced by the Illinois Glass Company
in 1903 (Lindsey 2013). More modern artifacts were also
observed including a clear glass bottle base bearing the Kerr
makers mark. The Kerr Group Inc., originally established in
1903, continues to produce canning jars to the present (Tice
2007). Eighty-three shovel tests were excavated within
and around the site, all of which were negative for cultural
materials (Appendix A). All shovel tests encountered
extremely shallow soils overlying limestone bedrock. Based
on manufacturing techniques and temporally diagnostic
artifacts (e.g., the license plate and amethyst-colored glass)
the site likely dates to the early to mid-twentieth century.
Notably, a diagnostic assortment of artifacts (i.e., clear
glass bottle base, amethyst glass shard, amethyst bottle
base, and crockery shard) was collected for TPWD curation
(Appendix E).

The natural spring located near the center of the site (just
south of the five features) was likely used, based upon the
presence of a large water tank (Feature 4) and numerous
grooved posts that possibly elevated some sort of piping
to transport water. The exact function of the rock wall
is unknown, but could have likely been used as a small
livestock enclosure.
The majority of artifacts are fragmented, the features are
dilapidated, and virtually no potential for intact subsurface
deposits exists. However, SWCA recommends further
archival research and/or oral interviews to determine site
function. With this in mind, the NRHP-eligibility status
of the site is currently undetermined until additional work
is able to fully assess the significance of the site. Based
on the surficial nature of the site with large structural
features within a public park, it is considered a likely
target of vandalism or relic collecting; therefore, SWCA

recommends that the site is eligible for designation as an
SAL. Further investigations may reveal that the site also
meets other criteria for SAL designation. Finally, as a
precautionary measure, routine monitoring is recommended
to protect against erosion, vandalism, and looting.

Site 41PP393
Site 41PP393 is a heavily disturbed, surficial multicomponent
site with prehistoric and historic artifacts located at the
northeast end of the park (Figure 5.21; Appendix C.2).
The site is situated on a level to gently sloping nose slope
of a prominent ridge overlooking Palo Pinto Creek to
the north. The site contains a sparse quantity of scattered
chert artifacts and an accumulation of historic (mid- to late
twentieth century) debris was observed. The site area has
been extensively disturbed by heavy equipment excavation,
vehicular traffic, vegetation removal, and erosion. The
vegetation clearing has left only patches of short grasses
allowing for high surface visibility. The site is delineated

by the extent of cultural materials, which extends 68 m east
to west, and 35 m north to south.
A total of four shovel tests (AE205, JB18, SRS150, and
WV32) were excavated within the site that encountered
silty clay loams with CaCO3 around 30 cmbs (Appendix
A). Shovel testing did not reveal buried historic or prehis­
toric artifacts; however, shovel test JB18, located adjacent
to a burn pile containing modern barbed wire and metal
debris, encountered modern industrial debris. The site has
been extensively disturbed by land clearing and activities
associated with the petroleum industry.
The prehistoric component of the site consists of a sparse
quantity of scattered chert flakes and one chert biface
fragment. The fine-grained chert debitage (n=30) is very
fragmented and is made from tan- and black-colored raw
material that is primarily shatter with some late-stage
reduction flakes. The chert biface fragment is a crude distal
fragment made from black-colored raw material.
The historic component is extremely fragmented and
diffusely scattered across the site. The assemblage contains
amorphous metal fragments, whiteware fragments (n=4),
glass (clear and amethyst colored) fragments (n=10), and
shell button fragments. These artifacts are predominantly
located along the two-track road that bisects the site, which
has crushed and broken the assemblage. The diagnostic
artifacts (e.g., amethyst glass and button) suggest historic
activities at the site occurred in the early twentieth century.
No temporally diagnostic prehistoric artifacts or features
were encountered and no burned rock was noted. The
prehistoric assemblage is limited and appears to indicate
solely chipped stone reduction activities. All the historic
artifacts are likely associated with a temporary habitation
since no structural debris is present. Based on the extensive
network of nearby oil tanks and pump jacks, the historic
activities are most likely associated with petroleum
exploration.

41PP393 SummAry AND recommeNDAtioNS
Site 41PP393 is a purely surficial scatter of prehistoric lithic
debitage, one chipped stone tool, and fragmented historic
artifacts. The site offers limited research potential based on
the extensive, severe disturbances and the sparse quantity of
cultural materials that are diffusely scattered over a heavily
trafficked area. SWCA recommends that site 41PP393 is not
eligible for inclusion to the NRHP or eligible for designation
as an SAL. No further archaeological work is recommended
and no monitoring or conservation measures are warranted.

Site 41Se311
Site 41SE311 is a historic dam dating to the early twentieth
century located near the middle of the park (Figure
5.22; Appendix C.7). The dam spans Palo Pinto Creek
approximately 1.15 miles southwest of the terminus of FM
2372. The dam is just upstream from the creek’s confluence
with two unnamed tributary drainages. A somewhat
maintained two-track road is located 45 m southwest of the
dam, and the railroad is located 230 m northeast.
The site consists of a single, linear concrete water retention
feature that measures 220 feet long, 28 inches thick, and
roughly 3 feet high (Figure 5.23). It spans Palo Pinto
Creek trending roughly northeast to southwest. A partial
inscription is visible on the top of the dam that reads:
“Bartlett & …(?)… Builders…(?)…1919.” Near the center
of the dam, the year 1919 is inscribed again. The dam rests
upon a slightly undulating limestone bedrock formation
that underlies the creek and adjacent terraces. The feature
extends from the top of the lower terrace on the right bank
(west side) to the top of the lower terrace on the left bank
(east side). The dam creates a moderately sized reservoir
of water that extends about 300 feet upstream and appears
to be at least 4 feet in depth in places.
According to archival research, construction of the dam
likely started in 1917 (Freeman 2014). The dam, as
well as a pump house (site 41SE316) located about 300
yards upstream, was possibly associated with oil and gas
development in the area or the railroad during the 1917 to
1918 drought.

41Se311 SummAry AND recommeNDAtioNS
No historic artifacts are associated with this feature, but
archival research indicates a construction date of 1917 in
response to the 1917 to 1918 drought. However, inscriptions
on the dam indicate a date of 1919. This latter date may
reflect repair activities subsequent to construction. With the
exception of several small cracks in the feature that don’t
apparently affect its function, the dam appears to be in
very good condition. SWCA recommends further archival
research to identify exactly who constructed the feature
and possible association with the pump house (41SE316).
With this in mind, the NRHP-eligibility status of the site is
currently undetermined until additional work is able to fully
assess the significance of the site. Based on the presence of
this large historic structural feature within a public park, it
is considered a likely target of vandalism or relic collecting;
therefore, SWCA recommends that the site is eligible for
designation as an SAL. Further investigations may reveal
that the site also meets other criteria for SAL designation.
Finally, as a precautionary measure, routine monitoring is
recommended to protect against erosion, vandalism, and
looting.

Site 41SE312 is a buried Late Prehistoric campsite located
on a terrace of Palo Pinto Creek at the western end of the
park (Figure 5.24; Appendix C.7). The site is situated on
the right bank (south side) of Palo Pinto Creek on a level
to gently undulating terrace of the drainage, which is 10 m
north. Further, the site is positioned on the tread of the upper
terrace that is about 3 to 4 m above the drainage thalweg.
The terrace appears reasonably undisturbed with only some
evident vegetation removal and some lateral erosion from
the drainage. The vegetation on the site is primarily mixed
hardwood overstory with an understory of short grasses
and scattered cacti. The site is positioned on the interior of
a meander bend, effectively bounded by Palo Pinto Creek
on the north, west, and east sides, while the extent of the
cultural materials define the south. The site measures 240
m northeast to southwest and 130 m northwest to southeast.
The site consists of a sparse quantity of prehistoric lithic
debitage and one brushed ceramic sherd (Figure 5.25).
Dense vegetation prohibited a full inspection of the
ground surface. Nine shovel tests (AE194–195, AY130–

132, JB07–09, and SRS140) were excavated during the
delineation of site 41SE312, two of which (SRS140 and
AY131) encountered cultural materials. Shovel test SRS140
encountered chert debitage (0–5 cmbs) and shovel test
AY131 encountered a brushed ceramic sherd and chert
debitage 0 to 40 cmbs (Appendix A). The shovel tests
observed a firm, very compact silt loam/silt clay loam
around 50 cmbs that extends to over 110 cmbs. Further,
the meander-bend landform provides a cut bank profile
for most of the site area. The cut bank exhibits brown silt
loam/silt clay loam that extends to roughly 4 m in height.
The ceramic sherd suggests a Late Prehistoric occupation
campsite and the differing recovery levels imply that the
site may be culturally stratified.

41Se312 SummAry AND recommeNDAtioNS
All cultural materials on 41SE312 were encountered from
a depth of 0 to 40 cmbs, and all shovel tests excavated
within the site boundary encountered deep alluvium that
in some shovel tests (e.g., KL207) extended beyond 110
cmbs. This is supported by the deep (3–4 m) cut bank
profiles along the western and eastern site boundaries.

Chapter 5

Although a sparse quantity of artifacts was observed, the
site very likely contains intact cultural deposits at different
depths suggesting stratification. SWCA recommends further
investigation with backhoe trenching to explore the full
horizontal and vertical extent of the prehistoric component
within the deeper alluvial deposits and to determine whether
intact cultural materials are present. With this in mind,
the site’s NRHP eligibility and SAL designation status
remains undetermined pending further work. Further
investigations with backhoe trenching are recommended to
determine the presence of buried deposits and to evaluate
the site for NRHP inclusion or SAL designation. Avoidance
is recommended until the site can be fully evaluated.
Finally, as a precautionary measure, routine monitoring is
recommended to protect against lateral erosion, vandalism,
and looting.

Site 41Se313
Site 41SE313 is a single-hearth feature eroding out of a
road-cut profile located near the confluence of Palo Pinto
Creek and two unnamed tributaries in the western area of
the park (Figure 5.26; Appendix C.7). The hearth feature

Site map 41SE313.

is located on the west side of a two-track road that trends
roughly northwest to southeast. The site is situated on the
edge of an alluvial fan along a tributary drainage of Palo
Pinto Creek, located about 60 m northeast of the site.
The area is level to slightly undulatory from erosion and
has prevalent broad exposures of limestone bedrock. The
vegetation for the area is primarily open with short grasses
and scattered hardwoods along the nearby drainages.
The area has been disturbed by heavy vehicular traffic
and erosion. The site is solely composed of the cluster of
thermally altered rock in an area roughly 15 m in diameter.
The burned rock phenomenon is about 10 cmbs in the road
cut that has a 50-cm-thick profile exposure (Figure 5.27).
Approximately five pieces of burned rock (ranging from
4–10 cm) were observed in the profile within a slightly
ashy matrix. An additional 15 burned rock fragments were
observed in the road extending upslope to the southeast. One
shovel test (AE201) was placed adjacent to the feature and
revealed two burned rock fragments at 10 to 20 cmbs and
nine burned rock fragments at 20 to 30 cmbs (Appendix
A). Additional burned rock was noted in an existing
two-track road extending upslope to the southeast. Two

shovel tests (AE201 and JB13) were excavated in the site
area and one (AE201) was positive for cultural material,
containing burned rock from 10 to 30 cmbs (Appendix A).
No thermally altered soil or staining was observed in the
road cut or positive shovel test, and no lithic debitage or
chipped stone tools were observed on the site. The majority
of shovel tests revealed silty loam to an average depth of 40
cmbs before exposing compact, mottled clay loam. Further,
the area adjacent to 41SE313 was investigated with three
backhoe trenches (BHT01–03) that encountered silt loam/
silt clay loams overlying degrading limestone bedrock
around 110 cmbs and no cultural materials.

41Se313 SummAry AND recommeNDAtioNS
No definitively prehistoric materials were observed at the
site. The hearth is presumed to be prehistoric, but it could
also be historic or represent a relatively recent thermal
activity. Considering no other activities (e.g., flint knapping
or butchering) can be identified, SWCA recommends that
site 41SE313 is not eligible for inclusion to the NRHP
or for designation as an SAL. No avoidance strategy or
reroute for the proposed road is recommended. No further
archaeological work is recommended and no monitoring or
conservation measures are warranted for this site.

Site 41Se314
Site 41SE314 is a surficial, shallowly buried multicomponent
site with prehistoric and historic (twentieth century)
artifacts located at the western area of the park (Figure
5.28; Appendix C.7). The site is south of an existing twotrack road that extends east from a junction of two roads,
situated on an alluvial fan-floodplain that gradually slopes
toward Palo Pinto Creek, located about 160 m northeast
of the site. The area is level to slightly undulatory from
erosion with generally open vegetation with scattered
mesquite and short grasses and scattered hardwoods along
the nearby drainages. The area has been disturbed by heavy

A total of 17 shovel tests (AE202–204, AW31, AY41,
AY137–139, JB15–17, KLL44–45, WV171–172, and
WV175–176) and four backhoe trenches (BHT05–06 and
BHT08–09) were excavated during the delineation of the
site area (Appendix A). Six shovel tests (AE203, JB16–17,
WV171, and WV175–176) were positive for cultural
material, all of which are located near the northwest extent
of the site. Thirteen pieces of burned rock, three pieces of
shatter, one modified chert flake, and twelve chert flakes
were recovered from 0 to 50 cmbs, although the majority
of artifacts were encountered around 10 to 30 cmbs
(Figure 5.29). Additionally, four negative backhoe trenches
(BHT05–06 and BHT08–09) revealed brown silt loam
overlying yellowish-brown to brownish yellow sandy loam
with CaCO3 filaments and nodules to a maximum depth of
115 cmbs (Appendix B). All subsurface lithic artifacts were
collected, however the 13 burned rock fragments observed
during the shovel testing were not collected for TPWD
curation (Appendix E).
The prehistoric component of the site consists of a
moderately dense accumulation of chert flakes (n=90+),
four modified flakes, one late-stage biface fragment, and
scattered thermally altered rock fragments noted on the
surface extending eastward along the two-track road. The
chert raw material is fine-grained tan chert and the debitage
is primarily late-stage reduction (about 70 percent) followed
by shatter (30 percent). The chipped stone tool is crude and
the modified flakes are expediently utilized. No temporally
diagnostic artifacts were observed.
The historic component is solely surficial and consists
of bricks, various metal debris, and a whiteware ceramic
fragment. The bricks and brick fragments (n=30) are a
combination of locally made, red bricks with some WALSH
and FERRIS stamped bricks. Of note, Ferris, Texas, is about
15 miles northeast of Waxahachie in northeastern Ellis
County. Along with other brick-manufacturing firms, the
Ferris Brick Company used the mineral clays found in the
soils of the area before World War I (Hart 2013). By 1914,
the community had six brick plants and still had four brick
manufacturers in the 1950s (Hart 2013). Further, one broken
cinder block, one concrete chunk, and one crushed metal
tub were also observed on the ground surface in the eastern
portion of the site. The southern portion of the site contains
one whiteware fragment, one 50 gallon metal drum, several
braided cables, and miscellaneous metal fragments. Finally,
a small (10-m radius) depression is present, observed next to
a motte of larger diameter (approximately 2 feet) oak trees.
The depression is certainly artificial, but has an unknown
function since it appears too shallow (approximately 30

cm) to be a pond. Unfortunately, no foundations were
observed and the temporally diagnostic artifacts for the
historic component broadly indicate activities during the
twentieth century.

Figure 5.29.

Artifact assemblage 41SE314.

No temporally diagnostic prehistoric artifacts or definitive
cultural features were encountered. The thermally altered
rocks observed are at or near the surface, widely scattered,
and may be more recent in origin (e.g., recent burning
activity). The prehistoric assemblage is limited and suggests
solely chipped stone reduction activities. All historic
artifacts are primarily industrial in function (e.g., braided
cable and metal drums) with a paucity of habitationsubsistence information. Although structural materials
(bricks and cinder block) are present, no evidence of a
foundation is present. An extensive network of nearby oil
tanks and pump jacks are in the vicinity (about 250 m to
the southeast) and the historic activities may be associated
with petroleum exploration. According to archival research
(Freeman 2014), the site is located at a prominent turn to
the southwest along the historic road between Strawn and

Results of Investigations
Ranger, Texas. Unfortunately, a park boundary is located
less than 50 m from the site along this possible route and
could not be explored. Regardless, it is possible that the
historic activities at the site may have been associated with
travel along this roadway.

41Se314 SummAry AND recommeNDAtioNS
Site 41SE314 consists of a surface and subsurface scatter of
prehistoric lithic debitage, burned rock, and chipped stone
tools as well as a surface scatter of historic-age artifacts.
Backhoe trenching was conducted in order to explore the
full horizontal and vertical extent of the site; however, no
intact, buried cultural deposits were encountered. Based
on these results, as well as the extent of prior disturbances
and lack of temporally diagnostic tools or features, the
prehistoric component of site 41SE314 is not significant.
Similarly, the historic component consists of a broad scatter
of ambiguous twentieth-century industrial and structural
debris. The archival review has identified a historic road
passing through the area, but no specific record of a site
is indicated for this location. The site is not recommended
as eligible for inclusion to the NRHP or for designation as
an SAL. Consequently, no further archaeological work is

are warranted for this site.

Site 41Se315
Site 41SE315 is a possibly historic corral consisting of
one wooden-and-brick corral feature, presumably of the
twentieth century, located just south of the railroad and north
of an existing two-track road (Figure 5.30; Appendix C.7).
The corral, oriented generally north to south, measures 70
feet north to south and 30 feet east to west and is divided
into two sections by a central interior fence. Four entrances
were recorded: west side of south fence, west side of central
fence, west side of north fence, and the north side of the
east fence. The entrance on the east fence contains a ramp
formed from concrete and represents a livestock chute. The
corral is composed of square, machine-cut lumber beams
(measuring generally 7 inches in diameter), bricks, and
metal fencing. The lumber is laid horizontally, five courses
high with two stacked bricks separating each course. In
addition, old power line poles have been used as posts
in some corners. Old drill marks and indentations were
observed in the lumber indicating that the majority of the
lumber has been moved to this location and recycled. The

60

Chapter 5

bricks contain no maker’s marks. The corral is composed of
a mixture of repurposed materials (bricks, lumber, and a mix
of older and more modern metal fencing). Modern fencing
has been built up to and around the corral. No artifacts were
observed in association with the corral.
Freeman’s (2014:123–126) archival research encompassed
site 41SE314, which is indicated to be in the Stephens
County portion of the D.V. Ackerman survey. This survey
was patented to the heirs of David Ver Plank Ackerman in
1880. His widow Caroline Ackerman died in 1888, and his
children John M. Ackerman and Hattie E. Ackerman Gudger
were the sole surviving heirs at law. In 1915 the land was
leased to J.B. Lantz of Pennsylvania for the purposes of
mining and oil and gas exploration. In 1939, the Stephens
County portion of the survey was divided into three tracts
that ran north-south and was sold to three Ackerman heirs.
Site 41SE315 is located near the western edge of the survey,
which likely places it within the westernmost 96.08-acre
tract that was sold to Georgia Barry Kilpatrick (Mrs. Lee)
of Baytown. After 1939, unfortunately the deed records
are incomplete. At some point, likely before 1963, the tract
was purchased by the Copeland family. During a 2010

settlement, it was acquired by the firm Shannon, Gracey,
Ratliff & Miller, who in turn sold the land to TPWD in
2011. Although the site is temporally ambiguous, the
site is likely twentieth century in age. If correct, the site
corresponds with the Kilpatrick or Copeland families. None
of these individuals are recorded as historically prominent
individuals at a local, regional, or national level.

Based on the temporally ambiguous nature of the feature and
limited research value, site 41SE315 is not recommended
as eligible for inclusion to the NRHP or for designation as
an SAL. No further archaeological work is recommended
and no monitoring or protective measures are warranted
for this site.

Site 41Se316
Site 41SE316 is an early to mid-twentieth-century concrete
building located on the left (north side) bank of Palo Pinto
Creek in the western portion of the park (Figure 5.31;
Appendix C.7). The site is situated on a level to gently

Results of Investigations
sloping terrace of Palo Pinto Creek. The site solely contains
the concrete structure with no evident historic debris within
or around it. The site area appears reasonably undisturbed
with the exception of some timber cutting and possible
erosion. The vegetation is moderately dense with a mixed
hardwood (oaks and elm) overstory, assorted bushes, and
short grasses. The site is delineated by the structure that
covers about a 20-square-foot area.
The building is rectangular in shape, and measures 25 feet
northeast to southwest and 12 feet northwest to southeast.
The building is composed of board-formed concrete with
the main entrance located on the northeast façade, one
window on the southwest façade, and two windows on
each the northwest and southeast façades. The windows
and doorway are lined with wood, and the entryway is
elevated above the current ground surface (Figure 5.32).
The building is mostly intact with all the walls present,
but no stairs or roof. The interior floor of the building
is dirt and is excavated down slightly below the natural
ground surface. One roughly 1-inch-diameter pipe extends
horizontally out the east side of the building and appears

Figure 5.32.

Structure entry at 41SE316.

61

to be about 3 feet below the ground surface. The pipe goes
underneath the ground surface for an indeterminate distance
toward the drainage, which presumably transported water.
No temporally diagnostic artifacts are evident, but the
structure is overgrown by various trees of assorted diameter.
The exterior has numerous trees aligning the sides of the
structure, ranging from 3 to 4 inches in diameter with one
large (3-foot diameter) oak near the northeast corner. The
interior has numerous saplings ranging from 1 to 2 inches
in diameter.
According to archival research, the concrete building was
constructed in 1917 and served as a pump house (Freeman
2014). This information correlates with the arrangement of
the structure and proximity of the waterway. The building,
as well as a dam (site 41SE311) downstream, was possibly
associated with oil and gas development in the area or the
railroad during the 1917 to 1918 drought. Oddly, no pipes
or associated infrastructure was observed near the pump
house to suggest where the water was sent. The rail road,
at its closest point, is located 570 feet to the northeast
and may have serviced historic train traffic. Similarly,

62

Chapter 5

there is a multi-component site (41SE314) containing
scattered historic debris (e.g., bricks and metal) generally
contemporaneous with the pump house. This site (41SE314)
is located 550 feet to the southwest and may have used the
pump house to transport water.

Finally, as a precautionary measure, routine monitoring is
recommended to protect against erosion, vandalism, and
looting.

Site 41PP394 is a surficial and buried prehistoric lithic
scatter in the central portion of the park located 0.34 mile
southwest of FM 2372 and 0.24 mile northwest of Tucker
Lake (Figure 5.33; Appendix C.6). The site is situated
atop a prominent upland ridge overlooking the Palo Pinto
Creek valley to the northeast. The site is positioned in the
south-central portion of the landform with a dirt two-track
road providing access to Tucker Lake, located 130 m east,
and another dirt two-track road 75 m south. Vegetation
consists of patchy grasses and prickly pear cacti with some
cedar and mesquite scrub allowing for moderate ground
surface visibility. The upland ridge underlying the site has
frequently exposed sandstone bedrock outcrops interspersed
with sandy deposits. The area has been disturbed by some
vegetation clearing and erosion. The site is delineated by
the extent of cultural materials that extend over a roughly
40-m-diameter area.

No associated artifacts were encountered, but archival
research indicates a construction date of 1917 during the
1917 to 1918 drought. SWCA recommends further archival
research to identify exactly who constructed the feature
and to establish possible association with the historic
dam (41SE311) located downstream. With this in mind,
the NRHP-eligibility status of site 41SE316 is currently
undetermined until additional work is able to fully assess
the significance of the site. Based on the presence of this
large historic structural feature within a public park, it is
considered a likely target of vandalism or relic collecting;
therefore, SWCA recommends that the site is eligible for
designation as an SAL. Further investigations may reveal
that the site also meets other criteria for SAL designation.

Site 41PP394

Results of Investigations
The site was initially identified by a complete projectile
point observed atop sandstone bedrock (Figure 5.34).
Intensive surface inspection revealed a sparse surface scatter
chert debitage (n=6), one middle-stage biface fragment,
and one core. A total of 10 shovel tests (AY180–182
KL249–254, and KL264) were excavated during the
delineation of the site, of which two (AY181 and KL254)
were positive for cultural materials. Shovel test AY181,
located in the southeastern portion of the site, revealed
three flakes at 50 to 60 cmbs. Shovel test KL254, located
10 m northeast of shovel test AY181, revealed one flake at
20 cmbs. In general, shovel testing revealed shallow sandy
loam overlying sandstone bedrock at 30 cmbs (Appendix
A). In addition, the landform is likely subjected to frequent
erosional processes as indicated by large sandstone bedrock
exposures and deeper pockets of mixed deposits.
The artifact assemblage at the site consists of six tertiary
chert flakes, two secondary chert flakes, one middle-stage
biface fragment, one core, and one projectile point. The
debitage is composed of light pink, tan, and dark grayishbrown chert, and the biface fragment and core appear to
be composed of a similar tan chert. The projectile point
is lanceolate-shaped and has been slightly reworked with
ground lateral margins on the base, and parallel oblique
flaking. The projectile point is similar in morphology to a
Golondrina or Dalton, a Paleoindian projectile point (Turner
et al. 2011). No thermally altered rock or definitive cultural
features were observed at the site and appears to solely
represent lithic reduction activities.
The Paleoindian projectile point as well as the subsurface
lithic debitage was collected for curation at TPWD
(Appendix E).
The predominance of encountered sandstone bedrock on
and near the site was around 30 cmbs, but occasional deeper

63

pockets of sand/sand loam were encountered. Basically,
the underlying bedrock across the ridge is undulating and
covered by a mantle of sand/sand loam that appears to be
a mix of residuum from the bedrock and eolian deposits.

41PP394 SummAry AND recommeNDAtioNS
The site is composed of a sparse scatter of lithic debitage
with several chipped stone tools including one Paleoindian
dart point. The site is situated on shallow bedrock,
predominantly surficial, and has likely mixed subsurface
deposits. Based on the sparse quantity of artifacts and
limited potential for intact, buried cultural deposits, SWCA
recommends that site 41PP394 is not eligible for inclusion
to the NRHP or for designation as an SAL. Therefore,
no further archaeological work is recommended and no
monitoring or conservation measures are warranted for
this site.

Site 41PP395
Site 41PP395 is a moderately disturbed, surficial and bur­
ied multicomponent site with scattered chert artifacts and
historic (early to mid-twentieth century) artifacts located in
the north-central portion of the park (Figure 5.35; Appendix
C.6). The site is situated on a level to gently sloping terrace
of a tributary to Palo Pinto Creek to the north. Interestingly,
the tributary drainage appears to be a relict channel of Palo
Pinto Creek, which has been at some point abandoned and
now drains the adjacent uplands to the south (see Figure
5.2). The site is on the right bank (west side) tread of the
tributary channel about 20 m east and about 3 m above
the broad channel base. The site area has been disturbed
by vegetation removal, some possible heavy machinery
excavation, vehicular traffic, and erosion. The vegetation
clearing at the site has left patches of short grasses allowing
for high surface visibility, but mixed hardwoods and shrubs
align the tributary. The site is delineated by the extent of
cultural materials, which extends 100 m east to west by 175
m north to south along the drainage.
A total of 15 shovel tests (AW97, AY218–219, AY221–222,
CK60, CK105, KL298–299, KL303, KLL132, LK116–117,
and MC82–83) were excavated during the delineation of
the site, of which two (AY218–219) were positive for
cultural material. Shovel test AY218, located above the
southeast edge of the wash, revealed one tertiary flake at
20 cmbs. Shovel test AY219, located 15 m east of shovel

shatter at 0 to 30 cmbs (Appendix A). In general, shovel
testing revealed silt loam with sandstone gravels overlying
very compact clay loam at 45 cmbs. The cut banks of the
unnamed tributary were also inspected revealing deep,
alluvial deposits.

Results of Investigations
The prehistoric component at site 41PP395 consists of 20
tertiary flakes, 12 secondary flakes, four pieces of chert
shatter, and one projectile point. The debitage is composed
of varying types of chert, including: fine-grained, white
chert, fine-grained, grayish-brown chert, fine-grained,
pink chert, tan chert with white inclusions, and light gray
fossiliferous chert (Figure 5.36). The projectile point is an
arrow point missing the distal tip and a portion of one of the
tangs. It has distinctive, serrated lateral margins that extend
to the tang. This artifact is morphologically similar to a
Washita projectile point, which dates to the Late Prehistoric.
No definitively cultural burned rock was observed and no
cultural features were encountered.

The historic component is comprised of highly fragmented
household items and limited structural debris. The
assemblage includes: five clear, flat window pane glass
shards; one clear bottle glass shard; two milk-colored glass
shards; 10 whiteware fragments; one stoneware fragment;
one slightly solarized bottle neck and finish; one honeycolored glass shard; approximately 10 amethyst-colored
glass shards; two deep-purple-colored carnival glass shards;
one possible carriage bolt; and one burned brick fragment
(Figure 5.37). Based on the presence of amethyst- and
honey-colored glass fragments, the historic assemblage
likely dates to the early to mid-twentieth century. In
addition, the two shards of deep purple carnival glass have
a Christmas Compote design originally manufactured
by the Dugan Glass Company during the early twentieth
century (Moore 1989). The presence of common household
items and small amount of structural debris suggest a more
permanent camp or repeated visits.
Notably, a diagnostic assortment of artifacts (i.e., solarized
glass bottle neck and finish and Washita arrow point) as well
as all subsurface lithic artifacts (i.e. debitage) was collected
for TPWD curation (AppendixE).

were encountered at 0 to 30 cmbs, and inspection of the
nearby cut banks revealed deep, alluvial deposits on a relict
channel of Palo Pinto Creek. Therefore, the site’s NRHP
eligibility and SAL designation status remains undetermined
pending further work. Further investigations with backhoe
trenching are recommended to determine the presence of
buried deposits and to evaluate the site for NRHP inclusion
or SAL designation. Avoidance is recommended until the
site can be fully evaluated. Finally, as a precautionary
measure, routine monitoring is recommended to protect
against erosion, vandalism, and possible looting due to the
site’s location near a public roadway (i.e., FM2372).

Site 41PP396
Site 41PP396 consists of several historic mid- to late
twentieth-century house sites located on the western edge
of Tucker Lake approximately 0.25 mile southwest of FM
2372 in the middle of the park (Figure 5.38; Appendix C.6).
The site is positioned at the base of a steep upland slope
immediately adjacent to the reservoir. A narrow path extends
from a rocky two-track road, located 100 m west of the site,
and traverses through the site area. Vegetation consists of
mature cedar and mesquite trees with sparse short grasses
and abundant leaf litter.
The site consists of 17 historic-age features which were
associated with a vacation cottage community located at
Tucker Lake in the 1930s and 1940s. The features include:
one house, three house foundations, one walking path, one

wooden walkway, two sets of concrete stairs, three retaining
walls, one cistern or septic tank, two animal pens or corrals,
one metal fence, one outhouse, and one refuse dump.
Feature 1, located in the eastern portion of the site, is a sidegabled frame dwelling likely constructed in the late 1940s
(Figure 5.39). The small house is situated on a slope just
above the lake, with its main elevation facing toward the
water. Multiple 6/6 wood-framed windows are situated in
the southeast elevation to take advantage of the view. Wood
divided-light windows are found on the other elevations
also. Several of the windows are sheltered by long, shedroofed awnings. The house is clad in asbestos siding and
has an asphalt shingle roof. On the northwest elevation is an
exterior stuccoed chimney. At the south corner of the house
is a large covered deck with wood supports, metal railings,
and a shallow-pitched gabled roof. The deck appears to be
a circa 1960s addition. Several of the house’s window sash
are missing and the awnings and siding are in disrepair.
Feature 2 is a refuse dump located approximately 25 m
northwest of Feature 1. The dump consists of more than
100 metal cans including tin cans, metal drums, paint cans,
gas cans, and sanitary cans. An abundance of beer cans
with opposing church key openings were observed, most
of which are Pearl Lager Beer and Jax Beer. Amber and
green-colored beer bottles were observed as well as clear
glass canning jars and one small cobalt-colored glass jar.
In addition, one refrigerator, multiple metal chairs, several

68

Chapter 5

white earthenware plate fragments, and several chunks of
coarse-grained concrete were observed. The refuse dump
spans an area measuring roughly 16 m north to south and
10 m east to west.
Feature 3, located 35 m west of Feature 2, is an outhouse
composed of a wooden frame clad in asphalt siding. A light
fixture and wiring was observed inside the structure. A
sparse scatter of sanitary cans was observed on the ground
surface between Feature 2 and Feature 3.
Feature 4 is a small corral located 13 m south of Feature 3.
It is approximately 2 m tall. The corral is composed of a mix
of hog and chicken wire strung around small cedar posts and
the naturally occurring cedar trees. Two un-barbed strands
of wire are hung around the top of the corral. A small metal
gate and three cinder blocks are located on the south edge of
the corral. One sanitary can was observed inside the corral.
A sparse accumulation of cinder block and red brick
fragments was observed at the western extent of the site near
these four resources. Also found was one coarse-grained
concrete block with the word “Tiger” inscribed in the
lower left-hand corner. A total of eight negative shovel tests
(AY223–225, AY263–265, and MC14–15) were excavated
in the site, revealing very shallow gravelly sand overlying
bedrock at 5 cmbs (Appendix A).
Feature 5 is a long retaining wall that curves around the
bank of the lake (Figure 5.40). The wall ranges from
approximately 2 to 4 feet in height and is made from drystacked limestone. Along a portion of the retaining wall,
cedar posts that may have once supported a fence extend
from the top.
Feature 6 is a mortared masonry retaining wall located
slightly uphill from the lake front. The wall is approximately
6 feet in height and is constructed from large stone blocks

(likely sandstone) laid in straight courses. The ends of the
wall are finished in a stair-step pattern.
Feature 7 is a house foundation located on the lake front.
The perimeter-wall foundation is several feet high and
appears to protrude from the hillside behind it. To either
side of the foundation is a short stone retaining wall along
the edge of the hill. The foundation appears to have two
distinct parts built at different times. The north end of the
foundation is constructed of mortared, coursed rubblelimestone blocks and is filled with earth. The southern
portion is made of poured concrete and has a concrete cap.
Feature 8 is a tall retaining wall located immediately north
of Feature 7. The majority of the wall is constructed of
mortared stone blocks (likely sandstone) laid in straight
rows. At the northern end of the wall is a short section of
dry-stacked limestone.
Feature 9 is a set of concrete stairs that leads to the
waterfront. Near the top of the staircase is a short retaining
wall, and a second retaining wall runs along the south edge
of the stairway. The stair treads terminate in a concrete ramp
that leads directly into the water.
Feature 10 is a circular underground cistern or septic tank
with a partially buried ring of limestone blocks at ground
level.
Feature 11 is a concrete perimeter wall foundation 2 or 3
feet in height. A narrow concrete walkway leads to three
concrete steps that lead up to the foundation. A short
distance away is a circular limestone planter containing a
small tree.
Feature 12 is a rectangular concrete slab foundation located
near a pile of limestone blocks and broken bricks.
Feature 13 is a set of concrete stairs located near the twotrack road at the northern end of the site. A low stone
foundation wall runs along the base of the hill near the stairs.
The stairs lead up the hill to Feature 14, an animal pen.
Feature 14 is a collapsed animal pen situated on a hillside in
the northwest corner of the site. Some cedar posts remain.
Near the posts are rusted corrugated metal panels and box
wire.
Feature 15 is a short corrugated metal fence situated
on a hillside below a rock outcropping. The fence is
approximately 2 feet in height.
Feature 16 is a walking path that winds through the site
and connects the various resources. The single-track path
is covered in gravel.

41PP396 SummAry AND recommeNDAtioNS
Site 41PP396 is composed of 17 historic-age features
consisting of a house, house foundations, animal pens,
retaining walls, and other resources associated with a cluster
of vacation cottages present in the 1930s and 1940s. The site
was evaluated for its eligibility for inclusion to the NRHP
and for designation as an SAL.
Due to alteration, demolition, and/or poor condition, the
features at the site lack integrity of design, materials,
workmanship, and feeling. Because of this, the site does
not meet Criteria C of 36 CFR 60.4.
SWCA recommends further archival research and/or
oral interviews to establish the site’s historic context and
potential eligibility to the NRHP under Criteria A and B.
The NRHP-eligibility status of site 41PP396 is currently
undetermined until additional work is able to fully assess

its significance. Based on the presence of large historic
structural features within a public park, it is considered
a likely target of vandalism or relic collecting; therefore,
SWCA recommends that the site is eligible for designation
as an SAL. Further investigations may reveal that the site
also meets other criteria for SAL designation. Finally, as a
precautionary measure, routine monitoring is recommended
to protect against erosion, vandalism, and looting.

Site 41PP397
Site 41PP397 is a historic-age oil drilling site located 135 m
southeast of FM 2372 and 85 m northwest of an unnamed
tributary to Palo Pinto Creek in the northeastern portion of
the park (Figure 5.41; Appendix C.2). The site is situated on
the left bank (north side) of a tributary of Palo Pinto Creek
extending over the upper and lower terraces. The site area
has been heavily disturbed by vegetation removal, extensive
heavy machinery excavation, construction activities for
petroleum drilling, and erosion. Vegetation throughout the
site area consists of medium-height grasses, prickly pear and
pencil cacti, and scattered mature oak and pecan trees. The

70

Chapter 5

site is delineated by the extent of cultural materials, which
extends 100 m northeast to southwest by 50 m northwest
to southeast along the tributary drainage.
A total of four negative shovel tests (AY247, AY253,
AY262, and KL343) were excavated during the delineation
of the site. Shovel testing revealed compact silt loam with
CaCO3 filaments at 40 cmbs (Appendix A). Two shovel
tests (AY247 and AY253) revealed shallow, disturbed soils
containing wood debris and charcoal fragments from recent
disturbance.
The site consists of five historic-age features (Features 1–5)
surrounded by a sparse surface scatter of historic-age midto late twentieth-century industrial and structural debris.
Feature 1, located in the northeast portion of the site, is
a rectangular concrete support measuring 7.5 feet (240
cm) long, 2.5 feet (70 cm) wide, and 15 inches (40 cm)
tall (Figure 5.42). The center of the support is raised and
spans the length of the feature forming two shelf-like edges.
One of the shelves contains a large piece of milled lumber
spanning the length of the support. In addition, six large,
metal rods (three on each shelf) protrude upward from the
concrete and through the lumber. The remnants of four
smaller supports are located just to the north of Feature 1.
These supports are severely deteriorated, each exhibiting
a different shape and diameter. Two of these supports have
large metal rods protruding out of the concrete.
Feature 2, located approximately 15 m northeast of Feature
1, is a rectangular concrete support measuring 10 feet (300
cm) long, 3 feet (90 cm) wide, and 2 inches (5 cm) tall. The
central portion of the support contains a small, rectangular
raised section with two small, metal bolts protruding from
the concrete.

Figure 5.42.

Feature 1 at 41PP397.

Feature 3, located 5 m southeast of Feature 2, is a
rectangular concrete support measuring 3.5 feet (110 cm)
long and about 3 feet (100 cm) wide. The support is nearly
level with the ground surface and slightly overgrown.
Four large, metal bolts protrude from the concrete in each
corner with one 3-inch (7.5 cm) diameter pipe extending
out from the northwest facing side of the support. Four clear
glass shards were observed on the ground surface around
Features 1 to 3.
Feature 4 is located in the southwestern portion of the
site approximately 75 m southwest of Feature 1. This is a
circular concrete support measuring approximately 4.5 feet
(140 cm) in diameter. The support is extremely deteriorated
and overgrown with pencil cacti.
Feature 5 is a large rock pile located 5 m west of Feature
4 and measures approximately 4.25 feet (130 cm) tall
and is composed of more than 100 sandstone blocks of
varying size (Figure 5.43). One rusted, metal pipe collar
and five pieces of miscellaneous metal were observed in
the phenomenon. Several pieces of milled lumber with
wire nails and one brick fragment were also observed on
the ground surface surrounding the feature.
No temporally diagnostic artifacts or inscriptions were
observed. The manufacturing techniques broadly indicate
activities during the mid- to late twentieth century. The
archival research encountered the Map of Strawn-Gordon
District, Palo Pinto County, Texas produced by W.K.
Gordon in February of 1941 (Freeman 2014). The map
shows the location of Oil Well No. 1 located by W.K.
Gordon himself in January of 1915. The map also indicates
that the discovery of oil in this particular well led to great oil
and gas development and expansion in the region. Oil Well
No. 1 appears to be plotted in the southern portion of the
valley surrounding Palo Pinto Creek, south of the railroad,

that the site is not eligible for inclusion to the NRHP or for
designation as an SAL. Therefore, no further archaeological
work is recommended and no monitoring or conservation
measures are warranted for this site.

Though site 41PP397 and historic Oil Well No. 1 are both
located in the northwest corner of the historic W.C. Dykes
survey, the two sites are certainly different. The features of
site 41PP397 appear to be mid- to late twentieth century
in age and not comparable to Oil Well No. 1 of the early
twentieth century. The Oil Well No. 1 site is likely located
west-southwest of 41PP397 on the opposite side of the
tributary drainage.

Site 41Se317
Site 41SE317 is a historic-age oil well located on a level
terrace south of Palo Pinto Creek and north of a steep
upland rise in the northwestern portion of the park (see
Figure 5.44; Appendix C.7). The site is situated on the right
bank (south side) of Palo Pinto Creek, 150 m to the north,
on the gradually sloping surface of the upper terrace. The
site area has been heavily disturbed by vegetation removal,
extensive heavy machinery excavation, construction
activities for petroleum drilling, road construction, and
erosion. Vegetation throughout the site area consists of short
grasses, scattered mesquite and few mixed hardwoods, and
numerous cedar on the adjacent upland slope. The site is

indicate activities during the mid- to late twentieth century.

A total of five negative shovel tests (MC32, MC35, KS62,
LS25, and LS28) were excavated during the delineation of
the site. Shovel testing generally revealed very compact
silt loam with abundant gravels and CaCO3 filaments at 40
cmbs (Appendix A).

Similar to sites 41SE308 and 41SE309 above, this site
is located in the James Price survey of which Freeman
(2014:127–137) conducted an intensive archival review.
Although the site is temporally ambiguous, the site is likely
early-middle twentieth century in age. If correct, this site
correlates with the time that either the Kittrell or Copeland
families owned this property.

The site is composed of three structural features (Features
1–3) surrounded by a diffuse scatter of miscellaneous midto late twentieth-century industrial and structural debris.
Feature 1 is a 30-foot-long (9-m) collapsed oil storage tank
located near the north-central end of the site area.
Feature 2 is an operational pump jack located in the southcentral portion of the site area adjacent to the dirt and gravel
two-track road.
Feature 3 is wood framed shed clad in corrugated metal
located 40 feet (12 m) southeast of Feature 2 (Figure 5.45).
A diffuse scatter of non-diagnostic miscellaneous metal
debris was observed on the ground surface around the three
features and extending northwestward to the junction of two
dirt-and-gravel two-track roads. The oil well is indicated
on the 1967 Strawn West USGS 7.5-minute Topographic
map indicating an original construction date prior to 1967.
No temporally diagnostic artifacts or inscriptions were

The site is composed of a collapsed oil tank, an operational
petroleum pump jack, a shed, and a sparse surface scatter
of industrial and structural debris within a heavily modified
environment. The archival review suggests that the site
correlates with the time that either the Kittrell or Copeland
families owned the property. None of these individuals are
recorded as historically prominent individuals at a local,
regional, or national level. Due to the commonality of
such features in the region and extensive and pervasive
disturbances upon a temporally ambiguous assemblage,
SWCA recommends that the site is not eligible for inclusion
to the NRHP or for designation as an SAL. Therefore,
no further archaeological work is recommended and no
monitoring or conservation measures are warranted for
this site.

Results of Investigations

Site 41PP398
Site 41PP398 is a surficial prehistoric lithic scatter located
near the base of a steep upland ridge in the northeastern
portion of the park (see Figure 5.3; Appendix C.2). The
site is situated on the upland footslopes adjacent to a
small ephemeral drainage that is a tributary to Palo Pinto
Creek, about 850 m downstream of the site. The area has
been disturbed by vegetation burning and removal, heavy
machinery, fence line construction, and erosion. Vegetation
throughout the site area consists of scattered short grasses,
numerous cedar, and few cacti. The site is delineated by
the extent of cultural materials to the east, west, and south
and by the drainage to the north that extends 60 m north to
south and 40 m east to west.
A total of six negative shovel tests (AW15–16, CK12, CK14,
and KLL12–13) were excavated during the delineation of
the site. Shovel testing revealed shallow silt and clay loams
overlying degraded bedrock at 30 cmbs (Appendix A). The
shovel tests and the exposed profile of the ephemeral wash
indicate there is no possibility for deeply buried cultural
deposits.
Prehistoric artifacts were observed diffusely scattered in
and along the ephemeral wash (Figure 5.46). A total of five
pieces of chert debitage were observed as well as one earlystage biface and one unifacially flaked scraper, all of which

were composed of a similar fine-grained white chert. Also,
one fire-cracked rock fragment was observed at the base of
the wash. No soil staining or other evidence of a thermal
feature was observed, and the fire-cracked rock fragment
could be attributed to recent burning episodes.

41PP398 SummAry AND recommeNDAtioNS
Site 41PP398 is a purely surficial scatter of prehistoric
artifacts composed of lithic debitage and chipped stone tools
of unknown age or cultural affiliation. Based on the sparse
quantity of diffusely scattered artifacts, highly erosional
setting, and no potential for intact, buried cultural deposits,
SWCA recommends that site 41PP398 is not eligible for
inclusion to the NRHP or for designation as an SAL.
Therefore, no further archaeological work is recommended
and no monitoring or conservation measures are warranted
for this site.

Site 41PP399
Site 41PP399 is a moderately disturbed, surficial and buried
prehistoric lithic scatter, roughly 150 m south of 41PP395,
at the northeast end of the park (Figure 5.47; Appendix
C.6). The site is located in a broad valley surrounded by
high upland bluffs on a level to gently sloping terrace of
a tributary to Palo Pinto Creek to the north. Of note, the
site is on the left bank (west side) of a tributary of the

Chapter 5

Results of Investigations
previously mentioned relict channel of Palo Pinto Creek
and positioned about 3 m above the broad channel base (see
Figure 5.2). The site area has been disturbed by vegetation
removal, some possible heavy machinery excavation,
vehicular traffic, and erosion. The vegetation clearing at
the site has left patches of short grasses allowing for high
surface visibility, but mixed hardwoods and shrubs align
the tributary. The site is delineated by the extent of cultural
materials, which extends 60 m northeast to southwest by
170 m northwest to southeast along the drainage.
A total of eight shovel tests (AW95–96, CK62–63,
CK102–103, KLL103, and LK115) were excavated during
the delineation of the site. One shovel test (CK63) was
positive for cultural materials, which revealed one broken
tertiary flake at 0 to 10 cmbs. Generally, the shovel testing
revealed somewhat shallow, silty loam overlying basal
clay or compact soils at 35 cmbs (Appendix A). However,
the inspection of the tributary drainage east of the site
revealed high cut banks (3.5 m+) with deep alluvial deposits
suggesting a potential for intact, buried cultural deposits
(Figure 5.48).
A total of six tertiary flakes and one primary flake were
observed diffusely scattered on the ground surface.
Although the assemblage at the site is limited, a variety of
materials were observed. The chert raw materials observed
were white, light grayish-brown, pinkish-gray, and a
dark gray fossiliferous. No temporally diagnostic tools,
thermally altered rock or cultural features were encountered.
Therefore, the site is an undetermined prehistoric lithic
scatter.

Site 41PP399 is composed of a very sparse quantity of
artifacts and lacks temporally diagnostic tools or features;
however, the site area has potential to contain intact, buried
cultural deposits. With this in mind, the site’s NRHP
eligibility and SAL designation status remains undetermined
pending further work. Further investigations with backhoe
trenching are recommended to determine the presence of
buried deposits and to evaluate the site for NRHP inclusion
or SAL designation. Avoidance is recommended until the
site can be fully evaluated. Finally, as a precautionary
measure, routine monitoring is recommended to protect
against erosion, vandalism, and looting due to the site’s
location near a public roadway (FM 2372).

Site 41PP400
Site 41PP400 is a surficial prehistoric lithic scatter situated
on a narrow, gently sloping interfluve above an unnamed
tributary to Palo Pinto Creek. The site is located just east of
a stock pond and roughly 1.1 miles south of FM 2372 in the
eastern portion of the park (Figure 5.49; Appendix C.3). The
site overlooks a valley to the west upon a finger ridge and
is 30 feet above a tributary drainage. The site area has been
disturbed by vegetation burning and removal and erosion.
The vegetation consists of scattered cedar and short grasses.
The site is delineated by the extent of cultural materials and
the topography, which extends 30 m northeast to southwest
by 80 m northwest to southeast along the landform.
A total of four negative shovel tests (AW63, KLL87, and
LK79–80) were excavated during the delineation of the site.
These excavations revealed gravelly clay loam over shallow
bedrock at 20 cmbs (Appendix A). The site consists of a
somewhat diffuse, yet clustered, accumulation of prehistoric
debitage and chipped stone tools on ground surface,
littered with limestone gravels and cobbles. Prehistoric
artifacts were observed scattered along the landform with
small concentrations observed in areas subject to frequent
erosional processes. Thirty chert flakes were observed on
the ground surface, all of which appear to be late-stage
reduction and primarily composed of red or white chert. A
very small portion of the assemblage is composed of dark
grayish-brown chert and quartzite. Four early-stage biface
fragments, as well as one possible dart point stem (collected
for TPWD curation), were also observed (Figure 5.50;
Appendix E). No temporally diagnostic artifacts, burned
rock, or cultural features was observed. Therefore, the site
is an undetermined prehistoric lithic scatter.

portions of the Dykes survey to a number of individual buy­
ers totaling 1,352 acres. In 1883 Millard sold the remaining
2,146 acres to Anna F. Johnson who in 1898 and 1899 sold
three parcels (1,975.0 acres, 154.4 acres, and 376.6 acres)
to the Central Coal Mining Company. The company owned
the land until 1945, when it sold 3,406 acres to Frank L.
Walker of Eastland County. In 1947 Walker sold the land
to Shalor Copeland. In 2011, the Copeland family trans­
ferred 1,960.785 acres to TPWD for the PPMSP (Freeman
2014:161–165). The artifact assemblage for the site cor­
responds to the time of ownership of Frank L. Walker or,
more likely, the Copeland family.

A total of four negative shovel tests (CK80, LK85–86,
and MC65) were excavated during the delineation of the
site. Shovel testing revealed clay loam overlying shallow
limestone bedrock at 25 cmbs (Appendix A). No structural
debris indicative of a house or outbuilding was observed,
and no common household debris was noted. Based on
the presence of petroleum drilling debris, the area likely
served as a temporary camp for petroleum exploration and
expansion in the area.

41PP401 SummAry AND recommeNDAtioNS

The site was initially identified by a diffuse scatter of
historic debris observed adjacent to the rocky two-track
road. Artifacts observed on surface include braided steel
cables, rusted sheet metal, round nails, metal straps,
steel pipes, one well cap, one concrete-filled wellhead,
one crushed sanitary can, and one 10-ounce Coca Cola
bottle and cap. Most artifacts observed on the surface lack
temporally diagnostic maker’s marks. However, various
manufacturing techniques (i.e., sanitary can and Coca
Cola bottle) suggest the data on the site contains mid- to
late twentieth-century activities (IMACS 2001; Coca Cola
Company 2010). Similarly, the industrial nature of the
assemblage suggests an association with the petroleum
extraction activities.

Site 41PP401 is a diffusely spread scatter of fragmentary
historic artifacts likely associated with petroleum develop­
ment and exploration. The site has been heavily affected by
prior disturbances and the common assemblage is broadly
associated with the mid- to late twentieth century. Further­
more, the artifact assemblage correlates with the time that
either Frank L. Walker or the Copeland family owned the
property. None of these individuals are recorded as histori­
cally prominent individuals at a local, regional, or national
level. Accordingly, SWCA recommends that the site is not
eligible for inclusion to the NRHP or for designation as
an SAL. Consequently, no further archaeological work is
recommended and no monitoring or conservation measures
are warranted for this site.

Freeman’s (2014:161–165) archival research encompassed
site 41PP401, which is indicated to be within the William
C. Dykes survey. This survey is a 3,498-acre tract of land
patented to Frederick S. and Henry B. Millard in 1856. The
following year Frederick S. Millard sold his portion to his
brother Henry. Prior to 1883, Henry Millard sold various

General overview of 41PP401.

Site 41PP402 is a highly disturbed, surficial early to midtwentieth-century artifact scatter along the eastern boundary
of the park, approximately 1 mile south of FM 2372 (see
Figure 5.3; Appendix C.3). The site is positioned at the
intersection of a couple of two-track roads along the western
edge of a level saddle bordered by a prominent upland rise
to the southwest and Evensville Peak to the east. The site
area has been disturbed by road construction, mechanical
brush clearing, heavy machinery excavation, and erosion.
Vegetation consists of juniper, short grasses, and cacti
allowing for large, open areas exposing the gravelly surface
and exposed limestone bedrock (Figure 5.52). The site is
delineated by the extent of cultural materials that extend
over 130 feet (40 m) northeast to southwest by 82 feet (25
m) northwest to southeast.
The site was initially identified by a diffuse surface scatter
of fragmented historic artifacts within and adjacent to the
existing two-track road. Four shovel tests (AE13, KL16,
and LK112–113) were excavated during the delineation of
the site due to the abundance of exposed limestone bedrock
(Appendix A). The shovel tests were negative for cultural
materials and revealed shallow, gravelly soils overlying

recommends that the site is not eligible for inclusion to the
NRHP or for designation as an SAL. Therefore, no further
archaeological work is recommended and no monitoring or
conservation measures are warranted for this site.

cultural deposits.
The artifact assemblage at the site includes: one aquacolored glass insulator fragment, one leaf spring, one
crushed sanitary can, one amethyst-colored glass shard,
20 clear bottle glass shards, one brown-and-white glazed
stoneware fragment, one metal pull tab, one tin can with
church key opening, one metal can with pull tab opening,
one hole-in-top can lid fragment, nine whiteware fragments,
and one 10-ounce Coca Cola bottle. No structural debris
indicative of a house or outbuilding was observed. Based
on temporally diagnostic manufacturing techniques (e.g.,
sanitary can, amethyst glass, and Coca Cola bottle) suggest
the data on the site contains early to mid-twentieth-century
activities (Coca Cola Company 2010; IMACS 2001).
Similar to site 41PP401 above, this site is located in the
William C. Dykes survey that Freeman (2014:161–165)
conducted an intensive archival review. The artifact
assemblage corresponds with the time of ownership of
Frank L. Walker or, more likely, the Copeland family.

Site 41PP402 is a surface scatter of fragmentary historic
debris likely dating from the early to mid-twentieth century.
The artifacts are highly fragmented, and no evidence of a
structure was observed. The site function is unclear but may
be associated with petroleum development and exploration,
hunting camp, cedar chopping, or a combination of these
activities. The site has been heavily affected by disturbances
and the assemblage is broadly associated with the early to
mid-twentieth century. Furthermore, the artifact assemblage
correlates with the time that either Frank L. Walker or the
Copeland family owned the property. None of these indi­
viduals are recorded as historically prominent individuals

Site 41PP403 is a surficial historic-age petroleum
drilling site and artifact scatter located adjacent to a
road approximately 0.19 mile south of FM 2372 in the
northeastern portion of the park (see Figure 5.3; Appendix
C.2). The mid-twentieth-century site is situated on an upland
foot slope on a colluvial drape overlooking an unnamed
tributary to Palo Pinto Creek, 20 m to the north of the site
(Figure 5.53). The site area has been heavily disturbed
by heavy machine road construction, vegetation removal,
construction activities for petroleum drilling, and erosion.
Vegetation throughout the site area is moderately wooded
with cedar, scattered mature oaks, and short grasses. The
site is delineated by the extent of cultural materials, which
extends 311 feet (95 m) northeast to southwest by 230 feet
(70 m) northwest to southeast along the tributary drainage
and road.
Two shovel tests (ANY05 and JU07) were excavated during
the delineation of the site. The shovel tests were negative
and revealed gravelly silt loam overlying bedrock or
compact, sterile soils at 30 cmbs (Appendix A). No evidence
of structures (e.g., foundations) was observed. In addition,
the 1967 Strawn West USGS 7.5-minute topographic
quadrangle map depicts an oil well approximately 475 feet
(144 m) southwest of the site area.
The site was initially identified by a diffuse yet clustered
scatter of historic artifacts. Intensive pedestrian surface
inspection revealed two moderately dense clusters of
artifacts at the north and south ends of the site area. The
north cluster is located just east of the road within a small
area that had been partially cleared of vegetation in the
past (Figure 5.54). This cluster is composed of braided
steel cable, eight sanitary cans with knife-cut openings,
four “WALSH XX” red brick fragments, and one ambercolored snuff bottle. The snuff bottle contains a line of four
raised dots on the base. The dots were originally thought
to be indicative of the strength of the snuff; however, the
number and pattern of dots can likely be attributed to quality
control efforts between machines during production of the
bottles (Lindsey 2014). In addition, one clear glass bottle
was also observed at the edge of the road cut. The bottle has
the Owens-Illinois Glass Company and Duraglass maker’s
mark. The combination of the two maker’s marks date to
the mid-twentieth century (Lindsey 2014).
The second cluster of artifacts is located approximately
200 feet south-southwest of the north cluster. This cluster

is situated roughly 100 feet southeast of the road above an
ephemeral tributary drainage. Eight clear glass jars and
bottles, 15 tin cans, two whiteware fragments, sections of
braided cable, one rusted gas can, and five miscellaneous
metal fragments were observed. Few sanitary cans with
knife-cut openings were observed along with beer cans with
opposing church key openings. In addition, four hole-in-top
cans of varying sizes were also observed. The hole-in-top
cans have opposing knife-cut openings and likely contained
condensed milk. Only two of the milk cans were measurable
with one having diagnostic measurements indicating
manufacture between 1950 to present, and the second can
was manufactured between 1950 and 1985 (IMACS 2001).
The clear glass jars and bottles have screw top, metal lids.
Two of the jars have the Owens-Illinois Glass Company
maker’s mark on the base of the jars with the Duraglass
logo embossed on the sides. As previously mentioned,
these diagnostic manufacturing traits indicate activities in
the mid-twentieth century (IMACS 2001; Lindsey 2014).

Gordon in February of 1941 (Freeman 2014). The map
shows the location of Oil Well No. 1 located by W.K.
Gordon himself in January of 1915. The map also indicates
that the discovery of oil in this particular well led to great oil
and gas development and expansion in the region. Oil Well
No. 1 appears to be plotted in the southern portion of the
valley surrounding Palo Pinto Creek, south of the railroad,
north of the high upland bluffs, and south of the confluence
of Palo Pinto Creek and an unnamed tributary drainage. In
addition, the well appears to be in the northwest corner of
the W.C. Dykes Survey Abstract No. 2018 (Freeman 2014).
Though 41PP403 and historic Oil Well No. 1 are both
located in the northwest corner of the historic W.C. Dykes
survey, the two sites are possibly different. The assemblage
of 41PP403 appears to be mid-twentieth century in age
compared to Oil Well No. 1 that dates to the early twentieth
century. Regardless, this site is reportedly in the vicinity of
Oil Well No. 1 and may have an association.

41PP403 SummAry AND recommeNDAtioNS
Site 41PP403 is a surface scatter of historic debris likely
dating from the mid-twentieth century. The assemblage
includes subsistence artifacts (e.g., tin cans, condiment
containers, jars), some structural remains (bricks) and tools
(braided cables and gas can) suggesting some habitation and
industrial labor. The historic maps indicate that the site is
situated near historic Oil Well No. 1. SWCA recommends
further archival research and/or oral interviews to determine
site function and its possible association with Oil Well
No. 1. Therefore, the site’s NRHP eligibility and SAL
designation status remains undetermined pending further
work. Further archival investigations are recommended to
determine if this site may be the location of Oil Well No.
1. Avoidance is recommended until the site can be fully

monitoring is recommended to protect against erosion,
vandalism, and possible looting.

Site 41PP404
Site 41PP404 is a surficial historic-age petroleum drilling
well pad site located east of a road and approximately 0.29
mile south of FM 2372 in the northeastern portion of the
park (see Figure 5.3; Appendix C.2). This early to midtwentieth-century site is situated on an upland foot slope
on a colluvial drape between two intermittent tributary
drainages of Palo Pinto Creek (Figure 5.55). The site area
has been moderately disturbed by some vegetation removal,
construction activities for petroleum drilling, and erosion.
The site area is in a moderately wooded area surrounded
by mature oaks, low scrub brush, green briar, and short
grasses allowing for low ground surface visibility. The site is
delineated by the extent of cultural materials, which extends

210 feet (64 m) northeast to southwest by 130 feet (40 m)
northwest to southeast along the tributary drainage and road.
A total of three negative shovel tests (KAM02, KAM05,
and KLL135) were excavated during the delineation of the
site. These excavations revealed gravelly silt loam overlying
bedrock or impassable gravels at 35 cmbs (Appendix A).
The site consists of a historic well pad surrounded by a
scatter of associated debris. The well pad consists of a
wooden platform measuring roughly 10 feet (3 m) long and
2.5 feet (75 cm) wide, with two large railroad ties secured
with one shorter crossbeam (Figure 5.56). Seven large,
metal bolts and rods protrude from the crossbeam. One large
metal pipe, measuring approximately 12 inches (30 cm) in
diameter and 14 inches (35 cm) tall, is located at one end of
the platform between the two railroad ties. The large pipe
extends vertically into the ground for an unknown depth and
the exposed end has been purposely crushed. One smaller
pipe, roughly 3 inches (7.5 cm) in diameter, protrudes from
the ground adjacent to the platform. Four accumulations of
braided steel cable and three additional vertical pipes were
observed east and southwest of the platform. In addition, a
cluster of five, small vertical pipes were observed protruding
from the ground surface approximately 90 feet (27.5 m)
west-southwest from the platform on the opposite side of
a tributary channel (Figure 5.57). Two sanitary tin canisters
were observed on the site; one was found on the platform
and the second was near the cluster of pipes. The fact that
both artifacts were crushed likely prevented them from
washing away down slope.
Notably, the exposed ends of all of the pipes had been
systematically crushed or bent over. Further, all of the
pipes varied in diameter with no uniformity, likewise,
the bolts holding the platform together were not uniform.
No temporally diagnostic artifacts or inscriptions were
observed at the site. However, based on manufacturing
techniques and methods, the site appears to date to the early
to mid-twentieth century.
The previously mentioned archival research identified
a historic Oil Well No. 1 near this location (Freeman
2014). Similarly, the 1967 Strawn West USGS 7.5-minute
topographic quadrangle map depicts an oil well about 200
feet (60 m) west of the site area. Historic Oil Well No. 1
and 41PP404 are both located in the northwest corner of
the historic W.C. Dykes survey, are seemingly equivalent
temporally, and roughly correlate with the mapped location.
The assemblage of 41PP404 appears to be early to midtwentieth century in age compared to Oil Well No. 1 that
dates to the early twentieth century. Of the three encountered
archaeological sites in the vicinity (41PP397, 41PP403, and
41PP404), this site is the most likely match with Oil Well
No. 1 and may be associated.

Site 41PP405

Site 41PP404 consists of a sparse surface scatter of historic
artifacts and three cultural features. The features, consisting
of a wooden platform and various vertical pipes, represent
the remnants of an old well pad site. SWCA recommends
further archival research and/or oral interviews to determine
site function and its possible association with Oil Well
No. 1. Therefore, the site’s NRHP eligibility and SAL
designation status remains undetermined pending further
work. Further archival investigations are recommended to
determine if this site may be the location of Oil Well No.
1. Avoidance is recommended until the site can be fully
evaluated. Finally, as a precautionary measure, routine
monitoring is recommended to protect against erosion,
vandalism, and possible looting.

Site 41PP405 is a surficial and buried prehistoric campsite
located about 250 m south of FM 2372 at the northeast end
of the park (Figure 5.58; Appendix C.2). The site is situated
on a small finger ridge overlooking a tributary of Palo Pinto
Creek, about 4 to 5 m below the site. The creek wraps
around the west, north, and east sides of the landform. The
site area has been moderately disturbed by heavy equipment
excavation (road construction), vehicular traffic, vegetation
removal, and erosion. Vegetation consists of mesquite scrub,
cedar trees, prickly pear cacti, and short grasses allowing
for low ground surface visibility. The site is bordered on
the west, north, and east sides by natural topography and to
the south by the extent of cultural materials encompassing
a 150-m-diameter area.
A total of three shovel tests (ANY15, LS161, and MC93)
were excavated in the site area, of which two were positive
for cultural materials (MC93 and ANY15). Shovel test
MC93 revealed one fossiliferous tertiary flake at 0 to 10

cmbs and one dark gray and tan tertiary chert flake at 30
to 40 cmbs. Shovel test ANY15 revealed three pieces of
prehistoric lithic debitage at 10 to 20 cmbs. The debitage
consists of one pinkish gray, heat-treated secondary chert
flake, one gray fossiliferous tertiary flake, and one grayishbrown, secondary chert flake. In addition, a layer of light
red, burned sandstone fragments (n=20) and a small pocket
of charcoal were revealed at 15 cmbs in ANY15. The
remaining shovel tests were negative, revealing firm clay
loam to a depth of 40 cmbs, and terminated at compact
soils (Appendix A).
Intensive pedestrian surface inspection of the site area
encountered further lithic debitage, burned rock fragments,
and chipped stone tools clustered near the road cut.
The surface assemblage contains secondary and tertiary
chert flakes (n=25), one core, five burned sandstone
fragments, and one projectile point. The varied chert
raw materials include: white, tan, and gray-and-tan finegrained chert; dark gray coarse-grained chert; and dark
gray fossiliferous chert. The projectile point (collected
for TPWD curation) is manufactured from very dark gray
chert and morphologically similar to a Scallorn suggesting
Late Prehistoric activity (Figure 5.59). In addition to the
projectile point, all lithic debitage recovered from the shovel
tests was also collected for curation (Appendix E). All other
artifacts were discarded in the field.

Site 41PP405 is a Late Prehistoric campsite with a surface
scatter of lithic debitage, chipped stone tools, and burned
rock. In addition, the site contains buried cultural deposits
and a possible buried thermal feature at 15 cmbs.
SWCA recommends further investigation with backhoe
trenching to explore the full horizontal and vertical extent
of the prehistoric component within the deeper alluvial
deposits and to determine whether intact cultural materials
are present. Consequently, the site’s NRHP eligibility and
SAL designation status remains undetermined pending
further work. Further investigations with backhoe trenching
are recommended to determine the presence of buried
deposits and to evaluate the site for NRHP inclusion or SAL
designation. Avoidance is recommended until the site can

routine monitoring is recommended to protect against lateral
erosion, vandalism, and looting.

Site 41PP406
Site 41PP406 is a surficial prehistoric lithic scatter in the
uplands, located about 1.6 miles south of FM 2372 near the
southern park boundary (Figure 5.60; Appendix C.4). The
site is situated around an upland ephemeral wash at the edge
of a broad bluff. The site area gently slopes to the southwest

with vegetation consisting of short grasses and cacti dotted
with sparse juniper. The area is highly erosional with many
areas of bare ground and exposed sandstone bedrock. The
site is defined by the extent of cultural materials to the
north, west, and east and by natural topography to the south,
extending 100 m east to west and 240 m north to south.
A total of seven negative shovel tests (ANY26, CK121–
123, MC98–99, and MC102) were excavated during the
delineation of the site. Shovel testing revealed very shallow,
sandy soils overlying bedrock at 15 cmbs indicating no
potential for intact, buried cultural deposits (Appendix A).
The site consists of a very sparse quantity of diffusely
scattered lithic debitage (n=7), two chipped stone tool
fragments, and a possible ground stone fragment on an
erosional slope surrounded by large sandstone cobbles
and boulders. The chert debitage consists of one primary
flake, two secondary flakes, and four tertiary flakes. The
tertiary flakes are all composed of a similar tan, fine-grained
chert. The secondary flake is composed of a dark grayishbrown chert with moderate patina, and the primary flake
is composed of a brown, fine-grained chert. One chipped
stone tool is a utilized flake, possibly a scraper while the
second chipped stone tool appears to be a bifacially worked
lateral-midsection of a projectile point (Figure 5.61). The
projectile point fragment is unidentifiable as to typology.
Finally, the possible ground stone fragment is a small (4.5

Artifact assemblage of 41PP407.

Site 41PP408 is a disturbed, surficial historic mid- to late
twentieth-century artifact scatter located just west of a
rocky two-track road, roughly 0.88 mile south of FM 2372
near the southern park boundary (Figure 5.64; Appendix
C.3). The site is situated along the base of an upland
slope, east of a prominent finger ridge and southwest of an
unnamed tributary to Palo Pinto Creek. The site has been
disturbed by fence line construction, vegetation removal,
road construction, and erosion. Ground surface visibility is
high throughout the site, as only sparse junipers and short,
patchy grasses remain. The extent of cultural materials
encompasses an approximate 180-foot (54-m) diameter
area.
Only one negative shovel test (ANY07) was excavated
during the delineation of the site due to the prevalence of
sandstone boulders and exposed bedrock and excellent
surface visibility. The shovel test revealed gravelly silt
loam overlying bedrock at 10 cmbs, indicating no potential
for intact, buried cultural deposits (Appendix A). No
foundations or further structural debris was encountered.

Results of Investigations
This historic site consists of fragmentary, surficial
assemblage clustered between a fence line and slope. The
surficial artifact assemblage consists of approximately 100
round nails; 20 Acme brick fragments; one portable, cast
iron furnace/stove base; two small, metal drums and lids;
one crushed sanitary can; 10 lumber fragments; one braided
steel cable; and miscellaneous sheet metal fragments. The
lumber fragments were observed in a small (3 feet [90 cm] in
diameter) depression in the southeastern portion of the site
(Figure 5.65). The assemblage has a paucity of temporally
diagnostic artifacts, but several artifacts (e.g.., brick and
stove base) suggest mid- to late twentieth-century activities.
Based on the industrial nature of many of the artifacts, the
site is likely associated with oil and gas development in
the area.

41PP408 SummAry AND recommeNDAtioNS
Based upon the presence of industrial debris, as well as
some structural remains (bricks, lumber), this site is likely
associated with mid- to late twentieth-century petroleum
exploration in the area. No evidence of structures (e.g.,
foundations) was observed, but these may have been razed
and removed. Overall, the site has been severely disturbed,
is exclusively surficial, and is broadly associated with
the twentieth century. SWCA recommends that the site is
not eligible for inclusion to the NRHP or for designation
as an SAL. Therefore, no further archaeological work is
recommended and no monitoring or conservation measures

Site 41PP409
Site 41PP409 is an upland, prehistoric lithic scatter located
west of a rocky two-track road, approximately 1.12 miles
south of FM 2372 in the southern portion of the park (Figure
5.66; Appendix C.3). The site is situated at the edge of a
prominent finger ridge, overlooking a level saddle to the
north and a steep tributary valley to the west. The site
has been disturbed by vegetation removal and erosion.
Vegetation consists of moderately open cedar with an
understory of short, patchy grasses. The extent of cultural
materials extends about 100 m north to south and 60 m
east to west.
A total of four shovel tests (ANY51, CK149, LS188,
and MC122) were excavated, of which one (CK149)
was positive for cultural materials. Shovel test CK149,
located in the north-central portion of the site, revealed one
brown, secondary chert flake at 0 to 8 cmbs. The remaining
shovel tests revealed loose, sandy loam overlying shallow
bedrock at 5 cmbs (Appendix A). The surrounding area was
investigated with additional shovel tests, which were also
negative for cultural materials (see Figure5.66). Based on
the erosional nature of the landform, the site likely contains
mixed deposits throughout; however, there is little to no
potential for intact, buried cultural deposits.
The site was initially identified by a diffuse scatter of
prehistoric lithic debitage exposed in highly erosional
areas along the edges of the landform. Intensive surface
inspection revealed 20 tertiary flakes, five secondary flakes,
and one primary flake widely dispersed among sandstone
boulders and exposed sandstone bedrock. The artifacts are
manufactured from pink and white fine-grained chert, light
grayish-brown, fine-grained chert with slight patina, and
dark gray fossiliferous chert (Figure 5.67). No chipped stone
tools, temporally diagnostic artifacts, cultural features, or
burned rock was observed on the site, which is interpreted
to be a common prehistoric lithic scatter.

were excavated east and west of the fire break; however,
no additional surface or subsurface artifacts were identified.
The site consists of a sparse quantity (n=23) of diffusely
scattered surficial prehistoric artifacts along disturbed,
bladed areas. The assemblage includes 16 tertiary flakes,
five secondary flakes, one core, and one biface. The artifacts
are manufactured from gray to dark-gray coarse-grained and
fine-grained chert and a white fine-grained chert material
(Figure 5.70). One middle-stage biface of white chert was
observed at the eastern edge of the fire break in a small push
pile. One thermally altered rock fragment was observed, but
no soil staining or additional thermally altered materials
were encountered. The thermally altered rock may be from
more recent burning and is not definitively determined to be
prehistoric. No chipped stone tools, temporally diagnostic
artifacts, or cultural features were observed on the site..

Site 41PP410 is a purely surficial scatter of prehistoric
lithic debitage and two chipped stone tools of unknown
age or cultural affiliation. Based on the sparse quantity of
diffusely scattered artifacts, the extent of prior disturbances,
and no potential for intact, buried cultural deposits, SWCA
recommends that the site is not eligible for inclusion to the
NRHP or for designation as an SAL. Accordingly, no further
archaeological work is recommended and no monitoring or
conservation measures are warranted for this site.

Site 41PP411
Site 41PP411 is a surficial upland prehistoric (PaleoindianLate Prehistoric) lithic scatter located about 0.58 mile
south of Tucker Lake and 1.2 miles south of FM 2372,
along the southern park boundary (Figure 5.71; Appendix
C.5). The site is situated along a gradual sloping edge of a
broad upland landform near the headwaters of an unnamed
tributary to Russell Creek. The site has been disturbed by
recent fires, vegetation removal, and erosion that have
exposed large areas of sandstone bedrock (Figure 5.72).
The extent of cultural materials extends roughly 75 m east
to west and 60 m north to south.
A total of eight negative shovel tests (JU57–59 and
KLL172–176) were excavated during the delineation of
the site. Shovel testing revealed sandy loam with angular
gravels overlying shallow sandstone bedrock at 20 cmbs
(Appendix A). Based on the prevalent exposed sandstone
bedrock throughout the site area, there is little to no potential
for intact, buried cultural deposits.

stone tool fragments, and three projectile point fragments
manufactured from fine-grained white chert, fine-grained
grayish-brown chert with minor patina, light gray coarsegrained chert, fine grained very dark gray chert, and a
dark gray fossiliferous chert. The debitage in order of
prevalence is tertiary (n=25), secondary (n=5), and two
primary reduction flakes. The chipped stone tools are one
scraper and one medial section of a late-stage biface. The
three projectile points include a possible Early Archaic
Hoxie dart point composed of tan chert, a possible Late
Paleoindian Early Stemmed Lanceolate composed of light
grayish-brown, fine-grained chert, and a medial fragment
of a Late Prehistoric Scallorn arrow point composed of
fine-grained, white chert (Figure 5.73). No burned rock or
cultural features were encountered.

The presence of diagnostic artifacts from Paleoindian to
Late Prehistoric indicates an expansive temporal spread at
the site. Further, the shallowly buried and exposed bedrock
indicates that no buried deposits are present. Due to these
factors, the site is interpreted to be a palimpsest, disturbed
by erosional sheet wash.

41PP411 SummAry AND recommeNDAtioNS
The presence of three widely varying temporally diagnostic
artifacts, spanning several thousand years, indicates a
temporally broad prehistoric palimpsest. Based on the
solely surficial nature of the site, erosional setting, and
no potential for intact, buried cultural deposits, SWCA
recommends that the site is not eligible for inclusion to
the NRHP or for designation as an SAL. Accordingly, no
further archaeological work is recommended. Finally, since
all temporally diagnostic artifacts from the site have been
collected and will be curated, no monitoring or conservation
measures are warranted for this site (Appendix E).

Site 41PP412
Site 41PP412 is a surficial and shallowly buried prehistoric
lithic scatter located south of Tucker Lake, roughly 1.1 miles
south of FM 2372, near the southern park boundary. The
site is situated on a very prominent, narrow upland ridge
with steep slopes flanking the east and west sides, and a
low-lying saddle to the north (Figure 5.74; Appendix C.5).
The ridge is positioned between Russell Creek, 160 m to the
west, and an unnamed tributary to Russell Creek, 150 m to
the east, which both flow northward and empty into Tucker
Lake. The site has been disturbed by vegetation removal,
heavy machinery blading, and erosion. Vegetation includes
scattered cedar with an understory of short, patchy grasses
and cacti. The site is delineated by natural topography and
the extent of cultural materials that extends 450 m northwest
to southeast and 160 m northeast to southwest.
A total of 24 shovel tests (ANY83–85, ANY90–91,
ANY93–95, CK184–185, CK190, JU71, JU73–74,
JU81–84, KLL186–188, and KLL192–194) were excavated
during the delineation of the site, of which three (ANY94–
95 and CK190) were positive for cultural material. In
general, shovel testing revealed very shallow, sandy soils
overlying shallow sandstone bedrock at 20 cmbs (Appendix
A). A localized, gently sloping saddle side slope, located
in the southeastern portion of the site, contains colluvial
deposits reaching 90 cmbs. The three positive shovel tests
are located on the aforementioned side slope and revealed
cultural materials at depths of 40 to 80 cmbs. Shovel test
CK190 revealed three tertiary flakes at 40 to 50 cmbs, two
tertiary flakes at 50 to 60 cmbs, one tertiary flake at 60 to
70 cmbs, and one tertiary flake at 70 to 80 cmbs. Shovel
test ANY94, located 40 m southeast of shovel test CK190,
revealed two tertiary flakes and one secondary flake at 40 to
50 cmbs. Finally, shovel test ANY95, located 45 m southsouthwest of shovel test ANY94, revealed one tertiary flake

93

at 40 to 50 cmbs. Areas with abundant, exposed bedrock
were observed surrounding the localized deeper deposits.
The site was initially identified by a very sparse scatter
of prehistoric lithic debitage and one scraper observed on
the ground surface in an old road cut. Intensive surface
inspection revealed a diffuse, yet continuous, scatter
encompassing the top of the ridge. The assemblage consists
of 50 tertiary and 50 secondary chert flakes, a chert scraper,
one middle-stage biface fragment, and one medial fragment
of a late-stage biface (Figure 5.75). The raw materials were
a combination of fine-grained white and light grayishbrown colored chert. All surface artifacts were observed
in erosional areas near outcroppings of sandstone bedrock.
No temporally diagnostic artifacts, burned rock, or cultural
features were observed on the site, which is interpreted to
be a prehistoric lithic scatter of unknown age or function.

41PP412 SummAry AND recommeNDAtioNS
Site 41PP412 is a predominately surficial scatter of
prehistoric artifacts composed of lithic debitage and
chipped stone tools of unknown age or cultural affiliation.
Subsurface deposits were encountered; however, the
deposits appear mixed and are limited to a narrow side
slope. Based on the predominantly surficial nature of the
site, erosional setting, and no potential for intact, buried
cultural deposits, SWCA recommends that the site is not
eligible for inclusion to the NRHP or for designation as
an SAL. Accordingly, no further archaeological work is
recommended and no monitoring or conservation measures
are warranted for this site.

Site 41PP413
Site 41PP413 is a surficial and shallowly buried prehistoric
lithic scatter located about 0.15 mile south of Tucker Lake
and 0.81 mile south of FM 2372, near the southern park
boundary (Figure 5.76; Appendix C.5). The site is situated
on a lower terrace of a large, upland bluff overlooking an
unnamed tributary to Russell Creek, 250 m to the west.
Ground surface visibility is high throughout the site area
due to vegetation clearing, graded road cuts, and a recent
burning episode. Large sandstone cobbles and boulders,
as well as exposed sandstone bedrock, are prevalent
throughout the site area. Vegetation consists of sparse cedar
and mesquite scrub with medium-height grasses and cacti.
The site is delineated by the extent of cultural materials that
is 220 m east to west and 150 m north to south.
A total of 11 shovel tests (JU61–65, LS220–221, LS227,
MC150–151, and MC157) were excavated during the

delineation of the site, of which one (MC150) was positive
for cultural material. Shovel test MC150 revealed one
secondary flake composed of a coarse-grained, reddishbrown chert at 20 to 40 cmbs. All other shovel tests revealed
shallow, sandy deposits overlying sandstone bedrock at 15
cmbs (Appendix A). Based on the shallow deposits and
prevalence of exposed bedrock, there is no potential for
intact, buried cultural deposits.

Site map 41PP413.

The site was initially identified by a diffuse scatter of
prehistoric lithic debitage on ground surface with broad
exposures of sandstone bedrock. The site assemblage
consists of tertiary chert flakes (n=25), one primary chert
flake, one secondary chert flake, a chert core, one scraper,
and one biface fragment. The debitage is composed of
an array of different fine-grained chert raw materials
including: white, pinkish-gray, light gray, and yellowishbrown. The scraper appears to be a large, primary flake
with additional flaking on one lateral edge that is composed
of a yellowish-brown chert with large, white inclusions.
The biface fragment is the distal section of a middle-stage
biface composed of a white and grayish-brown swirled
chert with large, white inclusions (Figure 5.77). All surface

96

Chapter 5
consists of scattered cedar and short grasses with excellent
surface visibility approaching 80 percent (Figure 5.79).
The surrounding surface was examined for any historic
debris to provide an age for the site, but no materials were
observed either up or down slope from the kiln/oven.
Four shovel tests (JU92–94 and KLL202) were excavated
in the vicinity of the feature that generally encountered
yellowish-brown silty clay loam with many (20 percent)
gravels and pebbles overlying shallow (about 10–15 cmbs)
bedrock (Appendix A). Despite the absence of any cultural
materials, this feature is certainly not a natural phenomenon
and is interpreted to be historic. Notably, the absence of any
materials may be attributed to erosion due to the relatively
steep gradient (about 18 degrees) of the slope.

artifacts were observed in erosional areas near outcroppings
of sandstone bedrock. No temporally diagnostic artifacts,
burned rock, or cultural features were observed on the site,
which is interpreted to be an unknown prehistoric lithic
scatter.

Site 41PP413 is a predominately surficial scatter of
prehistoric artifacts composed of lithic debitage and chipped
stone tools of unknown age or cultural affiliation within
a disturbed setting. One positive shovel test produced
one flake at 20 to 40 cmbs; however, exposed sandstone
bedrock is prevalent throughout the site area. Based on the
predominantly surficial nature of the site, erosional setting,
and no potential for intact, buried cultural deposits, SWCA
recommends that the site is not eligible for inclusion to the
NRHP or for designation as an SAL. Accordingly, no further
archaeological work is recommended and no monitoring or
conservation measures are warranted for this site.

Site 41Se318
Site 41SE318 is a historic feature located west of Tucker
Lake, roughly 1 mile southwest of the terminus of FM2372,
near the middle of the park (Figure 5.78; Appendix C.5).
The site, a historic kiln/oven feature, is situated on a side
slope of an upland ridge on the eastern flank of a tributary
drainage of Palo Pinto Creek, about 0.3 miles to the north.
Interestingly, no roads or established trails are in evidence
around the feature. The closest two-track road is about 900
feet due west of the feature. The surrounding vegetation

The kiln/oven phenomenon is constructed into an existing
limestone bedrock formation exposed on the ground surface
(Figure 5.80). There appears to be two strata of differing
limestone with the modified kiln/oven carved into the
upper, tabular, more angular blocky, friable matrix resting
upon a denser, extremely indurated limestone of larger
blocks (Figure 5.81). The construction and thermal activity
within the kiln/oven likely contributed to the friability
and angularity of the upper strata. The apparent opening
of the kiln/oven faces upslope and ranges from 60 to 90
cm in width, 40 cm in height, and 1.2 m in depth. The
smaller opening on the downslope side of the kiln/oven
is approximately 50 cm in width and 30 cm in height.
Although no charcoal or distinct staining were observed on
the base of the kiln/oven (which is the underlying denser
limestone), the cavity walls and roof exhibit extensive
thermal alteration and staining possibly from smoke.

41Se318 SummAry AND recommeNDAtioNS
Based upon the absence of temporally diagnostic artifacts, a
determination as to the exact age of this feature is currently
unknown. Further, no evidence of associated structures
(e.g., foundations) or cultural materials were observed,
but these may have been minimal and/or lost through sloe
wash and erosion. SWCA recommends further archival
research and/or oral interviews to determine site function
and possible chronology. With this in mind, the NRHPeligibility status of site 41SE318 is currently undetermined,
until additional work is able to fully assess the significance
of the site. Based on presence of a large structural feature
and its location within a public park, it is considered a likely
target of vandalism; therefore, SWCA recommends that the
site is eligible for designation as an SAL. Finally, the site
warrants protective measures (e.g., monitoring) against
vandalism, looting, and erosion.

Site 41PP414
Site 41PP414, a possible prehistoric feature, is located near
previously mentioned site 41PP405, about 225 m south of
FM 2372 at the northeast end of the park (see Figure 5.58;
Appendix C.2). The site is situated on the left bank (west
side) of an unnamed tributary to Palo Pinto Creek on the
upper terrace, about 3 m above the channel. The site area has
been moderately disturbed by heavy equipment excavation
(road construction), vehicular traffic, vegetation removal,
cattle, and erosion. The site area is open pasture featuring
short grasses with mixed hardwoods aligning the tributary
drainage. The site is bordered on the south and east sides by
natural topography and to the north and west by the extent
of cultural materials encompassing a 5-m-diameter area.
The site consists of burned rock with soil staining, observed
eroding from the cut bank profile (Figure 5.82). The burned
rock phenomenon is exposed roughly 40 cmbs in a cut bank,
approximately 3 feet above the current creek bed opposite
from site 41PP405. Ten pieces of burned rock were observed
within the wall of the cut bank and eroding into a cattle
trail. A darker, slightly ashy matrix surrounds the burned
rock in the exposure. One negative shovel test (ANY70)
was excavated 5 m north of the feature on top of the terrace.
The shovel test revealed dark brown, sandy clay loam with
abundant calcium carbonate filaments terminating at 70
cmbs due to compact soils (Appendix A). Soils generally
become lighter with depth due to an increase in carbonates.
No burned rock or soil staining was observed. The cut bank
profile surrounding the feature was also inspected revealing
no additional burned rock or ashy staining, and no lithic
debitage or chipped stone tools were observed on the site.
Seven additional shovel tests (ANY14, AY241, LS159–160,
CK117, KL196, and MC92) were excavated nearby on the
landform containing the buried feature. These excavations
typically revealed sandy clay loam with calcium carbonate
filaments to a depth of 80 cmbs before terminating at
compact soils (Appendix A).

No definitively prehistoric materials were observed at
the site. The hearth is presumed to be prehistoric, but
it could also be historic or represent a relatively recent
thermal activity. No other activities (e.g., flint knapping or
butchering) could be identified; however, deep (3 m) alluvial
deposits were observed. SWCA recommends further
investigation with backhoe trenching to explore the full
horizontal and vertical extent of the prehistoric component
within the deeper alluvial deposits and to determine
whether intact cultural materials are present. Accordingly,
the site’s NRHP eligibility and SAL designation status
remains undetermined pending further work. Further
investigations with backhoe trenching are recommended to

the site for NRHP inclusion or SAL designation. Avoidance
is recommended until the site can be fully evaluated.
Finally, as a precautionary measure, routine monitoring is
recommended to protect against looting, vandalism, and
possible lateral erosion from the tributary drainage.

Site 41PP415
Site 41PP415 is a disturbed, surficial historic early
twentieth-century site containing one feature and an artifact
scatter. The site is located on the south side of FM 2372,
0.3 mile west of the intersection of FM 2372 and Copeland
Road (Figure 5.83; Appendix C.2). The site is located in
a relatively open area with a few mesquite and cedar trees
and short grasses.
41PP415 is a historic oil and gas-related site containing
cultural material dating to the early 1900s. Based on historic
maps and records, W.K. Gordon’s Oil Well No. 1 was struck
in this vicinity in 1915. This site may be the location of that
well. The site is located on a flat span of ground between
FM 2372 on the north and Turkey Hill on the south. The
site appears to have been cleared prior to 1915, since the
scattered trees at the site are younger than 1915 in age.
FM 2372 was a small unimproved road in circa 1915. No
intrusive features were observed.
The site contains one feature, a ring of five cedar posts
(Figure 5.84). The posts are located near the center of the
site and are indicative of historic oil and gas occupation.
Near the posts is a concentration of broken red brick, some
of which is Thurber brick. Nearby are artifacts related to
the oil and gas industry, including braided wire and an
anchored cable stay. In various locations across the site are
other historic-age artifacts including sheet metal, charred
wood, round nails, purple and teal glass fragments, a clear

One negative shovel test (AY33) was excavated in the site
area. Shovel testing revealed shallow and compact clay
and silt loam with abundant limestone gravels terminating
at 30 cmbs due to compact soils and impassable gravels

William Knox Gordon was a prominent regional figure.
His 1915 discovery of oil in Palo Pinto County ultimately
led to the vast oil and gas development that characterized
west/central Texas in the 1920s. His Oil Well No. 1, where
he first struck oil, would be in important historic site and
would have interpretive value. Therefore, the site’s NRHP
eligibility and SAL designation status remains undetermined
pending further work. Further archival investigations are
recommended to determine if this site may be the location
of Oil Well No. 1. Avoidance is recommended until the site
can be fully evaluated. Finally, as a precautionary measure,
routine monitoring is recommended to protect against
erosion, vandalism, and possible looting.

Site 41Se319
Site 41SE319 is a disturbed, surficial historic earlytwentieth-century site containing 10 features and associated
artifact scatters. The site is located within the park along
the north boundary approximately 2.53 miles west of where
FM2372 terminates at Tucker Lake (Figure 5.85; Appendix
C.8). This site is located in a moderately vegetated area with
mesquite, cedar, and short grasses.

101

The site contains 10 features along with extensive historic
artifact scatter. The features include: two earthen berms,
one terraced path, one concrete foundation, four areas
containing concrete foundation footings, one dense cluster
of bricks with possible footers, and one area with numerous
brick foundation footings that likely contained several small
buildings in close proximity. In addition to the features, the
site contains a large amount of historic artifacts related to
the railroad siding. The artifacts include: metal fragments,
a battery cable, telegraph poles, telegraph wire insulators,
copper wire, braided cable, ceramic chimney pipes, broken
bricks, chunks of burned coal and hardened tar, hardened
cement bags, lumber fragments, a barrel hoop, a hinge, a
pail handle, broken pottery, sheet metal scraps, a vehicle air
filter, a flattened stovepipe, a tin can, bolts, a nail, a rivet,
a link of chain, a possible engine valve/piston, and blue,
purple and clear glass fragments.
Feature 1 is an earthen berm that parallels the railroad tracks
for a short distance. It appears to have the height and shape
necessary for use as a loading dock or similar.
Feature 2 is a concrete and rock foundation located near
the railroad tracks (Figure 5.86). The low foundation is
at ground level and is partially buried and obscured by
overgrowth and measures approximately 16 by 20 feet.
Feature 3 is a collection of several concrete foundation
footings found near pieces of broken ceramic chimney pipe,
bricks, and braided cable. The footings are approximately
a foot square and extend 2 inches above ground.
Feature 4 is a group of several concrete footings that are
level with the ground and partially buried with dirt and
grasses. The footings are rounded and irregular in shape.

Site 41SE319 is situated immediately south of and adjacent
to the Texas and Pacific Railroad tracks that run in a
northwest to southeast direction. The site is long and narrow
and parallels the tracks for approximately 0.5 mile. A twotrack road runs through the site and roughly follows the
tracks. Features and artifacts were found on both sides of
the road. The ground is both flat and gently sloped. There
are no intrusive features, the two-track road and railroad at
the site would have been there in the early 1900s.

Feature 5 is a collection of several concrete footings located
alongside a brick scatter. The footings extend several inches
above ground. The most intact footing measures more than
1 foot by 1 foot in size. The other footings are broken or
deteriorated.

This site is the likely location of the Wiles Siding, a railroad
siding and associated community built in circa 1915. A
2-acre parcel was deeded to the Texas and Pacific Railway
Company for use as a siding in circa 1915. By the early
1920s, a small community known as Wiles was established
and contained houses, a grocery, and a train station. This
site is believed to be the remains of that community.
Approximately 1 mile east of this site are ruins likely
associated with the Pierce Oil Company, including oil and
gas storage facilities, housing areas, and a rail spur (Site
41SE320).

Feature 7 is a long, earthen berm located in the southern
end of the site (Figure 5.87). It rises 2 to 3 feet with a
gentle slope. The berm is at least 100 meters long; dense
overgrowth at is western end blocked further survey.

Feature 6 is a group of several small, overgrown concrete
footings located near pieces of lumber, metal scraps, and
broken Thurber brick.

Feature 8 is a large concentration of brick footings
containing at least 13 individual footers and numerous
bricks, broken bricks, and concrete chunks. The brick
footings vary in size and are located very near one another.
This indicates that the area likely contained several small

buildings in close proximity. Several of the footings have
bushes or grasses partially obscuring them.
Feature 9 is a large brick scatter located near the railroad
tracks in the northwestern corner of the site. It appears to
have been the location of several small buildings.
Feature 10 is a short, terraced path located in the
northwestern corner of the site (Figure 5.88). The footpath
appears to have provided access to the structures once
located at Feature 9. The path is cut into the side of the hill
and partially outlined with a border of large rocks.

Feature 7 at 41SE319.

SWCA recommends further research to determine if this site
is in fact the ghost town of the historic Wiles community.
Wiles served as shipping hub for the various oil and gas
operations located in the vicinity and as such may have
significance. The NRHP-eligibility status of site 41SE319
is currently undetermined until additional work is able to
fully assess its significance. Based on the presence of several
large historic structural features within a public park, it is
considered a likely target of vandalism or relic collecting;
therefore, SWCA recommends that the site is eligible for
designation as an SAL. Further investigations may reveal
that the site also meets other criteria for SAL designation.
Finally, as a precautionary measure, routine monitoring is
recommended to protect against erosion, vandalism, and
looting.

Site 41Se320
41SE320 is an early twentieth-century oil and gas site
located approximately 1.3 miles west of where FM 2372
terminates at Tucker Lake (Figure 5.89; Appendix C.7). The
site is located outside the park, approximately 85 feet north
of the current park boundary. It is situated immediately north
of, and adjacent to, the Texas and Pacific Railroad tracks.
The site is located in a moderately vegetated area with
mesquite, cedar, and short grasses. A tributary of Palo Pinto
Creek winds through the site in a north to south direction.

Feature 10 at 41SE319.

This site is the likely location of the Pierce camp, an oil and
gas operation located in the historic railroad community
of Wiles. Wiles was a railroad siding and associated
community built in circa 1915 when a 2-acre parcel was
deeded to the Texas and Pacific Railway Company for use
as a siding. By the early 1920s, a small community known
as Wiles was established and contained houses, a grocery,
and a train station, as well as the oil operations of the Pierce

Oil Company. The Pierce camp is known to have contained
a railroad spur, worker housing, a warehouse or train station,
and other oil and gas-related structures. This site is believed
to be the remains of that oil camp. Approximately 1 mile
west of this site are ruins likely associated with the Wiles
siding, including building foundations and historic artifact
scatter (Site 41SE319).
Field investigations documented many features and artifacts
at Site 41SE320, including a large rectangular foundation
situated alongside railroad crossties; multiple concrete oil
tank supports, consisting of elevated piers with curved tops;
several perimeter-wall foundations; numerous concrete
foundation footings; braided wire and cable anchors; sites
with evidence of past clearing and leveling; and a large
number of historic artifacts such as pottery, glass, enameled
metal cookware, nails, shingles, cedar posts, metal scraps,
barrel hoops, wire fencing, hinges, and brick fragments. In
general, the area west of the tributary has a sparse collection
of foundations and artifacts. The flat plain east of the
tributary contains the highest concentration of resources
and the most resources related to the oil and gas industry.
North of this, on a low hill, are several cleared and leveled
home sites that contain a scattering of domestic artifacts.
Feature 1 is a large perimeter wall foundation and railroad
spur located at the western end of the site (Figure 5.90). It
is located roughly 37 meters north of the railroad tracks.
The foundation measures approximately 26.5 m by 12.5 m
and is oriented with its long side facing the railroad tracks.
The foundation wall is constructed from board-formed
concrete and is several feet tall and several inches thick.
In the center of the foundation are several blocky concrete
footers with metal anchors attached. On the ground in front
of the foundation are numerous partially buried railroad
crossties, evidence of a spur track that ran in front of the
building (Figure 5.91). Surrounding the foundation and spur

line are artifacts such as brick fragments, hollow clay tile
fragments, metal scraps, wire, and a hinge. The foundation
likely belonged to a train station or warehouse.
Feature 2 is a collection of concrete foundation footings
located just west of the tributary. Five of the footings are
roughly square in shape and contain metal anchors or
evidence of anchors. One of the footings is a large concrete
block that may have been used as a step or other support.
Nearby is a square concrete block with the stub of a round
metal pole.
Feature 3 is a collection of concrete tank supports located
in the eastern portion of the site, approximately 53 meters
north of the railroad tracks. At this location are numerous
square concrete blocks or footers, each 1 to 2 feet in height
and each containing a metal anchor rod in its center. In a
treeless clearing are two rows of four tall, curved concrete
tank supports that are 3 to 5 feet in height (Figure 5.92).
These fin-like, vertical concrete slabs have a concave
curve at one end and a slightly curved lip near the other
end. The row of four supports would have supported a
large cylindrical oil or gas tank. In front of each row of
concrete supports is a row of square concrete blocks or
footers, which likely supported a wooden ramp or other
structure to help facilitate the loading of the tank onto a
truck. Also found at the site is at least one smaller tank
support with a semicircular notch. Interestingly, a similar
feature is present at site 41PP391 located at the eastern end
of PPMSP (discussed above) and these features may have
been associated with that site.
Feature 4 is a dense cluster of foundations and oil tank
supports that covers an area approximately 0.5 acre in size.
Within the cluster are the following resources: four low
perimeter-wall foundations, each with raised concrete slabs
or footings in its interior (Figures 5.93 and 5.94); a large

that may have supported an animal pen.

Feature 5 is a residential area located on a low hillside in
the northeast portion of the site. The area is dotted with
cedar and mesquite. Several former home sites are found
in intentionally cleared and leveled patches among the
trees. A variety of historic artifacts are scattered throughout
the home sites. FERRIS, LACLEDE, and Thurber bricks
are found in several locations; some are intact and others
are broken. The other artifacts in the area include: several
enameled metal bowls or pots; a pie plate; numerous

A total of 69 IFs were recorded scattered across the PPMSP.
Forty-three of the IFs (62%) are historic in age while
the remaining 26 (38%) are prehistoric in nature. The
prehistoric IF artifacts include projectile points, chipped
stone tools, and lithic debitage. The historic IFs include
tin cans, fragmented houseware items, railroad debris,
and artifacts associated with oil and gas development and
expansion (Table 5.2).
The historic IFs were observed diffusely scattered on the
surface throughout the PPMSP. The artifacts range in age
from the early to mid-twentieth century; however, many
of the historic IFs are highly fragmented and do not retain
temporally diagnostic characteristics. A variety of tin cans,
including food, beer, and oil cans, were commonly observed
throughout the park. One high profile cone-top beer can
(IF01) was observed and likely dates to the early twentieth
century (Figure 5.96). In addition, fragmented glass and
ceramics were also commonly observed including amethystcolored glass and whiteware fragments. Aqua-colored and
colorless glass insulators were also recovered, some of
which were observed in association with transmission
line poles. One colorless Hemingray 42 glass insulator
(IF36) was observed and represents the short mold variant
commonly produced between 1921 and 1960 (Figure 5.97).

was collected for TPWD curation (Appendix E).
Several IFs associated with early railroad activities and oil
and gas expansion in the area were observed and include
railroad spikes and well pipes and collars. IF56 consists of
a small accumulation of well pipes situated next to a large
sandstone boulder. The side of the boulder contains the
name “Becky” etched into the stone (Figure 5.98). Also,
the remnants of a two-wheeled horse-drawn buggy (IF83)
were also recorded (Figure 5.99). One railroad spike (IF13)
was collected for TPWD curation (Appendix E).
A total of 26 prehistoric-age IFs were observed. The
majority of prehistoric artifacts consist of non-diagnostic
chipped stone tools and lithic debitage. Seven biface
fragments, one modified flake, one utilized flake, and
one uniface were recorded, all of which lack temporally
diagnostic characteristics. One arrow point fragment
(IF22) and one possible dart point fragment (IF45) were
observed and collected for TPWD curation; however, both
tools are highly fragmented and lack temporally diagnostic
characteristics (Appendix E). Two temporally diagnostic
projectile points were also recovered and collected for
TPWD curation (Appendix E). One Darl-like projectile
point (IF08) was recovered from shovel test AY96 and dates
to the Transitional Archaic period (Figure 5.100). Also, a
Late Prehistoric Scallorn arrow point (IF80) was recovered
from the ground surface (Figure 5.101).

iNtroDuctioN
On behalf of TPWD, SWCA conducted an intensive cultural
resources survey of portions of the 4,395-acre PPMSP, lo­
cated in southwestern Palo Pinto County and southeastern
Stephens County, Texas. The investigations examined ap­
proximately 3,400 acres within the park over two phases
(FY13 and FY14) spanning 2013 to 2014 (Figure 6.1). The
goal of this study was to obtain survey-level data on the
presence of cultural properties and materials on lands con­
trolled by TPWD and subsequently address the stewardship
and management of those resources. Specifically, TPWD
sought to identify previously unrecorded cultural resources
and recover specific data that could be used by TPWD for
conservation, planning, and management purposes within
the park. In accordance with these goals, SWCA identified
and inventoried the cultural resources within portions of the
park. All work was done in compliance with the standards
and guidelines of the Antiquities Code of Texas and TPWD
stipulations. The work was conducted under Texas Antiqui­
ties Permit 6558 with Kevin A. Miller serving as Principal
Investigator. The intensive archaeological surveys were
conducted between June 2013 and May 2014.
Investigations included extensive background research, map
and historic aerial imagery reviews, intensive pedestrian
survey of the 3,400 acres, and detailed site documentation.
To guide the investigations and assist in focusing field ef­
forts, the park was separated into low, medium, and high
probability areas. The determination of the probability ar­
eas (discussed in more detail below) was based on several
variables including the density and nature of previously
recorded archaeological sites in the region as well as the
topography, soils, proximity to water, and identified dis­
turbances within the park boundaries. About 28 percent of
the surveyed 3,400 acres was identified as having a high
probability to contain archaeological sites. The remaining
72 percent of the surveyed acreage was evenly divided
(36 percent each) between medium and low probability to
contain archaeological sites.
The intensive survey included a 100 percent walkover of
examined park areas with subsurface explorations in all
probability areas to determine the presence/absence of
archaeological sites and explore their nature. As mandated
by TPWD, the shovel testing intervals were commensu­
rate with the identified probability areas—the intervals of

shovel test excavation increased or decreased depending
upon the probability of archaeological sites. The shovel test
intervals ranged from 30 to 60 m apart in high probability
areas, 60 to 100 m apart in medium probability areas, and
100 to 200 m apart in low probability areas. The intervals
in the PPMSP survey exceed those indicated by the THC.
The THC standards for a project of this size indicate one
shovel test for every 3 acres. For the 3,400 acres surveyed,
this would roughly amount to 1,133 shovel tests.
The intensive survey found that the geologic and environ­
mental setting generally did not warrant testing to this level
due to disturbances, extremely shallow to non-existent sur­
face deposits over bedrock, and upland gravels and bedrock
exposures. In total, 2,512 shovel tests were excavated by
SWCA archaeologists in the 3,400-acre survey area (Ap­
pendix C). SWCA excavated the majority of shovel tests to
an average depth of 10 cm and tests generally terminated
at bedrock or degrading residuum. The excavations in the
lowland areas (e.g., terraces and alluvial fans) were deeper,
extending to beyond 100 cm but still contained scattered
rocky deposits.
Select areas with deeper sediments were backhoe trenched
during the investigations. These mechanical excavations
(n=19) were done to verify the presence of alluvial stratig­
raphy as well as the existence of buried cultural materials
(Figure 6.2). As discussed in Chapter 5, the investigations
did encounter alluvial deposits that most closely correlate
with the occasionally flooded Bosque clay loam that is
mapped for the area (Appendix B). The exceptions to this
were several trenches that had rocky point bar deposits
from the meandering Palo Pinto Creek or rocky colluvial
deposits in trenches closer to the foot slopes. Overall, no
evidence of buried cultural materials was encountered in
the backhoe trench excavations.
The intensive PPMSP field investigations culminated in
the documentation of 40 prehistoric and historic archaeo­
logical sites (41PP389–415 and 41SE308–320) and 69 IFs
(Appendix C). The prehistoric resources include campsites
and lithic scatters containing an assortment of prehistoric
artifacts. Three of the prehistoric sites (11 percent) ap­
pear to contain a prehistoric hearth feature. The feature
on two of these sites (41SE313 and 41PP414) is exposed
and eroding out of a road cut exposure or cut bank profile,
respectively. The temporally diagnostic artifacts suggest ac­
tivities during the Paleoindian (Golondrina or Hoxie), Late

Paleoindian (Early Stemmed Lanceolate), Early Archaic
(Hoxie), Transitional Archaic (Darl), and Late Prehistoric
(Washita and Scallorn) time periods (Turner et al. 2011).
Similarly, the historic resources indicate occupations during
the early to mid-twentieth-century. The historic resources
represent diverse activities including railroad construction
and use, petroleum exploration and extraction, agriculture,
transportation, cedar chopping, and recreation.
Based on the results of intensive inspection and assessment,
eight sites (41PP391–392, 41PP396, 41SE311, 41SE316,
and 41SE318–320) have undetermined NRHP-eligibility,
but due to their exposure to the public (e.g., proximity to
public road and/or presence of large structural features) they
are recommended as eligible for designation as SAL sites
and further work is recommended. Nine sites (41PP395,
41PP399, 41PP403–405, 41PP414–415, 41SE310, and
41SE312) pending further work have an undetermined
eligibility regarding the NRHP and SAL designation
status (see Figure 6.1). Twenty-three archaeological sites
(41PP389–390, 41PP393–394, 41PP397–398, 41PP400–
402, 41PP406–413, 41SE308–309, 41SE313–315, and
41SE317) for various reasons are not recommended for
designation as SAL sites and no further protective measures
are warranted for the sites (see Table 5.1.). Similarly, no
further actions or protective measures are recommended
for the 69 IFs. The temporally diagnostic and unique IFs
have been collected and will be curated.

eValuation oF SWca’S Probability model
As mentioned above, at the onset of the project, SWCA de­
lineated PPMSP into high, medium, and low archaeological
probability areas. The purpose of this was to determine areas
where investigations should be more intensively focused,
with accompanying intensive subsurface examinations.
The determination of the probability areas was based on
numerous variables, including the density and nature of
previously recorded cultural resources in the surrounding
four counties (Stephens, Palo Pinto, Eastland, and Erath).
Other factors including topography, soils, proximity to
water, and disturbances were considered for these cultural
probability areas. In addition, as actual survey data from
2013 investigations was integrated to strengthen the model
and aid determinations of levels of intensity and survey
locales in 2014.
Specifically, for this study, high probability areas were de­
fined as locales that possess or have an elevated likelihood
of containing cultural resources. These areas are generally
identified by documentation, such as historic structures de­
picted on USGS topographic maps, or by distinct landforms
and soil deposits that have been shown in local and regional
surveys to contain archaeological sites. In the 3,400-acre
study area, SWCA identified 933 acres as high potential

areas (see Table 4.1). These included ridge and toe slope
landforms at and adjacent to the river and its tributaries
and the crest of landforms above moderately steep slopes.

model reSultS
Based on the results of the PPMSP survey, a total of 40
archaeological sites were documented. Of these, 60 percent
(n=24) were recorded in high probability areas, 30 percent
(n=12) in moderate probability areas, and 10 percent (n=4)
in low probability areas. Given these results, the model as
calculated appears to accurately predict the potential for
locating archaeological sites within the park boundaries.
These data suggest that the model successfully predicts
areas that are more likely to contain archaeological sites.
Conversely, when looking at the number of shovel tests
excavated throughout the park (n=2,512), only 26 shovel
tests (1 percent) were positive for cultural materials. This
amount of shovel test excavation more than doubles the
recommended amount for a project area of this size by the
THC (i.e., 1,133 shovel tests). Despite these extensive
investigations, only 20 positive shovel tests were located
in high probability areas while the remaining six positive
shovel tests were located in medium probability areas.
No positive shovel tests were located in low probability
areas. Additionally, the 40 recorded archaeological sites
comprise approximately 154.7 acres of the roughly 3,400
acres surveyed. These combined data accounts for 1 acre
of archaeological site per 22 acres surveyed and only one
positive shovel test out of every 100 excavated.
While the results do show that areas of high and medium
probability are more likely to contain archaeological sites,
the ratios of positive to negative shovel tests and total acre­
age archaeological sites to total acreage surveyed suggests
that the model and survey methodology can and should be
adjusted. It appears that the model overestimates the areas
of high and medium probability and underestimates the
amount of low probability areas. As a consequence, the field
investigations could oversaturate an area with unnecessary
shovel tests.
A revision of the model should be undertaken to identify
additional environmental variables that may factor in to the
model for predicting archaeological sites. Additionally the
model, as currently calculated, considers each environmen­
tal variable as contributing equally to the final calculation.
It is possible that some environmental variables contribute
more to the model than others and a more statistically ro­
bust analysis, such as logistic regression may be warranted.
Some possible model revisions could include focusing on
select variables (e.g., proximity to water and soils) in order
to refine the boundaries. Another option includes possibly
omitting previous archaeological site location data from
the model’s formula. Thus far, this metric has tended to be

Summary and Conclusions
superfluous at best or inconclusive at worst. Further, these
data are dependent on where archaeological investigations
have occurred and do not truly represent an accurate account
of where all archaeological sites are located.
Next, considering the level of effort expended in PPMSP
for 20 positive shovel tests, some attention should be put
into revising future field efforts. Previous SWCA investiga­
tions in Colorado Bend State Park had a similar conclusion
in regards to shovel test intervals (Lawrence et al. 2009).
These investigations determined that shovel testing was
not necessary on the vast majority of the project area due
to the prevalent shallow soils. As a consequence, the rec­
ommendations proposed fewer broadly scattered shovel
tests and instead concentrate on examining the surface and
selectively excavating in areas with actual, demonstrable
soils (Lawrence et al. 2009).
The overwhelming conclusion that should be derived from
the PPMSP data is that selective “targeted” shovel test
excavations are more successful than systematic routine
coverage. Put another way, selective, judgmentally fo­
cused excavations are more informative than excavations
methodically placed on a landscape. Accordingly, SWCA
recommends to the THC that future investigations in
PPMSP should expand the expected shovel test intervals.
Specifically, the shovel test intervals should be minimally
increased to roughly 60 to 100 m apart in high probability
areas, 100 to 200 m apart in medium probability areas, and
up to 200 to 300 m apart in defined low probability areas.
Understandably, these intervals should be revisited when
applied to areas outside of PPMSP. However, more than 75
percent of PPMSP has now been investigated and these rec­
ommended intervals would adequately investigate the park.

Future reSearch
In addition to the revisions discussed above, future inves­
tigations within PPMSP are recommended. Clearly the
remaining areas within PPMSP are recommended for inten­
sive archaeological investigations (see Figure 1.3). These
areas are located on the extreme western end of PPMSP
and are primarily high and medium probability areas (see
Figures 4.1 and 4.2). SWCA recommends that these areas
are examined with the amended methods proposed above.
Also recommended in PPMSP are concentrated backhoe
trench investigations. A considerable amount of areas
evaluated in PPMSP have been identified as warranting
mechanical investigations (see Figure 6.2). These areas
have deposits that correlate with the occasionally flooded
Bosque clay loam, which are identified as similar to Berg­
strom, Frio, Oakalla, and Venus series (NRCS 2014). Abbott
(2011:16–23) identifies that the Frio and Venus series have
a high to very high geoarchaeological potential for contain­
ing intact archaeological sites to greater than 1 m in depth.

117

Although Abbott (2011) does not mention the Bosque series,
the setting and characterization of the Frio and Venus series
is comparable to the deposits in PPMSP. Of note, the Palo
Pinto Creek does appear to have a dynamic history with
lateral migration and erosion (see Figure 1.8). However,
there are large, seemingly intact areas in PPMSP that have
prominent aggradational meander bends that could contain
substantial low energy alluvial deposits (see Figures 5.4 and
5.5). In particular, the terraces along the relict channel of
Palo Pinto Creek do contain archaeological sites (41PP395
and 41PP399) and other cultural resources may be buried
beyond the depth that shovel test excavations could achieve
(see Figure 5.3). Future work in PPMSP should include
systematic backhoe trenching in these areas (see Figure 6.2).
Finally, the investigations in PPMSP and the extensive
archival data have demonstrated that the park has a rich,
diverse, and intriguing history. Future investigations associ­
ated with the park should include targeted archival research.
Some specific recommended research includes a review
of local library microfiche and an examination of the Nita
Stewart Haley Museum in Midland, Texas. An intensive
review of local library microfiche might provide newspaper
accounts of the Wiles Siding, Pierce Camp, details of the
cedar chopping industry, as well as other as yet unidentified
historic activities in PPMSP. The Nita Stewart Haley Mu­
seum in Midland, Texas, contains the Miles Hart collection
that could contain files on W. K. Gordon and Gordon’s Well
No. 1 in addition to the railroad passing through the park.
Some general historic research could focus on where the
road from Ranger to Strawn went after it exited PPMSP.
Currently, the likely location of this historic route exited the
park near 41SE314. This area is on privately owned property
and could not be explored. However, investigations in the
future may be able to gain access to the area and ground
truth the historic route.

HISTORIC MAP REVIEW

Appendix d

Historic MAp review
Mary Jo Galindo
SWCA conducted a background review, intensive historical
research, and archival studies for the Palo Pinto Mountains
State Park (PPMSP) project to help reconstruct the park
history and understand the archaeological record. These
investigations involved the exploration of the history
of Tucker Lake, the Union Pacific Railroad, and related
facilities on or adjacent to park lands. A discussion of the
results of the background review and historical research is
presented in detail in Chapter 3. In addition to this research,
historic maps for the PPMSP project area were obtained and
assessed for potential above-ground cultural resources and
to review land modifications to the project area over time.

MetHodology
To conduct this review, SWCA utilized the Texas
Department of Transportation (TxDOT) Historic Overlay,
a mapping/geographic information system with historic
maps and resource information covering most portions of
the state (Foster et al. 2006). In addition to these sources,
SWCA obtained historic aerial photographs of the project
area from The Banks Group to review the general history
of development in the project area.

results
TxDOT HisTOric Overlay
Seven maps from the TxDOT Historic Overlay, dating
to 1867–1931, were reviewed for PPMSP (Foster et al.
2006). The earliest is Holtz’s map of Texas, which labels
present-day Stephens County, as “Buchanan” County and
depicts the park just north of a line of hills (Figure D-1).
This map contains no other details for the park. The 1890
Breckenridge U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) topographic
quadrangle map illustrates a road and the Texas and Pacific
Railroad (T&PRR) along the northern park boundary; and
the confluence of Palo Pinto Creek and the ephemeral
Russell Creek within the park (Figure D-2). At the eastern
margin of the park is a formation labeled, “Evensville Peak,”
and a north-south oriented road is shown intersecting the
previously mentioned one.
The railroad is also depicted in the 1907 Postal Route map
of Texas, except it is labeled the “Central Texas” Railroad
(Figure D-3). This map yields no other information for the
park. The 1918 map of central Texas oil fields labels the
railroad “T&PRR” and places most of the park within both

the Strawn and Ranger oil fields (Figure D-4). Likewise,
the 1920 map of north central Texas by the Geological
Petroleum Corporation depicts the western two-thirds of the
park as an area with oil-producing geology (Figure D-5).
Three oil or gas wells appear within the park boundaries
in the 1927 USGS map of Texas oil and gas fields (Figure
D-6). Finally, the 1931 Federal Highway System map was
reviewed, but did not contain any further details for the
park (Figure D-7).

HisTOric aerial PHOTOgraPHy
SWCA reviewed a series of historic aerial photography for
PPMSP obtained from the Banks Group that spanned from
1947 to 2012. The earliest aerials depict Tucker Lake and
some cleared areas with roads leading to them, including
the locales of sites 41PP389 and 41PP393 (Figure D-8).
Alternatively, site 41SE312 is in a wooded area. By 1953,
the entire park, except southwest of the lake, exhibits more
vegetation clearing (Figure D-9). The locale of site 41PP391
is clear for the first time, while the cleared area around
site 41PP389 has become expansive. Vegetation around
sites 41PP393 and 41SE312 is about the same as in 1947.
Nearly the entire park has been cleared of vegetation by
1966, even around site 41SE312, although a wooded area
remains southwest of the lake (Figure D-10).
In 1973, sparse vegetation continues across the majority
of the park, with thicker riparian vegetation now evident
(Figure D-11). Site 41PP392 occupies a wooded area,
while sites 41PP389, 41PP391, 41PP393, and 41SE312 are
cleared. Stock tanks are apparent in the southeast corner of
the park. Vegetation conditions appear much the same in
1983, with increasing riparian growth, even at site 41SE312
(Figure D-12). By 1996, vegetation is increasing overall,
and has almost reached pre-1966 era levels (Figure D-13).
More stock tanks are evident in the eastern third of the park.
In 2004, sites that straddle Palo Pinto Creek; including
sites 41SE308, 41SE309, and 41SE312; are densely
wooded; while sites 41PP389, 41PP391, and 41PP393 are
cleared (Figure D-14). Vegetation across the entire park is
increasing and numerous stock tanks are found throughout.
Four years later, the overall vegetation continues to thicken,
but some areas, like those in the vicinity of sites 41SE308,
41SE309, 41SE311, and 41SE314, are now fairly open with
