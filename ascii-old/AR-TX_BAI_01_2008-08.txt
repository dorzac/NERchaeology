MANAGEMENT SUMMARY
PROJECT TITLE: Archeological Survey of US 277 at Fish Creek in Nolan County, Texas.
PROJECT DESCRIPTION: The project involved an archeological records review and an intensive 100
percent archeological survey with backhoe trenching prior to proposed roadway and bridge improvements
on US 277 at Fish Creek (CSJ: 0407-03-010). Investigations occurred within the existing US 277 rightof-way and involved surface examination and the excavation of four backhoe trenches within the project
area. The survey discovered no archeological materials.
The existing US 277 right-of-way at Fish Creek is 100 feet wide and contains a 42-foot wide roadway
consisting of two 12-foot wide lanes and two 9-foot wide shoulders. The proposed construction would
widen the roadway to 44 feet with two 12-foot wide lanes and 10-foot shoulders. The existing bridge at
Fish Creek is 170 feet long, 44 feet wide, and contains a 42-foot wide roadway with two 12-foot wide
lanes and two 9-foot wide shoulders. The proposed bridge would be 170 feet long, 46 feet wide, and have
a 44-foot wide roadway with two 12-foot wide lanes and two 10-foot wide shoulders. The depth of
vertical construction impacts would extend a maximum of 25 feet below ground surface for bridge
support columns and less than one foot for the approach roadways. The overall Area of Potential Effect
for this project is 600 feet long, 100 feet wide, encompasses roughly 1.4 acres, and extends a maximum of
25 feet below ground surface for bridge columns.
PROJECT LOCATION: The project area is located on the Church Peak, Texas USGS 7.5-minute
topographic quadrangle.
TOTAL ACREAGE: Approximately 1.4 acres (0.57 hectares).
DATE OF WORK: 26 February 2008.
PURPOSE OF WORK: Blanton & Associates, Inc. is assisting the project sponsor in their compliance
with Section 106 of the National Historic Preservation Act of 1966 (and subsequent amendments) and the
Antiquities Code of Texas.
PRINCIPAL INVESTIGATOR: Brandon S. Young
TEXAS ANTIQUITIES PERMIT NUMBER: 4818
NEWLY RECORDED SITES: None.
PREVIOUSLY RECORDED SITES: None
COMMENTS: Given the lack of archeological deposits within the project area, it is the opinion of
Blanton & Associates, Inc., that there is little to no potential for the Area of Potential Effect to contain
previously unidentified archeological historic properties (36 CFR 800.16[1]) or SALs (13 TAC 26.12).
Blanton & Associates, Inc. recommends therefore that the proposed construction should not affect any
archeological historic properties pursuant to 36 CFR 800.4(d) or SALs.

INTRODUCTION
On February 26, 2008 archeologists from Blanton & Associates, Inc. (B&A) conducted an intensive noncollection archeological survey with backhoe trenching in the existing US 277 right-of-way (ROW) at
Fish Creek in Nolan County, Texas (CSJ: 0407-03-010) (Figures 1 and 2). The survey was performed at
the request of the Texas Department of Transportation’s (TxDOT) Abilene District prior to proposed
bridge replacement and roadway improvement construction.
The existing ROW at Fish Creek is 100 feet wide and contains a 42-foot wide roadway consisting of two
12-foot wide lanes and two 9-foot wide shoulders (Figure 3). The proposed construction would widen the
roadway to 44 feet to accommodate the addition of railing on either side of the roadway approaches and
contain two 12-foot wide lanes and 10-foot shoulders. The existing bridge at Fish Creek is 170 feet long,
44 feet wide, and contains a 42-foot wide roadway with two 12-foot wide lanes and two 9-foot wide
shoulders. The proposed bridge would be 170 feet long, 46 feet wide, and have a 44-foot wide roadway
with two 12-foot wide lanes and two 10-foot wide shoulders (Figure 4). The depth of vertical construction
impacts would extend 20 to 25 feet below ground surface for bridge support columns and less than one
foot for the approach roadways. No new ROW or temporary or permanent easements are planned for the
proposed construction, though a temporary detour within the ROW will be necessary. The overall Area of
Potential Effect (APE) for this project is therefore 600 feet long, 100 feet wide, encompasses roughly 1.4
acres, and extends a maximum 30 feet below ground surface for bridge columns.
As the planned construction would occur on property owned by the State of Texas and administered by
TxDOT, the project is subject to the provisions of the Antiquities Code of Texas (ACT), now subsumed
in Title 13, Part II of the Texas Administrative Code. This legislation defines the necessary conditions for
recognition and preservation of State Archeological Landmarks (SALs) and requires that any political
subdivision of the State of Texas, defined as a “local governmental entity created and operating under the
laws of this state, including a city, county, school district, or special district created under the Texas
Constitution, Article III, §52(b)(1) or (2), or Article XVI, §59” in 13 TAC §26.5 of the code, must
identify potential SALs through survey of public lands prior to actions that could potentially damage
those SALs. Surveys must be conducted under a Texas Antiquities Permit (TAP) issued by the Texas
Historical Commission (THC) in accordance with the provisions of the code. Investigations were
conducted under TAP No. 4818 issued to Principal Investigator Brandon S. Young.
It is assumed that funding for the proposed highway construction will come in part from the Federal
Highway Administration (FHWA) and, as such, the proposed construction project is also subject to the
provisions of Section 106 of the National Historic Preservation Act of 1966 (NHPA). The intent of the
NHPA is to consider the effects an undertaking may have on archeological historic properties that might
be threatened by actions that are federally funded or permitted, or which occur on federal property. The
act, which created the National Register of Historic Places (NRHP) and the Advisory Council for Historic
Preservation (ACHP), states that the ACHP must be afforded the chance to comment when any cultural
resources eligible for inclusion on the NRHP are present in an area affected by federal agency actions or
actions funded or permitted by federal agencies.

Protection of cultural resources under federal law is tied to eligibility for the NRHP as per criteria defined
by the National Park Service (NPS) rules 36 CFR 60. Protection of archeological sites under state law is
tied to eligibility for formal SAL status pursuant to 13 TAC 26.8. Federal and state review of this project
will occur pursuant to the First Programmatic Agreement (PA) among the FHWA, TxDOT, THC, and the
ACHP Regarding the Implementation of Transportation Undertakings, as well as the Memorandum of
Understanding (MOU) between TxDOT and THC. Field investigations were also conducted in
accordance with the PA and MOU.
The survey was designed to comply with appropriate archeological survey methods as defined in the
Department of the Interior's Standards and Guidelines (NPS 1983), the Guidelines of the Council of
Texas Archeologists (1987), and survey standards developed by the THC in conjunction with the Council
of Texas Archeologists (THC n.d.). The primary intent of the survey was to identify and describe all
cultural resources discovered within the APE, evaluate their potential eligibility for nomination to the
NRHP or for formal SAL designation, and should significant cultural resources be located, make
recommendations for future cultural resource management options such as avoidance, preservation, or
further investigations.

ENVIRONMENTAL SETTING
This project area is located in the Rolling Plains ecological region of Texas, which is characterized by a
gently undulating to rolling plain. Elevations across the Rolling Plains rang from approximately
1,000 feet in the eastern margins of the region to 2,200 feet at the base of the Cap Rock Escarpment on
the region’s western edges (Jordan et al. 1984). Adjacent land use consists of undeveloped range and
ranches.
GEOLOGY AND SOILS
The APE contains Holocene alluvium consisting of clay, silt, and sand as floodplain and low terrace
deposits (Barnes 1972). Soils in the project area consist of Colorado loam, frequently flooded, that formed
in deep calcareous alluvium. A representative profile exhibits reddish brown loam from 0 to 8 inches
below ground surface (A horizon) overlying two light reddish brown C (C1 and C2) horizons between 8
and 64 inches below ground surface (Lowther 1981).
FLORA
Nolan County lies in the Kansan biotic province (Blair 1950). Vegetation is a mixed-grass plain
dominated by little bluestem (Schizachyrium scoparium), big bluestem (Andropogon gerardii) and
western wheatgrass (Agropyron Smithii). A juniper-grass association dominated by juniper (Juniperus
ashei) with various species of grama (Bouteloua spp.), three-awn (Aristida spp.) and broomweed
(Gutierrezia texana) is common. Bermuda grass (Cynodon dactylon), perennial rye grass (Lolium
perenne), greenbriar (Smilax sp.), and gourd (Cucurbita sp.) are common in the existing US 277 ROW.
Trees identified in the APE include sugar hackberry (Celtis laevigata), post oak (Quercus stellata), and
black willow (Salix nigra).

METHODS
Prior to field investigations, a review of records at the Texas Archeological Research Laboratory (TARL)
and data available on the THC’s online Texas Archeological Sites Atlas (TASA) found no previously
recorded archeological sites or project areas within a 1,000-meter search radius around the APE.
The intensive non-collection archeological survey involved surface and subsurface investigations of
sufficient intensity to determine the nature, extent, and if possible, the significance of any discovered
cultural resources. Investigations adhered to THC survey standards (n.d.), as well as the guidelines of the
Council of Texas Archeologists (1987) and the Secretary of the Interior’s Standards and Guidelines (NPS
1983). Moreover, the survey was designed and executed in accordance with the PA among the FHWA,
the THC, the ACHP, and TxDOT, as well as the MOU between TxDOT and the THC.
Surface investigations consisted of a 100 percent pedestrian survey of the US 277 ROW by two
archeologists systematically examining the ground surface for cultural remains. Where available, cutbank
profiles along Fish Creek were inspected for the presence of any buried cultural materials. Field
investigations were thoroughly documented with digital cameras and no cultural materials were collected.
Curation was unnecessary.
Subsurface investigations involved the excavation of four backhoe trenches (BHTs). Excavated backhoe
trenches were approximately four meters (13 feet) long, one meter (3.3 feet) wide, and 1.5 meters (4.9
feet) deep. Following trench excavations, the archeologists cleaned and examine trench walls to locate
any in situ artifacts, features, and/or soil anomalies in the trench profiles. Stratigraphic units in each
trench were recorded and described in detail, including a photographic record, on a Blanton & Associates
geologic profile form. Backhoe trench locations were plotted with hand-held GPS receivers for accurate
mapping.

RESULTS OF INVESTIGATIONS
US 277 at Fish Creek is surrounded by undeveloped range and the existing ROW appears relatively intact
(with the exception of previous roadway and bridge construction), as there are no buried utilities within
the existing ROW (Figure 5). However, there is a heavily eroded buried waterline easement on private
property adjacent to the northeast quadrant of the creek crossing.
Surface investigations found no prehistoric or historic archeological materials. Subsurface investigations
involved the inspection of cutbanks along Fish Creek, as well as the eroded area outside of, but
immediately adjacent to, the northeast quadrant of the APE (Figures 6 and 7). Areas outside of the ROW
were visually inspected only from the approved APE. Additional subsurface investigations included the
excavation of four BHTs—one in each quadrant of the creek crossing.
BHTs 1, 2, and 4 exhibited four to five soil zones. From top to bottom, these include one disturbed
construction fill zone extending to depths between 61 and 96 centimeters below the ground surface and
consisting of compacted, intermixed caliche, clay, sandy loam, and pea gravel above two or three zones of
sand and clay loam overlying sandy clay (Figure 8 and Appendix A). BHTs 1 and 2 were located,
respectively, in the northeast and northwest quadrants while BHT 4 was excavated in the southeast
quadrant of the stream crossing. In the southwest quadrant of the APE, BHT 3 revealed only three soil
zones, the uppermost of which consisted of construction fill that extended from 0 to 96 centimeters below
ground surface (Figure 9). No archeological material was discovered during trench excavations.

SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS
Intensive survey efforts found no archeological resources on US 277 at Fish Creek. Backhoe trenching
revealed construction fill overlying partially intact to intact loamy or clay subsoil. Given the negative
results of surface and subsurface investigations, it is the opinion of B&A there is little to no potential for
the APE to contain previously unidentified archeological historic properties (36 CFR 800.16[1]) or SALs
(13 TAC 26.12). B&A recommends therefore that because no archeological deposits were discovered
within the APE the proposed construction should not affect any archeological historic properties pursuant
to 36 CFR 800.4(d) or SALs.
If it is determined that the planned construction requires impacts to occur beyond the existing ROW, then
additional investigations in those areas would be necessary given the apparent intactness of the stream
terraces outside the US 277 ROW. In the event that previously unidentified archeological deposits are
discovered during construction, all activity in the immediate area of the discovery should cease
immediately and the TxDOT archeological staff should be contacted to initiate accidental discovery
procedures in accordance with the aforementioned PA and MOU.
