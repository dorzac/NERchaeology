MANAGEMENT SUMMARY

During the months of October and November 2007, Horizon Environmental Services,
Inc. (Horizon) archeologists conducted an intensive cultural resources survey of 4 horizontal
direction drill (HDD) bore entry/exit locations along Pecan Pipeline Company’s (PPC) proposed
Palo Pinto 20-inch natural gas pipeline right-of-way (ROW) in east-central Palo Pinto County,
Texas. Two of the HDD locations will be utilized to install a segment of the proposed pipeline
underneath the Brazos River, while the other 2 will be used to install segments of it underneath
Keechi Creek. Each of the 4 HDD locations measured approximately 30.5 by 30.5 meters (m)
(100.0 by 100.0 feet) or 0.2 acres. In all, the 4 HDD locations total 0.8 acres. Although the
HDD locations are located on private property and the undertaking is privately funded, Horizon
conducted the survey as part of PPC’s due diligence process in compliance with Section 106 of
the National Historic Preservation Act (NHPA) of 1966, as amended. The purpose of the survey
was to identify any cultural resources within the boundaries of the proposed HDD bore entry/exit
locations and, if any existed, to assess their eligibility for inclusion in the National Register of
Historic Places (NRHP).
In addition to the 4 HDD locations, the Horizon crew also assessed 2 segments of the
proposed pipeline ROW that pass near 2 previously recorded archeological sites (41PP178 and
41PP186). Although these segments are also on private property and require no federal
permits for construction, PPC also requested an assessment of these segments as part of its
due diligence process in order to route the pipeline alignment around these sites if their deposits
extended into the ROW. The survey of these 2 segments covered approximately 1.5 acres. In
all, the HDD locations and 2 segments of ROW total approximately 2.3 acres.
The survey resulted in entirely negative findings. No cultural material was observed
during the surface inspection or within any of the shovel tests excavated on the proposed HDD
locations. Similarly, no cultural deposits were encountered within the proposed ROW where it
passes near sites 41PP178 and 41PP186. Based on the negative results of the survey, it is
Horizon’s opinion that no significant cultural resources will be impacted by the proposed HDD
activities associated with the proposed Palo Pinto 20-inch natural gas pipeline or via the pipeline
installation in the vicinity of site 41PP178 and 41PP186. Horizon recommends that cultural
resources clearance be granted for the pipeline construction at these locations. However, in the
unlikely event that any cultural materials (including human remains or burial features) are
inadvertently discovered at any point during construction, use, or ongoing maintenance of the

1.0 INTRODUCTION

This document reports the results of an intensive cultural resources survey of 4
horizontal direction drill (HDD) bore entry/exit locations along Pecan Pipeline Company’s (PPC)
proposed Palo Pinto 20-inch natural gas pipeline right-of-way (ROW) in east central Palo Pinto
County, Texas (Figures 1 and 2). Two of the HDD locations will be utilized to install a segment
of the proposed pipeline underneath the Brazos River, while the other 2 will be used to install
segments of it underneath Keechi Creek. Each of the 4 HDD locations measured approximately
30.5 by 30.5 meters (m) (100.0 by 100.0 feet) or 0.2 acres. In all, the 4 HDD locations total 0.8
acres. Although the HDD locations are located on private property and the undertaking is
privately funded, Horizon Environmental Services, Inc. (Horizon) conducted the survey as part
of PPC’s due diligence process in compliance with Section 106 of the National Historic
Preservation Act (NHPA) of 1966, as amended. The purpose of the survey was to identify any
cultural resources within the boundaries of the proposed HDD bore entry/exit locations and, if
any existed, to assess their eligibility for inclusion in the National Register of Historic Places
(NRHP).
In addition to the 4 HDD locations, Horizon also assessed 2 segments of the proposed
pipeline ROW that pass near 2 previously recorded archeological sites (41PP178 and 41PP186)
(Figures 1 and 2). Although these segments are also on private property and require no federal
permits for construction, PPC also requested an assessment of these segments as part of its
due diligence process in order to route the pipeline alignment around these sites if their deposits
extended into the ROW. The survey of these 2 segments covered approximately 1.5 acres. In
all, the HDD locations and 2 segments of ROW total approximately 2.3 acres.
The cultural resources investigation consisted of an archival review, a pedestrian survey
of the proposed HDD locations and ROW segments near the previously recorded archeological
sites, and the production of a report suitable for review by the State Historic Preservation Officer
(SHPO) in accordance with the Texas Historical Commission’s (THC) Rules of Practice and
Procedure, Chapter 26, Section 27, and the Council of Texas Archeologists’ (CTA) Guidelines
for Cultural Resources Management Reports. Russell Brownlow (Horizon’s cultural resources
director) served as the Principal Investigator for the investigations. Reign Clark (Horizon project
archeologist) supervised the field crew composed of Jared Wiersema and Michael Mudd
(Horizon field technicians). The investigations were conducted in October and November 2007.

Chapter 1.0: Introduction

The field effort consisted of both intensive surface inspection and subsurface shovel
testing. The Texas State Minimum Archeological Survey Standards (TSMASS) require a
minimum of 2 shovel tests per acre on projects between 2 and 10 acres in size. As each of the
4 HDD locations consisted of an area totaling only 0.2 acres in size (0.8 acres total), and the
segments of the ROW near the previously recorded archeological sites totaled 1.5 acres (2.3
acres combined total), a total of 5 shovel tests were necessary in order to comply with the
TSMASS. Horizon exceeded the minimum requirements by excavating a total of 30 shovel
tests. All shovel tests were excavated to a depth of 100 centimeters below surface (cmbs) (40.0
inches) or to sterile clay or bedrock, whichever was encountered first.
The survey resulted in entirely negative findings. No cultural material was observed
during the surface inspection or within any of the shovel tests excavated on the proposed HDD
locations. Similarly, no cultural deposits were encountered within the proposed ROW where it
passes near sites 41PP178 and 41PP186. Based on the negative results of the survey, it is
Horizon’s opinion that no significant cultural resources will be impacted by the proposed HDD
activities associated with the proposed Palo Pinto 20-inch natural gas pipeline or via the pipeline
installation in the vicinity of site 41PP178 and 41PP186. Horizon recommends that cultural
resources clearance be granted for the pipeline construction at these locations. However, in the
unlikely event that any cultural materials (including human remains or burial features) are
inadvertently discovered at any point during construction, use, or ongoing maintenance of the
ROW, even in previously surveyed areas, all work should cease immediately and the Texas
Historical Commission (THC) should be notified of the discovery.

2.0 PROJECT AREA DESCRIPTION

The Project Area consists of 4 HDD bore entry/exit locations along PPC’s proposed Palo
Pinto 20-inch natural gas pipeline ROW in east central Palo Pinto County, Texas. Two of these
HDD locations are found on opposing banks of Keechi Creek just north of where it confluences
with the Brazos River, north of Hart Bend, on the US Geological Survey (USGS) 7.5’ Mineral
Wells West, Texas, topographic quadrangle (see Figure 1). The other 2 HDD locations are
situated on opposing banks of the Brazos River in an area labeled as Post Oak Bend on the
USGS 7.5’ Palo Pinto and Graford East, Texas topographic quadrangles (see Figure 1). These
4 HDD locations will be utilized to install natural gas pipeline segments underneath the
referenced water ways. Each of the 4 HDD locations measure approximately 30.5 by 30.5 m
(100.0 by 100.0 feet) or 0.2 acres. In all, the 4 HDD locations total 0.8 acres.
The Project Area also consists of 2 short segments of the proposed pipeline ROW that
pass near previously recorded archeological sites 41PP178 and 41PP186. The segment of
ROW near site 41PP178 can be found on the USGS 7.5’ Mineral Wells West, Texas,
topographic quadrangle, while the segment near site 41PP186 is located on the USGS 7.5’
Graford, Texas, topographic quadrangle (see Figure 1). Again, PPC requested that Horizon
assess the segments of ROW near these sites to ensure that the cultural deposits from these
sites did not extend into the proposed ROW and to allow for a rerouting of the alignment around
these sites if their deposits did extend into the proposed ROW. These assessed areas of these
2 segments of ROW total 1.5 acres, resulting in a total assessed area of 2.3 acres.
The first HDD location (Keechi 1) is situated on an upland terrace east of Keechi Creek,
while the second HDD location (Keechi 2) is on a similar upland terrace on the west side of
Keechi Creek (Figures 3 and 4; see also Figures 1 and 2). Soils at both locations are mapped
as Bosque clay loam, 0 to 1% slopes, occasionally flooded. Bosque series soils are very deep,
well-drained, moderately permeable soils that formed in loamy, calcareous alluvial sediments on
nearly level floodplains (NRCS 2007).
The third HDD location (Brazos 1) is also situated on an upland terrace east of the
floodplain above Brazos River (Figure 5; see also Figures 1 and 2). Soils at this location are
mapped as Palopinto stony clay loam, 1 to 8% slopes, extremely stony (NRCS 2007). Palopinto
series soils are well-drained, moderately permeable, shallow and very shallow soils over
limestone bedrock that formed in residuum from Pennsylvanian limestone bedrock. They are
typically found on ridges and plains.

Figure 5. General view of HDD Brazos 1
The fourth HDD location (Brazos 2) sits at an eroded upland location on the west bank of
the Brazos River (Figure 6; see also Figures 1 and 2). Soils at this location are mapped as
Apalo very fine sandy loam, 1 to 3% slopes (NRCS 2007). Apalo soils are deep soils found on
nearly level to sloping low terraces. The soil formed in calcareous, loamy alluvial material
deposited mainly on the inside of bends of major rivers and large streams.
Regarding the 2 short segments of proposed ROW near previously recorded
archeological sites, the assessed segment near site 41PP178 measured roughly 243.0 meters
(m) (798.0 feet) in length by 15.3 m (50.0 feet) in width (0.9 acres). It is situated in an upland
setting that has been cleared and used for farm/rangeland in the past (Figure 7; see also
Figures 1 and 2). It is currently covered with thick grasses. Soils in this area are mapped as
Velow clay, 1 to 3% slopes (NRCS 2007). The Velow series soils consist of deep, well drained,
moderately permeable soils that formed in calcareous, loamy sediments. These gently sloping
soils are along footslopes and narrow valleys.
The ROW segment near site 41PP186 measured roughly 275.0 m (902.2 feet) in length
by 9.1 m (30.0 feet) in width (0.6 acres). It is found at the base of a ridge with shallow clay soils
and exposed limestone outcrops (Figure 8; see also Figures 1 and 2). Soils at this location are
mapped as Leeray clay, 1 to 3% slopes (NRCS 2007). The Leeray series soils consist of very
deep, well-drained, very slowly permeable, clayey soils that formed in calcareous, clayey
sediments. These soils are on nearly level to gently sloping valley or upland soils (NRCS 2007).

3.0 CULTURAL BACKGROUND

3.1

PREVIOUS INVESTIGATIONS

Compared to other regions of Texas, North-Central Texas has been the focus of
relatively little archeological research to date; as such, the culture history of this region has yet
to be systematically defined. Archeological work began in 1937 in the Palo Pinto County area
when A.T. Jackson conducted an archeological survey prior to the construction of Possum
Kingdom Lake (Krieger 1946). Of the sites recorded during this survey, the Harrell Site was
excavated by George R. Fox for the Works Progress Administration (WPA)–University of Texas
Statewide Archaeological Survey (Brownlow et al. 1999). These excavations unearthed more
than 150 stone-lined hearths and 32 burials from the 1.2-m- (4.0-foot-) deep cultural deposits on
the site. Recovered artifacts indicated that the site had been occupied from the Archaic through
the Late Prehistoric periods. In addition, the Harrell Site became the type site for the Henrietta
focus based on the late materials and their association with Nocona Plain ceramics.
In 1954, a survey of 3 proposed dam sites was conducted by Moorman and Jelks of the
River Basin Surveys Office in Austin. This survey, in addition to contacts with local amateur
archeologists, recorded more than 24 sites, including the Franty Watson Site, historic crevice
burials in the Lone Camp area, and several rockshelters (Brownlow et al. 1999).
Although very few systematic investigations have been conducted in the vicinity of the
project area, numerous excavations have been undertaken in the surrounding counties,
particularly in the Trinity River drainage to the east, that may serve as a basis for inferring the
nature and chronology of culture history in western Palo Pinto County. For instance, on the
East Fork of the Trinity River, several projects have made significant contributions, including
Lavon Lake (Dawson and Sullivan 1973; Lynott 1975; Stephenson 1949) and Lake Ray
Hubbard (Harris and Suhm 1963; Lorrain and Hoffrichter 1968; Ross 1966). Significant
archeological projects on the upper Elm Fork of the Trinity in the Dallas-Fort Worth-Denton area
include Ray Roberts Reservoir (Ferring 2001; Ferring and Yates 1997; Prikryl and Yates 1987;
Skinner et al. 1982), Lewisville Lake (Brown and Lebo 1991; Ferring and Yates 1998;
Stephenson 1950), and Grapevine Lake (Ferring 1975; Morgan 1975). Along the West Fork of
the Trinity River and its tributaries, intensive investigations have occurred only at Mountain
Creek Lake (Peter and McGregor 1988). Investigations in the Brazos River basin include those
at Lake Granbury (Skinner 1971) and Possum Kingdom Lake (Brayshaw 1970; Hughes 1942;
Krieger 1946).

Chapter 3.0: Cultural Background

Much of the information generated by the reservoir investigations has yet to be
synthesized. The following discussion of the prehistory of North-Central Texas draws on the
few synthetic and summary sources available, especially those by Prikryl (1990, 1993). Story’s
(1990) summary of archeology on the East Texas Gulf Coastal Plain also draws on some of the
work done in the upper Trinity basin, and Lynott’s (1981) discussion of prehistoric adaptations in
the Cross Timbers, Grand Prairie, and North-Central Plains provides connections to an
overview by Hofman et al. (1989) of southern Great Plains archeology.

3.2

PALEOINDIAN PERIOD

As with many other areas of Texas, PaleoIndian materials in North-Central Texas often
are found in surface contexts or mixed with later materials. The generally low density of
PaleoIndian artifacts and sites and the tendency for projectile points to be made from nonlocal
lithic materials have led investigators to characterize these populations as highly mobile with low
regional densities (Lynott 1981:100-101). Megafauna fossil finds within the region have led
some investigators to conclude that subsistence practices of PaleoIndian peoples were linked to
mammoth and bison; however, no kill or butchering sites similar to those identified for the
southern Plains have ever been discovered (Prikryl 1990, 1993).
Generally, the PaleoIndian period in North-Central Texas is considered to extend from
ca. 10,000 to 6500 B.P. (Prikryl 1993:199). Projectile point types that can be associated with
the early to late parts of the period include Clovis, Dalton, Folsom, Plainview, San Patrice, and
Scottsbluff. The most common types recognized are Dalton and Plainview (Prikryl 1990). Most
of the recorded PaleoIndian sites cluster in the upper Trinity drainage where the most intensive
archeological investigations have taken place, though often these sites consist of no more than
1 or 2 points. The Acton site in Hood County, however, situated on a T2 terrace of the Brazos
River overlooking Lake Granbury, is significant for the number of Plainview and Dalton
(Meserve) points it produced (n=72). A variety of other lithic tools, such as gouges, scrapers,
and burins, also were recovered. Unfortunately, the PaleoIndian occupations could not be
isolated from Archaic period occupations of the site.
Interestingly, the only 2 investigated sites in North-Central Texas with apparently
discrete PaleoIndian components, the Lewisville and Aubrey sites, both produced Clovis
projectile points. The Lewisville site contained 27 hearth features and an associated Clovis
point and other sparse lithics in a near-surface context (Crook and Harris 1957, 1958; Story
1990:182-184), and the Aubrey site contained a Clovis component with cultural features and
concentrations of lithics and animal bones buried 7 to 9 m (23 to 30 m) deep on the Elm Fork
floodplain (Ferring 2001). Both sites also contained a variety of faunal remains both large and
small, although only small game, the largest being white-tailed deer, can be associated
comfortably with the Clovis occupation at the Lewisville site. Bison bones were recovered from
Aubrey, but the preponderance of smaller game suggests a more generalized pattern of
foraging as opposed to the reliance on mammoth and bison apparently demonstrated at Clovis
sites on the southern Plains (Hofman et al. 1989:31-32). Such a divergence in subsistence
patterns may reflect an inherent adaptability of Clovis technology to changing environmental

Survey of the Keechi Creek and Brazos River HDD Bore Pits on the Proposed Pecan Pipeline ROW

conditions encountered as early populations spread southeastward into Texas (Ferring and
Yates 1997).

3.3

ARCHAIC PERIOD

The Archaic period extends from ca. 6500 B.C. to A.D. 700., with ca. 2,500-year
segments often considered as early, middle, and late divisions of the period (Prikryl 1993:199).
Diagnostic artifacts for the period are similar to those of adjacent regions, although developing a
sound chronological sequence of diagnostic artifacts has proven difficult because many of the
investigations have focused on surface manifestations. Prikryl (1990) suggests that Early
Archaic projectile points include early split-stemmed varieties and possibly Angostura, and
Middle Archaic points include basal-notched forms such as Andice, Bell, and Calf Creek along
with Bulverde, Carrollton, Dawson, and Wells. Late Archaic point types reportedly include
Castroville, Dallas, Edgewood, Elam, Ellis, Gary, Marshall, Palmillas, Trinity, and Yarbrough
(Prikryl 1990). At one time, the Carrollton and Elam foci were defined to refer to the Middle and
Late Archaic, respectively (Crook and Harris 1952, 1954); however, reevaluation of the type-site
artifacts showed that the materials were mixed such that perpetuation of these foci provides little
interpretive value (Hofman et al. 1989:57; Prikryl 1990:73-74). Some of this mixing and the
generally low numbers of Early and Middle Archaic sites may be the result of extensive erosion
of mid-Holocene deposits. This type of erosion has been documented in the Brazos drainage in
Young, Stephens, and Throckmorton counties (Ensor et al. 1992:303).
Though few isolable components have been analyzed for the various divisions of the
Archaic period in North-Central Texas, slowly increasing populations responding to warmer and
drier environmental conditions have been postulated to explain the overall archeological record
of the period (Lynott 1981:103-104; Story 1990:212). It is thought that these factors may have
led Archaic populations of the Cross Timbers and prairie areas of North-Central Texas to
develop a diversified hunting and gathering pattern based on bottomland resources of the rivers
and major creeks, while Plains populations maintained a focus on bison hunting (Hofman et al.
1989:57-58). Projectile points of the period were fashioned from local lithic materials,
suggesting that populations were less mobile than their PaleoIndian predecessors. Less
mobility also may suggest refinement of the diversified subsistence pattern to include
scheduling of resource use within more restricted areas. Evidence from Late Archaic sites at
Mountain Creek Lake (Peter and McGregor 1988) and Ray Roberts Reservoir (Ferring and
Yates 1997) indicates repeated site occupation by small groups, which could support the
resource scheduling hypothesis. Still, even with refinement of resource use, evidence of dietary
stress has been found on Late Archaic human skeletal materials (Ferring and Yates 1997:305;
Gill-King 1987:103-104).
Human burials are common in the archeological record of the Late Archaic and Late
Prehistoric periods in at least the eastern part of North-Central Texas (Prikryl 1993). Some of
these burials are associated with Wylie pit features, which are large, man-made depressions
measuring ca. 16 m (52 ft) in diameter and 2 to 4 m (7 to 13 ft) in depth. These features were
first identified at a series of sites along the East Fork of the Trinity River and were considered to
be an important trait of the Wylie focus (Harris and Suhm 1963; Stephenson 1952; Wilson

HJN 060191 AR

13

Chapter 3.0: Cultural Background

1946). Radiocarbon assays from pits at the Upper Rockwall and Sister Grove Creek sites in the
area of Lavon Lake suggest that the pits and the Wylie focus were associated with the Late
Prehistoric period (Lynott 1975:117; Ross 1966). Lynott (1977) widened the temporal span by
incorporating a Late Archaic phase into the focus definition. Subsequent work on Wylie pits at
Richland-Chambers Reservoir to the south confirmed their Late Archaic age (Bruseth and
Martin 1987:165); however, the wide range of artifact types associated with them and the long
span of time represented made it clear that the Wylie focus was not a useful construct. Bruseth
and Martin (1987:280-284), although discarding the focus as unusable, further supported
Lynott’s (1975) original interpretation of the pits as being associated with large-scale food
processing. Their interpretation likens the pits to the burned rock middens of Central Texas,
with both representing group aggregations.

3.4

LATE PREHISTORIC PERIOD

Group aggregation and large-scale manipulation of subsistence resources, as
represented by the Wylie pits and the human burials they contain, may indicate societal
changes that continued through the Late Prehistoric period. Habitation structures indicating
increased sedentism, at least in certain places and at certain times, have been found in some
Late Prehistoric sites, along with cultigens such as corn and arrow points and ceramics
indicating important technological changes. Also, there may be evidence of differential mortuary
practices that could reflect a shift toward a hierarchical social structure (e.g., the distinction
between burials placed inside and outside Wylie pits), although this evidence is nowhere near
as strong as that for the Caddoan area of Northeast Texas. Prikryl (1990, 1993) defines
2 chronological periods for the Late Prehistoric in North-Central Texas, which he links to
particular projectile point and ceramic types.
Prikryl’s (1990, 1993) Late Prehistoric I period (A.D. 700 to 1200) is marked by the arrow
point types Alba, Bonham, Catahoula, Scallorn, and Steiner. Ceramic vessels are mostly grogtempered and undecorated, but there is some evidence of influence from other regions because
some locally manufactured wares display designs similar to those associated with East Texas
Caddo ceramic types. Evidence for corn and structures has been found at sites at Mountain
Creek Lake southwest of Dallas, as well as to the north in Cooke County at Hubert Moss Lake
near the Red River (Lorrain 1969; Martin 1994; Peter and McGregor 1988). Farther west,
cultural changes also were taking place on the Rolling Plains, though this area held onto its
Archaic lifestyle even after technological innovations such as the bow and arrow were adopted
(Lynott 1981:106).
During the Late Prehistoric II period (A.D. 1200 to 1700), influences from the southern
Plains became pronounced in the Cross Timbers and prairie areas. These influences coincided
with an increase in bison herd size in North-Central Texas (Lynott 1981:106; Prikryl 1990:80).
Bison were important to subsistence (Harris and Harris 1970; Morris and Morris 1970), but
shrinking procurement territory sizes continued the trend toward horticulture and settled village
life. In terms of technology, a Plains Indian tool assemblage was common (Prikryl 1990:80).
Items associated with this assemblage include calcareous-tempered ceramic vessels, some of
which fit the description for the type Nocona Plain (shell-tempered), and unstemmed triangular

14

arrow points such as Fresno, Harrell, Maud, and Washita, as well as Perdiz points. Tools
specific to bison processing include snub-nosed or thumbnail scrapers and edge-beveled
Harahey knives. Bison scapula hoes, which also are common in Plains Indian sites, have been
recovered from sites in the Lewisville Lake and Lavon Lake areas of Denton and Collin counties
(Barber 1969:118-119; Harris 1945).
The Plains Indian influences associated with settled village life were used to define the
Henrietta complex of North-Central Texas. This complex, based on Krieger’s (1946) more
expansive Henrietta focus, extends from the Red River south along the headwaters of the
Trinity and Brazos rivers. The type site, M.D. Harrell, is situated along the Brazos River in
Young County just northwest of Palo Pinto County in the drainage basin for Possum Kingdom
Reservoir (Krieger 1946). The Harrell site and other associated sites contain middens, house
structures, rock hearths, storage pits, and burials, and they most often are found on sandy
knolls or terraces overlooking river valleys (Brooks 1989:85-86; Forrester 1991:249-266).
Excavated sites attributed to the Henrietta complex include the Coyote and Glass sites on the
Red River in Montague County (Lorrain 1967:24-44; Woodall 1967a), and it is clear that sites
such as Dillard in Cooke County are related as well (Martin 1994).
The Henrietta complex as an investigative tool can be limiting because its loose
definition tends to obscure local differences. More recent investigations in the upper Trinity
River drainage have tended to highlight the local differences. For instance, at Ray Roberts
Reservoir, Ferring and Yates (1997:305) see local trends emerging independent of
extraregional influences. They cite the lack of evidence for extensive maize horticulture and
preponderance of short-term logistical camps as the basis of their hypothesis. Similarly, Peter
and McGregor (1988:367) demonstrated that occupation of the Mountain Creek drainage was
less intensive in the Late Prehistoric II period than before and that maize horticulture, if
practiced at all, was limited. Yet sites in both of these parts of the Trinity drainage have
produced items characteristic of Plains Indian sites, such as shell-tempered ceramics and
diagnostic lithic tools.

PROTOHISTORIC PERIOD

By the 18th century, immigrant Plains Indian groups had moved into and beyond NorthCentral Texas, and their documentation by traders and explorers marks the start of the
Protohistoric period. Documentary sources suggest that the Apache, Caddo, Comanche,
Delaware, Kickapoo, Kitsai, Tonkawa, Wichita, and Yojaune traversed the region at various
times during the period (Campbell 1988; Newcomb 1961; Newcomb and Campbell 1982);
however, archeological sites that can be associated definitely with historic groups are few. The
Wichita are known to have moved into Texas from Oklahoma and Kansas in the early 1700s.
Sites attributable to the Wichita have been identified at the edges of North-Central Texas.
Among these is the Stansbury site in Hill County, now inundated by Lake Whitney (Stephenson
1970). Excavations at the site produced burials, house structures, storage pits, and a variety of
aboriginal artifacts, along with European ceramics, glass beads, metal arrow points, and flintlock
musket parts. A cluster of Wichita sites also occurs to the north along the Red River in
Montague County. These sites occur on both the Oklahoma and Texas sides of the river.

Chapter 3.0: Cultural Background

Woodall (1967b) excavated one of these sites, named the Upper Tucker site, which produced
artifacts and features similar to those discovered at the Stansbury site. Wichita sites both on
the Brazos and Red rivers were situated atop high terraces that overlook the rivers.

3.6

HISTORIC PERIOD

The first European incursion into what is now known as Texas occurred in 1519, when
Álvarez de Pineda explored the northern shores of the Gulf of Mexico. In 1528, Cabeza de
Vaca crossed South Texas after being shipwrecked along the Texas Coast near Galveston Bay.
However, European settlement did not seriously disrupt native ways of life until after 1700. The
first half of the 18th century was the period in which the fur trade and mission system, as well as
the first effects of epidemic diseases, began to seriously disrupt the native culture and social
systems. This process is clearly discernable at the Mitchell Ridge site, where burial data
suggest population declines and group mergers (Ricklis 1994) as well as increased participation
on the part of the Native American population in the fur trade. By the time that heavy settlement
of Texas began in the early 1800s by Anglo-Americans, the indigenous Indian population was
greatly diminished.
William A.A. (“Bigfoot”) Wallace surveyed the frontier in 1837 and may have been the
first Anglo in the area that is now Palo Pinto County. 1 The original settlers in the region,
including Oliver Loving, Charles Goodnight, and Reuben Vaughn, established cattle ranches in
the mid-to-late 1850s. These pioneers had Native American neighbors who raised corn and
grain to supplement their game hunting; there were 6 groups of Native Americans, numbering
1,000 people, living along the Brazos in 1850. Though Vaughn and other early settlers
apparently cultivated friendships with the native inhabitants of the region, the relations between
the 2 peoples became strained as more whites moved into the region. The Brazos Indian
Reservation, founded in 1854, held destitute bands from several tribes, including the Delaware,
Shawnee, Tonkawa, Wichita, and Caddo. All Indian depredations, whether perpetrated by free
Comanches or Kiowas passing through the region or by reservation Indians from Indian
Territory, were attributed by terrified settlers to Indians from the Brazos Reservation. White
settlers retaliated against reservation Indians, and racial tension and violent incidents increased.
According to pioneer Henry Belding, reservation Indians became hostile “because a lot of
cowards from Erath County had found a party of Indians camped near Palo Pinto and
attacked...and killed squaws and children and men...[T]heir dastardly act cost the lives of many
good citizens” (Handbook 2007). Violence followed, and, in 1856, the Texas Rangers rounded
up the Indians and moved them to 2 reservations established in Young and Throckmorton
counties. The removal did not end the conflict, however, for settlers complained that reservation
Indians continued to steal cattle, and some settlers threatened to attack the reservations.
Eventually, the Indians were removed from their Brazos Reservation to Oklahoma, while settlers
flocked in along the old Fort Worth-Fort Belknap road.

In 1856, the Texas state legislature established Palo Pinto County from lands formerly
assigned to Bosque and Navarro counties. The county was organized the next year, with the
town of Golconda chosen as the seat of government. The town was renamed Palo Pinto in
1858. One of the first businesses in the county, an ox treadmill, was established that year. By
1860, there were 1,524 people, including 130 slaves, living in the county. Almost 15,400 cattle
and more than 3,200 sheep were counted on Palo Pinto ranches and farms that year. Farmers
grew mostly corn, wheat, and oats, although 17 bales of cotton were also produced. Though
crop farming was becoming better established in the area, the area’s economy centered on
cattle in the years following the Civil War. In 1867, cattlemen Oliver Loving and Charles
Goodnight established the famed Goodnight-Loving Trail to western markets. In 1876, C.C.
Slaughter, James C. Loving, and C.L. “Kit” Carter met to discuss the theft of cattle by
reservation Indians and white rustlers, and the challenge to their open range by new settlers.
Out of this meeting on Slaughter’s ranch grew the organizational meeting, held at Graham the
next year, of the Stock Raiser’s Association of Northwest Texas, later known as the Texas and
Southwestern Cattle Raisers Association. Carter, of Palo Pinto, was the association’s first
president. In the late 1870s and early 1880s, some ranchmen began fencing rangeland to
which they held title. Some settlers opposed fencing of the traditionally free open range, and
incidents of fence-cutting and violence resulted. By 1880, there were 648 farms and ranches in
Palo Pinto County; of these, 476 were operated by their owners, 28 were operated by renters,
and 144 were farmed by sharecroppers. More than 9,300 acres in the county were planted in
corn, the county’s most important crop at that time, with another 2,425 acres devoted to wheat.
Cotton was becoming an important cash crop, and 4,300 acres in the county were devoted to
the fiber. As cropland in the county expanded, so did the number of livestock—by 1880, there
were 42,400 cattle and 5,000 sheep grazing in the county. Nine manufacturing businesses,
employing 20 workers, had been established in the county. The area’s expanding population
reflected its economic growth, as the census counted 5,882 people living in Palo Pinto County
that year.
In 1880, the Texas and Pacific Railway was built through Palo Pinto County, tying the
area to national markets and encouraging farming and further settlement. The towns of Brazos,
Santo, Gordon, Mingus, and Strawn sprang up along the rail route. In 1891, the Weatherford,
Mineral Wells and Northwestern Railway, a 25-mile line, was also built into the area, bringing
eastern traffic to Mineral Wells. The line became part of the Texas and Pacific in 1902.
Between 1880 and 1910, the number of farms and ranches in the county almost tripled, rising to
1,271 by 1900 and to 1,921 by 1910; meanwhile, the population of the county rose to 8,320 by
1890, to 12,291 by 1900, and to 19,506 by 1910. Though most of the new settlers were nativeborn whites, hundreds were foreign-born immigrants from Germany, Austria, England, Scotland,
Italy, and other European nations. The county’s African-American population also grew
significantly during this period, rising from 67 in 1890 to 528 by 1910. The character of the local
economy also changed during the last decades of the 19th century and the first years of the
20th century. Sheep ranching dwindled away—only 163 sheep remained in the area by 1910.
While cattle remained an important locus of production, the number of cattle in Palo Pinto
declined from 58,000 in 1890 to 28,700 by 1910. Meanwhile, crop farming became ever more
important and cotton acreage expanded steadily, rising to 10,809 acres by 1890 and to
19,569 acres by 1900; by 1910, 32,000 acres in the county were devoted to growing the fiber.

HJN 060191 AR

Chapter 3.0: Cultural Background

As cotton production expanded, the number of acres planted in oats, wheat, and corn declined
significantly; in 1910, for example, no wheat at all was grown in Palo Pinto, while less acreage
was devoted to corn than at any time since the Civil War. Tenancy rates among the local
farmers rose steadily as cotton cultivation expanded across the county. By 1910, almost half
(919) of the farmers in the county were tenants. Cotton farming in the area declined
substantially during and after the 1910s, however; almost 25,000 bales were ginned in 1906, for
example, but only 5,300 bales were produced in 1916 and 5,400 bales in 1926. The crop would
never again be so important to the area. Boll weevils and other insects forced most farmers to
change to peanuts and other crops, including fruits, corn, grain sorghums, and hairy vetch. In
1930, only 18,000 acres of the county’s 66,800 acres of cropland were planted in cotton.
Meanwhile, ranching revived in the area, and goats and sheep were increasingly evident on the
county’s pastures. By 1930, the county had 46,000 cattle, 6,600 sheep, and 8,500 goats.
Oil production during the 1910s helped to diversify the local economy. The first test oil
well in Palo Pinto County was drilled in 1901, but the boom did not occur until 1915, when the
field near the town of Palo Pinto was opened and became “one of the most productive oil fields
in the world” (Handbook 2007), according to one historian. The population of the county rose to
23,431 by 1920 but declined during the 1920s despite the establishment of Fort Wolters, a
training site near Mineral Wells for the Texas National Guard, in 1925. By 1930, the county
population was 17,576. The decline of cotton in the area accelerated during the Great
Depression of the 1930s. By 1940, only 3,300 acres in the county were devoted to the fiber,
and production of corn, wheat, and oats also declined significantly. Peanut farming became an
important part of the local agricultural economy during this period, however, and wool and
mohair production rapidly increased; by 1940, there were 23,000 sheep and 20,000 goats in the
county. To some extent, oil production also helped to offset some of the worst effects of the
Depression, though production had tapered off by this time—117,000 barrels were produced in
1938. Though cropland harvested in the county declined slightly to 63,000 acres by 1940, the
number of farms and ranches in the area increased to 1,325 by that time, and the population
had increased slightly to reach 18,356. During World War II, Fort Wolters was expanded to
accommodate 25,000 troops. The population of Palo Pinto County declined during the 1940s,
however, partly because of farm consolidations and the mechanization of agriculture. By 1950,
only 1,026 farms remained in the area, and the population had dropped to 17,154.
Oil production increased during the 1950s. While only 97,600 barrels of crude were
produced in the county in 1948, for example, county wells produced over 230,000 barrels in
1956 and 335,000 barrels in 1960. Since then, oil and natural gas production has remained a
significant part of the local economy. Almost 260,400 barrels of crude oil were produced in the
county in 1974, 480,000 barrels in 1978, and 364,400 barrels in 1982. In 1990, 367,000 barrels
of oil were produced in the county; by 1 January 1991, 17,874,218 barrels had been produced
in the county since discovery in 1902. Thanks in part to oil activity, the number of people living
in Palo Pinto County rose to 20,516 by 1960 and to 28,962 by 1970. The area’s population
declined during the 1970s, however, to reach 24,062 by 1980.

4.0 ARCHIVAL RESEARCH

Horizon conducted archival research on the Texas Historical Commission’s (THC) Texas
Archeological Sites Atlas Database (Atlas) web site and at the Texas Archeological Research
Laboratory (TARL) to determine if any archeological sites have been previously recorded within
2.0 kilometers (1.2 miles) of the 4 proposed HDD locations (THC 2007). This research
indicated that no sites are documented within the 2.0-kilometer review radius around the 2 HDD
locations on the Brazos River (Brazos 1 and 2). According to the Atlas, these locations have
not been previously assessed for cultural resources.
Regarding the 2 HDD locations on Keechi Creek (Keechi 1 and 2), a total 12 previously
recorded archeological sites have been previously recorded in the 2.0-kilometer review
perimeter around these locations (Figure 9). These sites consist of 1 historic homestead
(41PP262), 1 prehistoric burned rock midden (41PP14), 2 prehistoric lithic scatters (41PP180
and 41PP256), and 8 sites for which no file was available (41PP177, 41PP178, 41PP179,
41PP180, 41PP181, 41PP184, 41PP186, and 41PP187). None of these sites are located in the
immediate vicinity of either of the 2 HDD locations on Keechi Creek. According to the Atlas,
these 2 locations have not been previously assessed for cultural resources.
Based on the site boundary maps housed at TARL, 2 of the 12 previously recorded sites
noted above are located in proximity to segments of the proposed pipeline ROW (see Figure 9).
These 2 sites, 41PP178 and 41PP186, both lacked site data on the Atlas. Similarly, no site
forms for these sites were housed at TARL. While in the field, the Horizon crew met with Mr.
Josh Jenkins, an amateur archeologist and the owner of the land containing site 41PP178.
However, it would appear that Mr. Jenkins did not record site 41PP178, as he was unaware
what it was and could not provide additional information about it. He did show the field crew
several projectile points that he had collected in the area. One specimen consisted of a small,
expanding stem dart point reflective of Archaic era occupation in the area (Figure 10). The
other specimens consisted of a complete Plainview point and a Plainview base evidencing
PaleoIndian usage of the area (Figure 11). All of the 6 previously recorded sites within the
review area are generally located away from the proposed HDD locations.

5.0 SURVEY METHODOLOGY

Horizon archeologists completed the cultural resources survey of the 4 HDD locations
and the pipeline ROW in the vicinity of the previously recorded sites on various dates in October
and November 2007. Initially, a 3-person crew assessed the 2 HDD locations on Keechi Creek
and the pipeline ROW near site 41PP178 on 30 and 31 October 2007. This crew also assessed
the eastern HDD location on the Brazos River (HDD Brazos 1) on the same date. Due to land
access issues, a single Horizon archeologist returned to the area to assess HDD Brazos 2 on 5
November 2007 and the pipeline ROW near site 41PP186 on 16 November 2007. The field
efforts consisted of both intensive surface inspection and subsurface shovel testing at all of the
locations. Shovel tests averaged 30 centimeters (cm) (12 inches) in diameter and were
excavated to a depth of 100 cm below surface (39 inches) or until sterile, dense clays or
bedrock was encountered. All excavated matrices were screened through 6-millimeter (mm)
(1/4-inch) hardware mesh and examined for cultural materials.
The Texas State Minimum Archeological Survey Standards (TSMASS) require a
minimum of 2 shovel tests per acre on projects between 2 and 10 acres in size. Each of the 4
HDD locations consisted of an area totaling only 0.2 acres in size (0.8 acres total), and the
assessed areas of proposed ROW adjacent to the previously recorded sited measured 1.5
acres in size, resulting in an overall acreage for the project of 2.3 acres. As such, a total of 5
shovel tests were necessary in order to comply with the TSMASS. Horizon exceeded the
minimum requirements by excavating a total of 4 shovel tests at each HDD location and 14
shovel tests along the segments of the proposed ROW adjacent to the previously recorded sites
for an overall total of 30 shovel tests.
A non-collection strategy was employed during the survey efforts. Any non-diagnostic
cultural materials (e.g., burned rock, lithic debitage, etc.) observed on the surface or within
shovel tests were to be tabulated and described in the field and then subsequently returned to
where they were found. Diagnostic cultural materials (e.g., projectile points, charcoal, etc.) were
to be collected for analysis and further documentation. Field notes were maintained on terrain,
vegetation, soils, land forms, observed cultural material (if any), etc. Photographs with a photo
log were completed when appropriate. Shovel test location data were acquired via a handheld
global positioning system (GPS) unit (Garmin Foretrex) using the UTM coordinate system and
the NAD 27 map datum. Shovel test locations are presented in Figure 12. Shovel test data are
presented in Appendix A.

6.0 RESULTS AND RECOMMENDATIONS

6.1

RESULTS

The survey of the 4 HDD locations resulted in entirely negative findings. No cultural
material was observed during the surface inspection or within any of the shovel tests excavated
on the proposed HDD locations. Similarly, the survey of the segments of the proposed pipeline
ROW in the vicinity of previously recorded sites 41PP178 and 41PP186 also resulted in entirely
negative findings. This indicates that the mapped boundaries of these sites are correct and that
they do not extend into the limits of the proposed pipeline ROW.

6.2

RECOMMENDATIONS

Based on the negative survey results, it is Horizon’s opinion that no significant cultural
resources will be impacted by the proposed HDD activities associated with the proposed Palo
Pinto 20-inch natural gas pipeline on Keechi Creek and the Brazos River. It is also Horizon’s
opinion that the proposed pipeline will also have no impact on the deposits of sites 41PP178
and 41PP186, as these sites are located outside of the limits of the proposed ROW. Horizon
therefore recommends that cultural resources clearance be granted for the undertaking.
However, in the unlikely event that any cultural materials (including human remains or burial
features) are inadvertently discovered at any point during the HDD activities, even in previously
surveyed areas, all work should cease immediately and the THC should be notified of the
discovery.
