Abstract
On April 4th, 2008, the Center for Archaeological Studies (CAS) at Texas State University-San
Marcos (University) monitored a shallow trench excavation on behalf of the University. The shallow
trench was excavated in order to bury waterlines, part of a campus beautification project sponsored by
the University. The University’s use of funds issued from the State of Texas means that this development
is subject to provisions of the Texas Antiquities Code. Work was carried out by Jon C. Lohse, who
served as Principal Investigator, and CAS archaeologist, R. Zac Selden, under the Texas Antiquities
Permit Number 4871.
Monitoring of the trench excavation revealed that no archaeological deposits were impacted. Based
on these results, CAS concludes that the project area does not contain cultural properties or resources
considered significant to the city, state, or nation’s history. It is recommended that permission be granted
to proceed with the proposed development.

Introduction

Under short report format set forth by the
Council of Texas Archeologists and adopted by
the THC, this report provides a brief overview
of the regulatory requirements for this project,
defines the project area setting, provides a
cultural background, describes the methods used
in gathering data, and presents the results. The
archaeological monitoring for this project was
performed by the Principal Investigator, Dr. Jon
C. Lohse, and CAS Field Archaeologist, R. Zac
Selden.

On April 4th, 2008, the Center for
Archaeological Studies (CAS) at Texas State
University–San Marcos (University) performed
archaeological monitoring on behalf of the
University for shallow-trench excavations in
San Marcos, Hays County, Texas (Figure 1). The
current project excavated hundreds of meters of
shallow trenches in order to bury waterlines that
will supply decorative fountains in the ponds
surrounding the University’s Theatre Center.
Eighty percent of the project area followed preexisting buried lines and cables, but archaeological
monitoring was necessary for a short trench in
an area that had not been previously disturbed
(Figure 2). This trench, on University-owned
property, was no more than 50 cm deep and 20
cm wide, and extended for approximately 50 m.

Regulatory Overview
Cultural resources located on land owned or
controlled by the State of Texas or its political
subdivisions are protected by the TAC (Texas
Natural Resources Code, Title 9, Chapter
191), which identifies significant sites as State
Archaeological Landmarks (SALs). Should any
historic or prehistoric sites located on land that
is designated for impact during development
be determined eligible for formal designation
of landmark status under the TAC, some
measure of protection or mitigation of impact
may be necessary. The formal designation of
SALs, as well as their administration, is the

The University’s use of funds issued from
the State of Texas means that this development
is subject to provisions of the Texas Antiquities
Code (TAC). All archaeological work was
performed under auspices of an emergency Texas
Antiquities Permit Number 4871, granted to Jon
C. Lohse of CAS.

responsibility of the Texas Historical Commission
(THC).

Worthiness for designation as a SAL is
defined in the TAC:

The TAC generally requires that a
complete archaeological survey be performed
in conjunction with projects that fall under its
purview, particularly in previously unsurveyed
areas and in regions where cultural resources
are expected. Any resources determined to be
significant must then be avoided, protected, or
their destruction mitigated by approved data
recovery programs.

Archaeological sites may be considered
significant and be recognized or designated as
State Archaeological Landmarks, provided that
at least one of the following conditions is met
(Rules and Practice, Chapter 41:10):
The archaeological site is situated on land
owned or controlled by the State of Texas or one
of its political subdivisions; [and then]
?

(a) preservation of materials must be
sufficient to allow application of standard
archaeological techniques to advantage; and/or

tremendous diversity in terms of plant and
animal species (Crumley 1994). Accordingly,
they also represent likely areas for supporting
dense human occupations during both historic
and prehistoric times.

(b) the majority of artifacts are in place
so that a significant portion of the site’s
original characteristics can be defined through
investigation; and/or

Soils
The current project area’s soils are entirely
within the Tinn Series (Tn) which are typically
found on floodplains (Batte 1974). As described
by Batte (1974), the Tinn series are deep, poorly
drained, and nearly level clayey soils formed in
calcareous clay alluvium. The surface layer is
made up of dark gray clay about 25 inches thick
and overlies a 55 inch thick layer of grayish
brown clay.

(c) the site has the potential to contribute
to cumulative cultural history by the addition of
new information; and/or
(d) the site offers evidence of unique or rare
attributes; and/or
(e) the site offers a unique or rare
opportunity to test techniques, theory, or method
of preservation, thereby contributing to scientific
knowledge.

Flora and Fauna
Although the project area is in the
aforementioned ecotonal zone and has the
potential to support tremendous floral and faunal
diversity, it has been disturbed by several different
developments and no natural vegetation remains.
The fishponds, which are remnants of the oldest
Federal Fish Hatchery west of the Mississippi,
were constructed in 1893 and currently support
cypress trees, koi, turtles, geese, and ducks (Texas
State University–San Marcos 2008) (Figure 3).

Normal circumstances allow sufficient time
to investigate a project area and prepare a report
describing impacts and offering recommendations
on the development of land, but this project
afforded no such time. In situations of this
nature, the THC has the ability to quickly grant
the project a Texas Antiquities Permit to ensure
compliance with the TAC.

Hydrology

Project Area Setting

San Marcos Springs, also known by the
European settlers as St. Mark’s, by the Tonkawas
as Canocanayesatetlo, and currently as Aquarena
Springs, have attracted human populations for
at least the last 8,000 years (Brune 2005). As
described by Brune (2005), the springs were
important stops on El Camino Real and the
Chisholm cattle trail. They are the second largest
springs in Texas and support a tremendous
amount of wildlife. The San Marcos Springs are
the headwaters of the San Marcos River, which
has provided power to gins, corn, saw, and grist

The City of San Marcos is located in Hays
County, in southeastern Central Texas. The San
Marcos River, which is less than 200 m to the east
of the current project area, is fed by an artesian
spring at the base of the Balcones Escarpment,
which marks the boundary between the Edwards
Plateau (hill country) and the Blackland Prairie.
Ecotonal zones such as this one, comprising
transitions between two adjoining large-scale
environmental provinces, are understood as
high-energy settings capable of supporting

history.

chronology is based on Black (1995), Hester
(1995, 2004), and Collins (1995, 2004).

Prehistoric

Central Texas Cultural
Chronology

The Prehistoric period is divided into
three major styles, the Paleoindian, Archaic
and Late Prehistoric. The Paleoindian stage is
characterized by the earliest human occupation
of North America prior to 8,000 BP. The Archaic
stage follows, extending from ca. 8,000 BP to
1,200 BP, and is generally seen as a time during
which humans made successful adaptations
to changing environmental conditions. The
Late Prehistoric stage begins ca. 1,200 BP and
is characterized by a resurgence of grassland

The cultural chronologies for Central and
South Texas are not completely understood or
agreed upon. However, archaeological deposits
indicate rich cultural development. Black (1995),
Hester (1995, 2004), and Collins (1995, 2004)
present the most recent syntheses of the available
chronological evidence of archaeological culture
history in the region. The following cultural

and ceramic technologies.

tools for wood working; the predominance of
corner- and side-notch projectile points; greater
population stability and less residential mobility;
and systematic burial of the dead. This stage is
also distinguished by environmental and climatic
changes.

Paleoindian
Collins (1995:381–385, 2004) dates the
Paleoindian period to 11,500–8,800 BP in
Central Texas, though he excludes the final
Late Paleoindian interval known as Angostura.
Diagnostic artifacts observed from this stage are
associated with the Clovis, Folsom and a variety
of later Paleoindian cultures (Bousman et al.
2004). The Early Paleoindian stage, consisting of
Clovis and Folsom, is generally characterized by
nomadic cultures that relied heavily on hunting
large game animals (Black 1989). Recent research
has shown that Paleoindian peoples also utilized
a wide variety of plants and small game animals
(Black 1989; Bousman et al. 2004; Collins and
Brown 2000; Hester 1983).

Early Archaic

The Late Paleoindian substage occurs from
ca.10,000–8,000 BP. Reliable evidence for these
dates was recovered from the Wilson-Leonard
site, north of Austin (Bousman et al. 2004;
Collins 1998). At Wilson-Leonard, archaeologists
excavated an occupation known as Wilson, named
after the unique stemmed projectile point. The
dense occupation also included a human burial
(Bousman et al. 2004; Collins 1998).

Collins and Hester debate the time frame of
the Early Archaic stage in Central Texas. Hester
(1995:436–438, 2004) defines the Early Archaic
with Early Basal Notched and Early Corner
Notched dart points dating between 7,950 and
4,450 BP, while Collins (1995:383, 2004) argues
that the Early Archaic spans from 8,800 to
6,000 BP based on three divisions of projectile
point types. It is generally believed that at the
beginning of the Holocene, a warming in climate
led to the extinction of large herds of megafauna
and stimulated behavioral changes of hunters and
gatherers in South-Central Texas (McKinney
1981). A dietary adjustment is evidenced by
the increased number of ground stone artifacts,
burned rock midden cooking features, and more
specialized tools such as Clear Fork gouges and
Guadalupe bifaces (Turner and Hester 1993:246–
256). Early Archaic sites are thinly dispersed and
are seen across a wide area of Texas and northern
Mexico (Weir 1976).

Archaic

Middle Archaic

Collins (1995, 2004) contends the Archaic
stage in Central Texas lasted approximately 7,500
years, from 8,800–1,200/1,300 BP, and, following
Weir (1976), divides the stage into Early, Middle,
and Late Archaic. The Archaic stage marks several
important transitions: a shift from large game
hunting to hunting smaller animals; the increased
use of plant food resources and use of ground
stones in food processing; the implementation
of stone cooking technology; increased use of
organic materials for tool manufacturing and
an increase in the number and variety of lithic

Collins (1995, 2004) divides the Middle
Archaic, 4,000–6,000 BP, into three projectile
point style intervals: Bell-Andice-Calf Creek;
Taylor; and Nolan and Travis. The Middle Archaic
is marked by the onset of the Altithermal, a very
warm and dry period. The Bell-Andice-Calf
Creek interval was a moist, mesic period when
grasslands expanded southwards into Central
and South Texas, followed by bison herds from
the Plains. Bell-Andice-Calf Creek peoples were
specialized bison hunters who followed the herds
southwards. As the Altithermal progressed, the
?

Austin Phase

bison and bison hunters retreated northwards.
By the latter part of the Middle Archaic, Taylor
bifaces were replaced by Nolan and Travis
points (Collins 1995, 2004). The Nolan-Travis
interval was also a period when temperature and
aridity were at their greatest levels, and there is
evidence of increased utilization of xerophytes
such as sotol (Johnson and Goode 1994). During
drier episodes, the aquifer-fed streams and
resource-rich environments of Central Texas
were extensively utilized (Story 1985:40; Weir
1976:125, 128).

The Austin phase is characterized by the
appearance of small arrow points. Burned rock
middens are occasionally found with these types
of points (Houk and Lohse 1993), and ground and
pecked stone tools used for plant food processing
are increasingly common. Burials from this time
reveal a high proportion of arrow-wound deaths
(Black 1989; Meissner 1991; Prewitt 1974),
suggesting that population growth resulted in
disputes over limited resources.

Toyah Phase

Late Archaic

The beginning of the Toyah phase (800 BP)
in Central Texas is discernible by the appearance
of contracting stem points with flaring, barbed
shouldered points. This phase is also characterized
by the introduction of bladelet technology that
included prismatic blades, blade cores, and
scrapers-on-blades, all considered to be part of a
specialized Toyah bison hunting and processing
toolkit (Black and McGraw 1985; Huebner 1991;
Ricklis 1994). Toyah is also characterized by the
appearance of bone-tempered pottery in Central
Texas (Johnson 1994:241–281). The wide variety
of ceramic styles and influences seen throughout
Toyah phase ceramic assemblages provide
important information on the social composition
of these groups (Arnn 2005). Toyah ceramic
assemblages display Caddo, Texas Gulf Coast,
and Jornada Mogollon influences (Arnn 2005).

The Central Texas Late Archaic dates to
approximately 4,000–1,300/1,200 BP (Collins
1995:384, 2004). Herds of bison began returning
to the southern Great Plains, again influencing
the subsistence strategies (Dillehay 1974). Some
believe cemeteries at sites such as Ernest Witte
(Hall 1981) and Olmos Dam (Lukowski 1988)
are evidence that populations increased and
that groups were becoming territorial (Story
1985:44–45). Others challenge the interpretation
by citing a decrease in burned rock middens
(Prewitt 1981:80–81). Pottery began appearing
in limited areas of the South Texas Plains during
this period; however, most regions remained
“pre-ceramic” for another thousand years (Story
1985:45–47).

Late Prehistoric

Protohistoric (Spanish Entrada Period)

Collins (1995, 2004) dates the Late
Prehistoric in Central Texas at 1,300/1,200–260
BP, and follows Kelly (1947) in dividing it into
Austin and Toyah phases. The most significant
changes include a technological shift away from
the dart and atlatl to the bow and arrow and the
incorporation of pottery (Black 1989:32; Story
1985:45–47).

In Texas, the Protohistoric period was marked
by Spanish entradas, the formal expeditions
from established forts and missions in Northern
Mexico into Central, Coastal, and East Texas
in the late seventeenth and early eighteenth
centuries. These encounters began with the
venture into Texas by the Spanish explorer

?

Historic

Cabeza de Vaca and the Narvaez expedition in
1528. The period is generally dated between
1500 and 1700 (or 1528, the date of the Cabeza de
Vaca/Narvaez expedition, to the establishment of
the first Spanish mission, Mission San Antonio
de Valero in 1718).

Spanish settlement in Central Texas first
occurred in San Antonio with the establishment
of Mission San Antonio de Valero (the Alamo)
in 1718, and the later founding of San Antonio
de Béxar (Bolton 1970; Habig 1977; de la Teja
1995). Some researchers demarcate the transition
in Texas between the Entrada (Protohistoric) and
Historic periods by the construction of the first
Spanish missions in Texas. Most knowledge of
this period is gained through the written records
of the early Spanish missionaries. Besides the
mission town of San Antonio, the only other
Spanish settlement in the region was San Marcos
de Neve, established in 1808, four miles south of
present day San Marcos. San Marcos de Neve was
abandoned in 1812 as a result of constant raids
by local tribes (Dobie 1932). During this time,
massive depopulation occurred among the Native
Americans, mostly due to European diseases to
which the indigenous people had little resistance.
Those few remaining were nearly all displaced to
reservations by the mid-1850s (Fisher 1998).

With Alonso de León’s expedition of 1680, El
Camino Real (the King’s Road) was established
from Villa Santiago de la Monclova in Mexico
to East Texas. This roadway followed established
Native American trade routes and trails and
became a vital link between Mission San Juan
Bautista in Northern Mexico and the Spanish
settlement of Los Adaes in East Texas (McGraw
et al. 1991).
Spanish priests accompanying entradas
provided the most complete information of
indigenous cultures of early Texas. Those
documented during the early entradas include the
Cantona, Muruam, Payaya, Sana, and Yojuane,
who were settled around the springs at San Marcos
and described as semi-nomadic bands. Other
tribes encountered at San Marcos included mobile
hunting parties from villages in South and West
Texas, such as Catequeza, Cayanaaya, Chalome,
Cibolo, and Jumano, who were heading for bison
hunting grounds in the Blackland Prairies (Foster
1995:265–289; Johnson and Campbell 1992;
Newcomb 1993). Later groups migrated into the
region and displaced the former groups or tribes.
These included the Tonkawa from Oklahoma and
Lipan and Comanche from the Plains (Campbell
and Campbell 1985; Dunn 1911; Newcomb 1961,
1993).

European presence in the region increased
as settlers received land grants from the Mexican
government until 1835. Settlement was difficult,
however, due to continuation of hostilities with
and raids by Native American tribes. The Texas
Rangers provided protection from these conflicts
after Texas secured independence from Mexico
in 1836. Settlement in the region increased until
1845, when Texas gained admission to the United
States, resulting in the formation of Hays County
in 1848 (Bousman and Nickels 2003).

Previous Archaeological
Investigations

Archaeological sites dated to this period
typically contain a mix of both European
imported goods, such as metal objects and glass
beads, and traditional Native American artifacts,
such as manufactured stone tools.

The current project area, adjacent to the
spring fed San Marcos River which has attracted
human populations since the Paleoindian Period,
?

has five sites, 41HY135, 41HY161, 41HY165,
41HY319, and 41HY432, within one kilometer. A
brief description of each site is presented using
information from the THC Archeological Site
Atlas Database (Database) and technical reports.

In 1984, during a field school, Garber recorded
State Archaeological Landmark site 41HY165 on
the southeast shore of Spring Lake. At the time of
recording, this site was a surficial scatter of lithic
debitage and bifacial tools (Garber 1984). This
site is a possible extension of 41HY161. Further
investigation in the form of testing for vertical
and horizontal boundaries was recommended.

As described on the Database, site 41HY135,
a State Archaeological Landmark, was discovered
at the confluence of the San Marcos River and
Purgatory Creek (Warren 1977). The site, of
unknown age, consisted of a surficial lithic scatter
and showed evidence of disturbance by a sewer
line, gravel path, and natural erosion. Testing of
the site was recommended to further delineate it
both vertically and horizontally. Information on
further investigation of the site is not present on
the Database.

The Center for Archaeological Studies
performed a survey on behalf of the City of San
Marcos in 2001. Site 41HY319, a prehistoric site
of unknown age, was discovered during survey
(Barrera 2002). Beneath disturbed sediments, a
possible intact cultural deposit, represented by
lithic debitage, was found beginning at 50 cmbs
(centimeters below surface). Due to the shallow
nature of the proposed development and the
absence of temporally diagnostic artifacts, no
further work was recommended (Barrera 2002).

State Archaeological Landmark site
41HY161, just below the Ice House dam to the
south of the springs, was initially investigated by
Joel Shiner in 1978. His data showed a significant
amount of disturbance (Archaic artifacts were
found mixed with historic artifacts) (Bousman
2001). Starting in 1982, a series of field schools
directed by Dr. James Garber began to investigate
sites in San Marcos and included fieldwork at
41HY161 (Bousman, 2001). A decade later,
in 1992, Garber and Glassman recovered two
burials from 41HY161. Preservation of bone was
moderate, but both burials were disturbed and
only partially recovered (Garber and Glassman
1992). As described by Aery (2007), prior to
development in the late 1990s, testing of the
southwestern portion of the site revealed an
intact Late Archaic component overlying a Late
Paleoindian component (Ford and Lyle 1998;
Lyle et al. 2000). Eric Oksanen (2007) and Dave
Nickels supervised the most recent excavations of
site 41HY161 in 2004 during which intact Early
Archaic deposits were encountered.

In the spring of 2007, site 41HY432 was
discovered by archaeologists from Hicks & Co.
while conducting a survey on behalf of the City
of San Marcos. A combination of shovel tests
and mechanical excavation revealed that site
41HY432 was an undeterminable prehistoric site
(King 2007). As described by Brian King (2007)
the proximity and similar depth suggest that
41HY432 is an extension of 41HY319.

Methods
Due to time constraints and the limited
amount of potential impact, the current project
called for archaeological monitoring of the trench
excavation. The trench, which was approximately
50 m long, 20 cm wide, and, at most, 50 cm deep,
was excavated with the use of a “Ditch Witch.”
The entire digging process was monitored
to minimize the potential disturbance of any

?

archaeological features and to ensure systematic
recovery of artifacts if present. The digging
process would have stopped had there been
evidence of any intact features or other significant
remains until those features could be documented
or the remains recorded. Upon completing
excavation, the trench was photographed. The
excavated trench remained open until waterlines
were placed and properly secured.

that the excavated sediment had been previously
disturbed in the late 19th century by construction
of the fish ponds.

Recommendations
Archaeological monitoring of a shallow
trench excavation on University property
adjacent to the San Marcos River and three State
Archaeological Landmarks revealed that no
prehistoric or historic deposits are present in the
area of potential effect that can be construed as
potentially significant to the city or state’s history
under any criteria of the Texas Antiquities Code.
Accordingly, CAS concludes that no additional
archaeological investigations are necessary and
recommends that the University be granted
regulatory clearance to proceed with their plans.

Results
The shallow trench was excavated
expediently, and by the end of the day, waterlines
were installed and the trenches were backfilled (Figure 4). Archaeological monitoring
revealed that no cultural remains or features
were impacted during excavation. It is suspected
