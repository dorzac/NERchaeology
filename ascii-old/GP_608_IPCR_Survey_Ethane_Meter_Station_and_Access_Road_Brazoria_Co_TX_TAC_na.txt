ABSTRACT
Mustang Engineering, LP contracted HRA Gray & Pape, LLC to conduct an intensive
archaeological survey of 6.5 hectares (16 acres) of property in central eastern Brazoria
County, Texas. The property is proposed for the construction of a meter station. The Lead
Federal Agency for the project has been identified as the United States Army Corps of
Engineers, Galveston District.
The project was conducted in compliance with United States Army Corps of Engineers
permitting requirements associated with wetlands that may be impacted during construction in
the Corps permit area. The procedures to be followed by the United States Army Corps of
Engineers to fulfill the requirements set forth in the National Historic Preservation Act, other
applicable historic preservation laws, and Presidential directives as they relate to the
regulatory program of the United States Army Corps of Engineers (33 CFR Parts 320-334) are
articulated in the Regulatory Program of the United States Army Corps of Engineers, Part 325
- Processing of Department of the Army Permits, Appendix C - Procedures for the Protection
of Historic Properties. The project takes place entirely on private property and an Antiquities
Code of Texas Permit was not required. However, all work was conducted following accepted
standards set forth by the Texas Historical Commission and the Council of Texas
Archeologists, and in accordance with section 106 of the National Historic Preservation Act.
The permit area is located on the Hoskins Mound 7.5-minute United States Geological Survey
topographic quadrangle map and is located on a talf about 18 kilometers (11.25 mile) north of
the Gulf of Mexico coastline. The permit area is defined as the 5.25 hectares (13 acres)
proposed for the meter station pad and the 450-meter (1475-foot) long 30-meter (100-foot)
wide access road. Subsurface impacts are expected to be confined to less than 1 meter (3.3
feet) below the surface.
As a result of the investigation, the entire permit area was surveyed and required a total of 20
person hours to complete. During survey, 9 shovel tests were excavated. The other planned
tests were not excavated due to inundation. No new or previously-recorded cultural resources,
including buried archaeological sites or historic structures, were identified during survey. No
above-ground historic structures were recorded within or adjacent to the permit area as a result
of survey. While there were no disturbances identified, the level to low-lying topography and
frequent flooding have clearly had an effect on site survival and depth.
Based on these results, no prehistoric or historic cultural resources will be affected by the
proposed project. HRA Gray & Pape, LLC recommends no further work within the surveyed
area and that the project be allowed to proceed as planned.

1.0 INTRODUCTION
Mustang Engineering, LP contracted HRA Gray & Pape, LLC (HRA Gray & Pape) to conduct
an intensive archaeological survey of 6.5 hectares (16 acres) of property in central eastern
Brazoria County, Texas (Figure 1). The property is proposed for the construction of a meter
station. The Lead Federal Agency for the project has been identified as the United States
Army Corps of Engineers (USACE), Galveston District.
An Antiquities Code of Texas Permit was not required for this project. However, all work was
conducted following accepted standards set forth by the Texas Historical Commission (THC)
and the Council of Texas Archeologists (CTA), and in accordance with section 106 of the
National Historic Preservation Act (NHPA).

2.0 ENVIRONMENTAL SETTING
2.1 Physiography and Geomorphology
The Texas Coastal Plain makes up part of the larger Gulf Coastal Plain, a low, level to gently
sloping region extending from Florida to Mexico. The Texas Coastal Plain reaches as far north
as the Ouachita uplift in Oklahoma, and as far west as the Balcones escarpment in central
Texas. The basic geomorphic characteristics of the Texas coast and associated inland areas,
which includes Brazoria County, resulted from depositional conditions influenced by the
combined action of sea level changes from glacial advance in the northern portions of the
continent, and subsequent downcutting and variations in the sediment load capacity of the
regionâs rivers. Locally, Brazoria County is underlain by relatively recent sedimentary rocks
and unconsolidated sediments ranging in age from the Miocene to Holocene (Abbott 2001;
Van Siclen 1991).
Although older geologic units have been identified in the region (see Abbott 2001; Barnes
1982; Van Siclen 1991), units relevant to the study of long-term human occupation in modernday Brazoria County include the Beaumont Formation, generally believed to predate human
occupation in the region, the so-called âDeweyville Terracesâ, stratigraphically positioned
between the Beaumont and Recent deposits, and Recent deposits. Quaternary Alluvium
underlies the project area (Barnes 1982). These deposits are made up of clay, silt, and sand.
This includes stream channel, point bar, natural levee, back swamp, and mud flat deposits
(Barnes 1982). Gilgae, a succession of microbasins and microknolls in generally level areas or
microvalleys and microridges parallel to the slope are common microfeatures.
The date of deposition for the Deweyville Terraces is not known. However, Abbott (2001:16)
among others believes the north-south oriented terraces aggraded during the Late Pleistocene
from overbank deposition of rivers and streams including the ancient Brazos River prior to the
beginning of the Holocene. Abbott suggests that aggradation of this feature ended by
approximately 20,000 BP (Abbott 2001:106). However, meanders of rivers, including the
Brazos, cut valleys through these terraces regularly during the Holocene and then abandoned
them. This process leaves large, flat, open, and well drained areas favored for campsites.
While all depositional facies other than channels have the potential to preserve archaeological
sites, behaviorally, human activity favors well drained, sandy channel-proximal localities over
floodbasin muds (Abbott 2001:126). Other Recent or Holocene deposits on the Gulf Plain
typically result from overbank flooding of extant streams, eolian transport including dune
formation, and infilling of marshes.
The permit area is underlain by Quaternary alluvium and is within a talf. Closed depressions
frequently filled with water and pimple mounds represent the most significant relief in a talf.
The southern end of Galveston Island is located just over 16 kilometers (10 miles) south of the
project area. Scars of abandoned channels testify to the frequent avulsions during the period of
human occupation. At the end of the Pleistocene and beginning of the Holocene, sea level was
as much as 300 feet lower and the coast was much further south of the project area. At the
high stand, sea level reached ca. 3000 to 5000 years ago this area would have been submerged.
Hurricanes and other heavy rain and tidal surge events have caused ongoing erosion and
3

deposition at the project area. The dynamic depositional and erosional environment of the
project area has left a complex pattern of deposits spanning the entire period of human
occupation. This complexity means the age of surface deposits can vary greatly. For the same
reason the ages of subsurface deposits cannot be confidently predicted.

2.2 Soils
The area is underlain by Bernard-Edna complex and Edna-Aris complex soils. Bernard-Edna
complex (Be) is a mix of mainly Bernard clay loam and Edna fine sand (Crenweldge 1981).
The Bernard soil is found in flat and depressed areas while the Edna soil is found on ridges,
knolls, and pimple mounds. The surface layer of the Bernard clay loam is very dark gray clay
loam about 15 centimeters (6 inches) thick. Below this is a layer about 122 centimeters (48
inches) thick with the upper portion being very dark gray clay and the lower portion being
dark gray clay. This layer is followed by gray clay with yellowish brown mottles and calcium
carbonate concretions. Edna soils are formed in loamy, Pleistocene alluvium. The surface
layer of the Edna soil is dark grayish brown fine sandy loam about 25 centimeters (10 inches)
thick. Below this is an 86-centimeter (34-inch) thick layer of clay with the upper portion being
gray and the lower portion being olive gray. This layer is followed by gray sandy clay loam
with yellowish brown mottles (SSS NRCS USA 2010). These soils possess a low potential for
archaeological remains (Abbott 2001:22, 23).
Edna-Aris complex is primarily comprised of Edna and Aris series soils. Edna series soils are
described above. Aris soil is formed in ancient loamy to clayey alluvium. It has a friable,
neutral, dark grayish brown fine sandy loam surface layer about 18 centimeters (7 inches)
thick. The next layer extends 53 centimeters (21 inches) deep and is made up of friable,
slightly acidic, grayish brown fine sandy loam. Below this is a layer of firm, medium acid,
gray sandy clay loam that extends to a depth of 71 centimeters (28 inches). The layer that
follows is characterized by very firm, strongly acidic, dark gray clay containing mottles of red
and strong brown extending to a depth of 117 centimeters (46 inches). Aris soils have a low
geoarchaeological potential (Abbott 2001).

3.0 CULTURAL SETTING
Between the San Bernard River and Sabine Lake, most prehistoric sites near the coast consist
of shell middens found in estuaries or exposed in cutbanks along streams (Aten 1983;
Patterson 1985). Inland sites are more similar to generalized open campsites. In both areas,
sites are found near stream channels. Historic sites tend to reflect farm or homesteads,
generally dating to the mid-nineteenth century.

3.1 Prehistoric Periods
The cultural context of the upper coastal region is described by Aten (1983) and Story (1990).
This information is merged with the archaeological data here to give a complete picture of life
on the Upper Texas Coast. Along the Upper Texas Coast, the Paleoindian period begins
around 12,000 Before Present (B.P.) and ends near 9,000 B.P. (Aten 1983; Story 1990). The
population during this stage was highly mobile in response to the movement of food sources.
Isolated artifacts include Clovis, Angostura, Scottsbluff, Meserve, Plainview, and Golondrina
point types (Aten 1983).
The Transitional Archaic period begins about 9,000 B.P. and ends around 7,500 B.P. (Aten
1983; Story 1990). The Archaic stage is thought to include a shift towards a diet more geared
towards plant processing, but still included hunting (Story 1990). Beginning at 7,500 B.P. and
spanning 2,500 years (Aten 1983), the Early Archaic period in this region has not been well
documented. Points from this period include Bell, Carrollton, Trinity, Wells, and Early
Stemmed.
The Middle Archaic period from 5,000 to 3,000 B.P. is represented by the earliest surviving
shell middens (Aten 1983) in the area. These middens contain remains of shellfish, such as
oysters and estuarine clams, faunal material from terrestrial and aquatic vertebrates, and the
earliest known human burials in the region (Aten 1983). Characteristic projectile points
include Bulverde, Williams, Lange, and Pedernales types.
The Late Archaic lasted from 3,000 to 2,000 B.P. and shows evidence for population increase
(Aten 1983). Projectile points differ from earlier periods. Points associated with the Late
Archaic are corner-notched or have expanding-stems, such as the Kent, Ellis, and
Pontchartrain types. The transition from Late Archaic stage to Late Prehistoric is indicated by
the introduction of ceramics into the assemblage (Aten 1983). The cultural tradition during the
Late Prehistoric along the Upper Gulf Coast has been designated as Woodland. Story (1990)
has suggested the use of the term Mossy Grove Tradition to define cultural patterns of the
region. Story (1990) splits the Mossy Grove Tradition into five distinct time intervals on the
coast, while noting that only 2 are found inland.

3.2 Historic Period Brazoria County
Before European colonization of this region, it was occupied by the Karankawa Indians. Five
different subgroups of Karankawa Indians, with the northern most tribe called the Cocos, lived
in the area of modern day Brazoria County (Ricklis 2004).
5

In 1528, Alvar Nunez Cabeza de Vaca landed on San Luis Island and crossed the Brazos River
in the area that would become Brazoria County. Many other Spanish explorers passed through
the area, like Alonso De Leon in 1689, looking for the lost La Salle expedition and in 1727
Joaquin de Orobi y Basterra came through looking for French intruders in the Trinity River
area.
Stephen F. Austin and 89 of Austinâs Old Three Hundred settled the area in 1824. Some of the
earliest communities were Velasco, Brazoria, and Columbia. It was in Velasco, soon after the
Battle of San Jacinto, that General Santa Anna signed the Treaties of Velasco with the
Republic of Texas on May 14, 1836. Under this newly formed provisional government came
the formation of the first counties in Texas, among them Brazoria County, taking its name
from the Brazos River (Handbook of Texas, Online 2010). Between 1849 and 1859, the
county of Brazoria flourished. The county became the wealthiest in Texas due in part to its
largely southern society based on plantation life and slavery. Agriculture was the foundation
for the countyâs economy based primarily on sugar and cotton (Handbook of Texas, Online
2010).
Prior to the Civil War, the majority of residents favored secession, which paved the way for
new industries to be organized to help the Confederate Army, such as the Dance Brothers gun
works manufacturing shop. Up until the time of the Great Depression, most Brazoria County
residents made their living from agriculture with a maximum number of farms in 1940
reaching 3,065. A major boom for the economy came from the greater production of rice. By
1940, the total acreage for rice had risen from 6,000 acres to approximately 16,000 acres and
became the nationâs number one rice producing area (Handbook of Texas, Online 2010).
Brazoria County established its first school in 1827, followed by the Brazoria Academy in
1839. Academia became an integral part of the county around 1900 with the introduction of 8
independent school districts employing 200 teachers to educate the countyâs 6000 students.
The results of the countyâs educational efforts can be seen in the statistics of 1950 where only
23% of the population had completed high school, but in 1982 more than 65% percent had
graduated from high school (Handbook of Texas, Online 2010).
Now Brazoria County offers an assortment of recreational activities, everything from fishing,
hunting, boating, skiing, and an array of other water sports. In conjunction, they also offer
access to historic sites such as the Varner-Hogg Plantation State Historical Park.

METHODOLOGY

4.1 Site File and Literature Review
The site file research and literature review was performed in order to identify all previously
recorded archaeological sites and previous investigations within a 1.6-kilometers (1-mile)
study radius of the permit area and all recorded historic structures eligible for the National
Register of Historic Places (NRHP) listing located adjacent to the area. This work was
conducted at appropriate repositories including the Texas Archeological Research Laboratory
(TARL) in Austin, Texas and by reviewing online data available on the Texas Archaeological
Sites Atlas maintained by the THC.
This work was used to provide a historic context to the archaeological survey and additional
documentary research was conducted in order to provide an understanding of the development
and history of the area and southeast Texas in general. This research then was used to prepare
an overview history of the area and provided an understanding of the contextual framework of
Brazoria Countyâs prehistory and history.

4.2 Field Methods
All work was conducted following accepted standards set forth by the THC, the CTA, and the
NHPA. Per THC guidelines, minimum standards for subsurface testing on linear projects call
for 16 shovel tests per mile (1.6 kilometers) per 100-foot width of survey area. Area surveys of
11-100 acres require 1 shovel test for every 2 acres under the minimum survey standards. The
access road was treated as a linear survey and the meter station pad was considered an area
survey for purposes of calculating the required number of shovel tests. Investigation consisted
of systematic surface inspection and shovel testing. Surveyors walk along a single transect
down the center of the access road and at predetermined evenly spaced observation points
shovel tests were excavated or the surface examined if the location was inundated or
disturbed. East-west transects were spaced 30 meters apart across the irregularly shaped meter
station pad for full coverage. Observation points were evenly spaced but conforming to the
shape of the pad to meet minimum survey standards. Field conditions required modification
of the initial methods because of wide spread inundation of the permit area. The details of the
modification are explained in the âRESULTSâ section below.
In general, each shovel test measured 30 centimeters (12 inches) in diameter and excavated to
a maximum depth of approximately 1 meter (3 feet) or until saturated soils prevented
excavation. Descriptions of soil texture and color followed standard terminology and the
Munsell (2005) soil color charts. Profiles were recorded for each shovel test and notes were
recorded concerning the soil stratigraphy and any cultural resources encountered. All sediment
contained a high percentage of clay content and was hand sorted and/or divided by trowel. A
handheld Global Positioning System (GPS) receiver capable of sub-meter accuracy data
recording was used to assist in locating the project boundary and to map survey results.
Mechanical deep testing was not planned because the impacts of the project are expected to be
1 meter (3 feet) deep or less.
7

Although no cultural resources were discovered as a result of this survey, the following site
boundary techniques would have been used. Additional delineation shovel tests would have
been excavated in 4 radiating directions in intervals between 10 and 30 meters (33 and 100
feet) within the confines of the study corridor. In general, 2 sterile shovel tests would have
been used to define a siteâs size and location. With reference to THC guidelines, a minimum
between 6-8 delineation shovel tests would be excavated unless surrounding landforms or
topography suggested the presence of a natural site boundary. An official Texas site form
would have been completed and submitted to the TARL, and a site trinomial would have been
obtained from TARL for each newly recorded site.

8

5.0 RESULTS OF INVESTIGATIONS
The purpose of the site file and literature review was threefold; 1) determine if any previously
identified cultural resources or National Register properties were located within the permit
area or the 1.6-kilometer (1-mile) study radius around the proposed permit area; 2) determine
if any surveys were previously completed in the permit area or the study radius and; 3) use
these results to develop an appropriate field survey strategy to identify and record any
previously unidentified cultural resources within the permit area. Field investigations were
conducted to locate any sites in the permit area that were not previously identified and to
assess any existing sites for eligibility to the National Register of Historic Places (NRHP).

5.1 Results of Site File and Literature Review
The site file review resulted in finding no previously recorded prehistoric archaeological sites
located within the study radius defined as the area within 1.6 kilometers (1 mile) of the APE
(Figure 1). The closest recorded site is Site 41BO41 and is located about 6 kilometers (3.7
miles) north of the project area. It is recorded as a prehistoric shell midden. No historical
markers or cemeteries are located within the study radius. One linear survey has been
completed within the study radius. The survey area is south and east of the permit area and
was conducted for USACE in 1979 but no additional information is available.

5.2 Results of Field Investigations
The 6.5-hectare (16-acre) permit area is divided between an access road and the pad for the
meter station (Figure 2). The road was considered a linear survey for purposes of calculating
the minimum number of shovel tests required by the THC. The pad was considered an area
survey for these same purposes. At 450 meters (1,475 feet) long and 30 meters (100 feet) wide
the minimum number of shovel tests required by the THC guidelines for the road portion is 5
(1475/5280*16=4.46). At 1 shovel test per .8 hectares (2 acres) of area survey for the 5.25hectare (13-acre) pad, 7 shovel tests are required. Together the number of shovel tests required
by the THC minimum survey standards for this APE is 12. A total of 9 shovel tests were
excavated within the permit area. Three of the planned 12 shovel tests were not excavated due
to inundation. No cultural resources, features, or historic structures were encountered during
shovel testing.
A single transect was positioned in the center of the access road and observation points were
spaced every approximately 100 meters (325 feet). However, rather than using all of the
predetermined observation points, shovel tests were placed laterally off of the transects on the
highest point of land. This was necessary because the permit area was largely inundated and
most of the predetermined observation points were inundated. This same inundation affected 6
of the 7 predetermined observation points within the pad. In order to cover the pad area more
completely, the predetermined observation points were abandoned and all dry locations were
shovel tested. Two of these shovel tests found disturbed sediments probably due to previous
pipeline construction. A third location filled with water at 30 centimeters (12 inches) below
the surface.

Shovel tests were excavated to a maximum depth of 100 centimeters (32 inches) below the
surface. All tests not terminated due to water or disturbances were dug to this maximum depth.
All of the shovel tests returned negative results. No artifacts were found on the surface in any
part of the permit area. Two distinct soil profiles were recorded. The first consisted of a
surface layer of very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) silty clay loam to an average depth of 20
centimeters (8 inches). Below that was a 20 centimeters (8 inches) thick layer of brown (10YR
4/3) clay with iron depletion and concentration mottling. A 20-centimeter (8-inch) thick level
of dark grayish brown (10YR4/2) clay that is also mottled underlies this level and a
prominently mottled level of silty clay loam. The roughly even mottling was mostly light
brownish gray (10YR6/2) to brownish yellow (10YR6/6) and dark yellowish brown
(10YR3/4). The second common profile was comprised of a 20 to 30-centimeter (8 to 12-inch)
thick dark brown 10YR3/3 silty clay loam underlain by mottled silty clay. Colors were
primarily dark brown (10yr 3/3) and dark grayish brown (10YR4/2) clay loam with shades of
red and gray.
The first profile is consistent with Bernard soil mapped for the area. The second common
profile does not conform to any of the soils mapped for the area. There was no obvious
explanation for why the second profile does not conform to mapped soils. Soil profiles in
access road part of the permit area appear to have 20-centimeter (8-inch) plow zones. Two
shovel tests in the pad part of the permit area revealed disturbed soil profiles. The proximity of
pipelines in the area leads to the conclusion that the disturbances in the pad area were due to
the pipeline construction. Although fewer than the planned number of shovel tests were
excavated, the permit area was well tested.

6.0 CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS
This report presents the results of a cultural resources survey of 6.5 hectares (16 acres) of
property in Brazoria County, Texas. The Lead Federal Agency for this project has been
identified as the USACE, Galveston District. No Antiquities Code of Texas Permit was
required. All work was conducted following accepted standards set forth by the THC, the
CTA, and the NHPA.
As a result of the investigation, the entire permit area was surveyed and required a total of 20
person hours to complete. During survey, 9 shovel tests were excavated. The other planned
tests were not excavated due to inundation. Shovel testing demonstrated plow zones in the
access road and disturbance from pipeline construction in the pad part of the permit area. No
new or previously-recorded cultural resources, including buried archaeological sites and
historic structures, were identified during the survey. No above-ground historic structures
were recorded within or adjacent to the permit area as a result of survey. Frequent flooding
occurs on the low-lying permit area just 16 kilometers (10 miles) from the Gulf shore. The
frequent flooding has a direct impact on site survival.
Based on these results, no prehistoric or historic cultural resources will be affected by the
proposed project. HRA Gray & Pape recommends no further work within the surveyed area
and that the project be allowed to proceed as planned.
