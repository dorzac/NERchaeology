ABSTRACT
On behalf of River City Engineering and Canyon Regional Water Authority (CRWA), SWCA
Environmental Consultants (SWCA) conducted an intensive cultural resources survey for Phase III of the
proposed CRWA Wells Ranch Santa Clara to Wagner Transmission Line Project in Guadalupe County,
Texas. Located in northwestern Guadalupe County, the project area is between Farm to Market 78 (FM 78)
and Interstate Highway 10 (IH 10), and about 2 miles southwest of Marion, Texas. The work was conducted
on behalf of CRWA, a political subdivision of the State of Texas, as part of their compliance with the
Antiquities Code of Texas under Permit Number 6683. Additionally, the project is subject to compliance
with the National Historic Preservation Act in anticipation of a permit from the U.S. Army Corps of
Engineers Fort Worth District under Nationwide Permit 12 and Section 404 of the Clean Water Act, in
accordance with 33 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) Part 325, Appendix C (Processing Department of
Army Permits: Procedures for the Protection of Historic Properties; Final Rule 1990; with current Interim
Guidance Documents dated April 25, 2005, and January 31, 2007).
The CRWA proposes to install a new 16-inch-diameter water main line within existing CRWA easements,
other utility easements, and private property. Installation of the pipeline will require trenching and boring
within the 50-foot-wide construction easement. Typically, trenching impacts would be 6–7 feet deep, while
bore pits would be 8–10 feet deep. The area of potential effects (APE) is approximately 4.2 miles in length
and 50 feet wide (25.5 acres) with vertical impacts ranging in maximum depth from 6–10 feet deep.
The investigations included a background review and an intensive pedestrian survey with shovel testing of
the project area boundaries. The background review determined that the project area intersects one
previously conducted cultural resources survey and is adjacent to two previously conducted cultural
resources surveys. A review of historic maps dating from 1921 and 1958 indicate there were several
historic-age resources adjacent to the proposed alignment between Lower Seguin Road and Santa Clara
Road. SWCA archaeologists examined the entire APE, with the exception of 0.75 mile that was unavailable
due to lack of land owner permission and access. Overall, the intensive pedestrian survey revealed that the
proposed project area is within a rural setting intersected by fence lines, overhead utility lines, existing
underground utilities, and road ways. Almost the entire APE consisted of plowed fields, affording 100
percent ground visibility with a few areas consisting of overgrown fallow fields. A total of 39 shovel tests
were excavated within the available APE. Shovel tests were excavated to depths ranging from 20–70
centimeters below surface and consisted of clay and silty clay loam. Many shovel tests terminated at
compact clay. The Texas Historical Commission survey standards for projects of this size recommend 16
shovel tests per linear mile where the right-of-way measures 100 feet wide, or 68 shovel tests for the project
area. Due to high ground surface visibility and previous disturbances within the APE, SWCA did not
excavate all planned shovel tests, as subsurface exploration was not warranted in certain areas, including
the 0.75 mile portion that was unavailable for access. The 0.75 mile portion is entirely within disturbed
plowed fields with 100 percent ground surface visibility on an upland landform. Further investigations are
unwarranted due to the high level of previous disturbances eliminating the potential of encountering
significant cultural resources.
SWCA recorded three new sites during the investigations: one prehistoric site (41GU160) and two historic
sites (41GU161 and 41GU162). Site 41GU160 is a sparse, prehistoric lithic scatter. Sites 41GU161 and
41GU162 are historic artifact scatters likely associated with nearby farmsteads. Although the significance
of the nearby farmsteads has not been determined, the sites lack all aspects of integrity to be considered as
a contributing resource to the farmsteads. Overall, all the sites have been continually disturbed by
agricultural activities and have little to no research value. All three sites are recommended not eligible for
inclusion to the NRHP or designation as State Antiquities Landmarks (SAL) based a lack of cultural
integrity and research potential, as well as overall prior disturbances.

i

In accordance with 36 CFR 800.4, SWCA has made a reasonable and good faith effort to identify cultural
resources properties within the APE. As no properties were identified that meet the criteria for listing in the
NRHP, according to 36 CFR 60.4, or for designation as an SAL, according to 13 TAC 26.8, SWCA
recommends no further cultural resources work within the project area.

CULTURAL RESOURCE INVESTIGATIONS
Phase III of the Canyon Regional Water Authority Wells Ranch Santa Clara to Wagner Transmission Line Project

INTRODUCTION

PROJECT AREA DESCRIPTION

SWCA Environmental Consultants (SWCA)
conducted an intensive cultural resources survey for
Phase III of the Canyon Regional Water Authority
(CRWA) Wells Ranch Santa Clara to Wagner
Transmission Line in Guadalupe County, Texas.
The project area is located 2 miles southwest of
Marion, Texas between Interstate Highway 10 (IH
10) and Farm-to-Market (FM) 78 (Figure 1).

The proposed alignment begins just south of FM 78
and east of Deer Meadow Drive near two water
tanks, approximately 0.69 mile west of the FM 78
and South Santa Clara Road (FM 315) intersection.
From this boundary, the transmission line extends
south for 4.3 miles across agricultural fields,
undeveloped property, and intersects Town Creek,
Pfannsteil Lane (FM 317), Lower Seguin Road (FM
318), Schmoekel Road (FM 310), and Bolton Road
(FM 308) terminating northwest of IH 10.

The work was conducted on behalf of the River
City Engineering and CRWA, a political
subdivision of the State of Texas, as part of their
compliance with the Antiquities Code of Texas
under Permit Number 6683. Additionally, the
project is subject to permitting requirements
through the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers
(USACE) Fort Worth District under Section 404 of
the Clean Water Act, Nationwide Permit 12. As
such, the investigations are designed to comply
with Section 106 of the National Historic
Preservation Act (NHPA), as amended, and its
implementing regulations (36 Code of Federal
Regulations [CFR] Part 800).

Located in western Guadalupe County, the project
area is within the Guadalupe-San Antonio River
Basin and is intersected by Town Creek and an
unnamed tributary of Santa Clara Creek. The area
is within gently sloping topography between Cibolo
Creek and Santa Clara Creek. The project area is
generally within a rural, agricultural setting (Figure
2). The agricultural fields within the project area
have been recently plowed, with the exception of a
few fallow fields that are currently overgrown. The
northernmost section of the project area is currently
used as pasture for grazing cattle. The proposed
transmission line also runs adjacent to several
manmade ponds.

The CRWA proposes to replace and install a new
16-inch-diameter water main line within existing
CRWA easements, other utility easements, and
private property. Installation of the pipeline will
require trenching and boring within the 50-footwide construction easement. Typically, trenching
impacts would be 6–7 feet deep, while bore pits
would be 8–10 feet deep. The area of potential
effects (APE) is approximately 4.2 miles in length
and 50 feet wide (25.5 acres) with vertical impacts
ranging in maximum depth from 6–10 feet deep.

GEOLOGY
Geologically, the project area is mapped as 95
percent Quaternary-age Leona Formation and 5
percent Upper Cretaceous-era Navarro Group and
Marlbrook Marl Undivided. The Leon Formation
consists of fluviatile terrace deposits of gravel,
sand, silt and clay (Barnes 1983). The Navarro
Group and Marlbrook Mark undivided deposits are
comprised of mark, clay, sandstone, and siltstone
with a thickness of up to 580 feet (Barnes 1983).

The investigations consisted of an intensive
archaeological survey with shovel testing of the
proposed APE. All investigations were conducted
in accordance with Texas Historical Commission
(THC) and Council of Texas Archeologist (CTA)
standards, as well as the guidelines provided in
Section 106 of the NHPA. Laura I. Acuña served as
Principal Investigator. Laura I. Acuña, Katie Sloan,
and Sofia Salgado conducted field work on October
17th and 18th, 2013.

SOILS

PALEOINDIAN PERIOD

The project area soils are mapped as 85 percent
Branyon Clay with 0–1 percent slopes (NRCS
2013). These very deep, well drained, and very
slowly permeable soils are formed in calcareous
clayey sediments (NRCS 2013). They are located
on nearly level to very gently sloping Pleistocene
terraces. Ten percent of the project area is mapped
as Houston Black Clay with 1–3 percent slopes
(NRCS 2013). These are very deep, moderately
well drained, and very slowly permeable soils that
formed from weakly consolidated calcareous clays
and marls of Cretaceous Age. They are located on
nearly level to moderately sloping uplands (NRCS
2013). The remaining five percent of the project
area is mapped as Tinn Clay with 0–2 percent
slopes (NRCS 2013). These frequently flooded
soils are very deep, moderately well drained, and
very slowly permeable soils that formed in
calcareous clayey alluvium. They are located on
flood plains of streams that drain the Blackland
Prairies (NRCS 2013).

Human occupation of the Central Texas
archaeological region is thought to have begun
approximately 11,000 years ago. This period
correlates with the end of the Late Pleistocene, the
last ice age in North America. These early Texans
are characterized by small but highly mobile bands
of foragers who were specialized hunters of
Pleistocene megafauna; however, Paleoindians
probably used a much wider array of resources,
including small fauna and plant foods (Bever and
Meltzer 2007; Bousman et al. 2002; Bousman et al.
2004; Dering 2007; Meltzer and Bever 1995).
Faunal remains from Kincaid Rockshelter and the
Wilson-Leonard site (41WM235) support this view
(Collins 1998; Collins et al. 1989).
Surficial and deeply buried sites, rockshelter sites,
and isolated artifacts represent Paleoindian
occupations in the central Texas region. Although
Paleoindian site types are not well documented in
the region, they can be generally classified
according to broad site type categories extrapolated
from nearby regions. Both open and protected
(rockshelter) types are known. Usually, these sites
are near permanent sources of water such as
tributary creeks or springs. Bison kill sites, open
and protected campsites, and non-occupation lithic
sites are known from the Paleoindian period in
Texas. Intra-site features include hearths and
isolated burials. The Wilson-Leonard site
(41WM235), 41BX52, and 41BX229 contain
stratified Paleoindian deposits (Hester 1980). The
lower component at the Wilson-Leonard site
contained a Paleoindian burial (Collins et al. 1998).

CULTURAL HISTORY
The project area is located within the northern
limits of the South Texas archaeological region and
adjacent to the western limits of the Central Texas
archaeological region as defined by Perttula (2004).
Given its proximity to the Central Texas
archaeological region, the following prehistoric
cultural history derives its information from several
central Texas regional chronologies: Black (1989),
Collins (1995, 2004), and Johnson and Goode
(1994), which build upon the seminal efforts of
Suhm (1960) and Prewitt (1981, 1985). Significant
archaeological sites within the Central Texas
archaeological region and the Edwards Plateau
have contributed important information to
understanding prehistory.

ARCHAIC PERIOD
The Archaic period for the Central Texas
archaeological region dates from ca. 8800 to 1300–
1200 B.P. (Collins 2004) and generally is believed
to represent a shift toward hunting and gathering of
a wider array of animal and plant resources and a
decrease in group mobility (Willey and Phillips
1958:107–108). For central Texas, this notion of
the Archaic is somewhat problematic. An
increasing amount of evidence suggests that
Archaic-like adaptations were in place before the
Archaic period (Bousman et al. 2002; Collins

The following prehistoric cultural sequence is
divided into three periods: Paleoindian, Archaic,
and Late Prehistoric. The Archaic period is
subdivided into four subperiods: Early, Middle,
Late, and Transitional. The Historic period follows
the Late Prehistoric, announcing the arrival of
Europeans to central Texas.

CULTURAL RESOURCE INVESTIGATIONS

2004:117–118, 1998; Collins et al. 1989) and that
these practices continued into the succeeding Late
Prehistoric period (Collins 2004:118–119; Prewitt
1981:74). In a real sense, the Archaic period of
central Texas is not a developmental stage, but an
arbitrary, chronological construct and projectile
point style sequence. Establishment of this
sequence is based on several decades of
archaeological investigations at stratified Archaic
sites along the eastern and southern margins of the
Edwards Plateau. Collins (2004) and Johnson and
Goode (1994) have divided this sequence into three
parts—early, middle, and late—based on perceived
(though not fully agreed upon by all scholars)
technological, environmental, and adaptive
changes. However, Turner and Hester (1999) and
Black (1989) have designated another period at the
end of the Archaic, referred to as Transitional
Archaic or Terminal Archaic.

practice probably was related to cooking plant
foods, particularly roots and bulbs, many of which
must be subjected to prolonged periods of cooking
to render them consumable and digestible (Black et
al. 1997:257; Wandsnider 1997; Wilson 1930).
Botanical remains, as well as other organic
materials, are often poorly preserved in Early
Archaic sites, so the range of plant foods exploited
and their level of importance in the overall
subsistence strategy are poorly understood. But
recovery of charred wild hyacinth (Camassia
scilloides) bulbs from an Early Archaic feature at
the Wilson-Leonard site provides some insights
into the types of plant foods used and their
importance in the Early Archaic diet (Collins 1998).
MIDDLE ARCHAIC
Cultural patterns during the Middle Archaic period
(6000–4000 B.P.) point toward an increased
sedentary population intensively harvesting acorns,
prickly pear, and pecans and hunting small and
medium-size game such as deer and turkey. The
increase in the number of Middle Archaic sites and
burials supports the concept of a larger, more
sedentary population (Black and McGraw 1985;
Prewitt 1981:73; Weir 1976:124, 135). Large bands
may have formed at least seasonally to occupy a
single area or small groups may have used the same
sites for longer periods (Weir 1976:130–131).

EARLY ARCHAIC
The Early Archaic period (8800–6000 B.P.) is better
documented than the Paleoindian period; however,
a complete understanding of cultural patterns does
not yet exist. Early Archaic sites are small, and their
tool assemblages are diverse (Weir 1976:115–122),
suggesting that populations were highly mobile and
densities low (Prewitt 1985:217). A variety of
choppers and gouges, such as the triangular,
concave-based bifaces known as Guadalupe tools
and the distally beveled Clear Fork unifaces are
present in the archaeological record. A variety of
expediency tools, often nothing more than utilized
flakes, are increasingly present in the Early Archaic
(Black 1989). It has been noted that Early Archaic
sites are concentrated along the eastern and
southern margins of the Edwards Plateau (Johnson
and Goode 1994; McKinney 1981). This
distribution may indicate climatic conditions at the
time, given that these environments have more
reliable water sources and a more diverse resource
base than other parts of the region.

Sites of the Middle Archaic are numerous and often
large in size. Burned rock middens are found at
many sites with Middle and Late Archaic
components in the Central Texas archaeological
region. The development of burned rock middens
toward the end of the Middle Archaic suggests a
greater reliance on plant foods, although tool kits
still imply a considerable dependence on hunting
(Prewitt 1985:222–226). Middle Archaic projectile
point styles include Bell, Andice, Calf Creek,
Taylor, Nolan, and Travis. Other artifacts from the
Middle Archaic are choppers, gouges, and
expediency tools such as the small, bifacial and
unifacial Clear Fork tools. Grinding stones and
bases, referred to as manos and metates, show up in
Middle Archaic artifact assemblages as well as a
number of perforators, drills, and awls. Chipped,
polished, and ground stone artifacts are common in
central Texas and surrounding regions. Less
frequently encountered artifacts include tools and

The construction and use of rock hearths and ovens,
which had been limited during the Paleoindian
period, become commonplace in the Early Archaic.
The use of rock features suggests that retaining heat
and releasing it slowly over an extended period was
important in food processing and cooking and
reflects a specialized subsistence strategy. Such a

and Hester 1999).

of post-2000 B.P. middens in the western reaches of
the Edwards Plateau (Goode 1991).

Bison populations decreased as more xeric
conditions returned during the latter part of the
Middle Archaic. Later Middle Archaic projectile
point styles (Nolan and Travis) represent another
shift in lithic technology (Collins 2004:120–121;
Johnson and Goode 1994:27). At the same time,
this shift to drier conditions saw the burned rock
middens develop, probably because intensified use
of geophytic or xerophytic plants meant the debris
from multiple rock ovens and hearths accumulated
as middens on stable to slowly aggrading surfaces,
as Kelley and Campbell (1942) suggested many
years ago. Johnson and Goode (1994:26) believe
that the dry conditions promoted the spread of
yuccas and sotols, and that it was these plants that
Middle Archaic peoples collected and cooked in
large rock ovens.

The use of rock and earth ovens (and the formation
of burned rock middens) for processing and
cooking plant foods suggests that this technology
was part of a generalized foraging strategy.
Considering the amount of energy involved in
collecting plants, constructing hot rock cooking
appliances, and gathering fuel, the caloric return of
most plant foods is relatively low (Dering 1999).
This suggests that plant foods were part of a broadbased diet (Kibler and Scott 2000:134) or part of a
generalized foraging strategy—an idea Prewitt
(1981) put forth earlier. At times during the Late
Archaic, this generalized foraging strategy appears
to have been marked by shifts to a specialized
economy focused on bison hunting (Kibler and
Scott 2000:125–137). Castroville, Montell, and
Marcos dart points are elements of tool kits often
associated with bison hunting (Collins 1968).
Archaeological evidence of this association is seen
at Bonfire Shelter in Val Verde County (Dibble and
Lorrain 1968), Jonas Terrace in Medina County
(Johnson 1995), Oblate Rockshelter in Comal
County (Johnson et al. 1962:116), John Ischy in
Williamson County (Sorrow 1969), and Panther
Springs Creek in Bexar County (Black and
McGraw 1985).

LATE ARCHAIC
During the succeeding Late Archaic period (4000
to 1300–1200 B.P.), populations continued to
increase (Prewitt 1985:217). As evidenced by
stratified Archaic sites such as Loeve-Fox, Cibolo
Crossing, and Panther Springs Creek, the Late
Archaic components contain the densest
concentrations of cultural materials of all the
Archaic periods. Establishment of large cemeteries
along drainages also suggests certain groups had
strong territorial ties (Story 1985:40).

TRANSITIONAL ARCHAIC
As Collins (2004:122–123) notes, diverse and
comparatively
complex
archaeological
manifestations toward the end of the Late Archaic
attest to the emergence of kinds of human conduct
without precedent in the area. This period (2250–
1250 B.P.), referred to as the Transitional Archaic
(Turner and Hester 1999) or Terminal Archaic
(Black 1989), is not recognized by all researchers.
Other chronologies terminate the Late Archaic at
around 1200–1250 B.P. (Collins 2004; Johnson and
Goode 1994) to encompass this later subperiod.
Johnson et al. (1962) originally designated the
Transitional Archaic as a subperiod of the Archaic
because of the similarities between the latest dart
point types and the earliest arrow point types. Since
then, however, the designation has failed to be
universally accepted by researchers. In two recent
chronologies for central Texas, Collins (2004) does
not include the Transitional as a subperiod of the

Middle Archaic subsistence technology, including
the use of rock and earth ovens, continues into the
Late Archaic period. Collins (2004:121) states that
at the beginning of the Late Archaic period, the use
of rock ovens and the resultant formation of burned
rock middens reached its zenith and that the use of
rock and earth ovens declined during the latter half
of the Late Archaic. There is, however, mounting
chronological data that midden formation
culminated much later and that this high level of
rock and earth oven use continued into the early
Late Prehistoric period (Black et al. 1997:270–284;
Kleinbach et al. 1995:795). A picture of prevalent
burned rock midden development in the eastern part
of the Central Texas archaeological region after
2000 B.P. is gradually becoming clear. This
scenario parallels the widely recognized occurrence

Archaic, and Johnson and Goode (1994) separate
the Late Archaic into two subperiods designated
Late Archaic I and Late Archaic II. The
Transitional Archaic, as it is used here, closely
corresponds to Johnson and Goode’s (1994) Late
Archaic II, but begins after the appearance of
Marcos points, not with it. In this scheme, the
Transitional Archaic coincides with the last two
style intervals recognized by Collins (2004) for the
Late Archaic subperiod.

LATE PREHISTORIC PERIOD
Introduction of the bow and arrow and later,
ceramics into the Central Texas archaeological
region marks the Late Prehistoric period (1250–350
B.P.). Population densities dropped considerably
from their Late Archaic peak (Prewitt 1985:217).
Subsistence strategies did not differ greatly from
the preceding period, although bison again became
an important economic resource during the latter
part of the Late Prehistoric period (Prewitt
1981:74). Rock and earth ovens were utilized for
plant food processing (Black et al. 1997; Kleinbach
et al. 1995:795). Horticulture came into play very
late in the region but was of seemingly minor
importance to overall subsistence strategies
(Collins 1995:385).

During the Transitional Archaic, smaller dart point
forms such as Darl, Ensor, Fairland, and Frio were
developed (Turner and Hester 1999). These points
were probably ancestral to the first Late Prehistoric
arrow point types and may have overlapped
temporally with them (Carpenter et al. 2006; Hester
1995; Houk and Lohse 1993).

Artifact assemblages include Scallorn, Perdiz, and
Edwards projectile points, worked stone, thermally
altered stone, hematite, bone, and shell. The points
are associated with the use of the bow and arrow in
the region, probably introduced sometime around
1350–1150 B.P.

Several researchers believe that the increased
interaction between groups at the end of the Late
Archaic was an important catalyst for cultural
change (Collins 2004; Johnson and Goode 1994).
This change may have included increased regional
stress and conflict between groups as interaction
became more frequent (Houk et al. 1997). In Bexar
County, for instance, researchers noted a distinct
shift in settlement patterns during this period (Houk
et al. 1997). Groups began to use hilltops as camps
rather than just lithic procurement locations. These
elevated locations would have provided points from
which to observe game and other groups of humans
as they moved through the surrounding creek
valleys and upland prairies (Houk et al. 1997).

The earlier Austin phase (identified by Scallorn and
Edwards points) and the later Toyah phase (defined
through Perdiz points) divide the Late Prehistoric
period throughout central Texas (Black 1989; Story
1990). These divisions were originally recognized
by Suhm (1960) and Jelks (1962) and remain an
accepted separation of the period. Although a
distinct change in the material culture between the
two phases can be seen in the archaeological record,
there is some debate over the cultural
underpinnings that prompted the change. The
different arrow point styles (and other associated
artifacts in the assemblage) may represent distinct
cultural groups (Johnson 1994), but others
challenge this view (e.g., Black and Creel 1997)
and attribute the change to a spread of new
technological ideas in response to the increase of a
different economic resource in bison populations
(Ricklis 1992). Nevertheless, prehistoric groups
traced through cultural remains assigned to the
Austin phase (1250–650 B.P.), as many of the
Archaic period cultures before them, relied on a
hunting and gathering subsistence with more of an
emphasis on gathering (Prewitt 1981:83). Groups
attributed to the Toyah phase (650–200 B.P.) relied
more on bison procurement (Prewitt 1981:84).

Overall, the Archaic period represents a hunting
and gathering way of life that was successful and
remained virtually unchanged for more than 7,500
years. This notion is based in part on fairly
consistent artifact and tool assemblages through
time and place and on resource patches that were
used continually for several millennia, as the
formation of burned rock middens show. This
pattern of generalized foraging, though marked by
brief shifts to a heavy reliance on bison, continued
almost unchanged into the succeeding Late
Prehistoric period.

Around 1000–750 B.P., slightly more xeric or
drought-prone climatic conditions returned to the
region and bison populations increased (Huebner
1991; Toomey 1993). Using this vast resource,
Toyah peoples were equipped with Perdiz pointtipped arrows, end scrapers, four-beveled-edge
knives, and plain bone-tempered ceramics. Toyah
technology and subsistence strategies represent a
completely different tradition from the preceding
Austin phase. Collins (1995:388) states that
formation of burned rock middens ceased as bison
hunting and group mobility reached a level not
witnessed since Folsom times. Although the
importance of bison hunting and high group
mobility hardly can be disputed, the argument that
burned rock midden development ceased during the
Toyah phase is tenuous. A recent examination of
Toyah-age radiocarbon assays and assemblages by
Black et al. (1997) suggests that their association
with burned rock middens represents more than a
“thin veneer” capping Archaic-age features. Black
et al. (1997) claim that burned rock midden
formations, although not as prevalent as in earlier
periods, was part of the adaptive strategies of Toyah
peoples.

(Chipman 2011; Foster 2012; Krieger 2002).
Although Cabeza de Vaca’s exact path is not clear,
some sources suggest his journey came through this
part of central Texas in 1534, but others indicate it
was farther south (Smryl 2013). Alonso de León,
whose expeditions were south of the project area,
named the Guadalupe River in 1689 in honor of the
Lady of Guadalupe from which Guadalupe County
was later named after (Foster 1995; Smryl 2013).
SPANISH COLONIAL PERIOD (A.D. 1630–1820)
Motivated more by a fear of French expansion than
anything else, the Spanish explored and established
missions in eastern and central Texas during the
latter part of the seventeenth century (Foster 1995).
The first Europeans to pass near the project area
were probably Spanish explorers and missionaries
with “sword and cross” coming northward from
Mexico City (Foster 1995; Weddle 1968). With the
exception of these Spanish expeditions or entradas
during the early Historic Period, although claimed
by Spain, Texas lacked an established Spanish
presence until around A.D. 1700 (Foster 1995).
These entrada routes followed established Indian
trade routes and were the genesis of the Spanish
road system throughout Texas. These Spanish roads
have been incorporated into the Texas highway
network that is in use today (Foster 1995:1).
Subsequent overland entradas into the eighteenth
century generally followed de Léon’s early route,
which became the Upper Presidio Road from 1795–
1850 (McGraw et al. 1991). This route generally
follows the IH 35 roadway, located northeast of the
project area.

HISTORIC CULTURE SETTING
Landscape features have dictated human movement
and subsistence patterns for thousands of years.
Specifically, geographical influences during the
Historic Period confined settlements to riparian
zones and limited farming to these areas. The
larger, rugged landscape was used for sheep, goat,
and cattle ranching. These practices were
introduced and promoted by the Spanish as part of
their colonial agenda and many were carried
through to the twentieth century, giving Texas a
strong agricultural history dominating economic,
social and cultural patterns over the years (Freeman
1994).

Spanish expeditions throughout the seventeenth
and eighteenth centuries established not only the
mission system but also introduced livestock and
ranching practices that would influence generations
of Texans. Sheep, goats, cattle, and hogs were
shipped in to create mission and private ranches.
These ranches were developed as a means to create
an autonomous settlement system in a relatively
hostile environment prone to attacks by the
Comanche, Apache, and Norteños.

The Historic period in this region (A.D. 1630 to
present) in Texas roughly begins when Europeans
first enter the region. However, several sixteenth
century expeditions have been reported to the area.
Most notably Alvar Nuñez Cabeza de Vaca’s
travels, stemming from the failed 1527 Panfilo de
Narvaez expedition. Cabeza de Vaca reportedly
lived and traveled with various aboriginal groups
across coastal and interior Texas around A.D. 1528

By the end of the eighteenth century, ranching
practices were on the rise. Spurred on by demands
from eastern markets, Texas ranches flourished. In
addition, east Texas missions were secularized in

8

CULTURAL RESOURCE INVESTIGATIONS
Phase III of the Canyon Regional Water Authority Wells Ranch Santa Clara to Wagner Transmission Line Project

1794, creating a greater need for meat and other
goods (Freeman 1994). As a result of the changing
economic and political environment, the
proliferation of private ranches increased over time.
One of the first land grants issued by the Spanish
government in the Guadalupe County area was to
Jose de la Baume in 1806, in Capote Hills (Smryl
2013). Eighteenth century Spanish ranching
practices were carried into the nineteenth century,
having an influence on European and American
settlers moving into Texas from both Europe and
the older states of the southeast.

By 1835, Texans were growing unhappy and
restless. The Mexican government had failed to
provide the liberal and democratic environment that
many European and American settlers had
envisioned. The republican ideals established in the
Constitution of 1824 were pushed aside and
replaced by a growing dictatorship lead by Antonio
López de Santa Anna. Texans decided to handle the
crisis swiftly by creating a series of assemblies and
a provisional government. Wrought with internal
strife, the Texans did not fully organize until a
convention meeting was held at Washington-onthe-Brazos on March 1, 1836. The convention
appointed Sam Houston as commander-in-chief of
the new Revolutionary Army and made rapid
decisions about a new government, a new
constitution, and the possibility of war (Nance
2011).

MEXICO AND THE REPUBLIC OF TEXAS (1821–
1845)
The beginning of the nineteenth century proved
difficult for Spain. The Napoleonic wars left the
country in an economic and political crisis, which
was greatly felt in the territories of New Spain.
After years of struggle, threats from the United
States to the north and east, and the breakdown of
government organization, Mexico finally gained its
independence in 1821 (de la Teja 2011).

The next several months would prove challenging
to the new government and Texas settlers. News of
the fall of the Alamo in early March 1836, reached
settlers quickly. South Central Texas was one of the
first areas affected by the news due to close
proximity to San Antonio. As Sam Houston
retreated in late March, settlers followed, creating a
large scale exodus out of Texas. Known as the
Runaway Scrape, the flight out of Texas continued
at a steady pace until the decisive Battle of San
Jacinto in late April. After Houston’s victory at San
Jacinto, settlers began to slowly make their way
back to their farms and ranches only to find missing
cattle and damaged property (Covington 2011).

Ranching practices began to shift even more during
this time with an influx of new settlers from the
southern United States and Europe. Under Spanish
law, foreigners were initially forbidden to settle in
Spanish lands. However, due to a dearth of settlers
willing to travel into the dangerous northern regions
of New Spain, the government made allowances.
By 1820, Texas was opened and settlers arrived in
waves under the authority of men like Stephen F.
Austin, taking advantage of cheap land and liberal
laws under Spain and then Mexico (Henson 2011).
The settlers’ influences added to methods of
breeding and herding practices in the area, building
on established Spanish colonial traditions. The
colonists also brought new crops and farming
practices with them. In fact, the anti-slavery ideals
of Mexico were set aside by Mexican officials in
Texas to lure Anglo settlers with the much-desired
agricultural practices from southern states. Settlers
also moved to Texas with the idea that the area
would soon be annexed by the United States and
would be a worthy investment as more people
moved west. Further, Texas functioned as a safe
haven from debt, granting debt-laden families and
individuals a clean start (Henson 2011).

By late 1836, Texas had defeated Mexico, created
a new constitution, and elected a new executive,
judicial, and legislative staff. Sam Houston led the
new Republic of Texas as president and Stephen F.
Austin acted as secretary of state. The new
government worked quickly to create the Texas
postal system, create an organized militia, and
establish the Republic of Texas boundaries. Sam
Houston also worked with land grant issues and
settlers rights. By the end of the Texas Revolution,
Texas had more than 251,000,000 acres of land as
public domain. This land was not only used to
support public works in the new Republic of Texas,
but also to encourage further settlement. Generous
grants were provided to veterans of the war. Land
grants of 1,280 acres for heads of families and 640
acres for single men were offered to settlers arriving

9

CULTURAL RESOURCE INVESTIGATIONS
Phase III of the Canyon Regional Water Authority Wells Ranch Santa Clara to Wagner Transmission Line Project

in Texas in 1836–1837. New settlers were required
to live in Texas at least 3 years to receive their land
title (Nance 2011). Texas also attempted to sell land
to new settlers well below the going rate at the time.
Running into organizational trouble with grants and
sales, the first homestead laws went into effect in
1839. This law granted 50 acres or one town lot to
every citizen or head of family (Nance 2011). Texas
veterans of the revolution were given land within
Guadalupe County for their service in the war. The
community of Walnut Springs, which later became
Seguin in honor of Juan N. Seguin in 1839, was
founded by a group of former Texas Rangers in
1838, along the northeast bank of the Guadalupe
River (Smyrl 2013) and 10 miles west of the project
area.

experiments with native and imported goats and
sheep produced hybrid animals suited to the Hill
Country environment. Capitalizing on their
successful breeding experiments, German families
often built mills to produce cloth. This effort was
timed perfectly to meet an increased demand for
wool cloth over cotton within the larger context of
the United States. Wool manufacturing techniques
were also becoming more streamlined, enabling
faster production. Further, low land prices and a
favorable climate lured ranchers from other parts of
the United States. These factors, in conjunction
with George Wilkins Kendall’s wool promotion
campaign activities, created the first sheep boom in
Texas. Cattle numbers were also on the rise and by
the onset of the Civil War; Texas had more than 3.5
million head, outnumbering all other states
(Freeman 1994). In Guadalupe County, livestock
and harvests increased as well as a shipping
business, which improved the overall economy
(Smryl 2013).

The Republic of Texas also encouraged larger
settlements of new immigrants through land grants
and colonization contracts. These efforts garnered
varying levels of success, but at a minimum, opened
the door to a wave of German immigrants into the
region that would last throughout the years of the
nineteenth century and create important cultural
and social contributions to development of the
Texas Hill Country. Much of the northern and
western parts of the Guadalupe County were settled
by German immigrants in the 1840s due to
colonization efforts by Prince Carl of SolmsBraunfels at New Braunfels (Smyrl 2013).

Until the early twentieth century, transportation and
circulation routes in Texas remained rudimentary
and fairly disconnected. Spanish Colonial roads
took advantage of existing Native American trails
initially to access interior portions of the territory.
Later, settlers from the United States and other
European countries continued to use established
trails and created new ones as they entered the
region. By the early to mid- nineteenth century,
most of the roads in Texas were created by
sustained use and ease of access rather than by
design (Wallace 2008).

ANTEBELLUM TEXAS AND THE UNITED STATES
(1845–1861)
In December 1845, Texas became part of the
United States. Texas would become a slave state
instead of a territory and also retain the ability to
keep public lands and debts. Texas would also have
the capability to divide into four additional states if
needed and the United States Navy would offer
protection along the Gulf coast. New statehood
created a flurry of activity and settlement.
Guadalupe County was initially organized as a
judicial county in 1842 by the Republic of Texas,
but was discontinued by the Texas Supreme Court
a year later. After annexation, the present county
was established from parts of Bexar and Guadalupe
counties in March 1846 (Smyrl 2013).

Efforts to create a coherent transportation system
began in the first years of the Republic of Texas.
The young Republic of Texas created a
Commissioner of Roads and Revenue along with
the Texas Rail Road Navigation and Banking
Company (Wallace 2008; Werner 2011). Lack of
funds plagued both, leaving existing roads in poor
condition with no hope for the establishment of new
circulation systems. Road development and
maintenance responsibility primarily fell to the
counties, which appointed a local overseer and
crew. This group of selected men, usually
comprised of local land owners, rotated every few
months. Therefore, road building in the early years
of the Republic of Texas and through the rest of the

German and Anglo-American settlers adapted
quickly to the new landscape. Breeding

CULTURAL RESOURCE INVESTIGATIONS
Phase III of the Canyon Regional Water Authority Wells Ranch Santa Clara to Wagner Transmission Line Project

nineteenth century was primarily a local endeavor,
shared by the community.

George Wilkins Kendall promoted goat and sheep
ranching in Texas. As a result, the industries
survived the war and went on to create a second
wool or sheep boom through the mid-1880s. Key
factors influencing the success of sheep ranching at
this time included the influx of both northern and
southern ranchers to the area, the removal and
destruction of the bison herds along with native
populations to the west (allowing for new, open
pastureland), and higher wool prices (Freeman
1994).

THE CIVIL WAR (1861–1865)
Texas was a divided state as the Civil War began in
1861. The new state had fought hard to be granted
admission to the Union, however, ties to the older
states of the south, including slavery and
agricultural practices, were strong. In fact, the
majority of the established and growing AngloAmerican population came from southern states.
This group saw the Civil War and the election of
President Abraham Lincoln as a threat to the State
of Texas and its southern heritage and institutions
(Campbell 2011).

However, in Guadalupe County there was an
economic decline right after the Civil War due to
the loss of taxable property, including slaves,
followed by declines in total farm acreage, farm
value, and livestock value. The construction of the
Galveston, Harrisburg and San Antonio Railway in
the mid-1870s gave the county an economic boost
supplying residents much needed access to markets.
The towns of Marion, Cibolo, and Schertz grew up
along the railroad (Smyrl 2013). Farmers could sell
livestock without the risks of cattle drives and they
could also import fencing supplies and heavy
ginning machinery for the cotton industry (Smyrl
2013).

Texas Hill Country counties were even more
divided with narrow margins winning in favor of
secession. At the Secession Convention held in
Austin in January 1961, Guadalupe County
approved the secession ordinance by a 314 to 22
margin. Nathanial Benton organized the first
Guadalupe County company to fight for the
Confederacy in 1861 (Smyrl 2013). However, the
vote against secession was led by the large number
of German settlers in the Hill Country west of
Guadalupe County. By 1861, Germans in Kerr,
Gillespie, and Kendall counties created the Union
League to organize groups to fight against local
native raids and Confederate threats. Seen as an act
of rebellion against the State of Texas and the
Confederacy, troops were called in to quell the
group. Finding themselves in a dangerous situation,
the Unionists decided to flee to Mexico. They were
intercepted and attacked by Confederate troops on
the Nueces River in Kinney County in what is now
known as the Battle of the Nueces. While the
division over succession and the outcome of the
Battle of Nueces (seen by many German settlers as
a massacre) created tensions between Anglo and
Germans even after the Civil War was over, the
counties in the Hill Country recovered from the war
quickly with successful agriculture and ranching
practices in place for future growth (Odintz 2011).

The development of ranching infrastructure also
helped establish the sheep, goat, and cattle
industries in the adjacent Hill Country. Railway
systems further aided ranching activities farther
west, creating access to the Edwards Plateau
(Freeman 1994). In fact, railroads would eventually
eclipse roads in focus and importance as they pulled
in funding from both the state and outside
resources. The Texas Railroad commission was
established in 1891 to regulate the powerful
railroad companies. By 1900, Texas had more miles
of track than any other state in the United States;
however, these lines still left much of the expansive
western half of Texas with little or no rail access
despite railroad growth (Werner 2011; Wallace
2008).
By the mid-1880s to early-1890s, the wool boom
and the cattle industry were in decline, brought on
by over-grazed grasslands; extreme weather
conditions, including drought and harsh winters;
and the introduction of barbed wire. In addition, the
Texas economy was heavily affected by the Panic
of 1893, which was a severe economic depression

RECONSTRUCTION AND GROWTH (1865–1899)
The Hill Country counties and settlements
recovered quickly from the Civil War. As
mentioned above, throughout the United States,

11

CULTURAL RESOURCE INVESTIGATIONS
Phase III of the Canyon Regional Water Authority Wells Ranch Santa Clara to Wagner Transmission Line Project

brought on by bank failures and over speculation in
railroad construction. Sheep and cattle ranchers
generally pulled through, reorganizing ranching
practices and creating support systems and
organizations for protection and promotion
(Freeman 1994). Diversification of ranching and
farming also became more popular. Ranchers
focused their attention specifically on mohair
production and Angora goats, setting the stage for
the growth and boom of that industry into the
twentieth century (Freeman 1994).

matching funding to states and a regulatory
partnership to assist with building plans (location,
design, and cost estimates). In response to these
acts, the Texas Highway Department was
established in 1917. Soon after, the Highway
Department would become the largest agency in the
state (Wallace 2008). By 1917, Texas was well on
its way to creating a new and complete highway
system. The system included several national
marked highway routes including the nascent Old
Spanish
Trail
Transcontinental
Highway
(American Highway Association 1917; Luther
2010).

THE EARLY TWENTIETH CENTURY—THE
ADVANCEMENT OF RANCHING AND
INFRASTRUCTURE (1900–1940)

Despite advancements made in infrastructure
technology and funding, ranching, and the nascent
tourism industry, the Great Depression took its toll
on the towns, farms, and ranches of the Texas Hill
Country. Because the area was primarily rural, the
effects of the depression were not felt initially.
However, by the early 1930s, changes occurred in
local economies. The Texas legislature responded
and in 1931, all state agencies were required to use
only American-made materials and machinery in all
new construction projects. The Texas Highway
Department worked together with the legislature to
ensure Texas firms and material suppliers received
all of the contracts for road and bridge work. As the
depression advanced, the state legislature and the
Texas Highway Department looked for other ways
to increase the number of jobs for out-of-work
Texans. In 1932, the Texas Highway Department
mandated that machines should be used as a last
result and all construction should be conducted by
hand when at all possible. In that same year, Texas
began to receive federal aid under the Emergency
Relief and Construction Act. Funding continued
under Roosevelt’s New Deal Programs, which
covered 100 percent of the costs and aided in
economic recovery throughout the state (Wallace
2008).

Smaller, adept, diversified farms and ranches
dominated the landscape of the Edwards Plateau by
1900. The “ranching triumvirate” of cattle, sheep,
and Angora goats set Texas at the national forefront
of ranching production (Freeman 1994: 18).
Agricultural crops, such as cotton, corn, wheat,
oats, and various grasses for hay production, further
diversified output, strengthening independent farms
and ranches (Freeman 1994).
As railways continued to be built well into the
twentieth century, new roads followed, creating a
linked network. Rails functioned as the “main
arteries of travel” and roads as “the veins” (Pratt
1910:106). Railroad companies soon realized that a
good road system could greatly aid their business
and they became one of the most ardent supporters
of the good roads movement (Wallace 2008). Road
systems also benefitted from the arrival of post
offices. The Rural Free Delivery (RFD) mail
system brought mail to isolated ranches and farms.
Postmen refused to use roads in poor conditions and
consistently reported conditions to the proper
authorities when they could not make their
deliveries. This system united rural roads and post
routes, engaging federal and state government
interests. This new level of involvement with roads
and their development stretched significantly
beyond the previous scope of county court control
(Wallace 2008).

Farms and ranches also suffered during the
depression. A severe drought in the early 1930s left
many farms and ranches in decline. The number of
unemployed residents in the area also increased,
more than doubling between 1930 and 1936
(Thompson 2011). Smaller towns and less
populated counties also saw a dramatic population
decrease and people moved to larger towns to look
for work (Smyrl 2011). In Guadalupe County,

The fate of road improvement and system
expansion was sealed with the introduction of the
automobile and the Federal Aid Road Act of 1916
and Act 99 of 1917. The new acts provided

12

CULTURAL RESOURCE INVESTIGATIONS
Phase III of the Canyon Regional Water Authority Wells Ranch Santa Clara to Wagner Transmission Line Project

farmers had to devote more land to corn and
livestock due to low yields of cotton combined with
the Great Depression (Smyrl 2013). Many farmers
and tenants were forced out during this period, with
farms losing nearly 50 percent of their value (Smyrl
2013). Despite the difficulties of the depression,
many ranches and farms survived with lands and
livestock intact. This is partly due to the push for
smaller, more diversified practices which began in
the early years of the twentieth century.

dams channeled water to generating plants which
provided electricity for the surrounding area. Lakes
Dunlap and McQueeny in Guadalupe County
formed by dams became popular recreational sites
and still are (Smyrl 2013).

THE MID-TWENTIETH CENTURY (1940S–1960S)

SWCA performed a cultural resources file records
review to determine if the proposed APE has been
previously surveyed for cultural resources or if any
archaeological sites have been recorded within or
adjacent to the APE. To conduct this review, an
SWCA archaeologist reviewed portions of the New
Braunfels East (299-414) and Geronimo (2997323) U. S. Geological Service (USGS) 7.5-minute
topographic quadrangle maps on the THC Texas
Archeological Sites Atlas (Atlas). This source
provided information on the nature and location of
previously conducted archaeological surveys,
previously recorded cultural resources, locations of
National Register of Historic Places (NRHP)
properties, sites designated as State Antiquities
Landmarks (SAL), Official Texas Historical
Markers, Recorded Texas Historic Landmarks,
cemeteries, and local neighborhood surveys. Aerial
photographs, Bureau of Economic Geology Maps,
and the Natural Resources Conservation Services’
(NRCS) Web Soil Survey were also examined. The
Texas Department of Transportation (TxDOT)
Historic Overlay was also reviewed to identify the
presence of potential historic-age structures.

METHODS
BACKGROUND REVIEW

Goat, sheep, and cattle ranching remained in the
forefront of Texas Hill Country and Guadalupe
County commerce well into the mid-twentieth
century. Agricultural crop production of wheat,
sorghum, cotton, pecans, and oats continued on
farms and ranches. Schleicher County gained
prominence in the mohair industry with the
establishment of the West Texas Woolen Mills in
Eldorado during this time and became one of the
State’s most important wool processing centers
(Smyrl 2011).
New commercial opportunities rose in the oil and
gas industry throughout the region while road and
electrical infrastructure steadily improved. The
years of 1941 and early 1942 saw a boom period for
highway construction. World War II later hampered
efforts due to a decrease in supplies, man power,
and revenue from automobile registration, but plans
were made for the future. As a result, delegates
from the Texas Good Road Association asked
Washington for $768 million for road repair due to
neglect during the years of the war. Congress
responded with a $1.5 billion dollar post-war
highway bill. Texas received the largest percentage
of these funds. Due to this, by the late 1940s, most
of the roads in the Texas Hill Country were paved
and new construction projects were completed in
record time (Wallace 2008).

ARCHAEOLOGICAL SURVEY
SWCA’s investigations consisted of an intensive
pedestrian survey with subsurface investigations
within the project area. Archaeologists examined
the ground surface, erosional profiles, and
exposures for cultural resources. Subsurface
investigations involved shovel testing in settings
with the potential to contain buried cultural
materials.

The smaller towns along the western edge of the
Hill Country attracted hunters and fishermen along
with other types of tourism. Tourism also greatly
influenced the steady population growth in the
region through the twentieth century (Thompson
2011; Smyrl 2011; Lich 2011). The Guadalupe
River was source of hydroelectric power developed
in the 1920s and early 1930s and privately owned

Shovel tests were systematically excavated within
the project area. THC survey standards call for the
excavation of 16 shovel tests per mile for linear
projects with a 100-foot-wide construction

easement or 68 shovel tests for the project area.
Shovel tests were approximately 30 centimeters
(cm) in diameter and excavated in 20-cm arbitrary
levels to 1 meter (m) in depth or to culturally sterile
deposits, whichever came first. The matrix was
screened through ¼-inch mesh. The location of
each shovel test was plotted using a handheld
Global Positioning System receiver and each test
was recorded on appropriate project field forms.

RESULTS
BACKGROUND REVIEW
The background review determined that the project
area intersects one previously conducted cultural
resource survey and is adjacent to two previously
conducted cultural resource surveys. There are no
previously recorded sites within the proposed
alignment. In addition, there are no previously
conducted surveys or previously recorded sites
within a 1-mile radius of the project area.

SWCA conducted a non-collection survey.
Artifacts were tabulated, analyzed, and documented
in the field, but not collected.

The project area intersects a linear survey along
Town Creek, conducted on behalf of the Texas
Water Development Board in 2006. No additional
information on this survey was available on Atlas.
Previously conducted surveys along FM 78 and IH
10 on behalf of TxDOT are adjacent to the northern
and southern termini of the proposed alignment,
respectively. Investigations along FM 78 were
conducted in 1993, for the reconstruction and
widening of the road (Atlas 2013). Survey
investigations were also conducted along IH 10 in
1991 (Atlas 2013).

SITE EVALUATIONS
All newly documented archaeological sites were
evaluated according to the National Register
Criteria for Evaluation (Criteria) as codified in 36
Code of Federal Regulations, Chapter 60.4, which
states:
The quality of significance in American
history,
architecture,
archeology,
engineering, and culture is present in
districts, sites, buildings, structures, and
objects that possess integrity of location,
design, setting, materials, workmanship,
feeling, and association and
(a) that are associated with events that have
made a significant contribution to the broad
patterns of our history; or
(b) that are associated with the lives of
persons significant in our past; or
(c) that embody the distinctive
characteristics of a type, period, or method
of construction, or that represent the work
of a master, or that possess high artistic
values, or that represent a significant and
distinguishable entity whose components
may lack individual distinction; or
(d) that have yielded, or may be likely to
yield, information important in prehistory
or history.

HISTORIC MAP REVIEW
A review of historic maps dating from 1921 and
1958 indicate there were several historic-age
resources adjacent to the proposed alignment
between Lower Seguin Road and Santa Clara Road.
Each of these resources contains at least two
buildings or outbuildings within a small cluster. A
1958 Army Services topographic map also depicts
these resources adjacent to the proposed alignment,
as well as an additional historic-age resource just
north of the Lower Seguin Road (Foster et al.
2006).
Figure 4. Overview of non-accessible property;
facing south-southeast.

A historic aerial map dating to 1955 correlates with
the structures depicted along Santa Clara Road on
the 1921 and 1958 topographic map. Recent aerials
indicate that one of the resources has been
destroyed while the other resources have been
expanded or altered. The project area traverses
between two manmade ponds depicted on the 1955
aerial map and the 1958 topographic map. Overall,
the historic map review indicated that the project
area has experienced very little development or
growth, thus maintaining its rural setting.

Field investigations encountered a mostly rural
environment consisting of large agricultural fields
and undeveloped parcels along much of the APE
(Figure 5). The northern portion of the project area
is intersected by several property fence lines, a
gravel road, and it also parallels an existing water
line. For approximately 1 mile of the alignment
from Pfannsteil Lane to Lower Seguin Road, the
existing water line runs parallel to the APE. Surface
and subsurface disturbance is prevalent throughout
the APE from agricultural activities, construction of
man-made ponds and a berm, and the water line
mentioned previously (Figure 6). A few portions of
the line are within fallow fields that have been
overgrown and vegetation is limited to few
mesquite trees and short pasture grasses. The
ground surface visibility was generally more than
70 percent and the surface exhibited evidence of
plowing.

ARCHAEOLOGICAL SURVEY
SWCA archaeologists conducted an intensive
archaeological survey with shovel testing of the
proposed 4.2-mile alignment (see Figure 3). The
entire APE was examined, with the exception of
0.75 mile, which was unavailable for survey due to
lack of land owner permission and access. This
portion of the APE is entirely within open plowed
fields and parallels an existing property fence line
(Figure 4). There are no stream channels or water
bodies that intersect this section of the project area
and it is entirely outside of the Santa Clara Creek
floodplain and terraces. Therefore, no further
investigations are warranted due to the level of
previous disturbances that have eliminated the
potential of encountering significant cultural
resources.

A total of 39 shovel tests were excavated. All but
one were negative for cultural material (Appendix
A). One shovel test (LA06) contained a metal hinge
at 20 cm below surface (cmbs). The shovel test was
excavated within a recently plowed area and within
newly recorded site 41GU161. The shovel test was
terminated at 40 cmbs due to extremely compact
basal clay. Additional shovel tests were excavated
to delineate the extent of the historic scatter and all
were negative.
Overall, shovel tests were excavated to depths
ranging from 20–70 cmbs and consisted of clay and
silty clay loam. Many shovel tests terminated at

16

CULTURAL RESOURCE INVESTIGATIONS

compact clay. The THC’s survey standards for
projects of this size recommend 16 shovel tests per
linear mile when the right-of-way (ROW) measures
100 feet wide, or 69 shovel tests for the project area.
Due to high ground surface visibility and previous
disturbances within the APE, SWCA did not
excavate all planned shovel tests, as subsurface
exploration was not warranted in certain areas. In
addition, 0.75 mile was unavailable for access due
to restricted land owner permission. Based on the
setting and previous disturbances within this
portion of the alignment, no further investigations
are recommended. Frequent agricultural activities
have eliminated the potential of encountering
significant cultural resources.

41GU160
Site 41GU160 is a prehistoric lithic scatter located
along the edge of a plowed corn field 5 miles south
of Cibolo, Texas (Figure 7). The site is in an
agricultural setting on a relatively flat landform
approximately 520 meters south of Town Creek.
The corn fields in the area have been recently
plowed, affording 100 percent ground surface
visibility (Figure 8).
Broken chert cobbles were scattered across the
surface of the field exhibiting evidence of plowing
activities. In addition, the two man-made ponds
depicted during the historic map review are
approximately 30 m north of the site and adjacent
to the project area.

SWCA recorded three new archaeological sites (a
prehistoric lithic scatter and two historic scatters)
within the project area. Discussed below, the sites
have been severely disturbed by agricultural
activities and have little to no research value. The
sites are recommended as not eligible for listing on
the NRHP or for SAL designation.

The artifact scatter was initially discovered during
the survey when a light concentration of flakes was
identified within the plowed field adjacent to a
property fence line. The site is approximately 131
m northwest-southeast by 15 m northeastsouthwest based on the extent of the surface scatter
and limits of the APE, respectively. It is likely that
the site extends outside of the project area,
dispersed by plowing activities. Due to the high
surface visibility, only three shovel tests were
excavated within the site and all were negative for
cultural material. The soils consisted of dark
grayish brown (10YR4/2) to dark brown (10YR2/2)
clay loam and dense clay. The disturbances of the
plow zone extend down to 25–35 cmbs followed by
dense basal clay.

Figure 9. Biface preform from site 41GU160.

Artifacts observed on the surface include
approximately seven burned limestone fragments,
two chert core fragments, three tertiary chert flakes,
two pieces of chert shatter, one broken chert biface
fragment, and one chert bifacial preform (Figure 9).
The materials were widely dispersed across the
plowed field along with natural chert cobbles with
flake scars, likely due to plowing activities. There
were no diagnostic artifacts or features observed
within the site. The artifacts suggest that the site is
a widely dispersed lithic scatter and possible
procurement site due to presence of naturally
occurring chert material.

The artifact assemblage is widely dispersed across
the plowed field and likely extends outside of the
APE. The level of disturbances has negatively
impacted the integrity of the site, eliminating the
possibility of identifying discreet activity areas.
Artifacts are limited to the surface and the soils and
setting of site lacks the potential of deeply buried
cultural deposits. The lack of diagnostic materials
and intact features suggest the site is a lithic scatter
and possible procurement site, which is typical of
the region. Given the lack of intact features,
diagnostic materials, and the potential for
significant subsurface deposits, the site contains
little to no research value. The site has limited
potential to yield information important to the
prehistory of the region. SWCA recommends that
41GU160 is not eligible for inclusion on the NRHP
or for SAL designation. As such, no further work or
avoidance is recommended for the site.

41GU160 SUMMARY
Site 41GU160 does not meet Criteria A, B, or C of
36 CFR 60.4, but SWCA evaluated the site for
eligibility under Criterion D, which considers its
ability to yield information important in prehistory
or history. Site 41GU160 is a small prehistoric
lithic scatter. Continual agricultural activities have
severely disturbed the site.

41GU161
Site 41GU161 is a historic artifact scatter located
within a plowed corn field approximately 5 miles
south of Cibolo, Texas (Figure 10). The site is on a
relatively flat landform, approximately 200 m west
of an unnamed drainage and 0.70 mile south of
Town Creek. The site is also approximately 560 m
south of 41GU160. Entirely within the agricultural
field, recent plowing afforded 100 percent ground
surface visibility (Figure 11). Natural chert cobbles,
broken and flaked by plowing, were observed on
the surface.

Figure 12. Artifact sample of 41GU161.

The historic site was initially discovered during the
survey when a light scatter of material was
identified on the surface. The site is approximately
151 m northwest-southeast by 15 m northeastsouthwest, based on the extent of the surface scatter
and limits of the APE, respectively. It is likely that
the site extends outside of the project area,
dispersed by plowing activities. Due to the high
surface visibility, a total of three shovel tests were
excavated within to delineate the site of which two
are within the site boundary. One shovel test (LA
06) was positive for cultural material and contained
a miscellaneous metal fragment between 0–10
cmbs. The soils consisted of dark grayish brown
(10YR4/2) to dark brown (10YR2/2) clay loam and
dense clay, terminating at basal clay.

The nearest homestead as depicted on the historic
map review is 0.35 mile east of the project area. A
1958 Army Map Service topographic map depicts a
two-track road from the homestead towards the site
(Figure 13). A 1921 USACE topographic map
indicates the site is within the H. Pfannstiel parcel
of land. The materials likely represent a trash dump
or scatter from the homestead dispersed by the twotrack road and subsequent agricultural activities.
Currently, a Pfannsteil descendent owns the
property where the site is located.
41GU161 SUMMARY
Site 41GU161 does not meet Criteria A, B, or C of
36 CFR 60.4, but SWCA evaluated the site for
eligibility under Criteria B and D, which considers
its association with significant persons and ability
to yield information important in history,
respectively. Although the site maybe associated
with a homestead located 0.35 mile to the east, there
are no structures or features within the site
boundaries. The historic map review indicates that
the site is within the H. Pfannsteil parcel of land,
and is still owned by a Pfannsteil descendent. A
review of historic resources revealed that the
Pfannsteil family has been in the area since the
early twentieth century. They are typical of the
ranching and farming families that settled in the
area. Additional research is needed to determine if
the family is significant and has contributed to the
history of the region. However, site 41GU161 is a
small early- to- mid- twentieth century historic
artifact scatter likely representing a trash scatter.

Artifacts observed on the surface include fragments
of ceramic whiteware (n=13), porcelain ceramics
(n=12), solarized amethyst glass (n=11), clear
vessel glass (n=10), window glass (n=4), stone
ware (n=2), decorated (n=2), and a metal fragment
(Figure 12). The materials date to the early to midtwentieth century, based on the presence of
solarized amethyst glass and whiteware materials.
Primarily residential materials, the assemblage
suggests the site is a debris scatter of a homestead
or farmstead. However, there were no historic
features or structures within or around the site.

Agricultural practices have continually impacted
and disturbed the site. Although the site may be
associated with the Pfannsteil farmstead, it lacks

shovel tests were negative for cultural material. The
soils consisted of dark grayish brown (10YR4/2)
clay loam and clay.

The artifact assemblage is widely dispersed across
the plowed field and likely extends outside of the
APE. The materials consist of early- to- midtwentieth century artifacts including white ware and
window glass suggesting the site is a trash scatter
from a residential homestead or farmstead. The
debris is widely dispersed due to plowing, which
has negatively impacted the integrity of the site,
eliminating the possibility of identifying discreet
activity areas. Further investigations are
unwarranted due to the high level of previous
disturbances eliminating the potential of
encountering significant cultural resources.

Artifacts observed on the surface include fragments
of solarized amethyst glass (n=9), ceramic plain
white ware (n=9), brown glass (n=4), porcelain
(n=3), metal (n=2), as well as a stoneware fragment,
an aqua glass shard, a clear vessel glass shard, a
white marble, and a porcelain figurine head (Figure
16). The materials date to the early- to- midtwentieth century based on the solarized amethyst
glass and white ware materials. The material are
likely a trash scatter associated with a farmstead
located approximately 121 m south of the site. The
farmstead contains a modern house and a historicage structure with associated out-buildings.

The site lacks intact features, structural remains,
and the potential to yield significant historic
research data. Based on these factors, the site has
limited potential to yield information important to
the history of the region. SWCA recommends that
41GU161 is not eligible for inclusion on the NRHP
or for SAL designation. As such, no further work or
avoidance is recommended for the site.

The farmstead is depicted on the 1958 Army Map
Service topographic map (Figure 17). A 1921
USACE topographic map indicates the site is
within the R. Schmoekel parcel. The artifacts are
household
debris—likely
associated
with
farmsteads—that were dispersed across the field by
plowing. Currently, a Schmoekel descendant owns
the property where the site is located.

41GU162
Site 41GU162 is a historic scatter located
approximately 0.60 mile northeast of the
intersection of Lower Seguin road and Pfannsteil
Lane and approximately 3.5 miles southeast of
Cibolo, Texas (Figure 14). The site is in an
agricultural setting on a relatively flat landform
approximately 0.42 mile southwest of an unnamed
drainage of Town Creek. Entirely within a recently
plowed field, the ground surface visibility is 100
percent (Figure 15). The site is near the intersection
of two different agricultural fields. Natural chert
cobbles, broken and flaked by plowing, were
observed on the surface.
The artifact scatter was initially discovered during
the survey when historic artifacts were encountered
on the surface. The site is approximately 101 m

41GU162 SUMMARY

The artifact assemblage is widely dispersed across
the plowed field and likely extends outside of the
APE. The materials consist of early- to- midtwentieth century artifacts including whiteware,
stone ware, and solarized amethyst glass,
suggesting the site is a debris scatter associated with
the residential homestead 121 m to the south. The
level of disturbances has negatively affected the
integrity of the site, eliminating the possibility of
identifying discreet activity areas. The lack of
structures and features suggest the site is a historic
trash scatter, which is typical of the region and
contains little to no research value.

Site 41GU162 does not meet Criteria A or C of 36
CFR 60.4, but SWCA evaluated the site for
eligibility under Criteria B and D, which considers
its association with significant persons and ability
to yield information important in history,
respectively. Although the site is likely associated
with the farmstead located to the south, there are no
features or structures within the site boundaries.
The historic map review indicates that the site is
within the R. Schmoekel parcel of land and is still
owned by a Schmoekel descendent. A review of
historic resources revealed that the Schmoekel
family has been in the area since the early twentieth
century. They are typical of the ranching and
farming families that settled in the area. Additional
research is needed to determine if the family is
significant and has contributed to the history of the
region. However, site 41GU162 is a small early- tomid- twentieth century historic artifact scatter that
has been continually affected and disturbed by
agricultural activities and likely represents a trash
scatter. Although the site may be associated with
the Schmoekel farmstead, it lacks integrity of
location, design, setting, materials, workmanship,
feeling, and association to be considered eligible for
listing on the NRHP or as a contributing component
to the Schmoekel farmstead.

The site lacks intact features, structural remains,
and the potential for containing significant historic
research data. Based on these factors, the site has
limited potential to yield information important to
the history of the region. SWCA recommends that
41GU162 is not eligible for inclusion on the NRHP
or for SAL designation. As such, no further work or
avoidance is recommended for the site.

Overall, the intensive pedestrian survey revealed
that the proposed project area is within a rural
setting intersected by fence lines, overhead utility
lines, existing underground utilities, and road ways.
Almost the entire APE consisted of plowed field
affording 100 percent ground visibility with a few
areas consisting of overgrown fallow fields. A total
of 39 shovel tests were excavated within the
available APE. Shovel tests were excavated to
depths ranging from 20–70 cmbs and consisted of
clay and silty clay loam. Many shovel tests
terminated at compact clay. The THC’s survey
standards for projects of this size recommend 16
shovel tests per linear mile when the ROW
measures 100 feet wide, or 68 shovel tests for the
project area. Due to high ground surface visibility
and previous disturbances within the APE, SWCA
did not excavate all planned shovel tests, as
subsurface exploration was not warranted in certain
areas. In addition, further investigations are
unwarranted within the 0.75 mile segment due to
the high level of previous disturbances eliminating
the potential of encountering significant cultural
resources.

CONCLUSIONS AND
RECOMMENDATIONS
On behalf of River City Engineering and CRWA,
SWCA conducted an intensive cultural resources
survey for the Phase III of the CRWA Wells Ranch
Santa Clara to Wagner Transmission Line in
Guadalupe County, Texas. The work was
conducted as part of the sponsor’s compliance with
the Antiquities Code of Texas (Permit Number
6683) and the NHPA in anticipation of a permit
from the USACE-Fort Worth District under
Nationwide Permit 12 and Section 404 of the Clean
Water Act.
The CRWA proposes to replace and install a new
16-inch-diameter water main line within existing
CRWA easements, other utility easements, and
private property. Installation of the pipeline will
require trenching and boring within the 50-footwide construction easement. Typically, trenching
impacts would be 6–7 feet deep, while bore pits
would be 8–10 feet deep. The APE is
approximately 4.2 miles in length and 50 feet wide
(25.5 acres) with vertical impacts ranging in depth
from 6–10 feet deep.

SWCA recorded three new sites during the
investigations. The sites consisted of one
prehistoric site (41GU160) and two historic sites
(41GU161 and 41GU162). Site 41GU160 is a
sparse prehistoric lithic scatter. Sites 41GU161 and
41GU162 are historic artifact scatters likely
associated with nearby farmsteads. Although the
significance of the nearby farmsteads has not been
determined, the sites lack all aspects of integrity to
be considered as a contributing component to the
farmsteads. Overall, all the sites have been
continually disturbed by agricultural activities and
have little to no research value. All three sites are
considered not eligible for inclusion to the NRHP
or designation as an SAL, based on the lack of
cultural integrity, research potential, and overall
prior disturbances.

The investigations included a background review
and an intensive pedestrian survey with shovel
testing of the project area boundaries. The
background review determined that the project area
intersects one previously conducted cultural
resource survey and is adjacent to two previously
conducted cultural resource surveys. There are no
previously recorded sites within the proposed
alignment. In addition, there are no previously
conducted surveys or previously recorded sites
within a 1-mile radius of the project area. A review
of historic maps dating from 1921 and 1958
indicate there were several historic-age resources
adjacent to the proposed alignment between Lower
Seguin Road and Santa Clara Road, including the
farmsteads on the Pfannsteil and Schmoekel
parcels.

In accordance with 36 CFR 800.4, SWCA has made
a reasonable and good faith effort to identify
cultural resource properties within the APE. As no
properties were identified that may meet the criteria
for listing in the NRHP according to 36 CFR 60.4
or for designation as an SAL, according to 13 TAC
26.8, SWCA recommends no further cultural
resources work within the project area.

SWCA archaeologists examined the entire APE,
with the exception of 0.75 mile that was unavailable
due to lack of land owner permission and access.
This portion of the alignment was entirely within
agricultural fields that were recently plowed.
