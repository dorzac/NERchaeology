INTRODUCTION
An archaeological survey of a proposed 2908 foot pipeline (2.003 acres) in
central Jasper County, Texas (Figure 1) was conducted by BVRA. The proposed
pipeline will lead from an existing pipeline at an abandoned well site (Station 0+00) to a
well currently under construction (Station 25+28). The maximum width of the pipeline
route will be 30 feet; however, the actual ground disturbance or permanent easement
will only affect 10 feet; the remaining 20 feet is a temporary work area. The projected
depth along the pipeline route from Station 14+60 at the pond to the well under
construction at Station 25+28 is four feet. The line will be bored beneath the pond at
depths of 10 to 29 feet beginning at Station 14+60 to the beginning of the line at Station
0+00.
The entire tract to be surveyed consists of pine timberland with a small section of
hardwood bottomland and an area that has been clear-cut. A short segment will cross
Pattons Pond (referred to on the topographic map as Belle Jim Lake) formed by a dam
on Boggy Branch. The terrain along the route is hilly with elevations ranging from
approximately 312 feet at the pipeline tie-in point (Station 0+00), 243 feet at Pattons
Pond, and approximately 304 feet at the well site (Station 25+28). A previous
investigation by Environmental and Safety Professionals, Inc. determined that one
wetland area is present within the route of the proposed pipeline. This area is
approximately 198 feet in length and occurs in conjunction with the crossing of Pattons
Pond. The current project area is depicted on the 7.5' United States Geological Survey
topographical map Jasper West (dated 1984 [Provisional Edition]) (Figure 2).
Overall, the project area is located in a region known to contain significant
archaeological sites. Because of this archaeological potential, a reconnaissance survey
by professional archaeologists was warranted according to Section 106 of the National
Historic Preservation Act. Since this is a federally funded project (EPA), no Antiquities
Permit was required. In order to satisfy this requirement, BVRA was retained by
Environmental and Safety Professionals, Inc. of Kinder, Louisiana to examine the
proposed pipeline route for the presence of significant archaeological sites. The project
number assigned by BVRA is 01-10. The field survey was conducted on June 25, 2001.

ARCHAEOLOGICAL BACKGROUND
According to a recently published planning document for the Eastern Planning
Region of Texas (Kenmotsu and Perttula 1993:Figure 1.1.2), Jasper County is situated
within the Southeast Texas archeological study region. In 1985, according to a
statistical overview prepared by the Texas Historical Commission (Biesaart et al.
1985:151), Jasper County contained 86 recorded sites. The site files at TARL revealed
149 recorded sites at the time of this survey. In 1985, 0 sites in the county had been
excavated, 10 had been tested by hand, 1 had been tested by machine, and 73 had
been surface collected. Twenty-three recorded prehistoric sites in the county were
listed as Archaic and 54 sites were listed as Late Prehistoric (Biesaart et al. 1985:151).
One site contained burials.
In the volume by (Kenmotsu and Perttula 1993:Figure 1.1.3) an evaluation was
made regarding density of sites in Texas counties . At this time Jasper County was next
to last with 0.001 - 0.1 sites per square mile. In 1993, Jasper County contained 99
recorded archaeological sites. Of this number, 27 were regarded as not significant, 62
were of unknown significance, 9 were probably significant, and 1 was considered to be
significant according to National Register criteria (Kenmotsu and Perttula 1993:Table
2.1.1).
Unfortunately, there are major forces that continue to threaten the integrity of
archaeological sites in Jasper County. These include population growth (City of Jasper
and surrounding area), highway construction, Sam Rayburn Reservoir (formerly McGee
Bend), and the lumbering industry.
Although private contract archaeology firms have played a part, most of the
archaeological sites known to exist in Jasper County have been identified by surveys
associated with reservoir construction and in-house projects by National Forest
personnel. The earliest archaeological research in the area was performed in the late
1930s and early 1940s by researchers from The University of Texas at Austin. At that
time prehistoric cemeteries and mound sites were considered to be of primary
importance. From the late 1940s until the mid 1970s, most of the archaeological
research in East Texas was carried out in connection with reservoir construction. In
1948, for example, Robert L. Stephenson published the results of his work at the
proposed McGee Bend Reservoir in Angelina, Jasper, Nacogdoches, Sabine, and San
Augustine counties (Stephenson 1948a, 1948b). At the time this was the only
systematic professional major archaeological investigation in the county. Since that
time several studies regarding reservoirs such as Dam "B" (Stephenson 1949), Big Cow
Creek (Moir n.d.), and Rockland Lake (Prikryl (1987) have been published.

It is beyond the scope of this report to discuss in detail the archaeological
background of Jasper County, especially when numerous contract reports are available.
The interested reader is referred to the statistical overview (Biesaart et al. 1985), the
planning document published by the Texas Historical Commission (Kenmotsu and
Perttula 1993), other reports cited above, and the Abstracts in Contract Archaeology
series also published by the Texas Historical Commission for more detailed information
regarding the archaeology of Jasper County.

METHODS
Prior to entering the field, a records check was conducted for BVRA by Adrianne
Mraz, Research Assistant at TARL. Ms. Mraz checked the site files for previously
recorded sites in the project area. In addition, information pertaining to previous
archaeological work in the region was obtained from the library at BVRA. The field
survey crew relied on the topographic map Jasper West and the soils book for Jasper
County (Neitsch 1982). The method utilized to assess the pipeline consisted of shovel
tests and a surface inspection of exposed areas.
The pipeline traverses overland in a southeast-northwest direction through thick
woods and crosses Boggy Branch at the approximate center of the line. Prominent hills
are present on both sides of the pipeline route; however, the major portion of the
pipeline is on the slopes of these hills. The field survey crew viewed the slopes as low
probability areas for prehistoric sites.
The field survey crew walked the entire route excavating shovel tests along the
way. Since the project area does not exceed 30 feet (9.15 meters) in width, survey
transects were not necessary. In all, 22 tests were excavated. All earth excavated
through shovel testing was screened using 1/4" hardware cloth, and a shovel test log
(Appendix I) was kept. Profiles of the shovel tests were sketched in the field and the
tests were drawn on a project area map. The location of all shovel tests is depicted in
Figure 3.
The wooded nature (trees and roots) of the project area, especially on the
western end, made it difficult to dig shovel tests at regular intervals. Tests were
excavated at closer intervals near the tops of the hills and on level areas and further
apart on the slopes. The shovel test intervals varied from 58-200 feet.

RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS
The records check at TARL revealed no previously recorded archaeological site
in the project area. Significant sites in the county have been documented by
professional studies such as those at McGee Bend.
The field survey followed a route that passed through thick woods along the
slopes of hills and an area that has been extensively disturbed through logging
activities. At the west end of the project area is a well pad that is currently under
construction. In this area the soil type according to the soil survey for Jasper County is
the Doucette-Boykin association, undulating (DUB) (Neitsch 1982; 21-22, Sheet 48).
DUB soils are present on top of the hill and approximately halfway to the creek (Boggy
Branch). Along the slope of the hill below the existing well pad, the soils consist of the
Tehran-Letney association, hilly (TLE) in the center (Neitsch 1982; 43-44, Sheet 48).
These soils are present at the floodplain and on both sides of the creek on the slopes.
At the top of the hill at the eastern end of the project area and halfway to the creek are
soils of the Letney-Tehran association, undulation (LTC) (Neitsch 1982; 30, Sheet 48).
The project area superimposed on the soils map is depicted in Figure 4.
DUB soils are deep sandy soils on broad ridge tops and side slopes above
drainage ways on uplands. Slopes range from 1 to 8 percent. These soils are well
drained, runoff is slow, and permeability is moderate. The available water capacity is
medium in the Doucette soils and low in the Boykin soils. LTC soils are deep, sandy
soils on uplands on broad ridges and side slopes above drainage ways. Slopes range
from 1 to 8 percent. They occupy most of the highest land forms in the area. Slopes
are less than 1 percent. Letney soils are well drained, and Tehran soils are somewhat
excessively drained. Permeability of the soils is moderately rapid. Runoff is slow. The
available water capacity is medium for Letney soils and low for Tehran soils. TLE soils
are deep sandy soils on ridge tops and side slopes above drainage ways on uplands.
Slopes range from 8 to 20 percent. Tehran soils are somewhat excessively drained,
and Letney soils are well drained. Permeability of Tehran and Letney soils is
moderately rapid. Runoff is slow. The available water capacity is low for Tehran soils
and medium for Letney soils.
No archaeological sites were found along the 2908 foot project area route. It is
suggested here that the side slopes of the two upland hills nearby are low probability
areas for prehistoric sites. The more level upland hilltops are viewed as areas of
greater probability; however, these landforms are out of the project area.

RECOMMENDATIONS
BVRA recommends that Environmental and Safety Professionals, Inc. be allowed
to proceed with construction of the water line as planned. It is the opinion of BVRA that
no significant archaeological sites were missed during the examination of the 2908 foot
proposed pipeline route. Should, however, cultural materials be exposed during the
construction of the pipeline in areas other than mentioned above, all work should cease
until the situation can be evaluated by the Texas Historical Commission in consultation
with Environmental and Safety Professionals, Inc. and BVRA.
