ABSTRACT
In July of 2009, aci consulting conducted an archeological survey of the proposed Brushy Creek
Regional Utility Authority (BCRUA) Deep Water Intake Site 4 project area. The deep water
intake site is a 23-acre parcel that will house a facility intended to pump fresh water from the
Sandy Creek Arm of Lake Travis to the Brushy Creek Water Treatment Plant in northwest
Travis County. The project area has been impacted by residential development, and very little
soil accretion has occurred on the landscape, diminishing the likelihood of subsurface cultural
deposits. No cultural materials were identified during the archeological investigations of the
facility site, and no further archeological work is recommended. These investigations were
carried out under Texas Antiquities Permit No. 5346 with Meg Thornton serving as Principal
Investigator. The permit was later transferred to Ann M. Scott as Principal Investigator.

1.0 INTRODUCTION
On July 29, 2009, staff from aci consulting performed a 100-percent pedestrian survey of the
Brushy Creek Regional Utility Authority (BCRUA) Deep Water Intake Site 4 project area in
Travis County, Texas (Figure 1). Archeological work incorporated surface and subsurface
investigations to identify any archeological properties within the project area that may be
eligible for listing on the National Register of Historic Places (NRHP) or for designation as a
State Archeological Landmark (SAL). Archeological services were performed on behalf of
Environmental and Planning Associates, Inc. to address the requirements of the Texas
Administrative Code, Title 13, Part 2, Chapter 26. Survey work was conducted under Texas
Antiquities Permit No. 5346 issued to Meg Thornton, Principle Investigator. After the
fieldwork was finished and the report was in production, the permit was transferred to Ann
M. Scott as Principal Investigator. Jon J. Dowling served as Project Archeologist. The
Texas Antiquities Permit was issued for both the 23-acre project area and a pipeline route as
it was then planned. Since that time, the original pipeline route has been discarded, and a
new route has not yet been determined. Consequently, this report covers only the
investigation of the 23-acre project area; should the BCRUA choose to install a pipeline, the
pipeline route will be investigated separately and under a different permit.
The proposed deep water intake facility will pump fresh water from the Sandy Creek Arm of
Lake Travis into a 78-inch raw water intake line that will direct fresh water into the existing
water utility system. As discussed above, the route of the pipeline has not yet been
determined and will require archeological investigation at a later date. The project is
designed to provide water to the rapidly-growing population of this portion of the region.
Personnel from aci consulting were tasked with the following objectives. First, intensive
pedestrian survey and systematic shovel testing of the project area were conducted to locate
possible archeological deposits resting within the APE and establish their vertical and
horizontal boundaries. Second, if an archeological site had been located, its eligibility for
listing on the NRHP and potential designation as a SAL would have been evaluated. Finally,
a report summarizing the results of archeological investigations and recommendations has
been generated for submission to the sponsor, Environmental and Planning Associates, Inc.,
and the oversight agency, the Texas Historical Commission (THC), which will satisfy
cultural resource clearance requirements.
This report is divided into five sections. The cultural overview and previous archeology is
presented in Section 2. Section 3 includes the field methodology used during the project, and
the results of field investigations are discussed in Section 4. Section 5 presents the summary
and recommendations. The remainder of this chapter will further describe the projectâs Area
of Potential Effect (APE) and its environmental setting.

1.1 The Project Area
The BCRUA Deep Water Intake Site 4 project area consists of a 23-acre property, adjacent to
Jackson Road, on an eastern shoreline along the Sandy Creek Arm of Lake Travis. The
project area location is on the Mansfield Dam USGS 7.5-minute topographic quadrangle map
(Figure 2). The 23-acre tract consists primarily of private property accommodating a family
residential home, an associated guest house, a garage structure, and a greenhouse.
Considerable landscape modification has occurred on the shoreline of the project area.
1.2 Environmental Setting
Geology and Soils
The survey area is located in the Hill Country region of Central Texas, which is bordered to
the south and east by the Balcones Escarpment. This escarpment defines the eastern
boundary of the hill country and the western boundary of the Texas coastal plains. The
specific location is, geomorphologically, a dissected plateau that sits in the transition zone
between the humid climate of the coastal plains and the semi-arid climate to the west. The
elevation in Central Texas ranges from 800 to 1,050 ft (244 to 320 m) above sea level.
The survey area is underlain by Edwards Limestone (Ked), Bee Cave Marl (Kbc), and Upper
Glen Rose Formation [Kgr (u)]of the lower cretaceous (Barnes 1974). The geologic strata are
associated with the Fredericksburg Group which overlays the Glen Rose Formation, a marine
limestone. This is also bisected by Bee Cave Marl. This is the bottom layer of the
Fredericksburg Group and serves as a transition to the Glen Rose Formation (Barnes 1974).
The soil in the study area belongs to the Tarrant Association, which consists of very shallow
clayey soils that are stony and calcareous in nature. These soils occur on flat to slightly
sloping surfaces and tend to reach less than 10 inches in depth.
Vegetation and Climate
Flora within and around the project area consists of oak and Ashe juniper mixed with cedar
elm, mesquite and hackberry trees. Much of the natural vegetation has been displaced due to
residential development (Figure 3). This woodland is generally short in stature, and cover in
this canopy layer is patchy. Middle story vegetation within the study area and its surrounding
landscape may include persimmon, agarita, mustang gravevines, and sumac. Greenbriar and
brambles are also present. Near the shore of Lake Travis, the surface is composed of exposed
bedrock with very little vegetation (Figure 4). Travis County is subject to a temperate,
humid, subtropical climate, and average annual rainfall fluctuates around 34.2 inches per
year.

2.0 CULTURE HISTORY AND PREVIOUS ARCHEOLOGY
2.1 Culture History
The project area is situated in the heart of Central Texas. Once a culture chronology for this
region of Texas has been reviewed, the following section will provide a brief summary of the
previous archeological work carried out near the project area.
Paleoindian
The arrival of humans in the New World occurred during the Paleoindian period, which dates
from approximately 12,000-8,000 B.P. and is one of the least understood periods in Texas
prehistory (Collins 1995). As the Pleistocene period ended, diagnostic Paleoindian materials
in the form of Clovis, Folsom, and Plainview projectile points began to enter the
archeological record. These points were lanceolate in shape and longitudinally fluted for
hafting to wooden spears. Using the launching momentum from atlatls (spear-throwers),
these earliest Americans frequently hunted large game such as mammoth, mastodons, bison,
camel, and horse (Black 1989). In addition to megafauna, Paleoindian groups likely pursued
less daunting prey including antelope, rabbit, and turtle.
Stylistic changes in projectile point technology occurred during the later portion of the period
as Dalton, Scottsbluff, and Golondrina traditions became increasingly prevalent. While
widespread in geographic range, these types occurred particularly in high densities in the
High Plains and Central Texas (Meltzer and Bever 1995). Some sites representative of the
Paleoindian period in Central Texas include the Kincaid and Pavo Real sites. Environmental
studies suggest that Late Pleistocene climates were wetter and cooler (Mauldin and Nickels
2001; Toomey et al. 1993), gradually shifting to drier and warmer conditions during the
Early Holocene (Bousman 1998). As megafauna gradually died off during the transition to
warmer climates, subsistence patterns shifted toward smaller game and plant foraging.
Archaic
The Archaic period, broadly divided into the Early, Middle, and Late Archaic subperiods, is
characterized by an intensified reliance on local floral and faunal resources and an increase in
the number of projectile point styles (Collins 1995). The archeological record begins to
indicate more widespread use of rock-lined cooking features, a wider variety of site
functions, and more localized geographic distributions of evidence of human occupation.
Early Archaic (ca. 8,000-6,000 B.P.)
According to Prewitt (1981), the Early Archaic witnessed an expansion in the diversity of
plant and animal resources utilized for subsistence with a shift away from large game.
Paleoenvironmental data suggests that Central Texas underwent a gradual climate change,
particularly between 7,000 and 5,000 B.P. (Bryant and Shafer 1977). The increasingly warm,
dry conditions in what would become the western United States likely caused a significant
decrease in available ground water, and what had once been a lightly forested area became a

6

more arid grassland savanna.
The archeological record reflects a marked decrease in the presence of Pleistocene
megafauna in sites from the Early Archaic. It has been theorized that intensive hunting,
combined with environmental change, drove these species to near extinction. As megafauna
populations decreased, a subsistence shift towards heavier reliance on deer, fish, and plants
became necessary. In the archeological record, this trend equates to greater densities of
ground stone artifacts, barbed dart points, task-specific tools such as Clear Fork gouges and
Guadalupe and Nueces bifaces, and fire-cracked rock midden features (Turner and Hester
1999). These concentrations of heat-fractured rock are believed to be remnants of rock-lined
roasting ovens.
Early Archaic sites tend to be small and suggest low population densities in this region. They
are described as non-specialized sites that are widely distributed across the landscape and are
usually found on the surface or in shallow deposits. Those that have been recorded as deeply
buried sites are often underlying larger Middle or Late Archaic sites (Story 1985). Most of
the Early Archaic sites in this region are open campsites distributed along the eastern and
southern margins of the Edwards Plateau in areas with reliable water sources (McKinney
1981). Artifacts that are considered unique to the Early Archaic extend well beyond the
boundaries of Central Texas, suggesting that significant degrees of mobility carried these
bands through relatively undefined territories. The Wilson-Leonard, Jetta Court, and Sleeper
sites are all sites representative of the Early Archaic (Collins 1995).
Middle Archaic (ca. 6,000-4,000 B.P.)
Paleoenvironmental evidence suggests that the warm, dry conditions that began in the Early
Archaic continued into the Middle Archaic. Research in Central Texas suggests that the
driest period was ca. 5,000-4,000 B.P. (Weir 1976). These changes in the regionâs climatic
patterns undoubtedly had a significant influence on the behavioral adaptations of prehistoric
people to the areaâs environment.
Sites from the Middle and Late Archaic are larger and more diverse than those of the Early
Archaic. It has been theorized that these larger sites might represent an increase in the
population density of the area (Story 1985, Prewitt 1981). The increased presence of ground
stone implements such as manos, metates, and bedrock mortars in the archeological record
suggests a shift to heavier reliance on plant resources as part of the overall subsistence
strategy. According to Collins (1995) the beginning of the Middle Archaic still exhibited
limited large-game hunting of bison, but the climate became much drier towards the end of
the Middle Archaic, necessitating a heavier reliance on sotol and acorn harvesting (Weir
1976). An expansion of oak woodlands on the Edwards Plateau and Balcones Escarpment
may have encouraged the intensified exploitation of certain plants (Weir 1976). Middle
Archaic materials date from about 6,000 to 4,000 B.P., with increased occurrence of multiÂ­
use bifacial knives and burned rock middens (Collins 1995). Diagnostic points from this
period include Bell, Andice, Taylor, Nolan, and Travis. The Tortugas point also appears in
Middle Archaic contexts and possibly earlier (Turner and Hester 1999).

7

Story (1985) suggests that the variation in size of sites from the Middle and Late Archaic
periods indicates a change in local groups based on seasonal and spatial variations in
resources. Hester (1975) has suggested that the climatic fluctuations during this time, coupled
with the changes in available resources, resulted in populations clustering in major drainages
where resources would have been more stable. The Landslide, Wounded Eye and Gibson
sites demonstrate the cultural trends of the Middle Archaic (Collins 1995).
Late Archaic (ca. 4,000-1,200 B.P.)
The last subperiod of the Archaic falls between ca. 4,000 and 1,200 B.P. (Collins 1995) and,
in Central Texas, witnessed a gradual climatic shift from arid to relatively cool and moist.
Since burned rock middens are specifically associated with cooking the tough plants adapted
to hot, dry environments, these archeological features reflect the climatic change of this
period and the accompanying shift in subsistence. Sites dating from the earliest portions of
the Late Archaic are associated with the growth of burned rock middens, but by the end of
the Late Archaic the use of these features had decreased. While rock-lined ovens continued
to be used on the western fringes of Central Texas into the Late Prehistoric period, this
practice had been almost completely abandoned in the rest of Central Texas by the end of the
Late Archaic (Collins 1995).
Diagnostic dart point styles of the Late Archaic are relatively small, triangular points with
corner notches such as the Ensor and Ellis (Turner and Hester 1999). Other Late Archaic
points include Bulverde, Pedernales, Marshall, and Marcos (Collins 1995). Cylindrical stone
pipes, marine shell ornaments, caches of large bifaces, and finely-made âcorner tangâ knives
are also distinctive items associated with the Late Archaic in Central Texas (Collins 2004). It
is not entirely clear whether this period experienced a rise (Collins 1995, Prewitt 1981) or
decline (Black 1989) in population numbers, but large cemeteries, grave goods, and exotic
trade items are known to occur at this time in Central and South Texas at sites such as Loma
Sandia, Rudy Haiduk, Silo, Ernest Witte, and Morhiss Mound. Evidence from the Thunder
Valley sinkhole cemetery has suggested that territoriality may have been established during
the Late Archaic, possibly as a result of population increase (Bement 1989). Characteristic
Late Archaic sites include the Anthon and Loeve-Fox sites
Late Prehistoric
Late Archaic and Late Prehistoric diagnostic tools overlap to some degree, but the commonly
held date for the beginning of the Late Prehistoric is ca. 1,200 B.P. The primary hallmark of
the beginning of the Late Prehistoric period is the appearance of arrow points in the
archeological record. These smaller points indicate the introduction of the bow and arrow,
although the atlatl probably remained in limited use (Collins 2004). The Late Prehistoric
period is divided into two phases: the Austin Phase, from ca. 1,200-800 B.P., and the Toyah
Phase from ca. 800-200 B.P. Sites with distinct Late Prehistoric components include the
Kyle, Smith and Currie sites (Collins1995).
The Austin Phase of the Late Prehistoric, dated to between ca. 1,200 B.P. and 800 B.P.,
appears in Central Texas as a continuation of Late Archaic life ways with the addition of the

8

bow and arrow. Burned rock middens continued to be created in the relatively arid western
portion of Central Texas, and other subsistence patterns appear to have been maintained as
well. Skeletal injuries indicating possible arrow-inflicted deaths during this early part of the
Late Prehistoric suggest an increase in violence between groups of hunter-gatherers (Collins
2004). Scallorn and Edwards arrow points are diagnostic of this phase (Collins 1995; Turner
and Hester 1999).
The Toyah phase of the Late Prehistoric is much more well-defined than the Austin phase.
In Central Texas, the Toyah phase is characterized by Perdiz arrow points, prismatic blades,
large thin bifaces, end scrapers, and the introduction of ceramics. Archeological sites from
this phase have yielded both locally-made ceramics and Caddo ceramics imported from
further east (Collins 2004).
Historic
Alvar NuÃ±ez Cabeza de Vaca and the remaining survivors of the Narvaez expedition were
the first Europeans known to have set foot in modern-day Texas; they landed on the Texas
coast following a shipwreck in 1528 (Chipman 1992). Between 1528 and the late 1600s,
Spanish excursions into Texas were limited. The first European known to enter Travis
County was Domingo TerÃ¡n de los RÃ­os during a reconnaissance tour. Later Spanish
incursions recorded insightful information on various Native American tribes, collectively
referred to as the Coahuiltecans, who at one point lived in the area around modern-day San
Antonio. Late seventeenth century accounts describe these people as family units of hunter
gatherers that resided near streams and springs, in areas conducive to nut harvesting. These
camps were revisited on a seasonal basis, allowing interaction with different groups along the
way as well as the hunting of bison in open grassland settings (Campbell 1983; Hester 1989).
By the eighteenth century, the cultural integrity of these native groups was significantly
compromised by European settlers and invasive neighboring Native American groups, such
as the Tonkawa and the Lipan Apache, made possible through access to European horses.
Efficiently skilled Comanche horsemen, in turn, displaced the Lipan Apache culture,
continuously raiding European and Native American settlements alike in Central Texas
(Hester 1989). In response to the continuous threat of Apache and Comanche raiders, as well
as the French incursion into East Texas, a series of Spanish missions and presidios were
erected along the San Antonio River during the eighteenth century. The Spanish governor of
Coahuila and Texas, the Marques de San Miguel de Aguayo, established San Antonio as the
focus of European settlement (Cox 1997). Anglo-American settlement in the area began with
numerous land grants from Mexico following its independence from Spain in 1821.
Mirabeau Lamar, while serving as President of the Republic of Texas, wanted to locate a site
where a new capital city for Texas could be planned, based on the layout of Washington D.C.
at the time. While hunting buffalo with a Ranger detachment in 1838, Lamar camped at the
small settlement of Waterloo at the confluence of Shoal Creek and the Colorado River. The
ambience of the location impressed Lamar, and the site was chosen over Mina (Bastrop) as
the new capital of Texas. The new capital of Waterloo was renamed after Stephen F. Austin
in 1839. Travis County was named after William Barret Travis, who perished defending the
Alamo in 1836. Texas prospered as an independent republic for ten years, eventually joining

9

the United States in 1845. The Civil War proved detrimental to Austinâs economy, but
conditions improved during the 1880s, particularly with the arrival of various rail roads.
Cedar Park, one of several satellite communities to Austin, gained access to the railroad in
the 1880s. The Cedar Park community was named by a descendant of the Cluck family
which owned a ranch surrounding Running Brushy Spring (HTO 2009). Lake Travis, on
which the BCRUA facility site is located, is a sixty-five-mile-long artificial lake designed by
the United States Department of the Interior in 1936.
2.2 Inventory of Previously-Recorded Sites and Surveys
No archeological sites have been recorded within the BCRUA Deep Water Intake Facility
Site 4 project area (THC 2010). According to a THC archeological site files search (2010),
only one previous area survey has been conducted within 1 mile of the project area. In 1938
and 1939 the Archeological Site Survey Report for the Basin of Marshall Ford Lake recorded
four sites within 1 mi of the project area. All of these sites were recorded as being
prehistoric scatters of burned rock and lithic material, and all four sites were inundated by the
creation of Lake Travis. No historic properties were listed within 1 mile of the project area
in the THC historic site file database.
3.0 SURVEY METHODS
The archeological investigation of the BCRUA Deep Water Intake Site 4 project area
consisted of intensive reconnaissance walk-over surveys and strategic shovel testing. Shovel
tests measured 30 cm in diameter and ranged in depth from 5 to 40 centimeters below surface
(cmbs); each shovel test was terminated at either bedrock or a layer of dense limestone
gravels. The shovel tests were excavated in 10-cm increments, and all soil was screened
through Â¼-inch hardware cloth. Relevant information for all shovel tests was recorded on a
standardized form. Shovel tests were plotted using a handheld GPS unit with sub meter
accuracy, and photographs were taken documenting the landscape, vegetation, and
conditions. All documents will be curated at the Texas Archeological Research Laboratory.
Since little occupation activity occurs on sloping ground surfaces, shovel tests were
excavated in flat horizontal landscapes with as little exposed bedrock on the surface as
possible.
4.0 ARCHEOLOGICAL SURVEY RESULTS
Archeologists from aci consulting excavated 31 shovel tests in the 23-acre project area,
exceeding the 12 shovel tests required under the THCâs survey standards (Figure 5). Neither
pedestrian survey nor shovel testing yielded any cultural material (see the Appendix for a
shovel test log). The shallowness of the soil indicates a low probability of buried cultural
deposits.
5.0 CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS
In July of 2009, aci consulting conducted a cultural resources assessment of the 23-acre
project area for the BCRUA Deep Water Intake Site 4. A 100-percent pedestrian survey

10

including the excavation of 31 shovel tests resulted in the discovery of no cultural material
within the project area. As a result of this survey and because of the shallow nature of the
soils in this area, no further archeological investigation is recommended. In the unlikely
event that cultural resources or human remains are encountered during the course of
construction for this project, all construction activities should cease and archeologists at the
THC should be contacted immediately to discuss the best course of action.
