ABSTRACT
An archaeological survey of the proposed University Ranch Project in central
Brazos County, Texas was performed by Brazos Valley Research Associates (BVRA) from
August through October 1999 and in February 2000. The area examined consisted of
approximately 945 acres. The Principal Investigator was William E. Moore who was
assisted by James E. Warren (Project Archaeologist) and two field assistants. This project
was carried out under Texas Antiquities Permit Number 2238. The project area was
investigated using the pedestrian survey method supported by shovel testing and probing
and backhoe trenching. Geoarchaeologist Melinda A. Goelz examined the various
landforms (uplands and lowlands) in the project area in order to evaluate the potential for
buried sites. She also investigated three prehistoric sites (41BZ131 - 41BZ133) found
during this study for the possibility of intact deposits in the strata containing cultural
materials.
This study located one previously unrecorded prehistoric site with a historic
component (41BZ131) and three previously unrecorded prehistoric sites (41BZ132 41BZ134). The four prehistoric sites are defined in this report as short-term occupation
sites, and the historic component at 41BZ131 is a house with an adjacent cistern (base)
constructed of locally obtained petrified wood. The wooden frame house was constructed
in the 1940s and later remodeled in the 1970s. It is not architecturally or historically
significant and is not eligible for designation as a State Archeological Landmark or for
inclusion on the National Register of Historic Places. The prehistoric component at
41BZ131 has been virtually destroyed through sand quarrying in the early 1990s and
contains no evidence of intact deposits. It is, therefore, not eligible for designation as a
State Archeological Landmark or for inclusion on the National Register of Historic Places.

Shovel testing and backhoe trenching at site 41BZ132 produced flakes, burned
rock, and a Carrollton dart point that dates to the Middle Archaic period, circa 2000 B.C. to
1200 B.C. Examination of the site by the geoarchaeologist determined that the cultural
materials were found in a deep sandy mantle. This site is not eligible for designation as a
State Archeological Landmark or for inclusion on the National Register of Historic Places,
and no further work is recommended.
No features or temporally diagnostic artifacts were found at site 41BZ133. These
cultural materials were found in a deep sandy mantle. This site is not eligible for
designation as a State Archeological Landmark or for inclusion on the National Register of
Historic Places, and no further work is recommended.

No features or temporally diagnostic artifacts were found at site 41BZ134. The
cultural materials were found in a deep sandy mantle. This site is not eligible for
designation as a State Archeological Landmark or for inclusion on the National Register of
Historic Places, and no further work is recommended.
A fifth prehistoric site (41BZ135) was found during the field survey. However, the
project area was not delineated by the client, and it was later determined that this site is out
of the current project area. Although this site was recorded at TARL, it is not discussed
elsewhere in this report. Site 41BZ135 was found to be virtually destroyed through
quarrying for sand. Eight flakes were found on an eroded surface adjacent to Turkey
Creek, and one small interior flake was found in a shovel test. This site is not eligible for
designation as a State Archeological Landmark or for inclusion on the National Register of
Historic Places.
The lessee of the house at 41BZ131 has a collection of Paleoindian through Late
Prehistoric artifacts that he claims were found on the surface in the disturbed areas of the
site. These specimens have been documented and appear as an appendix to this report.
Copies of the final report are available at the following agencies: Texas Historical
Commission (THC), Archeology Division; Texas Archeological Research Laboratory
(TARL); Office of the State Archeologist (OSA); BVRA; and CSC Engineering &
Environmental Consultants, Inc. The artifacts have been placed in permanent curation at
TARL.

INTRODUCTION
The City of Bryan proposes to build a public golf course, resort hotel, and residential
development on a tract of approximately 945 acres in Central Brazos County (Figure 1).
When finished, this development will be referred to as the Tradition Golf and Country Club
at University Ranch. This tract is located at the northwest corner of Highway 60 and its
intersection with Farm-to-Market Road 2818. The extreme northwest corner of the project
area is bounded by Villa Maria Road; however, this road is not depicted on the topographic
quadrangle. CSC Engineering & Environmental Consultants, Inc. of Bryan, Texas was
retained by the City of Bryan to coordinate the initial planning of this project. The project
area consists of six tracts owned by different individuals and is depicted on two topographic
quadrangles: Chances Store (dated 1962 and photorevised 1980) and Wellborn (dated
1961 and photorevised 1980). The project area as illustrated on the two topographic maps
is depicted on Figure 2. An enlarged version of the project area showing the
concentrations of shovel tests, shovel probes, and backhoe trench locations appears as
Figure 3 of this report.
Brazos County contains significant archaeological sites, both prehistoric and
historic, and the 945-acre tract is located in an area where numerous prehistoric sites have
been recorded. CSC Engineering & Environmental Consultants, Inc. retained Brazos
Valley Research Associates to conduct an archaeological survey which was performed
under Texas Antiquities Permit Number 2238. The field crew consisted of William E.
Moore (Principal Investigator), James E. Warren (Project Archaeologist), Arthur F. Romine,
and Bobby Jemison. The field survey was accomplished between August 30 and
September 10, 1999 and February 3-5, 2000. In all, 388 person hours were necessary to
complete the field survey portion of this project.
At the time of the archaeological investigation, the golf course was still in the
planning phase. Therefore, it was not known which archaeological sites, if any, would be
impacted by golf course construction. Based on a preliminary assessment by CSC
Engineering & Environmental Consultants, Inc., some subsurface disturbance will occur at
various locations within the 945-acre tract. It is the intention of the City of Bryan, however,
to leave the Turkey Creek riparian zone as natural as possible. Hiking trails are planned
along the creek and its tributaries, but the creek is not scheduled for dredging. The
residential area in the southern part of the project area (approximately 545 acres) and the
site of the hotel in the northern part of the project area (approximately 400 acres) may be
subjected to the most disturbance due to road construction, underground utilities, and
water line installation. An irrigation system will be installed throughout the golf course. The
945-acre tract currently consists of dense woodlands (north) and open pasture (south).

ENVIRONMENTAL SETTING
The project area is located within the West Gulf Coastal Plain section of the Coastal
Plain physiographic province as defined by Fenneman (1938:100-120). Fenneman
subdivides this province according to the age of the geological formations (Gulf series) that
roughly parallel the Texas coastline. The area is hilly and situated within the East Texas
timber belt. Gould (1969) describes it as an area characterized by gently rolling to hilly
topography with light colored soils that are acid sandy loams or sands.
The climate is subhumid to humid, and the weather is considered to be
predominately warm. Annual rainfall for Brazos County is 39.21 inches. A January
minimum temperature of 42 degrees Fahrenheit and a July maximum temperature of 95
degrees Fahrenheit combine to produce a growing season of 274 days (Kingston and
Harris 1983:180). The altitude varies from 200-400 feet. The project area is located on a
tract of land that is drained by Turkey Creek and its tributaries. Elevations vary from 250
feet along the creek bottoms to 332 feet in the uplands that comprise the majority of the
project area.
Water was present in Turkey Creek at the time of this survey. According to Bill
Moos who lives in the house at 41BZ131, there are several natural springs on the property
that keep this stream flowing most of the year.
Petrified wood is very common in the project area. Numerous pieces, large and
small, were observed on the ground surface in eroded areas throughout the project area
and in many of the shovel tests. Dexter T. Gabbard, the owner of the northernmost tract of
the proposed development, has collected several large logs and stumps of petrified wood.
Soils in the project area are dominated by shallow, fine sandy loams with clay
subsoils, especially in the higher elevations of the southern two-thirds of the project area
(Mowery, et al. 1958). These soils are those that were previously cleared and cultivated for
many years prior to being converted to pasture and hay fields, their present use. The
creek bottoms in the northwest part of the project area consist of these same fine sandy
loams plus heavier soils such as Gower clay loam.
Three archaeological sites (41BZ131, 41BZ133-41BZ134) were discovered on
landforms containing very deep loamy fine sand soils. Site 41BZ132 is situated on a gentle
slope partially in fine sandy loam and partially in loamy fine sand (Tabor series). The
loamy fine sand soils are very deep with clay sub-soil being encountered from 110 to 246
cm. Many shovel tests in these soils were dug to depths of 110 cm without encountering
clay.

METHODS OF INVESTIGATION
Background Research
The field survey was supplemented by an examination of site records and other
documents at TARL in Austin, Texas. The records at TARL were checked for a listing of
known sites in the project area and general vicinity. Relevant archaeological reports
documenting work in Brazos County were reviewed in order to become familiar with the
kinds of prehistoric and historic sites found in the area.
Field Survey
The area was examined in the field by means of a pedestrian survey. The field
crew consisted of William E. Moore (Principal Investigator), James E. Warren (Project
Archaeologist), and two assistants. Poor ground visibility, especially in wooded areas,
necessitated the use of shovel testing and probing. All areas where the ground surface
was visible were checked for exposed cultural materials.
Shovel tests were excavated throughout the project area with an emphasis on high
probability areas for prehistoric sites and randomly across the 945-acre tract. In all, 135
shovel tests and 60 probes were excavated. All excavated earth was screened through
quarter-inch hardware cloth. Data obtained from shovel tests were recorded on a shovel
test log. The positive tests are presented in Appendix I. All shovel tests were backfilled
after evaluation and mapping. When practical, shovel tests were mapped using a
compass, tape, and GPS. These measurements were then used to demonstrate the
coverage of the project area by the field survey crew and to create preliminary site
boundaries. Shovel test profiles were drawn, and representative profiles appear as
Appendix II. All artifacts found during shovel testing and backhoe trenching were collected,
bagged, and labeled. Artifact and site descriptions are presented in the Results and
Conclusions section of this report. Basic soil descriptions were taken from the 1958 soil
survey (Mowery et al. 1958) and a current soils map that has not been incorporated into a
published volume at this time. All sites located during this survey were recorded at TARL.
Each site was shovel tested and recorded on standard site forms and assigned temporary
field numbers. A copy of the survey report and all supporting data, including artifacts, are
temporarily housed at BVRA in Bryan, Texas awaiting permanent curation at TARL.
While working out the details of the Scope of Work with the Texas Historical
Commission staff it was noted that approximately 50% of the project area (400 acres)
appeared to be a low probability area for prehistoric sites. This area included the southern
half of the project area that had been in cultivation for many years. At the time of the
current survey, the area was being used for grazing and hay production.
6

This area is higher in elevation than the northern portion, but is farther away from
the major water source (Turkey Creek) and exhibits very little relief other than those areas
immediately adjacent to creeks. This area contains the headwaters of several creeks, but
it is believed that the lower reaches of these creeks probably furnished a more reliable
water source than the higher elevations. During the field survey, special attention was
given to areas of higher elevation, especially those adjacent to creeks (Figure 3). Most of
the soils were shallow, sandy loam overlying clay. No cultural materials were observed on
the surface (except for those in disturbed areas at 41BZ131) or in the cutbanks and creek
bottoms. The northern half of the project area is much different from the southern half. In
this area there are two prominent sandy hills less than one km from Turkey Creek. These
sandy hills were considered high probability areas for prehistoric sites, a hypothesis that
proved to be correct. Sites 41BZ131 and 41BZ132 were found on this landforms, and site
41BZ133 was found on the next highest elevation. Being loose sandy surfaces covered
with vegetation, neither 41BZ132 nor 41BZ133 revealed any cultural materials on the
surface. Site 41BZ131 did yield one dart point base, and the present lessee of the property
(Bill Moos) has a collection of artifacts which he claims to have picked up on the disturbed
surface after the area around his house was mined for sand.
The next areas considered likely areas for cultural resources were those near
Turkey Creek and its major tributaries. However, it was noted on the Soil Conservation
Service soils map that these areas are mostly clay soils. Also, upon surface inspection,
large, dry-weather cracks confirmed the soils as heavy clay. The lessee has a number of
cows and horses on the property that prefer the grasses growing on these clay soils.
Therefore, they have spent a lot of time along the creeks that leaves the soil surface about
70% exposed. No cultural evidence was observed near these creeks, either on the surface
or in shovel tests or backhoe trenches. An additional 95 acres were added to the project
area (making a total of 945 acres). This tract was along the main channel of Turkey Creek
and considered to be high probability for prehistoric sites. One site (41BZ134) was found
in this area.
In all, 135 shovel tests were excavated in the project area, all in high probability
areas in the northern half of the project area. Each test was 30 x 50 cm in size and ranged
in depth from 10 to 160 cm. As noted above, all of the soils along Turkey Creek were
found to be clayey, and the surface exposure was above 30%; therefore, no shovel tests
were dug in this area. The higher elevations, especially those mapped as loamy fine sands
and fine sandy loams, were considered high probability areas, and most of the shovel tests
were excavated in these topographic settings. When clay soils were encountered near
the surface, the tests were terminated after digging through about 10 cm of clay. Some of
the sandy soil tests reached clay between 50 and 80 cm, while many of them failed to
reach clay at depths of 110 cm.
7

Twelve backhoe units were excavated to reveal soil profiles and evidence of intact
cultural features. Nine of these units were in the northern half of the project area (high
probability area), and three were in the southern half (low probability area). The results of
the backhoe trenches are presented in a log (Appendix III), and representative profiles of
selected trenches are presented in Appendix IV.
Geoarchaeological Study
Following the initial field survey, a draft report was submitted to the Texas Historical
Commission for review. At that time sites 41BZ131-41BZ133 were recommended for
significance testing. After a discussion with the project reviewer, William A. Martin, it was
decided that a decision regarding testing should wait until the project area was examined
by a geoarchaeologist. A second visit to the project area was made with the original field
crew and Melinda A. Goelz, the geoarchaeologist. Ms Goelz examined the various
landforms in the project area where sites had not been found to make a determination
regarding the potential for buried sites in these areas. In addition, she investigated the
three prehistoric sites using backhoe trenches (n=14) to expose the subsurface. Selected
backhoe trenches were described and profiled. Excerpts from her work appears in the
Results and Conclusions section below, and her report in its entirety appears as Appendix
V.
Laboratory Analysis
All of the artifacts collected during this project are lithics, and William A. Dickens
examined them in the laboratory. The results of his analysis appears in Appendix VI (site
41BZ131) and Appendix VII (sites 41BZ132 and 41BZ133). Due to a paucity of artifacts at
site 41BZ134, these specimens were not subjected to a detailed lithic analysis.
Curation
All materials collected during this study were prepared for curation at TARL by Jean
Hughes, an employee of that institution. The curated materials include artifacts, field notes,
and photographs.

ARCHAEOLOGICAL BACKGROUND
A check of the records at the Texas Archeological Research Laboratory (TARL) in
Austin, Texas revealed no archeological sites have been recorded in the project area. It
was discovered, however, that a number of sites have been recorded in the region, and
several significant cultural resources investigations have been performed in Brazos
County. The interested reader is referred to a previous report by Moore and Warren (1993)
for information regarding smaller surveys and sites recorded by individuals.
The first systematic investigation in Brazos County occurred when portions of the
Navasota River Basin were surveyed within the authorized dam site for the Millican
Reservoir in 1971 by R. T. Ray and Alton Briggs for the Texas Historical Commission and
Texas Water Development Board. According to Kotter (1981:391-392), this initial survey
recorded nine archeological sites (41BZ8-41BZ16). One site (41BZ15) contained an
historic component as well as prehistoric materials. The results of this project remain
unpublished.
A second archeological survey of the Navasota River Basin was conducted by the
Texas Archeological Survey (Sorrow and Cox 1973) for the United States Army Corps of
Engineers, Little Rock District. This work was carried out in anticipation of the proposed
Millican Lake on the Navasota River that would inundate portions of Brazos, Grimes, and
Madison counties. Flooding caused by frequent rains during the project made it impossible
for much of the bottom lands to be examined. The amount of land surveyed is not
mentioned in the report. Shovel testing was not conducted. In Brazos County, fourteen
prehistoric sites (41BZ17- 41BZ30) were recorded. Nine sites (41BZ8-41BZ16), previously
recorded by the Texas Historical Commission in 1971, were revisited.
The majority of the prehistoric sites found by Sorrow and Cox were thinly distributed
lithic scatters exposed in rodent spoil piles. Approximately half of all sites examined
contained only lithic debitage, and only three sites contained evidence of subsistence in the
form of mussel shell or grinding stones. According to Kotter (1981:34-35), this survey was
useful in that it demonstrated that large numbers of sites exist in an area previously thought
to contain few cultural resources.
It was concluded that the number of sites recorded represents only a fraction of the
total present in the basin. The age of sites in the basin is believed to range from
Paleoindian to Historic. It was recommended that a more comprehensive study of the
area, including subsurface testing, be carried out prior to construction of the dam.

9

A review of prehistoric and historic resources in the Millican Project was conducted
by Prewitt and Associates, Inc. (Kotter and Victor 1981) prior to an assessment of the
cultural resources of the Millican Project (Navasota River Basin) by Prewitt and Associates,
Inc. (Kotter 1981). This survey recorded 32 sites (41BZ39-41BZ70; 41BZ75 [out of the
project area]) and two localities. Site 41BZ46 is historic, and 41BZ66 contains prehistoric
and historic components. The Millican Project represents the most intensive study of
cultural resources in Brazos County. Data collected indicate that significant cultural
resources are present within all portions of the project area. Although some of the sites
may be eligible for the National Register of Historic Places, not one was nominated. The
possibility of the area as an archaeological district was also discussed.
The first major project in the county since the Millican Reservoir study was
conducted by the Archeological Research Laboratory, Texas A&M University, in 1991. A
survey of selected areas of a 530-acre tract resulted in the recording of eight sites
(41BZ109-41BZ111; 41BZ119-41BZ123). Of this total, 2 sites are prehistoric, 4 are
historic, and 2 contain both prehistoric and historic components. In addition to the survey,
previously recorded site 41BZ1 was evaluated (Thoms 1993a).
In May of 1992, the Texas Water Development Board conducted a survey of a
portion of the proposed wastewater treatment plant on White Creek approximately three
miles southwest of the current project area and associated facilities (Whitsett and Jurgens
1992). Six sites (41BZ112-41BZ117) were recorded. Testing was recommended for two
prehistoric sites (41BZ112 and 41BZ115), and archival research was recommended for the
historic component of 41BZ115. An additional survey was requested to cover 102 acres
not encompassed during their in-house investigation.
Following up the recommendations by the Texas Water Development Board, the
Archeological Research Laboratory, Texas A&M University, surveyed the remaining 102
acres and recorded 41BZ118, a probable farmstead complex occupied during the late
1800s and early 1900s (Thoms 1993b). This site was considered to possess significant
research potential, and testing was suggested if avoidance is not possible. Testing was
also conducted at 41BZ112, and testing and archival work was conducted at 41BZ115.
Site 41BZ115 was recommended for further work if avoidance is not possible and that
portion of 41BZ112 in the project area was not considered significant.
The most recent large-scale archaeological investigation in Brazos County was
conducted at the site of the proposed Bush Presidential Library Center by Archaeology
Consultants, Inc. in May of 1993 (Moore and Warren 1993). Archaeologists examined 203
acres and recorded two prehistoric sites (41BZ124 and 41BZ125). Neither site was
considered significant, and additional work was not recommended.
10

Prehistoric site 41BU16, in adjacent Burleson County, was excavated by personnel
from the Archeological Research Laboratory, Texas A&M University in 1984 (Roemer and
Carlson 1987). The site produced four burned rock hearths and four human burials, all
probably dating later than 4950 Before Present (B.P.). It is believed they belong to the
Middle Lithic or Middle Archaic period of Texas prehistory. Site 41BU16 represents the
first major controlled excavation of a prehistoric site in close proximity to the current project
area. The report provides a detailed summary of the archaeology for the area and must be
considered a major reference for neighboring Brazos County.
Winnie's Mound (41BU17), a major prehistoric site in Burleson County, was
excavated by Bradley Bowman (1985). This locality produced twelve human burials,
numerous chipped stone artifacts, fired clay balls, wattle-and-daub fragments, and a few
sherds of pottery. It is suggested that the site was used as a prehistoric cemetery with two
burial groups resulting from Middle Archaic and Late Archaic occupations. Evidence of
Paleoindian occupation was found in the form of a San Patrice point, and a Plainview-like
point, both found in situ during the excavation.
Various aspects of Brazos County history have been documented in the form of
books, theses, and articles. A history of the county written for the Texas Sesquicentennial
celebration by the Brazos County Heritage and History Council and the Family History
Foundation is the most comprehensive study that has been done at this time. This book
was written by several authors and edited by Glenna Fourman Brundidge (1986).
The current project area is located within the boundaries of a large region consisting
of eleven counties and described by Kotter (1981:30-34) in his discussion of the Millican
Reservoir Project. According to Kotter (1981:30), this region forms a geographic and
environmental unit that exhibits traits that differ from nearby areas and cannot be classified
as belonging to any of the presently defined adjacent cultural expressions. In his scheme,
the Brazos River forms the approximate western boundary, and southern Brazos and
Grimes counties represent the southern boundary. Kotter's prehistoric chronology is
divided into three major periods or lifeways: Paleoindian, Archaic, and Formative. This
chronology is tentative and often relies on comparative data from adjacent regions.
Archaeological reports containing detailed discussions of the prehistoric chronology
of this area appear in the following and are recommended as additional reading: Kotter
(1981), Prewitt (1981), Roemer and Carlson (1987), Moore and Warren (1993), Thoms
(1993a, 1993b), and Kenmotsu and Perttula (1993).

RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS
Examination of the files at TARL in Austin, Texas revealed no sites have been
recorded in the project area. There was also no indication that any portion of the 945-acre
proposed Traditions Golf and Country Club at University Ranch had been surveyed by a
professional archaeologist. Several significant archaeological projects, however, have
been carried out in Brazos County and vicinity (see Archaeological Background above).
Four archaeological sites (4BZ131-41BZ134) were recorded as a result of the field survey.
Site 41BZ131 contains a prehistoric component and a historic component, and the
remaining sites (41BZ132-41BZ134) are solely prehistoric.
41BZ131
This is a multi-component site located on a sandy upland ridge surrounded by
Turkey Creek and two of its tributaries at an elevation of 312 feet above mean sea level
(Figure 2). The prehistoric component is described in this report as an occupation site
containing artifacts dating from the Paleoindian through Late Prehistoric periods.
Topographic coverage is the USGS 7.5' Chances Store, Texas quadrangle dated 1962 and
photorevised 1980. This site was designated in the field as Temporary Site (TS) 1. The
site area and vicinity is depicted in Figure 4.
The size of this site is unknown due to the amount of disturbance created by the
mining of sand for sale. In the approximate center of the site area is an undisturbed portion
of the original landform that contains the historic component; a house, cistern base,
livestock pens, and outbuildings. The size of this area is estimated at 100 x 100 m. Based
on the landform as depicted on the topographic quadrangle, the site may have been as
large as 250 x 350 m. Away from the house are three "islands". These are areas where
the original landform has been left undisturbed; they are used as backstops for target
practice.
Four shovel tests produced artifacts that were collected (Appendix I). Ten chert
flakes were recovered for an average of 2.5 flakes per positive test. All prehistoric artifacts
were found between 10 and 20 cm. Three tests yielded historic artifacts and flakes in the
same level, and indication of disturbance in the first 20 cm. No temporally diagnostic
prehistoric artifacts were recovered from the shovel tests. Two backhoe trenches (BT)
were excavated in the site area (Appendix III). Backhoe Trench 1 was excavated at the
edge of the landform on which the house is located. The size of this trench was 1.6 m long
x 5.0 m wide and dug to a depth of 4 m. No artifacts were recovered, and it was concluded
that the upper 190 cm of this unit consisted of disturbed soil that had been imported to
shore up the eroded bank.

Backhoe Trench 2 was excavated along the western edge of one of the islands that
was not disturbed when sand was mined at the site. The exposed profile revealed loamy
fine sand to a depth of 150 cm overlying red sandy clay (150-210 cm) and a red and gray
sandy clay (210-240 cm). Eight flakes were recovered from this trench between 10 and 40
cm. Visibility in the disturbed area was estimated by the survey crew to be at least 50%.
On the surface, several flakes (not collected) and one dart point base (collected) were
observed. The dart point base (Figure 5) was found very close (within 3 m) to BT 2. This
is the only temporally diagnostic artifact found at 41BZ131 by the survey crew. Although
this specimen has not been definitely identified by type, it strongly resembles the Morrill
type as described by Turner and Hester (1985:129). Morrill points date to the Early to
Middle Archaic. This specimen is made of Georgetown chert and appears to be broken
due to an impact fracture. It measures 24 mm at its widest point and is 5 mm thick.

Figure 5. Morrill Point from 41BZ131.
In addition to the artifacts collected by the survey crew, the lessee of the house at
41BZ131, Bill Moos, has a collection that he claims was found in the disturbed area around
the house following the mining for sand. This collection contains Paleoindian (Plainview,
Angostura, and Early Stemmed), Archaic (Pedernales, Godley, and Gary), and Late
Prehistoric (Scallorn) specimens. This artifact collection was analyzed by William A.
Dickens and is discussed in Appendix VI. During the geoarchaeological investigation at
41BZ131 backhoe trenches 17-19 were excavated in the site area. Backhoe Trench 17
was excavated at one of the islands where BT 2 had been dug earlier during the field
survey (Figure 4). This trench did not yield any cultural materials. Backhoe Trench 18 was
excavated in the area that had been mined for sand and revealed a shallow sandy layer
overlying clay with no artifacts found. These two trenches were used to help define what
are believed to be the original site boundaries. Backhoe Trench 19 was excavated over
100 meters south of the estimated site boundaries. This trench produced one flake mixed
with small gravels. This was not considered adequate evidence for extending the site
boundary this far to the south.

The historic component is a wooden frame pier and beam house (Figure 6), a
cistern (Figure 7) made of locally obtained petrified wood (water collector from top is
missing), and recently constructed outbuildings (Figure 8) and livestock pens (Figure 9).
According to the current landowner, Dexter T. Gabbard (personal communication,
September 16, 1999), the house was constructed in the 1940s as a tenant house, and
the land was used for agricultural purposes. In the 1970s it was remodeled, and the
architectural integrity was destroyed. Although the historic component meets the age
requirement for the National Register of Historic Places, it possesses no architectural or
historical significance and, as a result, does not contain research potential. No further
work is recommended for the historic component at 41BZ131.
41BZ132
This is a prehistoric occupation site with an Archaic component on a sloping hillside
in an open meadow surrounded by two tributaries of Turkey Creek at an elevation of 305
feet above mean sea level (Figure 2). Two temporally diagnostic artifacts, a Carrollton dart
point (Figure 10a), and a dart point base (Figure 10b) were found at this site; therefore,
41BZ132 is believed to date to sometime during the Middle Archaic period, circa 2000 B.C.
to 1200 B.C. The dart point base is complete and includes a portion of the basal edge of
one shoulder and is made of Brazos Valley chert. The base is expanding with a convex
basal edge. It measures 21.8 mm long, 25.6 mm wide, and 8.4 mm thick. Several locally
occurring point types, the Axtell and Palmillas, have expanding stems and convex basal
edges (Turner and Hester 1993:75-76, 167). However, the base is too fragmented to
positively identify it to a known type. Topographic coverage is the USGS 7.5' Chances
Store, Texas quadrangle dated 1962 and photorevised 1980. It was designated in the field
as TS 2.

The size of this site, based on shovel tests and backhoe trenches, is 60 m
northwest/southeast by 90 m northeast/southwest (Figure 11). At the time of the survey,
the ground cover consisted of Bluestem grasses, various forbs, and scattered oak and
juniper trees. The ground surface visibility was estimated at 40%. No disturbance from
mechanical operations such as farming or mining were observed.

Artifacts were collected from seven shovel tests at this site (Appendix I). Thirtyseven chert flakes were recovered for an average of 5.28 flakes per positive test. Flakes
recovered per test varied from 3 (ST 20) to 12 (ST 18). Artifacts were found in all seven
levels (0-70 cm). These tests were dug to clay, and they ranged in depth from 20 to 70
cm. Materials recovered consisted of primary, secondary, and tertiary flakes. Also present
were pieces of non-cultural material such as petrified wood fragments, potlids, and chert
shatter (not collected).
During the geoarchaeological study, five backhoe trenches (21-22, 24-26) were
excavated in the site area. Three of these (Figure 10) produced cultural materials including
the Carrollton dart point, an untyped dart point base, and a feature consisting of firecracked rock and burned chert flakes. Unfortunately, this feature was destroyed by the
backhoe before it could be examined. Despite the lack of charcoal and oxidized
sediments, this feature consisted of fire-cracked rock large enough to be resistant to
pedoturbation and was probably intact. The results of the geoarchaeological study appear
in Appendix V. All cultural materials collected during the geoarchaeological study were
examined by a lithic analyst (Appendix VII).
41BZ133
This is a prehistoric occupation site located on the crest of a wooded sandy hill
between two tributaries of Turkey Creek at an elevation of 332 feet above mean sea level
(Figure 2). No temporally diagnostic artifacts were found at this site; therefore, its age is
not known. Topographic coverage is the USGS 7.5' Chances Store, Texas quadrangle
dated 1962 and photorevised 1980. This site was designated in the field as TS 3.
The size of this site, based on shovel tests, is 100 m northeast/southwest by 180 m
northwest/southeast (Figure 12). At the time of the survey, the ground cover consisted of a
hardwood forest with patches of greenbriar, leaves and other forest debris. The ground
surface visibility was estimated at less than 20%. No disturbance from mechanical
operations such as farming or mining were observed.
Artifacts were collected from sixteen shovel tests at this site (Appendix I). Seventynine chert flakes were recovered for an average of 4.93 flakes per positive test. Flakes
recovered per test varied from 1 (ST 47) to 15 (ST 52). Artifacts were found in nine levels
(0-90 cm). Only five of the sixteen shovel tests were dug to clay; they ranged in depth from
65 to 110 cm. Materials recovered consisted of primary, secondary, and tertiary flakes.
Also present, were pieces of non-cultural petrified wood, potlids, and chert shatter (not
collected).

During the geoarchaeological study, one backhoe trench (13) was excavated on the
site (Appendix V). Several trenches were planned for this site; however, thick woods made
it impossible to dig additional trenches in the desired areas. Backhoe Trench 13 produced
cultural materials (flakes), but no intact deposits or features were observed. All cultural
materials collected during the geoarchaeological study were examined by a lithic analyst
(Appendix VII).
41BZ134
This is a prehistoric occupation site located on the crest of a wooded sandy hill
overlooking Turkey Creek to the southeast and one of its tributaries to the southwest at an
elevation of 270 feet above mean sea level (Figure 2). No temporally diagnostic artifacts
were found at this site; therefore, its age is not known. Topographic coverage is the USGS
7.5 Chances Store, Texas quadrangle dated 1962 and photorevised 1980. This site was
designated in the field as TS 4.
The size of this site, based on shovel tests, is 20 m northwest/southeast by 40 m
northeast/southwest (Figure 13). At the time of the survey, the entire site area was
obscured by a hardwood forest with patches of greenbriar, leaves, and other forest debris.
The ground surface visibility was estimated at less than 20%. No disturbance from
mechanical operations such as farming or quarrying were observed.
Four shovel tests in the site area produced artifacts that were collected (Appendix I).
Eight chert flakes were recovered for an average of 2 flakes per positive test. Artifacts
were found in 7 levels (0-80 cm). All of the tests were dug to clay with the deepest being
terminated at 110 cm. Materials consisted of tertiary flakes with only a few specimens
exhibiting traces of cortex. All of the flakes are of locally available chert.
Summary
Four prehistoric sites (one with a historic component) were identified as a result of
the cultural resources survey of the 945-acre Tradition Golf and Country Club at University
Ranch Project. Site 41BZ131 is largely destroyed through quarrying for sand and lacks
intact deposits. This site is significant in that Paleoindian through Late Prehistoric artifacts
have reportedly been found in the disturbed areas where sand had been removed. It
should be stated here that although Mr. Moos has a small collection of projectile points
from the site, they were obtained by someone who examined the broad areas of erosion at
this site over many years. Few artifacts were found during testing at the site during this
project. At site 41BZ131, an Early to Middle Archaic dart point (Morrill) was found on the
disturbed surface by the field survey crew. Site 41BZ132 produced one Middle Archaic
dart point (Carrollton) and a dart point base found in a backhoe trench during the
geoarchaeological study. Burned rock was also recovered which suggests the presence of
a hearth. Unfortunately, part of the hearth was destroyed by the backhoe.

Site 41BZ133 failed to produce any features or temporally diagnostic artifacts;
therefore, the age of this site is not known. Site 41BZ132 is located on a sandy upland
ridge in more shallow soils than site 41BZ133 which is situated in deep sandy soils, some
areas deeper than 110 cm beneath the existing ground surface. Site 41BZ134 failed to
produce any features or temporally diagnostic artifacts; therefore the age of this site is not
known. In addition, it appears to be a rather small occupation site at 20 x 40 m. The
cultural materials at all of the sites in the project area were found in loosely compacted
sandy soils
No natural chert cobbles large enough to be used in tool manufacture were found in
shovel testing or backhoe trenches at any of the four sites; nor were any observed on the
surface or along the creeks in the project area. It is believed that the raw material used for
this purpose was imported from other locations closer to the Brazos River to the southwest.
Evidence of imported raw materials was found in the form of a Morrill dart point base
(Figure 5) from 41BZ131 made of Georgetown chert, a type of Edwards Chert that occurs
in Central Texas and several pieces of translucent chert that, according to William A.
Dickens (personal communication, September 23, 1999) is not common to this area. The
Carrollton point is made from petrified wood that may have been obtained locally.
Associated with the cultural materials found during shovel testing and backhoe
trenching were pieces of shatter, potlids, and small fragments of petrified wood. These
items were determined to be non-cultural and were not retained for curation. During the
geoarchaeology study, however, burned flakes and fire-cracked rock, were found at
41BZ132. The fire-cracked rock consisted of large pieces of chert, quartzite, and
sandstone (some found in the wall of the backhoe trench) that are found naturally in this
area but not on that landform. This strongly suggests at least one buried hearth is present
at 41BZ132. Although some flakes retained evidence of lips or bulbs, most are classified
as flake fragments. The shallow soils at 41BZ132 may indicate a single component
Archaic site.
All four sites are situated in an upland environment, an area for which
archaeological data are limited for Brazos County. Due to the number of projectile points,
tools, and flakes collected at the Gabbard site (41BZ131), it may represent a site that was
used on a more permanent basis. Sites 41BZ132 - 41BZ134, however, have yet to
produce similar evidence, and it is hypothesized that they may represent short-term
occupation sites where lithic tool rejuvenation was a major activity. These may also be
referred to as "satellite" camps that were visited on a regular basis by the occupants of
more permanent camps in the area. The close proximity of these sites to 41BZ131
suggests that Paleoindian and early Archaic materials may be present as well, a
hypothesis partially confirmed by the presence of a Carrollton point at 41BZ132.

24

RECOMMENDATIONS
Four prehistoric sites were recorded as a result of this investigation. Although a
number of Paleoindian and Archaic artifacts were reportedly found at the site by Mr. Moos,
the prehistoric component at site 41BZ131 (as found during this project) consists of a
paucity of artifacts in a deep, homogeneous sandy mantle. Therefore, it is not believed
that hand-excavated test units would recover significant data. This site has been virtually
destroyed and is not eligible for the National Register of Historic Places or as a State
Archeological Landmark. The historic component at site 41BZ131 is not architecturally or
historically significant. The house has been remodeled and the pens and outbuildings are
recent. The petrified wood cistern base may also be recent. Therefore, no additional work
is recommended.
Site 41BZ132 contains cultural materials, including a possible hearth, in a
homogeneous sandy mantle. An examination of this site by the geoarchaeologist failed to
determine that the artifacts are buried in an intact stratum. This site is not eligible for the
National Register of Historic Places or as a State Archeological Landmark. No further work
is recommended.
Site 41BZ133 contains cultural materials in a deep, homogeneous sandy mantle.
An examination of this site by the geoarchaeologist failed to determine that the artifacts are
buried in an intact stratum. This site is not eligible for the National Register of Historic
Places or as a State Archeological Landmark. No further work is recommended.
Site 41BZ134 contains cultural materials in a deep, homogeneous sandy mantle.
This site is not eligible for the National Register of Historic Places or as a State
Archeological Landmark. No further work is recommended.

REPRESENTATIVE SHOVEL TEST PROFILES

APPENDIX III: BACKHOE TRENCH LOG
Backhoe Trench 1
Size: 1.6 m x 5.0 m
Depth: 400 cm
Profile: 0-120 cm; disturbed clay
120-170 cm; loamy fine sand (10YR 6/2)
170-190 cm; disturbed clay
190-340 cm; loamy fine sand (10YR 6/2)
340-370 cm; clayey sand (2.5YR 4/8)
370-400 cm; clayey sand (2.5YR 4/8)
Cultural Evidence: none
Discussion: The upper 190 cm of this unit consisted of disturbed soil that had been
hauled in and deposited to shore up an eroded bank near the Lessee's house. In
the undisturbed profile there was no evidence of previous occupation.
Backhoe Trench 2
Size: 2 m x 5 m
Depth: 240 cm
Profile: 0-15 cm; humus and grass roots
15-150 cm; loamy fine sand (10YR 6/2)
150-210 cm; loamy fine sand (10YR 6/2) with several discontinuous, thin
strata of red sandy clay containing pea-sized chert pebbles.
210-240 cm; sandy clay (2.5YR 4/8)
Cultural Evidence (30 cm levels):
Level 1 - 2 pieces of chert debitage
Level 2 - 3 pieces of chert debitage
Level 3 - 3 pieces of chert debitage
Level 4 - 1 piece of chert debitage
Discussion: This unit was placed in the cutbank of an "island" which was left
unexcavated when the surrounding surface was mined for sand. The surface of the
island is about 2 m higher than the remaining surface of the mined area. Although
chert artifacts were found as deep as 120 cm, no intact features or other evidence
of cultural occupation were noted.

Backhoe Trench 3
Size: 1.8 m x 5.5 m
Depth: 320 cm
Profile: 0-15 cm; fine sandy loam (10YR 6/1)
15-190 cm; clay (10YR 6/2)
190-320 cm; clay (10YR 7/3)
Cultural Evidence: none
Discussion: This unit was located about 20 m from a tributary of Turkey Creek. No
evidence of previous occupation was noted.
Backhoe Trench 4
Size: 1.6 m x 5.0 m
Depth: 210 cm
Profile: 0-40 cm; fine sandy loam (10YR 6/2)
40-150 cm; clay (10YR 5/1)
150-210 cm; clay (10YR 7/3)
Cultural Evidence: none
Discussion: This unit was located about 20 m from the bank of a tributary of Turkey
Creek. No evidence of previous occupation was noted.

Backhoe Trench 5
Size: 1.4 m x 5.2 m
Depth: 260 cm
Profile: 0-10 cm; fine sandy loam (10YR 6/2)
10-180 cm; clay (10YR 5/2)
180-260 cm; clay (10YR 7/4)
Cultural Evidence: none
Discussion: This unit was located near the crest of a hill that was suspected to be a
high probability area for cultural resources. The actual crest of the hill was deep in
a hardwood forest that was impassable for the backhoe. Therefore, this unit was
excavated as near as possible to the preferred location and on a rise above a
tributary of Turkey Creek.

Backhoe Trench 6
Size: 1.6 m x 5.0 m
Depth: 210 cm
Profile: 0-30 cm; fine sandy loam (10YR 6/2)
30-70 cm; sandy clay (2.5YR 4/8)
70-210 cm; sandy clay (10YR 6/1)
Cultural Evidence: none
Discussion: This unit was excavated as near to the crest of a high probability hill as
possible given the thick woods in the area. The soils map indicated the same soil
on this hill as that surrounding the Lessee's house where site 41BZ131 was
recorded (Lakeland soils). However, the soil in the tested area was clayey, and no
cultural evidence was noted.
Backhoe Trench 7
Size: 1.4 m x 5.0 m
Depth: 200 cm
Profile: 0-30 cm; fine sandy loam (10YR 6/2)
30-80 cm; sandy clay (2.5YR 4/8)
80-200 cm; clay (10YR 6/1)
Cultural Evidence: none
Discussion: This unit was excavated as near as possible to previously recorded site
41BZ2 and was also near Turkey Creek. The soils were clayey, and no cultural
evidence was noted.
Backhoe Trench 8
Size 1.4 m x 5.0 m
Depth: 190 cm
Profile: 0-40 cm; fine sandy loam (10YR 6/2)
40-60 cm; sandy clay (2.5YR 4/8)
60-90 cm; sandy clay (10YR 6/1)
Cultural Evidence: none
Discussion: This unit was about 20 m from the bank of Turkey Creek. No cultural
evidence was noted.

Backhoe Trench 9
Size 1.5 m x 5.0 m
Depth: 200 cm
Profile: 0-40 cm; fine sandy loam (10YR 7/1)
40-100 cm; sandy clay (10YR 5/2)
100-200 cm; sandy clay (10YR 8/4)
Cultural Evidence: none
Discussion: This unit was about 30 m from the bank of Turkey Creek. No cultural
evidence was noted.
Backhoe Trench 10
Size 1.4 m x 5.0 m
Depth: 190 cm
Profile: 0-30 cm; loamy fine sand (10YR 6/2)
30-150 cm; (sandy clay (10YR 6/1)
150-190 cm; clay (10YR 6/3 )
Cultural Evidence: none
Discussion: This unit was located in the southern portion of the survey area
approximately 300 m uphill from 41BZ132. The sandy surface was only 30 cm
thick and underlain by clay. No evidence of previous occupation was noted.
Backhoe Trench 11
Size: 1.6 m x 5.1 m
Depth: 240 cm
Profile: 0-30 cm; fine sandy loam (10YR 6/2)
30-70 cm; sandy clay (10YR 5/2)
70-130 cm; clay (10YR 6/3)
130-200 cm; fine sand (10YR 8/1)
200-240 cm; clay (10YR 6/3)
Cultural Evidence: none
Discussion: This unit was in the southern half of the survey area on a small, round
hill about 800 m uphill from 41BZ133. There was a stratum of fine white sand from
130-200 cm that may have been a previous "A" horizon at some time in the distant
past. Or, possibly, this area has been disturbed by nearby petroleum production
activities. No evidence of previous occupation was noted.

Backhoe Trench 12
Size: 1.2 m x 5.2 m
Depth: 200 cm
Profile: 0-30 cm; loamy fine sand (10YR 6/2)
30-150 cm; sandy clay (10YR 6/1)
150-200 cm; clay (10YR 6/3)
Cultural Evidence: none
Discussion: This unit was in the southern half of the survey area at the highest
elevation in the project area (340 feet). This area is a watershed divide. Runoff
water from this point drains to the southeast, while most of the remainder of the
project area drains northwestward to Turkey Creek. No evidence of previous
occupation was noted.

LITHIC ANALYSIS (41BZ131)
Introduction
The artifacts in the possession of William Moos were collected over a tenyear span around the house that he currently occupies. This property is now slated
to be part of the Tradition Golf and Country Club at University Ranch Project, and
Mr. Moos has graciously provided his collection for study. The collection consists of
17 artifacts; 15 projectile points, 1 broken biface, and 1 bifacial tool. Previous to Mr.
Moos' occupancy, the property around the house was subjected to an extensive
sand mining operation that removed most of the sand for approximately 100 yards
in any direction. The remaining topography consists of an undulating, shallow sand
layer over a clay base. The inevitable natural erosion soon revealed that,
intermixed within the remaining sand deposits, was the remnants of a prehistoric
occupation, the rest having been carried away by the sand removal. The area
quickly became known to local artifact collectors who were, subsequently, refused
entry soon after Mr. Moos' residency began. Mr. Moos began collecting artifacts
eroding from the surface around his house and other parts of the property. Over
time, he collected a number of flint flakes, projectile points, and flint tools. This
study, however, is only concerned with the formal tools from around the house (now
known as the Gabbard site - 41BZ131). Each artifact was studied and analyzed to
determine its type, age, function, and place within the regional archaeological
record. Metric data can be found in Table 1, and a chronological chart appears as
Table 2. The collection is illustrated in figures 1 and 2.
Projectile Points
The projectile points consist of 14 dart points and 1 arrow point. The types
include Plainview or Plainview-like (n=4), Angostura (n=1), San Patrice (n=1), Early
Stemmed (n=1), Pedernales (n=3), Godley (n=2), Gary (n=1), untyped large dart
point (n=1), and one Scallorn arrow point.
Plainview (n=4)
Specimen 1 (Figure 1a) is the largest Paleoindian specimen in the collection.
It contains a severe impact fracture at the tip that removed the tip and almost 1/2 of
one lateral edge. A small series of distally directed flakes from the tip suggest that
there was some attempt at rejuvenating that end. It is made of a yellow-brown,
semi-translucent flint, probably from local gravel. The basal stem edges and base
are ground.

Specimen 2 (Figure 1b) is best described as Plainview-like rather than a
classic Plainview. The main difference being that it has a more contracting base
and thicker cross-section than normal Plainview points, yet it is not as narrow as the
Angostura type. It has been heavily reworked, a process that resulted in the
removal of over 1/2 of its total length. Both the basal stem edges and base are
ground. Although the surface contains a heavy, white patina and is sand polished
to a high gloss, it appears to be made of Georgetown flint from Central Texas.
Specimen 3 (Figure 1c) is represented by the basal half of a large point.
This is a large point that exhibits grinding on one edge that extends 35.1 mm in
length. The other edge was broken off at the corner, and a later attempt at
modifying the edge removed the remaining edge grinding. Also, there was an
additional minor modification distally in an attempt at re-forming the tip. This
specimen is made of light yellow/dark brown colored chert gravel.
Specimen 4 (Figure 1d) has been reworked into a perforator. All edges
exhibit some re-chipping, even the basal edges. Some grinding, however, is still
present on the edges as well as the basal edge. The tip has had several distally
oriented flakes removed from both faces forming a chisel-like point. It is made of
yellow-tan colored chert gravel.

Angostura (n=1)
This point type is described as being a slender leaf-shaped lanceolate point
with random to parallel-oblique flaking (Turner and Hester 1993:73). The lateral
edges are straight to slightly convex in shape, and the stem contracts, often
noticeably. The base is slightly concave with short basal thinning flakes. The initial
description is based on specimens from the Plains region; however, these points
vary widely in shape and flaking, often causing some confusion in identification.
One of these variations from Texas is known as the Texas Angostura that is
narrower than the Plains type. It dates to the late Paleoindian period around 7000
B.C. and the Early Archaic period about 5000 B.C. (Perino 1985:15; Turner and
Hester 1993:73).
Specimen 1 (Figure 1e) is typical of the Texas Angostura variety having a
strongly constricting base and remnants of slightly parallel-oblique flaking. It has
been extensively re-sharpened as evidenced by beveling and slight serrations
along both lateral edges. It also contains a severe impact fracture that removed
approximately half of its total length. This fracture also caused a large "flute-like"
flake distally on one face. It appears to be made of heavily patinated white
Georgetown flint.
San Patrice (n=1)
This type is characterized by a deep concave base with a ground basal
edge. The base is also thinned by the removal of several "channel" flakes often
forming a flute that extends to the middle of the point and sometimes more. The
shoulders are weak to strong and are found near the juncture of the lateral edge
with the basal corner. Several varieties have been described. They are Hope and
St. Johns (Turner and Hester 1993:181). San Patrice points date from the
Paleoindian period, circa 8000 B.C - 6000 B.C. (Turner and Hester 1993:181) to the
Early Archaic period (Perino 1985:337-339).
Specimen 1 (Figure 1f) is larger than average, otherwise it is typical of the
type. The shoulders and the basal edge are ground, and it is made from a yellowbrown chert. Most of the surface has been heated producing several large pot-lids
and a reddish color.

5

Early Stemmed (n=1)
This point form is characterized as being side-notched or corner-notched
with ground stems and bases and beveled from re-sharpening. The basal edge
ranges from slightly concave to slightly convex. At this time many refer to this type
as the Wilson Point named for specimens recovered at the Wilson-Leonard site. It
dates from the Late Paleoindian period at 9470 to 9650 Before Present (Turner and
Hester 1993:106).
Specimen 1 (Figure 1g) is typical of the type. It is side-notched, and both
the notches and the base have been ground. The base is slightly convex, and the
lateral edges have been beveled from re-sharpening. It is made from creamcolored chert gravel.
Pedernales (n=3)
This form is highly variable. The blade is triangular, but varies from narrow
to broad. Shoulders may be weak to prominent, barbed or straight, and the tip is
often needle-like. The most characteristic element is the stem that may be slightly
expanding, rectangular, or constricting with a deep concave basal edge that is often
thinned by the removal of a large vertical thinning flake. These points date to the
Middle Archaic, about 2000 B.C. - 1200 B.C. (Turner and Hester 1993:171).
Pedernales points have been found in the region by other researchers at 41BZ1
(Collins 1955).
Specimen 1 (Figure 2a) is typical of the type. It is a narrow form with weak
shoulders. It has been re-sharpened, resulting in the beveling of both edges. It is
made of a gray chert.
Specimen 2 (Figure 2b) is a broad form with prominent shoulders and a
slightly expanding stem. The tip is missing, and the edges are beveled from resharpening. The surface is patinated over a gray chert.
Specimen 3 (Figure 2c) is heavily damaged. One corner of the base, both
shoulders, and one-third of the distal tip are missing. It appears to have been a
broad form. It has been subjected to fire that has changed the color of
approximately one-half of its surface to a dark red. This burning, however, did not
contribute to the present damaged state. The material is a yellow chert.

6

Godley (n=2)
This type is described as being a small triangular point (often somewhat
narrow) with convex lateral edges and prominent shoulders that are not barbed.
The stem is weakly expanding with a slightly convex basal edge. It has been
placed in the Late Archaic to Late Prehistoric periods somewhere between 500
B.C. and A.D. 500 (Turner and Hester 1993:125; Perino 1985:152).
Specimen 1 (Figure 2d) is typical of the type. The extreme distal tip is
missing, and the blade has not been re-sharpened. It is made of light yellow chert
gravel.
Specimen 2 (Figure 2e) is also typical of the type. It has one corner of the
stem missing, and the blade has been re-sharpened with both beveling and
serrations present. It is made of yellow chert gravel.
Gary (n=1)
This form is highly variable. It is often crude but may also be well made.
The blade is triangular with concave to convex edges. The shoulders are obtuse to
prominently barbed, and the stem is contracting with a rounded to pointed base
(Perino 1985:144). In Texas, it is placed in the Middle to Transitional Archaic
period between 2500 B.C. and A.D. 700-800 (Turner and Hester 1993:123).
Specimen 1 (Figure 2f): The extreme basal edge is missing on this
specimen, but the remaining portion of the stem and the shape of the blade suggest
it is a Gary point. The entire specimen is covered with a white patina making
material identification other than chert impossible.
Scallorn (n=1)
This type is a small arrow point that is characterized by a triangular blade
with straight to convex lateral edges, corner notches, and a broad wedge-shaped
stem often as wide as the shoulders. The basal edge is usually convex or straight
to concave. It dates to the Late Prehistoric period at A.D. 1700 - A.D. 1200 (Turner
and Hester 1993:320).
Specimen 1 (Figure 2g) is typical of the type. It has a longer, narrower blade
than usual, and its stem is more rounded on the corners. The tip is missing from an
impact fracture, and it is made of yellow chert gravel.

7

Unknown Large Dart Point (n=1)
Specimen 1 (Figure 2h) does not fit a known type. It is a long point with
straight to slightly convex lateral edges. Approximately one-third of the distal tip is
missing. The stem is small (comparative to the length of the blade) and
rectangular. Both lateral edges have been re-sharpened and are serrated. Resharpening was accomplished bifacially, although at a rate of one face per resharpening episode. This is evidenced by a slight unifacial re-chip on each edge.
Once dulled, the other face would be re-sharpened. This technique will maintain a
more or less uniform rounded edge as opposed to a beveled edge. The entire
surface is covered with a white patina making material identification other than
chert impossible. The large size and the presence of small serrations along the
edges suggest it was probably used as a knife. Although not identifiable to a
known type, similar examples are known from local collections. Based on its
characteristics, it probably dates to the Middle Archaic period.
Biface Fragment (n=1)
This is the mid-section of a large biface (Figure 2i). Both distal and proximal
edges have received a transverse bending or snap fracture, making its exact shape
unknown. It does appear to have been a finished piece as evidenced by its thin
cross-section and the presence of minor retouch on its edges. It was probably
used as a cutting tool. The material is a gray-brown chert that closely resembles
some forms of Edwards chert.
Bifacial Tool (n=1)
This tool is identified as an Erath Biface (Figure 2j). It is a small triangular to
sub-triangular tool that has some similarities to the Clear Fork Gouge, although its
lateral edges are more constricted than those of the Clear Fork. The bit, or working
edge, is bi-convex in cross-section and may be slightly convex to concave. Its
function was as an adze for woodcutting and chopping tasks. It has been dated to
the Transitional Archaic about A.D. 200 - A.D. 550 (Turner and Hester 1993:253).
This specimen is complete and shows extensive wear to its working edge that
contains some crushing and step fracturing. The entire surface has a white patina,
making exact material identification impossible.

Discussion
This small collection contains a number of very early projectile point forms
that have only been sporadically recorded in Brazos County. These points include
the Plainview, Angostura, San Patrice, and Early Stemmed and range from the late
Paleoindian (8000 B.C.) to the Early Archaic (5000 B.C.). Although these point
types are often noted in local collections, they are rarely encountered in any
quantity.
The Thurman site (41BZ73) is not far from this project area, and it produced
a large number of the same projectile point forms (Shafer 1977:190). Deposits
containing the artifacts were removed during construction of Loop 2818 and used
as fill in an adjacent field. There they remained until the construction of the Texas
Hall of Fame dance hall, at which time local collectors discovered them. Although
significant for the county, there was little that could be learned from the site due to
its destruction during highway construction.
Unfortunately, sand removal from most of the site that contained the Moos
specimens probably removed most of the site's cultural material. Ironically, the
presence of these early projectile points may not have come to light had the sand
not been removed. Many of these upland sites contain later archaeological
materials that are often encountered near the surface through plowing and minor
land clearing activities. However, a great deal of the county's uplands are
composed of deep deposits of sand that have effectively buried any early cultural
materials and, subsequently, are only encountered after the sand deposits have
been removed. It was just such an activity that exposed the deposits containing the
Moos specimens. Figure 3 illustrates the disturbance to site 41BZ131 caused by
the mining of sand for sale.
The recording of this collection is significant. The relative scarcity of
Paleoindian material within Brazos County makes the study of any locally found
artifacts of this time period important. Therefore, the Moos collection represents a
significant contribution to the early archaeological record of Brazos County.

APPENDIX VII
LITHIC ANALYSIS (41BZ132 and 41BZ133)
INTRODUCTION
Four lithic tools, 137 pieces of debitage, 11 heat and heat fractured quartzite
cobbles, and 3 fragments of fire-cracked rock were recovered from sites 41BZ132
and 41BZ133. The artifacts were recovered from three backhoe trenches
excavated at 41BZ132 and one backhoe trench excavated at 41BZ133. All but 20
flakes and 1 quartzite cobble were recovered from 41BZ132. The artifacts were
sorted into categories (i.e., projectile points, edge modified flakes, debitage, and
non-flaked stone) and each specimen was individually analyzed and the data
recorded on coding forms.
PROJECTILE POINT
A single complete projectile point and a dart point base were recovered.
The complete point, identified as a Carrollton point (Figure 5b in Results and
Conclusions of this report) was found in Backhoe Trench 21 (Level 2), and the base
was from Backhoe Trench 26 (Level 1).
Carrollton (n=1): This example is typical of the type that is characterized by a
triangular blade with prominent squared or barbed shoulders. The blade edges are
straight to slightly convex, and the stem is roughly straight with a slightly convex
base. Stem edges and the base are often smoothed (Suhm and Jelks 1962:171;
Turner and Hester 1993:85). It dates to the Middle Archaic, and its distribution is
centered in the Dallas area along the Trinity River but decreases towards the
northeast and south (Turner and Hester 1993:85). Locally, this point type has been
recorded from the Anson Jones Plantation site (41WT5) in Washington County
(Dickens 1995:181). This specimen is complete with no sign of reworking and is
made of a fairly good grade of silicified wood that has been subjected to some postmanufacture heating that turned the surface red. Its maximum length is 45.3 mm
with a stem length of 12.4 mm, a width of 25.4 mm, and a thickness of 7.9 mm.
Both the stem edges and its base are smoothed.
Basal Fragment (n=1): This specimen is a complete base that includes a
portion of the basal edge of one shoulder and is made of Brazos Valley chert. The
base is expanding with a convex basal edge. It measures 21.8 mm long, 25.6 mm
wide, and 8.4 mm thick. Several locally occurring point types, the Axtell and
Palmillas, have expanding stems and convex basal edges (Turner and Hester
1993:75-76,167). However, the base is too fragmented to positively identify it to a
known type.

EDGE MODIFIED FLAKES
This category includes several tool types that range from an expedient usemodified flake to a simple re-touched edge modified cobble fragment. Expedient
flakes are simple flakes selected for a specific task, usually of short duration, and
discarded shortly after use. Most are modified through use resulting from activities
such cutting or butchering. The flakes were selected from debitage piles or
produced from cores as needed. Edge modified tools differ from expedient flakes
by the occurrence of purposeful edge modification. These modifications usually
consist of small pressure or light percussion flaking used to sharpen or shape an
edge. These tools may be abandoned after a short use or re-worked into another
tool for another function.
Expedient Flake (n=1). This specimen is a single flake made of silicified
wood having a single utilized edge and was recovered from 41BZ132 at level 2 of
Backhoe Trench 21. It has been subjected to post-manufacture heating that turned
its surface a reddish color. The modified edge is slightly rounded and contains
minor bifacial micro-flake scars and edge crushing that is consistent with cutting
activities on a hard surface such as wood (Keeley 1981:35-36). The entire surface
is polished from sand, giving it a lustrous sheen thus eliminating any use related
edge polish.
Edge Modified Cobble (n=1). This specimen was recovered from 41BZ132
in level 2 of Backhoe Trench 21 and is made on a small cobble fragment of Brazos
Valley chert. It measures 53.4 mm long, 39.4 mm wide, and 24.4 mm thick. The
cobble has been split and had its distal end removed. There was an early attempt
at modifying this end into a sharp edge by lateral flake removals from the ventral
face and longitudinal flake removal from the dorsal face. The ventral face has had
several flakes removed that were probably preformed during preparation of the
edge and platform for dorsal flake removal. Both lateral edges were unifacially
flaked with edge angles of 67Î and 88Î, respectively, and exhibit rounding and
minor bifacial micro-flake scars. The wear patterns and edge angles are consistent
for use as a scraper (Keeley 1981:38,45).
DEBITAGE
In all, 117 flakes were recovered from 41BZ132, and 20 flakes were
recovered from 41BZ133. The difference in totals between the two sites can be
attributed to the fact that three backhoe trenches were dug at 41BZ132 and only
one at 41BZ133. Normally, it is too time consuming to analyze both broken and
complete flakes (Stahle and Dunn 1982:86), but due to the low numbers of flakes
recovered, it was felt that each flake should be analyzed.

2

ANALYSIS
Analysis of flake debitage is an invaluable tool in determining a number of
activities and strategies that were conducted at a particular site. To accomplish
this, a number of attributes were coded for and recorded for a statistical evaluation.
This process began with size grading each flake. It has been determined that
reductive processes and stages of reduction can be defined through the maximum
size of a flake (Ahler 1988:10; Stahle and Dunn 1982:86); therefore, each flake was
size graded through a series of eight nested sieve screens. The screen sizes are:
(1) 50 mm or 2 in., (2) 37.5 mm or 1 1/2 in., (3) 25 mm or 1 in., (4) 19 mm or 3/4 in.,
(5) 12.5 mm or 1/2 in., (6) 9.5 mm or 3/8 in., (7) 6.3 mm or 1/4 in., and (8) <6.3 mm.
Additional debitage variables coded for included material type, presence of
cortex, heat treatment, platform preparation, type of bulb of percussion, and flake
termination. The type of raw material is useful in determining method of material
procurement, preparation, reduction, and ultimate artifact morphology (Dockall
1991; Shafer 1971). The presence and amount of cortex helps determine the type
and degree of reduction applied to a core or flake. For example, most local raw
materials are small chert cobbles that are completely covered with a hard "rind"
called cortex that is unsuitable for tool use. Thus, as the cobble is reduced, the
cortex is also removed and, as the cobble is further reduced, the amount of cortex
is proportionately reduced until finally removed. Three cortex stages have been
established: (1) primary decortication flakes or those completely covered with
cortex on the platform and most of the dorsal surface, (2) secondary decortication
flakes or those partially covered with varying amounts of cortex on the platform and
dorsal surface, and (3) tertiary decortication flakes that have no cortex.
The identification of heat alteration can help determine whether purposeful
annealing has occurred or if heating was from some other factor. The platform is
the flat surface on top of the flake where the blow removing the flake was received
(Whittaker 1994:14). These are either natural (cortex covered) or prepared, and
their use is a variable controlled by the knapper (Whittaker 1994:91). Thus, the
recognition of platform types can help to further determine reduction strategies.
The type of bulb of percussion (a swelling immediately below the platform) is
usually is an indicator of whether a hard hammer (stone) precursor or a soft
hammer (bone or wood) precursor was used. Very prominent bulbs usually
indicate hard hammer use, and more flattened or diffuse bulbs indicate soft
hammer or light hard hammer use (Whittaker 1994:185).

3

Finally, successful tool manufacture is dependant upon each successive
flake removal. When a flake is removed from a core or biface a "scar" is left on the
core or the surface of a biface, and the type of termination of this scar can
determine whether additional flakes can be removed with desired results. The most
desirable termination type is the "feathered" type that is distinguished by having
distal or lateral edges that are very thin and sharp. This flake type will allow
additional flakes to be removed with little problems. However, "stack" or "hinge"
type terminations may prevent additional flake removal by failing to detach evenly
and smoothly. Such terminations usually result in a buildup of material and/or
diving into the surface forming "valleys," both of which could result in unsuccessful
reduction and failed tool manufacture.
RESULTS OF ANALYSIS
Brazos County lies within a region that contains an abundant supply of raw
materials. Chert, quartzite, and silicified wood occur throughout Brazos and
adjacent counties. Brazos River chert occurs as gravel in alluvial terrace deposits
as well as within the Brazos River and other local streams (Dickens 1995:179-181).
In addition to chert, these gravels are composed of limestone, quartzite, jasper,
igneous rock, and silicified wood. These materials vary considerably in size,
texture, color, and quality, but are generally of an excellent quality well suited for
the manufacture of stone tools.
A list of the raw material types and counts from both sites is provided in
Table 1. Brazos Valley chert was the primary raw material recovered from both
sites, accounting for 77% of the material from 41BZ132 and 95% of the material
from 41BZ133. In addition, there are a number of flakes (n=8) of Colorado River
chert. These chert types are distinctive from the Brazos River types, especially in
color and texture, and occur principally within the Colorado River drainage region
south of Austin and as far north as the Yegua Creek system in Washington County
(Dickens 1995:180). The nearest occurrence of Colorado River chert from the
project area is approximately 30 miles, a distance easily accessible by local
prehistoric peoples.

Silicified wood is another locally abundant material, occurring in the project
area in very large quantities and some exceptional sizes. Generally, its quality is
not sufficient for successful tool manufacture, but occasionally good quality pieces
can be found and utilized, such as the projectile point recovered from 41BZ132.
The occurrence of opal or opalite within the region is not common; however, it is a
beautiful material of excellent knapping quality distinguished by a clear
translucency or, occasionally, a slightly opaque white color.
41BZ132
As previously indicated, 117 flakes were recovered from three backhoe
trenches (BT-21, BT-22, and BT-26). Of these, 77% (90 flakes) are of local
gravels, 15.4% (18 flakes) are silicified wood, 6.8% (8 flakes) are Colorado River
Gravel, and .8% (1 flake) is an opal or opalite (Table 1). Reviewing flake grade and
condition (Table 2), it is noted that there are only 42 complete flakes, the majority
being fragmented or heat shattered. Only one flake was a primary (cortex covered)
flake, and it was classed as heat shatter. The rest are secondary and tertiary or
interior flakes. Of the 117 flakes examined (Table 3), 59 had not been altered by
heat, and the rest exhibited some alteration resulting from contact with heat. The
majority of these flakes range from slightly colored red, usually on the edges, to
completely colored red. These lack potlids and crazing fractures usually associated
with long term or excessive exposure to heat and suggest only limited exposure to
heat such as would result from naturally occurring or man induced grass fires
(DeVivo 1990; Foster 1998:174-176).
The size grades represented did not exceed 3/4 in. or 19 mm and, combined
with the lack of primary flakes, it appears that only final tool manufacture and/or tool
re-juvenation and maintenance tasks were preformed. Final tool manufacture
revolves around the reduction of previously reduced cobbles or blanks that have
had most of the cortex removed. In small cobble reduction it is advantageous to
either split the cobble or remove large flakes.

The small size of these materials naturally regulates the maximum size of
the finished tools; thus, one must be conservative during reduction. For example,
maintaining as much width as possible during reduction is important. Unless the
initial cobble is very wide, constant platform preparation and lateral removals often
result in a very narrow bank. Therefore it is often more advantageous to initially
thin the blanks from the longer ends and limit the number of lateral removals until
the blank is sufficiently thinned. The cortex on Brazos Valley chert is thin and hard
and usually will not hinder flake removal. It is often left on various parts of the
blank, such as the lateral edges, until the final stages of reduction. Evidence
supporting this type reduction strategy would be small flakes covered with natural
cortex or those with plain platforms (Dickens 1993:134-136).

Further evidence for final tool manufacture is more diffuse bulbs, platforms
with lips, and feather terminations. Strong bulbs of percussion are usually
associated with hard hammer initial flake removals and are a result of heavy blows
required to remove the cortex and large initial flakes. As reduction proceeds, flake
size and force are reduced and the bulbs become more diffuse. Flakes removed in
this stage usually terminate in a thin or feathered edge. Platforms with lips often
indicate removal by a "soft hammer precursor,â such as antler, bone, or wood as
opposed to a "hard hammer percussorâ, such as stone.
Table 4 provides a list of the various attributes commonly found on knapped
flakes. Forty-seven flakes from the project area have natural or plain platforms, 41
have diffuse bulbs, and 46 have feather terminations. In addition, there are eight
flakes with platforms containing lips. Flakes with small lips, as well as flakes with
no lips, are also indicative of tool rejuvenation and maintenance tasks where edges
are sharpened or re-formed. Thirty-eight of the 42 complete flakes are 1/2 inch or
smaller. Thus, this flake analysis suggests that both final tool manufacture and tool
maintenance activities were being conducted at site 41BZ132.
41BZ133
Twenty 20 flakes were recovered from a single backhoe trench (BT-13).
This number of flakes is low, but it should be mentioned that an additional 75 flakes
were recovered during shovel testing. These specimens had been taken to TARL
and were, unfortunately, not available for this analysis.
Reviewing the data compiled in tables 1-4 reveals that only 7 of the 20 flakes
were complete, and all were secondary and tertiary. They all fall within size grades
6-8 (less than 3/8 in or 9.5 mm), and are all made of Brazos Valley chert. Of the
seven, 3 have diffuse bulbs, 2 have natural platforms, and 2 have plain platforms.
All have feathered terminations. More intense burning is indicated in the greater
proportion of heat shattered flakes and potlids. Even though there are only a few
flakes, it appears that similar activities, final tool manufacture and/or tool
maintenance, occurred on 41BZ133 as had occurred on 41BZ132.

NON-FLAKED STONE
This category includes all the non-flaked stone recovered. It consists of 6
small quartzite cobbles, 1 jasper cobble fragment, and 2 small chert cobbles from
41BZ132 and 1 chert cobble from 41BZ133, all of which exhibit varying degrees of
burning. In addition, there are three small angular fragments (1 silicified wood, 1
quartzite, and 1 sandstone) from 41BZ132 that are consistent with descriptions of
fire-cracked rock.
Quartzite was used for a variety of functions. The most common use is as a
hammerstone in lithic reduction, but it was also used as boiling stones. These
stones were repeatedly heated in a fire or on coals and then dropped into a water
filled skin bag causing the water to boil. Quartzite is made up of large silica crystals
that allow the stone to expand and contract without fracturing when heated.
Repeated heating will, however, eventually cause the stone to fracture. Chert, on
the other hand, will explode and/or shatter upon rapid heating and cooling and
would, therefore, be of no use in such tasks. Sandstone and other locally derived
igneous rocks work well in hearths for heat retention, but will eventually fragment
into small chunks during heating and cooling episodes.
One of the quartzite cobbles from 41BZ132 contains some battering on one
end, indicating its use at one time as a hammerstone. However, it has been heated
causing one end to fracture and changing its surface color to red. This specimen
and two other quartzite cobbles, that also exhibit heating, were recovered from
Backhoe Trench 26 (Level 2). The remaining cobbles (3 quartzite, 1 jasper) from
41BZ132 were all from Backhoe Trench 22 (Level 1). Like those from BT-26, all of
these show signs of burning and fracturing. The two chert cobbles from 41BZ132
(BT-22, Level 1; BT-26, Level 2) and the one from 41BZ133 are both heavily heat
fractured and may be the result of accidental contacts with a hearth or wild fire as
their nature to explode and shatter makes their use in heating tasks too dangerous.
As previously indicated, the three small angular stone fragments from
41BZ132 (BT-22, Level 1) are defined as fire-cracked rock. These would have
served as "liners" in the bottom or around the edges of a fire to facilitate heat
retention. This technique is used in both simple cooking and/or heating fires as well
as in earth ovens. Thus, their presence and the collection of heated quartzite and
chert cobbles indicate the presence of a hearth feature.

CONCLUSIONS
The analysis of the artifacts and other materials recovered from 41BZ132
and 41BZ133 indicate a number of tasks were preformed. The debitage shows that
final tool finishing and tool maintenance tasks were conducted. The absence of
primary and large flakes usually associated with initial reduction supports this. In
addition, the absence of bifaces and cores suggests that only small amounts of
materials were brought to the site and that these were utilized efficiently and that
occupation episodes were probably of a short or brief duration. The only datable
artifact (i.e., the Carrollton point) dates the occupation to at least the Middle Archaic
or 2000 to 1200 B.C.
The presence of burned cobbles, some fire-cracked rock, and the
abundance of flakes that have been shattered by heat indicate that hearth features
are present. Some of the smaller heated chert cobbles and flakes may have been
burned from grass fires. Hunting practices of the regional Late Prehistoric peoples
included the use of fire in the manipulation of bison (Foster 1998174-176) and other
desired game animals. Such burning activities would undoubtedly have some
effect on any lithic materials, such as chert, exposed on the surface. However, the
construction of hearths and campfires on top or near these materials would also
have the same result.
