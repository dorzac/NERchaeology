Abstract
Flatrock Enginering and Environmental, Ltd. of San Antonio, Texas contracted with Tierras
Antiguas Archaeological Investigations to conduct a cultural resources linear survey of the
Colorado City Mainline right-of-way in Howard, Mitchell, and Scurry counties, Texas. The Area
of Potential Effect is 40.2 miles long x 80 feet wide, for a total of 390 acres. The entire right-ofway will cross publicly owned properties, and the entire project is privately funded; thus no state
Antiquities Permit was required. However, the pipeline will be bored under the Colorado River,
a U.S. Army Corps of Engineers jurisdictional area. The cultural resources survey of that crossing
has been reported separately, and is referenced in this report.
Tierras Antiguas archaeologists conducted a thorough pedestrian survey and dug 18 shovel tests
during the period September 14 thru 25, resulting in the documentation of three prehistoric sites
(41MH62, 41HW130-131), five historic sites (41MH101-105), and two isolated prehistoric finds.
In all cases, Tierras Antiguas assessed the sites and isolated finds as possessing minimal research
potential.
Accordingly, Tierras Antiguas recommended that the project should be considered as having “no
effect” on any properties considered as eligible for nomination to the National Register of Historic
Places or inclusion in the State Archeological Landmarks Program, and as such, the project should
be allowed to proceed without further archaeological work. However, if any cultural resources are
encountered during construction, work should immediately be halted in the vicinity until such
finds are examined and evaluated by Tierras Antiguas, or by any qualified archaeological
consultant, and by the Texas Historical Commission.
No artifacts were collected and curated during this project.

Acknowledgments
There are mainly three individuals who are greatly appreciated, and whose efforts contributed to
the successful planning, organization, and completion of this project. They are Mr. Wade Ingle,
Senior Partner at Flatrock Engineering and Environmental, Ltd., and Ms. Judy Vader, and Mr.
Brannon Norton, Project Managers at Flatrock Engineering and Environmental, Ltd. All were
extremely amiable and helpful throughout the project, and their overall knowledge of the project
contributed significantly to our understanding of the project’s scope of work.
It was indeed a pleasure working with both Morgan Kubala and Jimmy Tomlinson at Navigator
Energy Services, LLC from their office in Big Springs, and Contract Land Specialists Kala Carter,
Doug Garber, and Shelly Wooten.
Another individual who was extremely helpful in the completion of this report is Joel Butler who
masterfully created the map overlays presented. In addition, I very much relied upon Crew Chief
i

Belisario Silva, and archaeological Field Technicians Alex McBride and Devin Sorrows with
Tierras Antiguas. They are dedicated individuals, and as always, these three “hosses” worked
meticulously to ensure all aspects of this investigation were thoroughly documented in accordance
with Texas Historical Commission and Council of Texas Archeologists standards.

Introduction
Navigator Energy
Services, LLC of
Big Spring, Texas
is the lead agency
for the Colorado
City Mainline that
is proposed for
construction
through privately
owned properties
in Howard,
M i t chell, and
Scurry counties in
northwestern
Texas (Figures 17).
Navigator Energy
Services in turn
contracted with
F l a t r o c k
Engineering and
Environmental,
Ltd. of San
Antonio to ensure
the requirements Figure 1. Location of the Project Area in Texas.
for environmental
and cultural assessments would be conducted in a professional compliance manner. At the request
of Flatrock, Tierras Antiguas Archaeological Investigations (TAAI) conducted a cultural resources
survey of the Project Area (PA) during the period September 14 thru 25, 2014.
The project is privately funded, and will cross privately owned properties; thus no Texas
Antiquities permit was required. However, the pipeline will be bored under the Colorado River,
a U.S. Army Corps of Engineers jurisdictional area. The cultural resources survey of that crossing
has been reported separately, and is referenced in this report (Nickels 2014).
The survey was conducted under the guidelines of the Texas Historical Commission (THC) and
Council of Texas Archeologists (CTA). In addition to a surface survey of the 40.2-mile right-ofway, Tierras Antiguas excavated 18 shovel tests adjacent to river and stream crossings.

Project Setting
Geology
As shown in Figure 9, the Colorado City Mainline will cross over and through six geological
formations (Barnes 1994; Judson and Kaufman 1990):
Ogallala Formation (PoMo) formed during the Pliocene and Miocene Epochs within the Tertiary
Period, and is made up of sand, silt, clay, and gravel. These underlying deposits are capped with
hard caliche several feet thick that is clearly observed on the eroding caprock canyonlands.
Gravels where present, are comprised of localized quartz and quartzite lenses, sandstone,
limestone, chert, igneous, and metamorphic rocks. These gravels, along with surrounding
sediments and soils are commonly found in the eroded lower canyonlands.

8

Late Pleistocene and Quaternary-aged Alluvium (Qal) is made up of windblown sand, alluvium,
and fluviatile terrace deposits. These relatively recent alluvial deposits are commonly found on
nearly level floodplains, and low terraces along stream channels in Howard, Mitchell, and Scurry
counties.
The Blackwater Draw Formation (Qbd) is slightly younger than the Ogallala Formation, forming
during the early Pleistocene Epoch, and early Quaternary Period. Eolian in nature, it consists of
fine-grained quartz, silty loams and clay loams found on upland areas in this area of northwest
Texas (Holliday 1989).
Sand Sheet deposits (Qs and Qsu) and occur along the southwestern-most portion of the Colorado
City Mainline (see Figure 9). These are also windblown sands and silts much like those of the
Blackwater Draw Formation, and of an approximated same antiquity. Sand Sheet deposits are
commonly found on dunes and dune ridges.

Figure 9. Geological map of the Project Area.

9

Quaternary undivided (Qu) deposits are temporally co-eval with Blackwater Draw and similar
sand sheet deposits (Qs and Qsu) along the Colorado City Mainline. However, although they are
essentially eolian deposits in nature, they are comprised of silts and fine sands that have been
deposited in sheets across broad and sloping landscapes by sheetwash action.
The final formation mapped along the Colorado City Mainline that encompasses roughly 80
percent of the right-of-way is the Dockum Group (Trd). The Dockum Group is also the oldest of
the formations shown in Figure 9, forming during the Triassic Period. It is comprised of sandy and
silty clays, sandstone, fine-grained quartz, and bedded shales. Lithics occurring in the lower
portions include quartz, sandstone slabs, chert, and petrified wood.
Soils
As shown in Figures 10-20, the Colorado City Mainline will dissect 46 different soil types that are
of varying depths, resulting primarily from alluvial processes related to the Colorado River, as
well as eolian processes. As such, these various soil classifications otherwise imply the potential
for the preservation of intact cultural resources to exist (Dixon et al. 1973; Holder et al. 1969;
Stoner et al. 1969; Websoil Surveys 2014).Our assessment of these soils to encapsulate deeply
buried and intact cultural materials are then presented in Table 1.

Elevations, Rivers, and Streams
Elevations along the Colorado City Mainline range from 2,000 feet in southern Scurry County to
2,616 feet in northeastern Howard County. The main feature dissecting the Project Area is the
Colorado River. The Colorado River drains Mitchell County from the northwest to the southeast,
fed by first-order tributaries Big Silver Creek, Willow Creek, Beals Creek, Wildhorse Creek,
Champion Creek, Lone Wolf Creek, Hasting Creek, and Little Sulphur Creek. The Colorado River
meanders significantly in the southern portion of Mitchell County, as it has cut through the
Callahan Divide, a line of east-west trending hills (Amin and Leffler 1996). Scurry County is also
drained by the Colorado River, as it cuts across the southwestern portion of the county. Otherwise,
major tributaries of the southeasterly flowing Clear Fork of the Brazos River rise in Scurry County
(Leffler 1996). In Howard County, the major drainages are the North Concho River, as well as
Morgan and Wild Horse creeks (Long 1996).

Flora, Fauna, and
Climate
The Project Area lies

of Texas (Figure 21).
within the Great Plains
region. However, the
Project Area lies just
below the High Plains
area, near the Caprock
escarpment. The High
Plains are highest in
their southern most
portion, on the Llano
Estacado Caprock,
with elevations
reaching over 3,200 ft
above mean sea level
(amsl). Running from
the northern portion of
the Texas Panhandle
southward into Central
Texas, the Caprock
escarpment forms an
abrupt boundary
between the flat Llano
Estacado and the
deeply incised and
r a p i d l y e r o d i n g Figure 21. Physiographic Regions of Texas (2014).
Caprock Canyonlands
along its eastern edge. The Caprock Canyonlands become less rugged and incised as the
southeasterly flowing rivers broaden their valleys, and enter the Lower Plains region, encompassing
generally rolling, low hills and ridges (Boyd 1995; Parsons 1967; Carroll 1996). The topography
of the Project Area is generally typified by an undulating nearly level to rolling landscape with
predominately rangelands on loamy and dry soils. However, portions of the Project Area in Howard
County lie at the eastern tip of the Permian Basin, at the southeastern edge of the Llano Estacado
Caprock, and near the western edge of the Edwards Plateau.

19

As s ho wn i n
Figure 22, the
Project Area is
situated in the
southern-most
portion of the
Kansan Biotic
Province as
described by Blair
(1950). The
Kansas Province
includes the
Permian redbeds
region south of the
Red River, east of
the High Plains
escarpment, and
west of the
Edwards Plateau.
The Permian red
plains consist of
open mesquite

Grasslands are
prevalent, with
mixed grasses such

several species of grama, and buffalo grass. These mesquite plains further exhibit areas of mesquite
mottes and a few other shrubs, interspersed by large areas of grasses, as well as forbs such as
broomweed and gaillardia. Interspersed are also shin-oak and sand sage.
However, the Kansan Province is drained by numerous rivers and intermittent lesser streams that
allow for larger trees such as oak, elms, hackberries, and maples to survive and thrive. Understory
cedars are also prominent in such environs. At least 59 mammal species have been catalogued
within the Kansan Province, as well as land turtles, 14 species of lizards, and 31 snake species.
The modern climate of the Project Area is classified as semi-arid, with an average annual rainfall
of roughly 16 to 20 inches. Large fluctuations in temperature occur throughout the year, with
average daily maximum temperatures averaging about 960F in July, to around 290F degrees in
January. The combination of variable rainfall and temperature patterns results in frequent droughts
as well as sporadic periods of abundant moisture, resulting in a growing season of roughly 214-217
days (Amin and Leffler 1996; Leffler 1996; Long 1996).

Cultural Context and Chronology
The Project Area presumes
cultural affinities both
indigenous to the western
edge of the north-central
Texas region as well as
intrusive influences from
the Southern Great Plains
(Figure 23). Several
scholars have offered
sound but differing
arguments for cultural
chronologies for the
Southern Great Plains
extending into northern
Texas. The cultural
chronology, defined by
complex (in lieu of the
terms phase, interval, or
period) of the North
American High Plains has
been synthesized by
Hofman et al. (1989), and
m o r e r e c e n t l y, t h e
Southern High Plains in Figure 23. Map of Texas Archaeological Regions (adapted from
Texas by Johnson and Black 1989).
Holliday (1995) and Boyd
(1995). It should be noted that the Southern Great Plains complexes are defined by shifts in
climatic conditions and subsistence more so than changes in point style, which are indicators of
change in central and south Texas. The following discussions are primarily derived from Johnson
and Holliday (1986, 1995), Boyd (1995), and Hofman et al. (1989). All dates are approximate and
given as years before present (B.P.).
Pre-Clovis
Although humans may have inhabited the landscape before 11,500 B.P, solid evidence does not
support their existence. Although human behavior is inferred on stone artifacts from mammoth
bones at the Waco Site (Fox et al. 1992:51-73), all are problematic. At Lewisville Lake on the
Southern High Plains of north-central Texas, radiocarbon dates initially believed to be from burned
charcoal in human campfires, and approximating an antiquity of 40,000 years were later disproved
as dates on natural coal (Stanford 1982:208-209).
As Collins (1995:380-381) offers, eroded landforms are not likely to yield solid stratigraphic proof
of human occupation earlier than late Pleistocene, and if we do find earlier occupations on stable
21

landforms, what comprises the signature of a Pre-Clovis culture? The Gault Site in Bell County,
Texas has provided by far the largest Clovis assemblage in all of North America, and with artifacts
stratigraphically beneath the known Clovis component, likely has the best chances of providing
conclusive evidence for a pre-Clovis culture in Texas (Adavasio and Page 2002:292-294; Collins
and Brown 2000; Gault Site 2014).
Paleoindian
The Paleoindian period began toward the close of the Pleistocene. The Southern Great Plains were
occupied by Clovis (Llano), Folsom and other complex peoples between approximately
11500-8000 B.P. (Hofman et al. 1989:29-45). During the Paleoindian interval, Hurt (1980) suggests
an association with the Southern Plains and Trans-Pecos regions. Diagnostic artifacts include
Clovis and Folsom projectile points. Certainly the wide distribution of Clovis-type points across
most of North America and even into Central America suggests a wide dispersal of the people who
made them. Within Texas' political boundaries, Meltzer and Bever (2007) have documented the
presence of over 500 Clovis points. Other artifacts associated with the Clovis culture include
bifaces and prismatic blades, engraved stones, bone and ivory points, stone bolas, ochre, and shaft
straighteners.
In general the Paleoindian adaptation has been considered to be one of small bands of nomadic,
big-game hunters following herds of Late Pleistocene fauna, including mammoth, mastodons,
bison, camel, and horse, across North America (Black 1989a). More recently, emphasis has been
placed on the wide diversity of plants and animals used for subsistence by these early Americans
(Black 1989a; Hester 1983), such as turtles and tortoises, alligators, mice, badgers, and raccoons
(Collins 1995:381), although they undoubtedly hunted the large animals as well (Dibble and
Lorraine 1968). Known Clovis sites include killsites, quarries, caches, open campsites, ritual sites,
and burials (Collins 1995: 381-383; Hester 1995:433-436). A Folsom interval follows the Clovis,
except perhaps in the Southern Great Plains where a transitional complex of artifacts with dart
points called “Goshen” may be present (Hofman et al. 1989:34; Irwin-Williams et al. 1973).
A well-documented Paleoindian Clovis site in the southern Great Plains is the McLean site in
Taylor County, west of Abilene (Ray and Bryan 1938; Sellards 1952). Folsom sites in the area
include the Scharbauer site in northwestern Midland County (Wendorf et al. 1955), and the
Adair-Steadman site in north central Nolan County (Tunnel 1977). A fourth site nearby containing
a Milnesand component is Lone Wolf Creek in northeastern Mitchell County (Wormington 1957).
By far, the most robust collection of Paleindian artifacts has been recovered at the Gault Site in Bell
County, Texas. Archaeologists estimate that over 2.3 million Paleoindian artifacts have been
recovered, with only about 3% of the site professionally excavated thus far (Gault Site 2014).
As the warming that marks the transition from Pleistocene to Holocene climates began to take
effect in Texas, prehistoric inhabitants adapted with changes in lifestyle. This climatic shift is also
marked by the decline and extinction of mammoth, mastodon, horse, camel, and giant bison (Bison
antiquus). With the possible exception of the Berclair Terrace site (Sellards 1940), archaeological
evidence suggests that after 8000 B.P., large gregarious game animals were either extinct or
otherwise extricated from Texas. Human hunters were forced to concentrate on deer, antelope, and

22

other medium-size or smaller game. Changes in the subsistence base required technological shifts
that mark the beginning of a new cultural period known as the Archaic.
Early Archaic
The Early Archaic on the Southern Great Plains is approximated at 8000-5000 B. P. (Hofman etal.
1989), although Johnson and Holliday (1986) offer more fine-grained dates for the Llano Estacado
from the Lubbock Lake site of 8500–6400 B.P. The extinction of large herds of megafauna and the
changing climate at the beginning of the Holocene stimulated a behavioral change by the
Prehistoric inhabitants of South Texas (McKinney 1981). While the basic hunter-gatherer
adaptation probably remained intact, an economic shift away from big game hunting was necessary.
In general, more intensive exploitation of local resources in central Texas, such as deer, fish, and
plant bulbs is indicated by greater densities of ground-stone artifacts, fire-cracked rock cooking
features, and more specialized tools such as Clear Fork gouges and Guadalupe bifaces (Turner et
al. 2011). Weir (1976) speculates that Early Archaic groups were small and highly mobile, an
inference from the fact that Early Archaic sites are thinly distributed and that diagnostic types are
seen across a wide area, including most of Texas and northern Mexico. Hurt (1980) suggests that
the decline in the number of bison on the plains forced the inhabitants to broaden their diets to
pursue plants and animals which would produce the same amount of calories and protein with the
same or slightly more effort expended. Using projectile points as temporal markers, Hurt (1980:vi)
argues that the Colorado City Mainline area was used more frequently in the Early Archaic than
in the Middle and Late Archaic, probably due to “decline of bison and other game animals on the
Southern Plains.” Story (1985), however, believes that population densities were low during this
period, and that groups consisted of related individuals in small bands with “few constraints on
their mobility” (Story 1985:39). Their economy was based on diffuse utilization of a wide range
of resources, especially such year-round resources as prickly pear and lechugilla, as well as rodents,
rabbits, and deer (Story 1985:38).
Middle Archaic
The Southern Plains Middle Archaic complex as derived from changes in climate and subsistence
is recognized generally as the period between 5000–3000 B.P. (Hofman et al. 1989:45-47), and
more specifically as 6400–4500 B.P. on the Llano Estacado (Johnson and Holliday 1986:46). The
Middle Archaic appears to have been a time of increased population, based on the large number
of sites from this period in south and central Texas (Story 1985:40; Weir 1976:125, 128). The
reasons for this increase are not known, but the amelioration of a very dry period (Altithermal)
during the Early Archaic is often seen as the prime mover (Sollberger and Hester 1972:338; Story
1985:40). A wide variation in projectile point styles at the Jonas Terrace site suggest "a time of
ethnic and cultural variety, as well as group movement and immigration." (Johnson 1995:285). Hurt
(1980) posits that the quantity of diversified game animals on the Southern Great Plains decreased,
and thus lead to an intensified, less broad diet. On the South Texas Plains, exploitation of widely
scattered, year-round resources such as prickly pear continued (Campbell and Campbell
1981:13-15), as did hunting deer and rabbit. However, a shift to concentrated, seasonal nut harvests
in the riverine environments of the Balcones Escarpment seems to have occurred (Black 1989a).
Weir (1976) believes that an expansion of oak on the Edwards Plateau and Balcones Escarpment
led to intensive plant gathering and acorn processing. He also believes that the widely scattered
bands prevalent in the Early Archaic now began to coalesce, at least during the acorn-gathering
23

season, into larger groups who shared the intensive work of gathering and processing the acorn
harvest (Weir 1976:126). Many researchers believe burned rock middens are a result of this
endeavor (Creel 1986; Prewitt 1991; Weir 1976). Other investigators doubt this conclusion (e.g.,
Goode 1991), but the exact processes which formed the burned rock middens are still a matter of
controversy (Black 1989b:28; Black et al. 1997; Hester 1991; Leach and Bousman 1998).
On the Edwards Plateau, they may have come together to gather acorns, and then built large
cooking ovens to steam the tanic acid out of them to make them edible (Weir 1976). The large
cooking ovens were apparently used over and over again. Whether they were repeatedly used
within just a few years or over several hundred years is still being debated, but the consensus seems
to be that they were used to cook not only deer, but also a great deal of tubers and other plants
(Black et al. 1997; Mauldin et al. 2003). These large cooking ovens which contain mounds of
accumulated fire-cracked rocks are called “burned rock middens” in the archaeological community,
but are sometimes referred to as “Indian mounds” by artifact collectors.
The common presence of deer remains in burned rock middens encourages the view that deer
processing took place at burned rock midden sites (Nickels et al. 2001; Black and McGraw
1985:278; Weir 1976:125). Bison bone is encountered in archaeological sites in central and south
Texas, at least occasionally, during all but the earliest part of the Middle Archaic (Dillehay 1974).
There has been a tendency to equate presence of burned rock middens with absence of bison
(Prewitt 1981); however, examinations of several recent faunal reports show that after about 4500
B.P. bison and burned rock middens are contemporaneous, though not at the same sites, at least in
the southern Edwards Plateau and northern South Texas Plain (Meissner 1993).
Late Archaic
Hofman's (1989:45) synthesis of the data places the Late Archaic on the Southern Plains as
3000–2000 B.P., and possibly later. Johnson and Holiday (1986:46) specify 4500–2000 B.P. as the
Late Archaic period on the Llano Estacado. Some researchers believe populations increased
throughout the Late Archaic (Prewitt 1985), while others feel populations remained the same or fell
during this period (Black 1989b:30). Prewitt (1981:80-81) asserts that the accumulation of burned
rock middens nearly ceased during the course of this period; however, excavations at the Blue Hole
site in Uvalde County (Mueggenborg 1994:1-74), the Honey Creek midden at 41MS32 (Black et
al. 1997), the Jonas Terrace site in Medina County (Johnson 1995), a series of middens at Camp
Bowie in Brown County (Mauldin et al. 2003), and the Mingo site in Bandera County (Houk and
Lohse 1993:193-248) provide evidence that large cooking features up to 15 m in diameter were still
very much in use (see also Black et al. 1997). Subsistence is assumed to have become less
specialized and focused on acorns, in favor of a broad spectrum subsistence base (Black 1989b:30).
Hurt (1980) asserts that bison began returning to the Southern Great Plains area, and we see an
increase in intensive processing of bison, as well as mussel shells during the Late Archaic.
However, by about 1450 B.P., bison had again disappeared (Dillehay 1974).
The proliferation of distinguishable human cemeteries has been attributed to this period, with the
earliest occurrences dating to the south Texas Middle Archaic (Hester 1995:439-440). At Loma
Sandia, these date between ca. 2550 and 2750 B.P. (Taylor and Highley 1995). Story (1985:44-45)
believes the presence of cemeteries at sites such as Ernest Witte (Hall 1981), Hitzfelder Cave
24

(Givens 1968), and Olmos Dam (Lukowski 1988) indicates that Late Archaic populations in central
and south Texas were increasing and becoming more territorial. Hurt (1980) further posits that
population in the Colorado City Mainline area peaked during the Late Archaic with groups moving
into the area from Central Texas; before that the complex of artifacts found in the region were more
closely associated with those of the Trans-Pecos region.
Although inhabitants of the South Texas Plain near Brownsville and Rockport had begun to make
pottery by about 1750 B.P., the northern part of the plain was still "pre-ceramic" until 1,000 years
later (Story 1985:45-47). Late Archaic points tend to be much smaller than Middle Archaic points.
The most common are Ensor and Frio types (Turner et al. 2011), both of which are short, triangular
points with side notches. The Frio point also has a notched base (Turner et al. 2011).
Transitional Archaic
During the Early Neo-Indian period on the Southern Great Plains (ca. 950–1450 B.P.), Hurt (1980)
presents evidence for perhaps a decrease in bison processing; consistent with Dillehay's (1974)
contention that there are now less bison available in the area due to climatic changes, which also
lowered water tables to alkalinity levels.
Late Prehistoric/Plains Woodland
The term “Plains Woodland or Woodland” is commonly used on the Southern Great Plains. A
series of distinctive traits marks the shift from the Archaic to the Late Prehistoric period, including
the technological shift to the bow and arrow and the introduction of pottery. Two complexes
following the Late Archaic in the Southern Great Plains region are the Plains Woodland from about
2000-1150 B.P., and the Plains Village from 1150-450 B.P. (Hofman 1989:61-90). Most
researchers agree the early Late Prehistoric period was a time of population decrease (Black
1989b:32). Though small burned rock middens associated with Scallorn and Edwards points have
been found (Goode 1991:71; Houk and Lohse 1993:193-248), they are rare. Settlement shifts into
rockshelters such as Scorpion Cave in Medina County (Highley et al. 1978) and Classen
Rockshelter in northern Bexar County (Fox and Fox 1967) have been noted (Shafer 1977; Skinner
1981). Cemeteries from this period often reveal evidence of conflict (Black 1989b:32).
Huebner (1991:354-355) suggests that the sudden return of bison to south and central Texas
resulted from a more xeric climate in the plains north of Texas, and increased grass in the
Cross-Timbers and Post Oak Savannah in north central Texas, forming a “bison corridor” into the
South Texas Plain along the eastern edge of the Edwards Plateau. However, according to Hurt
(1980), the Late Neo-Indian period on the Southern Great Plains (ca. 950 – 450 B.P.) is mirrored
in the archaeological record by an absence of bison and vegetal matter, most likely due to the
increased alkalinity in the region's water sources.
Protohistoric/Historic Period
The end of the Late Prehistoric and beginning of the Historic period on the Southern Plains in
northern Texas should be characterized by written accounts of European contact with indigenous
groups, and is often labeled the “Protohistoric”. On the Southern High Plains, Hofman (1989:91)
agrees that “The Protohistoric period is encompassed by the time when there were limited European
contacts with the area and brief records of these journeys, but no proper history.” The cultural
25

context for the historic groups in the area of study is largely conditioned by the presence of outside
ethnic groups and regional power struggles. The numerous small groups of Jumanos and
Coahuiltecans encountered by the early explorers and later Spanish intrusions are addressed in
many sources (Campbell 1983; Campbell and Campbell 1985; Hester 1989; John 1975; Newcomb
1961; Swanton 1952). The various later intrusive groups, such as Tonkawa, Lipan Apache, and
Comanche, are also described by numerous researchers (Ewers 1969; Hester 1989; Jones 1969;
Kelley 1971; Newcomb 1961, 1993; Sjoberg 1953a, 1953b).
At the beginning of the seventeenth century, many south Texas Indian groups were being pushed
northward by continual Spanish expansion. By the mid-seventeenth century, a new pressure on the
Indians indigenous to the area began to come from the north: a nomadic group, the Apache adapted
to a more Plains-lifeway style of bison hunting once they acquired horses from the Spaniards
(Campbell and Campbell 1985:27). Later, the Apaches were to be displaced by another group of
nomadic, bison-hunting Indians - the Comanches - from the high-lands of central Texas (Campbell
1991:111).
A combination of migration, demoralization, inner-group conflict, disease, and death due to warfare
fragmented the native Indian groups, and forced continual mixing and re-mixing among them
(Bolton 1915; Campbell 1975, 1991:345; León et al. 1961). Most of the native languages have been
lost, although recent attempts at reconstruction are enlightening (e.g. Johnson 1994; Johnson and
Campbell 1992).

Site Types to be Expected Along the Colorado City Mainline
Prehistoric Open Campsites
Most numerous among the sites recorded in Howard, Mitchell, and Scurry counties are prehistoric
open campsites ranging in age from the Paleoindian period through the Historic period. Some of
these represent a single campfire where a very small group of Native Americans may have camped
for one night. Others are very large, covering very extensive areas representing large groups of
people that stayed for long periods, perhaps seasonally, with ancestral groups returning to these
same campsites over a period of several thousands of years. Cultural remains to be found at these
large campsites include among other items, an abundance of fire-cracked rocks representing
multiple hearths, a wide variety of chipped stone tools and the lithic debris that results from making
them, ground and smoothed stones used to grind nuts and seeds, faunal remains from terrestrial and
aquatic animals consumed, bone tools, pottery sherds, and mussel and snail shells. Open campsites
occur in all types of environments, whether that be in a plush riverine environment that offered a
wide variety banquet of plant and animal foodstuffs, or in the uplands away from flowing water
sources. Seasonally, the upland grasses, shrubs, cacti offered a different food source that could be
exploited such as various grass seeds, mesquite beans, prickly pear pads and tunas, and agave
hearts. In addition, at various times, bison were known to graze on the northern South Texas Plains,
and were highly sought after for use as food, hides, and bone tools (Dillehay 1974).

26

Depending upon the integrity of these open campsites, archaeologists and the Texas Historical
Commission consider these as perhaps the most significant types of sites in regard to their ability
to contribute to our understanding of south Texas prehistory. A few of the desired ingredients that
can indicate significance include cultural material that is buried beneath the surface in a wellpreserved, stratified, and relatively undisturbed context. Although these situations most frequently
occur within stratified terrace deposits adjacent to streams, they can also occur in upland settings
where the landscape has been generally stable through time. Other ingredients that archaeologists
look for in potentially significant campsites include good organic preservation in the form of
charcoal and/or charred plant remains, faunal preservation, temporally diagnostic stone tools or
ceramics, and intact features such as hearths.
Prehistoric Lithic Scatters or Procurement Sites
Lithic scatters are the next most common type of archaeological site that can be expected along the
Colorado City Mainline. These sites simply represent the chipped stone debris and broken tools that
were left behind when Native Americans made new tools or re-sharpened their old ones. The
general absence of fire-cracked rocks and other cultural material normally found at open campsites
suggest that they did not camp there, or remain there for any extended period of time (However,
small camp fires may have been used to heat-treat chert or quartzite cobbles to make them more
knappable). Yet, they were drawn to these isolated locales because of the natural outcroppings or
surface exposures of good quality raw material such as chert or quartzite cobbles. Examples of
chipped stone most commonly found at these sites include cobbles with one or two flakes removed,
called ‘tested cobbles’. That is, the Native Americans knew from experience the quality of stone
that could most easily be flaked and reduced for stone tool production, so they ‘tested’ the cobble
to judge whether it was useable or not. If the quality was judged to be inferior, then the cobble was
tossed aside. That is why the majority of tested cobbles found on these sites are of poor quality,
coarse-grained material. While the finished stone tool products are carried away from these sites,
what remains are those tools broken during the manufacturing process, and the thousands of pieces
of debitage in the form of flakes and angular debris. Also unique to lithic scatters where large
cobbles are present are snapped ‘quarry blanks’. These are simply cobbles flakes on both sides,
reducing the cobble into a transportable ‘blank’ that can be used to further reduce it and make
finished stone tools from the flakes taken off of it. The unbroken quarry blanks are usually not
found on these sites because they have been carried off, presumably to areas of south Texas where
raw material is not readily available. The snapped or broken quarry blanks are of little or no use,
so they are discarded and left behind.
Lithic scatters range in age from the Paleoindian through the Historic periods and can be found on
any landscape setting where gravels or cobbles have been exposed. Notably, gravel outcrops that
were exposed to the surface a few hundred or thousand years ago could be deeply buried today,
and the opposite could also be true; it all depends on the terrain setting and lithic scatters in the
three-county area have been documented along upper stream terraces abutting the eroded upland
slopes.
Prehistoric Quarries
Prehistoric quarries can also range in age from the Paleoindian through Historic periods, but differ
from lithic scatters in that at those sites Native Americans exploited loose gravels, but at times they
27

specifically sought quarry sites where raw material such as cherts or quartzites were not yet freed
from their parent geologic formation, and they had to be ‘quarried’. These types of sites are rare
in Texas for two reasons: 1) the geological exposures generally do not present themselves, and 2)
throughout Texas, even in central Texas, it is much easier to pick up gravels from the surface than
to try to mine them from hard rock. Quarried and chipped stone remains likely to be found at these
sites include large chunks of angular cherts or quartzites, as well as parent material detritus, and
flaking debris. Snapped quarry blanks can also be expected. Although a handful of prehistoric
quarry sites have been recorded in this area of Texas, they are rare.
Prehistoric Burned Rock Middens
Burned rock middens result from a series of multiple-use earth ovens that were constructed much
like modern-day roasting pits are dug into the earth for roasting a pig. With repetitive uses, as the
larger rocks that serve as heating elements in the earthen pit fracture and thus become less effective
as a thermal source, they are ‘pitched out’ around the edge of the pit. As the pit becomes unusable,
another is dug near by, and the procedure repeated. Over time, these multiple pits and the ‘pitched
out’ fire-cracked rocks coalesce together, obscuring each pit as indiscernible. (For a full discussion
of the formation of burned rock middens and their documented presence in Texas, see Leach and
Bousman 2001; Leach et al. 2001; Mauldin et al. 2003).
Prehistoric Burial and Cemetery Sites
Although not common, isolated prehistoric burials and cemeteries have been documented in this
area of Texas. Individual and isolated burials have been found in association with open campsites
in both upland settings as well as in alluvial terraces along streams.
Historic Sites
Although Spanish ranchers had established large ranches in northern Mexico by the mid-16th
century, and Spanish entradas began penetrating south Texas in the 1700s and 1800s, there is no
record of any sort of permanent structures in the area during those periods (Chipman 1992), the
Colorado City area was generally not considered safe for settlement by whites until after the Civil
War in 1865, and white settlers then began establishing smaller ranches and farmlands.
Because of the vastness of the landscape and the relatively late settlement and development of this
area of Texas compared to east and central Texas and northern Mexico, historic sites are not
abundant, but they certainly do exist. The most common types to be encountered are related to
ranching and farming endeavors, or small communities from the 19th and 20th centuries. Site types
most commonly include farmsteads or ranches with corrals, cisterns, chimney and foundation
remains from both main houses and outbuildings, related trash dumps, an occasional family burial
or cemetery, school houses, churches, community buildings, and industry-related structures or
construction projects.

Howard County History
Situated on the eastern edge of the Permian Basin, the southern edge of the Caprock, and the
western edge of the Edwards Plateau, Howard County was uniquely situated for nomadic
prehistoric Native Americans, early explorers, and later Spanish and Anglo-American settlers. Most
attractive in both prehistoric and historic times was the spring at Big Spring on Sulphur Draw, near
the modern-day city appropriately named Big Spring. Within a generally arid landscape, the
naturally flowing spring attracted coyotes, wolves, and herds of buffalo, antelope, and mustangs.
As such the spring also attracted humans for millennia. The earliest written historic accounts
indicate that both the Comanche and the Shawnee camped at the spring, and fought for the right
to do so (Hazelwood and Ordintz 1996).
Strategically located along the Overland Trail to California, when Captain Randolph Marcy
mapped the trail in 1849, he designated the Signal Mountain Peak area as a recommended campsite.
The Signal Mountains lie roughly nine miles southeast of Big Spring (Tyler 1996). Signal
Mountain, ten miles southeast of Big Spring, was a landmark used by early cattlemen. “In 1849
Capt. Randolph B. Marcy's expedition reached Big Spring on the return trip from Santa Fe and
marked it as a campsite on the Overland Trail to California. The spring was also a campsite on the
Santa Fe Trail from Fort Smith, Arkansas, to El Paso. Early ranchers, among them Adolph Miller
and C. C. Slaughter, reached the area in the late 1870s, and after the ranchers came four-section
plots with squatters' dugouts. In the late 1870s the community of Big Spring began near the spring
as a settlement of hide huts and saloons for buffalo hunters. In 1880 the Texas and Pacific built
through the area, following the line of Sulphur Draw several miles north of the spring. The
community moved to the tracks, and Big Spring became the site of railroad shops and a station.
When Howard County was organized in 1882, Big Spring became the county seat. That same year
a post office started operating in the community, and its first general store opened. By 1884 Big
Spring had an estimated population of 1,200, six saloons, four general stores, and a weekly
newspaper (the Pantagraph). Several private schools were operating in the community by 1890, and
the town had a public school by 1898" (Hazelwood and Ordintz 1996:537-538).
A series of droughts and other factors in the early 1900s forced the large ranches to either
significantly downsize or sell out altogether. However, a boon to the economy of Howard County
came in the 1920s in the form of an oil boom, and the population increased three-fold. The number
of farms also increased, and although the Great Depression forced many out of business, the oil and
gas business remained a mainstay, just as it is today (Long 1996).

Mitchell County History
Artifacts discovered in the area that is now Mitchell County indicate that it was occupied at least
periodically for perhaps the past 3,000 years or longer. However, confirmed historic accounts of
Native Americans and Anglos go only as far back as about A.D. 1780. At that time, the Penateka
Comanche controlled the area, both as a hunting ground and semi-permanent settlement. Although
29

other bands from other tribes likely passed through and hunted in the area during the late 1780s
through most of the 1800s, the Comanches were basically the domineering warlike presence during
that period, and the region was off limits to white settlement (Amin and Leffler 1996). It was not
until 1875 that the backs of the renegade Comanches, Apaches, and Kiowas were broken in pitched
battles with the U.S. army under command of Lieutenant Colonel Ranald Mackenzie that
culminated in the Red River War. Even following the defeat and subsequent movement of the
majority of the renegades to the Fort Sill reservation, several bands continued to move throughout
northern Texas. However, within a few years’ time all but a few had surrendered and straggled into
the reservation (Wallace 1993).
Although a few white settlers such as buffalo hunters had dared venture into the area in the early
1870s, soon after the Comanches and other marauding bands were defeated by Mackenzie, white
settlers more freely penetrated the area that is now Mitchell County. In 1876, Mitchell County was
created from a portion of Bexar County, with Colorado City designated the county seat when the
county was officially organized in 1881. With the arrival of the Texas and Pacific Railroad in 1881,
Colorado City immediately blossomed both in population and economically. Shipping of cattle via
the railroad from Colorado City at the time equaled both Dodge City and Abilene. Within three
years, Colorado City boasted a population of about 3,000, along with several new saloons and beer
parlors, numerous general stores, as well as lawyers and doctors to accommodate the boom (Amin
and Leffler 1996).
As with Howard County to the west, the general area of Mitchell County suffered from major
droughts. To wit, in 1886, the farmers and ranchers endured a severe drought, followed by one of
the worst winters ever recorded. As a result, ranchers lost large numbers of cattle, and farmers were
hit extremely hard. The year 1886 was only the beginning of many successive years when farmers
and ranchers were forced to either sell or cease operations because of the weather. Fighting back
from the drought conditions, and with a gradual change in climatic conditions, farmers found that
in the 1920s and 1930s cotton would become a cash crop despite the Great Depression. As with
Howard County to the west, the discovery of oil and gas in the county in 1920 stabilized the
county’s economic situation during the 1930s. Today, cotton and sorghum continue to be a
mainstay of the county’s economic production (Amin and Leffler 1996). However, with the
modern-day techniques of producing oil and gas, the economy and population of Mitchell County
is once again booming.

Scurry County History
Situated at the base of the Llano Estacados’ southeastern edge, the area that is now Scurry County
has undoubtedly been either passed through or temporarily occupied by prehistoric Native
Americans over the perhaps 3,000 years, but more than likely for many millenia before then.
However, other then archaeological discoveries, the only reliable descriptions are those found in
recorded history. That said, early Anglo-Americans explorers and settlers to the area documented
Apaches living and hunting in the area in the early 1700s. Following that, the feared Comanches
frequented the area, with an oft-traveled Comanche war trail crossing the county. As with Howard
County, Army Engineers mapped a portion of the California Road through Scurry County in 1849.
30

Following U. S. Army Lieutenant Colonel Ranald Mackenzie’s rout of the Comanches and related
bands from the area in 1874-1875, buffalo hunters and ranchers rapidly infiltrated the area,
resulting in a small settlement consisting of dugouts and tents called Snyder’s place. By 1877, the
first large ranch was entrenched along the Clear Fork of the Brazos, and the ranching industry in
modern-day Scurry County was begun (Leffler 1996).
In 1876, Scurry County was established from lands that were once a portion of Bexar County, and
the county was then officially organized in 1884. Snyder, a trading post and later townsite in 1884,
became the county seat that same year. Following county organization, the number of farms and
ranches increased rapidly. Although ranching dominated the county’s economy in the late 1800s,
farming was taking a foothold. A unique aspect of land disputes took place primarily in Scurry
County in the late 1800s; this was known as the “Block 97 Controversy”. Before 1899, roughly
612,000 acres of land had been granted by the State of Texas to the Texas and Pacific Railway
(T&PR) Company in return for development of a railroad through the area. The T&PR in turn sold
thousands of acres to settlers. However, shortly thereafter the T&PR was forced to file for
bankruptcy, leaving the land titles to settlers in limbo. Finally, in 1899 the state legislature settled
the dispute by reverting all lands previously granted to the T&PR back to the state. The state then
allowed ranchers and homesteaders to purchase the lands. Although not a preferred outcome to
established ranchers and homesteaders alike, the controversy was settled (Leffler 1996).
Although cattle ranching dominated the economy in the late 1800s, by 1900, cotton production was
the mainstay of farming activities. A boon to Scurry County’s economy came with the construction
of the Roscoe, Snyder and Pacific Railway, and then the Santa Fe Railroad into Snyder in 1908 and
1911, respectively. Although the population of Scurry County declined consumate with an
economic downturn in the county prior to 1910, the production of cotton as a cash crop continued
to thrive. In 1923, oil in abundance was discovered in the county, and the county’s economy as well
as population took off. Although the Great Depression significantly depleted the county’s
economical base, farming and ranching were sustained until the 1940s when the discovery of new
and deeper oil fields once again created an economic boom. As with most of Texas, Scurry County
was ravaged by a record drought in the 1950s, but managed to survive (Leffler 1996). Once again,
in the early portion of the 21st century, new technology has pushed the production of oil and gas
to the forefront.

Archaeological Atlas Site Results
We preface this section by stating that although it presents the number of sites and their types
documented within Howard, Mitchell, and Scurry County, the results simply provide the data that
is available. In reality, the number of documented sites and their types are very heavily skewed
based upon the types of cultural resource surveys, and the limited areas of those surveys. To wit,
a review of the Texas Atlas indicated that there were only three known archaeological sites within
one mile of the Project Area. That said, the data that is available on the Texas Atlas is only as good
as the surveys represent. The vast majority of Howard, Mitchell, and Scurry County has never been
31

subjected to formal cultural resource surveys, so it is conceded that the true character of the
archaeological record is very poorly understood. Nevertheless, the few surveys that have been
accomplished provide at least some aspect of what the area looks like from an archaeological
perspective.
Howard County
As of September 20, 2014 there were 120 archaeological sites recorded within Howard County.
Evidence of ancient hearths, along with diagnostic projectile points indicate that 59 of these sites
had been used as open campsites from as early as the Paleoindian period, and through as late as the
Late Prehistoric periods (see Figure 6). Thirty-two of the 120 sites have been classified as lithic
scatters, where an abundance of chipped stone with more than a few temporal diagnostics also
indicate these sites were being used from the Paleoindian through Late Prehistoric periods. At 13
of the sites, the chert, quartzite, and other cobbles/gravels that were exposed to the surface have
been tested and used to manufacture stone tools over several thousand years. Other prehistoric sites
within Howard County include two documented rock shelters, two areas where bison bones were
eroding from cutbanks, and two locales with mammoth bones, one of which had Paleoindian dart
points in association. Historically, a total of 12 components have been recorded. These include
1880s through 1950s farmsteads, house sites, and trash dumps/scatters, and a Civilian Conservation
Camp from the 1930s. The only documented State Archaeological Landmark (SAL) in Howard
County is the Patton-Hayden House in Big Spring (Atlas 2014).
Mitchell County
The earliest professional archaeological surveys conducted in Mitchell were those by legendary
archaeologist E. B. Sayles, in the 1930s. Even with his concerted effort, since that time, only 99
archaeological sites have been recorded within all of Mitchell County. I n our opinion, this
minuscule number is a true reflection on the few archaeological surveys that have been conducted
in the county, and not at all a true representation of the number of archaeological sites that actually
exist. That said, a review of the Texas Atlas indicates that forty of these sites had been used as open
campsites from as early as the Paleoindian period, and through as late as the Late Prehistoric
periods. Mortar holes representing intensive food grinding were documented at three of the
campsites, and carved petroglyphs were found at one. Forty-four sites have been classified as
prehistoric lithic scatters. Other prehistoric sites within Mitchell County include a cutbank with
exposed bison bones, a bison killsite with associated Paleoindian points, and a crevice burial.
Seventeen historic components have been recorded in the county, including the 1880s Seven Wells
Settlement, a half-dugout and well, a series of early cattle brands etched into bedrock, WWII
bombing practice targets, multiple 1900s farmsteads and trash dumps, hand-dug wells, and a 1900s
quarry operation. The three State Archaeological Landmarks (SAL) in Mitchell County include
two prehistoric open campsites along Morgan Creek, and one prehistoric open campsite along Lone
Wolf Creek (Atlas 2014).
Scurry County
A total of 68 archaeological sites had been recorded in Scurry County as of September 20, 2014.
Twenty-two of those are prehistoric open campsites, 15 are prehistoric lithic scatters, two are
prehistoric procurement sites, two are prehistoric burned rock middens, one is a small rock ring that
could represent a one-person sweat lodge or a hunting blind, one is a painted pictograph site, and
32

two are prehistoric human burial sites. The 23 historic components documented in Scurry County
include an 1890s cemetery, the Panhandle & Santa Fe Railroad trestle, the Roscoe, Snyder &
Pacific Railroad grade, and numerous 1900s farmsteads, ranch houses, and trash dumps. The only
documented State Archaeological Landmark in the county is the 80 square-foot Hermleigh
Calaboose constructed in 1913 (Atlas 2014).
Previously Documented Archaeological Sites and Surveys
As shown in Figure 3, a review of the Texas Atlas indicated that there had been one professional
archaeological survey conducted within one mile of the western-most segment of the Colorado City
Mainline. In 1993, Mariah and Associates archaeologists surveyed the Cap Rock South-East
Transmission Line for the Caprock Electrical Cooperative and documented sites 41HW60 and
41HW61.
41HW60 is described as a prehistoric open campsite of an unknown age, and situated in an upland
ridge area south of an intermittent playa. Artifacts observed at the time consisted of chipped stone
chert flakes, a ground stone mano, a quartzite hammerstone, and burned caliche. As it was mapped
at the time, the western periphery of 41HW60 lies along the edge of the proposed Colorado City
Mainline 500-foot right-of-way.
41HW61 is a prehistoric open campsite located in an upland area near a playa basin. No temporal
diagnostics were observed that could define a period of occupation. An ephemeral scatter of
chipped stone and groundstone fragments were observed on the surface.
As shown in Figures 4 and 5, the Colorado City Mainline will parallel a portion of the Cap Rock
Electric Cooperative Transmission Line that was surveyed in 1993 by Mariah and Associates
archaeologists. However, the bulk of this segment has never been subjected to a cultural resources
survey.
As shown in Figure 5, there is one known archaeological site within one mile of Segment 3 of the
proposed Colorado City Mainline; 41HW62. This site consists of a prehistoric lithic scatter of an
undetermined age, located on a prominent ridge. Artifacts observed in 1993 included one core, two
bifaces, an endscraper, several retouched flakes, and otherwise unmodified stone debitage.

Background Review Summary
Previous Surveys and Sites
As discussed in the previous sections above, although only three archaeological sites have been
documented in close proximity to the proposed Colorado City Mainline, the few number of sites
recorded is moreso a direct reflection of the very few professional surveyed that have been
conducted in Howard, Mitchell, and Scurry counties than the large number of sites that have
actually extant.

33

Notably, the Colorado City Mainline along Segment 1 (Figure 3) will not only traverse areas of
upland playas, but will also cross Sandy Creek and Coahoma Draw drainages. Although in modern
times these drainages are most probably intermittently flowing and dependent upon sparse rainfall,
they were most likely spring-fed at various periods in prehistory, and thus would have been a
magnet for prehistoric settlement.
As shown in Figure 4, Segment 2 of the pipeline will cross over several now-intermittent drainages
that were possibly flowing in prehistory. The numerous caprock vantage points and valleys suggest
a moderate to high probability that archaeological sites of potential significance are extant.
Also, as shown in Figure 5, the Colorado City Mainline will cross Morgan Creek and Hasting
Creek, and generally paralleling Hasting Creek for a considerable distance. These areas should be
considered as offering a high potential for archaeological sites to be present.
As shown in Figure 6, there are no documented archaeological sites in close proximity to the
proposed Colorado City Mainline. However, the right-of-way crosses the Hasting Creek North
Branch, the upper reaches of Grass Creek, and numerous other intermittent tributaries. As such, the
potential for buried and significant prehistoric archaeological sites to exist is unknown.
In addition, the pipeline as planned will be constructed through the old community of Cuthbert,
where there is a distinct possibility of impacting potentially historically significant sites. The
Cuthbert community was started in 1890 when a school teacher, D. T. Bozeman, constructed a
wagonyard and store. A post office was established in 1891, and a school in 1893. By the 1920s,
the town boasted of two stores, a church, a blacksmith shop, a gin, a school, and a telephone office.
However, the community met its demise shortly after WWII when rural roads that favored
Colorado City circumvented the community. By 1974, only the Cuthbert Cemetery and scattered
farmsteads were still present (Davis 1996).
There are no documented archaeological sites in close proximity to Segment 5 of the proposed
Colorado City Mainline right-of-way. However, the right-of-way traverses several upper reaches
of first order tributaries of the Colorado River, and as shown in Figure 7, will impact the upper and
lower terraces of the Colorado River. Previous cultural resources surveys in similar locales have
demonstrated that highly significant cultural resource deposits are still extant in the Colorado River
terraces and its tributaries.
Although there are no documented archaeological sites along Segment 6 of the proposed Colorado
City Mainline (Figure 8), the potential for deeply buried and potentially significant archaeological
sites is assessed as moderate to high in relation to Little Sulphur Creek, as well as the other nowintermittent drainages along this segment.
Summary
From this preliminary cultural resources background review, it is clear that the proposed Colorado
City Mainline right-of-way in all probability, will encounter previously undocumented
archaeological sites. This is best manifested by the scant few professional surveys that have been
conducted in Howard, Mitchell, and Scurry counties, but though few in numbers, these surveys
34

have documented a high ubiquity of sites per linear mile or area surveyed. Some of the sites that
are likely to be encountered along the Colorado City Mainline right-of-way may be heavily
disturbed and/or redundant site types, and as such have little to contribute to the prehistory of south
Texas. These sites should be considered as non-significant, and should not impede the pipeline’s
construction as planned. However, it is also clear from this review that there is a moderate to high
probability that archaeological sites of significance lie in the planned right-of-way.
Although the number of sites in this area of Texas, and their potential significance can be modeled,
because of the scant few professional surveys that have been conducted in these areas to date under
less stringent standards, such models are considered unreliable. Accordingly, without an on-theground archaeological survey, the ubiquity of archaeological sites and their scientific research
potential along the Colorado City Mainline will remain an unknown.
In sum, it appears that the pipeline is to be routed through areas that may be sensitive to
archaeological deposits. To be sure of our desktop assessment, Tierras Antiguas recommended that
a full pedestrian survey, with shovel testing in moderate and high probability areas, be conducted
along the Colorado City Mainline right-of-way.

Project Goals and Methods
Goals
The project goals focused on archaeological issues that could be addressed by the types of data
obtained through pedestrian survey, along with limited shovel testing. The topics addressed were
site type, distribution, density, size, depth, and stratigraphy. The prehistoric theoretical framework
is structured around patterns of settlement, mobility, subsistence, and social systems for the regions.
The historic framework is structured around the 1800s and 1900s settlement in the area as
documented in the earliest written accounts by Spanish priests, government representatives, and
early Anglo-American settlers, through the Mexican and Republic of Texas sovereignty periods,
and into the Texas Statehood period.
The goals of the project were to:
1)

locate and record cultural locations and sites in the project area using a systematic
survey methodology;

2)

quantify site size, as well as depth, and stratigraphy; and,

3)

place any diagnostic artifacts within the regional time frame.

35

Methods and Levels of Effort
In accordance with Texas Historical Commission (THC) and Council of Texas Archeologists
(CTA) Archaeology Survey Standards, a systematic, and thorough pedestrian survey of the linear
right-of-way was conducted. Four archaeologists meandered back and forth across the 24-meter
(80-foot) wide right-of-way to ensure more complete coverage.
Approximately 22.9 miles (57 percent) of the the western and central portions of the 40.2-mile
right-of-way courses through recently cultivated fields where surface visibility was greater than 95
percent (see for example, Figures 24 and 25). In these areas a full pedestrian survey was conducted,
but no shovel tests were excavated. Otherwise, the remaining, roughly 17.3 miles of pipeline is to
be constructed through typical mesquite and cactus area where surface visibility ranged from 30
percent to greater than 70 percent. Rare exceptions occurred in close proximity to streams. In those
cases, shovel tests were excavated at the discretion of the Principal Investigator/Project
Archaeologist, dependent upon the terrain and the estimated potential for buried and intact cultural
resources to exist (Figures 26 and 27). A total of 18 shovel tests were placed in areas deemed to be
of moderate and high probability for buried and intact archaeological deposits to exist (Figures 28
and 29). In addition, all cutbanks, and rodent and mammal backdirt piles along the right-of-way
were thoroughly examined.
In accordance with a general “no collection” policy, cultural material of a redundant nature, both
prehistoric and historic, were not to be collected. Instead, they were to be fully documented via
sketches, field photographs, and copious notes. Exceptions were to be made for diagnostic artifacts,
particularly those artifacts which could be considered as significant to the interpretation of Texas
prehistory, such as Early Archaic-Paleoindian transitional, or Paleoindian diagnostics. These were
to be collected on a case-by-case basis, and that decision was left up to the Principal Investigator
and/or the Project Archaeologist. Historic buildings, trash scatters, or other historic occurrences
adjacent to the ROW were to be documented with photographs and included in this report of
investigations.
All shovel tests were dug in 20-centimeter (cm) levels, and all sediments were screened through
1/4-inch wire mesh. Following our designed research plan, any artifacts recovered from shovel tests
were not to be collected, but were to be placed in the upper 20 cm of the backfilled shovel test. The
results of shovel testing were fully documented on Shovel Test forms that are on file at TAAI, and
are available upon request.
The eight archaeological site discovered were mapped using a pace-and-compass method, as well
as a GPS. Field notes were made about the sites and a sketch maps were drawn. Digital photographs
of the sites and selected artifacts were taken, as well as selected photographs representing the
surveyed right-of-way in general, and a photo log was maintained.

Results of the Investigations

Typically, fine sandy loam and clay loam soils with fragmented caliche were encountered in the
western and central portions of the ROW, while shallower fine sands and fine sandy loams were
present along eastern portion. Three prehistoric sites (41MH62, 41HW130-131, ), five historic sites
(41MH101-105), and two isolated prehistoric finds were documented during the survey. Their
locations are shown in Figure 30, and they are described below.

scrapers (Figure 33), and perhaps a dozen primary flakes. All were made from tan to light brown,

Site Summary, Conclusions, and Recommendations
This appears to have been a relatively small, and short-term occupation site where Native
Americans exploited a sparse scatter of chert gravels and deflated slope to fashion side and end
scrapers for transport elsewhere. Without the discovery of diagnostics, the period (or periods) of
occupation remains an unknown. In its current eroded and deflated condition, other than its
positioning on the landscape, we assess the site as possessing minimal research potential.I n view
of this, Tierras Antiguas recommends that construction of the Colorado City Mainline as planned
be allowed to proceed through the site, with no further investigations.

piles revealed no
evidence of buried cultural materials. Artifacts observed included an Edgewood dart point, a sparse
scatter of both primary and secondary chert flakes, and widely dispersed small (golf ball size)
limestone fire-cracked rocks. The dart point and flakes were from multi-colored, fine-grained, nonheat treated chert (see for example, Figure 36). The Edgewood dart point exhibited an impact
fracture on its distal tip, and a probable post-depositional fracture on its right stem. The Edgewood
point is diagnostic to the latter portion of the Late Archaic or the Transitional Archaic in Texas,
roughly 1,000 to 1,200 years ago (Hofman 1989; Turner et al. 2011).
Site Summary, Conclusions, and Recommendations
This site appears to have been a relatively small open campsite tethered to a drainage that although
is now intermittently flowing, was likely spring-fed and flowing at various periods in prehistory.
The discovery of an Edgewood dart point on the surface suggests that the site was occupied at least
one time during the latter part of the Late Archaic, or Transitional Archaic.
In its current eroded and deflated condition, other than its positioning on the landscape, we assess
the site as possessing minimal research potential. As such, Tierras Antiguas recommends that
construction of the Colorado City Mainline as planned be allowed to proceed through the site, with
no further archaeological investigations.

flaked scrapers, and perhaps a dozen primary and secondary chert flakes (see Figures 39 and 40).

47

Site Summary, Conclusions, and Recommendations
This site appears to have been a possibly intensively used campsite where ground stones were used
to grind seeds, and stone tools were manufactured for hunting, and subsequently utilized for
processing upland game animals. It is located a short distance from a drainage that although in
modern times is only intermittently flowing, was likely spring-fed and flowing at various periods
in prehistory. However, without the discovery of temporal diagnostics, the period or periods during
which this site was occupied can only be surmised as most probably Late Prehistoric. In its current
disturbed and apparent palimpsest condition, other than its positioning on the landscape, we assess
the site as possessing minimal research potential. As such, Tierras Antiguas recommends that
construction of the Colorado City Mainline as planned be allowed to proceed through the site, with

conducted, and
small animal backdirt piles were examined. The artifacts were predominantly within and
immediately adjacent to a machine push pile in the center of the site (see Figures 44 and 45).
Otherwise, artifacts were dispersed around the push pile covering an area of roughly 2,000 square

meters. Artifacts observed were a rusted metal pipe wrench, other unidentifiable metal fragments,
Bristol glazed stoneware sherds, clear bottle glass sherds, red terra cotta flower pottery sherds, and
vitrified pipe fragments. At Figure 46 is a photo of selected artifacts.
Site Summary, Conclusions, and Recommendations
This site consists of artifacts from the 1930s, concurrent with the time period during which the
surrounding old oilfield was being developed in this area of Mitchell County. An existing old
buried pipeline courses some 20 meters east of the site, and it appears that trash left over from
developing that pipeline and numerous pump jacks in the area was dumped and then bulldozed into
a push pile. In our assessment, the site is a heavily disturbed surficial scatter, and otherwise has
shallow and eroded soils. In view of this, Tierras Antiguas recommends that construction of the
Colorado City Mainline as currently planned be allowed to proceed through the site, with no further
archaeological investigations.

Site Summary, Conclusions, and Recommendations
A lone structure appears at this location on a 1950 USGS topographic map of the Cedar Bend area
(Map 2014). The absence of household artifacts suggests that it was not occupied as a home.
Whereas, although the few pieces of clear glass jar sherds, iron water pipe, and 5-gallon metal can
suggest that the building was perhaps used as a storage area for agricultural products in the 1930s
through 1950s, the large concrete porch across the front suggests perhaps a storefront. No evidence
of burning was observed, nor were any construction materials such as tin or lumber, suggesting that
the structural material was dismantled and moved elsewhere. Although additional archival research
is recommended in order to determine the use of this structure, this should not impede construction
of the Colorado City Mainline. Therefore, Tierras Antiguas recommends that construction of the
Colorado City Mainline as currently planned be allowed to proceed through the site, with no further
archaeological investigations.

Levels of Effort and Results
A thorough examination of the heavily disturbed surface was conducted, and small animal backdirt

common in the 1950s. It is probably related to the farmstead (41MH105) located upslope some 130
meters to the northeast, on the same property. In our assessment, the site is a heavily disturbed
surficial scatter with no integrity, and minimal research potential at best. In view of this, Tierras
Antiguas recommends that construction of the Colorado City Mainline as currently planned be
allowed to proceed through the site, with no further archaeological investigations.

Bristol glaze/Albany slip stoneware sherds (ca. 1920-1950 [Greer 1981]), purple and aqua bottle
glass sherds, and crudely manufactured red brick fragments. The only whiteware sherd with an
identifiable maker’s mark indicates that it was manufactured by the W. S. George Pottery Company
in Pennsylvania. More specifically, the mark was used by the company in the late 1930s and into
the 1940s (Lehner 1988:162-163).
Site Summary, Conclusions, and Recommendations
This site was occupied in the 1930s through the 1950s by the grandparents of the current
landowner, who stated that his grandparents were forced to abandon the house and farming during
the 1950s drought. According to the grandson, the house foundation was constructed of cut
sandstone, and there was a small barn located between the house and the stock tank to the southsoutheast. There was also a well powered by a windmill, but the well went dry. Subsequently, their
descendants bulldozed the house and pushed the debris into the pile that is now comprised of cut
sandstone foundation stones and artifacts. This seemed practical to once again return the immediate
area into farmland in the 1980s and 1990s.
Although interesting because of its location on the landscape as an abandoned farmstead in this
rural area of Mitchell County, in our assessment, the site is so heavily disturbed that it now
possesses minimal research potential at best. In view of this, Tierras Antiguas recommends that
construction of the Colorado City Mainline as currently planned be allowed to proceed through the
site, with no further archaeological investigations.

Isolated Find 1
Isolated Find 1 (Figure 56) consists of two core
reduction flakes discovered on a cultivated
surface adjacent to a cotton field (N3580899
E285668 [NAD83]), and on the edge of an upper
terrace overlooking the Wildhorse Creek
drainage to the east. The two flakes were
manufactured from off-white medium grained
chert and exhibited slight patina. A thorough
examination of the surrounding area revealed no
other evidence of cultural material.

Survey Summary, Conclusions, and Recommendations
Tierras Antiguas archaeologists conducted a thorough pedestrian survey and dug 18 shovel tests
during the period September 14 thru 25, resulting in the documentation of three prehistoric sites
(41MH62, 41HW130-131), five historic sites (41MH101-105), and two isolated prehistoric finds.
In all cases, Tierras Antiguas assessed the sites and isolated finds as possessing minimal research
potential.
Accordingly, Tierras Antiguas recommended that the project should be considered as having “no
effect” on any properties considered as eligible for nomination to the National Register of Historic
Places or inclusion in the State Archeological Landmarks Program, and as such, the project should
be allowed to proceed without further archaeological work. However, if any cultural resources are
encountered during construction, work should immediately be halted in the vicinity until such finds
are examined and evaluated by Tierras Antiguas, or by any qualified archaeological consultant, and
by the Texas Historical Commission.
No artifacts were collected and curated during this project.
