ABSTRACT
Archeological monitoring was undertaken for sewer line improvements that the San
Antonio Water System made at the AO42 location as part of the Multiple Sewershed Package 9
Project in San Antonio, Texas. These improvements were monitored to ensure they did not impact
important archeological resources, in accordance with a request by the City of San Antonio’s
Office of Historic Preservation. The horizontal area of potential effects is less than 0.1 acre.
The project area is immediately west of Salado Creek at Loop 410. Monitoring was done at the
locations of five ground-disturbing point repairs by one archeologist over a five-day period from
November 5 to 11, 2019. No archeological materials were observed in any of the five trenches,
and the repairs did not impact any Native American or historic archeological sites.

INTRODUCTION
Archeological monitoring was undertaken for sewer line improvements
that the San Antonio Water System made at the AO42 location as part of the
Multiple Sewershed Package 9 Project in San Antonio, Texas. The project area is
immediately west of Salado Creek at Loop 410 (Figure 1). Work at the AO42 location
consists of trenchless rehabilitation of about 120 ft of sewer line south of Loop 410
and 768 ft of sewer line north of Loop 410. Within this area, ground-disturbing
activities occurred only at five locations on the north side of Loop 410 where point
repairs were made to the existing sewer line (see Figure 1). The ground-disturbing
activities were monitored to ensure they did not impact important archeological
resources, in accordance with a request by the City of San Antonio’s Office of Historic
Preservation. The horizontal area of potential effects is less than 0.1 acre. The
vertical area of potential effects was 10–15 ft (3.0–4.5 m). All work done complied
with the requirements of the Antiquities Code of Texas (Texas Natural Resource
Code of 1977, Title 9, Chapter 191, VTCS 6145-9) and the City of San Antonio’s
Historic Preservation and Design Section of the Unified Development Code (Article
6 35-360-634).
ENVIRONMENTAL SETTING
The project is on the terrace edge adjacent to and west of the floodplain of
Salado Creek. The area is fully urbanized and partly paved over with parking lots
for adjacent office buildings and a church. The terrace slope and creek floodplain
have a short grass cover with scattered live oak, hackberry, and ligustrum trees.
In general, the project area is near the edge of the Balcones Escarpment
in central Bexar County near the boundary between the Blackland Prairie to the
southeast and the Edwards Plateau to the northwest (Arbingast et al. 1973:6;
Griffith et al. 2004; McMahan et al. 1984:Figure 1). In its natural state, this portion
of the Blackland Prairie is characterized by rolling to nearly level tall-grass plains
underlain by soft interbedded marls, chalks, limestones, and shales. The scarp
along the edge of the Edwards Plateau is a rugged dissected landscape of limestone
hills and canyons created by extensive stream downcutting and headward erosion.
According to the Geologic Atlas of Texas (Bureau of Economic Geology 1983), the
project area is mapped as Quaternary low terrace deposits. Soils are mapped as
Tinn and Frio soils, frequently flooded (Taylor et al. 1991). These are clayey alluvial
soils on floodplains.
RESULTS OF FILE SEARCH
Review of the Texas Historical Commission’s Archeological Sites Atlas in
December 2018 revealed at least 9 previous archeological investigations and 10
documented archeological sites within 1 km of the project area. Based on these data,
the current project area has a high potential for Native American sites, although any
sites in the existing sewer line corridor likely have already been disturbed. Nearby
previous investigations include the following: (1) a 2007 survey by the Center for
Archaeological Research of the University of Texas at San Antonio (CAR-UTSA) of

testing project at 41BX1764 about 0.7 km to the north, also associated with the
Salado Creek Greenway project (Figueroa 2009); (3) a 2014 survey by the Texas
Department of Transportation of part of the Interstate Highway 35 corridor, which

project area (Nichols 2014); (5) a 2013 survey by CAR-UTSA of the Laurens Lane

2013); (6) at least two episodes of excavation at the Granberg site on the east side of
Salado Creek at Loop 410 (Munoz et al. 2011; Schuetz 1966); and (7) two episodes
of excavation at the St. Mary’s Hall site east of Salado Creek and north of Loop 410
(Hester 1978).
The 10 recorded sites are 41BX17/271, 41BX229, 41BX473, 41BX474,
41BX477, 41BX1007, 41BX1764, 41BX1765, 41BX1766, and 41BX2041. Site
41BX17/271, the Granberg site, is about 350 m east of the south end of the current
project area, just across Salado Creek. Excavated partly in 1962 and tested again
in 2006, it is a stratified site with multiple Archaic period components and features
including human burials, a burned rock midden, and hearths (Munoz et al. 2011;
Schuetz 1966). Site 41BX229, the St. Mary’s Hall site, is 850 m north-northeast of
the project area, on the east side of Salado Creek. Excavations there in 1974–1975
and 1977 documented multiple Archaic and Late Prehistoric period components,
along with significant Paleoindian components (Hester 1978). Sites 41BX473 and
41BX474 are on the west bank of Salado Creek, 260 and 360 m southeast of the
project area. Both are thin scatters of lithic debris recorded in 1977 and considered
ineligible for National Register listing; when revisited in 2008, they were found to
be badly disturbed by erosion. Site 41BX477, 440 m east-southeast of the project
area on the east bank of Salado Creek, also was recorded in 1977 as a sparse lithic
scatter that was ineligible for National Register listing; when revisited in 2008, no
surface evidence of it was found. Site 41BX1007 is 310 m north-northwest of the
project on the west side of Salado Creek; it was recorded in 1994 as a possible midden
yielding artifacts diagnostic of the Late Prehistoric and Paleoindian periods. Site
41BX1764 is 650 m north of the project area, on the west side of Salado Creek. It was
recorded and tested in 2008 (Figueroa 2009); it was found to have Late Prehistoric
and earlier components that were considered ineligible for National Register listing.
Site 41BX1765 is 170 m east of the project area, just across Salado Creek; it was
recorded in 2008 when a dart point and another piece of chipped stone were found in
disturbed alluvial gravels on the floodplain. Site 41BX1766, 970 m north-northeast
of the project area on the floodplain just west of Salado Creek, consists of lithic
debris, burned rocks, and modern trash in disturbed contexts; it was recorded in
2008. Site 41BX2041 is 330 m southeast of the project area on the east edge of the
Salado Creek channel; it was recorded in 2012 as possible wagon ruts worn into
bedrock along the creek and a possible petroglyh on a limestone boulder.
In addition to review of the Archeological Sites Atlas, the potential for historic
archeological sites was assessed using maps obtained from the Texas Department
of Transportation’s Texas Historic Overlay and historic aerial photographs. A 1952

4

aerial photograph and USGS and U.S. Army Corps of Engineers maps dating to
1953 and 1938 indicate the project area was still mostly undeveloped, with the only
improvements being a cluster of buildings probably representing a farm complex
at the south end. Hence, the area has a low probability for containing historic
archeological sites.
WORK ACCOMPLISHED
Monitoring was carried out by one archeologist over five days between
November 5 and 11, 2019, during which five trenches were excavated to complete
the sewer repairs. These trenches were numbered 1 to 5 from north to south for notetaking purposes. The trenches averaged 4 m long by 1.5 m wide, or large enough to
expose the broken pipe and get a shoring box into the excavation. Trench depth was
10–15 ft (3.0–4.5 m) stopping at the existing sewer pipe. The archeologist, present
when these excavations were under way, inspected excavated sediment and examined
trench walls for evidence of archeological remains. Trench wall stratigraphy and
trench locations were documented with photographs and written notes.
RESULTS OF FIELD INVESTIGATIONS
No archeological materials were observed in any of the five trenches. The
stratigraphy encountered showed a number of fill zones associated with land leveling,
parking lot construction, fence installation, and other buried utility lines. These fill
zones impacted the upper 0.5–1.5 m within the trenches, and the original sewer line
trench extended this disturbance into the underlying limestone bedrock.
Trenches 1 and 2, the northernmost excavations, were at the edge of the
parking lot on the terrace slope above Salado Creek (Figure 2). Both trenches
showed 0.3 m of light orange sandy gravel below the parking lot asphalt and above
ca. 0.3 m of dark gray clay. Neither of these upper zones were cut by the original
sewer line trench suggesting that they were added after the original sewer line was
in place. Below these parking lot fill zones is loose limestone fill likely associated
with the original sewer trench (Figure 3). Trench 2 had the addition of a concrete
skirt capping the terrace edge likely for erosion control.
Trenches 3 and 4 were in the parking lot between the MacArthur Park
Church of Christ and the Greenspoint office complex. Both trenches were dug through
the asphalt on the flat area away from the terrace edge (Figure 4). These trenches
showed multiple fill zones associated with parking lot construction above a zone of
dark gray clay similar to that seen in the Trenches 1 and 2. Loose limestone gravel fill
extended below these parking lot fill zones down to the original pipeline (Figure 5).
In Trench 5, the southernmost trench, the fill zones encountered were
different than those seen elsewhere, but still the fill zones present indicate extensive
disturbance, and no archeological material was present. The trench was on a grasscovered island likely built up to hold the Greenspoint sign at the entrance to the
complex (Figure 6). Here, the upper 1 m was a light orange gravelly clay that had
a thin layer of topsoil on it to support the grass cover. The island also had a fiber
optic cable placed through it as well as a conduit for a 14-inch gas line, both of

which crossed the original sewer line. The lower strata consisted of orange clay
with small gravel. Just above the sewer line, the base of an abandoned manhole was
encountered, which had to be removed by jackhammer before the repairs could be
made to the sewer line. No limestone fill was present in this trench.

RESULTS AND DETERMINATIONS
Although the AO42 location of the Multiple Sewershed Package 9 Project
is in a setting that has a high potential for Native American sites, no archeological
materials were identified in the five trenches excavated for point repairs. Extensive
disturbance from the original sewer line, other buried utilities, and parking lot
construction was found within all the trenches. These disturbances preclude the
possibility of intact archeological deposits. As a result, the sewer line improvements
did not impact any Native American or historic archeological sites.
