A NEW SPECIES OF CAPROMERYX FROM THE
PLEISTOCENE OF WEST TEXAS
BY GRAYSON E. MEADE

INTRODUCTION
During the past few months an intensive search has been made for
Pleistocene vertebrates with which it would be reasonable to expect
to find associated artifacts. In cooperation with the Departtnent of
Geology and the West Texas Museum, exploratory work has been
carried on in eastern New Mexico and a number of counties in
western Texas. In the course of this work a new Pleistocene vertebrate fossil quarry was discovered in Lubbock County.
The site is a former Pleistocene lake basin which was drained and
subsequently dissected by the headward erosion of Yellowhouse
Canyon, a tributary of the Brazos River. The quarry has been
worked intermittently for several weeks whenever the weather permitred. The prospects are excellent for obtaining a fine Pleistocene mammalian as~mblage from this locality. The material discussed in the following pages is from this quarry and was found in
association with Parelephas, Equus, Camelops and as yet unidentified carnivora and rodents.
The genus Capromeryx was described by Matthew (1902) frmn
the Pleistocene deposits in Sheridan County, Nebraska. Frick (!937)
figured two horn-cores of Capromeryx collected at the type locality
which serve to substantiate the association of dentition with horncores of this species. Taylor (191!) and Furlong (1925) described
C. minor and C. mexicana and the horn-cores of these species are
considered as typica! of the genus.
Hesse (1935) suggested the possibility that C./urci]er might have
been collected from the Pliocene exposures at Hay Springs. Frick
(1937) does not consider this a possibility. In as much as his material is recorded as from the Pleistocene the qucstiou may be presumed settled. Frick (t937) described a new genus, Texoceros,
based upon a fragmentary horn-core from the Optima fauna. He
considered that the dentition of Capromeryx ahidens belongs with
1.

Research Fund of Texas Technological College.

Texoceros. Apparently he reasoned that all the Pliocene species of
Capromeryx are actually Texoceros, with horn-cores like that of the
latter genus. Stirton (1938) pointed out that if the dentition referred by Hesse to Capromeryx ahidens actually belonged with the
horn-core of Texoceros, then Texoceros would automatically become
a synonym of Capromeryx. Either interpretation may be correct,
but in as much as no typical Capromeryx horn-cores have been found
in the Pliocene, it may tentatively be argued that Capromeryx does
not occur in the Pliocene. If this is correct, then the genus Texoceros
would not be synonymous with Capromeryx.
Capromeryx, like many other fossil genera in which there is a
questionable association of parts, is subject to a great diversity of
interpretation. Whether or not the belief that Capromeryx is confined to the Pleistocene is accepted, that is the status of the genus
as it now appears in the literature. The genus Capromeryx, then,
is made up of the following species. C. ]urci[er, C. minor, C. mexicana, C. gidleyi, and C. minimus.

Horizon arm locality.--Pleistocene. About five miles north of
Slaton, Lubbock County, Texas, on the W. E. Smart Ranch, north
side of Yellowhouse Canyon.
MateriaL--In addition to the type there is an incomplete right
mandible with milk dentition, W. T. M. N~>. 21, and two left horncores, W. T. M. Nos. 19 and 20.
Diagnosis.--Smallest of the known species of Capromeryx. Ramus

reduced anterior prong and nearly vertical, slender posterior prong.
Description.--The fragmentary portion of the left ramus is relatively longer and more slender than in Capromeryx minor or C.
mexicana. The teeth are narrow, high crowned, typically antilocaprid and are similar to those of C. minor. The premolars are short-

ened antero-posteriorly.

P/3 is similar to the corresponding tooth

of C. minor, but the lingual inflection is broadly U-shaped and not
V-shaped as in the latter species. There is a slight postero-external
inflection.

P/4 is similar to P/3 except that there are two lingual

inflections.

There is but one lingual inflection on P/4 in C. minor.

The anterior inflection is V-shaped; the posterior inflection broad
and shallow.

The external contours of the tooth are like those of

P/3.
The first and second lower molars do not differ from those of
C. minor in any diagnostic way.

M/3 is proportionately narrower

and is longer than the corresponding tooth of C. minor. The third
lobe is well developed, noticeably longer than either of the other
two lobes, though this may partially be the result of the stage of
wear of the teeth. This elongation of the third lobe makes the total
length of the tooth row nearly equal to that of C. minor, despite the
shortness of the other teeth.
C. minor and C. mexicana have jaws which are foreshortened with
a considerable depth of ramus below M/3.

The jaw of C. minimus

does not exhibit these characters. C. minimus is immediately distinguished from C. ]urci]er by its nmeh smaller size and the construction of the premolars.
Description o] horn-cores.---W. T. M. No. 19 (Figure 2) is a small
horn-core, well preserved except for the distal tip of the posterior
prong.

The two prongs arise from a common, laterally constricted

hase as in the other species of Capromeryx.
much the longer of the two prongs.

The posterior bea~n is

Although the distal tip is not

preserved its estimated height is less than that of C. mexicana.

It is

considerably longer and more slender than the corresponding beam
of C. minor.

It tapers uniformly from the point of union with the

anterior beam to the distal end.

It is slightly flattened transversely

so that its diameter averages about 2 ram. less in that direction than

From the lateral view it has a forward inclina-

tion which starts just above the point of union of the two beams,
though this inclination is not nearly so pronounced as in C. mexicana.

The posterior face of the larger beam is deeply grooved as in

C. mexicana and C. /urci]er. In C. minimus and C. mexicana the
groove runs ventrally and terminates in the margin of a broad, deep
sulcus that lies at the base of the horn core.

Furlong (1925) states

that there is a similar groove in C. minor, which terminates above a
narrow, deep pit-like sulcus. In C. minimus the anterior face of the
posterior beam has a shallow groove which extends ventrally from
the antero-internal side and terminates on the mid-anterior surface
at the point of junction between the two beams.

Viewed from the

top the anterior and posterior grooves give the appearance of separating the right and left sides of the beam, as though they were
joined in a slightly off-set fashion.

The outer side extends slightly

farther anteriorly than the inner side, while the portion medial to
the two grooves extends farther posteriorly than does the outer side
of the horn core.

The anterior beam is nearly half the height of the posterior beam
measured from the dorsal rim of the orbit. It is triangular in crosssection with the apex of the triangle pointing forward. The posterior
face of the beam is deeply~ concave. Externally, near the anterior
margin is a deep groove which extends from the base of the beam
nearly to the distal end. The anterior beam is similar to the corresponding beam of C. mexicana, C. minor, and C. ]arci]er, but it
is much more reduced.
Another left horn-core W. T. M. No. 20, is not as well preserved
as the one described above, and is badly pitted and etched by solution. It exhibits no particular differences from specimen No. 19
that can be determined except for a slightly more robust anterior
prong and a longer posterior prong; differences that probably arise
from individual variation.
The horn-cores of Capromeryx mexicana differ from those of C.
minor in the slightly different construction of the posterior groove
on the larger prong; in its longer and more slender posterior prong
and in its forward curvature. The anterior prong, is relatively

94

longer and more robust and the lateral constriction of the common
base is more pronounced than in C. minor.
Capromeryx minimus horn-cores differ from those of C. mex~cirna
principally in the more reduced anterior prong and the more vertically situated posterior prong. They differ mainly from C. minor
in the reduced anterior prong and the more slender, tapering postterior beam. They appear to differ from those referred by Frick
(1937) to C. furoi]er in the more reduced anterior prong. C. gidleyi
is not figured by Frick (1937), but the measurements given for the
posterior beam indicate a much larger species.
Discu.sslon.--The genus Capromeryx has been considered the most
likely candidate to fill the role as an ancestral form leading to the
modern pronghorn. Hesse (1935) gave an excellent summary of
the genus with a clear consideration of its relationships. There is
good evidence that some one of the species of Texoceros may represent the ancestral form of .4ntilocapra Americana. However, the
horn-core of Texoceros differs greatly from that of the pronghorn.
It is difficult to imagine that it could be modified in the direction
of Antilocapra. Since dental and other skeletal parts do not seem to
debar Texoceros from an ancestral position it may be speculated that
not all the species referred to this genus truly belong there. However, the question of the relationships of various Pliocene .antelopelike genera with zlntilocapra has been discussed by various authors
and there is no new evidence to be presented on the subject at this
time.
Considering Cal~romeryx as made up of the species enumerated
in the introduction, it seems most improbable that it has any close
relationship with the modern pronghorn. The horn-cores are totally
unlike those of the modern pronghorn and it does not seem probable that they could be modified to the pronghorn type. In addition, Capromeryx and .4ntiIocai~ra have been found associated in
the McKittrick and Rancho La Brea Pleistocene deposits. It does
not appear likely that this occurrence represents another example
of an ancestral form existing contemporaneously with an off-shoot
descendant.
