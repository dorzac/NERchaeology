ABSTRACT
On behalf of URS Corporation (URS) and San Antonio River Authority (SARA), SWCA Environmental
Consultants (SWCA) conducted an intensive cultural resources survey for the Calaveras Creek Floodwater
Retarding Structure No. 10 Rehabilitation Project. Located in southeastern Bexar County, Texas, the project
area is east of Stuart Road approximately 1.5 miles north of the intersection of Stuart Road and State
Highway Loop 1604 in Elmendorf, Texas. This report includes the results of investigations of the 95-acre
project area that surrounds the existing structure. The work was conducted on behalf of URS and SARA, a
political subdivision of the State of Texas, as part of their compliance with the Antiquities Code of Texas
under Permit Number 6630. Additionally, the project is subject to compliance with the National Historic
Preservation Act (NHPA) in anticipation of a U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) Fort Worth District,
Section 404 Nationwide 12 permit in accordance with 33 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) Part 325,
Appendix C (Processing Department of Army Permits: Procedures for the Protection of Historic Properties;
Final Rule 1990; with current Interim Guidance Documents dated April 25, 2005 and January 31, 2007).
SARA proposes to rehabilitate the Natural Resource Conservation Service (formerly the Soil Conservation
Service) dam installed between 1957 and 1958. The rehabilitation project would modify the flood retardant
structure to bring it up to current safety and performance standards and extend the service life for an
additional 50 years. The proposed impacts would be limited to construction activities surrounding the
structure for the rehabilitation (approximately 95 acres). Proposed impacts would include borrow pit areas,
staging and stockpile areas, and a waste disposal area. The initial permit application reported the project
area to be 65 acres in size; however, subsequent engineering plans expanded the project area around the
existing structure to account for all potential impacts. The depth of disturbances will range from 5 to 10
feet deep throughout the project area, specifically within the borrow pit areas. The area of potential effects
(APE) is 95 acres and 5 to 10 feet in depth.
The investigations included a background review and an intensive pedestrian survey with shovel testing of
the project area boundaries. The background review determined that 4.45 acres of the project area had been
previously surveyed and focused entirely on the structure itself. The structure was evaluated and
recommended as not eligible for listing on the National Register of Historic Places (NRHP). The historic
map review determined there are no historic-age properties within the APE. During the archaeological
survey, SWCA archaeologists examined the entire 95-acre APE. Overall, the intensive pedestrian survey
revealed that the proposed project area is within a rural setting intersected by fence lines and two-track
roads. Disturbances related to the initial construction of the dam were evident and consisted of land clearing
activities, grading, and berms. The eastern portion of the APE contained evidence of artificial terracing and
are subject to natural erosion and slope wash. Two surface finds were encountered consisting of a tertiary
flake and tested cobble and were deemed isolated finds based on the lack of additional material on the
surface. A total of 55 shovel tests were excavated within the 95-acre project area of which eight were
positive for cultural materials. Three shovel tests were considered isolated finds based on the lack of
additional positive shovel tests in the vicinity, while the remaining are associated with two newly recorded
sites.
A multicomponent artifact scatter (41BX1993) and a prehistoric campsite and artifact scatter (41BX1994)
were documented within the project area. Both sites consisted primarily of surface scatters with minimal
subsurface deposits. Site 41BX1993 and 41BX1994 are considered not eligible for listing on the NRHP or
for designation as an SAL, based on the lack of research potential and overall prior disturbances.
In accordance with 36 CFR 800.4, SWCA has made a reasonable and good faith effort to identify cultural
resource properties within the APE. As no properties were identified that may meet the criteria for listing
in the NRHP according to 36 CFR 60.4 or for designation as an SAL according to 13 TAC 26.8, SWCA
recommends no further cultural resources work within the project area.

CULTURAL RESOURCE INVESTIGATIONS
Calaveras Creek Floodwater Retarding Structure No. 10 Rehabilitation Project

PROJECT AREA DESCRIPTION

INTRODUCTION

Located in southeastern Bexar County, Texas, the
project area is within the Calveraz Creek Watershed
stream channel impeding water flow downstream to
more developed areas. The structure to be
rehabilitated is a Natural Resource Conservation
Service (NRCS; formerly the Soil Conservation
Service) dam installed between 1957 and 1958. The
rehabilitation project would modify the flood
retardant structure to bring it up to current safety
and performance standards and extend the service
life for an additional 50 years. Rehabilitation of the
dam would require lowering the crest of the
principal spillway by 1.8 feet, installing a 42-inch
diameter principal spillway pipe with an intake riser
and an impact basin at the outlet, and lengthening
the dam by 430 feet. In addition, the auxiliary
spillway crest elevation would be raised 1.1 feet
and armored with articulating blocks.

SWCA Environmental Consultants (SWCA)
conducted an intensive cultural resources survey for
the Calaveras Creek Floodwater Retarding
Structure No. 10 Rehabilitation Project (Figure 1).
Located in southeastern Bexar County, Texas, the
project area is east of Stuart Road approximately
1.5 miles north of the intersection of Stuart Road
and State Highway Loop 1604 in Elmendorf,
Texas.
The work was conducted on behalf of URS
Corporation (URS) and San Antonio River
Authority (SARA), a political subdivision of the
State of Texas, as part of their compliance with the
Antiquities Code of Texas (ACT) under Permit
Number 6630. Additionally, the project is subject
to permitting requirements through the U.S. Army
Corps of Engineers (USACE) Fort Worth District
under Section 404 of the Clean Water Act,
Nationwide Permit 3 in accordance with 33 Code of
Federal Regulations (CFR) Part 325, Appendix C
(Processing Department of Army Permits:
Procedures for the Protection of Historic Properties;
Final Rule 1990; with current Interim Guidance
Documents dated April 25, 2005 and January 31,
2007). As such, the investigations are designed to
comply with Section 106 of the National Historic
Preservation Act (NHPA), as amended, and its
implementing regulations (36 CFR Part 800).

The proposed impacts would be limited to
construction activities surrounding the structure for
the rehabilitation (approximately 95 acres) that
include borrow pit areas, staging and stockpile
areas, and a waste disposal area (Figure 2). The
initial permit application reported the project area
to be 65 acres in size; however, subsequent
engineering plans expanded the project area around
the existing structure to account for all potential
impacts. The depth of disturbances will range from
5 to 10 feet deep throughout, specifically within the
burrow pit areas. The area of potential effects
(APE) is 95 acres and 5 to 10 feet in depth.

The investigations consisted of an intensive
archaeological survey with shovel testing of the
proposed area of potential effects (APE). All
investigations were conducted in accordance with
Texas Historical Commission (THC) and Council
of Texas Archeologist (CTA) standards, as well as
the guidelines provided in Section 106 of the
NHPA. Laura I. Acuña served as Principal
Investigator. Kathryn A. Sloan, Greg Sundborg,
and Rhiana Casias conducted field work on
September 16 and 17, 2013, and September 23 and
24, 2013.

The project area is primarily surrounded by
pastureland and intersected by fence lines. The
majority of terraces overlooking the reservoir is
maintained by frequent vegetation clearing and
consists of short pasture grasses. Few areas around
the structure are overgrown with shrubs, tall
grasses, and trees. The southern portion of the
project, south of the spillway, has been disturbed by
land moving activities altering the landscape for the
construction of the dam.

Calaveras Creek Floodwater Retarding Structure No. 10 Rehabilitation Project

Geologically, the project area is mapped as 100
percent Tertiary-age Wilcox Group, undivided
(Fisher 1983). These deposits are described as
mostly mudstone with various amounts of
sandstone, lignite, ironstone concretions, and
glauconitic, with an approximate thickness of 1,000
feet (Fisher 1983).

Although the archaeological regions are not
absolute, they do generally reflect recognized biotic
communities and physiographic areas in Texas
(Perttula 2004:6). The Central Texas Region, as its
name implies, is in the center of Texas and covers
the Edwards Plateau and portions of the Blackland
prairie east of the Edwards Plateau. The following
synopses provide basic culture histories of the
Central Texas region.

SOILS

PREHISTORIC

The soils of the project area around the structure are
mapped as 44 percent Wilcox loamy fine sand with
3 to 5 percent slopes; 28 percent Wilco loamy fine
sand with 0 to 3 percent slopes; 16 percent
Floresville fine sandy loam with 3 to 5 percent
slopes, severely eroded; and 12 percent Zavala and
Gowen soils with 0 to 2 percent slopes, frequently
flooded.

The archaeological record of the Central Texas
region is known from decades of investigations of
stratified open-air sites and rockshelters throughout
the Edwards Plateau. The region is defined by its
highly dissected eastern and southern margins and
the adjoining margins of physiographic regions to
the east and south (Collins 2004). Traditionally, the
Central Texas archaeological area has included the
Balcones Canyonlands and Blackland Prairie—the
area north of San Antonio (e.g., Prewitt 1981; Suhm
1960). These two areas are on the periphery of the
Central Texas archaeological area, and their
archaeological records and projectile point style
sequences contain elements that suggest influences
from and varying degrees of contact over time with
other areas such as the Lower Pecos and Gulf
Coastal Plain (Collins 2004; Johnson and Goode
1994). Bibliographies concerning archaeological
work done in the region include Black (1989),
Collins (1995), and Johnson and Goode (1994).

GEOLOGY

The Wilco series consists of very deep, well
drained, slowly permeable soils that formed in
sandy alluvium and eolian deposits that occur on
nearly level to sloping paleoterraces. The
Floresville series consist of very deep, well drained,
slowly permeable soils that formed in loamy
alluvium and occur on remnant stream terraces. The
Zavala and Gowen series consist of very deep, well
drained, moderately permeable soils formed in
loamy alluvium and loamy Holocene alluvium,
respectively. These soils occur on nearly level to
undulating, frequently flooded floodplains (NRCS
2013).

PALEOINDIAN PERIOD
Surficial and deeply buried sites, rockshelter sites,
and isolated artifacts represent Paleoindian
(11,500–8800 B.P.) occupations of the Central
Texas region (Collins 2004:116). The period is
often described as having been characterized by
small but highly mobile bands of foragers who were
specialized hunters of Pleistocene megafauna. But
Paleoindians probably used a much wider array of
resources (Meltzer and Bever 1995:59), including
small fauna and plant foods. Faunal remains from
Kincaid Rockshelter and the Wilson-Leonard site
(41WM235) support this view (Bousman 1998;
Collins 1998; Collins et al. 1989). Longstanding
ideas about Paleoindian technologies also are being
challenged.

The soils mapped within the proposed bore pits are
Miguel fine sandy loam with 1 to 3 percent slopes;
Floresville fine sandy loam with 3 to 5 percent
slopes; Wilco loamy fine sand with 3 to 5 percent
slopes; and Zavala and Gowen soils with 0 to 2
percent slopes, frequently flooded. The Miguel
series consist of very deep, well drained, slowly
permeable soils that formed in clayey and loamy
sediments on marine terraces and occur on nearly
level to moderately sloping uplands (NRCS 2013).

CULTURAL SETTING
The proposed project area falls within the Central
Texas Archeological Region (Perttula 2004).

CULTURAL RESOURCE INVESTIGATIONS
Calaveras Creek Floodwater Retarding Structure No. 10 Rehabilitation Project

Collins (2004) divides the Paleoindian period into
early and late subperiods. Two projectile point
styles, Clovis and Folsom, are included in the early
subperiod. Clovis chipped stone artifact
assemblages, including the diagnostic fluted
lanceolate Clovis point, were produced by bifacial,
flake, and prismatic-blade techniques on highquality and oftentimes exotic lithic materials
(Collins 1990). Along with chipped stone artifacts,
Clovis assemblages include engraved stones, bone
and ivory points, stone bolas, and ochre (Collins
2004:116; Collins et al. 1992). Clovis points are
found evenly distributed along the eastern edge of
the Edwards Plateau, where the presence of springs
and outcrops of chert-bearing limestone are
common (Meltzer and Bever 1995:58). Sites within
the area yielding Clovis points and Clovis-age
materials include Kincaid Rockshelter (Collins et
al. 1989), Pavo Real (Henderson and Goode 1991),
and San Macros Springs (Takac 1991). A probable
Clovis polyhedral blade core and blade fragment
was found at the Greenbelt site in San Antonio
(Houk et al. 1997). Analyses of Clovis artifacts and
site types suggest that Clovis peoples were welladapted, generalized hunter-gatherers with the
technology to hunt larger game but not solely rely
on it.

ARCHAIC PERIOD
The Archaic period for Central Texas dates from ca.
8800 to 1300–1200 B.P. (Collins 2004:119–121)
and generally is believed to represent a shift toward
hunting and gathering of a wider array of animal
and plant resources and a decrease in group
mobility (Willey and Phillips 1958:107–108). In
the eastern and southwestern United States and on
the Great Plains, development of horticulturalbased, semisedentary to sedentary societies
succeeds the Archaic period. In these areas, the
Archaic truly represents a developmental stage of
adaptation as Willey and Phillips (1958) define it.
For Central Texas, this notion of the Archaic is
somewhat problematic. An increasing amount of
evidence suggests that Archaic-like adaptations
were in place before the Archaic (see Collins
2004:118, 1998; Collins et al. 1989) and that these
practices continued into the succeeding Late
Prehistoric period (Collins 1995:385; Prewitt
1981:74). In a real sense, the Archaic period of
Central Texas region is not a developmental stage,
but an arbitrary chronological construct and
projectile point style sequence. Establishment of
this sequence is based on several decades of
archaeological investigations at stratified Archaic
sites along the eastern and southern margins of the
Edwards Plateau. Collins (1995, 2004) and Johnson
and Goode (1994) have divided this sequence into
three parts—early, middle, and late—based on
perceived (though not fully agreed upon by all
scholars) technological, environmental, and
adaptive changes.

In contrast, Folsom tool kits—consisting of fluted
Folsom points, thin unfluted (Midland) points,
large thin bifaces, and end scrapers—are more
indicative of specialized hunting, particularly of
bison (Collins 2004:117). Folsom points have been
recovered from Kincaid Rockshelter (Collins et al.
1989) and Pavo Real (Henderson and Goode 1991).

The use of rock and earth ovens (and the formation
of burned rock middens) for processing and
cooking plant foods suggests that this technology
was part of a generalized foraging strategy. The
amount of energy involved in collecting plants,
constructing hot rock cooking appliances, and
gathering fuel ranks most plant foods relatively
low, based on the resulting caloric return (Dering
1999). This suggests that plant foods were part of a
broad-based diet (Kibler and Scott 2000:134) or
part of a generalized foraging strategy, an idea
Prewitt (1981) put forth earlier. At times during the
Late Archaic, this generalized foraging strategy
appears to have been marked by shifts to a
specialized economy focused on bison hunting
(Kibler and Scott 2000:125–137). Castroville,

Postdating Clovis and Folsom points in the
archaeological record are a series of dart point
styles (primarily unfluted lanceolate darts) for
which the temporal, technological, or cultural
significance is unclear. Often, the Plainview type
name is assigned these dart points, but Collins
(2004:117) has noted that many of these points
typed as Plainview do not resemble Plainview typesite points in thinness and flaking technology.
Nonetheless, it has become clear that the artifact
and feature assemblages of the later Paleoindian
subperiod appear to be Archaic-like in nature and in
many ways may represent a transition between the
early Paleoindian and succeeding Archaic periods
(Collins 2004:118).

Montell, and Marcos dart points are elements of
tool kits often associated with bison hunting
(Collins 1968). Archaeological evidence of this
association is seen at Bonfire Shelter in Val Verde
County (Dibble and Lorrain 1968), Jonas Terrace
(Johnson 1995), Oblate Rockshelter (Johnson et al.
1962:116), John Ischy (Sorrow 1969), and Panther
Springs Creek (Black and McGraw 1985).

HISTORIC PERIOD
The historic period in Texas began in 1528 near
Galveston Island with the encounter between the
Pánfilo de Narváez expedition and a Karankawa
group. After disaster befell the expedition, one of
the members, Cabeza de Vaca, spent six years of
wandering through Texas in the 1530s. Cabeza de
Vaca traversed coastal Texas and parts of the
interior and recounted in great ethnographic detail
the peoples he encountered. Based in part from his
exploits and suggestions of a kingdom of gold, the
Coronado expedition was formed to search for a
“northern” Cuzco or Teotihuacan, and by 1540 it
crossed into New Mexico and into Texas
(Fehrenbach 2011).

LATE PREHISTORIC PERIOD
Introduction of the bow and arrow and later,
ceramics into Central Texas, marked the Late
Prehistoric period. Population densities dropped
considerably from their Late Archaic peak (Prewitt
1985:217). Subsistence strategies did not differ
greatly from the preceding period, although bison
again became an important economic resource
during the late part of the Late Prehistoric period
(Prewitt 1981:74). Use of rock and earth ovens for
plant food processing and the subsequent
development of burned rock middens continued
throughout the Late Prehistoric period (Black et al.
1997; Kleinbach et al. 1995:795). Horticulture
came into play very late in the region but was of
minor importance to overall subsistence strategies
(Collins 2004:122).

The following historic discussion focuses on the
San Antonio region and the significance of this
region during the historic period and the creation of
Texas independence, sovereignty, and statehood.
EARLY HISTORIC TO 1718
The Native Americans living in the missions along
the San Antonio River were referred to by the
Spanish as “Coahuiltecans.” The name comes from
a southern tribe named after the Spanish province
of Coahuila, which later became a Mexican state.
The term Coahuiltecan is a generalized term and
makes no distinction between language and cultural
differences of the tribes living in the area. The
abundant berries, nuts, and fish made San Pedro
Springs an attractive place to camp and/or live
(Johnston 1947).

In Central Texas, the Late Prehistoric period
generally is associated with the Austin and Toyah
phases (Jelks 1962; Prewitt 1981:82–84). Austin
and Toyah phase horizon markers and ScallornEdwards and Perdiz arrow points, respectively, are
distributed across most of the state. Violence and
conflict often marked introduction of Scallorn and
Edwards arrow points into Central Texas—many
excavated burials contain these point tips in
contexts indicating they were the cause of death
(Prewitt 1981:83). Subsistence strategies and
technologies (other than arrow points) did not
change much from the preceding Late Archaic
period. Prewitt’s (1981) use of the term
“Neoarchaic” recognizes this continuity. In fact,
Johnson and Goode (1994:39–40) and Collins
(2004:122) state that the break between the Austin
and Toyah phases could easily and appropriately
represent the break between the Late Archaic and
the Late Prehistoric.

The San Antonio area was first explored in 1691 by
the Governor of the Spanish Province of Texas,
Domingo Terán de los Ríos and Father Damián
Massenet. The pair traveled to San Pedro Springs
where they encountered a hunter-gather tribe
named Payaya. In their village, named Yanaguana,
the Payaya lived in simple huts made of brushwood
and grass. The river and village were renamed after
San Antonio de Padua by Terán and Massenet
(Johnston 1947).
Further Spanish exploration was conducted in 1709
by Father Antonio de San Buenaventura y Olivares.
Father Olivares was the first to express interest in

setting up a mission in the San Antonio area
(Fehrenbach 2011; Johnston 1947).

arrested and sent to Mexico. In Monclova, he was
tried and found guilty of treason and shot to death.
His head was sent back to San Antonio as a sign of
defeat (Caldwell 2011).

SPANISH TEXAS: 1718 TO 1820

San Antonio declared for Mexican independence in
1813 but was recaptured by Royalist forces in the
battles of Alazán Creek and Medina. During this
period of unrest, conditions in Texas were
becoming worse. Inadequate provisions and
neglected agricultural fields, along with the fear of
political and military upheavals, forced many
Texans to abandon their homes and move
elsewhere (Fehrenbach 2011; Heusinger 1951).

San Antonio de Béxar Presidio, located on the east
bank of the San Antonio River, was founded in
1718. In the same year, Mission San Antonio de
Valero, later known as the Alamo, was transferred
from the Rio Grande by Father Olivares. This
mission was named after St. Anthony of Padua and
the Marquis de Valero, the Viceroy of New Spain.
The church was originally constructed of adobe and
the huts of wood and thatch (Johnston 1947;
Schoelwer 2011).

TEXAS REVOLUTION, INDEPENDENCE, AND
STATEHOOD: 1820 TO 1848

La Villita, an Indian village about 1,500 feet south
of the Alamo, was built around 1722. The Indians
from the Mission San Antonio de Valero lived in La
Villita in crude huts called “jacales” (Johnston
1947:31). Jacales were typically constructed with
an upright line of poles sunk into a footing ditch and
then woven horizontally with smaller sticks. The
walls were subsequently covered with adobe. Later,
La Villita served as a home to the families of
soldiers who protected the mission (Johnston 1947;
Magruder 2011).

During the Texas Revolution, San Antonio was the
site of several battles, including the siege of Bexar
and the battle of the Alamo (Fehrenbach 2011).
General Martín Perfecto de Cós, along with 650
men, fortified the plaza of San Antonio de Béxar
west of the San Antonio River and the Alamo to the
east. Texan volunteers arrived in San Antonio on
October 12, 1835, to set up camp. Upon hearing that
the Mexican army’s morale and rations were low, a
council was held to decide whether to attack.
Commanding Officer, Edward Burleson and most
of the other officers voted to end the siege. One man
spoke up and asked “Who will go with Old Ben
Milam into San Antonio?” (House 1949:47).
Approximately 300 men joined Milam and the
battle finally began on December 5, 1835. General
Cós focused his troops at the Alamo but was
unsuccessful in holding San Antonio. By the
morning of December 9, 1835, Cós surrendered
(House 1949).

The villa of San Fernando de Béxar was founded in
1731 by the Canary Islanders. The Canary Islanders
were a small group, totaling 56 people, sent by
Spain to colonize the province of Texas. Under the
leadership of Juan Leal Goraz, the village of San
Fernando de Béxar was founded near the Presidio
de Béxar and the first civil government in Texas
was formed.
In 1773, San Antonio de Béxar became the capital
of Spanish Texas. By 1790, most of the Indians
living in San Antonio had either already abandoned
the missions or died from diseases like smallpox
and the measles brought in by Europeans. Mission
San Antonio de Valero was secularized in 1794 and
mission land, excluding the church and convent,
was divided among the few Indians that remained
in the area (Johnston 1947).

On February 23, 1836, nearly 150 American
volunteers took refuge from the approaching
Mexican Army in the Alamo Mission in San
Antonio, Texas under orders from Colonel William
B. Travis (Hatch 1999). A standoff between the
Texas Revolutionary Army and the Mexican Army,
lasting 13 days, ended in complete annihilation of
the Alamo defenders and a victory for the Mexican
General Antonio Lopez de Santa Anna (Huffines
1999).

Spain and Mexican revolutionists fought over San
Antonio throughout the early 1800s. The Casas
revolt of 1811 ended with the assertion of power by
the Spanish regime. Captain Juan Bautista de las
Casas went against the Spanish authority and was

The Alamo Garrison had been acquired following
the defeat of Mexican General Martin Perfecto de
Cós’ army in the December 1835, Battle of San
Antonio. The subsequent formation of the
Matamoros Expedition cost the Alamo much
needed supplies and men. This expedition was
created with the intention of invading Mexico
through the city of Matamoros; however, the plan
was never executed due to political turmoil in the
Texas government. Some relief came over the next
few months with the arrival of Colonel Jim Bowie,
Colonel William B. Travis, and David Crockett;
each bringing 12 to 30 additional men. Rumors of
the approaching Mexican army of nearly 2,000 men
soon followed (Hatch 1999).

On March 4, 1836, General Santa Anna held a
Council of War to decide plans of attack and the
fate of prisoners. The final decision to attack the
Alamo with full force was made the following day,
March 5, 1836 (Hatch 1999). The Mexican army
moved into position just after midnight on March 6,
1836, and waited for the signal to attack. This call
came around five o’clock in the morning when a
soldier cried out “Viva Santa Anna!” (Huffines
1999:134). With the element of surprise lost, Santa
Anna ordered his troops to begin the attack on the
Alamo garrison (Huffines 1999).
The vicious battle, lasting only 90 minutes, left
every Texian combatant dead. The number of
Mexican dead is a matter of debate, with numbers
ranging from 100 to 1,600; uncounted more were
wounded. The Texian’s bodies were burned on
funeral pyres on either side of the Alameda. Santa
Anna won the battle at the Alamo but victory and
independence was won by the Texans two weeks
later in the Battle of San Jacinto (Hatch 1999;
Huffines 1999).

General Santa Anna arrived in San Antonio with
between 1,800 and 2,100 men on February 23,
1836. Upon their arrival, Colonel Travis ordered his
men to retreat into the Alamo (Hatch 1999).
General Santa Anna raised a red flag signifying “no
quarter–no mercy” and received a cannon shot from
the Texians in defiance (Hatch 1999:20). Another
defiant cannon is rumored to have been shot in
response to a request for an unconditional
surrender. In a letter sent February 24, 1836,
addressed to the “People of Texas and all
Americans in the World,” Colonel Travis pleas for
assistance and states “if this call is neglected, I am
determined to sustain myself as long as possible &
die like a soldier who never forgets what is due his
own honor & that of his country. Victory or Death”
(Groneman 2001:6).

After Mexican forces were removed from San
Antonio in December of 1836, the Republic of
Texas began organizing Bexar County. The next
month, San Antonio was chartered as the county
seat. Despite these progressions, many conflicts
continued to occur in San Antonio, including the
Council House Fight of 1840 and two Mexican
invasions in 1842 (Fehrenbach 2011).
1848 TO 1900

Over the next few days the Alamo defenders
suffered shortages of provisions and water, constant
bombardment on the Alamo and psychological
warfare through the nights ordered by General
Santa Anna. On the third day of the siege, Mexican
troops created a diversion at the Alamo’s main gate
in an attempt to cross the San Antonio River and
reach the south wall of the Alamo through La
Villita. The Texians repelled both attacks and
subsequently burned buildings in close proximity to
the Alamo to deny shelter for Santa Anna’s men in
La Villita (Hatch 1999). General Santa Anna
ordered many small attacks in an attempt to breach
the Alamo’s walls. Many Mexicans lost their lives
in the process; however, no Texians were killed in
the 12-day siege before the final battle (Hatch 1999;
Huffines 1999).

After Texas entered the Union in 1845, San
Antonio’s already diverse population grew
dramatically. The Irish came to Texas in the late
1830s to early 1840s and established Irish Flat.
Germans settled in San Antonio in the 1850s,
introducing the Bier Halle to the area. French
immigrants added artists and artisans to the culture
of the city. Later immigrants to the area included
Polish, Italians, Greeks, Syrians, and in 1910,
Chinese—all of whom formed small communities
within the City of San Antonio.
Culture and architecture from each immigrant
community have seeped into San Antonio and
merged together, forming a rich cultural
community. This diverse culture is evident as you

attractions. The San Antonio Riverwalk, also
known as the Paseo del Rio, consists of more than
2.5 miles of shops and restaurants, as well as a boat
ride along the channel. This is one of San Antonio’s
most visited attractions.

On March 2, 1861, Texas seceded from the Union
and soon after, the Civil War began. San Antonio
was a Confederate storage area as well as a location
to form military units; however, the city kept its
distance from most of the fighting (Fehrenbach
2011).

San Antonio Missions National Historical Park
includes The Alamo (1718), Mission Concepción
(1731), Mission San José (1720), Mission San Juan
Capistrano (1731), and Mission San Francisco de la
Espada (1741). San Fernando Cathedral (1758), the
Spanish Governor's Palace (1749), the Quadrangle
at Fort Sam Houston (1878), and the Bexar County
Courthouse (1891) are visited due to their
interesting architecture.

After the Civil War, industries such as cattle,
distribution, ranching, mercantile, gas and oil, and
military centers in San Antonio prospered. The
arrival of a railway transportation system in San
Antonio in 1877 inspired economic growth
throughout the city (Fehrenbach 2011; House
1949). Modernization increased dramatically
between the 1880s and the 1890s, compared to the
rest of the United States. Civic government,
utilities, electric lights, street railways, street
paving and maintenance, water supply, telephones,
hospitals, and a power plant were all established or
planned around this time (Fehrenbach 2011).

METHODS
BACKGROUND REVIEW
SWCA performed a cultural resources file records
review to determine if the proposed APE has been
previously surveyed for cultural resources or if any
archaeological sites have been recorded within or
adjacent to the APE. To conduct this review, an
SWCA archaeologist reviewed the Elmendorf
USGS 7.5-minute topographic quadrangle map on
the THC Texas Archeological Sites Atlas (Atlas).
This source provided information on the nature and
location of previously conducted archaeological
surveys, previously recorded cultural resource sites,
locations of National Register of Historic Places
(NRHP) properties, sites designated as State
Antiquities Landmarks (SAL), Official Texas
Historical Markers, Registered Texas Historic
Landmarks, cemeteries, and local neighborhood
surveys. Aerial photographs, Bureau of Economic
Geology Maps, and the Natural Resources
Conservation Services’ (NRCS) Web Soil Survey
were also examined. Texas Department of
Transportation (TxDOT) Historic Overlay was also
examined to identify the presence of potential
historic-age structures (Foster et al. 2006). In
addition, a host of Bexar County-specific resources
and aerial photographs were reviewed to assist in
identifying any historic resources or disturbances.

1900 TO 1950
In 1921, a disastrous flood engulfed Houston Street
and St. Mary’s Street with approximately 9 feet of
water. In response to this event, the Olmos Dam
was built to prevent further flooding and sections of
the San Antonio River were straightened and
widened as well. Another recommendation was to
construct an underground channel in downtown San
Antonio and to cover portions of the river with
concrete. This last idea upset many people, but
eventually the compromise was reached by creating
a riverwalk with shops and restaurants.
Construction of this riverwalk was completed in
1941 (Long 2011).
As the United States entered into World War II, San
Antonio became an important military center and
other city activities and construction ceased for
nearly 5 years. Fort Sam Houston, Kelly, Randolph,
Brooks and Lackland air force bases are all active
military training centers today (Heusinger 1951).
Tourism is one of the San Antonio’s most important
industries, drawing tens of thousands of visitors
every year. More recent features include theme
parks, zoos, museums, gardens, parks, and sporting

ARCHAEOLOGICAL SURVEY
SWCA’s investigations consisted of an intensive
pedestrian survey with subsurface investigations
within the project area. Archaeologists examined
the ground surface, erosional profiles, and
exposures for cultural resources. Subsurface
investigations involved shovel testing in settings
with the potential to contain buried cultural
materials.

(d) that have yielded, or may be likely to yield,
information important in prehistory or history.

RESULTS

Shovel tests were systematically excavated within
the project area. THC survey standards call for the
excavation of 16 shovel tests per mile for linear
projects with a 100-foot-wide right-of-way (ROW)
and one shovel test per 2 acres for area surveys
between 11 and 100 acres, or 199 shovel tests for
the project area. Shovel tests were approximately
30 centimeters (cm) in diameter and excavated in
20-cm arbitrary levels to 1 m in depth or to
culturally sterile deposits, whichever came first.
The matrix was screened through ¼-inch mesh. The
location of each shovel test was plotted using a
hand-held GPS receiver and each test was recorded
on appropriate project field forms.

BACKGROUND REVIEW
The background review determined that portions of
the APE have been previously surveyed and no
recorded cultural resources are within its boundary.
In addition, four previously recorded sites, three
previously recorded surveys, and one cemetery are
within a 1-mile radius of the project area. The San
Lorenzo Panteon (cemetery)
is located
approximately 0.80 mile northwest of the project
area.
A survey was conducted by a NRCS cultural
resource specialist in 2012 within portions of the
APE, specifically on the dam embankment,
auxiliary spillway, and permanent reservoir area
(Bednarz 2012; NRCS 2012). The survey
determined that there are no properties included or
eligible for listing on the NRHP within the project
area. The dam and appurtenances were evaluated
under NRHP criteria and were considered not
eligible for listing. The investigations determined
the structure is a typical floodwater retarding
structure in design and function with no unique
engineering characteristics or relationship to
important events or individuals. The determination
was reported to the State Historic Preservation
Officer at the THC in October 2012 and the THC
concurred with the recommendations (Bednarz
2012; THC Tracking Number 201301698).

SWCA conducted a non-collection survey.
Artifacts, had any been encountered, would have
been tabulated, analyzed, and documented in the
field, but not collected.

SITE EVALUATIONS
All newly documented archaeological sites were
evaluated according to the National Register
Criteria for Evaluation (Criteria) as codified in 36
Code of Federal Regulations, Chapter 60.4, which
states: The quality of significance in American
history, architecture, archaeology, engineering, and
culture is present in districts, sites, buildings,

(Atlas 2013). No cultural resources were
encountered within a 1-mile radius of the current
project area during the investigations. The CPS
Energy Southgate Natural Gas Pipeline survey
investigations
identified
eighteen
cultural
resources, of which three (41BX1306, 41BX1310,
and 41BX1312) are within a 1-mile radius of the
proposed rehabilitation project (Nash et al. 1999).
Sites 41BX1306, 41BX1310, and 41BX1312 are
prehistoric lithic scatters consisting of debitage
flakes and stone tools. Sites 41BX1310 and
41BX1320 were recommended as not eligible for
NRHP or State Archaeological Landmark (SAL)
listing. Additional testing investigations were
conducted on site 41BX1306 to determine its
significance and determine its eligibility status for
NRHP and SAL. The investigations determined the
site was not significant and no further work was
recommended. An intensive survey, conducted for
the Lakeview Ranch Development project,
recorded site 41BX1769 approximately 0.91 mile
southwest of the project area (Atlas 2013). The site
is a prehistoric lithic scatter consisting of an
Abasolo dart point, debitage flakes, cores, and other
stone tool fragments. The site was recommended as
not eligible for NRHP or SAL listing and no further
work was recommended (Atlas 2013).

map. The Stoner Map System (ca. 1930s–1940s)
sheet 1012 also depicts two structures within the
project area and within a 100-acre parcel owned by
Francisca and Florence Hernandez. A review of
historic aerials dating from 1955 to 1973 indicates
the land use of the project area and vicinity is
primarily agricultural. The project is surrounded by
pasture and agricultural parcels, with vegetation
concentrated along the stream channel of Parita
Creek.
The buildings depicted on the 1953 Army Map are
not visible on the 1955 aerial photograph. The dam
was constructed between 1957 and 1958 and the
aerial photography indicates that vegetation was
removed and cleared from the structure and
spillways. The aerial photography dating from 1963
to 1973 indicate there are no extant structures
within the APE and that most of the project area has
been cleared of vegetation.

ARCHAEOLOGICAL SURVEY
SWCA archaeologists conducted an intensive
archaeological survey with shovel testing of the 95acre project area (Figure 3). Approximately 4.45
acres, primarily the structure, was previously
surveyed (Bednarz 2012; NRCS 2012). However,
28.42 acres of the reservoir was not surveyed
during the investigations. Investigations were
concentrated within the proposed bore pit areas and
staging areas. The areas of “no anticipated impacts”
were also examined as disturbances will be limited
to vehicular and heavy machinery traffic during
rehabilitation. Two archaeological sites were
recorded within the project area and evaluated for
NRHP eligibility.

HISTORIC MAP REVIEW
Historic maps dating from 1871 to 1953 were
reviewed to determine if there are any historic-age
resources within the APE (Foster et al. 2006). Two
structures are depicted on a 1953 Army Map for
Elmendorf, Texas, adjacent to the southern
boundary of the rehabilitation project area (Foster
et al. 2006). Another building is depicted along the
northern boundary of the project area on the same

Field investigations encountered a mostly rural
environment consisting of maintained range land
with pasture grasses. The ground surface visibility
ranged from 20 to 60 percent, with 100 percent
ground surface visibility along two-track roads and
slope wash areas. Portions of the project area, along
the southwestern and eastern boundaries, contained
moderate vegetation consisting of cacti, shrubs, tall
grasses, mesquite, and other trees. The southeastern
portion, between the dam and reservoir, also
contained evidence of exposed sandstone
outcropping. The northern portion of the project
area, along the reservoir, was almost entirely
cleared of vegetation with other disturbances
consisting of fence lines and two-track roads
(Figure 4). The eastern portion of the project area,
just north of the dam, exhibited evidence of slope
wash, erosion, and large surface exposures yielding
100 percent ground surface visibility (Figure 5).
Overlooking the reservoir, the landform appeared
to be terraced (Figure 6).

Figure 4. Overview of bore pit area, facing west.

The southern portion of the project, south of the
dam and spillway, was generally cleared with
vegetation concentrated along an unnamed
drainage that parallels the dam (Figure 7). Within
the drainage channel, high energy flow from
flooding episodes has heavily eroded the channel
exposing sandstone bedrock. The drainage and
adjacent terraces south of the spillway were altered
and graded, this area likely served as a borrow pit
during the initial construction of the dam (Figure 8).
Subsequent improvements at the eastern end of the
dam expanded the structure in the form of two
berms just north of the drainage. Overall, the entire
project area exhibited disturbances related to the
initial construction of the dam, subsequent
maintenance and improvements, terracing, and
natural erosion.

Figure 5. Overview of eastern portion of project
area with surface exposures and terracing, facing
north-northwest.

A total of 55 shovel tests were excavated within the
95-acre project area (Appendix A). The majority of
the shovel tests were excavated within the proposed
bore pit areas. Eight shovel tests were positive for
cultural materials. Three were considered isolated
finds (LA06, LA08, and LA11) while the remaining
were associated with two newly recorded sites.

Figure 8. From eastern end of structure, overview
of berms and spillway, facing south-southwest.

One isolated find consisted of a tertiary flake at 0 to
5 cmbs within the western end of project area
(LA06). Another tertiary flake was encountered
between 0 and 25 cmbs (LA08) within a south
trending landform overlooking the reservoir at the
northwestern end of the project area. A slate
fragment was also encountered at the northwestern
end within a shovel test (LA11) at 0 to 25 cmbs.
The artifacts were deemed isolated finds based on
the lack of additional positive shovel tests in the
vicinity and the severely disturbed context of the
area. In addition, the two surface finds encountered
within the northwestern portion of the project area
consisted of a tertiary flake and a tested cobble.

Two archaeological sites were encountered during
the investigations and evaluated for NRHP
eligibility. The sites consisted of a multicomponent (prehistoric and historic) artifact scatter
and prehistoric campsite. As discussed below, both
have been severely disturbed by impacts related to
the construction of the dam and maintenance. The
sites are recommended as not eligible for listing on
the NRHP and no further work is recommended.
41BX1993
Site 41BX1993 is located approximately 1.53 miles
north-northeast of the Stuart Road and Loop 1604
intersection, 4.31 miles northeast of Elmendorf,
Texas. The site is on a slope ridge of a north
trending upland, overlooking the Calaveras Dam
spillway of Parita Creek to the north (Figure 9). The
ridge overlooks a confluence of Parita Creek and an
unnamed upland drainage that meanders across the
southern portion of the project area. The site is
between a property fence line and the edge of the
ridge.

Overall, shovel tests were excavated to depths
ranging from 30 to 50 cmbs surface and consisted
of clay loam and sandy clay loam. Some shovel
tests terminated at basal clay. The THC’s survey
standards for projects of this size recommend one
shovel test per 2 acres for project areas 11 to 100
acres in size, for a total of 47 shovel tests for the
project area. SWCA exceeded the number of shovel
tests required for the 95-acre project area.

CULTURAL RESOURCE INVESTIGATIONS
Calaveras Creek Floodwater Retarding Structure No. 10 Rehabilitation Project

The vegetation on the site consists of pasture
grasses with ground surface visibility ranging from
60 to 100 percent. The ridge has been altered by
grading and land moving activities related to the
construction of the dam. Other disturbances consist
of a property fence line and frequent vegetation
maintenance of the area for the dam (Figure 10).
The artifact scatter was initially discovered during
the survey when a light concentration of flakes and
historic material was identified on the ridge
adjacent to the fence line. The site is approximately
10 m northwest to southeast by 80m northeast to
southwest in size based on the extent of the surface
scatter. The site likely extends to the south across
the upland landform within the undeveloped area.
A total of five shovel tests were excavated to
delineate the site. Three shovel tests are within the
site boundary of which two are positive. One shovel
test (LA01) contained clear glass (n=4), window
glass (n=1), milk glass (n=1), and plain whiteware
(n=2) between 0 to 10 cmbs; and a ceramic sphere
at 10 to 20 cmbs. The second shovel tests (GS02)
contained patinated clear glass (n=3) between 0 to
15 cmbs and a plain whiteware fragment at 15 to 25
cmbs. The soils consisted of shallow sandy clay
loam and clay loam.

Figure 10. Overview of site 41BX1993, facing
north-northeast.

Artifacts observed on the surface included both
prehistoric and historic artifacts. The prehistoric
surface assemblage includes several lithic debitage
flakes and a dart point fragment. The projectile
point appears to have been modified and may be a
Lange point, which suggests a possible Late
Archaic component (Figure 12; Turner et al. 2011).
The historic surface artifact assemblage includes
vessel glass, milk glass, plain and decorated
whiteware, porcelain, and stoneware (Figure 11).
The bulk of the site likely extends across the
landform to the south, outside of the project area.
Given that the assemblage consists of mixed
material types with no distinct concentration, the
site represents a sparse multicomponent artifact
scatter. The evidence suggests that the materials are
possibly slope wash from the adjacent landform. No
prehistoric features or historic structures were
observed within the project area.

southern portion consists of cacti, shrubs, tall
grasses, and some trees. It appears that the site was
previously cleared of vegetation and artificial
terracing is evident. The site is subject to slope
wash and erosion; previous disturbances yielded
100 percent visibility in some areas (Figure 14).
Other disturbances consist of a property fence line,
a two track road that intersects the site, and frequent
maintenance of the area for the dam in the northern
portion.

41BX1993 SUMMARY
Site 41BX1993 does not meet Criteria A, B, or C of
36 CFR 60.4, but SWCA evaluated the site for
eligibility under Criterion D, which considers its
ability to yield information important in prehistory
or history. Site 41BX1993 is a small, deflated
multicomponent scatter. The site has been severely
impacted by land clearing activities related to the
construction of the dam, maintenance, and fencing.
The artifact assemblage is sparse and dispersed
across the ridge with subsurface deposits at 25
cmbs. The level of disturbances has negatively
impacted the integrity of the site, eliminating the
possibility of identifying discrete activity areas.
The lack of features and related structures suggests
the site is a small multicomponent artifact scatter,
which is typical of the region and contains little- tono research value.

The prehistoric artifact scatter was initially
discovered during the survey when a concentration
of lithic debitage flakes were identified on the
surface and two shovel tests were positive for
cultural material. The site is approximately 170 m
east-west by 450 m north-south size based on the
extent of the surface scatter and landform. The site
likely extends across the upland landform east of
the project boundaries. Initially, the site was
recorded as two separate sites based on the shovel
tests; however, the boundaries were combined to
reflect the overall extent of material on the surface
related to the landform. A total of 28 shovel tests
were excavated to delineate the site. Twenty-one
shovel tests are within the site boundary of which
three are positive. One shovel test (RC06)
contained a secondary flake and tested core
between 0 and 10 cmbs. An adjacent shovel test
(RC07) contained a tested cobble and two tertiary
flakes between 0 and 10 cmbs. One shovel test
located at the southern half of the site contained a
secondary chert flake and a possible arrow point
preform between 0 and 10 cmbs. The preform
appears to have faint notches on either side (Figure
15).

The site lacks integrity, features, and the potential
for significant subsurface deposits. Based on these
factors, the site has limited potential to yield
information important to the prehistory of the
region. SWCA recommends that 41BX1993 is not
eligible for inclusion on the NRHP or for SAL
designation. As such, no further work or avoidance
strategy is recommended for the site.
41BX1994
Site 41BX1994, a prehistoric artifact scatter, is
located approximately 2.0 miles north-northeast of
the Stuart Road and Loop 1604 intersection, 4.31
miles northeast of Elmendorf, Texas. The site is
situated on the sloping terraces of a landform
northwest of the dam, overlooking Parita Creek and
the reservoir (Figure 13). The slope trends northnorthwest towards the reservoir and the landform
extends east outside of the project area.

Artifacts observed on the surface across the site and
within two burned rock scatter features include
lithic debitage flakes, burned rock fragments, cores
and core fragments, a dart point fragment, and few
historic artifact materials. Outside of the identified
features, the lithic debitage flakes consist of
primary flakes (n=5), secondary flakes (50), tertiary
flakes (n=42) and shatter (n=30) made primarily of
chert material.

The site encompasses most of the eastern portion of
the project area that consists of maintained pasture
grasses and moderate vegetation. Divided by a
fence line, the northern portion of the project area
consists of pasture grasses with ground surface
visibility ranging from 30 to 60 percent. The

Few pieces consisted of course-grained quartzite.
The artifact scatter is sparse and widely dispersed
across the project area with denser concentrations
observed within two burned rock scatter features
encountered within the southern portion of the site.
The counts are general estimates based on what was
observed. Surface material has been severely
impacted by frequent maintenance of the terraces
overlooking the reservoir, land clearing activities,
erosion, slope wash, and terracing within the
southern portion of the site.
Feature 1 consists of a scatter of burned sandstone
rock and debitage flakes measuring 4 m east to west
by 17 m north to south (Figure 16). The surface was
severely eroded affording 100 percent ground
surface visibility. The burned rock was diffused and
scattered with no clear concentration indicating a
hearth or cooking pit. Approximately 25 lithic
debitage flakes and shatter, five core fragments, 30
pieces of burned rock measuring 0 to 10 cm in size
were observed. The debitage material consisted of
chert and some pieces of coarse-grained quartzite.
Feature 2 is a larger scatter of burned rock and
debitage measuring 10 m east to west by 26 m north
to south (Figure 17). The feature is intersected by a
two-track road at the northern portion of the site.
Materials are very dispersed with no clear
concentrations of burned rock indicating a hearth or
cooking pit. Approximately 120 lithic debitage
flakes and shatter, 25 core fragments, 40 burned
sandstone fragments, and a complete projectile
point were encountered within the surface. Some
historic materials were also observed and include a
rifle shell, two shot gun shells, and a ceramic pipe
cover. The artifact counts are estimates and are
primarily within the features and exposed surface
areas. The projectile point is possibly a Kinney dart
point, suggesting a possible Middle Archaic
component to the site (Figure 18; Turner et al.
2011).

Figure 18. Kinney point.

The bulk of the site likely extends across the
landform to the east, outside of the project area.
Given that the assemblage consists of mixed
material types with no distinct concentration, the
site represents a widely diffused prehistoric artifact
scatter and campsite with a small assemblage of
historic artifacts. The evidence suggests that most
of the materials are possibly slope wash from the
adjacent landform and have also been dispersed by
land clearing activities, terracing, and maintenance
of the terraces overlooking the reservoir. The
burned rock scatter suggest the site is a prehistoric
campsite with a period of occupation spanning from
the Archaic period to the Late Prehistoric based on
the Kinney dart point and possible arrow point
preform. However, there are no discrete
occupations due to the lack of stratigraphic deposits
and the extensive, disturbed nature of scatter.

The artifact assemblage is sparse across the entire
site with concentrated areas focused within the
features in the southern portion. The materials are
dispersed across the ridge with subsurface deposits
at 25 cmbs. The level of disturbances has negatively
impacted the integrity of the site, eliminating the
possibility of identifying discrete activity areas.
The lack of features and related structures suggests
the site is a prehistoric campsite and artifact scatter,
which is typical of the region and contains little-tono research value.
The site lacks integrity, features, and the potential
for significant subsurface deposits. Based on these
factors, the portions of the site within the APE have
limited potential to yield information important to
the prehistory of the region. SWCA recommends
that 41BX1994 is not eligible for inclusion on the
NRHP or for SAL designation. As such, no further
work or avoidance strategy is recommended for the
site.

41BX1994 SUMMARY
Site 41BX1994 does not meet Criteria A, B, or C of
36 CFR 60.4, but SWCA evaluated the site for
eligibility under Criterion D, which considers the
ability of a site to yield information important in
prehistory or history. Site 41BX1994 is a relatively
large, dispersed lithic scatter and campsite. The site
has been severely impacted by land clearing
activities related to maintenance of the dam,
fencing, two-track roads, and artificial terracing.
The historic artifact materials are limited to a few
pieces and there are no historic structures or
features within the site boundaries.

CONCLUSIONS AND
RECOMMENDATIONS
On behalf of URS and SARA, SWCA conducted an
intensive cultural resources survey for the
Calaveras Creek Floodwater Retarding Structure
No. 10 Rehabilitation Project. This report includes
the results of investigations of the 95-acre project
area. The work was conducted as part of the
sponsor’s compliance with the ACT (Permit
Number 6630) and the NHPA in anticipation of a

20

CULTURAL RESOURCE INVESTIGATIONS
Calaveras Creek Floodwater Retarding Structure No. 10 Rehabilitation Project

Section 404 Nationwide Permit from the USACEFort Worth District.

A multicomponent artifact scatter (41BX1993) and
a prehistoric campsite and artifact scatter
(41BX1994) were documented within the project
area. Both sites consisted primarily of surface
scatters with minimal subsurface deposits. Based
on the lack of research potential and overall prior
disturbances, sites 41BX1993 and 41BX1994 are
recommended as not eligible for listing on the
NRHP or for designation as an SAL.

SARA proposes to rehabilitate the NRCS dam
installed in 1957 to 1958. The rehabilitation project
would modify the flood retardant structure to bring
it up to current safety and performance standards
and extend the service life for an additional 50
years. The proposed impacts would be limited to
construction activities surrounding the structure for
the rehabilitation that include borrow pit areas,
staging and stockpile areas, and a waste disposal
area. The initial permit application reported the
project area to be 65 acres in size; however,
subsequent engineering plans expanded the project
area around the existing structure to account for all
potential impacts. The depth of disturbances will
range from 5 to 10 feet deep throughout,
specifically within the burrow pit areas. The area of
potential effects APE is 95 acres and 5 to 10 feet in
depth.

In accordance with 36 CFR 800.4, SWCA has made
a reasonable and good faith effort to identify
cultural resource properties within the APE. As no
properties were identified that meet the criteria for
listing in the NRHP according to 36 CFR 60.4 or
for designation as an SAL, according to 13 TAC
26.8, SWCA recommends no further cultural
resources work within the project area.

The investigations included a background review
and an intensive pedestrian survey with shovel
testing of the project area boundaries. The
background review determined that 4.45 acres had
been previously surveyed and focused entirely on
the dam itself. The historic map review determined
there are no historic-age properties within the APE.
During the archaeological survey, SWCA
archaeologists examined the entire 95-acre APE.
Overall, the intensive pedestrian survey revealed
that the proposed project area is within a rural
setting intersected by fence lines and two-track
roads. Disturbances related to the initial
construction of the dam were evident and consisted
of land clearing activities, grading, and berms. The
eastern portion of the APE contained evidence of
artificial terracing and are subject to natural erosion
and slope wash. Two surface finds were
encountered consisting of a tertiary flake and tested
cobble and were deemed isolated finds based on the
lack of additional material on the surface. A total of
55 shovel tests were excavated within the 95-acre
project area, of which eight were positive for
cultural materials. Three shovel tests were
considered isolated finds based on the lack of
additional positive shovel tests in the vicinity, while
the remaining are associated with two newly
recorded sites.
