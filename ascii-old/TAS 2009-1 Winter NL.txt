Academies Offer New
Topics in ’09

It is with pleasure that I take on the duties of president of
the Texas Archeological Society for the coming year. It is actually my second stab at the job. My first attempt was in 1988. I
didn’t make it through my whole term, having to return to Ph.D.
studies at Harvard University (or else!). I shall be eternally
grateful to Teddy Lou Stickney for serving the remainder of my
first term in such fine fashion. For Joe Rogers’ sake, I will try
really hard to stick around for the whole term this time!
This society has been very important in my development
as an archaeologist. As a child, growing up in the south Texas
town of Edinburg, my first archaeology-related memory was
of two shotgun shell boxes full of arrowheads that my dad
and his fishing buddy brought back from a trip to Falcon
Lake on the Río Grande. These artifacts fascinated me and
fired my imagination. My dad sensed my strong interest and
did what he could to promote it. We had subscriptions to

This spring will be the seventh year that Academies have
been offered. Several new topics headline the programs in
February and March: Historic Archeology and Big Bend—A
Regional Study. The third Academy topic is back by popular
demand—Archeology 101 with a field day at the Gault site
will be held in late January.
The central Texas town of Georgetown will host ARCHEOLGY 101 on January 30 and 31 and the field day will be
held on February 1. Archeology 101, written and lead by Dr.
Harry Shafer, was designed to answer the questions—what do
archeologists do and why. The equivalent of a college course
semester is packed into three days with a 100 page manual and
power-point presentations. Previous participants listed “how
to apply classroom materials to actual site, Clovis technology, and mapping/compass” as the best thing they learned.
The Gault School staff led by Dr. Clark Wernecke will teach
a variety field techniques on Sunday.
Study Butte, west of the Big Bend National Park, will
be the setting for BIG BEND: A REGIONAL ACADEMY.
A team of archeologists—Tom Alex (BBNP), Tim Roberts
(TPWD), and Melissa Williams (CBBS)—will lead participants through a series of lectures and tours. Archeology,
rock art and historic sites will be featured beginning Friday
evening, February 20, and continue through Sunday noon.
Participants will visit Indian Head rock art site, Terlingua
and Castolon.
Brazoria County, just south of Houston, is home to
many plantation sites from the early 1800s. The HISTORIC
ARCHEOLOGY Academy will be lead by archeologist Joan
Few, author of Sugar, Planters, Slaves and Convicts. Her
research at the Jackson Plantation and other historic sites
enables her to present an overview of historic archeology in
Texas using local data to illustrate the broad principles. Handson activities integrated into the lectures will demonstrate key

National Geographic and Life. These magazines often carried
wonderful articles on archaeology and paleontology. I vividly
remember reading of the exploits of Louis and Mary Leakey
at Olduvai Gorge and of the rescue of Abu Simbel in Egypt’s
Aswan Reservoir. My little elementary school, Robert E. Lee,
had several of the simple, standard books on archaeology with
which many of you are probably familiar. In the 1950s, though,
this was about it. There was no internet. We got a television
about 1957. There were two channels to choose from and I
don’t remember seeing any archaeology programming to speak
of during the next decade before I left home.
Somehow, Dad found out about the Texas Archeological
Society. He got me a membership in 1963 and the several
Bulletins I received at that time (a nice “signing bonus” we
used to get back in the old days) are still among the most
prized volumes in my library. The TAS thus provided my first
exposure to the world of formal archaeology. Looking back
now, I think: “What better way could there have been for a
kid to get a start in archaeology?” It is just as true today as
it was back then. Our society offers a wonderful opportunity
for people of all ages to get their start in archaeology and to
continue developing and gaining knowledge with virtually no
limits as to how far they want to go with it.
As an undergraduate student at The University of Texas, I
thrived on courses taught by T. N. Campbell, Dee Ann Story,
and E. Mott Davis. Can you imagine? I came under the tutelage of Elton Prewitt, who was my first and greatest mentor
and teacher. My professional career began in 1973, working
for Elton and UT’s Texas Archeological Survey on a project in
northeast Texas. Major projects followed: Allen’s Creek on the
Brazos River, Tom Hester’s Choke Canyon Project for UTSA
on the Frio River, Richard Adams’ expedition to Rio Azul in
Guatemala, and Texas Tech’s projects at the Spanish colony
of San Sabá. I received my BA at UT in 1975, an MA from
UTSA in 1983, and Ph.D. from Harvard University in 1989.
My teaching career began at Texas Tech in 1990 and will end
in January of 2009, when my wife, Patsy, and I will take up
residence near Richland Springs in San Saba County.
Unlike the 1950s, TAS now has lots of formidable competition. The internet offers unlimited access to archaeological information from around the world. It is possible to sit
at a computer and visit the British Museum or do “virtual”
archaeological digs, sans sweat, hard work, thunderstorms,
and bugs. Television carries numerous programs on archaeology and paleontology. Indiana Jones and Laura Croft have
popularized archaeology in the cinema. Small wonder that we
have had such a hard time trying to increase our membership
over the past 20 years. It’s a tough market within which TAS

Seminole Canyon. (Photo by K. Killen)
competes. Our challenge continues to be making the society
relevant and worthwhile to existing members and attractive to
new members. Each of you can help by letting the society’s
officers know how you think things can be improved, and
ways in which we can reach out to new members.
Soon, our venerable institution will boast 80 volumes of
the Bulletin of the Texas Archeological Society, representing
80 years of research and publication. This, in and of itself,
is a remarkable accomplishment. We continue to hold field
schools and annual meetings. We have contributed to Texas
Beyond History, developed by my old friend and colleague
Steve Black, and so can be said to have tapped into the power
of the internet to promote Texas archaeology. We have a fine
newsletter, which informs the membership, and academies
which provide advanced training and education. Take all of
this into consideration and it becomes clear what a remarkable
and worthwhile organization it is that we have. I have heard it
said many times that our society is the finest of its kind in the
United States. When we pause for a moment and take a look
at all we do, we know that this is not an exaggeration.
In terms of objectives for TAS during my tenure, I see our
primary task as maintaining the effectiveness and vigor of the
organization through what look to be some very trying economic- and social times ahead for the state and country. Due to
cost increases, the Executive Committee recently, and with great
reluctance, came to the conclusion that a dues increase was necessary. This increase was approved by the general membership at
the recent annual meeting in Lubbock and will be in effect when
you next pay your dues. Our fear, of course, is that an increase in
dues will lead to loss of membership. When it comes time for you
to make that decision, I hope you will decide to stay with TAS
for all the reasons mentioned above. TAS does good things and,
even with the dues increase, is a true value for the price.
Let’s begin looking forward to the great Academies
scheduled for this year, the Field School near Perryton up in
the Panhandle in June, and the 2009 Annual Meeting in Del
Rio. All hold great promise for learning and good times together in our shared appreciation for archaeology in Texas.

Academy Pentametry
By W. Sue Gross
I began with paper, pen and ink
To compose a poem, I had to think.
As all of the TAS learnings began to sink,
In my mind, I made the important link.
At each session, you too can learn the following thing.
In Arch 101, you learn to keep a level line,
By steady hand and stadia, or simple datum and twine.
Who knew that dirt could go thru a screen so fine,
Each level is kept in a separate bag, so take care not to combine.
A unit may be full of artifacts, or you might not find anything.
In Lithics, you wonder how many times did he try
To make a point, and where did the chips and flakes fly.
If one should break, he did not cry,
Was it a percussion flute, or a hinge break set too high.
A good knapper, with a crack and a thud, can make the rock sing.
In Ceramics, you look at the details of the sherd temper
Of bone, sand, or grog, but you should remember.
The same theory of sorting will apply to any pottery member,
Even pre- or historic, you will admire the vessel assembler.
With a coil and a base, you can make your own pot for keeping.
In Rock Art, it could be Hueco, Pecos, or Seminole,
You study the design and the cultural role.
It will give you insight into the artist’s soul,
No paint by number, it was either plant, ore, or coal.
You learn the symbolism of lines, figures, mask, or simple ring.
If you cannot take a class at a university
To learn different aspects of archeology,
A TAS Academy provides a unique opportunity.
I will take what I learned to Field School at Ochiltree.
Will we see you at the next academy in 2009 spring?

High Plains Archaeology: The 2009 Summer
Field School in the Texas Panhandle
Scott D. Brosowske
It’s December already and that means that the upcoming
TAS field school is only about six months away. While six
months may seem like a long way for most of you, when you
are preparing for one of the largest archaeological projects in
the world it is amazing how many things need to be taken care
of before the field school begins. For example, new equipment needs to be built and/or ordered, expendable equipment
and supplies (e.g., bags, sharpies, pencils, etc.) need to be
reordered, guest speakers need to be identified and invited to
the field school, qualified site P.I.’s and crew chiefs need to
be selected and convinced to spend their upcoming vacations
with us for no pay or reimbursement, old equipment needs to
be checked and repaired if necessary, field and lab manuals
need to be revised, caterers and bands need to be contacted
and booked, articles and lectures pertaining to the field school
need to be prepared, field and laboratory personnel performing
specialized analyses for the field project need to be identified
and contacted, budgets for field and lab portions of the project
need to be written and submitted, county commissioners need
to be met with and convinced to waive all camping fees for
participants of the field school, the tent pavilion needs to be
reserved, and as always, we have to devise new and creative
ways to come up with money to pay for everything that is not
covered by our limited budget. As a matter of fact, sitting down
at our lab here on Wolf Creek to write this article provides a
welcome break from one of our current projects: constructing
20 new shaker screens needed for site testing this summer.
Our plans for the upcoming field school once again include opportunities to excavate at several sites representing
a number of different time periods and cultural adaptations,
participate in pedestrian and metal detecting surveys, and
work in one of two labs. Needless to say, the field school
should once again have something for just about everyone.
The following provides a brief glimpse into our plans for the
upcoming field school at Perryton, Texas.
First of all, the three blocks that were opened last summer
at Chill Hill, a large Antelope Creek phase (A.D. 1250-1500)
village, still remain incomplete. Both Blocks A and B, ran by
Mark Latham and Tod Bevitt, encountered numerous cultural
features including shallow roasting pits, hearths, and at least
two house structures. While a few of these features were excavated at Block B during the final days of the field school, the
outlines of the vast majority of those identified last year were
simply mapped on level forms and await further investigation
this upcoming summer. As a result, the excavation of many

6

✦ Winter 2009

of these features will begin on the first day of the upcoming
field school.
Geophysical survey and test excavations indicate that
Block C at Chill Hill (Figure 1), the area where the youth
group worked last year, also contains a number of promising
features. Most notable is a large trash filled feature, probably
another house, which was encountered during test excavations. A total of 18, two-by-two meter excavation units were
eventually opened at Block C last summer to provide work
areas for the 40 Perryton kids that joined the TAS dig for three
days. Unfortunately, when these energetic youngsters left on
Wednesday, Doug Boyd’s crew was effectively decreased by
nearly 60%. Needless to say, there remains a lot of work ahead
of us at Block C in order to complete all of the units that were
opened last summer. On the brighter side, the high frequencies
of exotic trade items from New Mexico recovered from this
area suggest that some of the more exciting finds of the 2009
field school will likely come from Block C.

Figure 1. Participants from the Youth Program.
Another of the sites that we will be returning to is Evan’s
1868 military supply depot along Monument Creek. This fall a
small crew of volunteers under the direction of Tiffany Osburn
completed excavation of three of the two-by-two meter units
began last summer at the field school. A total of 10 m3 were
excavated in four days at one of the military dugouts in Area
A of the site. The large frequencies of artifacts recovered from
the floor of this feature indicate that this dugout was likely
abandoned prior to the abandonment of the site by the military
(i.e., they deposited trash in this abandoned dugout while the
site was still occupied). Artifacts recovered included military

and civilian buttons, unfired .50-70 cartridges, a butcher knife,
unfired .44 paper cartridges, .44 percussion caps, a tin cooking
vessel, a wooden military leather brush, a tin plate, a pocket
knife, and numerous square nails and tin cans (Figure 2).
Preserved grass adhering to the bottom side of artifacts lying
on the floor indicates that the floors of at least some of these
dugouts were lined with grass.

Figure 2. Select Artifacts from Dugout at Evan’s
Military Depot.
Excavations slated for 2009 include further work in the
above dugout and other areas at Area A and the opening of
new blocks at Area B. The latter is located across the creek
and southeast of Area A. Those who worked at Evan’s depot
last summer will be glad to hear that the cement-like clay
overburden at this site will be removed using heavy machinery
prior to the upcoming field season.
The third site that we are planning to return to this summer is Cross L. This site, as noted in the last newsletter, represents a Middle or Late Ceramic period encampment. Judging
from the large quantities of bison bone recovered at the site
last summer, bison hunting was a major activity conducted
from this site. The five, one-by-one meter units excavated last
summer will be expanded into a larger open block unit. This
unit will target a dense midden deposit on the eastern slope
of the site. This midden is shallowly buried at a depth of 10
to 70 cm. A water screen will be set-up this spring at Cross
L to facilitate artifact recovery.
As mentioned in the 2008 Winter Newsletter, we will also
be putting together a number of small crews to begin testing
at several small Antelope Creek phase settlements scattered
upstream from Chill Hill in the Dugout Creek valley. The
extent of testing at each site will depend largely on artifact
recovery rates (i.e., to obtain adequate sample sizes), but will
likely range between two and four, one-by-one meter units.
We are hoping that this work, combined with our investigations at Chill Hill, will provide insights into Antelope Creek
phase settlement strategies on a valley scale, as well as a better
understanding of the potential variability among settlements
in the organization of subsistence economies and the extent
of involvement in long-distance exchange networks.
The last site to be investigated next summer is 41RB118,
another Antelope Creek phase permanent habitation site.
This site along with several additional Antelope Creek phase
sites along a south flowing tributary to the Canadian River

are collectively referred to as the “Archie King Ruins” and
were first described by Warren K. Moorehead in 1921. This
site contains the remains of four residential house structures
whose wall foundations are outlined with local caliche stones.
Although unknown, the latter may represent an attempt to
protect the sandy house foundations from the effects of wind
erosion. Excavations at this site will target features immediately
outside one of the above house structures. Water will be piped to
the site from a nearby well in order to set-up a water screen.
This week Danny Witt and I have been busy working
with Andie Comini to identify and contact individuals for
educational demonstrations and evening programs. We are
once again planning to have flintknapping and pottery making demonstrations by Ed Day and Alvin Lynn. We have
also booked an excellent Indian dance troupe, known as the
Kwahadi Indian Dancers, for entertainment one evening at
camp (see Figure 3). Ken Weidner and his group of Plains
Indian re-enactors will set-up another historic tipi encampment near the TAS camp at Lake Fryer. Catered prime rib and
BBQ dinners will also be provided for the first Saturday and
last Friday evenings. Bands have also been booked for both
of these evenings and for the margarita party!

Figure 3. Kwahadi Indian Dancers.
As noted in the last newsletter, even though the field school
itself will only run from June 13th until June 20th, everyone is
welcome to stay longer as we will continue working in the field
and labs until June 30th to complete all of the work began by
TAS. For those willing to stay on longer with us, please contact us (sbrosowske@pphm.wtamu.edu or (806) 434-0175) so
that we can plan accordingly. Free camping will be provided
at Lake Fryer for everyone that elects to join us! All in all, we
are very excited to once again host the upcoming TAS summer
field school. We are looking forward to having everyone back
for what is sure to be another memorable field season. So until
then, we will get back to our shaker screen construction and all
of the other chores that need to be finished before June.

A Return to Ochiltree County
By Dempsey Malaney
Last year’s Field School was a big success and the
coming 2009 Field School promises to be even better. Mr.
Harold Courson and his family have invited TAS back for
a second year in the Texas Panhandle to finish up some
important Archeological investigations to be directed by
Dr. Scott Brosowske.
Again this year, Mr. Courson will treat attendees with
two catered dinners with live entertainment. The first will
be on Saturday, June 13, and then we will conclude the field
school on Friday, June 19th, with a dinner and entertainment
by a well known band. Please plan on staying Friday night
for this memorable dinner with special entertainment. For
the other days in camp, our outstanding field school cooks
will again be with us, serving up their excellent breakfasts
and dinners.
Dempsey Malaney will serve as camp boss this year
after getting initiated last year. Our campground will be
at picturesque Wolf Creek Park and Lake Fryer, in Ochiltree County about 15 miles from Perryton. Large elm and
cottonwood trees at the campsite promise an enjoyable
camping experience. Bath houses and restrooms will be
available nearby. There are also 54 RV hookups with water
and 30amp electricity on the south side of the park where
TAS will be located. There are no reservations, it will be
first come first served. We had no problems last year and
don’t anticipate any this year. Besides the camping, the
park and lake also offer fishing, swimming, boating, and
there are playgrounds as well as hiking and jogging trails.
Camping fees will be waived at the campground for both
the North and South side of the lake. Please note that the
park does not allow glass containers, so leave them at
home. We are also cautioned to bring a light jacket and
rain gear as it sometimes can get cool at night and wet if
it rains (makes for great sleeping). There is a small store at
Lake Fryer which will be convenient to participants. The
proprietor that was there last year has left and a new one
has not been appointed by the commissioners.
Weather in June can be at its best or its worst with occasional thunderstorms during this time of year. Last year
we had two storms. If you can bring a battery powered

weather radio from home it would be advisable to keep up
with the latest weather. A briefing about the weather will
be presented at the initial meeting in Camp.
We would like to bring your attention to the rule that
no pets of any kind will be allowed on the south side of
the lake in the TAS campground. For those that can’t be
without their pets, they will have to camp on the north
side of the lake. When visiting the campground and TAS
Headquarters you will have to leave your pets on the north
side. This will accommodate everyone and stay within the
TAS guidelines.
Perryton is only seven miles south of the Oklahoma
state line and it is the northernmost county seat in Texas.
It has one of the best small town museums within a 400
mile radius and is well worth visiting. There are several
motels in the city as well as some fine restaurants. Perryton
Chamber of Commerce may be contacted at 806-435-6575,
http://perryton.org/. The chamber will mail out packets
upon request and will be available at registration in the
camp. Additional details will be in the Spring TAS newsletter. And this year please remember to sign and send in the
Courson Family release form with your registration.

Dee Ann Story First Recipient of Newly
Created TAS Lifetime Achievement Award
Alan Skinner, Awards Committee Chair
On behalf of the Awards Committee, which consists of
Art Tawater, Shirley Green, and myself, it is my honor to present the following awards. I also want to thank the rest of the
committee for their help and for the help of the TAS Board.

Lifetime Achievement Award
The Executive Committee has concurred with the Awards
Committee’s recommendation that one additional award be
established to recognize TAS members lifetime commitment
to Texas archaeology. It is anticipated that this new award
will be presented as deemed appropriate by the TAS Board.
It is not intended to have a yearly recipient. This award is
to be known as the Texas Archeological Society, Lifetime
Achievement Award, and is to be presented to a TAS member
in recognition of his or her lifetime involvement in TAS and
Texas Archeology.
Have there been others in the past who might have received this award? Yes, absolutely. Such people include the
founder of the Society the late Cyrus Ray and as such Ray’s
commitment is represented by each of us here at this annual
meeting, also by the Bulletin, Newsletter, Field School,
Archeology Academy, and our Public Forum. Ray’s involvement was epitomized by the presentation of the Cyrus Ray
Award to the late E. Mott Davis in recognition of his long
term involvement with the Society. The names of others may
come to mind based on your own experiences but Cyrus Ray
and Mott Davis set a high bar against which to measure this
new award.
The recipient of this first Lifetime Achievement Award
is Dr. Dee Ann Story whom many of us know personally as
a mentor of numerous students, avocational archeologists,
professional archeologists, and the general public. Dr. Story
received her BA and MA degrees at The University of Texas
in Austin and her PhD at UCLA. The original Handbook of
Texas Archeology, of which she is the senior author, was an
outgrowth of an undergraduate term paper she wrote. After
joining the Texas Memorial Museum, she was one of several
UT professors instrumental in the establishment of the Texas
Archeological Research Laboratory. Archeologically, she is
best known because of her more than a decade’s involvement
at the George C. Davis site in Cherokee County where her
students and others continue to carry out research at Caddoan
Mounds State Historic Site. I would say that more practicing
archeologists who trained at UT in the past half century

received their appreciation of “DIRT” from Dee Ann than
from any other UT professor and these people are to be found
scattered all over the country and are respected archeologists
on their own rights. Her personal writing, as well as the
research she stimulated, is nationally respected. Besides
working individually with TAS members for many years, she
is a past president of TAS and a Fellow of the Society.
Although not at the Annual Meeting because she is currently recuperating at home from ongoing treatment at MD
Anderson Hospital in Houston, it will be my honor to present
this plaque to Dee Ann in recognition of her lifetime commitment to Texas Archeology.

TAS Fellow
Joan Few deserves recognition of her many contributions
to the TAS and to Texas archeology. She has been a TAS
member for 28 years and during that time has served TAS as
President and as PI for two TAS Field Schools.
Always a role model for many, Joan’s continuing commitment to bringing others into the leadership of TAS remains
ongoing. The thing that sets Joan apart from most is how she
encourages others to be part of TAS and Texas archeology. She
finds opportunities for students and the community to work

with her. Many of her writings include students and community members’ contributions. While teaching, she found ways
for her students to participate in TAS Field Schools and receive
course credit. She encouraged them to participate in field work
and writing of reports. She actively encouraged students to be
come part of TAS.
Historic archeology in southeast Texas took on new
meaning as Joan brought regional plantations to the forefront
in the 1980s and 90s. Her early work in Jasper County showed
how a small and unlikely site could yield information. The
work at Lake Jackson was a multi-year project that resulted in
a SAL, a public symposium, a video, Raisin Cane, and a book,
Sugar, Planters, Slaves, and Convicts. Joan’s supervision of
two TAS field schools as the PI demonstrated the experience
and knowledge she gained over the years.
Joan instilled in all of her students and many TAS members, a love of archeology and its associated history, the ethics
of her chosen profession, and the need for meticulous field
work and documentation. As past president of the Houston
and Texas Archeological Societies, as an educator, a professional archeologist and author, we now honor Joan Few as a
TAS Fellow.

The Texas Biface Award has been presented to Bill
Birmingham for his continued efforts to donate, conserve,
record, and preserve the archeological resources of Victoria
County.
C.K. Chandler Award For the third year in a row, David
Calame has recorded the most archeological sites of any other
TAS member, a total of 24 for 2008. More importantly, David
mentors and trains others to do what he does so well.
Golden Pen Award goes to Mark Walters, who has done
an outstanding job of his dedication to East Texas archeology through his contributions to the literature of the area
as well as the organization of the East Texas Archeological
Conference.
Francis Stickney Field School Awards honored May
Schmidt and Glynn Osburn. May has served on the Field
School Committee and coordinated many details involved
with providing meals for Field School attendees. She has also
served as lab director at Field School. Glynn has for years
played a very active role in the planning, organization, and
implementation of many TAS Field Schools. He works hard to
make each field school an educational experience that opens
doors to the archeological community.

TAS Dues Rise to Cover Society Expenses
Pat Mercado-Allinger, Budget Committee
The arrival of the New Year means that it is time once
again to pay your membership dues. Whether you pay by
check or electronically, via the TAS website you will notice
that dues for individuals, families, students and institutions have been raised. These increases were approved at
the October 2008 board meeting in order to cover basic
membership costs.
It should come as no surprise to everyone that everything
costs more. What may be surprising is that income from
membership dues has not adequately covered basic membership costs for several years. In fact, it was acknowledged that
the most recent dues raise would not fully cover membership
costs at that time. The cost of printing and mailing of the annual bulletin and quarterly newsletters as well as expenses
related to the TAS website, committees, and TAS office and
staff came to slightly over $57.00 per member in 2008. Since
the vast majority of TAS members join at the individual rate,
each $40.00 member represents a shortfall of about $17.00.
When this is multiplied by the number of individual members, the deficit comes to more than $23,000!
This all came to a head when my fellow budget committee members and I attempted to craft a balanced budget for

2009. We worked hard, in consultation with the Executive
Committee, to accomplish this task. Furthermore, income
from our investments not only did not materialize, they realized a substantial reduction this year. In addition to trimming
costs where possible, it was determined that it is necessary
to raise dues. The approved changes are as follows:
• Individual: $60.00
• Family: $70.00
• Student: $40.00
• Association: $55.00
• Institution: $100.00
• Contributing, Supporting, Patron and Business
categories remain the same.

These dues rates should be able to carry us through
several more years, especially if additional adjustments
are made to expenses and other income, such as profits
from Society activities. An ad hoc committee has been
appointed by President Grant Hall to critically examine
Society expenses and income and develop recommendations for board consideration.

Proposed Changes to Archeology Report Distribution
Procedures: Report on the October 2008 Antiquities
Advisory Board Meeting
Douglas K. Boyd, TAS Representative to the AAB
As is often the case with Antiquities Advisory Board
meetings, most of the business at the October 30, 2008 AAB
meeting was rather mundane. However, one topic that was
discussed could have a direct impact on TAS members across
the state. One of the last items on the agenda was “Discussion of possible amendments of Title 13, Part II, Chapter 26,
Practice and Procedures, Section 26.4, related to Reports
Relating to Archeological Permits.” The Texas Historical
Commission announced that it was considering alternative
ways of distributing archeological reports that are submitted
to the agency for Antiquities Permitted projects. As stipulated
in Section 26.4, the current policy for antiquities permitted
projects requires archeological contractors to submit 20 hard
copies to the THC. In keeping with the THC policy of protecting sites by not giving away site locations, only one of those
copies can have detailed maps showing site locations, while
the other 19 do not. The THC keeps the copy with site locations and then distributes those reports without site locations
to a list of archeological data repositories and libraries around
the state (see attached list). The THC also requires, for State
and Federal projects, that contractors submit an electronic version (a Tagged pdf file) of the report with site locations. This
version is made available on the Texas Archeological Sites
Atlas, which is a restricted database maintained by the THC.
Archeological contractors have to submit an application and
be approved by the THC before accessing data.
The THC is considering changing the report distribution
by doing away with the hard copies that are mailed out across
the state and making report copies only available online. One
of the primary reasons that they are considering this change
is the large expense and staff time involved in the process of
gathering and mailing out 19 copies of hundreds of reports.
At this time, the THC is considering requiring only one hard
copy (unbound, with site locations) that would go in the THC
library and an electronic copy submitted on a CD or DVD.
The latter would be restricted access only and would be available online to approved archeological researchers through the
Texas Archeological Sites Atlas. The THC also is considering
requiring submittal of a second electronic version that has
no site locations, so that each report could be made available
online to the general public.
Please note that these rules and proposed changes
technically apply only to reports generated under state

16

✦ Winter 2009

Antiquities Permit projects, but almost all contractors also
send copies of reports done only under federal laws to the
THC. Consequently, about 99% of the State and Federal
cultural resource management projects completed in past
two years will be available through the online Texas Archeological Sites Atlas database. But remember that THC
only started requiring electronic copies of reports two years
ago, and many thousands of older reports are not available
online through the Texas Archeological Sites Atlas. There
currently are no plans or provisions for going back to scan
all of the hard copies of older reports to make digital copies
available online. This would, of course, be a significant and
costly undertaking.
Just prior to the AAB meeting in October, the THC sent
out an email to all archeological contractors around the state
asking everyone to send them their opinions on this matter.
Many people have responded, but their emails generally
reflect only the views of the professional archeological community. I believe that the THC needs to hear from the rest of
the archeological community to get the full range of views
on this subject. They need to hear your thoughts regarding
these issues—specifically, paper vs. electronic and restricted
vs. public access. Feel free to express any ideas you wish,
but be sure to address the following questions: (1) Do you
use the archeological reports in the repositories and libraries
and is it important to continue sending report copies around
the state? (2) Would you access and read archeological reports online if they were made available to the public via the
internet? Please be aware that regardless of how reports are
distributed there are real-world cost implications, especially
the cost of THC staff time and the cost of maintaining online
databases. As most publicly-funded agencies must do nowa-days, the THC must look at this issue from a cost-benefit
standpoint, and your views will be an important part of their
decision making.
This proposed rule change is still in the early discussion
stage, and no changes are imminent. But now is the time to
express your opinion if you want to be heard. Please send your
thoughts to Mark Denton, Archeology Division, Texas Historical Commission, via email (Mark.Denton@thc.state.tx.us)
or regular mail Mark Denton, THC Archeology Division, P.

Treasures of La Belle Unveiled in New Online Exhibit
Texas Beyond History has unveiled a major new online
exhibit on the Belle Shipwreck, www.texasbeyondhistory.
net/belle/index.html, presenting fascinating new findings to
the public about this significant site. With many interactive
features, bells and whistles, this vividly illustrated, 9-section exhibit allows viewers to “explore” the 17th-century
shipwreck of the French explorer La Salle, go behind the
scenes in the Texas A&M Conservation Research Laboratory to learn about “excavating” concretions, and discover
what was inside the perplexing “Mystery Chest,” (possibly
the personal trunk of La Salle himself!). Treasures of La
Belle showcases prime examples of the nearly one million
artifacts recovered from the shipwreck and provides an
opportunity to learn more about the skeletal remains of the
French sailor recovered from the wreck.
Dr. Dirt, the Armadillo Archeologist, leads an investigation into this matter in Death Onboard La Belle! Clues
from the Bones, a new science interactive combining skeletal biology with history. The activity is accompanied by
a correlated lesson for 4th-8th grade students. Expansion
of TBH’s companion exhibit on Fort St. Louis, the site
of La Salle’s small French colony in Victoria County, is
underway and will provide a larger historical context for
understanding the explorer’s journeys in the New World.
The new Belle exhibit was developed by TBH editor
The Treasures of La Belle section is one of several interactive
sections in which the ship’s cargo can be explored.

A Radiocarbon Date from a Cedar Pole in a Special Caddo
Burial Feature at the Shelby Mound site (41CP71)
Timothy K. Perttula
The Texas Archeological Research Laboratory at The
University of Texas at Austin (TARL) has in their collections 4-5 ft. sections of a cedar pole recovered from a burial
feature at 41CP71, the Shelby Mound site, on Greasy Creek
in Camp County, Texas. This cedar pole, one of two found in
the burial feature, was recovered by looters (see Perttula and
Nelson 2004:6) from a burial (Burial 117) in a large cemetery
at the site (Mitchell 2000). The looter that dug these materials
up is now deceased and his collections have been sold and
dispersed, except apparently one of the cedar poles. Before
his death, he donated this pole to TARL.
From what we know about the Shelby Mound site, it is
one of the more important Late Caddo (ca. A.D. 1400-1680)
Titus phase archeological sites in all of East Texas because of
its large and well-preserved settlement with abundant habitation features as well as plant and animal remains, evidence of
mound building activities, and a large community cemetery
with at least 119 burial pits (Figure 1) and perhaps as many
as 200. The Shelby Mound site is the nexus of one of a number of Titus phase political communities in the Big Cypress
Creek stream basin. However, we still known very little about
much of the site—or the history of the Caddo’s settlement
there—since almost all the work done at the site since it was
discovered in 1979 has been by looters. Perttula and Nelson
(2004:21-44) completed a limited amount of work in the village area in 2003, and Bob Turner and others worked in the
1.5 m high structural mound between 1985-1988 (see Perttula and Nelson 2004:13-20), but nothing has been done by
professional archeologists in the area of the looted cemetery
because of the amount of looting damage.
The Caddo individual buried with the cedar poles appears
to have been a socially important person, since the cedar poles
(originally 9 ft. in length) were part of a wood litter upon which
Burial 117 would have rested; the poles were found along each
side of the individual placed in this burial (see Mitchell 2000).
No other Caddo litter burials are known from East Texas mortuary contexts, which certainly points to the social significance
of this Caddo individual, although a number of cedar pole litter
burials from individuals with a “superior social standing” (accompanied by a truly unique assortment of grave goods) have
been documented in 14th century A.D. burials in the Special
Mortuary of the Craig Mound at the Spiro site in the Arkansas
River valley in eastern Oklahoma (Brown 1996:85-103).
At death, this individual at the Shelby Mound site,
probably an adult male, was accompanied by a number of

20

✦ Winter 2009

decorated pottery vessels—two large brushed ollas, a Bailey
Engraved bottle, a probable Wilder Engraved bottle, one red,
yellow, and tan bowl, and sherds from an unknown number of
crushed vessels—as well as more than 20 expertly knapped
Talco arrow points (Mitchell 2000). This person appears to
have then been buried on the cedar pole litter in a tomb placed
below the floor of a structure, after which the structure was
burned, capping the tomb (Perttula 2005:382), and leaving
a large deposit of daub apparently overlying the burial. A
radiocarbon date on the cedar pole curated at TARL would
allow us to determine when these events took place, which
were probably pivotal in the history of this particular Caddo
community.
In an attempt to learn more about the history of the Caddo
settlement at the Shelby Mound site, I requested, and received,
permission from TARL and the Caddo Nation of Oklahoma
in the spring of 2008 to submit a small sample (ca. 10-15 g)
of the outer part (and thus to date when the pole was cut) of
one of the cedar pole sections from Burial 117 for radiocarbon
analysis by Beta Analytic, Inc. The standard radiocarbon analysis has produced a conventional radiocarbon age of 380 ± 50
B.P. (Beta-244934) on the cedar pole (13C/12C ratio of -25.4
‰). At 1 sigma (68% probability), the calibrated radiocarbon
age ranges of the litter pole, using the IntCal04 radiocarbon
age calibration (Reimer et al. 2004), are AD 1450-1520 and
AD 1580-1630. The 2 sigma (95% probability) calibrated
age range is AD 1430-1640, and the calibrated radiocarbon
intercept is AD 1470.
The calibrated radiocarbon age range of the Feature 117
cedar pole is apparently contemporaneous with the construction of the earthen mound at the Shelby Mound site (and the
use and then burning of at least one structure in the mound
between A.D. 1420-1490) as well as Titus phase village deposits on a natural levee abut 50 m south of the mound itself
(Perttula and Nelson 2004:Appendix IV). Relevant 2 sigma
calibrated radiocarbon ages from the mound deposits are AD
1425-1650 (calibrated intercept of AD 1490) and AD 13051460 (calibrated intercept of AD 1420). Calibrated 2 sigma
radiocarbon ages from village area structural features are AD
1315-1455 (calibrated intercept of AD 1420), AD 1440-1650
(calibrated intercepts of AD 1510, 1595, and 1615), and AD
1420-1530 and AD 1545-1635 (calibrated intercept of AD
1455). At 2 sigma, all the Shelby Mound calibrated radiocarbon ages have a mean calibrated age range of AD 1389-1582
and a mean calibrated intercept of AD 1471.

Considered in context with the radiocarbon
dates from mound and habitation features, the
Feature 117 burial litter at the Shelby mound
site may well have been interred in the large
community cemetery in the latter part of
the 15th and the first part of the 16th century
A.D., perhaps during its early use. The 2
sigma calibrated age range of the Feature 117
cedar pole and the associated Talco arrow
points also indicates (or does not rule out the
possibility) that the burial litter may date as
late as the early 17th century. Seriation analysis
of ceramic vessels and arrow point styles
from Titus phase burials and cemetery sites
suggests that the large community cemeteries
date after the early 16th century and were in
use until at least the early to mid-17th century
(Perttula 2005:387-388). The preponderance
of archeological evidence from the Shelby
Mound site and 13 known community
cemeteries in the Big Cypress Creek basin,
in conjunction with the 2 sigma calibrated
radiocarbon age range from the Feature 117
litter burial itself, point to the unique burial on
a cedar pole litter of a socially superior Caddo
individual in a ranked Titus phase political
community sometime after the early part of
the 16th century A.D.

TAS Offers Teacher Credits
Robin Matthews, Education Committee Chairman
Texas teachers can earn “continuing professional
education” credit hours by attending many of the functions that TAS offers. Field School, the Academies, Annual
Meeting, rock art recording sessions, special projects by
local units, excavation activities, as well as presentations
by noted archeologists, are all possibilities for teachers
receiving credit hours.
Several free workshops will be offered for credit on
the shipwreck, La Belle. These will be Jan. 29 at UTSACAR “Exploring Archeology in Your Classroom: The
Excavation of La Salle’s Ship,” contact Lynn.Yakubik@
utsa.edu and Feb. 28 at the San Antonio Conservation
Society, “Teaching Discovery and Exploration with La
Salle in Texas,” contact www.saconservation.org/events
or albertv3@swbell.net
Texas law requires teachers to earn 150 hours in CPE
credits every five years. Included in this total are six hours
of credit for teaching Gifted & Talented students. TAS is
an state approved provider of CPE credit (#500674) and
this is important in attracting teachers to become TAS
members. This number needs to be on any certificate given
to teachers.
The Education Committee has been able to increase
awareness of TAS by providing opportunities for teacher
credit hours. In this past year TAS has worked with the

Travis County Archeological Society, Shumla, The Rock
Art Foundation, and the Center for Big Bend Studies to
provide credit hours. Special certificates were designed
by Robin Matthews, chairman of the Committee, for each
program or activity and given to the teachers. It is then the
responsibility of the teacher to turn these in to their school
district to document the credit hours.
If your local archeology association is having a special
program, speaker, excavation or survey activity, it is easy
to get teachers involved by contacting the school districts
close to the activity site. In a small district, contact the principals of the elementary, middle and high school with the
information about your activity. In a large school district, it
is best to contact the administration office and ask to speak
to the social studies and science curriculum coordinator.
It is to your advantage to meet in person with the district
contact and take an agenda of the activity and pictures of
previous activities so that that district administrators can
have a better feel for what TAS and your local association
are all about.
For more detailed information on how to contact
schools or Region Education Service Centers, or for
sample certificates, please email Robin at: ann-robin@
sbcglobal.net
