Introduction
Timothy K. Perttula

This volume contains five separate articles that
present the archeological findings from four different Texas Archeological Society Field Schools held
in different parts of the state in 1977, 1991-1992,
and 1999. The Texas Archeological Society has conducted an annual and very successful Field School
since 1963, beginning at the Oblate site in Comal
County, Texas, at various sites and locales across the
state (see Richmond et al. 1985 for a history of the
1962-1982 Field Schools), as well as a “group dig”
in the summer of 1962 at the Gilbert site in Rains
County, Texas (Jelks 1967:iii). These Field Schools
have obtained significant archeological information
about the prehistory and history of Texas and its earlier inhabitants, and each new field school provides
the opportunity for grizzled veterans and newcomers
to work together to explore Texas’ past. In recent
years, the field schools have been an annual host to
at least 300-400 participants.
It has sometimes been a struggle, because of
the massive amounts of archeological information (features, artifacts, records, photographs, etc.)
recovered from each field school, to complete the
timely reporting and publication of the archeological
findings. Without a final report, it is hard to gauge
the ultimate success of the field school endeavors.
It is crucial that the archeological discoveries and
archeological materials recovered during each field
school receive the analysis, publication, and dissemination of a final report so that members of the
Society and others interested in the archeology of
the state learn of the results.
Attesting to the concerted efforts of the society,
the results of many past Texas Archeological Society
Field Schools held across the state have been
published in the Bulletin of the Texas Archeological
Society and Special Publications of the society,
as well as in other venues. Work accomplished at
prehistoric and historic Indian sites includes: an
Historic Wichita Indian site in Limestone County
(Smith 1993); prehistoric Caddo mound, village,
cemetery, and salt-making sites (Corbin and Hart

1998; Perttula et al. 2001; Turner and Smith 2002);
an Archaic and Late Prehistoric habitation site on
the Brazos River (Wright 1997); prehistoric shell
middens in Southeast Texas (Aten and Bollich 2002;
Few et al. 1999, 2002); burned rock middens in
Central Texas (Houk and Lohse 1993; Mueggenborg
1994; Baker 2003); broad-scale surveys in Edwards
Plateau Canyonlands as well as the investigation of
hot rock features (Moore 1983; Dickens and Moore
2004); the Lubbock Lake Landmark site (Johnson
et al. 2002) and other locales on the Southern High
Plains (Litwinionek et al. 1997; Baxevanis et al.
1997); habitation sites in the Texas Panhandle
(Couzzourt and Schmidt-Couzzourt 1996; Word
1991), including Wolf Creek (Hughes 1991); a
technological analysis of lithic assemblages from
the 1970 Field School in the Guadalupe Mountains
(Boisvert 1985) as well as ceramics (Phelps 1974)
and rock art (Clark 1974); burned rock middens
and a rock shelter in Crockett County (Word 1971);
archeological survey and rock art recordation at
Devils River State Natural Area in the lower Pecos
region (Turpin and Davis 1993); and detailed
investigations of hearths and middens in the TransPecos (Cason 2005).
Historic archeological investigations have also
been an important part of Field School research,
and a diverse range of sites have been investigated
by the society and the results published. Among
these are 18th century Spanish Colonial missions
and presidios (Fox and Tomka 2006; Walter et al.
2005a, 2005b; Walter 1999, 2007; Wolf 2005),
acequias (Rinker et al. 1999), 19th century sugar
plantations (Few 1999), and the Thomas F. McKinney homestead and mill complex in Travis County
(McEachern and Ralph 1980, 1981).
The Texas Archeological Society is committed
to the publication of a final report on each field
school, no matter how long it may take, and the
Special Publication before you (and on CD) is one
result of that commitment. The Society has made,
and will continue to make, a concerted effort to

insure that final reports of the field schools are done
in a timely manner.
The Texas Archeological Society is especially
grateful to The Summerfield G. Roberts Foundation
for providing the funding to publish this special
publication of field school reports.
As editor of this Special Publication, I would
like to first acknowledge the hard work and dedication of all the authors that have contributed to
this publication, several years in the making. The
Reports and Curation Committee of the Texas Archeological Society, led by Ron Ralph, has provided
yeoman service in finding authors to complete the
analysis and write-up of past field schools. Finally,
the Board of Directors and Executive Committee
of the Texas Archeological Society, as well as Pam
Wheat, Executive Director, have been fully supportive of this project from its first beginnings. She also
provided useful comments on an earlier version of
this Foreword.

Prehistoric Land Use at Amistad National
Recreation Area, Val Verde County, Texas:
Report on the Texas Archeological Society
1999 Field School

Jack G. Johnson and Angel Stuewe Johnson

ABSTRACT
Low water levels in the Amistad reservoir during the summer of 1999 allowed access to many sites that
are typically inundated. The National Park Service and the Texas Archeological Society teamed up, taking
advantage of this situation, to document and record as many new sites within the park as possible and to
relocate and assess impacts to known sites. Work performed included surface survey and collection, excavation at selected sites, and rock art recording. Of the sites examined, 41VV661 with its Late Prehistoric
ceramics, and the expansive hearth field of 41VV1207, proved most significant and accordingly receive the
most attention in this article. We report on the procedures and findings of the 1999 Field School investigations and integrate that information into a broader look at land use patterns across the area now encompassed
by Amistad National Recreation Area.

PROJECT OVERVIEW
Amistad National Recreation Area (ANRA)
is located at the heart of the Lower Pecos archeological region, encompassing the lower parts of
the Pecos and Devils rivers where they flow into
the Rio Grande west of Del Rio in Val Verde
County, Texas (Figure 1). The 1969 completion of
Amistad Dam impounded these three waterways,
and land up to the top of the dam (1144.3 feet
above mean sea level) was condemned, ultimately
becoming the ANRA.
Unusually low water levels in the reservoir
during 1998-1999 exposed many sites, some
previously known and others undiscovered, in
areas of ANRA that are normally submerged. The
value of this opportunity to document archeological sites within ANRA was not lost on either
the National Park Service (NPS) or the Texas
Archeological Society (TAS), and the 1999 TAS
field school was planned accordingly.
By bringing the manpower of a TAS field
school to bear on archeological investigations

at ANRA, a variety of research goals could be
pursued simultaneously. Thus, not only was new
information generated about the area’s prehistory,
helping the NPS to better manage its archeological
sites and cultural resources, but field school participants received experience in a range of different
kinds of investigations in a diversity of settings.
Research efforts were organized into 19 different
operations, each corresponding to a different geographic area and having specific combinations of
research objectives. These included survey to document new sites, relocating known sites to perform
condition assessments, documentation of exposed
features and rock art, and excavations at selected
sites of particular importance or at immediate risk
of being lost to erosion.
This article draws upon the site forms, excavation records, daily journals, and other records
of the 1999 fieldwork, as well as the authors’ own
analysis of artifacts from the field school presently curated at the Texas Archeological Research
Laboratory at The University of Texas at Austin
(TARL).

in January and from 23.4-37.3 C in July (U.S. Department of Agriculture, Soil Conservation Service
[USDA, SCS] 1982:2 and Table 1).

PALEOENVIRONMENT AND
CULTURE HISTORY
Paleoindian occupation of the area presumably began as early as 12,000 or 14,000 years ago
when the climate was relatively cool and moist.
Paleoindian peoples hunted large, now extinct,
megafauna across this landscape, as evidenced
at Cueva Quebrada (Lundelius 1984) and suggested in Bonebed 1 at Bonfire Shelter (Bement
1986). A single Clovis point is reported for Val
Verde County (Greer 1968; Meltzer and Bever
1995) near a midden circle site 60 km north of
Comstock. Another Clovis point was recorded
just across the border in Mexico by Gonzalez Rul
from “a small burned rock midden on the south
side of the Rio Grande just above Ciudad Acuna,
Coahuila” (Greer 1968:184).
Clear and dramatic evidence of a later Paleoindian presence in the region comes from
Bonfire Shelter’s Bonebed 2, where Folsom and
Plainview projectile points were found associated
with bones of extinct Bison antiquus (Dibble and
Lorrain 1968). These deposits have long been regarded as evidence of the oldest and southernmost
buffalo jump site in North America, although Byerly et al. (2005) suggests the bison may have merely
been processed there. Later Paleoindian projectile
points such as Angostura have been found at sites
throughout the region.
Decreasing pine pollen in the region (Bryant
and Holloway 1985) and the disappearance of
buffalo from archeological deposits after 10,000
B.P. document an overall drying trend throughout the Holocene (Dering 2002). Early Archaic
people began exploiting a wider variety of loweryield resources, and earth oven cooking allowed
otherwise inedible desert succulents to achieve a
dietary prominence (Dering 1999). Rock shelters
were used extensively, and their interior space
was divided according to activity areas (Turpin
1995). The dead were buried in caves and sinkholes

such as Seminole Sink (Turpin 1988), and artistic
expression appears in clay figurines and painted
pebbles (Turpin 1995).
Desert conditions peaked around 5000 years ago
at the beginning of the Middle Archaic, evidenced by
significant flooding episodes at Black Cave (Turpin
1982). Populations tended to concentrate near rivers (Turpin 1995) and low-yield plant resources like
lechugilla and sotol become increasingly important
(Brown 1991). Large, multi-colored, shamanic Pecos River Style pictographs appear throughout the
region, and may represent increased ritual activity,
perhaps as a cultural response to the desertification
of the region (Turpin 1995).
The Late Archaic period began with an abrupt
but surely welcome transition to a cooler and more
mesic climate around 3000 years ago (Turpin
1995). Grass and pine pollen increased (Bryant
and Holloway 1985) and buffalo from several sites
indicated their return to the area from the Southern
Plains, consequently drawing attendant hunters
bearing intrusive styles of projectile points (Turpin
1995). Their interactions with the indigenous
population are unclear, but the Pecos River Style
rock art does not continue into the Late Archaic.
Settlement patterns de-emphasize rock-shelters in
favor of open terrace sites. The small, vivacious red
stick figures of the Red Linear rock art style may
appear at this time or (perhaps more likely) at the
end of the Late Archaic period (Turpin 1995).
The grasslands and buffalo herds retreated
north and arid conditions returned by around 2000
B.P., after which the drying trend in the region
continued (Bryant and Holloway 1985). The appearance of the Shumla dart point style suggests
that people from northern Mexico expanded into
the area when the buffalo hunters left, as apparently
did people from Central Texas bearing Ensor and
Frio dart points (Turpin 1995:549).
The beginning of the Late Prehistoric period
(Flecha subperiod) around 1300 B.P. was heralded
not with any major climatic changes but with the
appearance of the bow and arrow (Turpin 1995)
and other cultural changes. These included changes
in mortuary customs and the appearance of a fully
developed rock art style, the Red Monochrome
(Turpin 1995). This style of rock art depicted
people armed with bows and arrows as well
as depictions of important fauna such as deer,
turkey, rabbit, and catfish (as at 41VV78). Red
Monochrome sites are often located near springs
(Turpin 1995). Another rock art style that appears

4

Texas Archeological Society

is the Bold Line geometric, a style that Turpin
(1995) associates with the Desert Abstract styles
seen in the American Southwest and northern
Mexico, hinting at possible origins for the period’s
new cultural characteristics. Another distinctive
aspect of the Late Prehistoric archeological record
is the ring midden, a thermal feature produced from
processing desert succulents in pit ovens (Turpin
1995:550).
The later Infierno phase (ca. 450-250 B.P) of
the Late Prehistoric period is marked by tipi rings,
and a distinctive artifact assemblage that includes
small stemmed arrow points, ceramics, steeply
beveled end and end-side scrapers, and beveled
knives. This assemblage is similar in many respects
to that noted in Toyah phase sites in Central Texas
but is associated in the Lower Pecos with tipi rings
and not with the phase’s characteristic Perdiz style
arrow points. These people of the Infierno phase
seem to have preferred promontories overlooking
springs or permanent waterholes for their settlements (Turpin 1995:552). The appearance of these
sites in the region corresponds with the return
of more mesic conditions and the return of the
buffalo, and they may represent seasonal buffalo
hunts by intrusive groups from the plains, possibly
historically documented groups such as the Apache
(Turpin 1995; Kenmotsu and Wade 2002; Wade
2003). Plains Indian style pictographs appear in
some rock shelters (Turpin 1995:552).
The Historic period in the Lower Pecos begins
in 1535 when the shipwrecked Spanish explorer
Cabeza de Vaca and his companions entered the region and recorded their experiences. Later Spanish
expeditions included Coronado in 1540, De SotoMoscoso in 1542-1543, Chamuscado-Rodriguez
in 1581-1582, Espejo-Luxan in 1582-1583, and
Castano de Sosa in 1590 (Kenmotsu and Wade
2002). Rock art dating to this period contains
images of missions, Spaniards, longhorn cattle,
and cowboys. This period saw the replacement
of local groups by the Apaches by 1729 (Weddle
1968:200), who then gave way to the Comanche
(Turpin 1995). Accordingly, site locations shift
from deep canyons to open areas near accessible
water sources, probably relating to the needs of
the horses now in use (Turpin 1995:554). Under
ever-increasing pressure from the U.S. Army, even
these fierce Plains warriors had disappeared by the
early 1880s when the Southern Pacific railroad
opened the region to Anglo-American settlement
(Turpin 1995:554).

Previous Archeological investigations
in the Lower Pecos Region
While much of our knowledge of the region’s
archeology has come from the survey and salvage
work done prior to the completion of Amistad Dam,
the outstanding organic preservation and vibrant
rock art of rock shelters in the Lower Pecos attracted
archeologists as early as the 1930s. Excavations of
prominent rock shelters were sponsored by museums, including the Smithsonian Institution, the
Witte, and the University of Texas, at notable sites
such as Fate Bell, Shumla Caves, and Eagle’s Nest.
Rock art recording began during this time as well,
with efforts by A. T. Jackson and Forrest Kirkland.
The next wave of archeological research began
in the late 1950s and was related to the impending
construction of the Amistad reservoir. This necessitated several large-scale survey, testing, and excavation projects. Although many types of sites were
documented, excavations focused on significant
rock shelters like Bonfire Shelter (Dibble and Lorrain 1968) and large, deeply stratified terrace sites
such as the Devil’s Mouth site (Johnson 1964) and
Arenosa Shelter (Dibble 1967).
Paleoenvironmental studies also began in the
mid-1960s and proved the research value of the
perishable materials found in Lower Pecos rock
shelters. Subsequent studies have examined the relationships between the ancient people of the region
and their environment, such as reconstructions of
diet and nutrition (Bryant 1974; Sobolik 1996) and
the economics of subsistence (Dering 1999, 2005).
The creation of Seminole Canyon State Park
by the Texas Parks and Wildlife Department initiated a flurry of survey and research in the 1980s.
Beyond cataloging the park’s cultural resources
(Turpin 1982), much of this work focused on mortuary practices (Turpin et al. 1986; Turpin 1988)
and rock art (Turpin 1984, 1986a, 1986b). Rock art
research has remained an active area of study into
the present, with continuing documentation of sites
as well as advances in dating (Chaffee et al. 1993,
1994; Hyman and Rowe 1997; Ilger et al. 1995;
Russ et al. 1990), and meaning (Turpin 1990, 1994;
Boyd 1996, 1998, 2003).
The 1999 TAS field school provided an opportunity to examine smaller and previously overlooked
archeological sites as well as sites that did not receive much earlier attention because of the rush to
document the larger and more complex ones before
the reservoir was built. A summary of this work then

Johnson and Johnson—Prehistoric Land Use at Amistad National Recreation Area 5
should help to provide a more detailed and balanced
view of the overall character of prehistoric and historic land use patterns within the region.

OBJECTIVES OF FIELD SCHOOL
The purpose of this field school was two-fold:
to “make a significant contribution toward archeological site management in the recreation area as
well as to select research topics in the region’s
prehistory” (Collins et al. 1999:1). The particular
research topic selected for investigation was gaining a better understanding of Late Prehistoric open
sites with wikiup stone rings and ceramics.
Towards this end, six broad categories of
objectives for the investigation were laid out in
the Manual for TAS Field School Amistad National
Recreation Area, Val Verde County, Texas June
12-19 (Collins et al. 1999:2-7). These objectives
were “designed to gather new data on the prehistory of ANRA, assist NPS staff in managing the
archeological resources, and offer the participants
opportunities to learn new skills and practice old
ones” (Collins et al. 1999:2). Briefly, these objectives were: (1) survey for new sites; (2) relocate
previously recorded sites, assess their condition,
and update the records; (3) document exposed
features in detail at selected sites; (4) detailed recording of rock art; (5) test excavations at selected
sites; and (6) more intensive excavations of burned
rock features that might soon be lost to erosion.
The park was divided into 19 geographic areas
or “Operations,” each with a specific set of research
objectives. These will be discussed individually in
greater detail below.

FIELD METHODS OF THE TAS
FIELD SCHOOL
Field methods and procedures are outlined
here as prescribed in Collins et al. (1999:7-28).
Objectives, conditions, and procedures varied for
each operation, but several general procedures
were applied to all Operations.
Teams were organized and directed by a crew
chief. Relatively autonomous teams, sometimes
working in isolation, relied on their crew chief
to insure all equipment, records, and supplies
were available for the work day, as well as a
working cell phone and weather radio (especially

those teams traveling by boat). Crew chiefs were
also responsible for keeping a daily journal and
maintaining other basic documentary records of the
team, or delegating these tasks to a detail-oriented
team member. Basic forms used were appended in
the Manual (Collins et al. 1999).
The primary objectives of the field school
were to record and document sites, features, and
the nature of observed archeological materials.
The general policy for field activities other than
excavations was not to collect artifacts, but merely
to document them unless deemed by the team to be
of unusual importance or likely to be looted.
Both official trinomial and temporary (if a
site was to be newly recorded) site numbers were
employed by the field school and all data were
required to be keyed to these site numbers. Crew
chiefs were responsible for careful assignment of
temporary numbers, which consisted of the crew
chief’s name followed by a numeric series beginning with 1 (i.e., Calhoun-1, Calhoun-2). For each
temporary number, a site form and accurate plot of
the site on a map was required, as well as a least
one photograph for each site for the ANRA files.
Existing documentation was reviewed and great
care was to be taken to avoid errors in either using
existing feature numbers or assigning new ones. The
use of feature inventory sheets kept track of feature
numbers and their association with site numbers,
whether temporary or trinomial. Photographic documentation of features was required for the ANRA
site files. Film was issued at the Field Laboratory
with the roll number already assigned to it to keep
track of how many sets of photographs were generated concurrently each day. Roll and exposure
numbers were recorded on photo logs.
At the end of the day in which it was completed, all documentation was turned in to the
Field Laboratory, thus insuring that the records
generated were in order. Site-specific bag lists
were generated if collections were made, and
information on each bag was to be filled out completely and accurately. A record of the next bag
number was then to be made to take to the field
the next day (see Collins et al. 1999:10-28).
Surveying, Recording, and Documenting
New Sites and Relocating, Assessing,
and Updating Known Sites
The survey team’s objective was to find all
sites within the Operation and obtain locational

6

Texas Archeological Society

data to guide the documentation team that followed
behind them. They took maps and records with
them of previously recorded sites in the area along
with blank survey forms. Both the USGS 7.5’
quadrangle sheet and the International Boundary
and Water Commission (IBWC) contour maps
made of the reservoir before inundation were used
in most cases to determine known, and document
new, site locations.
Further information was collected on following
visits by the documentation team who recorded site
information on the ANRA Archeological Site Data
Form. In keeping with field school objectives, extra
care was to be taken in noting impacts to a site and
emphasis was given to the collection of accurate
and complete records. After properly identifying
existing sites, documentation teams updated records that did not meet current standards or that
no longer reflected the site’s present condition.

Documenting Features
One of the most important activities of the
field school was the documentation of features
solely from surface exposure as well as through
excavation. As the majority of the features to be
documented were completely visible at the surface,
little preparation was necessary to begin recording
in most cases. Once the paperwork was in order,
photographs were taken, and detailed drawing or
mapping documented the feature. Scale drawings
on gridded paper using visual observations were
employed for small features, while larger features
required triangulation drawing techniques. Very
large features were mapped with either optical
transits or a Total Data Station.
Test Excavations and Data Recovery
Excavations
Basic procedures for both test excavations
and more intensive data recovery excavations
were the same; however, specific techniques were
chosen for each area or feature. For example,
objectives for the three test excavations at
burned rock midden sites were to determine if the
middens were intact and to evaluate their research
value. Stratigraphic units were used for vertical
provenience when discernible or in combination
with arbitrary levels. Data recovery excavations
sought to collect more comprehensive information

to answer specific questions about an aspect of an
archeological deposit or feature.
Burned Rock Feature Protocol
Burned rock features encountered, mapped,
recorded, tested, and/or excavated ranged from
small hearths to burned rock middens. Each
Operation may have had different research and
management objectives, but similar features
were treated in a consistent fashion as much as
possible to support the collection of comparable
archeological data. To this end, any feature
smaller than 3-4 m across was considered an
“individual” burned rock feature, while features
greater than 3-4 m across that had several layers of rock in the center were deemed “midden”
features. A number of the rocks in several of the
features were drilled for archeomagnetic testing
by Wulf Gose.
Individual Burned Rock Feature Protocol
Burned rock features smaller than 3 m may
have served a variety of specific functions, however, the data necessary to determine the specific
purposes of each feature may not be evident from
a surface examination. By and large, a greater
number of the burned rock features encountered
in this field school were probably the remains
of earth ovens that were commonly reused. The
Manual (Collins et al. 1999:14-20) includes a
discussion of earth oven use and a checklist of
specific research questions to guide data collection, as well as an excerpt from “Critically
Recording and Observing Burned Rock Features”
(Black and Ellis 1997) as an appendix. After
helping participants gain an understanding of the
various types of information that can and should
be recorded when investigating individual burned
rock features and middens, the Manual (Collins et
al. 1999: 21-23) laid out the investigative protocol
in a 14-question checklist.
After determining the condition of the feature
and reviewing the associated paperwork to see if
it already had been assigned a feature number in
the past, a flagged stake was placed at each feature,
clearly labeled with the feature number (F1, F2,
etc.) in bold felt pen. Some sites required a metric
grid with excavation units placed per common
archeological methods. When this method of excavation was not utilized, two arbitrary reference

Johnson and Johnson—Prehistoric Land Use at Amistad National Recreation Area 7
points (Reference Point A, B, etc.) at each feature
that required investigation beyond Total Data Station (TDS) mapping and photography were tied
into a known datum by TDS mapping crews. On
ungridded sites, 2 x 2 m excavation units were imposed as needed, numbered 1, 2, 3, etc., for each of
the investigated features, and tied to the reference
point for each feature. A complete reference for a
given feature included site number, feature number,
unit number, and level number. Recovery techniques included screening soil through 1/4-inch to
1/8-inch mesh screens, collecting matrix samples
for special processing (flotation or fine screening),
and/or foregoing screening in order to simply expose the feature.
Burned Rock Midden Protocol
To determine if middens contained intact
hearth features, at least three 1 x 1 m units were
placed in the central portion of burned rock middens. These units were hand excavated in arbitrary
levels, and rocks were carefully removed to look
for intact rock-lined hearth features. If these were
found, they were fully exposed, documented, and
left in place unless the Park Archeologist decided
otherwise. Fine screen soil matrix from the units
was collected and screened.

ROCK ART RECORDING
PROCEDURES
The Manual (Collins et al. 1999) stated that
Teddy Stickney, Nola Davis, and other Rock Art
Committee members would provide all the necessary information and procedures to participants in
the rock art recording effort. The rock art recorders
set a baseline, created a 1 x 1m grid (usually 2 m
high) with string and sticky tack, and documented
the site with photographs and drawings of the
rock art (Teddy Stickney, personal communication
2007).

LABORATORY AND ANALYTICAL
PROCEDURES
The Field Laboratory processing goal was
to get all bags logged into the lab, all materials
washed, and ideally to get artifacts cataloged before the conclusion of the Field School. Generally

the processing sequence in the Manual (Collins et
al. 1999) was as follows: admitting and logging in
bags; washing (or special handling as needed); filling out catalog forms (count and weigh artifacts);
bagging for curation; completion of curation tags;
labeling; boxing by site; and inventorying and final
packing. Special handling was required of artifacts
with residues, charcoal, matrix, flotation, and other
samples, which were not to be washed. Radiocarbon samples were to be absolutely dry when stored.
All faunal remains that passed through the field
laboratory were identified and cataloged by Bill
McClure.
Another function of the laboratory was records
management. All field records were to be turned in
when no longer needed in the field. Electronic data
(TDS, digital photographs, GPS, etc.) were to be
downloaded at NPS headquarters daily, overseen
by Eddie de la Rosa.
We organized and rehoused the 1999 collections at TARL in archival bags while analyzing
the artifact following TARL standards. A debitage
analysis form and level summary form were developed to record and organize these data during
analysis. Notable artifacts were photographed
with a digital camera during analysis on cm scale
graph paper for reference. These notable artifacts
were separated from the rest of the collections
and placed together for ease of access by future
researchers.
Radiocarbon Dating
Four samples from the 1999 TAS fieldwork
were submitted to Beta Analytic for dating (Table 1).
Samples ANRA-1 (Beta-140481) and ANRA-2 were
from 41VV1752. ANRA-1 (Beta-140481) came
from the northeast corner (identified as FX2A) of
hearth feature FX2. This sample returned a conventional radiocarbon age of 310 ± 40 B.P., calibrated
to AD 1470-1660 at 2 sigma. Sample ANRA-2
(Beta-140482) came from feature FX4, Unit 2, at a
depth of 14 cm bs. This sample returned a conventional radiocarbon age of 360 ± 40 B.P., calibrated
to A.D. 1445-1645 at 2 sigma.
Samples ANRA-3 (Beta-140483) and
ANRA-4 (Beta-14084) came from large pieces
of wood charcoal from well-preserved basinshaped hearth features at site 41VV1207. Sample
ANRA-3 (Beta-140483) was charcoal from a layer below the rocks of feature FX33. This sample
returned a conventional radiocarbon age of 1470 ±

GRAZING IMPACT STUDY
Malof’s (1999) study quantified the effects of
grazing on archeological sites at ANRA. The site
recording and update forms designed for the 1999
TAS Field School included fields to record impacts
to sites from domestic livestock and other disturbances such as erosion, deposition, a fluctuating
shoreline, modern camping, and looting. GPS and
GIS technologies were used to record and study the
spatial patterning of these impacts.
As a result of the work done during the field
school using these forms, Malof was able to gather
data from 72 archeological sites. He found that 43
(60%) had been impacted by grazing. By setting
a baseline prescriptive methodology and initial
dataset, Malof (1999) established a database

designed for future data entry and monitoring
that will help the NPS manage and protect sites
by being better able to quantify and track impacts
to sites from loose livestock.

OPERATIONS
The work of the 1999 TAS field school was
divided into 19 different Operations, each with its
own specific research objectives within a specific
geographic area (Figure 2). Objectives for many
operations (Operations 3-5, 9, 11, 15, and 17-19)
were to survey for new sites, record and document
new sites, relocate known sites, and document exposed features. The other operations had specific
objectives other than (or in addition to) survey and
site documentation. We discuss each individual
operation in turn, addressing the location, objectives, personnel involved, sites visited, and work
performed at each site (Table 2).
Operation 1
The objective of Operation 1 was to document exposed features in detail at 41VV1723 and
41VV1724. These two sites are significant because

they are the only known sites in the Lower Pecos
region besides Infierno Camp (41VV446) (see Operation 2) that each have over 100 rock rings, these
probably representing house structures (Kenmotsu
and Wade 2002:124). Notable features at these sites
include wikiup rings, tipi rings, bedrock mortars,
middens, and other burned rock features.
41VV1723
This site is located on a slightly sloping terrace
along the Rio Grande. The site file was updated and
TAS crews set out to document as many features
as possible. Plan maps were made of individual
features and flags were set out at features and
artifacts for the TDS crew to shoot in.
In all, over 300 features, clusters of features,
and surface finds were flagged and shot in with
a TDS. Excepting one unspecified artifact or feature, nine modern hearths/cairns, and the brass
IBWC survey marker set into concrete, these are
discussed below by feature and artifact type.
A total of 20 rock rings were recorded and
mapped (Table 3). Of these possible structural

features, three tipi rings were individually mapped
and recorded (Table 4).
A variety of thermal features (Table 5) are
present, including ring middens, mounded burned
rock middens (BRMs), BRMs with associated
hearths, hearths, and scatters or accumulations
of fire-cracked rock (FCR). Of the features listed
in Table 5, five individual BRMs and at least 24
hearth features were recorded and mapped in detail
(Table 6).
Ground stone bedrock features are also common at 41VV1723, and are often clustered together (Table 7). The locations of several ground
stone artifacts were also mapped (Table 8).
A number of flaked stone artifacts were recovered from the surface of 41VV1723, including dart points, arrow points, a biface fragment,
three scrapers, and two hammerstones (Table 9).
Twelve of the flaked stone tools collected were
projectile points, including a number of Archaic
dart point styles as well as three Perdiz arrow
points (Table 10).
Rock rings such as those present at 41VV1723
are typical of the Infi erno phase of the Late

(Figure 4). All edges appear used. A prismatic blade
from the site has use wear and polish along approximately 2 cm of the edge (Figure 5).
An unusual artifact collected from this site was
a drilled freshwater mussel shell (Figure 6). Similar
drilled mussel shells were found during the excavations at Fate Bell rock shelter (41VV74) by Pearce
and Jackson (1933:120) in Seminole Canyon State
Park. Individual shells may have been suspended as
ornaments, but they may have also had other functions. Pearce and Jackson (1933:60) report finding
a cache of five pairs of drilled mussel shells that
they believed had been strung together, perhaps as
a rattle.
Several pieces of mussel shell, ochre, and
other unspecified artifacts were shot in with the
TDS. They are listed in Table 11.
The features and much of the artifact assemblage from 41VV1723 are a medley of Late

Prehistoric Toyah and Infierno phase traits. The
presence of Perdiz arrow points, middens, and the
site’s river terrace location seem more consistent
with a Toyah than Infierno occupation. However,
the site’s many rock rings are characteristic of
an Infierno phase occupation. Perhaps the site’s
terrace location gave its inhabitants ready access
both to permanent water and upland resources
(via the adjacent tributary canyon). This may
have made it appealing to both Toyah and Infierno groups. Such a location would be a popular
campsite in any day and age, and the remains of
modern campfires here are as unsurprising as the
sequence of dart points indicating that the site was
also occupied throughout the Archaic period.
The thermal features at this site are another
of its intriguing aspects, since several different
morphological types are present and they are
relatively intact. A worthwhile avenue for future

of different types at the site, taking both macrobotanical and radiocarbon samples in hopes of
linking specific feature morphologies to the processing of specific resources (and perhaps artifact
assemblages) at a particular time in prehistory.

Operation 3
Operation 3 covered the Cow Creek valley
from lake level up to the NPS park boundary at the
1144.3 ft. amsl elevation. This area was reached
by boat. The survey area included eight previously
known sites: 41VV178, 41VV179, 41VV1656,
41VV1836-1838, 41VV1840, and 41VV1853. It
was estimated that the TAS crews might discover
as many as 20 unrecorded sites during Operation
3. The Crew Chief was Wayne Clampitt.
Site 41VV1656 was not visited, and 41VV1836
and 41VV1837 could not be relocated; 41VV179
was submerged at the time. Fieldwork was performed at a number of sites, as discussed next.

Operation 2
Operation 2 was designed to document the 100+
wikiup rings, artifact distributions, and burned rock
features present at Infierno Camp (41VV446). Elton
Prewitt was crew chief for this operation. This location is the type site for the Late Prehistoric Infierno
phase (Turpin 1995:552-553).
Collins et al. (2000:11-13) provide an overview of work performed at the site during the 1999
TAS field school. Briefly, Operation 2 set out to
construct a detailed topographic map of the entire
site, documenting the stone alignment features and
assigning them permanent feature numbers, as well
as to make detailed drawings of selected features.
These goals were largely met, with a substantial
part of the map completed and 140 features given
permanent numbers and shot in with a TDS. Unfortunately, creating drawings of individual features
required a great many man-hours, and the intense
foot traffic around the features being recorded introduced too high a risk of potential impact to the
site. Collins et al. (2000) suggested future scaled
drawings of features be made in the lab using
overhead stereoscopic photography to minimize
site impact during recording.

Site files were updated for both of these known
sites.
41VV1838
The site file was updated and the site was
mapped. There were 10 rock hearths, along with
two possible tipi rings (4.5-6 m in diameter)
located 16.5 m from the nearest hearth. FCR was
present but no other artifacts. All the features
were in a single east-west line along the creek
terrace, and they may represent a single prehistoric
occupation.
41VV1853
The site file was updated. The only materials
observed at this site during the TAS visit were
a modern campfire hearth and an old aluminum
chair.
41VV1889
A previously unrecorded site, 41VV1889 has
25+ hearths, FCR, and tipi rings along the upper
edge of eroding rock along the crest of a hillside.
There were no large accumulations of FCR, and
no artifacts or debitage were observed here. The

16

Texas Archeological Society

hearths appear randomly spaced, suggesting a
campsite occupied over many seasons.
Operation 4
Operation 4 covered the north shore of the
reservoir between Rio Grande buoys 4 and 9,
between the current lake level and the park boundary. The area was accessed by boat. The survey
area included 20 known sites, and it was estimated
that crews might discover an additional 10-15
sites. Most of the known sites (41VV195-197,
41VV300-306, 41VV310-313, 41VV1784,
41VV1786-1792) were not visited during the TAS
Field School.
41VV309
The site file was updated. Roughly 95 percent
of this site has been destroyed by wave action.

41VV1865
A wide scatter of lithic debris, FCR, and possibly some ochre was observed at this new site.
No features were observed, but there was a considerable amount of vegetation that obscured the
surface. A complete Ensor dart point was collected
from the surface (4.3 cm in length, 2.3 cm in width,
0.9 cm in thickness, and weighing 6.5 g).
41VV1875
This new site is south of Amistad Acres. This
site is 16 x 30 m in size and consists of three or
more hearths, scattered lithics and FCR, and a possible wikiup ring. Some of the hearths have been
scattered by wave action. A possible point base and
scraper were observed and mapped when the site
was recorded.
41VV1878

41VV1318 and 41VV1785
Site fi les were updated on both of these
sites.
41VV1855
At this open site on the Rio Grande three
BRMs formed a crescent shape. One of these is
a large ellipse with a depression in it. Materials
were collected during the 1999 TAS field school
from the surface of a feature designated Hearth 3,
but we could not relocate the 1999 record forms
for this site so it is unclear if Hearth 3 is a feature
of one of these BRMs or a nearby discrete hearth.
One of the artifacts collected was a Bandy dart
point or preform that appears to have suffered a
manufacturing failure with one barb and part of the
base completed (3.4 cm in length, 3.0 cm wide, 0.9
cm thick, and 8.4 g in weight). The other artifacts
consist of a biface fragment, two cores, and 1.1 g
of red ochre.
41VV1864
This is a previously unrecorded site with many
scattered hearths. The highest concentration of lithics was around one of the hearths (FX3), where two
biface fragments and a broken Val Verde dart point
were collected (3.3 cm in length, 2.2 cm in width,
0.5 cm thick, and 3.5 g in weight).

The site has scattered FCR and lithics, as well
as evidence of heavy recent (as of 1999) looting.
An Ensor point was collected from the surface,
missing its very tip and a small part of one basal
corner (4.3 cm long, 2.4 cm wide, 0.6 cm thick, and
weighing 6.7 g).
Operation 5
Operation 5 encompassed the Diablo West
hunting area. The area was accessed by road.
Crew chiefs were Darrell Humphreys and Johnny
Byers. The survey area included fi ve known
sites, 41VV280, 41VV287, 41VV1225-1226, and
41VV1589; 41VV280, 41VV287, 41VV1225,
and 41VV1226 were not visited. Collins et al.
(2000:13) report documentation of three unrecorded sites. Unfortunately, no paperwork for
Operation 5 fieldwork has been relocated and it is
unclear if 41VV1589 was visited or which previously unrecorded sites were documented. Catalog
records indicate that no artifacts were collected
from Operation 5 fieldwork.
Operation 6
Operation 6 was located along the Rio Grande
below Amistad Dam. The area was accessed by
road, and objectives for the fieldwork included
rock art recording and test excavations of the

Johnson and Johnson—Prehistoric Land Use at Amistad National Recreation Area 17
upper components of buried sites 41VV661 and
41VV662 for the purposes of recovering prehistoric ceramics in discrete contexts. The survey
area included six known sites, 41VV660-663,
41VV672, and 41VV910. Sites 41VV662-663,
41VV672, and 41VV910 were not apparently
visited during the TAS Field School.
41VV660
Brite Shelter is located on the north cliff
face above the floodplain of the Rio Grande. The
shelter contains burned rock, lithic debris, and red
geometric pictographs similar to sites along the
Rio Grande near Shumla. Solveig Turpin notes
in the 1984 site record form that the pictographs
were “flaking badly and covered with calcite.”
Pictographs at this site were recorded by the TAS
Rock Art Task Force to document them before they
degraded further (Figure 7).

Figure 7. Rock art documentation at 41VV660.

This name of this shelter is sometimes mistakenly spelled “Bright,” but the name is derived
from the site’s location near the NPS boundary
with the Brite Ranch.
41VV661
This site is a buried midden on a terrace along
the Rio Grande. In previous investigations (Gustavson and Collins 1998:37), it yielded a conventional
radiocarbon age of 660 + 50 B.P. The 1999 TAS
excavations at this site produced a variety of Late
Prehistoric artifacts, including a ceramic sherd, and
this work is discussed in greater detail below.

Operation 7
Operation 7 encompassed the Evans Creek
area. The area was accessed by road, and there
were two sets of objectives for the fieldwork. Eddie Osburn and crew conducted a survey for new
sites, recording and documentation of new sites,
relocation of known sites, and documentation of
exposed features. Reba Jones and Jerry Grubbs
conducted test excavations at burned rock midden
site 41VV665.
The survey area included eight known sites,
41VV552, 41VV665, 41VV955, 41VV1718-1719,
and 41VV1729-1731. Sites forms for 41VV664,
41VV955, and 41VV1718 were updated, and four
previously unrecorded sites were documented;
41VV552 was not relocated. It appears that sites
41VV1729-1731 were not visited.
41VV665
This site is a BRM located at the confluence of
a small tributary and Evans Creek. The site form
was updated, and seven units were laid out. Of the
seven, five were excavated: Unit 2 and Units 4-7.
A feature (FX1) was identified by an arc of rocks
in Unit 4 and was found to extend into Units 5
and 7. FX1 had a basin shape with a diameter of
approximately 1.2 m. Six holes were drilled in
rocks around the outer perimeter of the hearth for
archeomagnetic testing.
Materials recovered from the excavations at
41VV665 are listed by unit in Tables 12-16. Excavation records for Units 5 and 7 specified what
materials came from inside Feature 1 versus what
derived from the rest of the unit. This does not
appear to have been done for Unit 4, which also
contains part of Feature 1. The Feature 1 materials
from Units 5 and 7 are listed in Table 16.
A Langtry dart point base was found in Unit 4,
a small Frio dart point was collected from the site
surface, and a Perdiz arrow point was found in Unit
2 between 10-20 cm below the surface (bs) (Figures
8 and 9). These point types indicate Middle Archaic
through Late Prehistoric occupations of the site.
The quantity of debitage at 41VV665 generally decreased with depth except for within the
feature, where the opposite is true. This suggests
that the feature and the most intense flint knapping activity may postdate the accumulation of
the lower portion of the midden. The gradation
in debitage quantity may indicate an increase in

left in place. This site has at least 12 hearth features
and burned rock scatters.
41VV1858, 41VV1859, 41VV1863,
and 41VV1884
These sites are all previously unrecorded. At
41VV1858 there is a dome-shaped BRM with an
associated debitage scatter and two hearths along
its southwest edge. One hearth (FX1) is 1.4 m in
diameter, with some charcoal present. The other
(FX2) is 1 m in diameter and eroding out of the
midden with about half of its stones buried in a
sandy clay loam matrix. The distal fragment of a
biface was observed, but not collected.
There is a small BRM at 41VV1859 that has
been impacted by slope wash, vegetation, and the
dumping of limestone related to modern construction activities. The site has a low surface artifact
density.
Site 41VV1863 has two small BRMs, 78
m apart, deflated and disturbed by wave action.
There is a lithic scatter at the site, but no diagnostics were observed.
At 41VV1884, there is a circular rock ring
feature (2.2 m outside diameter) high on the landscape in a water-eroded area of broadly scattered
FCR. Cores, debitage, and tools were observed.
The large rocks that make up the ring feature are
interspersed with smaller stones. Sandstone slabs
are inside the circle, which appear to have openings facing the valley to the northeast. Two cores
were found inside the circle, and outside the circle
were found a chert graver, a chert side scraper,
one rhyolite flake, and one chert end scraper.
Operation 8
Operation 8 encompassed the Spur 406 (California Creek) area. A crew under the supervision
of Dick Gregg performed survey for new sites,

recording and documentation of new sites, relocation of known sites, and documentation of exposed features. Test excavations were performed
at BRM site 41VV1717 under the direction of
Max Hibbitts and at 41VV1732, supervised by
Henry Mueggenborg and Beth Mendenhall.
The survey area included five known sites:
41VV251, 41VV1717, 41VV1732-1733, and
41VV1738. Sites 41VV251 and 41VV1733 were
not visited.
Previously unrecorded sites 41VV1870-1874
were documented. All are recorded as modern
hearths and have since had their trinomials
rescinded.
41VV1717
The file for this site was updated. 41VV1717
is divided into three areas: A, B, and C. Area A is
a large dome-shaped midden on the west side of
California Creek, and was excavated. Areas B and
C, both small BRMs or FCR scatters, were not excavated. The Area B midden is 10 m from the edge
of a stone bluff with a small cave in it. Midden Area
C is located immediately to the southwest of Area B.
The site and cave were mapped, and a large chopper
was observed on the surface of a ledge in front of
the cave. Modern hearths indicate that this area of
the site has been heavily used by fishermen.
Excavations at Area A were laid out in a 3 x
2 m block composed of six 1 x 1 m units (Figure
10). Archeomagnetic samples were taken from the
hearth feature in the center north unit, SW5. The
artifacts recovered from Area A are listed in Tables
18-23 by excavation unit.
Most of the artifacts from 41VV1717 Area
A were recovered in units SW5 and SW6, at the
northeastern side of the excavation block. Table
24 summarizes the artifacts found in all six
excavation units by level.

The stratigraphic position of Early Archaic dart
points consistently below Middle Archaic types
suggests that the midden interior is reasonably
intact below 15 cm bs. Above this level, however,
the midden has been deflated from wave action and
disturbed by bioturbation from Corbicula clams.
The use of this site seemed to peak and then decline
during the Middle Archaic, with no diagnostic
artifacts representing either the Late Archaic or Late
Prehistoric periods, times when many other sites in

This large site is located on a peninsula along
California Creek and has a variety of thermal features
present. A midden or dense FCR scatter (designated
feature BRM-1, measuring 8 x 3 m) is at the northeastern edge of the site. Some debitage is present
on the surface near feature BRM-1. In all, 13 FCR
features were recorded, most being distinct hearths
(including an oven feature designated FX-A) but
some had become scattered. Most of the ancient
hearths are located in the central portion of the site.
Prehistoric oven feature F-XA is 2 m in diameter. Rocks on the outer edge of the feature are
exposed at the surface, as are a few at the very
center. Archeomagnetic samples were taken from
six rocks in the outer part of F-XA.
Unit 1 was placed to test historic hearth
feature H-6 atop BRM-1. This excavation showed

The purpose of these features is unclear, but it is
possible that they may date to the Late Prehistoric

a similar “unburned circular rock pavement” at the
Infierno Camp site.
Operation 9
Operation 9 was headed by Johnny Byers and
encompassed the Long Point hunting area. The area
was accessed by boat. The survey area included two
known sites: 41VV1227-1228. We were unable to
relocate the site record updates for these sites, but
Collins et al. (2000:14) report that the known sites
were found “about as previously documented.”

Operation 10
Operation 10 primarily comprised the rock
art recording efforts by the TAS Rock Art Task
Force under Teddy Stickney and Nola Davis
at the Curly-tailed Panther site (41VV18). Site
documentation (no rock art) was also performed
within the Operation 10 area at 41VV27.
41VV18
This well-known Pecos River Style site is
perched high on a bluff in the Indian Cliffs area of
the east bank of the Devils River, and it is owned
by the Rock Art Foundation. The site is accessible
only via a narrow ledge and, because the floor is

not suitable for most activities, was probably used
ceremonially or ritually and was not a habitation
site (Figure 11).
The site consists of two overhangs. Overhang A contains well
preserved feline and other motifs,
including the large “Curly-tailed
Panther,” other smaller panthers,
and an anthropomorphic (humanshaped) figure. A grinding facet
is present at the downstream end
of the overhang. Overhang B
contains several bold-line geometric motifs, including zigzags
and pennants, one of the latter
enclosed in a rectangular outline.
Other designs present may be
classified with the Red Monochrome and Red Linear rock art
styles.

The site file was updated and the site was
mapped. This site is a BRM and lithic scatter on
the north side of a drainage entering the Devils
River in the area of Slaughter Bend. Val Verde and
Langtry dart points, manos, and a chopper were
observed. Impacts include modern fire pits, clearings for tent sites, and looter holes.
Operation 11
Operation 11 encompassed the North Arm
of San Pedro Creek. The Crew Chief was Glynn
Osburn. The area was accessible by road or by
boat. The survey area included four known sites,
41VV1450 and 41VV1746-1748. Three previously unrecorded sites (41VV1886-1888) were also

documented. Site 41VV1450 was not visited.
Sites in this operation were also assessed by
Gustavson and Collins (2000) for damage from
floodwaters from heavy rains brought by Tropical
Storm Charley in August 1998. Gustavson and
Collins also examined impacts to these sites from
other natural and human sources including wave
action, vandalism, and bioturbation.
41VV1746
The site was mapped and the site form updated.
It is located along the north bank of the north fork
of San Pedro Creek. Some of the site has been lost
to flood erosion, which has also exposed additional
features. The site contains approximately 20 individual ovens and hearths, and three BRMs and an
extensive FCR and lithic scatter. FCR features range

26

Texas Archeological Society

from 0.5-3 m in diameter. Two of the BRMs are
roughly circular, while the other is linear in shape.
The lithic scatter is concentrated in the area of the
burned rock features. Two distal biface (projectile
point?) tips, and a scraper were found. One thin,
narrow, and very well-made broken biface was collected, which may represent an Angostura manufacturing failure. This biface (Figure 12) has use
wear and polish along about 1 cm of one side.

Not counting the biface above, 12 projectile
points were collected (Figures 13-14), but only
one (Point #1, a Palmillas) was complete (Table
25). Ten of these projectile points were found in
the western 100 m of the site.
Projectile point #10 appears to be a preform,
possibly a Bandy point because of its slightly bifurcated base. Otherwise it resembles the Almagre
type, considered by Turner and Hester (1999:69)
to be preforms of Langtry dart points.
411VV1747

The site form was updated. This is an open site
with 12 FCR features (hearths and ovens), plus a
BRM measuring 4 x 3 m.
41VV1748
This site has been obliterated and effectively
destroyed. Some widely scattered FCR is still present, but no features or lithic artifacts remain; the
site form was updated.
41VV1886

Figure 13. Dart Point
from 41VV1746, Point
#2, Gower type.

This site is a rock shelter located in a limestone
bluff along the north fork of San Pedro Creek.
There is a mound of flood deposits, limestone, and
burned rock at the entrance, which is 11 m across.
Burned rock is eroding out of the dirt at the base
of the shelter, and there is a possible hearth at the
entrance to the shelter. Charcoal may be eroding
from the earth wall at the back of the shelter, and
several sharpening grooves are present on walls
and boulders. A possible serpent-shaped petroglyph
is also present here. Lithic debitage is present on
the floor of the shelter, but no diagnostic artifacts
were found. There is a hearth about 30 m to the
southeast of the shelter.

Four preforms and much debitage were seen, but
no distinct features or diagnostic artifacts were
observed. The site was recorded and mapped by
the TAS.

41VV1888

This is a lithic scatter on the south side of the
North Fork of the San Pedro drainage. One FCR
feature measuring 2 x 1 m is present on the west
side of the site, but no other discrete features
were observed. Debitage was present but no other
artifacts were observed.
Operation 12
Operation 12 had two separate crews working
in the East and South arms of San Pedro Creek.
The first crew was headed by Steve Black, with
Deborah Beene as assistant Crew Chief. This crew
worked in the East Arm of San Pedro Creek. The
area was accessible by road, and their objectives
were the documentation of exposed features as
well as data recovery excavations to mitigate
damage to burned rock features 41VV1751 and
41VV1752 caused by the flood of August 1998.
The second crew in Operation 12, headed by
Johnny Byers, worked in both the East and South
arms of San Pedro Creek. The area was accessible
by road, and objectives for the fieldwork included
survey for new sites, recording and documentation of new sites, relocation of known sites, and
documentation of exposed features. The survey
area included five known sites, 41VV1749-1753,
but this crew did not visit any of them.
41VV1751
This is an open site on a bend of the East
arm of San Pedro Creek. When this site was first
recorded in 1996, it was described as having a large
BRM and a few discrete hearths in a large scatter of
FCR. Several dart points (Baker, Pandale, Langtry,
Shumla, Edgewood, and Frio types), two manos,
and a mano fragment were collected at that time.
The crew for the 1999 TAS excavations consisted of Steve Black, Nancy Porter, Beth Aucoin,
Jim Scheider, Carol Nicklaus, Michelle Roberson,
and Louise Stone. The site was heavily impacted
by August 1998 flooding, with obvious erosion and
gravel deposition (almost 1 m thick over parts of
the site). Few intact features were visible, although
several FCR scatters and diffuse concentrations
were present. Shallow excavations conducted at
three of these features by the TAS revealed numerous gravels amid the burned rocks, indicating the
heavy impact of the August 1998 flood as well as
by previous floods.

A test pit measuring 2 x 3.5 m was dug into the
gravel bar over the “Hidden Midden,” encountering
a layer of burned rock (the presumed top of the
midden) at a depth of 97 cm bs. Many burned rocks
were also observed in the gravel bar downstream,
suggesting that much of the original upper surface
of the midden may have eroded away prior to
gravel deposition.
A second test pit (Unit 1) was set out measuring 1.5 x 1.5 m over a feature designated FX1. This
feature was excavated to a depth of 5 cm bs, but
proved to consist of scattered burned rock with no
coherent pattern. An Ensor dart point (missing its
tip, one shoulder, and the opposite basal corner) was
found in Unit 1. It was 3.9 cm long, 2.0 cm wide,
0.6 cm thick, and weighed 3.9 g. Other artifacts
recovered in Unit 1 included four modified flakes,
snails, charcoal, and 116.0 g of lithic debitage.
Unit 2 (1 x 1 m) was set up diagonally to Unit
1. This proved to contain a scatter of burned rock
with no apparent pattern. The unit was excavated
to a depth of 5 cm and then abandoned after exposing the rocks. Snails and 3.5 g of debitage were
recovered from this unit.
Feature 4 was a nearby humped cluster of
burned rock. A 1 x 1 m unit was laid out over it. Although the rocks of this feature were more tightly
clustered than those of the other features, there
was still no coherent pattern to them. Four modified flakes, two freshwater mussel shell fragments,
snails, and 53.0 g of debitage were recovered from
Feature 4.
Artifacts observed at the site included a fragment of a mano made from dark, metamorphic
material, a large flake tool, 3-5 pieces of debitage,
and a small Ensor dart point. The dart point was
collected from the gravel bar just downstream
from the eroding features, and measured 4.0 cm in
length, 2.3 cm in width, 0.7 cm in thickness, and
weighed 5.1 g. An unidentified arrow point was
found and surface-plotted by the GIS team.
The jumbled burned rocks mixed with gravels
exposed by these excavations suggest it is unlikely
that any exposed features at this site remain intact.
It is unclear if some of the larger rocks remained in
place or if all the rocks were in a secondary context. It is also possible, but unlikely, that no intact
features remained prior to the 1998 flooding.
41VV1752
This site is located on a sloping to flat alluvial

Johnson and Johnson—Prehistoric Land Use at Amistad National Recreation Area 29
terrace on the east side of the South Fork of San
Pedro creek. The site contains over 35 hearths/
ovens, isolated lithics, and large, non-burned
manuport stones that may have been part of wikiup
or tipi rings, although no coherent patterning and
few Late Prehistoric artifacts were found at the
site. Features FX1, FX2, FX3, FX4, and FX7 were
located along the cut bank of the creek and were
in danger of complete obliteration during the next
flood. Feature FX3 was opened and cleaned, but
not fully excavated. Features FX1, FX2, FX4, and
FX7 were excavated and the matrix was screened
through 1/4-inch mesh on-site. Archeomagnetic
samples were taken from rocks in hearth features
FX1, FX2, and FX4.
Six projectile points (Table 26), a biface, a
uniface, and a secondary flake (possibly a preform
for an arrow point), were collected as isolated surface finds from 41VV1752. The arrow point was
collected near a dispersed feature on the south end
of the site above the creek (Figure 15).
Feature FX1 was a hearth, U-shaped in plan
and relatively flat, and not basin-shaped in profile. Charcoal was present under many of the
rocks. It measures 1.55 m northwest-southeast x
1.7 m northeast-southwest, and appears to have
been reused repeatedly (Gustavson and Collins
2000:41). It was excavated to a depth of 23 cm
bs in one level. The south-central portion of this

hearth was relatively intact and consisted of
large, fossiliferous limestone rocks laying flat,
whereas much of the other FCR in this feature
was globular and lying at various angles. This unit
produced one biface fragment, 15.8 g of charcoal,
two snails, and 8.5 g of debitage. Three charcoal
samples were also collected from the feature. Six
archeomagnetic samples were taken from rocks in
this unit and showed that the feature was intact;
the rocks had been heated to between 550˚C and
575˚C and then cooled in place (Gustavson and
Collins 2000:41).
Feature FX2 was a diamond-shaped hearth,
flat in profile, measuring 180 x 120 cm in size
(Gustavson and Collins 2000:41). This hearth was
constructed of tightly packed, large, flat pieces of
fossiliferous limestone. The northeast corner of
the feature (FX2A) was excavated to a depth of
14 cm bs. One snail shell and 1.0 g of debitage
were collected and four carbon samples were taken
from within the feature. A second lot of artifacts
also labeled FX2 Level 1 (perhaps from the rest of
the unit outside the feature?) contained two biface
fragments.
One of the FX2 charcoal samples (Lot 1,
Sample SW) was sent for AMS dating as sample
ANRA-1 (Beta-140481) and returned a conventional radiocarbon age of 310 ± 40 B.P., calibrated
to AD 1470-1660 at 2 sigma (see Table 1).

many apparently fractured in place. Most of these
rocks were located around the perimeter of the
feature. Feature FX7 was excavated in a single 20
cm level. The only materials recovered from this
feature were 1.8 g of charcoal.
41VV1867

Figure 15. Untyped arrow point.

Archeomagnetic samples were collected from
FX2 rocks and showed the feature to be intact
(Gustavson and Collins 2000:30). The many unbroken rocks and the absence of small fragments
suggest that the feature was not used more than a
few times (Gustavson and Collins 2000:42).
Feature FX3 was within a 1x 2 m unit that was
cleaned to expose the feature but it was not excavated
below the surface. Matrix from cleaning the feature
produced 15.7 g of debitage, one modified flake, two
snail shells, and 3.6 g of orange-brown ochre.
Feature FX4 was a roughly circular and basinshaped FCR feature, excavated in two 2 x 2 m
units, each a single level deep. FX4, Unit 1, produced a Fairland type dart point (4 cm in length,
3 cm wide and weighing 5.8 g). It is nearly complete with damage only to the barb and the basal
corner on one side. Other artifacts included 74.4
g of debitage, four modified flakes, 5.1 g of charcoal, 0.6 g of red ochre, snails, and an Exogyra
fossil. An additional 0.3 g in situ carbon sample
was also collected from Unit 1. FX4, Unit 2,
produced 34.1 g of debitage, one modified flake,
12.7 g of charcoal, snails, and a 1.6 g in situ carbon sample. A second in situ carbon sample (Lot
32, Sample 2) was recovered from a depth of 14
cm bs. This sample was sent to Beta Analytic for
AMS dating as sample ANRA-2 (Beta-140482)
and returned a conventional radiocarbon age of
360 ± 40 B.P., calibrated to A.D. 1445-1645 at 2
sigma (see Table 1). The four rocks drilled for archeomagnetic testing at this feature suggest some
disturbance, perhaps from shifting of the rocks
during use (Gustavson and Collins 2000:43).
Feature FX7 was a roughly circular and basinshaped accumulation nearly 2 m in diameter of
10-15 cm diameter pieces of fire-cracked limestone,

This is a previously unrecorded site. It extends for 200 m on the north side of a point bar
in a tributary to San Pedro Creek. Floodwaters
appear to have scattered FCR over the entire site.
A BRM (FX-1) is located in the center of the site,
measuring 21 x 15 m. Debitage included some
large cortical flakes, but consisted mainly of large
interior flakes. Three diagnostic dart points or
fragments (Pandale, Palmillas, and Bandy types),
a preform fragment, and an untyped medial dart
point fragment were collected from the surface
of the site. The Bandy dart point is missing its
tip and barbs (3.5 cm long, 3.0 cm wide, 0.7 cm
thick, and weighs 7.2 g). The Palmillas point is
missing about 40 percent of its distal end and has
an alternately beveled base (3.5 x 2.6 x 0.7 cm in
length, width, and thickness, and weighs 8.4 g).
The Pandale point is missing the distal half but
is very well made with a pronounced corkscrew
bevel. It measures 3.1 x 2.4 x 0.8 cm in length,
width, and thickness, and weighs 7.0 g.
41VV1868
This previously unrecorded site is 30 m west
of 41VV1752. It is an FCR scatter with a few
burned rock features/hearths in the floodplain
of the San Pedro drainage. Two features were
identified. The first, FX-1, is a disturbed but still
partially buried (revealed by probing) hearth measuring 1.5 x 1.5 m. The second feature (FX-2) is
a thin, linear FCR scatter measuring about 1.5 x
0.30 m. This shape may be due to reworking by
1998 floodwaters.
41VV1869
This is a narrow and buried site with FCR and
a hearth located in a cut bank immediately west
and across the channel from and probably contemporaneous with 41VV1751; it was previously
unrecorded. A chert gouge was eroding out of the
hearth in the cut bank, and a chert side scraper/
graver was recovered from the surface.

Johnson and Johnson—Prehistoric Land Use at Amistad National Recreation Area 31
Operation 13
Operation 13 was divided between two crews,
both working in the San Pedro drainage on the
north side of Lake Amistad, west of Highway 277.
The area was accessed by road.
The first crew was led by Jimmy Smith, and
focused on 41VV1207, a hearth field damaged by
sheet wash erosion. Objectives of this crew were
to document exposed features in detail, conduct
test excavations on exposed burned rock features,
and conduct data recovery operations in selected
burned rock features.
The second crew was tasked with surveying
the San Pedro drainage for new sites, recording
and documenting new sites, relocating known
sites, and selecting the best sites to document
exposed features in detail. Twenty-nine sites were
previously recorded within this operation.
41VV1207
This site is an expansive hearth field, 90 x 265
m in size. The site contains 43 recorded features,
including possible house structures, slab-lined
basin-shaped hearths, ovens with basins, and
perhaps ovens without basins. Radiocarbon dates
on two of the basin-shaped hearths placed them
within Turpin’s (1991) Blue Hills subperiod of the
terminal Late Archaic. Diagnostic projectile points
found at the site date from the Late Paleoindian to
Late Prehistoric period. Excavations at this site are
reported in detail in a separate section below.
41VV1768
This site was mapped and the site file updated.
The site is on a large, low terrace on the west side
of an unnamed secondary tributary of San Pedro
Creek. This site has both prehistoric and historic/
modern occupations.
The prehistoric component consists of 18+
hearths, 10+ FCR scatters on a series of low terraces, and 5+ BRMs. Several of the hearths and
middens have a distinctly circular form. A Pandale
dart point was recorded at the site in 1996.
The site also contains the rock foundations of a
ca. 1950s ranch house and barn with associated water troughs and trash pile. The 1999 TAS fieldwork
at this site focused on documenting and mapping
these features. Glass, china, horseshoes, and various bottles were observed in the trash pile, and a

medicine bottle was observed at the “kitchen” area
at the southwest corner of the house.
Operation 14
Operation 14 also took place in the San Pedro
drainage on the North side of Lake Amistad west
of Highway 277. The area is downstream of the
Operation 13’s hearth field (41VV1207) and was
accessed by road. The objective of Operation 14
was to dig a geological/archeological test trench
across the valley near 41VV1770. Crew Chief for
this project was Tom Gustavson.
Site 4VV1770 lies in the cut bank at the north
end of an unnamed secondary drainage of San Pedro Creek. It is an isolated BRM and lithic scatter
exposed and heavily impacted by erosion.
While no diagnostic artifacts were found in
the trenching, Operation 14 demonstrated that
stratified, buried sites existed along smaller drainages and not only in the major canyons.
Operation 15
Operation 15 encompassed the south side of
Amistad Reservoir, west of the Highway 277 Hunt
Area. The area was accessible by road. The survey area included 11 known sites: 41VV428-429,
41VV767, 41VV1222-1224, and 41VV1754-1758.
Sites 41VV428, 41VV1755, and 41VV1758 were
not relocated. The following sites had their files
updated and/or were mapped, but no new features
or diagnostic artifacts were observed: 41VV429,
41VV767, 41VV1222-1224, 41VV1754, and
41VV1756-1757.
41VV1862
A previously unrecorded site, 41VV1862 is
a flat, level, and somewhat rocky open campsite
and lithic scatter on a ridge top west of 41VV429.
No features were observed, but some scattered
FCR was present. A quartzite mano/hammerstone
was noted, and several chipped stone tools were
collected. These included a spokeshave, a drill, two
biface fragments (one appears to be part of a dart
preform, the other perhaps part of a wide drill or
narrow point), and a uniface. Two projectile points
were found. The first of these was a Langtry point
missing 25 percent of the distal end, measuring
3.8 cm long, 2.4 cm wide, and 0.6 cm thick; it
weighed 7.5 g. The second projectile point (with

32

characteristics of both the Ensor and Frio types) was
missing only one basal ear (4.1 x 2.1 x 0.5 cm in

mowing action. Students also observed that it was
a camp area and that people could have moved
rocks on the surface; and (c) why do people camp
here now? Long discussion followed on modern
camping habits. Why would Indians choose to
camp here? Why would Indians build a fire? Why
would everyone choose to build a fire within a
stone circle? What can hearths tell us about people
and their technology?
41VV1743

41VV1877
41VV1877 is a previously unrecorded lithic
scatter on a hilltop above and running parallel to
San Pedro creek. There is a panoramic view of the
canyon below. Many of the flakes observed had
been retouched. Three pieces of a highly polished
grainy red quartzite ground stone tool were also
found, probably a mano.
Operation 16
Operation 16 encompassed the San Pedro
Campground area. Objectives were to survey the
campground for new sites, and to conduct educational test excavations (the Youth Dig) at an
exposed burned rock feature in a mowed, grassy
area of the campground. This area was included
in 41VV1743, although this prehistoric site is in
fact more than 0.75 miles to the north.
Assistant Crew Chief for the excavations was
Joan Few, and her notes show that this fieldwork
accomplished something far more important than
the site’s artifact assemblage—a few pull-tabs and
such—might suggest: introducing archeology to a
new generation!
The first day began with an introductory
lecture about why we do archeology—what are
we looking for, and what questions do we want
to answer? The following questions and objectives for excavations were established: (a) are the
rocks on the surface a cultural feature? A hearth?
Students concluded that for features 1, 2, and 3
the surface information was not enough to make
an identification. In Feature 4, students could see
burned rock in a loose circle, as well as a can,
a metal fragment, and a burned lime fruit, suggesting a modern hearth used fairly recently; (b)
has the area been disturbed? Students observed
that the area had been mowed and that all around
the area there were broken rocks, possibly from

Four 2 x 2 m excavations were opened over
features within the San Pedro tent camping area.
The four 1x 1 m quadrants of each of these were
labeled from the southwest corner clockwise as
A, B, C, and D.
All rocks of the four exposed features were
mapped, and Features 1, 2, and 4 were photographed, showing the surface before excavation.
Grasses were then cut (not pulled). The units were
photographed again before excavation.
Excavations of half of the historic hearth
(FX4) revealed that there was no subsurface
component of the hearth and no prehistoric hearth
below (Figure 16). This hearth contained only
modern/historic artifacts such as pull-tabs, cans,
and metal. The other excavated features (FX1,
FX2, and FX3) proved to be no more than FCR
scatters without intact structure. No prehistoric
artifacts were recovered from the 1999 TAS youth
excavations at this site.
41VV272
41VV272 is recorded as a large, discontinuous,
but thin open midden in and around the stock pen

Campground).

Johnson and Johnson—Prehistoric Land Use at Amistad National Recreation Area 33
about 1 mile west of the old Brite Ranch house. It
is important to note that the work performed by the
1999 TAS field school at “41VV272” took place at
the old ranch house, not at 41VV272 proper. The
Brite Ranch house site consists of several concrete
house foundations and concrete pads, water troughs,
barn structures, and a cistern dated 1950 adjacent to a
well and windmill foundation. Minimal disturbance
was noted, and the 41VV272 site file was updated
to include the ranch house (Future investigations
should record the old ranch house as a separate site
and distinguish it from the original VV272 open
midden). Several historic artifacts were collected
from the surface around the ranch house:
Specimen 1: Base of large clear glass
jar with “345-128” centered below the
cursive “Ball” mark. Below that and
centered is an “H9.” Some iridescence
in glass; Specimen 2: Jar or jug base?
with cursive “Duraglas” mark on the side
above the base. To the right of this is “E
2_ _ _”; the last three digits are unclear.
The first missing position is either 3, 5, or
9. The second missing position is either 1
or 7. The last position could be an 3, 5, 6,
8, or 9 – but whichever it is, it is different
from the number in the first missing position. On the base and opposite “Duraglas”
is a “1” with a circle around it. Another
“1” is directly above this, and to the left is
a “0;” Specimen 3: Jar mouth, clear glass
with lightly textured shoulders. Threaded
for screw-top, no markings. Inside diameter of jar mouth is 6.0 cm, outside diameter 6.3 cm; Specimen 4: Top of clear
glass bottle, appears to have mold lines.
Iridescence on surface. Narrow (4 mm)
opening, threaded for screw cap. Neck
about 2.4 cm diameter; and Specimen 5:
Two fragments of clear insulator glass.
One has an embossed “Hemingray” on it
and the other has “Made in U.S.A.” with
“33” centered below; outside diameter
about 10 cm.

These artifacts are consistent with the 1950
date on the cistern and what one might expect from
a mid-20th century domestic ranch structure.

33 percent of a circle consisting of 11 rocks 50-75
percent buried in the ground; 2 m north of this is a
grouping of five unburied stones. To the northeast
of the circle is a large (25 cm across) rock. Eighteen
m northeast of the circle are five more large stones,
evenly spaced in a row and also 50-75 percent
buried. Thirty meters to the east-southeast are six
large rocks scattered in a wide arc.
41VV1861
This previously unrecorded site has a surface
burned rock hearth of unknown age on San Pedro
peninsula, but it appears to be intact. Only burned
rock was observed, with no debitage or diagnostics.
Operation 17
Operation 17 encompassed the west side of
the Devils River from Buoy J to Satan Canyon.
The area was accessed by boat. The survey area
included 22 known sites: 41VV455, 41VV671,
1463-1464, 1660, 1665, 1696-1703, 1709-1711,
1716, 1720-1721, 1740, and 41VV1769. Of
these, 41VV671, 41VV1463-1464, 41VV1698,
41VV1700-1703, 41VV1709-1710, 41VV1716,
41VV1720-1721, 41VV1740, and 41VV1769 were
not visited. It is unclear if sites 41VV1660 and
41VV1665 were visited by the TAS.
41VV455
This is a rocky terrace site on the north side
of a tributary to the Devils River with many rocks
and boulders. Large midden deposits and scattered
hearth features are present here. Artifacts observed
included a possible pestle, numerous manos, one
core, one perform, and much debitage. One Ensor
dart point was collected from the surface, missing 0.8 cm of the distal tip (4.5 x 2.6 x 0.8 cm in
length, width, and thickness, and it weighs 9.2 g).
It is made on a curved flake, and is probably a
manufacturing failure.
41VV1696, 41VV1697, and 41VV1711
Site files were updated on these three sites.

tertiary flakes, some of which are edge-modified
and some thermally altered). No wikiup or tipi
rings were noted, but the present elliptical shape
of the midden and the spatial distribution of
artifacts may be the result of wave action, as
the midden is often inundated by the waters of
Lake Amistad. Two cores, three manos, and five
bifacial performs were observed. One Montell
dart point was collected from the surface of this
site, missing its tip and one “foot” of the base. It
is a manufacturing failure, as it was not pressureflaked above the base, which was finished first;
length: 4.6 cm, width: 3.2 cm, thickness: 0.9 cm,

the Shumla and Coñejo types with a short, narrow contracting stem, basal notches, and convex
lateral edges. Perhaps the most interesting object
from this site is a complete Angostura dart point
(Figure 18) that appears to have been resharpened
while hafted, as evidenced by alternate beveling
on the distal end and a corresponding change in
the angle of the lateral edges.

This previously unrecorded site consists of at least
15 hearths, a lithic scatter, and at least three BRMs,
the largest measuring about 18 x 9 m. The hearths are
located around and between the BRMs. No wikiup or
tipi rings were noted here. No artifacts were collected,
but the distal end of a knife, a large possible perform,
and modified flakes were observed.
41VV1881
41VV1881 is previously unrecorded. This site
consists of at least five hearths and two possible
wikiup rings measuring approximately 2.6- 2.8
m across, each with a large rock in the center and
a possible opening to the east-southeast. The site
is on a bluff on the west side of the Devils River.
There is a light scatter of debitage throughout the
site.

Two projectile point fragments were collected
(both of apparently the same type) resembling

Operation 18
Operation 18 was a mirror-image of Operation
17, stretching along the east side of the Devils
River from Buoy J to Satan Canyon. The area was
accessed by boat. The survey area included 38
known sites: 41VV11, 41VV15-18, 41VV20-28,
41VV44, 41VV46, 41VV764, 41VV766, 41VV796,

41VV1548, 41VV1550, 41VV1694-1695,
41VV1704, and 41VV1706-1707. Documentation
on the following sites was updated: 41VV44,
41VV46, 41VV1444, 41VV1470, 41VV1495,
41VV1548, 41VV1550, 41VV1694, 41VV1704,
and 41VV1707.
Operation 19
Operation 19 included Harlows Horrors and
the railroad bed along the north shore of Lake
Amistad east of Highway 90. The area was accessed by boat. The survey area included four
known sites, 41VV5-7 and 41VV1215. Of these,
sites 41VV5-7 were underwater during the 1999
investigations and not visited.

The site form was updated for this site.

flood deposits that were visible at approximately
60 cm and 170 cm bs; she noted that the depth of
these archeological materials was not an indication
of great age due to the potential for rapid burial in
this setting.
Gustavson and Collins (1998:37) examined
the stratigraphy of the 4 m deep borrow pit in
greater detail and reported as many as five buried
soils and seven different probable hearth features.
Two of these hearth features contained charcoal,
and a charcoal sample (Beta-108178) from the
uppermost hearth (at a depth of ca. 1.5 m bs)
produced a conventional radiocarbon age of 660
± 50 BP (Gustavson and Collins 1998:37). An
Ensor dart point was found in the wall borrow pit
stratigraphic section number 5 at a depth of about
1.25 m (Gustavson and Collins 1998:37). This
upper hearth is the midden excavated by the 1999
TAS field school.
The lower hearth is buried at a depth of about 2
m and is a lens (or basin)-shaped feature about 1 m
across. It contained 30 cm of wood ash, charcoal,
and sediment, and the underlying terrace sediments
had been reddened by heating and oxidation. Two
radiocarbon samples were taken from this feature,
returning conventional dates of 1320 ± 40 B.P. on
wood ash and 1250 ± 50 B.P. on charcoal (Gustavson and Collins 1998:37). Another, as yet undated
hearth is present 1.5 m below this hearth (i.e., ca.
3.5 m bs).

Excavations

This is a previously unrecorded quarry site on
a large knoll littered with cores and broken pieces
of chert.

Field school excavations targeted the upper
hearth that Gustavson and Collins (1998) had dated
to a conventional radiocarbon age of 660 ± 50 B.P.
The 1999 TAS site map showed the midden to be
elliptical in form, extending along the terrace about
3 m from where it was truncated by the southeast

EXCAVATIONS AT 41VV661
Site Overview and Stratigraphy
41VV661 is a BRM located on a terrace along
the north side of the Rio Grande at the confluence of
a small side canyon, about 100 m from the present
channel of the river. Most of this midden was
destroyed by the excavation of a borrow pit during
railroad construction. The TAS excavations at this
site were undertaken to learn what kinds of artifacts
were associated with this buried midden. The site
record form filled out by Solveig Turpin in 1984
indicated two separate occupation levels buried by

face of the borrow pit (Figure 19). Based on the
curvature of the ellipse, the original dimensions of
the midden may have been about 5 x 1.5 m.
The remaining portion of the midden was
divided into six excavation units. Units 5 and 6
along the edge of the borrow pit had slightly irregular shapes. The southern edge of Unit 5 was
about 1.5 m long, extending west to the edge of
the borrow pit. Unit 6 had no northwest corner.
Units 1-4 were back from the edge of the borrow
pit and were 1 x 1 m squares.
While we did not locate paperwork explicitly
stating this, it appears that the top 30 cm (levels
1-6) of overburden above the midden were removed and discarded. Below that, all units were
excavated primarily in 5 cm arbitrary levels
(with exceptions noted below) and the matrix
was dry screened on-site through 1/4-inch and
1/8-inch mesh. Records indicate that the last of
this midden was excavated and removed, but at
least six other buried features remain at the site.
Small amounts of debitage, charcoal, red ochre,
mussel shells, and Rabdotus snails were common
in all units.
Unit 1 (Table 27) was excavated to a depth of 100
cm bs. The most significant finds were a small ceramic
sherd (discussed in more detail below), a small biface
fragment (probably part of the stem of a Perdiz arrow
point), and a burned, fire-fractured mano.
Unit 2 (Table 28) was excavated to a depth of
95 cm bs; level 11 was a 10 cm thick level. This
unit contained a small mano and the bones of hispid
pocket mice. Unit 3 was also excavated to 95 cm
bs. A fire-cracked mano and a modified flake were
found in the lower levels (Table 29).
Unit 4 was excavated to 95 cm bs; level 12 was
discarded. A uniface was found between 60 and 65
cm bs (Table 30).
Unit 5 was excavated to 95 cm bs; levels 7 and
8 were mixed into a single 10 cm level. The lower
levels of Unit 5 contained an incomplete arrow
point (probably Perdiz), and a utilized flake. The
lowest level (level 19, 90-95 cm bs) had two deer
or pronghorn metacarpal fragments (Table 31).
The upper 45 cm (levels 1-9) of Unit 6 were
discarded. Below that, the unit was excavated in 5
cm levels to a depth of 100 cm bs. A uniface was
recovered from 60-65 cm bs (Table 32).
Unit 7 was excavated to 60 cm. The upper 55
cm (levels 1-11) were discarded. The single level
excavated from 55-60 cm bs produced a uniface
and 0.9 g of charcoal (Table 33).

Artifacts
Significant artifacts recovered from the
1999 TAS excavations at 41V661 are grouped
stratigraphically by excavation level (Table 34).
The three diagnostic artifacts from these excavations were all Late Prehistoric types: two Perdiz
points and a ceramic sherd (Figures 20-21). The
plain brown, small (1.5 x 1.5 x 0.6 cm in length,
width, and thickness), triangular body sherd
came from 85-90 cm bs. It is blackened, and has
been smoothed on the exterior, and appears to be
bone tempered. The sherd thickness is within the
4.4-6.2 mm range reported for Toyah phase pottery at San Felipe Springs in Del Rio by Mehalchick et al. (1999:185). Comparing Toyah and Infierno phase bone-tempered pottery from different
Lower Pecos sites using petrographic analysis of
sherd pastes, Mehalchick et al. (1999:188) found
“…no distinctive or even subtle differences that
reasonably may be defined as culturally meaningful between Toyah and Infierno phase pottery in
the Lower Pecos.”
That these artifacts came from the middle and
lower levels of the midden and that no Archaic
period diagnostics were recovered suggests that
this feature dates entirely to the Late Prehistoric.
The 660 ± 50 B.P or A.D. 1240-1340 (at 1 sigma)
radiocarbon date reported by Gustavson and Collins (1998), Perdiz points, and presence of bonetempered pottery suggest this occupation belongs
to the Toyah phase. Toyah culture as redefined by
Johnson (1994:258) for Central Texas dates to
ca. A.D. 1300-1650, and is characterized by four
primary diagnostic artifact types: plainware bonetempered pottery, Perdiz/Clifton arrow points,
steeply beveled end and end/side scrapers, and
beveled knives.
Artifacts and faunal remains indicate that the
prehistoric occupants of this site pursued a broad
range of food resources. The two manos and two
unifaces (not to mention the midden of FCR) indicate that plant resources were being processed
here and that they made up an important part of
the diet. Larger game animals such as deer or
pronghorn were also taken, as well as small rodents and freshwater mussels.
The possibilities for future research at this
site are exciting. It appears that flood events have
created a stratified stack of single component
features at 41VV661. This depositional environment, in combination with site preservation

EXCAVATIONS AT 41VV1207:
THE HEARTH FIELD
Site Overview
41VV1207 is an extensive hearth field (90 x
265 m) down slope of some low hills in a broad
drainage north of San Pedro Canyon before it flows
into the Devils River. The site contains 43 recorded
features, including possible rock house structures,
lined basin-shaped hearths, ovens with basins, and
perhaps ovens without basins. The Crew Chief
for the 41VV1207 excavations was Jimmy Smith,
whose field notes form the basis for much of our
discussion of this site and its features.

The site was chosen for test excavations not
only because of the significant features found there
but because those features were being actively exposed and damaged by sheet wash erosion. Smith
noted that “the site has had at least 10-14 cm of soil
removed since current vegetation appeared” based
on exposed roots and pedestalled rocks, suggesting
that the site may have lost as much as 50 cm since
it was last occupied in prehistoric times. Three test
units excavated in the lowest portion of the site near
some exposed hearths found no artifacts, suggesting
that the original ground surface and any associated shallowly buried components have completely
eroded away. Fortunately, the site probably contains
many other features that remain buried, one of which

was discovered by a fourth test unit excavated to
a depth of 50 cm bs. Another buried feature was
observed eroding out of a cut bank along the west
side of the wash at a depth of perhaps 30-50 cm bs
during a visit to the site in 2006 with Joe Labadie.
Geoarcheological trenching performed by Gustavson and Collins (2000) further down the drainage
near 41VV1770 showed that small drainages (and
specifically this one) have preserved stratified, buried sites.
Previous documentations of the site recorded
a mano, cores, thick bifacial performs, and projectile points from several time periods. These points
include Angostura, Pandale, Gower, Langtry,
Montell, Frio, Ensor, and Perdiz types.

Basin-Shaped Slab-Lined
Hearths or Ovens
These thermal features at 41VV1207 are
characterized by a basin lined with rock slabs.
Most of these features were found intact or
partially intact, but some severely deflated
features containing rock slabs are also included
here. If a basin-shaped, slab-lined feature is
discrete with little or no surrounding debris field,
we consider it a hearth. Oven features are typified
by the evident reuse of pieces of FCR and/or by
a debris field including rock scattered upslope.
Both types of features are grouped together here
because the presence of a slab-lined basin is a

Two of these features (FX11 and FX33) were dated
to the Late Archaic, and one contained a Montell
dart point. Another feature (FX21) contained a
biface, a core, and several flakes. Feature FX33
(Figure 22) is an excellent example of this type of
feature at this site.

Probable Ovens
Features identified as ovens lack a slab-lined
basin but typically contain a central concentration
of FCR surrounded in all directions (including
upslope) by a lighter scatter of FCR. This is
consistent with the removal of debris during earth
oven clean-out and re-use. Moreover, features
identified as ovens may contain reused pieces of
FCR, indicated by the absence of fragments around
in situ pieces. Rocks function as heat reservoirs in
earth ovens, helping to maintain oven temperature
for the long cooking time (48 hours or more)
needed for some plant foods (Dering 1999). They

they are too small to effectively retain and radiate

1999 TAS investigations.
FX9 is 3 x 2 m in size, with dispersed FCR
around a dense central concentration (85 cm diameter). It is considered an oven due to its size
and the fact that the rock scatter extends upslope
as well as downslope from the core.
FX15 measures 3 x 2 m, with a central concentration measuring 1.6 x 1.4 m. Burned earth is
present at the center of the feature, suggesting that
a fire was built underneath the rocks. Although
excavation failed to reveal a basin, the burned

earth beneath the rocks is otherwise consistent
with earth oven construction as described by
Dering (1999). The feature was evidently reused,
indicated by the presence of FCR found in situ
without matching fragments present from initial
cracking. The lower third of this feature had
been eroded away by the adjacent wash and been
strewn for some distance.
FX25 is 4 x 2 m in size, but it is very dispersed. No rocks remain clearly in place, although
some may be; enough large rocks are nearby for
this feature to possibly represent a structure, but
no well-defined clusters or shape are evident.
FX43 measures about 4 x 2 m. Half of this

Dispersed, no central basin visible. Debris field extends 1 m down slope.
20-25 pieces of fire-cracked rock (FCR) with no discernible form.
Cluster of 10-12 pieces of FCR.
Only a few rocks visible. In erosional wash 2.8 m NE of hearth FX21.
Large, dispersed hearth with 11-20 m debris field. Only 3-4 rocks appear
to remain in place.
Concentrated FCR; not excavated.
Similar to FX27, located 10 m to west; 10-12 concentrated pieces of FCR
exposed.
Similar to nearby FX 27 and FX28. Erosional damage, no clear shape.
Small hearth, probably similar to FX27, FX28, and FX29; not uncovered.
No debris field. Erosional damage; not mapped or cleaned. 6-8 m west of
FX33.
Light FCR scatter surrounding 30 cm concentrated core that may be in
place; highly eroded.

FX3 measures 4 m in diameter. This feature is
probably the rubble field from a dispersed hearth
and is no longer an intact feature.
FX5 measures 2.5 x 1m. This feature is located
on a high point of land between wash areas, and no
discrete concentrations of FCR remain.
FX6 is 8 m diameter. This feature does not appear intact, and debris from this feature is widely
scattered. The debris field may include some material from FX7, located 30 m upslope.
FX8 measures 4 m in diameter. No intact
deposits remain visible; this feature is probably a
dispersed hearth. Some lithics are present on the
surface. A debris field extends about 3 m beyond
the more concentrated FCR.
FX13 consists of 8-10 pieces of FCR on the
surface of a wash area, with no visible concentration. These FCR may be associated with rock ring
FX14 or FCR scatter FX17.
FX17 is a burned rock scatter located in a
heavily eroded wash. Some rocks in this feature may
be in place. It is possible that this feature represents
a hearth associated with structure FX41.
FX26 measures 4 m in diameter. This feature is
very dispersed and no central concentration remains.

FX31 is 7 x 15 m in size, and it is a large
FCR scatter over an eroded area. There appear to
be three concentrations of FCR within FX31, but
no distinct separate features. This feature was not
mapped, but it was photographed showing one
concentration, then photographed again showing
all three concentrations and surrounding scatter.
FX36 is a burned rock scatter inside and outside house structure FX39. It is possible that this
feature represents a dispersed hearth that had been
constructed adjacent to the structure.
Rock Ring Features
The presence of structures at 41VV1207 is
suggested by rings of large rocks that presumably
would have anchored poles for tipis or wikiups.
These circles are often made up of pairs of opposed stones, a pattern typical of Late Prehistoric
Infierno phase occupations at other sites in the
region (Turpin 1995:552). It is common for the
rock rings at 41VV1207 to be made from six
stones (three pairs of opposed stones).
These features were determined on the
following basis: First, rocks of this size show little

Johnson and Johnson—Prehistoric Land Use at Amistad National Recreation Area 47
downslope movement at this site, so groupings of
them are most likely the result of human activity
rather than natural processes. One or two rocks
may have moved 1-2 m. Second, some of the rocks
are out of place geologically, suggesting that they
were transported and positioned by people. Third,
groupings of large rock most often form a circle or
semi-circle, whereas other (presumably naturally
occurring) rocks on the site appear randomly
spaced and are not clustered, much less arranged in
a patterned way. Lastly, the sizes of rocks, and the
sizes of the circles they are arranged in, are fairly
consistent within this site, excepting the unusually
small FX42 (Table 37).
Feature FX14 is a large rock concentration in a
wash on the lower end of the site, 15 m to the east of
midden/oven feature FX15. These rocks are geologically out of place, and did not wash to this location,
although their positions appear to have been altered
by flooding. This highly disturbed feature measures
6.4 m north-south x 9.9 m east-west.
Feature FX18 is a rock ring with an interior
diameter of 5.5 m, located between rock ring structures FX39 and FX42. It is composed of six rocks,
with two out of place, and no associated hearths.
Feature FX39 is a ring of large rocks, about
4.5 m in diameter. The soil inside the rock ring is
darker than the surrounding area, suggesting the
presence of archeological deposits marking a living surface. This feature was mapped and shot in
with the TDS. Test Unit 4 was placed within this
feature and excavated to a depth of 50 cm bs by
Michael Williams and Andy Malof. The test unit
produced buried deposits evidencing an earlier
occupation of the site. Overlapping burned rock
scatter feature FX36 may represent remnants of a

hearth originally located adjacent to this feature.
One broken biface, the base of a Langtry dart point,
was collected from the surface.
Feature FX40 is a large ring of seven rocks
about 4.5 m in diameter. Probably a tipi ring,
this feature also conforms to the six stone (three
pair) construction pattern, except that one support
location has two smaller rocks where one larger
rock normally would have been. Two of the seven
rocks are out of place, apparently due to erosion.
This site was mapped and shot in with a TDS. A
non-diagnostic dart point fragment was collected
that was found standing on end in the wash to the
northwest. Burned rock scatter (dispersed hearth?)
FX 26 is located 5 m to the southwest of this structure.
Feature FX41 is a large rock concentration
that appears geologically out of place. This feature
measures 6 m north-south x 10 m east-west, and
was shot in with the TDS. It may represent one
highly disturbed group of rocks, or rocks from
two adjacent structures along and truncated by the
wash. In the wash and to the west of feature FX41,
burned rock scatter FX17 may represent an associated hearth.
Feature FX42 is a small structure about 2.5 m
in diameter, made up of six apparently in situ large
rocks arranged in a semicircle. No hearths are visible in the area. This feature was mapped with the
TDS and on paper.
Lithics
Crew Chief Smith noted that bifaces were
found on the surface near many of the hearths (but
not collected) and that cores were common. Only

three diagnostic projectile points were found at
41V1207 during the 1999 TAS field school. No
ground stone implements were found during the
1999 investigations.
Two rock features had lithic debitage:
FX39, with 167.7 g of debitage (the numerical
ratio of primary to secondary to interior flakes
is 1:15:108), and FX11, with 1.2 g of unmodified debitage (two interior flakes). Two features
also had bifaces and/or biface fragments. Feature
FX39 had five biface fragments, one a Langtry

dart point base and another reused as a scraper.
Feature FX2 had one crude, battered, and chunky
biface.
The two projectile points found in addition to
the aforementioned Langtry dart point base from
near FX39 are described in Table 38. A Cuney or
Scallorn arrow point (Figure 23) was found on the
surface about 10 m west of thermal feature FX1.
It is very well made, but missing one barb. If the
identification of the point as a Cuney is accurate,
its occurrence in the Lower Pecos is well west

of the typical distribution of this type (Turner
and Hester 1999:210). A Montell dart point was
found in association with feature FX11 (Figure
24). Montell is a Late Archaic type estimated to
date from 1000 B.C.-A.D. 200 (Turner and Hester
1999:157).
Radiocarbon Dates
Large samples of charcoal were obtained for
radiometric dating from two of the best-preserved
thermal features, FX11 and FX33 (see Table 1).
While both samples had some dirt adhering to them,
they appeared to be solid wood charcoal and enough
was present for conventional radiometric dating.
The charcoal from feature FX11 came from
matrix samples labeled “from hearth basin,”
and weighed approximately 17.6 g. This sample
ANRA-4 (Beta-140484) returned a conventional
radiocarbon age of 2040 ± 60 B.P. Calibrated, this
corresponds to an age range of 2140-1870 B.P.
at 2 sigma, or 190 B.C. to A.D. 80. This date is
consistent with the Late Archaic Montell dart point

The site appears to have been used most intensely during the Late Archaic, but diagnostic projectile
points found here indicate an aboriginal presence at
this location from Late Paleoindian times through the
Late Prehistoric. The Late Paleoindian occupation
is represented by an Angostura dart point collected
from the surface during the site’s initial recording in
1988. Early Archaic Pandale and Gower dart points
were also recovered from the surface during that
investigation. The Middle Archaic is represented
by three Langtry points; one was collected in 1988,
another is the Langtry base found during the 1999
TAS field school, and the third is a complete point
that the authors observed and photographed at the
site in 2006.
The time period represented by the most projectile points, and with both radiocarbon dates,
is the Late Archaic. A Montell dart point, an Ensor, and two Frio points were found in the 1988
recording. Another Montell point was found during the 1999 TAS field school associated with a
basin-shaped and slab-lined hearth feature FX11,
with a calibrated radiocarbon age of 190 B.C.A.D. 80. This radiocarbon date falls within, but
at the very end of, the 1000 B.C-A.D. 200 age
range reported for Montell points by Turner and
Hester (1999:157). A second basin-shaped and
slab-lined hearth feature, FX33, has a calibrated
radiocarbon date of A.D. 440-670. Both this date
and the date for feature FX11 fall within Turpin’s
(1995:549-550) Blue Hills subperiod (2300-1300
B.P.). This raises the possibility that the other
similar slab-lined basin hearths (and by extension
perhaps a good number of the less well-preserved
thermal features) at 41VV1207 date to the same
period of prehistoric occupation.
Ecologically, the Blue Hills subperiod may
have been a return to arid conditions following the
relatively mesic 3150-2300 B.P. Cibolo subperiod
of the Late Archaic (Turpin 1995:548-549). During

50

the Cibolo subperiod, buffalo had re-entered the
region, evidenced most dramatically in Bonebed 3
at Bonfire Shelter (Dibble and Lorrain 1968), and
with the herds had come hunters bearing Montell
and Castroville style dart points. These hunters
apparently left with the buffalo when the climate
became arid again, and the Lower Pecos was reoccupied during the Blue Hills subperiod by people
from the deserts of northern Mexico (Turpin 1995).
This is suggested by the appearance of Shumla
style dart points, a type that may have originated
in Nuevo Leon, Mexico, and that was apparently
in use there from 3100 B.P. to 1850 B.P. (Turpin
1991), although dates on this point type from
sites north of the Rio Grande are presently more
uncertain (Turpin 1995). A decline in the use of
Shumla points after 2300 B.P. corresponds with
the appearance of Ensor and Frio dart points. These
are common terminal Archaic types found across
Central, South, and West Texas (Prewitt 1995),
and characterize the latter part of the Blue Hills
subperiod in the Lower Pecos.
The increased proportion of unifaces at many
upland sites with Late Archaic dart points suggests
an increased reliance on desert plant resources during this time (Turpin 1995:549). This is supported
by coprolite evidence from Hinds Cave, where the
percentage of coprolites containing bone fragments
dropped from 97% in Middle Archaic samples to
64% during the late Middle Archaic and to only
53% during the Late Archaic (Saunders 1992:338).
It is not surprising then that radiocarbon dates from
slab-lined basin-hearth features (likely earth ovens
associated with cooking plant foods) at 41VV1207
fall in the Late Archaic.
This dietary shift accompanies a change in
settlement patterns, which Turpin (1995:556)
interprets as a response to drying conditions.
Settlements would have been concentrated near
water and mobile task groups fanned out into the
uplands to collect and process plant and animal
resources. Site 4VV1207 may represent such a satellite processing site, but the numbers of projectile
points suggest it may have been used by hunters
as well. The lack of mussel shell in the excavated
hearths at 41VV1207 is also consistent with this
interpretation, in that it suggests that resources are
not being transported from sites nearer water to the
site, although this may simply be the result of poor
preservation.
As indicated by Table 37, the rock ring structures
of 41VV1207 appear to be mostly tipis, with one

possible wikiup or small tipi. The possible wikiup
is only 2.5 m across, but is set up as a tipi with six
widely spaced rocks. In the field school manual, Collins et al. (1999:5) advised field school participants
that tipi rings are typically large structures up to 8 m
or more in diameter with relatively few rocks widely
spaced bracing the large poles. Wikiup rings, on the
other hand, tend to be 2-3 m in diameter with a more
continuous ring of smaller rocks.
None of the thermal features at 41VV1207 are
located at the center of any of the house structure
rock rings. This reinforces the idea that the hearth
features may date to an earlier time and pattern of
land use than the rock rings. Similar rings of paired
stones in the region are typically attributed to the
Infierno phase (ca. 450-250 B.P.), although none
have been securely dated. Infierno phase sites tend
to be found on promontories, while 41VV1207 is
in a wash. Moreover, the Perdiz style arrow points
found here previously suggest an occupation by
Toyah phase people rather than intrusive Infierno
phase populations.
Alternately, if the house structures are contemporaneous with the terminal Late Archaic
hearths, the site may represent a precursor of the
type of occupation that was to follow. Further investigations will be necessary to unlock this site’s
mysteries, ideally with the excavation of an intact
buried ground surface with both a house structure
and datable thermal features.
That may not be too much to hope for. While
many of the exposed features at this site have
been badly eroded, some remain largely intact and
still others—probably quite a few—remain safely
buried. This site has great archeological research
potential and remains at risk to erosion. Areas of
this site may lend themselves to remote sensing
methods that could help to locate intact buried
thermal features or house structures. Excavation of
such buried features and associated living surfaces
may yield significant archeological information,
particularly if radiocarbon dates or in situ diagnostic projectile points were found in association with
a house structure.

FIELD SCHOOL CONCLUSIONS
The 1999 Texas Archeological Society (TAS)
field school was a success on many levels. The
Society’s efforts produced more information
about Late Prehistoric open sites with rock rings

Johnson and Johnson—Prehistoric Land Use at Amistad National Recreation Area 51
and ceramics, and generated a large amount of
data on other kinds of sites as well through the
survey and documentation work that was done.
The archeomagnetic testing performed during the
field school at a number of features at various sites
found that “…these sites retained their archeological value, at least in terms of their magnetic
signature, in spite of having been covered by the
waters of Amistad Reservoir” (Gose in Gustavson
and Collins 2000:30).
By also assessing potential impacts to sites
from threats such as grazing domestic livestock,
invasive clams, wave action, looting, and flood
events, the field school has provided the NPS with
the tools and information it needs to protect the
fragile cultural resources within Amistad NRA.
Furthermore, the field school provided educational and experiential opportunities for the youth
and adult members of the TAS as well as research
opportunities for graduate students.
A majority of the Late Prehistoric open sites
given special attention by the TAS field school
(with the notable exception of 41VV446) are located along alluvial terraces. Terrace sites even in
small drainages were shown to have the potential
to contain preserved and intact features (Gustavson and Collins 2000), with little admixture of
materials from older or more recent occupations,
allowing the association of specific types of features with diagnostic artifacts, other associated
remains, and radiocarbon dates.
Turpin (1995:550) has stated that ring middens consistently date to the Late Prehistoric
period, and identifies them as the signature of pit
ovens used for cooking desert succulents such
as lechugilla and sotol. We had hoped that the
feature dataset from the TAS field school would
allow the identification of other such temporally
diagnostic and activity-specific types of thermal
features. That has proven not to be the case, unfortunately, but radiocarbon dates from individual
thermal features do allow us to state that certain
types of features were being used at specific
points in time. Perhaps future research can mesh
these data with existing archeological data from
other investigations in the region to provide a
more robust dataset from which clearer patterns
of prehistoric feature use will emerge.
The oldest features dated during the 1999 TAS
field school were slab-lined basin-shaped hearths
(ovens) FX11 and FX33 at 41VV1207. These both
dated to the Late Archaic, and a Montell dart point

was found in association with FX11. This type
of feature remains in use in the area late into the
Late Prehistoric period, as evidenced by FX4 at
41VV1752, also a slab-lined feature. AMS dating
of this feature returned a 2 sigma calibrated age
range of A.D. 1445-1645. One might be inclined
to question this calibrated date from 41VV1752
given that a Fairland dart point was found in the
feature, were it not for the date from another nearby feature at the site. This other feature (FX2) is a
flat, rectangular hearth with a calibrated AMS age
range of A.D. 1470-1660. Two different kinds of
thermal features are present at 41VV661 and both
were previously dated by Collins and Gustavson
(1998:37). The oldest of these was an unlined
basin hearth radiocarbon-dated by two charcoal
samples to ca. 1320 B.P. and ca. 1250 B.P (A.D.
630-700). The more recent was the midden dated
660 B.P. (A.D. 1290) and subsequently excavated
by the TAS field school.
Rock ring structures usually considered either tipi or wikiup rings are present at a number
of sites in the area. One thrust of the 1999 site
documentation fieldwork performed at the TAS
Field School was to be on the look-out for these
features, which are easily obscured by vegetation or disturbed by natural processes and human
impacts. Collins et al. (2000:11) report that at
Infierno Camp (41VV446), the inside diameters
of wikiup rings range from 1.5-3 m, and that tipi
rings range from about 4.5-7 m in diameter. At
this site the 1999 TAS field school recorded 124
wikiup rings (with an additional 15 or more observed but not yet mapped) and seven tipi rings
(Collins et al. 2000:11-12).
At 41VV1723, a total of 20 rock rings or features were recorded and mapped. Of these, six were
classified as tipi rings and only one as a wikiup ring,
with 10 unspecified rock rings. Comparing sites
like 41VV1723 and 41VV661 with Infierno Camp
(41VV446) may highlight the similarities and differences between occupations by Toyah phase groups
in the Lower Pecos and the similar but different
Infierno phase occupations. Ethnohistorical accounts
document winter through spring buffalo hunts in
the vicinity of the confluence of the Pecos with the
Rio Grande by native groups (Wade 2003:57), and
by large camps of intrusive Athabaskan-speaking
peoples such as the Apache and Comanche (Kenmotsu and Wade 2002:124), activities that Turpin
(1995:553) believes may be responsible for Infierno
phase sites.

52

Texas Archeological Society

The rock ring structures present at 41VV1207
consist of five tipis and one possible wikiup. The
possible wikiup ring is unusual, however, in that
even though it has a diameter of only 2.5 m it is
constructed of six widely-spaced large rocks like a
tipi rather than the near-continuous arc of stones that
are typical of wikiups at other sites in the area.
While Middle Archaic dart points (and some
Early Archaic types) are not uncommon at these
sites, the dominance of Late Archaic and Late
Prehistoric diagnostic artifacts, radiocarbon dates,
and structure types from such sites may at first
glance give the impression that people in older
Archaic times rarely saw fit to make camp anywhere but the shaded luxury of their rock shelters.
A more reasonable explanation is that because
terrace sites are prone to flooding from periodic
catastrophic flooding, significantly older occupations have been either deeply buried or eroded
away. It is probable that at many sites the latter
may be the case, as Turpin (1982) reports massive
erosion of deposits at Black Cave in Seminole
Canyon around the onset of the Middle Archaic.
The assortment of artifacts excavated from the
midden at 41VV661 is not terribly unlike the things
recovered from rock shelters: bones of large and
small animals, freshwater mussel shells, grinding
stones, and evidence of cooking with hot rocks.
This suggests (unsurprisingly) that subsistence activities at sites near rivers and streams were broadly
similar in prehistoric times along the Lower Pecos
regardless of whether or not there is an overhang
up above. Rock shelters would of course be much
more comfortable in inclement weather, and
thus it seems plausible that some differences in
seasonality of occupations might be observed, although none were evident from these excavations.
Evidence of seasonality is perhaps more likely to
be manifest in differences between riverine and
upland sites, relating to seasonal targeting of particular resources such as the historically observed
winter buffalo hunts. Such a seasonal focus on
animal rather than plant resources may be a factor
in the “striking” low frequency of burned rock at
Infierno Camp noted by Collins et al. (2000:12).
The bone-tempered plainware pottery sherd from
41VV661 is similar to sherds from other Toyah
phase sites in the area, such as San Felipe Springs
(Mehalchick et al. 1999).
Seasonality, or perhaps longer-term climate
changes, may have played a role in the character
of the Late Archaic occupation at 41VV1207. This

site is located fairly high on a colluvial slope above
a small dry wash that feeds into San Pedro Creek.
This location does not provide its occupants with
access to riverine resources such as mussel shells,
fish, or water that would be present at river terrace
sites such as 41VV661 or 41VV1723. What it may
have offered instead was ready access to upland
plant resources, which may have been a least
risk response to environmental degradation. This
adaptive pattern began in the Early Archaic (Brown
1991; Dering 1999) and may have intensified
during the Blue Hills subperiod of the Late Archaic
(Turpin 1995). The hearths and ovens at this site
lack substantial midden accumulation or mussel
shells. This may indicate that 41VV1207 was
not a primary encampment but functioned as a
satellite site, a place where plant-gathering parties
accumulated and processed their harvests before
bringing their products back to a main camp near a
permanent water source, perhaps a rock shelter or a
terrace site like 41VV661. This pattern of resource
collection is suggested for the Late Archaic by
Shafer (1986:96).
The tipi rings and arrow points at 41VV1207
suggest a change in land use with the beginning of
the Late Prehistoric period. As the climate became
more hospitably mesic, this Archaic outpost appears to have changed from being a workplace to
a home, if only a temporary one for highly mobile
people, perhaps buffalo hunters.

The 1977 Texas Archeological Society Investigations
of the Sabina Mountain Number Two Site, 41EP4,
El Paso County, Texas

David G. Robinson, with contributions from John E. Dockall and William L. McClure

ABSTRACT
The 1977 Texas Archeological Society Field School investigated the Sabina Mountain Number Two site
(41EP4), an El Paso phase village in far West Texas. Led by William J. Mayer-Oakes and staff of the Cultural
Resources Institute of Texas Tech University, the field school was designed as an educational field course
rather than a strict research enterprise. The approach to the site employed surface sampling strategies and
subsurface remote sensing. Excavation was limited to sample unit excavations and clearing of discovered
features. The off-site survey also took a sampling approach for purposes of site-settlement analysis. These
methodologies constrained any fine-grained analyses of artifacts and features, but the broader patterns so
identified offer support for current models of prehistoric El Paso phase community and settlement patterns,
arid lands agricultural strategies, and regional participation in social and economic networks.

INTRODUCTION
The 1977 field school of the Texas Archeological Society (TAS) excavated the Sabina Mountain
Number Two site (41EP4) in El Paso County,
Texas. A regional sample survey accompanied the
site excavations. The site is a small village of the
El Paso phase of the Jornada Mogollon tradition.
Conducted chiefly as an educational project rather
than a research investigation, the field school was
directed by the Cultural Resources Institute (CRI)
of Texas Tech University (TTU), headed by Professor William J. Mayer-Oakes. An antiquities permit
issued by the Texas Historical Commission sanctioned the work. This article describes and analyzes
the work of the 1977 field school and presents
limited additional summaries and background on
earlier work at the site by the El Paso Archeological Society (EPAS).
The Sabina Mountain Number Two site is
located in eastern El Paso County on property of

HISTORY OF INVESTIGATIONS
The 1964-1967 El Paso Archeological
Society Investigations

Altogether, the 1964-1967 excavations
accomplished a testing level of investigations, but
without precisely establishing the site limits. Nine
rooms were cleared by this effort. Additionally,
three subsurface features and a trash pit were
investigated. The rock surface pattern proved to
lack any prehistoric cultural remains, and thus
is probably a 20th century construction. Brook
(1980:21) estimated the number of original Pueblo
rooms at the village as between 25 and 50, based
on the EPAS investigations.
The cultural assemblage was comprised of
copious brown ware pottery, chert lithic debris,
and burned rock. A few chert and other stone tools
were recovered, as were a few items of bone,
shell, and turquoise ornamentation. Animal bone
was also found in all contexts. Plant macrofossils
included charred kernels and cob fragments of
maize, charred beans, and small sections of wood
and brushy plant parts (Brook 1980).

The initial phase of recorded excavations took
place in 1964 and 1965 as short weekend and
holiday operations on the site. This campaign was
organized and led by Vernon L. Brook under the
auspices of the EPAS. Crew composition and size
fluctuated as a result of the intermittent nature of this
effort, varying in number between six and 16 people.
Known extant field notes are from September 25 and
26, 1964; December 31, 1964; and November 25,
1965. Brook (1980:15) reported that investigations
continued as time permitted until 1967.

with the CRI was that the project have a teaching/

written on the room excavations,
and photographs were taken of

Outside the rooms, surface
collections were made with reference to a 200 x 10 ft. site grid
system placed over the heaviest
surface concentrations of the site
(Brook 1980:20). In addition to
this large grid system, two smaller
localized metric grid systems
were emplaced over a trash pit
feature and a rock circle for purposes of excavation. Excavation
within these metric grids was by
10 cm levels (Brook 1980:42).

Robinson—The 1977 Investigations of the Sabina Mountain Number Two Site 59
educational emphasis rather than a purely research
orientation. CRI and Professor Mayer-Oakes
observed this stipulation faithfully throughout
the course of the field school. The objectives and
goals of the excavations were stated in detail in
all preparatory material, and the orientation was
clearly enunciated as conservation archeology. In
this theoretical approach to research, a commitment
to non-destructive techniques and preservation of
archeological materials—viewed truly as cultural
resources—is articulated and applied in field archeology. Among other implications of this approach
was the field school’s application of subsurface
remote sensing techniques to help define and characterize significant areas of the site without the use
of large-scale excavations. Under the umbrella of
conservation archeology, Mayer-Oakes and CRI
formulated teaching goals on the theoretical, methodological, and field technical levels.
These goals broke down into three broad areas
of field school activity: (1) site excavation; (2) onsite survey (surface techniques and remote sensing); and (3) off-site survey (site-settlement field
survey). Professor Mayer-Oakes was the project
and field director, and CRI staff supervised the
three areas. Philip Bandy led the site excavations;
John Montgomery conducted the on-site survey;
and Alston Thoms headed the off-site survey.
Given the ambition of these operations, results
and data accumulated enormously by the end of the
week’s fieldwork. In the site excavations, 122 TAS
members excavated a total of 100 1 x 1 m squares.
Previously investigated rooms 2 and 3 were reexcavated to offer training in the excavation of
architecture. Additional contexts and features
discovered by excavation included one extramural
activity area, one refuse-borrow pit, a house floor
previously located by remote sensing, and another
pit incompletely delineated by the end of the field
school (Mayer-Oakes 1979:14).
The on-site survey, conducted by a total of 91
people, focused on two categories of activity. The
first was the surveying, recording, and collecting
of defined travel corridors within the site (Figure
3). This effort mitigated the surface disturbance
caused by the intensive foot-traffic of the large
crew of site researchers. The second on-site survey category was non-corridor surface recording
and collecting. Society members collected open
surfaces by 1 m square collection units in addition
to the corridor samples. Identified or suspected
surface features were sampled also to aid in their

characterization and interpretation. In all, 858 1 x
1 m squares were collected in this project effort.
Additionally, four transects of varying lengths
were mapped onto the site surface and completely
collected regardless of feature/non-feature status.
Some features, especially those of burned rock,
were deemed too dense to collect physically, thus
close-up photogrammetry was employed to record
them. At the end of the on-site survey, a representative sample of the site surface had been gained
by systematic methods, and numerous techniques
had been demonstrated and taught (Mayer-Oakes
1979:14-15).
The off-site survey was a systematic sample
survey of local Hueco Bolson environmental
zones, with emphasis placed on teaching site identification and recording procedures. This branch
of the field school effort was a field exercise in
site-settlement analysis, whereby archeologists
seek to discover ancient patterns of land use and
subsistence practices. Ninety-four field school attendees participated in the survey, which covered
approximately 600 acres by the pedestrian transect
method. Each transect measured 15 m wide but
extended to varying lengths in the progress of the
work. Environmental zones sampled by the survey
included Hueco Bolson flatlands, fields of sand
dunes, arroyos, and ranges of intra-basin hills, or
basin margins.
The survey discovered 37 sites, including
lithic and ceramic scatters, lithic scatters, and
hearth fields. The preponderance of ceramic sites
contained diagnostics indicating prehistoric occupations during the Mesilla or El Paso phases.
Functionally, the lithic and ceramic scatters may

have served as temporary campsites, and lithic
scatters in gravel and sand microenvironments may
have functioned as quarries and workshops. Two
more complex sites were also found, one a probable architectural site belonging to the Dona Ana
phase, and the other was a zone of more than 20
small burned rock middens thought to be part of an
Archaic base camp (Mayer-Oakes 1979:15-16).

SETTING
Physical Setting
The site lies in the Hueco Bolson, an intermontane lowland that is part of the vast Southern
Basin and Range physiographic province of North
America. The province was formed in the tectonic
upheavals of Tertiary times, which raised the
Rocky Mountains and gave western North America the character it displays to this day. Regionally,
the topography is block-faulted mountains alternating with normal-faulted basins filled thickly
with unconsolidated sediments washed out of the
mountains. The mountains expose widespread
limestone formations as well as a wide variety
of igneous rocks. Sandy soils of the Hueco-Wink
association form on the local outwash deposits;
horizons of this soil association are as much as
50 cm thick over caliche, i.e., calcium carbonate
deposits formed in soils with high evapotranspiration rates. Rocks for building and stone tool making outcrop plentifully in the Hueco Mountains to
the east and the Franklin Mountains to the west.
Clay, of many uses, forms and accumulates in
various basin microtopographies.
The Chihuahuan Desert life zone, comprising
many desert-adapted plant and animal species of
taxonomic distinction, overlies this physiography. The site and environs support a prevailing
creosotebush-mesquite community with additional
members of snakeweed, yucca, and cactus species
(Figure 4). Mammals available for hunting are
mule deer, antelope, jackrabbit, cottontail rabbit,
rats, mice, and shrews.
The desert nearby receives in modern times, on
average, variously 7.77 inches of rain (Handbook
of Texas Online 2004), 7.89 inches of rain, or 8.65
inches of rain (Portnoy 1977) annually. All figures
lie well within the limits set for a desert climatic
regime. Most of the rain falls in the summer in
high-intensity thunderstorms accompanied by

Figure 4. Typical ground surface and plant growth.

rapid runoff. Humidity remains low throughout
the year, evaporation is high, and the differences
between day and night temperatures are wide and
fluctuating. Temperature swings are due partially
to the generally high altitude of El Paso County,
from 3500 feet above mean sea level along the Rio
Grande to 7000 feet at the summits of the Franklin
Mountains. The modern growing season is 248
days long. The Sabina Mountain Number Two site
lies more than 500 feet higher than the river, at
4020 feet, and the growing season at the time of
its prehistoric occupation may have fallen short of
248 days by several days or even a few weeks.
Even so, the effective growing season may
have sufficed for many crops, but the amount and
periodicity of rainfall would have been a continuing concern for any aboriginal folk attempting plant
cultivation. Garden cultivation under irrigation is
feasible in all areas away from the river in the modern regime, and water collection and retention would
have been possible at the outwash fans at the base of
mountains and basin margins, and at the mouths of
arroyos in the basin flats (Handbook of Texas Online
2004; Texas Beyond History website 2004).

Robinson—The 1977 Investigations of the Sabina Mountain Number Two Site 61
Cultural Setting
Both the 1964-1967 EPAS and 1977 TAS Field
School excavation campaigns at the Sabina Mountain Number Two site identified it as a Puebloan village of the El Paso phase of the Jornada Mogollon
culture. These attributions place the site occupation
within the conventionally accepted sequence proposed by Lehmer (1948). The investigations also,
with evidence, position the site’s occupation near
the end of the prehistoric period, given the El Paso
phase dates of A.D. 1200 to 1450.
The cultural antiquity of the Hueco Bolson
and wider Jornada Mogollon area, however, extends back before 6000 B.C., and perhaps as early
as 9000 B.C., to the time of Paleoindian hunters
and gatherers. Diagnostic artifacts datable to that
time indicate that the area was used in Paleoindian
times; occupation sites are comparatively rare. The
predominant Paleoindian finds belong to the Folsom complex, with a few from the earlier Clovis
period. A variety of Late Paleoindian projectile
points have been found, including artifacts of the
Angostura, Agate Basin, Cody, Plainview, and
Firstview types. Find spots are typically lower
playa margins, former ponds, and dune blowouts
in which the dominant modern processes are alternating exposure and colluvial/aeolian burial. A
few kill sites, butchering stations, and other small
procurement locales are also known from these
microenvironments. Larger logistical camps or
staging areas have been identified in the mountain
foothills and canyons, and there is suggestive
evidence that regional mountain caves were occasionally used or occupied by Paleoindian people.
Throughout the period, the sites and artifact sets of
the Paleoindians suggest highly mobile societies
with economies directed toward big game hunting
(Carmichael 1985:10-11, 1986:7-11).
Changes in climate, megafauna extinctions,
and the related regionalization of culture gave rise
to the Archaic stage, of great duration in western
North America where it is denoted by the term
Desert Culture. The stage is marked by distinctive
and variable regional adaptations, characteristic of
the entire continent at that period. Wide varieties
of edible and useful plant resources were collected,
especially edible seeds, and the first evidence of
cultivation of plants dates to the latter parts of
this stage (maize and beans; Wills 1988). Seed
gathering, however, is the hallmark of Archaic
economies. The long period was aceramic, with the

exception of a few scattered finds of plain pottery
late in the stage. Ground stone artifacts in a wide
variety of shapes and types are common indicators
of Archaic camps and processing areas. Within
and near the Hueco Bolson and Tularosa basins,
Archaic components are found in rockshelters and
widely distributed small open sites. Near the Rio
Grande, small hamlets with circular pit shelters
have been excavated (O’Laughlin 1980). These
manifestations comprise a regional phase named
the Hueco Basketmaker phase, or simply the Hueco
phase (Brethauer 1977:6), although some have
dropped the appellations altogether as having too
much potential for terminological confusion and
a strong suggestion of influence from Anasazi
Basketmaker regions far to the north (Carmichael
1985:11-13, 1986:11-13).
The Archaic stage persisted regionally until
about A.D. 500-600 and the period of quasi-sedentary horticultural hamlets and villages of pithouses
and other forms of semi-permanent architecture,
and a reliance on ceramic technology. All these
material features are defining elements of the Formative stage. The appearance of these cultural elements inaugurated the first of Lehmer’s sequence
of three phases: the Mesilla phase (A.D. 500-1100),
followed by the Dona Ana (A.D. 1100-1200) and
El Paso (A.D. 1200-1400) phases. The Dona Ana
phase is characterized also by pithouse architecture
with a few surface buildings. The El Paso phase
reflects an area-wide and committed shift to aboveground, contiguous room architecture. Altogether,
Lehmer’s phase sequence describes a branch of the
regionally broad Southwestern Mogollon culture.
The broad outlines of Lehmer’s sequence have
stood up since the 1940s, but recent summaries
of subsequent research have fleshed out the basic framework (Carmichael 1983, 1986; Shafer
et al. 1999). The discovery of Archaic pithouses
(O’Laughlin 1980) caused some redefinition of
the essential features of both earlier and later
manifestations. The origins of the Mesilla phase
were defined simply as the phase marked by the
initial widespread use of ceramics. “In fact, general
similarities to the Archaic with regard to site size,
contents, and distributions suggest that much of
the Mesilla phase represents essentially an Archaic
adaptation with the addition of ceramics” (Carmichael 1985:14).
The growth of pithouse villages in the Dona Ana
phase has been confirmed, as has the appearance of
some above-ground adobe room structures in Dona

62

Ana villages. Originally thought of by Lehmer
(1948) as a transitional period between Mesilla
and El Paso manifestations, the earliest Dona Ana
hamlets show a continuing reliance on hunting
and gathering and only a tentative acceptance of
agricultural products such as maize, beans, and
squash; in other words, these people of the Dona
Ana phase maintained an Archaic economic pattern
with the addition of new architectural elements.
A trend of increasing reliance on agriculture, or
at least agricultural products, gradually reduced
the proportional contribution of wild plants and
animals to the Jornada diet and lifeways, but
these foods were never entirely abandoned. Site
locations near the mouths of canyons and the
bases of alluvial fans suggest some residence near
fields of cultigens planted in zones of higher soil
moisture content. At this time also, the region may
have started participating in the Casas Grandes
Interaction Sphere, centered in the basin and range
of northern Chihuahua (Carmichael 1985:15;
Schaafsma 1979; Wimberly 1979).
By about A.D. 1200, artifact assemblage
changes and a near-total conversion of village domestic architecture to above-ground adobe rooms
on rectilinear patterns brought about what has been
named the El Paso phase. It was a time of population increase, probably marking the prehistoric
maximum population density in the Hueco Bolson.
Remains of maize, beans, and squash are more
common in El Paso phase villages than in earlier
village sites. Settlement locations on upper basin
margins, mountain foothills, and at the mouths of
canyons descending from the mountains, continued from Dona Ana times (Brethauer 1977:6-7).
Villages were also located along the Rio Grande
(Carmichael 1985:16). As El Paso phase society
became more reliant on domesticated foodstuffs,
so did the strength of interregional interactions
and trade. El Paso Brownware pottery appeared in
the early Mesilla phase, but by the El Paso phase
the forms and varieties of this local ware and the
numbers of extra-regional wares had proliferated
greatly, as had amounts of non-local turquoise and
marine shell jewelry (Brethauer 1977:6-7).
In terms of cultural dynamics, these increases
in material and economic complexity corresponded
to the rise in influence and dominance of the
great cultural center of Casas Grandes in northern
Chihuahua. The wide distribution of Chihuahuan
ceramics such as Playas Red Incised and other fine
wares throughout the Jornada Mogollon attests to

this set of relationships. Close interdependence
of the Casas Grandes center with the Jornada
Mogollon hinterland is suggested also by their
closely corresponding terminal dates, namely A.D.
1450 (within the Tardio period at Casas Grandes;
LeBlanc 1980). Major construction ceased at
Casas Grandes at about this time, although people
continued living there, but almost all El Paso phase
villages were abandoned, and regional populations
dropped sharply (Miller 2001:105-108). The
decline was so pronounced that the first European
encounters with native peoples in the 1580s
recorded only a few hunting and gathering groups
in the region (Brethauer 1977:7; Carmichael
1983:17; Miller 2001; Schaafsma 1979; Shafer et
al. 1999; Wimberly 1979).
Settlement Archaeology
in the Hueco Bolson
The prime motivator of settlement archeology
research in the Hueco Bolson has been the cultural
resource assessment requirements of Fort Bliss maneuver areas and ranges. The result has been the
near-total archeological and historical survey of the
Hueco Bolson and a large proportion of the Tularosa
basin immediately to the north in New Mexico. This
work has been primarily site survey and analysis and
parallel studies; altogether it has heavily influenced
current understandings of the prehistoric cultural
traditions of the Jornada Mogollon.
Whalen (1977, 1978), in two projects, surveyed wide areas of the Hueco Bolson. Carmichael
(1986) later investigated the Tularosa Basin. Table
1 summarizes their work, especially regarding the
numbers of El Paso phase sites found during each
survey effort.
El Paso phase components were discovered
in all environmental subzones of the two basins,
but the village sites clustered significantly on
and below the alluvial fans, or talus slopes, at the
foothills of the mountains and also near playas,
notably Lake Lucero in the Tularosa Basin. These
locational trends were pioneered in the Dona
Ana phase, and they are thought to have involved
exploitation of sheet wash and arroyo-channeled
runoff from summer downpours as water resources
for cultivation. This locational pattern also shows a
correlation between the locations of El Paso phase
villages and the superior water-retaining Mimbres
series soils (Kosse 1977). Limited activity and
resource procurement sites are distributed widely

throughout the basins and mountain foothills.
These sites very likely formed out of a logistical strategy of collecting plant foods, fibers, and
medicinal plants such as mesquite, chenopods,
amaranths, sotol, lechuguilla, and yucca. They
then would have been returned to the villages for
processing and consumption (Whalen 1977:141).
The intensity of site settlement research in the
basins is not matched in the upland segment of this
basin and range region. The natural area survey of
Betancourt and Ralph (1981) in the Hueco Mountains fortunately took place a few miles eastward
of the Sabina Mountain Number Two site and its
off-site survey zones. Although nearby in terms
of linear distance, the survey in the remote and
rugged mountain zone engaged a completely different set of methodological challenges than those
encountered in the low and gently sloping basins.
The mountain survey as a result was a targeted
reconnaissance survey that largely covered the
wide canyon floors and canyon flanks. Despite this
topographic emphasis, however, approximately 15
percent of the surveyed area lay on the mountain
flanks and saddle ridges between peaks. A total of
41 sites were recorded, inclusive of Historic sites
(Betancourt and Ralph 1981:94). The prehistoric
sites covered a temporal range from the Archaic
through the El Paso phase. Three El Paso phase
sites were found, one of which was a multi-component site, possibly a small village (Betancourt and
Ralph 1981:96-99 and Figure 5). These findings
are sufficient to cast some doubt on a picture of
Jornada Mogollon, and in particular El Paso phase,
settlement as centered on villages centrally located
on basin flanks and near major playas, with limited
activity and procurement camps on dry basin bottoms and in mountain slopes and canyons.
Dockall (1999) summarized the various settlement models of the Hueco Bolson in an attempt to

clarify modern understanding of Jornada Mogollon
settlement and identify problem areas for further
research. Whalen (1977, 1981, 1994) presented
the dominant formulation, stemming from research in the Hueco Bolson. His model centers on
land-use strategies and the shifting availability of
subsistence resources through the year. From early
Pithouse (Mesilla) times, Hueco Bolson human
groups practiced residential mobility throughout
the area, locating their sites where and when water
and ripening foodstuffs became available. They
built pithouses and other shelters in their camps
when needed. This pattern in its essence was a continuation of successful and long-standing Archaic
economic strategies. The pattern changed with the
Pithouse to Pueblo transition, and it is observable
in locational shifts of larger villages from the low
basin floors to the basin flanks and mountain foothills, zones more favorable for cultivation. Limited
activity sites remained numerous on the basin
floors, reflecting continued collecting of foodstuffs
there on a logistical rather than on a foraging basis.
Increasing population and a heightened reliance
on agriculture motivated the Pithouse to Pueblo
transition.
Hard’s (1983) model offers conceptual contrasts with Whalen’s. Early Pithouse mobility
was a response to differences in water availability
in the winter and summer. Summer camps and
hamlets dotted the basin bottoms where seasonal
water ponded in playas and arroyos. Winter camps
were on the basin flanks. Hard (1983) also posited
a shift from a circulating pattern of sites, moving
when needed in the Early Pithouse period to a
radiating settlement pattern in the Late Pithouse
period. A radiating pattern is one where residential
sites are occupied longer in time, and residents
conduct activities in smaller special task sites radiating outward from the main base camp. Mauldin

have fluctuated as a product of
paleoclimatic change, and (2) the

relevant aspects of the cultural
and environmental context. Regarding the first point, the Hueco
Bolson has suffered a dearth of
direct paleoclimatic studies employing proxy data categories
with which to reconstruct past
climates, but wider regional and
areal studies show that the desert
Southwest from about A.D. 1200
to 1400 was a drier time than
today, with slightly wetter conditions around A.D. 1450 (Bryson
and Baerreis 1968; Gunn 1987;

in excavating Pueblo architecture. The rooms
were Room 2 (Brook 1980:26-27) and Room 3
(Brook 1980:28-29). The investigators observed
and recorded additional fragmentary architectural
remains and constructed features in the numerous surface collection units at the site. The rooms
and features were described on field excavation
forms and then also photographed (Figure 6). The
site’s features lay in a highly eroded and displaced
condition, and observations were necessarily of a
summary nature. Locational references reported
here are to the site-wide 1 m grid system emplaced
before the start of the field school and oriented to
magnetic north.
Room 2
The room was originally very shallow, such
that some excavators stated that it had not been
backfilled in the 1964-1967 excavations, but left
open to erode further and collect windblown deposits. This situation was offered in excavation
notes to explain the lack of any prepared floor when

the room was cleared. Other excavators reported
removing backfill; therefore, the room deposit
situation remains uncertain. The room’s general
location was given as 120N 27E. Room 2 was
off-square in plan (Brook 1980:26-27), forming a

slight trapezoid. Its dimensions and area are given
in Table 2.
The material of the walls was not described, but
puddled adobe or adobe blocks are ubiquitous on the
site. It is probable that field note takers assumed that
this material was used, as wall materials were never
described in any excavation notes. Photographs
show adobe to be the common building material.
The walls lacked any features such as niches for
storage or seating of roofing elements. A hearth or
firing area was identified along the center of the
south wall; this find was made within a few hours of
the end of the field school. Understandably, efforts
focused on clearing the feature, but a description of
the hearth/firing area and its composition is lacking,
and it was not drawn on the room plan. Its location
along the center of the south wall is in common
with the hearth in Room 3 and with other regional
Puebloan dwellings (Brook 1980:27).

Room 3 was located at the 135N 27E grid
point, and the structure retained much of its backfill. Excavators uncovered the wall lines readily
but failed to describe them. Puddled adobe and
limestone blocks are the presumed building materials, based on their presence elsewhere on the site.
The room was described in plan (see Figure 5) as a
rough square when cleared to the floor level (Table
3). Packed earth formed the floor. Floor intrusions
such as post holes, pot holes, and the hearth were
clearly observable within it.

A hard-packed section of dirt floor abutted to a
definite wall line was identified in surface collection square 110N 48E (Figure 7). The hard-packed
earth covered approximately one-quarter of the east
side of the square and was not found in any adjacent square. The wall line extended south to north
through the square and also through 111N 48E,
where a large chert flake lay embedded on the floor
side of the wall (east). An adobe chunk 25 cm long
by 20 cm wide was found melded with the floor
near its juncture with the wall in 110N 48E. It is
likely that the adobe chunk was wall material that
fell from the wall, probably post-abandonment, and
became incorporated into the floor. A floor surface
in non-contiguous square 112N 49E extended to an
east-west wall line. That floor surface also had a 20

The TAS excavators found a hearth near the
doorway midway along the south wall. The fire pit
measured 24 cm in diameter and sank to a depth of
8 cm. Presumably, packed earth or puddled adobe
formed the feature. The excavators’ field excavation
record plan showed two doorways
in the room, one each in the north
and south walls. The doorways sit
slightly west of the center point of
their respective walls, but they are
offset with respect to each other.
The south doorway was hard to
discern in the wall, but this effort
was aided by the presence of a
low step northward into the room.
The north wall doorway also had
a northward step, out of Room 3
or into a former contiguous room
north of Room 3.
A series of post holes along
the west side of the room may
have been part of an internal construction such as a jacal screen
or turkey pen (Brook [1980:42]
reported more than 300 pieces
of eggshell from the excavated
extramural pit feature. These may
have been from turkey eggs).
Two small post holes between
the hearth and the south doorway
may indicate supports for a windscreen. The four larger post holes
formed an approximate square in
the middle of the room, indicating they are the remains of the
roof supports, perhaps implying
a roof pattern of primary beams
laid perpendicularly and parallel
to the wall lines.

cm adobe chunk worked into it. The floor surface in
111N 49E was heavily disrupted by tire tracks, but
it clearly revealed three post holes, two of which
had overlapping outlines. These room features,
in four contiguous grid squares, are sufficiently
coherent to define a shallow, disturbed room.
Floor fragment
One fragment of an ancient floor surface was
unearthed in 112N 91E (see Figure 5). The floor
fragment consisted of an irregular strip of compacted earth arcing from the southeast grid corner and
east wall into the north wall. The floor fragment
lacked sufficient associated constructed features to
confirm its existence as the interior floor of a room.
Thus, interpretation of the floor fragment widens
to include possible functions as an outdoor plaza
area or an activity area under a roofed patio.
Wall fragment
One portion of a wall was cleared in the southwest corner of grid square 93N 49E (see Figure 5).
The direction and extent of the adobe wall cannot
be determined because of a large tire track that
obscured it and much of the rest of the square.
The wall section was found about 10 cm bs. Any
interpretation of the wall section would be highly
speculative.
Adobe Lumps and Post Hole
Grid square 111N 40E (see Figure 5) had irregular masses of adobe throughout the square and a 10
cm diameter post hole in the northwest quarter. The
adobe mass best defined was approximately 20 cm
in diameter. As the square lacked any defined floor
surface, these materials may have fallen outside a
nearby room after abandonment. The post hole may
indicate an extramural construction.
Adobe Cluster
Squares 110N 35E and 111N 36E (see Figure
5) yielded five scattered oblong adobe chunks
about 10 cm bs. They lacked other associated features. The single fully outlined chunk measured
50 cm long by 20 cm wide. They appear to be the
common wall-building material of the site, but
more detailed interpretations are not possible with
the limited available information.

Hearths/burned Areas
Two hearths or burned areas were found in the
on-site sampling work. They may have functioned
as hearths, but they lacked any formal construction (rock linings, pits) usually associated with
hearths. The term burned areas is more descriptive; the term hearths is more interpretive: both are
justified and used interchangeably. The first burned
area was identified by irregular stained patches
ranging from light to dark gray in color in parts
of four grid squares: 106N 44E, 106N 45E, 107N
44E, and 107N 45E (see Figure 5). The longest
dimension of the three largest patches was about
40 cm. A roughly circular burned area was 13 cm
in diameter. Associated features such as floors were
lacking in the four squares.
The second burned area was uncovered in
111N 36E (see Figure 5), and consisted of two
discontinuous dark, rounded stains in the western
half of the square. A 12 cm diameter ashy area
near the northernmost of the two stains contained
a large chunk of wood charcoal. An adobe chunk
was found in the southeast corner of the square. It
measured 15 cm long by 10 cm wide. The stains
and adobe chunk lay about 8 cm bs. The lack of
other constructed features and materials suggests
a simple extramural hearth.
Pottery Concentration
A concentration of pottery sherds reported as
being from a single vessel was found in the northeast corner of square 111N 30E (see Figure 5).
The portion in the square measured 25 cm2, but it
extended into unexcavated squares. Examination
of the ceramics, however, showed the pottery concentration to be comprised of 21 small sherds of El
Paso Brown, two sherds of El Paso Red-on-Brown,
one sherd of an unknown polished plain ware, and
70 small fragments too small to attribute to a type
or ware. The elevation below the ground surface
was not reported.

SPATIAL RELATIONSHIPS
The field school on-site survey resulted in
a large volume of records and collected cultural
remains. The artifact collections came from corridor sections, surface collection units, excavation
squares, and the clearance of the two architectural

68

Texas Archeological Society

rooms excavated previously by Brook (1980). The
large volume of finds, varying collection unit sizes
and shapes, and non-uniform collection techniques
render infeasible a computer surface density map,
the near-classical surface analysis technique of
1970s archeology. This is not to say that valid artifact and feature patterns are not observable with
the information obtained from the surface and nearsurface collections. The most general observation
that can be made is that extramural features and
architectural fragments cluster in the northern half of
the site, among the known room blocks (see Figure
5). Furthermore, within this area, the preponderance
of artifact and residue clusters and architectural fragments lie in a broad band between room blocks A
and B. This zone of concentration sweeps diagonally
with reference to the site-wide grid and describes the
heart of the site’s cultural and behavioral activities.
Detailed discussions are given below, following a
methodological note justifying the combined use of
surface and subsurface data.
The findings and much of the critical data
gained from the remote sensing exercises conducted by Philip Bandy are not reported here, nor have
they been recovered in the records. It is unfortunate
that the potential of these pioneering efforts may
well be lost.
A Note on the Ground Surface and
Comparability of Artifact Patterns
A basic division of the work on the Sabina
Mountain Number Two site was that between surface and subsurface efforts. Finds deriving from this
dichotomous approach were bagged and catalogued
in observance of this distinction. It is implicit in
this work and at excavation sites everywhere that
objects and patterns in the separate realms of surface
and subsurface contexts have differing comparability, or are at odds in their implications for spatial
analysis and past cultural occupation of the site.
At most sites, especially those deeply stratified and
with multiple components, this is indeed the case
and analytic caution must be observed. However,
the environment, history, and especially the ground
surface of the Sabina Mountain Number Two site
altogether blur this otherwise sharp distinction. Both
classes of artifacts and features may be compared
with equal precision in their application to studying
the past life history of the site.
Two physical facts about the Sabina Mountain
Number Two site environment may be used to

construct an argument that surface and subsurface
classes of items compare with each other and can be
compared equally to in situ architecture and cultural
features. The first fact is that the cultural levels of
the site have always been shallow, some perhaps
surface-exposed since they were formed. The vertical distance between surface and subsurface artifacts
has never been great, perhaps no more than 30 cm.
It is therefore of dubious validity to claim that subsurface artifact patterns in context have any more
accuracy in informing about surface architecture
than surface artifact patterns in context.
Secondly, the ground surface here is a spatially
shifting reality. Field notes and forms commonly
reported the dominant soil formation process as
wind deflation, falsely implying a vector. It was
also commonly observed that the Hueco Bolson is
a dune-forming environment. Dune formation processes move masses of wind-responsive, or aeolian,
particles (fine sand-sized and smaller) downwind.
When a dune forms over any given point, the ground
surface elevates to the maximum height of the dune.
Within and below the dune deposits, larger, nonwind-responsive particles move vertically and horizontally significant distances by means of bioturbation. Creosotebush roots, burrowing invertebrates,
reptiles, rodents, and perhaps some burrowing birds
move larger particles in all directions. As the dune
continues downwind, larger particles descend to a
common level, that being the new ground surface
behind the dune. Aeolian transport proceeds until
the surface stabilizes, composed of larger particles.
Therefore, the ground surface in a dune-forming
environment may be thought of by the concept of
oscillation or cyclation rather than a vector.
More significantly for artifact patterning at the
Sabina Mountain Number Two site, the forces of
dune formation and transit play equally on surface
and subsurface artifact patterns, subjecting them
to disruption, burial, and re-exposure repeatedly,
thus giving them equivalent degrees of integrity. In
consequence, the integrity of the artifact patterns
can be assessed by the same evaluative criteria,
whether they came from surface or subsurface
proveniences. The patterns can then be applied
in concert to site spatial pattern identification and
interpretation.
An examination of the sketch plans of the
surface collected units (exclusive of 1 x 1 m
square units) provides an illustration of the surface composition of the site and its wide variation.
The units varied in dimensions from 2 x 2 m to

Robinson—The 1977 Investigations of the Sabina Mountain Number Two Site 69
2 x 5 m in size. Typically, surface collectors drew
in on sketch plans the areas covered by dunes, deflated surface (usually denoted as hardpan), dense
vegetation, tire tracks or roads/trails, or they left
the surface undescribed. Table 4 tallies the units by
the dominant surface types sketched on the plans.
As the plans are indeed sketches, the area of surface types are estimated, not calculated. The first
surface type is the dominant surface of the unit,
followed in descending order of area estimate by
the other types.
The table shows clearly that the concept of the
surface is one of great variability at the site. It also
supports the contention that spatial analysis of the
Sabina Mountain Number Two site using surface
data should look for the broadest possible patterns
in order to draw valid conclusions about the spatial
patterning of artifacts and features.
Burned Rock Distribution Analysis
Burned rock, almost all of it limestone, was
widespread in surface and subsurface contexts at the
site. It was found distributed in scatters and forming
hearth features, and it was the most common class
of collected material in the long transects through
the site. Because of this common occurrence, burned
rock has the capacity to delineate the broad spatial
patterns alluded to above. The material itself has
little to offer for insights, and so burned rock is analyzed here for its distributional information rather
than in the artifact analysis section.
The rock originated in the mountains that
flank the Hueco Bolson. It moved by erosion into
the basin where it became locally available to the
aboriginal occupants. The gathered resource was
marked by fire burning in various hearths of the
villagers over time. The burned limestone is therefore waste material from the ancient fires. The
material ranges from sub-rounded to sub-angular
in outline and from large pebble to small boulder
in size classification. Colors run monotonously to
gray and grayish-brown tones. The general sameness of the rock led some to question the faithful
recognition of the difference between burned
rock and merely sun-exposed rock. Presumably,
the field school staff taught observational keys
to identify the burned rock (fire-crazing, minute
fracturing, generally higher angularity, etc.). As
a practical matter, it is assumed that a very small
proportion of unburned rock entered the burned
rock analysis.

Burned rock was recorded by number of items
in the artifact catalog. Number is the trait used in
this analysis, and serves as an indirect, or proxy,
measure of the density of burned rock in the site
contexts. The analysis consisted of the counting
and charting of the numbers of burned rock pieces
recovered from the surfaces of transects B and C.
These transects are two of the five long corridors
through the site within which mapping and surface
collecting were conducted (see Figure 5). Transect
B was an east-west mapped corridor along the
110N line from 10E to 102E. It extended through
the densest architectural precincts of the village.
Transect C was a north-south mapped corridor
along the 25E grid line from the 25N grid point to
the 150N grid point. This transect extended from
well south of the architectural remains of the village, through them, to just north of the identified
structures. The transects were counted by the common surface unit, which was 2 m wide (the transect
width) by 5 m long. In some portions of Transect
C, some sections were divided by 1 m grids, due to
the need for a more fine-grained examination of the
surface (needs having to do with other than burned
rock). In those areas, the burned rock counts were
grouped into 10 m2 units to gain consistency with
the more common unit area. It was further discovered during the analysis that not all units were
reported to the final inventory of the site’s artifacts.
The gaps left for any reason are reported; the loss
of data is regretted.

The burned rock distribution charts offer broad

features, with an abrupt fall-off of burned rock
numbers between rooms and features. These patterns have persisted through the active surface
and subsurface processes at work on the site and
the forces of modern relic hunting and vehicle
disturbance. The burned rock distribution analysis
also validates some of the surface sampling strategies applied to the site during the field school site
survey, specifically the surface collection of long
transect corridors.

ARTIFACT ANALYSIS
Sabina Mountain Number Two
Lithic Assemblage
by John E. Dockall
This lithic analysis is designed only to provide
a brief discussion of raw material variability, tool
typology, and possible patterns of raw material
use as reflected in tool types from the Sabina
Mountain Number Two site. Due to questions
regarding the provenience of these artifacts, no
attempt was made to examine potential contextual
relationships.
Artifact Classification
The methods of artifact classification follow
those employed by Dockall (1991) and Dockall
et al. (1997) associated with the analysis of lithic
assemblages from Mimbres-Mogollon and Jornada
Mogollon sites. The manufacture of stone tools is
conceived as a series of ordered stages that can
be recognized in the archeological record on the
basis of diagnostic attributes. These attributes are
morphological and reveal information relevant to
the manufacture and use of stone tools.
The artifact typology generally departs from
the traditional methodology of applying functional
names to artifacts. Typological names are descriptive in most cases and based more on the morphology, technology, and type of modification than on
inferred function.
Raw Material
Raw material is a pertinent variable to all
levels of lithic analysis including debitage, technology, raw material procurement, and function.
The raw material of all flaked and ground stone
tools and cores was determined by macroscopically observed properties and, where possible, an
assessment was made as to the geological formation of origin of the materials.
Cortex Type
Cortex is the outer covering or rind on
lithic material that forms through such agents as
streams, weathering, or a combination of other
chemical and mechanical processes. The presence

and amount of cortex were recorded for each tool.
Previous studies (Dockall et al. 1997) have noted
three main classes of cortex: stream-worn, patinated, and weathered. The type of cortex would
allow for some indication of where certain raw
materials were procured: such as natural outcrops,
stream gravels, or alluvial fan deposits or talus
slopes. The amount of cortex on an implement also
gives some indication of the process of selection
of appropriate tool blanks and at what stage of the
reduction/manufacture process these blanks were
selected.
Geological Description
of the Hueco Bolson
Hill (1900) and Knowles and Kennedy (1958)
have described the Hueco Bolson as an intermontane basin. The Franklin-Organ-San Andres
and Quitman-Malone-Finlay-Hueco-Sacramento
Mountain chains bound the basin. The bolson itself is actually part of a larger intermountain basin
separated by a low east-west divide north of the
Texas-New Mexico border. The northern portion
is known as the Tularosa Basin, which has no external drainage and has abundant dunes of white
gypsum sand and salt marshes. The southern part
of this intermountain basin is the Hueco Bolson,
which is drained by the Rio Grande. External
drainage of the Hueco Bolson means that there
are no surface deposits of salt or gypsum. The
southern portion of the Hueco Bolson is in Mexico
where the Sierra Madre Oriental forms a partial
boundary.
The location of the Sabina Mountain Number
Two site is 8.3 km to the southwest of the Hueco
Mountains and 3.3 km east of Sabina Mountain.
The region between the Franklin Mountains to
the west of the Hueco Mountains to the east is
known as the Hueco Bolson or Hueco Basin. Sabina Mountain is best described as a north-south
trending limestone ridge and rises 198 m above
the surrounding terrain (Brook 1980:17). The Rio
Grande is about 33 km to the southwest. Gravels of
the Rio Grande are composed of limestone, basalt,
granite, quartzite, and cryptocrystalline silicates
such as chert, agate, and obsidian.
Nelson and Haigh (1958) and Sayre and
Livingstone (1945) have provided a detailed
discussion of Hueco Bolson geology. The rocks
of the region can be subdivided into two basic
groups: (1) the igneous and sedimentary rocks of

72

Texas Archeological Society

the upland areas and mountains; (2) the bolson
deposits (Knowles and Kennedy 1958:58). The
bolson deposits are characterized by very thick
deposits of sands and gravels and were derived
from hard rocks of the Hueco Mountains and
upland areas. Igneous and sedimentary rocks are
present in both the Franklin and Hueco Mountains,
and both must be considered as possible sources for
lithic material present in the bolson deposits.
Igneous Rocks
There are two major types of igneous rocks by
texture: granitic and porphyritic. Abundant exposures of granitic rocks are visible in the Franklin
and Organ mountains and isolated exposures in the
southern part of the Hueco Mountains. The central
portion of the Organ Mountains is dominated by
quartz monzonite. The majority of these granitic
rocks are pre-Cambrian in age.
According to Knowles and Kennedy
(1958:590), rhyolite and syenite porphyry are
abundant source materials for bolson deposits.
Rhyolites and rhyolite porphyry underlie a large
part of the central Franklin Mountains. Also, a
quartzite-rhyolite pebble conglomerate is present
at the base of this porphyry which outcrops in the
southern Franklin Mountains along the east flank.
Most of the rhyolite porphyry is pre-Cambrian
in age and weathers into pebbles and boulders
and is a chief source of bolson gravels. Syenite
porphyry at the base of the Hueco Mountains is of
Cretaceous age and easily weathers and degrades
into clay.

in the southern Hueco Mountains.
In addition to quartzite and sandstone, there
is an abundant sequence of limestone. The limestones range in age from Ordovician to Cretaceous
and overlie the Bliss sandstones; they are described in greater detail in Sayre and Livingstone
(1945:25-27). These limestones vary from light to
dark in color and are, in general, dense, hard, and
massive (Nelson and Haigh 1958:59). In some localities, the limestones are interbedded with shale,
sandstone, and chert. Limestone pebbles are occasionally found as clasts of the bolson deposits.
Unconsolidated Bolson Deposits
Deposits within the Hueco Bolson usually
consist of clay, sand, and gravel layers of Tertiary
age with the thickness of beds widely variable.
Caliche is a very widespread constituent of the
bolson deposits and acts as a barrier to the subsurface percolation of water. Clays within the bolson
vary from reddish-brown to brown or are lighter
colors of buff to gray. Clay beds range from pure
clay to clay mixed with sand, pebbles, and boulders. There is a west to east gradation in clast size
of gravels within the deposits of the Hueco Bolson
such that deposits closer to the Hueco Mountains
are finer grained and thinner than those closer to
the Franklin and Organ Mountains. This indicates
that the igneous rocks of the Franklin and Organ
Mountains were the major sources of bolson deposits (Nelson and Haigh 1958:60).
Specific Rock Types

Sedimentary Rocks

Limestone/Dolomite

Quartzite, sandstone, and limestone represent
the most significant lithic types contributing to the
Hueco Bolson (Knowles and Kennedy 1958). The
pre-Cambrian Llanoria quartzite outcrops along
the eastern flank of the Franklin Mountains in the
central portion of the range. This quartzite is very
dense and fine-grained, occurring in alternate thick
and thin beds. The material weathers into boulders
and pebbles, providing material for gravel and sand
deposits of the Hueco Bolson.
A major sandstone is the Bliss formation of
Cambrian or Ordovician age. The Bliss sandstone
is present on the eastern flanks of the Franklin and
Organ Mountains and is present in minor outcrops

This rock type typically occurs in a dark gray
to black color range and is very fine-grained. It
also has fair to good conchoidal fracture properties
for manufacturing flaked stone tools and weathers
to a light blue-gray with a chalky surface. A fairly
thick series of Ordovician to Cretaceous limestones overlies the Bliss sandstone (Nelson and
Haigh 1958:59). Another source of limestone and
dolomite could include the pre-Cambrian Caster
Marble exposure in Fusselman Canyon (Hoffer
1976). The most likely primary geological source
for dense black limestones is the Las Cruces limestone in the Las Cruces formation of Mississippian
age (Laudon and Bowsher 1949:17).

Robinson—The 1977 Investigations of the Sabina Mountain Number Two Site 73
Quartzite
Quartzite occurs in varieties of light brown or
gray and light green. Carmichael (1986:166) noted
that both types were quite common on the eastern
slopes of the Franklin Mountains. Some quartzites
are also present in the Fillmore Pass area. The Llanoria quartzite occurs in the center of the Franklin
Mountains on the eastern flanks. It is described
as a dense, tough, fine-grained gray quartzite that
weathers into both pebbles and cobbles (Nelson
and Haigh 1958:59).
Rancheria Chert
The Rancheria chert occurs in the Mississippian
Rancheria formation. Laudon and Bowsher
(1949:17) describe the formation as a “sequence of
cherty, black, bituminous, argillaceous limestone
beds” with an unconformable contact with the
lower Las Cruces formation. Rancheria chert is a
distinctive black porous chert that weathers into a
light-medium brown and occurs in both nodular and
thin-bedded forms (Laudon and Bowsher 1949:19).
Carmichael (1986:167) identified several varieties
of Rancheria chert. This material is also quite
common in the Franklin and Hueco mountains.
Other Cherts
There are a number of other cherts that differed in both color and quality in the Sabina
Mountain Number Two assemblage. No attempt
was made to distinguish types on the basis of
physical properties. Carmichael (1986:167-168)
did identify a variety of cherts for the southern
Tularosa Basin and for Keystone sites 36 and
37 (Carmichael 1985:466-473) based on color,
grain, inclusions, and fracture quality. The geological sources for these cherts are the various
limestone formations along the eastern slopes of
the Franklin Mountains and the western slopes of
the Hueco Mountains.
Jasper and Chalcedony
Jasper is variable in color and has been noted
in shades of yellow, brown, and various reds. Chalcedony occurs primarily in translucent to milky
white varieties with a very rough exterior cortex.
Carmichael (1985, 1986) identified a wide variety
of types in the Franklin Mountains and southern

Tularosa Basin. Both jasper and chalcedony occur
as small nodules or pebbles in alluvial fan, arroyo,
and bolson deposits.
Obsidian
This raw material has been commonly identified in Formative period sites in the Hueco Bolson/
Franklin Mountains region. Its presence as pebbles
in alluvial deposits and arroyo deposits in the southern Tularosa Basin and Franklin Mountains is, however, quite rare (Carmichael 1985:204, 1986:167).
Carmichael (1986:167) noted that gravel deposits of
the ancestral Rio Grande are the most likely secondary sources. An XRF analysis of obsidian from the
Gobernadora and Ojasen sites (Dockall et al. 1997)
indicated that the primary geological source was the
Valles Caldera Composition Group in New Mexico,
found west of Santa Fe.
Basalt
The basalts from the Sabina Mountain Number
Two site varied from fine-grained to vesicular and
were dark gray to black in color. The principal geological source for basalts is probably the Munday
Breccia. This is a brecciated basalt flow that occurs
within the pre-Cambrian sequence of Fusselman
Canyon and elsewhere in the eastern Franklin
Mountains. It overlies the Caster Marble and is in
turn overlain by the Llanoria quartzite.
Diabase
The pre-Cambrian stratigraphic units of the
Fusselman Canyon area and elsewhere have been
intruded by a number of diabase dikes and sills
(Hoffer 1976:5). In the same region, the Caster
Marble has several diabase intrusions that were
responsible for the metamorphism of the Caster
Marble (Hoffer 1976:7). Diabase was occasionally
used as a source for various types of ground stone
implements such as manos and grinding slabs.
Sandstones
There are numerous possible geological
sources that could have contributed sandstone to
the alluvial fan, arroyo, and bolson deposits. The
most likely sources are the Ordovician deposits of
the Bliss sandstone. The Bliss sandstone outcrops

along the eastern side of the Organ and Franklin
mountains (Nelson and Haigh 1958:59). Sandstone
was frequently employed as lithic material for
manos, metates, and other grinding implements in
Jornada Mogollon sites.
Granites and Granite Pegmatite
Granitic strata outcrop in fairly large areas of
the Franklin and Organ mountains and lesser areas
of the southern Hueco Mountains. All exposures
are pre-Cambrian in age. The most extensive exposures occur in the central portion of the Franklins.
Extensive exposures provide a good source material for the bolson deposits but the granite weathers
fairly quickly (Nelson and Haigh 1958:59). In fact,
granite metates and ground stone fragments from
the Gobernadora and Ojasen sites have begun to
exhibit signs of degradation showing weakness and
crumbling along the edges. Similar weathering was
observed on granite artifacts from Sabina Mountain Number Two. The rapidity of weathering may
indicate that material for metates and other ground
stone implements had to be procured closer to the
primary source to find large enough pieces that had
not been degraded.
Studies of Jornada Mogollon
Raw Material Procurement
The interpretations of raw material procurement practices among Jornada Mogollon
inhabitants of the basins of western Texas and
south-central New Mexico have typically been
phrased in terms of varying proportions of raw
materials through time (Camilli 1988:148; Carmichael 1986:161-189). Associated with a temporal approach to raw material procurement and
variability is the assumption that raw material
variability decreased as Archaic hunter-gatherer
groups made the transition to relatively sedentary
Formative part-time agriculturalists (Mesilla to El
Paso phases). A similar set of assumptions has also
been applied to studies of raw material variability
in the Mimbres Mogollon region of southwestern
New Mexico (Nelson 1981). A corollary to these
interpretations is that sedentary groups will tend
to utilize lithic raw materials that occur within the
immediate vicinity of the habitation site to a greater
extent than less sedentary groups (Dockall 1991;
Dockall et al. 1997; Foster 1993:21; Miller and
Carmichael 1985) largely as a response to procure-

ment practices and the scheduling of procurement
within other activities (Binford 1979). The concept
of scavenging raw material from earlier occupations has also been considered for the Jornada and
Mimbres regions (Dockall 1991).
Camilli (1988) examined the temporal variability
of raw material types among lithic assemblages from
sites on West Mesa bolson. A significant portion of
these raw materials represent materials that were
procured from elsewhere because suitable local
materials are represented by obsidian and chert that
occur in typically small size. Material in the region
bordering West Mesa occurs in the Rio Grande gravels and Franklin Mountains alluvial fans and includes
limestone, chert, sandstone, rhyolite, and quartzite
(Camilli 1988:150-151). She noted that crystalline
volcanics are quite abundant in Paleoindian and
Archaic assemblages. Initially, these data suggested
that the degree of sedentism may be related to raw
material selection; however, when raw material types
were grouped according to the presence of ceramic
and projectile point styles, other patterns emerged.
Camilli found greater similarities among all sites
regarding raw material and technological attributes,
which strongly suggested a significant degree of scavenging and recycling of raw material from earlier sites
by later inhabitants. The most significant implication
of her research indicates that the proportion of various
raw material types may not be a good indicator of the
temporal affiliation of a site.
The proportion of coarse and fine-grained
lithic material has typically been applied in the
Jornada region to infer major raw material procurement differences through time. Carmichael (1983,
1986) noted a temporal trend toward increasing
use of coarse-grained raw materials for sites in
the southern Tularosa Basin of New Mexico by
employing a lithic diversity index for measuring the variability among lithic assemblages. A
survey of the McGregor Guided Missile Range,
Otero County, New Mexico (Piggot and Dulaney
1977:83-94), demonstrated that raw materials were
locally available for sites where chipped artifacts
were recovered. A greater degree of mobility or
regional trade for raw materials was suggested for
the Paleoindian period on the basis of greater raw
material variability.
For the Turquoise Ridge site, situated on
the eastern edge of the Hueco Bolson, Whalen
(1994:95-98) noted no significant difference
among raw materials associated with early and late
phases of occupation. There were no appreciable

Robinson—The 1977 Investigations of the Sabina Mountain Number Two Site 75
differences among raw material procurement
patterns throughout the occupation of Turquoise
Ridge, although there was an increased selection
for more coarse-grained raw materials.
Previous Studies of Sabina Mountain
Lithic Assemblages
The only known analysis of the lithic assemblages from the Sabina Mountain Number Two site
was conducted by Brook (1980) as part of a comprehensive report on excavations conducted at Sabina
Mountain Number One and Sabina Mountain Number Two by the EPAS intermittently between 1964
and 1967. Brook’s discussion of the lithic material
from Sabina Mountain Number Two is summarized
here because there are several distinctive differences
that emerge when compared to the material recovered by the TAS Field School in 1977.
Brook (1980:21) noted the presence of metate
and mano fragments, palettes and fragments, cores,
flakes, hammerstones, bifacial knives, and a number
of broken and complete projectile points. One of the
more interesting aspects of the lithic assemblage
recovered during EPAS excavations is the general
absence of lithic debitage. Among other debris and

artifacts only nine unmodified flakes were recovered
from a trash pit to the southeast of Room 3. Only
33 flakes were recovered from all other areas of
excavation (Brook 1980:54). This is significantly
different from the abundance of debitage recovered
during TAS excavations and probably reflects differences in recovery techniques. The recovered lithic
assemblage from EPAS excavations is recreated (in
brief) in Table 5 and only provides total numbers
and percentages of artifacts per category.
Raw Material at Sabina Mountain
Number Two
Twenty-three kinds of stone raw material were
identified during the artifact analysis of Sabina
Mountain Number Two material (Table 6). The
majority of these raw materials were exploited
from locally occurring sources. The major source
of these materials was probably the local gravel
deposits. The distance of Sabina Mountain Number
Two from the Rio Grande (33 km), and its location
at the end of a playa, was probably a significant
factor in raw material procurement and selection.
Distance to suitable materials such as obsidian may
have prohibited the scheduling of procurement of

these sources within other activities. Camilli (1988)
and Mauldin (1993) have noted the importance of
scavenging of earlier sites on the Hueco Bolson by
later inhabitants, especially of various cherts.
Although the debitage from Sabina Mountain
Number Two was not subjected to analysis it
was examined to identify any tools missed in the
initial sorting. During this exercise, I noted an
abundance (>50 %) of cherts in the assemblage
and abundant evidence of early stage reduction.
An examination of non-debitage chunks and angular debris demonstrated that there was abundant
chert in the immediate area of the site because
much of the debris was in medium to large pebble
size. This strongly suggests the presence of a chert
source or sources in the immediate vicinity of the
site (<3-5 km). A more detailed analysis of the
debitage would confirm or deny these impressions. Core analysis, however, also suggests the
presence of a local chert source.
The greater abundance of obsidian in the
assemblage is artificially inflated due to the
inclusion of all obsidian debitage and tools in the
artifact analysis. The actual abundance of obsidian

in Jornada Mogollon Formative period sites is
typically less than cherts, reflecting the lesser
abundance of obsidian in gravel deposits.
Raw materials such as sandstone and limestone
were manufactured into heavy-duty chipped and
ground stone implements but do not contribute
significantly to the chipped category of the lithic
assemblage. Quartzite also was not typically selected (or available) for flaked stone tools.
Materials that could be identified to a specific
source include Rancheria chert (only 4.3 percent
of all analyzed artifacts). The majority of this
material was classified as cores. Other artifacts of
Rancheria chert included a core tool, two modified flakes, one Fresno arrow point, and a single
utilized flake.
The most abundant cryptocrystalline material
for flaked stone tools includes the various cherts,
which are highly variable in quality and color. Other minor raw materials included chalcedony, jasper,
basalt, quartz, and rhyolite/rhyolite porphyry. Each
of these materials comprised less than 1.0 percent
of the total analyzed sample of flaked and ground
stone tools.

Robinson—The 1977 Investigations of the Sabina Mountain Number Two Site 77
Assemblage Composition
and Interpretations
The analyzed assemblage from Sabina
Mountain Number Two consisted of 196 chipped
and ground stone cores, tools, and tool fragments.
An additional collection of thirteen bipolar flakes
and 50 pieces of shatter was also analyzed for
comparison to the bipolar cores. The chipped stone
tool component comprised 76.5 percent and the
ground stone 23.5 percent of the sample. Table 7
provides totals and percents of all major lithic
artifact classes identified during the analysis.
Cores, core fragments, and miscellaneous
ground stone fragments dominate the assemblage
(Figure 10). The core reduction technology represents a generalized strategy of flake production
where flakes are used as tools with little or no modification. The cores range from almost exhausted
(no longer efficient for flake production) to only
minimally reduced. The selection of a generalized
core technology and a predominance of unmodified
and minimally modified flake tools has been attributed to an increase in sedentism during the Formative period of the Southwest (Parry and Kelly 1987)

and a decline in the importance of formal tools and
methods of reduction (bifaces and blade cores).
Recent studies of generalized core strategies have
demonstrated that they are a logical choice when
there is a sufficient supply of raw material available
and that there is an inherent flexibility to produce a
variety of different flake morphologies for various
needs (Johnson 1986; Teltser 1991). Generalized
core technologies are also logical choices in light
of specific mobility patterns, distance to raw material, and the nature of that raw material (Cobb and
Webb 1994:212). Formal stone technologies are
frequently associated with increased risk factors
(i.e., hunter-gatherer subsistence patterns), whereas
generalized technologies are often related to an
increased dependence on cultigens and the mitigation of the temporary risks of part-time hunting and
gathering (Cobb and Webb 1994:212).
There were two techniques of generalized core
reduction employed at Sabina Mountain Number
Two: hard hammer percussion and bipolar percussion. The particular method employed was largely
attributed to the type and nature of the raw material. Hard hammer percussion cores were almost
exclusively of chert, with the exception of three of

sandstone. The predominance of chert cores correlates well with the predominance of chert over other
materials among all chipped stone tools. All bipolar
cores represent reduced obsidian pebbles. Bipolar
reduction is typically associated with an abundance
of shatter because of the uncontrolled nature of the
fracture process, and Sabina Mountain Number Two
is no different. The obsidian shatter is probably a
byproduct of the bipolar reduction technique. The
nature of the bipolar technology within the Mimbres and Jornada Mogollon areas was very similar

and consisted of both simple nodule smashing and
the purposeful splitting of oval or elongate nodules
down the long axis in order to take advantage of the
length of the nodule. Bipolar flakes in both groups
were selected to produce small unifacial and bifacial
drills, perforators, and projectile points. The same
technological practice was apparently employed at
Sabina Mountain Number Two based on obsidian
core and debitage similarities and the presence of
small obsidian bifaces (see Brook 1980:55-58).
Direct percussion and bipolar percussion are very

Robinson—The 1977 Investigations of the Sabina Mountain Number Two Site 79
representative of Mimbres and Jornada Mogollon
lithic technology and formed an integral aspect
of the overall technological organization of these
groups (Dockall 1990, 1991; Dockall et al. 1997;
Miller 1989, 1992; Miller and Carmichael 1985).
The only other type of lithic reduction
represented at Sabina Mountain Number Two is
that of biface manufacture. The techniques of direct
percussion and pressure flaking were employed
in the manufacture of bifacial artifacts such as
drills and projectile points. The presence of only
three Stage I bifaces at Sabina Mountain cannot
be used as a measure of the importance (or lack
thereof) of bifaces at the site or within the Jornada
Mogollon in general. The nature of the reduction
process involved more pressure flaking of small
chert and obsidian bifacial preforms than biface
production by direct percussion. This is largely
a phenomenon of the raw material selected for
projectile point manufacture and the small size of
arrow points. All bifaces and arrow points from
Sabina Mountain Number Two were manufactured
from cryptocrystallines such as chalcedony, cherts,
and glassy volcanics. The same trend has been
identified within the arrow point technology from
other Jornada and Mimbres Mogollon sites (see
Brook 1980:55-58; Dockall 1991:220-232).
Broad comparisons of cores with the debitage
reveal that chert was the material most selected
for reduction and for the manufacture of small
modified and unmodified flake tools and projectile
points. Also, the debitage and chipped stone artifact assemblage from Sabina Mountain Number
Two strongly demonstrate that the entire reduction sequence was conducted at and near the site.
This includes raw material selection, procurement,
initial reduction, use, tool maintenance, and final
discard. There is a total of 8223 flakes, fragments,
shatter, and chunks that compose the debitage
sample from Sabina Mountain Number Two. As
stated above, the majority of this material is chert,
but other materials that were observed included
basalt, rhyolite, chalcedony, jasper, obsidian, sandstone, and limestone. This variety of raw material
is probably a reflection of the types of raw material
that occur within the gravels in the vicinity of Sabina Mountain Number Two, with the exception of
obsidian. Future research on this collection should
include a detailed quantification of the various raw
materials within the debitage sample and compare
these proportions to those provided for the tools in
this article.

There was a variety of unmodified and modified flake tools identified from Sabina Mountain
Number Two. Brook (1980) noted the abundance
of very generalized tools in his lithic analysis: utilized flakes, choppers or core tools, flake knives,
and scrapers. The major raw materials that were
identified for the flake tools were chert, agate, and
quartzite (Brook 1980:50). A number of similar
tool types identified by Brook are also noted in this
article, but with the addition of a few new types
that had been identified in other Jornada (Dockall
et al. 1997) and Mimbres assemblages (Dockall
1991). Carinated unifaces were initially defined at
Gobernadora and Ojasen (Dockall et al. 1997) as
a specific type of flake tool and are characterized
by steeply retouched edges that often are either
denticulated or slightly irregular. The distal end is
keel (carina)-shaped and is often the thickest part
of the tool. Use wear indicates that carinated unifaces were used in adzing and scraping activities.
Beaked unifaces have one or two lateral projections
created by direct percussion and were typically employed in various types of graving or incising tasks.
Denticulate unifaces are thinner than either carinated or beaked unifaces and have multiple small
notches created by direct percussion or pressure
flaking along one lateral edge to produce a serrated
appearance; these implements were used in tasks
requiring an edge capable of cutting, shredding,
or sawing. It is significant that only 27 percent of
all the tools identified at Sabina Mountain Number
Two are unifaces or utilized flakes. This proportion is considered to be lower than expected when
compared to similar figures from Gobernadora and
Ojasen (44 and 48 percent, respectively) (Dockall
et al. 1997:Table 10.1). The reason for the lower
value at Sabina Mountain Number Two is probably
largely due to unsystematic collection by artifact
hunters (Brook 1980:44). A detailed analysis of
the debitage collection would also undoubtedly
increase the number of unmodified flakes used
as tools. Agave knives were identified based on
descriptions provided by Shafer (1986) and Shafer
and Holloway (1979). Both were manufactured of
large flakes of limestone and sandstone, suggesting
specific selection of that material for this artifact
type. Based on the size of chert flakes and unifaces,
it is probable that flakes of suitable size could not
be produced from chert and other similar cryptocrystalline materials. Raw material selection at
Sabina Mountain Number Two for the manufacture
of flake tools demonstrates that chert was virtually

80

Texas Archeological Society

the only material utilized. Sandstone and quartzite
were only very occasionally used to manufacture
unifaces or as utilized flakes. Studies indicate that
flake tools recovered from Jornada Mogollon sites
were used to process a variety of plant and animal
resources and for the manufacture of an array of
perishable goods (Dockall et al. 1997; Miller 1989,
1992; O’Laughlin 1979, 1980).
Other classes of tools identified at Sabina
Mountain Number Two can be considered to represent heavy-duty implements. Brook (1980) identified two types of choppers based on size and shape.
The current analysis includes choppers/cobble tools
representing 3.6 percent of the tool assemblage (see
Table 7 and Figure 10b-c). These implements were
manufactured by direct percussion of cobbles,
large pebbles, or large percussion flakes and fall
within the range of variability identified by Brook
(1980:48-50); 44 percent were manufactured from
limestone and quartzite, the remainder being of
chert. The present study identified three choppers/
core tools of chert and three of coarse materials
(sandstone, rhyolite, and quartzite). The presence
of such coarse materials as sandstone, rhyolite,
limestone, and quartzite indicate that these materials occur in a size that provides sufficient mass
and strength for heavy duty chopping, adzing, and
scraping/planing tasks (see Dockall et al. 1997;
Miller 1989:Table 8.17).
As mentioned above, bifacial technology is
almost entirely limited to exhausted and broken
projectile points. There were three chert bifaces
representing the initial stage of manufacture
identified for Sabina Mountain Number Two during this study. Brook (1980) did not identify any
bifacial preforms from the site. Biface technology
is often scarce in Formative lithic assemblages in
the Jornada area (Dockall et al. 1997; Miller 1989,
1992), being more characteristic of Archaic and
Paleoindian assemblages and more mobile settlement systems.
Brook (1980:55-58) briefly discussed the collection of projectile points from Sabina Mountain
Number Two recovered during EPAS testing. He
described them as small and well made and noted
that some preforms were present. Although Brook
did not employ specific type names, several were
illustrated (Brook 1980:Figure 21) that conform to
the Harrell type characteristic of the Late Prehistoric of West Texas and the Panhandle region. Small
triangular arrow points with straight to concave
bases were also common. Excavations by the TAS

recovered a smaller sample of projectile points that
included two San Pedro, one Fairland-like, one undetermined dart point, one Harrell arrow point, two
small triangular forms with concave bases (Figure
11a-b), one arrow barb fragment, three distal fragments, and two miscellaneous arrow fragments (see
Figure 11c-d). Chert, obsidian, and quartzite were
selected for manufacture of small pressure-flaked
bifaces at Sabina Mountain Number Two.
Dart points are represented by the San Pedro
and Fairland-like specimens. According to Turner
and Hester (1993), the Fairland is mainly a central
Texas type that is attributed to the Transitional Archaic period. Roney (1985: Plate 9g-h) identified
Fairland-like points from Hooper Canyon Cave and
Dark Canyon located in the Guadalupe Mountains
of southeastern New Mexico. Beckes (1977:59) described Fairland specimens recovered from surface
survey on the McGregor Guided Missile Range
in Otero County, New Mexico. San Pedro points
were subdivided by Dick (1965:25) into a large and
small variant with small San Pedro points seeming
to occur later in time. At the NAN Ruin, Dockall
(1991:233-234) identified a number of both large
and small San Pedro points, the majority coming from Classic period contexts probably due to
prehistoric scavenging. Dick (1965:23), however,
noted that the smaller variant of San Pedro occurred in Levels I and II of Bat Cave, whereas the
large variant occurred in Levels III through V. San
Pedro points also occurred in the upper portions of
the midden at Ventana Cave without pottery and
into the lower levels of ceramic-bearing deposits
(Haury 1950:289-290). This suggested that the
San Pedro type was in use prior to the inception
of ceramics. Sayles (1983:125) identified the San
Pedro stage as the final phase of the development
of the Cochise Culture and immediately preceded
the Early Pottery horizon of the Mogollon Culture.
Geological evidence and radiocarbon dates have
led to the development of a range of 1500 B.C. to
A.D. 1 for the San Pedro stage. Martin and Rinaldo
(1950:292, 338) described similar points within
the San Francisco and Three Circle phase pithouse
deposits at the Turkey Foot Ridge site in Pine Lawn
Valley. This form has also been recovered from
Swarts Ruin (Cosgrove and Cosgrove 1932:48) and
Mattocks Ruin (Nesbitt 1931:85 and Plate 37k).
Excavations at the Galaz Ruin by the Minnesota
Expedition yielded San Pedro-like points (LeBlanc
1984:240 and Fig. 16.1s). Recent work by Upham
and others (Newton and Upham 1985; Upham et

al. 1986) has provided new dates for the San Pedro
style in southwestern New Mexico from 1500 B.C.
to A.D. 1050, suggesting that this point style is not
a good chronological marker. The dates indicate
that San Pedro points seem to have persisted in
southern New Mexico at least 700 years after their
disappearance in southern Arizona.

There were three drill tips and a perforator
identified in the Sabina Mountain Number Two
assemblage (see Table 7). Each drill tip had a
bending fracture suggesting that it had broken
during use. The tips also had tip crushing and
edge rounding. The tip of the perforator was
smooth with a light polish. These implements

82

Texas Archeological Society

were frequently employed in the manufacture and
repair of perishable implements and other items.
Similar artifacts were described but not illustrated
by Brook (1980:55), who mentions briefly that
three chert drills were recovered in addition to two
“scribes” or burins of chert (Brook 1980:50).
A small amount of battered stone was included
in the lithic assemblage. There were seven hammerstones and four battered cobbles. Together
these categories comprise 5.7 percent of the total
artifact assemblage (see Table 7). Raw materials
included four limestone, two sandstone, one granite, two chert, and one chalcedony. The chert and
chalcedony specimens were hammerstones and may
represent recycled cores. The difference between
hammerstones and battered cobbles is mainly one
of degree and location of battering. Hammerstones
were identified by a more extensive battered surface
overall, whereas battered cobbles were only lightly
battered on a surface or end and had not seen extensive use. Hammerstones and battered cobbles
were employed in stone tool manufacture, mineral
processing, and non-lithic raw material processing.
Another important function of battered artifacts was
that of pecking or resurfacing of the grinding facets
of manos and metates to rejuvenate their abrasive
and crushing properties. There were nine hammerstones recovered by EPAS testing at the site: three
of these were chert, four limestone, one quartzite,
and one from an unidentified sedimentary material
(Brook 1980:48). Selection of limestone, quartzite,
and sandstone materials provided mass, density, and
fracture resistance during use and were probably
specifically selected for these properties.
The ground stone tool component of the assemblage included only fragments of manos and metates
and unidentified fragments (see Table 7). Brook
(1980:44) also discussed the fragmentary nature
of the ground stone tools recovered from Sabina
Mountain Number Two (see Table 5). Ground stone
implements recovered in the TAS testing included
a majority of unidentified fragments comprising 12
percent of the tool assemblage. There were three vesicular basalt, one granite, and 23 of sandstone. All
mano fragments were sandstone (see Figure 10h),
whereas metate fragments included three vesicular
basalt, three granite, one possible rhyolite, and nine
sandstone. Some of the metate fragments were recognizable as portions of trough style metates (see
Figure 10f-g). EPAS excavations recovered both
trough and slab type metates (all were fragmentary;
Figure 10d-e are examples of basin or slab metate

fragments, and Figure 10i-k illustrate metate fragments of unidentifiable type); interestingly, one of
the slab metates mentioned by Brook (1980:44)
was identified as serpentine. The procurement of
pieces of raw material large enough to manufacture metates, especially trough style, suggests the
deliberate acquisition of raw material closer to the
source and transport to Sabina Mountain Number
Two. That fragments dominate the ground stone tool
assemblage may be a phenomenon of recent artifact
collecting discussed by Brook.
A small sample of other ground stone artifacts
was identified in the tool assemblage during analysis. These included four tabular palette fragments
(see Figure 10a; one welded tuff, two tabular sandstone, and one massive sandstone), one sandstone
pendant fragment, and a sandstone pebble that may
have been used as a polishing stone (see Table 7).
Brook (1980) had not originally identified any palettes or fragments during his analysis of the EPAS
material. Their identification during this study adds
to the lithic assemblage from Sabina Mountain
Number Two.
A small assemblage of minerals was recovered
by TAS testing. Mineral types included one each
of muscovite, biotite, calcite (see Figure 11g),
gypsum, hematite, pumice, quartz (see Figure 11f),
and scoria. Hematite was probably selected for its
potential as a pigment source. The presence of scoria and pumice may indicate their use as abrasive
stones. Brook (1980:70) noted five calcite crystals
and suggested that they may have had ritual or
ceremonial use. Sheets of biotite and muscovite
have frequently been found in archeological sites
in the Southwest and were used to manufacture a
variety of small ornaments.
Conclusions
The lithic assemblage from Sabina Mountain
Number Two is logistically oriented toward a
generalized core and flake technology based on
the local lithic resource base. Some lithic materials
such as Rancheria chert and obsidian were probably
acquired by direct and indirect procurement,
indicating a technological need for these materials.
There is some evidence for the specific selection of
broad categories of raw material for the manufacture
of specific artifact types; coarse-grained and dense
materials such as quartzite, sandstone, limestone, and
basalt were procured for heavy duty chopping and
grinding implements. Cherts, obsidian, chalcedony,

Robinson—The 1977 Investigations of the Sabina Mountain Number Two Site 83
jasper, and other cryptocrystallines were selected
for the manufacture of small flake tools and small
bifacial implements. The patterns of procurement
and use of raw material at Sabina Mountain Number
Two compare favorably to other Dona Ana phase
and Formative villages in the Hueco Bolson and
Jornada Mogollon area. The generalized core and
flake technology provided the inhabitants with a
very flexible lithic technology that could be adapted
to the lithic resource base that varied widely in
both quality and type. It was not a simple expedient
technology that was selected by inhabitants merely
because they had no need of more complex methods
of tool manufacture. The selection of this type of
technology is as much a logistical choice based on
knowledge of the raw material resource base as it
was a strategic choice made in relation to a semisedentary lifeway based upon both hunting and
gathering and some agriculture.
Stone and Shell Ornaments
The stone and shell ornaments from the site
(Table 8) reflect the flow of wealth through the

community and the practice and enjoyment of
arts and crafts. Jewelry also served as a material
expression of wealth and prestige. Quartz and calcite
may have been used in ceremonialism and personal
rituals. Stone and mineral types include quartz,
calcite, ochre that was too hard for use as a pigment,
and coral (possibly fossil coral and locally available;
see Figure 11i-l). Crinoid stem sections (see Figure
11e), fossilized in limestone, may also be considered
a mineral useful in jewelry making. Brook (1980:70)
reported turquoise and worked pieces of copper ore
from the site. Shell pieces and fragments, including
a shell pendant (see Figure 11h), were all of marine
shellfish, but none of the fragments could be
attributed to genus. Brook (1980:67-70) reported
genus Olivella from the site.
Pigment Fragments
Four fragments of soft earthen material were
recovered from the site and catalogued (Table 9).
They appear, from superficial inspection, to be
discarded or broken remnants of larger blocks or
crayons of natural earth pigments that prehistoric

Ceramic Analysis
Field notes stated repeatedly that the pottery
on the Sabina Mountain Number Two site was
markedly small in the common size of broken
surface sherds, usually less than 1 cm in longest
dimension. This uncommon situation for a site in
the Southwest is most likely the result of the high
volume of vehicular traffic in the 20th century. The
lab researchers at the TAS field school responded
to this circumstance by culling all the ceramic lots
coming in to the field lab for sherds of larger sizes,
considered by them to be analyzable. They also
culled the ceramics returned from the off-site survey sites. These sherds were catalogued together
as a single lot, 585, and labeled “Selected Types”
(Figure 12). This lot is described and analyzed below. The locale to which they apply is the Sabina
Mountain Number Two site and potentially all the
off-site survey sites. All the remaining ceramics
from the site were catalogued as lots reflecting

their proveniences and by number of specimens
(Appendix 1).
El Paso Brownware types are the dominant
ceramics on the site. The Selected Types are representative of the whole El Paso phase village: not
any room, set of rooms, trash area, or any singular
behavioral context within it. An in-depth description of the selected types, mostly painted local and
non-local types and ceramic artifacts, may help
identify spatial and temporal relationships between
the site and surrounding regions.
The descriptions of the selected types are
followed by a spatial analysis of the ceramics
recovered in and near the room fragment
described above (see Figure 5). The ware and type
designations and counts of the field analysts are
used to gain some information on possible finer
contextual patterns, although the field analysts
did not commonly make type designations.
This grosser level of analysis observes prudent
caution in consideration of the general disruption
and breakage of the ceramic assemblage. This
analysis is not offered for the excavations of
EPAS Room 2 and EPAS Room 3, as field notes
warned repeatedly that recovery from those rooms
originated in the backfill from the 1964-1967
excavations.

Mimbres Classic Black-on-White
(Five body sherds, two rim
sherds, Figure 12a-d)
This small collection is exemplary of the Classic Mimbres type, save for the lack of any naturalistic depiction in the painting. Sherd thicknesses
vary narrowly between 4-6 mm, and the ceramic
pastes are light gray to grayish-tan in color. The
fractured edges have a medium texture and the
diagonal rippling or patterning of the material

common in earthenwares formed by the coiling
technique. Tempering particles are abundant,
namely the oft described “cornmeal-sized” white
grains of feldspar and other igneous rocks and
minerals. Grain colors may also be pink, black,
brown, or glassy. All the sherds belonged to bowls,
their interior surfaces prepared for decoration with
a chalky white slip that is flaking off in some examples, but intact in others. Designs are painted
in black paint, although in two examples firing

vagaries have turned the paint reddish-brown.
The designs are well-matched and well-executed
fields of solid and hatched black paint. One sherd
shows a cross-hatched field on it. All the sherds in
the collection are too small to infer design layouts,
whether rectilinear, curvilinear, or other.
Mimbres Classic Black-on-White is the culmination of a series of painted types belonging to Mogollon Brownware ceramics. This pottery’s origin and
center of development lies in the Mimbres Valley
of southwestern New Mexico. Mimbres Classic
Black-on-White with its systems of lines, painted
fields, and wide array of naturalistic illustrations
and scenes attained a higher level of artisanship than
most other regional Mogollon painted types. Large
amounts of the type were traded into the Tularosa
Basin and also the Hueco Bolson, starting in the
Mesilla phase and peaking in abundance in the Dona
Ana phase. Mimbres Classic Black-on-White was
produced as early as A.D. 1050 until A.D. 1250 and
possibly into the 1300s (Human Systems Research
1973:346; Smiley 1977:173).
Probable Mimbres Classic Black-on-White
Three body sherds belong to Mimbres brownware. They lack definitive identifiers of the Classic
Black-on-White type. They all have the characteristic ceramic paste; a chalky, grayish-white slip;
and minor portions of filled, black decorative
fields. These characteristics and the quality of

design execution are all suggestive of the Mimbres
Classic Black-on-White type. Whether by erosion
or manufacturing variation, two sherds have abundant large tempering particles protruding through
the slip and the exterior surface. The third sherd has
lost most of its slip by flaking. This specimen also
has a beveled edge, the beveling angled inward,
toward the interior. Rather than revealing the former vessel as a reverse-beveled bowl, the beveled
edge is entirely the product of grinding, perhaps
post-breakage.
El Paso Brown
The three El Paso Brown sherds in this lot
are exemplary of the vast majority of ceramics on
the site. Clearly, this pottery is the local ceramic
ware, and it corresponds well with published summaries (Lehmer 1948; Perttula et al. 1995). Sherd
thicknesses range from 4-7 mm. The exterior and
interior surfaces are tan to dark reddish-brown with
frequent dark gray fire clouds. The ceramic interiors are all fully carbonized dark gray. Smoothing
finished the original surfaces. Some surfaces appear to have been planed, indicating occasional finishing by paddling. Horizontal brush marks streak
the interior of one sherd. This same specimen has a
flattened and smoothed rim, and the piece was once
part of a straight-sided, direct rim olla. The other
two sherds belonged to jars. The pastes are all typical of El Paso Brownware, being thickly carbonstreaked as mentioned, and densely tempered with
particles ranging in size from fine sand to coarse
sand. White is the dominant particle color, with
yellow, brown, pink, and a few black particles.
Metallic flecks of mica were also observed. The
dominant mineral is probably feldspar, followed by
quartz. Some of the white and gray particles may
also be limestone. The particles protrude through
all interior and exterior surfaces.
El Paso Brown and El Paso Brownware in
general are distributed throughout the Jornada
Mogollon culture, from eastern Chihuahua to east
of the Pecos River near Wink and Kermit, Texas
(Human Systems Research 1973:331) and constitute the indigenous local ware. The painted types El
Paso Red-on-Brown and El Paso Polychrome derive technologically and aesthetically from El Paso
Brown. The ware was produced throughout the Jornada Mogollon sequence, with a temporal trend of
increased manufacture of El Paso Polychrome and
decreased use of El Paso Brown (Human Systems

Robinson—The 1977 Investigations of the Sabina Mountain Number Two Site 87
Research 1973:331; Perttula et al. 1995:210-219;
Mills 1988:163-164; Smiley 1977:130).
El Paso Red-on-Brown
(Figure 12e-g)
These specimens are three body sherds with the
typical El Paso Brown paste with abundant particles
protruding through all surfaces. They all received the
application of a thin, bright red paint on their exterior
surfaces, hence their typological attribution.
This type is also referred to as El Paso
Bichrome to account for the vagaries of paint color
and ceramic surfaces. El Paso Red-on-Brown and
El Paso Polychrome appeared after A.D. 1000 as
decorative variants of El Paso Brown. Through
time, El Paso Polychrome replaced the bichrome
types. For this reason, El Paso Red-on-Brown may
date narrowly between A.D. 1000 and 1100 (Human Systems Research 1973:332; Perttula et al.
1995:214).
El Paso Polychrome
(Figure 12h)
The type is identified in one small body or neck
sherd of typical El Paso Brown paste with remnants
of painted bands or thick lines on both surfaces.
Both sides have a black-painted field, and one side
has a brownish-gray line or band in addition to the
black band. A portion of one design field is medium
reddish-brown, but this hue may be due to a firing
variation. The sherd is 5 mm thick.
Dulaney and Pigott (1977:281-282) identified
paste differences between El Paso Polychrome and
its progenitor El Paso Brown, but these differences
were not observed in the Sabina Mountain Number
Two sample. Ceramic paste and particle variations
may have been more pronounced in later time
periods as design and technology diverged in the
pottery. The designs and variants that constitute El
Paso Polychrome appeared at about A.D. 1000 and
developed through about A.D. 1450. The type may
have given rise to painted pottery types in the protohistoric period (Perttula et al. 1995:212-214).
Jornada Brown
(Figure 12i-j)
Two body sherds are exemplary of Jornada Brownware. Both sherds have varying

reddish-brown to medium tan colors with gray fire
clouds on their surfaces. They vary from 6-8 mm in
thickness. They contrast unmistakably with El Paso
Brownware in having no carbon streak and fewer
tempering particles in a more restricted and smaller
size range (fine sand-sized appears to be modal).
Further, the particles appear to be predominantly
quartz sand, with smaller amounts of feldspar. No
particles protrude through the surfaces; instead,
surfaces are well smoothed (possibly polished in
one case) with minute networks of fire-crazing on
the exteriors.
Jornada Brown, also known as Jornada Plain,
is distinguished from El Paso Brown in having a
generally lighter paste and surface color, smaller
particle sizes, and smoothed to polished surfaces.
The Sabina Mountain Number Two sherds show
these differences distinctly. The type is distributed
throughout the Jornada area, and it may have been
derived technologically from Alma Plain. The
cross-dating of the type suggests a period of production between A.D. 900 and 1350 (Human Systems Research 1973:328-329; Smiley 1977:172).
Galisteo Black-on-White
(Figure 12l)
One sherd belongs to this type. It is 5 mm
thick, and once belonged to a bowl. The paste is
even-textured, yellowish-gray, and tempered with
gray, fine particles. The interior bowl surface has a
chalky, yellowish-white slip and black-filled lines
and design fields. The filling is uneven, however,
with some areas thinner and grayish, others thick
and black. Also, the black fields have an observable
glossy finish that may be incidental glazing or semiglazing of the paint. This effect may be accidental
or deliberate in the development of the technology.
Galisteo Black-on-White is a carbon-paint
type named for the Galisteo basin of northern New
Mexico where it originated. It is a relatively rare
intrusive, or imported, ceramic type in the Jornada
branch and Hueco Bolson. The type is poorly
dated, but Puebloan settlement in the Galisteo
basin developed in the A.D. 1200s and continued into Historic times (Mills 1988:168; Smiley
1977:197; Stuart and Gauthier 1984:99). Galisteo
Black-on-White has been described as a synonym
for McElmo Black-on-White based on collections
from the Gallinas Springs Pueblo, LA 1178, and
dated between A.D. 1250 and 1350 (Eidenbach
1982:157).

88

Texas Archeological Society
Three Rivers Red-on-Terracotta
(Figure 12m)

The type is represented by one bowl rim sherd.
The sherd lacks any painting, but the type is revealed
by the bright, light terracotta surface color. Polish
covers the surfaces, including the rounded, direct
rim. The thickest part of the sherd is 6 mm and the
interior has a 3 mm carbon streak. The tempering
material includes numerous white and black particles, modally coarse sand-sized. The terracotta
surfaces appear to have been achieved by the application of a thick slip of that color to all surfaces.
Three Rivers Red-on-Terracotta is a type of
the Three Rivers redwares and is closely synonymous with San Andres Red-on-Terracotta, although
Smiley (1977:165) found them distinguishable in
the southern Tularosa basin. The distinction was
made on the basis of painted line width, paste
color, surface color, and temper particle sizes. Mills
(1988:167), working in the same region, found
it prudent to class the types together as Undifferentiated Red-on-Terracotta. Smiley (1977:165)
suggested that the best dating of the types, however conjoined, was between A.D. 1150-1300,
while Mills (1988:167) noted that the types were
produced no earlier than A.D. 1100. The type was
traded widely, but the core area of production was
the northern Tularosa basin and neighboring mountains (Human Systems Research 1973:333-334).
Pecos Glaze I
(Figure 12k)
The single specimen of this type is a shoulder/
neck jar sherd. It is 6 mm thick. The interior surface
is brownish-orange, and the exterior is yellowishbrown. The ceramic paste is ashy gray, mediumtextured, with moderate-to-fine white, black, and
gray particles. The interior and exterior surfaces appear to have been layered with orange slips. Design
elements on the exterior are dark gray blobs, or free
elements, and a reddish-gray line. The blobs’ outlines
are blurred and indistinct, as though melting into the
surroundings. Some of the core particles similarly
have obscured outlines. These qualities are typical
of glazed ceramics, especially when higher firing
temperatures were attempted to achieve the glaze.
Pecos Glaze I refers to its temporal position as
the first of a sequence of glazed types in the central
Rio Grande area and surrounding regions. In the
Jornada branch it was an imported ware and of

rare occurrence. The sequence of early glaze types
is also called the Agua Fria Glaze-on-Red Type
Cluster (Human Systems Research 1973:361).
Pecos Glaze I dates between A.D. 1350 and 1425,
but some research suggests that it may have been
produced as late as the sixteenth century (Mills
1988:168).
Unknown painted
This type is represented by one bowl rim sherd
decorated by one wavy line of purplish-brown
paint. The wavy line runs under the rim on the
exterior surface. The straight rim is flattened and
polished. The core has a thick carbon streak and
few, but coarse-sized, white tempering particles.
The exterior was smoothed, and the interior was
finished by smoothing and brushing. Few particles
appear on the surfaces. These qualities contrast
with El Paso Brownware. The sherd measures 5
mm at its thickest.
Ceramic Inventory of Room
Fragment, 110N
These ceramic designations and counts come
from the excavation forms recorded for the clearing of the room fragment (see Figure 5). As such,
the collection includes ceramics from the near-floor
context, the modern ground surface, adjacent extramural areas, and some items transported from other
areas of the site. A very generalized picture of the
ceramics in use at the time of occupation of this
room may be gained by these ceramics (Table 11).
Table 11 demonstrates amply the dominance
of El Paso Brownware on this part of the site, the
corresponding popularity of El Paso Polychrome
in the El Paso phase and the lack of potential for
fine-grained analysis of the ceramic assemblage.
The lack of potential is attributable to the postoccupational disturbances of the site, notably the
20th century impacts.
Ceramic Discussion and Comparisons
As a group, the studied ceramic types in Lot
585 suggest time periods earlier than those accepted
for the El Paso phase and earlier than the specific
archeomagnetic assays (early 1400s) derived from
the site. Bear in mind that the selected types also
came from the off-site survey sites, at least one

of which, 41EP4436, was clearly identified as
having a Dona Ana phase component (see off-site

group as a whole is the A.D. 1200s, with some
types more common between A.D. 1100 and 1200,
and a few in production as late as A.D. 1350. The
archeomagnetic assays suggest a site occupation in
the late A.D. 1300s into the 1400s.

Playas Red Incised is a widely distributed Chihuahuan type of later time periods, and Lincoln
Black-on-Red is a companion type of Three Rivers
Red-on-Terracotta, of the Three Rivers Red Wares
(Human Systems Research 1973:326-327).
In addition to these types, Brook (1980:67)
identified the following ceramic types from his
Sabina Mountain Number Two site excavations.
They are listed in order of abundance:
• El Paso Polychrome

• Chupadero Black-on-White

• El Paso Brown

• Possible Pecos glazed sherd

• El Paso Smudged

• Alma Plain

• Chupadero Black-on-White

• Playas Red Incised

• Mimbres Black-on-White

• Lincoln Black-on-Red

• Ramos Polychrome

The catalog forms and excavation forms make it
clear also that El Paso Polychrome is the most
common painted type on the site, and Chupadero
Black-on-White and Mimbres Classic Black-onWhite are common as well. Numerous Jornada
Brown sherds were found. Chupadero Black-onWhite is a common trade pottery type belonging to
the Chupadero White Ware of the Jornada district

Carmichael (1986:68) and Whalen (1977:153,
1978:59) both searched for ceramic groupings in
settlements of each phase in the sequence established by Lehmer (1948). The groupings they discovered were then defined as ceramic associations.
When these associations were identified on site
surfaces during survey, the phase attribution of the
site could be made. Whalen (1977:153, 1978:59)
did not establish ceramic associations for the Dona
Ana phase; he distinguished only between the Mesilla and El Paso phases. The only ceramic trait of
the Mesilla phase was El Paso Brown sherds. The
diagnostic ceramic associations of the El Paso
phase include the following list of non-local trade
types, in addition to El Paso Polychrome:
• Chupadero Black-on-White
• Mexican Polychromes
• Playas Red, Plain, or Incised
• Three Rivers Red-on-Terracotta
• Corrugated Wares (various types)
• Mimbres Black-on-White
• Other intrusives (unspecified)
The Mexican Polychromes listed above include various painted types, including the Ramos
Polychrome type found at Sabina Mountain Number Two. The term is equivalent to Chihuahuan
Polychromes used by Carmichael (1986:68) in his
list below. Playas Red types are also Chihuahuan.
These and the Chihuahuan painted types originated
in the region surrounding Casas Grandes and are
found in abundance there.
Carmichael (1986:68) established ceramic associations for the Dona Ana and El Paso phases.
The associations for the Dona Ana phase are:
• Late El Paso Brown
• Early El Paso Polychrome
• Chupadero Black-on-White
• Mimbres Black-on-White
• El Paso Bichrome

For the El Paso phase, Carmichael (1986:72)
listed the following ceramic types:
• El Paso Polychrome
• Chupadero Black-on-White
• Three Rivers Red-on-Terracotta,
• Lincoln Black-on-Red
• Los Lunas Smudged Corrugated
• Gila Polychrome
• Heshotauthla Glaze Polychrome
• Chihuahuan Polychromes
To Carmichael (1968:72), the main differences
between the ceramics of the El Paso phase and the
earlier Dona Ana phase were the (1) presence of
the Chihuahuan Polychromes in the El Paso phase,
(2) the absence of Mimbres Black-on-White in the
El Paso phase, and (3) the shift to the later El Paso
Polychrome ceramics in the El Paso phase. Carmichael and Whalen agreed on the appearance of
Mexican/Chihuahuan pottery types, corrugated or
otherwise surface-modified types, and pottery from
the northern Tularosa basin district (Three Rivers
Red-on-Terracotta and Lincoln Black-on-Red) in
the El Paso phase.
The direct ceramic cross-dating and comparison of the site pottery to these ceramic associations leave the Sabina Mountain Number Two
assemblage within the limits of the El Paso phase,
but with some admixture or introduction of Dona
Ana phase diagnostic ceramics to the site. The
site yielded, in quantity, all the diagnostic pottery
types of the El Paso phase and minor quantities
of Dona Ana phase pottery in addition to those
shared between them. Furthermore, the cross-dating of the common ceramic diagnostics seems to
position the site chronologically somewhat earlier
than the archeomagnetic assays would suggest. A
reasonable explanation for this situation is that the
site occupation began earlier in the El Paso phase
than the specific contexts sampled for archeomagnetic assay, and earlier Dona Ana ceramics were
brought in from neighboring Dona Ana sites as
curiosities or novelties. An outside possibility is
that the El Paso phase occupations were built on
an earlier Dona Ana phase component of the site;
however, there are no architectural hints at a Dona
Ana component. Additionally, the broad patterning of the burned rock distributions relates heavily

Robinson—The 1977 Investigations of the Sabina Mountain Number Two Site 91
to the El Paso phase structures and features, not to
any identifiable earlier activity areas or structures
offset from the El Paso phase constructions. For
there to have been a Dona Ana component at the
site, the El Paso component would have had to
have been built exactly on the prior component
and have grown outward from it. The site lacks
any spatial patterns that might indicate this situation. The only Dona Ana occupational indications
are the recovered ceramics.
Altogether, the ceramics from the TAS field
school and the EPAS excavations well characterize
the material culture of the site and its occupations.
However, limitations of the ceramic data and field
school methodology must be presented as caveats.
The first is that a site-wide grab sample of analyzable pottery probably is inadequate to characterize
the ceramic assemblage of a Formative village. Reliable ceramic profiles are gained from excavation
sampling of stratified deposits such as middens and
room fills and floors. Such excavations were not
part of the TAS field school strategy. The serendipitous finding of the room fragment provided some
excavated ceramic data that showed only broad patterning. This view of the site ceramic complex was
refined by the incorporation of wider site surface
collections and the findings of the Brook (1980)
excavations. The second limitation relates to scales
of analysis. The fine tuning of ceramic cross-dating
by Whalen and Carmichael, who wrote about later
El Paso Brown, later El Paso Polychrome, etc.,
was based on studies of numerous vessel shapes
and rim forms drawn from rim sherds in quantity.
Vessels and rim sherds were simply not available
on the Sabina Mountain Number Two site in sufficient numbers to allow such fine-grained studies.
The forces of site deterioration, amply cited, have
had their effects, resulting in a pronounced loss of
archeological data.
Hunting/Gathering and Agricultural
Artifact Ratios
A comparison of hunting/gathering and agricultural functions implied in the artifact assemblages
from the Sabina Mountain Number Two site can
indicate some of the social and economic activities
of the site. Grouping artifact classes according
to their implied functions may show broadly
the relative balance of subsistence strategies.
Accordingly, artifact categories were grouped
as hunting/gathering, agricultural, or multiple.

The category multiple may suggest combined
or alternating hunting/gathering and agricultural
activities, or it may imply uses entirely apart from
economic pursuits. The large and small burned
rock features may have served hunting/gathering
and agricultural uses. Ceramic vessels are likewise
strongly multi-functional and were used by both
hunting/gathering and agricultural peoples that
lived in the Hueco Bolson. The pigment samples
may have been used in craft and artistic pastimes
unrelated to any economic activity.
For identification and classification purposes,
the artifact assemblages of Dockall (see above)
and Brook (1980) were used. The functional attributions of Dockall are preferred over Brook’s as
they are based on a larger body of research, much
of it since Brook’s study. Another consideration is
the function of ground stone artifacts. Functional
typologies attribute slab and basin metates and
circular or pestle-type manos to the processing of
gathered foods; trough metates and rectangular and
lenticular manos were apparently innovated more
efficiently to process cultivated grains, including
maize (Hard 1986; Lancaster 1984; Robinson et al.
1985). Dockall distinguished both slab and trough
metate categories in the TAS and EPAS collections.
Similarly, circular, pestle-like, rectangular and
wedge-shaped or lenticular manos were identified
in the assemblages.
A few categories fell out of the analysis as
they lacked multiple or economic functions. The
Dockall categories left out were the ground stone
fragments (a catchall category of items lacking
type attributes) and the beads and pendant fragment (personal adornment). The Brook categories excluded were the cruciform and altar piece
(symbolic/ceremonial functions) and the stone
bowl (single function, problematic identification).
In Table 12 below, the letter D denotes a Dockall
category, the letter B a Brook category.
A significant limitation of this method
must be recognized. The comparisons made are
category-to-category only, and do not include
artifact frequencies as a comparative element.
Categories weigh equally throughout the analysis;
in other words, a category having one artifact to
represent it has the same weight, or significance,
as a category with dozens of artifacts. Quantified
artifact comparisons might reveal more detail
on economic and technological activities on the
site, but they would also introduce the crippling
factor of recovery bias, this on a site known to

have suffered long term relic collecting (a process
famous for selective artifact removal). A categoryto-category comparison of equal weighting has
relatively more reliability, although it gives up the
explanatory range of quantified artifact-to-artifact
comparisons in an ideal setting. With this method,
the ratios reported are also percentages of the total
number of categories used in the analysis. In the
first analysis below, the denominator is 31; in the
second analysis, the denominator is 28 due to the
removal of three categories.
Inspection of Table 12 shows that hunting/
gathering artifact classes predominate in the assemblage, with hunting/gathering: multiple or
multi-functional: agricultural proportions of 3.5:
3.3 :1 (denominator of 31). The picture of hunting/
gathering dominance may be constrained prudently
by removing from the analysis the classes of tools/
resources used to make tools (not directly applied
in an activity). These are the stone cores, bipolar
cores, and split pebbles, removed from the hunter/
gatherer list. The resulting ratio is 2.8: 3.3: 1 (denominator of 28). Multi-functional tools are clearly
more useful to the site inhabitants than either of
the more focused areas of endeavor, but hunting/
gathering activities when compared directly to
agricultural activities received more emphasis in

4

terms of the elaboration of technology involved
with them.
Further observations add to the picture (with
artifact frequencies and percentages added for clarity), notably the multiple or multi-functional classes
of utilized flakes (n=17, 8.8 percent of the TAS lithic
assemblage), unifaces (n=4, 2.1 percent), carinated
unifaces (n=8, 4.2 percent) and denticulate unifaces
(n=1, 0.5 percent). These classes, while multi-functional for their purposes in cutting and sawing, favor
the processing of pelts of relatively thin-skinned
animals such as rabbits. Dockall observed (see
above) that the proportions of unifaces and utilized
flakes, while significant, are actually lower than
other analyzed sites in the Hueco Bolson (Shafer et
al. 1999). The drills (n=3, 1.6 percent) and perforator (n=1, 0.5 percent) facilitate the manufacture of
nets, commonly applied in capturing small game.
These artifact types may suggest an emphasis on the
collecting and processing of small game, supported
inferentially by the preponderance of small mammal
bones reported in the faunal analysis (McClure, see
below). Compare these likely small game tools with
the dart points (n=4, 2.1 percent) and arrow points
(n=11, 5.7 percent), which are applied to the acquisition of larger game, and they suggest an emphasis at
the site on the procurement of larger game.

Robinson—The 1977 Investigations of the Sabina Mountain Number Two Site 93
This measure of overall economic activity by
proportions of functional artifact classes gives a
clear result in terms of material technology. The
study of artifact ratios alone, however, measures
little of the actual conduct of economic life and
none of the caloric yield to the site inhabitants of
the various implied food-getting strategies.

ECOLOGICAL ANALYSIS
The field school collected the bones of
vertebrates from widely distributed surface
collection and excavation units. This collection of
faunal specimens was sent to William L. McClure
of Houston, Texas, for species identification.

Vertebrate Remains
by William L. McClure
A few bones of vertebrates were recovered
during the project (Table 13). Most of the bones
were small fragments and could not be identified.
A few bones were weathered and may not be associated with the prehistoric occupation. Most of
the fragments are blue-black in color due to exposure to fire. Some of the others have apparently
been somewhat polished, perhaps by wind action.
Identification as to the animals involved is limited
to rabbit (Sylvilagus sp.), jackrabbit (Lepus californicus), and ground squirrel (Spermophilus sp.).
Summation of the identified elements of
the faunal assemblage helps the identification

of patterns in the data. The most frequently
identified taxon was small mammals, with 16
elements. The large mammal category included
one element, as did the small bird identification
and the identified species of jackrabbit, ground
squirrel, and rabbit. These species are common
in the immediate site area today. It is probable
that the burned specimens reflect actual animals
procured for food, but the unburned items suggest
animals that may have died naturally on the site
during and since the occupation. The faunal data
are sufficient to show that hunting and collecting
of animal resources, especially small mammals,
were contributory economic activities of the site’s
inhabitants.

Floral Analysis
The flotation analysis
The 1977 field school sampled various contexts for plant macrofossil flotation. The flotation
of all the samples in 2003 recovered very little. The
minimal finds are presented in Table 14.
The recovered specimens were unidentifiable as
to species; however, these scant finds do not imply
that the Sabina Mountain Number Two site has a
poor preservation environment or that the ancient
village contained few economic plant species.
Brook (1980) reported a more ambitious program of
floral analysis, including the taking of macrofloral
and pollen samples. John W. Green (1980:79-86)

Robinson—The 1977 Investigations of the Sabina Mountain Number Two Site 95
conducted the macrofloral analysis, and he identified quantities of wild and domesticated economic
plant parts. He listed maize (Zea mays, eight- and
10-rowed cobs), tepary bean (Phaseolus acutifolius
var. latifolius), mesquite (Prosopis juliflora), and
yucca (Yucca torreyi and/or Y. baccata).

of overlap for probabilistic assays, and it covers a
period in the middle of the time span of the El Paso
phase as conventionally dated. The technical data
of the Museum of New Mexico assays are reported
in Table 16 for accuracy checking.

THE OFF-SITE SURVEY
CHRONOLOGY
The Sabina Mountain Number Two site when
investigated appeared to be a single component
El Paso phase village of the Jornada branch of the
Mogollon culture, dating ca. A.D. 1200-1450. The
TAS field school had a commitment to direct dating
the site in order to help refine its place in regional
and areal chronologies. The sources of dating at
the Sabina Mountain Number Two site were fired
clay archeomagnetic samples, radiocarbon samples
(charred wood and vegetal materials), and artifactual cross dating. To date, the radiocarbon samples
have not been run to derive their assays.
Archeomagnetism
Archeomagnetism dating samples were taken
from two loci in the site, the EPAS Room 9 and an
unreported context. The sampling and chronological
work were performed initially by the Earth Sciences
Observatory of the University of Oklahoma. Chronometric assays of the two contexts were reported
to the Society without corrections or technical data.
The Museum of New Mexico Archeomagnetism
Laboratory reanalyzed the cube samples in 1995.
They reported all curve probabilities and technical
data. Table 15 compares their findings.
The calendar age estimates of the Museum of
New Mexico assays are derived from the master
polar curve of the Museum of New Mexico Archaeomagnetic Laboratory. All four assays overlap in their calendar age estimates from ca. A.D.
1339 to 1365. This is a remarkably narrow range

The 600 acre survey in one week’s time
found 34 prehistoric archeological sites; this
accomplishment was facilitated by the 94 field
school attendees who participated in it. The overall
method of the survey was pedestrian transect
survey. The survey areas were located by use of
a development map (termed the Horizon Land
Co. map), which showed roads and trails, thereby
aiding transportation across the basin. The actual
walking transects were 15 m wide and had varying
lengths. They were mapped ultimately on the
USGS 7.5' Quadrangle topographic map of the
area (Helms West Well). The survey plots and
their transects were emplaced intentionally over a
variety of basin environments in order to obtain a
representative sample of the archeological remains
present on the landscape. For practical purposes,
the field school surveyors were divided into small
teams varying in size from three to six individuals.
The teams dispersed daily to their assigned transect
locations by vehicle or on foot. Transects were
grouped in parallel, their edges contiguous. Each
transect was walked by only a single team member;
it was expected, therefore, that each team would
walk several transects per day.
When a site was found, the entire team worked
to define the site and its limits. The team completed
a standard TAS field school site form, including a
sketch site plan, and scheduled the site for a revisit
by the field school photography team. The survey
team made surface artifact collections of some of
the sites, employing various methods.

vey. The sites conform to the patterns of regional
sites found in the Hueco Bolson (Mayer-Oakes
1979:15-16). It should be noted that sites of all
reported types and time periods were found in three
environments: basin bottoms, basin bottoms with
sand dunes, and basin margins. These zones correspond to Mayer-Oakes’ (1979:15) Hueco Bolson
flatlands, large sand dune fields, and intra-bolson
hills, respectively.
The recorded sites from the off-site survey
display the material variety of Hueco Bolson prehistory save for the lack of Paleoindian finds. The
dimensions of site types, environment, and cultural
components reveal meaningful patterns and invite
further analysis and interpretation. It should be noted that site forms were begun on three additional
sites, but these site recordings were left in such
incomplete states by the surveyors that they could
not be entered into the state site files and receive
official trinomial designations. These sites are left
out of the site total and following analyses.

major environmental categories: basin margins and
basin bottoms, or flats. The distinction between

dunes and non-dunes is relative and fluctuating,
as discussed in the site spatial analysis; these two
variants are collapsed into the basin bottom category.
The site types used on the following tables are those
given to them by the field surveyors. As such,
they are descriptive, with cultural and economic
functions implied but not explicit.
The emphasis on site locations in the basin
bottom is overwhelming. It is notable, too, that
whereas one site type is restricted to the basin
margin, seven are found only in the basin bottom
(see Table 18). The pattern is pronounced, but the
sample of sites is small. Also, the basin bottom is
a vastly larger geographic area, and this may be
reflected in an imbalance in the proportions of acreage surveyed per environmental zone. Summary
breakdown statistics on the survey transects and
their acreages were not found in the off-site survey
records, however.
As a further observation, the basin bottom
contains more of the simpler and smaller site types
such as burned rock scatters, lithic scatters, and
others, while the basin margin has fewer but more
complex sites (ceramic and lithic scatters with

hearths, lithic scatters with hearths, and artifact
and lithic scatters with hearths). This finding
may well reveal a prehistoric pattern of greater
emphasis or shift to exploitation of resources of
the basin margins during the Puebloan occupations,
as identified in some site-settlement models (Hard
1983; Mauldin 1986; Whalen 1977, 1981, 1994).
The basin bottom, however, with its larger numbers
of small sites with burned rock and hearths, is not
to be disregarded as a primary zone of economic

2

exploitation throughout prehistory. Small sites with
burned rock features are consonant with extensive
foraging, targeted logistical mobility, and other
human food acquisition strategies.
Table 19 breaks down the site types by their
stage and phase attributions, determined by the
diagnostic artifacts and features found on them.
Mesilla phase components have left the greatest
imprint on the surveyed landscape, with 11 dated
components, followed in numbers by six El Paso

100

Texas Archeological Society

phase components. Archaic stage components are
more frequently mixed with other components
(Archaic-Mesilla, Archaic and El Paso, and
Archaic through Dona Ana) than they are found
singly. Of the four recorded isolated finds, one
is an Archaic projectile point (found on the
Bolson bottom), and the remaining three are a
non-diagnostic thick biface, a basal fragment of a
biface, and a sotol knife.
The spatial patterning illustrated in Table 20
is simply the prevailing numerical emphasis on
the basin bottom by components of all phases and
stages. The lesson here perhaps is that numbers by
themselves do not reveal, in simplistic fashion, the
changing patterns of prehistoric settlement.
A final observation on the off-site survey finding regards the cluster of six basin bottom sites:
41EP4433 through 41EP4438. One-half mile
separates the most distant of the sites (41EP4433
and 41EP4436) from each other. The cluster contains the largest site on the survey, 41EP4436, the
Dona Ana component that may comprise a village residential site. As well, the site cluster has
three identified Archaic components. Prehistoric
interest in this site locale may be explained by the
occurrence of all these sites along the lower channel and around the mouth of a very long arroyo.
Mapped as an intermittent stream, the arroyo heads
in the Hueco Mountains to the east, a distance of
about 5 km. Prehistorically and today, the arroyo
has a higher probability of intercepting and channelizing the precipitation of scattered summer
thunderstorms than arroyos of shorter length. The
lower channel and mouth would therefore have
soils of predictably higher moisture content and
perhaps also had seasonal ponding of water. The
zone would have yielded more abundant wild plant

growth and also have supported fields of cultigens
planted as part of an opportunistic dry farming
strategy. The potential for supporting the irrigation component of an agricultural intensification
strategy is also good.

SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS

The Sabina Mountain Number Two site is
an El Paso phase village in the Hueco Bolson of
far West Texas. The village, having perhaps as
few as 25 and as many as 50 rooms, varies from
typical El Paso phase village plans in having its
architecture oriented to the northwest-southeasttrending ridgeline on which it sits rather than to the
cardinal directions, although the rooms themselves
are close to cardinal orientations. The site has lines of
contiguous rooms and additional free-standing rooms.
The village as a whole is formed of the replication
of domestic units with an apparent lack of structures
serving systemic, community-wide functions.
The site artifact assemblage suggests an
emphasis on hunting and gathering subsistence
strategies, although agricultural products (maize,
beans) and technology (ground stone artifacts,
digging and chopping tools) contribute to the site
artifact inventory. Ceramics are dominated by El
Paso brownware, including El Paso Red-on-Brown
and El Paso Polychrome. The ceramic inventory
includes various Chihuahuan types, Chupadero
Black-on-White, additional non-local trade types,
and minor amounts of Mimbres pottery. Altogether,
the ceramics can be associated with both the Dona
Ana and El Paso phases, although the El Paso
phase is preponderant. It is probable that earlier
Dona Ana ceramics were brought to the village
as curiosities and art objects.
What is certain about the SaTable 20. Numbers of stage or phase components

Robinson—The 1977 Investigations of the Sabina Mountain Number Two Site 101
School animal remains showed a predominance of
small mammal bones, suggesting an emphasis on
the collecting of cottontails and jackrabbits. One
large mammal bone, of a deer-sized animal, was
also identified.
Notable aspects of the site setting and regional
settlement pattern were brought to light by the TAS
Field School off-site survey. The first finding is
the location of the village near a zone of moistureretaining Mimbres series soils, favorable for cropgrowing. Smaller sites in the surrounding basin
environment ranged in age and cultural affiliation
from the Archaic stage through the El Paso phase.
The majority of the sites are artifact scatters. Eighteen of these also contained stone hearths. One site
(41EP4433) held a burned rock accumulation dense
enough to qualify as a burned rock midden. Perhaps
all the recorded sites served as temporary camps for
gathering and processing basin resources. Water
control features or elements of irrigation technology
were not observed during the off-site survey.
The Sabina Mountain Number Two site as an
El Paso phase village raises the persistent question
about the existence of an arid zone Puebloan settlement dependent on agriculture without evidence of
irrigation technology. Perhaps the best explanation
for this apparent quandary is Mauldin’s (1986)
settlement model, which is part of the radiating
settlement system model (Hard 1983). Mauldin’s
(1986) model focuses entirely on the El Paso phase.
In Mauldin’s (1986) concept, agricultural villages
may have been established in well-watered mountain flanks and along the river, where fields were
planted. Hueco Bolson villages may have held a
portion of their residents year-round; field produce
was brought to them after harvest (Mauldin 1986).
The Sabina Mountain Number Two site yielded
the remains of maize and tepary bean as agricultural produce and mesquite and yucca remains as
evidence of gathered resources. The summer- and
early fall-ripening wild resources (O’Laughlin
1978:254; Whalen 1978:37) may have provided
the stimulus to occupy the basin villages in full,
after the season of crop growing along the river.
Mesquite was abundant throughout the basin, as
was yucca. The seeds and beans of mesquite were
available well into the fall. Cactus fruits and the
seeds of numerous grasses ripened in the summer.
Nuts and acorns could have been harvested in the
fall and winter in the mountain flanks and intermontane valleys and canyons. Agave could have
been collected and processed on the basin flanks

and mountain slopes. The basin tracts of Mimbres
series soils may have been planted for supplemental fall gardens, cultivated on a dry farming basis.
Cottontail and jackrabbit pelts attained their finest
quality in the late fall and early winter.
Dalton (1977) provides a framework for
understanding trade interaction in egalitarian, or
stateless, societies. Trade between non-local partners circulated goods widely, and the interactions
supported lineage and clan relations, political
alliances, and ceremonialism. Imported goods,
termed primitive valuables, brought in foodstuffs
and prestige for trading partners and their lineages.
Dalton (1977) also pointed out that marriage partners were traded to lineages appropriate for such
arrangements. These transactions strengthened
affinal relationships and alliances.
As trading relations were reciprocal, similar
goods were exported on the network. For purposes
of identifying the operation of a network, both
imported goods and exported goods and services
must be identified or posited. Non-local primitive
valuables found in the Hueco Bolson and the Sabina Mountain Number Two site are:
• extra-regional fine ceramics
• turquoise
• marine shell
Coral jewelry beads may have been imported or
possibly manufactured from fossil coral outcropping within the region. Foodstuffs and other perishables may not have entered the archeological
record. Further, Dockall (this study) proposes that
obsidian and higher quality cherts were gained by
direct or indirect procurement as part of logistical
choices in lithic technology and precise knowledge
of the lithic resource base.
Likely export valuables from the site and wider
Bolson settlement system include:
• rabbit fur blankets and pelts
• mesquite beans and flour
• agave meal
• shellwork
• crinoid stem beads
Dalton (1977:195) has cautioned that a simplistic network of exchanges among equal lineages
and clans was modified in the neighborhood of a

102

Texas Archeological Society

hierarchical society, especially a political state. He
cited the ethnographic example of the African Tallensi, which existed in the political orbit of kingdoms
such as the Mamprusi. This situation prevailed in
the Jornada Mogollon, owing to the existence of
the regional center of Casas Grandes in Chihuahua (Schaafsma 1979; Wimberly 1979). States (or
paramount chiefdoms) such as Casas Grandes mediated elite trade through the center, and restricted
or blocked trade in certain goods. In the Southwest,
elite trade in macaw feathers would be an example.
States also imposed a “king’s peace” on hostile
relations, thus obviating the need for alliances built
on security concerns. At times, states demanded
primitive valuables as tribute, for which there was
no reciprocation. In their own periods of conflict,
political elites levied warriors from their satellite
villages. All such exchanges and transfers could be
expected to have taken place under the control of the
regional center of Casas Grandes. These higher-level
transactions and obligations would have served to
tie the fortunes of the village hinterland to those of
the hierarchical center.
The causes of the abandonment of vast areas
of the Jornada Mogollon branch may lie in this
conceptual arena rather than that of environmental
deterioration. The residents of the Sabina Mountain
Number Two site and the Hueco Bolson as a whole
may have, by their site settlement and economic
strategies, attained sustainable levels of abundance
in an arid environment. This was no mean achievement. The final abandonment of large territories at
the end of the El Paso phase may have followed the
collapse of significant portions of the alliance and
economic network of which the Jornada Mogollon
people were a part.

ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS
The greatest thanks and gratitude go to the
attendees of the 1977 TAS Field School. That
diverse group of people, united by a common
purpose, endured the hot desert summer to reveal
the Sabina Mountain Number Two Site. The
group’s leadership, Dr. William J. Mayer-Oakes,
John Montgomery, Alston Thoms, and Philip
Bandy, met its charge to make the field school
a highly educational project and a keen and
challenging learning experience. Dr. Thoms, now
of Texas A&M University, is especially credited

for his willingness to answer questions and share
his insights with the author more than 30 years
after the field school. In the long interval between
fieldwork and publication, TAS members showed
caring stewardship of the artifacts and records,
none more than Bill Richmond. Ron W. Ralph
clarified many issues with the maps and served as
the project manager for publication of this report.
In this latter role, Ron displayed the primary virtue
of patience. At the Texas Archeological Research
Laboratory (TARL), Carolyn Spock, head of
records, and Laura Nightengale, head of collections,
gave profound advice and unlimited access to the
41EP4 maps, excavation records, and artifacts.
Previous holders of the publication contract, Linda
Wootan Ellis and Palma Buttles-Valdez, collated
the voluminous records and computerized the
final artifact and sample catalog. Monica Trejo of
TARL worked digital magic to produce the artifact
photographs. Another wizard of the cyber realm,
Christa Riddington, prepared the maps, diagrams,
and photographs for publication.

The 1991 and 1992 Texas Archeological Society Field School
Excavations at the Fasken Site (41RR14),
Red River County, Texas

Daniel J. Prikryl, with contributions by Timothy K. Perttula and Nancy G. Reese

ABSTRACT
The 1991 and 1992 Texas Archeological Society Field School excavations at the Fasken Site (41RR14) in
Red River County, Texas, provided significant archeological data on the site’s chronological history and on
two of its three Caddo mounds. A total of 52 features were recorded and 6,769 artifacts were recovered. The
excavations also supplied materials for two radiocarbon and four Oxidizable Carbon Ratio (OCR) dates.
Excavations at Area A, on the terrace edge on the western periphery of the site, had the most intensive evidence of residential occupation. There, the largest numbers of lithic and ceramic artifacts were found along
with daub and fire-cracked rocks. The lithic assemblage from this locale includes some evidence of Late
Archaic and Woodland period occupations. However, most of the cultural remains at Area A appear to date
to the Formative Caddo period and the Middle Caddo Mound Prairie phase.
Work at Area B was primarily focused on determining the construction sequence of Mound B, the second
largest mound at the site. It appears that construction at the north end of the mound involved three separate
events. The earliest construction episode raised the mound to almost 90 cm in height. Importantly, two OCR
dates place this event after A.D. 939. A prepared yellowish-red clay cap appears to have been placed over
sections of the northern and southern parts of the mound following the construction of this first episode.
A second construction episode at the north end of Mound B added another 35 cm to its height. An OCR age of
approximately A.D. 1142 dates this construction to the early part of the Mound Prairie phase. There is good
evidence that the surface of the second construction episode was again covered with a thin yellowish-red
clay. A third construction episode is hypothesized to account for the remaining 35 cm thick deposit above
this surface. It is in the upper 60 cm of deposits that the only appreciable numbers of artifacts were found.
Diagnostics from this assemblage are primarily shell-tempered sherds of Late Caddo age and a few mid-19th
century historic artifacts. Even later, the mound was the location of a late 19th century cotton gin.
At Area C, the excavations showed that a slight 25 cm rise is a third Caddo mound (Mound C). Use of this
mound apparently began with the erection of a number of structures with non-residential functions since
almost no artifacts were found in the levels representing their surfaces. Numerous post holes were uncovered,
including 11 that form the southeastern part of a sub-rectangular structure. Two calibrated radiocarbon dates
from the living surfaces associated with the various post holes have age range from AD 1122-1242 and AD
1043-1188. These dates place the structures within the early part of the Mound Prairie phase.
Following the use of the structures at Mound C, the area was purposely capped with a 7 to 10 cm thick red
and orange clay. A 20 cm thick topsoil deposit that gradually accumulated above the clay cap was the living
surface for other Mound Prairie phase peoples who left broken sherds of Sanders Engraved and Sanders Plain
pottery and several arrow points of the Bonham type. Mixed in the with the Mound Prairie phase artifacts
are some shell-tempered sherds suggesting a subsequent Late Caddo occupation.

INTRODUCTION

The Fasken site (41RR14) is located in Red
River County, Texas, approximately 40 km northeast of Paris, Texas. The site is a Caddo mound
complex located on the first terrace above the Red
River floodplain, and 4 km upstream or south of the
river’s confluence with one of its major tributaries,
the Kiamichi River. The site is also about 1.95 km
south of a well-known Caddo mound complex,
the Wright Plantation site (41RR7). The Fasken
site was originally recorded in the 1930s by R. K.
Harris, who found Historic Indian period artifacts
there, including glass beads and brass ornaments
(Red River County File at the Texas Archeological
Research Laboratory, The University of Texas at
Austin). The site was known at that time as the Flying K Ranch site. Other than Harris’ limited work,
the site remained relatively unknown until the
1991 and 1992 Texas Archeological Field School
investigations.
The principal features on the landscape at the
Fasken site are two large man-made mounds, A
and B (Figure 1). Mound A, at the south end of
the site, measures 90 x 55 m in size and rises 4.3
m in height, making it one of the largest known
Caddo mounds in the western reaches of the
Caddo archeological area of Northeast Texas and
Southeast Oklahoma. Mound B, a linear mound
situated about 200 m north of Mound A, covers a
60 x 40 m area and is 1.6 m in height. Viewed in
profile on a north-south line, Mound B appears to
be saddle-shaped with a slightly depressed area
in its center (Figure 1). At least one other smaller
mound, Mound C, is also present. It is a slight 25
cm rise that lies about 200 m northwest of Mound
B (Figure 3). The last noticeable feature at the site
is a large 80 m diameter pond located immediately
northeast of Mound A. The pond appears to represent a borrow pit for fill for the construction of
Mound A and possibly also for Mound B.
The site is presently in pasture and the tall
grass in some areas may mask the presence of other
smaller mounds like Mound C. Such mounds may
also have been flattened when the site was under
cultivation from the late 19th through the early
20th century. Aside from previous disturbances
by cultivation, the site has also been damaged by
the construction of FM 410, which runs northsouth through the site near the terrace edge. Other
damage to the site includes the construction of,
and activities associated with, several rural farm

residences that formerly stood on the site, including
one that once stood atop Mound A. A former rodeo
arena was constructed north of the pond, southeast
of Mound B. Additionally, according to legend, a
horse-powered cotton gin was built on Mound B
sometime between the 1860s and 1880s. Another
legend states that during the Great Depression, the
former landowners dug up some pottery vessels
from the deposits at Mound B.

RESEARCH DESIGN
At the start of the Texas Archeological Society
(TAS) Field School investigations, it was assumed
that the mounds had been constructed during the
early part of the Caddo local occupational sequence
and that the Historic Indian artifacts found by Harris were debris left by later aboriginal peoples, perhaps by the Cherokee. The goals of the TAS Field
School work at the Fasken site were to: (1) learn
more precisely when the site was occupied, (2) gain
a better understanding of the types of artifacts and
features present, and (3) identify the limits of the
site deposits.
Bruseth (1998:51-62) and Perttula (ed., this
volume, “The Roitsch Site”) have proposed a chronology for Caddo development in the Middle Red
River valley as follows: Early Ceramic or Woodland period (200 B. C. to A. D. 900), Formative
Caddo period (A.D. 900 to A.D. 1100) or Albion
phase, Middle Caddo period (A.D. 1100 to A.D.
1300) or Mound Prairie phase (a local equivalent
to the Sanders phase to the west and southwest),
and McCurtain phase or Late Caddo period (A.D.
1300 to A.D. 1700). Based on our knowledge of
the dating of the largest Caddo mounds elsewhere,
it appeared probable that the earliest construction
episodes at Mound A and perhaps Mound B would
date to the Formative Caddo period. Additional
mound building activities could also be expected to
have continued into the Mound Prairie and McCurtain phases, as indicated by the East Mound at the
Roitsch site (see Perttula, ed., this volume). A primary goal of the work at Fasken was to determine
the placement of the site within this framework.
The recovery of materials, especially charcoal,
which could date the mound building activities was
considered extremely critical. Also of importance
in dating the mound building activities was the recovery of a representative sample of artifacts which
would complement any radiocarbon dates, while

the documentation of the types of features present
within the mounds and adjacent deposits would
provide comparative data to nearby sites such as
A. C. Mackin (Mallouf 1976) and Roitsch (Skinner et al. 1969; Martin and Bruseth 1992; see also
Perttula et al. 2001; Perttula, ed., this volume).
A basic aim of the work at the Fasken site
was also to define the horizontal limits of the site
deposits. Prior to the beginning of the TAS Field
School excavations, it was not known if cultural
materials were confined to the vicinities of the two
major mounds or whether such remains extended
continuously northward, for example, towards the
Wright Plantation site.

While the above-mentioned
research design issues constituted
the ideal for excavations at
the Fasken site, the field work
was planned with the realistic
expectations of how much could
be accomplished in two oneweek field school sessions.
For example, because of the
enormous size of Mound A and
the limited amount of time and
effort that could be expended by
the TAS Field School, no work
was undertaken on this mound.
Instead, excavation of mound
features focused on Mounds B
and C, which are called Areas
B and C, respectively. Limited
excavations were also conducted
at two other portions of the site,
labeled as Areas A and D (see
Figure 1). Additionally, a shovel
testing program consisting of 50
x 50 cm units was undertaken to
better define the boundaries of
the site.
Prior to the beginning of the
1991 field season an arbitrary
grid system was established at
the site based on a datum placed
southwest of the site in the Red
River floodplain. The datum was
labeled 0/0. All excavations were
undertaken in areas north and east
of this datum. Prior to both field
seasons, portions of the site were mowed to remove
tall grass and facilitate the placement of grid stakes
and excavation activities in general. For horizontal
measurements, the grid numbers of at the southwest corner of each 1 x 1 m were utilized.
All soil was removed from excavation units in
10 cm levels. In some cases, a transit was used to
measure the depths of excavations but generally
line levels strung from nails whose elevations had
been taken with a transit were used for measuring
depths.
Soil was excavated from the units with shovels
and trowels, with the latter being utilized for more
careful work in and around suspected features,

130

cleaning off the bottoms of levels, and for straightening excavation unit walls. When charcoal or
other charred materials were encountered in situ
during excavations, samples were placed in aluminum foil pouches. All soil from each level was
screened through 1/4-inch wire mesh.
Special attention was given to the excavation
of features. All features were carefully cleaned and
documented with plan view drawings, black and
white prints, and color slide photography. Additionally, suspected post holes and pit features were
cross-sectioned and documented with photos, plan
views, and vertical profile drawings.
Another aspect of the field methodology was
the use of a 1-inch diameter hand auger to penetrate
subsurface deposits on the northern half of Mound
B to determine the horizontal extent of a buried,
prepared clay floor defined as Feature 3. Following
the successful delineation of the boundary of Feature 3, the hand auger was utilized on the southern
lobe of this mound to locate and partially determine
the horizontal extent of a similar buried clay floor
(Feature 16).
In addition to the excavations, two remote
sensing surveys were conducted on parts of the site
to search for buried features. One of these utilized
a magnetometer while the other involved the use of
a ground penetrating radar (GPR) unit. The remote
sensing work was undertaken at Areas A and B
and further north on the east side of FM 410 (see
Figure 1). A total of approximately 10,750 m2 (2.7
acres) were covered by the GPR, and 17,390 m2
(4.3 acres) were subjected to magnetometer survey.
The two remote sensing devices covered many of
the same areas and in some cases both identified

anomalies at the same spots. Four of the anomalies
were ground-truthed in the excavations.

EXCAVATION RESULTS
Area A
Area A is the portion of the site on the terrace
edge west of Mounds A and B and FM 410. A total
of 22 1 x1 m units were excavated here (see Figure
1). These units primarily consisted of a central 2 x
2 m block with lines of other 1 x 1 m units radiating off the block in all four cardinal directions. In
total, this cross-shaped block, with its approximate
center at N330/E425, accounted for 20 of the 22 1 x
1 m units. The purpose of this block excavation was
to investigate the area where an initial 50 x 50 cm
shovel test in the southwest quadrant of the N329/
E425 unit had yielded evidence of a pit feature and
large quantities of ceramics, lithic debris, and daub.
The other two 1 x 1 m units were located further
north at N372/E419 and N387/E419. These two
units were excavated to investigate anomalies found
during the aforementioned remote sensing survey.
Stratigraphy
The soil stratigraphy in Area A consisted of a
20 to 50 cm thick sandy loam A-horizon deposit
above a red clay B-horizon (Figure 4). At the major
excavation block at Area A, the Zone I reddishbrown sandy loam sits directly atop the Zone III
red clay B-horizon, except at the east wing of the
T-shaped line of 1 x 1 m units where a 10 to 30 cm

thick lighter reddish-brown sandy loam (Zone II)
is distinguishable between Zones I and III. The
former stratigraphy is also present in two smaller
1 x 1 m and 50 x 50 cm units excavated along the
terrace edge north of Area A.
Features
Only three features, a storage/trash pit and two
post holes, were found during the excavations at
Area A. The storage/trash pit (Feature 2) is a circular, straight-walled depression with a diameter of
1.6 m. It is situated in the center of the excavation
block (Figure 5). The feature was easily detected
by its circular pattern of much darker colored sediments that were visible just beneath the 20 cm thick
plow zone. From that point the pit extended down
another 30 cm well into the red clay B-horizon.
The high density of chipped stone artifacts,
pottery sherds, and, in particular the large quantity of daub found during the initial excavations
undertaken to expose Feature 2, indicated intense

occupation and the probable presence of former
house structures in the vicinity of the pit feature.
In order to find post holes associated with the
house(s), four lines of 1 x 1 m units were excavated
on the cardinal axes from the 2 x 2 m unit opened
to expose Feature 2 (see Figure 1).
Although the expansion of excavations at Area
A continued to yield high quantities of artifacts,
only two post hole features (Features 18 and 31)
were uncovered. These are shallow dark-colored
circular patterns located at the north end of the
northern line of 1 x 1 m units. These could be a portion of a post hole pattern, possibly indicating that
a structure stood north of Feature 2, and that the
storage/trash pit was located outside of a structure
rather than within it.
Artifact Distributions
The investigations at Area A produced
the highest artifact counts and a more diverse

assemblage of material culture remains than in
other portions of the site. These materials strongly
suggest a residential occupation here, as opposed
to the special (i.e., religious or ritual) use noted
for some other parts of the site. The horizontal
distribution of ceramics, lithics, and daub indicate
that the densest accumulations occur within and
immediately adjacent to the Feature 2 trash/storage
pit (Figure 6a-c). It is probable that previous
plowing has scattered those materials, which would
have been originally located in the upper 20 cm of
deposits within the pit feature and adjacent areas.
A second noteworthy fact about the artifact distribution at Area A is the increase in density of the
three artifact categories at the very northeast edge
of the Area A block in the N335/E426 unit. Since
the only two post holes found in Area A occur in
units N335/E426 and N335/E425, it is possible that
the increase in artifacts is related to the presence of
a former structure in this vicinity. It is likely that
Feature 2 was associated with this hypothesized
structure since the distance between the pit and
the structure is comparable to that noted at other
prehistoric Caddo sites in northeastern Texas.
Area B
Area B centers on Mound B, and the work in
this area principally focused on the excavation of
two 1 m wide trenches on the east slope of Mound B
(see Figure 1). The most significant finds came from
Trench #2 excavated on the northern lobe of the
mound. This trench consisted of nine 1 x 1m units,
with the seven western units forming a contiguous
line from the crest of the mound down slope to the
east. The units were excavated to various depths,
with the three deepest 1 x 1 m units at the western
end of the contiguous trench excavated to 2 m below
surface (bs). These excavations penetrated through
the mound fill to 40 cm below the original surface
upon which the mound had been erected.
Trench #1, at the approximate center of Mound
B, consisted of eight 1 x 1 m units, including a
contiguous line of five units from the mound crest
down slope to the east. Excavation of Trench #1
units indicated that the uppermost 60 cm of mound
fill have been disturbed by the previous excavations
of pothunters and perhaps the activities associated
with the construction and operation of a late 19th
to early 20th century cotton gin.
Excavation of Trenches #1 and #2 during the
first field season was carried only through the upper

half of the mound deposits. Based on the discovery
of a prepared clay floor at a depth of 60 cm bs in
Trench #2 and the fact that the deposits in Trench
#2 appeared to be much less disturbed than those of
Trench #1, more intensive efforts during the second
season focused on the completion of the Trench #2
excavations in order to establish the mound building sequence. No additional work was undertaken
in Trench #1 during the second field season.
Additionally, a 1-inch diameter hand auger
was used prior to the start of the second season of
excavations to establish that Feature 3 extended
from approximately N511 to N517.5 and from
E499 to E505.5. Other soil augering on the south
lobe of Mound B south of Trench #1 showed that
a similar orange clay cap occurred at roughly the
same depth as Feature 3 for a distance of 15.8 m
on the E500 line between N478 and N493.80. The
augering results suggested two possibilities. First,
two parallel clay caps could have been laid simultaneously on the mound surface following the end
of the first episode of mound construction. Given
the fact that the present surface of Mound B is
saddle-shaped with north and south lobes present
in the same vicinity as the clay features, the clay
features may have represented prepared floors for
twin structures. If this is true, then it was thought
that excavations along the edges of the clay floors
might show the presence of the post holes of such
structures. To explore for such post holes, a 2 x 2
m unit (N517/E500) was excavated on the north
slope of Mound B during the second season. The
second possibility is that a single continuous clay
cap which had been disrupted by previous ground
disturbance had originally extended from approximately N478 to N517.5.
Other 1 x 1 units were excavated at Area B.
These consisted of the N530/E502 unit, which
investigated an anomaly found during one of the
remote sensing surveys at the far north edge of the
mound, and the N500/524 unit to investigate the
area just off the east edge of the mound.
Stratigraphy
The profile from the three westernmost units of
Trench #2 provides the best evidence of the mound
construction sequence. At least three construction
episodes are evident there (Figure 7). From the bottom to the top on the N513 line at the west end of
Trench #2, the profile was as follows: (1) original
pre-mound yellowish-red B-horizon subsoil (98.60

134

Texas Archeological Society

to 98.74 m); (2) the very dark grayish-brown,
organic-stained pre-mound A-horizon (98.74 to
99.02 m); (3) the multi-colored dark to very dark
grayish-brown sandy loam and yellowish-red clay
basket loads of soil which formed the first moundbuilding episode (99.02 to 99.88 m), 86 cm thick;
(4) the thin yellowish-red clay which capped the
first construction episode (99.88 to 99.92 m); (5)
the dark grayish-brown sandy loam that formed the
second construction episode (99.92 to 100.29 m),
37 cm thick; (6) the remnants of a second yellowish-red clay cap at 30 cm bs (100.29 to 100.31 cm);
and (7) the uppermost deposit of dark to very dark
grayish-brown sandy loam extending to the current
ground surface and that formed the third and last
construction episode (100.31 to 100.60 cm), 29 cm
thick. The north wall profile of Trench #2 provides
a broader view of the soil strata in the western half
of Trench #2 (Figure 8).
Three OCR dates were obtained from soil
samples retrieved from the Trench #2 profile (see
Frink and Perttula [2001] for a general discussion
of the methods and reasoning behind the OCR procedure as used on Caddo sites). The sample from
the original pre-mound A horizon (Zone 6) at 163
to 168 cm bs, produced a date of 1011 ± 30 B.P.
(A.D. 909-969), while a sample from Zone 5, the
basket loads of dirt used for the first mound building
episode, dated 1175 ± 35 B.P. (A.D. 740-810). The
sample from just above Feature 3, which should date
the fill of the second construction episode, yielded a
date of 808 ± 24 B.P. (A.D. 1118-1166). While these
OCR dates appear reasonable, given their context, it
is important to note that the validity of all three OCR
dates may be suspect because of the context of the

soils themselves. While the soils used for the premound and first mound building episode dates are
sealed by the Feature 3 clay cap as well as mound
fill, older carbonized remains are certainly present in
these two samples (particularly from Zone 5, which
is comprised of a mixture of sediments with different carbon contents). Furthermore, the soil used for

the dating of the second mound building episode
could potentially include younger carbon that has
migrated downward in the deposits, particularly by
rodent burrowing. The interpretation offered here is
that the Zone 6 pre-mound horizon was buried by
mound fill subsequent to A.D. 939, and the mound
fill sealed off the older carbon in this zone from
mound fill and younger carbon associated with occupation of the mound itself at some later date.
Trench #1, the other trench excavated on Mound
B, was 11 m south of Trench #2. It consisted of
10 1 x 1 m units excavated to explore the slightly
depressed central part of the mound. Several contiguous units forming the bulk of Trench #1 were
excavated to a maximum depth of 1 m. The profile
of these deepest units showed four sandy loam soil
zones of mound fill, with the upper 60 cm of the top
three zones being much disturbed. The disturbance
may be related to pothunter digging and/or the
construction and operation of the 19th century cotton gin. Although no evidence of the yellowish-red
clay that capped the first two construction episode
was observed, hand augering further south on the
southern lobe showed the earlier yellowish-red clay
cap to be present at the same approximate elevation as on the northern lobe. It is possible that in
the first episode of construction, this mound had a
true saddle shape with slightly elevated lobes at its
north and south ends. The lobes may have served as
platforms for twin structures, with the yellowish-red
clay being the floors of the structures.
To further explore the possibility that structures
had been erected at the north and south ends of the
original mound construction, a 2 x 2 m unit was
excavated 5-7 m north of Trench #2, to a depth of
60 cm bs, where the augering indicated the northern
edge of the yellowish-red clay cap. The purpose
was to determine if post hole stains from one of the
hypothesized structures would be evident. Although
no such post holes were discovered there, Feature
35 was found. It is a narrow, 10 to 30 cm wide, 15
cm deep depression that extended from the top of
the clay lens down 15 cm. It was oriented northsouth across the entire 2 x 2 m unit rather than the
expected east-west line which would have marked
the northern edge of a structure, and possibly it is
part of an extended entranceway trench.
Artifact Distributions
In comparison to Area A, the horizontal distribution of the three major prehistoric artifact

categories at Area B shows no clear concentrations
(Figures 9a-c). The volume of chipped stone and
ceramic artifacts is generally higher at the west
ends of the trenches near the crest of the mound.
The daub distribution does not show a consistent
pattern. The vast majority of these artifacts from
the two 1 m wide trenches on Mound B come
from the upper 60 cm of deposits and appear to be
of Late Caddo age. The somewhat larger overall
numbers of artifacts from Trench #2 in comparison
to Trench #1 is probably due to the fact that larger
volumes of fill were excavated at Trench #2.
Area C
The excavation of a 20 m2 unit at Area C over
the two seasons revealed that a man-made mound,
Mound C, is present here. The identification of
numerous post holes in the deeper excavation levels,
including 11 that form an alignment designated as
Structure 1, indicates that this area was initially
the locale of more than one structure, the floors of
which lay at depths between ca. 40-58 cm bs. Since
extremely few artifacts were recovered from the
levels which include these floor surfaces, it appears
that the structures had non-residential functions
probably associated with religious, ceremonial,
and/or civic activities. The area containing these
structures was then purposely capped with a 7 to 10
cm thick red and orange clay deposit. At some later
date, a residential occupation of Area C was initiated,
with relatively dense amounts of artifacts in the 20
cm thick deposits between the top of the clay cap
and the current ground surface. Although two post
holes originate from the upper 20 cm of deposits, it
is not certain whether they are of aboriginal origin
or are post holes for a historic period fence.

Stratigraphy
Figure 10 illustrates the strata uncovered at
Area C. The soil profile showed an 18 to 22 cm
thick surface deposit of sandy loam soil divided
into two zones, Zones 1 and 2, with the principal
distinction being the presence of a very dark gray
color (5YR3/1) and numerous roots in Zone 1.
Zone 2 has a reddish-brown color (5YR4/4). The
vast majority of the aboriginal artifacts recovered
at Area C come from Zones 1 and 2.
Deeper, Zone 3 is an approximately 7 to 10
cm thick layer of reddish-brown (5YR4/4) to dark

reddish-brown (5YR3/3) clay that was purposely
dumped over the deeper deposits by aboriginal
peoples to cap several structures represented by
post holes that extend from 52 to 102 cm bs. The
artifact yield from Zone 3 is very low and many
of those recovered may have moved down by
bioturbation into the top of the clay from Zone
1 and 2 fill. In the west wall profile of the 7.5
m long excavation block, the red clay extends
continuously from the N692 to N696 line. Between
N692 and N691, it becomes more scattered and
is absent south of the N690.87 point. On an eastwest line, the Zone 3 red clay extends across the
entire excavation block north of the N692 line. It is
generally 10 cm thick at the west end of the block
and averages 5 to 7 cm in thickness from the E452
line to the east edge of the block.
Zone 4 at Area C is a dark reddish-brown
(5YR3/2) highly organic sandy loam that lies beneath the red clay cap. Zone 4 ranges in thickness
from a minimum of 23 cm at the N696/E451 stake
to 43 cm at N693.80/E452. Although all but two
of the 34 post holes identified at Area C, including the alignment defined as Structure 1, originate
from surfaces within the Zone 4 fill, extremely few
artifacts were recovered. Generally, the Zone 4 fill
corresponds to levels 4 through 7 in the excavation
units. A radiocarbon date from charcoal recovered in
level 4 in the N692/E451 unit yielded a δ 13C corrected date of 870 ± 50 B.P., which has a calibrated
1-sigma age range of A.D. 1122-1242 (area under
the probability distribution [RA]=0.83). Deeper, a
second radiocarbon date from charcoal recovered
in level 7 produced a δ 13C corrected date of 910
± 60 B.P. which has a calibrated age range of A.D.
1043-1188 (RA=1.00). These dates are in correct
stratigraphic order and indicate a local Mound
Prairie phase or Middle Caddo period occupation
of this area for apparently non-domestic structures.
An OCR date of 682 ± 20 B.P. (A.D. 1248-1288)
was also obtained from Zone 4 fill. It came from
charcoal-stained soil in N690/E451 from a depth
of 42 cm bs. However, this sample came from an
area in which the Zone 3 clay cap is not present to
prevent contamination from younger carbon in the
Zone 1 and 2 fill. Thus, the date may not accurately
reflect the age of the cultural materials in Zone 4.
Zone 5 is a red (2.5YR4/6) clay that underlies
the dark Zone 4 fill. Along the E452 line, this red
clay is only 10 to 13 cm thick. Elsewhere, most
excavation units were terminated as soon as the top
of Zone 5 was encountered.

The profile of a narrow trench dug on the E452
line identified several deeper sediments. Zone 6 is a
sandy loam deposit with a reddish-brown (5YR5/4)
color. At the south end of the trench it is approximately 7 cm thick. Moving north, it progressively
thickens to a maximum of 12 cm. The northern
part of the trench has a red (5YR4/6) sandy loam
(Zone 7) beneath Zone 6. Zone 7 ranges from 3 to
5 cm in thickness. The deepest deposit, Zone 8, lies
beneath Zone 6 in the southern part of the trench
wall profile and is beneath Zone 7 in the northern
part of this profile. It is a reddish-brown (5YR4/4)
sandy clay. Excavations did not extend to the bottom of Zone 8, but at the south end of the trench
profile, it is at least 19 cm in thickness (100-119
cm bs).
Artifact Distributions
Artifact yields were high in the first three levels in Area C, but the deeper deposits (levels 4-7)
representing the floors of structures had extremely
few artifacts, suggesting that the structures may
have had a special (i.e., religious or political) rather
than residential function. The horizontal distribution pattern of prehistoric ceramics, chipped stone,
and daub (Figure 11a-c) does not show as strongly
distinguishable trends as that of Area A. The highest ceramic counts occur in the northeastern edge
of Area C. Likewise, the distribution of daub is
generally higher at the northeast edge of the block.
The lithic distribution pattern is not as clear. If the
artifact counts from units N690/E451 and N688/
E452 are disregarded, then the lithic density is also
higher at the northeast end of the block.
Area D
This area is located between Mounds A and
B where a slight topographic rise similar to that
at Mound C had been noted. A small excavation
(seven 1 x 1 m units) was undertaken at Area D
during the 1991 field season. These excavations
did not reveal any evidence of mound building but
did uncover a midden zone with some evidence of
cultural stratigraphy.
Stratigraphy
The profile of the south wall of the main Area
D excavation block at Area D has three soil zones
(Figure 12). Zone 1 is a reddish-brown (5YR4/3)

sandy loam topsoil which ranges from 8 to 23 cm in
thickness, but on average is about 20 cm in thickness.
It appears to correspond to a plow zone. Zone 2 is
a dark reddish-brown (5YR3/2) sandy loam with
patches of brown and black midden (5YR2.5/1)
staining. At the west end of the profile, where it is
at least 39 cm thick, it can be divided into three sub-

zones: 2A, 2B, and 2C. Elsewhere, it is generally
about 20 cm in thickness. Zone 3 is a dark reddishbrown (5YR3/3) sandy clay loam that is the deepest
zone exposed in the excavations. The top of this zone
was usually approximately 40 cm bs, but was not
penetrated at the far west end of the excavation block
where excavations ended at 50 cm bs.

Artifact Distributions
The ceramic and chipped stone categories at
Area D show opposing horizontal clustering (Figure 13a-b). The ceramics are more numerous at the
east end of the block while the chipped stone has a
somewhat higher density at the west end. The daub
count is much higher at the far east end of the block
(Figure 14c), which in combination with higher ceramic counts, suggests that an aboriginal structure
may have once been present in that vicinity.
Shovel Testing
A total of 22 50 x 50 cm test units and 2 1 x
1 m test units were excavated to help define the
site boundaries and determine artifact densities
across the site. These substantiate the findings of
dense cultural materials along the terrace edge in
the vicinity of Area A (Figure 14). The test units
also suggest that little occupational material exists
east of Mound B and in the areas east and west of
Mound C at the north end of the site.
The stratigraphic profiles from the various
shovel test units are provided in Appendix 1 of
this article. These generally show sandy loam
A-horizon deposits ranging from 56 to 72 cm in
thickness in the area between Areas B and C; 36 to
42 cm thick deposits east of Area B; at least 60 to
70 cm thick A-horizon sediments west of Area C;
and approximately 40 cm deposits north and south
of Area A.

that could be correlated. Four of these anomalies
were “ground-truthed” in the excavations. Three
of these excavation units were placed north of the
Area A block and consisted of the N372/E419 and
N387/E419 1 x 1 m units and the NE and SE quads
of the N404/E420 unit (see Figure 1). Rusted metal
recovered from the N387/E419 unit is the probable source of the anomaly that registered there.
The other two, however, yielded burned sandstone
(naturally iron-enriched) rocks which are among
the very few that were found in the two seasons of
excavations at the site.
A fourth anomaly was tested further north on
the east side of FM410 with the N644/E427 1 x 1
m unit. No artifacts or features were found in that
excavation unit and it appears that the anomalous
reading there was caused by the extremely shallow
A-horizon. An attempt was made to ground-truth a
fifth anomaly located at N530/E502, just north of
Area A. Time did not allow for the completion of
this 1 x 1 m unit, and those levels that were excavated produced no unusual materials or features.
Features
Of the 52 features recorded during the excavations all but eight are post holes (Appendix 2). The
other eight features consist of a post hole alignment
that forms portions of the east and south walls of a
structure (Structure 1), three pit features, three prepared clay floors, and a possible wall or extended
entranceway trench.

Remote Sensing
The two remote sensing surveys showed numerous anomalies and in many cases the magnetometer
and ground-penetrating radar identified anomalies

(Figure 15). Eight of the post holes are part of a
north-south trending line that extends for a length
of 3.5 m, and forms the southern part of the east
wall of the structure. Three other post holes form
the eastern part of the south wall. The arc at the
intersection of the two walls suggests that the
structure was sub-rectangular. Several of the post
holes were first noted at depths of approximately
25 cm below the red clay cap (52 cm bs). The
average diameter of the post holes is 15 cm, and
their maximum observed depth is 48 cm. No
diagnostic artifacts which would aid in dating this
structure were found, and, indeed, very little in the
way of material culture remains were found in the
levels that would approximate the living surface
associated with the structure.
Individual Post Holes
Aside from those post holes that define Structure 1, 33 other individual post holes were recorded.
These consist of 26 post holes at Area C (Figure 16),
two at Area A, and five at Area B. Twenty-four of
the 26 at Area C were beneath the clay cap. Generally, the tops of those post holes south of Structure

1 occur at slightly higher elevations than those
comprising Structure 1, but they are still beneath
the clay cap. Two post holes at the north end of the
Area C block differ from the others in that they are
more recent and extend through the clay cap. These
may represent a structure(s) associated with the
aboriginal Caddo cultural remains found in levels
1 and 2 of Area C or they may represent historic
period fence posts.
The five post holes recorded at Area B include
four in the N500/E504 unit in Trench #1. They were
observed in the floor of level 7 at 99.60 m. None of
the four is well-preserved, nor do they form any recognizable pattern. The fifth post hole at Area B was
recorded in the N518/E500 unit in the floor of level 6.
It had a diameter of 35 cm and was later determined
to probably represent a larger rodent burrow.
The two post holes found at Area A come from
a line of 1 x 1 m units excavated north from the 2
x 2 m block which exposed a large pit feature.
Pit Features
One of the three pit features recorded during
the excavations is a 1.6 m diameter storage/trash

pit (Feature 2) found in the initial excavations at
Area A (see Figure 5). This feature was first noted
just beneath the plow zone at a depth of 20 cm. It
was distinguished by very dark fill which extended
into the orange clay B-horizon to a maximum
depth of 45 cm bs. The recovery of a side-notched
Reed arrow point from the lower part of the pit fill
suggests a Middle Caddo period or Mound Prairie
phase date for the feature.
The second pit feature, Feature 50, was found
in the northeastern part of the Area C block (see
Figure 15). It is an approximately 1.3 m diameter
oval patch of mottled dark brown sandy clay and
red clay. The feature was first noted at a depth of
70 cm. It was not cross-sectioned or excavated.
The third pit feature, Feature 15, was recorded
in the N695/E459 unit. It is a small 10 cm diameter
pit that was observed as a pocket of dark fill that
extended from 30 to 40 cm bs. Several small sandstone rocks were found in its fill as were several

vertically-oriented sherds which were on edge.
It could not be determined if this was a cultural
feature or a rodent burrow. However, it should
be noted that sandstone rocks were rarely found
elsewhere at Area C.
Prepared Clay Floors
One well-preserved clay floor, Feature 3, and
the remnants of two other clay floors, Features 1
and 16, were found within the mound at Area B.
The best preserved clay floor, Feature 3, is represented by a 4 to 12 cm thick yellowish-red clay that
occurs about 55 to 60 cm bs in Trench #2 on the
north lobe of Mound B (see Figure 1). It extended
from the E499 line to approximately E505.5. In
the mound profile, this clay lens appears to cap the
first mound construction episode, which consists of
an approximately 88 cm thick mass of individual
basket loads of dirt.
Feature 3 was not evident 11 m to the south in

precise elevations as Feature 3. The clay lens on the
south lobe was found to extend from the N478 line
on the crest of the mound northward for a length
of almost 16 m. The width of Feature 16 was not
determined.
The third prepared clay floor, Feature 1, is a discontinuous 2 cm thick yellowish-red clay lens that is
visible in several units at the west end of Trench #2
at a depth of approximately 30 cm bs in Mound B.
This clay lens probably represents a clay cap placed
on the mound following the second construction
episode. The poor preservation of this clay lens, in
comparison to Features 3 and 16, is probably due to
damage from plowing and land clearing.

Feature 35 is a 10 to 30 cm wide depression
in the N517/E501 and N518/E501 units that may
represent the entryway to a structure associated with
Feature 3. The depression is an almost continuous
north-south trending line that begins at the surface
of Feature 3 at approximately 60 cm bs and extends
to 75 cm bs. No individual post hole stains were
visible in the depression. Interestingly, these excavation units are part of a 2 x 2 m unit excavated for the
purpose of locating post holes along the north edge
of Feature 3. It was expected that if post holes were
found, they would form an east-west alignment for
a portion of the north wall of a structure. The fact
that the depression has a north-south alignment suggests that it may be the entryway associated with the
hypothesized structure.

Aboriginal Artifacts

Area C showing the locations of all post holes with the

Trench #1, and hand augering conducted before the
beginning of the second field season showed that
the clay lens extended only 1 m south and west of
Trench #2. A total of 31 auger holes were excavated
on the north lobe, indicating that the Feature 3 clay
lens extended over an area measuring 6.5 x 6.5 m
in size.
Other auger holes excavated on the south lobe
of Mound B south of Trench #1 showed that a
similar yellowish red-clay lens (Feature 16) is present on that part of the mound at almost the same

Lithic Artifacts
A total of 1517 chipped stone artifact and one
ground stone tool were recovered during the excavations. The chipped stone assemblage consists
of 45 tools and 1472 pieces of debitage. The 17
complete and fragmentary arrow points constitute
the most common chipped stone tool. Arrow point
types include the Alba, Bonham, Perdiz, Scallorn,
Ray, and Reed types. The most common arrow
point types are Alba (n=4) and Bonham (n=4); all
other recognizable types are represented by one or
two specimens.
Three of the four Bonham arrow points come
from the upper deposits at Area C while three of
the four Alba points were found at the north end of

the Area A block excavations. It is also noteworthy
that Area A produced arrow points dating from the
Formative Caddo through Late Caddo periods, and
that, additionally, two dart points—a Gary and an
untyped Late Archaic or Woodland period specimen—also were found in the deposits. Other lithic
artifacts from Area A include a drill, three cores, two
ground stone fragments, and a Bristol Biface.

percent, siltstone/claystone is the
second most common raw material. It is the most common lithic
material in the samples from Area
B and the Test Pit Units. Local
chert is the third most common
(10.8 percent) and occurs in highest numbers at Area A. Ogallala
quartzite, Big Fork chert, other
chert, and quartzite occur in almost equal numbers at about 8
percent each. Minor amounts of
silicified wood, chalcedony, sandstone, novaculite, and jasper make
up the remainder.
The study of the lithic raw
materials indicates that local
the east wall of
materials were favored for the
production of stone tools as the
Red River gravel/chert, siltstone/
claystone, local chert, and Ogallala quartzite are all
available nearby and constitute almost 70 percent
of the sample.
These tables also show that a high percentage
of the chipped stone debitage retains cortex. Much
initial reduction must have occurred at Area A.
Elsewhere, the percentage of cortical and noncortical items is roughly equal.
Stone Tools

Chipped Stone Debitage
Two hundred and seventy-eight or 18.8 percent of the 1,472 pieces of chipped stone debitage
recovered from the site were analyzed for lithic
reduction elements and raw materials (Table 1).
The raw materials include Red River gravels
and chert (RR/G-C for Red River gravels and
chert), Big Fork chert (BFC), local chert (LC),
other chert (OC), chalcedony (CH), novaculite
(NO), Ogallala quartzite (OQ), a coarser-grained
quartzite (GQ), siltstone and claystone (S/C),
silicified wood (SW), sandstone (SS), and jasper
(J). Lithic debitage was also sorted into cortical
and non-cortical elements based on the presence
or absence of cortex.
The lithic debitage analysis samples for raw
materials are shown by area and unit number in
Tables 2-6. The Red River gravel/chert, which
constitutes 29.5 percent of the overall sample, is
the most common lithic material. It is the most
common material at Areas A, C, and D. At 20.9

The 46 stone tools found during the excavations consist of 45 chipped stone specimens and
one ground stone fragment. The single ground stone
artifact is made of a ferruginous sandstone-like
material. As shown on Table 7, the favored material
for the production of chipped stone tools is the Red
River gravel/chert, which constitutes 28.9 percent
of the chipped stone tools. Other more common
material types used for making chipped stone tools
are siltstone/claystone (17.8 percent), Big Fork
chert (13.3 percent), and Ogallala quartzite (11.1
percent). It is noteworthy that a larger percentage
of the chipped stone tools at Area A are siltstone/
claystone, while at Areas B and C, tools made of the
Red River gravels/chert account for approximately
one-half of the totals.
Chipped Stone Tools
The 45 chipped stone tools recovered during
the investigations include 10 dart points and frag-

ments, 17 arrow points and fragments, three arrow
or dart distal blade fragments, four other biface
fragments, three scrapers, two perforator fragments, and six modified flakes. Table 8 provides
tool measurements.
Arrow Points
Of the 17 arrow points, four are too fragmentary for typological identification. Those which can
be classified consist of four Alba, two Bonham, two
Bonham-like, two Scallorn, one Perdiz, one Reed,
and one Ray-like point (see Bruseth et al. 2001).

Alba (4 specimens, Figure 17a, d)
These generally conform with the definition
provided by Suhm and Jelks (1962:263) in having parallel to slightly expanding stems, generally
concave to recurved blades, and wide, outflaring,
and usually barbed shoulders. However, one of
the specimens has a wider blade and stem than is
standard. The blade edges of this aberrant specimen are also heavily serrated. Two of the other
specimens are somewhat unusual in that one has
an alternately beveled blade and the other has an
asymmetrical blade.

Figure 17. Projectile points from excavations.

Three of the Alba points were recovered from
level 3 of various 1 x 1 m units at the north end
of Area A, while the fourth is from level 2 of
unit N500/E508 immediately off the east edge of
Mound B at Area B.
Bonham and Bonham-like
(4 specimens, Figure 17b)
These two specimens have the narrow stems
and blades typical of the Bonham type as described
by Suhm and Jelks (1962:267). One of these has a
very short stem and a convex base, and was found
in level 2 at Area C, while the other, which came
from level 2 of the N500/E510 unit off the east

edge of Mound B at Area B, has a rectangular stem
and a flat base. Two other fragmentary specimens
are classified as Bonham-like due to their very
narrow long blades, typical of Bonham specimens
illustrated by Suhm and Jelks (1962:268 and Plate
134j-k). They come from levels 1 and 3 at Area
C where much of the Sanders Plain and Sanders
Engraved pottery was found.
Perdiz (1 specimen)
This specimen is classified as Perdiz because
of its contracting stem (Suhm and Jelks 1962:283).
The distal blade edges have been sharpened to form
a fine needle-like point. The lower parts of the

152

Texas Archeological Society

blade edges are straight. Shoulders are strong and
barbed. The point was found in level 1 at Area D.
Ray (1 specimen)
This small unifacial arrow point may fit into
the new provisional type defined by Bruseth et al.
(2001) as the Ray type. The blade edges are straight
and shoulders are moderate. The stem is broken,
but shows some evidence that it was expanding
and possibly had a convex base. This arrow point
was found in level 3 at Mound C at Area C.
Reed (1 specimen, Figure 17c)
This arrow point is a side-notched specimen
with one convex blade edge and one straight-sided
blade edge. The base appear to have been broken.
It was found in level 2 in Feature 2 in the central
part of Area A.
Scallorn (2 specimens)
These arrow points have expanding stems
formed by corner-notching of the arrow preform.
Both have straight blade edges and are well-shouldered. One of the specimens comes from level 2
at Area C. It has a concave base and is similar in
overall form to Brown’s (1996) Scallorn sattler and
Scallorn B varieties. The other specimen was found
from level 2 at Area D and has a convex base.
Unclassified arrow points (4 specimens)
These consist of two distal blade fragments
from level 2 of the N512/E506 unit on the east edge
of Mound B, a proximal blade fragment from level
3 of the N512/E501 unit at Mound B, and a partial
blade and stem from level 3 at Mound C.
Dart Points
Gary (6 specimens)
These dart points have the contracting stem
that is characteristic of the Gary type. The four
specimens retaining all or most of the blade have
straight and concave blade edges and strong to
weak shoulders. One of these four specimens has an
alternately beveled blade from sharpening activity.
These four specimens have stem lengths that are
similar but two have much narrower stem widths.

A fifth specimen has a much longer, wider, and
thicker stem. The last specimen is a fragmentary
piece that has a short stem and a portion of one
blade shoulder. The Gary points were found in all
parts of the site, including level 1 at Area A, level 2
on Mound B, level 2 off Mound B at Area B, level
3 at Area C, level 4 at Area D, and on the surface
of the site.
Untyped dart point
One complete specimen having a narrow,
straight-edged blade with weak shoulders was recovered in level 2 at Area A. Based on the shape of
its narrow, rectangular stem with a flat base, it does
not fit into any established type found in Northeast
Texas.
Dart Point Fragments
(3 specimens)
One of these specimens is an almost complete
dart point blade with the extreme upper edge of the
stem from level 3 at Area D. A second specimen is
a longitudinally split section of a dart blade and the
upper edge of the stem from level 2 at Area A. The
final specimen is from level 3 of the N405/E420 test
unit. It appears to be a dart point stem fragment that
has a convex base.
Biface Fragments
Three distal biface fragments recovered during
the excavations may represent the tips of arrow
points or dart points. Specimens from levels 3 and
7 at Area C are more likely arrow point fragments
while a slightly larger biface tip from level 3 at
Area A is probably a dart point tip. The specimen
from level 7 at Area C is noteworthy as it is the
only lithic artifact found beneath the clay cap at
Mound C at Area C.
Biface fragments that do not appear to represent fragments of projectile points include two
from Mound B at Area B from the first and second
levels, one from level 2 north of Mound B, and a
thicker specimen from level 2 at Area A.
Scrapers
Three scrapers were found during the
excavations. One (level 3 at Area C) is a made on a
curved flake with a thick dorsal surface. Retouch is

Prikryl—The 1991 and 1992 Field School Excavations at the Fasken Site 153
evident on all four edges of the rectangular surface.
Another specimen has retouch only on the distal
end of a flat flake. This specimen was found in
level 4 at Area A. The third specimen is flatter and
has retouch around a semi-circular worked edge.
It was found in level 2 at Area A.
Perforators
One of the tools is this category is a unifacial
distal end from level 2 at the north end of Area
A. The second specimen is a bifacial fragment
from level 3 of Area A. This fragment consists of
portions of the base and proximal end of the tool.
There is a possibility that it could, instead, represent a part of the stem and one of the shoulders of
a dart point.
Modified Flakes
While the percentage of novaculite in the debitage sample is low, three of the six modified flakes
from Fasken are made of this material. The three
consist of specimens from level 2 at Area C, level
4 off Mound B at Area B, and level 4 at Area A. A
second modified flake was also found in level 4 at
Area A. The other specimens came from level 3 at
Mound C and level 2 at Area A.

Ground Stone Tools
Only one ground stone tool was recovered from
the excavations. It is a celt fragment that was found
in level 1 at Area A. It is made of a ferruginous
sandstone-like material. The specimen measures
43.5 mm in length, 25.6 in width, and 4.9 mm in
thickness. Five other ground stone celt tools were
surface collected in the field to the northeast of Area
B prior to the start of the 1991 field season.
CERAMICS
Pottery
The most common prehistoric artifact recovered during the excavations at the Fasken site is
ceramic sherds. Of the total of 4,228 sherds, 172
either exhibited decoration and/or retained a portion of the rim. In addition to incised, engraved,
punctated, brushed, and appliqué decorations, the
decorated group includes those sherds with a red
slip, which is characteristic of the Mound Prairie
and Sanders phase Sanders Plain and Sanders
Engraved grog-tempered types (see Krieger
1946:185-192; Perttula, ed., this volume), as
well as Late Caddo period shell-tempered types
such as Avery Engraved. As shown on Table 9,
Area A has the largest number of decorated/rim

**E = engraved, I = incised, NB = neck-banded, P = punctated, A = appliquéd, B = brushed, RSP-R = red

sherds followed by Area C. A relatively high
number of decorated/rim sherds are from the
small test pits dug in the southwest quadrant of
the site, the same part of the site where the Area
A block excavation was situated.
The most common decoration is engraving, which
accounts for 57 percent of the decorated rim and body
sherds, including the red-slipped sherds. Although
it is not indicated on Table 10, 31 percent (n=20) of
the engraved sherds can be conclusively identified as
red-slipped examples, including many of the Sanders Engraved type (Table 11). In particular, pendant
designs commonly seen on Sanders Engraved vessels
(Figure 18d-e) are abundant in the upper levels of
Mound C, where 12 sherds of this type were identified.
However, a majority of these Sanders Engraved sherds
at Mound C may come from a single broken vessel.
Other identifiable engraved types include at least one
example each of the Avery Engraved (Figure 18c) and
Clark Engraved types.
After the engraved category, plain red-slipped
body and rim sherds together constitute another 25
percent of the decorated/rim category (see Table 11).
Many of these (75 percent) appear to be examples of

either Sanders Plain (see Figure 18b) or come from
non-decorated portions of Sanders Engraved vessels
since they have grog or grit-tempered pastes; these
date to Mound Prairie phase times. The remaining
25 percent of the plain red-slipped body and rim
sherds have shell, shell/shale, or no temper, and are
likely from Late Caddo vessels.
Almost equal numbers of incised, punctated,
and appliquéd sherds (see Figure 18a) make up the
remainder of the decorated sherds (see Table 11),
with the exceptions of one untyped brushed sherd
and one example of the Nash Neck Banded type.
Among the incised sherds are several examples of
Canton Incised.
Table 12 demonstrates that the most common
temper among the decorated/rim sherds is grog,
amounting to 28 percent of the assemblage. This
sherd temper category predominates in Area A (40
percent) and Area D (41 percent), but is not very
common at Area B. The combination of grog and
grit amounts to 22 percent of the assemblage of
all decorated sherds. This temper category predominates at Area C (47 percent), but is not very
common at Areas B or D. Overall, grog, grit, and

various combinations of grog, grit, and/or bone
temper predominate, and these various categories
account for 78 percent of the temper types in the
sherd sample. Generally, these categories and
combinations are indicative of Caddo occupations
during the Early and Middle Caddo periods. Shell
tempering, which is the common temper material
in the Late Caddo period, is predominant only at
Area B. Significantly, most of the shell-tempered
sherds at Mound B occur in the uppermost levels,
suggesting a Late Caddo occupation that post-dates
the mound construction sequence.
Concerning the vertical distribution of the pottery at Fasken, it is noteworthy that very few sherds
were recovered from the lower levels of Mound
B and beneath the clay cap at Mound C. This
indicates that Mound B served a non-residential
function until late in time. Similarly, the structures,
as indicated by the post hole patterns beneath the
clay cap, at Mound C must also have served some
special non-residential function.
Decorated Sherd Descriptions

Canton Incised are present as well as an example
of heavily grit-tempered LeFlore Plain (see Brown
1996). Other unique specimens include a zoned
punctated sherd, four other punctated sherds of
unidentified type, the only brushed sherd recovered at
the site, and six appliqué sherds, including at least two
grog-tempered examples of the kind of utility pottery
associated with the Mound Prairie phase era at other
sites in the middle Red River area. Twenty of the 42
decorated sherds are engraved following the pattern
elsewhere at the site, and two can be identified as the
red-slipped Sanders Engraved type.
Area B
Twelve of the 20 decorated sherds from Area B
are engraved (see Table 11). These include three that
are red-slipped Sanders Engraved, and one possible
shell-tempered Clark Engraved sherd dating to the
McCurtain phase (see Perino 1994). Other sherds
consist of one Nash Neck-Banded, four sherds of
red-slipped shell-tempered Clement or Roden ware;
the remainder are unidentified to type.

Sanders Engraved (see Table 11). In particular, the
pendant triangle designs commonly seen on Sanders Engraved vessels are common. These Sanders
Engraved sherds are red-slipped and are tempered
with grog, grog and grit, or a combination of grog,
grit, and bone. Seventeen other sherds, accounting
for another 46 percent of the decorated pottery
from Area C, are plain red-slipped body and rim
sherds. Most of these (n=14) appear to be from
Sanders Plain vessels or the non-decorated parts of
Sanders Engraved vessels. Three of these 17 sherds
are shell or shell/shale-tempered and are probably
of Late Caddo period age. The only other decorated sherds from Area C consist of four untyped
engraved sherds, three untyped incised sherds, and
one untyped punctated sherd.
.
Area D
The majority of the decorated/rim sherds
from Area D are also engraved (75 percent) (see
Table 11). Only two of these are of the red-slipped
Sanders Engraved type. One other engraved sherd
(shell-tempered) is Avery Engraved. The remaining
sherds are an untyped punctated and a red-slipped
rim fragment, plus two red-slipped Sanders Plain
sherds.
Test Units
A total of 15 decorated sherds were recovered
in the test units, most of them from the Southwest
(n=8) and Southeast (n=5) areas (see Table 11). The
only identifiable sherd is a Sanders Engraved from
the Northeast area, while the others are unidentifiable to type: untyped engraved (n=7), untyped incised (n=4), untyped appliqued (n=1), and untyped
punctated (n=2).
Plain Sherds
The temper in a sample of plain sherds was examined for comparisons to the decorated/rim sherd
categories (Table 13). The sample includes all plain
sherds from unit N335/426 at Area A, the N512/
E500 unit at Area B, and unit N399/E523 at Area
D. The sherds from Areas B and C were subdivided
by mound construction episode. At Area B there are
three divisions: lower for the first construction episode, middle for the second construction episode,
and upper for the third construction episode. The
Area C sample differs in that it consisted of the

plain sherds found beneath the Mound C clay cap
feature plus all of those above the clay cap from
two units (N695/E451 and N695/E451). In the case
of Area C, the purpose of examining all the plain
sherds was to help gain more chronological data
on the features found beneath the cap.
Several interesting facts emerged from this
analysis. First, several additional temper and
temper combinations were noted that are not represented in the decorated/rim sherds. In the unit
examined at Area A, shell was found to have been
combined with grog, and in some cases with both
grog and grit, to comprise 17 percent of the Area
A sample unit. This unit also had a much higher
percentage of shell and shell/shale-tempered sherds
(58 percent) than the sum percentage of shell and
shell/shale decorated/rim sherds (13 percent) from
this area of the site. Individual examples of grog
and shell used in combination were also found in
the upper deposits of the samples from Areas C and
D. Lastly, the only example of a bone temperedsherd from any of the decorated/rim and plain
sherds examined was noted from the Area D plain
sherd sample.
The examination of the nine sherds found
directly beneath the clay cap at Area C indicated
that six of the nine sherds were found to be shell or
shell/shale-tempered. The radiocarbon dates from
beneath the clay cap are Early to Middle Caddo
period in age, which would indicate that grog, grit,
and grog/grit-tempered sherds should predominate.
However, the sample is small and it is possible
that the shell and shell/shale-tempered sherds are
intrusive due to rodent burrowing or the excavation
of post holes through the clay cap later in time.
The examination of the plain sherds from the
N512/E500 unit further confirmed the evidence
provided by the decorated/rim sherd collection
from Area B that the deposits of the third (or final)
construction fill on Mound B contain predominantly Late Caddo period shell and shell/shaletempered pottery. The few plain sherds from the
second (or middle) construction episode from this
unit consist of three shell-tempered sherds and one
sherd each of grog-tempered and grog/grit-tempered pottery; the two plain sherds from the first
construction episode in the deepest levels consist
of one shell-tempered sherd from level 11 and one
shell/shale-tempered sherd from level 17. The two
from the deepest levels are probably intrusive. The
only other plain sherds which occur beneath the
clay cap are from unit N512/E501, and consist of

high oxygen environment. The oxidation patterns
of the plain sherd sample by temper type are
provided in Table 18.

Decorated Sherds

Pipes

Cross-sections of all decorated and redslipped pottery sherds were examined to determine
firing conditions (see Teltser 1993:Figure 2). The
majority of the pottery at all parts of the site,
particularly at Area C, was low-fired in a reduced
atmosphere (Table 14). At Area A, however, the
majority of the pottery was then cooled in high
oxygen environment. Table 15 shows the results by
temper type and Table 16 by decoration pattern.
The engraved, red-slipped plain rim, and redslipped non-rim categories are sherds from vessels that were predominantly fired in a reduced
atmosphere. Non-Sanders engraved, incised, and
punctated sherds tend to be from vessels that were
reduced and cooled in a high-oxygen environment.

Five Caddo ceramic pipe fragments were identified in the ceramic assemblage. The largest of these
was a long-stemmed Red River pipe that came from
level 9 in unit N500/E502 (Trench #1) at Area B.
The others, which consist of specimens from unit
N512/E500, level 7 at Area B, the N330/E422 unit,
level 2, the N330/E427 unit, level 2, and the N331/
E425 unit, level 3 at Area A, are too fragmentary for
classification.

Plain Sherds
The oxidation patterns of the 176 plain sherds
were also examined by area, and in the cases of
Areas B and C were subdivided by construction
episode zones (Table 17). At all areas of the
Fasken site, plain sherds were predominantly

DAUB
A total of 1,019 pieces of daub were identified
from the Fasken site excavations. Approximately
49 percent of the daub is from Area A (Table 19).
Much of this daub appears to have been dumped
into Feature 2, a trash/storage pit feature (see Figure
6c). A large amount of daub was also found at the
extreme northeast end of the Area A block, which in
combination with several post holes, suggested that
a structure had formerly stood in that area.

Artifacts associated with the early-mid-19th
century settlement at Fasken were found primarily
between 0-20 cm on the crest and eastern slopes of
Mound B. Among these artifacts are an assortment
(n=34) of decorated whiteware or refined earthenware
ceramics (Figure 19, top), namely three blue shelledged sherds with scalloped (ca. 1810-1835) and
non-scalloped (ca. 1835-1860) rims and impressed
lines (see Hunter and Miller 1994); black, blue, and
red transfer-printed flatware (n=14) sherds; bold and
fine-line hand-painted cup sherds (n=16), and one
sherd of annular ware. The latter decorated whiteware dates generally from 1830-1860 (Majewski
and O’Brien 1987), but the scalloped shell-edged
ware, and a single plain sherd of pearlware, hint at a
pre-1835 use of the Fasken site.
Utilitarian ceramics were also found in the
early-mid-19th century component. This includes
a sherd of salt-glazed stoneware (n=1, see Figure
19, top) and an undecorated piece of yellow ware
(n=1), probably from a serving bowl. The plain
whiteware (n=38) and porcelain (n=2) is probably
associated with the 19th century component.
Other 19th century artifacts that can be primarily associated with the early settlement at the
Fasken site include metal items, bottle glass,
clothing items, and metal tools. Cut nails (n=94),
and many of the nail shanks (n=42) that are probably from cut nails, are abundant, indicating that
a wood frame structure stood on Mound B. The
use of fire arms is indicated by a single musket
lead ball and a blade gunflint. The gunflint is a
honey-colored chert with a faceted cross-section,
no arris lip, a broken working edge, and step flaking/crushing on the heel (see Figure 19, bottom).
The olive and dark olive green bottle glass (n=8)
is from wine and champagne bottles, and the aqua
glass (n=10) is from hand-blown medicine bottles.
The brass three-piece U.S. military button has a
Symmetrical Spread Eagle design that is dated
to ca. 1847-1880 (Wyckoff 1984:88). Other 19th
century buttons include a brass loop button with a
shield design and a 2-hole bone button (see Figure
19, bottom).
The two wound glass beads from Mound B
are similar to those found on ca. 1830-1870 North
American sites (see DeVore 1992:Figures 8c and

FAUNAL AND FLORAL REMAINS
Faunal remains are very poorly preserved in the
acidic soils at the Fasken site. An initial examination of the tiny pieces of bone recovered at the site
by Yates (1992, see also Perttula, ed., this volume)
led to the determination that a formal analysis
would not be warranted at the present time.
Examination of the floated samples of fill from
the various parts of the Fasken site also showed
extremely little potential for the identification of
archeobotanical remains and only a single sample
with any appreciable volume of material was submitted for archeobotanical analyses: Feature 2, a
trash/storage pit at Area A of the site. Examination
of the sample showed minute remains of carbonized
hickory, other unidentified wood, acorn, maize cupules, amaranth seeds, portulaca seeds, and euphorbs
(Fritz 1992, see also Perttula, ed., this volume).

HISTORIC ARTIFACTS FROM
THE FASKEN SITE
Timothy K. Perttula and Nancy G. Reese
A small historic archeological component
(or components) has also been identified at the
Fasken site. Much of the historic archeological
material recovered at the site includes late 19th to
mid-20th century wire nails and bottle glass from
structures that stood on the mounds or around the
mounds, but there is evidence that the Fasken site
was also settled during the mid-19th century, probably by Anglo-American settlers. No evidence of
an historic Indian occupation was identified in the

nails, unidentified metal and iron fragments, and
an assortment of other farm-related artifacts. The
machine-made 20th century bottle glass includes
clear or colorless (n=103), brown (n=32), and
amber (n=1) sherds, along with one clear drinking glass sherd, four sherds of milk glass, and two
sherds of clear fruit jar or Mason jar glass. Architectural items include 17 wire nails, thick (>2.00
mm) window glass, and roofing tin (n=1).
Fence staples are abundant (n=20), along with
barbed wire pieces (n=6), and large metal spikes
(n=3). Other household items include two tin can
fragments, slate (n=2) and mirror glass, along with
a .22 shell casing and 10-12 gauge wire (n=3). The
remaining artifacts that can be associated with the
post-1890 use of the Fasken site are plastic (n=1),
a rubber gasket, one metal wedge and washer, and
29 unidentifiable metal and iron strips and fragments.

The later historic component at the Fasken
site is dominated by bottle glass fragments, wire

Based on the results of two Texas Archeological Society (TAS) Field School excavation seasons
at the Fasken site in 1991 and 1992, it appears
that the site was principally utilized between ca.
A.D. 900-1300, during the Formative Caddo and
Middle Caddo (Mound Prairie phase) periods.
This assessment is based on the preponderance of
ceramic sherds with grog and grit tempering (or
these two temper agents in combination) and the
predominance of arrow point types such as Alba,
Bonham, Scallorn, and other mostly rectangular
stemmed untyped fragments.
The most intensive residential occupation appears to have occurred along the terrace edge in
the vicinity of the Area A excavations. These units
yielded the largest numbers of lithic and ceramic
artifacts. Other artifact categories such as daub and
fire-cracked rock are also more abundant there. In
particular, the lithic artifacts are more diverse and
include some evidence of a Late Archaic and/or
Woodland period occupation. Smaller test units
excavated across the site further confirm the hypothesis of intensive residential occupation in the
southwest quadrant of the site around Area A. The
test units also suggest that the site covers an area
measuring approximately 150 m east-west by at
least 480 m north-south (approximately 18 acres),
with the areas south of Area A and north of Area C
remaining unexplored by the TAS.

Prikryl—The 1991 and 1992 Field School Excavations at the Fasken Site 165
Excavations on the north end of Mound B at
Area B showed that the initial mound construction
episode was a raised surface that was 88 cm in
height at its crest. A thin yellowish-red prepared
clay floor was then placed on the top of the north
and south ends of the mound. Two OCR dates
place this initial construction episode at Mound
B sometime after A.D. 939, when the A-horizon
was buried by the initial mound deposits. A second
construction episode is evident on the north lobe
of the mound in the Trench #2 profile. It raised the
mound another 35 cm and was again covered with
a yellowish-red prepared clay floor. An OCR date
of A. D. 1142 from the lower part of the fill of the
second construction episode suggests that this addition to the mound occurred during the Middle
Caddo period or local Mound Prairie phase. A
30 cm thick deposit above this second clay floor
probably represent a third construction episode.
Cultural remains suggestive of prehistoric occupation activities are confined to these uppermost
deposits and diagnostic materials are primarily
shell-tempered ceramics of the Late Caddo era.
Even later in time, it appears that mid-19th century
settlers utilized the mound area and during the late
19th century it was the site of a cotton gin.
The TAS Field School excavations also demonstrated that a slight 25 cm high rise at the north
end of the site, known as Mound C, is an aboriginal
mound. Use of this feature area apparently began
with the erection of a number of structures which
had non-residential functions since very few ceramic
and lithic artifacts occur at the levels representing the floors of these structures. Numerous post
holes—including 11 that form the southeast part of
a structure—were identified in the deepest excavated
levels. Two calibrated radiocarbon dates with age
ranges of AD 1122-1242 and AD 1043-1188 indicate
that these structures were apparently utilized during
the early part of the Mound Prairie phase.
Following the use of these structures, this
area was intentionally capped with a 7 to 10 cm
clay cover. Subsequently, the 20 cm thick topsoil
deposit that accumulated over this clay cap was the
living surface for Mound Prairie phase occupants
who left broken Sanders Engraved and Sanders
Plain ceramic sherds and several Bonham arrow
point fragments. Some Late Caddo materials related to the McCurtain phase are also present in
this deposit. Two post holes that originate from
this upper deposit may be related to this occupation or may be the result of recent historic period

fence building activities. As a result of aboriginal
activities, Mound C became a slightly elevated rise
about 25 cm in height.

LIST OF FEATURES
Feature #

Description

1

This feature was distinguished by scattered bits of yellowish-red clay lumps at depths ranging
from 20 to 32 cm below ground surface (bs) in the N512/E500 and E501 units at Area B. These
clay lumps probably represent a prepared clay floor that marked the top of the second construction
episode on the north lobe of Mound B. In units further east and down slope, it is hypothesized
that the clay floor has been more thoroughly disrupted by plowing so that the clay lumps are
smaller and less evident.

2

Trash/storage pit at Area A in the N328/E425 and N329/E425 units. The pit is evident in levels
3 through 5 as darker fill in a 1.6 m diameter area. Pit fill in levels 1 and 2 has been disrupted by
plowing. The feature fill contained a large volume of ceramics, lithic debitage, and daub.

3

A yellowish-red prepared clay floor that ranges from 12 cm thickness at the west end of north
wall profile of Trench #2 at the N512/E501 line at Mound B to only 4 cm thickness at the N513/
E501 line. Augering showed that the clay floor covers at 6.5 x 6.5 m area that extends from approximately the N511 line to about the N517.5 line and from the E499 line to the E505.5 line.
The yellowish-red clay appears to cap the first construction episode on the north lobe of Mound
B.

4

This post hole is in the west wall of the N695/E451 unit and extends from the Zone 1 topsoil
down through the Zone 3 artificial clay cap into Zone 4B. The maximum recorded length of this
post hole is 45 cm and its diameter is 15 cm. It may be associated with the aboriginal cultural
remains in Zones 1and 2 or it could be a recent historic post hole dug for a fence.

5

This post hole is located in the N695/E451 unit and was recognizable from 45 to 65 cm bs. It
had a diameter of 23 cm.

6

This post hole is located in the N695/E451 unit and was recognizable from 57 to 85 cm bs. It
had a top diameter of 15 cm.

7-10

These post holes were plotted on the floor plan at the completion of level 7 in unit N500/E504.
All appeared to be pockets of darker soil. The definition of these four post holes is suspect.

11

This post hole was found in the N695/E451 unit and was recognizable from 58-74 cm bs. It had
a diameter of 19 cm at its top.

12

This post hole was found in the N694/E451 and N694/E452 units and was recognizable from 40
to 100 cm bs. It had a diameter of 23 cm at its top.

13

This post hole was found in the N694/E451 and N694/E452 units and extended from 57 to 101
cm bs. It had a diameter of 12 cm.

14

The approximate center of this post hole was the N695/E452 stake. It extends into all four surrounding 1 x 1m units. It was recognizable from 53 to 101 cm bs and had a diameter of 16 cm.

15

This small 10 cm diameter pit was found from 30 to 40 cm bs in the N695/ E459 unit. It contained
a few small rocks and several pottery sherds which lay on edge vertically. It was not determined
if this was a cultural feature or a rodent burrow.

16

This prepared yellowish-red clay floor was discovered by augering the south lobe of Mound B. It
lay at the same approximate elevation as Feature 3 and it extended on a north-south line from N478
to N493.80. Augering was not undertaken to determine the east-west dimension of the feature.

17

This possible post hole was found in the N518/E500 unit in the floor of level 6. It was later
determined to most likely be a rodent burrow. It had a diameter of 35 cm.

18

This post hole was found in the N335/E426 unit at Area A. It extended from 30 to 35 cm bs.

19

This post hole was found in the N688/E452 unit and extended from 55 to 65 cm bs. It had a
diameter of 17 cm.

20

This post hole was found in the N690/E451 unit at 37 to 60 cm bs. It had a diameter of 8 cm.

21

This post hole was found in the N693/E451 unit. It extended from 57 to 66 cm bs, and had a
diameter of 25 cm.

22

This post hole was found in the N692/E451 unit from 70 to 92 cm bs. It had a diameter of 20 cm.

23

This post hole was found in the N692/E451 unit at 70 to 83 cm bs. It had a diameter of 12 cm.

24

This post hole was located in the N692/E452 unit. It extended from 62 to 109 cm bs and had a
diameter of 19 cm.

26

This post hole was found in the N692/E451 unit from 70 to 82 cm bs. It had a diameter of 17 cm.

27

This possible post hole was located in the N691/E451 unit. It was found at about 60 cm bs and extended only to 65 cm bs. Its small 5 cm diameter suggests that it was probably a rodent burrow.

28

This possible post hole was located in the N691/E451 unit in the floor of level 7. It had a diameter
of 13 cm but a depth of only 1 cm in profile, which suggested that it was a rodent burrow.

29

This feature is another probable rodent burrow in N691/E451 and is similar to Features 27 and 28.

30

This post hole is located in the N691/E451 unit and extended from 59 to 70 cm bs. It had a
diameter of 14 cm.

31

This possible post hole was visible in the north wall profile of the N335/E426 unit at Area A. It
had a diameter of about 12 cm and a depth of 5 cm.

32

This post hole was found in the N691/E451 unit in floor of level 7. Cross-sectioning showed that
it extended down only to 72 cm bs. It had a diameter of only 7 cm. It is possible that this may
represent the very bottom of a post hole whose upper portion may have been equivalent to that
of Feature 33.

33

This post hole was found in the N691/E451 unit. It was first recognized at 36 cm bs and extended
down to 72 cm bs. In the floor of level 7 at 70 cm bs, it had a diameter of only 6 cm.

34

This post hole was found in the N690/E452 and N691/E452 units. It was found from 70 to 95
cm bs, and had a diameter of 7 cm.

35

This feature is a narrow depression that ranges from 10 to 30 cm in width that extends on a northsouth line across the N517/E501 and N518/E501 units. It was first noted in the floor plan at the
completion of level 6. Cross-sectioning showed that it extended downward another 15 cm. The
depression may be a trench for posts set as an extended entryway into the hypothesized structure
that stood on the Feature 3 prepared clay floor on the north lobe of Mound B.

36

This post hole was recognized in the floor of level 7 in the N690/E451 unit. Cross-sectioning showed
that it extended down another 7 cm to 77 cm bs. Its recorded diameter at 70 cm bs was 12 cm.

This post hole was located in the N689/E452 unit in the floor of level 7. It extended down to 89
cm bs and had a diameter of 14 cm.

50

This feature is a large circular pocket of mottled dark brown sandy clay with red clay mottles
that covered most of the floor of N694/E453 at the end of the excavations. It also extended into
the adjacent N695/E453, N693/E452, and N694/E452 units and should have its south edge in
the unexcavated N693/E453 unit. The feature has a diameter of roughly 130 cm and shows in
the uneven bottoms of the excavations at 60 and 70 cm bs. Post holes defined as Features 42, 45,
and 51 lie within and penetrate into Feature 50.

51

This post hole is located in the N693/E452 unit. It was noted during the recording of Feature 50
in the floor of level 7. It was not cross-sectioned to determine how far downward it continued.

52

This post hole was noted during the final profiling of the north wall of the N695/E451 and the
N695/E452 units. It appeared to extend from about 60 cm bs to the bottom of the profile at 72
cm bs. The diameter of the post hole cross-section exposed in the wall was about 14 cm.

Archeological Survey of the Roitsch Farm and Adjoining Lands,
1991 and 1992 Texas Archeological Society Field School, Red
River County, Texas

Timothy K. Perttula
with contributions by Gayle Fritz, Bo Nelson, LeeAnna Schniebs, and Mike Turner

ABSTRACT
During the 1991 and 1992 Texas Archeological Society Field Schools, about 2500 acres of land in Red River
County, Texas, were surveyed, and a total of 109 new or previously recorded archeological sites were visited during the course of the survey work. Most of the sites were prehistoric in age, documenting two peak
periods in settlement: from the Late Archaic through the Woodland period (ca. 2000 B.C. to A.D. 900) and
then during the Late Caddo McCurtain phase (ca. A.D. 1300-1700). Historic sites found during the survey
were occupied principally between 1860-1950, and were the remnants of farmsteads and tenant farms in
several abandoned communities.

INTRODUCTION
This article describes the results of the archeological survey of the A.E. Roitsch Farm, and
adjoining lands, completed during the 1991 and
1992 Texas Archeological Society (TAS) Field
School in Red River County, Texas (Figure 1).
These survey areas are in immediate proximity
to the A. E. Roitsch (41RR16; previously known
as the Sam Kaufman site) and Salt Well Slough
(41RR204) sites (see Perttula, ed., this volume, and
Kenmotsu 2006), and within 15-30 km of the other
archeological sites (the Jonesborough, Fasken, and
Ray sites; see Reese 2001; Prikryl, this volume;
Bruseth et al. 2001) that were excavated during
the TAS Field School. A brief recent discussion
of the findings of the archeological survey is also
presented in Perttula et al. (2001).
This article is organized in two parts: Part I,
which discusses the methods employed during the
survey, and summarizes the archeological findings
of the survey with respect to the research problems
and issues laid out in the project research design
(Bruseth et al. 1991:17-26, 53, 1992:19-28, 61);
and Part II, which presents detailed descriptions of
the 88 sites recorded during the TAS Field School

survey. Incorporated also in Part II are descriptions
of 21 other prehistoric and historic sites recorded
on the Tarrant and Wright Farms property during a
1993-1994 supplementary survey by the Northeast
Texas Archeological Society in cooperation with
the Texas Historical Commission.

SURVEY METHODS
Between four and five survey crews were used
during the two seasons in Red River County. The
survey crews each consisted of a Crew Chief and
four crew members. One of the Crew Chiefs also
served as an Assistant Survey Supervisor (Chris
Kneupper in 1991 and Jay Hornsby in 1992) to oversee the activities of the crews, and assist the Survey
Supervisor (Perttula) in completing the work.
About 3500 acres were available for survey on
the Roitsch Farm; about 1500 acres were actually
surveyed during the 1991 and 1992 TAS Field
schools. The survey areas were principally spread
along Salt Well Slough, Pond Creek, and upper and
lower sections of the Big Pine Creek drainage. The
survey areas were a mixture of pastures, plowed
fields, and second growth woodlands. The different

ground surface visibility conditions determined
the types of survey procedures we used to locate
archeological sites.
Additional acreage was surveyed on property
owned by Mr. Andy Fasken north and northwest
of the Fasken site (41RR14). This area was on an
alluvial terrace of the Red River, and had been
recently plowed. During the 1992 Field School,
about 50 acres of recently plowed lands at the Dan
Holdeman site (41RR11), an important Early to
Late Caddo period village (Perino 1995; Perttula
1995) located a few miles downstream from the
Roitsch lands, also received archeological survey
investigations. Finally, about 500 acres of the Tarrant and Wright Farms, across from the confluence
of the Kiamichi and Red rivers, was surveyed in
1993 by the Northeast Texas Archeological Society
in cooperation with the Texas Historical Commission. This property was like the Roitsch Farm
survey areas in that it was a mixture of pasture,
woodlands, and plowed fields.
In plowed fields, the archeological survey effort
consisted of walking across the ground surface
looking for artifacts. Crews proceeded up and
down the crop rows, being careful not to trample

or damage the crop, while searching for artifact
concentrations. Generally speaking, if more than 10
or 20 artifacts were visible in a 100 to 250 m2 area,
the artifacts were designated as an archeological site
and fully recorded. Pin flags were used to help mark
these site areas, and also to locate specific diagnostic
artifacts (i.e., projectile points, prehistoric ceramic
rim or decorated sherds, or certain historic artifacts)
within the site boundaries that would be collected
after their locations were plotted on the site map in
relationship to an arbitrary established site datum.
Notes were taken by the Crew Chief or the Survey Supervisor on the density of artifacts visible on
the surface, and the types of artifacts visible that
were not collected (i.e., lithic debris, fire-cracked
rock, brick, etc.). Information was also recorded
on whether midden stains or other types of features
(i.e., such as a house foundation or a disturbed
burial) were apparent at the site.
In a few cases, most notably at the Dan Holdeman site (41RR11), controlled surface collections
of small areas (ca. 100-500 m2) were completed
to obtain representative samples of the range and
frequency of artifact types within selected sites
(such as the Late Caddo salt processing sites on

Perttula—Survey of the Roitsch Farm and Adjoining Lands, 1991–1992 175
Salt Well Slough, or the early 20th century tenant
farm community along Pond Creek). In these cases,
all the artifacts within the surface collection areas
were collected for laboratory analyses.
Depending upon the circumstances, and with
the permission of the landowner, some shovel testing was conducted in plowed fields (only within
recorded sites) to obtain information on the extent
and depth of subsurface cultural materials, and to
assess the potential of sites to contain features or
middens. Shovel tests were 30 x 30 cm in size, and
were excavated to a maximum of ca. 80 cm, or until
the B-horizon clay subsoil was reached. The soil
from the shovel tests was screened through 1/4-inch
meshed portable screens, and all artifacts recovered
in the screens were saved for laboratory analysis.
The shovel tests were not screened by level, but the
excavators keep notes on a Shovel Test Form (on
file at the Texas Archeological Research Laboratory
at The University of Texas at Austin) indicating the
general depths of the artifacts as they were found.
All shovel tests were numbered and plotted
on the site map. In addition to information on the
depths of the artifacts and the kinds of artifacts
found (if any), the Crew Chief recorded the total
depth of the shovel test, the types of soils encountered, and other specific data of archeological interest (such as lens of burned soil, middens, presence
of plow zones, or other zones of disturbance) on a
Site Summary Form.
In pastures and wooded areas, the crew members were spaced about 20-50 m apart, depending
upon the terrain, and they closely examined all
surface exposures (dirt roads, eroded areas, cut
banks, gopher holes, ant mounds, etc.) for the presence of archeological materials. Random shovel
tests were also excavated in likely areas, such as
terrace edges, alluvial rises, and upland landforms
overlooking streams while attempting to locate
archeological sites.
When surface cultural materials were noted
in these circumstances, shovel tests were then
excavated to determine if there were preserved
subsurface archeological deposits at the site, and to
try to determine their depth and extent. Shovel tests
were excavated in the same manner as described
above for plowed fields, both on known site areas
and during initial efforts to find sites.
Limited test excavations were conducted in
1992 at several of the survey sites, the results of
which are also described in Part II of this article.
The purpose of this work was to investigate in

more detail some prehistoric archeological sites
in the vicinity of the Roitsch site that appeared to
have significant Woodland period and post-A.D.
800 Caddo tradition deposits, and thus to collect
supplementary data on other prehistoric settlements
in the Mound Prairie area. Our interest was in assessing the character of these site’s archeological
deposits, determining what types of features were
present (if any), acquiring representative samples
of material culture remains (especially domestic
ceramics and lithic tools), as well as recovering
samples of charcoal to obtain radiocarbon dates.
The testing consisted of 1 x 1 m units excavated in 10 cm levels, with the levels measured with
a line level and 3 m tape from the ground surface
of each corner of the pit. Soil from all units was
screened through 1/4-inch mesh, and if warranted,
small samples of soil were collected for flotation
analysis or radiocarbon dating. Unit level forms
were completed for each level, as was a feature
form when a feature was found. Soil profiles were
also completed of one wall of the test units, and a
photograph taken of the scribed profile.
Photographs were taken of the site areas, when
possible (technical difficulties sometimes presented themselves during this task), along with any
obvious natural or cultural features on the site or in
the vicinity that would aid in its future relocation.
Temporary datums were placed at the sites, and the
site area, shovel tests, surface collection areas, and
surface collected diagnostics were mapped in relationship to it; when the mapping was completed,
the temporary datum was removed.

PART I
FINDINGS OF THE
1991-1992 TEXAS
ARCHEOLOGICAL
SOCIETY FIELD SCHOOL
ARCHEOLOGICAL SURVEY
The main purpose of the archeological survey
was to identify and record prehistoric and historic
sites in this Red River alluvial setting, assess the

176

Texas Archeological Society

contextual integrity and research potential of each
of the sites in so far as feasible, and evaluate their
temporal and cultural relationships, particularly
their relationships to the Early-Late Caddo occupations at the nearby Roitsch site (41RR16).
We expected that the information gained from the
archeological survey would allow us to address
(to some extent) the following research problems
and project goals (see Bruseth et al. 1991, 1992;
Perttula et al. 2001; Perttula, ed., this volume):
• Improve the Local Chronology
• Understand the Village Structure at the
Roitsch Site
• Understand the Village Structure at all of
the sites
• Determine if the Caddo were Processing
Salt near the Roitsch Site, and
• Examine Early Anglo-American Settlement and Trade
I will take up each of these research problems in
turn, following a summary discussion of the character and content of the prehistoric and historic
archeological sites in the survey area.

SUMMARY OF THE SURVEY
FINDINGS
A significant body of information on the Archaic, Woodland, and Caddo settlement and use
of the Mound Prairie area was obtained during the
course of the Texas Archeological Society (TAS)
survey effort, but commensurably less was gathered on the historic Anglo-American and AfricanAmerican settlement because most of the historic
sites and components discovered date principally
to the first and second quarters of the 20th century
when large numbers of tenant farmers lived in
the area (cf. Harper 1996a:496). Nevertheless,
information on settlement locations, the presence
of cultural features at some sites, and the recovery
of substantial samples of prehistoric (n=9360) and
historic (n=4934) artifacts from many sites (Tables
1 and 2), allows us to begin discerning diachronic
and spatial changes in land use patterns along the
Red River and Big Pine Creek.
Prehistoric archeological sites are thickly
distributed along Big Pine Creek and Salt Well
Slough (Figure 2), primarily in immediate proximity
to the Caddo-era Roitsch village, but extending
downstream to the Dan Holdeman site. Most are
situated on sandy loam soils on the edge of alluvial

tempered sherds and daub/burned clay, occur on a
band of dense clays that parallels Salt Well Slough
and Big Pine Creek below its confluence with Salt
Well Slough. A similarly dense cluster of prehistoric
sites is apparent along the edges of alluvial terraces
around the Wright Plantation site (Figure 3).
Of the 109 sites recorded on the Roitsch, Holdeman, and Tarrant/Wright farmlands, 89 percent had
evidence of at least one prehistoric occupation. The
recovery of diagnostic projectile points and ceramics (especially decorated sherds or sherds with shell
tempering) from surface collections, shovel tests,
and a few 1 x 1 m units (see Table 1 and Appendix
II), suggests that there were two peaks in periods of
settlement: from the Late Archaic (ca. 2000 B.C. to
A.D. 200) through the Woodland (ca. A.D. 200-A.D.
800) period, and then again during the Late Caddo
period, specifically during the McCurtain phase (ca.
A.D. 1300-1650/1700). However, finds from the
sites in the TAS survey area, including information
obtained from the excavations at Roitsch and Fasken
(see Perttula, ed., this volume; Perttula et al. 2001;
Prikryl, this volume), also indicate that the area

was utilized by Native Americans from Paleoindian
times to about A.D. 1700 or later.
Many of the Late Archaic and Woodland
period sites probably represent small, seasonally
occupied forager camps, although at least a few of
the Woodland period sites (such as 41RR101) have
middens and dense occupational refuse. These types
of sites are very similar to the Ray site (41LR135;
see Bruseth et al. 2001) in that they contain thick
grog-tempered pottery, and thus they may be small
homesteads occupied on a multi-seasonal or yearround basis; structures and cooking/storage features
are probably preserved in the archeological deposits
from such sites.
Only four (4.5 percent) of the prehistoric sites
have identifiable Formative (ca. A.D. 800-1000) to
Middle Caddo period (ca. A.D. 1100-1300) occupations, probably farmsteads. One such habitation
site near Fasken, site 41RR206 (see Part II of this
article), has a discrete midden deposit and an abundance of prehistoric ceramics and stone tools. It
probably represents one small part of the dispersed
Caddo community around this 11th-13th century

civic-ceremonial center (see Prikryl, this volume).
The Formative to Middle Caddo component at
the Holdeman site (41RR11), on a broad and low
alluvial terrace of the Red River, is represented
by at least one earthen mound that covered a circular house and a small Formative Caddo period
cemetery (Perino 1995; Perttula 1995), as well as

extensive village remains from a large settlement.
The Late Caddo period, McCurtain phase,
settlement of the Big Pine Creek and Salt Well
Slough areas was extensive, as was expected (cf.
Bruseth 1998; Harris 1953; Skinner et al. 1969). The
habitation sites are characterized by shell-tempered
ceramics, small triangular arrow points, and some

180

Texas Archeological Society

quantities of daub or burned clay. The sites are
presumed to represent dispersed farmsteads, or
compounds of farmsteads, that are associated with
the larger village community at the Roitsch site. The
habitation sites are typically small in size, may or may
not contain middens, and generally are not characterized by large quantities of material culture remains;
this suggests short (perhaps a few years) occupations
by prehistoric Caddo farmers. Some of these sites
contain family cemeteries, as at 41RR10/104 on Big
Pine Creek (cf. Hampton and Moore 1936). Other
Late Caddo components include three salt-making
sites on Salt Well Slough, not including the Salt Well
Slough site (41RR204; see Kenmotsu 2006), as well
as a few components that simply contain a few triangular arrow points from either hunting/refurbishing
camps and/or from hunting losses.
A much larger Late Caddo occupation was
defined at the Holdeman site during our 1992 TAS
investigations. Holdeman appears to have been a
substantial village during Late Caddo times, as it
contains abundant artifacts (mainly shell-tempered
ceramics) and features, as well as numerous cemeteries, marking clusters of Caddo houses of this
age spread across a large alluvial terrace of the Red
River. During deep plowing of one portion of the
site in 1992, the landowner exposed considerable
Late Caddo habitation debris and broken vessels
from disturbed burials across a spring branch from
the Formative Caddo mound mentioned above, and
Perino (1995) excavated some 30 burials from this
area in the early 1980s before land-leveling activities; other cemeteries and structures were disturbed
by pipeline construction before that in several other
locales within the boundaries of the site (see Briscoe
1995). In most particulars, the archeological deposits
at the Holdeman site during the Late Caddo occupation are thought to be quite comparable to the village
areas at Roitsch (Blocks III-IV) (Perttula et al. 2001;
Perttula, ed., this volume; see also Banks and Banks
2002), Bob Williams (Perino 1983), and Rowland
Clark (41RR77), another contemporaneous Late
Caddo village a few km downstream from Holdeman
on the Red River (Perino 1994).

Wedel 1978) and ethnographic descriptions of the
dispersed nature of Caddo settlement in East and
Northeast Texas (see Foster 1998), it was expected
that in addition to the larger Late Caddo communities with mounds (as at Roitsch) the settlement
system would also be comprised of individual
farmsteads, hamlets, and small villages (Bruseth
et al. 1992:10, 22). It was uncertain whether such
a model of settlement would also be applicable to
Formative-Middle Caddo period communities in
the Mound Prairie area.
The archeological survey data from the Roitsch
Farm does suggest that there are clusters of contemporaneous Late Caddo period farmsteads and ancillary sites located immediately to the south and west
of the Roitsch site along old channels of the Red
River (now used as channels by Big Pine Creek and
Salt Well Slough). No evidence was recovered in the
survey to indicate that larger Late Caddo hamlets
or villages occur away from the river itself, as all
the non-salt-making sites along Big Pine Creek and
Salt Well Slough seem to have been about the size
to contain individual houses, small trash middens,
and a household cemetery. The dispersion of Late
Caddo remains at Holdeman suggests that a number
of presumably associated household compounds are
present there (as they are in the extensive village at
the Roitsch site; see Perttula et al. 2001; Perttula,
ed., this volume), but the village lacked a mound
during this occupation.
The low number of Formative-Middle Caddo
period sites in the survey areas argues against the
same type of dispersed settlement system as characterized the Late Caddo period adaptation in the
Mound Prairie area. The few sites of this period that
were identified during the TAS Field School occur
only in immediate proximity to Roitsch, Fasken,
Wright Plantation, and Holdeman, each being large
civic-ceremonial villages with mounds. This suggests that populations during Formative-Middle
Caddo times were mainly concentrated in a few
optimal locales along the Red River, but became
more dispersed in Late Caddo period times to suitable habitats to cultivate crops and gather salt.

Caddo Salt Processing

los Rios map of a Red River Caddo community

In addition to the salt processing site at Salt Well
Slough (41RR204; see Kenmotsu 2006), three other
Late Caddo period salt making sites (41RR248,
41RR256, and 41RR257) have been identified immediately south of the Salt Well Slough site along

Perttula—Survey of the Roitsch Farm and Adjoining Lands, 1991–1992 181
Salt Well Slough below its confluence with Pond
Creek. Known salt-making sites, on intractable clay
soils, extend for at least 800 m along high ground
immediately adjacent to the slough.
These sites contain extremely abundant surface
and buried archeological deposits of large, shelltempered Nash Neck Banded and Emory PunctatedIncised jar sherds, with only a few other kinds of
decorated sherds (mainly Avery Engraved), large
quantities of burned clay (and daub), and evidence
from shovel testing of burned and oxidized soils;
few chipped or ground stone tools or pieces of lithic
debris have been found at these sites (see Part II
and Appendix II). Our inference that these are saltmaking sites hinges on the fact that Salt Well Slough
is fed by a salt spring, on the findings of features
and burned areas from the Salt Well Slough site, the
chemical analysis of soils and sherds from the latter
site, and comparisons with other salt-making sites
in southwestern Arkansas and northwestern Louisiana (cf. Early 1993; Girard 2006; Kenmotsu 2006).
Despite the extensive amounts of broken sherds and
daub at the Salt Well Slough site, no evidence of
discrete habitation areas was recognized during the
archeological investigations there.
Anglo-American Settlement and Trade
The recorded historic archeological sites are
the remnants of homesteads and tenant farms occupied principally between 1860 and 1950. These
sites contain a variety of material culture items (see
Table 2), principally including ceramics and bottle
glass from kitchen/domestic use (94 percent),
along with nails, bricks, and window glass from the
construction and repair of structures (2.4 percent),
metal tools, horse and stable items, clothing buttons and buckles, firearms, household furnishings,
and items for personal use. Of the 56 archeological
sites that have historic archeological components,
only 12.5 percent have occupations that predate
1900, while another 23 percent may have had 19th
century occupations but the archeological material remains are equivocal. One late 19th century
cemetery (41RR235) was recorded on the upper
reaches of Salt Well Slough (Figure 4).
Early 19th century artifacts (English transferprinted and hand-painted ceramics, dark green
bottle glass, square nails, and metal implements,
etc.) have been found in some quantity at Jonesborough (see Reese 2001; Perttula and Reese 2001),
as well as on Mound B at Fasken (see Prikryl, this

volume), and similar material remains have been
documented in the R. K. Harris collection (now at
the National Museum of Natural History, Smithsonian Institution, Washington, D.C.) from the
Wright Plantation site (41RR7) and several sites
on the Tarrant lands examined by the Northeast
Texas Archeological Society (see Part II below,
and Nelson et al. 1995). However, clear Antebellum Anglo-American or early 19th century Native
American sites were not identified in the TAS Field
School survey.
Nevertheless, the historic sites are widely
dispersed across the Roitsch Farm (see Figure 4),
but they are especially common on high ground
between Big Pine Creek and Pond Creek, but off
of the Late Holocene alluvial terraces where the
Roitsch site is situated. The few historic sites that
were occupied only in the 19th century appear to be
along landforms paralleling the tributaries of Red
River, particularly Big Pine Creek (for example,
site 41RR266, see Part II), rather than on the river
itself. These landforms were probably chosen for
settlement to avoid the regular and often devastating
flooding along the Red River in modern times.
These historic farmsteads cluster around the
old and abandoned community of Blakeney (see
Hazlewood 1996:580), along the roads that ran
from the late 19th-mid-20th century towns of
Manchester and Davenport (near Jonesborough),
and immediately north of Pond Creek where an unnamed 20th century community of tenant farmers
lived. This particular community was reported to
have had as many as 15 separate farmsteads and a
blacksmith shop, and a general store was thought
to have been in the area as well. The TAS survey
of that area recorded six ca. 1900-1930 farmsteads
(41RR215, 41RR222-41RR225, 41RR227), and
through systematic surface collections recovered a
large sample of domestic artifacts associated with
each of the farms (see Appendix III).
On the Tarrant and Wright farms, 19th and 20th
century sites are also concentrated on high alluvial
terraces along the Red River (Figure 5). Many of
the historic sites date to the late 19th-mid-20th century and represent farmsteads and later tenant farms
associated with the large cotton-producing Wright
Plantation, established in the early 19th century
(see Steely 1982). Unlike the Roitsch farm lands,
a number of the Tarrant and Wright farm sites have
ca. 1830-1860 archeological deposits and material
culture remains, particularly refined English earthenware, locally-produced stonewares, English wine

bottles, and other assorted items. Clearly, there was a
substantial antebellum occupation at the confluence
of the Kiamichi and Red rivers.
In general, the archeological and historical
research significance of late 19th and early 20th
century farmsteads like those recorded during the
TAS Field Schools remains unexplored in Northeast Texas, as it does in much of Texas (Denton
1999). Little substantive archeological, archival,
and/or historical research has been completed
on rural agricultural settlements in the Northeast
Texas region outside of the Cooper Lake project
area on the South Sulphur River (see Fields et al.
1997; McGregor et al. 1996). Nevertheless, should
further archeological investigations demonstrate
that intact deposits, features, and material culture
items remain at any of the farmstead sites, they
have the potential to contribute important information on the history and settlement of the Red River
valley, and a better understanding of a broad range
of research themes (cf. Jurgelski et al. 1996:69-71),
including the: (a) architectural and material culture

correlates of social status, (b) settlement patterns/
spatial organization, (c) subsistence/economic
organization, (d) community structure/social organization, (e) visibility of ethnic differences, and
(f) diversity in Upper and Lower South cultural
lifeways and adaptations along the middle reaches
of the Red River.

SITE DESCRIPTIONS
This section presents detailed descriptions of
each of the sites recorded during the 1991 and 1992
Texas Archeological Society (TAS) Field School
in Red River County, Texas. As previously mentioned, a number of sites had already been recorded
on the Roitsch farm, and on other farms along the
Red River, some as early as 1936, but most in 1972

Texas Archeological Society

41RR10/41RR104, Howard Hampton Place
Site 41RR10 was originally recorded by
Howard Hampton and George Moore (1936).
During the 1932 grading of FM 410 across the alluvial rise, a Late Caddo period McCurtain phase
(probably late in the McCurtain phase, after ca.
A.D. 1500) cemetery was exposed, and looting
began. Hampton and Moore (1936) report that
nine extended burials were found in the cemetery,
and included as funerary objects with the burials
were a number of ceramic vessels (including Avery Engraved, Simms Engraved, and Nash Neck
Banded; see Hampton and Moore 1936:Plates X
and XI) along with a stone pipe. They also noted
pottery sherds, mussel shell, fire-cracked rock,
arrow points, and drills on the surface of the site.
TARL has a small amount of engraved and plain
shell-tempered pottery from the Howard Hampton
Place. During the SMU survey, a small amount of
lithic debris, an arrow point preform, and plain
shell (n=3) and grog- and grit-tempered (n=6)
pottery was collected from a 45 m diameter area
of the site surface (Table 3).
The Howard Hampton Place site was in pasture
when it was visited by the TAS. The alluvial rise,

bisected by FM 410, covers about 2000 m2 (we did
not have landowner permission to survey the eastern half of the site, and thus it is expected that the
site is a good bit larger) and it is 3 m above the Big
Pine Creek floodplain. A few pieces of lithic debris
and a ground stone tool fragment were visible on a
slightly higher part of the rise, and two shovel tests
were placed there to determine if there were subsurface cultural deposits still preserved at the site. The
soil (Desha clay) is a very plastic clay (see Thomas
1977), and difficult to excavate, but one of the two
shovel tests contained a single plain pottery sherd
at ca. 15 cm bs.
Although it appears that the site only contains
sparse cultural materials, the previous discovery
of a small Late Caddo, McCurtain phase cemetery
on the rise suggests that remnants of an associated
farmstead may be present nearby as well. The road
construction and plowing have adversely effected
the site, and the shallow clayey soils are a constraint
to excavations, but we believe this site may still has
some research potential, particularly in conjunction
with local and regional archeological investigations
of the Late Caddo McCurtain phase. The plain
grog- and grit-tempered pottery from the Howard
Hampton Place is probably from an earlier Caddo

occupation, dating prior to A.D. 1300, when these
temper inclusions were common in the ceramics.
41RR11, Dan Holdeman Site
The Dan Holdeman site is a major prehistoric
Red River Caddo village, comparable in scope and
character to the Roitsch-Williams (41RR16) and
Rowland Clark (41RR77) villages a few miles upstream and downstream from the site, respectively
(see Skinner et al. 1969; Perino 1983, 1994). The
site was also occupied during Paleoindian and
Archaic times, as well as during the 19th century
as part of the Houser Plantation (see summary in
Briscoe 1995), but the major occupation(s) took

place in the Formative Caddo period, the Middle
Caddo Mound Prairie phase (locally equivalent to
the Sanders phase, see Perttula, ed., this volume:
Table 1), and in Late Caddo McCurtain phase
times. There are thought to have been four earthen
mounds constructed at the Dan Holdeman site
during the Caddo occupation (see Briscoe 1995),
possibly all of them during the extensive Mound
Prairie phase occupation of the site.
The site is situated on low and high alluvial
terraces immediately overlooking the floodplain
and current channel of the Red River (see Perino
1995:Figure 1), and covers about 25-30 acres of the
terraces (Figure 6). The western edge of the Dan
Holdeman site is State Highway 37, which earlier

in the 20th century ended at the Albion Ferry along
the south bank of the Red River. The terraces have
been cultivated for crop lands for more than 100
years, and erosion and topsoil removal has been
severe in some areas (as much as 60 cm according
to Perino [1995]). More recently, within the last 10
years, several areas of the site have been bulldozed
and leveled by the landowner to create new fields
and drainage ditches, and a pipeline cut across the
terrace had impacted parts of several Caddo period
cemeteries.
It appears that the site was first recorded in the
early 1930s by the University of Texas as the J.
R. Houser Plantation at the village of Albion, and
notes on file at TARL state that a Red River flood
in the late 1920s exposed several burials and ceramic vessels on the plantation. TARL collections
from the site (then with the trinomial 41RR13;
the current site boundaries for the Holdeman site
include the J. R. Houser Plantation) include marine
shell beads, catfish spines, and Lithospermum sp.
beads.
The next archeological investigation at Dan
Holdeman was by the Museum of the Red River
between 1983-1985 when the Museum held a summer field school there (Perino 1995), along with
two short periods of work to salvage portions of
prehistoric Caddo cemeteries slated for immediate
bulldozing and land leveling by the landowner. In
essence, Perino’s work focused on the excavation
of a Mound Prairie phase mound, which covered a
5 x 6 m rectangular structure as well as a few Formative Caddo features (pits, hearths, dog burials,
and portions of one or two structures) and graves;
during the McCurtain phase a small cemetery was
placed atop the mound by the Caddo, comparable
to the Caddo’s use of the East Mound at the Roitsch
site (see Perttula, ed., this volume; Skinner et al.
1969; Harris 1953). Perino also conducted limited
excavations in two Mound Prairie phase and/or
McCurtain phase cemeteries south of the earthen
mound (Figure 7; see Perino 1995; Perttula 1995).
The poorly preserved skeletal remains from these
Caddo cemeteries have been analyzed by Loveland (1987, 1994), and the Caddo populations
living there were similar in their diet and health
conditions to contemporaneous populations from
Roitsch, Bob Williams, and Rowland Clark.
The TAS investigations at the Dan Holdeman
site in 1992 came about at the request of Mr. Dan
Holdeman, the landowner. He asked the TAS
to investigate a large plowed field south of the

mound that he had just deep-plowed, exposing
large quantities of prehistoric cultural materials,
including major sections of reconstructable Caddo
ceramic vessels. This field (see Figure 6) is the
same as Area A in Perino (1995:Figure 1).
Our investigations over parts of two days consisted of mapping the distribution of artifacts across
the plowed field, defining specific concentrations of
artifacts (designated TAS areas A-D) and possible
features (Figure 8), and carrying out a selective
surface collection (of temporally or functionally diagnostic ceramic and lithic artifacts) in the plowed
field and one area near State Highway 37 where a
19th and 20th century archeological deposit had
been exposed by erosion (cf. Briscoe 1995). No
excavations or shovel tests were conducted at the
site at the request of Mr. Holdeman other than a
shallow 2 x 2 m unit to expose a number of disturbed vessels in TAS area A (see below).
At the conclusion of the TAS work, Mr. Holdeman provided us with more information on the
archeological deposits at the Holdeman site. He
has prepared a scaled map (using the pipeline that
cuts across the site as a datum line) of features (primarily human burials) exposed on the site since he
became the landowner; it also has plottings of some
of the areas where Perino worked in the 1980s. This
information has proved to be particularly useful
since Perino’s (1995) original MS did not contain a
map with complete provenience information on his
excavation areas (for instance, the location of the
cemetery areas off the mound was not provided in
Perino [1995]). Holdeman’s map indicates that there
are several Caddo cemeteries on the low alluvial terrace, both east and west of the spring branch, now a
drainage culvert (see Figure 7); the pipeline through
the site has disturbed these cemeteries.
Most recently, Briscoe (1995) conducted a survey along the western margins of the Holdeman site
as part of the abandonment of the OkTex pipeline
and tie station. While the pipeline abandonment itself was determined to have no effect on significant
archeological deposits, principally because only a
small area was involved and it had been disturbed
many years ago during construction of the State
Highway 37 bridge, Briscoe (1995) did locate a
substantial McCurtain phase archeological deposit
in the vicinity of the tie station; daub and ceramics were particularly abundant. Mike Turner (1994
personal communication) also has noted a 10-15 m
long concentration of daub in the same site area that
suggests that one or two burned Caddo structures are

excavated a long trench in the area to remove the
pipeline that ties in with the OkTex pipeline.
As mentioned above, the TAS work at the Dan
Holdeman site focused on a large (500 x 200 m, ca.
25 acres) plowed field on the low alluvial terrace (see
Figure 8). The crews systematically examined the
field, noting and mapping the locations of diagnostic

lithic and ceramic artifacts (which were numbered
from 1-19, although other unnumbered diagnostic
artifacts were collected from Area B) as well as four
larger areas (areas A-D) where artifacts (especially
ceramic sherds from recently broken vessels) were
particularly concentrated. At the completion of the
mapping of the field and areas A, B, and D, the
diagnostic artifacts were collected for study.

A single grog-tempered vessel (Vessel 1) was
also documented in TAS area B; it was the lower
body and base of a thin-walled (5.6 mm) plain jar
or bowl with a flat disk base. The exterior surface
of area B, Vessel 1 was well-burnished.
A total of 151 rim and decorated sherds of grog
and grog-bone tempered sherds from Holdeman
can be associated with the Formative and Middle

The appliqued decorative elements include
strips and nodes, primarily on the bodies of jars
(including several of the vessels from TAS Area
A) with plain, incised, or punctated rim decorations. Most of the engraved sherds are from bowls
and carinated bowls with diagonal, diagonal and
horizontal, or cross-hatched rim motifs from
Sanders Engraved vessels (see Suhm and Jelks
1962:Plate 69), although a small number have
curvilinear decorative elements (n=6) and pendant
triangles (n=2) (Figure 18). The incised sherds
primarily have horizontal (n=6), multiple parallel (n=7), cross-hatched (n=5), diagonal (n=4),
and diagonal/opposed (n=4) decorative elements,
along with single examples of herringbone, opposed, and vertical incised (Figure 19); with the
exception of the horizontal incised rims, these
sherds are probably all from Canton Incised vessels (see Suhm and Jelks 1962:Plate 12). The 12
incised-punctated sherds are from Canton Incised
jars (Figure 20c, f). They are decorated with zoned
incised triangles filled with punctations. The most
common punctated decoration consists of multiple
rows of punctations (n=10) on the rim of jars with
either straight or everted rims (Figure 20a-b), but
punctations randomly covering the body of vessels
are also present (n=4).
The high proportion of red slipped plain sherds
(18.4 percent of the decorated sherds), including
plain red slipped rims and plain red slipped rims
with scalloped lips (Figure 21), from the site suggests that the primary earlier Caddo occupation of
Perino’s Area A was during the Middle Caddo period (see Bruseth 1998; Perttula 1997a). More than
23 percent of the Middle Caddo, Mound Prairie
phase, component vessels at Holdeman excavated
by Perino (1995) have a red slip, plain bowls and

jars were common, and Canton Incised jars were
particularly common. Maxey Noded Red ware
is absent in the small TAS sherd collection from
Holdeman, but relatively abundant in excavated
and landowner collections from the site (Perino
1995; Perttula 1995, 1997b).
The low terrace appears to also have been
settled during the Late Caddo McCurtain phase
(see discussion in Perttula 1995), as sections of
shell-tempered ceramic vessels were mapped and
recovered in several of the areas defined by the
TAS survey teams. In area A in the southwestern
corner of the field, sections of 11 vessels were
found over a ca. 5 m2 area, along with small, powdery pieces of bone from disturbed human burials.
A 2 x 2 m unit was laid out over the vessels to
determine their contextual association, and the
unit was shovel scraped to define and locate burial
pits and features as well as other possible grave
furniture. No cultural features or other ceramic
vessels were revealed in shovel scraping the unit
to a depth of 30 cm below the bottom of the eight
vessels. Thus, unfortunately it seems likely that
the deep plowing had massively cut and mixed the

0

deposits to some depth underneath the shallowly
buried graves in this part of the site.
Two of the TAS area A vessels are shell-tempered, Vessel 1 in Feature 4 and Vessel 1 in Feature
7. The other nine documented in Area A have grog,
grog-bone, or no apparent tempering aplastics. The
Feature 4 vessel is a plain red-slipped bowl with an
interior thickened rim, while Vessel 1 in Feature 7 is
30 percent of a plain jar with a small strap handle.
Also present in Feature 7 was a shell-tempered
Emory Punctated-Incised rim sherd, and a plain
shell-tempered red slipped sherd was recovered in association with Feature 3. Other plain shell-tempered
sherds were found with Features 5 and 7.
In Area B, the Late Caddo component is represented by five (Vessels 2-6) shell-tempered vessels
(one Avery Engraved, one plain, two appliqued,
and one horizontal engraved) that appear to be part
of three separate and disturbed Caddo interments.
Vessel 2 is 20 percent of a plain red-slipped bowl;
Vessel 3 is 40 percent of a small jar with four vertical appliqued strips; Vessel 4 is 25 percent of a
red-slipped Avery Engraved V-shaped bowl (Figure
22); Vessel 5 is 20 percent of a red-slipped bowl

with a single horizontal engraved line below the
lip, along with nodes; and Vessel 6 is 20 percent
a small bowl with an appliqued strip. Each of the
vessels has thin rim and body walls, ranging from
3-6 mm in thickness, and flat disk bases. A single
Scallorn var. sattler arrow point, generally found in
early McCurtain phase contexts (see Brown 1996;
Perino 1995; Skinner et al. 1969), was also found
in association with Vessel 6.
Probing adjacent to the pipeline that runs by
TAS area B identified ceramic vessels that were
in situ, suggesting that at least two or three undisturbed Caddo burials occur here as well. One large
greenstone celt and several celt fragments, of the
style common in McCurtain phase components at
Roitsch (Ferring 1969) and Rowland Clark (Perino
1994), was also recovered on the surface in Area B
(Figure 23). Areas C and D had three small partial
vessel sections from disturbed Late Caddo graves.
One celt and several celt fragments were also recovered in the northern part of area D.
In addition to the vessels, there are 35
decorated and/or rim sherds with shell-tempering
in the TAS collections from Dan Holdeman. All

are from Perino’s (1995) Area A. They include two
plain rims, 11 body and rim sherds with interior
and/or exterior red-slipping, nine engraved, five
incised, four punctated, three neck-banded, and
one appliqued sherd (Figure 24).
The red-slipped sherds are from plain undecorated bowls with direct rims, either Clement
Redware (Flynn 1976) and/or Roden Ware (Perino
1981). Among the shell-tempered engraved sherds
are six red- and black-slipped Avery Engraved
specimens, one Hudson Engraved, one diagonal engraved, and one rim with horizontal engraved lines.
The single cross-hatched incised sherd from Area
A may be from a Maydelle Incised vessel, but the
diagonal and diagonal-parallel incised decorative
elements occur as well on early varieties of Emory
Punctated-Incised jars (cf. Perino 1981). The punctated sherds are from Emory Punctated-Incised jars
with rows of rim punctations. The neck-banded
sherds are from Nash Neck Banded sherds (see
Figure 24e), as may be the single body sherd with
the appliqued strip. In general, the prevalence of
undecorated red-slipped shell-tempered vessels, an
early form of Emory Punctated-Incised, and both red

and black-slipped Avery Engraved, suggests that the
McCurtain phase component at Holdeman dates to
the early phase (ca. A.D. 1300-1500) (see Bruseth
1998; Perttula 1992:Table 11). Also associated with
the McCurtain phase component are shell-tempered
elbow pipe sherds (see Figure 11b), Maud arrow
points (from Area A), and a Harrell side-notched
arrow point from Area A (see Figure 10g, j).
Three parallel brushed sherds (with grog temper)
from the lower terrace are also likely to be associated
with these Late Caddo ceramics (see Figure 24d).
The brushed sherds may well be from a Whelan
or Titus phase vessel traded from the Big Cypress
Creek basin, where contemporaneous grog-tempered
vessels were common (see Thurmond 1990). Brushed
sherds—whether shell—or grog-tempered—are
otherwise quite rare in the middle part of the Red
River valley in Northeast Texas.
The historic archeological component at the
Dan Holdeman site is present on the higher terrace
paralleling Highway 37 and the pumping station,
as well as a garden area north of the mound (see

Figure 7). The earlier 19th century material in this
area is probably related to the Houser Plantation,
and includes square or cut nails, decorated refined earthenware (shell-edged, transfer-printed,
annular, sponged, and hand-painted) (Figure 25),
salt-glazed and alkaline-glazed stoneware (Figure
26e-f), lead balls (Figure 26c), dark olive green
bottle glass (Figure 26b), and kaolin pipe stems
(Figure 26d). Post-1880 settlement on the high
terrace is denoted by considerable amounts of
semi-automatic or machine-made bottle glass,
plain whiteware sherds, decalcomania, reliefmolded and gilt lip banded sherds, and sherds with
maker’s marks, lead-glazed stoneware, Bristolglazed stoneware, natural clay slipped stoneware,
and other items (see Appendix III).
The Dan Holdeman site is one of the more
significant prehistoric Caddo village sites in the
Middle Red River area; it has earlier prehistoric
and later historic occupations that also have research significance. Unfortunately, it has been
adversely effected over the years by pothunting

subsurface context is not clear (see Reese 2001).
These materials are most common from the historic
marker north to the Bagwell property north of Pool
Area B and D (Figure 27).
Excavations by the TAS in 1991 in Pool Area
B located the burial tomb of Jane Chandler Gill (b.
1782, d. 1846) west of Mrs. Pool’s house, and several
other features were located that may relate to the
town of Jonesborough. However, the majority of the
historic archeological deposits seem to relate to the
later community of Davenport (see Reese 2001).
While the Historic Archeology team was investigating the Jonesborough town site area by Mrs.
Pool’s house, the Survey Team conducted shovel
testing and surface collections on the Roitsch West
area to delimit two concentrations of prehistoric
cultural materials on sandy rises (Rises I and II)

overlooking the former channel of Red River (see
Figure 27). Small amounts of prehistoric ceramics
and bone were recovered from midden deposits in
six shovel tests; lithic debris and daub were noted
on the surface of both rises. Prehistoric Caddo
houses probably stood on each of the rises, but
plowing has disturbed them to some extent. Nevertheless, prehistoric ceramics, daub, and bone
were recovered in apparently good contexts below
50 cm bs in Rise II. In the main, the ceramics are
shell-tempered, thus indicating that the Caddo
occupation occurred during the McCurtain phase.
Considerable McCurtain phase artifacts were also
recovered in Pool Area D, as well as at the nearby
Pine Cone site (41RR236; see below). Some earlier
prehistoric materials were recovered as well from
surface contexts (i.e., dart projectile points) and
shovel testing on Rise I, and these probably relate
to an Woodland or Late Archaic age component.

Although the site has been plowed for more
than 100 years, has been impacted by river bank
erosion, and has been flooded on many occasions,
there are areas within the Jonesborough town site
that have intact prehistoric and historic archeological deposits. Further efforts are warranted, including examination of aerial photographs, to try to
locate foundations and features associated with
the 1816-1844 town; Pool Area A and B have the
best potential to contain these types of remains.
Work in Pool Area C (see Figure 27) should also
be conducted to determine if the Jonesborough
courthouse mentioned in oral interviews is present
in that area. Significant data on Late Caddo McCurtain phase farmsteads may be obtained from
both the Roitsch West (Rise II) and Pool Area D
subareas of 41RR15.
41RR85
Originally located by SMU, they described the
site as containing a “thin deposit” of lithic debris
and Late Archaic projectile points (Yarbrough and
Edgewood) eroding out of the bank of an alluvial
terrace of Big Pine Creek (Hyatt and Mosca 1972). A
wide assortment of cultural materials were collected
at 41RR85 (see Table 3) at that time in addition
to the Late Archaic points, including lithic debris,
grinding stone fragments, a ferruginous sandstone
axe fragment, an end scraper, three bifacial tool
fragments and one bifacial preform, 11 expedient
edge-modified pieces, and 129 g of burned clay.
The lithic debris and tools were from local brown
and red cherts and quartzite, with 5.5 percent of the
lithic debris, both projectile points, 50 percent of
the bifacial fragments, and 55 percent of the flake
tools from Ouachita Mountains cherts, available in
the Red River gravels (see Banks 1990).
Our investigations indicate that the site covers
about 8 acres of a Pleistocene terrace some 6 m
above, and 300 m from, Big Pine Creek. It is presently covered in pasture grass.
Limited amounts of chert lithic debris (n=18),
bifacial tool fragments, fire-cracked rock, and
ground stone tools were observed in small eroded
areas along much of the crest of the terrace; no
apparent concentrations were noted in limited investigations. Shovel tests in that area recovered a
moderate density of chert lithic debris, fire-cracked
rock, a core, small amounts of daub, and plain
grog-tempered pottery sherds (n=2) throughout a
40-50 cm thick A-horizon (which had been plowed)

over a red clay B-horizon. No midden deposits
were noted at the site. While SMU’s work indicated
that 41RR85 had a Late Archaic occupation, the
plain pottery sherds suggest that the site was also
used during either the Woodland and/or earlier
Caddo times.
The shallow, plowed soils, and the wide, but
dispersed nature of the archeological remains do
not suggest that the site has great potential to contain intact deposits of either Archaic, Woodland,
or Formative to Early Caddo age. However, the
recovery of ceramics in both shovel tests (at depths
from 0-25 cm), and daub from Shovel Test #1, may
be an indication that a farmstead or homestead was
present on one area of the alluvial terrace; the shallow depth of the A-horizon over clay is favorable
for detecting post holes, pits, or features that extend
from an occupation horizon (or the plow zone) into
the sterile subsoil. Further investigations may be
warranted if the temporal context of these materials
can be established with reasonable certainty.
41RR99
The site is located in a pasture on a possible
alluvial/colluvial landform adjacent to Big Pine
Creek. It covers about 1800 m2 and, based on the
TAS shovel testing, has archeological deposits
between 20-40 cm in thickness.
During the 1972 SMU survey, artifacts were
observed eroding out at the northern edge of the
landform. A large amount of artifacts were collected
from the surface (see Table 3). About 4.5 percent
of the lithic debris is of Ouachita Mountains chert,
while 36 percent of the 11 expedient edge-modified
flake tools are of this raw material. Of particular
note in the collections was one Scallorn arrow
point of Ogallala quartzite, seven Gary dart points
(including the Late Archaic and pre-A.D. 200 forms
of var. Gary and var. LeFlore [Schambach 1982])
on Ogallala quartzite (n=5), Ouachita Mountains
chert, and a local yellow chert, and two plain grogtempered pottery sherds. These suggest that the site
was principally occupied during the Late Archaic
and earlier part of the Woodland period, while the
Scallorn point may be from a later Woodland (postA.D. 700) or Formative Caddo use of 41RR99.
During our work at 41RR99, a moderate density
of lithic debris (n=47) and one plain pottery sherd
(Shovel Test #4) were recovered in sandy loam Ahorizon deposits from four shovel tests dispersed
across the site (Figure 28); lithic debris was noted on

Perttula—Survey of the Roitsch Farm and Adjoining Lands, 1991–1992 201

Figure 28. Site map of 41RR99.

the surface. Daub was also found in Shovel Test #3.
No features or middens were noted at the site, and
the landform has been plowed. However, the presence of subsurface deposits, and the potential that
the archeological materials may pertain to a single
component Woodland habitation, suggests that a
small and discrete archeological site (from a period
of time in Northeast Texas that is not well understood
[Perttula et al. 1993] is still preserved at 41RR99.
Thus, site 41RR99 appears to possess research significance, and further investigations are warranted
should disturbances to the site be proposed.
41RR100
Site 41RR100 covers about 3 acres of an alluvial terrace (with two small rises) about 6 m above
the Big Pine creek floodplain; Big Pine Creek runs
in an old channel of the Red River and a slough is
present immediately below the site. During our investigations, a small amount of lithic debris and firecracked rock was visible on the surface in a pasture,
but when the site was recorded in 1972, considerable
lithics and ceramics were apparently collected from
the two small rises south of the slough.

The SMU work documented Archaic (probably
Late Archaic) and Caddo period occupations (see
Table 3). The former consisted of a dart point tip
and a few bifacial tools, a hammerstone, 20 firecracked rocks, and a sandstone mano and pitted
stone. The lithic debris is exclusively of local
cherts and quartzites (which is characteristic of
Late Archaic occupations), while 88 percent of
the 17 edge-modified flake tools are also on local
raw materials. Both pre- (81 grog and grog-bone
tempered ceramics, including several with red slips,
incisions, and punctated decorations on them) and
post-A.D. 1300 Caddo settlements and habitation
areas (16 plain shell-tempered pottery body sherds,
including two with red slips) are represented by a
large sherd sample (n=97).
Only one of the two shovel tests we excavated at
41RR100 contained artifacts, and these consisted of
one piece of lithic debris and four fire-cracked rocks
between 30-55 cm bs. The low density of surface
and subsurface cultural materials documented in the
TAS work is quite different from the SMU results.
Several explanations may account for the differences,
including: (a) the SMU and TAS sites may not be the
same, and the location of one has been misplotted;
(b) since 1972 the cultural materials on the site have
been extensively eroded and disturbed, such that
little in situ deposits remain; and (c) most of the
material present at the site was actually collected
during the earlier survey. Re-examination of the
SMU survey forms and notes is warranted to try to
resolve the archeological discrepancies, since the
discrepancies have implications for determinations
of site significance/research potential.
41RR101
This is a large (5.6 acres) prehistoric site
situated on a long, narrow alluvial terrace overlooking a slough of Big Pine creek and Red River.
The terrace is open pastureland with fairly deep
(ca. 80 cm) Annona-Freestone complex sands, but
eroded exposures are quite limited. Small amounts
of lithic debris were noted on the surface, but our
shovel testing demonstrated that there is a dense
subsurface cultural deposit preserved at the site,
particularly on a rise at the southeastern end of the
terrace (Figure 29).
SMU’s investigations showed that lithic debris
was “thinly” spread over the site, but that survey
crew did not shovel test to determine if there were
buried deposits; no temporally diagnostic artifacts

202

were recovered in their work. About 16 percent
of the lithic debris was of Ouachita Mountains
cherts, along with one of the two cores; there were
four edge-modified flake tools on local cherts. Our
conversations with local collectors during the 1991
survey effort indicated that 41RR101 was quite
productive, at least in terms of their interests (i.e.,
it has quantities of projectile points).
Fourteen shovel tests were scattered across the
site during the TAS work, and eight of them contained cultural materials such as projectile points,
lithic debris, pottery, daub, bone, and ground stone
tools to depths of 80 cm+ (see Figure 29). The
density of artifacts per shovel test (mean= 32.8 or
roughly 360 artifacts per m3) is among the highest
of all the shovel-tested sites on the Roitsch Farm.
The bone, ceramics, and daub, as well as
lithic debris, were concentrated in shovel tests
#1, 2, and 7 (see Figure 29), along with Gary dart
points. While the overall sample of artifacts from
the site is small, what was found is evidence that
an Woodland period occupation is present in this
area of the site. The recovery of bone in the sandy
soils also suggests that midden deposits may be
preserved in this area as well, perhaps in associa-

tion with a habitation site. Clearly, the 1991 work
demonstrated that site 41RR101 has considerable
potential to answer research questions concerning
Woodland period settlement in the Middle Red
River and Mound Prairie region.
In 1992, TAS survey crews returned to the site to
excavate 3 1 x 1 m units at the site to acquire more
specific information about the subsurface character of
the archeological deposits. Although the intent was to
place the test units in the area where shovel testing
had determined that ceramics, bone, and daub were
concentrated, the units were actually placed at the far
northern tip of the terrace (see Figure 29). Moderate
quantities of lithic debris (n=221) and fire-cracked
rock (n=21), as well as a dart point fragment, were
recovered in shallow (≤ 40 cm) sandy loam deposits
over a red clay B-horizon. An Archaic period component may be preserved here, although its integrity
is questionable because of the shallow, presumably
eroded, nature of the soils at the tip of the landform.
Eleven sherds and nine pieces of daub in the three
test units are apparently indicative of the Woodland
period component better preserved upslope on the
rise; three shell-tempered sherds in unit N20E0, level
2, also indicate a small McCurtain phase occupation
there. Needless to say, the southeastern rise still warrants test excavations should the site be threatened by
development activities that could adversely impact
the archeological deposits.
41RR102
The site is on the crest of an alluvial landform
that parallels the Big Pine Creek floodplain as
well as a slough of the creek; the slough marks
an older channel of Red River. Currently in pasture, a few pieces of lithic debris were visible in
gopher mounds on the site. Four positive shovel
tests located low densities of subsurface cultural
materials (only a maximum of 28 cm in depth)
over ca. 7500 m2, with lithic debris, plain grog- and
shell-tempered sherds, and daub represented in the
small assemblage (n=21). A local collector reported
to the TAS survey crew that most of his ceramic
sherd collection came from site 41RR102.
Hyatt and Mosca (1972) characterized the site
as only a ca. 290 m2 scatter of lithic debris and tools
in an eroded area on a rise. However, the materials
they collected from the site also included a small
amount (n=4) of both grog- and shell-tempered
pottery. The single projectile point recovered was
a Gary type of Ouachita Mountains chert. Also in

Perttula—Survey of the Roitsch Farm and Adjoining Lands, 1991–1992 203
the collection were a biface preform, one bifacial
tool fragment, and seven edge-modified flake tools
(43 percent of Ouachita Mountains chert).
No midden deposits or areas of artifact concentration were identified in the limited TAS investigations at the site. Plowing of the shallow deposits
has presumably affected its subsurface integrity,
and in combination with its multi-component nature
(Woodland, and Early and Late Caddo occupations),
this suggests that it would be difficult to accurately
separate cultural deposits within the site, unless
the components are horizontally discrete. It would
be worthwhile, however, to document the cultural
materials in local collections from the site as they
apparently consist of large samples of prehistoric
Caddo ceramics.

41RR103
This large (7 acres) prehistoric site is in a
pasture about 100 m from Big Pine Creek. The

Figure 30. Site map of 41RR103.

landform is a prominent alluvial terrace that sits
approximately 6 m above the floodplain (Figure
30). The sandy loam A-horizon soils at the site vary
from 20-60 cm in depth over B-horizon clays, and
the A-horizon contains moderate densities of lithic
debris, cores, bifacial tool fragments, fire-cracked
rocks, one Gary point (Figure 31f) and one Marcos
dart (Figure 31b).
All nine shovel tests excavated at 41RR103
by the TAS contained cultural materials. Shovel
tests #3-#5 had the highest densities (between
7-28 artifacts/shovel test, or ca. 80-300 artifacts
per m3). The two dart points (a Gary, var. LeFlore
and a corner-notched Marcos) were found on the
surface in a cattle trail along the northern edge of
the terrace (see Figure 30).
When SMU recorded it, 41RR103 was thought
to cover about 500 m2 on a “ridge” south of Big
Pine Creek. Only a few pieces of fire-cracked
rock and lithic debris of local cherts and Ouachita
Mountains quartzitic sandstone were collected or
noted from the site (see Table 3).

Site 41RR103 appears to have been occupied
principally during the Late Archaic period (and/
or the early part of the Woodland period), and
at least one concentration of subsurface cultural
materials was documented on the eastern part of
the terrace that appears to be relatively intact. In
general, Archaic hunter-gatherer sites in Northeast
Texas (as well as in the Red River valley) have not
been thoroughly investigated, and much about the
archeology of the period is not well understood
(Fields and Tomka 1993). Since there are intact
deposits at the site, it has the potential to contribute
useful archeological information on the nature of
Archaic (Late Archaic) lifeways, and thus warrants
future archeological attention.
41RR105
This site is located in a distinctive setting within the Big Pine Creek valley: on a small knoll (1000
m2) on a low, narrow, alluvial terrace between two
channels of Big Pine Creek. The channel areas are
forested, but the terrace itself is in pasture.
Terrace soils are uniformly Desha clay, a Late

Holocene Red River alluvial deposit (Thomas
1977), except on the knoll itself where the soil is
comprised of a orange-brown clay loam more than
80 cm in depth. Of the six shovel tests placed on
and around the knoll, only Shovel Test #2 contained artifacts and clay loam soils; recovered were
three Late Caddo period McCurtain phase shelltempered sherds and two pieces of lithic debris
between 30-40 cm bs (Figure 32).
SMU’s investigations documented that the site
was about 600 m2 in size. It was situated on what
they described as an older alluvial terrace, some 60
m from the bridge crossing Big Pine Creek. A small
assemblage (principally ceramic sherds) collected
from the site (see Table 3) suggests that both Middle Caddo and Late Caddo occupations occurred
on the site; the 10 Late Caddo shell-tempered body
sherds are plain, but the possible Middle Caddo
sample of grog and bone-tempered pottery includes
two with red slips (probably Sanders Plain [Brown
1971, 1996; Suhm and Jelks 1962]), and two decorated with parallel incised lines. Daub was also
present on the site. There were also a small blade
core fragment, two pieces of fire-cracked rock, 16

Perttula—Survey of the Roitsch Farm and Adjoining Lands, 1991–1992 205

Figure 32. Site Map of 41RR105.

lithic debris (88 percent local cherts and quartzite),
an edge-modified flake tool, and a bifacial tool
fragment of Big Fork chert.
The small size of the site, and the recovery of
daub and primarily shell-tempered Late Caddo ceramics, suggests that 41RR105 mainly represents a
single McCurtain phase farmstead; salt-processing
sites of the same age, and in the same area, typically contain large quantities of sherds (especially
from Nash Neck Banded jars) and daub (see Kenmotsu 2006). The low density of cultural materials
may also be indicative of the site’s being occupied
by Caddo peoples for only a short period of time.
Limited investigations recovered no evidence that
a midden or cultural features are preserved at the
site, but its compact nature and short-term occupation could provide a unique set of data on the character and diversity of McCurtain phase habitation
sites away from the Roitsch site village.
41RR106
This site is on an alluvial terrace facing the Big
Pine Creek floodplain; Big Pine Creek is 300 m
away, but seep springs are present along the slopes
of the terrace. The terrace itself has a number of
small “pimple” mounds, two of which upon being

shovel tested were found to contain high densities
of cultural materials between 20-80+ cm in depth.
I estimate the site size as 2500 m2 (Figure 33).
Both positive shovel tests contained plain pottery body sherds, with one rim, and with most of
the pottery (n=35) coming from more than 35 cm
bs. Lithic artifacts included pieces of lithic debris,
fire-cracked rock, and a dart point. Shovel Test #1
also had considerable amounts of charcoal along
with a piece of bone, suggesting that a feature or
midden deposit may be preserved on one of the
“pimple” mounds. A Kent dart point was recovered
at 40 cm bs in Shovel Test #2.
In 1972, cultural materials at 41RR106 were
recovered by Hyatt and Mosca (1972) on the top of
the terrace. This included small amounts of lithic
debris and fire-cracked rock, a sandstone grinding
stone fragment, and plain grog (n=3) and shelltempered (n=2) pottery (see Table 3).
The artifacts found during the 1972 and 1991
investigations at 41RR106 suggest that both
Woodland and Caddo period components are present;
the grog-tempered pottery may be Woodland in age,
or be associated with a Formative to Middle Caddo
occupation. The Woodland occupation (the Kent
point and perhaps the ceramics found below 40 cm
bs) may also be buried in the terrace sediments.

206

Texas Archeological Society

Figure 33. Site 41RR106 Plan map.

The preservation of charcoal and bone in the lower
deposits suggests these remains may pertain to the
Woodland occupation (or be preserved in pit features),
which would be of considerable significance given
the general dearth of Woodland sites in Northeast
Texas with preserved plant and animal remains (e.g.,
Perttula et al. 1993). Given the above, site 41RR106
warrants further test level investigations to fully
assess its research potential.
41RR107
Site 41RR107 was located on an alluvial ridge
200 m south of Big Pine Creek, and 250 m southsoutheast of the confluence of Big Pine Creek with
Salt Well Slough. It overlooks, but is 6 m above,
the Red River floodplain, with the current river
channel about 0.8 km to the north.
The site covers about 2800 m2 of the crest of
the dissected terrace. Lithic debris and fire-cracked
rock was visible on the surface in eroded areas

along the edge of the ridge, along with a expedient
flake tool of Red River gravel chert, and two of
three shovel tests had sparse amounts of lithic
debris (n=3) and fire-cracked rock (n=1) between
10-40 cm bs. Soils belong to the Annona-Freestone
complex, but they are shallower than described
(Thomas 1977:7-8) because of site erosion.
According to SMU, 41RR107 covered only a
200 m2 area atop a small knoll of the alluvial terrace;
the slough ran below the site. Artifacts collected from
the site include a Late Archaic Palmillas dart point
(Ouachita Mountains chert), a bifacial tool fragment
of a banded red chert, and a few pieces of lithic debris
and fire-cracked rock (see Table 3).
This site contains minimal archeological deposits, apparently of Late Archaic age based on
the one recovered dart point (cf. Story 1990:Figure
32). The deposits appear to possess limited integrity, and we conclude that they have low potential for
addressing important Red River regional research
problems and issues.

controlled surface collection completed during
the survey, although a sparse scatter of probable
Archaic period lithic debris, ground stone tools
(pitted stone and mano), fire-cracked rock, and
chipped stone tool fragments (including a preform
to a dart projectile point of claystone-siltstone) was
present near the crest of the rise (Figure 34a).
The principal historic archeological assemblage from 41RR109 contained refined earthenwares (shell-edged, hand-painted, flown blue,
Figure 35j), stonewares (lead-glazed, salt-glazed,
and alkaline-glazed), bottle glass (11 aqua and
11 dark olive green body sherds, 1 aqua-colored
hand-applied lip), square nails, porcelain buttons,
a stoneware pipe sherd (Figure 36a), and other
metal artifacts (mostly unidentifiable to function),
but including a metal utensil, tools, and a cooking
pan fragment of cast iron from a pre-1880 occupation. One whiteware maker’s mark reads “...
WTHOR..” and has an English Royal Arms (dating after 1837). Later 19th and early 20th century
artifacts include much of the bottle glass, including ornamental tableware, and plain whiteware
sherds.

From the SMU work in 1972, this site appeared
to be a McCurtain phase farmstead. It was situated
on a small rise, covering ca. 1035 m2, overlooking
the confluence of Big Pine Creek and Salt Well
Slough. Their field notes describe the soil as thick
and dark in color, possibly because of a midden,
and “there was a good deal of pottery.” The cultural
materials collected by SMU indicated that there
were 43 plain shell-tempered body sherds and 15
pieces of wattle-impressed daub. The presence of
daub probably is good evidence that a prehistoric
Caddo structure is (or was) preserved at the site,
possibly along with other features.
The 1992 TAS investigations documented that
site 41RR109 is much larger in size than SMU
suggested, about 20,000 m2, and also that it has an
extensive late 19th century archeological deposit.
Due to the extremely wet conditions at the time of
the survey, and the intractable clay soils, no shovel
tests were attempted at the site.
Curiously, no Late Caddo McCurtain phase
archeological materials were identified in a

Although the site area has been plowed for
many years, the prehistoric and historic materials
are probably intact. This material from 41RR109
probably is from one of the historic farmsteads dispersed along tributaries of Red River during much
of the 19th and early 20th centuries, but with a
substantial mid- to late-19th century occupation.
41RR110
When the site was recorded in 1972, it was
estimated to cover ca. 650 m2 on a high knoll
some 50 m from Big Pine Creek. Although the
SMU investigators noted no midden deposits at
41RR110, they collected a moderate assortment
of Caddo lithics and ceramics (Hyatt and Mosca
1972). In the surface collection assemblage was an
arrow point preform of a local heat-treated chert,
lithic debris and a few utilized edge-modified
pieces of local cherts and quartzites, and shelland grog/grit-tempered pottery. Based on the
limited number of decorated ceramics (one grog/
grit-tempered sherd with a red slip and one shelltempered piece with parallel punctations [Emory
Punctated-Incised]) among the 18 sherds collected
by SMU, the site appears to have both Middle and
Late Caddo components.

Both the 1991 and 1992 TAS survey crews
reexamined the site. It is in a pasture with poor
surface visibility but the extent of the site was determined to be about 12,500 m2. Three shovel tests
were placed across the knoll, and a high density of
ceramics (n=12), daub (n=9), bone, and charcoal
(n=14) was recovered from each of the tests (but

Perttula—Survey of the Roitsch Farm and Adjoining Lands, 1991–1992 209
particularly in Shovel Test #2) between ca. 10-80
cm bs (Figure 37), as well as lithic debris and firecracked rock. The frequency of these types of artifacts strongly suggest that Caddo period structures
and/or middens are likely to be preserved at the
site. Both Early-Middle and Late Caddo ceramics
were found in the TAS investigations.
The 1992 crew excavated a single shovel test
near the crest of the knoll, and recovered lithic
debris, charcoal fragments, and three plain sherds
(two were shell-tempered) between 40-60 cm bs.
The shovel test furthered verified that intact Caddo
archeological deposits of some depth are preserved
at 41RR110.
Site 41RR110 clearly appears to have research
significance. A variety of research problems concerning the lifeways of Caddo peoples in the Mound
Prairie area can be investigated from an examination
of the site’s archeological deposits (e.g., Bruseth
et al. 1991, 1992; Perttula 1993; Perttula, ed., this

surface contexts suggests that features or midden
deposits may be well preserved at the site, and that
radiocarbon dates of the Caddo component(s) can be
secured. This site warrants additional investigations
as well as long-term preservation.
41RR111
Site 41RR111 was found by the SMU survey
team on a “high knoll” only about 25 m south of
41RR110. Only apparently ca. 500 m2 in size, both
lithic and ceramic artifacts were collected from the
surface of the site (see Table 3). Our inspection of
those materials, principally the 10 shell-tempered
rim and body sherds (including two with exterior red
slips and another with an appliqued design on the
exterior surface) suggests that an early McCurtain
phase occupation occurred at the site. There were
also two grog-bone-tempered body sherds with interior and exterior red slipping as well as three plain
grog-tempered body sherds. These sherds belong

with an earlier, pre-A.D. 1300 Caddo occupation at
41RR111 (e.g., Perttula 1997a, 1997b).
In 1991, the TAS survey crew noted prehistoric
ceramics, ground stone tools, and lithic debris on
the surface of the knoll (although no artifacts were
collected), and the site appeared to be intact. No
shovel tests were excavated at 41RR111 during the
1991 season.
This site was also relocated by a TAS survey
crew in 1992, although only a limited surface
reconnaissance was done and one shovel test
excavated there because of the wet and muddy
conditions. No archeological materials were visible
on the surface of the knoll, which overlooks the
floodplain of Big Pine Creek, while the shovel test
recovered one piece of fire-cracked rock and three
charcoal pieces between 70-80 cm bs.
Due to the very limited work completed at
41RR111 by the TAS, and the evidence for a Late
Caddo occupation suggested by the SMU investigations, the site should be revisited and systematically
shovel tested should it become threatened by farming
operations or other development activities. Most of
the Late Caddo sites known in the Mound Prairie area
are restricted to the Red River alluvial floodplain, or
are along an old Red River channel, so further work at
a Late Caddo settlement some km up Big Pine Creek
would promise to contribute useful information on
the overall character of the settlement system around
the Roitsch site village at that time.
41RR112
Site 41RR112 is located on the tip of a narrow
alluvial ridge between two intermittent tributaries
of Big Pine Creek. The creek is about 120 m to the
north of the site.
Covering about 800-1000 m2, 41RR112 has been
disturbed by an old road that had cut through the
approximate center of the ridge. This has exposed
prehistoric artifacts along the roadbed slopes, and
artifact collectors have been actively scouring the
surface and erosional cuts for projectile points. In a
surface collection secured from the site by the TAS,
four (three Gary and one unidentified expanding
stem) dart projectile points were recovered, as well as
47 lithic debris, two bifacial tool fragments, and one
piece of fauna. The projectile points are indicative of
Late Archaic and Woodland use of the ridge.
Three shovel tests were excavated along the
ridge to ascertain whether intact archeological
deposits were present at 41RR112. Only two pieces

of lithic debris were recovered from 0-10 cm in one
of the shovel tests (ST #2), and the shovel testing
documented that the archeological deposits are
shallow and eroded.
A small collection of artifacts were obtained in
1972 by the SMU crew in a 90 m2 area of the site
apparently subject to more considerable erosion
(see Table 3). Fire-cracked rock, lithic debris, and
three grog/bone-tempered pottery sherds from one
vessel (with possible interior red slip) were found
at 41RR112, probably from a Formative to Middle
Caddo occupation of the ridge.
Taken together, the SMU and TAS investigations at 41RR112 document a periodic Late Archaic, Woodland, and possibly a Formative to Middle
Caddo use of the site. However, due to disturbances
from road construction, the activities of artifact
collectors, and erosion, there is little potential for
intact archeological deposits to be preserved at the
site. No further work is warranted at 41RR112.
41RR119
According to SMU field notes from the Big
Pine Creek Reservoir project, this is a 2070 m2
surface scatter of lithic and ceramic artifacts at the
west end of a long ridge next to Big Pine Creek.
The collection we examined from 41RR119, however, contained only a small assortment of firecracked rock and lithic debris of local chert and
quartzite (see Table 3). Also in the collection was
one edge-modified flake tool of red chert.
Investigations in 1991 by the TAS showed that
site 41RR119 covers a much larger area than previously thought, about 19,800 m2 of the alluvial ridge
and that it also has a late 19th-mid-20th century component. The channel of Big Pine Creek is 100 m east
of the site. The landform is dissected by several large
gulleys, and these served as convenient depressions
for the dumping of historic artifacts and trash.
Historic and prehistoric archeological materials
were widely dispersed in surface contexts across the
landform. The historic artifacts were most common
at the west end of the site (in the vicinity of a structure and barn as depicted on the 1951 USGS 7.5’
quadrangle map) and the prehistoric artifacts were
restricted primarily to the eastern half of the site. No
shovel tests were excavated at the site, unfortunately,
to ascertain whether either intact prehistoric or historic archeological deposits remain preserved.
A small collection of prehistoric and historic
artifacts were recovered from 41RR119 through a

Perttula—Survey of the Roitsch Farm and Adjoining Lands, 1991–1992 211
systematic surface collection. The prehistoric remains
(n=32) include two plain shell- and grog-tempered
sherds, four pieces of daub, two dart points (a Yarbrough and the stem of a Gary point; see Figure 34i),
two bifacial tool fragments of novaculite, five cores,
12 lithic debris, one ground stone tool (a possible
mano), and five fire-cracked rocks, probably from
Late Archaic and Woodland period occupations of
the site. The shell-tempered sherds are indicative of
a Late Caddo, McCurtain phase component.
The late 19th-mid-20th century occupation at
41RR119 is represented by 11 machine-made brick
fragments, one possible post-1890 wire nail, four
pieces of whiteware (including one with a brown
transfer-printed decoration; see Figure 35a), two
stoneware sherds, one clear tableware glass sherd,
and 21 pieces of bottle glass and milk glass. A
cursory reexamination of the site in 1992 by the
TAS recovered an expanding stem Archaic dart
projectile point (see Figure 34g) in an eroded area
at the eastern end of the ridge.
The prehistoric component of site 41RR119
warrants further attention, principally to establish
whether the site contains intact and interpretable
archeological deposits of either Late Archaic or
Woodland age, and has any potential to contain cultural features. A program of shovel testing should
be completed in the future in the eastern portion
of the site, where prehistoric artifacts are common
in surface contexts, should activities be proposed
that could damage possibly important Late Archaic
and/or Woodland archeological deposits.
41RR129
Only a small (10 m in diameter) scatter of
lithic debris and fire-cracked rock on a knoll near
Big Pine Creek was recorded by SMU during their
site identification efforts (Hyatt and Mosca 1972).
Collections from the site are consistent with this
description: three fire-cracked rock, three pieces
of lithic debris, and a core of Ouachita Mountains
chert (see Table 3).
During the 1991 TAS survey investigations,
we relocated the site through shovel testing. It
covers ca. 1300 m2 of an alluvial terrace with two
pimple mounds. Both of the pimple mounds contain prehistoric artifacts, principally lithic debris
and daub, in archeological deposits at least 30
cm in thickness. Due to heavy rains and saturated
soils, the shovel tests were only excavated to 30
cm bs. Of the two shovel tests, Shovel Test #2 (on

the northern pimple mound at the site) contained
a high density of lithic debris (n=10) and daub
(n=27), along with pieces of charcoal; only one
lithic debris and a bifacial preform fragment were
recovered from Shovel Test #1. A small surface
collection of prehistoric artifacts (one arrow point
preform fragment, one lithic debris, one ground
stone tool, and a biface) was obtained from gopher
mounds dispersed across the site. The prehistoric
artifacts from site 41RR129 are for the most part
temporally undiagnostic, although the arrow point
preform denotes a post-A.D. 800 Caddo use of
the landform. The lack of ceramics in the small
collection, however, hints that the principal use
of the site probably took place prior to ca. 2000
years B.P. (about the time of the advent of ceramics along the Red River in Northeast Texas [Story
1990]).
Further shovel testing should be conducted at
41RR129 to better define the horizontal and vertical
extent of the archeological deposits. The results of
the shovel testing should be informative about the
site’s contextual integrity, and may provide useful
data about the archeological contents of the deposit.
41RR201
Site 41RR201 is on a small rise (ca. 1000 m2),
probably part of a dissected alluvial terrace, overlooking the floodplain of Salt Well Slough; the slough
is 50 m east of the site. The Salt Well Slough site
(41RR204), and other salt-making sites, are just to
the south of 41RR201 along Salt Well Slough (see
Kenmotsu 2006). It is in a pasture area with good
surface visibility (20 percent on average).
A light scatter (ca. 1 artifact per 10 m2) of thin
shell-tempered ceramics and burned clay is present
on the surface of the site, and a small surface collection (29 plain sherds and two pieces of burned
clay) was obtained during the site recordation
process; the density of artifacts strongly contrasts
with the high amounts of ceramics and daub noted
at the nearby salt making sites (see Kenmotsu
2006). No shovel testing was conducted at the site,
but it is likely that the archeological materials at
41RR201 are from a Late Caddo period farmstead.
Thus, if through future shovel testing, subsurface
deposits were shown to be intact, the site would
then have excellent potential to contain important
information about the character of the Late Caddo
McCurtain phase farmsteads dispersed around the
Late Caddo Roitsch village.

212

Texas Archeological Society
41RR202

Site 41RR202 is much like 41RR201 in that it
contains a small (ca. 800 m2) concentration of principally plain shell-tempered sherds dispersed across the
surface of a natural rise on an alluvial terrace of the
Red River; Salt Well Slough is about 50 m east of the
site, and the current channel of the Red River is 800
m to the east. Some 30 plain shell-tempered sherds
were collected from a general surface collection of
the site, along with a red-slipped Avery Engraved
body sherd (Figure 38b). No shovel tests were conducted at 41RR202; if the site is to be threatened in
the near future, a program of shovel testing should be
implemented to assess the subsurface integrity of any
preserved archeological deposits.
Based on the available evidence, the site is also
interpreted as a Late Caddo McCurtain phase farmstead, and perhaps it was occupied by Caddo peoples that produced salt at the Salt Well Slough salt
making site. It was also used during the early part
of Late Archaic times, as a large straight-stemmed
dart point of Red River gravel chert resembling
a Bulverde (see Figure 34j) was recovered in the
surface collection from 41RR202.
41RR203
This appears to be an Archaic period site
located on a topographic high overlooking the
confluence of Pond Creek and Salt Well Slough;
Pond Creek is about 100 m from 41RR203. TAS
investigations at this site were limited to a cursory
reconnaissance of the landform, and only lithic
debris and fire-cracked rock were noted to be thinly
scattered on the surface over a 20,000 m2 area; no
temporally diagnostic artifacts were recovered or
observed from 41RR203, however.
The presence of probable Archaic archeological
deposits along Salt Well Slough is intriguing, amidst
the relatively dense cluster of Late Caddo habitation
sites and salt making locations, but additional investigations are needed to determine if preserved subsurface archeological deposits are present at 41RR203.
A program of shovel testing is warranted to assess
the archeological character of the component(s), and
to acquire artifacts that will aid in determining the
period(s) of prehistoric occupation at the site.
41RR204, Salt Well Slough Site
The Salt Well Slough site is a Late Caddo McCurtain phase salt-making loci. It is situated on a

gently sloping rise on the edge of an alluvial terrace
dissected by Salt Well Slough and Pond Creek. From
surface indications in a plowed field during a 1991
reconnaissance, the site had an extremely dense
concentration of plain and decorated shell-tempered
sherds and daub/burned clay, and appeared to have
great potential to contain intact archeological deposits and features relating to the Caddo manufacture
of salt. The site was selected for intensive investigations during the 1991 field season of the Texas Archeological Society Field School (Kenmotsu 2006;
see also Perttula et al. 2001).
41RR205
This is a multi-component prehistoric and
historic site that covers about 6400 m2 on the edge
of an alluvial terrace of the Red River. It is on
farmlands of the Fasken Farm, and a short distance
northwest of the Fasken site.
The terrace had been recently plowed, exposing
a dense concentration of mid- to late 19th century
artifacts (including bottle glass, whitewares, stonewares, and an occasional brick or metal fragment)
and a sparse scatter of prehistoric lithics across the
site. The soil at the site, a sandy loam, is distinctly
darker than the surrounding soil, suggesting that an
historic sheet or yard trash midden is preserved at
41RR205; no shovel testing was conducted during
our cursory reconnaissance to verify the presence
of a midden deposit.
A selective surface collection of artifacts was
recovered from the site, principally to characterize the age of the historic occupation as well as to
document the presence of a prehistoric component.
Among the collected historic artifacts (n=165) are
shell-edged, transfer-printed, and hand-painted whitewares (see Figure 35f); slip-banded yellow wares;
alkaline glaze, salt glaze, and natural clay slipped
stonewares; a stoneware pipe bowl (see Figure 36b);
and a few sherds of hand-molded bottle glass with
applied lips. A whiteware maker’s mark reading “...
ANL... ENGLA...” is from a J & G Meakin Ltd. vessel made between ca. 1890-1907 (Kovel and Kovel
1986). With the exception of the maker’s mark, a few
Bristol-glazed stonewares, a relief-molded whiteware
rim (see Figure 35k), one machine-made brick fragment, and clear, purple, blue, and milk glass, these
artifacts are generally consistent with an antebellum
historic occupation; the latter artifacts recovered from
41RR205 suggest that the occupation, probably a
farmstead, may have extended to about 1900.

Perttula—Survey of the Roitsch Farm and Adjoining Lands, 1991–1992 213
The prehistoric component at 41RR205 is
not temporally diagnostic: only a single piece of
lithic debris, a bipolar core fragment, and one
bifacial preform fragment were recovered in the
surface collection. What is notable is the complete
absence of aboriginal ceramics, which occur in
quantity on most prehistoric archeological sites
along Holocene alluvial terraces of the Red River;
indeed, other prehistoric sites in proximity to
41RR205 along this stretch of alluvial terrace have
significant quantities of ceramic artifacts from
Caddo occupations (see 41RR206 and 41RR209),
as does the nearby Fasken site (see Prikryl,
this volume). This suggests that the prehistoric
component at 41RR205 is more than 2000 years
old, as prehistoric ceramics commonly occur on
Red River sites dating only after that time (cf.
Schambach 1982; Story 1990).
The site has considerable potential to contribute important information on the lifeways of relatively early Anglo- or African-American settlers
of the Mound Prairie area of Red River County.
This area was settled in the 1820s (Steely 1982),
so the occupation at 41RR205 may represent a
farmstead of a second generation settler of the
region. To obtain useful archeological information
on the site, a program of shovel testing should be
conducted at 41RR205 to better clarify the contextual integrity of the 19th century occupation,
and also to establish if features (i.e., sheet middens, wells, privies, and house foundations) from
the occupation are present, and if they are well
preserved. To learn more about the occupants of
the site (such as their ethnic heritage, occupation,
and economic status), land deed and title research
should also be carried out.
41RR206
Site 41RR206 was discovered in a plowed
soybean field on a natural rise along the edge of
an alluvial terrace of the Red River. Based on
the surface distribution of prehistoric artifacts in
the plowed field, the site covers ca. 5000 m2. The
darkened soil on the rise suggests that a prehistoric
midden deposit is preserved at the site, but no
shovel tests were excavated to ascertain its condition, content, or possible thickness.
A large quantity (n=119) of prehistoric lithic
and ceramic artifacts were selectively collected
from the surface of the plowed field (this includes
three pieces of Red River chert lithic debris from

the 1993 Northeast Texas Archeological Society
survey effort [see below]), including plain and
decorated grog-tempered Caddo ceramics (n=64),
lithic debris, cores, bifaces, a Gary dart point, a
celt, and the mid-section of an arrow point; a few
fire-cracked rocks and daub were also collected.
The majority of the prehistoric artifacts appear to
be from an earlier Caddo component (i.e., predating A.D. 1300), perhaps contemporaneous with the
occupation at the Fasken civic-ceremonial center
(41RR14, see Prikryl, this volume). This prehistoric mound center and village is less than 1 km
to the southeast of 41RR206. The Gary point may
be associated with the Caddo component, but it is
more likely to relate to the limited use of the site
during Late Archaic/Woodland times.
It is possible that 41RR206 represents an
outlying settlement that was directly associated
with the occupation and use of the Fasken civicceremonial center, though further investigations
will obviously be needed to determine when it
was actually occupied. The nature and abundance
of the material remains from the site, and the likelihood that a midden is preserved there, suggests
that the Caddo occupation was intensive, and
probably marked by house structures, features,
and trash deposits. This Caddo site clearly warrants further investigations as well as protection
efforts, because of its potential to contain significant information on Caddo prehistory.
The Northeast Texas Archeological Society
visited the site during their reconnaissance of
the Wright and Tarrant Farms in February 1993
(see Nelson, Turner, and Perttula, below). In their
survey, they documented that site 41RR206 was
also occupied in the late 19th-early 20th century,
probably by tenant farmers. Included among the
artifacts collected on the site revisit are one plain
whiteware sherd, another whiteware sherd (from a
brimmed plate) with a black hand-painted (overglaze) decoration, one porcelain button (4-hole),
and two ironstone sherds with maker’s marks, one
of which (Standard Pottery Co. of East Liverpool,
Ohio) dates between ca. 1910-1927. The other has
a “VITREOUS” mark that dates after ca. 1901
(Kovel and Kovel 1986).
41RR207
Located in the same plowed soybean field as
41RR205 and 41RR206, site 41RR207 appears to
be the remains of one of the tenant farms or farm-

214

Texas Archeological Society

steads that once lined the Kiomatia-Jonesborough
road between ca. 1880-1930. Covering about 2000
m2 of the alluvial terrace, the site contains a range
of domestic refuse strewn across the surface, including: bottle glass, wire nails, farm implements,
bricks, and ceramics (whiteware and stoneware).
No features were apparent at 41RR207 in the
cursory reconnaissance completed by TAS at the
site, but foundation remnants, privies, and yard
sheet trash may be present. No shovel tests were
excavated to characterize the subsurface character
of the archeological deposit. A small collection
of stonewares (n=2), post-1875 lead-glazed and
salt-glazed/lead-glazed, was recovered from the
site to help characterize the temporal range of the
occupation, along with a whiteware maker’s mark,
“THOMPSON & ...”. The mark may be from the
C.C. Thompson Pottery Co. (1868-1938) (Kovel
and Kovel 1986).
Archival investigations may be warranted at
some future date for 41RR207 as part of developing a better understanding of the historical and
archeological parameters of the tenant farming system in the Mound Prairie area of Northeast Texas.
The limited information obtained from the survey
reconnaissance of this site does not strongly suggest that it has much potential to address relevant
archeological research problems for the period,
but undoubtedly there are other better preserved
sites that possess such research value. Limited
test excavations could be conducted at these sites
in the context of a well-developed research design
concerning late 19th century Anglo-American or
African-American tenant farmers.
41RR208
Like 41RR207, this site appears to represent
the archeological remnants of a tenant farm, one of
many such farms scattered along FM 410 between
Kiomatia, Wright Plantation, and Jonesborough
(later known as Davenport). Site 41RR208 is marked
by a fairly dense (ca. 5 artifacts per 10 m2) surface
scatter of historic ceramics, bottle glass, post-1890
wire nails, and machine-made brick fragments
covering about 1600 m2, along with a darker soil
stain that may be indicative of sheet or yard trash
midden deposits; no foundation or privy features
were noted in the TAS survey reconnaissance and
no shovel tests were excavated at the site.
Based on observations of the kinds of historic
artifacts present at 41RR208, it was occupied in the

early 20th century (ca. 1900-1940). Present were
such artifacts as post-1903 machine-made bottles,
fiesta ware ceramics, Bristol-glazed stoneware, and
wire nails. The house that stood at the site must
have been abandoned some years before 1949, as
no structure is shown at this location on the Kiomatia 7.5’ USGS topographic map dating to that year.
Because of the relatively recent age of the site, and
its relatively commonplace archeological record
(i.e., there are thousands of similar sites across
Northeast Texas), we offer no further archeological
recommendations for site 41RR208.
41RR209
Site 41RR209 is a small prehistoric Caddo
archeological deposit located on the edge of an
alluvial terrace of the Red River, not far from the
Fasken mound site; the terrace had been plowed for
soybeans shortly before the onset of the 1991 TAS
survey efforts. The current channel of the river is
1.5 km to the west of the site, but probably flowed
closer to it during prehistoric times.
The site is marked by a low density (ca. 1
prehistoric artifact per 25 m2) surface scatter of ceramics, lithic debris, burned clay/daub, fire-cracked
rock, and chipped and ground stone tool fragments;
no obvious surface concentrations of artifacts were
noted across the 1600 m2 site area. The rise the site
is situated on has been darkly stained, probably
from a midden deposit, although no shovel tests
were excavated at 41RR209 to confirm the presence of any midden areas. A surface collection of
prehistoric ceramics (n=36), lithic debris (n=9),
fire-cracked rock (n=3), and a greenstone (siliceous
shale) celt fragment were retrieved during the surface inspection of the site. The plain and decorated
grog-tempered ceramics found at the site denote
a Caddo occupation between ca. A.D. 900 and
A.D. 1300; it is impossible to be more temporally
specific because of the small number of decorated
ceramics in the collection.
The possible midden staining, in conjunction
with the prehistoric domestic refuse, suggests
that site 41RR209 probably represents a small
farmstead or homestead of Red River Caddo
peoples. Given its proximity to the Fasken civicceremonial center, it may also plausibly be part of
the population that built and used this important
regional Caddo civic-ceremonial center between
the 11th and 13th centuries (see Prikryl, this
volume). Whether this is the case or not, this

site does appear to have the potential to contain
significant archeological data on the Caddo
settlement of the Mound Prairie area in Northeast
Texas. A program of shovel testing should be
conducted at the site to determine the contextual
integrity and character of its subsurface archeological deposits, and then assess its likelihood to
contain cultural features.
41RR210
This multi-component prehistoric and historic
site is along an intermittent tributary of Little Pine
Creek, about 1.5 km or so south of the southwest
corner of the Roitsch Farm survey area (see Figure
1). The community of Manchester is 1.2 km to
the north of 41RR210. FM 2118 has cut through
the site, disturbing and mixing the prehistoric and
historic components, but the possibility exists that
in situ deposits are present in the 2000 m2 portion
of the site across FM 2118 to the south.
The site has been plowed, and prehistoric
Caddo ceramics and lithic debris were noted

(although none were collected) on the surface
along with 20th century plain whiteware and
Bristol-glazed stoneware ceramics and clear
bottle glass. The historic artifacts are probably
from a house site that had been razed and
removed, while the small Caddo occupation
may be a farmstead. The grog-tempered Caddo
ceramics from 41RR210 indicate that the site was
settled prior to ca. A.D. 1300.
If the site is threatened by further road construction along FM 2118, a program of shovel
testing should be conducted at 41RR210 to ascertain if it has the potential to contain significant subsurface archeological deposits. As most
of the Caddo sites recorded and investigated in
the Mound Prairie area are located along the
Red River, one of its alluvial terraces, or along
a main tributary of the river, further examination
of a Caddo site such as 41RR210 may acquire
significant archeological information on the early
Caddo use of small tributaries and prairie/woodland habitats away from the modern Red River
alluvial floodplain.

216

known in an archeological sense in the Middle
Red River valley (cf. Perttula et al. 1993). Test
excavations at 41RR210 would be profitable as
part of research efforts aimed at learning more
about the development of prehistoric sedentary life
in Northeast Texas, as well as the functional and
technological character of Woodland period material culture assemblages. Learning more about the
use of the site during the Late Caddo period may
provide important information on the character
of settlement by Late Caddo farmers along a Red
River tributary in the Mound Prairie area.

Site 41RR211 occupies a long, narrow alluvial
ridge between two intermittent tributaries of Big
Pine Creek; the site area is estimated at 25,000
m2 (Figure 39). The site is currently in a heavily
grazed cow pasture, although it has been plowed
in the past, and lithic debris is observed in rodent
mounds and eroded areas across the ridge.
A program of shovel testing was conducted at
41RR211, and seven of 10 shovel tests excavated
along the ridge contained prehistoric lithic and
ceramic artifacts in moderate densities (mean=15.7
artifacts/shovel test or ca. 170 artifacts per m3). The
41RR212
artifacts occur to about 80 cm bs in sandy loam deThis site includes a low density scatter of
posits of the Annona-Freestone complex (Thomas
prehistoric ceramics and lithics eroding out along
1977); areas with shallow sandy loam soils over a
the margins of a small pimple mound. The pimple
clay B-horizon typically lack subsurface archeomound, about 1200 m2 in size, is on a linear allulogical deposits at the site. The shovel testing did
vial ridge that has been dissected by erosion, and
not identify midden deposits at 41RR211. The
there are small intermittent drainages of Big Pine
highest densities of subsurface artifacts were found
in the southeast quarter of the site (see
Figure 39) in Shovel Tests #1, #3,
#6, and #7. This is also the same area
where plain prehistoric ceramics were
found in the shovel testing.
A surface collection of prehistoric
artifacts from eroded areas of the site
recovered 45 items. This includes
lithic debris (n=42), cores (n=2), and
one fire-cracked rock. Similar kinds
of prehistoric materials were found
in the shovel tests at 41RR211, along
with daub (n=14), plain grog-tempered
sherds (n=3), three shell-tempered
sherds (from Shovel Test #7), a straightstemmed dart point, one mano, and a
quartzite bifacial preform fragment.
With the exception of the Late Caddo
shell-tempered sherds, the assemblage
of prehistoric lithic and ceramic artifacts is most consistent with a Woodland period occupation of the site.
This site certainly warrants further
consideration on a number of grounds.
First, it contains well-preserved and intact prehistoric archeological deposits,
and thus it should receive long-term

41RR213
This site is located in a similar setting as
41RR212, namely on a small pimple mound along
a linear and eroded alluvial ridge that has been dissected by several intermittent drainages of Big Pine
Creek. A low scatter of prehistoric lithic debris
covers about 4000 m2 of the pimple mound and
alluvial ridge.
Shovel tests on the pimple mound failed to
identify subsurface archeological deposits, and the
soil consists of only 15-25 cm of sandy loam over a
red B-horizon clay. A surface collection of the site
area recovered only three pieces of lithic debris and
one unifacially retouched tool from a temporally
unknown prehistoric occupation, a piece of bone

This site appears to contain an intact Woodland period component on a small alluvial knoll
(1800 m2) overlooking an intermittent drainage
and the floodplain of Big Pine Creek. A small scatter of prehistoric lithic and ceramic artifacts were
noted on the surface of the knoll, but shovel tests
placed across the landform (Figure 40) disclosed

(n=24). Similar materials were noted in surface
contexts. Ceramics were uniformly distributed across
the site, although they were particularly common in
Shovel Test #5, with 17 plain sherds, at the northern
end of the knoll (see Figure 40). The shovel testing
at 41RR214 did not identify midden deposits or
other cultural features, but prehistoric artifacts were
retrieved to between 50-60 cm bs in sandy loam
deposits of the Annona-Freestone complex.
The site appears to possess research potential since it may have an intact Woodland period
occupation. The relatively diverse nature of the
artifactual assemblage from 41RR214 bespeaks
an occupation of some duration, and thus it is
possible that habitation features are present at the
site; the depth of the sandy loam soils over the
clay B-horizon also suggests that some features
can be identified in subsurface contexts. If such
features are present at the site, their investigation
could shed significant new light on the nature
of Woodland period settlement in the Red River
valley. Test excavations seem warranted to fully
assess the contextual integrity and research values
of 41RR214.

41RR215
This 20th century house site is located on a
small rise adjacent to Pond Creek, and adjacent to
an old farm road that crosses Pond Creek. The site
is marked by a diffuse scatter of household-related
debris in an overgrown pasture setting, including
whitewares, stonewares, brick fragments, bottle
glass, and wire nails. A small surface scatter (n=30)
of historic artifacts was documented to characterize
the temporal span of the historic occupation; one
burnt machine-made brick fragment was collected
from the surface. No house foundations or other
cultural features were apparent from the surface
inspection of 41RR215, and no shovel tests were
excavated, but the 1951 Kiomatia USGS 7.5’ map
shows a standing structure at this location; presumably the structure was razed and removed from the
site sometime after 1951.
The age, location, and general character of
the site is quite similar to the group of historic
archeological sites (41RR222-225, and 41RR227)
to the immediate north and west (along the same old
farm road that crosses Pond Creek) that are thought
to be part of a tenant farm community established
there in the early 20th century. Site 41RR215

may be part of the same historic community.
Archival and oral historical investigations would
be useful to learn more about the history of the
community and the families that lived there. The
site’s archeological potential appears to be rather
limited, since at best what would be obtained is
yard sheet trash data and a larger sample of massproduced bottle, glass, and metal artifacts, and we
do not recommend that additional archeological
investigations be conducted there.
41RR216
This is an early 20th century house site that is
probably associated with the small community of
Blakeney; a sparse prehistoric component is also
present. The site is located on a pimple mound
situated on a low alluvial ridge about 3 m above
the floodplain of an intermittent tributary to Big
Pine Creek. It has been eroded, and a farm road
has also cut the south end of the site, creating a cut
bank that is further exposing archeological deposits. A small feed silo has been constructed on the
site as well.
Historic artifacts (n=12) were collected in displaced contexts from the road bank area, and the
excavation of six shovel tests defined a 7200 m2
area of the pimple mound that apparently contains
subsurface archeological deposits. A high density
of 20th century historic ceramics, bottle glass,
metal, bricks, and wire nails were recovered in
sandy loam sediments between 0-50 cm bs in the
two positive shovel tests, mixed with a single piece
of lithic debris in one of the shovel tests; there is
no indication that the prehistoric artifacts occur in
a discrete or isolable zone below the historic 20th
century deposits.
Given the age of the artifacts recovered in the
surface collection and shovel testing, the historic
archeological deposits appear to be from the standing structure shown at this location on the 1951
Kiomatia USGS 7.5' topographic quadrangle. No
archeological features or house foundation remnants were identified by TAS survey personnel.
Site 41RR216 was apparently occupied in historic
times during the heyday of the Blakeney community, which was a small commercial establishment
of about 100 in population in 1910 (Webb 1952,
Volume I:171; Hazlewood 1996:580).
The prehistoric artifacts, particularly the one
plain grog-tempered sherd recovered in the surface
collection, hint at limited use of the site during either

Perttula—Survey of the Roitsch Farm and Adjoining Lands, 1991–1992 219
the Woodland period or the earlier part of the prehistoric Caddo tradition in the Mound Prairie area. These
materials are sparsely distributed at the site, and they
occur in eroded, disturbed, or mixed contexts.
Considering both the historic and prehistoric
archeological information recovered in the TAS
investigations, site 41RR216 appears to lack the
potential to address important regional archeological research problems. Consequently, I do not
recommend future investigations at the site.
41RR217, Roitsch Barn
The Roitsch Barn site is on an alluvial landform
that parallels an intermittent tributary to Big Pine
Creek, which is about 1 km to the north. There are
several pimple mounds on the landform, and two
of these contain subsurface archeological deposits
with prehistoric and historic artifacts. Prehistoric
and historic artifacts are also visible on the surface
in eroded and disturbed contexts which were
caused by road grading and barn construction.
Based on surface exposures and shovel testing,
the Roitsch Barn site covers about 5000 m2, and
has archeological deposits that extend to approximately 25 cm bs in depth. The erosion, road grading, and barn construction have heavily disturbed
the site, and only small remnants of possibly intact
archeological deposits were identified in the shovel
testing of the pimple mounds. Four shovel tests
were excavated at 41RR217, and two contained
low densities of prehistoric and historic artifacts.
Prehistoric artifacts recovered from the site
include lithic debris (n=3), fire-cracked rock (n=6),
and three plain grog-tempered pottery sherds.
These cultural materials may represent either a
Woodland period and/or Early Caddo occupation,
although the archeological evidence is not sufficient to be more definitive on the temporal span
of site use.
Unidentified metal fragments, a plain whiteware sherd, and a salt-glazed/lead-glazed stoneware sherd were recovered in surface collections
and shovel testing. They are indicative of site
use after ca. 1875, and may represent yard sheet
trash from a possible farmstead or tenant farm;
no historic features or structural foundations were
apparent at the Roitsch Barn site, however.
Due to the shallow and disturbed archeological
deposits across most of the Roitsch Barn site, we
do not think that further archeological investigations are warranted at this time. The two pimple

mounds with shallow prehistoric remains should
be avoided if possible, however, because there is a
slight chance that prehistoric features of Woodland
period and/or earlier Caddo age may still be present
below the plowed and disturbed soils at the site.
41RR218
Site 41RR218 is in a pasture on a narrow rise
paralleling an intermittent tributary of Big Pine
Creek; the creek itself is about 900 m to the north.
There are a number of pimple mounds on the landform, but none of them in the vicinity of the site
appears to contain archeological deposits.
The site was first identified when 20th century
historic glass and metal artifacts, and several pieces
of lithic debris, were noted along the eroded edge
of the dirt farm road that runs along the northern
end of the site. This farm road also runs past sites
41RR216 and 41RR217 to the old community of
Blakeney, Texas. The excavation of three shovel
tests documented that the site has shallow (ca. 20
cm) and plowed archeological deposits that cover
about 12,000 m2. Although prehistoric artifacts
were observed in surface contexts, and a piece of
lithic debris and a grinding slab fragment were collected from the surface, only 20th century ceramics
(both whiteware and Bristol-glazed stoneware,
including one ca. 1920 piece with cobalt paint),
bottle glass, and wire nails (n=3) were recovered
in the two positive shovel tests and the selective
surface collection (n=80 specimens) carried out
when the site was first identified by the TAS, along
with a mule shoe, barbed wire, and a piece of rubber (see Appendix III).
Based on the recovery of both domestic and
architectural artifacts, it is presumed that site
41RR218 principally represents the remnants of
a 20th century farmstead; the prehistoric lithic
debris and ground stone evidences the limited use
of the site area in prehistoric times. No structural
remains or foundations were identified during the
survey, however. The historic occupation appears
to be contemporaneous with nearby sites 41RR216
and 41RR217, and these three sites may represent
farmhouses that were an outlying part of the small
Blakeney community. No archeological investigations are recommended for site 41RR218 at this
time, but archival and historical research on the
Blakeney community could profitably illuminate
the character of early 20th century agricultural settlements in this part of Red River County, Texas.

Texas Archeological Society
41RR219

This primarily prehistoric site is located on
a dissected alluvial landform overlooking, and
some 3-6 m above, the Big Pine Creek/Red River
floodplain. Several pimple mounds occur on the
landform, but they do not appear to have been
particularly favored for prehistoric habitation or
use in this area. The land is pasture, with scattered
hardwoods, and a few gopher mounds observed on
the northern and northwestern part of the landform
disclosed a few pieces of lithic debris and two plain
grog- and bone-tempered pottery sherds, as well as
two clear bottle glass sherds; otherwise, surface
visibility ranged between 10-20 percent.
To overcome the poor surface visibility between
the scattered gopher mounds, and to help determine
the vertical and horizontal extent of the archeological
deposits at 41RR219, three shovel tests were excavated by the TAS survey team. All three shovel tests
contained prehistoric artifacts; this, in combination
with the surface distribution of cultural materials suggests the site covers approximately 10,800 m2 of the
alluvial landform. The shovel tests were excavated
to depths of 50-70 cm bs, where a sandy clay subsoil
was encountered. Prehistoric artifacts, including lithic
debris (n=5), fire-cracked rock (n=3), and a quartzite
biface preform, were recovered from 20-40 cm bs in a
sandy loam soil; the density of artifacts per shovel test
is relatively low (3.0 artifacts/shovel test) compared to
other prehistoric sites on the Roitsch Farm. No cultural
features or midden deposits were noted in the limited
investigations conducted to date at site 41RR219.
Although this site has a low density of artifacts
in subsurface contexts, the TAS shovel testing effort suggests that the archeological deposits are
basically intact. The lack of diagnostic artifacts
hinders specific temporal interpretations of when
the site was occupied (i.e., the plain sherds suggest
that the site may have been used during either the
Woodland period or the Formative-Middle Caddo
periods [ca. 200 B.C. to A.D. 1300]). However,
the good integrity of the site, and the possibility
that cultural features could be preserved there,
mean that further archeological investigations are
warranted to determine whether site 41RR219 has
research significance.
41RR220
Site 41RR220 appears to contain a small
(1800 m2), but discrete, archeological deposit

situated along a narrow alluvial ridge that has been
dissected by two intermittent (and probably springfed) tributaries which drain north into the Big Pine
Creek floodplain. Big Pine Creek is some 800 m to
the north-northwest of the site.
Currently in pasture, the site is well-marked
by two pimple mounds along the northern side of
the ridge, and the pimple mounds have sandy loam
sediments about 60+ cm in thickness (based on the
shovel testing). Surface visibility was poor on the
site, less than 5 percent, and only a single piece of
fire-cracked rock was observed on the surface.
Five shovel tests were then excavated along
the ridge, and on the pimple mounds, to determine
if site 41RR220 contained subsurface archeological deposits; the shovel tests were somewhat
randomly spaced between 5-40 m apart. Four of
the five shovel tests recovered prehistoric artifacts
between 10-40 cm bs, specifically: lithic debris
(n=11), plain pottery sherds (n=13), decorated
pottery sherds (n=2), daub (n=1), and charcoal
(n=2). Most of the artifacts were from Shovel Test
#5 (n=13), in the southeastern portion of the site
(Figure 41).
The one grog-tempered appliqued pottery
sherd (see Figure 38e), and the quantity of plain
grog-tempered sherds within the assemblage as a
whole, suggests that site 41RR220 was occupied
during the earlier part of the prehistoric Caddo
tradition, broadly from ca. A.D. 800-1300; appliqued vessels with grog-temper are relatively
common, as mentioned above, in the ca. A.D.
1100-1300 component at the Holdeman site
(41RR11) (see Perino 1995; Perttula 1995). There
is also one red-slipped shell-tempered body sherd
from Shovel Test #5, pointing to a Late Caddo use
of the site as well.
The presence of daub, as well as charcoal, may
also hint at the possibility that features (hearths)
and/or structures (with mud walls and thatch)
are preserved at the site. The apparent integrity
of the site, the kinds and abundance of artifacts,
and the possibility that the archeological deposits
relate almost exclusively to a single archeological
component, all reasonably lead to the recommendation that 41RR220 be preserved. Test excavations, or more intensive shovel testing across the
site, should also be conducted to determine more
confidently what the research potential of the site
is, and what types of archeological research problems and issues can be addressed through its future
investigation.

41RR221
Site 41RR221 appears to have an important
discrete and intact Woodland period archeological
deposit; features, middens, and abundant archeological materials are likely to be preserved at the
site. A plain shell-tempered rim sherd also suggests
that the site was occupied during the Late Caddo
McCurtain phase. This site is located on an alluvial
terrace of Big Pine Creek, and small, intermittent
tributaries run along the west and south sides of
the landform. Big Pine Creek is about 50 m north
of the terrace.
The northern half of the terrace is wooded,
while the southern half is in pasture; the surface
visibility is limited in both areas, and all the TAS
investigations took place in the pasture area. Two
plain sherds and a biface preform fragment of
Red River gravel chert were found in a surface
collection in the pasture, and field notes suggest
that lithic debris and pottery sherds were common
in gopher mounds across the site. Several pimple
mounds mark the pasture, and three shovel tests

were excavated to determine
the depth and extent of any
preserved archeological deposits. Based on the recovery
of archeological materials
from each of the shovel tests,
the known extent of the site
is about 8000 m 2 (Figure
42); since it is likely the site
covers the area of the pimple
mounds as well as the alluvial
terrace itself, the site limits
are estimated at 19,000 m2.
The shovel testing disclosed archeological deposits
at least 80 cm (the depth of the
shovel testing) in thickness in
the Annona-Freestone Complex soils. No features were
identified in the limited investigations, but large pieces of
fire-cracked rock and ceramic
sherds, as well as charcoal, at
a depth of 50 cm bs in Shovel
Test #1 (see Figure 42) suggest
that a cultural feature may have
been encountered in this area of
the site; it is considered likely
that site 41RR221 contains a
variety of cultural features (probably pits and cooking/heating hearths). Although the soils at the site are
dark in color, and appear to contain high amounts of
organic material, our shovel testing did not locate
midden deposits. Bone fragments in Shovel Test #1,
and charcoal pieces in Shovel Tests #1 and #2, do
indicate that faunal and floral materials are preserved
at the site, although their frequency or density cannot
be estimated from the limited TAS work.
All three shovel tests at this site contain high
densities of artifacts (average of 26.7 artifacts/
shovel test or ca. 300 artifacts per m3), which is
among the highest densities of any of the sites
that received shovel testing during the TAS
investigations. Recovered in the shovel tests were:
plain body sherds (n=13) and a plain direct or
straight rim with a rounded lip (n=1), lithic debris
(n=34), one Gary, var. Camden dart point from
Shovel Test #3, a grinding slab fragment, a unifacial
lithic tool, daub (n=4), fire-cracked rock (n=7),
bone (n=1), and charcoal/charred nutshells (n=17).
While the archeological evidence is rather limited,

dart point can be interpreted to be associated with
a Woodland period component, as these classes of
artifacts are rather consistently found together in the
Middle Red River area only on sites occupied during
that time (see Bruseth et al. 1991, 1992; Perttula, ed.,
this volume; Perttula et al. 2001).
Certainly further archeological investigations
are warranted to determine if site 41RR221 primarily
represents a single component Woodland period
occupation. At the present time, the archeological
evidence retrieved from the site indicates that it
contains a well-preserved archeological deposit,
one with the potential to contain cultural features
and associated material remains from a period in
prehistory that is not well known on the Red River
(e.g., Perttula et al. 1993:100-101). I recommend
a program of systematic shovel testing across the
site—including pasture and woodland areas—to
get a broad idea of the subsurface character of the
archeological deposits, followed up by controlled
hand excavations focusing on one or two areas of the

Site 41RR222 is one of a set of five
(41RR222-41RR225, and 41RR227)
closely spaced early 20th century farmsteads defined (through systematic surface collection) in a 23 acre plowed field
on a low terrace about 500 m from Pond
Creek (Figure 43). They are thought to
be part of a small community of tenant
farmers that lived in the area ca. 1930.
The farm roads that run by the archeological remnants of the community
appear to have been farm roads used
at the time that ran between the larger
market communities of Davenport and
Manchester.
This site covers approximately
5500 m2, and is immediately parallel
to the dirt and gravel farm road. While
quantities of historic artifacts were
visible on the surface of the plowed
field, and artifacts were marked and pin
flagged as part of the process of defining site limits, no clear concentrations
of historic artifacts could be detected
on the basis of the surface evidence.
No structural remains or foundations were noted
at 41RR222, which suggests that when the site
was abandoned the structure that must have been
present was either torn down and destroyed, or was
removed to another location to be reused.
A wide variety of ca. 1900-1940 historic
artifacts were collected from 41RR222 during
the TAS investigations, along with an isolated
dart point fragment. Machine-made bottle glass
sherds, mainly clear in color, were well represented
(n=581), along with whiteware, porcelain, ironstone, and stoneware sherds (n=67). Among the
glass sherds were milk glass pieces from fruit jar
lids, two sherds from brown glass snuff containers,
and two machine-made tableware glass fragments.
The only decorated whiteware sherds were a green
Fiesta ware and one decalcomania-relief-molded
rim. One whiteware sherd with a maker’s mark is
from a vessel made by the Crown Potteries Co. in
Evansville, Indiana between ca. 1902-1962 (Kovel
and Kovel 1986).

Metal (n=6) and brick fragments were also
present; in the case of the latter artifacts, notes
were taken on the types of metal and brick artifacts
observed on the surface, but most were not collected. The wire nails are securely dated to after
1890 (Wells 1998).

The types of metal artifacts that were noted
included wire nails, cartridge casings, stove parts,
or parts of metal tools, as well as agricultural tools
(i.e., sickles, irrigation sleeves, chains, and hoes) to

This historic site is located in the middle of
the large plowed field, and in the midst of a cluster
of probable ca. 1900-1930 tenant farmsteads that
marked an abandoned Depression-era community.
Historic site 41RR223 is immediately west of site
41RR225 and north-northwest of 41RR222; historic farmstead 41RR224 is about 50 m to the west
(see Figure 43).
Site 41RR223 covers approximately 10,200
m2 based on the surface distribution of historic
artifacts. The spatial pattern in the distribution of
artifacts suggests that there might have been two
structures on the site (Figure 44), a house (Area B)
and a barn (Area A), or alternatively that the house
area (Area B had a number of machine-made brick
fragments) had a well-defined yard sheet trash
deposit in association (that is, immediately behind
the probable house area). No structural remnants
or foundations were apparent at 41RR223.
The same survey procedures used at 41RR222
were also employed at 41RR223, and the pinflagging of surface artifacts allowed the recognition of the two artifact concentrations. The kinds

the surface collections (see Appendix III) include
machine-made brick fragments, ironstone, whiteware, porcelain, and stoneware sherds (n=310),
clear, aqua, green, purple, and brown machinemade bottle glass (n=418), brown snuff container
glass, purple and clear glass tableware, wire nails
and other metal items (n=49), a porcelain button,
a porcelain door knob, and four pieces of slate
from a writing board. Window glass and pieces of
plastic were observed on the surface, but they were
not collected during our investigations. One of the
two whiteware maker’s marks is identifiable: “...
OMPSON ...HANL... ENGLAN...” appears to be
from a J & G Meakins Ltd. plate made between ca.
1890-1907 (Kovel and Kovel 1986).
We offer no archeological recommendations
for site 41RR223 at the present time (see discussion for 41RR222, above). Further archival and
historical investigations could be conducted to
determine what kind of community existed in this
area during the Depression, and who the occupants
of the community were.

the site testify to the domestic nature of the historic
occupation, thus our conclusion that it represents a
farmstead, and the wide scatter of artifacts is indicative of a broad dispersal of yard sheet trash associated with the use of the farmhouse and yard areas.
It is not known if site 41RR222 contains subsurface archeological deposits as no shovel tests
were conducted as part of our investigations here,
but it is doubtful that they are extensive given the
stable landform, the short occupation, and the deep
chisel plowing carried out in recent years along
Pond Creek by the landowner. Thus, it is considered unlikely that 41RR222 possesses archeological significance, or has much potential to contribute
to the resolution of research problems on this era
that depend on the kinds of information obtained
from the archeological record. Nevertheless, given
its age, the site may possess historical significance
by being able to contribute to our understanding of
tenant and cotton farming in Northeast Texas in the
early 20th century, but its evaluation in this regard
awaits the development of the appropriate regional
and topical historic context (cf. Wilson 1990). For
the meantime, we recommend no further investigations at site 41RR222.

41RR223 some 50-100 m to the east, and historic
farmstead 41RR227 about 70 m to the north along
the fence line; a small portion of the site is in an
unplowed corner of the field (see Figure 43). The
site is estimated to cover only about 410 m2, based
on the distribution of historic artifacts on the surface of the field.
The artifacts recovered in the surface collection
suggest that 41RR224 was occupied between ca.
1900-1940, and their domestic nature is apparent
(see Appendix III). These include machine-made
brick fragments (n=3), clear, purple, aqua, blue,
and brown machine-made bottle glass, fruit jar, and
milk glass sherds (n=82), brown snuff container
glass, a porcelain doll leg, and plain ironstone,
whiteware, and porcelain sherds (n=68). Among
the decorated whiteware are six Fiesta ware and
two relief-molded rim sherds, and there is one porcelain sherd with a painted rim band. A few metal
artifacts (n=4) were collected from the site: wire
nails, and a teaspoon with “WM RODGERS AND
SON AAX” inscribed on it. Two pieces of animal
bone (probably from cow) were also collected from
the site in our survey investigations.
No archeological investigations are recommended for site 41RR224 at this time. As mentioned before, an archival and historical study of
this small Depression-era community could be
enlightening about what life was like in this part
of the Red River Valley in the early 20th century.

roughly ca. 1900-1940, is situated immediately to the
west of the farm road, about 20 m north of 41RR222
(another historic farmstead) and 0.6 km north of the
wooden bridge over Pond Creek (see Figure 43). The
site covers about 4200 m2 of the plowed field, with
one concentrated area of artifacts in the approximate
center of the defined site boundaries.
No structural remains or foundations were
observed at the site, but historic ceramics (n=42),
glass (n=428, 76 percent clear glass, including
1 clear tableware glass base with a floral motif),
metal (n=11), and machine-made brick (n=11)
artifacts are common on the surface. Two of the
whiteware sherds have late 19th-early 20th century
relief-molded rims (e.g., Majewski and O’Brien
1987), while one porcelain sherd has a decalcomania decoration.
The artifacts are mainly domestic in character

(ceramic tableware and stoneware crocks, as well
as bottle and canning jar glass sherds, and one
glass marble), but architectural remains (i.e., window glass, wire nails, and machine-made bricks)
are also present. In all likelihood, the majority
of the artifacts found in the surface collection at
41RR225 represent sheet trash dumped and swept
in the yard of a farm house. The bricks, nails, and
window glass represent the repair, as well as the
dismantling and destruction, of the structure during
its use and eventual abandonment. The TAS work
did not include shovel testing at any of the historic
farmsteads in the community of which 41RR225
appears to have been a part, so it is not known if
subsurface archeological deposits and/or features
are present at the site.
As with the other 20th century sites in this part
of the Roitsch Farm survey area, archival and historical investigations should be carried out to learn
more about this possible Depression-era community. No archeological work seems warranted until
the archival and historic investigations have been
completed, and a proper research context has been
developed to understand the historical significance
of these kinds of sites (e.g., Wilson 1990).
41RR226
Site 41RR226 is a small (ca. 230 m2) prehistoric
archeological site amidst the community of probable
tenant farmsteads (discussed above) north of Pond
Creek (see Figure 43). It is located between historic
farmstead sites 41RR225 and 41RR227.
The site was defined by a low density (1 artifact per 10 m2) scatter of lithic debris, burned
rocks, and three fragments of a sandstone metate.
As no shovel tests were conducted at 41RR226, it
is not known whether or not the site has subsurface
archeological deposits. Given the low density of
artifacts and the shallow loamy soils, the recent
deep-plowing at the site has probably adversely
effected the archeological potential of the site.
Nevertheless, until shovel testing is conducted, and
the presence or absence of buried archeological
deposits is confirmed, it is recommended that the
site be avoided by any ground-modifying activities
different from the traditional use of the land.
41RR227
Site 41RR227 is the last of the five apparently
associated 20th century historic farmsteads (the

226

Texas Archeological Society

others include 41RR222-225) in the large plowed
field north of Pond Creek. This particular site,
which covers only about 100 m2, is located in the
far northwest corner of the plowed field and adjacent to a tree-covered fence line, about 25 m north
of 41RR224 (see Figure 43) and west of the other
three farmsteads.
The small size of the site and the limited
number of surfaces may suggest that it is not a
farmstead per se, but a sheet trash area or yard
midden associated with a farmstead structure in
the vicinity (i.e., 41RR224). Based on the kinds of
artifacts found at the site in surface contexts (plain
and decorated whiteware and porcelain [n=6],
clear, purple, and aqua bottle glass from post-1903
machine-made bottles [n=12], milk glass from fruit
jar lids [n=3], and unidentifiable metal fragments
[n=2]), and the low density of materials, the deposit
seems to represents a limited accumulation of domestic refuse.
We recommend no further archeological investigations at site 41RR227. Historic and archival
research of this community may shed some light
on the nature and character of the occupants of the
site, as well as on the archeological deposit found
there.
41RR228
During the survey by the TAS of the Jonesborough site area (41RR15) in 1991, a cursory
reconnaissance was conducted of a large plowed
soybean field some 500 m south and southeast of
the historic marker for Jonesborough on FM 410.
The purpose of the reconnaissance was to try to
locate historic archeological sites contemporaneous
with the putative early- to mid-19th century
occupation at 41RR15, thought to be the town of
Jonesborough (see Perttula and Reese 2001; Reese
2001). Site 41RR228 was located during this effort
in the Jonesborough vicinity.
The site, which covers about 500 m2, is on a
broad, flat alluvial terrace of the Red River; the
current channel of the river is about 600 m to the
east-southeast. Two slightly (above 390 feet amsl)
higher alluvial terrace remnants occur to the north
and south of 41RR228, which is located on a lower
“swale” between the terrace remnants. The area was
recently plowed, with soybean plants maturing, but
ground surface visibility was excellent (80 percent).
Twentieth century historic ceramics (n=4),
including plain whiteware and one Bristol-glazed

stoneware, bottle glass (n=7), and milk glass (n=7)
from fruit jar lids were rather evenly dispersed over
the site area, and they occurred in low densities.
The presence of subsurface archeological deposits
has not been ascertained, but it is unlikely that extensive deposits are preserved in the deep-plowed
sandy loams at the site. No further archeological
investigations are warranted at 41RR228.
The plain whiteware, the stoneware, and the
clear and brown bottle glass made on an automatic
bottle making machine, suggest that the site roughly dates between ca. 1900-1940. It is presumed that
these archeological remains represent the traces
of a tenant farm (Arnold Roitsch, 1991 personal
communication) probably associated with the community and market town of Davenport, established
in 1885 but with a population of only 44 in 1940
(Webb 1952, Volume I:467; Harper 1996b:520). If
and when archival and historical studies are initiated of the community of Davenport, we recommend
that the studies be sufficiently broad to encompass
the outlying and dispersed tenant farmsteads that
were apparently also part of the community.
41RR229
This particular site was reported to the TAS
survey team by Mr. Ernst Roitsch (1991 personal
communication). He noted that prehistoric cultural materials, principally lithic debris and tool
fragments, were visible in the area of a small rise
when it is mowed and/or plowed. The prehistoric
artifacts are located on an alluvial landform (a
dissected alluvial terrace of the Red River) paralleling Pond Creek, some 100 m to the north. The
crest of the landform is about 3 m above the Pond
Creek floodplain.
When a TAS survey team visited the site in
1991, it was covered in native grasses and second
growth hardwoods, and surface visibility ranged
between 0-10 percent. The rise itself covered about
800 m2. There were several extensive (i.e., 10 m2)
eroded areas paralleling the farm road that bisects
the site, and these indicated that shallow (less
than 40 cm) sandy loam and loam sediments were
present on the rise. Prehistoric lithic debris and an
occasional piece of plain whiteware and ironstone
(as well as small brick fragments and a porcelain
door knob sherd) indicate that site 41RR229 was
used during prehistoric and historic (ca. 1900)
times, but the nature of the occupations is very
poorly defined at present. The brick and door knob

Perttula—Survey of the Roitsch Farm and Adjoining Lands, 1991–1992 227
fragment suggest that a 20th century farmstead
was present at 41RR229. We recommend that a
program of shovel testing be done to assess the
nature and extent of any subsurface archeological
deposits at the site.
41RR230
This archeological site appears to have been
looted and dug by collectors and “pothunters” who
have pocked the area with pits and holes. The site
itself is on a small knoll situated along the edge
of an alluvial terrace deposit overlooking the Big
Pine Creek floodplain; two small natural ponds are
present in the floodplain east and northeast of the
terrace cutback, and the current channel of Big Pine
Creek is 350 m to the north.
Lithic debris (n=6) and tools were visible on
the surface of the site, along with modern bottle
glass (n=3) and a single small piece of brick. Included in the prehistoric tools collected from the
disturbed surface were a unifacial retouched flake
and two dart projectile points. The dart points were
a Gary point, var. Gary made of Big Fork chert and
a resharpened Kent point on a local reddish-gray
quartzite. If Story’s (1990:Figure 32) proposed
chronological sequence of dart points in Northeast
Texas is accurate, the dart points at 41RR230 imply
that the site was occupied in the latter part of the
Late Archaic period, around 2500 years ago.
Four shovel tests were excavated at 41RR230
to determine if the site contained intact archeological deposits. Three of the shovel tests had prehistoric lithic debris (n=10) and fire-cracked rock
(n=1) in sandy loam deposits about 30 cm in depth,
and the dispersion of these shovel tests suggests
the site covers about 1200 m2; one shovel test also
had an unidentifiable piece of metal. The density
of artifacts in subsurface contexts is uniformly
relatively low (3.7 artifacts/shovel test) compared
with other shovel-tested sites on the Roitsch Farm,
although Shovel Test #3 at the western end of the
knoll contained about twice as many artifacts as
the site average.
While no obvious concentrations of prehistoric
artifacts were encountered in the limited shovel
testing, and the site has been damaged by artifact
collectors to a limited but basically unknown extent, our work at the site suggests that the bulk of
the archeological deposit at 41RR230 is intact. Its
significance, and potential for features, has not yet
been determined, however. I believe the appropriate

next step in the investigations is to conduct more
extensive shovel testing (perhaps at 10 m intervals)
to better define the vertical and horizontal extent of
the archeological deposit, and based on the results
of that work, hand-controlled excavations may be
warranted to fully explore its research significance.
It is also important to photo-document as much as
feasible the archeological collections accumulated
from the site by the collectors and diggers as this
recordation may provide pertinent information on
the prehistoric use of the site area.
41RR231, Conehead
The Conehead site may be a prehistoric earthen
mound, although insuffi cient information was
uncovered in the limited TAS investigations to
be absolutely sure that it is nothing more than a
natural mound. The site is located adjacent to an
intermittent tributary of Big Pine Creek and near
the toe of an upland slope; Big Pine Creek is 700
m north of the site.
Present at 41RR231 is a small, conical moundshaped area ca. 40 m in diameter and 4.6 m in
height. It is not a natural pimple mound, it has a
large tree growing out of it, and shovel tests excavated by the TAS survey team showed that the
mound had a mottled, clayey fill while off-mound
areas were characterized by Thenas fine sandy
loam alluvial soils (see Thomas 1977). There are
also several potholes in the mound, but examination of them did not disclose obvious mound fill
zones, features, or artifacts. On the available evidence, it may be reasonable to conclude that the
mound is of man-made construction, although at
this point we cannot conclude that it was built in
prehistoric times; it may simply be a modern earthmoving feature. Shovel testing around the mound
did not locate any associated prehistoric habitation
features or archeological deposits.
One intriguing piece of information that is
available is that several collectors and pothunters
told the TAS survey team about what they referred
to as an “early” mound in this vicinity on Big Pine
Creek that they were digging. Exactly what they
meant by “early” was not clear; that is, it was not
obvious if “early” referred to the kinds of artifacts
being found at the site during their digging (that
is, did the artifacts suggest an occupation predating
the Caddo settlement of the Red River region?), or
if they based the “early” designation on the apparent shape or form of the mound. In any case, the

228

Texas Archeological Society

mound at the Conehead site does evidence some
pothunting activities, so there is some possibility
that this mound and the “early” mound mentioned
by the collectors and pothunters are one and the
same. We should note that none of the collectors
and pothunters we talked with offered to show us
the location of the “early” mound, or permit TAS
survey teams to view or photo-document any artifacts that may have come from the site.
Thus, for the moment the Conehead site is an
enigma. It is important to determine whether the
mound is a prehistoric feature. If it is a prehistoric
mound, then the site would prove to have great significance for understanding prehistoric lifeways in
the middle Red River region, especially so if the
mound were shown to have been constructed prior
to Caddo times. Pre-A.D. 800 mounds are rare in
Northeast Texas, particularly north of the Sabine
River (see Perttula et al. 1993:99, 110, 114-115),
although they are relatively common along the Red
River in southwestern Arkansas and northwestern
Louisiana (Schambach 1997). For future purposes,
then, we recommend that further systematic shovel
testing be completed around the mound to search for
buried archeological deposits, and several controlled
excavation units should also be placed in the mound
to examine the character of its fill, as well as the
presence or absence of features and prehistoric occupational strata within the mound itself.
41RR232
Site 41RR232 is a prehistoric archeological
site of unknown age. It is located on a small
alluvial rise (covering about 900 m2) adjacent to
an intermittent tributary of Big Pine Creek, and
it overlooks the Big Pine Creek floodplain; the
creek itself is 450 m to the north. The site is in
an overgrown pasture, and consequently surface
visibility was poor (less than 10 percent), but lithic
debris, a biface, fire-cracked rock, and a ground
stone tool were visible eroding from the north
end of the rise. The erosional cut showed that the
artifact-bearing loamy soils (Mckamie loam) are
about 40 cm thick over the red clay B-horizon.
A small surface collection of lithic debris
(n=8), fire-cracked rock (n=1), a biface, and one
ground stone tool was obtained from the area of
the erosional cut. Three shovel tests were then excavated at 20 m intervals on the rise, beginning immediately above the erosional cut. All three shovel
tests contained prehistoric artifacts, generally from

depths of 0-30 cm, including lithic debris (n=16),
daub (n=1), and fire-cracked rock (n=1); small
pieces of charcoal were noted in two of the shovel
tests, but its cultural context was not definitely established during the TAS investigations. Although
the site deposits are relatively shallow, and the density of archeological materials is relatively low (6.0
artifacts/shovel test), the TAS work indicates that
intact archeological deposits are present at the site.
I recommend that additional shovel tests and/or
50 x 50 cm units be excavated at the site to obtain
temporally diagnostic artifacts, assess the potential
of the site to contain features, and determine the
contextual association of the charcoal present in
the subsurface deposits.
41RR233
Site 41RR233 has been extensively disturbed
by construction of a pond on an alluvial terrace
of Big Pine Creek. This construction removed
archeological deposits over an area of approximately 3000 m2 (about 40 percent of the site area),
and prehistoric and historic artifacts were visible
around the edge of the pond and in the adjacent
pasture. The site itself is on an alluvial landform
next to an intermittent tributary of Big Pine Creek;
the surface distribution of artifacts and shovel testing suggest the site covers ca. 7700 m2.
The TAS survey crew secured a surface collection of artifacts from 41RR233. Lithic debris
(n=25) and cores (n=5) were common, along with
a dart point preform (for a Gary type?), fire-cracked
rock (n=1), and 20th century ceramics and bottle
glass (n=4). Four shovel tests were excavated
around the perimeters of the pond to determine
the horizontal and vertical extent of the archeological deposits, and three of the tests contained
prehistoric artifacts between 10-30 cm bs; the clay
B-horizon ranged from 30 to 46 cm bs across the
site area. A low density of artifacts were found in
subsurface contexts (3.7 artifacts/shovel test), including lithic debris (n=9), fire-cracked rock (n=1),
and a bifacial tool fragment in Shovel Test #1. The
possible preform to a Gary point suggests only that
site 41RR233 was occupied during either the Late
Archaic or Woodland periods.
The research potential of 41RR233 has been
considerably diminished by the construction of a
stock pond on the site, as it has destroyed about
40 percent of its archeological deposits. Nevertheless, the TAS shovel testing did show that there are

Perttula—Survey of the Roitsch Farm and Adjoining Lands, 1991–1992 229
intact subsurface archeological remains around the
pond which may warrant further investigation. It
seems appropriate that more intensive shovel testing and limited controlled excavations be carried
out at the site in the future to assess its potential
to contain cultural features, and to determine
what the contextual integrity is of the prehistoric
occupation(s) there.
41RR234
This site is located on a 1500 m2 alluvial rise
or pimple mound about 200 m from an intermittent
tributary of Big Pine Creek; site 41RR214 is 50 m
to the east-southeast. The landform is currently in
pasture, with poor surface visibility (5 percent), but
lithic debris (n=3), one animal bone, and a plain
grog-tempered pottery sherd were recovered in
eroded surface contexts at the site.
The TAS survey team excavated three shovel
tests on the landform, two on the rise and a third
on a very small pimple mound about 30 m to the
north of the rise; this shovel test did not encounter
archeological deposits. The other two shovel tests
contained low densities (2.0 artifacts/shovel test)
of prehistoric artifacts (four pieces of lithic debris)
between 10-50 cm in sandy loam sediments.
The low numbers of prehistoric artifacts
recovered from 41RR234 prohibits any definitive
conclusions concerning the age or function of
the site occupation(s), although the recovery of a
single non-shell tempered pottery sherd implies an
occupation predating ca. A.D. 1300. The fact that up
to 50 cm of archeological deposits are present at the
site, and that there is no evidence that the deposits
have been disturbed, suggests that indeed intact
archeological deposits may be preserved there. What
the research significance of these archeological
deposits is unclear, but can be addressed with further
archeological investigations.

dense patches of poison ivy), the survey team was
able to locate six marked graves and one depression that may also be from a burial (Figure 46a).
Mr. Williams indicated that there are other marked
and unmarked burials at the site beyond the ones
we were able to locate, but the thick vegetation
and numerous downed trees limited our ability to
ascertain how many graves there are at 41RR235.
We noted no disturbance to the cemetery during
our investigations, other than damage done by
tree falls, and there is a remnant of a barbed wire
fence along the eastern side of the site; to the west
is a pasture. Thus, the cemetery does not currently
appear to be in danger of disturbance.
The six marked graves were scattered from
north to south across the western side of the rise,
while the one depression is at the northern end of
the rise (see Figure 46a). A small patch of irises
were noted along the western side of the rise, not
far south of the Wm Taylor grave. The grave markers (from north to south) were placed for:
1. B. J. Taylor, Oct 23, 1872, Apr. 30, 1900. The
marker reads: “Hope” at the crest, and “To

Site 41RR235 is an historic cemetery nestled
in a strip of dense hardwoods some 50 m west of
Salt Well Slough, and about 350 m downstream
from the Davenport bridge over the slough. The
cemetery, which covers about 2800 m2, sits on a
narrow alluvial rise (Figure 45).
This site was reported to one of the TAS survey
teams by Mr. Bob Williams of Clarksville, Texas.
Although the area was thickly overgrown (with

We recommend that a more complete reconnaissance of the cemetery site be made in the
future, preferably during the winter months when
the vegetation is not so thick and visibility should
be much improved. The purpose of these investigations would be to fully define the number and location of the marked graves at 41RR235, as well as
attempt to ascertain the likely number and location
of depressions and probable unmarked burials. If
the same spacing of graves occurs on the eastern
side of the rise as the TAS documented on the west
side, the cemetery may contain a total of 15-20
individuals
41RR236, Pine Cone Site
Site 41RR236 covers about 1050 m2 of a small
rise on a Holocene alluvial terrace of the Red River.
The current channel of the river is about 800 m
north of the site. The site was initially located by
the TAS historic archeological team working at the
nearby Jonesborough site (see Perttula and Reese
2001; Reese 2001), who noted a scatter of prehistoric ceramics and lithic artifacts on the plowed
surface of the rise while they were conducting a
surface inspection of the general area (the Roitsch
West tract, see Figure 27). The historic archeological team then notified one of the TAS survey teams,
who went to record the prehistoric site.

Following the initial identification of the Pine
Cone site, and the acquisition of a small surface
collection from the sandy rise, three shovel tests
and four 1 x 1 m units were excavated at the site
(Figure 47). The purpose of this work was to assess
the contextual integrity of the site’s archeological
deposits, and to ascertain the nature of the Caddo
occupation(s), as part of determining whether more
intensive excavations by the TAS Field School
were warranted in the 1992 field school effort.
Our investigations at the Pine Cone site
showed that there are relatively deep (ca. 70-100+
cm) archeological deposits preserved at the site;
it has been plowed, but there are considerable
undisturbed remains below the plow zone. The
sediments on the site include a tan sand plow
zone overlying dark brown sandy loam A- and Ehorizons that extends from ca. 25-65 cm bs. Below
this is a reddish-brown sand with clay lamellae
pedogenic features below about 90 cm bs. The
prehistoric artifacts are concentrated in the sandy
loam deposit, but do occur to about 110 cm bs.
One cultural feature (Feature 1) was identified in Test Unit 4 (Figure 48) between ca. 53-65
cm bs. This was a small pit—probably a smudge
pit based on its contents—filled primarily with
charred pine cone remains (see Fritz, Appendix
IV, this article); seven plain shell-tempered sherds
were also recovered in the pit. Similar types of
smudge pits with pine cones have been recognized
in Late Caddo McCurtain phase contexts at the
Rowland Clark site (41RR77; Perino 1994; Blake
1994) about 25 km downstream from the Pine
Cone site. A number of large pieces of unburned
animal bone were also found in this unit in apparent association with Feature 1 (see Schniebs,
Appendix V, this article).
A large assortment of prehistoric Caddo artifacts were recovered in the limited TAS investigations at the Pine Cone site (Table 4), principally
plain and decorated sherds and daub. The shovel
testing indicates that there is a uniformly high density (22.0 artifacts/shovel test or ca. 240 artifacts
per m3) of archeological materials in subsurface
contexts on the rise, while the test excavation units
documented densities of 200-700 items per m2,
with Units 1 and 4 on opposite ends of the rise having the most abundant remains of ceramics, daub,
and lithic debris (see Figure 47). The majority of
the artifacts were found in the upper 50 cm of the
archeological deposit, but materials were recovered
to depths of +80 cm in both Units 1 and 4.

Figure 49. Decorated Sherds and Rim Sherds from the Pine Cone Site (41RR236).

River gravel cherts (i.e., Big Fork chert and Johns
Valley shale raw materials from the Ouachita
Mountains that are available in Red River gravels
below the mouth of the Kiamichi River [Banks
1990]), yellow claystone/siltstone, and red or
yellow jasper. These materials account for 72
percent of the lithic debris, along with Ogallala
quartzite (13 percent), chalcedony (6 percent), a
local yellow chert (1.5 percent), a lustrous gray
chert (1.5 percent), quartz (1.5 percent), quartzitic
sandstone (3 percent), and hematite (1.5 percent).
With the exception of the hematite, a local and
poorly knappable material, the remainder of the
lithic debris can be acquired in the Red River
gravels. Some 48 percent of the lithic debris has
no cortical remnants, principally the debris of
jasper (75 percent) or chalcedony (75 percent)
raw materials. This suggests that these materials
were not initially reduced on site, but were brought
there in roughed out blanks, large flakes, or as
completed tools.
The 476 ceramics from the site are dominated by shell-tempered wares (including a few

sherds—about 1 percent—with shell-tempered
grog), comprising about 80 percent of the sherds,
followed by various sorts of non-shell-tempered
wares, including grog (13.4 percent), bone-grog
(5.4 percent), grog-grit (0.7 percent), and bone (0.4
percent) aplastics. The shell-tempered ceramics are
from a McCurtain phase occupation, and include
sherds from Nash Neck-Banded (n=6) and Emory
Punctated-Incised jars (n=5), red-slipped Avery
Engraved bowls (n=5), and plain red-slipped bowls
(n=5), one with a thickened rim (Figure 49a-k);
the latter red-slipped bowls are common in early
McCurtain phase sites in the middle Red River
(see Perino 1981, 1994, 1995). Decorated sherds
account for 10.5 percent of the shell-tempered
pottery, a considerably higher proportion than the
contemporaneous Roitsch and Salt Well Slough
sites a few miles downstream (see Kenmotsu 2006;
Perttula et al. 2001; Perttula, ed., this volume).
Approximately 4 percent of the shell-tempered
wares have a red slip on interior and/or exterior
vessel surfaces. Other shell-tempered sherds include three plain rims, six engraved and three

Perttula—Survey of the Roitsch Farm and Adjoining Lands, 1991–1992 235
incised sherds with undetermined elements, and
seven sherds with thin appliqued strips or bands on
the body of jars (see Figure 49g); the latter may be
from early varieties of Nash Neck Banded and/or
McKinney Plain vessels. Finally, a shell-tempered
bowl sherd from an elbow pipe was recovered from
Unit 4, level 4.
The non-shell (grog and grog-bone)-tempered
decorated sherds include punctated bodies (n=8)
from utility ware jars, along with one grogtempered handle or lug. The punctations occur in
horizontal rows, and their crescent shape indicates
they were usually made by fingernails. Plain bowls
and bottles are also represented in the non-shelltempered Caddo ceramics. More than 16 percent
of the non-shell-tempered sherds have an exterior
and/or interior red slipped vessel surface.
The presence of daub (n=106), and five mud
dauber nest pieces from Units 1 and 2, at the Pine
Cone site suggests a mud and thatched (i.e., wattle
and daub) Caddo structure or structures stood on the
sandy rise. Impressions on the daub include that of
sticks, twigs, and grasses. Small pieces of burned
or fired clay were recovered almost exclusively from
the upper McCurtain phase deposits in Units 1 and
4; these pieces may represent remnants of the lining
of clay hearths or outside cooking features.
The few historic artifacts (n=19) include late
19th-early 20th century bottle glass and metal (cut
nails and unidentifiable metal fragments) from the
plow zone deposits (0-30 cm bs; see Appendix III).
They do not appear to relate to the nearby Jonesborough site, however, and probably represent yard
trash from one of the houses in the later community
of Davenport (see discussion above for the Jonesborough site [41RR15]).
Fritz (1992; see also Perttula, ed., this volume)
reported on the paleobotanical remains recovered
from Feature 1 at the Pine Cone site. It included
9.04 g of carbonized pine cone fragments, 0.04
g of cane, 0.10 g of maize fragments (including
five cupules and 10 cupule fragments), and a
few charred seeds (one maygrass, one chenopod,
one purslane, and two pine). Appendix IV of this
article provides more specific information on the
paleobotanical analyses of the remains from the
Pine Cone site. The limited amount of animal bone
appears to have been primarily from white-tailed
deer (Schniebs, Appendix V, this article).
From the available archeological evidence,
it seems that the Pine Cone site may have been
intensively occupied by Caddo groups during

both the Middle and Late Caddo periods (based
on the ceramics and the arrow points), with a hint
of Woodland period use if the Gary var. Camden
projectile point does not represent the collection and
reuse of the tool by Caddo groups. The abundance of
ceramics and daub clearly suggests that the Pine Cone
site is a small Caddo habitation site, and structures
are likely to be present there. As the site also does
contain intact and well-preserved archeological
deposits with features, in addition to preserved
faunal and floral remains, it has the potential to
address important research problems pertaining to
the Caddo settlement of the middle Red River (cf.
Bruseth et al. 1991; Perttula 1993; Perttula, ed.,
this volume). Further archeological investigations
(i.e., test excavations) would be warranted if the site
cannot be protected by the landowner.
41RR237
Prehistoric site 41RR237 covers about 1000
m2 along the edge of an alluvial terrace being dissected by the current channel of Big Pine Creek.
The creek bank is 3-6 m in height, but the landform
away from the bank is flat.
Lithic debris and scattered fire-cracked rocks
were noted along the bank edge during the 1991
TAS survey reconnaissance, as well as in gopher
mounds away from the bank itself. No culturally
or temporally diagnostic artifacts were noted at
41RR237. Shovel testing should be conducted at
the site to determine if intact archeological deposits
are present there.
41RR238
The TAS survey crew recorded this prehistoric
site on a moderately-sized knoll (ca. 3600 m2) on
an alluvial landform ca. 800 m north of Big Pine
Creek. The Davenport road is immediately adjacent
to the western edge of 41RR238. There are low,
marshy areas to the north and east of the site.
Lithic debris was noted across the knoll’s
surface in gopher mounds and eroded areas. Two
shovel tests recovered low densities of lithic debris (n=9), fire-cracked rock (n=1), and one plain
grog-tempered sherd in sandy loam deposits between 0-46 cm bs (Figure 50). The sherd may be
indicative of either a Woodland or Formative-Early
Caddo period occupation. The sandy loam deposits
on the knoll extend to at least 90 cm bs.
The presence of apparently intact prehistoric

236

archeological deposits suggests that site 41RR238
may contain important archeological information.
However, further shovel testing seems warranted to
clarify the site’s potential to contain cultural features
or reasonably isolable deposits with sufficient interpretable quantities of artifacts and/or other archeological materials (i.e., plant or animal remains).
41RR239
Site 41RR239 is on a sandy alluvial terrace
overlooking the Big Pine Creek floodplain; a marshy
area is present along the southeastern part of the terrace. On the terrace are several small natural rises;
it is likely that they all contain prehistoric archeological deposits as lithic debris and fire-cracked rock
was noted on the surface of the rises.

To determine if there were preserved archeological
deposits at 41RR239, four shovel tests were
excavated: two near the southwestern edge of the
site where artifacts were eroding out of the terrace,
and two on the most prominent rise (Figure 51). All
four shovel tests contained prehistoric artifacts (20.3
artifacts per positive shovel tests); in the eroded
area of the site, archeological deposits extended to
only about ca. 20 cm bs, and contained only limited
amounts of lithic debris (n=5) and a metate fragment.
However, in the center of the site, the archeological
deposits were between 70-80 cm in thickness.
Recovered in the two shovel tests from this area were
high quantities of lithic debris (n=31), daub (n=15),
four charcoal pieces, fire-cracked rock (n=22), one
fragment of a ground stone tool, and two plain grogtempered sherds. Seven pieces of barbed wire from a

Perttula—Survey of the Roitsch Farm and Adjoining Lands, 1991–1992 237

fence were found at ca. 12 cm bs in Shovel Test #3.
Although it has not been established on the basis of shovel testing when 41RR239 was occupied
in prehistoric times (i.e., the one possible temporal
diagnostic—the plain grog-tempered sherd—could
be representative of either a Woodland or a Caddo
period occupation), the archeological information
obtained via the shovel tests clearly demonstrates
that extensive archeological deposits are present
at the site. Because of the thickness of the sandy
loam A-horizon, further shovel testing or limited
controlled excavations should be conducted at
41RR239 to determine the contextual integrity of
the deposits (particularly in the central part of the
site), the potential for features to be preserved, and
the possibility of defining discrete and interpretable
archeological components.
41RR240
This prehistoric site is on a series of low pimple
mounds atop a flat Holocene alluvial terrace, about

1 km north of the current channel of Big Pine
Creek; it is estimated to cover 1800 m2. The terrace
is currently an overgrown pasture with hardwoods
along the margins of the terrace and floodplain.
Six shovel tests were excavated on two pimple
mounds, and low densities (mean of 2.6 artifacts
per positive shovel test) of prehistoric lithic debris
and pottery sherds were recovered between 0-25
cm in five of the small tests (Figure 52). The soil
is a sandy loam (Whakana-Elysian Complex; see
Thomas 1977) at least 80 cm in thickness. Plain
grog-tempered sherds (n=7) were found in Shovel
Tests #1, #2, and #5 on one pimple mound, and in
Shovel Test #6 on the pimple mound to the north
about 50 m (see Figure 52). Also recovered were
five pieces of lithic debris and one fire-cracked
rock. No definitive temporally diagnostic artifacts
were retrieved from 41RR240, although the
presence of plain grog-tempered sherds suggests
that the site was used either during the Woodland
period or Formative-Middle Caddo periods, before
shell-tempered pottery became popular.

238

Texas Archeological Society
A limited random surface collection of artifacts
was conducted at the site to obtain a representative
sample of the prehistoric and historic archeological materials present on the levee. A mid- to late
19th century occupation, probably a farmstead, is
represented by historic ceramics and bottle glass
(n=22). Among the historic artifacts are a mid-19th
century hand-painted whiteware sherd and a possible mocha whiteware sherd (see Rickard 1993), a
brown lead-glazed stoneware, and aqua and brown
bottle glass. A possible Woodland period component is also present at 41RR242, as indicated by

Figure 52. Site Map of 41RR240.

Although this site has an apparently low density of artifacts in subsurface contexts, insufficient
evidence was obtained during the shovel testing to
ascertain whether the archeological deposits possess integrity or have the potential to contain cultural features. It is possible, based on the available
information, to suggest that a short-term habitation
area is present at 41RR240. Additional shovel tests
should be excavated to make these determinations,
particularly between the main site area and the
small northern pimple mound, and on the northern
pimple mound itself.
41RR242
A multi-component prehistoric and historic
19th century farmstead, site 41RR242 is situated
on an alluvial ridge or natural levee of the Red
River. Salt Well Slough runs in an old channel of
the river at this point in its course. The site itself
covers approximately 9400 m2 of the plowed
natural levee, with the highest concentration of
archeological materials visible on the site at the
crest of the levee (the southwestern part of the site
proper) (Figure 53).

Figure 53. Map of Site 41RR242.

Perttula—Survey of the Roitsch Farm and Adjoining Lands, 1991–1992 239
one expanding stem (possibly of the Elam type)
projectile point made of novaculite (see Figure
34c), three plain pottery sherds, lithic debris, daub,
fire-cracked rock, a bifacial tool fragment, ground
stone tools (a pitted stone and mano fragment), and
a possible chipped stone axe fragment of hematite
(see Appendix II).
No shovel tests were conducted at 41RR242,
but given the soils (Waskom loam) and the types
of artifacts recovered, it is likely that subsurface
archeological deposits are present there. To
determine the integrity of these deposits, and
their horizontal and vertical extent, shovel
testing is warranted in conjunction with the
systematic surface collection of the site if artifact
concentrations are noted.
41RR243
Mr. Ernest Roitsch reported this prehistoric site
to the 1991 TAS survey crew. It is located on about
2500 m2 on the crest of a relatively flat alluvial terrace
paralleling Big Pine Creek; the current channel of the
creek is about 200 m to the east. Plain sherds and lithic debris were visible on the surface in an overgrown
pasture, and a small collection of 20 lithic debris and
one plain grog-tempered sherd was obtained during
a cursory site reconnaissance in 1991. These may
represent a Woodland period to Formative-Middle
Caddo period component at 41RR243 (see below).
A single plain whiteware sherd was also collected
from the surface of the site. This site needs better
vertical and horizontal definition, and it is particularly
important to gather information on the integrity of the
archeological deposits.
Ernest Roitsch allowed the TAS to document
a small collection that he has from the site.
It includes Gary (var. Camden) and Bulverde
dart projectile points (of Red River jasper and
novaculite, respectively), a beveled lanceolate of
probable Late Paleoindian period age (made from
a cream-colored chert of uncertain origin or source
area), a biface fragment of Johns Valley shale
(Banks 1990), eight pieces of lithic debris (chert
and novaculite), two plain grog-tempered pottery
body sherds, a rim sherd with diagonal incisions,
another rim sherd from a carinated bowl with
diagonal incisions, and a single plain Europeanmanufactured whiteware sherd worked into a disc;
such discs are commonly noted on Antebellum
era settlements in the region. These demonstrate
prehistoric occupation of parts of 41RR243 during

Paleoindian, Late Archaic, Woodland, and Caddo
(probably Early-Middle Caddo period) times, with
subsequent use of the site in the 19th century.
41RR244
Site 41RR244 is immediately north of
41RR242, on the same Holocene alluvial ridge or
natural levee formed by the Red River. A cursory
surface inspection of the site by the 1991 TAS
survey team noted both historic and prehistoric artifacts over about 1000 m2 of the landform, but no
apparent concentrations of artifacts were recorded.
No shovel tests were excavated at 41RR244 during
the 1991 season.
The small 1991 collection of artifacts from
41RR244 document: (1) a late 19th-early 20th century occupation (probably a sheet yard scatter from
a tenant farmstead) with plain whiteware ceramics
and clear, purple (ca. 1880-World War II), aqua,
and brown bottle glass (n=9), and (2) a prehistoric
component of unknown age. Prehistoric artifacts
collected include seven pieces of lithic debris, four
cores, and three fire-cracked rocks.
This site was revisited in 1992, and another
small surface collection was obtained from the
plowed field along the edge of the ridge or levee.
Again, no shovel testing was conducted during
the survey effort. Lithic debris, fire-cracked rock,
and a dart point blade and tip from a probable Late
Archaic period occupation were obtained from
41RR244.
The horizontal and vertical character of the
prehistoric archeological deposits at site 41RR244
should be delimited as part of assessing its integrity, its potential to contain cultural features, and in
determining if discrete cultural components exist
on the landform. Should this be warranted because
of threats to the site, these tasks can be readily
accomplished by excavating and screening shovel
tests and/or 50 x 50 cm units across the part of the
natural levee where prehistoric materials are present on the surface.
41RR245
This prehistoric site is located on a sandy
pimple mound that is on an alluvial terrace, about
800 m from the current channel of Big Pine Creek.
Currently in pasture, prehistoric lithic debris and
fire-cracked rocks were noted on the surface in
gopher mounds.

240

Texas Archeological Society

Mr. Ernest Roitsch has collected and observed
prehistoric artifacts at the site after rains, but apparently no temporally diagnostic materials have
been noted there. No shovel testing was completed
during the cursory reconnaissance of 41RR245,
and basic information on site extent, depth, and
contextual integrity of any preserved archeological
deposits is needed to assess the historical significance of the site.
41RR246
From information provided by Mr. Ernest
Roitsch, site 41RR246 appears to have been occupied
during the Late Caddo McCurtain phase, as shelltempered pottery, daub, and lithic debris is scattered
over about 5000 m2 of the natural levee that parallels
Salt Well Slough. No artifacts were collected, and no
concentrations were noted across the surface. The
slough is ca. 50-100 m from the site itself.
It is likely that 41RR246 is closely related to
the other Late Caddo farmsteads (such as 41RR201
and 41RR202) and salt processing sites (such as
Salt Well Slough [41RR204], 41RR248, 41RR256,
and 41RR257) that extend for more than 1 km
along the west side of Salt Well Slough (see Kenmotsu 2006). It warrants further investigations—
shovel testing, systematic surface collections after
site plowing, and controlled excavations if intact
archeological deposits are identified—as part of a
study of the Late Caddo community at the Roitsch
site, as well as the broader Mound Prairie area
(cf. Bruseth et al. 1991, 1992; Perttula, ed., this
volume).
41RR247
Site 41RR247 is probably a Late Prehistoric
Caddo site, based on information reported to the
TAS survey crew by Mr. Ernest Roitsch. It is in an
old cultivated field, on a narrow projection of an
alluvial terrace dissected by Pond Creek; the creek
is 300 m south of the site. Prehistoric ceramics
and lithic debris and tools are apparent at the site
after each plowing, but no collections are currently
available to characterize the temporal span of
occupation. Given its proximity to the many Caddo
prehistoric sites present along Salt Well Slough,
and the lower courses of Pond Creek and Big Pine
Creek (in the vicinity of 41RR102 and 41RR103),
site 41RR247 warrants further investigation to
determine if intact Caddo archeological deposits are

present that may contain important archeological
information on Caddo lifeways.
41RR248
This site was originally reported to the 1991
TAS survey crews by Ernest Roitsch. He had noted
a concentration of prehistoric ceramics on an alluvial knoll overlooking Salt Well Slough. During the
1992 season, one of the TAS survey crews located
and documented the site.
Site 41RR248 is principally a dense scatter of
McCurtain phase Late Caddo period ceramics and
daub/burned clay spread over about 3 acres of a
plowed alluvial knoll; Salt Well Slough is ca. 100
m east of the site. A small concentration of 20th
century refined earthenware, stoneware, bottle
glass, and other items (n=54 artifacts) was also
noted at the extreme south end of the site (Figure
54), including a shell button (Figure 55a) and a
shotgun cartridge. A whiteware maker’s mark of
“W P La Belle China” is from a plate made by
the Wheeling Pottery Co. between ca. 1893-1910
(Kovel and Kovel 1986).
Over 2700 shell-tempered McCurtain phase
pottery sherds (ca. 900 surface sherds per acre),
about 80 pieces of daub/burned clay, five pieces
of lithic debris, three grinding slab fragments, four
fire-cracked rock, and a few pieces of animal bone
and mussel shell, were recovered in a controlled
surface collection of the plowed field (see Appendix
II). Shovel tests documented archeological deposits
at least 31 cm in thickness in a Late Holocene alluvial clayey sediment, and thick concentrations of
large shell-tempered sherds (n=58, along with a few
pieces of daub and animal bone) were encountered
in Shovel Test #2 (see Figure 54) between ca. 15-31
cm in depth. The soil was too saturated, and the density of sherds too thick, to carry the shovel testing
to the depth of the subsoil.
The Late Caddo archeological materials from
the site closely resemble those recovered in excavations at the Salt Well Slough site, which appears to
be a salt making site used after ca. A.D. 1300 (Kenmotsu 2006). There, massive quantities of utilitarian
Nash Neck Banded and Emory Punctated-Incised
jars and other sherds (more than 21,000 sherds or
more than 1000 per m2) were found in association
with large areas of burned soil and daub that are the
residues of boiling the water from Salt Well Slough
to make salt for the Late Caddo inhabitants of the
Mound Prairie area on Red River. No salt pans were

Perttula—Survey of the Roitsch Farm and Adjoining Lands, 1991–1992 241
decorated sherds are from fine wares (i.e.,
engraved and red-slipped specimens); the
remainder are from relatively thin (5.31 +
1.45 mm) shell-tempered utility ware jars
with everted rims.
Two other salt making sites were
recorded during the 1992 TAS survey
of Salt Well Slough: 41RR256 and
41RR257. These lie between the Salt
Well Slough site (41RR204) and site
41RR248.

used at the sites, in contrast to some Late Caddo salt
making sites in Northwest Louisiana and Southwest
Arkansas (cf. Early 1993; Girard 2006).
At 41RR248, the decorated shell-tempered
ceramics primarily consist of Nash Neck Banded
rim (n=83) and body (n=42) sherds (constituting 79
percent of the 158 decorated sherds from the site)
(Figure 56a-d), Emory Punctated-Incised (n=7)
(Figure 56e, g), and Avery Engraved (n=8), along
with plain red-slipped rim and body sherds (n=8);
the one rim has straight walls and a rounded lip.
Of the Nash Neck Banded rims, approximately 40
percent have everted profiles with rounded and flat
lips, and the remainder have relatively straight rim
profiles with rounded lips. There are also 41 plain
rims with primarily rounded or folded lips, one engraved sherd with a single line, six sherds with appliqued strips, one diagonal incised body sherd, and
two appliqued-punctated body sherd (possibly also
Emory Punctated-Incised) (see Figure 38a, d, f). The
decorated sherds comprise 5.6 percent of the sherd
assemblage (n=2825), and only 10.8 percent of the

41RR249
Located on a small alluvial rise
in a wheat field above an intermittent
tributary of Big Pine Creek, this late
19th century farmstead site was reported
to the TAS by Mr. Ernest Roitsch.
Although surface visibility was poor (<
5 percent), hand-made bricks, whiteware
ceramics, and bottle glass sherds from
hand-blown and semi-automatic (ca.
1880-1903) manufactured bottles were
visible on the surface over a ca. 1000
m2 area. One concentration of bricks
may represent the remnants of a house
foundation or a chimney fall.
Due to limited available time, no
shovel testing was completed at the site
to evaluate the character of its archeological deposits. This should be done to assess its

historical significance, in conjunction with archival
and historical research to help determine who its
occupants were, and when they settled the property.

41RR250
The site is in a pasture on a small, eroded knoll
along a tributary to Big Pine Creek, which is about
800 m to the north. A few prehistoric artifacts were
noted on the knoll surface, and three pieces of
lithic debris and one animal bone were collected
from an unspecified surface provenience; the total
size of the site has not been determined. One of the
two shovel tests excavated at 41RR250 contained
a piece of lithic debris and part of a grinding slab
fragment between 30-40 cm bs; the total thickness
of the sandy loam A-horizon at 41RR250 was about
60 cm. The limited quantity of artifacts found at
this site, and the equivocal information obtained
from the shovel testing on the age, context, and
integrity of the deposits, suggest that additional
shovel testing is warranted at a future date to better
characterize these archeological deposits.

41RR251, Tarrant #1
The Tarrant #1 site was reported to the TAS
by Mr. Larry Banks (then at Southern Methodist
University, Dallas, Texas). Banks described the site
as a Woodland period midden containing thick grogtempered ceramics (Williams Plain?), lithic debris,
and chipped stone tools. The reported site location
is on an alluvial terrace overlooking the floodplain
at the confluence of the Kiamichi and Red rivers.
The Northeast Texas Archeological Society
relocated the Tarrant #1 site during their 1993-1994
survey of the Tarrant Farm (see Nelson, Turner,
and Perttula, article; see also Nelson et al. 1995).
However, the poor surface visibility limited the
amount of investigations conducted there, and no
surface collections were obtained.
The known artifact collections from the site
should be studied and photo-documented when the
opportunity arises. Currently, there are few known and
discrete Woodland period midden components in this
part of the Red River valley (cf. Perttula et al. 1993).
Thus, further investigations are warranted at 41RR251
to acquire archeological information to better
understand regional Woodland period adaptations.

Perttula—Survey of the Roitsch Farm and Adjoining Lands, 1991–1992 243
41RR252
Mr. Larry Banks also reported this prehistoric
site to the TAS Field School in 1992. Unfortunately, the TAS survey crews were unable to complete
any survey work on private land in the area of the
site, which is about 2.8 km southwest of the Fasken
Mound site (41RR14).
Site 41RR252 is reported by Mr. Banks to be
an Early Caddo period settlement. It is situated on
the edge of a broad alluvial terrace a short distance
from the current channel of the Red River. Caddo
sites of similar age have been recorded during the
TAS Field School in the vicinity of the Fasken site
(i.e., 41RR206 and 41RR209). This site should be
relocated, any collections from the site need to be
photo-documented, and subsurface investigations
should be completed to assess its integrity as well
as its archeological character.
41RR253, the Bob and Bret Show
Site 41RR253 is one of several late 19th century to early to mid-20th century archeological sites
recorded in the area between Pond Creek and Big
Pine Creek. The Bob and Bret Show site is along a
fence line in a relatively flat plowed field.
The relatively dispersed archeological materials, including bottle glass, ceramics, and metal
fragments (n=70), were collected over an 800 m2
area. Among the ceramics are plain whiteware, a
plain porcelain sherd, one late 19th century rim
with relief-molded dots, and lead-glazed and saltglazed stoneware. Two of the bottle glass sherds
are from brown glass snuff containers, and the
remainder of the machine-made glass is clear,
purple, brown, aqua, and milk glass (see Appendix III). These historic artifacts probably are trash
deposits associated with an abandoned structure a
short distance to the north along the same fence
line. Two pieces of quartzite lithic debris were also
recovered in the surface collection, indicating a
minimal prehistoric use of the landform. Because
of the saturated clays on site, standing water, and
the recent age of the archeological deposits, no
shovel tests were excavated at 41RR253 as part of
the recordation process.
41RR254
This is a small (ca. 860 m2) and apparently
sparse prehistoric archeological deposit on the flat

alluvial terrace between Pond Creek, Salt Well
Slough, and Big Pine Creek; Pond Creek is about
300 m to the north.
A few pieces of lithic debris and quartzite
hammerstone fragments were observed in eroded
areas of the pasture, along with a metal chain link.
As the surface visibility was about 50 percent in
the pasture, it seems probable that the site has only
a very low density of (temporally undiagnostic)
lithic artifacts. No shovel testing was conducted
on the site, but as it has been plowed, and it is
situated in an area with a generally quite shallow
(ca. 10-20 cm) and gravelly A-horizon, there is
little likelihood that intact archeological deposits
are preserved at 41RR254.
41RR255
Twentieth century foundations and a scattering
of historic artifacts were noted over a 1500 m2 area
on an eroded knoll of an alluvial terrace facing a
broad and flat lower terrace that ends at Salt Well
Slough. These archeological materials are along an
old farm road and fence line between Pond Creek
and Big Pine Creek. Site 41RR253 is several hundred
meters to the south along the same fence line. The
site probably represents an abandoned farmstead.
No shovel tests were conducted at 41RR255
because of the relatively recent age of the historic
occupation. For similar reasons, no surface collections were obtained from the site. The site has
little archeological potential, and does not warrant
further archeological investigations.
41RR256, Howard Williams
Property Block
The Howard Williams Property Block site
is part of the large complex of Late Caddo, McCurtain phase, salt processing sites (including Salt
Well Slough [41RR204], 41RR248, 41RR256, and
41RR257) that extend for about 800 m along Salt
Well Slough (see Figure 2). Site 41RR256 is on a
large plowed knoll (ca. 15,600 m2) approximately 100
m west of Salt Well Slough; the site sediments are a
dense black Desha clay. Shovel testing of the black
clay at the site documented archeological deposits at
least 18 cm in thickness with an abundance of large
shell-tempered pottery sherds (Figure 57).
A surface collection of the site by one of the 1992
TAS survey crews recovered 217 shell-tempered
sherds (principally plain body sherds probably from

Nash Neck Banded jars), including four plain rims
(everted with rounded lips) and one Nash Neck
Banded everted rim sherd. This is a surface density of
ca. 50 sherds per acre, approximately 18 times lower
in density than at 41RR248 (see above). This suggests
a fairly non-intensive salt making use at 41RR256
by comparison with either the Salt Well Slough site
or 41RR248. Daub or burned clay (n=9), four pieces
of poorly preserved animal bone, a grinding slab
fragment and two hammerstones, and one lithic core
comprise the remainder of the prehistoric artifact
assemblage in the 41RR256 surface collection. The
limited range of artifact classes (i.e., almost exclusively [93 percent] pottery sherds, daub, and/or fired
clay) at site 41RR256 is consistent with the types of
artifacts found at the other salt processing sites (see
discussion in Kenmotsu 2006). Three historic 20th
century plain whiteware sherds from the site represent
the casual discard of historic trash in the area.
Along with the other salt processing sites on
Salt Well Slough, site 41RR256 represents an important archeological resource that warrants preservation and protection. Test excavations should be
conducted at the site to document the settlement and
feature plans, determine specifically the chronologi-

cal span of the occupation (i.e., when salt processing
became important to the agricultural McCurtain
phase Caddo [see Perttula 1993, 1996; Kenmotsu
2006]), and gather pertinent information on how
the Caddos produced salt for local consumption and
trade. This work would be an important facet of a
regional study of prehistoric and historic Caddo salt
processing, and a particular focus of archeological
planning for the Eastern Planning Region of Texas
(e.g., Kenmotsu and Perttula 1993).
41RR257
This Late Caddo salt processing site is situated on the edge of an alluvial terrace, about 100
m from Salt Well Slough. It covers about 8400 m2
of a currently plowed field, but has archeological
deposits (large shell-tempered sherds and daub) in
excess of 15 cm in depth; large sherds were visible
in the walls of three shovel tests (Figure 58).
A controlled surface collection of the site
area was conducted by one of the 1992 TAS
survey crews, and a large quantity of Late Caddo
cultural materials was collected from a 20 x 30
m area where sherds and daub were particularly

Perttula—Survey of the Roitsch Farm and Adjoining Lands, 1991–1992 245
a pocket knife and a 1937 penny); they
are not associated with a farmstead,
however, and are presumably trash
discards.
Site 41RR257 warrants further
investigations as part of a regional
study of Caddo salt processing. It has
abundant material remains, and apparently in situ archeological deposits,
and should contribute significant new
information on the Late Caddo saltmakers in the Red River valley.
41RR258

concentrated. Recovered in the surface collection
were 756 McCurtain phase shell-tempered sherds
(principally from large jars), 30 pieces of daub or
burned clay, four fire-cracked rock, one animal
bone, and three pieces of lithic debris. Among the
sherds are six plain jar rims (everted with rounded
lips), one Emory Punctated-Incised body sherd,
and three Nash Neck Banded rim and body sherds.
The percentage of decorated sherds is 0.5 percent,
much lower than at the Salt Well Slough site or
41RR248. The surface sherd density across the
entire site is ca. 380 sherds per acre, intermediate
between the surface sherd density at the other two
salt making sites recorded during the TAS Field
School (41RR248: 900 sherds per acre; 41RR256:
50 sherds per acre).
Again, the prehistoric assemblage from 41RR256
is consistent with the other known salt processing
sites along Salt Well Slough. The few historic artifacts recovered (n=6) date after ca. 1937 (including

This is a multi-component prehistoric and historic site on a small
knoll of a Holocene terrace that overlooks Pond Creek, about 250 m to the
north. The site covers about 1200 m2
of the knoll, and the site limits were
defined from the surface distribution
of historic and prehistoric artifacts in
the pasture. No shovel tests were excavated at 41RR258, but based upon
other sites in the area, and the type of
soil (described in the field notes as a
dark brown to black loam or clay), the
archeological deposits are probably
less than 30-40 cm in thickness and
they have subjected to clearing and
past cultivation.
A surface collection recovered 34 historic and
six prehistoric artifacts, and one animal bone, at
41RR258. The historic artifacts include plain and
decorated (relief-molded and decalcomania) whiteware and porcelain ceramics, Bristol-glazed stoneware, bottle glass (clear, blue, and brown), milk
glass, tin can fragments, machine-made bricks,
and a glass marble from a ca. 1900-1940 period
occupation or trash deposit; no house or structure
foundations were noted at the site. The prehistoric
artifacts were undiagnostic lithic debris (n=5) and
a bifacial preform fragment (of claystone/siltstone)
that may be a remnant of an Archaic period dart
projectile point.
41RR259
Site 41RR259 is on a prominent, linear sandy
rise about 380 feet amsl between Pond Creek (to
the north) and Salt Well Slough (to the east). Unlike

246

Texas Archeological Society

other areas slightly lower in elevation that have deposits of more recent black clay (as at the Salt Well
Slough site and other salt processing sites along Salt
Well Slough), the rise at 41RR259 has a generally
shallow and gravelly sandy loam A-horizon that
overlies a reddish-brown clay B-horizon.
Shovel testing disclosed prehistoric archeological deposits from ca. 0-10 cm bs over a 2600
m2 area. Two of five shovel tests excavated at
41RR259 contained low densities of lithic debris
(mean=3.0 artifacts per positive shovel test), and
no apparent concentrations of prehistoric artifacts
were observed on the rise. The uncontrolled surface
collection from the site recovered 53 lithic debris,
one fire-cracked rock, one mussel shell (probably
modern), an Ogallala quartzite biface preform, and
two bifacial tool fragments of Ogallala quartzite
and claystone/siltstone, along with a Woodland
period Gary, var. Camden dart point of claystone/
siltstone, a dart point blade of quartzitic sandstone,
and a dart point tip.
These remains appear to be from a probable
Woodland period occupation at the site (based on
the var. Camden point, dated by Schambach [1982]
to ca. A.D. 200-700), based on the kinds of dart projectile points from surface provenience. Occupations
of similar age tend to be widely distributed along
Big Pine Creek and its surrounding uplands, rather
than on the active floodplain areas of the Red River
where post- A.D. 800 Caddo materials are well represented in surface contexts, but earlier Archaic and
Woodland period materials are notably absent. The
latter materials are presumably deeply buried in Red
River alluvium on the active floodplains, and sites of
such nature need to be identified and documented to
clearly develop an understanding of the settlement
and land use patterns of Late Archaic and Woodland
period groups in the Mound Prairie area.
Site 41RR259 possesses little archeological
integrity, and almost no potential for preserved
cultural features because of the shallow deposits.
The limited surface reconnaissance also identified
no horizontal concentrations of cultural materials.
Based on these characteristics, the site warrants no
further investigations at the present time.
41RR260
This prehistoric site is located in a flat overgrown
pasture about 200 m west of an intermittent tributary
that drains north into Big Pine Creek. A low density
of artifacts were visible on the surface, and a prob-

able Late Archaic Williams dart projectile point of a
lustrous Red River gravel chert (see Figure 34b) was
collected in a dirt road that crosses the site. Shovel
testing on both sides of the dirt road located a Late
Archaic Yarbrough projectile point (see Figure 34e)
and a mano fragment about 17 cm bs in one shovel
test (Shovel Test #5); the other five excavated at
the site were sterile. Ernest Roitsch indicated to
the TAS survey crew that he found a ground stone
celt in the vicinity of 41RR260.
Because of the low artifact density at 41RR260,
the surface and subsurface extent of the archeological
deposits has not been determined. Shovel tests,
however, indicate a sandy loam A-horizon about 20
cm thick overlying a clay B-horizon that extends to at
least 60 cm bs. The archeological deposits are likely
restricted to the thin A-horizon sediments. While it
appears that 41RR260 was occupied during the Late
Archaic period, the sparse and shallow nature of the
deposits suggest that cultural features or interpretable
temporal or spatial patterns of material culture
remains are unlikely to exist at the site.
41RR261, Williamson-Weldon Site
The Williamson-Weldon site is one of three
small archeological deposits clustered on sandy
knolls near the headwaters of an intermittent
tributary that drains southeast to Big Pine Creek.
Williamson-Weldon covers about 500 m2 of one
knoll. Shovel testing on the knoll documented
shallow (< 20 cm) loamy sands over B-horizon
clays; the site has been previously plowed.
The surface collection of Gary and cornernotched (see Figure 31a) dart projectile points indicate that the site was used during the Late Archaic
and/or Woodland periods, but an Early to Middle
Caddo occupation(s) is probably represented by five
plain grog- and grog-bone-tempered sherds, including
two with interior-exterior red-slipped surfaces. Also
retrieved from the surface collection were 38 pieces
of lithic debris, one biface preform of quartzitic
sandstone, one battered chert cobble, one fire-cracked
rock, and 10 pieces of historic 20th century green
bottle glass and plain whiteware ceramics.
Two of the five shovel tests at 41RR261 contained only three pieces of lithic debris about 10
cm bs, but the extent of the deposits was not determined. While artifacts were relatively common
on the surface, shovel testing at 41RR261 clearly
suggests that it has only sparse subsurface archeological remains (of either prehistoric or historic

Perttula—Survey of the Roitsch Farm and Adjoining Lands, 1991–1992 247
age). The shallow nature of the deposits also suggests that the site lacks integrity.
41RR262
Site 41RR262 is about 90 m east of 41RR261,
and approximately 100 m west of 41RR263. Based
on the surface evidence of cultural materials, and
the landform, the site covers ca. 250 m2 of a sandy
knoll near a southeasterly-draining tributary to Big
Pine Creek. It is currently in a pasture, but the area
has been previously plowed.
Five shovel tests on the knoll failed to identify
any subsurface archeological deposits. However, the
loamy sand A-horizon at 41RR262 is a maximum
of 35 cm in thickness, suggesting that very sparse
archeological materials may still be preserved at the
site. Fairly good surface exposure on the site knoll
revealed no apparent concentrations of prehistoric
cultural materials, although one parallel-stemmed
dart projectile point (see Figure 34f, a style of dart
point common in the Late Archaic in Northeast Texas
[Story 1990:Figure 32]), 13 pieces of lithic debris, one
biface preform fragment, a battered quartzite cobble,
one animal bone, and three plain grog-tempered ceramic sherds were collected by the TAS survey crew.
Based on this recovery, site 41RR262 was probably
sporadically used during both the Late Archaic and
Woodland periods, but there is little likelihood that
significant archeological deposits are present at the
site that could contribute important information on
current Northeast Texas research problems (cf. Kenmotsu and Perttula 1993:69-187).
41RR263
Site 41RR263 covers about 250 m2 of a third
knoll along the intermittent tributary of Big Pine
Creek. Recorded during a driving thunderstorm, a
low density of prehistoric artifacts was noted on
the surface of the knoll. Five shovel tests were excavated across the knoll, but they failed to identify
subsurface archeological deposits on the landform.
Like 41RR261 and 41RR262, this site has a fairly
shallow loamy sand A-horizon over a clay B-horizon. The lack of intact archeological deposits, and
the sparse archeological materials recovered from
41RR263, indicate that the site does not now have
research potential, and further work at the site does
not seem warranted.
A systematic artifact surface collection was
obtained from 41RR263, because surface visibility

was good despite the standing water. However,
only a limited array of prehistoric artifacts was
present, including 38 pieces of lithic debris, four
fire-cracked rocks, four dart projectile points, and
a blade fragment of an unidentified arrow point
(possibly an arrow point preform). Represented
among the dart points were three fairly wide and
thick Gary points (Gary var. Gary) (see Figure 31g
and Figure 34d), and a resharpened specimen with
a broad, parallel stem and small barbs (see Figure
34h). Although the number of absolute dates of
Archaic projectile points in Northeast Texas is very
limited (cf. Story 1990; Fields and Tomka 1993),
these darts probably are best indicative of sporadic
use of the site during the Late Archaic.
41RR264
This site appears to represent the remnants of a
late 19th-early 20th century farmstead. It is located
in a flat, plowed field along a dirt road that runs between Salt Well Slough and Pond Creek, and may be
associated with the cluster of historic 20th century
farmsteads (41RR215, 41RR222-41RR227, and
41RR229) a short distance to the south along Pond
Creek; these correspond to a community of tenant
farmers reported in the area in the 1920s-1930s (A.
E. Roitsch, 1991 personal communication).
Site 41RR264 covers approximately 200 m2. A
small collection of late 19th-20th century ceramic
and bottle glass sherds (n=22) was collected from
the surface during the TAS survey, including
three floral relief-molded whiteware rim sherds
(popular after ca. 1870-1880 [see Majewski and
O’Brien 1987:155 and Figure 4d-e]), brown snuff
glass, and a machine-made brick fragment (see
Appendix III). The presence of intact archeological
deposits and/or features was not determined as
no shovel testing was conducted, but given the
deep plowing, the recent age of the deposits,
and the basically non-aggrading landform, it is
quite unlikely that archeological deposits with
any integrity are preserved at 41RR264. Thus, no
further archeological investigations are warranted
at this historic site.
41RR265
This predominantly late 19th-early 20th century archeological site is on a gently sloping alluvial terrace overlooking the current channel of
Big Pine Creek, about 600 m upstream from the

248

Texas Archeological Society

confluence of Big Pine Creek and Salt Well Slough.
A small amount of lithic debris (n=6) and daub
(n=4) denotes the prehistoric use of the landform,
probably in Late Prehistoric (Late Caddo?) times.
The soil is the Late Holocene black Desha clay
alluvial deposit that mantles the Salt Well Slough
and lower Big Pine Creek drainage basins.
The site itself covers about 2.5 acres of the alluvial terrace, with a relatively dense concentration
of artifacts (faunal remains, bottle glass, refined
earthenwares [whitewares], and stonewares) near
the crest of the terrace and larger metal objects
(i.e., plow parts and horse shoes) at the south end
where there are remnants of a concrete barn foundation. Some 369 historic artifacts were recovered
from a surface collection at 41RR265, including 10
pieces of animal bone (probably cow).
Among the artifacts are wire nails, horse/mule
nails, one horseshoe, two shell casings, 166 bottle
glass sherds, and 167 ceramics. Clear, brown, and
purple (1880-World War I) bottle glass sherds
are most common, along with brown snuff glass
(n=10), and hand-applied (ca. 1880) and semiautomatic (ca. 1880-1903) manufactured bottle
lips. There are also four aqua paneled bottle glass
sherds, and another 18 sherds with embossed markings/lettering; these are from bitters and medicinal
bottles made between ca. 1860-1900 (Switzer
1974). Of the 116 whiteware and porcelain sherds,
all are plain with the exception of three rims with
relief-molded floral motifs. One whiteware maker’s

a

mark is from the Goodwin Pottery Co. of East
Liverpool, Ohio (1872-1913), and another has
the Royal Arms of a British manufacturer (dating
after 1837) (Godden 1964; Kovel and Kovel 1986)
(Figure 59b-c).
The stoneware sherds are dominated by leadglazed and salt-glazed pieces, dating generally
after 1875, as well as natural clay-slipped sherds.
Twentieth century Bristol-glazed stoneware sherds
comprise 20 percent of the stoneware sherds, including three sherds with either a lead-glazed or
natural clay-slipped interiors (ca. 1875-1920).
No shovel tests were excavated in the dense
and saturated black clay, but based on shovel
tests and excavations conducted at other sites in
this same area, it is conceivable that about 30 cm
of archeological deposits are preserved at site
41RR265. If this is an accurate assessment, shovel
testing should be conducted at the site to determine
the presence and location of intact historic and/or
prehistoric archeological deposits and features.
41RR266
Site 41RR266 has both prehistoric and historic
archeological remains covering ca. 500 m2 of an
alluvial knoll along an intermittent stream in the
Big Pine Creek valley. The site is about 100 m from
Big Pine Creek itself.
Both prehistoric and historic archeological
materials were visible in eroded areas in a pasture,

and substantial quantities of 19th century artifacts
(pre-1880 in age) were also recovered to depths
of 26 cm in limited shovel testing at the northern
end of the site (Figure 60). The shovel testing
also documented that historic midden deposits are
preserved in the sandy loam A-horizon sediments
at 41RR266. Modern structural remains (concrete
foundations) were noted at the southern end of the
site, but no surface collecting activities or shovel
tests were conducted in that area.
The prehistoric materials recovered in the
surface collection included only two plain sherds
(one grog-tempered and one shell-tempered),
probably from a sparse pre- and post-A.D. 1300
Caddo use of the Big Pine Creek valley. The
historic artifacts (n=73) from the site include six
square nails, bottle glass (clear, aqua, and brown;
see Figure 45a), refined earthenwares (handpainted and relief-molded), stone-wares (two
salt-glazed/lead-glazed), daub (n=28) probably
from a mud cat chimney, and six pieces of animal
bone (artifacts from surface collection=36; Shovel
Test #1=16; and Shovel Test #2=21). Among the
recovered artifacts was a whiteware maker’s mark
reading “...STONE CH...”
This is clearly an important 19th century his-

toric archeological site in that it contains intact
archeological deposits and a midden feature from
a relatively early (i.e., pre-1880) Anglo-American
farmstead in this part of the Red River valley.
Further investigations are certainly warranted
in conjunction with the historical, archival, and
archeological study of the settlement of the Jonesborough site and immediate region (see Perttula
and Reese 2001; Reese 2001). Additional shovel
testing should also be conducted to determine if
more substantial prehistoric archeological deposits
are preserved at 41RR266.
41RR267
Site 41RR267 is situated along a dissected alluvial terrace along the south side of the Big Pine
Creek valley, not far downstream from 41RR266.
The site itself covers at a minimum about 100 m2
of the terrace, and was found by the TAS survey
crew because of the sparse scatter of prehistoric
(one plain shell-tempered sherd and one piece of
lithic debris) and late 19th-early 20th century historic (n=15) artifacts on the surface; ground surface
visibility ranged between 30-40 percent across the
site. The historic artifacts include clear and blue

bottle glass, late 19th century clear chimney glass,
two glass sherds with embossed markings, and two
decorated whiteware sherds (relief-molded and
blue transfer-printed)
Five shovel tests were excavated at 41RR267,
and two of them contained artifacts in a sandy loam
A-horizon between 0-15 cm bs; the A-horizon continued to about 35 cm bs. The first contained a single
piece of unidentifiable metal at 5 cm bs, while the
other had a plain shell-tempered sherd and one firecracked rock between 0-15 cm bs.
Based on the results of both the surface
collections and the shovel testing, it appears that
the site contains, at best, only sparse surface and
subsurface archeological deposits of probable
Late Caddo, McCurtain phase and historic late
19th-early 20th century age. No cultural features
were noted in the limited investigations, and the
depositional context suggests it is unlikely that
features will be preserved at 41RR267. The site
warrants no further attention at this time.

41RR268
This is a probable small (500 m2) Late Caddo
habitation site located on a knoll of an alluvial
terrace along Big Pine Creek. The current channel
is about 500 m south of 41RR268, but channel
scars in the floodplain of the creek indicate that it
flowed much closer to the site at an earlier time.
A natural spring is present 200 m east of the site
(Figure 61).
Investigations conducted at 41RR268 first
included a cursory surface inspection, and one
quartzite hammerstone, six pieces of lithic debris,
and a Maud arrow point of Ogallala quartzite (see
Figure 31c) were collected from the surface. Three
shovel tests were excavated at the site to better
define the depth and extent of the archeological
deposits, and all three contained prehistoric artifacts between ca. 10-50 cm bs in a sandy loam
sediment. Recovered in the shovel testing were 11
pieces of lithic debris, 15 shell-tempered sherds,
and charcoal fragments (from Shovel Test #3) that

Perttula—Survey of the Roitsch Farm and Adjoining Lands, 1991–1992 251
probably relate to a Late Caddo period habitation
or farmstead. Among the shell-tempered sherds is a
plain everted jar rim and a small rim with a portion
of an incised line below the lip. There are also three
plain grog-tempered sherds from Shovel Test #1,
which may or may not be associated with the Late
Caddo component at 41RR268.
No features or midden deposits were observed
in the limited investigations. However, the depth
of the deposit (and its seemingly intact nature),
as well as the probable single component Caddo
use of the site, strongly suggest that the site has
the potential to contain important information on
the Late Caddo settlement of the Mound Prairie
area. Further investigations (i.e., more shovel tests
and controlled test excavations) are warranted at
41RR268 to clarify its integrity, and better determine whether cultural features and significant
archeological deposits are preserved at the site.
41RR269
A small surface scatter (600 m2) of prehistoric
lithic debris on the edge of an alluvial terrace of Big
Pine Creek marks site 41RR269. Big Pine Creek runs
east-west by the site, about 400 m to the south.
Recovered on the surface were six pieces of
temporally undiagnostic lithic debris in gopher
mounds in an overgrown pasture. Two shovel tests
were excavated to depths of 25 cm bs at 41RR269,
but neither contained any prehistoric or historic archeological materials. While the possibility exists
that subsurface prehistoric archeological deposits
may be present below 25 cm (i.e., because the
sandy loam A-horizon may be 50 cm or more in
thickness), the sparse surface evidence of prehistoric use and the lack of archeological materials
between 0-25 cm suggests that 41RR269 does not
contain intact and/or interpretable archeological
deposits with research value.
41RR270
Site 41RR270 is on a floodplain knoll of Big
Pine Creek. The current channel of Big Pine Creek
is about 450 m to the north.
The TAS survey conducted very limited investigations at the site, consisting of a cursory surface
reconnaissance of the knoll and surrounding area,
as well as the excavation of a single shovel test on
the knoll itself. One plain shell-tempered sherd,
three pieces of lithic debris, and charcoal fragments

were recovered in sandy loam deposits between
50-70 cm bs in this shovel test. The presence of
buried archeological materials, and the recovery of
a Caddo sherd, suggests that a small Late Caddo,
McCurtain phase settlement is preserved on the
knoll. To investigate the character of the archeological remains from 41RR270, and define the vertical and horizontal extent of the site, further shovel
tests should be excavated on the knoll to retrieve
this information. In the meantime, we recommend
that the site be protected by the landowner.
41RR271
This site has both prehistoric and historic components. It is situated along the edge of an alluvial
terrace paralleling Big Pine Creek, about 700 m
away, and covers about 20,000 m2 (5 acres). An
old channel of Big Pine Creek is only 130 m to the
south of 41RR271.
No concentrations of prehistoric or historic
artifacts were apparent on the surface, but surface
visibility was poor. Seven shovel tests were excavated at 41RR271; however, no subsurface archeological deposits were identified in any of them. The
lack of intact archeological remains means the site
likely has no potential to address important Northeast Texas prehistoric and/or historic archeological
research problems.
In eroded areas and gopher mounds, however,
early 20th century bottle glass, whiteware, stonewares, bricks, and metals were collected (n=60 artifacts), and concrete blocks from a structure were
noted at the south end of the site. The bottle glass
is dominated by clear and brown glass sherds, one
purple (1880-World War I) glass sherd, and a clear
glass sherd with embossed letters. The whiteware
is plain, except for one late 19th century reliefmolded rim. The three stoneware sherds include
one Bristol-glazed with cobalt (dated ca. 1920, see
Greer 1981), one lead-glazed, and one salt-glazed
with an Albany-glazed interior (ca. 1875-1900).
There are also four tin can fragments, a metal latch,
and a horse/mule shoe. These artifacts probably
represent the accumulation of sheet or yard midden
deposits around the structure (cf. Moir 1987).
Prehistoric artifacts retrieved in the TAS
surface collection include 12 pieces of lithic debris,
one Gary projectile point (var. LeFlore?), and an
unidentified parallel-stemmed dart point fragment
of novaculite from a probable Late Archaic or
Woodland period use of the alluvial terrace. The

TARRANT AND WRIGHT FARM
SURVEYS
Bo Nelson, Mike Turner, and
Timothy K. Perttula
This section of Part II describes the prehistoric
and historic archeological sites identified during
a February 1993 archeological survey completed
by the Northeast Texas Archeological Society
(NETAS), under the sponsorship of the Texas
Historical Commission, as an addendum to the
1991-1992 TAS surveys along the Red River
(see also Nelson et al. 1995). Ms. Linda Tarrant,
who attended the 1991 and 1992 Field Schools,
requested that we conduct an archeological survey
of the Tarrant Farm lands along the Red River near
the mouth of the Kiamichi River to determine if any
significant prehistoric and/or historic archeological
sites were on the property. Bo Nelson and Mike
Turner agreed to lead the survey effort for NETAS,
under the supervision of the THC, and complete the
site forms for submission to TARL.
While the NETAS survey crews were completing the Tarrant Farm survey, Mr. Richard Wright
of the Wright Farm (which immediately adjoins
the Tarrant Farm and is located across from the
mouth of the Kiamichi River) gave permission for
the crews to also examine certain portions of their
lands to identify prehistoric and historic archeological sites. This provided an excellent opportunity to
locate Caddoan sites that may be associated with
the Wright Plantation mound site (41RR7), and
possibly identify the ca. 1825 Cherokee village of
Tahchee reported to have been on the Red River
near the mouth of the Kiamichi River (Everett
1990:34, 51). Early 19th century cultural materials
(including European ceramics, gun parts, and glass
beads) collected in the 1960s by R. King Harris
at Wright Plantation (presently being curated at
the Smithsonian Institution, National Museum of
Natural History, but photographs of the materials
are on file at the Archeology Division at the THC)
suggested that archeological remains associated
with the Cherokee village may indeed be present
on the Tarrant Farm. A limited reconnaissance was
thus completed of Wright Farm lands during the
1993 NETAS survey.

During the survey effort, no shovel testing was
done at any of the sites at the request of the landowners. Also, at the request of the Wright family,
no surface collections were taken at archeological
sites on their property; the Tarrant family gave
permission for surface collections of samples of
prehistoric and/or historic artifacts to be collected
from sites on their lands.
41RR285, Tarrant #2
The Tarrant #2 site has both prehistoric and
historic components. The site itself sits along the
edge of an alluvial terrace overlooking the dissected floodplain at the confluence of the Red and
Kiamichi rivers. A small tributary of the Red River,
probably a remnant of an old channel or slough of
the river, runs at the base of the alluvial terrace
about 200 meters from the site.
The site covers about 7200 m2 of a plowed field
on the alluvial terrace, and surface visibility in the
plowed field was about 80 percent. No particularly
notable concentration of either prehistoric or historic
artifacts were identified during the NETAS survey.
Two prehistoric components are present at
the site, the first a probable Formative or Early
Caddo occupation marked by lithic debris, cores,
fire-cracked rocks, two flake tools, and 20 plain
grog- and grog/bone-tempered ceramics. The
Caddo component probably represents one of
many farmsteads that were once dispersed in the
Red River valley along elevated landforms with
arable soils. Further investigation of this Caddo
component is warranted to determine if contextually intact archeological deposits and features are
preserved at the site that may contain important
research information.
Most of the artifacts visible on the surface of
the plowed field are from a ca. 1870-1950 historic farmstead. The Kiomatia 7.5' 1951 USGS
topographic map indicates a farm structure was
present at 41RR285, although no structural remains were observed in the plowed field. The
types of artifacts present at the farmstead include:
plain whitewares and ironstones, one flown blue
whiteware sherd, ironstones with embossed or
relief-molded rims and decalcomania decorations,
thick window glass, machine-made bricks, plow
parts, cast iron stove or kettle parts, one metal
overall button (“ROUND HOUSE”), a wide variety of purple, clear, blue, and green bottle glass,
and sherds from salt-glazed, lead-glazed, Albany-

Perttula—Survey of the Roitsch Farm and Adjoining Lands, 1991–1992 253
glazed, and Bristol-glazed stoneware crocks and
jars (see Figure 40e; see also Appendix IV). One
whiteware maker’s mark with a Royal Arms and
“...THOMA...” can only be dated to after 1837
(Godden 1964) (see Figure 59a).
41RR286, Tarrant #3
The Tarrant #3 site is also located along the
edge of the Holocene alluvial terrace (demarcated
by the 390 foot contour interval) that cuts across
the Tarrant and Wright Farms. It covers about 2730
m2 of the plowed portion of the landform, and site
surface visibility was excellent.
Most of the prehistoric artifacts probably
relate to a Late Archaic and/or Woodland period
occupation, as indicated by one Gary, var. Gary
dart point on Ogallala quartzite, another dart point
preform, lithic debris (n=16), a fire-cracked rock,
one core or tested cobble, and one hammerstone.
The recovery of four relatively thin and plain grogtempered sherds, as well as another grog-tempered
body sherd with an exterior red slip (probably
Sanders Plain), suggest that a small Middle Caddo
Mound Prairie phase component is also present at
the site. Shovel tests should be conducted at the
site to determine the character of the prehistoric
archeological deposits.
A ca. 1890-1940 historic occupation, probably a tenant farm, at the Tarrant #3 site is represented by plain whiteware and ironstone ceramics
(n=13), two whiteware sherds with decalcomania,
fruit jar milk glass lid liner fragments (n=2),
machine-made brick fragments, and machinemade clear, purple, aqua, green, and brown bottle
glass (n=9). The 1951 USGS 7.5' topographic
map depicts a structure in the same location as
41RR286.
An earlier historic occupation is also present at
the site that is roughly estimated to date between
ca. 1830-1860. It contains decorated whitewares
(n=11), including blue and red transfer-printed,
blue shell-edged (with an even scalloped rim,
dating ca. 1810-1835; see Hunter and Miller
1994:Plate V), and blue broad-line hand-painted
(see Figure 35d, g), and dark olive green wine
bottle glass (n=1). There are also two lead-glazed
redware sherds, which according to Green et al.
(1996:467, 469) “is extremely rare in nineteenth
century archaeological assemblages from northeastern Texas and it generally [was] replaced [by]
stoneware by 1850.”

Because of the small artifact sample size
from this component, none of the early-mid-19th
century artifacts recovered from the site can be
definitively linked with either the Cherokee Village or with an Anglo-American farmstead related
to the settlement of the Wright Plantation (Steely
1982). Clearly, however, this early component
warrants further investigations (e.g., shovel testing
and controlled excavations) to determine if intact
archeological deposits can be identified, and hopefully retrieve additional artifacts and/or features
that can unravel the ethnic and cultural affiliation
of the site occupants.
41RR287, Tarrant #4
The Tarrant #4 site is a short distance north of
41RR286 along the alluvial terrace landform; the
tributary stream or slough/old channel is ca. 150
m to the west below the base of the terrace. The
site is in a plowed field, and based on the surface
distribution of prehistoric and historic artifacts, it
covers approximately 4100 m2.
A probable single prehistoric component of
Woodland period age can be discerned in the
surface collections from the site. It contains lithic
debris (n=4), a tested cobble or core, and several
pieces of fire-cracked quartzite cobbles, along with
a single grog-tempered body sherd.
The Tarrant # 4 site also was occupied in historic times, with the predominant use of the site
between ca. 1890-1940. This occupation, probably
that of a tenant farmstead, is characterized by large
quantities of plain whiteware, porcelain, and ironstone sherds (n=101), fiesta ware, decalcomania
and relief-molded whiteware sherds, ceramic fruit
jar lid liner sherds (n=13), lead-glazed stoneware,
ceramic (see Figure 55b) and glass marbles, a
porcelain animal figurine fragment, and clear,
brown, aqua, blue, and purple bottle and snuff
glass (n=155). Three transfer-printed whiteware
sherds (blue, red, and maroon; see Figure 35c, e),
and one flown blue decorated sherd, as well as saltglazed stoneware (n=7), indicate that the site was
also used sometime between about 1830-1860; it
is not possible to be more specific given the small
and relatively undiagnostic nature of the decorated
whiteware recovered in surface collections from
the site. Future subsurface investigations (i.e.,
systematic shovel testing) could prove profitable
if intact Antebellum archeological deposits can be
located on the Tarrant #4 site.

41RR288, Tarrant #5

This is a large (ca. 12,100 m2), multi-component prehistoric and historic site on an alluvial
terrace that borders a small stream (slough or old
channel) that flows northeast into the Red River.
The site is in a plowed field, and surface visibility
was excellent.
The main component at the Tarrant #5 site
probably dates to the Late Archaic period, based
on the recovery of a Gary, var. Gary dart point (cf.
Schambach 1982) and six large Gary bifacial preforms (see Figure 31h). Other kinds of prehistoric
artifacts likely associated with this Late Archaic
occupation include six other bifacial preforms and
tool fragments, hammerstones (n=2), mano fragments (n=2), sandstone and quartzite fire-cracked
rock (n=43), many cores, core fragments, and
tested cobbles (n=12), retouched pieces, scrapers
and drills (n=14), and probably most of the 299
pieces of lithic debris gathered in the site surface
collection. Later Caddo occupations in the middle
Red River region usually contain low numbers of
lithic tools, other than arrow points and celts (see
Perttula, ed., this volume; Perttula et al. 2001), and
the observed density of lithic debris at Tarrant #5
is more comparable to that documented at Archaic
and Woodland period sites.
This is not to say that the site was not occupied
by Caddo peoples. A small sample of shell- and
grog-grit-tempered ceramics (n=28) were collected
from the site, along with one Maud arrow point
(see Figure 31d) and two unidentifiable arrow point
fragments (all of Red River gravel cherts). The
Maud arrow point and the shell-tempered sherds
(one red-slipped, one parallel incised and eight
plain body sherds) are indicative of a Late Caddo,
McCurtain phase component, while the plain and
relatively thin-walled grog-grit-tempered ceramics
(n=18) denote a Caddo occupation that is presumed
to predate ca. A.D. 1300.
Finally, the Tarrant #5 site was used in historic
times, after about 1890 to probably the mid-20th
century (like many of the other sites in the NETAS
survey area with historic period components). No
structural features were observed at the site, and
the functional or occupational context of the material is unknown, but a small amount of historic
plain whiteware sherds, clear, purple, aqua, amber,
and blue bottle glass, a milk glass fruit jar sherd,
and a metal plow part (n=20) were collected from
the plowed field.

Both the Late Archaic period and Caddo
components at Tarrant #5 have the potential to
contain intact archeological deposits. A program
of shovel testing would be particularly useful in
determining the character and preservation condition
of these deposits, and in assessing the research
significance of the prehistoric archeological record
at the site. The relatively recent historic component
at the Tarrant #5 site does not warrant further
investigations.
41RR289, Tarrant #6
The Tarrant #6 site is located in a plowed field
a short distance to the north of 41RR288 along the
same alluvial terrace of the Red River. The small
tributary stream or slough of the Red River is about
200 m west of the site.
This site covers approximately 4200 m2, based
on the surface distribution of artifacts in the plowed
field. Both prehistoric and historic artifacts were
recovered in the surface collections from Tarrant
#6, and they indicate that the site was occupied in
prehistoric times during the Late Archaic, EarlyMiddle Caddo, and Late Caddo periods, and then
also in the late 19th-early 20th century.
The Late Archaic component includes one
Gary var. Gary dart point and another Gary var.
LeFlore point (see Figure 31e), and probably much
of the lithic debris (n=65), cores (n=3), a bifacial
tool fragment (n=1), and fire-cracked rock (n=4) in
the surface collection. A quartzite gouge fragment
probably is part of the Late Archaic artifact assemblage. The Early-Middle Caddo period component
is represented by 23 grog and grog-bone tempered
ceramics, including two red-slipped Sanders Plain
body sherds, one diagonally incised body sherd,
and a plain rim. Four plain shell-tempered body
sherds constitute the sum total of a Late Caddo,
McCurtain phase occupation at the Tarrant #6 site.
Further investigations of these prehistoric components are warranted to ascertain whether any of
the components contain horizontally or vertically
discrete archeological deposits and features.
Only 14 historic artifacts were collected from
this site, including plain whiteware (n=5), one blue
transfer-printed whiteware sherd, one sherd from
an Albany-glaze stoneware crock, clear, aqua, and
purple bottle glass, one porcelain button (4-hole),
and milk glass fruit jar lid fragments. While the
sample of artifacts is small, they are consistent with
historic use of the site from ca. 1860 to the early

Perttula—Survey of the Roitsch Farm and Adjoining Lands, 1991–1992 255
20th century. No structural features were noted at
the Tarrant #6 site during the investigations, and
the 1951 USGS 7.5’ quadrangle does not indicate a
structure or farmstead at this location. It is possible
that if there was a structure or farmstead at the site
around the turn of the 20th century, it had already
been destroyed or dismantled before 1951. One
aspect of further archeological investigations of
the prehistoric components at the site should be to
determine if intact late nineteenth-early twentieth
century archeological deposits are present.
41RR290, Tarrant #7
The Tarrant #7 site is another multi-component
prehistoric and historic archeological deposit located along the margins of a Red River alluvial
terrace. It overlooks a small tributary or slough
of the Red River that is 200 m north of the site.
The site area (ca. 2500 m2) has been plowed, and
surface visibility was excellent (about 80 percent
visibility at the time of the survey).
Both Early-Middle and Late Caddo period
occupational debris is present on this part of the
alluvial landform, principally plain and decorated
pottery sherds (n=63). A small amount of lithic debris (n=36) and a multiple platform quartzite core
were also collected from the site, along with four
unifacial flake tools of jasper, claystone/siltstone,
and quartzite raw materials. About 60 percent of
the Caddo pottery is grog, grit, and grog-bone tempered, which we consider to be of Early to Middle
Caddo period age, and there are three decorated
sherds: a single engraved line on a body sherd; a
horizontal punctated rim; and a direct or standing
rim with a vertical incised line. There is one plain
rim, standing with a rounded lip.
Of the 24 shell-tempered sherds, one has
punctated designs (cf. Emory Punctated-Incised)
(see Figure 56f), three body sherds are red-slipped
on interior and exterior surfaces (probably from
either what Flynn [1976] refers to as Clement
Redware or what Perino [1981] refers to as Roden
Ware), and one is from an Avery Engraved bowl.
A standing rim sherd has a single horizontal trailed
line below the lip (see Figure 38c), and there is a
shell-tempered handle sherd (probably from a Nash
Neck Banded or Emory Punctated-Incised jar) with
short vertical incised lines. A McCurtain phase
component is indicated by this cultural material.
Historic artifacts are abundant at the Tarrant
#7 site, and they appear to be yard sheet mid-

den deposits associated with a now-abandoned
farmstead. Although no structural features or
foundations were visible at the surface during the
survey, a structure is shown at this location on the
1951 Kiomatia 7.5' topographic quadrangle. The
historic artifacts noted and/or collected at the site
include: plain whitewares and ironstone (n=57);
milk glass fruit jar lid liner fragments (n=11); clear,
aqua, purple, amber, and blue bottle glass (n=75);
one porcelain 4-holed button and a brass overall
brad; a 20th century shell casing (“PETERS”); six
machine-made brick fragments; and Albany and
Bristol-glazed stoneware sherds (n=13). In aggregate, they indicate an occupation from ca. 1870 to
at least the 1930s.
The Caddo archeological materials identified at
the Tarrant #7 site probably represent the remains
of farmstead compounds dispersed along elevated,
arable lands in the Red River alluvial valley. If they
are from preserved habitational context, their investigation could contribute significant information on
Caddo lifeways in the Red River area of Northeast
Texas. Also of possible significance, Late Caddo
McCurtain phase occupations like that at Tarrant
#7 are not common upstream from the Roitsch site,
and the confluence of the Red and Kiamichi rivers
seems to generally mark the western distribution of
McCurtain phase settlements along the Red River
(see Bruseth 1998). McCurtain phase settlements
are present, however, in the Kiamichi River valley at least as far north as Hugo Lake in Choctaw
County, Oklahoma (Rohrbaugh 1973), and at the
Fasken site a short distance upstream on the Red
River from its confluence with the Kiamichi River
(see Prikryl, this volume). Shovel testing is thus
warranted to determine if intact Caddo archeological deposits are present at the site.
No recommendations are offered at this time for
further work on the relatively recent historic period
occupation of the site. An Historic Context should
first be developed for historic Anglo- and AfricanAmerican farmsteads and tenant farm archeological
sites in the Red River valley, as this will specify the
important research problems and issues that will
help determine if historic occupations on archeological sites like Tarrant #7 have significance.
41RR291, Tarrant #8
The Tarrant #8 site is located along a farm road
that runs in a loop from FM 410 to the margins
of the alluvial terrace bisecting the Tarrant and

256

Texas Archeological Society

Wright farms, joining up with FM 410 by the
Wright Plantation site (41RR7). The site is in a
plowed field near the edge of the alluvial terrace,
overlooking the wooden slopes and a slough of the
Red River in the current Red River floodplain, and
artifacts were observed in the farm road bed.
Both prehistoric and historic archeological materials were collected from Tarrant #8, which covers
an area of about 1550 m2, although no particular
concentrations of artifacts were noted associated
with either occupation. The prehistoric component
probably dates to the Early-Middle Caddo period, as
it contains thin and well-made grog- and grog-bone
tempered pottery sherds, which are characteristic
of this period in the Middle Red River drainage.
Twelve pieces of lithic debris were also observed
that may be associated with this component.
The historic period component dates from
about the turn of the 20th century to ca. 1950, based
on the clear bottle glass sherds from machine-made
bottles, plain ironstones and whitewares, Bristolglazed stonewares, and fruit jar sherds, as well as
information from the 1951 Kiomatia 7.5' quadrangle that indicates a structure stood in this location.
No surface evidence of structural or foundation
remains was noted during the survey, however, but
it is presumed that the recovered artifacts reflect
yard sheet midden deposits.
The possibility that the prehistoric archeological deposits at the Tarrant #8 site represent a
single component Early-Middle Caddo occupation,
which are relatively rare in the Middle Red River
region (e.g., Bruseth 1998), suggests that additional investigations are warranted. A program of
shovel testing across the site area would be useful
in ascertaining whether preserved archeological
deposits and features remain that could contribute
important information on Caddo lifeways. The
historic period component represents another in a
series of fairly recent farmsteads (tenant farms?)
on the old Wright Plantation. As discussed above,
their historical research potential is equivocal.
41RR292, Tarrant #9
The Tarrant #9 site is on a low, narrow, natural
levee deposit that runs parallel to a slough or small
tributary of the Red River; the slough is about 20
m south of the site. The natural levee is situated
on Red River floodplain deposits, and the higher
alluvial terrace (upon which are found many of the
previously described archeological sites recorded

during the survey). The site covers approximately
4130 m2 of the natural levee, which had been
plowed prior to the survey.
Prehistoric artifacts recovered from the Tarrant #9 site include a small amount of lithic debris
(n=53), 1 metate fragment, 12 fire-cracked rock,
a bifacial tool fragment, and 31 shell-tempered
sherds. Among the shell-tempered sherds were two
with interior/exterior red-slipping, one Nash Neck
Banded body sherd, one with a single engraved line,
and another sherd with part of an appliqued ridge
on it. The latter sherd may be from either a Nash
Neck Banded or Emory Punctated-Incised jar (cf.
Perino 1994:Figure 7). The ceramics from the site
clearly are from a single component Late Caddo,
McCurtain phase occupation (it is not conclusive
that the lithic artifacts are also part of the McCurtain phase archeological deposit), probably a small
residential occupation. As previously discussed, a
few single component Late Caddo habitation sites
were recorded during the TAS survey of the Roitsch
farm, but the Tarrant #9 site appears to represent the
westernmost unmixed McCurtain phase occupation
in this stretch of the middle Red River.
Site 41RR292 is also interesting in comparison
with the other prehistoric sites documented in the
Tarrant and Wright Farms survey in that it appears
to have been occupied only during the Late Caddo
McCurtain phase; the landform the site is on is also
different. No evidence of a preceding prehistoric use
of the site, or of historic Anglo- or African-American settlement, was observed in our investigations;
this obviously contrasts with the multi-component
nature of almost all the other sites identified during
the survey. To better understand the nature of Caddo
settlement during the Late Caddo period in the
middle Red River region (e.g., Bruseth et al. 1991,
1992; Bruseth 1998; Perttula, ed., this volume), it is
important that both the large and small sites (i.e., the
village, such as the Roitsch site, as well as the single
farmstead compounds) be identified and investigated
for their archeological research potential; the Tarrant #9 site seems to represent one of the smaller
farmstead compounds. Further investigations are
warranted to determine if the Tarrant #9 site contains
intact archeological deposits and features from the
McCurtain phase occupation.
41RR293, Tarrant #10
The Tarrant #10 site is situated on another patch
of plowed, low, natural levee deposits in the Red

Perttula—Survey of the Roitsch Farm and Adjoining Lands, 1991–1992 257
River floodplain, about 90 m to the north-northeast
of the Late Caddo Tarrant #9 site. The slough is
about 30 m to the northeast of the natural levee.
A low density scatter of prehistoric artifacts
covers approximately 4080 m2 of the natural levee
landform, based on the surface distribution of
artifacts in the plowed field. Artifacts noted on the
site include fire-cracked rock (n=11), lithic debris
(n=7), and plain Late Caddo shell-tempered pottery
sherds (n=2). Although smaller than the artifact
assemblage from the adjoining Tarrant #9 site, the
types of artifacts recovered at the Tarrant #10 site
are quite similar. It is possible that the latter site
simply represents one part of a larger McCurtain
phase farmstead compound dispersed across
natural levee deposits in this stretch of Red River
floodplain. The low density of artifacts suggests
that the McCurtain phase occupation was neither
intensive, nor prolonged, perhaps nothing more
than a single structure or a outdoor work/trash
disposal area associated with structures in another
nearby part of the floodplain.
Because the Tarrant #9 and #10 sites may
be part of a related Late Caddo occupation, the
Tarrant #10 site warrants additional work to determine the nature of any preserved Late Caddo
archeological deposits. A systematic surface collection after a fresh disking of the natural levee
may also prove worthwhile in defining particular
areas within the site where intact archeological
deposits and features (i.e., structures and middens) may be located.
41RR294, Wright #2
The Wright #2 site is located on a high alluvial
terrace (400 feet amsl) along the east side of the
Red River. It is a short distance north of the Wright
Plantation (41RR7) mound site.
An old channel or slough of the river runs
immediately below the terrace. The site was discovered when a small number of prehistoric and
historic artifacts were observed in and immediately
adjacent to a road bed that runs along the alluvial
terrace; the boundaries of the site were not determined because the immediate area was forested and
this limited the surface visibility accordingly.
Artifacts observed at the Wright #2 site include
a small number of prehistoric lithics (n=6) and
plain ceramics (n=2), along with ca. 1870-1900
plain whitewares and ironstones (n=20, including
one with a partial mark “CHINA”), salt-glazed

and Albany-lead glazed stonewares (n=5), and
aqua, amber, and amethyst bottle glass sherds
(n=7). Among the prehistoric lithic artifacts are
five pieces of lithic debris (Red River yellow
jasper, cherts, and metaquartzite) and a bifacial
scraper of Red River gravel chert. The prehistoric
ceramics include both plain shell-tempered and
grog-tempered wares, which may imply different periods of Caddo use of the site, while the
domestic artifacts from the historic component
suggest that a farm structure was present at the
site in the late 19th and early 20th centuries; no
trace of historic features or foundations was noted
during the investigations.
Further surface inspection of the site area, in
conjunction with shovel testing in wooden areas
along either side of the dirt farm road, is warranted
to first determine the spatial boundaries of the
different archeological components. Following
this, it will be important to determine if either
the prehistoric or historic components contain
intact archeological deposits, and thus have the
potential to address important regional research
problems.
41RR295, Wright #3
Prehistoric and historic artifacts at the Wright
#3 site are apparently confined to a small 10 x 20
m natural rise on the high alluvial terrace east of
the Red River and south of the Kiamichi River
confluence. The area is not currently plowed, and
ground surface visibility is poor (10-20 percent),
but a handful of artifacts were noted in exposed
and eroded areas of the rise.
Two bifacial tool fragments (one of an unidentified chert and the other of Big Fork chert,
both probably materials found in local Red River
gravels) comprised the prehistoric artifacts exposed
on the rise. They likely represent stem portions of
broken Archaic-style projectile points, but their
small size prohibits further determinations of tool
type and/or function.
Both pre-1860 and post-1880 historic materials
were noted at the Wright #3 site. The antebellum
artifacts include one dark olive green wine bottle
sherd and a green transfer-printed whiteware sherd.
The later historic artifacts include plain whiteware

whiteware rim sherd with a red stencil decoration.
One of the maker’s marks also has “CLEM... E...,”
and may be from a Clementson Bros. (Ltd.) vessel
made between ca. 1865-1916 (Godden 1964).
Further archeological investigations at the
pre-1860 historic component, such as shovel
testing and systematic surface collections, could
prove informative in determining whether preserved archeological deposits and features are
present at the site. If such archeological remains
are preserved, they may contain a wealth of
information on antebellum lifeways in the Red
River valley of northeastern Texas, as few sites
of this period of time have been identified and/or
investigated in the region. No further investigations are recommended at the present time for the
Archaic or post-1880 archeological components
at the Wright #3 site.
41RR296, Wright #5
The Wright #5 site is located on the high alluvial terrace (above 400 feet amsl) not far north
of the Wright Plantation (41RR7) site, and immediately adjacent to the current channel of the Red
River. The terrace is in pasture, and surface visibility is poor (10-20 percent), but a small amount
of prehistoric and historic artifacts were noted over
about 2400 m2 of the landform.
The prehistoric occupation of the Wright #5
site is marked by three pieces of lithic debris
(two of Red River chert gravels and the third of
novaculite), a flake tool (Red River chert), and
two broken bifaces (quartzite and Red River
chert) observed on the site surface. Their temporal
or cultural affiliation is unknown, but probably
Archaic. The historic archeological materials
observed includes: one lead bullet (.32 cal), one
plain whiteware body sherd, three sherds of porcelain (including two from the same vessel with
blue transfer printing, see Figure 35b), four sherds
of decalcomania (including one rim), one blue
transfer-printed whiteware, and ironstone sherds.
These probably represent artifacts discarded in
a yard sheet midden from a late 19th-early 20th
century farm house. The 1951 Kiomatia 7.5'
USGS topographic quadrangle depicts a structure
and barn in this general location, but no structural
or artifactual remains were noted that pertain to
a 1940s-1950s historic occupation. At this time,
we do not recommend any further investigations
at the Wright #5 site.

41RR297, Wright #4
The Wright #4 site sits on a flat alluvial terrace
a short distance east of the Wright Plantation site
and historic farm complex (41RR7). It is along the
edge of a plowed field, and FM 410 runs immediately to the south of the site while a dirt road runs
through the general site area. An abandoned frame
farm house still stands at the site, and the Kiomatia
7.5’ topographic map indicates that the farm house
was occupied in 1951.
The principal occupation of the site occurred
from about the turn of the 20th century to ca. 1950,
probably as a tenant farm. Historic ceramics, bottle
glass, and fruit jar lid sherds are distributed across
a few bare surface areas to the immediate north of
the house, which ended up there because of trash
discarded in the backyard to the farm house. Most
of the historic ceramics are plain whitewares and
ironstone sherds (n=42), along with a few sherds
(n=3) decorated with decalcomania and rim relief
molded (floral and ribbed). Bristol-glazed stoneware crockery sherds (n=2) were also noted in the
yard sheet trash deposit, along with one salt-glazed/
lead-glazed sherd. Machine-made (post-1904) purple and brown bottle glass (snuff containers) were
also identified in the surface artifact scatter, along
with post-1920 Mason jar milk glass lid sherds. We
do not recommend further investigations of this
20th century farmstead at this time.
The Wright #4 site also has a minor prehistoric
component. Three pieces of temporally and culturally undiagnostic lithic debris were noted in one of the
bare surface areas, mixed in amidst the much more
recent historic artifacts. Unless prehistoric archeological deposits are buried below the plow zone, or
below depths disturbed by the historic use of the site,
it is unlikely that intact prehistoric archeological
remains are still preserved at the site. Limited shovel
testing could be conducted in the general site area
to evaluate the potential for such buried remains to
be preserved, and assess their potential to contain
features or other important deposits.
41RR298, Tarrant #1A
The Tarrant #1A site was exposed in a dirt path
on a low sandy loam terrace landform north of a
slough or intermittent tributary of the Red River.
The dirt path has been used by cattle, and as a farm
road, and these activities have caused sufficient
erosion to expose prehistoric cultural materials.

Perttula—Survey of the Roitsch Farm and Adjoining Lands, 1991–1992 259
Plowed fields are also present on either side of the
road, and surface visibility in these areas is good
(about 70 percent).
The site consists solely of a scatter of prehistoric
lithic debris covering an area of unknown size on the
terrace. No prehistoric artifacts were collected from
the site, and more specific information about the debris (i.e., such as raw material, size, heat-treatment,
presence of bifacial thinning flakes, etc.) is not available that might permit more definitive statements
about the temporal and/or cultural affiliation of this
material. Because so little is known about the site
at present, we recommend a program of shovel testing be carried out to determine whether any intact
prehistoric archeological deposits are present at the
site, and if they have any potential to contain cultural
features or other significant remains (i.e., preserved
plant or animal remains).

visibility on the terrace was good (50-60 percent),
and abundant amounts of prehistoric lithic and
ceramic artifacts from a Caddo occupation were
observed on the surface south of a dirt farm road.
As the landowner did not wish any artifacts
to be collected from the site, and only a cursory
reconnaissance was completed, we were not able
to collect any specific information on the kinds of
prehistoric artifacts present at Wright #7. Given the
relatively dense archeological deposit exposed in
surface contexts, we presume that a Caddo habitation locale (the specific cultural period [e.g., Story
1990:334] is not known) is present at this place on
the high alluvial terrace. Whether it contains intact
archeological deposits has not been ascertained,
and thus we recommend that systematic shovel
testing be conducted to determine the nature of the
Caddo occupation at the Wright #7 site.

41RR299, Wright #6

41RR301, Wright #8

The Wright #6 site is currently eroding into
the Red River, which is changing its course. It is
located along the margins of the high alluvial terrace (the location of the Wright Plantation mound
site) at an elevation between 380-385 feet amsl,
and the course change of the river is cutting into
the terrace deposits themselves.
Both prehistoric and historic artifacts were
observed in eroded areas along the edge of the terrace. This consisted of prehistoric lithic debris and
historic whiteware and bottle glass. No artifacts
were collected at the request of the landowner, and
no notes were taken describing the specific kinds of
prehistoric and historic artifacts present at the site;
thus, no discussion of the possible age or cultural
affiliation of components or occupations is possible.
We do recommend that a program of shovel testing
be conducted at Wright #6 to evaluate the condition
of any intact archeological deposits, and surface collections should be secured to permit more confident
assessments of its age and character. The bank erosion
should be monitored on a regular basis to make sure
that possibly important archeological deposits and/or
features are either not actively eroding into the river,
or are not being threatened by imminent erosion.

The Wright #8 site is much like Wright # 7 in
that it is located on the eastern arm of the high (400
feet amsl) alluvial terrace of the Red River, and it
also contains in plowed surface contexts abundant
Caddo lithic and ceramic artifacts. The specific
prehistoric cultural period(s) when the site was
occupied is again not known. With landowner permission, a program of shovel testing and systematic
surface collection could be conducted that would
ascertain whether the Wright #8 site contains intact
archeological deposits, and whether these deposits
have research significance.
41RR302, Wright #9
Prehistoric lithic debris was noted during the
NETAS survey of the Wright Farm on the eastern
side of a low (380 feet amsl) alluvial terrace. The
terrace had been plowed, and visibility was good
(50-60 percent), thus exposing a surface scatter of
lithic artifacts. The size or depth of the site was not
ascertained in our investigations, and at the request
of the landowner no surface collections of prehistoric artifacts was made. We recommend further
investigations at the site to specifically determine
if it possesses research significance.

41RR300, Wright #7
The Wright #7 site is in a cultivated field on
an eastern extension of the high alluvial terrace
(above 400 feet amsl) of the Red River. Surface

41RR303, Wright #10
'The Wright #10 site contains both prehistoric
and historic components. It is located along FM

260

Texas Archeological Society

410, about midway between the Wright Plantation
farm complex and the Kiomatia School (a structure
is shown on the 1951 Kiomatia 7.5' USGS map, but
is no longer present).
The historic component probably spans the
period from ca. 1900-1950, based on the ages of
most of the other historic farmsteads on the Tarrant
and Wright farms, its location on FM 410, and the
fact that a structure is shown at this location on the
1951 USGS quadrangle; no structure or structural
remains are present at the site today. While specific
details are not available on the artifacts, clear,
purple, and brown bottle glass, plain whiteware,
and machine-made brick fragments from yard sheet
trash were abundant at the Wright #10 site. This
historic occupation at the site does not warrant
further archeological investigations.
This site also apparently has a prehistoric
Caddo occupation(s), mixed with the 20th century
farmstead materials, based on the large amount of
lithic and ceramic artifacts exposed on the surface.
We suggest that a Caddo farmstead compound may
have been present at the site, and recommend a program of shovel testing to determine its horizontal
and vertical site boundaries, as well as whether it
contains any intact archeological deposits.
41RR304, Wright #11
Both prehistoric and historic artifacts were
noted at the Wright #11 site, which is located in a
plowed field on the 400 foot alluvial terrace several hundred meters north of the Wright Plantation
site (41RR7), and immediately east of the current
channel of the Red River. The 1951 Kiomatia 7.5'
USGS quadrangle indicates that a historic house
and barn stood at this location, but no structural
remains or foundations were observed during the
NETAS reconnaissance of the site. Historic bottle
glass and ceramics are common at the Wright #11
site, and these presumably represent 20th century
domestic artifacts that had been discarded in yard
sheet trash deposits near the house. We recommend
no further work on the historic component of the
site at this time.
Prehistoric Caddo lithic and ceramic artifacts
were present in abundance at this site. Given the
apparent density of Caddo artifacts, these may
represent the archeological remains of a Caddo
farmstead compound, but shovel testing would
have to be conducted to determine if the Wright
#11 site contains preserved archeological deposits

and cultural features (i.e., middens, structures, and
pits) expected on a site of this kind.
41RR305, Wright #1
The Wright #1 site is located on a small rise on
a remnant of a low sandy loam terrace deposit (380
feet amsl) some 300 m east of the current channel
of the Red River. Most of the other archeological
sites in the Tarrant and Wright surveys either are
found along the edge of the 390 feet amsl terrace
that cuts across the farms, or are on the 400 foot
terrace to the south and west; the Wright Plantation
mound site (41RR7) occurs on this higher terrace.
The low terrace has been partially plowed, and surface visibility on the site was about 50 percent.
Based on the surface distribution of artifacts
on the terrace, the Wright #1 site covers approximately 2100 m2. Both probable Middle and Late
Caddo period components can be identified from
the prehistoric artifacts noted on the site, and the
probable Middle Caddo component appears to have
been the principal prehistoric occupation. The kinds
of artifacts comprising the probable Middle Caddo
occupation include 55 grog and grog-bone tempered
sherds, 50 of which were plain (including a plain
rim). The decorated sherds include four red-slipped
Sanders Plain body sherds. The scatter of lithic debris (n=51) and fire-cracked rocks (n=3) may also be
part of the Middle Caddo period artifact assemblage.
The Late Caddo use of the Wright #1 site is denoted
by two plain shell-tempered body sherds.
A small amount of historic artifacts were also
noted on the surface of the site, but no historic
structural remnants or features were present on the
terrace. Blue hand-painted (see Figure 35h) and
blue shell-edged whiteware (n=3) indicates that the
initial historic occupation of Wright #1 occurred
between ca. 1830-1860. This occupation may be
related to the early Anglo-American settlement
of the Wright Plantation area (cf. Steely 1982).
Machine-made brick fragments, ironstone china,
and clear and brown bottle glass bespeak a later
historic occupation, one probably dating roughly
from the turn of the 20th century.
There is a possibility that the Wright #1 site
contains intact Middle Caddo period archeological
deposits from a farmstead compound, as well as
perhaps a small Late Caddo component. Accordingly, we recommend that systematic shovel tests
be excavated at the site to determine its horizontal
and vertical boundaries, to assess the subsurface

Perttula—Survey of the Roitsch Farm and Adjoining Lands, 1991–1992 261
character of the archeological deposits, and evaluate the site’s potential to contain cultural features
(i.e., middens, pits, and structures, etc.). Completing this shovel testing effort should also be sufficient to determine the condition and character of
any preserved 1830-1860 archeological deposits.

SURVEY RESULTS FOR THE
TARRANT AND WRIGHT FARMS
Twenty-two prehistoric and historic archeological sites were recorded or are present on the
two farms (including the Wright Plantation site).
Most of the sites (68 percent) are located along
the edges of two Holocene alluvial terraces (at
elevations of 390 and 400+ feet in elevation, respectively) paralleling the course of the Red River,
and the remainder (all dating after ca. A.D. 1200)
are on low natural levee/terrace deposits of Late
Holocene to recent age about 3 m above the flow

of the river. A small tributary or slough of the Red
River runs immediately adjacent to this landform.
The sites range in age from the Late Archaic (ca.
2000-200 B.C.) to the 1950s, but most appear to
have been occupied either late in the historic era
(ca. 1890-1950) or by Caddo groups in prehistoric
times (i.e., from ca. A.D. 800-1600).
Late Archaic period components were recognized
at five archeological sites, 60 percent on the 390 foot
alluvial terrace, and the other two sites on the 400
foot alluvial terrace (Figure 62a). Archeological
deposits at these Late Archaic sites include large
quantities of lithic debris (from Ouachita Mountains
cherts and quartzites in Red River gravels), thick
and broad Gary dart points and large Gary bifacial
preforms, hammerstones, manos and pitted stones,
many cores and tested cobbles, retouched pieces,
scrapers and drills, as well as fire-cracked quartzite
and sandstone cobbles from hearths and cooking
features. We interpret these sites to primarily
represent the seasonally-occupied residential sites

or base camps of hunter-gatherers who foraged in
the Red River basin.
One important archeological trend in Northeast
Texas between ca. 200 B.C.-A.D. 800 is the
increasingly sedentary nature of prehistoric huntergatherer communities that lived in the region.
This trend suggests that group sizes were growing
during this period (termed the Woodland period),
and that the occupation of individual sites was
more long-lived. Nevertheless, Woodland period
sites in the Red River basin are presently poorly
known (Perttula et al. 1993:100-101). Only
three possible Woodland period components
were identified in the survey area, including
one pointed out to us by Larry Banks (then of
Southern Methodist University, Dallas, Texas).
This particular site is situated at the base of the
slope immediately below the 390 foot alluvial
terrace (see Figure 62b). According to Banks, the
site (41RR251) contains midden deposits and thick,

plain grog-tempered pottery (Williams Plain). This
settlement appears to resemble Woodland period
Fourche Maline culture sites in southwest Arkansas
and southeast Oklahoma, where small villages and
hamlets are present on the floodplains or terraces of
larger streams (or old channels of the Red River) (cf.
Schambach 1982, 2002). The other two components
contain only small amounts of plain grog-tempered
pottery, and are situated on the 390 foot terrace (see
Figure 62b).
Caddo archeological components dating between ca. A.D. 800-1300 were found on sites located on the 400 foot alluvial terrace (n=1, but with
three other possible components) and the natural
levee/terrace deposits (n=1, but dating to the Middle Caddo period), but were particularly common
and clustered on the 390 foot terrace (n=5) (see
Figure 62c-d). These Caddo components probably
represent farmsteads that were dispersed in the Red
River valley along elevated landforms with arable

soils. Thomas (1977:Table 2) indicates that these
sites are on soils (Hapludalfs and Oklared fine
sandy loam) well-suited to dry-farmed crop lands,
particularly the cultivation of corn.
These earlier Caddo occupations, which are
fairly small in size (ranging between 1500-7200
m2) are marked primarily by thin and well-made
grog and grog/bone-tempered Caddo ceramics
and small amounts of lithic debris and arrow
point fragments. Most of the ceramics are plain,
but at 41RR305 the decorated sherds include one
Sanders Engraved rim sherd, four red-slipped
[Sanders Plain?] body sherds, and two Canton
Incised body sherds from a Middle Caddo period
(ca. A.D. 1100-1300) Mound Prairie phase
component. Based on the density of cultural
materials, at least three substantial Mound Prairie
phase (see Perttula, ed., this volume) occupations
were recognized during the survey, one on natural
levee/terrace deposits (41RR305) and the other

two (41RR289 and 41RR290) on the 390 foot
alluvial terrace. Site 41RR305, with a Middle
Caddo period component, is the oldest prehistoric
component on the Tarrant and Wright farms to be
found on the natural levee/terrace deposits, and
provides proxy evidence on the age when these
deposits were formed and were no longer prone
to regular flooding. The Wright Plantation mound
site (41RR7), on the 400 foot terrace, may also
have been principally used during the Mound
Prairie phase, the local equivalent to the Sanders
phase (e.g., Bruseth 1998).
The Late Caddo period McCurtain phase sites
(dating from ca. A.D. 1300-1600/1700) are also
common on the two farms, as components of this
age were recognized at two sites on the 400 foot
terrace (including Wright Plantation), three sites on
the 390 foot terrace, and three sites on natural levee/
low 380 foot terrace deposits (see Figure 62e). These
sites are affiliated with the McCurtain phase, which

seems to represent the archeological remains of
certain agricultural Caddo groups who lived on the
middle Red River in Northeast Texas and Southeast
Oklahoma, as well as in the Little River and southern Ouachita Mountains in the southeastern part of
Oklahoma (see Bruseth 1998).
Like the earlier Caddo sites, the McCurtain phase
sites are recognized by the kinds of ceramics found on
them. All the ceramics are shell-tempered, the use of
which seems to have occurred about A.D. 1300 in this
part of the Red River valley, and most are plain body
sherds from large jars and bowls. Decorated ceramics
include punctated sherds from Emory PunctatedIncised jars, Nash Neck Banded body sherds, Avery
Engraved bowl sherds, sherds with appliqued ridges
(either from a Nash Neck Banded or Emory Punctated-Incised jar [see Perino 1994:Figure 7]), and plain
sherds with red-slipped interior and exterior surfaces.
These are probably from what Flynn (1976) refers to
as Clement Redware bowls, or from the undecorated
portions of Avery Engraved vessels.

Substantial McCurtain phase components are
present at sites 41RR288, 41RR290, and 41RR292;
the latter is located on natural levee/terrace deposits (see Figure 62e) while the other two are on the
390 foot alluvial terrace. Indeed, site 41RR292
seems to represent a single component McCurtain
phase residential occupation. The other sites probably also represent several farmstead compounds
on arable soils on the alluvial terrace.
McCurtain phase occupations are not common upstream from the Mound Prairie-Arnold
Roitsch site locality, and the confluence of the
Red and Kiamichi rivers seems to generally mark
the western distribution of McCurtain phase
settlements along the Red River (there is a small
McCurtain phase component at the Fasken site,
just upstream from the confluence; see Prikryl,
this volume). McCurtain phase settlements are
present, however, in the Kiamichi River valley
at least as far north as Hugo Lake in Choctaw
County, Oklahoma (Rohrbaugh 1973).

Late Caddo Components

Figure 62e. Late Caddo.

No conclusive evidence of the Cherokee village
of Tahchee was located during our survey, although
five sites with historic archeological materials
dating as early as ca. 1830 were identified; again,
the 390 foot and 400 foot terraces received the
heaviest use (see Figure 62f). These occupations
contained decorated European whitewares or
refined earthenwares (transfer-printed patterns of
various colors, blue shell-edged, and broad-line
hand-painted) and dark olive green wine bottle
glass. Site 41RR286 (on the 390 foot terrace)
contains the largest antebellum assemblage, and
further investigations are clearly warranted here
to determine if intact archeological deposits are
present there, and to retrieve additional artifacts
and/or features that can unravel the ethnic and
cultural affiliation of the site occupants.
Finally, probable farmsteads associated with
the Wright Plantation, and tenant farmstead
occupations dating from ca. 1890-1950, were

identified on 15 archeological sites (one site on
the 400 foot terrace appears to have been occupied
between ca. 1870-1900) distributed across all
three landforms; 14 of the 15 tenant farmsteads
are on the 390 and 400 foot terraces, however (see
Figure 62g). These sites contain large quantities
of plain whitewares and ironstones, Bristol and
Albany-glazed stonewares, bottle glass and fruit
jar glass, metal tools and implements, window
glass, and machine-made bricks. The domestic
artifacts on these sites appear to be from sheet
midden deposits associated with now-abandoned
farmsteads. No structural features or foundations
were visible at any of the post-1890 sites.

successful in locating and documenting a number of
apparently important prehistoric and historic sites
along the terraces and alluvial landforms of the Red
River, Salt Well Slough, and Big Pine Creek on the
Roitsch farm, as well as on the Tarrant and Wright
farms (Table 5). Most of these sites include Early
to Late Caddo settlements dating from ca. A.D. 900
to the late 17th century, from the large village at
the Dan Holdeman site (41RR11) to a smaller range
of probable hamlets and farmsteads with probable
preserved structures and features, but several wellpreserved early- to mid-19th century farmsteads
have also been identified that promise to contribute
important archeological information on “planters
and plain folk” (e.g., Lowe and Campbell 1987)
that lived in the middle reaches of the Red River
valley in Northeast Texas.
A total of 70 new archeological sites were
recorded during the two TAS field seasons on
the Roitsch and Fasken farms, and another 18

previously recorded sites were visited and new
archeological information gathered from them. To
supplement the TAS survey, the 1993 NETAS survey
of the Tarrant and Wright farms at the confluence of
the Red and Kiamichi rivers recorded another 21
archeological sites, several of which appear to also
have the potential to contain important prehistoric
and historic archeological deposits (see Table 5).
Although many of the previously recorded and
new archeological sites are of unknown prehistoric
age—containing relatively undiagnostic lithic debris and fire-cracked rock or plain grog-tempered
pottery, for the most part—it is evident that these
four farms were witness to fairly intensive settlement beginning after about 2000 B.C. in the Late
Archaic period, as well as during the Woodland
period, and then particularly so by Caddo peoples
after about A.D. 800.
Woodland period sites appear to be concentrated
on what would have been forested terrace and

upland settings overlooking the Red River
floodplain, and along its principal tributary on
Mound Prairie (Big Pine Creek), with loamy sediments well-suited to dry farming (Figure 63a).
It may be significant that the large Roitsch
site (41RR16; see Figure 63a) does not have a
substantial Woodland occupation, although in part
this may be because the alluvial terrace did not
form until after ca. A.D. 800/900 (see Perttula,
ed., this volume; Perttula et al. 2001). Schambach
(1998:xv) suggests that these Woodland peoples
(i.e., Fourche Maline culture) were probably
“significantly reliant on seed-crop horticulture,”
and the distribution of Woodland period sites
(ranging from large [>3-5 acres] to small [<1
acre] settlements) on arable lands supports this
notion. Future archeological investigations at these
Woodland period components on Mound Prairie
should contribute new information on the nature of
Woodland period settlements and communities, as
well as gather evidence for horticultural economies

prior to the establishment of Caddo agricultural
systems along the Red River valley.
Formative, Early, to Middle Caddo components
are probably underrepresented in the 109 archeological sites investigated during the TAS survey because
it is difficult to identify or define specific components
for these three periods when only a small scattering
of plain grog-tempered sherds (which are also present
on Woodland period sites, although thought to have
thicker vessel walls) and an occasional stemmed arrow point is typically recovered from shovel testing
and a surface collection. The available information
suggests Early to Middle Caddo components are concentrated in the vicinity of larger villages and civicceremonial centers—as at the Roitsch, Holdeman,
and Fasken sites—that have mounds, structures, and
other evidence of permanent settlement (see Skinner
et al. 1969; Perino 1995; Perttula, ed., this volume;
Prikryl, this volume). These Caddo populations were
sedentary, and the size of sites on the Roitsch farms
(0.3-3.1 acres) suggest that these groups lived in small

farmsteads or hamlets that were associated with the
larger and self-supporting villages and mound centers. It is doubtful that these pre-A.D. 1300 Caddo
populations were intensive agriculturists (see Perttula
1996:314-322, 2008), however, although they assuredly cultivated corn, and gathered wild seeds and
other plant and animal resources. The few discrete
Formative, Early, to Middle Caddo components outside of the Roitsch and Holdeman sites are on terraces
and uplands with arable loamy sediments (see Figure
63b). There is no evidence that the Formative, Early,
and Middle Caddo populations gathered or processed

salt at this time.
Most notably, Late Caddo sites—probable farmsteads and small hamlets, as well as the large village
at Roitsch and the Dan Holdeman site (41RR11)—
are abundant on the Roitsch (see Figure 63c) and
Tarrant-Wright farms (see Figure 62e)—but this
is not the case upstream on the Red River on the
Fasken farms. These Late Caddo McCurtain phase
groups living at the mouth of the Kiamichi River
were closely affiliated (ethnically and genetically)
with Caddo groups living some miles downstream
along the Red River in the vicinity of the Roitsch

site, as well as with other groups on the Kiamichi,
the Little River, and parts of the southern Ouachita
Mountains (Figure 64). The McCurtain phase Caddo
communities were agriculturists: this has been welldemonstrated through stable carbon isotope analyses
and bioarcheological studies from the Roitsch,
Holdeman, Roden (Perino 1981), and Rowland
Clark sites (see Derrick et al. in Perttula, ed., this
volume; Perttula 1996:321), as well as the findings
from salt-making sites along Salt Well Slough (see
Kenmotsu 2006).
Maize probably comprised more than 50 percent of the diet for the McCurtain phase Caddo
peoples, based on stable isotope values, and thus
it is not surprising that the villages and farmsteads
are associated with fertile and renewable alluvial
soils, particularly with easily-tilled fine sandy loam
sediments on alluvial terraces that are associated
with the modern Late Holocene channel of the Red
River. Smaller McCurtain phase settlements and
farmsteads (ranging from ca. 0.1-5 acres in size)
on the Roitsch farm are clearly concentrated in the
vicinity of the large Roitsch village and mound

center (see Figure 63c) and are presumed to belong
with the Roitsch community, but they are found
on loamy upland and terrace soils facing the Red
River floodplain and along Big Pine Creek.
The four Late Caddo salt making sites are near the
known village areas at Roitsch (see Figure 63c), but on
clayey alluvium that would have been very difficult to
work with wood and bone tools. Kenmotsu’s (2006)
analyses of the Salt Well Slough site (41RR204)
indicates that Late Caddo agriculturists needed salt
to supplement their diets, but that the production of
salt was limited in scale, probably to meet the needs
of the Roitsch community.
Although the 1825 Cherokee village of Tahchee was not identified during the survey of this
stretch of the Red River (Bruseth et al. 1991:14;
Everett 1990:34, 51), antebellum archeological
sites dating as early as ca. 1830 were relatively
common on the Tarrant and Wright tracts of
land (see Figure 62f), and at the Fasken site (see
Prikryl, this volume), but much less so in the
vicinity of the Roitsch site (see Figure 63d). The
early Anglo-American settlers were apparently

widely dispersed across Mound Prairie, choosing alluvial terrace landform with fertile soils to
establish farmsteads (as at 41RR109, 41RR242,
and 41RR266) and larger plantations (as at the
Houser Plantation at the Dan Holdeman site and
the Wright Plantation) to cultivate corn, cotton,
and other foods (see Lowe and Campbell 1987).
With a growing population before 1860, but significantly expanding in the 20 years after the Civil
War (Harper 1996a:496), along with the coming
of the Texas and Pacific Railway, and the expansion in cotton cultivation, rural farmsteads spread
across the county’s farmlands through the 1930s.
By 1920, for example, more than 260,000 acres
were in cultivation in Red River County, particularly for the production of cotton. With increasing
reliance on cotton as a cash crop in the early 20th
century, less than “30 percent of the county’s
farmers owned all or a part of their farms” (Harper
1996a:496). The majority of the historic sites on
the Roitsch and Tarrant-Wright farms were occupied, probably by tenant farmer, during this period
of increased cotton production.

ACKNOWLEDGMENTS
I would first like to thank Mr. Arnold E. A.
Roitsch, his wife, and sons for permission to carry
out the survey on his property, for guiding the
crews across the farm, and for helping to free our
vehicles when they became mired in mud as we
attempted to get to survey areas. Thanks also to
the other landowners who allowed us to complete
an archeological survey of portions of their farms:
Mr. Andrew Fasken, Mrs. E. M. Pool, Mrs. Linda
Lewis Tarrant, Richard Wright, and Mr. Howard
and Judy Williams.
I greatly appreciate the efforts of the TAS
crews and crew chiefs who volunteered in the
surveys. They include: Chris Kneupper (1991),
Linda Lindsay (1991), Johnny Byers (1991), Jay
Hornsby (1991-1992), Steve Hoyt (1991), Bo Nelson (1992), Bret Williamson (1992), Bob Van Til
(1992), and John Greene (1992) (crew chiefs); and

efforts of those many TAS members who worked
in the field laboratory during the 1992 season, who
had to endure my trying to cope with the double
duty of supervising both the lab and the archeological survey crews.
A special thanks go to Bo Nelson and Mike
Turner for their considerable assistance with the
1992 season survey, both in the field and in the lab.

I also want to acknowledge their efforts in leading
the 1993 archeological survey of the Tarrant and
Wright Farms at the behest of the Texas Historical
Commission, and Bo’s efforts since then in the subsequent analyses of the artifacts back in Austin, as
well as in the photography of the artifacts. Thanks
also to Linda Tarrant for the invitation to conduct
the archeological survey of her lands.
The Archaeology Research Program at
Southern Methodist University, and Sue LinderLindsay, allowed us to check out on loan the
artifacts collected during the 1972 survey of Big
Pine Reservoir from sites now on Mr. Roitsch’s
property. These proved of considerable value in site
interpretations since fairly large artifact samples
were collected at that time from a number of these
sites. Dr. Darrell G. Creel of the Texas Archeological
Research Laboratory at The University of Texas
at Austin (TARL), gave us permission, prior to
beginning the TAS survey project, to peruse the
prehistoric archeological collections from Red River
County in the TARL collections. We also appreciate

Perttula—Survey of the Roitsch Farm and Adjoining Lands, 1991–1992 273
the willingness of Mary Herron of the Museum of
the Red River to allow James E. Bruseth and myself
to examine their extensive collections from Caddo
village sites on the Red River, particularly the Dan
Holdeman and Rowland Clark sites, and for copies
of the unpublished manuscripts for these two sites.
At the end of the project, Sandy Hannum and
Roland Pantermuehl stepped in to work on finalizing figures. Ron Ralph and Pam Wheat pushed
the project along to the finish line.

APPENDIX I,
ISOLATED FINDS
Isolated Find 1
Isolated find 1 was a bifacial preform of
Johns Valley shale collected from the surface of
the plowed field about 130 m southwest of Salt
Well Slough. It is in an area between the Salt Well
Slough site (41RR204) and 41RR259.
Isolated Find 2
This find consisted of a dart projectile point
collected on the surface (a possible Marcos), and
another dart point (Palmillas type) was recovered
in one of six shovel tests excavated in the vicinity
of the find spot. These artifacts are indicative of
a limited Late Archaic use of the area. The landowner has reportedly collected a ground stone celt
in this location, which may represent a later Caddo
use of the area.
Isolated Find 3
A broken Gary point was collected from the
surface in a 23 acre field south of the Roitsch farmhouse. This is a broad and flat alluvial landform
between Pond Creek and Salt Well Slough.

Isolated Find 4
This locality consisted of a Late Archaic-style
corner-notched dart point and a single piece of
lithic debris recovered in the systematic surface
collection of a plowed field about 500 m north
of Pond Creek. Five ca. 1900-1940 historic
farmsteads were also recorded in this field, and
Isolated Find 4 is 100 m west of 41RR222. The
nearest prehistoric site is about 300 m to the north
(41RR226), and consists solely of a surface scatter of lithic debris, fire-cracked rock, and three
fragments of a metate.
Isolated Find E-1
A single Gary projectile point was collected
off the surface in a pasture about 100 m south of
an intermittent tributary of Big Pine Creek; the
current creek channel is 1.25 km to the north. No
other artifacts were visible on the surface, and the
five shovel tests in the vicinity of the find spot
failed to disclose any subsurface archeological
deposits.

APPENDIX IV,
PLANT REMAINS FROM THE PINE CONE SITE (41RR236)
Gayle J. Fritz
This appendix presents the raw data on the
plant remains recovered from one of the Caddo
archeological sites (41RR236) investigated during
the 1991 Texas Archeological Society (TAS) Field
School on the Red River. Fritz (1992; see also Perttula et al. 2001; Perttula, ed., this volume) describes
the paleobotanical findings at this and other Caddo
sites worked on by the TAS in 1991.

One 2 liter flotation sample was obtained from
Feature 1 (lot 37) at the Pine Cone site (41RR236).
Table IV-1 summarizes the carbonized plant remains
from the feature, Table IV-2 provides maize cupule
measurements, and Table IV-3 lists the charred seeds
found in the floated sample. Finally, Table IV-4 presents the Washington University Paleoethnobotanical
Laboratory analysis forms for lot 37.

APPENDIX V,
ANIMAL BONES FROM THE PINE CONE SITE (41RR236)
LeeAnna Schniebs
INTRODUCTION
The excavation of 41RR236 (the Pine Cone
site) in Red River County, Texas, yielded 101
faunal specimens with a total assemblage weight
of 19.55 grams. This includes all teeth and bone
fragments. Faunal material was recovered from
one shovel test, three excavation units, and one
feature in this small, early McCurtain phase
settlement site. The following sections discuss the
methods employed in the faunal analysis, results
of taxonomic identification and quantification, and
distribution of these remains.

METHODOLOGY
All prehistoric vertebrate remains were inventoried and weighed, and Excel 5.0 for Windows
was used to manipulate the generated data. An
Ohaus digital scale, Model CT600-S, was used
to record bone weight. All fragments recovered
were analyzed by the author, using comparative
collections on loan from or housed at the Institute
of Applied Sciences, Zooarchaeology Lab, University of North Texas, Denton, Texas. Occasional
supplements were required, using conventional
osteological keys such as Olsen (1964), Gilbert
(1980), and Schmid (1972). Identifications were
made to the most specific category possible depending on the condition of the bone and available
comparative material. Only positive identifications resulted in the assignment of elements to
genus or species.
The animal bones were inventoried and bagged
by the Texas Historical Commission, then submitted for identification and quantification. Both unidentifiable and identifiable pieces were analyzed
in similar fashion. That is, the same attributes were
recorded: taxon, element and portion of that element, anatomical location of the element, condition
of the bone and any notes on age, taphonomy, burning or breakage patterns, and presence of modification, if applicable. Provenience information was
also recorded.
Quantification of the assemblage is summarized as number of identified specimens per taxon
(NISP) and as minimum number of individuals

(MNI) for identified elements. MNI estimates
were calculated according to the most frequently
occurring element, based on symmetry and element
portion (Munzel 1986). In the mammalian class,
teeth were used whenever possible.
The faunal data tables in this appendix are
standard species lists with the number of occurrences for each animal. Those specimens regarded
as unidentifiable (those coded to only class) have
been consolidated into two general categories.
Elements of nondiagnostic skeletal value (unidentifiable fragments and long bone shafts; Olsen
1964), are coded in an indeterminate category
by class and size range. For example, specimens
counted as “mammal” are from indeterminate-size
mammals, and “large mammal” refers to a deersize mammal. Recording these specimens in a size
category enables the most precise level of observation that the specimen allows. In small samples,
taking note of weight and the size categories of
nondiagnostic elements broadens the function of
the bone assemblage. However, percentages are
calculated by number of bones (NISP) rather than
weight.
RESULTS
The only taxonomic class identified is mammal
(artiodactyla). None of the faunal specimens are
modified. Number of identified specimens (NISP)
and minimum number of individuals (MNI) for
each taxon are summarized in Table V.1, as are
weights for each taxon and their percentages in
the site assemblage. Composition of anatomical
elements can be found in Table V.2.

mammal species may have been present in Red River
County, but the elements found in this site assemblage
are from smaller individuals. Whitetail deer are
known for their small size, as compared to the larger
mule deer of the western United States. At least one
immature individual was present at the site.
The two medium artiodactyl bones recovered in Unit 4 are also probably the remains of
whitetail deer. The medium artiodactyl sample
consists of a burned ulna fragment and a podial
bone. These are most likely the remains of deer
rather than pronghorn (Antilocapra americana).
Both are similar in size, but pronghorn antelope
are found in open prairies and sagebrush plains
well outside of the project area (Burt and Grossenheider 1980).

ASSEMBLAGE CONDITION
In general, the faunal material from the site is
highly fragmented. Taphonomic patterns were absent
on 40 specimens (Table V.3). Surface observations
include splintering, severe exfoliation, and abrasion.
Only 6 percent of the site sample is burned (n=6).
This may be evidence that the bone was boiled,
possible for bone grease processing. The bones
would have been broken into small pieces and boiled
in water. The floating fat would then be skimmed
from the top of the pot. The substance would have
been used for frying and other culinary purposes.
This practice has been well documented over a

SUMMARY
The small faunal collection from the Pine Cone
site (41RR236) gives further evidence to the fact
that the prehistoric Caddo living along the Red River
supplemented their diet with large game. Specifically,
the small amount of fauna from the test excavations
includes the remains of white tail deer.

ABSTRACT
The 1991 and 1992 Texas Archeological Society Field Schools held along the Red River and tributaries
in Northeast Texas were designed to obtain new and important information on the Caddo prehistory and early
history of the middle reaches of the Red River, and they were a considerable success. Archeological investigations at the Roitsch (or Sam Kaufman) site (41RR16) recovered significant archeological evidence of Caddo
structures and features, mound construction, and burial practices during the Early to Late Caddo periods, as well
as a substantial faunal and floral data base on subsistence practices (particularly the use of maize), and from
bioarcheological studies, a new appreciation of the health conditions and dietary adaptations of generations of
Late Caddo (ca. A.D. 1300-1700) farmers who lived on Mound Prairie.
This article presents the results of the archeological investigations at the Roitsch site. It includes detailed
discussions on the archeological, bioarcheological, paleobotanical, and faunal remains found in Early, Middle,
Late, and possible Historic Caddo period contexts in the village, and considers the findings in light of the research goals developed during the course of the 1991 and 1992 TAS Field Schools.

INTRODUCTION
Timothy K. Perttula, William A. Martin,
and James E. Bruseth
The 1991 and 1992 Texas Archeological
Society (TAS) Field Schools were held in Red
River and Lamar counties, Texas, under the
direction of Dr. James E. Bruseth of the Texas
Historical Commission (THC), and assisted by
THC staff from the Department of Antiquities
Protection (now the Archeology Division). The
immediate impetus for holding the Field Schools
in Northeast Texas was the devastating 1990 flood
along the Red River, which washed away the
West Mound at the Sam Kaufman (41RR16, now
known as the Roitsch) site (investigated in 1968 by
Skinner et al. [1969]), and future floods threatened
to remove even more of this important prehistoric
and early historic Caddo village. Furthermore, the
Roitsch site was being subjected to the looting

of prehistoric Caddo burials and other impacts
associated with the modern farm use of the land,
and it was our feeling that the archeological work
that could be accomplished by the TAS would help
to obtain significant information on the character of
this prehistoric Caddo site and, moreover, increase
our knowledge of the native history of the Caddo
peoples (see Perttula and Bruseth 1998:1-5) who
lived along the middle reaches of the Red River for
at least a millennium.
In addition to the investigations completed
at the Roitsch site, the subject of this article, the
TAS Field School conducted work at the Fasken
(41RR14), Jonesborough (41RR15), Salt Well
Slough (41RR204), and Ray (41LR135) sites (Figure 1) during either or both years of the Red River
field school effort (Bruseth et al. 2001; Kenmotsu
2001, 2006; Perttula et al. 2001; Prikryl 2001,
see also this volume; Reese 2001). The TAS also
completed an extensive archeological survey on
the Roitsch farm lands, which was followed up by

Texas Archeological Society Special Publication No. 5 (2008)

314

Texas Archeological Society

additional survey on the Tarrant farm lands, adjacent to the Wright Plantation Mound site (41RR7)
(Perttula, this volume) (Figure 2).
As set out in Bruseth et al. (1991, 1992), our
work was guided by several basic research goals,
each designed to address research problems that we
considered relevant to the kinds of archeological
sites and deposits to be investigated during the Field
School. Furthermore, they were research problems
where substantial and pertinent evidence could be
expected to be gathered during the course of the
Field School work, not simply research problems
posed that could only be addressed at the conclusion of a long-term research program in the Red
River valley of Northeast Texas (and southeastern
Oklahoma), an area unfortunately long-neglected
by Caddo archeologists (see Story 1990; Kenmotsu
and Perttula 1993; Bruseth 1998). Our goals included: (1) improving the regional chronology; (2)
understanding the village structure at the Roitsch
site, as well as the other Caddo sites in the vicinity;
(3) understanding the internal characteristics of the
mounds at the Roitsch and Fasken sites; (4) possibly
identifying the historic tribal affiliation of any of the
archeological deposits at the Roitsch site that may
date from after ca. A.D. 1650 to ca. A.D. 1730; (5)

analyzing the human subsistence strategies of the
Caddo Indians living in the Red River valley of
Northeast Texas through faunal, floral, and bioarcheological remains; (6) determining if the Caddo
Indians were processing salt near the Roitsch site;
and (7) examining early Anglo-American settlement and trade if the Jonesborough site could be
definitely identified through archeological investigations (Bruseth et al. 1991:17-26; Bruseth et al.
1992:19-28; Perttula et al. 2001). We will discuss
our findings relative to these goals in the concluding section of this article, and from time to time in
different sections when it is relevant in evaluating
site- or area-specific TAS findings.
In this article, then, we present the varied
findings of the archeological investigations held at
the Arnold Roitsch site, a major prehistoric Caddo
village and ceremonial center on Mound Prairie in
the Red River drainage basin of Northeast Texas
(see also Perttula et al. 2001; Skinner et al. 1969).
A substantial amount of work was accomplished
there during the 1991 and 1992 Field Schools
(300+ people do move a lot of dirt in a week,
even when it rained!), and impressive amounts of
archeological remains were recovered (i.e., more
than 100,000 artifacts from the village areas at the

Previous Investigations at the Sam
Kaufman or Arnold Roitsch Site
The Roitsch site (formerly the Sam Kaufman
site) represents a village and ceremonial center of
the prehistoric and—perhaps historic—Caddo Indians, based on the results of sporadic archeological
investigations over the past 50 years. Members of
the Dallas Archeological Society (DAS), most notably the late R. K. Harris, conducted limited work
at the site during the 1950s. Much of this effort
was directed toward salvaging burials that were
exposed by plowing (Harris 1951, 1953; Harris et
al. 1954; Harris and Wilson 1956). Buddy Jones,
then a student at the University of Oklahoma, excavated several other late McCurtain to early Historic
Caddo burials (at least six) at the site in the early
1960s, although the results of that work have never
been fully reported (Perttula 2006:133-135).
In 1968, Southern Methodist University (SMU),
with funding from the National Park Service,

conducted about one month of field work under the
direction of Dr. Alan Skinner. The purpose of this
field work was to gather data on the site, since even
at that time it was in danger of washing into the Red
River (Skinner et al. 1969). This effort concentrated
on the two known mounds, and only limited work
was conducted away from the mounds (Skinner
et al. 1969: Figure 3). Although SMU’s effort left
much of the village deposits untouched, it was quite
successful in gathering important information about
certain aspects of the prehistoric Caddo occupation
at the Roitsch site.
There are two other nearby sites that are actually portions of what was very likely a single
Caddo village. The first is the Bob Williams site
(Perino 1983), located immediately adjacent to the
Roitsch site, with the distinction in site designation
based largely on property ownership. The second
is the Roden site (Perino 1981), located across the
Red River in McCurtain County, Oklahoma.
The Williams site was investigated in the late
1970s by Gregory Perino of the Museum of the
Red River (Perino 1983). The Museum’s work uncovered two major and four minor cemetery areas,

316

many pit features, as well as large
cemeteries (see also Perttula, this
volume). The sites were occupied
primarily in the Late Caddo period, during the McCurtain phase.
In 1999, Banks and Banks
(2002) excavated a Late Caddo
period burial in the southern
part of the Roitsch site that had
eroded out of CR 2381. The burial
contained a number of funerary
objects, including a possible iron
knife fragment, and Banks and

discovery may relate to initial

nature and extent are poorly known, is represented
by a few rectangular houses in the vicinity of the
East Mound, and a number of burials. Many of
these burials have been disturbed by the pot hunting
activities at the site, and thus a consistent and characteristic cultural assemblage has not been defined
for this period. Excavations by the Museum of the
Red River at the nearby Holdeman site in Red River
County, Texas, documented an extensive occupation
from this period (Loveland 1987; Perino 1995).
Major occupation at the site occurred after
about A.D. 1300 (Late Caddo period), during the
McCurtain phase, when a village was established.
This occupation probably looked much like the
settlement shown on a map made in 1691 by the
expedition of Domingo Terán de los Rios during a
visit to the Red River to investigate the possibility
of establishing Spanish missions among the Caddo
(see below). The map shows one of the historic
Kadohadacho or Nasoni villages that was located
northwest of present day Texarkana, Texas (e.g.,
Schambach 1983; Wedel 1978), most likely at the
Hatchel site (41BW3) and other nearby archeological sites (Perttula 2005). The map shows that the village consisted of scattered farmsteads, each with a
house and a roofed structure that probably served
as an arbor, or covered work area. Each farmstead
was surrounded by what appear to be hedgerows,
or fence-like alignments of vegetation demarcating
individual family compounds. It is likely that fields
of corn, beans, and squash were grown on each plot
or compound. On one side of the map, an earthen
mound is pictured with a structure partially buried
on top of it. This was likely a temple where religious
and ceremonial-ritualistic activities took place.
The two earthen mounds at the Roitsch site
probably served a function similar to the mound
illustrated on the 1691 Terán map. One of the
mounds, referred to as the East Mound, was constructed up to a height of about 1 m and covered the
remains of a structure (Skinner et al. 1969: Figure
5). At the death of a prominent person —perhaps
a Caddo tribal political leader (a caddi)— a large
pit measuring 4 m in diameter and over 1.8 m deep
was excavated through the floor of this structure
and used as a burial tomb. The grave pit was
discovered and excavated in 1968 by SMU (Skinner et al. 1969: Figures 10 and 11). This work
showed that the remains of a deceased adult male
were placed into the pit along with a female, who
may have been his principal wife, and nine other
individuals—probably retainers or slaves. Many

artifacts were also placed in the pit, including
elaborately decorated ceramic vessels, finely made
arrow points, shell and turquoise beads traded from
other areas, and ground stone celts. The artifacts,
representing the wealth of the deceased leader,
were most likely used to provision his entourage
during their journey to the land of the deceased.
The West Mound was about 60 m in length, 46
m in width, and over 2.1 m tall. Based on SMU’s
excavations, the mound apparently consisted of superimposed burned layers from former deliberately
destroyed structures (Skinner et al. 1969). We believe that this mound also served as a platform for
a temple much like the one depicted in the Terán
map. The mound was destroyed by erosion during
flooding of the Red River in the Spring of 1990.
In 1991, in response to the destruction of the
West Mound, the TAS approached Mr. Arnold
Roitsch, then the owner of the site, and requested
permission to conduct the 1991 TAS Field School
at the site in order to retrieve as much information as possible before the river could destroy any
more of the deposit. The staff of the Department
of Archeological Planning and Review (now the
Archeology Division) at the THC was recruited to
direct the Field School and conduct all analysis and
report preparation tasks. The TAS chose to return to
the Roitsch site and northeastern Texas for the 1992
Field School, also directed by the THC staff.
Summary of the Investigations and
Contents of this Article
The field work proposed for the site during the
two Field Schools included work in a number of
different parts of the Roitsch site. This included:
(1) opening Blocks I, II, and IX and examining
the sub-mound deposits beneath the East Mound,
as well as any features exposed within the mound;
(2) exposing, mapping, and sampling features such
as house patterns, hearths, and pits within the McCurtain phase village area blocks (Blocks III and IV,
and probably Block V); (3) conducting excavations
in earlier prehistoric Caddo archeological deposits
preserved within the village (Blocks VI and 1991
Youth Area); and (4) investigating and documenting the Late McCurtain phase burials exposed by
erosion and pot hunter looting in the Terrace area.
Various sections of this article will discuss
the results and findings of the archeological
investigations in each of these parts of the Roitsch
site. Another section (by James W. Cogswell, Hector

318

Texas Archeological Society

Neff, and Michael D. Glascock) is a discussion of
the chemical variation in Caddo ceramics found
at the Red River Field School sites, as well as
other Caddo sites in northeastern Texas, based on
instrumental neutron activation analysis (INAA)
of the clay paste in those ceramics. Sharon Derrick
and colleagues present their detailed analysis of
the human remains recovered from the Roitsch
site in another section, focusing on evidence for
medical disorders, bone infections and pathologies,
evidence for cranial modeling (Derrick and Wilson
1997), and dietary practices. The use of both wild
and cultivated plant foods by the occupants of
the Roitsch site are discussed in two succeeding
sections by Gayle J. Fritz and S. Eileen Goldborer,
respectively, supplemented with paleobotanical
findings from other sites investigated by the TAS
during the 1991 and 1992 Field Schools. A section
by Bonnie C. Yates presents an analysis of the
faunal remains recovered from the Field School
sites, particularly from the Roitsch and Ray sites.
In the concluding section of this article, the overall
results and findings are summarized of the 1991
and 1992 Texas Archeological Society Field School
excavations at the Roitsch site.
This article also contains a number of appendices, most of them pertaining either to the Caddo
burials and human remains excavated in the East
Mound and the Terrace areas (see Appendix II-VI)
or are inventories of the faunal remains from the
Roitsch and Ray sites (Appendix VII and VIII).
Appendix I presents the compositional results of
the Red River Caddo ceramic sherds analyzed by
INAA. Appendix IX provides morphological descriptions and measurements for the chipped stone

CULTURAL AND NATURAL
SETTING
James E. Bruseth and Timothy K. Perttula
Extensive discussions of the cultural and
natural settings of this part of northeastern Texas

can be found in a number of recent publications,
including Story (1990), Kenmotsu and Perttula
(1993), Bruseth (1998), and Perttula (2004). Most
of the Field School sites lie in the northwestern
portions of Red River County, in Northeast Texas,
while the Ray site (41LR135) is in northern Lamar
County, about 25 km southwest from the Roitsch
site (see Figure 1).
The ecotonal setting of the Field School sites
in the West Gulf Coastal Plain (Fenneman 1938)
centers on the Red River valley, with widely scattered intermittent and/or permanent streams (such
as Nolan Creek, one of the northward-flowing
tributaries of the river) that eventually flow into the
Red River. While now mainly agricultural fields,
pasture, and second growth pines and hardwoods,
this part of Northeast Texas was an area of mixed
oak woodlands and mixed pine-hardwood forests
(Diamond et al. 1987; Brown et al. 1998) in the uplands and hardwoods, swamps, and marshes in the
broad Red River riparian bottomlands. Also present
in these floodplains were sloughs, abandoned channels, and oxbow lakes, and many have fertile sandy
loam elevated terraces and natural levees (Thomas
1977) adjacent to them that were ideal habitation
areas for foragers and agriculturists alike. While
the Tall Grass Prairie or Blackland Prairie habitat
and black clay soils are situated to the west and
south of the Roitsch site, there were scattered
prairies in Red River County (see Jordan 1981).
These include small prairie patches downstream
from the Roitsch site in the Pecan Point area and
Shawnee Prairie in the Sulphur River drainage, as
well as Mound Prairie (or Jonesborough Prairie)
from the confluence of the Kiamichi and Red rivers (near the Fasken and Wright Plantation sites)
as far downstream as the mouth of Big Pine Creek,
several km below the Roitsch site itself.
In modern times, the middle reaches of the Red
River were well-watered, with about 110-120 cm
of precipitation annually. The area also has a mild,
humid, sub-tropical climate with more than a 220
day growing season (Thomas 1977:88). Generally
modern climatic conditions were established in the
region about 5000 years ago.
This part of Northeast Texas was settled first
by mobile hunter-gatherers as early as 12,000
years ago (the Paleoindian period), if not before,
and was used by Archaic foragers for millennia
(Bousman et al. 2004; Fields and Tomka 1993).
About 2000-2500 years ago in Northeast Texas,
however, around the onset of the Woodland period,

Perttula—The Archeology of the Roitsch Site (41RR16) 319
the prehistoric Native Americans living in the Red
River basin began to settle down in small hamlets
and camps dispersed across recognizable territories
(Bruseth 1998; Perttula et al. 1993; Schambach
1982). These Native American groups made thick
and usually plain grog-tempered pottery (Williams
Plain), and used Gary and Kent dart points for
hunting and other tasks (Story 1990). About A.D.
700, these groups began to make and use small
stemmed arrow points for hunting.
The principal occupation of Red River and
Lamar counties in prehistoric and early historic
times (up to about A.D. 1800) was by Caddo
speaking groups (specifically the Kadohadacho
and affiliated groups, see Swanton 1942) that
lived in settled horticultural and agricultural
communities (principally farmsteads and small
hamlets), and larger villages were situated along
the Red River during much of the prehistoric
and early historic era along the Red River (e.g.,
Story 1990; Perttula 1992; Bruseth 1998:55-62).
The current chronology of prehistoric and early
historic Caddo periods and phases in the middle
Red River valley is provided in Table 1.
Caddo archeological sites in the region are
known to be located on elevated landforms (alluvial terraces and rises, natural levees, and
upland edges) adjacent to the major streams, as
well as along the minor tributaries and spring-fed
branches. They are also located in proximity to arable sandy loam soils, presumably for cultivation
purposes (see Perttula 2001, this volume). These
Caddo groups were powerful theocratic chiefdoms
that built mounds for political and religious purposes and functions, traded extensively across the
region and with non-Caddo-speaking groups, and
in certain settings (including the Red River basin),
developed intensive maize-producing economies.

Certainly the best known prehistoric Caddo
period in the middle Red River valley is the Late
Caddo period and the McCurtain phase. Bruseth
(1998) provides the most current discussion of the
archeological character of the Late Caddo McCurtain phase, which includes farmsteads, villages,
and mound centers along a 50 km stretch of the
Red River in northeastern Texas and southeastern
Oklahoma, as well as on tributaries (such as Mountain Fork River, Kiamichi River, Glover Creek, and
the Little River) that drain the southern Ouachita
Mountains (see Bruseth 1998:Figure 3-9). From
stable isotope and bioarcheological evidence, the
McCurtain phase Caddo were agricultural peoples,
depending heavily on the cultivation of maize as
the main staple of the diet (Rose et al. 1998; Colby
1997). Like other Late Caddo period groups on
the Red River, the McCurtain phase settlement
pattern includes numerous habitation sites (with
household cemeteries) and mound centers—such
as the Roitsch, Dan Holdeman (Perino 1995), and
Rowland Clark (Perino 1994) sites in northeastern
Texas, and A. W. Davis (Wilson 1962), Clement
(Bell and Baerreis 1951), and Cowell (34MC221)
sites in southeastern Oklahoma—although the
mounds appear to have mainly been constructed
between ca. A.D. 1300-1500.
Bruseth (1998:62) suggests that the Caddo
settlements along this stretch of the Red River
resembled the Teran-Soule model (i.e., Schambach
et al. 1983; Trubowitz 1984) in that Caddo villages
were composed of individual compounds of houses
and other structures associated with mounds and
the residence of a caddi or chief (Figure 4). There
is no evidence of vacant areas around these Red
River ceremonial centers, however, as Schambach
et al. (1983) had postulated when they developed
the Teran-Soule model.

The density of McCurtain phase sites indicates
that “greater numbers of people were living in
closer proximity than before” (Bruseth 1998:64).
At the Roitsch site, the mound in McCurtain phase
times was used as a place for the burial of the social elite, as a shaft tomb with 10 individuals and
many grave goods was located near the center of
the mound (Skinner et al. 1969). Special purpose
salt-processing sites (such as the Salt Well Slough
site [41RR204]) are also common in the vicinity
of the Roitsch site (see Kenmotsu 2001, 2006).
Due to diseases introduced by Europeans, and
the incursions of the Osage into the Red River valley to obtain deer hides and Caddo slaves, by the
late 1700s (ca. 1795), the Kadohadacho groups had
abandoned the Red River basin (see Smith 1998,
2005). These Caddo groups subsequently moved to
the Caddo Lake area along the Louisiana and Texas
borders (see Parsons et al. 2002) as well as various
settlements south of Caddo Lake (Tiller 2007).
Culture Historical Overview
The Arnold Roitsch site and other sites that were
investigated for the Field School have occupations
extending from the Late Archaic through the Historic
periods. It was doubtful that occupations earlier than

this would be found at the sites selected for the Field
School since they are situated on landforms in the
Red River alluvial valley that appear to have formed
over the last 2000 to 3000 years. Consequently, this
cultural historical overview will begin with the Late
Archaic period and extends through the early part of
the Historic period.
Late Archaic Period (2000 B.C. to 500 B.C.)
The Late Archaic period is generally thought
to reflect a mobile hunting and gathering way of
life by the aboriginal occupants of the Red River
valley and local region. During this time, small
bands of people moved from place to place in
search of wild game and plants for food. A wide
variety of faunal and floral resources was exploited, although few subsistence data exist to support this conclusion. Much of our assessment of
the Late Archaic period in the middle Red River
area is based on references to surrounding areas
where better information is available. A number of
archeologists (e.g., Story 1985; McGregor 1987;
Bruseth and Martin 1987; Fields and Tomka 1993)
have suggested that populations densities during
this period were high relative to earlier periods,
and it is probable that this led to a reduction in

Perttula—The Archeology of the Roitsch Site (41RR16) 321
the sizes of band territories as well as increased
settlement permanence.
Common artifact styles for the Late Archaic
period along the Red River valley of Texas include
Edgewood, Ellis, Gary, Palmillas, and Yarbrough
dart points and several types of ground stone objects, including grooved stone axes, and less frequently, gorgets. Chipped stone axes and stemmed
hoes are also seen in artifact assemblages. Within
the Late Archaic period, there is little available
data to support a more detailed artifact sequence
because few well stratified sites have been excavated in Northeast Texas (Story 1990a).
Woodland Period (500 B.C. to A.D. 900)
The Woodland period is generally noted by the
first occurrence of ceramics on archeological sites
along the Red River and tributaries. Sites of this
period are often small, apparently impermanent or
semi-permanent, habitations located in elevated
landforms bordering natural lakes, relic channels,
and terraces of major river systems. Some sites
can be larger and contain significant quantities of
midden deposits, forming “midden mounds” (see
Galm 1984), although such midden mounds have
not been identified to date in northeastern Texas
Sandy paste wares—vessels with great quantities of sand added to the clay—are among the first
ceramics to occur in northeastern Texas (Story
1990a), but plain grog-tempered pottery has been
found in early Woodland contexts (see Rogers et
al. 2001) in the Sabine River basin in northeastern
Texas as well as along the Red River (Schambach
1982, 1998, 2002). It is possible that the introduction of ceramics may have occurred earlier than the
date we have listed for the beginning of this period
(cf. Galm and Flynn 1978:155-156), but the lack of
dated components for the Red River valley requires
a conservative estimate at this time.
Other artifacts diagnostic of the Woodland period include double-bitted axes, dart points most commonly of the small and relatively narrow contracting
stem Gary type, and at ca. A.D. 700, expanding stem
arrow points, such as Scallorn points. The arrow
points, importantly, signal the introduction of the
bow and arrow technology that quite likely resulted
in an increase in hunting efficiency.
Fourche Maline is a cultural designation used
for Woodland period sites in southwestern Arkansas,
southeastern Oklahoma, and parts of northeastern
Texas by Schambach (1982, 1998, 2001, 2002). It

is noted by the presence of thick flowerpot-shaped,
bone-tempered, grit-tempered, or grog-tempered
vessels. Other artifacts include Gary projectile
points, double-bitted chipped stone axes or hoes,
platform type pipes, Poole ceramic pipes, and boat
stones. Burials are often flexed or semi-flexed,
and found in village middens, although some are
cremated or buried in small earthen mounds (see
Schambach 1982; Webb 1984). Presently, it is not
clear how far the Fourche Maline culture extends
into the Red River valley of Texas.
Coles Creek is another culture for which artifacts are occasionally found along the Red River
valley of Texas and surrounding areas in contexts
apparently dating before A.D. 900. This culture
was originally defined for the lower Mississippi
valley by Ford (1936:172-218) and is used to refer
to sites with predominantly horizontally incised ceramics and the wide-spread use of flat-topped, rectangular or square platform mounds at ceremonial
sites (Haag 1971:22-28). The occurrence of Coles
Creek style ceramics on middle Red River sites is
most likely the result of the trade and exchange of
pottery vessels—as well as a borrowing of ceramic
styles—rather than a product of settlement by
lower Mississippi valley aboriginal groups.
Formative Caddo and Middle Caddo Periods
(A.D. 900 to 1300)
Archeological sites dating after ca. A.D.
900 are abundant in the middle part of the Red
River basin in northeastern Texas and southeastern
Oklahoma. Formative Caddo period Albion phase
components are present all along the Red River
valley of Texas and along major tributaries such as
Big Pine Creek. A number of cultural innovations
caused significant changes during this period. First,
a more efficient hunting strategy continued to develop following the introduction of the bow and arrow during the Woodland period. We see the nearly
total replacement of dart points by arrow points in
the archeological record after ca. A.D. 700. Second, the likely introduction of more productive
varieties of maize and other tropical cultigens,
especially during the Middle Caddo period Mound
Prairie phase, supplemented the collecting of wild
plants and the hunting of animals. Hunting-fishinggathering activities were still important, however,
particularly the exploitation of deer, fish, and small
mammals. Sedentary communities, mound centers,
and short-term campsites reflect the dispersion of

322

Texas Archeological Society

the population near arable soils, forested habitats,
and dependable freshwater sources.
During these periods a wide variety of finely
made ceramics were made by the prehistoric Caddo
peoples. Many of the ceramics were quite elaborately decorated and have been classified as types
Crockett Curvilinear Incised, East Incised, Holly
Fine Engraved, Hickory Fine Engraved, Maxey
Noded Red Ware, Pennington Punctated-Incised,
Sanders Engraved, and Spiro Engraved (Suhm et
al. 1954; Suhm and Jelks 1962). Several varieties
of Red River style long-stemmed clay pipes were
manufactured during this period (see Hoffman
1967). Common arrow points include stemmed
varieties such as the Alba, Bonham, Hayes, and
Morris types.
Late Caddo Period (A.D. 1300 to 1700)
A similar way of life for the Caddo peoples
of the Red River valley of Texas continued into
the Late Caddo period McCurtain phase. The
production and utilization of maize, beans, and
squash appears to have become a more important
part of the economy, although hunting remained
an important subsistence practice. While there
may have been changes in regional settlement,
the basic types of sites remained the same: small
settlements of one to several farmsteads, and
larger communities with mounds; the communities probably resembled the Nasoni Caddo village
mapped in 1691 by Domingo Teran de los Rios—
referred to as the “Teran Map” (see Figure 4). All
these types of Late Caddo period settlements are
known to occur in the local area. Another type of
site that might be present is a salt-making camp.
Salt springs are known along Salt Well Slough,
and three sites are known to occur in association
with a salt spring in the vicinity of the Roitsch site
(see Figure 2 and Kenmotsu 2001, 2006).
Common artifacts for this period include a
number of ceramic and arrow point types. The
most distinctive ceramic type—and likely to be
the most frequently found during excavations—is
the red slipped vessels of Avery Engraved, a wellcrafted fine ware. The distinctive design of this
type is a rising sun motif appearing on the rim of
vessels (see Suhm and Jelks 1962: Plates 1 and
2). Other types include Emory Punctated-Incised,
Nash Neck Banded, Simms Engraved, and Taylor Engraved. Arrow point types include Fresno,
Maud, and Bassett.

Historic Period (A.D. 1700 to 1850)
Historic Caddo Indian occupations, with European trade goods (particularly glass beads), have
been reported from a number of sites on the Red
River in Northeast Texas, including Sam Kaufman,
Bob Williams, and Wright Plantation in the Mound
Prairie area (Perino 1983; Perttula 1989, 1993).
Recent excavations across the region indicate that
Historic Caddo settlements were primarily small
dispersed farmsteads and hamlets with associated
household cemeteries (cf. Story 1995). Although
the reasons are not clearly established, the regional
population appears to have been much lower than
during the Late Caddo period, and it is likely that
the introduction of European epidemic diseases
and Osage Indian depredations contributed to the
decreasing permanent Caddo settlement of the Red
River valley after the beginning of the 18th century.
Archeological evidence suggests that the Caddo
settlement of the local area lasted primarily until
ca. A.D. 1730.
Material culture items on Historic Caddo archeological sites include a wide variety of native
ceramics, including Emory Punctated-Incised,
Hodges Engraved, Foster Trailed-Incised, Hudson
Engraved, Nash Neck Banded, Natchitoches Engraved, and Simms Engraved, along with stone,
bone, and shell tools, implements, and ornaments.
Arrow points include the Maud type. These artifacts are often accompanied by such European
trade goods as guns and gun parts, glass beads,
metal kettles, hatchets, knifes, hoes, lead balls,
and silver, brass, copper, and iron ornaments. Most
of these items were obtained by the Caddo from
the French as annual presents or as payments for
maize, deer or bison pelts, horses, and bear oil obtained from Caddo traders.
Archival and historical documents indicate that
in the early part of the 19th century the Western
Cherokee had a village on the Red River near the
mouth of the Kiamichi River (Everett 1990:34, 51)
and near to the Anglo-American community of
Jonesborough. This village was called Tahchee’s
Village. There currently is no known archeological
evidence of this Cherokee village, but we might
expect with some scrutiny to find Cherokee pottery,
silver ornaments, metal arrow points, chipped bottle
glass, glass beads, and Euro-American ceramics,
gun parts, gunflints, and metal tools in the area.
The town site of Jonesborough (see Figure
2) is reported to be one of the two earliest

Perttula—The Archeology of the Roitsch Site (41RR16) 323
Anglo-American settlement in Texas (Webb
1952:928), and was settled in 1814, several
generations after the Caddo had left this part of
northeastern Texas. At that time, the site was
part of Hempstead County in Arkansas Territory.
Jonesborough was largely abandoned in the mid1840s (Reese 2001; Steely n.d.). The town was
visited by many persons who are famous in Texas
history, including David Crockett, Jim Bowie, and
Stephen F. Austin.

RESEARCH GOALS OF
THE ARCHEOLOGICAL
INVESTIGATIONS
by James E. Bruseth and Timothy K. Perttula
Goals of the Field School Investigations
Several research goals developed prior to the
1991 and 1992 excavations guided the archeological investigations at the Roitsch site and neighboring sites during the Texas Archeological Society
Field Schools on the Red River and tributaries. In
this section these problems are defined and discussed; a few comments are also in order about the
research problems that are discussed below. Many
are broad and addressable only by the analysis of
archeological data from many sites beyond that
of what may be recovered from the Roitsch site.
In 1991 and 1992, we viewed the Field School as
an initial study of the archeology of the Red River
valley, an area that has been neglected by recent
archeological researchers in Texas. We have tried
to focus on those research issues most in need of
study at that time. Although some of the problems
are quite broad, we were confident that data would
be collected during the Field School to begin
addressing most, if not all, of them.
More comprehensive resolution of the
research problems will come from comparison
with archeological data that may be obtained from
surrounding sites in the Red River valley. It is also
probable that some of the problems will only be
fully resolved through future fieldwork at new sites.
To ensure that there is a continuity in the resolution
of such research problems, the Field School efforts
were used to develop study units for the Northeast
Texas Archeological Plan, developed by the Texas
Historical Commission (Kenmotsu and Perttula
1993). This should hopefully encourage future

archeological projects to address unresolved
research problems for the Red River valley.
Improve the Chronology
Unquestionably, the most basic archeological research problem for the Red River valley is
improving our understanding of the prehistoric
chronology and cultural historical sequence for
the area. Few detailed chronological studies have
been undertaken at sites in this area; instead, attempts to develop and understand the Red River
valley of Texas temporal framework have borrowed heavily from surrounding regions. While
the chronology of all major prehistoric periods are
in need of re-examination, the Woodland through
Late Caddo periods are in greatest need, and these
are the periods for which we expected to recover
relevant archeological and chronological data during the Field Schools. Greater details on the major
chronological issues are described below.
A brief note is needed at this point on the use
of the term focus in the following discussion. In
recent years, the convention has been to discard
the term focus for the use of the word phase, or in
some instances, the broader word “culture” (a collection of related phases). While we support this
change and the accompanying taxonomic clarity
achieved (cf. Willey and Phillips 1958), our purpose here is to describe the present chronological
framework as it existed in 1991-1992 when these
research goals were formulated, and to indicate
areas where revisions were sorely needed. It was
assumed that as the research design was implemented, and new archeological and chronological
data was obtained, new phases would be defined
from the old foci for the Red River valley of
Texas; such is indeed the case (see Table 1), as is
discussed throughout this article.
Fourche Maline Culture
One of the more troublesome issues is the
paucity of Fourche Maline sites in the Texas and
Oklahoma portions of the Red River valley. As
noted previously, these sites are defined for the
Woodland period along the Red River in southwestern Arkansas, and are proposed for much of
eastern Texas by Schambach (1982:133, 1998,
2001, 2002). Story (1990a:293) has argued that
Schambach’s Fourche Maline cul ture is too
long-lived and likely includes culturally diverse

324

Texas Archeological Society

groups. As an alternative for the southern portions
of eastern Texas, she identifies the Mossy Grove
culture for Woodland period peoples who made
sandy paste ceramics and used Gary dart points
(Story 1990a:256). This cultural group is thought
to have lived primarily south of the Sabine River
of Northeast Texas. Were Fourche Maline people
present along the Red River in Texas? Does the
Mossy Grove concept apply north of the Sabine
River for groups living in Northeast Texas?
Since artifacts that relate to the Woodland
period—namely Williams Plain ceramics and Gary
dart points—have been found at the Roitsch site in
the past (Skinner et al. 1969; Harris 1953), future
work at the site was considered likely to provide
additional data to help understand the types of
Woodland period occupations that occurred in this
portion of the Red River valley. We also anticipated
that data from this period would be obtained from
work at other sites found during the archeological
survey of the Roitsch property (and a few sites dating to this period were found, see Perttula 2001,
and this volume), and quite possibly during testing
at the Fasken Mound (see Prikryl 2001, and this
volume). As part of the analysis and synthesis of the
archeological data, should discrete Woodland period
archeological deposits be identified during the Field
Schools, the concepts of Mossy Grove and Fourche
Maline were to be reviewed, and examined for their
applicability to this part of the Red River valley of
Texas. We believe that the resolution of this research
problem will come from careful examination of the
existing data base combined with analysis of relevant archeological data recovered from the Field
School survey and excavation data.
Coles Creek Culture
As noted above, Coles Creek is a lower Mississippi Valley cultural designation for sites dating
from ca. A.D. 700-1200, that among other cultural
traits had distinctively decorated ceramics and
flat-topped, rectangular, or square-shaped earthen
mounds (see Kidder 1998:129-130 and Figure 6.2).
Over the years, researchers have noted the occurrence of Coles Creek type ceramics at several sites
in northwestern Louisiana, southeastern Arkansas,
and northeastern Texas (Dickinson 1936:68; Webb
and Dodd 1939:115-118; Hoffman 1970:154; Story
1990b).
A number of arguments have been made regarding the presence of Coles Creek ceramics in

the Red River valley. For instance, Gregory (1991)
had hypothesized that early Coles Creek ceramics
were simply a type of ceramics used by Alto phase
Caddo peoples. Such an interpretation would not
require the introduction of new people into the
area, but would instead view these Coles Creek
ceramics as simply the addition of new decorative styles to a pre-existing ceramic assemblage.
Moreover, he suggested that Coles Creek style
ceramics were made later than generally thought
by most Texas archeologists working in Northeast
Texas, as late as A.D. 1200 (Pete Gregory, personal
communication, 1991).
Others have noted that Coles Creek ceramics precede Caddo style ceramics where good
archeological and/or stratified contexts have been
observed, particularly in burial mounds (Schambach 1982; Durham and Davis 1975), such as at
the Crenshaw site in southwestern Arkansas. To
some, this might seem to present an obstacle to the
acceptance of Gregory’s hypothesis regarding the
occurrence of Coles Creek ceramics in the Caddo
archeological area. Story (1990a:323) has also
noted that the initial development of Caddo culture
is preceded by the occurrence of lower Mississippi
Valley (LMV) type ceramics on Woodland sites in
the region, and that the development of prehistoric
Caddo society and the appearance of LMV ceramics must be related phenomena, but she provided
no additional suggestions on what the relationship
might be.
Since Coles Creek type ceramics have been
found at the Roitsch site (Skinner et al. 1969) and
at the neighboring Williams site (Perino 1983), it
was considered likely that additional Coles Creek
ceramics will be found during the Field School.
The controlled recovery of these ceramics in datable archeological contexts, in addition to those
previously collected, may provide an opportunity
to address the issue of what Coles Creek and Coles
Creek ceramics represent culturally in the Red
River valley of northeastern Texas.
Sanders Focus or Phase
The Sanders focus represents one of the more
commonly used cultural terms in Northeast Texas
archeology, yet one of the most poorly defined,
as has been pointed out repeatedly by Schambach
(1999, see also Schambach 1995). Temporal placement of the Sanders focus or phase is generally
accepted to be between ca. A.D. 1100 and 1300.

Perttula—The Archeology of the Roitsch Site (41RR16) 325
The concept of the Sanders focus was originally formulated by Krieger (1946:172) to describe
a cultural manifestation that occupied either side
of the Red River on the border between the eastern forests and the western prairies (see Bruseth
1998: Figure 3-8). The definition of the focus was
based largely on excavations at the Sanders site
(41LR2), located near the Red River in Lamar
County, Texas. Excavations were conducted by a
Works Progress Administration (WPA) crew, under
the direction of A. T. Jackson, primarily in one of
two mounds at the site. Twenty-one burials were
recovered, and a number of associated grave goods
were found, including dis tinctively decorated
ceramic vessels, copper-covered ear spools, shell
beads, and engraved conch shell. Ceramic types
included Sanders Engraved, Sanders Plain, and
Maxey Noded Redware; the Bonham arrow point
type was the principal arrow point affiliated with
the Sanders focus. Krieger (1946:172) noted that
a second grouping of Sanders focus sites lie in the
upper reaches of the Sabine River in Van Zandt,
Wood, and Hopkins counties.
A short time later, Bell and Baerreis (1951:53)
defined the Nelson focus from the WPA excavations at the Cook and Nelson sites, located directly
across the Red River in Oklahoma (see Bruseth
1998: Figure 3-8), as a separate focus from the
Sanders focus. They, however, did note:
Though there are important differences
[between the Nelson and Sanders foci], the
complex designated as the Nelson focus
shares a large series of traits with the Sanders focus now known primarily through
manifestations in Texas. The Nelson
focus may possibly represent a peripheral
variant of this culture, strongly influenced
and modified by contacts with Spiro focus
components in Oklahoma.

The excavations at the Nelson and Cook sites
have never been published, and we have little information on which to judge the validity of the Nelson
focus as a separate cultural designation from the
Sanders focus. From work across the Red River at
Hugo Reservoir on the Kiamichi River, several sites
were investigated that contained components relating to the Sanders focus (Burton 1970; Rohrbaugh
1973), but this work provided little help in sorting
out the elements of the Sanders Focus. In fact, quite
to the contrary, Rohrbaugh (1973:205-210) added
to the taxonomic confusion by creating the Apple

phase, a new taxonomic designation for these Early
Caddo to Middle Caddo period components. There
is even considerable doubt about the utility of the
Sanders focus, since it is based largely on work
from only the Sanders site, and the entire issue of
the Early to Middle Caddo period phases on the
Red River is badly in need of overhaul.
Since ceramics and features radiocarbondated to the time of the Sanders focus have been
found at the Roitsch site (Skinner et al. 1969), we
considered it quite likely that additional artifacts
and features of this cultural phase would be encountered during the TAS Field Schools. In fact,
to the north and east of the East Mound, many
artifacts and features may be encountered that
could be associated with a Sanders focus or phase
occupation, based on the results of the 1968 work
by SMU (Skinner et al. 1969: Figure 5). Possible
Early to Middle Caddo components have been seen
at other sites further down the Red River as far as
the Holdeman site (41RR11) at Albion, Texas, and
information from these sites may also be relevant
to gaining a better understanding of the Sanders
focus or phase, as well as the archeology of the
Early to Middle Caddo periods on the Red River.
Based on the recovery of grog-tempered ceramics
from the Fasken site and vicinity, and the type
of mound construction—with the large platform
mound—it was thought to be probable that the
work at the Fasken Mounds site would yield data
relating to this phase, and in fact, the occupation
of the site and construction of its various mounds
may date principally to ca. A.D. 1100-1300 (see
Prikryl 2001, and this volume).
McCurtain Focus or Phase
The McCurtain Focus was defined by Bell
and Baerreis (1951:53-61) to describe Late Caddo
period manifestations in southeastern Oklahoma
on the basis of excavations at the Clement and McDonald sites (see Bruseth 1998: Figure 3-9). The
most distinctive element of the focus or phase are
the ceramics, with the type Avery Engraved being
most commonly recovered and viewed as diagnostic of the focus. Subsequent workers in Northeast
Texas have used this cultural designation, and
have temporally expanded it to a temporal range
of A.D. 1300 to 1700 (Perino 1983:72). Others in
southeastern Oklahoma have further modified the
concept by equating portions of the McCurtain
focus with sites belonging to the Mountain Fork

326

Texas Archeological Society

complex in the southern Ouachita Mountains
(Wyckoff 1967), mixing elements from what appear to be several cultural phases. The net result
was, as aptly noted by Story (1990a:331), to make
the McCurtain focus a hodgepodge.
Much of the data from work at the Roitsch site
and other sites to be found during the archeological
survey of the Roitsch Farm will undoubtedly come
from components that can be classified as belonging to the McCurtain focus or phase. The large
shaft grave and a majority of other graves found at
the site by Skinner et al. (1969) are representative
features of the McCurtain focus or phase, and it
was probable that other features and burials would
be found during the TAS Field Schools that relate
to this focus or phase. These archeological data,
together with existing information from other sites,
and a suite of radiocarbon dates from good occupational contexts (e.g., Bruseth 1998: Figure 3-3),
should be suitable to work the McCurtain focus
or phase into more meaningful cultural taxonomic
units. Several people have suggested that certain
ceramic styles change over the duration of the focus or phase (Skinner et al. 1969; Perino 1983:72;
Perttula 1992), and that they can be used to seriate
the different components that comprise the focus
or phase. These suggestions can be explored during
the course of the archeological investigations at the
Roitsch site, and should well-preserved features
(including burial features) be encountered, a seriation of McCurtain focus or phase archeological
deposits and burials at the site can be attempted
utilizing the whole vessels found in association
with them.
Understanding The Village Structure
at the Roitsch Site
Although professional and avocational archeological excavations have been undertaken at
the Roitsch site over a period of at least 40-50
years, most of this work was devoted to uncovering burials. Well over a hundred burials have been
recovered by these efforts. Pot hunters have also
been looting the site for more than 60 years, and
it is estimated that these individuals have dug several hundred other burials (Perttula 1993, see also
below). The fact that so many burials have been
excavated is testimony to the intense settlement
that occurred at the site in prehistoric and early
historic period times over several hundred years
by the Caddo people.

But the emphasis of previous efforts on the
cemeteries at the Roitsch site underscores one of
the major weakness of the present data base: namely, we have little systematically collected data from
habitation areas. Features such as house patterns,
hearths, pits with food remains, and artifact caches
have been found, but little attention has been given
to their careful excavation and detailed reporting.
Consequently, this will be a major focus of our
efforts at Roitsch, and by doing so, we hopefully
should learn more about the intra-site arrangement
of activities within the Caddo community that is
represented by the Roitsch site.
We propose, however, to also spend some time
re-investigating the East Mound, and its function
within the Roitsch site village. SMU spent considerable effort in this part of the site, and dug many
backhoe trenches and examined several features,
including the deep shaft burial described earlier.
Based on their work, they concluded that the mound
was not a man-made structure in the usual sense of
a mound, but that it might represent the product of
flood deposition (Skinner et al. 1969:17). Although
SMU workers may be correct in their assessment,
certain characteristics of the East Mound bear closer inspection during the TAS Field Schools. First,
the large shaft grave was found directly below the
central portion of the mound. This is a tradition
often seen at earlier Caddo civic-ceremonial sites
where a mound was constructed over a burial tomb
for an important person. The best example of this
is the grave beneath Mound C at the George C.
Davis site (Story 1990a:339-341, 1997). Second,
the shaft burial at the Roitsch site was found within
a rectangular structure that may have served as a
ceremonial temple or perhaps as a charnel house.
The fact that both the house and the shaft grave
were directly underneath the mound was reason
enough to propose reopening the mound trenches
and re-examining the profiles. The ceramics from
the shaft grave date the feature to the Late Caddo
period, McCurtain phase; calibrated dates from two
of the individuals buried in the shaft tomb range
from AD 1412-1511 and AD 1431-1513 (Perttula
1998: Table 1). If the mound is found to be a manmade feature during the TAS work, this would be
evidence that mound building—long considered
to be principally an Early to Middle Caddo period
activity in the Middle Red River—continued at this
site into the Late Caddo period.
At a broader level, we propose to also collect
archeological information during the Field School

Perttula—The Archeology of the Roitsch Site (41RR16) 327
to test the appropriateness of the Teran map as a
model of inter-site settlement for the Roitsch area
along the Red River. This will be accomplished
by trying to identify separate contemporaneous
household areas in patterns similar to that shown in
the 1691 Teran map (see Figure 4). The individual
house and cemetery areas found by Perino (1983)
at the adjoining Williams site provide initial support for this supposition, but additional habitation
data from the Roitsch part of the village are needed
to fully explore this research issue.
To begin to test the appropriateness of the
Teran map as a settlement model, a broader area
than the Roitsch site will need to be investigated.
Therefore, we propose that an intensive survey be
undertaken of hundreds of acres of adjacent land.
The owner of the site, Mr. Arnold E. A. Roitsch,
is allowing us to survey portions of his 7,000 acre
farm, and this survey should undoubtedly locate
several associated farmsteads and other domestic
and residential Caddo sites (see Perttula 2001,
and this volume). In fact, from the earlier efforts
of SMU (Hyatt and Mosca 1972) in this area, we
already know of several prehistoric Caddo sites on
the Roitsch property. After these sites are recorded,
testing may be conducted at one or two that offer
the greatest promise for testing the applicability of
the Teran map vis a vis how individual prehistoric
Caddo households were organized. These will be
the types of sites most likely to contain evidence
of structures, pits, and post holes, as well as good
evidence for contemporaneous occupation with the
Roitsch and Bob Williams household clusters (i.e.,
date to a certain segment of the McCurtain focus or
phase). They may also have datable deposits, and
preserved animal and plant remains, that will allow
us to investigate Late Caddo subsistence patterns.
Identify the Historic Tribal Affiliation of the
Sam Kaufman or Roitsch Site
Harris (1953), Skinner et al. (1969), Wright
(1938), and Perino (1983) have all noted the presence of historic European trade materials with the
aboriginal Caddo occupations at the Roitsch and
adjoining Williams sites (see also Banks and Banks
2002). These have been found in burials, where they
are associated with what would otherwise be classified as prehistoric artifacts, and from the surface of
the site. Perino (1983) suggested that the Williams
site dates to as late as A.D. 1700, although artifacts
found by Harris (1953) would suggest a somewhat

later date for the Roitsch site Caddo occupation; the
recovery of Keno Trailed, var. Phillips vessels at the
site suggest a Caddo occupation of some parts of the
site dating as late as the early 18th century (Perttula
2006:135). Given the fact that the site has a historic
component, there may be a possibility of relating
the archeological deposits to one of the historic Native American groups from the area noted by early
travelers and explorers, although it seems most
likely that this historic component is the product of
a Caddo settlement.
Further down the Red River, around the Great
Bend, Hoffman (1970) has associated the Little
River phase with the Upper Nasoni Caddo, and
Schambach (1983:10) has related the Chakanina
phase with the second village (late 1780s) of the
Kadohadacho. Can the Roitsch and Williams sites
be associated with another grouping of the historic
Caddo, such as the Nanatsoho (Swanton 1942)?
Little is know about this group of historic Caddo
tribes that lived on the upper Red River, and after
about 1750 they apparently disappeared as a distinctive group.
Alternatively, Williams (1964:565) had suggested some years ago that the Roitsch site may be
associated with the historic Kichai. Although many
people relate this group to the Historic Wichita tribes
that moved into Texas during the early 18th century,
others have suggested that they resided south of
the Sabine River during prehistoric times (Story
1990a:346; Hughes 1968:297; Lorrain 1967:33-37).
This latter situation would make an ethnic association
with the Roitsch site a possibility, although remote.
More archival research in the Spanish and
French documents and careful analysis of the existing artifactual and archival data, together with
a thorough examination of any new archeological
data from ca. A.D. 1700-1730 contexts collected
during the Field School, may allow this issue to be
addressed in more detail. Determining the ethnic
affiliations of the Roitsch site historic occupation
would have important implications for the area’s
archeology, as would a more definitive association
with another, but heretofore unsuspected, aboriginal Red River group. For instance, if the historic
occupants at the Roitsch site can be convincingly
linked to one of the historic Caddo groups known
to have lived in this part of the Red River valley
(cf. Swanton 1942: Figure 1), this would imply that
the Caddo occupied a longer stretch of the Red River in northeastern Texas than has previously been
recognized simply from the historic documents,

328

Texas Archeological Society

which date primarily after the mid-part of the 18th
century. While archeologically this has long been
known, historically (i.e., from the mid-18th century
on) the Caddo are not reported as occupying the
Red River as far upstream as the Roitsch site. If, alternatively, the Kichai were the historic occupants
of the Roitsch site, then we would have intriguing
information as to the origins of this tribe, known
almost exclusively through historic documents and
archival sources. The Kichai are conventionally
considered to have come into Texas from the north
in the late 17th century and to be affiliated with the
Wichita tribe (Rohrbaugh 1982). As a cautionary
note, however, it should be mentioned that we may
recover too little archeological data to link the historic occupation of the site to any known historic
aboriginal group.
Analyze Human Subsistence in the Red River
Valley of Texas
There are a number of ways in which we can
study the nature of human subsistence in this
part of the Red River from the Late Archaic to
the Historic Caddo periods. The most basic ways
are to directly examine and identify the plant and
animal remains preserved in datable archeological
deposits in the TAS Field School sites. Specialists
with expertise in the analysis of these materials will
attempt to document patterns of plant and animal
use through time, and based upon their absolute
and relative frequencies in archeological deposits,
they can offer evidence to determine the types of
resources that were most important to the prehistoric and/or early historic inhabitants of the Red
River Valley.
Bonnie C. Yates, Brian Shaffer, and Bill McClure have studied the animal remains from the
Field School sites (see below). Both the Roitsch
and the Ray sites contained well-preserved animal
remains. The types of research problems they were
to pursue included: (a) determining patterns of
important game animal exploitation (such as deer)
by Woodland and Caddo populations living along
a major stream such as the Red River as opposed
to populations living on tributary streams and in
upland habitats, and (b) the exploitation of prairie
animal species (such as bison). Also of interest
in investigating human subsistence from animal
remains was how antler and bone tool technologies
changed through time in horticultural and agricultural Caddo economies, as these tools should be

informative about changes in the processing and
use of wild animals, especially the exploitation of
large game animals.
Gayle J. Fritz and S. Eileen Goldborer analyzed
the charred and preserved plant remains from the
different excavated Field School sites (see below,
this article). Charred remains were recovered in
1991 through the flotation of soil fill from a variety
of cultural features at the Roitsch, Ray, Fasken, and
Salt Well Slough sites, and considerable numbers
of features in 1992 from Roitsch, Ray, and Fasken
also contained charred plant remains. We expected
that corn should be recovered from a number of
samples at the Roitsch and Ray sites, along with
charred seeds, nuts, and various woods. Similar
types of plant remains should also be found at
Fasken and Salt Well Slough, although with the
limited number of features likely to be encountered
it is possible that less diverse plant remains will be
documented there.
Of particular research interest for the study of
the plant remains is how did Woodland and prehistoric Caddo subsistence patterns change with the
introduction and adoption of tropical domesticates
such as corn, beans, and squash. Available plant and
bioarcheological data (especially stable carbon isotope analyses of prehistoric Caddo human remains)
suggests that corn did not become the predominant
food source in much of the Caddo archeological
area until after ca. A.D. 1300 (see Perttula 1996,
2008), but the timing of such subsistence changes
in the Red River valley is still poorly understood.
Data from the Field School should contribute to
a better understanding of subsistence changes
through time. Before corn became an important
resource, native seed-bearing domesticates such
as sumpweed, sunflower, knotweed, chenopod,
maygrass, amaranth, and little barley were cultivated in parts of what are considered the Caddo
archeological area (especially on the Arkansas
River and the Ozark Highland) (Fritz 1990). It will
be important to determine if these plants were also
cultivated in the Red River valley, and to determine
when did their use become common.
The human skeletal remains from the Roitsch
site will be studied by D. Gentry Steele and colleagues at Texas A&M University (see Derrick et
al., this article). Physical anthropological observations and stable isotope analyses of the remains
should contribute important information on Late
Caddo period adaptive efficiency, nutritional status,
and the character of their diet since the recovered

Perttula—The Archeology of the Roitsch Site (41RR16) 329
burials from the Field School are expected to date
from McCurtain phase times.
In an excellent synthesis of the bioarcheology
of the human skeletal populations from the Red
River valley, Burnett (1990) offered a number of
interesting comments. Most importantly for the archeological study of the Red River valley of Texas,
she noted:
...the caries [cavities] data suggest that
the Caddoan [sic] residents of KaufmanWilliams-Roden relied upon a different
diet, likely dependent upon maize with
some indication of nutritional inadequacy. Conversely, their neighbors, the Late
Caddoan [sic] residents of the HatchelMitchell [-Moores] sites, relied upon a
diet that was not carbohydrate rich and
was more nutritionally adequate (Burnett
1990:395).

Burnett suggested that the Late Caddo and
Historic Caddo period inhabitants of the HatchelMitchell-Moores area in Bowie County, Texas,
were not utilizing maize, but were instead relying
on food sources only available from the Piney
Woods region of the eastern portions of the Red
River valley of Texas. This possible Late Caddo
adaptation to the Piney Woods is intriguing, but
is not in keeping with the documentary evidence
which suggests that the historic Caddo groups
were all horticulturists—and fairly intensive ones
at that—especially those groups living in the Great
Bend area of the Red River (Swanton 1942). Furthermore, the analysis of Caddo site locations by
landform undertaken by Gilmore and McCormick
(1982:Figure 11) for the Red River valley shows
a marked tendency for Caddo sites to be situated
on alluvial terraces of the Red River. This is likely
due to the adoption of maize horticulture and the
need to exploit the highly fertile soils that occur
on the first and second terraces of the Red River
valley, as well as natural levees and point bars.
This settlement pattern focus intensified during the
Late Caddo period when virtually all of the villages
were located along the Red and Little River valleys,
with little or no occupation on tributary streams or
upland landforms away from the rivers. These
data are at variance with Burnett’s hypothesis, and
we suggest instead that a further intensification of
horticultural activity occurred at this time.
As Burnett (1990:395) noted, the incidence of
caries in human skeletal populations only indicates

an increase in carbohydrate consumption. To
adequately determine if maize was the cause of the
caries in dental remains, stable carbon isotope assays
are also needed, along with other bioarcheological
measures of fitness and stress that seem to correlate
with a maize agricultural subsistence system. We,
therefore, propose to undertake a stable carbon
isotope analysis of populations from different
sites in the Red River valley of Texas as part of
the TAS Field School analysis effort. We will
attempt to include stable carbon isotope analyses
of archeological samples possessing both spatial
variability (e.g., the Kaufman-Roden-Williams sites
versus the Hatchel-Mitchell-Moores sites, as well
as Caddo sites outside the Red River valley) and
temporal variation (e.g., Woodland, Early to Middle
Caddo, and Late Caddo) in the analysis, to test the
hypotheses of intensification of maize use over time
and whether there is a Piney Woods adaptation based
on a largely non-maize economic system.
Determine If the Caddo were processing
Salt near the Roitsch Site
There is good archeological evidence in the
Caddo archeological area that during the Late
Caddo period, Caddo groups in southwestern Arkansas and northwestern Louisiana were making
salt (Early 1993; Girard 2006; Gregory 1973). The
Caddo were apparently making salt for their basic
agricultural subsistence needs, and also as a prized
item for trade with other aboriginal agricultural
groups, and then later, with the Europeans.
There appear to have been several different
methods by which the Caddo made salt, but the
most common way was to collect water from a
salt spring in a ceramic container, then heat the
container over a large fire until the water evaporated, leaving the salt residue. The fires must have
been fairly hot and intensive, because at known salt
springs, the hearths exhibit extreme oxidation, and
there are very high quantities of discarded sherds
(either thick salt pans, as at the Hardman site [Early
1993] or the typical Caddo utility wares common
to the Late Caddo period in the Red River basin,
such as Nash Neck Banded jars).
The first challenge for this research problem
was to attempt to locate any Caddo salt-making
sites. We concentrated our survey and any testing
efforts along Salt Well Slough, a known location
for salt springs. We already knew of three sites
along Salt Well Slough that were candidates for

330

Texas Archeological Society

salt processing locales (see Figure 2), including the
Salt Well Slough site (see Kenmotsu 2001, 2006).
When feasible, we proposed to shovel test a range
of Late Caddo sites along the slough, as well as
gather controlled surface collections of diagnostic
artifacts, looking for evidence of large (5-10 m diameter) oxidized hearths, middens with extremely
high densities of utility wares, and evidence for
the use of thick, plain, shell-tempered salt pans
like those recovered on Caddo salt-making sites in
southwestern Arkansas (Early 1993). Should a site
fulfilling these criteria be located, and the Salt Well
Slough site (41RR204) was an excellent candidate
(cf. Kenmotsu 2001, 2006), we planned to sample
the archeological deposits in an attempt to better
understand the material content and functional
character of a salt-making Caddo site along the
Red River valley in Texas.
Examine Early Anglo-American Settlement
and Trade
The research problem concerning early AngloAmerican settlement and trade was to be addressed
if archeological deposits associated with the early
town of Jonesborough could be identified, or if
other early (pre-1850) archeological components
could be documented during the course of the TAS
Field Schools. First, although we knew a fair amount
about Jonesborough from the archival records
(Steely n.d.), in 1991-1992 we had little idea about
the nature of the archeological deposits that may
be preserved there. It had been suggested by some
that the site was largely washed away during a major flood earlier in the 20th century, and others had
indicated that there were only a few artifacts and a
foundation or two remaining to mark the site.
The first and foremost problem for the Jonesborough site area was to determine what was left
of the town site, if anything. If we could confidently identify the site through archeological
investigations—with special attention given to
identifying features (i.e., building foundations) that
would enable us to relate the archeological record
to a town plan that survives today in the historical
archives for the site—we wanted to look at the
types of trade and interaction the inhabitants of
Jonesborough had with surrounding groups, both
aboriginal and Anglo-American. To the north were
settlements of Choctaw Indians, and the Cherokee
village of Tahchee was a short distance to the west.
It is quite likely that some degree of trade by the

Jonesborough inhabitants took place with these
aboriginal peoples. Also, with Jonesborough being
an Anglo-American settlement, considerable trade
undoubtedly occurred with other Anglo-American
settlements to the east in Arkansas and down the
Red River to Louisiana.
The issues related to trade and interaction with
surrounding groups were to come from examination of the kinds and quantities of material goods
found at the site, as well as information contained
in archival and historical documents (see Reese
1998, 2001). These kinds of items would be informative about the type of goods coming into the
Texas frontier (actually the Arkansas frontier during the early occupation at the town). We would
then be able to assess the relative proportions,
and therefore the relative influence, of goods from
Arkansas versus Louisiana and consequently the
degree of interaction with each area.
Evidence of trade with the Choctaw or the
Cherokee may be reflected in the occurrence of Indian trade good items, such as glass beads and copper and brass ornaments, and native-made pottery
such as Chickachae Combed ceramics made by the
Choctaw. The reader should refer to Reese’s (2001)
monograph on the TAS archeological investigations
at the Jonesborough locale for more detailed information on the results of the work there.

THE ARCHEOLOGY OF THE EAST
MOUND AT THE ROITSCH SITE:
BLOCKS I, II, AND IX,
by Timothy K. Perttula, William A. Martin,
and James E. Bruseth
INTRODUCTION
In this section, we are concerned with summarizing the archeological investigations completed
by the Texas Archeological Society in 1991 and
1992 in the East Mound at the Roitsch site. This
work established that the East Mound was a deliberately-mounded construction, built in the 14th
century over earlier prehistoric Caddo habitation
deposits of the pre-A.D. 1300 Albion and Mound
Prairie phases in the local cultural sequence. We
also discuss the kinds of material culture remains
found in and around the East Mound.
R. King Harris (1953:43) had noted some 50
years ago that the “east mound… is probably only

Perttula—The Archeology of the Roitsch Site (41RR16) 331
a natural rise with about two feet of accumulated
midden material.” He also went on to say that there
was evidence of a burned Caddo house structure
in the mound, as there were “many large pieces
of burned clay daub… found over the surface.”
In the vicinity of the daub concentration, Harris
(1953:43) had collected 4-5 European glass trade
beads and 3-4 copper cones, either tinklers or awls/
rolled copper projectile points.
In 1968, Southern Methodist University
(SMU), with funding from the National Park Service, conducted about one month of field work at
the Sam Kaufman (now Roitsch) site) under the
direction of Dr. S. Alan Skinner (Skinner et al.
1969). The work was done because there was a
perceived threat to the site from flooding by the
Red River. The SMU excavations concentrated on
the two known mounds, and only limited work was
conducted away from the mounds (see Skinner et
al. 1969: Figure 3) in what were the prehistoric and
early historic Caddo habitation areas.
The East Mound (Figure 5) was constructed up
to a height of about 1 m and covered the remains
of a structure. At the death of a prominent adult
male in the late 15th or early 16th century (based
on radiocarbon dates from two burials in the shaft
tomb, see Appendix X, this article)—perhaps a
tribal leader in the McCurtain phase community
centered at the Roitsch site—a large pit measuring
4 m in diameter and over 1.8 m deep was excavated
down through the mound fill and through the floor
of this structure for use as a burial tomb (Skinner et
al. 1969). The remains of the deceased were placed
in the pit along with an adult female, who may have
been the principal wife, and nine other individuals,
probably retainers or slaves. Many artifacts were
also placed in the pit, including elaborately decorated ceramic vessels, finely made arrow points,
marine shell and turquoise beads traded from
other areas, and ground stone celts. The artifacts,
representing the wealth of the deceased leader, and
perhaps his lineage, were most likely used to provision himself and his entourage during their journey
to the land of the deceased.
1991 and 1992 Excavations
at the East Mound
Due to its very low height and the absence of
layers of burned structures like those found in the
West Mound (destroyed by 1990 flooding), Skinner
et al. (1969) concluded, as had Harris (1953) before

them, that the East Mound may be a natural feature,
resulting from flood deposits. Prior to the start of
the 1991 TAS Field School, we wished to evaluate
this conclusion, as it had significance in not only
determining if it in fact was an earthen mound built
by the Caddo, but also in characterizing the history
of use by the Late Caddo, McCurtain phase community at the Roitsch site. Using three long backhoe trenches, SMU’s old excavations were found
and two perpendicular continuous profiles were
exposed through the mound (Figures 6 and 7). In
addition, during the 1991 Field School, individual
1 x 1 m units were excavated at various points
around the mound to investigate the natural soil
layers and compare them with those observed on
the mound (see Figure 5). The results of this work
allowed us to identify definite layers of mound
fill and to convincingly demonstrate that the East
Mound was man-made and built up to about 1 m
in height.
All of the mound fill was removed from Block
I by the last day of the 1991 Field School. Block II
reached the base of the mound fill in the northern
half of the block, coming down on top of a thin lens
of charcoal in the southeastern part of the block
believed to be the remains of a burned structure,
probably related to the abandonment and destruction
of House 2 that had been uncovered by Skinner et
al. (1969) immediately below the East Mound fill
(see Figure 6). Excavation in the southern end of
Block II ceased at various levels in different units.
Both blocks were covered with a layer of plastic and
backfilled at the end of the 1991 Field School.
Because all of Block I was taken down to the
same level, just above the contact with the underlying black clay, we were able in 1992 to remove
all backfill by scraping the area with a bulldozer,
stopping just above this contact between mound fill
and the buried natural Redlake soil (see Thomas
1977:28). We scraped an area much larger than
Block I, in order to encompass the post holes observed in the backhoe trenches in 1991 (see Figure
6). The grid was reestablished over the scraped area
and excavation began again at this point. Because
Block II was deeper and more complex than Block
I in the kinds of mound fill it contained, the excavation units had stopped at various levels in 1991.
Prior to the start of the 1992 Field School, the back
dirt was removed from Block II and excavations
resumed where they had left off in 1991.
Most excavation occurred within two 4 x 8 m
block units (Blocks I and II) (Figure 8). These blocks

were positioned to avoid SMU’s earlier excavation
units (see Figure 6), and were intended to uncover
artifacts and features related to the construction of
the mound. In 1992, three 4 x 4 m units, called Block
IX, were also excavated not far to the south of the
East Mound (see Figure 5).
During both field seasons, a total of 42.5 m3 of
sediments were removed from the two main blocks
in the East Mound; the mound fill was completely
removed across both Block I and Block II. Another
4 m3 was excavated in Block IX in 1992. Due to the
heavy rains during the 1992 Field School, and the
very muddy conditions around the blocks and in the
bulldozer scrape area, excavations were difficult
to carry out and complete. This was particularly
the case for the shovel scraping and trowel work
intended to identify and define features and cultural
disturbances in the bulldozer scrape
area in and southeast of Block I (see
Figure 6).

reddish-brown sandy loam and
clay mottles, probably inclusions
from the dismantling and burning
of House 2 and the subsequent
excavation of the Burial 15 shaft
tomb (see Figure 6). The mound
fill is about 50 cm thick in Block
II. At its base, at least in parts of
Block II and in the area of Burial
15, is a ca. 5 cm thick lens of red
clay that marks the prepared clay
floor of House 2 (see zone 4 in
Figure 9). The floor of House 2
was placed on top of the natural
A-horizon of the Redlake soil, and
the A-horizon does not appear to
have been removed or artificially
leveled prior to the construction
of the clay house floor.
Underneath the mound fill, at least to a depth
of 125 cm bs, are the top three zones of the buried
Redlake soil (see Figure 9). Zone 5 is a 15 cm thick
reddish-brown A-horizon that is underlain by dark
reddish-brown B21 and B22 clays (zones 6 and 7).
Other than the mound fill, few cultural features
were documented in the East Mound excavations
(see Figure 6). In Blocks I and II, this included
five post holes, a large pit (Feature 101), and a
clay hearth (Feature 104) in Block I, and three
post holes and a burial (Feature 208, Burial 36)
in Block II (see Figure 6). One other post hole
(Feature 107) was identified in the bulldozer scrape
area southeast of Block I, and an extended burial
(Feature 204, Burial 35) and a charcoal concentration (Feature 203) were exposed on the north side
of Trench 2, about 2 m north of Block II. Other

(similar to those exposed by Skinner et al. [1969: Figures 5 and 7])

to Middle Caddo period occupations at the Roitsch site.

At the close of the 1991 Field
School, a large “bathtub”-shaped
pit feature (Feature 101) was uncovered as the last of the mound
fill was removed from level 4
along the eastern edge of Block I
(see Figure 6). This feature con7

dized from burning, that paralleled the pit outline

on the two long edges of the pit (however, it was
of the block, so the actual length of the feature was
not visible along the western edge). The red clay

About 5 cm into level 8, the same depth to
which the clay lining extended, a layer of ash was
observed (Figure 11). By the time this level was
completed, three large concentrations of charcoal
were also visible (see Figure 10). The ash and
charcoal concentrations were lying near the bottom of the pit along with baked clay. At least one
of the ash and charcoal concentrations was linear,
paralleling the long axis of the feature. In fact, the
wood grain of the charcoal also appeared to parallel
the orientation of the pit, suggesting that these were
the remains of logs that burned in place and were
subsequently backfilled. The previously mentioned
radiocarbon sample was taken from this charcoal
concentration.
The bottom of level 9 was beneath the feature
fill. The bottom of the pit was observed about 5 cm
into level 9, where the reddish-brown compacted
sand layer that is transitional between the A-horizon and the underlying red clay B-horizon began
to show up. The western half of the pit was taken
down beneath the feature matrix and a profile was
drawn and photographed of the bisected ash and
charcoal concentration. Once the pit fill was com-

pletely removed, two intrusive post holes (Features
102 and 103) were identified in the lighter-colored
soil beneath Feature 101 (see Figure 10).
The feature matrix contained a red-slipped
and everted rim sherd reminiscent of that from
an effigy vessel; it was found at the top of the pit,
along its western edge (see Figure 10). The sherd
appears to represent trash incorporated into the pit
fill, since no other related sherds from this vessel
were found in the pit fill. A total of 78 sherds were
recovered from Feature 101, as well as 167 pieces
of daub and burned clay, eight fire-cracked rocks,
and seven long-stemmed Red River pipe sherds
from at least two different pipes. Throughout the
excavation of the pit matrix, it was also apparent
that the density of lithic debris (n=183) inside the
feature was higher than what was recovered from
the portions of the 1 x 1 m units excavated outside
the feature; perhaps these represent sweepings
from a nearby knapping area. Flotation samples
were taken from the matrix at the bottom of the pit.
Analysis of floated materials indicated the presence
of wood charcoal, cane, and two charred seeds (see
Fritz, this article).

The fact that part of the feature extended
outside of Block I proved to be a very fortunate
circumstance because it allowed us to examine a
profile that provided critical information for dating
the mound construction. It is clear from examining the profile in Figure 11 that the pit penetrated
a layer of water-lain sand with siltation lenses that
was about 10 cm thick. This layer rested on top of
a 2 cm thick lens of charcoal and burned clay on
the northern side of the pit (see Figure 11), and this
lens in turn rested on the buried A-horizon of the
natural soil.
Identical siltation lenses were observed
in backhoe trench profiles where the trenches
bisected excavation units from the 1968 SMU
excavations. Heavy rains occurred during those
excavations, and sand was washed into the units.
The same phenomenon was observed in excavation
units during the TAS Field School after a rain. It
appears that some basket loads of sandy mound
fill had been dumped adjacent to Feature 101
during initial mound construction (which covered
the thin charcoal and baked clay lens, probably
from a burned and dismantled structure), then
a rain event washed some of the sand into low
spots nearby. Shortly thereafter, Feature 101 was
dug, a burning episode occurred, the feature was
backfilled, and then the remaining mound fill was
added that capped it. Given the fact that a date was

obtained from charcoal at the base of the feature,
and the feature appears to have been used while
initial mound construction was underway, we can
place the construction (with a 66% probability or
1 sigma age range) of the East Mound between cal
AD 1275-1383.
A basin-shaped hearth (Feature 104) was
exposed at ca. 55 cm bs in Block I (see Figure
6), under the mound fill. It was about 66 cm in
diameter, and extended to ca. 70 cm bs. The hearth
was filled with an ash lens that was 1-4 cm thick,
charcoal, and clumps of burned clay. One shelltempered Nash Neck Banded sherd was in the fill.
Underneath the hearth was a 21 cm diameter post
hole (Feature 108) with a flat bottom that reached
to 86 cm bs. This particular post hole almost certainly represents the hole where the central post of
a Caddo structure was removed after the structure
had been built (see Swanton 1942:150), and the
basin-shaped hearth was then constructed over the
filled-in post hole.
There were two McCurtain phase Caddo burials excavated in the East Mound during the TAS
Field School. The first is an extended burial of an
adult female (Burial 35) on the north side of Trench
2, and a 6-12 month old child burial (Burial 36) in
Block II. The adult (30-35 years old) Caddo female
burial was placed in a 197 cm long pit that was
oriented northeast-southwest and extended to 160

2005:55-59).
Artifacts from the East Mound
The ceramics from the East Mound investigations, as well as from many other parts of the
Roitsch site, are indicative of lengthy and repeated
occupations during much of the Caddo settlement
of the Mound Prairie area along the Red River.
The sherd sample from the three blocks includes
70 plain rims and 195 decorated sherds, 230 from
Blocks I and II and 35 from Block IX, along with
7599 plain body and base sherds (Table 2).
The density of sherds in the East Mound ranged
from 86-714 per m3, with the lowest densities in
Block I (86 sherds per m3) and the highest density
in Block IX, just south of the mound; the sherd
density in Block II is 150 per m3. The low density
of sherds is apparently restricted to the crest of the
mound (Blocks I and II), and the fact that the proportion of shell-tempered sherds is quite low (see
discussion below) there when compared to Block
IX, suggests that most of the sherds in the mound
fill on the East Mound crest became incorporated in
the fill from trash deposits produced during the Albion and Mound Prairie phase Caddo occupations
in the vicinity of the mound. The very high sherd
density in Block IX, and the correspondingly high
proportions of shell-tempered sherds (80 percent),
also suggests that the archeological deposits there
are the product of a discrete Late Caddo period
habitation near the southern mound slope.

Other than the ceramics from the 1991 Youth Area
excavations (see discussion below; see also Perttula
and Iruegas 2001), and Blocks V and VI (all of which
have relatively small samples of decorated sherds) in
widely separated parts of the village, only the collection from Blocks I and II has a predominance of grogtempered, grit-tempered (i.e., crushed rocks, including
sandstone and hematite), and bone-tempered sherds in
the ceramic assemblage. Shell-tempered sherds comprise only about 42 percent of the sherds from Blocks
I and II, compared to between 90-95 percent shelltempered sherds in Blocks III and IV as well more
than 97 percent of the sherds and vessels in the Terrace
area. Indeed, as mentioned above, the percentage of
shell-tempered sherds from Block IX, near the south
end of the East Mound (see Figure 5), is 80 percent.
Clearly the main focus of the Late Caddo, McCurtain
phase, settlement at Roitsch (with the exception of
burial interments) was along a ca. 200 m long stretch
across the alluvial terrace south of the East Mound, not
concentrated on the East Mound itself.
The grog-, grit-, and bone-tempered ceramics
are almost exclusively from the Middle Caddo
Mound Prairie phase occupation in and beneath
the mound. Several Coles Creek Incised sherds
(including one with incised lip lines) from Blocks
I and II also suggest occupation of the Roitsch site
during the latter part of the Woodland period, from
ca. A.D. 700-900 (cf. Story 1990b). Coles Creek
Incised ceramics have been previously noted in
low frequencies in the East Mound (see Skinner
et al. 1969), as well as at other large prehistoric
sites along the Red River, such as Rowland Clark,
Bob Williams, and Dan Holdeman (Bruseth 1998;
Perino 1983, 1994, 1995), and the Ray site (see
Bruseth et al. 2001).

The Middle Caddo Mound Prairie phase
ceramics from Blocks I and II include plain, redslipped bowl sherds (n=3) (cf. Sanders Plain), as
well as sherds from plain bowls, bottles, and jars
without slipping (n=27), and diagonal engraved
sherds from carinated bowls, some of which have
a red slip (cf. Sanders Engraved, see Krieger 2000;
Suhm and Jelks 1962). Grog, grit, and bone-tempered incised (n=37) and punctated (n=13) sherds
from utility vessels of Canton Incised are also
common in the Mound Prairie phase deposits.
The McCurtain phase ceramics from the East
Mound include shell-tempered sherds with a variety of engraved, punctated, punctated-incised,
appliqued, and neck banded decorations. Avery Engraved and Emory Punctated-Incised sherds are the
most frequent decorated sherds in the assemblage,
and Nash Neck Banded jar sherds are also present
in abundance; the latter, however, only represents
about 11 percent (n=13) of the rim and decorated
shell-tempered sherds from the East Mound compared to more than 21 percent from the Block III and
IV village areas. It has not been determined whether
this difference represents ceramic functional variability between the two areas of the site, or is instead
related to temporal differences in when the two
areas were occupied during the McCurtain phase.
Other engraved wares include Simms Engraved
and Hudson Engraved (see Suhm and Jelks 1962),
shell-tempered fine wares that were made and used
by the McCurtain phase Caddo between ca. A.D.
1500-1650, or even later.
The investigations by R. King Harris (1953)
and Skinner et al. (1969) in the East Mound disclosed continued Caddo use of the mound slopes
primarily for burial interments after about A.D.
1650, and the decorated shell-tempered ceramics from Blocks I and II reaffirm their findings.
Although not present in great quantities, as mentioned above, Hudson Engraved, Keno Trailed,
and Simms Engraved sherds, typical of the kinds
of decorated ceramics to be expected in post-A.D.
1650 archeological deposits along the middle Red
River (cf. Bruseth 1998; Perttula 1992), were found
from several different contexts across the mound.
Burial 35 is also indicative of the McCurtain
phase use of the East Mound. Grave goods with the
burial include a portion of a vertical-rimmed Avery
Engraved bowl and a Nash Neck Banded jar with a
peaked rim and strap handles (Figure 14). Based on
changes in the form and design of McCurtain phase
ceramics from the Rowland Clark site (cf. Perino

1994:28-29), Burial 35 may have been placed in
the mound during the earlier part of the phase; that
is, before A.D. 1450.
There are 27 ceramic pipe sherds in the East
Mound excavations: 16 from Block I, eight from
Block II, two from Backhoe Trench 2, and one
from Block IX south of the mound. Twenty-six of
the pipe sherds, tempered primarily with burned
bone, are from long-stemmed Red River pipes (see
Hoffman 1967), including nine bowl, 15 stem, and
two butt sherds. The one elbow pipe stem sherd,
made with shell temper, is from Block IX.
More than 4400 pieces of daub and burned clay
have been recovered in Blocks I, II, and IX. The
highest densities (170 per m3) occur in Block IX in
association with a McCurtain phase habitation area
that also has abundant ceramic sherds (see Table 2);
there must have been a clay-thatched Caddo structure
in this area. Proportionally, however, the amount of
daub and burned clay in the East Mound deposits to
ceramic sherds is 2.5 times less than in the McCurtain
phase Village areas at Roitsch.
Lithic debris (n=2953, including one core) and
chipped (n=36) and ground stone (n=6) tools, as
well as fire-cracked rocks (n=153), are relatively
abundant in the East Mound archeological deposits,
at least in comparison with the number of sherds and
pieces of daub/burned clay (see Table 2). The density
of lithic debris, tools, and fire-cracked rock ranges
from 46.6-90 artifacts per m3 in Blocks I, II, and IX,
with the highest density of chipped stone tools in
Block IX, and the highest densities of lithic debris
and fire-cracked rocks in the Block II excavations.

Perttula—The Archeology of the Roitsch Site (41RR16) 341
the occasional use of stones for boiling and cooking
of foodstuffs, appears to have been more prevalent
in pre-A.D. 1300 archeological contexts. Much of
the evidence was incorporated in the mound fill from
earlier Caddo habitation deposits on the terrace where
the East Mound was subsequently constructed in Late
Caddo, early McCurtain phase times.
The chipped stone tools in Blocks I, II, and IX,
as well as other contexts in the East Mound, are
dominated by stemmed and triangular arrow points
(n=14) (see Appendix IX, this article). There are
also drills and perforators (n=5), arrow point fragments (n=9), scrapers (n=5), expedient flake tools
(n=6) with minimal use wear, and small bifacial
tools or tool fragments (n=8). One dart point was
found in the Block I mound fill.
The stemmed arrow points and arrow point
fragments, including Formative to Middle Caddo
period Catahoula (Category VI, n=2), Alba (Category VIII, n=3), and Hayes (Category XIII, n=1)
styles (see Turner and Hester 1999) as well as
unifacially retouched specimens, are found in the
mound fill but are also present in the buried natural
soil under the mound. Two others are identified
as Category VII points (n=2), which have very
long and serrated blades, and are stemmed, but
the stem form itself is not identifiable because of
point breakage. The stemmed Catahoula, Hayes,
and Pocola types also commonly have very long
and serrated blades (see Brown 1996) like the
Category VII points at the Roitsch site, especially
the Hayes and Pocola types. Only 11 percent of the
stemmed arrow points are made from novaculite.
The remainder are manufactured from brown chert
(n=4 or 44 percent), brown jasper (n=1 or 11 percent), claystone-siltstone (n=1 or 11 percent), and
quartzite (n=2 or 22 percent). These materials were
available in Red River gravels and in Red River
alluvial terraces (see Banks 1990; Mallouf 1976).
There are five triangular style Late Caddo McCurtain phase arrow points from the East Mound
excavations. Two Maud points (Category II) were
found in the upper 30 cm of the mound fill in
Blocks I and IX, as was one Talco (Category I) in
Block I. A single Harrell point came from Block II
excavations, and a Washita point (Category V) was
recovered in the Burial 35 pit fill (see Appendix
IX, this article). The later style East Mound arrow
points have been manufactured from a variety of
locally available lithic raw materials, including novaculite, gray chert, brown chert, yellowish-brown
chert, claystone/siltstone, brownish-gray chert, Big

Fork chert, dark brown chert, and Ogallala quartzite. Eighty percent of the triangular arrow point
types were made from gray novaculite.
As we mentioned, there are eight bifaces or
bifacial fragments in the chipped lithic tools from
the East Mound excavations (see Appendix IX, this
volume). One brown chert bifacial fragment was in
the Burial 35 pit fill, but it was not placed on the
floor of the burial pit as a funerary offering, and is
likely an accidental inclusion in the burial pit fill
itself. The most significant bifacial tool came from
Block IX (N508 E490). It is a large (98.9 x 38.9
mm in length and width) beveled knife made from
Florence-A chert (otherwise known as Kay County
chert); this lithic raw material has its source in the
Flint Hills of southern Kansas and northern Oklahoma, centered in the Arkansas River basin (Banks
1990; Stein 2006). Another large biface of the same
material was recovered from the McCurtain phase
shaft tomb in the East Mound (see Skinner et al.
1969: Figure 27o), and Harris (1953: Plate 3, no.
15) found a similar large beveled knife in a McCurtain phase burial at the site from a cemetery
area northeast of the Roitsch site village.
The one dart point from the East Mound excavations is a Gary point made from Big Fork chert;
the blade had been resharpened into a bifacial
drill bit. The point is 6.4 mm thick, suggesting it
is a Gary, var. Camden, indicating some use of the
East Mound area in the latter part of the Woodland
period (cf. Schambach 1982, 1998).
The flake tools found in the East Mound excavations include several drills and perforators
(n=5), and they appear to be more common in
these deposits than they are in the Block III and IV
Late Caddo habitation areas. Formal retouched and
hafted scraping implements, including side scrapers, end scrapers, and thumbnail end scrapers, also
seem to be an important part of the tool kit in the
East Mound archeological deposits; 25 percent of
the chipped stone tools in Block IX, for instance,
are formal scraping tools, and 45 percent of all
the flake tools from the East Mound excavations
are scraping tools. This suggests the considerable
importance during some parts of the Caddo occupation, primarily the latter part of the McCurtain
phase, at the Roitsch site for the intensive processing of hunted resources, apparently deer (see Yates,
this article). The scraping tools are made primarily
from novaculite and Big Fork chert. The expedient
flake tools are made from several kinds of chert as
well as quartzite (see Appendix IX, this article).

There are differences in the use of lithic raw
materials for chipped stone tools between the three
excavation blocks on the East Mound. In the later
McCurtain phase deposits in Block IX, novaculite
and Big Fork chert from the Red River gravels
comprise 63 percent of the tools, while brown chert
and a yellowish-brown chert are more common in
Block I (60 percent); novaculite is absent in the
Blocks I and II tools. In Block II, Big Fork chert
and claystone/siltstone are the most abundant raw
materials used for tools. These differences between
the three blocks—particularly between Blocks I/
II and Block IX—suggest that there were changes
through time in the use of locally available raw
materials, and perhaps also in the sources that
were collected by the Caddo toolmakers for knappable stone. High-quality Red River gravel cherts
represent only 30 percent of the tools in Block I,
53 percent of the Block II tools, and 88 percent of
the tools in Block IX. Coarse-grained cherts and
quartzites, available either in Red River gravels or
gravels mantling uplands and alluvial terrace landforms, comprise 70 percent of the Block I tools,
and only 47 and 12 percent of the Block II and IX
tools, respectively.
The six ground stone tools from the East
Mound block investigations (two tools from Block
I and four from Block II) at the Roitsch site include
three manos or mano fragments and three grinding
slabs. Sixty-seven percent of the mano and grinding slab tools are made from a locally available
sandstone, with the remainder are manufactured
from a coarse-grained quartzite. Other contexts in
the East Mound had another grinding slab fragment
as well as a polished celt flake fragment made from
a Ouachita Mountains metamorphic material.
ARCHEOLOLGICAL
INVESTIGATIONS IN THE LATE
CADDO VILLAGE AREAS AT
THE ROITSCH SITE
by Timothy K. Perttula
Texas Archeological Society Field School
excavations in Blocks III and IV of the Roitsch site
explored primarily Late Caddo McCurtain phase,
archeological deposits in habitation areas on the
alluvial terrace, and the findings from that work are
the main focus of this section. However, a small
earlier Caddo occupation is also apparently present
(based on the recovery of temporally diagnostic

decorated sherds) in both block areas that perhaps
is contemporaneous with the Mound Prairie phase
Caddo archeological deposits that have been
radiocarbon dated at cal AD 1154-1296 (1 sigma)
in Block VI (see below) or in House 3 by the East
Mound (with four calibrated dates that range at 1
sigma between AD 982-1250, see Perttula 1998:
Table 1). These Late Caddo remains in Blocks III
and IV consisted of an extensive and dense midden
deposit built up around and in a number of house
structures and outdoor features, and the deposits
contain large amounts of sherds from broken and
discarded pottery vessels and daub/burned clay
from plastering structure walls with mud, lining
hearths with clay, and the outdoor firing of hearths
and pits.
The Block III and IV excavations were located
about 100-200 m south of the East Mound (see
Figure 5), and near the crest of the alluvial terrace
(Figures 15 and 16). The two blocks were approximately 60-70 m apart. In Block III, hand excavations
were conducted during both the 1991 and 1992 TAS
Field Schools, with a total of 33 m2 carried down to
50 cm bs (Figure 17a-b), while 24.25 m2 were excavated as three separate 1 x 8 m trenches in Block IV
during the 1991 field season. In 1992, two narrow
trenches (Scrape 1 and 2) were machine-scraped to
remove the plow zone on either side of Block III in
an attempt to locate cultural features, including post
hole patterns from Caddo structures (see Figure 15);
these trenches were approximately 2-2.5 m in width
and 20 m in length.
The Block III archeological deposits consisted
of a ca. 18 cm thick plow zone overlying a midden
area with an abundance of daub and burned clay
near the top of the midden (ca. 22-25 cm bs) (see
Figure 17b). The midden also contained quantities of
ceramics and animal bone. Underlying these zones
was a dense red B-horizon clay encountered at about
50 cm bs.
A number of cultural features and possible features were exposed in Block III and the two scraped
areas east and west of the trench (Figure 18). Of the
features that were identified, profiled, and excavated,
there were 22 post holes, two possible post holes,
two hearths (Features 310 and 323), a small daubfilled pit (Feature 317), an animal bone concentration (Feature 356), and a dog burial (Feature 346).
Two of the post holes (Features 302 and 304) were
overlain by sherd/vessel concentrations at 25-28 cm
bs, with the underlying post holes extending to about
53 cm bs.

with wall support posts. They were

were anchored by digging the holes
solidly into the B-horizon clay.
The occurrence of most of the
post holes in Block IV in proximity to the basin hearth (probably
a central hearth) suggests that a
portion of a Late Caddo McCurtain phase structure was present
in the northern part of the block
(see Figure 20). The posts and

is quite low by comparison with the ceramic assemblages found among contemporaneous Caddo
groups living to the south in the Pineywoods and
Post Oak Savanna of Northeast Texas (Perttula
2004; Perttula et al. 1995), and downstream along
the Red River, but consistent with ceramic assemblages from the Fasken and Salt Well Slough sites
in the Mound Prairie area (Kenmotsu 2001, 2006;
Prikryl 2001, this volume). Unlike contemporaneous Late Caddo groups in northwestern Louisiana
and eastern Texas that made ceramics where
large portions of vessel surfaces were decorated
(particularly with the introduction of brushing
on the bodies of utility jars), and the proportion
of decorated sherds may be as much as 50-60
percent of the sherds (with plain: decorated sherd
ratios of less than 1.0), McCurtain phase ceramics
are clearly from a different Late Caddo ceramic
stylistic tradition. At the Roitsch site, the ceramic
tradition comprised one with predominantly plain
vessels and large rim-decorated vessels with plain
and expansive bodies.
About 90 percent of the rim and decorated
sherds have shell tempering, and the other 10
percent of the sherds are tempered with grog, or
combinations of grog, bone, and grit (crushed rock
and pebbles) (Table 7). Most of the latter sherds
were found in Block III.
The relative frequency of shell-tempered
ceramics in these habitation areas is, of course,
completely consistent with a Late Caddo McCurtain phase occupation on this part of the Roitsch
site. The non-shell-tempered ceramics, with a few
exceptions (i.e., at least one Keno Trailed bottle
sherd with finely crushed grog tempering), denote

the prehistoric Caddo use of the area to some extent
prior to ca. A.D. 1300, after which the use of shell
tempering began to completely dominate Caddo
ceramic assemblages along the middle Red River.
The McCurtain phase occupation was clearly the
most intensive Caddo settlement of this part of the
Roitsch village.
The earlier Caddo decorated ceramics from
Blocks III and IV principally include diagonal and
horizontal incised motifs, along with punctated and
punctated-incised decorations on the vessel rim; the
latter have zones of punctations delimited by broad
incised lines, and may be from Canton Incised or
Pennington Punctated-Incised bowls and jars (Figure
22). Among the utility wares, incised sherds comprise
44 percent of the decorated sherds from the earlier
Caddo component here (see Table 7), followed
by punctated (11 percent), punctated-incised (7.9
percent), and appliqued (9 percent). Among the fine
wares, engraved sherds (n=21) are comprised of
fine-line horizontal and diagonal decorative elements
along the rim of carinated bowls, and along the neck
and bodies of bottles, as with Sanders Engraved and
Hickory Engraved types.
There are four non-shell-tempered red-slipped
sherds in the Block III and IV assemblage (see Table
7 and Figure 22, far right, 2nd and 3rd rows). Three
are from plain red-slipped bowls or carinated bowls
(cf. Sanders Plain, see Brown 1996), and the fourth
is a red-slipped and punctated bottle sherd, probably
from a Maxey Noded Redware bottle. Both types
of red-slipped ceramics are present in other Mound
Prairie phase contexts at the Roitsch site.
Another ceramic form present among the earlier
Caddo ceramic assemblage from Blocks III and

IV is the thick-walled, flowerpot-shaped Williams
Plain vessel; at least three basal sections of such
vessels were recovered in our investigations here.
Williams Plain vessels were first manufactured during the Woodland period in Northeast Texas (e.g.,
Schambach 1982, 1998; Bruseth 1998), but they
apparently also continued to be produced into the
earlier part of the Caddo occupation of the region.
The Late Caddo McCurtain phase ceramic assemblage from Blocks III and IV is dominated by
Nash Neck Banded jar sherds (approximately 39
percent of the shell-tempered decorated sherds).
Almost 30 percent of the 254 shell-tempered rim

sherds from this part of the site are from Nash
Neck Banded jars (see Table 7). The neck banding
was confined to several corrugated bands along the
rim of large rounded to globular jars (Figure 23).
In addition, most of the incised/appliqued (n=15),
noded (n=14), and punctated/noded (n=7) sherds
(and probably many of the vertical incised lines
or dashed decorations, and many of the appliqued
ridges and fillets, on body sherds) are from Caddo
potters decorating the bodies of Nash Neck Banded
jars with vertical incised lines and/or appliqued
triangles and chevrons (Figure 24). The nodes and
the punctated/noded sherds are probably from rim

nodes placed in sets of four around the rim (see
Perino 1994:Figure 7a, c-e). Based on the Caddo
vessel data from the contemporaneous Rowland
Clark and Holdeman sites a few miles downstream
from Roitsch (e.g., Perino 1994, 1995), this type of
rim decoration on Nash Neck Banded vessels was
used throughout the McCurtain phase.
Emory Punctated-Incised appears to also be
well represented in the collection from the two
blocks, as shell-tempered incised and punctated

sherds account for about 21 percent of the decorated
and rim sherds (Figure 25; see Table 7). The Emory
Punctated-Incised sherds are from relatively squat
jars with everted rims. Most of the incised and
punctated sherds seem to be from Emory PunctatedIncised vessels with body decorations of rows of
horizontal punctations, diagonal incised lines, and/
or incised lines between vertical appliqued ridges,
although some of the vessels simply have a few rows
of horizontal punctations on the rim. That particular

form of the Emory Punctated-Incised jar seems most
common during the later part of the McCurtain

combinations are the same as what Perino (1981:33)
called the “Early Emory Punctated.”

this residential area are from fine wares, but including only 8 percent of the rim sherds (see Table 7).
Some of the scroll and circle motifs on engraved
bowls resemble decorative elements seen on Clark
Engraved bowls from the Rowland Clark site (see
Perino 1994:Figures 13 and 14). These types of
engraved bowls were common at Rowland Clark
in the earlier part of the McCurtain phase (ca. A.D.
1300-1450). Many of the engraved sherds (particularly from Avery Engraved carinated bowls, deep

bowls, and bottles) are from vessels that were also
red-slipped; almost 43 percent of the engraved
sherds from these two blocks are from red-slipped
vessels (see Table 7).
Noticeably absent from the ceramics in Blocks
III and IV is Hudson Engraved, a consistent marker
for a very late (ca. A.D. 1650+) McCurtain phase
occupation in the Middle Red River area. However,
there are a few (n=5) shell-tempered Keno Trailed
bottle sherds (Figure 27) from the village areas, hint-

ing at a limited late 17th to early 18th century Caddo
domestic use of this part of the Roitsch village.
Other fine wares are red-slipped bowls and
carinated bowls that were otherwise undecorated.
About 1.5 percent of the decorated shell-tempered
sherds are red-slipped, including nine rims (see
Table 7). These are from Clement Redware (cf.
Flynn 1976) vessels, although Perino (1981) labels
similar plain red-slipped shell-tempered vessels
from the Roden site as Roden Ware.
Pipe sherds were abundant in Blocks III (n=28)
and IV (n=8), particularly in two small clusters south
and east of Feature 310 in Block III, the probable
central hearth to a Late Caddo McCurtain phase structure. Three of the sherds are from the bowls of elbow
pipes, and the remainder are from the long-stemmed
Red River style clay pipes (cf. Hoffman 1967); the
latter apparently continued to be made until ca. A.D.
1450, before they were completely replaced by the
elbow pipe. Among the Red River pipe sherds from
these blocks are 26 stems, two stem/bowl base sherds,
two bowl sherds, and three sherd from the butt end of
variety Haley Red River pipes.
While the types of shell-tempered ceramics
and pipe sherds present in Blocks III and IV
indicate Caddo domestic use of this area between
approximately A.D. 1300-1650, our general
impression based on particular decorative styles
and comparisons with other excavated Late Caddo
period sites along this part of the Red River valley
is that this area was primarily occupied before
about A.D. 1450, with only a limited use in the 17th
century. As such, the occupation here is earlier in the
McCurtain phase than the component in the Block I,
Block II, or Terrace areas at Roitsch. Further stylistic
and decorative element analyses of McCurtain phase
ceramics from contemporaneous habitation sites (as
well as from mortuary contexts), in conjunction with
additional radiocarbon dates from McCurtain phase
occupations along the middle reaches of the Red
River, should help refine the chronological position
of these deposits based on stylistic changes in fine
ware and utility ware decorations.
Block III tools are dominated by arrow points,
arrow point preforms, and arrow point fragments
(n=11), as they comprise 57 percent of the chipped
and ground stone tools (see Tables 4-6); in Block
IV, arrow points account for 47 percent of the stone
tools. The arrow points in Block III were recovered
from the southern half of the probable structure
area delimited by the Feature 310 hearth, the daub/
burned clay concentrations, and the Block III post

holes (see Figure 18). Clearly the hunting of game
animals using stone-tipped arrow points, probably
large game animals such as deer (see Yates, this
article), was a significant activity during the McCurtain phase occupation at the Roitsch site.
The dominant Late Caddo arrow point forms
in Blocks III and IV, and nearby excavations (i.e.,
50 x 50 cm units and Scrape Area 2 by Block III)
are triangular forms, including Maud (n=19, Class
II), Talco (n=1, Class I), Washita (n=1, Class V)
and Harrell (n=1, Class III) types (Figure 28a-b
and Figure 29, top row). The Maud points have
short blades and shallow basal concavities, and
tend to be made from novaculite and Big Fork
chert. The blades on the Maud points are commonly serrated, but not to the same degree as
Class I Talco arrow points. The one Talco point
from Block III is made from quartzite. These
points have long and well-serrated blades and a
shallow basal concavity. The Harrell and Washita
points are made from local raw materials of lesser
knapping quality than the Maud points, namely
quartzite and claystone-siltstone. Harrell points
are triangular in shape, with a short blade, shallow
side notching, and a deep basal concavity. Washita
points, by contrast, have a short and concave stem,
but are also side-notched (see Figure 29, top row).
The proportion of triangular to stemmed arrow
points in Block III is 19 to 7 (2.7:1) compared to
3 to 4 (0.75:1) in Block IV, with a much higher
proportion of triangular-shaped and unstemmed
arrow points in Block III. Since the unstemmed
triangular-shaped arrow points tend to date to the
Late Caddo period (after ca. A.D. 1300), later than
the stemmed arrow point forms, it seems obvious
that there was a more substantial and long-lasting
Late Caddo occupation in Block III than in Block
IV, at least with respect to the manufacture, use,
and discard of chipped stone arrow points.
There are nine ovoid to triangular arrow point
preforms in the Block III and IV excavations (see
Figure 28b, 2nd row, 2nd and 3rd from left), and all
of them are from Block III. Arrow point knapping
activities were clearly concentrated in Block III
during the McCurtain phase residential occupation.
The preferred raw material in arrow point manufacture must have been novaculite, as 55 percent of
the preforms were on this raw material. Other lithic
raw materials represented among the preforms are
Big Fork chert (n=2), a reddish-brown chert (n=1),
and a brown chert (n=1).
Among the stemmed forms, most of which are

a broad blade and wide, expanding barbs. The one Morris point
(Class IX), in Block III, is cornernotched, with a short blade and a

Block III. These points, probably
in use during the earlier part of
the McCurtain phase (cf. Brown
1996), have an expanding stem
and are corner-notched, and the
stem is short with a flat base. The
blades on Massard points also
tend to be relatively short.
There are three Hayes points

implements and four expedient flake tools (a ratio
of 2.75:1), while in Block IV there is only a single
end scraper and two expedient flake tools. The
drills and perforators are primarily found in Block
III (n=4), and only one Big Fork chert perforator
came from Block IV. The Block III drills/perforators are made from novaculite (n=3) and Big Fork

chert (n=1).
Among the bifaces, all from Block III (n=7) or
in 50 x 50 cm units near Block III (n=2), there are
four bifacially-worked pieces from completed tools
that may be knifes, and one (from N463 E493) has
a beveled blade. The bifaces are made from Big
Fork chert (n=2), novaculite (n=2), quartzite (n=1),

dark gray chert (n=3), and a brown chert (n=1).
As mentioned above, only a single dart point
was found in the Block III or IV excavations. The
one point is a Kent type, dating from the Woodland
period and often found in association with Gary
points, made from a dark gray chert. There are two
cores in the Block III archeological deposits: a single
platform core made from a brownish-red chert and a
tested cobble made from the same chert material.
Among the few ground stone tools in Block III
(see Table 6) are fragments of three green siliceous
shale celts (three from surface contexts) (Figure 32)
and a mano fragment of sandstone. These tools occur
both north and south of the Feature 310 hearth. In
addition to the relatively abundant lithic debris (93
pieces per m2), other evidence for the manufacture
and maintenance of lithic tools in Block III include
the two cores, the arrow point preforms, and several
broken and discarded biface fragments.
Including two cores, 19 chipped and ground
stone tools were found in the Block IV excavations
(see Table 6). This includes a variety of arrow points
(both stemmed and unstemmed triangular forms,
with the Maud point being the most common type),
along with four arrow point tips and blades. There
are also three flake tools, a perforator, and several
ground stone tools, including three hammerstones,

Block V/Trench I
The Block V or Trench I excavations in 1991
and 1992 took place along the south side of the Red
River alluvial terrace, some 400 m southwest of the
East Mound and 120 m south of the current bank
of the Red River (see Figure 5). They were placed
about 20 m west of a phone pole, 20-40 m south of
a terrace knoll, in an area where a Historic Caddo
period burial (probably dating to the late 17th-early
18th century) with glass beads was reportedly
found some years previously (Figure 33).
A total of 24 m2 were excavated during the
Field School in this area, 14 m2 in a 2 x 7 m trench
and the other 10 m2 in a 2 x 5 m trench (Figures
34 and 35). The archeological deposits were confined to a shallow plow zone and reddish-brown
Redlake sandy loam A-horizon (approximately 30
cm in total thickness) overlying a B-horizon clay.
No midden deposits were present in the Block V
archeological deposits. During the excavations,
seven post holes and two possible post holes
(Features 510 and 511) were identified, but (due

at least in part to the limited excavations) they
formed no obvious pattern; two of the post holes
contained small amounts of archeological materials. The diameter of the various post holes (ca. 20
cm in diameter) suggests they are wall posts, not
interior support or center posts. Nevertheless, they
do constitute evidence, along with the substantial
amount of daub and burned clay recovered in the
excavations (n=6459), that a clay and thatched
Caddo structure(s) stood in the area. We may
speculate that the concentrations of daub, animal
bone (n=69) and ceramics in the northwestern part
of Block V/Trench 1 represent floor debris from the
interior of the postulated structure.
In addition to the daub/burned clay and animal
bone recovered in the excavations, a small amount
of ceramic sherds (n=699), lithic debris (n=197),
and stone tools (n=4) were also present in the area
(Table 8; see also Table 4). These material remains
appear to comprise household trash discarded in
and around a single Caddo structure during the
course of its residential use. Other than daub/
burned clay, the very low density of Caddo artifactual debris from Block V/Trench I—namely 9 to 30

times lower in artifact density than either Blocks
III and IV in the heart of the site (see Tables 3 and
4) during the McCurtain phase occupation—clearly
suggests that this part of the Roitsch site was utilized for only a limited time, perhaps less than 5-10
years in toto.
The small lithic tool assemblage is represented
by four arrow points and a quartzite mano. With
the exception of a single arrow point blade fragment from N107 E104, the remainder of the stone
tools were found within the interior of the possible
Block V/Trench I structure. The unbroken mano
was recovered in Feature 502 (see Table 8).
Two of the four Block V arrow points are
broken Maud points (Class II forms) made from
gray novaculite or Big Fork chert. These points
are triangular-shaped, with short blades, and shallow basal concavities. They are also very common in
Blocks III and IV. Another is a red jasper stemmed
arrow point fragment with a long, serrated blade, possibly from a Catahoula, Hayes, or Pocola point, but
not enough of the stem remains on the point to make
a definitive typological identification. The last arrow
point is a Big Fork chert tip from N106 E104.
The Block V/Trench I ceramics (n=699) are
uniformly small in size, and the decorative elements/motifs on the 17 decorated sherds are difficult to discern. A single plain grog-tempered
rim sherd was also found in the Block V/Trench I
investigations. A mixture of shell- and non-shelltempered ceramics were recovered from this block,
with the non-shell-tempered sherds (primarily
tempered with grog) representing 44 percent of the
small rim/decorated sherd assemblage.
The non-shell tempered sherds (n=7) are
primarily decorated on the body and rim with
broad incised lines and/or punctations, although
one small incised sherd of indeterminate design
is also present in the Block V/Trench I collection,
along with a cross-hatched incised piece and one
with an exterior red slip. While the sample of nonshell-tempered sherds is very small, the relative
frequency of incised and zoned punctated sherds
is consistent with a ceramic assemblage that dates
relatively early in the prehistoric Caddo settlement
of the Roitsch site (i.e., prior to ca. A.D. 1300).
The shell-tempered decorated sherds (n=10), on
the other hand, include Nash Neck Banded decorations (n=1), horizontal punctations (n=3) from
Emory Punctated-Incised jars, three broad incised
or trailed sherd from Keno Trailed bottles, and
two engraved sherds, one of which may be from

a distinctively shaped and short-rimmed Simms
Engraved shouldered bowl and the other is from
an Avery Engraved vessel.
The ceramics from the Block V/Trench I investigations do not clearly support the suggestion
(Bruseth et al. 1992) that this area has any sort
of substantial Historic Caddo period occupation,
although the shell-tempered sherds from Keno
Trailed bottles may be indicative of a limited midto late 17th century use by Caddo peoples (cf.
Bruseth 1998:62). Other ceramic information that
argues against a single component Historic Caddo
period occupation, or even an occupation primarily limited to the Late Caddo McCurtain phase,
however, is the relatively low frequency of shelltempered sherds (56 percent) in the small ceramic
assemblage compared to other parts of the Roitsch
site village. Ceramic evidence from other areas at
Roitsch (particularly Blocks III/IV and the terrace
area), as well as other nearby Caddo village sites
(such as Rowland Clark, Roden, Holdeman, and
Bob Williams [Perino 1981, 1983, 1994, 1995],
is conclusive that shell-tempered ceramics fully
dominate the ceramics made and used by the Caddo
on sites dating after ca. A.D. 1300 in this part of
the Red River valley. Thus, the Block V/Trench I
ceramics suggest at least two occupations on this
part of the site, one during the earlier part of the
prehistoric Caddo sequence at Roitsch (perhaps
broadly contemporaneous with the Mound Prairie
phase occupation in Blocks I/II), and the other at
the latter end of the McCurtain phase, dating ca.
A.D. 1650-1700 (e.g., Perino 1994:28).

EXCAVATIONS IN A LATE
MCCURTAIN PHASE CEMETERY:
TERRACE AREA (BLOCK VII)
by Timothy K. Perttula
In addition to archeological investigations in
various Late Caddo habitation areas at the Roitsch
site, part of the Texas Archeological Society (TAS)
Field School work in 1991 took place in an associated cemetery area on the eastern edge of the alluvial terrace (Figure 36a-b). The terrace area (see
Figure 5) contained a looted and disturbed Late
Caddo McCurtain phase cemetery, including two
separate areas where several domesticated dogs
were also interred (see Yates, this article). The
terrace area was heavily eroded, and 10 clusters

of human remains were visible on the disturbed
surface east of the more intact burials farther up the
terrace slope (Human Bone Concentrations 1-10
on Figure 37); the surface exposed human remains
and the burials covered an area approximately 25 x
25 m in size. The area also contained a light scatter of Late Caddo period occupational debris that
probably has been eroded from the terrace edge and

the village settlement investigated in Block III/IV
as well as from a small knoll about 40 m south of
the cemetery area (see Figure 5). Eleven burials
(Burials 24-34) were excavated by the TAS in the
terrace area.
The burials that were exposed and excavated
during the course of the TAS Field School investigations were all apparently previously eroded,

disturbed, and/or disarticulated as a result of 1990
flooding, pot hunting and grave looting, as well as
landowner farming and grading activities. Nevertheless, significant bioarcheological information
was obtained on the age, sex, health, and diet of
these Late Caddo McCurtain phase individuals
(see Derrick et al., below), as well as a modicum
of archeological information on the kinds of grave
goods placed with these people at the time of their
death. The vast majority of the grave goods, however, had already been previously removed by the
grave looters.

Burial 24
About half of this extended burial, an adult
Caddo male, had been previously removed by erosion (Figure 38), and the remainder was exposed
along an active erosional gully. The head was at
the eastern end of the burial pit, and it faced almost
due west. There were a number of shell-tempered
pottery sherds (n=59) scattered through the burial
pit fill, from Avery Engraved, Hudson Engraved,
and Emory Punctated-Incised vessels, and portions
of one Nash Neck Banded vessel (including five

Perttula—The Archeology of the Roitsch Site (41RR16) 365

rim sherds) was found roughly in place by the right
knee (see Figure 38).
Other artifacts recovered from the burial pit
fill, but not apparently directly associated funerary objects, are a few pieces of daub and an arrow
point preform. A single marine shell disk bead (9
mm in diameter) was also found in the burial fill,
and may have adorned the body of the deceased
adult Caddo male when the body was placed in
the burial pit.
Burial 25
This burial, an old adult (40-55 years of age) of
undetermined sex, had been thoroughly disturbed
by erosion and looting activities. The bones were
scattered through the burial pit itself, which was
about 100 cm in width. The western half of the
burial pit had been destroyed by erosion. The only
articulated human remains in the pit were several
vertebrae from the vertebral column.
There were no obvious funerary objects remaining in the burial pit, although there were a few shelltempered pottery sherds (n=41). Among the sherds

were a bottle sherd from a Hudson Engraved vessel,
three Emory Punctated-Incised rim sherds from a
cooking jar, nine Nash Neck Banded jar sherds,
and eight Avery Engraved sherds from two different
vessels; one had a red slip on both vessel surfaces,
while the other was a black polished bottle fragment.
A small jasper core was also in the burial fill.
Burial 26
The northeastern part of Burial 26 had been
disturbed by erosion and looting, as was the lower
leg area (Figure 39). The burial pit is approximately
180 cm in length and 90 cm in width. Bioarcheological analysis of the recovered human remains
indicates that thus burial included two individuals,
an adult female, and a 1-2 year-old child. The adult
female was laid out on her back, with her head at
the eastern end of the burial pit (see Figure 39). The
exact location of the child within the burial pit is
not known because of the admixture of bones from
earlier erosion and looting.
There were no funerary objects left in the
burial pit. Among the artifacts in the burial pit fill

366

Texas Archeological Society

were apparently pieces of daub by the right knee,
two unmodified rocks under the hip area, and several shell-tempered pottery sherds (n=25). These
were from utility wares (Emory Punctated-Incised
and Nash Neck Banded jars) as well as fine wares
(a black polished Simms Engraved bowl), among
them a Keno Trailed body sherd.
Burial 27
This disturbed burial contained the jumbled
remains of two individuals, one that of a young
adult female Caddo (and the more intact of the
two individuals) and the other a 10-14 year old of
unknown sex. There was no obvious burial pit.
During the excavations, the crushed remnants
of a shell-tempered Hudson Engraved bowl (Vessel
1) was recovered by the right leg of the young adult
female. Additionally, there were 29 shell-tempered
sherds recovered in the excavations of Burial 27,
including sherds from Emory Punctated-Incised
and Nash Neck Banded jars as well as a Keno
Trailed bottle. Two marine shell beads and a large
columella bead were found in the excavated matrix

directly underneath the bones, and these were
likely ornaments that accompanied either one or
both of the deceased individuals. A chert core was
also found in the exposure of Burial 27.
Burial 28
This burial was exposed in an erosional gully,
and the eastern half of the burial had been disturbed
by looting activities. The burial pit itself could
not be readily discerned during the excavations.
Bioarcheological analysis of the recovered human
remains indicate that the commingled remains represent parts of four different individuals, including
three adults of unknown sex and one young child
(see Derrick et al., this article).
Parts of five different ceramic vessels were
noted in apparent association with at least one
of the individuals in Burial 28. The vessels were
placed either near the foot of the grave or along
the right side of the body, fairly close to the head.
The five vessel sections include a Taylor Engraved
deep bowl (Vessel 1), an Emory Punctated-Incised
jar (Vessel 2), two Nash Neck Banded jars (Vessels

Perttula—The Archeology of the Roitsch Site (41RR16) 367
3 and 4), and a Hudson Engraved vessel (Vessel 5).
There were also 116 miscellaneous shell-tempered
sherds found in the Burial 28 investigations, among
them 16 red-slipped sherds (either the plain portions of Avery Engraved vessels, or from plain
red-slipped Clement redware [Flynn 1976]), 21
Nash Neck Banded sherds, four Emory PunctatedIncised sherds, eight Avery Engraved sherds, and
one Keno Trailed sherd.
One large columella bead was found resting on
the vertebral column. The bead may have been worn
as a necklace by one of the adults placed in the burial
pit. There were also a few animal bones and mussel
shell fragments found in the vicinity of Burial 28.
Burial 29
This burial is that of a very young child, perhaps only two months old at the time of death (see
Derrick et al., this article). It appears to have been
recently exposed through erosion, and was marked
by a 40 cm diameter cluster of human remains on the
surface near Feature 704 (see Figure 37). There were
no associated funerary objects with Burial 29.

Figure 40. Burial 30 plan.

Burial 30
Burial 30 is a young adult (17-23 years old)
male placed on its back in the burial pit (Figure 40).
The head was at the eastern end of the burial pit,
and faced almost due west; the male’s arms rested
at his sides. There was a looter’s pit near the head
and covering the upper part of the body, and this
looting probably removed most of the associated
funerary objects (i.e., ceramic vessels), but it was
relatively intact compared to most of the Caddo
burials documented in the terrace cemetery.
Found associated with the young male was a
clay elbow pipe by his right hand (see Figure 40),
and a modified bone tool under his lower left arm.
One of the two Talco arrow points in the burial pit
was found placed near his feet. Among the ceramics found in the burial pit fill were 33 sherds from a
single Keno Trailed vessel (Vessel 1) and 104 other
shell-tempered sherds. These included a small
number of sherds from Emory Punctated-Incised
and Nash Neck Banded vessel fragments and four
red-slipped shell-tempered sherds.
There were also a number of drilled animal ribs
around the right and left elbow areas (see Figure 40),

368

Texas Archeological Society

suggesting this individual may have been wearing
some sort of a cloak with attached animal rib ornaments. A small patch of red ochre powder was also
noted in the left elbow area. Finally, there was a
large mussel shell that had been placed in the upper
body area (perhaps to hold pigments), along with a
piece of freshwater mussel shell under the skull.
Burial 31
This is the burial of a female who was in her
early to late 30s when she died. She was laid out
in an extended position, like the other burials in
the terrace cemetery, with her head at the eastern
end of the grave, and facing west-southwest (Figure 41). The burial had been disturbed by erosion,
particularly on the left side of the body, as well as
around both feet.
One of the most notable features of this burial
was the apparent marine shell headdress that was
documented during the excavations. Approximately 35 marine shell beads or bead fragments
were found around and along the head (see Figure
41), and most of them were still aligned or attached

Figure 41. Burial 31 plan.

together, apparently marking where the beads had
been sewn onto a headdress that has long since
decayed away. One blue glass bead was also recovered in the pelvic area. Its recovery clearly
indicates that Burial 31 was interred sometime after
about A.D. 1690, when we may expect European
trade goods to have been available in limited quantities to Red River Caddo peoples from French and
Spanish trade sources.
There were a wide variety of shell-tempered
sherds (n=258) in the Burial 31 fill, including sections of two different engraved vessels (Avery Engraved and Hudson Engraved). Decorated sherds
include several from different Emory PunctatedIncised, Nash Neck Banded, Avery Engraved,
Hudson Engraved, and Simms Engraved vessels.
Burial 32
Most of this burial had been badly disturbed
by erosion, and the majority of the human remains
themselves have been displaced. The placement of
the left and right humerus suggest that the burial,
that of a 45-49 year old female, was in an extended

Perttula—The Archeology of the Roitsch Site (41RR16) 369

Figure 42. Burial 33 plan.

position, with the head facing to the west. A mass
of pottery sherds to the right side of the head area
may represent part of a broken shell-tempered
Emory Punctated-Incised vessel (Vessel section 1)
placed with the female in the burial pit.
More than 70 other shell-tempered sherds
(most of which are undecorated) were found in the
burial pit, as was an expanding stem arrow point
made of white novaculite. The shell-tempered
pottery is from Hudson Engraved and Nash Neck
Banded types.

Associated funerary objects include a clay
elbow pipe by the left hand of the adult male
and a quiver of arrow points about 60 cm south
of the left arm (see Figure 42). Two other arrow
points—perhaps dislodged from the quiver—were
documented near both the left and right legs (see
Figure 42). Over 135 shell-tempered sherds came
from the burial pit fill, most of them plain body
sherds. The few decorated sherds include six Nash
Neck Banded, three Emory Punctated-Incised, and
three Avery Engraved vessel sherds, along with 13
red-slipped shell-tempered sherds.

Burial 33
This adult male (25-35 years of age at death)
had been disturbed by looters, particularly around
the head area (Figure 42), but otherwise it appeared
to be mostly intact. The body was oriented northeastsouthwest in the burial pit, with the head at the eastern
end of the pit and the feet at the western end of the
burial. The looter disturbances moved what was left
of the skull approximately 30 cm above and 70 cm
to the south of the original location (see Figure 42).

Burial 34
This is a very badly disturbed burial in the
southern part of the terrace cemetery (see Figure
37). Included with the burial are the remains of an
adult male, late 40s to mid-50s in age, and a 3-9
month old child (see Derrick et al., this article).
None of the human remains in this burial pit area
appear to be in situ, and all had been jumbled by
looting activities. There were several concentrations

370

Texas Archeological Society

of sherds in the southern part of the burial pit, and
these probably represent the remnants of at least
three vessels that had been placed at the time of
interment with the deceased. Although not noted
in the field notes, a limonite pebble (33 x 33 x 23
mm) with ground facets and scratch marks was also
found amidst the sherd concentrations in the Burial
34 fill.
The base and lower body of a plain shell-tempered vessel (Vessel section 1) was reconstructed
from sherds in the burial pit area, and a second
vessel section consisted of 49 plain shell-tempered
sherds. The third vessel section was the upper portion of a red-slipped Taylor Engraved deep bowl.
To summarize the results of the TAS excavations, the available information on grave orientation
and body position of the terrace cemetery burials
indicates that these Caddo individuals were buried in
pits generally laid out in an east-west direction (see
Figures 37 to 42). Each body was laid on the grave
floor in an extended supine position with the head
at the eastern end of the grave and facing west. A
variety of grave goods or funerary offerings would
have been placed with the individuals—including
ceramic vessels (probably containing foodstuffs
and liquids), ceramic pipes, arrow point quivers,
celts, bone tools, and shell and bone ornaments—
depending upon their age, sex, and social position
in the local Caddo community.
As mentioned earlier, there were several notable kinds of grave goods placed with the deceased
Caddos in the Terrace area cemetery. Among them
are an elbow pipe, three arrow points, red ochre (in
the elbow region), marine shell beads (at the skull),
and at least four drilled animal rib ornaments with
Burial 30 (a young adult male), a shell bead headdress and a European glass trade bead with Burial
31 (adult female), and an elbow pipe and a cache
of arrow points with Burial 33 (an adult male).
The glass bead in Burial 31 is a small, round,
and drawn Robin’s Egg Blue-colored bead, about
5.3 mm in diameter. According to the Kidd and
Kidd (1970) scheme for the classification of glass
beads, the Burial 31 bead is a IIa40 variety. It is
a common bead type on historic Caddo sites in
northeastern Texas, and Brain (1979:102) suggests
a manufacture age range of AD 1600-1836, with
a median date of A.D. 1737. Caddo sites in the
region with this bead variety date from ca. A.D.
1700-1770.
Four of the burials also had marine shell bead
grave offerings. In Burial 31, there were 20 shell

disc beads about 6.3 mm in diameter, 10 large (6.6
mm in length) barrel-shaped shell beads, and one
small (3.8 mm in length) barrel-shaped shell bead
(Figure 43). A large (11.0 mm) bird bone bead was
also found amidst the shell beads in the probable
shell headdress.
Burial 24 had a single small marine shell disc
bead (Figure 44a), and Burial 27 had two small disc
beads and a large columella bead. This bead was
19.6 mm in length and 9.7 mm in diameter, with a
3.6 mm perforation for stringing. The HBC 10 bead
was a large shell disc bead, 8.9 mm in diameter and
with a 3.6 mm perforation. Burial 28 had a very
large marine shell columella bead (see Figure 44f)
that was 65.5 mm in length, 14.0 mm in diameter,
and had a 6.5 mm perforation.
Other ornaments were made from animal bone,
as was noted above in the discussion of the marine
shell headdress from Burial 31; there was one bone
bead in the headdress. As previously mentioned,
Burial 35 in the East Mound had 13 bone disc
beads. In Burial 30 were sets of drilled animal ribs
as well as a spatulate-shaped bone tool.
The drilled animal ribs (Figure 45) were found
around both elbows, and probably were attached to
clothing or a cloak worn by the adult male when he
was placed in the burial pit. The drilled animal ribs
would apparently have been suspended from the
cloak or clothing. In the left arm area, there were
eight animal rib sections, the longest of which was 78
mm, and one rib with a broken perforation; the single
perforations were drilled through the uppermost end
of the rib. There were four complete drilled ribs under
the right arm, as well as 12 rib section fragments. The
complete ribs were 3.6 mm thick, with 3.1 mm perforations (see Figure 45). From miscellaneous contexts
in the burial, there were also recovered 10 more rib
section fragments and two ribs with perforations.
Thus, there may have been as many as seven drilled
animal ribs attached to a cloak or clothing worn by
the Burial 30 Caddo male.
The bone tool in Burial 30 (Figure 46) was
found under the left arm, and it was poorly preserved. It had a spatulate form with a beveled
interior and top element, and a rounded tip. It is
only 3.5 mm thick, and must have been used for
more delicate activities, perhaps the shaving and
final smoothing of hides or textiles. Its total length
is 15.5 cm, and its greatest width is 2.24 cm, near
the top part of the tool.
The two elbow pipes (from Burials 30 and
33, both adult males) have short stems and bowls,

with a rounded shoulder. They are shell-tempered
(Figure 47). The stems varied from 45-56 mm in
length, with bowl heights between 19 and 32 mm.
The bowls are fairly large (37.5-47 mm in ori-

fice diameter), and could have held considerable
amounts of tobacco or other smoking substances
used by the Caddo.
Most of the burials had ceramic sherds in the
grave fill, as well as broken remnants of vessels
(whole vessels had generally been previously
removed by pothunters). Table 9 provides a listing of the artifacts found in the terrace cemetery
as well as Burial 35 in the East Mound. This list
includes artifacts that were clearly placed in the
burial pits as funerary objects; artifacts found in
the general burial fill; and artifacts found during
the documentation of human bone concentrations
or burials where no specific burial pit could be
discerned. The quantities and kinds of artifacts
listed in Table 9 supersedes the earlier version of
this table in Perttula et al. (2001: Table 4).
One of the Terrace area graves contained only a
subadult (Burials 29), another six had adults (Burials
24, 25, 30-33), and the remainder contained both
adults and subadults. The subadult (Burial 29) was
buried next to a burned clay hearth and hard-packed
surface, which probably marks the remnants of a
house floor. Children were commonly buried below
the floors of prehistoric and early historic Caddo

All the vessels, and about 97 percent of the
sherds in the grave fill, are shell-tempered, and thus
are from the Late Caddo McCurtain phase use of the
terrace area (see Table 9). The non-shell-tempered
rim and/or decorated sherds were found primarily in
the general surface collections of the eroded terrace
(n=10) as well as in the fills of Burials 24 and 25,
and signify a very limited prehistoric Caddo use of
the area before ca. A.D. 1300. Noted among the nonshell-tempered decorated sherds were several rims
with sets of horizontal incised lines: these are from
vessels with flat lips, possibly Coles Creek Incised

vessel sherds. One of these is decorated on the lip
with deep incised lines and five rows of small tool
punctates. Other decorated sherds from this earlier prehistoric Caddo component include one with
cross-hatched engraving; a rim with cross-hatched
incised lines; another rim with a zoned punctateddiagonal incised decorative element; and a body
sherd with rows of fingernail punctates.
Not including the isolated vessel in Feature 706
(see Figure 48), the whole or partial vessels/vessel
sections were found as grave goods in Burials 27,
28, 30, 31, 32, and 34 (Table 10). In general, the

Perttula—The Archeology of the Roitsch Site (41RR16) 377

whole and partial vessels found in the terrace area
are from a Late Caddo McCurtain phase occupation
postdating ca. A.D. 1450 (see discussion in Perino
[1994:28]), and the Hudson Engraved and Keno
Trailed vessels bespeak continued use of the area
(as well as the East Mound) for interments to at
least A.D. 1650. The recovery of Talco arrow points
from two different burials (Burials 30 and 33) also
indicate that the cemetery was used by the Caddo
peoples after A.D. 1600. Finally, Burial 31 had a
single glass bead in the burial fill, and this interment
likely dates to the late 17th to early 18th century.
The vessels and vessel sections included a
Hudson Engraved bowl with a short everted rim
(and a small node below the lip) in Burial 27 (Figure 49a-b), and another (Vessel 5) in Burial 28.
This was a black polished bottle vessel section,
with very thin body walls (3.1 mm). There were
parts of two Nash Neck Banded jars in Burial 28
(Figure 50), and other Nash Neck Banded rim and
body sherds from various burial features that have
appliqued lines or ridges extending downward

from the shoulders of the vessels.
A red-slipped and shell-tempered Avery Engraved vessel section was found in Burial 31 (see
Table 10). Two different burials (Burials 28 and
32) had Emory Punctated-Incised vessel sections
(Figure 51). The Burial 28 vessel had a single row
of deep punctations under the lip. There were also
the reconstructed base and lower body of two plain
shell-tempered jars in Burial 34 (see Table 9). Although not readily reconstructed, some 33 sherds
from a Keno Trailed bottle were part of the grave
goods in Burial 30 (Figure 52); three other burials
also had sherds of Keno Trailed.
Burials 28 and 34 had vessel sections of shelltempered Taylor Engraved deep bowls (cf. Suhm
and Jelks 1962: Plate 75d, g). The Burial 28 vessel (represented by 61 sherds) had a short, plain
rim and a broad scroll element on the upper body
(Figure 53). There was a red ochre-rich clay pigment smeared in the engraved lines, and there are
two pot hunter probe holes visible on the vessel.
The large Burial 34 Taylor Engraved vessel (30
cm orifice diameter) is red-slipped on both interior
and exterior surfaces, and has a decorative motif
of scrolls and hatched triangles pendant from the
upper and lower rim. Similar decorative elements
were noted on Taylor Engraved vessels from the
Rowland Clark site (Perino 1994: Figure 12e).
Decorated pieces and rims of shell-tempered
sherds were recovered in the following burial features: Human Bone Concentrations (HBC) 1, 4, 5,
6, 9, and 10, as well as Burials 24-28, 30-34 (Figure
54); only Burial 29 did not have any shell-tempered
pottery, plain or decorated. Engraved vessels and
sherds (n=79) of Avery Engraved (usually redslipped), Simms Engraved, and Hudson Engraved
are well represented in the collections, and engraved
sherds were found in all the burial features with
the exception of HBC 5 (see Table 9). Plain redslipped vessels (i.e., Clement redware) were also
an important part of the fine wares in the terrace
area cemetery. More than 5 percent of the plain
shell-tempered rims are red-slipped, and almost 19
percent of the decorated shell-tempered sherds have
only a red slip on one or both vessel surfaces.
The recovery of incised and/or punctated
sherds (n=44) from broken Emory PunctatedIncised jars in HBC 4 and 9, as well as all the
burial features (see Table 10), suggest that these
were certainly also common grave good inclusions during the later part of the McCurtain phase.

area, sherds with nodes (n=4), and sherds with
appliqued ridges and triangles (n=30) are also
from Nash Neck Banded jars. The common use
of appliqued decorations on the shoulders of these
vessels also suggest that the burials and HBC’s
with neck-banded vessels date late in the McCurtain phase occupation of the site, probably well
after A.D. 1450. Neck banded sherds were found
in HBC 4 and 5, and in all the burial features (see
Table 10).
Lithic tools, including cores (n=3), from the
Terrace Area are dominated by arrow points (n=15).
Among the arrow point types represented are four
Talco points, three Maud points, four Massard A or
Massard B points (see Brown 1996), and a single
example of a Homan point (Class X); the latter is
from Burial 32. The Talco points are from Burial
30 and Burial 33, and all four of the Massard points
(Class XII) are from Burial 33 (Figure 55).
The prevalence of Talco points in two of the
Roitsch burials in the terrace cemetery is consistent

with the primary use of the Terrace area well after
ca. A.D. 1500-1600. These Talco points are made
exclusively from novaculite (and 80 percent of the
terrace cemetery arrow points are made from this
distinctive lithic raw material, which is present in
local Red River gravels, with an ultimate source in
the southern Ouachita Mountains), and have long
resharpened and serrated blades and a shallow
basal concavity. At the Roitsch site, only two other
Talco points have been recovered besides those
from the cemetery, one in Block I and the other
in Block III (see Appendix IX, this article). The
Talco points from the Roitsch site are identical to a
cache of 19 Talco points from Burial 28 at the Alex
Justiss site (41TT13), a 17th century Titus phase
Caddo cemetery in the Big Cypress Creek basin,
at least 80 km away. Most of these were made
from novaculite (Rogers et al. 2003:98 and Figure
40a-s), and were probably obtained in trade with
Late Caddo McCurtain phase groups living along
the middle reaches of the Red River.

The Class X Homan point from Burial 32 has
a broad expanding stem, a short and resharpened
blade, and a convex base. It is made from white novaculite. Three of the four Class XII Massard points
(see Figure 55a-d) are also made of novaculite,
and the other was made from a dark brown chert.
These arrow points have an expanding stem, and are
corner-notched, with a short stem and blade, along
with a flat base; the blade is carefully serrated on
each of the four points in Burial 33. Other examples
of the Massard point at the Roitsch
site are limited to Block III, in the
Late Caddo McCurtain phase village area (see Appendix IX, this
article).
Other lithic tools from the
terrace area include four celt
fragments from surface contexts,
a sandstone grinding slab from
Burial 24, and a quartzite hammerstone fragment from Burial
34. One single platform core of
Big Fork chert came from unit
N414 E600, and two other cores
(single and multiple platform
flake cores of brownish-gray chert
and red jasper, respectively) were
found in the excavations of Burial
25 and Burial 27.

Mr. Arnold Roitsch had a
number of Caddo ceramic vessels
in his possession that came from
burials on his property. He recently
donated these vessels to the Caddo
Nation of Oklahoma, and the Caddo
Nation have generously allowed
them to be documented as part of
the Nation’s museum inventory
process. Descriptions of selected
examples are included herein.
Of the 28 vessels in the
Roitsch collection, three appear
from stylistic criteria to be from
Mound Prairie phase contexts at
the Roitsch site. Excavations by
Skinner et al. (1969) and the excavations completed by the Texas
Archeological Society have shown that Mound
Prairie phase archeological deposits are widely
scattered across the village area, but are concentrated around (and under) the East Mound. These
vessels in the Roitsch collection include a redslipped Maxey Noded Redware bottle with sets of
punctations around the upper body (Figure 56a), a
carinated bowl with engraved pendant triangles and
a notched lip (Figure 56b), and another carinated
bowl with a scalloped rim/lip and engraved circles

bowls with distinctive short rims
(Figure 57e). The utility wares are
dominated by Nash Neck Banded

(Figure 58a-c). There are also four
plain bottles in the collection, as
well as a distinctive noded bowl
(Figure 59). The noded bowl has

sex, and seven subadults (Table 11) (Derrick et al.
1994, see Derrick et al., below). Adults ranged in
height from 153.22 cm (young adult female) to
163.32 cm (a male in his late 40s to mid-50s), indicating these Caddo were short in height. Most of
the individuals at the Roitsch site died before they
were 40 years of age, although some of the adults
lived to old age (between 55 and 60 years of age
at death).
A number of medical disorders were identified
by Derrick et al. (see below), with degenerative
joint diseases, osteoarthritis, and vertebral osteophytosis being particularly common among both
adult males and females at Roitsch (see Table 11).
Bone infections were also prevalent in the Roitsch
human remains, especially healed supra-inion
depressions on the occipital bones which Derrick
et al. attribute to infections associated with the
practice of cranial modeling among the Caddo
populations at the site. As Derrick et al. note, cranial modeling is a common practice among Caddo
groups on the Red River (see also Loveland and
Bass 1983; Loveland 1987; Derrick and Wilson
1997), and Burials 24, 27b, 28 (it is not clear which
of the four individuals [Burial 28a-d] had cranial
modeling because of the erosional commingling of
individuals in the burial deposit), 31, 33, 35, and
36 exhibit the shaping of the frontal and occipital
areas of the head.
Pathologies indicative of nutritional and
developmental disorders are present only in low
frequencies in the Roitsch burials (see Table 11).
However, there is a high incidence of local traumas
in a number of the individuals—both male and
female—including healed skull and postcranial
fractures, a damaged tooth, and trauma damage to
a shoulder joint and patella.
All of the adult individuals from the Roitsch
site had dental caries, and the dental caries rate
is substantial per person (Derrick et al., below).
There is less tooth wear among the Caddo populations living at Roitsch compared to other aboriginal populations living in Texas (cf. Colby 1997),
which may relate to the “use of wooden mortars
and pestles when grinding corn” (Derrick et al.
1994:13).
The prevalence of caries among the adults, significant tooth loss and abscesses among the adults,
and the high stable carbon isotope rates from burials 24 and 35, as well as similar high rates from
two individuals in the East Mound shaft tomb at
Roitsch (Skinner et al. 1969) analyzed by Derrick

et al., all are clear evidence that the Caddo groups
at Roitsch were agriculturists who consumed large
quantities of maize (see also Fritz and Goldborer,
this article). Interestingly, there were no real differences between males and females in the stable
carbon isotope values, suggesting that the Caddo
population at Roitsch had a relatively homogenous
diet, regardless of status or sex. Stable carbon isotope results from other Caddo populations in the
Middle Red River (e.g., from the Roden, Holdeman, and Rowland Clark sites; data on file at the
Texas Historical Commission, see also Appendix
X, this article) further suggest that the intensive
consumption of maize by the Caddo occurred only
after ca. A.D. 1200 (cf. Perttula 2008).

The vast majority of the archeological deposits at the Roitsch site are part of the Late Caddo
McCurtain phase community along the Red River,
and most of the work completed during the Texas
Archeological Society (TAS) Field School was in
this extensive archeological component. However,
during the course of the field work, pre-A.D. 1300
archeological deposits were encountered in several
areas of the site, including the 1991 Youth Area
(see below) and Block VI.
Block VI is a small excavation (4.25 m2) centered over a large Middle Caddo period, Mound
Prairie phase, ash and midden-filled pit feature

Perttula—The Archeology of the Roitsch Site (41RR16) 387
(Fea. 601) identified during core probing of the
alluvial terrace south of the East Mound conducted at our request by Mr. Greg Perino of Idabel,
Oklahoma. The block is approximately 35 m eastsoutheast of Block III (see Figure 5).
Feature 601 is a 1.2 m diameter circular pit
(Figure 60) that extends from 23-83 cm bs, with
relatively straight walls and a flat, level floor
(Figure 61). The pit extends almost 40 cm into the
B-horizon, a red sandy clay. The pit feature had unfortunately been previously disturbed by pothunters, but its overall character and contents were still
readily ascertained. The feature was excavated well
into the underlying clay B-horizon, and it was filled
primarily with midden debris (including ceramics,
animal bone, daub/burned clay, and freshwater
mussel shells), but the lower 25 cm of the pit was
composed of an homogenous bed of ash (Figure
62a-b, see also Figure 61). The pit walls had been
fired red, to the extent that a 3 cm thick fired lining
was apparent around the edges of the feature. The
high heat that created the fired walls, and the thick
ash bed, suggest that Feature 601 was a heavily utilized cooking feature. Similar kinds of ash-filled pit
features were noted at the nearby Rowland Clark
site (Perino 1994:Table 2). A radiocarbon sample

on charred nutshells from the feature in Block VI
dates to cal A.D. 1154-1296 (RA=0.75, 1 sigma)
(Beta-46957).
A high density of archeological materials
were recovered from the Block VI excavations,
particularly ceramic sherds, animal bone, burned
clay and daub, and pieces of freshwater mussel shell
(Table 12). The overall density of material remains
is more than 810 artifacts per m2, slightly more than
the artifact density in the Block IV McCurtain phase
archeological deposits (see Table 3).
Twenty-six decorated sherds and seven plain
rims were found in the Block VI excavations, along
with 1053 plain body and base sherds. About 45
percent (n=15) of these decorated sherds and plain
rim sherds were recovered in the fill of Feature 601,
the large ash-filled pit, with the remainder being
scattered from 0-40 cm bs in general midden and
habitation contexts outside of the feature itself. The
feature has a mixture of Mound Prairie phase and
McCurtain phase ceramics, another indication that
the feature had been disturbed by looting activities
sometime before the TAS investigations.
Most of the sherds (72 percent) were tempered
with grog, grit, or bone. These sherds are from
the Mound Prairie phase use of the feature in that
horizontal engraved (n=1), plain grog-tempered
and non-slipped bowls, and a Pennington Punctated
Incised rim from a large bowl were identified in
this sherd assemblage (Figure 63b).
Six of the 19 Mound Prairie phase rim and decorated sherds are plain rims, suggesting that plain
vessels were relatively common in the ceramic
assemblage. By comparison, only 7 percent of the
shell-tempered rim and decorated sherds are plain
rim fragments. These rims have direct or standing
profiles (see Figure 63e), with flat lips. One is also
interior thickened, another possible diagnostic
attribute of Mound Prairie phase ceramics. The
majority of the decorated sherds are incised (n=8),
followed by punctated (n=2), punctated-incised
(n=2), and engraved (n=1).
The incised sherds have horizontal, parallel
(orientation of the sherds is indeterminate),
curvilinear (see Figure 63h), and diagonal incised
elements. The horizontal and parallel elements
comprise 63 percent of the non-shell-tempered
incised sherds from Block VI. Both of the punctated
sherds have at least one row of tool punctations (see
Figure 63c). The first punctated-incised sherd is a rim
with a row of fingernail punctates below the lip, and
placed above two horizontal incised lines (see Figure

388

Texas Archeological Society

63d). The other is the Pennington Punctated Incised
body sherd with an incised zone filled with large cane
punctates (see Figure 63b). The engraved sherd, from
a red-slipped vessel, has horizontal engraved lines on
it (see Figure 63g).
The remainder of the rim and decorated sherds
(n=14) in Block VI have abundant burned shell
fragments added as temper to the paste, and these
are likely associated with the large McCurtain
phase village deposits encountered in nearby
Blocks III and IV. Of the shell-tempered sherds
in these excavations, five are from Nash Neck
Banded jars, two are red-slipped rims (see Figure
63a), one is a plain rim, and the others include engraved (n=3), incised (n=2), and appliqued (n=1,

see Figure 63f) elements; this last
sherd is probably from an Emory
Punctated-Incised jar. The incised
sherds have either a single straight
line or a set of diagonal incised
lines, and these are also likely
from Emory Punctated-Incised
vessels. All three of the engraved
sherds are from red-slipped vessels, suggesting they are from
Avery Engraved bowls and bottles.
One bottle sherd has two parallel
engraved lines on it, while the
others have only a single engraved
FEATURE 601
line of indeterminate orientation or
decorative element.
Although the sample is small,
the frequency of shell-tempered
neck banded sherds in the Block
VI ceramics is consistent with
the Block III/IV and earlier McCurtain phase
ceramic assemblage, rather than to the later (after
ca. A.D. 1600) McCurtain phase ceramics on the
East Mound and in several of the very Late Caddo
graves on the terrace. This suggests that the archeological deposits in Blocks III/IV are generally
contemporaneous with the more limited McCurtain
phase use of the Block VI area.
Four Red River style long-stemmed pipe
sherds were found in Block VI, three stem sherds
and a bowl sherd; the stems were all from Feature
601. The bowl sherd is from N447 E532. All the
pipe sherds were tempered with finely-crushed
bone, and both bowl and stem pieces had remnants
of a red slip on the exterior of the pipe.

Only six lithic tools were found in the Block VI
excavations, three arrow points, a flake tool (N446

dart point (N446 E532) made from a heat-treated
quartzite, and a fragment of a ground and polished

celt made from Ouachita Mountains greenstone
(N446 E531). The arrow points include an Early
to Middle Caddo period Catahoula specimen from
N446 E531, made of local claystone-siltstone, and
a broad side-notched specimen (with a flat base),

probably of the Reed or Haskell types (see Brown
1996). The one Late Caddo arrow point is from
0-10 cm bs. It is a Big Fork chert Maud point, also
a common find in Blocks III and IV.
The thickness and stem width of the Block VI
dart point is consistent with a Gary, var. LeFlore
specimen, estimated to date from 2400-1700 years
ago by Schambach (1982, 1998). The recovery of
this one point implies a limited use of this part of
the alluvial landform during the earliest part of the
Woodland period.

1991 YOUTH AREA
ARCHEOLOGICAL
INVESTIGATIONS AT THE
ROITSCH SITE (41RR16)
Timothy K. Perttula
INTRODUCTION
The 1991 Texas Archeological Society (TAS)
Youth Area excavations were placed at the extreme

south end of the large alluvial terrace some
distance away from where most of the field school
investigations took place at the A. E. Roitsch site.
The terrace overlooks a small drainage, probably
an old filled-in Red River channel, that flows
between Salt Well Slough and Big Pine Creek.
Extensive Formative-Early to Late Caddo
habitation areas are located some 300-400 m north
of the Youth Area along the same terrace (Figure
64). Blocks III-IV and VI were excavated in these
areas during the field school. Other evidence of
prehistoric to early Historic Caddo settlement is
present south of the Youth Area at the Bob Williams farm (Perino 1983), and the Roitsch site itself
stretches for more than 1.5 km along the river.
This southern part of the Roitsch site was
selected for investigations because the Texas
Historical Commission staff and TAS volunteers
had been able to locate, by shovel testing and 50
x 50 cm excavation units completed before the
field school began, intact but fairly shallow archeological deposits containing a variety of stone
and ceramic artifacts that appeared to be either
Woodland or Formative Caddo period in age. More
importantly, no Late Caddo materials seemed to

Perttula—The Archeology of the Roitsch Site (41RR16) 391
be present here. It was thus hoped that excavation
work by the children in this Youth Area would be
able to retrieve useful archeological information on
the material culture and features from these earlier
occupations—which are somewhat masked by Late
Caddo period occupational remains elsewhere on
the site—thus contributing to our overall understanding of the village structure and use of the
Roitsch site during several cultural periods (e.g.,
Bruseth et al. 1991:21-22).
The Youth Area Director for the work was
Sallie Taylor. Three 4 x 4 m blocks (Blocks A-C)
were laid out near the edge of the terrace, and a
total of 20 1 x 1 m units within the three blocks
were excavated during the course of the Field
School (Figure 65). The units were excavated in
10-cm thick levels to between 20 and 50 cm below
surface (bs), depending on the unit. In no case were
culturally sterile deposits reached during the work,
although the greatly diminishing artifact densities

below 40-50 cm bs suggest that excavations had
sampled the principal occupational deposits in the
Youth Area. Supervising the children in the three
blocks were Pat Brown (Block A, kindergarten
through second grade), Lynda Cockburn (Block
B, third-fifth grade), and Deana Grubis (Block C,
sixth-ninth grade).

RESULTS OF THE EXCAVATIONS
The 1991 work at the Youth Area documented a
fairly dense archeological deposit pertaining almost
exclusively to a Mound Prairie or Middle Caddo
period (ca. A.D. 1100-1300) occupation on this part
of the alluvial terrace. A few artifacts may also be
indicative of both limited Woodland period (ca. A.D.
1-800) and Late Caddo period McCurtain phase (ca.
A.D. 1300-1600+) use of the area, but substantial
occupations during those times were not present. The

archeological materials are confined to a ca. 40-50 cm
thick brown sandy loam A-horizon alluvial sediment
overlying a B-horizon sandy clay subsoil.
No cultural features were documented in the
excavations, although one possible post hole stain
was noted at the base of the A-horizon in Unit
N202 E527 (Block C). Six other widely scattered
charcoal stains were described in the field notes as
lying between 20-40 cm bs in the three blocks (see
Figure 65). These charcoal stains might represent
additional post holes, but excavations were not carried to a sufficient depth (and the charcoal stains
were not sectioned or profiled) to determine their
cultural origin, functional character, or determine if
they exhibited any spatial patterning. Nonetheless,
if they are cultural rather than natural features, as
seems likely, we may presume that they probably
represent vestiges of a prehistoric Caddo structure
(or structures) that stood on the terrace. Additionally, the quantity of daub recovered in the excava-

tions in the Youth Area suggests that structures
were present in this area of the site. Substantial
amounts of fire-cracked quartzite and sandstone
pieces throughout the three blocks hint that hearths
and cooking features (i.e., pits and ovens) may also
be preserved in the Youth Area.

DESCRIPTION OF CULTURAL
MATERIALS
A large quantity of cultural materials were
recovered in the block excavations, including 627
pottery sherds (among them two sherds from longstemmed Red River pipes), 65 chipped and ground
stone tools, 1550 pieces of lithic debris (some 1
percent of which are flakes from the resharpening
of ground stone celts) and cores, 72 pieces of daub
and fired clay, 308 fire-cracked rocks, 136 animal
bones, and one mussel shell fragment (Table 13).

Ceramic Sherds and Pipes
The 627 ceramic vessel sherds from the Youth
Area were recovered from the three blocks (n=597)
and the few 50 x 50 cm units (n=30). Most of
the ceramics from the Youth Area are relatively
thin and plain, grog-tempered (62 percent), and
grog-bone-tempered (27) percent) wares. Bone,
bone-grog-grit (crushed pieces of rock, including
hematite and sandstone), and grog-grit tempers
were less common aplastic combinations in the
ceramic assemblage. A single thick Williams Plain
flowerpot-shaped base sherd was found in the block
excavations, but in general the ceramic sherd walls
range between 6.6-7.9 mm in thickness (for body
sherds) (Table 14), and are not as coarsely tempered as is the Williams Plain ceramics found on
Woodland period sites along the middle Red River
and elsewhere in Northeast Texas, southwestern
Arkansas, and southeastern Oklahoma (see Schambach 1998, 2001, 2002). The variety of decorated
sherds in the sample indicate that it is more likely
that the plain sherds derive instead from undecorated parts of vessels from a prehistoric Caddo
occupation in the 1991 Youth Area.
Some eight percent of the grog-tempered body
and base sherds (and one bone and grog-tempered
sherd) have a hematite-derived red slip (Table 15)
that was applied to the exterior surface of bowls
and bottles; this is probably Sanders Plain (cf.

Brown 1971, 1996), an apparently rather popular
Formative to Middle Caddo period ceramic type
along the middle reaches of the Red River (see
Krieger 1946, 2000). One grog-tempered sherd
has a black slip, indicating that the hematite-rich
slipped vessel had been reduced during firing,
rather than being oxidized as with the other
sherds. The proportion of slipped sherds (5.2
percent, but ranging from 2-9.3 percent by block)
from the body and base sherds is considerably
higher than the amount of slipped sherds at the
contemporaneous Fasken site, where only 0.8
percent of the 4228 sherds have a slip (see Prikryl,
this volume: Table 10).
A more detailed analysis of the surface treatment of a select sample of the plain sherds from
the 1991 Youth area indicate that between 20-27.5
percent had smoothed interior or exterior smoothing or burnishing, and about 20 percent of the
interior surface of the sherds had smudging or soot
marks from the use of vessels over an open fire;
residues of organic remains also indicate their use
for cooking (Table 16). The generally low percentage of evidence of surface treatment is likely a
product of post-depositional conditions (erosion
and weathering) that have degraded the interior and
exterior walls of the ceramic sherds, but the amount
of smoothed and/or burnished surfaces among the
different temper classes suggests that exterior roughened and interior smoothed/burnished vessels were
manufactured and used to ensure better control of
thermal shock resistance (Schiffer et al. 1994:210)
and lower vessel permeability, hence improving a
vessel’s heating effectiveness (Rice 1996:148).

horizontal and vertical distribution of the plain body
and base sherds by temper classes in the 1991 Youth
area. About 80 percent of the sherds are concentrated
in the upper 20 cm of the alluvial terrace deposits,
and grog-tempered and bone-grog-tempered wares
comprise between 85-93 percent of the sherds
from each of the three blocks. The bone-tempered,
grog-grit-tempered, and bone-grog-grit-tempered
plain sherds each amount to between 1-4 percent
of the sherds from the different blocks. Clearly, the

ceramics from the 1991 Youth area at the Roitsch
site are homogenous in character.
The decorated sherds (Table 20) include small
samples of incised (n=11), punctated (n=6), and
punctated-incised (n=1) body and rim sherds
from Canton Incised, East Incised, or Crockett
Curvilinear Incised vessels, along with diagonal
and horizontal engraved decorative elements
(n=5) that are probably from carinated bowls of
the Sanders Engraved and Hickory Fine Engraved

Perttula—The Archeology of the Roitsch Site (41RR16) 395
types (Figure 66). Although the red-slipped
sherds are considered a form of surface treatment
(see Tables 15 and 16), they are also a form of
decoration, and are included in the discussion that
follows. The plain red-slipped sherds include both
rims (n=2) and body sherds (n=30)
These kinds of decorated Caddo ceramics have
been found in a Mound Prairie phase Caddo component around the East Mound (Blocks I/II) at Roitsch,
and in abundance in grave lots at the western end of
the Holdeman site (41RR11), a few km downstream
from the Roitsch site along the Red River (Perino
1995; Perttula, this volume). One grog-tempered
and red-slipped noded-punctated sherd (N200 E525,
level 2) is from a Maxey Noded Redware bottle (see
Figure 66, top row, left), another kind of ceramic
found consistently but in low frequencies in Middle
Caddo period or Sanders phase contexts along the
middle Red River (see Krieger 1946, 2000; Perttula
1997a, 1997b) as well as other parts of northeastern
Texas north of the Sabine River.
The proportion of slipped sherds in the 1991
Youth area assemblage at Roitsch is substantial compared to the ca. A.D. 1100-1300 ceramic assemblage
documented at the Fasken mound site. At Roitsch,
approximately 5.1 percent of all the rim, body, and
base sherds have a red slip, along with 57 percent
of the decorated sherds (see Tables 15 and 20). By
comparison, only 0.8 percent of the sherds at the
Fasken site have a red slip, and 25 percent of the
decorated sherds are slipped (see Prikryl, this volume: Table 10). Furthermore, although there are differences in sample sizes (i.e., Roitsch Youth area has
627 sherds and Fasken has 4428 sherds), the proportion of decorated sherds in the Youth area ceramic
assemblage (9 percent) is three times greater than
at Fasken (3 percent), and four to five times greater
than in the McCurtain phase village deposits at the
Roitsch site. This suggests a considerable diminishing of decorated vessels (or at least a diminishing in
the amount of surface area on vessels covered with
a decorative element) from Formative-Early to Late
Caddo period contexts on Mound Prairie, as well as
differences between residential and civic-ceremonial
sites of the Formative-Early and Middle Caddo period in ceramic vessel assemblages.
There are also nine plain rims in the 1991
Youth area ceramic assemblage (one each from
N192 E512, level 1; N193 E515, level 2; N195
E513, level 3; N200 E514, level 1; N200 E525,
level 1; N203 E513, level 1; and three from N194
E512, level 1). They have standing (or vertical)

profiles, ranging in thickness from 5.5-8.5 mm,
with rounded to flat lips. One rim from a carinated
bowl sherd in unit N193 E515, level 2 also has an
exterior fold. Two of these plain rims (grog and
grog-bone-tempered) have a hematite-rich red slip
added to interior and/or exterior surfaces.
About five percent of the plain body sherds
from the Youth Area are from plain shell-tempered
vessels (likely jars), most coming from the upper
levels (0-20 cm) of blocks A (n=6.8 percent) and B
(n=6.3 percent); only 1 percent of the sherds from
Block C had shell tempering. These indicate some
limited use of this end of the alluvial terrace during
the early part of the Late Caddo period McCurtain
phase, probably between ca. A.D. 1300-1500, as
this would be contemporaneous with the main Late
Caddo occupational deposits elsewhere on the alluvial terrace (particularly in Blocks III and IV).
The two long-stemmed Red River pipe sherds,
from an unknown variety (e.g., Hoffman 1967),
were found in nearby units in Block B (N192 E
514, level 3 and N195 E513, level 2), although
from temper and surface treatment attributes they
appear to be broken fragments from two different
long-stemmed pipes. The bowl sherd from N195
E513 is 3 mm thick, has no apparent temper, and
the surface is unsmoothed and undecorated. The
medial pipe stem in N192 E514 was tempered with
burnt bone, and the surface is well-smoothed; the
stem opening diameter is 6.5 mm.
Daub and Burned Clay
A small amount of burned clay and daub is
dispersed throughout the archeological deposits in
the Youth Area (Table 21), with the majority of the
pieces in levels 2 and 3 (10-30 cm bs). The burned
clay probably represents the remnants of Caddo
clay-lined hearths and mud applied to grass and
stick-lined structure walls that did not preserve
impressions, while the daub are pieces of fired clay
from structure walls that did retain impressions
of the grass and stick “wattle.” Most of the daub
has either unidentifiable or grass impressions, but
one piece of daub from Block B shows small stick
impressions (see Table 21).
Lithic Artifacts
The 14 arrow points include three of the
Alba type, and one Catahoula, along with 10
unidentifiable arrow point blade and tip fragments

(Figure 67). These kinds of stemmed arrow points
are principally recovered in Formative to Middle
Caddo period contexts in northeastern Texas.
The Alba arrow points, all fragmentary, have
parallel stems, rounded bases, and serrated blades,
ranging in thickness from 2.5-4 mm. Two were
manufactured on claystone/siltstone (N192 E512,
level 2 and N195 E513, level 2), and the third was
made on a heat-treated Ogallala quartzite (N203

E524, level 1). The Catahoula specimen, from
N202 E527, level 1, has characteristic broad and
prominent barbs, deep corner-notches, and a short
expanding stem; the blade is serrated. It was manufactured on a Ouachita Mountains chert originating
in the Red River gravels.
The only complete arrow point from the 1991
Youth Area has an expanding stem, a rudimentary
shoulder on one side of the point, a flat base, and a

fragments (N200 E512, level 1, N200 E527, level 4,
and N203 E515, level 1) of chalcedony, claystone/
siltstone, and jasper; (c) four distal tips—two of
Red River gravel cherts (N192 E512, level 1, and
N201 E524, level 4), one unifacially worked tip of
chalcedony (N203 E513, level 2) with a serrated
blade, and one claystone/siltstone (N200 E527, level
3)—and (d) a basal fragment of chalcedony found
in unit N195 E515, level 4. The broken arrow point
fragments are evenly dispersed across the three
excavation blocks in the 1991 Youth Area.
A single small contracting stem Gary dart point
made of Red River claystone/siltstone, was recovered

in unit N194 E512, level 1 of Block B (see Figure
67a). The point has irregular margins and lacks finepressure flaking along the blade edges, suggesting
either it was not completed before it was broken, or
that the blade edges were worn from use. The dart
could represent evidence for a Woodland period
occupation or transitory use of the Youth Area based
on its stem width (17.5 mm) and thickness (6.0 mm)
(cf. Schambach 1982:176 and Table 7-3), which are
consistent with the variety LeFlore style of Gary
points, or instead its use as a multi-purpose tool (such
as a knife or scraping implement) employed by the
prehistoric Caddo occupants.

Perttula—The Archeology of the Roitsch Site (41RR16) 401
Other lithic tools in the assemblage include
unifacial retouched pieces, gravers, drills, and
perforators, bifacial tool fragments and bifacial
arrow point preforms, fragments of three ground
stone manos, and part of a ground stone celt made
from Ouachita Mountains siliceous shale. The
sandstone and quartzitic sandstone manos were all
fire-cracked and fragmentary, having been recycled
from tools to hot rocks in hearths and ovens. One
or two surfaces of the tools were ground, and one
mano cobble (N201 E524, level 2) had been edgemodified by pecking and hammering.
The quantity of cores (n=13), lithic debris,
and bifacial preforms (n=4) from the excavations
indicate that stone tool manufacturing and refurbishing tasks were important activities during
the prehistoric Caddo use of the Youth Area.
Additionally, some of the fire-cracked rock may
be from the heat-treating of local quartzites
and cherts to improve their knappability (Larry
Banks, 1991 personal communication). Most of
the lithic raw materials, however, are fairly highquality Ouachita Mountain chert and quartzite raw
materials collected in Red River gravels.
Several different kinds of flake cores are present
in the 1991 Youth Area lithic assemblage: tested and
split-cobble (n=2), bipolar (n=3), single platform
(n=5), and multiple platform (n=3). As expected
for flake cores, these are uniformly on small (22-65
mm in length, 11-45 mm in width, and 9-28 mm in
width), stream-rolled pebbles with a limited number
of flake removals, and the size of flakes removed
would have been suitable for the manufacture of
tools such as arrow points, drills, and retouched/
utilized flakes. The presence of bipolar cores is
indicative of lithic reduction strategies constrained
by the small size of the available raw materials, in
that the small pebbles are easiest to reduce for flakes
by placing them on a hard surface, then smashing
them with a hammerstone.
The pebbles were collected from Red River
gravels, with the specific materials selected for
the production of flake tools primarily including
fine-grained Red River chert (n=5), jasper (n=4),
chalcedony (n=1), and claystone/siltstone (n=1).
The two coarse-grained quartzite and petrified
wood pebble cores had been roughly tested and
split, apparently to check their knapping quality,
and they subsequently were discarded without
further flake or core reduction.
The cores are concentrated in Block B. Some 77
percent of the cores were in this block, particularly

in units N194 E512 and N195 E515. Lithic debris is
also concentrated in this block, at densities 40-160
percent higher than in Blocks A and C, respectively.
Each of the different kinds of flake cores are represented in Block B, indicating it was a loci of general
tool manufacture, while Block A has only a single
jasper multiple platform core (N201 E513, level 4)
and Block C simply has a Red chert bipolar core
from unit N203 E526 (level 2) and a jasper single
platform flake core in N200 E525, level 4.
Faunal Remains
The analysis of the 1991 Youth Area faunal
remains was completed by Bonnie C. Yates, the
TAS Field School zooarcheologist. Only a small
amount of fauna was present in this part of the
Roitsch site, and this is primarily due to poor
preservation conditions created by the shallow,
acidic sediments that comprise this part of the
alluvial terrace deposits. The faunal remains were
concentrated (ca. 89 percent) in the upper 30 cm
of the archeological deposit, and the small amount
of fauna below 30 cm has probably been moved
down by bioturbation and pedoturbation actions.
Of the 136 pieces of animal bone from the
block excavations, 78 faunal elements were identified to the species or genera levels from the three
blocks in the Youth Area. This includes elements
from white-tailed deer (n=5), turtles (n=4), mud
turtle (n=1), and eastern cottontail rabbit (n=2),
species that are abundant in riverine and floodplain

402

habitats in Northeast Texas. All species were commonly exploited by prehistoric Caddo hunters living in the middle Red River valley (see Yates, this
article). Also in the assemblage were 31 elements
from medium/large mammals, 28 from vertebrates,
six from small/medium mammals, and one from a
small mammal. In all these cases, species were not
identifiable from these remains.
Historic Artifacts
The sample of historic artifacts includes six
(post-1900) artifacts from levels 1 (n=2) and 2
(n=4) in Block A. Two are modern orange glass
and plastic beads, probably residue from one of the
bead-making classes held by the Youth Area group
during the 1991 Field School, while the others are
a single wire nail fragment and three body pieces
of purpled (1880-1918) bottle glass.

SUMMARY
The Texas Archeological Society excavations at
the Roitsch site by the Youth group in 1991 barely
scratched the surface of a potentially very interesting
prehistoric Red River Caddo habitation locale occupied between about 650-900 years ago. Through
the well-placed and well-supervised efforts and
hard work of the Youth group and the Youth Area
supervisors, some 20 m2 of archeological deposits
were excavated and studied during the 1991 Field
School, resulting in the recovery of a substantial
archeological assemblage of lithics, ceramics, and
bone that helps to tell the story of the prehistoric
Caddo people’s settlement of the Red River Valley
of Northeast Texas. Best of all, much of this part of
the site remains untouched and undisturbed, waiting
to disclose its secrets to future archeologists.
To summarize the findings from the 1991 Youth
Area, limited excavations in this area of the Roitsch
site identified prehistoric use of the alluvial terrace
during Woodland, Formative to Middle Caddo, and
Late Caddo periods. Based on the kinds of ceramics
and lithic artifacts recovered in the three small blocks,
by far the most intensive occupation took place sometime during the Middle Caddo period or Mound Prairie phase, which is estimated to date from ca. A.D.
1100-1300 through comparisons with archeological
findings elsewhere at Roitsch and at the Fasken site
(see Prikryl, this volume), and at other prehistoric
Caddo sites in the middle Red River valley (e.g.,

Banks and Winters 1975; Perino 1995). One post
hole and several charcoal concentrations likely part
of that occupation may represent the elusive remains
of a grass and mud-covered Caddo structure(s) built
during this period of time at the site.

INTRODUCTION
This section of the article summarizes the results
of instrumental neutron activation analysis (INAA)
of ceramic samples from four Caddo sites in the Red
River valley in northeastern Texas, as well as other
Northeast Texas sites, conducted at the Missouri
University Research Reactor. These samples, 76
pottery sherd samples and five ceramic pipe samples,
are part of an ongoing investigation of compositional
variation in Caddo ceramics from northeastern Texas.
The main goals of this project are: (1) to assess the
compositional diversity of the assemblage from
several investigated sites; (2) to determine if compositional groups are associated with specific vessel
types, forms, or decorative elements; and (3) to see
if compositional variation at sites changed over time
and thus reflect differing ceramic-resource exploitation strategies or vessel-movement patterns.
The first samples submitted for this project
were recovered from the Hurricane Hill site
(41HP106; 40 samples) and the Mockingbird site
(41TT550; 10 samples) (see Neff et al. 1998a,
1999). An additional 39 samples, all from the Oak
Hill Village site (41RK214), were subsequently
submitted for INAA (see Rogers and Perttula
2004). The most recent 81 samples include three
sherds from the Dan Holdeman site (41RR11),
two from the Fasken site (41RR214), 21 from
the Roitsch site (41RR16), and 10 from Salt Well
Slough (41RR204), all from Texas Archeological
Society (TAS) investigations (Table 22), along
with 40 sherds and five ceramic pipe fragments
from Oak Hill Village. The remaining 134 sherd
samples comprise the total data set reported
in Table 23. Comparative data from a regional

analysis of ceramics (Steponaitis et al. 1996) also
were incorporated when appropriate.
Previous Research
The original INAA report (Neff et al. 1996,
1998a) indicated that pottery from the Late Caddo
period Titus phase Mockingbird site formed a
single compositional group, named the Titus Group.
Hurricane Hill pottery samples (Neff et al. 1999)
comprised two compositional groups: Hurricane
1, which had affiliations to the Titus Group, and
Hurricane 2, which we suggested had an affiliation
to pottery from the Great Bend area of the Red River
analyzed by Steponaitis et al. (1996). A preliminary

analysis that combined 39 samples from the Oak
Hill Village with the original 50 sample data set
(Neff 1998) increased the similarity between the
Hurricane 1 and Titus groups, and suggested that
two additional sub-groups existed in the data set,
Rusk 1 and Rusk 2. The latter groups consisted only
of samples from the Oak Hill Village. Further, the
Titus Group contained specimens from the Oak Hill
Village site, indicating that this group is composed
of sherd/vessel samples recovered from a wide
area, including parts of Rusk and Titus counties in
northeastern Texas. In sum, then, previous research
suggested that the Hurricane 1, Titus, Rusk 1,
and Rusk 2 groups may represent points along a
continuum from low rare earth, high alkali paste

compositions in the northwestern, upstream clay
sources, to higher rare earth, low alkali compositions
in southeastern, downstream sources. The addition
of 81 samples, including the 36 from four Red River
County Caddo sites, to the total data set affords an
opportunity to test the various hypotheses that have
emerged from these earlier investigations.
Sample Preparation
Sample preparation for the additional 81
sherd samples was identical to that of the previous
samples (Neff et al. 1996, 1998a, 1999; see also
Glascock 1992), and thus will not be detailed here.
Briefly, the samples were burred with a siliconcarbide drill to remove surface contamination,
rinsed with deionized water, dried, and then ground
to a powder. Activation was accomplished in two
irradiations, and analysis was accomplished with
three gamma-ray counts, which yielded information on 33 chemical elements.
Data Analysis
As with sample preparation, a discussion of the
statistical methods was presented earlier (Neff et
al. 1996, 1998a). Nickel and zirconium were eliminated from the analysis because too many values
were below detection limits. Calcium and strontium were also eliminated because of their presence
in shell temper (see below), thus leaving data from
29 elements available for analysis (see Appendix
I, this article). Raw data were transformed to log10
values for subsequent statistical analysis. Principal components analysis (PCA) calculated from
the variance-covariance matrix was employed to
look for structure in the overall data set by using RQ-mode biplots. Principal components also
were used to determine Mahalanobis-distance
based membership probabilities when group sizes
were relatively small. The additional 81 samples
permitted calculation of membership probabilities
using all 29 elements for the major compositional
groups, which is generally the preferred method
for such calculations. Inspection of bivariate plots
of elemental concentrations also was also used to
assess compositional trends found by PCA.
Many samples from the Red River area were
tempered with varying amounts of shell (see Table
22). Addition of this calcium-rich material to a vessel’s paste has the effect of inflating calcium values
and correspondingly decreasing values for other

elements compared to non-shell-tempered samples.
Steponaitis et al. (1996; see also Steponaitis and
Blackman 1981) developed a mathematical correction for shell-tempered pottery:
e’= 106e
106-2.5c

Where e’ is the corrected concentration of a given
element in parts per million (ppm), e is the measured concentration of that element in ppm, and
c is the calcium concentration in the sample in
ppm. The gravimetric factor 2.5 compensates for
the amount of calcium in calcite (CaCO3). Based
on research conducted at MURR, Neff developed
correction factors for barium, manganese, sodium,
and strontium, additional elements in shell that
may exceed values present in clays. Subsequent
investigations (Cogswell et al. 1998a) confirmed
the usefulness of this mathematical correction. Fortunately, this project provides empirical support for
the mathematical correction: when employed on
the shell-tempered sherds from the Red River area,
the corrected values for other elements closely
match those for non-shell-tempered samples from
the Red River analyzed previously by Steponaitis
et al. (1996) (Figure 68). Accordingly, calcium
and strontium were deleted from the suite of elements employed in this analysis, and the corrected
values of the other elements were used in patternrecognition and statistical analysis.
Preliminary inspection of paste mineralogy by
binocular microscope revealed that clay (grog),
sand, bone, and iron-rich inclusions were also paste
constituents (see Tables 22 and 23). Clay tempering may cause the most obfuscation of clay-source
determinations because of its overall compositional
similarity to the raw clays used to create a vessel
(Neff et al. 1988, 1989). Without analyzing the
composition of clay temper separated by techniques such as electron microprobe (Cogswell et
al. 1998b; Neff et al. 1998b), bulk compositional
data should be accepted with caution. However, the
results obtained so far have considerable ground
truth when compared to geographic and archeological data. This suggests that further corrections
for temper may not be necessary.
Results of the Analyses

compositional groups. Ellipses represent 90 percent confidence levels for group membership. Note that the Hurricane
1 samples fall entirely within the Titus group ellipse.

Hurricane 1 group is closely affiliated with the Titus
group and may be considered to be a sub-group that
is identified on geographic grounds. For example, a
bivariate plot of sodium vs. ytterbium (Figure 70)
shows that, while Hurricane 1 samples are at the
extreme of the Titus group compositional range,
they are nevertheless contained within it. The addition of sherd samples from Red River County has
considerably strengthened the argument that Hurricane 2 pottery comes from the Red River (Neff et
al. 1996, 1999; Neff 1998), an inference previously
based only on apparent similarities between the Hurricane 2 and Great Bend-area samples (Steponaitis
et al. 1996). Hurricane 2 samples are subsumed
within the newly defined Red River compositional
group (see Tables 22 and 23), and the MURR Red
River Group—defined from the sherds from the
TAS investigations—overlaps the NIST Great Bend
Group on most projections of the data.
The separation of Rusk County samples into
two groups, Rusk 1 and Rusk 2 (Neff 1998), is not
supported by analysis of the entire data set. Instead,
a single Rusk County group is currently the most
defensible interpretation of the data.

As suggested in a previous report (Neff 1998),
the Titus, Hurricane 1, and Rusk groups may be
discernible subsets in a compositional continuum of
pottery found between the Sulphur and Sabine river
drainages; the Red River group is compositionally
distinct. A plot of log10 concentrations of the rare
earths europium and samarium (Figure 71) clearly
shows that there is an extremely high correlation
of these elements across the three groups, and that
the groups themselves overlap considerably. These
sub-groups may be apparent because of sampling
strategies. Only sherds from one site each from
Hopkins, Rusk, and Titus counties currently have
been sampled, and no sites from intervening areas
have been sampled. Samples from additional sites
would contribute to resolving the question of
compositional continuity.
Two factors in the northeastern Texas environment may explain the overall similarity of pottery
compositions and the broad trend of rare earth enrichment (see Figure 71) and alkali dilution (see Figure
70) along a roughly northwestern-to-southeastern axis.
First, average rainfall increases slightly from north to
south in the project area, and from west to east (Ar-

compositional groups. Ellipses represent 90 percent confidence levels for group membership. Note the high correlation
of these elements and the overlap of all three compositional groups.

bingast et al. 1973). Increased precipitation may cause
alkali elements such as sodium to be preferentially
leached from raw clays or from pottery deposited in
the ground, thus causing the observed trend of dilution of alkali elements in pottery from north to south
and from west to east. Second, while the Sulphur and
Sabine rivers, which flow through Hopkins, Titus,
and Rusk counties, start in the predominantly marly
deposits of the Taylor formation and work through
predominantly limestones and sandstones in the area
(Stone 1937), the clay deposits in the more northerly
Hopkins and Titus counties (Macon 1979) are characterized by kaolin, a mineral that is generally depleted
in rare earths, while the clays in Rusk County to the
south are characterized by montmorillonite, a mixedlayer clay that generally contains higher amounts of
rare earths. Pottery made from kaolins from Hopkins
and Titus counties would presumably be depleted in
rare earth elements compared to montmorillonite-rich
pottery produced in Rusk County. However, montmorillonite often contains considerable amounts of
alkali elements, including sodium, which conflicts
with the generally lower sodium content of the Rusk
group. Clay samples from northeastern Texas would

help to reconcile these potential explanations for the
observed trends in element concentrations among the
ceramic groups.
The expanded data set has enabled us to refine
further our previous hypotheses concerning the
compositional diversity of ceramics recovered from
northeastern Texas Caddo sites. The compositional
diversity of the pottery recovered from the Oak Hill
Village site is not as great as reported earlier (Neff
1998). Samples from this site are included in the Titus and Rusk County groups, but there are no longer
any Hurricane 1 specimens from the site. The Titus
group is currently somewhat of a misnomer, because
there are now more samples in it from Rusk County
than from Titus County. The name “Titus” for this
group is preserved because all of the assignable Titus
County samples from the Mockingbird site are in the
Titus group while there are Rusk County samples in
both the Titus and Rusk compositional groups. There
are two possible explanations for the fact that there
are two compositional groups at the Oak Hill Village
site. First, it is possible that there was significant
movement of ceramics from Titus County to the Oak
Hill Village site in Middle Caddo period times.

412

Texas Archeological Society

Reciprocal movement of ceramics in the opposite
direction has not yet been found (i.e., there are no
Titus County specimens from the Mockingbird
site in the Rusk County group, but this should not
be surprising in the small INAA sample given that
the Mockingbird site dates 100-150 years later in
time than the Oak Hill Village). Alternatively, the
Titus group could be a generalized compositional
profile from an area encompassing part of the river
catchments for all of the sites (namely the Sulphur
River, Big Cypress Creek, and the Sabine River),
except for those sites along the Red River, which
are a chemically distinct group. This profile for the
Titus group would tend to negate the above inferences of vessel movement.
Compositional diversity is more clearly a result
of movement of ceramics at the Hurricane Hill site
(Neff et al. 1999). There, the assemblage includes
presumed local products belonging to the Hurricane
1 group, imports from the Red River belonging to the
Red River group, and possibly one import (TKP009
on Table 23) from points south and east in the Titus
group. There is also evidence that some ceramics
moved from the Titus County to Rusk County area

north to the Red River valley in Middle Caddo times.
Sherd sample TKP052, a grog-tempered red-slipped
bowl sherd from the Dan Holdeman site (41RR11) in
the Red River valley, is a member of the Rusk County
group (see Table 22).
A plot of the unassigned samples against the
90 percent membership ellipses for the identified
groups (Figure 72) suggests that most of these samples are probably most similar to the Titus group, or
at least to an as yet undetermined resource zone in
the northern part of the study area. Exceptions are
samples EHA070 and EHA082 from the Oak Hill
Village site (see Table 23), which plot in or near the
Rusk County group, and TKP008, an Early Caddo
period curvilinear engraved sherd from the Hurricane Hill site (see Table 23), which plots in the Red
River ellipse. Note that these appraisals are based on
the first two principal components, which subsume
60 percent of the total variance. Membership probabilities based on all 29 elements are <1 percent for
any of the unassigned samples to belong to either
the Titus or Red River groups (see Table 23).
One of the major research questions for this
project is whether associations exist between vessel

Figure 72. Bivariate plot of unassigned northeastern Texas samples against compositional groups using principal
components 1 and 2 from the variance/covariance matrix. Ellipses represent 90 percent confidence levels for group
membership. Note that most of the unassigned samples cluster near the Titus group.

Perttula—The Archeology of the Roitsch Site (41RR16) 413
types, forms, or decorative motifs and compositional
groups. While recognizing that such associations are
best made by someone more familiar with the pottery
in the data set (see Perttula 1999, 2002), at present
we have insufficient information to address this
question adequately. The general decorative motifs
of engraving, incising, and punctation are present in
all compositional groups. Of the unassigned pottery
samples, three have type designations that are not
shared with other grouped samples. One of these
samples, TKP054 (Pennington Punctated-Incised) is
from Middle Caddo period contexts in Block VI in the
village area at the Roitsch site. The other two, TKP024
(Maxey Noded Redware) and TKP075 (Holly/
Hickory Engraved) are from Middle Caddo contexts
at the Hurricane Hill and Fasken sites, respectively
(see Perttula 1999; Prikryl, this volume).
Another of the interesting findings from this
analysis concerns the five ceramic pipe fragments
from the Oak Hill Village site. Only one (EHA084)
can be assigned to a compositional group, in this
case to the Titus/Rusk County sub-group. The four
unassigned samples suggest that these pipes were
brought to the Oak Hill Village from regions currently unknown, and further suggests that ceramic
pipes may have been a highly mobile commodity. These pipe samples have no unusual temper
characteristics (see Table 23) that would tend to
separate them from the analyzed pottery.
Concerning the third research question, currently there is no indication that pottery production
or raw material exploitation varied between the
Early and Late Caddo periods. Instead, evidence
suggests that site occupants exploited locally available clays regardless of the age of the respective
occupations by Caddo peoples. We must point out,
however, that specific time placement is lacking for
the submitted ceramic samples from the Oak Hill
Village site (see Table 23), although it is known
that the site was occupied from ca. A.D. 1150-1400
(Rogers and Perttula 2004). Furthermore, no clay
source samples have been analyzed that could
identify production areas.
Suggestions for Further Research
All of the results achieved to date are based exclusively on archeological samples. A raw materials survey focusing on available clay sources in the
research area could provide important information
on a variety of questions, such as whether there is
a climatological or geological explanation for the

chemical variability observed in the Titus Group
pottery. This survey also would more effectively
pinpoint likely clay resource areas for northeastern Texas pottery, and address whether there is a
compositional continuum in the northeastern Texas
clays, as suggested by this analysis.
We should make clear that while additional samples have allowed us to refine our interpretations,
we are not at the point of sampling to redundancy
needed to address the research goals proposed for
this project. Therefore, additional Caddo ceramic
samples from dated contexts at additional sites in
Hopkins, Rusk, Titus, and neighboring counties
clearly would help to address these goals.

ANALYSIS OF HUMAN REMAINS
FROM THE ARNOLD ROITSCH
SITE (41RR16)
Sharon McCormick Derrick, Gail R. Colby,
and D. Gentry Steele
INTRODUCTION
This study is based on the analysis of human
remains recovered from the Arnold Roitsch site
(41RR16, also known previously as the Sam
Kaufman site) by participants in the 1991 and
1992 Texas Archeological Society (TAS) Summer
Field Schools. The Roitsch site, located in northern
Red River County near Manchester, Texas, is
the remains of a Caddo ceremonial center and
several dispersed villages that were occupied from
approximately A.D. 1050-1730 (Skinner et al.
1969; Bruseth 1998; see also radiocarbon analyses
performed by the University of Texas Radiocarbon
Laboratory, Appendix X, this article). Thirteen
burials containing 20 individuals (five adult males,
seven adult females, two adults of indeterminate
sex, and six subadults) were recovered through
excavation; additional human bone from the
surface was also collected (Table 24 and Figures 73
and 74; see also Appendix II, this article). Since the

and is not included in the minimum number of

Excavation of the Red River drainage system
has produced a large number of Caddo mortuary
components and individual sets of human remains
(Rose and Burnett 1990). The Bob Williams site

(one part of the 41RR16 site complex), the Roden
site (34Mc-215), and the Sam Kaufman site
(41RR16, renamed the Roitsch site) form a related
archeological complex in the Red River drainage area on the border of Texas and Oklahoma.
Previously recovered skeletal samples from this
complex, dating broadly to ca. A.D. 1300-1700,
were described by Butler (1969), Loveland (1980,
1994a), Loveland and Bass (1983), and Rose et al.

(1981). Human remains recovered from two other
nearby sites that are also closely related in time,
the Rowland Clark (41RR77) and Dan Holdeman
(41RR11) sites, were described by Loveland (1986,
1994b). Additionally, Buikstra and Fowler (1975)
compared the human remains and burial program
from another roughly contemporaneous (A.D.
1300) Red River drainage site, Bentsen-Clark
(41RR41), with that of the Sam Kaufman site.
This study provides detailed descriptions

of the 20 individuals recovered from the Caddo
burials at the Roitsch site in 1991 and 1992 (see
Appendix II, this article), and synthesizes the
data retrieved from this sample with the demographic, pathologic, metric, and non-metric data
reported for the previously recovered samples
from the Roitsch-Williams-Roden complex, the
Clark and Holdeman sites, and the Bentsen-Clark
site. Although much of the comparative data are
from published reports (Buikstra and Fowler 1975;

Perttula—The Archeology of the Roitsch Site (41RR16) 417
Butler 1969; Loveland 1980, 1986; Loveland and
Bass 1983; Rose et al. 1981), the human remains
recovered in the 1968 excavation of the Roitsch
site (see Skinner et al. 1969; referred to in this
study under the original name of the site, Sam
Kaufman, in order to differentiate between it and
the subsequently excavated material) were also
examined by the authors.
Previous bioarcheological studies of Caddo
peoples were often impeded by a lack of informational synthesis, and for many years few
long-term, problem-oriented studies were produced (Loveland and Bass 1983; Rose 1984; see
also Powell 1997). Currently, several synthetic
works are available that draw information together from various sites, such as those by Burnett
(1988, 1989, 1993), Harmon and Rose (1989),
Loveland (1980, 1986, 1994a), Perttula (1992),
Rose and Burnett (1990), Rose et al. (1998), Story
(1990a), Thurmond (1985), and Tine and Tieszen
(1994). Consequently, a clearer picture of prehistoric Caddo peoples has emerged in terms of their
settlement and mortuary patterns, demography,
genetic affi nity, nutrition, and morbidity and
mortality rates. With the addition of the 1991 and
1992 Roitsch samples, the number of described
individuals from the Roitsch-Williams-Roden
complex is now close to 300. This is a significant
pool of data concerning the Caddo peoples that
lived in the Red River drainage area.

METHODOLOGY
The skeletal materials from the Roitsch site
were still encased in protective soil when received
in the Physical Anthropology Laboratory of Texas
A&M University. All elements were cleaned and
each individual was arranged in anatomical position for inventory and analysis (see Appendix III,
this article). The crania and long bones were partially reconstructed with polyvinyl acetate (PVA)
glue and standard measurements of the bones were
taken as defined by Steele and Bramblett (1988) (see
Appendix IV, this article). When possible, sex was
determined for adults and older adolescents using
metric and visual analysis of the pelvic bones and
cranium. Femoral head diameter and regression formulae specific to calcaneus and talus measurements
were also used as supporting evidence (Steele and
Bramblett 1988) (Table 25). Sex determination for
young subadults was not attempted.
The age of the adults was estimated from evaluation of auricular surface morphology (Lovejoy et
al. 1985), pubic symphysis morphology (Suchey
et al. 1988a, 1988b), tooth eruption and wear, and
arthritic changes. Estimation of subadult age was
performed using tooth eruption and wear (Steele
and Bramblett 1988; Ubelaker 1978), and the
stage of epiphyseal fusion (Steele and Bramblett
1988). Adult stature estimation was calculated
using regression formulae specific to femoral

Steele and Bramblett 1988; Tieszen 1994). After
death, the collagen content begins to decrease. The
amount of collagen that is left in an archeological
skeletal sample varies with time and environmental
conditions. Taphonomic processes such as moisture,
heat, and faunal and floral activity can all destroy
collagen (Berger et al. 1964). When collagen is
poorly preserved, the small amounts retrieved
during analysis may be contaminated (Ambrose
and Norr 1992). Therefore, the University of Texas
Radiocarbon Laboratory opted to use bioapatite
(bone apatite) for the isotope.

The use of bioapatite causes some difficulties
in data interpretation. One problem with using
bioapatite data is the lack of comparative value
with collagen isotope data from other site samples.
The comparison is not strictly accurate because of
the inherent differences between bioapatite carbon
values and collagen carbon values (Ericson et
al. 1989). However, a more serious drawback to
using bioapatite lies in the possible exchange of
carbonate with the environment. When carbonate
from bioapatite comes into contact with soil and
groundwater it can readily be exchanged with

radioactively dead carbonate (limestone). If this
exchange has occurred, spurious isotope readings
can result (Berger et al. 1964; Boutton et al. 1984;
Schoeninger and De Niro 1982). Fortunately, this
does not appear to be the case with the Roitsch
results as the radiocarbon dates and nutritional
isotope readings are congruent with the cultural
evidence.

POSTMORTEM CONDITIONS
Taphonomic processes had an obvious effect
on the preservation of much of the bone from the
Roitsch skeletal sample. Many of the elements
were fragmented or missing, due at least in part
to erosion, weathering and sun exposure, adverse
(wet) excavation conditions, and disturbance of
the burials by pothunting activity, rodent activity,
and encroachment of plant roots. As mentioned
above, the bone collagen was not well preserved,
probably due to heat and water exposure. Pothunter

destruction was evident in the presence of several
“pokey rod holes” in crania and vertebrae and
the displacement or removal of skeletal elements
before excavation. Several teeth were damaged by
an unidentified erosional process. Black, spidery
lines were etched into some of the bones. This
etching phenomenon, also observed in skeletal
samples from Cooper Lake Reservoir, Texas, and
Galveston County, Texas, may have been caused
by plant residues (Colby et al. 1992; Derrick and
Steele 1993).

RADIOCARBON DATING RESULTS
All of the Roitsch sample remains (Burials
24-36, and surface collection), with the exception
of Burial 35, were recovered from Block VII of
the site (the Terrace area). These Block VII burials
(with the exception of Burials 24 and 31) have been
dated to approximately A.D. 1500-1700 in the late
McCurtain phase, based on the presence of Hudson
Engraved, Simms Engraved, and Keno Trailed ceramic vessel grave goods (see Perttula, this article).
Burial 24 lacked diagnostic grave goods other than
shell-tempered ceramics and was thus radiocarbon
dated (see results below). Burial 31 was assigned
an early historic date of ca. A.D. 1650-1700/1730
from cultural evidence, namely the presence of a
European glass trade bead (Timothy K. Perttula,
1996 personal communication) in the burial fill.
Burial 35, intrusive into the East mound, was dated
to the early McCurtain phase on the basis of grave
goods and an uncalibrated radiocarbon date of A.D.
1245 + 45 (the calibrated 1-sigma age range is AD
1275-1383) obtained from a level below the burial
(William A. Martin, 1996 personal communication). In a continuing effort to securely date both
the Block VII cemetery and the construction of
the East mound, four individuals (two recovered
in the 1968 excavation and two, Burials 24 and
35, recovered in 1991) were selected for additional
radiocarbon analysis.
According to the Sam Kaufman site report from
the 1968 excavation (Skinner et al. 1969), two individual burials were removed from the river bank
west of the West mound, and one individual burial
was exposed in a backhoe trench bisecting the West
mound. Five individual burials were recovered in
the area of the East mound, as well as remains from
a multiple burial containing four individuals, and a
shaft burial containing 11 individuals. This skeletal

Perttula—The Archeology of the Roitsch Site (41RR16) 421
sample, analyzed by Butler (1969), was loaned to
the Physical Anthropology Laboratory at Texas
A&M University for study and two individuals,
Burials 15 and 17 were selected for isotope analysis
based on their location in the shaft burial. After the
isotope analysis had been performed, an ongoing
study of the Sam Kaufman human remains revealed
that due to mixing of unmarked skeletal elements
at some point since their excavation, some of the
remains assigned to those burial numbers probably
belonged to other individuals. Therefore, it is impossible to say with conviction that the isotope results
for Burials 15 and 17 represent discrete individuals
from the shaft burial. In all likelihood, however,
based on an assessment of the mixed elements, the
results do represent individuals from the shaft burial
in the East mound.
The results of the radiocarbon dating analysis
placed the age of Burial 24 (from the 1991 excavation in the Block VII or Terrace area cemetery) at
cal AD 1280-1396. The presence of shell-tempered
ceramics in the burial fill suggests that this burial
dates early in the McCurtain phase. The East mound
individuals from the 1968 excavation and Burial 35
from the 1991 excavation date to approximately
A.D. 1450-1500, as was expected from recovered
cultural evidence and the uncorrected radiocarbon
date of A.D. 1245 obtained from below Burial 35
(James E. Bruseth, 1996 personal communication;
University of Texas Radiocarbon Laboratory).

NUTRITIONAL AND ISOTOPE
ANALYSIS
Dietary and nutritional information provided
by nondestructive examination of the human bone
and teeth (Figure 75) in this study has been supplemented by nutritional isotope analysis. The same
four individuals that were radiocarbon-dated (the
two Sam Kaufman individuals and Burials 24 and
35 from the 1991 Roitsch excavation) were also
analyzed for delta 13C values using bone apatite.
Plants utilizing the C3 photosynthetic pathway,
such as grasses, have δ 13C values that average
between -26.0 ‰ and -28 ‰, while plants utilizing
the C4 photosynthetic pathway, such as corn, have
average δ 13C values ranging between -12.5 ‰ and
-14.0 ‰ (Boutton et al. 1984; Tieszen 1994). It is
possible that the relative importance of corn in the
diet of individuals living in an environment otherwise dominated by C3 plants, as was the Red River

drainage area, can be estimated by analysis of δ 13C
values. However, as a cautionary note, the range of
δ 13C values can be affected by many factors, such
as recycling respired CO2, increased water stress,
increased osmotic stress, and the addition of marine
foods in the diet (Chisholm 1989; Tieszen 1994).
Even considering these factors, humans consuming
a significant amount of both corn and/or the flesh
of animals eating C4 plants would be expected to
have richer δ 13C values than those consuming less
of these dietary components.
Chisholm (1989) states that a consumer eating
both C3 and C4 species should produce a bone collagen δ 13C value between -21.5 ‰ and -7.5 ‰.
However, bioapatite values on the whole for δ 13C
tend to be larger than collagen values. Ericson et al.
(1989) describe bioapatite δ 13C values from -8.5
‰ to -3.7 ‰ as representative of a 40-60 percent
proportion of C4 plants in the diet of prehistoric
peoples in the Viru Valley, Peru.
The four bone apatite δ 13C values obtained
for the Sam Kaufman and Roitsch individuals were
quite uniform, ranging from -8.2 ‰ to -8.0 ‰
(Sam Kaufman individuals = -8.2 and -8.0, Roitsch
Burial 24 = -8.2, Burial 35 = - 8.0). These results
indicate that a large proportion of the diet of these
individuals came from C4 plants, herbivores
consuming C4 plants, a combination of these
elements, or a marine diet. A likely conclusion,
considering the high caries rate in this skeletal
sample (described below), the inland location of
the Roitsch site, and past archeological subsistence
evidence from Caddo sites (Story 1990a; Perttula
1996) is that the inhabitants of the Roitsch site
were eating corn as a staple of their diet.
Stable isotope values may also be used to
distinguish variability in diet among members of
a single population, such as those generated by
differential access to food (Schurr 1992). The two
Sam Kaufman individuals may have been associated with high status grave goods as well as an
elaborate burial treatment (Skinner et al. 1969).
Unfortunately, due to the mixing of skeletal elements described above, these isotope readings
cannot be firmly associated with the high status
burials. The Roitsch Burials 24 and 35 are male
and female respectively, both in their 30s at the
time of death. The lack of significant differences
in the δ 13C values for all four individuals is interesting, especially in light of the fact that Burial
24 dated 200 years earlier and was excavated from
a separate cemetery than the East Mound graves.

Further testing of other individuals and analysis of
additional isotopes would be necessary in order to
produce more definitive answers to the question of
status differences in diet at this site.

DEMOGRAPHY AND STATURE
The majority of individuals in the Roitsch sample are female, comprising 58 percent (n=12) of

the adults for whom sex was assessed (see Figures
73 and 74). A review of the female to male ratios
from the Bob Williams, Roden, Sam Kaufman,
Rowland Clark, and Holdeman excavations reveals
the presence of a higher proportion of females at
all but the Holdeman site (see Figure 73). Females
comprise 29-61 percent of these skeletal samples
(Butler 1969; Loveland 1986; Buikstra and Fowler
1975; Loveland and Bass 1983; Rose et al. 1981).
The smallest percentage of females (29 percent) is

Perttula—The Archeology of the Roitsch Site (41RR16) 423
reported from the Holdeman site, where there are
only four females identified out of the 14 adults for
whom sex can be determined. The Bentsen-Clark
sample is not compared here due to the fragmentary
nature of the remains.
There are seven female adults present in the
Roitsch sample, ranging in age from young adult to
59-60 years; five male adults, ranging from young
adult to 55 years; two adults of indeterminate sex;
and six subadults ranging from neonate to young
adolescent (see Table 24 and Figure 73, also Appendix II, this article). The age composition of
this sample is young: 38 percent of the individuals
died between the ages of 17 and 40 years (n=13;
excluding individuals for whom age was not assessed). Only 23 percent (n=13) were older than
40 years at death. Thirty percent (n=20) of the
sample are subadults (see Figure 74), a proportion
that is similar to those found in the Bob Williams
(28 percent), Roden (22 percent), Rowland Clark
(28 percent), and Holdeman (31 percent) samples
(see Figure 74).
Children under the age of five years comprise 21
percent of the Roitsch sample (n=19; the Burial 28
subadult could not be assessed for age). In a survey
of 18 Caddo sites, including previous data from the
Red River area, Rose (1984) reports a mean of only
9.8 percent for this age category, but with a range
of 0-37.5 percent. The percentage of children under
five years of age recovered from the Bob Williams
(13.3 percent), Roden (30.8 percent), Rowland Clark
(33 percent), and Holdeman sites (50 percent) varies greatly (Loveland 1986; Rose 1984). The Sam
Kaufman and Bentsen-Clark samples contained no
children under five years of age.
Stature was estimated for nine individuals from
the Roitsch sample: three males, five females, and
one probable female (see Tables 24 and 26). Male
stature ranges from 160-166 cm (mean=163.82
cm) and female stature ranges from 153-161 cm
(mean=158.47 cm). These stature estimates are
a bit shorter than those reported by Loveland
(1986) for the Rowland Clark and Holdeman
samples (Rowland Clark male mean=170.48 cm;
female mean=161.79 cm; and Holdeman male
mean=166.25 cm; female single individual=169.99
cm) and the males of the Bob Williams sample (male
mean=168.91 cm; female mean=156.33 cm). The
Roitsch males are also a bit shorter than the males
from the Sam Kaufman sample (mean=167.49
cm) as reported by Butler (1969), but the Roitsch
females are taller (Kaufman mean=157.82 cm).

Some of the discrepancy in height between
the samples resulted from the use of different
stature regression formulae by the analysts. The
Genoves (1967) formulae, developed from a
Mesoamerican sample, were used for the Roitsch
stature estimations calculated from femur length,
rather than those of Trotter and Gleser (1952), the
formulae used for most of the other site stature
estimations. A cross-check using the Trotter and
Gleser formulae produced a male stature range of
162-168 cm (mean=165.99 cm) and a female range
of 159-163 cm (mean=160.75 cm) for estimations
calculated from femur length. However, all of
the stature estimates from these Red River sites
are within a comparable range. Conversely, the
combined mean stature of individuals designated as
“Caddoan” from the Cooper Lake Reservoir area,
as reported by Westbury (1978) and Derrick and
Steele (1993), are quite a bit taller (mean=178.08
cm for males and 166.37 cm for females).

MEDICAL DISORDERS
Degenerative Joint Disease
The most common disorder observed in the
current sample, with the exception of dental caries, was degenerative joint disease manifested as
vertebral osteophytosis and osteoarthritis of the
weight-bearing joints. Degenerative joint disease
(DJD) is represented in 43 percent (n=14) of the
Roitsch adults (Figure 76). Four vertebrae from a
middle-aged male (Burial 34A) provide an example
of severe degenerative joint disease of the lumbar
vertebrae with deterioration of the articular surfaces of the vertebral bodies and resultant Schmorl’s
nodes (depressed lesions of the vertebral centrum
end plates). The Roitsch data for DJD and vertebral
osteophytosis are quite comparable with those from
the other Red River Caddo sites. Vertebral osteophytosis is present in 36 percent of the individuals
recovered at the Bob Williams site and 40.9 percent
of the sample recovered from the Roden site (Loveland and Bass 1983; Rose et al. 1981; see Loveland
[1994a] for a comprehensive discussion of vertebral
degenerative joint disease in the Bob Williams burial
population). Degenerative joint disease is the most
common pathological condition observed in the Sam
Kaufman sample (Butler 1969).
Temporomandibular (TMJ) DJD can be indicative of habitual use of the anterior dentition as

a tool in fiber processing or as a third hand (Kennedy 1989:138; Wilson 1994:144). Analysis of the
Roitsch sample found four adults affected with
slight to moderate temporomandibular joint DJD,
mainly evidenced as porosity and pitting in the glenoid fossa. This represents 50 percent of the scoreable individuals (n=8), 33.3 percent of the adults
(n=12), and 20 percent of the total sample (n=20). A
combined sample of both Roitsch and Sam Kaufman
has a total of 11 individuals with slight to moderate

temporomandibular DJD representing 32.4 percent
of the adults (n=34) and 22 percent of the total
population (n=50) (see Table 27). Interestingly, of
the 11 affected individuals, only two were female,
which is counter to the modern clinical ratios of one
affected male for every four affected females (Gerschman and Reade 1988:242). Only one case of TMJ
DJD each was reported for the Bob Williams (male
individual) and Holdeman (unknown sex) samples
(Loveland 1986; Loveland and Bass 1983).

Perttula—The Archeology of the Roitsch Site (41RR16) 425
These data could indicate possible effects of
cranial modeling on occlusion, differential diet,
or more probably, a sexual division of labor with
males pursuing activities requiring the use of the
anterior dentition. Wilson (1994) suggested that
females at the Sanders site, a Middle Caddo period
site on the Red River in Lamar County, Texas,
had a less stressful life overall and were probably
accorded a higher status than males. The temporomandibular data from the combined sample of
Roitsch and Sam Kaufman could lend credence to
this interpretation. An analysis of this combined
sample with a hunter-gathering sample from Blue
Bayou (41VT94), a coastal population from Victoria County, Texas (Huebner and Comuzzie 1992),
was done to evaluate differences in dental health
from the two different subsistence modes (Colby
n.d.). An even distribution of temporomandibular
DJD was found in the Blue Bayou sample—two
affected males and two affected females—representing 8.2 percent of the total population (n=49)
and 10.1 percent of the adults (n=34) (see Table
27). The more even distribution seen in these
hunter-gatherers could be the result of a more
egalitarian diet and lifeway.
Posterior antemortem tooth loss (AMTL) has
also been correlated with the presence of temporomandibular joint disease in modern clinical
studies (Bergman and Hanson 1979). An analysis
of a Medieval Nubian population from the Kuluhnarti site in Northern Sudan noted a significant
correlation (p <0.01) between long term posterior tooth loss represented by resorbed sockets
and temporomandibular DJD (Sheridan et al.
1991:204). In the analysis of the combined Caddo
sample from the Red River, Colby (n.d.) reported
high first molar AMTL (26 out of 69 observable
sockets), which is also probably contributing to
the observed temporomandibular DJD in this
combined sample. Supporting this conclusion is
the relatively low incidence of first molar AMTL
in the Blue Bayou sample, as only a total of two
teeth were lost, and the relatively low incidence
of temporomandibular DJD.
Osteoarthritis of the weight-bearing joints is
present in 43 percent of the Roitsch sample adults,
but only 11 percent of the Bob Williams sample
and 12.5 percent of the Roden sample (Loveland
and Bass 1983; Rose et al. 1981). Although both
DJD and osteoarthritis were observed in the
Bentsen-Clark, Rowland Clark, and Holdeman
(DJD only) samples, fragmentation of the remains

and poor representation of vertebrae hamper
further comparisons of the skeletal data.
Infection
Signs of infection were observed in 50 percent
of the Caddo individuals in the Roitsch sample
(n=20), defined as either systemic infection or localized bone infection (see Figure 76). A 40 percent
infection rate was recorded among subadults (n=5;
Burial 26B, represented by one tooth, was not
included in this figure). Otitis media, or ear infection, is represented by an infected temporal bone
from the Burial 34B infant. Five adult individuals
(Burials 24, 28, 30, 31, and 35) exhibit healed
circular depressions, with evidence of previous
bone infection located in the supra-inion area of
the occipital bone. The Burial 36 infant exhibits a
perforated lesion in the same area of the occipital,
and this lesion, measuring 25 x 22 mm in diameter,
was active at the time of death (photographs of
these signs of infection in the Roitsch site skeletal
remains are on file at Texas A&M University).
The incidence of infection varies in the other
Roitsch-Bob Williams-Roden complex sites. There
is an adult infection rate of 19.2 percent, and a
77.8 percent infection rate among subadults in the
Roden sample, with a combined rate of 64 percent
(Rose et al. 1981). The most common infectious
condition is described as generalized periostitis.
Periostitis was observed in only 10 percent (n=20)
of the Roitsch sample, and in both cases this infection was limited to the ribs. Although the infection
rate was not specified for the Bob Williams site,
17 tibiae with periostitis were recorded (Loveland
and Bass 1983). Loveland (1994a) reported a 7.7
percent infection rate in pooled data from the fragmentary Rowland Clark and Holdeman samples,
and Buikstra and Fowler (1975) described superficial remodeling of long bones in the Bentsen-Clark
sample. No infectious conditions were noted by
Butler (1969) for the Sam Kaufman sample, except
for the presence of dental abscesses.
Nutritional and Developmental Disorders
A high rate of porotic hyperostosis (33.3
percent) was observed in the Roden site sample
(Rose et al. 1981). There is only a single case of
porotic hyperostosis present in the Roitsch sample
(5 percent), which compares favorably with a rate
of 11.5 percent from the Holdeman sample, 2.6

426

Texas Archeological Society

percent from the Rowland Clark sample, and a 9
percent rate observed in the Bob Williams sample
(Loveland 1986; Loveland and Bass 1983). Six
of the cases from the Bob Williams sample were
observed as cribra orbitalia in subadults (Loveland
and Bass 1983).
Developmental disorders observed in the
Roitsch sample include osteochondritis dissecans,
namely the formation of a loose cartilaginous body
that calcifies and remains as a dead bone fragment,
present on the superior articular facet of the axis
from a young male, one malformed proximal phalanx of the foot, two incidences of fused vertebrae,
several enamel hypoplasias, and two cases of slight
scoliosis. Congenital or developmental abnormalities of a similar nature were observed in the Bob
Williams sample (Loveland and Bass 1983). These
disorders included three cases of fused vertebrae,
one case of the atlas fused to the occipital, and
several neural arch defects in the lumbar and sacral
vertebrae. Four Holdeman skeletons exhibited
developmental abnormalities in the form of one
fibrous cortical defect, one fibrous dysplasia, and
two enamel hypoplasias (Loveland 1986).
Trauma
Six cases of local trauma were noted in the
Roitsch sample, excluding Schmorl’s nodes.
Schmorl’s nodes were not categorized as trauma
in this analysis, although they can be the result of
stress trauma to the back.
Evidence of trauma includes: one healed skull
fracture, one damaged tooth, evidence of damage
to one shoulder joint, slight damage to one patella,
and two postcranial fractures. The postcranial fracture rate for the sample is 10 percent, compared
with an 8 percent postcranial fracture rate in the
Bob Williams sample, and a norm of 2.2 percent
for Texas archeological sites in general (Goldstein
1957; Loveland and Bass 1983). Other results of
trauma in the Bob Williams sample were three
skull fractures and two broken noses (Loveland and
Bass 1983). Loveland (1986) reports three cases of
traumatic injury for the Clark and Holdeman sites
(excluding Schmorl’s nodes).
Dental Disorders
Dental caries are exceedingly prevalent in this
sample. All of the adults with preserved dentition
had at least one caries, with a mean of 5.9 caries

per person (using n=20 or the total population; see
Figure 75). When taking into consideration only
scoreable individuals (individuals with at least
one scoreable tooth present), the caries rate rises
to 7.38 caries per person (see Table 28). Tooth loss
occurred in at least six (60 percent) of the adults,
while abscesses also occurred in six (60 percent)
of the adults and can be seen in two subadults.
The overall caries rate is 64 percent. These results
are high compared with the Sam Kaufman (16.2
percent), Roden (23.3 percent), Bob Williams
(15.3 percent), Bentsen-Clark (14.1 percent), and
Rowland Clark (5.6 percent) sites (Butler 1969;
Loveland 1986).
In a reanalysis of the Sam Kaufman material
(Colby 1995, 1997), the overall caries rate was
found to be 56 percent, namely 150 caries in a total
of 268 teeth, with 5.0 caries per person (n=30),
and 6.52 caries per scoreable individual (n=23)
(see Table 28). Combining the Roitsch and Sam
Kaufman material shows that all classes of teeth
were affected by caries, although as expected, the
majority are located in the molars (59 percent) (see
Table 29). The high antemortem tooth loss (AMTL)
of first molars in this combined Caddo sample
(26 out of 69 observable sockets) (Colby n.d.),
probably as a result of caries-induced abscesses,
would indicate that the number of molars affected
was actually greater than the 59 percent seen here.
Pain from caries and tooth loss must have affected
the health and quality of life of many of the Caddo
individuals living at the Roitsch site (a photograph
of these dental disorders is on file at the Department of Anthropology at Texas A&M University).
However, actual tooth wear is moderate to light
(see Table 30 and Appendix V, this article).
The caries rate from the Roitsch sample also
appears to be somewhat higher than that of other
Caddo archeological area samples (see Figure 75),
and considerably higher than that of the earlier
Woodland period Fourche Maline peoples (Rose
and Marks 1985). The increase in caries and the
concomitant reduction of tooth wear seen in the
Roitsch and Kaufman samples may have been a
product of small sample size, increasing dependence on corn agriculture, or the use of wooden
mortars and pestles when grinding corn. Powell and Rogers (1980) suggest that because the
wooden surfaces of these tools expel less grit into
the ground corn, people using wooden grinding
implements should have reduced tooth wear and increased caries. The teeth, although protected from

Perttula—The Archeology of the Roitsch Site (41RR16) 427
extreme wear, are not naturally cleansed by the
smoother vegetable materials. As a consequence,
there is more opportunity for sticky carbohydrates
to remain in tooth fissures, causing carious lesions
(Powell and Rogers 1980).
Wear patterns can also be indicative of cultural
practices such as the extra-dietary use of the teeth,
as well as in determining subsistence patterns and
overall dental health (Colby n.d.; Molnar 1971;
Ubelaker 1994). A higher degree of wear on the
anterior dentition (canines and incisors) as opposed
to the posterior dentition (molars and premolars) has
been correlated with use of the teeth as tools. This
has been reported in a study of precontact Omaha
dentitions in Nebraska; females in this sample had
pronounced anterior wear that was possibly related
to processing hides by chewing to soften them
(Reinhard et al. 1994:71). The combined dental
sample from the Roitsch and Kaufman sites has first
incisor to first molar ratios indicative of more anterior
wear (see Table 30), as all three ratios (UIl/UM1,
LI1/LM1, and I1/M1) are above 1.0, corresponding
to even wear. This can be interpreted to mean that
these Caddo peoples were using their teeth as tools
to aid in material processing, or as a third hand to
help grasp something. Because of the high incidence
of first molar AMTL, this interpretation could be
anomalous and simply a reflection of missing data.
If these teeth were present, they might present higher

wear stages than the molars scored, as wear and
caries are both age-progressive conditions.
Abscesses are the penultimate result of wear
and caries; the final stage of both is antemortem
tooth loss. In order to fully understand the dental
health of a population, all conditions and their
causes must be examined, and for abscesses this
means determining the basal cause of the pulpitis
(infection of the pulp cavity) that results in the
abscess. The Roitsch site had eight individuals with
22 abscesses, four males with 11 abscesses, three
females with 10 abscesses, and one indeterminate
individual with a single abscess. Interestingly,
abscesses are concentrated in the younger portion
of this sample with one individual each in the
late child and adolescent/juvenile age categories
having been affected (Table 31). Five abscesses
were noted in young adults (63 percent), with
only a single older adult being affected. Again
the high posterior AMTL, also age progressive,
as a result of abscesses, tends to skew the data
towards the younger segment of the population.
Note that more abscesses were found in this sample
than total individuals in the sample. There is no
statistical difference in the number of abscesses
or the number of individuals affected between
the sexes (Table 32). The combined sample of 23
individuals among the Roitsch and Sam Kaufman
remains is similar to what has been found at the

Roitsch site, and there are no
statistical differences between the
number of affected individuals and
the number of abscesses in males
or females (see Table 32).
Abscess etiology in this sample follows what has already been
seen, in that caries are the predominate cause of abscesses for these
Caddo agriculturalists. Of the 22
abscesses noted, 13 (59 percent)
were the result of caries breeching the pulp cavity and providing
a hospitable environment for the
commensal bacteria of the oral
cavity to proliferate (Figure 77).
No abscesses can be attributed to
either wear or trauma; one abscess
has an etiology of food impaction;
and the remaining eight are of
indeterminate origin (36 percent).

once the primary dentin has been exposed to wear
(Moss-Salentijn and Hendricks-Klyvert 1985). Reactive or reparative dentin deposition on the interior surface (pulpal cavity) of the dentin closes off
the dentin tubules exposed to some external insult
(Moss-Salentijn and Hendricks-Klyvert 1985). In
combination, these would provide some protection
to the pulp cavity, delaying or possibly averting the
advent of pulpitis (Figure 78). Only the deposition
of reactive dentin is possible in response to caries, whereas both secondary and reactive dentin
are formed as a tooth is subjected to wear. When
a tooth is exposed to gradual, continued wear, it
can compensate and delay exposure of the pulp
cavity, while caries is a decay process, that unless
treated, will continue. Thus, the pulp cavity is exposed more quickly when a caries is present than
during the gradual process of wear, and an abscess
will occur. As has been shown in both the Roitsch
sample alone and with the combined Roitsch and
Kaufman sample, populations with a high caries
rate can be expected to have a corresponding high
abscess rate.

NON-METRIC TRAITS

summary comparison with the Sam Kaufman and
Bob Williams samples are also reported, along
with a non-metric trait summary for well-preserved
skulls (see Appendix VI, this article). Unfortunately, a synthesis of non-metric trait information
from the Bentsen-Clark, Roden, Rowland Clark,
and Holdeman samples was not possible due to
the lack of reported data. However, Buikstra and
Fowler (1975) reported that the Bentsen-Clark
sample was similar to the Sam Kaufman sample
in the occurrence of non-metric traits.

CRANIAL MODELING
Cranial modeling is the custom of intentionally shaping the infant head, often referred to as
artificial cranial deformation or modification. The
human cranium is usually shaped at birth by stress
placed on the head during delivery. During postnatal growth, the head takes on a natural shape as a
result of genetic instructions, structural relationship
to the attached face and neck, and environmental
influences (Rogers 1975). Cranial modeling occurs
when the infant cranium is permanently molded
into an unnatural but desired shape.
Tabular fronto-parallelo-occipital and fronto-vertico-occipital modeling (cf. Neumann 1942)
have both been described in Caddo skeletal samples
(Bennett 1961; Loveland 1980). These styles of
modeling were produced by placing a board on the
forehead of the infant while the back of the head
was held stationary on a cradleboard (Loveland

Skeletal non-metric variation was recorded for
this sample using the Texas A&M University Physical Anthropology Laboratory Data Form (Colby
et al. n.d.). Although individual size variation and
environmental factors may influence the expression of non-metric (discrete) traits (Konigsberg et
al. 1993; Snyder Winder 1981),
the heritability of these traits
has been documented (Heuser
and De Stefano 1989; Ossenberg 1976, 1977, 1986; Snyder
Winder 1981), underscoring
the importance of recording
non-metric traits during skeletal analysis. A comprehensive
record of the presence/absence
and type variables of non-metric
traits for the Roitsch sample will
enable future investigation into
the biological affinity of these
Caddo people. The non-metric
data for the Roitsch sample are
summarized by burial number in
Appendix VI (this article). Sex

1980). To prevent changes to the shape of the neck,
a pad was placed at the base of the occipital, or the
back of the head was placed into a shallow hole in
the cradleboard (Loveland 1980). The objective
appeared to be a parallel shaping of the frontal and
the occipital areas of the head (Neumann 1942).
Additional forms of these styles, produced by wrapping the head, have also been reported (Derrick et
al. 1995; Derrick and Wilson 1997).
Tabularly modeled crania are present in the
Roitsch site sample. Five individuals (Burials 24,
28, 31, 35, and 36) were modeled in the parallelo-fronto-occipital style (photographs of examples
of cranial modeling in the Roitsch skeletal remains
are on file at the Department of Anthropology,
Texas A&M University; see also Table 24). The
well-preserved crania of Burials 31 and 35 appear
long and flat, with a quickly sloping forehead, bulging parietals, and a flattened occipital. Although the
mandible of Burial 27B has large gonial angles
and a jutting chin, and the bicondylar breadth appears large (all features that can be indicative of
cranial modeling), the presence of modeling cannot be assessed without a more complete cranium
(e.g., Chevrud and Midkiff 1992; Herring 1993).
Seven adult crania (Burials 5, 7, 11, 13, 15, 16,
and 18) from the Sam Kaufman sample are sufficiently well-preserved to determine the presence
or absence of cranial modeling. All seven of these
crania were modeled (see Butler 1969: Figure 34).
The more complete specimens were determined to
be of the tabular fronto-vertico-occipital style. The
tabular fronto-parallelo-occipital style was noted in
96.4 percent of the 56 adult crania recovered from

the Bob Williams site (Loveland and Bass 1983).
Buikstra and Fowler (1975) reported simple tabular
occipital cranial flattening for all but two of the crania from the Bentsen-Clark site. Cranial modeling
was not described for either the Roden, Rowland
Clark, and Holdeman samples in the original reports (Loveland 1986; Rose et al. 1981).
The occipital bones from Burials 24, 28,
30-31, 35, and 36 of the Roitsch sample and
Burials 7, 10-13, 15, and 23 of the Sam Kaufman
sample exhibit a distinctive occipital anomaly, the
supra-inion depression. This anomaly occurred
frequently in many prehistoric New World populations (Stewart 1976), and Rose (1984) has reported
that these depressions are commonly observed in
Caddo populations. The causative factor for the
depressions has been debated (Beattie 1980; Burnett 1988; Cybulski 1980; Derrick n.d.; Holliday
1993; Hrdlicka 1908, 1909; Loveland and Bass
1983; Rose 1984; Stewart 1971, 1976; Weiss 1958,
1967). However, one hypothesis (Derrick n.d.;
Holliday 1993; Stewart 1971, 1976) suggests that
many supra-inion depressions were actually healed
lesions, a result of infection associated with cranial
modeling and environmental pathogens.
The association of supra-inion depressions with
cranial modeling in the Roitsch and Sam Kaufman
samples is striking. The five modeled Roitsch crania
(and one cranium indeterminate for modeling), with
the supra-inion area intact (Burials 24, 28, 30, 31, 35,
and 36), all exhibit supra-inion depressions (Table
33). Supra-inion depressions are present on 57 percent of the modeled crania from the Sam Kaufman
site. Although none of the adult depressions were

active lesions at the time of death, the bone is remodeled, with evidence of sclerotic scarring. The presence
of an active lesion on the occipital of the Roitsch
Burial 36 infant supports the argument for an infectious origin for at least some of these depressions.
Cranial modeling appears to have been common
among the Red River Caddo peoples (see Derrick
and Wilson 1997). In addition, there is a high incidence of supra-inion depressions associated with
cranial modeling in the Roitsch and Sam Kaufman
samples. If the supra-inion depressions were caused
by infection, then based upon evidence from these
Caddo sites, the health of Caddo children may have
been compromised by modeling practices. If so,
examination of the practice of cranial modeling becomes an important facet in morbidity and mortality
studies of Caddo children.

SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS
The purpose of this study has been to analyze
and report on the Caddo human remains recovered
from the Roitsch site during the 1991 and 1992 TAS
Field School excavations and place the resulting
data into a meaningful context. The results were
compared with data from the analysis of skeletal
samples recovered during the 1968 excavation at
the site (then known as Sam Kaufman) and from
other adjoining and approximately contemporary
prehistoric Caddo sites along the middle reaches
of the Red River.
The demographic data from the Roitsch site
are within the range of those from the comparative
samples. There is a slightly higher female to male
ratio at Roitsch, and the number of subadults in the
burial population is also higher. The average stature
of the Roitsch individuals also appears to be slightly
shorter than that of most of the other samples.
Dental caries and abscesses were the most common medical disorders recorded for the Roitsch-Williams-Roden sites. At 64 percent, the overall caries rate
for the 1991-1992 Roitsch sample is higher than that
of the other samples (see Figure 75). The rates of tooth
loss and dental abscesses are also high, although tooth
wear is only moderate to light. Wear patterns showing
greater anterior tooth wear than posterior wear may
indicate extra-dietary use of the teeth in material processing or as a third hand. A correlation between high
caries rates and high abscess rates is supported by this
study and can be related to the different physiological
responses of a tooth to caries and wear.

Degenerative joint disease, manifested as
osteoarthritis and vertebral osteophytosis, was the
next most prevalent disorder, with high rates reported in all of the samples from which data were
available. But in spite of this overall concordance,
the rate of osteoarthritis in the weight-bearing
joints is much lower in the Bob Williams and
Roden samples than in the Roitsch sample at 11
percent, 12.5 percent, and 43 percent, respectively.
The high occurrence in males of temporomandibular joint disease seen in the combined Roitsch and
Kaufman sample (see Table 27) seems to indicate
some sexual division of labor compounded by high
posterior tooth AMTL.
Disorders with a possible nutritional etiology
are rare in the Roitsch and Bob Williams samples.
The porotic hyperostosis rate for Roitsch is only 5
percent and there is only a 9 percent rate for the
Bob Williams sample. In contrast, a high rate of
porotic hyperostosis (33.3 percent) was reported
for the Roden site (Rose et al. 1981). The reasons
for this disparity are unclear. However, evidence
from the Roitsch and Kaufman samples, including the high rate of caries and tooth loss as well
as δ 13C values (on apatite) of -8.2 ‰ to -8.0 ‰
from the stable isotope analysis of four individuals,
indicates that corn was a dietary staple. Microwear
analysis of teeth from the Roden site also support
this conclusion (Rose et al. 1981). Further study is
required to ascertain whether status or sex was a
limiting factor in access to preferred foods.
Tabular cranial modeling appears to have been
a common practice among the Red River Caddo
peoples. Five of six well-preserved crania from the
Roitsch sample were modeled, and the mandible
from a seventh individual may also exhibit evidence of modeling. At least seven crania from the
Kaufman sample, and 96.4 percent of the 56 adult
crania recovered from the Bob Williams site, were
modeled. Occipital flattening was described for the
majority of individuals from the Bentsen-Clark site
(Buikstra and Fowler 1975). An anomaly of the
occipital, the supra-inion depression, appears to be
associated with cranial modeling in the Roitsch and
Sam Kaufman samples. These depressions may be
the result of infection during the modeling process,
and if so, would have ramifications for the future
study of Caddo infant morbidity and mortality (Derrick n.d.; Holliday 1993; Stewart 1971, 1976).
The information garnered in this study, in
conjunction with previously reported data for the
Roitsch-Williams-Roden complex and adjoining

432

Texas Archeological Society

sites, provides a significant body of data with
which to study the biology of the Caddo peoples.
Future work should include statistical analyses
of metric and non-metric trait data for biological distance studies. Stress studies focusing on
dentition, sexual dimorphism, and the presence of
pathological conditions (similar to that of Loveland
[1994a]), would also be valuable contributions to
a better understanding of the health of prehistoric
and historic Caddo peoples of the Red River drainage area.

ARCHEOBOTANICAL REMAINS
FROM FIVE SITES ON THE RED
RIVER, NORTHEAST TEXAS
Gayle J. Fritz
INTRODUCTION
Twenty-one samples of flotation-retrieved
archeobotanical remains from the 1991 Texas
Archeological Society Field School were sent to
the Paleoethnobotanical Laboratory at Washington
University in St. Louis for analysis. As summarized in Table 34, one sample came from the Pine
Cone site (41RR236), one came from the Fasken
site (41RR14), four are from Salt Well Slough
(41RR204), six are from the Ray site (41LR135),
and nine are from the Roitsch site excavations
(41RR16—formerly known as the Sam Kaufman
site). Two samples from the Ray site were labeled
“1 of 2” and “2 of 2” from the same provenience.
These were combined to facilitate recording and
reporting, leaving a total of 20 flotation samples
tabulated in this section.
Types of carbonized plant remains recognized
during the analysis include wood charcoal, pine
cone fragments (Pinus sp.), cane stem (Arundinaria gigantea), thick hickory nutshell (Carya
spp.), thin hickory nutshell—probably pecan (Carya
illinoensis)—walnut shell (Juglans nigra), acorn shell
(Quercus spp.), squash or pepo gourd rind (Cucurbita pepo), seeds, and maize (Zea mays ssp. mays)
in the form of both kernel and cob fragments. Table
35 summarizes the types of material recovered by
provenience. In addition to the above-named plant
types, most samples included unidentified carbonized
material labeled as “Unknowns.” One sample contained fragments of fungal matter, and one included

particles described as silica froth. Uncarbonized items
in the form of rootlets, fresh (modern) seeds, bone,
stone, pottery sherds, etc., are lumped together in the
“Non-carbonized” category.
Soil samples to be floated were selected in the
field by site supervisors and taken to the processing station at the main camp and field laboratory
in Idabel, Oklahoma, just across the Red River
from the excavations. Flotation was conducted by
the “IDOT” box method, described by Pearsall
(1989). The boxes were hand-held objects with
solid U-shaped wooden sides to which were attached lengths of 1.0 mm wire mesh wrapping
across the front, curved bottom, and back. The
box was dipped into a barrel or trough of water,
and, while submerged, soil matrix was added
and agitated. A light fraction was obtained in the
form of suspended organic material scooped into
a hand-held strainer with 0.42 mm wire mesh. The
heavy fraction consisted of all objects caught in the
1.0 mm mesh of the wire-wrapped box. Most light
fractions were miniscule, with the vast majority of
carbonized plant fragments recovered in the heavy
fractions. Although light and heavy fractions were
analyzed and tabulated separately, the results are
combined here to yield a single set of values per
sample. The volume of soil processed varied by
sample (see Table 35), with a total of 223 liters
floated from the 20 samples reported on herein.

METHODS OF ANALYSIS
Analysis was conducted by the author in the
Paleoethnobotanical Laboratory at Washington
University in St. Louis. Presorting was conducted
by Steve Rhee, who sieved the heavy fractions and
removed all carbonized pieces larger than 2.0 mm
from the gravels, sherd fragments, bone fragments,
and other non-carbonized materials that dominated
these heavy fractions.
For both light and heavy fractions, samples
were weighed and the contents then passed
through a series of up to 10 graduated brass geological sieves to facilitate sorting. All archeobotanical remains larger than 2.0 mm were separated
to the most specific taxonomic category possible,
with the exception of wood charcoal, which was
not identified to taxon. Both counts and weights
(to the nearest 0.01 g) were recorded, with
weights determined using an electronic, digital
Sartorius balance. The size groups smaller than

* These two samples were labeled “1 of 2” and “2 of 2,” and were combined during analysis

2.0 mm were carefully examined, but only a few
categories of archeobotanical remains—maize,
acorn shell, cucurbit rind, and seed material—
were systematically removed from them. In addition, when wood charcoal, cane stem, or nutshell
fragments were present in a sample only below the
2.0 mm screen size level, a count of one fragment
and weight of 0.01 g was recorded. Counts and
weights reported here, then, generally represent
objects larger than 2.0 mm in size with the exception of maize, acorn shell, and cucurbit rind,
which include recognizable fragments as small as
1.0 mm. All recognizable seeds, no matter how
small, were pulled and counted.
One heavy fraction, from Feature 2 of the Ray
site, did not receive the standard treatment for particles smaller than 2.0 mm. This sample consisted

primarily of highly fragmented maize cupule and
kernel pieces that would have required an excessive
amount of time to sort out. Therefore, a thorough
scan was conducted for seeds, acorn shell, and
cucurbit rind (none were present), but the maize
fragments smaller than 2.0 mm were not separated.
Entire cupules, however, were pulled and measured
along with those larger than 2.0 mm.
Examination was conducted with the aid of a
low power (7X to 50X) Wild binocular microscope.
Seed identifications were made by comparing archeological specimens in these samples to those
in the reference collection of modern and archeological seed types and by referral to standard seed
identification manuals (Delorit 1970; Delorit and
Gunn 1986; Martin and Barkley 1961; Montgomery 1977).

Perttula—The Archeology of the Roitsch Site (41RR16) 439
CONTENTS OF THE SAMPLES
Wood Charcoal, Pine Cone, and Cane Stem
A total of 1,254 pieces of wood charcoal
larger than 2.0 mm were found in the 20 samples,
weighing a total of 11.26 g. The single sample from
the Pine Cone site (41RR236) contained only four
wood charcoal fragments but was dominated by
carbonized pine cone fragments weighing a total of
7.29 g. In addition to the pine cone fragments in the
flotation sample, our lab received a vial containing
1.75 g of pine cone fragments hand-picked from
the fill of this feature (Feature 1) during excavation.
The species of Pinus represented could not be
determined, but the fragments appear smaller than,
and morphologically different from, Pinus palustris.
Based on modern phytogeography, the most likely
species are Pinus echinata and Pinus taeda (Nixon
1985; Texas A&M University 1975).
Fragments of cane stem (culm) are not infrequently found in archeobotanical samples from
the Southeast U.S., likely representing remnants
of matting, basketry, other utensils and tools, or
construction material incorporated into houses
and other structures. Five (25 percent) of the 20
samples from the 1991 Texas Archeological Society Field School excavations included cane stem
fragments, with the total of 112 pieces weighing
0.71 g. Most cane stem came from the Roitsch site,
with the two samples from Feature 405 accounting
for 99 of the 112 specimens.
Nutshell
Fragments of nutshell were sorted into five
categories: thick hickory, thin hickory, walnut,
Juglandaceae, and acorn. Thick-shelled nuts grow
on various hickory species in Northeast Texas,
including shagbark (Carya ovata), mockernut (C.
tomentosa), shellbark (C. laciniosa), swamp hickory (C. leiodermis), and black hickory (C. texana)
(Nixon 1985; Texas A&M University 1975). The
thin hickory nutshell probably came from pecans
(C. illinoensis), although nutmeg hickory (C.
myristicaeformis) and bitternut hickory (C. cordiformis) are other possibilities. The Juglandaceae
category accommodates nutshell fragments that
are either hickory or walnut but cannot be identified with confidence to either genus of the walnut
family. These fragments tend to be among the
smallest of the larger than 2.0 mm pieces. The 110

Juglandaceae fragments weigh a total of 0.88 g,
whereas the 56 walnut shell fragments total 1.70 g
in weight.
Thick hickory nutshell is the most common
type in these assemblages, with 336 fragments
weighing a total of 5.79 g, distributed among
13 samples (65 percent Ubiquity). Thin hickory,
likely to be somewhat underrepresented due to its
fragility, was found in only four samples (20 percent Ubiquity), with the 11 thin hickory nutshell
fragments weighing a total of 0.09 g. Walnut shell
was recognized in only two samples (5 percent
Ubiquity)—both from Feature 405 at the Roitsch
site—but two additional samples from Roitsch and
two from other sites include Juglandaceae fragments that may represent walnuts.
Acorn shell is the most underrepresented of
the edible mast types due to its thinness and low
density. The 81 acorn shell fragments are nearly
as ubiquitous as thick hickory. Acorn is present in
12 samples (60 percent Ubiquity), as compared to
13 samples containing thick hickory (a 65 percent
Ubiquity value). The total weight of 0.16 g for
acorn shell listed in Table 35 is not a meaningful figure, since weights of less than 0.005 g per
sample were entered as 0.01 g.
Pecans and walnuts appear less significant than
either acorns or thick hickories using this limited
and perhaps unrepresentative set of samples. Walnut shell is concentrated in a Late Caddo hearth—
Feature 405—but it would be premature to suggest
heavier use of walnuts by Late Caddo McCurtain
phase peoples as opposed to Early Caddo people living along the Red River. Systematic flotation recovery of many more samples from both periods would
be necessary to confirm trends of this nature.
Cucurbit Rind
Three small fragments of Cucurbita pepo rind
were present in samples from the Roitsch site:
two from Feature 402 and one from Feature 405
in Block IV, located in the Late Caddo McCurtain
phase village. The two rind fragments from Feature
402 are 0.8 mm thick; the piece from Feature 405
is 1.1 mm thick. Although all are thin enough to
represent free-growing populations of texana-like
gourds that would be classified as C. pepo ssp.
ovifera var. texana following Decker (1988), it is
more likely that they were cultigens. Carbonized
pepo rind fragments from archeological sites do not
necessarily reflect the original rind thickness of the

440

Texas Archeological Society

gourd, squash, or pumpkin fruits they came from.
Interior cell layers may have rotted, been scraped,
or otherwise eroded away, and some shrinkage
probably occurred during carbonization.
Since the Caddo Indians at European contact
grew pumpkins, squashes, and “calabazas” (Swanton 1942), I believe these rind fragments probably
came from domesticated rather than wild-growing
fruits. If they were members of populations originally domesticated in Mexico that diffused into
the Eastern Woodlands via the Greater Southwest,
they would be classified as C. pepo ssp. pepo. This
subspecies is likely to represent a separate lineage
that today includes the jack-o-lantern pumpkin,
zucchini squash, orange ball gourd, and other
cultivated varieties such as traditional Mexican
landraces (Fritz 1990; Heiser 1989; Smith 1987,
1989). If, however, the Roitsch site specimens
came from fruits belonging to a lineage domesticated in eastern North America from a texana-like
ancestor, they would be classified as C. pepo ssp.
ovifera var. ovifera. This taxon includes modern
cultivars such as yellow crookneck squash, scallop
(pattypan) squash, and diverse ornamental gourds.
It would include squashes grown prehistorically
for seeds and/or for fleshy pulp as well as pepo
gourds (not to be confused with the bottle gourd,
Lagenaria siceraria) grown primarily for use as
containers or other utensils.
Maize
Recognizable maize kernel and cob fragments
were present in 12 samples, giving a ubiquity value
of 60 percent. All five sites contained maize in at
least one sample, with a total weight of 4.11 g. The
overall maize assemblage consists of one virtually complete kernel (but missing the embryo), 60
kernel fragments, 128 virtually complete cupules,
372 cupule fragments, and 49 glumes or fragments
of glumes. The measurable kernel is from Feature
405 at the Roitsch site, measuring 6.5 mm in width
and 5.2 mm in height. Thickness (or internode
length) could not be measured due to the shape
distortion caused by carbonization. The width of
one fragmentary kernel from Lot 98 at the Salt
Well Slough site (41RR204) could be measured,
yielding a value of 6.0 mm.
Table 36 presents measurements of entire cupules. Most of these (109 out of the total number
of 128) were recovered from Feature 2 at the Ray
site. The archeobotanical assemblage from this

small pit consisted primarily of cupules, glumes,
and fragments thereof, with corn fragments larger
than 2.0 mm weighing 3.29 g. The only other categories of archeobotanical material represented in
this pit were wood charcoal (109 pieces weighing
1.30 g) and unknowns (18 pieces weighing a total
of 0.08 g). Many of the latter may well be unrecognizable fragments of corn cobs. As mentioned
above, cupule fragments were not pulled from the
smaller than 2.0 mm portion of this sample. The
five complete cupules smaller than 2.0 mm, however, are included in the measurements. A number
of cupules larger than 2.0 mm are still attached to
adjacent cupules in the row, with six sets of three
cupules joined along a row, and nine sets of two
cupules. The pit probably contained larger cob segments that fell apart during flotation. Because none
of the cob fragments submitted for analysis have
more than a fraction of the cob’s circumference, I
could not determine row numbers. Wood charcoal
from this feature yielded an uncorrected radiocarbon date of A.D. 740 + 90 (the calibrated age range
at 1-sigma is AD 759-895, with a 73 percent relative area under probability distribution). Calibrated
radiocarbon ages on the corn itself in this feature
date from AD 1000-1205 (Bruseth et al. 2001:206
and Table 11).
Cupule widths from Feature 2 of the Ray site
range from 3.5 mm to 7.6 mm, with a mean of 5.60
mm (standard deviation= 0.740 mm). Mean cupule
widths for the other three sites with measurable cupules vary between 4.60 mm and 5.78 mm, but no
single sample other than the one from Feature 2 at the
Ray site includes more than six measurable cupules.
In spite of the early radiocarbon date from
Feature 2, the cupules are not notably different in
size than those from the Early to Late Caddo period contexts represented at the other sites; indeed,
the radiocarbon dates on the corn from Feature 2
indicate they accumulated in Formative to Middle
Caddo period times. Internode lengths from the
Ray site sample may appear to be significantly
larger (mean=3.19 mm as compared to other means
of 1.75 to 2.60 mm) but this is probably due to the
fact that Ray site internode lengths include only
those specimens that consisted of two to three
adjoining cupules. The internode length measurements of single cupules from the other sites are
likely to be unrealistically small.
Archeologists will need to recover and analyze
assemblages that include complete cobs or segments having entire, intact circumferences before

interpretations can be made about changes in
maize morphology through time in the Red River
Caddo area. The meager information available to
date indicates that Early Caddo maize had a high
proportion of small cobs with low row numbers
(Jones 1949). Very late 18th century maize at the
Roseborough Lake site consists of 8-row to 14-row
cobs with a mean row number of 11.73 for the
assemblage (Fritz 1986a). These few studies are
insufficient for suggesting general trends.
Ceramics and other artifacts from the Ray site
indicate that a Woodland period occupation occurred there, and the uncorrected radiocarbon date
of A.D. 740 + 90 from Feature 2 indicates that the
corn from this pit may have been grown by some
of the earliest farmers in the region. The two-sigma
date range, however, extends beyond A.D. 900, as
do the two-sigma ranges of two other radiocarbon
dates from the site (Bruseth and Banks 1992). It is a
source of some concern that corn is not present in any
of the other Ray site flotation samples. A direct AMS
date on cupules from Feature 2 should be obtained
before concluding that this represents the earliest
corn in Northeast Texas, especially since it gives
no indication of differing morphologically from the
Early Caddo through Late Caddo period corn from
the Roitsch, Saltwell Slough, and the Pine Cone sites.
Subsequent to the first writing of this section in 1992,
AMS dates were obtained on the Feature 2 corn, as
previously mentioned, and they indicate the corn “at
the site was from a later Caddoan occupation” at the
Ray site (Bruseth et al. 2001:213).
Seeds
The 20 flotation samples yielded a total of 102
fully or partially carbonized seeds. Seventy-seven
of these—all from Feature 601 of the Roitsch
site—are viewed with extreme suspicion due to
the partially carbonized condition of many, the
likelihood that they represent species not growing
in North America before European contact, and
the presence of carbonized wheat (Triticum sp.)
and uncarbonized seeds such as Johnson grass
(Sorghum halapense) that are undoubtedly Old
World introductions. After subtracting the 27
suspected contaminants, the seed assemblage totals
75 (Table 37). Ten fully carbonized seeds from
Feature 601 have not been subtracted. Nine of these
represent common prehistoric seed types: four
maygrass (Phalaris caroliniana), one little barley
(Hordeum pusillum), one chenopod (Chenopodium

sp.), one vetch-type (Fabaceae), one grape family
(Vitaceae), and one purslane (Portulaca oleracea)
that are present in other samples reported here. The
10th seed is unidentified. Because the Feature 601
samples are so contaminated, some analysts might
prefer to disregard all seeds and other carbonized
plant remains from this highly disturbed feature.
An uncorrected radiocarbon date on charcoal of
A.D. 1110 + 120 (calibrated age range at 1-sigma
is AD 1154-1296), however, demonstrates that
some of the archeobotanical material is prehistoric
in age. Middle Caddo period ceramic types were
also present in the fill of the feature (see Block VI
discussion, this article).
The most common seed type in the combined
assemblage from the five sites excavated in 1991
is maygrass (Phalaris caroliniana), with a total
of 21 specimens distributed across eight samples
(Ubiquity value of 40 percent). Next most abundant
is chenopod (Chenopodium sp.), with 15 seeds
from six separate samples (Ubiquity value of 30
percent). Four purslane (Portulaca oleracea) seeds
were found, each in a separate sample (20 percent
Ubiquity). Four round seeds or cotyledons thereof,
each in a separate sample and varying from 1.3
to 1.5 mm in diameter, have been classified as
“vetch-type” because they likely represent one or
more of the species of native Vicia or Lathyrus.
All vetch-type specimens in these samples lack
seed coat or hilum characters that would enable
them to be identified to the genus or species level.
Two fragmentary seeds in the grape family (Vitaceae) are likely to have come from grape fruits
(Vitis spp.), but are not in good enough condition
to be classified to that genus rather than others in
the same family. Two pine seeds (Pinus sp.) were
present in the sample from the Pine Cone site that
consists primarily of pine cone fragments. The remaining seed types, each with a single representative, include amaranth (Amaranthus sp.), bedstraw
or cleavers (Galium sp.), spurge (Euphorbia cf.
maculata), and grass family (Poaceae).
As Story (1990a:253-255) has noted, there
is currently little, if any, evidence indicating that
people in the Red River Caddo archeological area
grew native seed crops prior to the introduction of
maize, or that they grew these crops along with
maize during Early Caddo times. Insufficient flotation has been conducted at components in East
Texas dating between 200 B.C. and A.D. 1250,
the general time frame when the so-called Eastern
North American Agricultural Complex flourished

elsewhere, but negative evidence from small-scale
sampling operations such as this TAS Field School
make it seem increasingly unlikely that native seed
plants were significant crops in this region.
Maygrass is considered a cultivated seed plant
when recovered from sites in the Midwest, where
it does not grow spontaneously today but constitutes a significant proportion of Late Woodland
and Early Mississippian period seed assemblages.
The maygrass seeds from Roitsch, Ray, and the
Pine Cone sites may also have been harvested from
cultivated plants, but it seems equally, if not more
likely, that Red River Caddo people utilized the native maygrass from wild or encouraged populations.
Maygrass was likely a welcome food source, since
the seeds are highly nutritious and mature in the late
spring when stored food reserves might be running
low (Cowan 1978; Crites and Terry 1987).
The chenopod seeds from these samples do
not exhibit the seed coat reduction or truncate
margins diagnostic of the North American cultigen, C. berlandieri ssp. jonesianum (Smith 1984,
1985a, 1985b; Fritz and Smith 1988; Smith and
Funk 1985). Variation in shape and seed coat texture indicates that more than one wild or weedy
species is represented here, but all seed coats are
thick. Native chenopods were probably harvested
by prehistoric Caddo people for the leafy greens,
but we cannot assume that all seeds entering the
archeobotanical record came from economic
plants. By the Woodland period, and probably
much earlier, human activity in Northeast Texas
would have resulted in open, disturbed habitats
colonized by ruderal species such as many of the
native chenopods. Some seeds from these prolific
seed producers could have become carbonized as
part of accidental “seed rain.”
A third member of the Midcontinental premaize crop complex, little barley, is represented by
only two seeds. Like maygrass, little barley is native
to Northeast Texas and might have been harvested
from spontaneous populations in the early summer.
Purslane, amaranth, spurge, and bedstraw are ruderal
plants that have edible parts, but may have entered
these samples as weeds harvested with maize or
other cultigens, or incidentally as seed rain.
The vetch-type seed, likely either Lathyrus
sp. or Vicia sp., has been recovered from several
other sites in East Texas (Crane 1988, 1990; Fritz
1987) and Oklahoma (Fritz 1989). These might
represent plant parts harvested for seeds or for
the sweet, green pods. Grapes (Vitis sp.) were,

of course, regularly consumed by Southeastern
Indians (Swanton 1979).
An unusually high proportion of the seeds (a
total of 21) remains unidentified. Some of these
may have come from economically useful plants
brought to the sites, but since they occur in assemblages reflecting relatively little use of native
seeds, I tend to suspect that most are incidental
inclusions. One type of unidentified seed occurred
in both samples from Feature 405 at the Roitsch
site, with a total of five specimens. These slightly
reniform seeds range from 1.4 mm to 1.5 mm in
length and 1.2 mm to 1.3 mm in width. A relatively
thick, smooth, outer coat is slightly split in a few
of the specimens, revealing an inner kernel or endosperm. A second, very small, unidentified seed
type was found in three separate samples from two
sites, Roitsch and Fasken, with a single seed of this
type in each sample. Lengths range from 0.7 to 1.0
mm; widths from 0.5 to 0.7 mm. These seeds are
oval and flattish, with one end more constricted
than the other from top to bottom, resembling some
seeds of the Mint family (Lamiaceae). A long-term
paleoethnobotanical effort in this area would, of
course, include the building of modern reference
collections from Red River County and searches
through local herbaria in an attempt to identify
unknown seed types such as these.
Sixty-five seed fragments are considered unidentifiable. The heavy fractions of these samples
were generally filled with small rocks that would
be highly damaging to fragile archeobotanical
remains. In retrospect, given the poor light fraction recovery rate and the abundance of gravels
in the soil matrix, an IDOT system is probably
not the best flotation recovery method for use on
Red River Caddo sites. A SMAP-type machine
(Pearsall 1989; Watson 1976), with water pressure
from below aiding light fraction recovery, would
be preferable.

DISCUSSION OF SUBSISTENCE
INDICATORS
Given a total assemblage of only 20 samples
distributed across five sites, it is impossible to
present conclusions concerning subsistence trends
through time or to define elements of a Caddo
subsistence system at any point in time on the
basis of the meager information available. For our
knowledge of prehistoric Caddo plant use to rise

Perttula—The Archeology of the Roitsch Site (41RR16) 445
above its present level, archeologists must begin
investing heavily in flotation equipment oriented
specifically to the soils and other particular
conditions of this region. Research strategies must
include systematic flotation sampling procedures
allowing statistically valid comparisons within and
between sites to be made. Paleoethnobotanists must
be incorporated into the research process at the
highest decision-making levels as full-time team
members in the field and laboratory, as well as at
the publication stage. In the meantime, rudimentary
observations can be made.
Possible Woodland Period or Formative
Caddo Period: The Ray Site
The possibility of obtaining a pre-Caddo subsistence assemblage from the Ray site is exciting.
As noted above, the maize concentration from
Feature 2 (Lot 124) was thought to represent some
of the earliest corn grown in northeastern Texas,
although it has now been established that it dates
after the 11th century A.D. If an adequate set of
firmly dated samples from this site (thought by
Bruseth et al. [2001] to mainly date between A.D.
800-1000) and contemporaneous components verifies the high visibility of maize and low proportion
or absence of native seed crops before A.D. 900,
we can begin modeling an agricultural trajectory
with maize adopted by previously non-gardening
populations during the later centuries of the 1st
millennium A.D. Maize intensification may then
either precede or be directly correlated with the
formation of recognizable Caddo sociopolitical
units. If future investigations support the high
ubiquity and/or frequency of maize on the Red
River of Northeast Texas before A.D. 900, the situation here will seem different from that currently
visible in the Ozarks and Arkansas River valley
(Fritz 1986b, 1989, 1990), where corn is poorly
represented before ca. A.D. 1100 and where native
seed crops appear to have been widely produced
before maize was intensified.
Early to Middle Caddo Period
Four samples from the Roitsch site and two
from Fasken were most likely deposited during the
Early to Middle Caddo periods. Unfortunately, the
Middle Caddo samples from Roitsch are all from
Feature 601, which was severely disturbed by a
pothunter’s trench and can be judged generally

contaminated by the non-indigenous plant remains.
However, the maize fragments, maygrass seeds,
chenopod seeds, acorn, and hickory nutshell
fragments from Feature 601 reflect part of what
might be predicted for Early to Middle Caddo plant
utilization. The sample from Feature 2 at the Fasken
site (Lot 292) contained few carbonized plant
remains, but did include maize, hickory nutshell,
acorn shell, and a few seeds (one amaranth, one
purslane, one spurge, and three unidentified).
Late Caddo Period
Seven samples come from proveniences
thought to reflect Late Caddo plant use. Feature 1
(Lot 37) at the Pine Cone sites dates to the earlier
part of the McCurtain phase, ca. A.D. 1300-1500.
Maize fragments and a few seeds (one maygrass,
one chenopod, one purslane, and two pine) were
included with the carbonized pine cone parts that
dominated this sample.
The four Saltwell Slough samples also belong
to the earlier part of the McCurtain phase. All but
one of these contains maize, two have thick hickory
nutshell, two have pecan, and one includes acorn
shell. Eight chenopod seeds, one little barley, one
vetch-type, and one grape family seed may also
reflect subsistence-related activities at this site.
Feature 405 at the Roitsch site (Lots 1017 and
1018), a hearth that contained Late Caddo ceramics, was rich in maize, hickory, walnut, and acorn
shell and included one fragment of Cucurbita rind.
Maygrass, chenopod, and purslane seeds were also
recovered from this feature. Feature 402 (Lot 1020)
included two Cucurbita rind fragments, along with
maize, hickory, pecan, and acorn shells.
Either Early or Late Caddo
Samples from Feature 101 (Lot 1015) and the
fill of Burial 1 in the East Mound (Lot 1025) are not
readily assignable to either the Early or Late Caddo
periods based on their archeological contexts. The
sample from Feature 101 was virtually devoid of
archeobotanical remains, but the other yielded
maize, hickory, pecan, and acorn shell fragments
along with a typically low count of seeds.
ISSUES FOR FUTURE
INVESTIGATION
The archeobotanical remains recovered by

446

Texas Archeological Society

flotation from five sites excavated by the Texas
Archeological Society field school participants
offer an enigmatic glimpse of prehistoric plant
use, but larger-scale recovery and more systematic
sampling are needed before meaningful interpretations can be offered. Several issues discussed by
Story (1990a) and Burnett (1990) will hopefully be
addressed by future subsistence-oriented research
projects in this area.
First, what is the best way to model the interrelatedness of maize agriculture and the formation of hierarchically ranked Caddo polities?
Second, what differences in amounts of maize
consumption, and presumably in intensity of
farming, might have existed among groups living
in different ecological sub-regions of the greater
Red River Caddo area? If validated by further
bioarcheological and archeobotanical evidence,
why did these sub-regional variations exist?
Third, did farming in this area develop with a
primary focus on maize, without significant production of the pre-maize native annual seed crops
important for Woodland and Emergent Mississippian period societies of the Midwest, the Ozarks,
and Arkansas River valley? Fourth, what types of
Cucurbita pepo squashes, gourds, and pumpkins
were grown here? Do the rind fragments from
Cooper Lake sites (Crane 1988) and now from
the Roitsch site as well, represent “tropical” cultigens domesticated in Mexico; do they belong to
an indigenous, domesticated ovifera subspecies
with a wild Texas gourd-like ancestor, or did
they come from free-living populations rather
than cultivated or domesticated ones? Fifth, are
cultivated beans (Phaseolus vulgaris) as late as
indicated by the incomplete archeobotanical record currently available? Were they grown only
when and where the most intense agriculture was
practiced and, if so, how does this vary through
time and across space?
Caddoan-speaking women observed by early
Europeans were serious farmers who also harvested quantities of nuts, wild fruits, and underground
plant parts to feed their families and fulfill social
and ritual obligations. The 20 samples of archeological plant remains reported here may not furnish
a great deal of information about the prehistoric
development of Caddo food ways, but they do
reflect the general pattern documented ethnohistorically, and make some progress in the direction
of understanding the late prehistoric subsistence in
this region.

MORE MACROBOTANICAL
MATERIALS FROM THREE
SITES ALONG THE RED RIVER,
NORTHEAST TEXAS: RAY
(41LR135), FASKEN (41RR14),
AND ROITSCH (41RR16)
S. Eileen Goldborer
Thirty flotation samples from the 1992 Texas
Archeological Society Field School were submitted for macrobotanical analysis. Seventeen
samples came from the Ray site (41LR135), five
from Fasken (41RR14), and eight from Roitsch
(41RR16). Two samples from the Ray site were
labeled: Light Fraction “1 of 2” and “2 of 2”;
two others were labeled: Heavy Fraction “l of 2”
and “2 of 2.” The companion bags for this light
and heavy fraction were combined to facilitate
reporting. The resulting 28 samples are summarized in Table 38. Those 28 samples represent
17 proveniences within 11 features. All light and
heavy fractions having the same lot number (i.e.,
identical provenience) have been grouped together
in the summary tabulation. Table 39 reviews the
total number of samples and features analyzed
from Ray, Fasken, and Roitsch for the combined
1991 and 1992 field seasons.
Both charred and uncharred materials were
sorted from the soil matrix. Carbonized macrobotanical remains identified during the analysis include
wood charcoal, thick hickory nutshell (Carya sp.),
walnut shell (Juglans nigra), seeds, and maize (Zea
mays ssp. mays) (Table 40). Uncarbonized branchlet
fragments of juniper (Juniperus sp.) were present in
all but a few samples. On the other hand, uncharred
rootlets that commonly appear in flotation samples
occurred in only one fraction. Fresh seeds were
present in a number of samples from Ray and a
few from Roitsch. Non-botanical items sorted from
the soil matrix included bone, lithics, pottery sherd
fragments, shell, and snails. Only three lots from
the Fasken site did not contain one or more of these
material types. Many of the samples contained bone
or microlithic artifacts (smaller than 7 mm), many
of which had been exposed to fire.
The selection and flotation of soil samples
for the 1992 season were made by the same
methods used for the 1991 TAS Field School.
After selection in the field by site supervisors, soil
samples were again processed at a field laboratory
in Idabel, Oklahoma, across the Red River from

the excavations. The same “IDOT” box flotation
method (Pearsall 1989) was used to process the
1991 and 1992 samples. The 1991 flotation process
has been fully described by Fritz (1992:1, 2, see
also Fritz, this article). As was done with the 1991
data, light and heavy fractions were also analyzed
and tabulated separately.

METHODOLOGY
After flotation, samples were delivered to
the author for sorting and analysis. All light and
heavy fractions were weighed before sorting. To
facilitate sorting, each sample was passed through
geological sieves (4.0, 2.0, and 1.0. mm). All

fractions were fully sorted except for charcoal and
nutshell below 2 mm in size, and snails below 1
mm in size. The number of snails below 1 mm in
length was estimated, but they were not collected.
In the one sample where charcoal or nutshell
fragments were present only in a sample below
2 mm in size, a weight of 0.01 g was recorded
for each fragment. All charred seeds and maize
fragments, regardless of size, were removed from
the flotation samples.
Size-segregated fractions were sorted under

a Meiji binocular microscope (7X to 45X). A
comparative collection, and standard identification
manuals (Delorit 1970; Martin and Barkley 1973;
Montgomery 1977) were used to identify seeds. An
attempt was also made to identify wood sources of
charcoal. However, charcoal was generally very
fragile, often breaking into minuscule fragments
when snapped. For fragments not breaking up,
standard references (Core et al. 1979; Dimbleby
1967) and a comparative collection were used for
identification purposes.

RESULTS
Wood Charcoal
Only 16 (57 percent) of the 28 flotation samples
had wood charcoal larger than 2 mm in length for a
total weight of 24.2 g. The total charcoal weight per
site for Ray (Features 1, 37, and 60) and Roitsch
(Features 104, 208, and 310) are 19.6 g and 4.6 g,
respectively. No charcoal was present in samples
from Feature 40 at the Ray site. Similarly, none of
the four post holes represented by the five samples
from Fasken had any charcoal. Individual sample
weights are recorded in Table 40. When both field
seasons samples were combined (see Fritz 1992,
and this article), 85.7 percent of the features at Ray
and all of those at Roitsch had charcoal.
Examination of the wood charcoal was made
at magnifications up to 100X. The size and fragile
condition of the small amounts of charcoal present in both the Ray and Roitsch samples generally
precluded identification of wood taxon. However,
several pieces from both light and heavy fractions
at the Ray site (Unit S61W41, East half, Feature
1, level 5) were ring-porous with general characteristics consistent with oak (Quercus sp.). Several
pieces from the heavy fraction of that provenience
were identified as being in the white oak group,
which includes such local natives as post oak (Q.
stellata) and bur oak (Q. macrocarpa) (Simpson
1988:280, 297).
The largest amount of charcoal extracted
from any one sample was 9 g from Feature 60 at
the Ray site. All fragments were under 5 mm in
length and most were very distorted. While the
wood family was not identified, four pieces had
the same semi-ring porous structure combined with
unevenly spaced, narrow rays. Such a structure at
least eliminates oak, which was present in Feature
1 at the Ray site, and native gymnosperms such as
Loblolly pine (Pinus taeda) and Eastern red cedar
(Juniperus virginiana) (Simpson 1988:188, 228).
Pine cone fragments from an unidentified species
were present in Feature 1 (Fritz 1992:3). Uncharred
juniper branchlet fragments occurred in numerous
1992 Ray samples.
Nutshell
Only black walnut (0.5 g) and thick hickory
(41.22 g) nutshell were present in the 1992 TAS
Field School samples. All of the nutshell came

from either the Ray or Roitsch site; none came
from Fasken. Although 15 (53.6 percent) of the
total samples had some nutshell, both ubiquity and
abundance were greatest in the Ray samples.
Among the 15 Ray site samples, 10 (66.7 percent) had hickory nutshell. However, walnut was
retrieved from only one Ray sample (Feature 1,
level 5). Level 5 also provided the largest amount
of hickory nutshell. While only four (26.7 percent) of the 1992 Ray samples came from level 5
of Feature 1, they account for 66.1 percent of the
total hickory nutshell by weight and 82.5 percent
from all Feature 1 levels. A noticeable increase in
nutshell is apparent in level 4 from that obtained
in higher level (levels 2 and 3) samples.
When combined, the six samples from levels
4 and 5 include 60 percent of the 10 Ray samples
with hickory nutshell, and 75 percent of such
samples (n=8) from Feature 1. They account for
79.4 percent of the total hickory nutshell by weight
within all 1992 Ray samples, and 99 percent of it
from all Feature 1 levels. On the other hand, no
nutshell was present in samples from Ray Feature
40 or Feature 60. Six (75.0 percent) of the eight
Roitsch fractions also had hickory nutshell. When
the data for both field seasons are combined, the
ubiquity of nutshell within all features sampled at
Ray and Roitsch is 57.1 percent and 87.5 percent,
respectively.

Maize
Six (21.4 percent) of the 28 samples contained
whole or partial maize cupules. Cupule measurements are presented in Table 41. While maize was
present in fractions from the Roitsch and Ray sites,
it was not found in any of the five flotation samples
from Fasken.
Half of the eight Roitsch samples from the
1992 fi eld season contained corn. Since four
samples from the 1991 season also contained maize
(see Table 36), ubiquity remains about the same (47
percent) when the 17 Roitsch samples from both
field seasons are combined. All of the 1992 Roitsch
fractions with maize came from either Feature 104
(hearth) or Feature 208 (Burial 21). The corn from
Feature 104 includes one whole cupule and three
cupule fragments. One cupule fragment measures
3 mm in width and is about 60 percent complete.
This suggests a complete charred width of 5 mm,
identical with the width of the whole cupule.

The three whole cupules from Feature 208 are
4.5 mm, 5.3 mm, and 5.4 mm wide. The whole
cupule widths from Feature 104 and Feature 208 fit
within the range (3.5-6.2 mm) of 11 others that Fritz
(see Table 36) retrieved from four Roitsch samples
excavated during the 1991 TAS Field School. Of
the 13 cupule fragments from Feature 208, three
had more than half of the cupules preserved. This
allows an estimation of the original charred widths
as being 5.0 mm, 5.1 mm, and 6.0 mm. These projected widths also fall within the range for the 1991
samples. The mean whole cupule widths for samples
from Features 104 and 208 (Burial 21) are 5.0 mm
and 5.07 mm, respectively.
If the projected complete cupule widths for
the three fragments in Feature 208 are combined
with whole cupule widths, the mean for that feature
would rise slightly to 5.21 mm. All of these means
are consistent with those for the four 1991 samples
of 4.73 mm, 5.1 mm, 5.1 mm, and 5.45 mm (see
Table 36) from Roitsch Features 402, 405, and
Burial 20. Mean internode lengths of cupules from
Feature 104 and Feature 208 are 2.0 mm and 1.77
mm, respectively. Those measurements are within
the range and means that Fritz (see Table 36) found
for single cupules from Roitsch.
In addition to cupules, two sets of two spikelets
still attached at their bases were also recovered
from Feature 208 at Roitsch. Both of the lower
glumes as well as the two upper glumes were still
attached to spikelet tissue. The glumes are narrow,
forming radial widths for the individual ranks
of 5.3 mm and 5.4 mm, respectively. The radial
width of two adjacent lower glumes within one
rank should approximate the charred cupule width,
so that the previous measurements are consistent

with the widths of the cupules from Feature 208.
Spikelet thickness as defined by Bird (1990:12)
is approximately 1 mm for each set of spikelets.
Feature 208 also had one charred and distorted
fragment recorded as an unknown, but which may
be endosperm from a kernel.
Two (13.3 percent) of the 15 1992 TAS samples from the Ray site contained maize. Since only
one 1991 Ray flotation sample had corn, ubiquity
remains low (15 percent) even when the 20 Ray
samples from both seasons are combined. Twelve
(60 percent) of the combined 1991 and 1992 Ray
samples came from Feature 1, which had no remains of maize.
During the 1992 field season, flotation samples
were taken from four features (Features 1, 37, 40,
and 60), but both of the fractions with maize came
from only one feature (Feature 37). Ray samples
from the 1991 season also came from four features
(Feature 1, 2, Hearth [N328E425], and Hearth-Top
[S61W41]), but maize was only present in Feature
2 (see Tables 35 and 36). The only maize remains
in Feature 37 were three complete cupules. Those
cupules’ widths (4.8 mm, 5.0 mm, and 5.1 mm)
have a mean of 4.97 mm. These widths and mean
fall within the width range of the 109 whole cupules recovered from Feature 2 during the 1991
season (see Table 36). However, the Feature 37
mean is somewhat smaller than the 5.6 mm mean
(see Table 36) from Feature 2.
Internode lengths for the three single cupules in
Feature 37 (see Table 41) had a smaller range and
mean than those measured from Feature 2 by Fritz
(1992:7 and Table 3). However, Fritz (1992:7) notes
that the Feature 2 internode lengths were measured
on specimens with two or three adjoining cupules.

Perttula—The Archeology of the Roitsch Site (41RR16) 453
A larger and truer measurement can be expected for
those internode lengths than on single cupules where
the edge of the internode may not be as clearly defined. The width/internode (w/i) ratio of the means
from Feature 2 cupules, from which the internode
measurements are probably the most reliable, is greater than one (i.e., w/i=1.75). A width/internode ratio
over one is indicative of Maiz de Ocho or eight-rowed
corn (Galinat 1985:261-263). All of the means for
single whole cupules retrieved during the combined
field seasons have a width/internode ratio of more
than 2.0 (Table 42). Even if the larger, and probably
more realistic, 3.19 internode mean from Feature 2 at
Ray were used to adjust “w/i” mean ratios for cupules
from each feature sampled during the 1991 and 1992
field seasons, the resulting “w/i” mean ratios would
have a value of 1.4 or more (see Table 42).

Charred Seeds
Despite an attempt to recover all charred seed
remains regardless of size, only two (7.1 percent)
flotation samples from the 1992 excavations
yielded any. One fraction came from the Ray site
and one from the Roitsch site. When samples from
both the 199l and 1992 field seasons are considered,
two (10 percent) of the 20 Ray fractions and nine
(52.9 percent) of the 17 Roitsch fractions contained
charred seeds. Of the features sampled during both
field seasons, two (28.6 percent) of the seven at
Ray and six (75 percent) of the eight samples at
Roitsch also contained charred seeds.
Five whole and two fragments of charred seeds
were present in one sample from Feature 1 (Lot
481) at the Ray site. These seeds are all bedstraw

or cleavers (Galium sp.). Twelve (60 percent) of
the combined 1991 and 1992 samples came from
Feature 1. However, Feature 1 provided only one
of the two fractions with charred seeds from Ray.
A Roitsch sample from Feature 104 contained one nearly whole seed and one seed fragment. The almost complete seed is native violet
(Viola sp.). This seed closely resembles Plate 197
in Martin and Barkley (1961:33) of V. palmata.
V. palmata is not listed in the Manual of the
Vascular Plants of Texas (Correll and Johnston
1979). However, Steyermark (1963:1082) states
that variants of V. triloba, a bottomland wood
violet native to East Texas, are often misidentified as V. palmata. If there is a close relationship
between the two species, the seeds may also look
very similar, but a comparative specimen was not
available. The seed fragment from Feature 104
preserves about half the seed with identifying
characteristics. The fragment is a gromwell or
puccoon (Lithospermum cf. carolinense).
Charred seeds may occur in the archeological
record as “seed rain” or from direct or indirect use
(Minnis 1981:145). Prehistoric seeds used for food,
medicine, or other purposes, as well as seeds attached to plants processed for different parts, have
a higher likelihood of being exposed to fires in a
cultural context and, therefore, of becoming charred.
The native violet and gromwell at Roitsch occur
together with maize in a hearth (Feature 104).
The leaves of native violets can be eaten and
are extremely high in vitamins C and A (Zennie
and Ogzewalla 1977:76-79). Various parts of indigenous violets were used by Native Americans
to make medicines, especially for urinary tract
problems (Erichsen-Brown 1979:329-332; Vogel
1970:387). Gromwell (puccoon) seeds were also
used to treat urinary problems by the early European settlers (Erichsen-Brown 1979:458). With the
wide knowledge Indians had of native plants, they
may also have been familiar with similar healing
properties in native gromwells.
Since neither native violet or gromwell commonly appear in the archeological record and since
both are historically known for treating similar
ailments, a medicinal as well as a food use could
account for the appearance of Viola and Lithospermum together in Feature 104. Lithospermum,
however, does have several other documented uses
among Native Americans, so that it might have
been collected for one purpose, but also used for a
secondary reason. The primary use was of the root

of yellow puccoon (L. caroliniense) and other species as a dye for decorating the body, baskets, or
other objects (Erichsen-Brown 1979:318, 458-459).
Puccoon seems to be an Algonquian term applied
to several roots including Lithospermum sp. and
Sanguinaria canadensis (bloodroot) that yield a
red or yellow dye (Gove 1976:237, 1836). Since
cane stem and bedstraw/cleaver are also present at
Roitsch (Fritz 1992:4, 9; see Tables 35 and 36, this
article), the potential use of puccoon/gromwell as
a cane dye should be noted.
Some species of cleaver were also used among
native peoples to produce a red dye as well as
medicine (Erichsen-Brown 1979:267-268, 336,
338). Galium and Lithospermum are occasionally
reported at Caddo sites. For instance, Lithospermum sp. seed beads were placed around the neck
of one of the Early Caddo burials in Feature 134 at
the George C. Davis site (41CE19) on the Neches
River (Story 1997:22). Galium was also present
at the Ray site. Cleaver and cane were present
in numerous flotation samples from the Copple
Mound at the Spiro site in eastern Oklahoma (Fritz
1989:66-69, 79). Lithospermum has also been
reported at the Hays Mound (3CL6) in Arkansas,
which dates to approximately A.D. 1100-1300
(Cutler and Blake 1973:11).
Uncharred Seeds
As uncharred seeds have a poor chance of
long-term preservation, they are generally considered modern contaminants (Minnis 1981:143-150).
However, modern seeds may indicate changes in
vegetation from that which surrounded the prehistoric site. Eighty-seven fresh seeds were present in
13 (86.7 percent) of the 15 Ray samples from the
1992 field season. One uncharred seed was present in one (12.5 percent) sample from the Roitsch
site. None occurred in the Fasken samples. These
uncharred seeds’ taxa are listed in Table 43. In
addition to fresh seeds, uncharred branchlet fragments of juniper (Juniperus sp.) occurred in 23
(82.1 percent) of the 28 1992 flotation samples. The
uncharred juniper fragments are also considered
modern contaminants that were probably blown in
during excavation of the units.
Chenopodium occurred in both charred and
uncharred forms within the combined 1991 and
1992 Ray and Roitsch samples. However, all
of the Chenopodium from the Ray samples are
fresh and considered modern intrusions. On the

charred and occur with other common prehistoric
seed types (Fritz 1992:Table 4). The one charred
spurge (Euphorbia cf. maculata) removed from
a Fasken sample (Fritz 1992:Table 4; see Table
37, this article) is not matched by any of the 50
uncharred spurge seeds (Euphorbia cf. capitalus)
that are considered to be modern contaminants in
three features at Ray.

DISCUSSION
As the archeobotanical data base grows,
archeologists expect to achieve a broader understanding of man and plant interactions within the
Red River Caddo subsistence system. Although
the flotation samples from the 1992 field season

have not provided the depth of information about
local or regional plant use that was sought, they
have furnished some supplemental data on the Ray
and Roitsch sites. Unfortunately, the five samples
from post holes within Fasken did not provide any
charred plant materials. The new data from Ray
and Roitsch, however, do bear on observations and
issues raised by Fritz (1992, see also this article)
after she analyzed charred archeobotanical remains
from the 1991 field season.
During the 1991 field season, maize was excavated from a pit (Feature 2) at the Ray site (see
Table 36). Artifacts from the site and a uncorrected
radiocarbon date of A.D. 740 + 90 from a pit (Feature 2) suggested to Bruseth and Banks (1992)
that the maize was associated with a Woodland
period occupation (Fritz 1992:7). This situation is
significant, because it suggested that the maize in

456

Texas Archeological Society

Feature 2 may be some of the earliest grown in the
region. However, Fritz (1992:7, 8, 12) presented a
case against making such an assumption without the
direct dating of the Feature 2 corn. Her concern involved the observation that no maize was present in
any of the other three features (a pit and two hearths)
at Ray represented by the 1991 flotation samples.
In addition, the cupule width range and mean
for Feature 2 are comparable with those for later
Caddo contexts (see Fritz, this article). Therefore,
gathering additional information about the ubiquity,
abundance, morphology, and age of the maize at the
Ray site was a priority in selecting the 1992 field
season’s flotation samples In fact, as Bruseth et al.
(2001: Table 11) indicate, directly dated maize from
Feature 2 now has calibrated 1-sigma date ranges of
AD 1000-1040 and AD 1035-1205.
When the data from both field seasons are combined, the ubiquity of charcoal, nutshell, charred
seeds, and maize for features at the Ray and
Roitsch sites remains essentially unchanged from
those of the 1991 samples alone. However, maize
from one additional feature (Feature 37) within the
Ray site was found in two 1992 field season flotation samples. The maize from this feature is contemporaneous with the Feature 2 maize (Bruseth et
al. 2001: Table 11). The ubiquity of maize within
total samples from Ray is only 15 percent for the
combined field seasons. However, as 60 percent of
the combined fractions came from Feature 1, which
had yielded no maize remains, a more accurate
picture may be formed by looking at the presence
of corn within the total number of features sampled
by flotation. Maize was present in 28.6 percent of
the total combined features sampled at Ray. Maize
and charred seeds of wild plants were present in an
equal number (n=2) of features at Ray, and thus
they are equally ubiquitous among the features.
However, maize and wild seeds were not present
in the same features. Maize, because of its durability, was less likely to be underrepresented in the
features than the seeds of wild plants.
When one combines both field seasons’ flotation data, one finds that Roitsch has a substantially
higher maize ubiquity than Ray. While Ray values
are only 15 percent for total samples and 28.6
percent for features, those values for Roitsch are
58.8 percent and 75 percent, respectively. The
presence of maize in six (75 percent) of the eight
features sampled at the Roitsch site approaches
that of Spoonbill (41WD109). Spoonbill, an Early
to Middle Caddo period site located about 150 km

southwest of Roitsch, provides one of the better
documented botanical assemblages for a Caddo site
in Northeast Texas. Maize was present in five (83.3
percent) of the six features (pits) flotation-sampled
at Spoonbill (Perttula et al. 1982:91, 93).
The percentages of sampled features with
maize at Roitsch and Spoonbill compare closely
to the range (70.8-92.4 percent) for three Emergent Mississippian (A.D. 800-1000) floodplain
sites extensively examined in the archeological
study of the American Bottom in Illinois (Bareis
and Porter 1984; Johannessen 1984:197-214). In
the American Bottom, maize first becomes common during the Emergent Mississippian period
(Johannessen 1984:203). For that study, “common” is defined as occurring in 50 percent or
more of the features analyzed for that component
(Johannessen 1984:203). From this perspective,
maize is common at Roitsch and Spoonbill, but
not at the Ray site. In the American Bottom study,
two floodplain sites for the Late Woodland (A.D.
300-A.D. 800, the cultural period just prior to the
Emergent Mississippian), have less than 6.5 percent of the features containing maize (Johannessen 1984:204 and Table 12). The 6.5 percent value
actually represents only one cupule with attached
glumes from one feature (Johannessen 1984:203).
None of the seven upland sites in the American
Bottom studied from the Late Woodland period
have any maize at all (Johannessen 1984:204 and
Table 12).
Another site with well-documented botanical recovery is the Bohannon site (34HU61) in
Hughes County, Oklahoma. Bohannon is approximately 120 km north of the Red River sites
under discussion herein. The artifact assemblage
and radiocarbon dates indicate that Bohannon has
Caddo affiliations and dates roughly between A.D.
1000 and A.D. 1300 (Charles Wallis, 1986 personal
communication). Bohannon appears to be a base
camp with either a long-term or recurrent occupation (Goldborer 1991:173) contemporary with
the earlier component (i.e., before the substantial
McCurtain phase occupation dating after A.D.
1300) at Roitsch and much of the Spoonbill occupation. Despite the relatively good preservation
of organic matter at Bohannon and the intensive
effort to recover it, only two (3.2 percent) of the 62
features investigated were associated with maize
(Goldborer 1988:1,18-19). Such a low presence of
maize within the site features implies that its use
was low (cf. Pearsall 1989:212).

Perttula—The Archeology of the Roitsch Site (41RR16) 457
The Bohannon inhabitants could have represented
hinterland Caddo populations not fully integrated
with groups living along the Red River possessing
the more elaborate Caddo cultural characteristics
(Goldborer 1991:175). One explanation for the
low usage of corn at Bohannon when reliance
was growing in other areas is discussed elsewhere
(Goldborer 1991:171-183). The important point here
is that, if the presence of maize in 3.2 percent or 6.5
percent of a site’s features represents little use and
levels at Roitsch (75 percent) and Spoonbill (83.3
percent) represent “common” use, then the level of
maize ubiquity at Ray (28.6 percent) would seem to
indicate something beyond incipient use, yet not a
level of “common” usage.
From this perspective, the ubiquity of maize
within features supports the idea that Ray represents a lower level of acceptance of corn horticulture into the prehistoric Caddo subsistence system
than does either the Roitsch and Spoonbill flotation
data. If the corn from Ray and Roitsch does represent plant remains from sequent occupations, then a
regional trend towards maize farming had begun to
emerge earlier than has been previously accepted.
In the less likely event that the maize at Ray should
prove to be contemporary with the Caddo period
sites, then Ray, like the Bohannon site, may represent circumstances that were either different or
marginal to those occurring at regional sites where
corn appears to have been “common.”
Fritz (1992:7, see also Fritz, this article) found
that the Feature 2 corn from Ray was comparable
with that from later Caddo contexts. Finding maize
in additional features at Ray could provide additional data on its morphology and ubiquity. Another
opportunity for confirming the early presence of
maize at Ray would also be available. Three whole
cupules were preserved in the samples from Feature 37. While not abundant, this maize does offer
an additional opportunity to compare the size of
cupules from Ray with that of other regional sites
believed to date to a later time period; the maize
from Feature 37 has a 1-sigma calibrated age range
of AD 1045-1220, see Bruseth et al. 2001: Table
11). Table 42 places the maize that was recovered
from all sites excavated during both field seasons in
order by mean cupule width per feature. The mean
widths of cupules from Ray clearly fall into the
range of means from the other regional Red River
Field School samples, all of which are considered
later occupations. Therefore, the 1992 paleobotanical data further support Fritz’s (this article) finding

that there is a similar morphology of corn at Ray,
that may belong to an earlier cultural period, and
maize from the other sites that were sampled.
In addition, the mean width/internode ratios (see
Table 42) indicate the presence of an eight-rowed
corn at all five of the Red River sites excavated
during the 1991 and 1992 field seasons. The
maize cupules from the Red River sites, like those
from the Davis site (41CE19) (Jones 1949) and
Spiro (34LF46) (Fritz 1989), tend to have smaller
widths than those from other eastern regions where
eight-rowed corn is present (Adair 1990:1-12 and
Table 2; Blake and Cutler 1979:54; Cutler and
Blake 1973). Galinat (1985:267) has suggested that
the smaller eight-rowed ear bearing small kernels
present in the prehistoric southeastern United States
may not have developed from the large kerneled
Maiz de Ocho of the Southwest, but rather from a
more primitive Mexican ancestor. In the last several
decades, researchers have made continuous progress
toward understanding the evolution of maize, and
unraveling the relationship of maize races (Benz
1986; Benz and Itlis 1992; Sanchez-G and Goodman 1992; Staller et al. 2006; Zeder et al. 2006).
Such research may ultimately lead to determining
the biological origin of the earliest prehistoric maize
in Texas. In order to understand the geographical
and cultural pathways through which the smaller
eight-rowed corn spread across the Caddo region,
measurements should be reported for existing maize
assemblages such as those documented for Spoonbill and Steck (41WD529) (Perttula et al 1982:93,
95) as well as for new collections.

SUMMARY
A relatively small amount of charred botanical remains were recovered from the 1992 TAS
flotation samples. Nevertheless, these materials
provide supplemental data to those gathered from
the 1991 field season samples, as earlier discussed
by Fritz. They help to build a regional Caddo subsistence data base. The new data reflects the use
of oak wood, nutshell (i.e. hickory and walnut),
and maize. In addition, three types of charred
seeds that might be the result of human use were
recovered. Two of the three seeds could represent
food or possible medicinal use. However, the
presence of cleaver at both Ray (see Table 40)
and Roitsch (see Table 37) as well as cleaver’s
association with cane (see Tables 35 and 37) and

458

Texas Archeological Society

gromwell (see Table 40) at Roitsch suggests its
possible use as dye for decoration.
When the data on maize for both field seasons
are combined, they indicate a similar small
eight-rowed corn at both Ray and Roitsch. However,
the feature ubiquity of maize indicates a different
level of use between the two sites. The level of use at
Ray appears to be beyond an incipient stage, without
having attained a level of “common” usage. On the
other hand, maize use at Roitsch seems to have been
“common.” This similarity of maize types at both
sites, contrasting with different levels of use, serves
to reemphasize the need to resolve the date for maize
at the Ray site. In an attempt to confirm whether or
not the maize at Ray is associated with a Woodland
period occupation, charred maize from Feature 2 and
Feature 37 were submitted for radiocarbon dating
(James Bruseth, 1995 personal communication; see
Bruseth et al. 2001). The results indicate that the
maize from the Ray site dates to the Formative and
Middle Caddo periods.
Confirmation for the age of maize at Ray
should help to elucidate the diachronic pattern of
regional subsistence. However, even without such
clarification the botanical remains from the Red
River sites have improved the regional subsistence
data base. These data make an important contribution
to our knowledge of the geographical distribution
of a small eight-rowed corn variety that has been
documented for the Davis site and Spiro, and that
may have a different origin than Maiz de Ocho.

and Ray (41LR135) sites, commentary on the ecological and economic aspects that are suggested by
the identified taxa, and descriptions of butchering
patterns and modified bone.
Eighty-two percent of the recorded faunal
remains were recovered from the Roitsch site
(41RR16), mainly from the cemetery area and
Blocks III and IV in the McCurtain phase village
(Table 44). The Ray site (41LR135) generated
the next largest assemblage primarily as a result
of excellent preservation, given the small extent
of excavations conducted at the site in 1991 (see
Bruseth et al. 2001). Unfortunately, poor preservation of bone was the culprit responsible for paltry
quantities of faunal remains from Fasken Mounds
(41RR14), and surface exposure accounted for low
recoveries from the survey sites and Jonesborough
(41RR15), as well. Salt Well Slough (41RR204),
however, has the potential of yielding well preserved
faunal remains due to the clayey matrix there. Considering how difficult excavation was at that site,
the quantity of bone that was recovered is high, and
the overall condition of the bone is good. Analysis
of the Salt Well Slough material has been hampered
however, by the time-consuming and labor-intensive
need to re-wash the bones in order to remove the
inevitable clay “slip” that was left on the bones
after initial treatment in the field lab. Therefore, the
remainder of this section will focus on the faunal
remains from the Roitsch and Ray sites.

METHODS
OBSERVATIONS ON THE FAUNAL
REMAINS FROM THE 1991 FIELD
SCHOOL ON THE RED RIVER IN
RED RIVER COUNTY, TEXAS
Bonnie C. Yates
INTRODUCTION
More than 10,000 fragments of animal bone
were recovered by excavators from five sites during the 1991 Texas Archeological Society (TAS)
Field School in Lamar and Red River counties,
Texas. In addition, approximately 65 fragments
were collected during surveys associated with the
Field School. This section will document the initial
analysis of these faunal remains by providing an
inventory of recorded specimens (Appendix VII
and VIII, this article) from the Roitsch (41RR16)

Standard zooarcheological methods have been
used. The animal bone was washed and sorted in
the TAS field lab and submitted for identification
and quantification. Provenience was rigorously
maintained. Unidentified fragments were divided
into unburned and burned categories and counted.
Attributes of identified elements were recorded as
taxon, body part, side of body, element portion,
age, condition (burning), modification, and taphonomic appearance.
Quantification of the faunal assemblages have
been summarized as minimum number of identified
specimens per taxon (NISP) and a minimum number
of individuals (MNI) for identified elements. MNI
estimates were calculated according to the most
frequent element, based on symmetry and element
portion (Munzel 1986) and then determined by
adapting Grayson’s (1978) minimum distinction

method. Other considerations in determining MNI
include age (based on dental eruption/occlusal
wear) and/or epiphyseal fusion, and also on the
relative sizes of otherwise analogous specimens in
the comparative collection.
Species identifications were made in the field
lab in the fairgrounds of Idabel, Oklahoma, by the
author, Mr. Bill McClure, Mr. Brian Shaffer, and
Ms. LeeAnna Schniebs. Further identifications were
made by the author and others in the Zooarchaeology Laboratory at the University of North Texas,
with occasional recourse to standard osteological

keys such as Olsen (1960, 1964, 1968), Gilbert et
al. (1981), Hillson (1986), and Sisson and Grossman
(1953). Only positive identifications resulted in assigning elements to genus or species.
The attributes of each specimen were coded for
computerization. Data manipulation was enhanced
by using FACS, a vertebrate faunal analysis coding
system developed by Shaffer and Baker (1992).
Although this flexible, dBase-based, system had
been involved in several analyses during its development, the TAS Field School was the first time it
had been used in the field. And because there were

460

Texas Archeological Society

computers present at the Field School, the data
were input daily, and various types of summary
information could then be made available to the
site directors during the ongoing excavations.
Elements of non-diagnostic skeletal value (e.g.,
ribs and long bone shafts; see Olsen 1961) have been
coded by the estimated size of the most likely taxon.
For example, in what is called a “indeterminate large
mammal” category, these specimens are considered
to be in the size range of pigs, cattle, or horses.
Recording these bones in a size category allows as
fine a level of observation as the specimen permits:
otherwise, the specimen would be considered
unidentifiable (i.e., Vertebrata). In small samples,
noting size categories of non-diagnostic elements
broadens the utility of the bone assemblage. The
“medium/large mammal” category accommodates
skeletal elements that are the size equable to deer,
but which are damaged or too incomplete to be
assigned firmly to order (Artiodactyla), genus
(Odocoileus), or species (O. virginianus).
Study Area
Red River and Lamar counties of Northeast
Texas are located at the western edge of Blair’s
(1950) Austroriparian biotic province within the
drainage basin of the Red River upstream of that
river’s Great Bend. Historically, this area is characterized as a pine and hardwood forest dotted with
prairie remnants and oxbow ponds and sloughs.
According to Blair (1950:99), the Austroriparian
biotic province of Texas contains at least 47 mammals, 29 species of snakes, 10 species of lizards,
two terrestrial turtles, and 35 amphibians. While
Blair infers that bird life in the biotic provinces of
Texas in beyond the scope of his study, the estimate
must be between 280 and 450 species of birds, because of the area’s diverse habitat and its location
along the Central Flyway.
The Woodland to Late Caddo hunters seemingly then would have had a plethora of wildlife
to exploit. But what the numbers fail to indicate
is how difficult it would have been to procure the
vast majority of these resources. At least half of the
mammalian class represented in Blair’s account are
tiny bats, mice, or insectivores. Likely the same
is true for the reptiles and amphibians. Thus, the
hunters are left to take those resources that provide
ample return for their expended energy.
Carnivores, such as bear, panther, bobcat,
wolf, coyote, otter and other weasels, are generally

under-represented in archeological assemblages,
perhaps due to an ideological proscription against
these hunting competitors. Such cunning, adversarial animals were often totemic to Native American
groups and would be killed or consumed in restrictive ceremonial contexts. Swanton (1942:134-135)
mentions pre-hunt rituals involving the staple
meat source of deer and ceremonial consumption
of domestic or hybrid dogs, the “jubines,” but he
gathered no data on any ritualism regarding bear.
In fact, bear fat and bear hunting are consistently
mentioned as routine subsistence activities in the
17th and 18th centuries among the Caddo (see
Swanton 1942), although bear bones are rarely
found in archeological sites.
A review of the literature of Formative to Late
Caddo period sites in Northeast Texas indicates
10 taxa that are consistently represented in faunal remains recovered in archeological contexts:
white-tailed deer, tree squirrels (Sciuridae), rabbits
(Lagomorpha), beaver (Castor canadensis), opossum (Didelphis virginiana), raccoon (Procyon lotor), turkey (Meleagris gallopavo), turtles (Emydidae), freshwater drum (Aplodinotus grunniens), and
catfishes (Ictaluridae) (Butler 1974, 1975; Henderson 1978a, 1978b, 1982; Parmalee and Bogan 1981;
Parmalee and Opperman 1983; Yates 1988a, 1988b,
1999). The taxa lists from these reports contain additional animals that undoubtedly provided meat and
fur resources to peoples inhabiting the Austroriparian province; some of the more important species
(from an ethnological or ecological point of view)
will also be discussed herein.
White-tailed Deer
By virtue of their diverse adaptability and
reproductive success, deer has been an important
food resource for human through the ages. They
also provided raw material for clothing, shelter, and tools. Although deer are available year
round, individuals or small parties of Omaha
hunted deer usually in the winter when the deer
were in good condition (Fletcher and La Flesche
1911:270-271). Other mid-continental natives
employed various tactics to bring down this prey
item. The Chippewa had several techniques for
hunting deer, such as the use of pitch torches and
deer calls. Deer were attracted to the light of a
pitch torch and to the sound of an instrument producing a sound similar to that emitted by a fawn
(Densmore 1929:128-129). Swanton (1942:136)

Perttula—The Archeology of the Roitsch Site (41RR16) 461
cites two diarists who depict a ritual used before
a deer hunt by the Caddo that involved placing a
preserved head of a deer on a post of the hunter’s
door and reciting prayers for a successful hunt,
painting their bodies, and. using deer antlers as
decoys during the hunt.
Tree Squirrels
This taxa consists of the fox squirrel and the
gray squirrel, both of which inhabit the Austroriparian province. The gray squirrel is restricted to
heavily wooded streams, and the fox squirrel
prefers the upland forests. However, within their
ranges both species can occur together (Bee et al.
1981:96-101; W. B. Davis 1974:158-162; Jones
et al. 1985:163, 166). Ethnographic data indicates
that tree squirrels are listed as a food resource of
the Omaha (Fletcher and La Flesche 1911:104).
The tail of the black (fox) squirrel was used to
decorate the moccasins of young Osage men, and
small Osage boys hunted squirrels with blunted
dogwood arrows (Mathews 1961:20, 448). No
specific mention regarding the historic Caddo use
of squirrel was found. The bones found in archeological contexts of Caddo sites, however, are often
burned and found to exhibit consistent breakage
patterns in the long bones. Other squirrel remains
may be incidental, having been preyed upon by the
domestic dogs kept by the Caddo.
Rabbits
There are three sizes of rabbits that would
have been available to Caddo hunters: jackrabbit,
swamp rabbit, and cottontail. The swamp rabbit
(Sylvilagus aquaticus) probably goes unrecognized
in some archeological assemblages because its
intermediate size might appear to overlap the upper and lower registers of the other Lagomorphs.
It does, however, have some specific diagnostic
characteristics on several individual elements that
aid in distinguishing it from the other two (e.g.,
malar bone configuration and protuberances on the
innominate, etc.). All three appear to be present in
most of these Caddo sites.
Ethnographic accounts of rabbit hunting are
pandemic. The Omaha used headless arrows with
sharpened shafts for hunting rabbits (Fletcher and
La Flesche 1911:451).The Chippewa caught rabbits
in snares and prepared the carcasses two ways: (a)
the meat was removed from the bones, roasted and

pounded. The bones were then pounded with what
meat remained on them. The pounded bones were
boiled in a small kettle and the grease skimmed off
and eaten with the pounded meat; and (b) the meat
was cut in pieces and dried, the bones being dried
also. The bones were pounded to a powder and
mixed with the dry meat and any available grease.
This was eaten dry, and not boiled at the time of
using (Densmore 1929:44).
Caddo women used rabbit skins dyed red for tying their hair behind their heads (Espinosa 1927:177).
Newcomb (1961:139) notes that the Tonkawa, dreaded enemy of the historic Caddo, ate rabbits along with
rodents, skunks, and land tortoises.
Beaver
America’s largest rodent, it inhabits permanent bodies of water, which it either creates by
damming streams and living in bough dens, or in
creeks and rivers where it burrows into soft banks.
Beavers are abundant along watercourses on the
Plains, where their preferred foods—cottonwoods
and willows—are plentiful (Davis 1974:188-190;
Hall and Kelson 1959:547, Jones et al. 1985:194;
Schwartz and Schwartz 1981:174-181).
Historical accounts do not reveal how the Caddo
traditionally hunted or used the beaver. Other groups
of mid-continental Indians participated in the trapping of beaver for the fur trade for almost 300 years
(ca. A.D. l550-1840). Their traditional uses of this
valuable fur-bearers may shed insight into how the
Caddo might have dealt with beaver. For example,
Tonkawa men occasionally tied their hair with
beaver fur (Newcomb 1961:138). The Chippewa
trapped beaver for its tail, which was considered
a great delicacy because of its high fat content
(Densmore 1929:44). The Osage hunted beaver
for meat and pelts (La Flesche 1932:221; Mathews
1961:447). Prior to the appearance of Euro-Americans, the Cheyenne used dogs to hunt beaver for
food and clothing (Grinnell 1923:295-296).
Opossum
A nocturnal animal, the opossum could be
easily killed if encountered at night or trapped
in a snare. They occupy a wide range of wooded
habitats, upland or bottomland, and provide about
one kg of edible meat. Opossums were probably
hunted by the prehistoric Caddos for food and
pelts, as was done by historic groups, such as the

462

Texas Archeological Society

Osage (La Flesche 1932:30) and Omaha (Fletcher
and La Flesche 1911:104).
Raccoon
Raccoon are omnivores and therefore can be
found in a variety of habitats usually exploited
in seasonal rounds (Smith 1975:42). Henderson
(1982:143) notes that in winter and spring they can
be found in wooded floodplains where they avail
themselves of acorns and crayfish; in summer and
fall, they would be found dispersed in the uplands
where they eat plums, berries, and insects. At nearly
any time they could be encountered at pond shores
or near creeks eating mussels. Like the opossum,
the raccoon is primarily nocturnal, but might be encountered at dawn and dusk. Ethnographic accounts
exist of the use of this valuable fur-bearer by other
historic Plains peoples, such as the Omaha (Fletcher
and La Flesche 1911:104), Pawnee (Weltfish
1977:155, 376), and Osage (La Flesche 1932:91)
strongly suggest similar predation by the Caddo.
Turkey
According to Smith (1975:77-78), turkeys are
known to use a variety of habitats during seasonal
feeding rounds. Meanley (1956) studied flocks
along Mississippi River tributaries in southeastern
Arkansas and found them congregated in winter
and spring along terrace ridges feeding on mast;
in summer and fall, they can be found in the vegetated areas around oxbow lakes and sandbars. The
formation of large flocks in the fall is controlled
to a degree by the availability of acorn and other
mast (Bull and Farrand 1977:631-632; Johnsgard
1979:125; Martin et al. 1951:107-108).
Schorger (1966) includes details of Indian and
pioneer hunting techniques ranging from shooting
into roosting flock to the use of snares and traps.
Most of Schorger’s accounts deal with fall-winter
hunts. The Caddo employed turkey head decoys
when hunting these birds (Swanton 1942:135-136).
Some other Southeastern groups used fire or dogs
when hunting turkeys. The birds were either roasted or boiled when prepared by the Caddo (Swanton
1946:329-330, 369).
Turtles
Turtle shell fragment. often seem ubiquitous,
almost background “noise,” in zooarcheological

assemblages. While it is true that one should
expect large quantities of shell fragments because
of their propensity of breaking into ever-smaller,
though recognizable, fragments, the astounding
fact remains that in some assemblages there are
multiple genera present, not just one or two crushed
individuals, but sometimes as many as five or six.
Then it appears that actually there is not enough
shell to accommodate the number of individuals
represented. This has been the case in several
prehistoric Caddo sites examined by the author.
The point, therefore, is that prehistoric peoples of
East Texas actively hunted (or gathered) turtles,
including them in their diets not as a passive food
resource, but deliberately, and it would seem
enthusiastically.
Box turtles seem to be the most abundant of
the turtles used by the Caddo, perhaps because
of the ease of capturing these slow-moving terrestrial reptiles. The population density for box
turtles may be one per km2 (Henderson 1982:143)
in Texas. The presence of burned shell fragments
suggests box turtles were cooked in their shells
and consumed as food resources. In addition, their
shells may have been a source of raw material for
tools and ornaments (e.g., carapace bowls, shell
rattles, etc.). Although box turtles may have been
easy to obtain by simply picking them up when
observed, special techniques were probably necessary to procure the aquatic species. However,
some may have been caught when they ventured
onto land to nest. Soft-shell turtles are difficult
to catch because they can swim and walk fast
and their shells are slippery, making them hard
to hold. Currently, though, soft-shell and slider
turtles are captured with a hook and line (Hudson 1942:101) and a similar technique may have
been used prehistorically. The Cheyenne used a
variety of methods for obtaining aquatic turtles by
hand (Grinnell 1923, Vol. I:307-308). Some were
caught as they came to the surface to breathe:
“sometimes when turtles were abundant, and only
one or two men or boys were together, they tied
grass and willows about their heads, and very
slowly approaching a turtle at the surface, put the
hands under it and caught it” (Grinnell 1923, Vol.
I:308). The underwater locations of turtles were
discerned by long lines of people wading in the
water and feeling for the submerged turtles with
their feet. The turtles were grasped by hand as
they tried to escape or as they were held in place
by the hunter’s feet.

Freshwater Drum
These fish can attain lengths of 80 cm, thus
providing up to 60 pounds of edible flesh. It inhabits soft, muddy bottoms of rivers, creeks, and lakes
where it feeds almost entirely on mollusks (Smith
1975:54). Its flat-topped grinding pharyngeal teeth
and large otoliths are diagnostic and preserve well
in most archeological contexts. Because they are
bottom-feeders, they are difficult to catch with a
hook and line, but they can become easily stranded
in backwater areas when floodwaters subside (Henderson 1982:144). The flesh of this species is firm
but the taste is good (Kemp 1971:19). Prehistoric
peoples procured drum by using nets and/or spears.
The Caddo preserved fish by smoking the flesh
(Newcomb 1961:294).

trot lines, hooks and lines, and drags (Swanton
1946:332-344). The “Creeks sometimes dragged
brush about in a pool of water until it became so
muddy that the fish came to the surface for air,
when they were shot with arrows or speared”
(Swanton 1946:343). It is probable that a variety
of fishing techniques were employed by the Caddo
inhabitants of the middle Red River area.
The above accounts concern just a few of the
many faunal resources procured by Native American groups. Many other fishes and birds, reptiles,
and mammals constitute taxa lists of recovered
animal remains in good archeological contexts
and are presumed to represent food resources for
these people. The Roitsch and Ray sites provide
additional data toward the reconstruction of the
dietary habits of prehistoric Native Americans who
lived in Northeast Texas.

Catfishes
This is a large family of fishes with species
ranging in size from a few inches to five feet in
length. The medium-size species, notably channel catfish (Ictalurus punctatus), seem to be the
most representative of this family in archeological
sites. Being taxonomically primitive, this group
has robust skeletal features that are noticeable and
easily avoided when eating the flesh. Prehistorically, young catfish of the medium and large species (e.g., Ictalurus natalis and Pylodictis olivacis)
would have been easy to trap in nets and/or to spear
while in shallow water. They may also have been
caught on hooks.
During spawning, large fish congregate in
shallow water near the shore. At these times, it
was probably feasible to spear the fish (Parmalee
et al. 1976). The Cheyenne caught fish in willow
nets. They also trapped fish in pounds or pens
made of willow saplings (Grinnell 1923, Vol. I:
309-310). It was also possible to obtain fish when
water levels lowered in rivers and streams. During
these periods, fish became concentrated in smaller,
shallower areas and were probably caught by hand.
Large, bottom feeders were stranded in deep holes
and became easy prey. The Pawnee took fish in this
way. They preferred catfish, often fishing with a
decorticated willow stick mat (Weltfish 1977:231).
The Omaha sometimes shot or speared fish. They
also used a movable weir of willows to drive fish
into shallow water where the fish could then be
shot, speared, or caught by hand (Fletcher and La
Flesche 1911:312). In addition to these methods,
various Southeastern groups also used poison,

RESULTS OF THE FAUNAL
ANALYSES
Roitsch Site (41RR16)
Formerly called the Sam Kaufman site, a sample of faunal remains from this site was examined
by the author at Southern Methodist University
(SMU) prior to the 1991 TAS Field School. This
was done to determine the degree of preservation
of animal bone from the site; consequently, some
estimate was obtained regarding the recovery potential of faunal remains and the kinds of animals
that could be expected from the TAS excavations.
The recovery of these specimens currently in
curation at SMU occurred in 1968 (Skinner et al.
1969). Animal remains constitute two paragraphs in
this report, one on mollusks and one on deer bone
(Skinner et al. 1969:105). Artifacts made from
shell and bone were reported from burial goods,
and consist of numerous beads made from freshwater mussel, shell gorgets, zoomorphic pendants
and inlays from conch columella, and two drilled
bear tooth pendants from Burial 11. Skinner et al.
(1969:104) note the association of these artifacts
with the late manifestations of the Southern Cult
or Southeastern Ceremonial Complex that had also
been found at the Belcher, Foster, and Friday sites
on the Red River in southwestern Arkansas and
northwestern Louisiana, citing Webb (1959) and
Waring and Holder (1945) as authorities on those
sites and similar artifacts.

My examination of the faunal remains from
the SMU excavations also noted the preponderance
of deer bone, but many other species were present.
Squirrel and rabbit were particularly abundant, and
a few bovid-size bones were present. Unfortunately,
the exact provenience and circumstances of the
bovid bones leaves the question of bison hunting
unanswered; these remains compared favorably with
modern cattle and may be incidental to the archeological components. Some isolated canid remains
could represent additional dog burials (although
none was recognized in the SMU work), or even
dogs as ceremonial food refuse. Throughout the
boxes containing animal bone were isolated human
remains, indicating probable mixture of sediments
and burial disturbance (or possibly cannibalism,
although no human bones showed cut marks).
The most striking contrast between this early
collection and the present study is the degree of
fragmentation. In the SMU collection, the bones
are extremely well preserved and, while most are
broken, they are in the main large, spirally fractured
fragments. In some cases, whole and nearly whole
leg bones from nine individual deer were recovered
from a single provenience (somewhere in the midden at the East mound). Fragmentation is extremely
high in the 1991 TAS assemblage, by contrast.
Only 158 specimens of the 1991 TAS sample
were complete, and these consist primarily of
singular teeth, toes, or podials, which are all very
durable and resilient to destruction. Of the 8,496 elements analyzed from the 1991 TAS Field School,
4,569 were capable of being spirally fractured.
Of the 4,569, only 453 (10 percent) were actually
spirally fractured. The majority of the sample was
lightly weathered (6,627 or 78 percent), although
3,490 (41 percent) of the sample was burned.
Tables 45 and 46 provide data on breakage and
burning patterns for the different taxa: these data
show which taxa exhibit spirally fractured remains
and different degrees of burning. At least 451
specimens (5 percent) of the analyzed sample has
been rodent gnawed, and 23 specimens exhibit cut
marks. A total of 1,035 (12 percent) specimens
were identifiable to the level of Order or below.
Table 47 lists the animals represented in the
Roitsch faunal sample from the 1991 Field School.
These taxa indicate exploitation by the site’s
inhabitants of a variety of ecological niches: aquatic
(e.g., fishes, water turtles); woodland (opossum,
squirrel, woodrat, bear), woodland edge (deer,
rabbits, striped skunk, raccoon, box turtle, etc.);

and grassland species (jackrabbits, spotted skunks,
coyotes, gophers, and cotton rats). Surprisingly
absent are traces of the exploitation of large fishes
and large aquatic turtles, water fowl, and common
riparian mammals such as beaver, muskrat, otter,
and mink.
Woodland animals and edge habitat dwellers
constitute the dominant faunal resources represented in the bone samples from Roitsch. Deer,
bear, raccoon, and turkey provided the majority of
meat protein apparent in these samples (Table 48).
Even though bear bones are present in the assemblage, it would appear that these large animals were
not brought back to the site for initial processing.
Although pig is listed in Table 47, its provenience
(from a surface collection in the terrace area)
indicates that it is intrusive from historic times;
likewise, the bovid bones are ambiguous and may
also be from domestic cattle. This is not to deny
bison a role in the subsistence of the Roitsch inhabitants; however, if bison meat was procured, it was
performed in such a way that few bison bones were
returned to the site. Pronghorn antelope are known
from other Caddo assemblages in the general region (see Henderson 1978a, 1978b), but here again,
no definitive pronghorn remains were identified in
the Roitsch sample. These observations, therefore,
support the importance of the woodland habitat to
the Caddo hunters and inhabitants of this site.
By virtue of MNI and NISP, it is deer that
supported the meat portion of the inhabitants’
diets. Table 49 indicates that teeth, metapodials,
and phalanges dominate the recovered deer elements, which is to be expected given the durability
of those skeletal parts. They are also considered
butchering waste because there is not much meat
around them; therefore, they are rarely processed
for grease and got tossed out as refuse and most
likely covered with dirt to discourage unwanted
scavengers or insects, thus additionally enhancing
their preservation.
Dogs were important to the site’s inhabitants as
hunting companions, sentries, and garbage disposers. They may be the principal agent responsible for
the destruction of meaty element butchering waste.
Five dogs were recovered from four dog burials
during the Field School excavations. Three of the
burials were located adjacent (west) to the human
cemetery area investigated during the 1991 Field
School (see discussion of Terrace Area excavations,
this article). The first dog burial from the cemetery
was damaged by plowing activities, which rendered

the skeleton too fragile to be removed except in a
block. It lay curled up on its left side facing southwest. No pit outline was observed.
The second dog burial was that of a puppy
tightly curled up on its right side, again facing
southerly. Its exact age has not been determined
because of its delicate condition, but it conforms
in skeletal development to a 6-week-old pup. Additional tooth buds were found in the surrounding
matrix, suggesting more than one puppy in the
burial. At this writing, the block in which the puppy
was found is still intact pending X-ray analysis; the
analysts are loath to immerse the block in water,
thereby losing the details of the burial pose.
The third dog burial turned out to be a superimposed double burial. The outstretched leg of the
later interment indicates a difference in disposal
ritual due either to temporal or ritualistic changes

toward those domiciliary companions. Severa1
large shell-tempered sherds were found mixed in
with the dog bones.
Another dog was found buried in the Block IV
excavations. It was in excellent condition, and its
skull was adequately intact for cranial measurements. It was also found on its left side, tightly
flexed, with its face toward the south. A small
ceramic sherd was found near its right eye.
Only the dog from Block IV and the first dog
burial from the cemetery (Feature 701) were intact
enough for metric analysis. A comparison was
made of cranial measurements from other Caddo
dog burials, and this indicated that the Caddo dogs
cluster very closely morphologically. Contrasts
with coyote (open triangles in Figure 79) show that
while coyotes overlap within the range of Canis familiaris metrics, they seem to have slightly longer

Perttula—The Archeology of the Roitsch Site (41RR16) 475
snouts and smaller braincases. Swanton (1942:137)
cites Morfi as commenting:
With all of this, they do not forget the
chase, for which they raise a certain
kind of dog they call Jubine, with long,
sharp-pointed snout, and as cunning as its
master (Morfi 1932:44).

And Swanton (1942:134) also mentions Fray de
Solis’ observation about dogs in the Caddo camp:
“they have...some dogs also which they call jubines
because they are a mixture of dog and coyote or
wolf. These dogs are very intelligent and cunning
as well as great thieves; they have thin pointed
snouts” (Solis 1931:61).
Two canid teeth were found with drilled holes.
One was from Burial 27, which also produced a
drilled bison tooth, probably on the same necklace
or garment. These decorative items are just a few

assemblage. Twenty fragments exhibited either
cut marks from butchering or meal preparation
or they showed striations and/or smoothing from
tool manufacture. All of these fragment are from
deer-sized animals.
Ray Site (41LR135)
Located in Lamar County, some 20 km south of
the Red River, the Ray site contained the remains
of two, or possibly three, overlapping houses from
an occupation thought to have occurred between
ca. A.D. 800-1000 (Bruseth et al. 2001:212),
although there were earlier as well as later occupations at the site. Nineteen percent of the faunal
assemblage has been identified to the level of Order
or below. Thirty-three specimens were complete.
Of the 1,477 specimens recovered during the 1991
TAS Field School, 1,214 were capable of being
spirally fractured. Of the 1,214, 197 (16 percent)

476

Texas Archeological Society

were spirally fractured. Degradation of the specimens included 827 (56 percent) recorded as light,
and 650 (44 percent) that were heavily degraded
(weathering damage, gnawing, root etching, etc.).
This sample was notably burned with 1,002 (68
percent) of the specimens recorded as burned.
Only four specimens exhibited gnawing, and three
specimens had cut marks.
The taxa list (Table 50) is almost one-third
the size of the Roitsch site faunal assemblage. But
considering the small amount of excavation that
was undertaken, it is remarkably diverse. Five of
the important taxa are present, and for two of them,
the Ray site had more individuals represented (i.e.,
Terrapene sp. and Sciurus sp.). For the number of
identified specimens for Odocoileus (n=41, or 12.5
percent that of the Roitsch sample of deer), the
MNI for deer in the Ray assemblage is only one
less than the Roitsch assemblage.
As at the Roitsch site, deer provided the majority of the edible meat (see Table 48). The inventory
for the Ray site faunal remains lists all of the deer
or deer-sized elements recovered from the site (Appendix VIII, this article).
Modified bone from the Ray site includes
three deer-size elements with cut marks: a radius,
a calcaneus, and a long bone fragment. In addition, there are two awls and a highly polished split
astragalus, all probably from deer. One of the awls
is complete, 11.5 cm in length, and appears to have
been made from a deer metapodial. This type of
pointed bone tool is also sometimes referred to as
a hair pin. The cross section of this specimen is
sub-triangular near the basal end and tapers to a
flat cross section at the tip. A series of transverse
parallel scoring marks occur at the base, and wavy
longitudinal scratches cover the shaft. It was recovered from level 5 of Area A. This specimen
closely resembles the hairpin from Feature 1 at the
Bentsen-Clark site (Banks and Winters 1975:21).
A second awl/hairpin tip was also recovered
from level 5 of Area A. Like the other, it is flat in
cross section, tapering to a pointed tip, with wavy
longitudinal striations.

would be expected in the faunal assemblage from
the Caddo occupation. Only 366 elements can be
attributed to aquatic faunas, and these are primarily non-diagnostic turtle shell fragments (n=271)
generously considered aquatic for this discussion.
Perhaps more fine screening and flotation of the
sediments would have facilitated recovery of more
small fish and amphibian remains; however, it is
apparent that exploitation of large riverine fishes
(such as alligator gar) and large reptiles (snapping
turtles and alligators) was not practiced extensively
by the Caddo inhabitants or that these large aquatic
resources were not available in close proximity.
Bones from these creatures are large and durable
enough to be recovered by troweling or coarse
screening through 1/4-inch mesh hardware cloth.
Earlier Caddo components near river courses
have yielded quantities of large fishes, alligators,
aquatic turtles, water fowl, and aquatic mammals.
Examples of these faunas include alligator gar
(Atractosteus spatula), sturgeon and paddlefish
(Acipenseriformes), even large individuals of flathead catfish (Pylodictis olivaris), freshwater drum
(Aplodinotus grunniens), snapping turtles (Chelydridae), red-eared sliders (Trachemys scripta),
geese (Branta spp. and Chen spp.) and swan (Cygnus spp.), beaver (Castor canadensis), and muskrat
(Ondatra zibethicus). Caddo sites located in the
eastern part of the Caddo cultural area likewise
reveal a diminished reliance on these larger aquatic
faunas in Late Caddo components. These eastern
sites include sites such as Cedar Grove (Styles and
Purdue 1984), Werner, Belcher (Webb 1959), and
Hanna (Byrd 1980).
When compared to the Caddo sites at Cooper
Lake (Butler 1975; Henderson 1978a, 1978b; Yates
1988a, 1988b, 1999), and Bob Williams (Parmalee
and Opperman 1983), the Roitsch and Ray sites are
more similar to these neighboring sites than they
are to sites of similar age farther east. However, our
overall observations are in accordance with Perttula’s (1990) findings, in that there is less emphasis
on fish, waterfowl, and migratory birds and more
reliance on deer, rabbit, turkey, and turtles during
this period of Caddo prehistory.

CONCLUSIONS
Given the Roitsch site’s location so close to the
Red River in modern times and the assumption that
it was situated in proximity to the river or an oxbow lake in prehistoric times, more aquatic fauna

SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS
Timothy K. Perttula and William A. Martin
In this article have been discussed the results
of two very successful Texas Archeological Society
(TAS) Field Schools held in Northeast Texas in 1991
and 1992 at the Arnold Roitsch site (41RR16) in
Red River County, Texas. During the field schools,
considerable new and important information was
obtained on the prehistoric Caddo settlement and
history of the middle reaches of the Red River with
the aid of more than 600 Field School participants in
1991, and 500 more TAS members in 1992. About
50 percent of the participants worked at the Roitsch
site during those two years.
The archeological work conducted by the TAS
at the Arnold Roitsch (41RR16) site, as well as at
the Salt Well Slough (41RR204) (Kenmotsu 2006),
Fasken (41RR14) (Prikryl, this volume), and Ray
(41LR135) (Bruseth et al. 2001) sites, constituted the
first substantial prehistoric archeological research
conducted in both Red River and Lamar counties,
Texas, since the late 1960s and early 1970s, and
the Caddo archeological record in these two counties was relatively poorly known at the time of the
1991 and 1992 TAS Field Schools. Also during the
Field School, our search for the early 19th century
town of Jonesborough during the 1991 Field School
discovered and documented the mid-1840s burial
crypt of Jane Chandler Gill, the wife of an early
resident and large landowner in the Jonesborough
area (see Reese 2001). Several other 19th century
farmsteads and a cemetery were recorded during

the extensive archeological survey of the Roitsch,
Tarrant, and Wright lands in the Mound Prairie area
(see Perttula, this volume), and a mid-19th century
component was also identified on the top of Mound
B at the Fasken site (Prikryl, this volume). Prior
to the TAS Field Schools, the 19th and early 20th
century archeology of Red River County, Texas, was
virtually unknown and unstudied.
With the able participation of the many TAS
members during the two Field Schools, the native history of the Caddo peoples that lived along the middle
reaches of the Red River has come into better focus,
particularly with regard to their material culture, their
use of cultivated plants such as maize and squash,
their production of salt, the construction and use of
their houses and extramural features, and their health
and diet. This is especially the case at the Roitsch site,
where extensive excavations recovered new information on the settlement of this important prehistoric
and early historic Caddo village. The Mound Prairie
area of the middle Red River had been the scene of
permanent settlement by the Caddo peoples and their
ancestors for at least one or two millennia, and the
1991 and 1992 TAS Field Schools has provided us
with an unparalleled research opportunity to study
the nature and character of prehistoric and historic
Caddo lifeways in this part of northeastern Texas. It
is hoped that this article on the 1991 and 1992 TAS
Field School excavations at the Arnold Roitsch site
(41RR16) along the Red River will inspire and encourage others to undertake further studies of the rich
prehistoric and historic heritage of this stretch of the
Red River valley.
Research Problems
At the outset of this article, research problems
developed prior to undertaking the fieldwork were
discussed by Bruseth and Perttula. Information pertinent to all of these research problems was collected
to some extent during the 1991 and 1992 Texas
Archeological Society field schools, but certain
problems are of a sufficiently broad nature—and
also depend upon regionally-based archeological
information—that it is not possible to address them
adequately on the basis of two short field seasons
at a handful of sites. Substantive archeological data
were gathered which could address the more narrowly focused research problems. This section summarizes what was learned about each of the research
problems set out at the beginning of the TAS Field
School investigations.

Perttula—The Archeology of the Roitsch Site (41RR16) 479
Improving the Regional Chronology
This is a broad research problem that cannot
be adequately addressed without excavation data
from many sites. However, work at the Roitsch site
resulted in the collection of several radiocarbon
assays (see Appendix X, this article) along with
numerous decorated sherds from the dated features
that did provide chronological estimations for the
different Caddo occupations at the site. This work
provided chronological data primarily relating to
the Late Caddo period and the McCurtain phase,
which is already better known than the earlier and
later periods, but data were also collected from a
Woodland and prehistoric Mound Prairie phase
Caddo occupation at the southern end of the site.
This work, then, provided chronological data that
will be useful when it can be compared with data
from other sites (particularly well-controlled series
of radiocarbon and thermoluminescence dates on
charred plant materials and decorated Caddo pottery sherds) that may be excavated in the future in
this vicinity.

Understanding the Village Structure of
Prehistoric and Early Historic Caddo
Groups on Mound Prairie
Our archeological survey investigations, along
with the known locations of previously recorded
sites, indicates that prehistoric archeological sites
of various ages are thickly distributed along Big
Pine Creek and Salt Well Slough (Figure 80),
primarily in immediate proximity to the Caddoera Roitsch village. Most are situated on sandy
loam soils on the edge of alluvial terraces, or are
located on natural rises on such landforms. A few
of the sites, almost exclusively Late Caddo McCurtain phase in age (such as the salt-making sites
discussed below), occur on a band of dense clays
that parallels Salt Well Slough and Big Pine Creek
below its confluence with Salt Well Slough.
Of the 109 sites that were recorded or re-recorded
during the two years of archeological survey on the
Roitsch Farm and other nearby farms (see Perttula,
this volume), 89 percent had evidence of at least one
prehistoric occupation. The recovery of diagnostic

projectile points and ceramics (especially decorated
sherds) from surface collections, shovel tests, and a
few 1 x 1 m units, suggests that there were two peaks
in periods of settlement: (a) from the Late Archaic
(ca. 2000 B.C. to 500 B.C.) through the Woodland
(500 B.C.-A.D. 900) periods, and (b) then again
during the Late Caddo period (ca. A.D. 1300-1700).
However, finds from the sites in the TAS survey area
and the Roitsch site indicate that the area was utilized
to some extent by Native Americans from Paleoindian
times to about A.D. 1700 or slightly later.
Many of the Late Archaic and Woodland period
sites probably represent small, seasonally occupied
forager camps, although at least a few of the Woodland period sites (such as 41RR101) have middens
and dense occupational refuse. These types of sites
are believed to be very similar to the Ray site (see
Bruseth et al. 2001) and the Stallings Ranch site (the
location of the 2005 and 2006 Texas Archeological Society field schools in Lamar County, Texas),
and thus may be small homesteads occupied on a
multi-seasonal or year-round basis; structures and
cooking/storage features are probably preserved in
the archeological deposits from these sites.
Only four (4.5 percent) of the prehistoric
sites have identifiable Formative to Middle Caddo
period occupations. One such habitation site near
Fasken, site 41RR206, has a clear midden deposit
and an abundance of ceramics and stone tools. It
probably represents one small part of the dispersed
and localized Caddo community around this civicceremonial center. The Formative to Middle Caddo
period component at the Holdeman site (41RR11),
on a broad and low alluvial terrace of the Red
River, is represented by at least one earthen mound
that covered a circular house and a small Formative Caddo Albion phase cemetery (Perino 1995;
Perttula 1995), as well as extensive village remains
from a large settlement.
The Late Caddo, McCurtain phase, settlement
of the Big Pine Creek and Salt Well Slough areas
was extensive. The habitation sites are characterized by shell-tempered ceramics, small triangular
arrow points, and some quantities of daub or
burned clay. The sites are presumed to represent
dispersed farmsteads, or compounds of farmsteads,
that are associated with the larger village community at the Roitsch site. The habitation sites other
than Roitsch are typically small in size, may or
may not contain middens, and generally are not
characterized by large quantities of material culture
remains; this suggests short (perhaps a few years)

occupations by Late Caddo farmers. Some of these
sites contain family cemeteries, as at 41RR10/104
(cf. Hampton and Moore 1936). Other Late Caddo
McCurtain phase components include several saltmaking sites on Salt Well Slough (see Kenmotsu
2001, 2006; Perttula, this volume), as well as a few
components that simply contain a few triangular
arrow points from either hunting and refurbishing
camps and/or from hunting losses.
A much larger Late Caddo occupation was
defined at the Holdeman site during our 1992 TAS
investigations (Perttula, this volume). Holdeman
appears to have been a substantial village during
Late Caddo times, comparable to the Roitsch site
in settlement character, as it contains abundant
artifacts and features, as well as numerous cemeteries, marking clusters of Caddo houses of this age
spread across a large alluvial terrace of the Red
River. During deep plowing of one portion of the
site in 1992, the landowner exposed considerable
Late Caddo habitation debris across a spring branch
from the Formative Caddo Albion phase mound
mentioned above, and Perino (1995) excavated
some 30 burials from this area in the early 1980s
before land-leveling activities. Other cemeteries
and structures were disturbed by pipeline construction before that in several other locales within the
boundaries of the site (see Briscoe 1995). In most
particulars, the archeological deposits at the Holdeman site during the Late Caddo period occupation
are thought to be quite comparable to the village
areas at Roitsch (Blocks III-IV), Bob Williams
(Perino 1983), and Rowland Clark (41RR77), another contemporaneous Late Caddo village a few
km downstream from Holdeman on the Red River
(Perino 1994).
Based upon the 1691 Domingo Teran de los
Rios map of a Red River Nasoni Caddo community, and ethnographic descriptions of the dispersed
nature of Caddo settlement in East and Northeast
Texas, it was expected that in addition to the
larger Late Caddo communities with mounds (as
at Roitsch) the settlement system would also be
comprised of individual farmsteads, hamlets, and
small villages (see Bruseth et al. 1992:10, 22). It
was uncertain whether such a model of settlement
would also be applicable to Formative-Middle
Caddo period communities.
The archeological survey data from the Roitsch
Farm, along with the archeological data recovered
from the Roitsch site excavations, does suggest that
there are clusters of contemporaneous Late Caddo

Perttula—The Archeology of the Roitsch Site (41RR16) 481
farmsteads and ancillary sites located immediately
to the south and west of the Roitsch site along old
channels of the Red River (now used as channels
by Big Pine Creek and Salt Well Slough). No evidence was recovered in the survey to indicate that
larger Late Caddo hamlets or villages occur away
from the river itself, as all the non-salt-making sites
along Big Pine Creek and Salt Well Slough seem
to have been about the size to contain individual
houses, small trash middens, and a household
cemetery. The dispersion of Late Caddo remains at
the Holdeman site village suggests that a number
of household compounds are present there, but the
village lacked a mound at that time.
The low number of Formative-Middle Caddo
period sites in the survey areas, and at the Roitsch
site itself, argues against the same type of dispersed
settlement system as characterized the Late Caddo
period in the Mound Prairie area. The few sites
of this period that were identified during the TAS
Field School occur only in immediate proximity
to Roitsch, Fasken, and Holdeman, the large civicceremonial villages with mounds. This suggests
that populations during Formative-Middle Caddo
period times were mainly concentrated in a few
optimal locales, but became more dispersed in Late
Caddo times around the few mound centers.
The Historic Tribal Affiliation of the Early
Historic Archeological Deposits at the
Roitsch Site
Unfortunately, no progress was made toward
solving this research problem during the course of
the TAS field school investigations. An area in the
western portion of the Roitsch site was believed
to contain Caddo archeological deposits dating to
the Historic period due to its proximity to a burial
that contained glass beads that was recovered many
years ago. However, the field school excavations
in this area (Block V) contained only evidence
of short-term, low density Early Caddo and Late
Caddo occupations. No definitive evidence of a
Historic period occupation by Caddo peoples was
found there, although one small sherd could have
come from a Keno Trailed vessel that may have
been made and used during that period. Near the
East Mound, several sherds from Keno Trailed,
Hudson Engraved, and Simms Engraved vessels
were recovered, and these could have been used
during the historic period by Caddo peoples. In
general, however, this research problem simply

could not be addressed due to a lack of data, both
archeological and historical.
Understanding the Internal Characteristics
of the Mound at the Roitsch Site
The primary impetus for conducting the 1991
and 1992 TAS Field Schools in Red River and
Lamar counties was the urgent need to study the
East Mound at the Roitsch site before it could be
washed away by another flood. The entire West
Mound had been washed away in the 1990 flood,
leaving the limited excavations conducted by SMU
in 1968 as the only record of mound construction
and content. Although significant discoveries were
made at the East Mound during those excavations,
the Principal Investigator believed that there was
no clear evidence for intentional construction and
thought that the mound was formed by the gradual
accumulation of midden (Skinner et al. 1969). In
1991 and 1992, tremendous effort was devoted to
excavation in the mound to complete its documentation and definitively determine whether or not it
was an artificial mound.
The strata described in the 1969 report (Skinner et al. 1969) included a sterile red clay layer
overlain by 55 cm-thick black sandy clay, overlain
by a tan and brown 80 cm-thick sandy loam midden
and a plow zone. The authors noted that the initial
occupation had occurred in the upper portion of
the black sandy clay layer and they believed that
the midden accumulated gradually on top of it. The
black layer, which was redefined as a dark reddish
brown sandy loam in the 1991 work, and the sterile
red clay represent the natural soil profile. Resting
on top of this soil in the center of the mound was a
roughly 10 cm-thick layer of red clay which formed
the floor of a ceremonial structure through which
the shaft grave was dug at a later point in time. It
is clear from the wide sloping area of the “mottled
zone” in the profile over the shaft grave that a
large area was excavated to uncover the original
structure that had been buried. From the prepared
clay floor down to the base of the grave shaft, the
grave walls were vertical.
The most spectacular features within the
mound are the human burials, especially the large
shaft grave in the center of the mound (Burial 15).
However, the mound was not originally constructed
to serve as a burial mound. The only human burials uncovered within the mound fill or beneath
the mound were clearly intrusive and postdate the

482

mound’s construction. The ceramics from the intrusive interments include shell-tempered ceramics
associated with the latter portion of the Late Caddo
McCurtain phase (e.g., Avery Engraved, Nash Neck
Banded, and Simms Engraved). The mound appears
to have been built to cap the early McCurtain phase
rectangular ceremonial structure with a prepared
clay floor built on the natural ground surface near
the center of the mound. Unlike the West Mound,
which included multiple layers of burned structures,
the East Mound contained this single structure.
The clearest evidence that the mound was deliberately constructed and not a gradually accumulating midden comes from the ceramics identified
in the mound fill. Very few shell-tempered sherds
were present in the mound fill, which suggests
that midden from the Early and Middle Caddo occupations was scooped up elsewhere and placed
intentionally to construct the mound. Given the
radiocarbon dates associated with the use of the
mound, most ceramics in the mound fill would have
been shell-tempered if it had formed through the
gradual accumulation of midden.
Feature 101, a large bathtub-shaped pit containing evidence of intense burning, provided dates
for the initial episode of mound construction. By
chance, a small portion of this large pit extended
outside of Block I, leaving a clear profile along the
eastern wall of the block that proved to be very
illuminating. Beneath the layers of mixed sandy
loam mound fill was a relatively uniform, thin (ca.
2-5 cm thick) waterlain layer of laminated sand.
Similar waterlain layers were observed in our units
and trenches after torrential rainfall washed backdirt into the excavations, so it is clear that this layer
was deposited rapidly after a similar rainfall event.
However, this waterlain layer had been penetrated
by Feature 101 before mound fill was added over
the top of the feature. Apparently, some basket
loads of sandy loam had been deposited in the
vicinity of Feature 101 as the mound construction
began, and the feature was then used for a shortterm event that included burning and immediate
backfilling before the rest of the mound fill was
deposited. The date on charcoal recovered from
Feature 101 places the initial construction of the
mound between cal. A.D. 1275 and 1383, during
the early portion of the McCurtain phase.
To summarize our conclusions about construction
of the mound and its internal characteristics, examination of all the data from the 1968, 1991, and 1992
excavations has allowed us to establish the entire

sequence of mound use with a reasonable degree
of certainty. Through a combination of hard work
and good luck, enough information was gathered in
1991 and 1992 to demonstrate that the East Mound
was deliberately constructed by Caddo peoples and
we were fortunate enough to obtain an initial date
of construction at around A.D. 1275-1383. At that
time, a rectangular structure with a prepared clay
floor was ceremonially burned and covered with
sandy loam mound fill containing artifacts discarded
during earlier Early and Middle Caddo period occupation of the site. Later, single and multiple burials were interred in the mound, with the large shaft
grave (Burial 15) dug down through the center of
the mound, and through the structure that was buried
by the mound fill, down through the natural soil into
the sterile red clay. Late McCurtain phase ceramics
recovered from these graves in 1968, along with
radiocarbon samples obtained in 1991 and 1992,
place the late period of use of the mound for interment at cal. AD 1412-1511 for Burial 15 and cal.
A.D. 1431-1513 for Burial 17. While no radiocarbon
dates from the historic period were obtained, the
quantity of ceramics that have been found elsewhere
in association with historic materials (e.g., Keno
Trailed, Hudson Engraved, and Sims Engraved)
could reflect continued use into the historic period.
Subsistence Pursuits by the Caddo peoples
that lived at the Roitsch Site
A combination of archeological and bioarcheological evidence was recovered from the Roitsch
site—and from several other contemporaneous
Caddo sites where stable carbon isotope analyses
were conducted—during the course of the 1991
and 1992 TAS Field School that has proved quite
informative about prehistoric Caddo subsistence
pursuits in the middle reaches of the Red River.
These different sources of information have
convincingly established that by A.D. 1300, the
prehistoric Caddo living at the Roitsch site and
other associated communities had a diet based on
an intensive use of cultivated foods, particularly
maize. These Caddo communities had developed a
successful maize-based economy that was sustained
in this part of northeastern Texas until at least the
early 18th century, despite several major droughty
periods (Perttula 2005: Table 2-3) that would have
led to crop losses from poor or failed harvests.
Paleobotanical analyses by Fritz and Goldborer
identified maize, cucurbita, various seeds from wild

Perttula—The Archeology of the Roitsch Site (41RR16) 483
plants (maygrass, chenopod, and purslane), as well
as thick hickory, acorn, walnut, and pecan nuts.
Hardwood mast was apparently also an important
constituent of the Caddo diet at Roitsch. The ubiquity of maize in feature flotation samples indicate
that maize was in common use: i.e., maize was an
important crop and dietary food item. There is no
evidence that the Caddo peoples living at Roitsch
grew or gathered native oily or starchy seed crops,
not like their contemporaries living in the Midwest,
the Ozarks, and the Arkansas River basin (Gremillion
2006). Maize, which diffused from Mexico into the
Southeastern United States sometime after 2000 years
ago (Fritz 2006:439-440), became an important crop
for the Caddo on the Red River sometime after ca.
A.D. 1000. Maize was directly dated to the 11th century A.D. at the Ray site (Bruseth et al. 2001: Table
11), an earlier Caddo site also investigated during the
1991-1992 TAS Red River Field School.
Stable carbon isotope analyses of Caddo human
skeletal remains from Red River Caddo village
populations—including Roitsch (see Appendix X,
this article)—indicate that McCurtain phase Caddo
peoples had a maize-rich diet. Pre-A.D. 1250
Caddo had a diet based more on wild plants and
animal foods, supplemented by tropical cultigens.
Schoeninger et al. (2000:69) note that a stable carbon isotope value of -14.0 ‰ on human skeletal
remains means that the diet of such an individual
would have consisted of 50 percent C4 species,
which include maize, amaranth, other grasses,
as well as bison. Caddo burials dated from A.D.
1280-1480 from Red River Caddo sites have mean
stable carbon isotope values of -14.26 + 1.25 ‰
(see Appendix X, this article), while slightly later
burials (dating from ca. A.D. 1450-1680) from the
same set of sites have comparable mean isotope
values of -14.58 + 1.18 ‰. Very similar isotope
values from other Late Caddo sites along the Red
River indicate that Caddo agricultural populations
were also living in southwestern Arkansas and
northwestern Louisiana from the 14th century A.D.
on (Perttula 2005:399 and Figure 11-20).
Although the Caddo peoples living at the
Roitsch site were agricultural, other contemporaneous Native American groups had very high maize
diets, perhaps 15-50 percent higher than did the
McCurtain phase Caddo groups living along the
Red River. For instance, in the Ohio River valley,
populations there had stable isotope values that
were enriched (-12 ‰ to -9 ‰), as did Cahokia
and other American Bottom populations (-14 ‰ to

-11 ‰) along the Mississippi River. It is interesting
that most high status individuals living at Cahokia
ate less maize—and probably ate more meat—than
did commoners (Schoeninger 2006:643). No such
status variation can be identified among the Roitsch
site Caddo population. At Moundville, in Alabama,
after ca. A.D. 1000, the Native American populations were firmly agricultural (mean -10 ‰ stable
carbon isotope values) (Schoeninger 2006:644).
Bioarcheological analyses of burials at the
Roitsch site (see Derrick et al., this article) also
indicate that McCurtain phase Caddo populations
living at the site were part of an extended agricultural community. In addition to the previously mentioned stable carbon isotope analyses, these Caddo
had very high caries rates in their teeth. Such rates
are consistent with an increasing dependence on
corn agriculture and the extensive consumption of
sticky carbohydrate-rich foodstuffs.
These Red River Caddo also have evidence of
porotic hyperostosis in their skeletal remains: 3-33
percent of the studied burials among Caddo populations at the Roitsch, Roden, Holdeman, Rowland
Clark, and Bob Williams sites have this pathological condition. Porotic hyperostosis is a paleopathological condition that is considered a likely result
of iron deficiency anemia caused by nutritional
deficiencies. The rate of porotic hyperostosis in the
Roitsch burials is only 5 percent, suggesting that
these Caddo had a nutritionally adequate diet not
significantly affected by nutritional stress, disease,
anemia, or malnutrition.
The Caddo living at the Roitsch site supplemented their diet with a wide and diverse complement of wild animal foods, including fish, toads
and frogs, alligator, turtles, snakes, birds, and many
different mammals (see Yates, this article). The latter
comprised such species as rabbits, rodents (surely
pests that got into stored foodstuffs) and squirrels,
bear, raccoon, and white-tailed deer. These animal
remains are consistent with a Late Caddo diet for
these Mound Prairie Caddo people that relied on
large game animals for meat and protein, supplemented by turkey, rabbit, fish, turtles, and various
small mammals. Edible mean weights from the
Roitsch site (see Table 48) indicate that white-tailed
deer accounted for almost 55 percent of the available
meat weight; much of the bone in the archeological
deposits here is the product of the processing and
consumption of white-tailed deer. At the earlier Ray
site, by comparison, white-tailed deer comprised 90
percent of the edible meat weight.

Caddo Salt Processing: Were the Caddo
Processing Salt near the Roitsch Site?

In addition to the salt processing site at Salt
Well Slough (41RR204, see Kenmotsu 2001, 2006),
three other Late Caddo salt making sites (41RR248,
41RR256, and 41RR257) have been identified immediately south of the Salt Well Slough site along
Salt Well Slough below its confluence with Pond
Creek (see Figure 80, see also Perttula, this volume).
Known salt-making sites, on intractable clay soils,
extend for at least 800 m along high ground immediately adjacent to the slough.
These sites contain abundant surface and buried deposits of large, shell-tempered Nash Neck
Banded and Emory Punctated-Incised jar sherds,
substantial quantities of burned clay (and daub),
and evidence from shovel testing of burned and
oxidized soils; few chipped or ground stone tools
or pieces of lithic debris have been found at these
sites (Perttula, this volume). Our inference that
these are post-A.D. 1300 Late Caddo salt-making
sites hinges on the fact that Salt Well Slough is
fed by a salt spring, on the findings of features and
burned areas from the Salt Well Slough site (see
Kenmotsu 2001), and comparisons with other saltmaking sites in southwestern Arkansas (cf. Early
1993; Kenmotsu 2001, 2006) and northwestern
Louisiana (Girard 2006). Agricultural Caddo folk,
as with the McCurtain phase Caddo living at the
Roitsch site and surrounding domiciles, had strong
nutritional requirements for salt.
Anglo-American Settlement and Trade
The recorded historic archeological sites on
the Roitsch farm and adjoining lands are the remnants of homesteads and tenant farms occupied
principally between 1860 and 1950. Of the 56
archeological sites that have historic archeological
components, only 12.5 percent have occupations
that predate 1900, while another 23 percent may
have had 19th century occupations but the archeological material remains recovered are equivocal
in chronological matters. One late 19th century
cemetery (41RR235) was recorded on the upper
reaches of Salt Well Slough (Figure 81).
Early to mid-19th century artifacts (English
transfer-printed and hand-painted ceramics, dark
green bottle glass, square nails and metal implements,
etc.) have been found in some quantity at Jonesborough (see also Reese 1998, 2001), in several sites in

the Tarrant Survey (Perttula, this volume), on Mound
B at the Fasken site (see Prikryl 2001, this volume;
Perttula and Reese 2001:232), and similar material
remains have been documented in the R. K. Harris
collection (at the Smithsonian Institution) from the
Wright Plantation site (41RR7); this site is located
on the Red River between the Roitsch and Fasken
sites. However, clear Antebellum Anglo-American
or early 19th century Native American sites were not
identified in the TAS Field School survey or in the
various 1991 and 1992 site excavations.
The historic sites are widely dispersed across
the Roitsch Farm, but they are especially common
on high ground between Big Pine Creek and Pond
Creek, but off of the Late Holocene alluvial terraces where the Roitsch site is situated. The few
historic sites that were occupied only in the 19th
century seem to have preferred settling along the
tributaries of Red River, particularly Big Pine
Creek (for example, site 41RR266, see Figure 81),
rather than on the river itself.
These farmsteads cluster around the old and
abandoned community of Blakeney (Hazlewood
1996:580), along the roads that ran from the late
19th-mid-20th century towns of Manchester and
Davenport (near Jonesborough), and immediately
north of Pond Creek where an unnamed community of tenant farmers lived. This community was
reported to have had as many as 15 separate farmsteads and a blacksmith shop, and a general store
was thought to have been in the area as well. The
TAS survey of that area recorded six ca. 1900-1930
farmsteads (41RR215, 41RR222-41RR225, and
41RR227), and through systematic surface collections recovered a large sample of domestic artifacts
associated with each of the farms.

them all, more than 600 in number. While we cannot
recognize each and every member of the 1991 and
1992 TAS Field Schools, we do want to specifically
thank the following: Mike Davis, Tom Middlebrook,
Norman Flaigg, Jimmie Smith, E. Mott Davis,
Pam Wheat, and Sallie Taylor (Block Directors at
Roitsch); Karen Gardner and Jeanine McDonald
(Lab Directors, 1991 Field Season); Bonnie Yates

All the attendees of the TAS Field School were
very pleased that members of the Caddo Nation of
Oklahoma were able to visit the Field School. To
then have them perform traditional Caddo dances
during an evening program was a special event
that TAS participants will not soon forget. Perttula would also like to thank Rhonda S. Fair of the
Caddo Heritage Museum and Bobby Gonzalez of
the Historic Preservation Program of the Caddo
Nation for the opportunity to examine photographs
of the pottery vessels in the Roitsch collection from

the Roitsch site.
We are also grateful for the contributions of
various consultants to the Field School: Bonnie
Yates and Brian Shaffer (Faunal Analyses); Dr.
Gayle Fritz and Eileen Goldborer (Paleobotanical
Analyses); and Dr. Sharon M. Derrick, Gail Colby,
and Dr. D. Gentry Steele (Bioarcheology). Perttula
would also like to thank Bo Nelson for providing
several site photographs used in the report, as well
as for taking many photographs of artifacts from
the various excavated sites investigated during the
TAS Field Schools. Sandra Hannum also prepared
several figures in the article, as did Roland Pantermuhl of the Texas Historical Commission.
Lastly, we acknowledge the assistance, support,
and patience provided by other THC staff (from the
Division of Archeology) during the course of the
Field School, and the long and subsequent period
of analysis and report preparation. Seemingly, the
truck load of TAS artifacts and boxes were always
being moved and getting in the way, but everyone
persevered, and lent a helping hand.

APPENDIX II,
Roitsch Site Burial Descriptions
Sharon M. Derrick, Gail R. Colby, and D. Gentry Steele
Burial 24, Adult Male, 30-35 Years
The extremely fragmentary remains of this
individual were found eroding from the side of a
shallow gully. The narrow sciatic angle (not measurable) of the right ilium, measurements of the
right talus, and the right femoral head measurement
of 45 mm indicate that this individual is a male (see
Table 24 and Appendix IV, this article). Stature
estimation was not possible due to the absence of
measurable long bones. The age at death of 30-34
years was based on an auricular surface morphology assessment (Lovejoy et al. 1985), and the presence of a moderate amount of 3rd molar wear (see
Appendix V, this article). No pathological lesions
were observed on the postcranial skeleton.
The cranium was modeled. There is a large
supra-inion depression measuring 27 x 20 mm in diameter present on the occipital bone (see Table 33).
Extreme crowding of the anterior mandibular
dentition occurred, with possible antemortem loss of
some of the incisors. There is an abscess of the two
distal roots of the right first maxillary molar, and the
crown of this tooth is almost completely decayed. The
crown of the right fourth maxillary premolar is also
quite decayed. Calculus deposition is evident on most
surfaces of all of the other teeth. There is a total of 20
caries, excluding the completely decayed crowns of
the right fourth maxillary premolar and the right first
maxillary molar.
Burial 25, Adult of Indeterminate
Sex, 40-55 Years
This adult individual of indeterminate sex was
disturbed by erosion and pothunting activity, resulting in poor preservation of the skeletal material.
The right humerus was used (assuming a possible
female sex assessment) to estimate a stature of approximately 161 cm (see Table 24). Age assessment
is tentative, but the presence of arthritic changes
indicates an older individual, possibly in his/her
40s or 50s. The bones of this individual are gracile
with rough, although not overly robust, muscle attachment areas.
Few pathological lesions were observed in this
individual with the exception of arthritic changes.
There is evidence of degenerative joint disease at

the fifth lumbar/sacral articulation, with obvious
slippage at the articular surface that caused a wear
facet and severe osteophytic ripping. Osteophytic
changes are present on the articular surfaces of
the fragmented ribs and the right patella exhibits
marked lipping on the lateral edge of the articular
facet. One proximal phalanx of the foot displays
a remodeled proximal end, indicating a possible
healed injury.
Three loose mandibular teeth are present,
the second left incisor, third left molar, and right
canine. All teeth exhibit moderate wear (see Appendix V, this article). There is calculus deposition
on the left incisor. One caries is present on the occlusal surface of the molar, as well as discoloration
on the lingual surface.
Burial 26A, Subadult, 18 + 6 Months
The skeletal material from Burial 26 contains a
single, healthy deciduous tooth, the second maxillary right incisor (see Appendix V, this article). The
incisor was occluded, and there is evidence of very
slight wear, but the root is not completely formed.
This condition conforms to a tentative age estimate
of 18 + 6 months (Ubelaker 1978).
Burial 26B, Adult Female
These remains were also disturbed by erosion
and previous human activity. The os coxae are
fragmented and the sciatic notch width is not measurable at the traditional landmarks. Upon visual
examination, the sciatic angle appears quite large,
and there is a well-defined preauricular sulcus
present on both iliae. The femoral head diameters
measure 39.0 mm (right) and 40.0 mm (left). The
femur head diameter for females is typically less
than 45 mm (Stewart 1979). Based upon these
characteristics, the individual was assessed as a
female. Her stature was estimated at approximately
160 cm (see Table 24).
The auricular surface of the ilium appears
older than the evidence from dentition and other
joint surfaces warrant. There is a general lack of
degenerative arthritic changes in the post-cranial
skeleton, lack of fusion of the coronal suture of
the calvarium, and an overall youthful quality

512

Texas Archeological Society

to the bone material. Based on this evidence, the
individual was identified as an adult but was not
assigned an age in years.
The muscle markings on this individual are
well-defined, with large supinator crests on the
ulnae and a robust linea aspera of the femur. The
phalanges of the hand exhibit small osteophytes
that were probably caused by strenuous use of the
hands. The only disorders noted were dental caries
and a slight pitting on the right frontal bone at the
coronal suture.
The dentition of Burial 26b is represented by
the first mandibular right incisor, the mandibular
left canine, and the second mandibular right molar
(see Appendix V, this article). An erosional taphonomic process of some type appears to have affected all three teeth present. No dental hypoplasias
are evident, but the molar exhibits discoloration on
both the mesial and buccal surfaces. Two caries are
present, one on the occlusal surface of the molar
and one on the distal side of the canine. Tooth wear
is moderate (see Appendix V, this article).
Burial 27A, 8ubadult, 12 + 2.5 Years
Burial 27 contains the commingled remains of
two individuals, Burial 27a and 27b. Burial 27a is a
subadult represented by 15 permanent teeth and the
proximal epiphysis of a humerus (see Appendix III,
this article). The second molars were occluded, with
roots that are mostly formed but not complete. The
crowns of the third molars are complete, but the roots
are not formed. The occluded teeth exhibit minimal
wear (see Appendix V, this article). Four caries are
present, as well as several lines of hypoplasia.
There is a moderate amount of calculus deposition, especially on the first and second molars. The
first maxillary left incisor was probably injured antemortem, as discoloration of the labial surface of the
tooth suggests that it was dead before the death of
the child. The incisors exhibit marked shoveling.
Buria1 27B, Young Adult Female
The Burial 27 adult was distinguished from the
subadult on the basis of tooth eruption, fused epiphyses, and fused sutural lines present on cranial
fragments. Estimation of sex is tentative. The size
and shape of the left eye orbit, the size and shape of
the mandible, a lack of flaring at the gonial angles,
as well as the gracile morphology of the long bones
with smooth muscle attachment areas, suggest that
the individual is a female (see Table 24). A stature
estimation of approximately 153 cm (see Table 24)

was calculated from a segment of the left humerus
(Steele and Bramblett 1988). Age could not be
determined beyond classification of the individual
as a young adult.
There is a virtual lack of postcranial pathology
on this individual. The only pathological condition
noted is on the proximal articular surface of the
tibia. This area exhibits some osteophytic build-up
that may have been caused by local trauma.
Although the mandible is present, no teeth are
in place. A portion of the maxilla contains five teeth
and there are eight loose teeth (see Appendix V, this
article). A very destructive caries is present on the
right maxillary fourth premolar that destroyed most
of the tooth and caused an apical abscess at the root.
This abscess extends into the root of the third right
maxillary premolar. The distal margin of the right
third premolar exhibits a large caries. There is a
small caries present on the mesial margin of the right
maxillary incisor. The alveolar margin of the maxilla
is porous, exhibiting resorption at the margin of all
five teeth. The maxillary teeth are discolored in a
brown banding pattern, but no hypoplasias were
observed. The palate appears slightly roughened and
the incisal foremen is quite large.
Burial 28, Commingled
Burial 28 consists of a minimum of four individuals; two adult females, one adult male, and
one subadult. This burial was treated as an ossuary
sample because it was not possible to ascertain with
certainty which elements belonged to which individual (with the exception of the subadult clavicle).
Items of note include one case of fused laminae
from two unidentified vertebrae, one piece of ossified costal cartilage, one mandible with extensive
infection and periodontal disease, one supra-inion
depression, and one maxilla with a roughened palate
and evidence of infection on the alveolar margin.
Burial 29, Subadult, Birth + 2 Months
Most of the elements representing this infant
are fragmentary. Age was estimated by examination of dental eruption pattern (Ubelaker 1978),
and measurement of the first metacarpal and the
malleus of the ear (Fazekas 1978). There are no
identifiable pathological conditions noted for this
individual.
Burial 30, Male, 17-23 Years
Burial 30 is a male based on the narrow sciatic
notch, large mastoid processes, and flat articulation of

Perttula—The Archeology of the Roitsch Site (41RR16) 513
the sacroiliac joint (see Table 24). The discriminant
function analysis of the talus and calcaneus and the 44
mm femoral diameter garnered for sex determination
are inconclusive, possibly due to the young age of the
individual (see Table 25). Stature was estimated at
approximately 166 cm (see Table 24).
A maximum age of 23 years is indicated by the
incomplete fusion of the acromion processes to the
scapulae as well as a lack of fusion at the medial
clavicular epiphysis (McKern and Stewart 1957). A
minimum age of 17 years is indicated by auricular
surface changes (Lovejoy et al. 1985) and the root
development of the mandibular third molar (Steele
and Bramblett 1988).
A number of pathological conditions were
noted for this individual. The surfaces of the frontal, parietals, and occipital are generally porous
in appearance and the occipital bone exhibits a
supra-inion depression measuring 27 x 22 mm in
diameter (see Table 33). There is incomplete fusion
of the palatine suture and the palate is roughened,
with the presence of small spicules of bone. The
nasal aperture is slightly eroded. The axis (second
cervical vertebra) displays a small sequestrum of
ossified articular cartilage in a depression of the left
superior articular facet, an example of osteochondritis dissecans. The left superior articular facet of
the first cervical vertebra, the atlas, is markedly
larger than the right facet, a condition that may
have been caused by the pathological condition of
the axis. The laminae and spines of the third and
fourth thoracic vertebrae exhibit osteophytosis
of the inferior surfaces. In addition to the above
conditions, the auricular surfaces of the os coxae
appear too smooth, lacking the normal billowing
or roughened morphology.
There is a slight to marked alveolar porosity
in both the maxilla and the mandible. Numerous caries and fenestrae are present, as well as
some calculus build-up. The crown of the left first
lower molar is completely decayed. Both mandibular third molars are impacted. Various teeth are
chipped. This young male must have experienced
severe pain from the condition of his teeth.
Burial 31, Female, Early to Late 30s
Burial 31 was identified as a female based
on several avenues of evidence. The sciatic angle
of this individual is large. There is a large shallow preauricular sulcus, the medial aspect of the
ischiopubic ramus is sharp, and there is a ventral
arc present on the pubis. The femur head diameter

is 42.5 mm, within the range characteristic of
females. Talus and calcaneus measurements also
indicate that the individual is a female (see Table
25). Stature was estimated at approximately 159
cm (see Table 24).
Auricular surface morphology indicates an
age of 30-39 years (Lovejoy et al. 1985). Pubic
symphysis changes are consistent with an age of
30.7-38.2 (Suchey et al. 1988a). The basosphenoid
suture is completely fused, indicating that the individual is over 17 years of age. The coronal and
sagittal sutures were becoming obliterated, but the
facial sutures are still well-defined. Tooth wear
is moderate, although several teeth were lost and
the alveolus had healed over the sockets. Slight
degenerative joint disease is present in the lumbar
vertebrae and there is some osteophytic action on
the articular surfaces of the ribs and the articular
surfaces of vertebrae articulating with ribs. These
mild osteophytic changes are normally seen in
individuals in their 30s. The long bones exhibit
dense, smooth, cortical bone and the femoral heads
have the smooth rounded margins characteristic of
a younger adult.
Pathological conditions of the postcranial
remains are limited to osteoarthritis and osteophytosis. The left radius displays an enthesophyte, a
ridge-like build-up of bone, along the lateral border
of the radial tuberosity. This osteophytic action at
the attachment for the biceps muscle may be stressrelated. The biceps muscle attachment area of the
right radius is less well developed than that of the
left and there is no enthesophyte present, although
there is some osteophytic activity on the distal
articular end. Therefore, this individual may have
been left-handed.
Evidence of degenerative joint disease was observed on the lumbar vertebrae and in the pelvic region. The lumbar vertebrae exhibit well-developed
osteophytes and degeneration of the articular surfaces. The acetabulae of the os coxae are shallow,
smooth, and burnished, and the head of the right
femur is smooth at the margins with a burnished
cap, indicating malfunction of the hip joint.
The cranium of this individual was modeled
(see Table 24). The overall shape of the cranium is
long and flat, with a forehead that slopes quickly
toward the parietal region. The occipital region is
broad and bulbous. There is some surface porosity of the calvarial bones but no apparent thinning
of the tables or expansion of the diploe. The most
distinct porosity occurs on the parietal bones in

514

Texas Archeological Society

the vicinity of the sagittal suture. A well-healed
supra-inion depression is present on the occipital
bone, but the lack of definite borders precludes an
accurate measurement of the diameter. There is an
antemortem crease present on the left parietal just
above the temporo-parietal suture that may have
been the result of a healed trauma to the head.
Dental pathology was a serious health problem
for this woman, with the maxilla as the site of the
most severe infection. The right alveolar border
of the maxilla is extremely porous and unhealthy.
The second right incisor is discolored on the interproximal margins. The right canine and adjacent
premolar are decayed, leaving only dead roots.
Alveolar abscesses occurred around these roots
and around the right fourth premolar. The root tip
of that tooth was dying antemortem. The right first
and third molars were lost antemortem, and healing
of the alvealar surface has occurred. The dentition
on the left side of the maxilla is also infected. The
left second incisor, left canine, and left premolars
were dead antemortem, having decayed to the
roots. There is an alveolar abscess above the left
canine and adjacent premolar. A large caries is
present on the distal cervical margin of the left first
molar. The left second and third molars were also
lost antemortem and some healing has occurred
around those molar sockets.
Although the left incisors and canine of the
mandible are healthy teeth, a small caries is present on the left mesial premolar. The left distal
premolar and left first and second molars had
been lost antemortem, with almost complete healing of the alveolar region. The left third molar
is discolored on all sides as well as the occlusal
surface. The alveolar surface around this tooth
is slightly porous, indicating incipient infection.
Lines of hypoplasia occur on the buccal surfaces
of the left canine and mesial premolar. Two lines
of hypoplasia are evident above the cervical
margin of the right mandibular canine. The right
mesial premolar has a large caries on the distal
interproximal surface. The right first and third
molars were lost antemortem and the alveolar
surface had healed before death. The right second
molar is badly discolored.
Burial 32, Female, 45-59 Years
The remains of Burial 32 are extremely fragmentary, with the exception of the femora. Sex
was assessed as female based on the width of the
sciatic notch from both the os coxae and a large

left preauricular sulcus. Due to lack of corroborating evidence this assessment is tentative. Stature
is estimated at 157 cm from measurement of the
right femur (see Table 24). The auricular surfaces
of the iliac conform to an age category range of
45-59 years (Lovejoy et al. 1985).
Postcranial disorders include a possible case
of local trauma and degenerative joint disease. The
glenoid fossa of the right scapula is roughened and
pitted, and the head of the right humerus in contact
with this fossa exhibits a fine porosity and some
pitting, indicating possible trauma to the shoulder
joint. However, there is no evidence of deterioration of the joint.
All of the thoracic vertebrae present exhibit
degeneration of the centrum surface. Lesions occur
on the superior and inferior centra surfaces, with
the largest lesion measuring 8 mm in diameter. The
centra appear eroded, although the laminae and
articular facets are healthy.
Various other signs of skeletal deterioration
due to aging are present in the postcranial remains.
The surface of the femoral head is burnished and
almost polished in appearance. There is osteophytic
action on the metacarpals and phalanges of both
hands, indicating that the hands had been used for
many years for a variety of tasks.
Only two identifiable teeth are present, the
left maxillary central incisor and the left maxillary
mesial premolar. One unidentified dead root is also
present. Both of the complete teeth have large caries and hypoplastic lines.
Burial 33, Male, 30-40 Years
The head and shoulder areas of this young
adult male were disturbed by pothunting activity,
but most of the postcranial remains are well-preserved. A male sex assessment was made based on
the following criteria: small sciatic angle, narrow
and shallow preauricular sulcus, discriminant functions for the talus and calcaneus in the male range,
a femoral head measurement of 45.5 mm, rounded
upper orbital margins, everted gonial angles, and
robust attachment areas for the masseter muscle.
Living stature for this individual was estimated
at 160 cm (see Table 24). Based on the auricular
surface morphology (Lovejoy et al. 1985), as well
as the presence of fused epiphyses, no signs of
arthritis, dense cortical bone, and open cranial sutures, except for the coronal suture, this individual
was 30-40 years old at death.
Developmental anomalies were observed in

Perttula—The Archeology of the Roitsch Site (41RR16) 515
the vertebral column and the left foot. The fifth and
sixth thoracic vertebrae are misshapen and slightly
skewed to the left, and the fifth lumbar vertebra has
misshapen lamina that produce a skewed arch. This
condition probably was not severe enough to produce noticeable scoliosis in the living individual.
One proximal phalanx of the left foot is malformed
at the proximal articular surface. Evidence of nutritional stress during development is present in the
form of distinct horizontal lines of hypoplasia on
several of the maxillary and mandibular teeth.
Two fractures and damage to the left patella
are evidence of traumatic injuries. Two left ribs had
been broken; one was a complete fracture and the
other was a compression fracture. Both fractures
had completely healed. The left patella exhibits
a small (2 mm) lytic lesion on the medial facet,
an indication of possible localized trauma. Other
anomalies include the presence of infectious bone
on one indeterminate rib at the vertebral articular
facet, the presence of enthesophytes on the lateral
borders of the left and right radius diaphyses (a
sign that this individual participated in strenuous
activity), and evidence of mechanical stress on the
hands in the form of osteophytic growth on the
metacarpals and phalanges.
The health of this individual must have been
compromised by the presence of severe tooth decay. There are a large number of caries and pursuant periodontal disease, with little or no healing before death. The alveolar margin is severely infected
in several places, most notably around the right
maxillary distal premolar and the right maxillary
first, second, and third molars. Three abscesses are
present. Actual wear on the dentition is moderate
(see Appendix V, this article).
Burial 34A, Male, Late 40s to Mid-50s
The burial that contained this individual was
the most disturbed of all the Caddo burials excavated at the 1991 TAS Field School (Jimmy Smith,
1991 personal communication). However, many
of the individual elements are well-preserved and
provide a quantity of bioarcheological information. Sex determination for this individual was
based on several substantial criteria. The sciatic
notch/acetabular index indicates the individual is
a male (Kelley 1979), the pubic symphysis is wide
in length by width, and the preauricular sulcus is
very small. Diameter of the femoral head is 45.4
mm. The mandible is broad, with slightly everted
gonial angles and a receding chin, and the muscle

attachments on the occipital are quite robust. This
individual is taller than most individuals in the
sample at an estimated 166 cm (see Table 24).
Age assessment was also based on substantial
criteria. The auricular surface morphology is indicative of an age of 40-44 years (Lovejoy et al. 1985).
Pubic symphysis changes indicate an age of 37-62
years (Suchey et al. 1988b). The cranial sutures are
beginning to fuse; the sagittal suture is almost obliterated, the coronal suture is faint, and the lambdoidal suture is moderately fused. Additional evidence
of middle age includes slight arthritic growth on
the occipital and mastoid processes, and alveolar
resorption of the maxilla and mandible.
Osteoarthritis was observed in varying degrees
throughout the skeleton of this individual. The
thoracic and lumbar vertebrae of this individual
display evidence of degenerative disk disease. The
intervertebral disks appear to have degenerated,
causing the end plates of the vertebral bodies to
become extremely porous and rough. Schmorl’s
nodes are present on the articular faces of the centra. The inferior and superior surfaces of these end
plates have eroded, with subsequent deposition of
osteophytic bone. There is no marked osteoarthritic
change in the borders of the centra or on the zygopophyses.
Mild osteophytic action was observed on the
vertebral facets of the ribs. Slight marginal osteophytes are present on the acetabulae of the right
and left os coxae. The left acetabulum exhibits a
rectangular deposition of light colored porous bone
on the dorsal margin. This patch of bone measures
13.4 x 4.0 mm. Wrinkled depressions are present
on the superior margins of both acetabulae. The
proximal right humerus, metacarpals and phalanges, and distal left femur display osteophytes. In
addition, the lateral border of the radial tuberosity
of the right radius exhibits an age and stress-related
enthesophyte.
Evidence of infection was observed in the
cranium and in fragments of unidentified ribs. The
cranium displays two round depressed centers of
bone activity on the right parietal. One of those
centers is highly porous. Four ribs exhibit mild
periostitis near the articular facets. The shaft of one
of these ribs is slightly remodeled.
The dentition of this individual is characterized
by heavy tooth wear, periodontal disease, tooth
loss, and subsequent alveolar resorption. Extensive
chipping and discoloration are present on the
lingual occlusal margin of the left third mandibular

molar. The left lateral mandibular incisor is also
severely chipped, as is the left distal maxillary
premolar. The crown of the maxillary right mesial
incisor is completely decayed and nine additional
caries are present in the dentition.
Burial 34B, 8ubadult, 6 + 3 Months
The remains of this infant are quite fragmentary and composed of few elements. Age determination was based on dental eruption (see Table 24).
The occipital bone appears to have been the site of
a massive infection, with perforation into the brain
cavity. This may be another case of supra-inion
infection but, due to the fragmentary nature of the
cranial elements, a concrete diagnosis could not be
made.
Burial 34C, Adult of Indeterminate Sex and Age
This individual is represented by one parietal
fragment and one clavicle fragment.
Burial 35, Female, 30-35 Years
Sex determination was made for this individual
from cranial, pelvic, and metric evidence. The
rounded chin, very slight gonial eversion of the
mandible, small mastoid processes, light muscle
markings, round orbits, small to no supraorbital
torus, and large parietal bossing are all female
traits. The os coxae display a wide sciatic notch, a
wide and definite preauricular sulcus, a large subpubic angle, a ventral arc, dorsal pitting on both
pubic bones, and narrow pubis width. Femoral
head diameter is 42.5 mm. Calcaneus and talus discriminant function calculations also indicate that
the individual is a female. Stature was estimated
at 161 cm.
Age estimation was performed using the following evidence. Auricular surface morphology indicates an age of 30-34 years (Lovejoy et al. 1985).
Evaluation of the pubic symphysis was consistent

with an age estimation of 30-38 years (Suchey et
al. 1988a). Dental wear assessment indicated an
age range of 30-40 years.
Medical disorders affecting Burial 20 are
present in the form of vertebral osteophytosis and
degenerative joint disease of the cervical, thoracic,
and lumbar regions, slight osteoarthroses of the
pelvis, arms, and legs, infection in the form of a suprainion depression and mild periodontal disease,
enamel hypoplasias, and dental caries. Tooth wear
is moderate (see Appendix V, this article).
Burial 36, Subadult, 9 + 3 Months
The remains of this infant are extremely friable and delicate. The cranium is held together by
soil. Care was taken to clean the exterior surfaces
of the cranium and leave the cranial bones in articulation. Therefore, measurements of the cranial
bones were not taken. The fragmentary nature of
the postcranial remains precludes most measurement as well. Age estimation was completed using
dental evidence and measurement of the auditory
ossicles (Steele and Bramblett 1988; Fazekas 1978)
(see Tables 26 and 33).
The most notable feature of this infant is the
presence of a large perforating lesion of the occipital supra-inion region of the modeled cranium.
Surface Collection
The element inventory for the surface collection is included in Appendix III, identified by lot
numbers. Some of the surface collection remains
can only be assigned to Block II (East Mound) or
Block III (Village area) but some of the material is
associated with Burials 24, 25, 27, and 28 on the
Terrace. Items of note include a right maxilla with
a roughened palate and a peg-like incisor, and several cases of enamel hypoplasias, hypercementosis,
caries, and osteophytosis.
