ABSTRACT
An archaeological survey of the site of a proposed 21 acre Palestine Park site
within the city limits of Palestine in Anderson County, Texas was conducted by Brazos
Valley Research Associates on June 7 and 9, 1994. This project was conducted for the
City of Palestine, Texas and was performed using the pedestrian survey method
supported by shovel testing. This project was conducted under Texas Antiquities
Committee permit 1417. Both prehistoric and historic artifacts were found in the project
area. Two prehistoric sites were found through shovel testing and recorded as
41AN141 and 41AN142. Each site produced two flakes in two separate shovel tests at
depths of 30-40 cm (41AN141) and 40-50 cm (41AN142). These sites are referred to in
this report as open campsites of unknown age based on the limited data available at
this time. The historic evidence consists of a single bottle that is referred to in this report
as an isolated find. No formal site number has been assigned. At this time this
specimen has not been formally examined, but it appears to date to between the late
19th and early 20th centuries. Neither the prehistoric sites nor the historic isolated find
are considered significant. Therefore, it is recommended that construction be allowed
to proceed as planned. The prehistoric artifacts are currently housed at Brazos Valley
Research Associates in Bryan, Texas awaiting permanent curation at the Texas
Archeological Research Laboratory in Austin, Texas. The bottle was found on the
surface. Since it is recognized as an isolated find it will be returned to the City of
Palestine.

INTRODUCTION
The City of Palestine plans to construct a park on a 21 acre tract within the city
limits of Palestine in south-central Anderson County, Texas (Figure 1). The project area
is located in an upland setting overlooking the floodplain of Howard Creek to the north
and east. Topographic coverage is provided by the United States Geological Service
(USGS) 7.5' quadrangle, Northeast Palestine dated 1982 (Figure 2). The proposed
park site is adjacent to two modern roads, State Highway Loop 256 on the southwest
and Moody Street on the north (Figure 3).
At this time the proposed park site is located on property owned by Dr. Barry
James and Jesse George, Jr. within the Wells survey (Abstract 65). In addition to the
property proposed for acquisition on a donation and partial donation basis, the city plans
to enter into an agreement for use of contiguous properties owned by the Palestine
Independent School District. There is a 1.9 acre tract within the project area boundaries
that will remain in private ownership (Figure 3). This area is proposed as the site of a
YMCA facility.
When completed, the park will contain the following improvements: playground,
picnic areas, trails for hiking, biking, and jogging; a concession/storage building; a
restroom/bathhouse; and volleyball and basketball courts.
Anderson County is located in a part of Texas that contains numerous prehistoric
and historic sites, many of which have been considered to possess significant research
potential. This county is in the area once inhabited by the prehistoric Caddo Indians of
Northeast Texas. Many of these sites contain burials and pottery vessels of exceptional
quality. Vandalism of archaeological sites in this area is a serious problem and the
number of intact Caddoan sites is rapidly decreasing. In fact, three Caddoan pots were
seen by the author for sale at a local antique store in Palestine during a recent visit.
The City of Palestine applied for a permit from the Texas Antiquities Committee
and was informed that a cultural resources survey would be required before
construction would be allowed to proceed. In order to comply with this requirement, the
City of Palestine contracted with Brazos Valley Research Associates (BVRA) of Bryan,
Texas to evaluate the proposed park site. The project number assigned by Brazos
Valley Research Associates is BVRA 94-08. This project was conducted under Texas
Antiquities Committee permit 1417.

ENVIRONMENTAL SETTING
General
Data not specifically cited below were taken from the Environmental Impact
Statement prepared for the City of Palestine and on file at City Hall in that municipality
or from the topographic map, Northeast Palestine, Texas dated 1982. The project area
is located within the West Gulf Coastal Plain physiographic province as defined by
Fenneman (1946) and the Austropriarian biotic province as defined by Blair (1950:98100). The reader is referred to Volume I (Stratigraphy) of the Geology of Texas by
Sellards et al. (1932) for a more in-depth discussion of the geology of this area. In
terms of its topographic setting the project area is situated on an upland ridge with a
mean elevation of 373 feet with variation of 369 to 417 feet above and below the mean
elevation. The site overlooks Howard Creek and its floodplain to the north and east.
Soils
The project area is depicted in the soils book for Anderson County (Coffee 1975)
on Sheet Number 48. According to this sheet, there are five soil-mapping units that
occur within or immediately adjacent to the project area (Figure 4). These are (1) the
Nahatche Wehadkee soils (Na) which are made of of nearly level soils on the flood
plains of both small and large streams (Coffee 1975:31); (2) Larue loamy fine sand
(LaD), 3 to 8 percent slopes which are gently sloping on the sides of drainage ways in
areas 5 acre to 180 acres in size (Coffee 1975:29); (3) Eustis fine sand (EuD), 2 to 8
percent slopes found on gently sloping and gently rolling soils in areas 5 to 230 acres in
size (Coffee 1975:16); (4) Darco, Kirvin, and Tenaha soils (DkF), sloping that mainly
occur together on sloping to moderately steep ridges and hillsides. Most ridges are long
and narrow and are 40 acres to several hundred acres in size (Coffee 1975:12-13; and
(5) Trawick fine sandy loam (TkD), 2 to 8 percent slopes. These soils are gently sloping
on the tops and sides of ridges in areas 5 to 1800 acres in size (Coffee 1975:39).
Climate
Data taken from the Texas Almanac for 1984-1985 (Kingston and Harris 1983)
state that the county receives 40.51 inches of annual rainfall. When combined with a
January minimum temperature of 37 degrees Fahrenheit and a July maximum
temperature of 94 degrees Fahrenheit, a growing season of 264 days results.

Flora
The canopy within the project area consists of hardwood tree species southern
red oak, post oak, hickories, sweet gum, green ash, sycamore, and winged elm.
Understory trees include red maple, river birch, sumac, hawthorns, and American
beauty berry.
Herbaceous vegetation consists of various grasses such as panicums, bluestem,
broomsedge, and paspalum. Asters, buttercups, dock, ragweed, goldenrods, rushes,
sedges, tickseeds, love weed, partridge pea, dewberry, poison ivy, greenbriar,
honeysuckle, grapevines, and Alabama supplejack are found as part of the ground
cover.
Fauna
Fauna known to be present within the project area at various times of the year
include fox and gray squirrel, armadillo, raccoon, opossums, cottontail rabbits, whitetailed deer, coyote, beaver, and feral hogs. Many birds utilize the site including dove,
meadowlark, killdeers, various sparrows, great blue herons, bluebirds, mockingbirds,
and cardinals.

ARCHAEOLOGICAL BACKGROUND
Anderson County is located in the Northeast Texas Archeological Study Region
of the Eastern Planning Region as defined by the Department of Antiquities Protection
in Archeology in the Eastern Planning Region, Texas: A Planning Document (Kenmotsu
and Perttula 1993). According to the planning document, there were 121 sites recorded
in the county as of 1991 (Kenmotsu and Perttula 1993:41). In the region, Anderson
County was 16th in terms of numbers of sites recorded. Of the 121 recorded sites, 12
were considered not significant, 41 were of unknown significance, 46 were probably
significant, and 22 were significant. Two sites (41AN19 and 41AN51) are listed on the
National Register of Historic Places. Site 41AN51, the Pace McDonald site, has been
discussed in an unpublished manuscript by Thurmond (1978) on file at TARL. The total
number of sites, both prehistoric and historic, as of June 10, 1994, was 140 (Carolyn
Spock, personal communication, June 10, 1994).
The Archeological Bibliography for the Northeastern Region of Texas (Martin
1990) cites 50 references for the county. Although many of these investigations have
been small area surveys, often resulting in negative findings, several major reservoir
projects have been conducted. These are the Blackburn Crossing Reservoir (Johnson
1958, 1961), Palestine Reservoir (Anderson et al. 1974), Tennessee Colony Lake
(Richner 1977, 1982; Richner and Lee 1976, 1977), Trinity River Basin (Richner and
Bagot 1978), and the Trinity River Multiple Use Project (Sorrow 1973). Overviews of
the area include works by (Lynott and Richner 1977), Woodall (1972), and Story, et al.
(1990)
Prehistoric occupations in the region cover all time periods from Paleoindian
through Historic Caddoan, circa 9500 B.C. - A.D. 1860 (Kenmotsu and Perttula
1993:44). The reader is referred to this comprehensive and well-organized document
for additional information regarding the archaeological background for Anderson County
and vicinity.

METHODS
The project was divided into three phases - background and archival research,
field investigation, and report preparation. The background and archival research
consisted of a check of the site records at the Texas Archeological Research Laboratory
(TARL). The Principal Investigator performed this task.
Background and Archival Research
The background and archival research consisted of a review of existing literature
on Anderson County at the TARL library and a check of the Abstracts in Texas Contract
Archeology project currently sponsored by the Department of Antiquities Protection,
Texas Historical Commission. Volumes in the abstracts series have been published for
1987 (Moore 1991), 1988 (Moore 1990), 1989 (Moore 1993), 1990 (Moore 1992a), and
1991 (Moore 1992b). The volume for 1992 is in preparation. Two of the more valuable
references reviewed were the planning document by the Department of Antiquities
Protection (Kenmotsu and Perttula 1993) and an archeological bibliography for the
Northeastern Region of Texas (Martin 1990).
Field Investigation
The field investigation was conducted on June 7 and 9, 1994 with William E.
Moore supervising the field survey and acting as Principal Investigator. The field crew
consisted of Billy Joe Wright and Wendy Ward. The entire 21 acre tract was examined
utilizing the pedestrian survey method supported by shovel testing. In all, 48 shovel
tests were excavated with an emphasis placed on areas considered to be high
probability in terms of site location. The rest were dug randomly throughout the project
area. Excavated matrix was screened through 1/4 inch hardware cloth. Shovel test
data were recorded on a shovel test log and in the field notes. Tests were dug to sterile
clay when possible and varied in depth from 5 to 100 cm below the ground surface. All
artifacts collected from shovel tests were bagged for analysis and curation. The tests
dug on June 7, 1994 appear on the log in Appendix I, and the tests dug on June 9, 1994
appear on the log in Appendix II. Located within the boundaries of the approximate 21
acre project area is a 1.9 acre tract that is proposed for construction of a YMCA facility.
This tract is situated on the highest part of the ridge overlooking the creek and is,
therefore, the most desirable location for a site in this part of the project area. Although
this 1.9 acre tract is not in the project area, it was examined in order to provide a more
thorough evaluation of the landform. This strategy proved especially important when a
flake was found in Shovel Test (ST) 3 and adjacent tests were excavated in an attempt
to define the site boundaries. The flake was found within the boundaries of the current
project area, but most of the adjacent tests were dug in the 1.9 acre tract.

The current project area was originally designed to include the floodplain of
Howard Creek to the north. Due to constraints placed on construction by the presence
of wetlands, the project area was moved to the south and away from the wetlands that
will not be affected by construction under the current plan. According to Bob Riley
(personal communication, June 9, 1994), much of the area in the northern section of the
current project area has been adversely affected by borrowing. This area, because of
its disturbance, was not shovel tested (Figure 3). As stated above, shovel testing was
concentrated on areas that appeared to be most likely to contain evidence of prehistoric
or historic utilization. The vast majority of tests were excavated along the top of the
ridge with additional tests placed on the slopes and on a terrace that is below the ridge
on the east side of the project area (ST 30-33).
Report Preparation
This task was performed by the Principal Investigator. Field notes were typed,
figures drafted, and a report prepared for review by the Department of Antiquities
Protection. Once the report has been approved copies will be submitted to the
Department of Antiquities Protection and the client.

RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS
The records check at TARL and the BVRA library revealed several major
reservoir projects have been conducted in the county as well as other small area
investigations, many of which did not locate sites. Most of the sites recorded in
Anderson County were probably located during the Lake Palestine survey (reference to
this work not found) and a survey of the Trinity River basin (Richner and Bagot 1978).
Both endeavors were conducted by Southern Methodist University. According to
Carolyn Spock (personal communication, June 10, 1994), there was a surge of site
recording for the county during 1979 (62 sites), 1980 (62 sites), and 1981 (79 sites).
Most of these are believed to represent TARL numbers being assigned to previously
recorded sites by Southern Methodist University from the Lake Palestine and Trinity
River Basin projects. The current project located both prehistoric and historic artifacts.
Two prehistoric sites were found and recorded with TARL as 41AN141 and 41AN142
(Figures 2-3). These sites are situated on a ridge that overlooks the floodplain of
Howard Creek to the north and east. Much of the ridge contains clay at or near the
surface. The sites, however, were found in areas where sandy soils extended to depths
of one meter.
41AN141
This site is described in this report as an open campsite of unknown age. Only
two artifacts were found in the site area. A chert flake that appears to have been
produced by soft hammer percussion was found 40 cm in ST 3, and a chert flake
(manufacturing technique unknown) was found in ST 10 at 40 cm. The two positive
tests, approximately 40 meters apart, were surrounded by additional shovel tests, all of
which were sterile. Consequently, the east-west dimensions of the site are not known.
The northern boundary of the site is marked by the slope of the ridge to the floodplain.
Part of this site is located in the current project area with the remainder in the 1.9 acre
tract proposed for YMCA construction.
41AN142
This site is described in this report as an open campsite of unknown age. Only
two artifacts were found in the site area. A chert flake (manufacturing technique
unknown) was found at 40-50 cm below the ground surface in ST 40, and a chert flake
(manufacturing technique unknown) was found at 40 cm in ST 45, 8.20 meters from ST
40. The two positive tests were surrounded by additional shovel tests, all of which were
sterile. Based on this information it is estimated that the site area is approximately 10 x
25 meters in size. The eastern boundary is marked by the slope of the ridge to the
floodplain. This entire site is located in the current project area.

Isolated Find
A glass bottle was found on the surface (Figure 3) in the vicinity of 41AN141. At
this time analysis of this specimen has not been formally conducted, but it is believed
that the date of manufacture is sometime between the late 19th and early 20th centuries
based on the method of manufacture. Formal analysis will determine if the bottle was
made by the semi-automatic or automatic method. A seam is present on both sides and
extends from the vacuum cutoff scar at the base of the bottle to the lip that is flared.
The bottle was sealed or closed with a cork. The shoulders are rounded. The brown
color suggests this specimen could have been used for a variety of products such as
medicine or chemicals. The following measurements have been taken: neck (24 mm),
maximum diameter of opening (33 mm), outside diameter of bottle (90 mm), and neck
height (23.5 mm). The vacuum cutoff scar contains the following numbers:

The two prehistoric sites are small in size and probably represent a brief
occupation. One explanation may be the flakes were discarded after a single knapping
incident while utilizing the vantage point of the landform. Their small size and paucity of
cultural materials suggest these sites possess little, if any, research potential and are
not worthy of additional work. The historic bottle is an isolated find. Since no evidence
was found of a historic site in this location no additional work is necessary for this area.

12

RECOMMENDATIONS
The two prehistoric sites and the isolated historic find are not considered to
possess research potential. Therefore, no additional work is considered necessary for
the project area and it is recommended that construction be allowed to proceed as
planned. It is suggested that any subsurface disturbance in the two prehistoric site
localities proceed with caution. If additional cultural materials are uncovered in any of
these areas all work should cease until the situation can be evaluated by the
Department of Antiquities Protection.
