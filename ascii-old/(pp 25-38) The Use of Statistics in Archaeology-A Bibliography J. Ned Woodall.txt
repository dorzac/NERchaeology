The Use of Statistics In Archaeology -- A Bibliography
compiled by
J. NED WOODALL

INTRODUCTION
Statistics as used in the following bibliography refers mainly to
inductive, as opposed to descriptive, statistics. By descriptive statistics
is meant the use of certain summarizing measures to reduce an unwieldy mass of data in order that it can be more easily understood.
These measures may be percentages, means, standard deviations, histograms, or other devices; all share the common characteristic of functioning to condense a collection of facts. Examples can be found in
ahnost any archaeological monograph. Inductive statistics differs in that
the properties of a population (or "universe") are inferred by examining a sample drawn from that population. Involved is probability
theory and sampling techniques, and for this reason articles dealing
with statistical sampling of archaeological deposits are included in the
bibliography.
In compiling references the use of a statistical test of significance
usually determined the inclusion of any particular essay. Inductive
statistics makes use of an ever-increasing number of such tests, but the
one most widely favored by arehaeo!ogists is the chi-square test of
independence. The Brainerd-l~obinson technique and related tests
such as that of Meighan (1959) and M. Ascher (1959) are measures
of association between two variables. These can be understood as
inductive in that the non-randomness of the distribution of the two
variables (the correlation )-as demonstrated by the sample-points to
a similar non-random distribution in the universe.
In the bibliography below, those references with no annotation following were not examined first-hand. A few were included only on the
basis of a suggestive title, while others were obtained from the bibliographies of sources available to me.
