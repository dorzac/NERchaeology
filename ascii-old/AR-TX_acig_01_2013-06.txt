Abstract
In late February and early March of 2012, prior to a change in ownership (from public to
private) of the easement of the proposed West Bee Cave Wastewater Interceptor Line
in Bee Cave, Texas, archeologists from aci consulting conducted a pedestrian survey
and shovel testing in accordance with CTA and THC guidelines along an area of
potential effect (APE) comprising a 9,144-linear-foot by 100-foot-wide (21 acres) portion
of a proposed 13,914-linear-foot wastewater line under Texas Antiquities Code Permit
#6178. The remaining 4,770 linear feet of the proposed wastewater line easement was
either subject to previous survey (2,900 linear feet) or not subject to survey originally
due to lack of right of entry by the landowners (1,870 linear feet). Following the change
in ownership of the easement, a cultural resources survey was no longer required in
order to be in compliance with Texas Administrative Code (13 TAC 26.20[2]). However,
compliance under Section 106 of the National Historic Preservation Act of 1966, as
amended, for Section 404 of the Clean Water Act as regulated by the US Army Corps of
Engineers (USACE) is still required. Ann M. Scott served as Principal Investigator, and
Robin Benson Barnes served as Project Archeologist. In order to comply with the permit
requirements, records from this investigation will be curated at the Texas Archeological
Research Laboratory.
A portion of the previously recorded site 41TV268 located in the APE within the right-of­
way (ROW) of Hamilton Pool Rd. was determined not eligible for inclusion on the
National Register of Historic Places (NRHP) or for listing as a State Archeological
Landmark (SAL) (Nash 2005). During the cultural resources survey conducted by aci
consulting, an Archaic projectile point was discovered and recorded as an isolated find,
and two historic rock walls that intersect the easement were documented. Since this
investigation, the project alignment has been revised, resulting in the avoidance of one
rock wall. The other rock wall could be avoided by trenching along a driveway where a
portion of the rock wall has already been dismantled. In addition, two new sites,
41TV2413 and 41TV2414, were discovered and recorded. Site 41TV2413 is a
prehistoric lithic scatter. Due to the lack of intact cultural deposits and the level of
disturbance at the site, the site is recommended as not eligible for inclusion on the
NRHP or for listing as a SAL. Site 41TV2414 has both prehistoric and historic
components. The prehistoric component of site 41TV2414 does not contain intact
cultural deposits and does not contribute to the eligibility of the site for NRHP inclusion
or SAL listing. Planned archival work and additional investigation regarding the historic
feature within the project APE were not completed prior to the change in ownership of
the easement. Without this additional information, it was not possible to make a
determination considering the eligibility of the historic component of site 41TV2414 for
inclusion on the NRHP or for listing as a SAL.

i

Additional archival work and the collection of additional information regarding the
historic feature within the APE is recommended at site 41TV2414 if the site will be
impacted by a project requiring compliance with the Texas Antiquities Code or with
Section 106 in the future. Based on the results of this archeological survey, no further
archeological work is recommended at sites 41TV2413 and 41TV268.

1.0 INTRODUCTION
A Texas Antiquities Permit Application was submitted to the Texas Historical
Commission (THC) on behalf of Masonwood 71, Ltd. for the development of the West
Bee Cave Wastewater Interceptor Line in the City of Bee Cave, Travis County, Texas.
At the time of the permit application, the wastewater line easement was owned by the
Lower Colorado River Authority (LCRA), a public entity, resulting in the requirement of
an intensive archeological investigation along the alignment in order to comply with the
Texas Antiquities Code (TAC). In addition, a portion of the alignment was on public land
(City of Austin), requiring a survey be conducted per TAC, Chapter 26, Rules and
Regulations. A realignment of the line in May 2012 excluded the City of Austin property.
The THC issued TAC Permit #6178 to aci consulting on March 7, 2012, although aci
had received the permit number and permission to conduct the survey from the project
reviewer via email on February 27, 2012. Fieldwork was initiated shortly thereafter but
stopped later in March due to right-of-entry issues. On August 7, 2012, the LCRA wrote
to the THC to request that the permit be cancelled as the LCRA was no longer involved
in the project. The ownership of the project facility was transferred to the West Travis
County Public Utility Agency from the LCRA. Following consultation with the THC and
Masonwood 71, Ltd., it was agreed that aci consulting would submit a report on the field
work that had already been accomplished in the proposed wastewater line easement
prior to the change in ownership of the easement.
The proposed alignment in large part parallels Little Barton Creek, north of Little Barton
Creek and south of SH 71 and Hamilton Pool Road (RM 3238) (Figures 1 and 2). The
alignment is approximately 2 miles in length, and the width of the construction easement
is 100 feet. The proposed wastewater line easement begins 0.6 miles east of the
intersection of SH 71 and Hamilton Pool Road between Spanish Oaks Club and Great
Divide and ends approximately 1.6 miles west of the SH 71 and Hamilton Pool Road
intersection (see Figure 1). At the time of the transfer in ownership, 65 percent of the
proposed wastewater line (9,144 linear feet/2787 meters) had been surveyed. Of the
remaining 4,770 linear feet (1454 meters), 2,900 linear feet (884 meters) was subject to
a previous cultural resources survey (Nash 2005) and 1,870 linear feet (570 meters)
was not subject to pedestrian survey.
The overall investigation included pedestrian survey, photography, subsurface testing
(shovel testing), site recording, NRHP and SAL eligibility assessments when possible,
data analysis, preparation of a report in accordance with THC and Council of Texas
Archeologists (CTA) standards, and Section 106 compliance for Section 404 of the
Clean Water Act.

2.0 BACKGROUND INFORMATION
2.1 Environmental Setting
The project area is located in central Texas along the eastern edge of the Edwards
Plateau in the Balcones Canyonlands (Griffith et al. 2007). The Balcones Canyonlands
are approximately 1000 feet higher in elevation than the Gulf Coastal Plain to the east.
Erosion along the edge of the Edwards Plateau has resulted in steep, stair-step
topography characterized by canyons, sinkholes, and karsts. The Balcones
Canyonlands are relatively well watered in comparison to the larger Edwards Plateau
and the Blackland Prairie to the east. The climate in Travis County is temperate humid
subtropical. Average annual temperature is 69º F; average maximum high is 97º F
occurring in July; average maximum low is 35º F occurring in January.
The relative abundance of moisture and the varied elevations within the canyonlands
have resulted in diverse habitats which have led to high species diversity and the
continued presence of endemic and endangered species. Habitats include riparian
forests and deciduous north slope forests as well as drought tolerant evergreen
woodlands. Oak savanna and remnants of grasslands are found in the canyon divides.
Primary game species are the white tailed deer and Rio Grande wild turkey. Exotic
game and wild boar are also present and compete with native species (Griffin et al.
2007).
2.2 Soils
Soils in this area are classified as Brackett Association and Tarrant-Speck Association
(Figure 3). The Brackett Association is composed of shallow, gravelly, calcareous loamy
soils overlying interbedded limestones and marl (SCS 1974). The Tarrant-Speck
Association is composed of shallow loamy soils and very shallow, stony clayey soils
overlying limestone (SCS 1974). Soil types (SCS 1974) include:
Brackett soils, rolling (B1D) – This soil is typically found along undulating to rolling
topography over interbedded limestone and marl in individual areas over 1,000 acres in
size. The surface layer is made up of 75% broken limestone fragments, with the
addition of gravelly clay loam, gravelly loam, loam, or clay loam. This unit is shallow and
well drained, and the permeability is moderately slow with a low water capacity.
Speck stony clay loam, 1 to 5 percent slopes (SsC) – This soil occupies smooth, gently
undulating topography in irregularly shaped areas ranging from 100 to 1,000 acres. The
surface is covered with many stones and pebbles with noncalcareous, reddish-brown
clay loam about 14 inches thick beneath. This is followed by a dark reddish-brown
gravelly clay extending 18 inches with underlying limestone bedrock. Speck soil type

4

consists of shallow, well-drained soils overlying limestone. The available water capacity
is low, and the soil is slowly permeable.
Tarrant soils, rolling (TaD) – This soil occupies complex slopes in broad areas ranging
from 100 to 1,000 acres in size. The calcareous soil has an eight-inch top layer of dark
grayish-brown stony clay that is underlain by limestone. It is slowly permeable with a
low available water capacity; this soil is shallow and well drained.
Volente complex, 1 to 8 percent slopes (VoD) – This complex is mainly found in long
valleys. The surface layer is dark grayish-brown silty clay loam about 22 inches thick
over dark-brown silty clay loam over dark-brown silty clay. The next layer is brown silty
clay with an underlying reddish-yellow clay loam. This slowly permeable soil has a high
available water capacity and is well drained.

The Late Prehistoric saw the migration of several new linguistic groups, primarily from
the Great Plains, into the region. The introduction of ceramics into the archeological
record takes place in the region during this time as well. The movement of Europeans
inland from the coast and north from Mexico ended the prehistoric era.
2.4 Historic Background
Alvar Nuñez Cabeza de Vaca and the remaining survivors of the Narvaez expedition
were the first Europeans known to have set foot in modern-day Texas; they landed on
the Texas coast following a shipwreck in 1528 (Chipman 1992). Between 1528 and the
late 1600s, Spanish excursions into Texas were limited. The first European known to
enter Travis County was Domingo Terán de los Ríos during a reconnaissance tour.
Later Spanish incursions recorded insightful information on various Native American
tribes, collectively referred to as the Coahuiltecans, who at one point lived in the area
around modern-day San Antonio. Late seventeenth century accounts describe these
people as family units of hunter gatherers that resided near streams and springs, in
areas conducive to nut harvesting. These camps were revisited on a seasonal basis,
allowing interaction with different groups along the way as well as the hunting of bison in
open grassland settings (Campbell 1983; Hester 1989). By the eighteenth century, the
cultural integrity of these native groups was significantly compromised by European
settlers and invasive neighboring Native American groups, such as the Tonkawa and
the Lipan Apache, made possible through access to European horses. Efficiently skilled
Comanche horsemen, in turn, displaced the Lipan Apache culture, continuously raiding
European and Native American settlements alike in Central Texas (Hester 1989). In
response to the continuous threat of Apache and Comanche raiders, as well as the
French incursion into East Texas, a series of Spanish missions and presidios were
erected along the San Antonio River during the eighteenth century. The Spanish
governor of Coahuila and Texas, the Marques de San Miguel de Aguayo, established
San Antonio as the focus of European settlement (Cox 1997). Anglo-American
settlement in the area began with numerous land grants from Mexico following its
independence from Spain in 1821.
Mirabeau Lamar, while serving as President of the Republic of Texas, wanted to locate
a site where a new capital city for Texas could be planned, based on the layout of
Washington D.C. at the time. While hunting buffalo with a Ranger detachment in 1838,
Lamar camped at the small settlement of Waterloo at the confluence of Shoal Creek
and the Colorado River. The ambience of the location impressed Lamar, and the site
was chosen over Mina (Bastrop) as the new capital of Texas. The new capital of
Waterloo was renamed after Stephen F. Austin in 1839. Travis County was named after
William Barret Travis, who perished defending the Alamo in 1836. Texas prospered as
an independent republic for ten years, eventually joining the United States in 1845. The
Civil War proved detrimental to Austin’s economy, but conditions improved during the
1880s, particularly with the arrival of various rail roads (Smyrl 2012b).

The proposed project is located just to the west of the city of Bee Cave, about twelve
miles west of Austin. Bee Cave was aptly named after a local cave that was home to
wild bees. Prior to a population increase beginning in the 1980s, Bee Cave was home to
few residents. In the mid 1880s, the recorded population was 20. By 1914, there were
54 residents and the population remained at approximately this level until 1990 when
the population increased to over 200 residents. At last count, Bee Cave was home to
656 residents in 2000. The Bee Cave post office opened in 1871 and then closed in
1915 when residents received mail through Cedar Valley. In the mid-1880s, records
indicate that Bee Cave was home to a steam gristmill, cotton gin, general store, church,
and school. Bee Cave currently has its own school district, parks, recreational facilities,
and library (Smyrl 2012a).

3.0 LITERATURE REVIEW
A literature review of the THC Archeological and Historic Sites databases, historic
maps, and records from the Texas Archeological Research Laboratory (TARL) revealed
that three sites have been recorded within or adjacent to the limits of the proposed
alignment (Figure 4) and 38 sites have been recorded within one mile of the proposed
project. The three sites recorded within or adjacent to the alignment are 41TV393,
41TV1759, and 41TV268.
Sites 41TV393 and 41TV1759 have been recorded within the proposed APE and are of
unknown eligibility for inclusion of the National Register of Historic Places (NRHP) or
listing as State Archeological Landmarks (SALs). Site 41TV393 is located in a cultivated
field overlooking Little Barton Creek. Flakes, cores, and tool fragments were noted on
the surface. Archeologists from Espey Huston & Associates, Inc. noted that the site is
minimally disturbed by plowing and may be deep and well stratified.
Site 41TV1759 is a lithic procurement site and historic scatter located on a terrace
above Little Barton Creek and adjacent to the portion of the project area that was not
surveyed due to right-of-entry issues. A historic limestone wall forms the southern
boundary of the site, but based on the site records it is unclear where this wall is located
relative to the proposed alignment. No other historic structures were recorded but a few
historic artifacts were observed. Observed evidence of chert tool production and natural
chert outcrops led to categorization of the prehistoric component of the site as a lithic
procurement location.
The third site, 41TV268, is a lithic procurement site located along the western end of the
proposed alignment. The site is located on two hill tops north of Little Barton Creek.
Shovel testing indicated that buried deposits were not present, leading to the
recommendation that the site is not eligible for inclusion on the NRHP (Nash 2005).
Of the 38 sites located within one mile of the project alignment, 22 are prehistoric, six
are historic, five have prehistoric and historic components, and five are lacking
documentation. All sites within one mile of the project area are listed in Table 2. Sites
within the project APE are shaded in light gray for ease of identification.
Of the six historic sites, three are cemeteries, including the Ottens Cemetery
(41TV626), Freitag Cemetery (41TV883), and an unnamed cemetery (41TV1607). The
Ottens cemetery is a small family cemetery of seven graves dating from the late 19th
century to World War II, located just west of the confluence of Little Barton Creek and
Owl Hollow, approximately 100 meters south of the project area. The Freitag Cemetery
has an unknown number of grave sites, but dates are noted between 1865 to 1928 in
the records. The unnamed cemetery, part of the larger historic Site 41TV1607, consists
10

of two graves of the Pecht family. These burials are probably associated with the Pecht
Family Cemetery adjacent to Site 41TV1607. In addition, other cemeteries not recorded
as archeological sites are located within one mile of the project area. These include the
White Rock, Carl Beck, Bee Cave Baptist Church, and Pecht cemeteries.

4.0 METHODOLOGY
4.1 Pedestrian Survey
After a review of the current archeological sites data, a 100% pedestrian survey
of the 9,144-linear-foot portion (65%) of the 100-foot-wide project APE was
conducted to locate any archeological or historical sites that may be adversely
affected by construction of the wastewater line. Survey methods were in
compliance with THC/CTA survey standards for the portion of the project area
that was surveyed before the change in ownership of the easement. The subject
area was walked in parallel transects spaced no greater than 30 meters apart. A
sufficient number of shovel tests were excavated in order to delimit the horizontal
and vertical extent of the sites encountered during the survey.
Two newly discovered sites were investigated and recorded on TexSite
Archeological Data Collection forms (digital) and submitted to TARL. This was a
non-collection survey. Diagnostic artifacts were photographed in the field. The
newly recorded sites were evaluated for potential significance and NRHP
inclusion or SAL listing eligibility based on the results of the shovel tests and
surface inspection. The survey methodology used complies with THC/CTA
standards for site investigation.
4.2 Subsurface Examination
Fifty-three shovel tests were excavated in areas with less than 30% surface
visibility and/or potential for buried cultural horizons. The shovel tests were at
least 30 centimeters (cm) in diameter and excavated to the bottom of Holocene
deposits, when possible. The shovel tests were dug in levels no thicker than 20
cm, and the excavated sediments were screened through ¼-inch hardware cloth
or troweled through or sorted by hand when sediment would not pass through the
screen due to moisture level. The depth of deposits found in the shovel tests
indicated that backhoe trenching was not necessary in the surveyed portions of
the easement.
4.3 Data Collection
Shovel test locations were recorded using a handheld GPS, and shovel test data
were recorded using a task-specific form. General project photographs were
taken in addition to photographs of sites and jurisdictional water crossings.
Records, including field notes, were prepared to meet the curation standards of
the Texas Archeological Research Laboratory.

15

5.0 RESULTS OF INVESTIGATION
During the intensive cultural resources survey two sites, 41TV2413 and
41TV2414, were discovered and recorded. An isolated find, an Archaic projectile
point, was found on a residential lot during the pedestrian survey. The project
APE also crosses historic rock walls in two locations; these were mapped and
photographed. Shovel test locations (n=53), site boundaries, and the rock wall
crossings are shown in Figure 5, and shovel test records have been compiled in
Appendix 1. No evidence of previously recorded site 41TV393 (see Figure 4) was
observed in the easement. The portion of the project APE adjacent to previously
recorded site 41TV1759 (see Figure 4) was not surveyed. In addition, four
jurisdictional water crossings were evaluated for the presence of intact cultural
deposits to comply with Section 106 under Section 404 of the Clean Water Act.

16

5.1 Site 41TV2413
Site 41TV2413 is a prehistoric lithic scatter located approximately 110 meters
north of Little Barton Creek and 110 meters south of Hamilton Pool Road (Figure
6). The ground surface slopes gently to the south toward Little Barton Creek. The
site is exposed in an area where brush has been cleared (Figure 7). Remaining
vegetation includes grass, cactus, Ashe juniper, and live oak. The site is located
on a deflated surface with exposed gravels and patches of exposed bedrock.
While the soils map indicates that the site is located in the coarser-grained
Volente Complex soils near the transition to the thinner Brackett soil, the
pedestrian survey revealed that the site is located in Brackett soils.
The site consists of a light scatter of artifacts, primarily lithics and some burned
rock. The burned rock is scattered, and no intact features were observed. Lithics
include flakes, tested cobbles, and some thick bifaces. No temporally diagnostic
artifacts were observed. The artifacts, especially on the east side of the site, may
have been re-deposited by sheet wash. One shovel test was dug within the site
boundaries where there was enough sediment to dig. No artifacts were present in
the screened sediment.
This site is recommended as not eligible for inclusion on the NRHP or listing as a
SAL due to the lack of intact deposits and the disturbed nature of the existing
deposits. A revised project alignment does not impact site 41TV2413. No further
work is recommended.

18

Figure 7. Site 41TV2413, showing brush clearing, dirt road, deflated surface

5.2 Site 41TV2414
Site 41TV2414 is located on a gently sloping terrace north of Little Barton Creek
(Figure 8). The site has both prehistoric and historic components. Vegetation
consists of grasses, forbs, and a few live oak trees in an area that was previously
plowed.
The prehistoric component of the site consists of a surface lithic scatter. The four
excavated shovel tests yielded a few lithics within the plow zone. Shovel tests
indicated that sediment depth above bedrock averages 35 cm and is within the
plow zone. Surface artifacts include numerous primary, secondary, and tertiary
flakes, one thick biface, and one thin biface fragment. (Figure 9). A second thin
biface fragment was found in a shovel test. No temporally diagnostic artifacts
were observed. Additional shovel tests were not excavated due to the termination
of the work due to the access issues and later change in ownership of the
easement. However, the four shovel tests are likely representative of the site
within the easement.
20

Within the project APE, the historic component consists of a scatter of historic
artifacts and a subterranean rock feature. Artifacts include green glass, blue
glass, a Coca Cola bottle fragment, a hinge, window screen, metal fragments,
milk glass, clear glass, whiteware ceramics, and flagstone (Figure 10). The
feature was only partially recorded prior to the termination of work because of
access issues. The feature consists of an earthen mound with exposed rock
alignments (possibly remains of a structure foundation) and an adjacent belowground structure constructed from cut limestone blocks. The subterranean
feature is rectangular and approximately 5 meters by 5 meters in size (Figure
11). The purpose of the feature is unclear, in part because it is currently filled
with bales of barbed wire and brush. The tops of two rock walls are exposed in a
low earthen mound adjacent to the subterranean feature. Remnants of a rock
wall run from east to west just to the north of the feature.
While only the portion of the site within the easement will be evaluated as part of
this project, a number of historic buildings can be seen from the easement. The
landowner confirmed that a wooden structure represents the remains of a cabin
built in the late 1800s by his ancestors. Another house on the lot was built in the
1940s. The landowner indicated that the house had been remodeled, including
the removal of the original windows and the addition of stone facing on the
outside of the home. Since then, the current owner re-installed the original
windows, which had been saved, and other interior additions made to the house
in the first renovation were removed. The stone facing remains. A cistern and a
windmill are also visible from the project easement.
The prehistoric component of site 41TV2414 does not contain intact cultural
deposits and does not contribute to the eligibility of the site for NRHP inclusion or
SAL listing. At this time it is not possible to make a recommendation concerning
the eligibility of the historic component of site 41TV2414 for inclusion on the
NRHP or listing as a SAL due to inadequate information. Additional archival work
regarding the property and a more complete accounting of the historic feature
located within the project easement were not completed before work on this
project was halted. Without this additional information regarding the site, a
determination of NRHP and SAL eligibility cannot be made with confidence.

5.3 Jurisdictional Waters
Six jurisdictional water crossings (WATs 1-6) were identified in the project APE
(see Figure 5). The May 2012 realignment of the route avoids WATs 1, 2, and 3.
WATs 1 and 2 are located in a portion of the easement that was previously
surveyed for cultural resources, and they were not re-examined during the
current field effort. Portions of site 41TV268 are located in this segment of the
easement. Site 41TV268 was previously determined not eligible for inclusion on
the NRHP or listing as a SAL (Nash 2005). Archeologists from aci consulting dug
two shovel tests on either side of an unnamed tributary of Little Barton Creek
(WAT 3) near the edge of previously recorded site 41TV268. No evidence of site
41TV268 was observed during pedestrian survey of the project easement which
is in the right-of-way of Hamilton Pool road or in the two shovel tests by the
tributary. The portion of the Hamilton Pool right-of-way near site 41TV268 has
been disturbed by grading and the construction of a berm.

24

Two shovel tests were dug at WAT 4, and no artifacts or other evidence of
prehistoric or historic activity was noted on the surface or in the shovel tests in
the vicinity of WAT 4. Both banks of WAT 5 are paved as part of a driveway for a
private residence (Figure 12). The banks of WAT 6 are located within the
disturbed right-of-way of Great Divide Drive. The unnamed tributary of Little
Barton Creek crossed under Great Divide Drive in a culvert at WAT 6.

Figure 12. WAT 5

5.4 Isolated Find
A single projectile point was found further within the project easement on a
residential lot (see Figure 5). The point is patinated and is missing the tip and
part of the base. Because the point is incomplete, type identification was not
possible although it appears to be Archaic and to share characteristics of the
Ensor and Martindale types.

25

5.5 Rock Walls
A number of rock walls were observed during the pedestrian survey. GPS points
were taken in the two locations where the rock walls intersect the project APE, as
can be seen in Figure 5. The project alignment has been revised so that the
western rock wall seen in Figure 5 will not be impacted. The eastern rock wall
(Figure 13) could be avoided by trenching along the driveway where a portion of
the rock wall has already been dismantled. Due to the termination of the project,
additional archival work regarding the association of the rock wall was not
completed.

6.0 CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS
Prior to a change in ownership of the easement of a proposed wastewater line in
Bee Cave, Texas, archeologists from aci consulting conducted a pedestrian
survey and shovel testing in accordance with CTA and THC guidelines along a
9,144-foot-long by 100-foot-wide (21 acres) portion of a proposed 13,914-linear­
foot wastewater line under Texas Antiquities Code Permit #6178. The remaining
4,770 linear feet of the proposed wastewater line easement was either previously
surveyed or not subject to survey due to landowner access issues and then the
subsequent change in ownership of the easement. Following the change in
ownership of the easement, a cultural resources assessment was no longer
required in order to be in compliance with Texas Administrative Code (13 TAC
26.20[2]). A cultural resource survey of jurisdictional water crossings is still
required for Section 106 compliance for Section 404 of the Clean Water Act.
Site 41TV268 was previously determined not eligible for inclusion on the NRHP
or listing as a SAL (Nash 2005). No evidence of site 41TV268 was observed
during pedestrian survey of the project APE close to site 41TV268 or in the
close-by shovel tests excavated at WAT 3 (jurisdictional water crossing).
Additional discoveries during the survey consist of an isolated Archaic projectile
point and two historic rock walls that intersect the easement. The project
alignment has been revised so that the western rock wall seen in Figure 5 will not
be impacted. The eastern rock wall could be avoided by trenching along the
driveway where a portion of the rock wall has already been dismantled.
Four jurisdictional water crossings were surveyed for cultural resources. Two
other crossings (WATs 1 and 2) were located in a previously surveyed area.
Pedestrian survey and shovel testing at WATs 3 and 4 yielded no artifacts or
other evidence of intact cultural deposits. Shovel tests were not excavated at
WATs 5 and 6 due to the disturbed nature of the deposits, and surface
examination indicates that there are no intact cultural resources at these
crossings. The May 2012 realignment of the project easement avoids WATs 1, 2,
and 3.
Two new sites, 41TV2413 and 41TV2414, were discovered and recorded. Site
41TV2413 is a prehistoric lithic scatter. Due to the lack of intact cultural deposits
and the level of disturbance at the site, the site is recommended as not eligible
for inclusion on the NRHP or listing as a SAL. Site 41TV2414 has both
prehistoric and historic components. The prehistoric component of site 41TV2414
does not contain intact cultural deposits and does not contribute to the eligibility
of the site for NRHP inclusion or SAL listing. The historic component of site
27

41TV2414 was not fully assessed due to the termination of work because of the
change in ownership of the easement. Planned archival work and additional
investigation regarding the historic feature within the easement were not
completed prior to the change in ownership of the easement. Without this
additional information, it is not possible to make a determination considering the
eligibility of site 41TV2414 for inclusion on the NRHP or for listing as a SAL.
Based on the results of this archeological survey, no further archeological work is
recommended at sites 41TV2413 and 41TV268. It must be noted that no level of
survey intensity can be guaranteed to locate all cultural features within a project
area. Therefore, should human remains or archeological resources be
discovered during the course of construction for this project, especially at the
jurisdictional water crossings, the client will contact the Texas Historical
Commission and/or the Fort Worth District USACE Archeologist for Section 404
compliance. Additional archival work and the collection of additional information
regarding the historic feature in the easement is recommended at site 41TV2414
if the site will be impacted by a project requiring compliance with the Texas
Antiquities Code or with Section 106 in the future.
