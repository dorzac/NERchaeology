Abstract
Flatrock Engineering and Environmental, Ltd. of San Antonio, Texas contracted with Tierras
Antiguas Archaeological Investigations (TAAI) to conduct cultural resources surveys of six well
connects emanating from the Countiss Trunkline, to be installed by Mockingbird Midstream Gas
Services, L.L.C. (Mockingbird) in north-central McMullen County, Texas. The projects were
entirely privately funded, and the properties across which the pipelines will cross are privately
owned; therefore, no Texas Antiquities Permit was required.
Two archaeologists conducted a 100-percent pedestrian survey with shovel testing of moderate
to high probability areas along the pipelines in September 2011, and February and March 2012.
During the surveys, it was obvious that much of these right-of-ways had in the recent past been
mechanically disturbed.
Four newly discovered prehistoric archaeological sites were documented (41MC680-683), as was
an isolated blade flake. No diagnostics were observed which would allow for an estimated
occupation time frame on any of the four sites. Our assessment of these four sites is that they are
shallow and heavily disturbed, and construction of the pipelines through these sites will not impact
significant cultural resources. In sum, Tierras Antiguas recommended that the development of the
Countiss Well Connects be allowed to proceed as planned. However, Tierras Antiguas further
recommended that if any additional, undiscovered cultural resources are encountered during
development, such finds should be examined and evaluated by Tierras Antiguas, or by any
qualified archaeological consultant.

Acknowledgments
There are mainly four individuals who are greatly appreciated, and whose efforts contributed to
the successful planning, organization, and completion of this project. They are Mr. David Black,
Ms. Judy Vader, and Mr. Ryan DeBarros, Project Managers at Flatrock Engineering and
Environmental, and Mr. Ronnie Glenewinkel, Environmental Coordinator at Mockingbird
Midstream. All were extremely amiable and helpful throughout the project, and their overall
knowledge of the project contributed significantly to our understanding of the project’s scope of
work.
In addition, I express my sincere gratitude to Tierras Antiguas staff archaeologist Belisario Silva,
who worked hard, long hours, and expressed an attitude and work ethic that ensured these
surveys were conducted in a thorough and professional manner.

Introduction
Flatrock Engineering and
Environmental, Ltd., requested
cultural resources background
reviews, with subsequent field
surveys of the proposed
Countiss Well Connects in
McMullen County, to be
developed by Mockingbird
Midstream Gas Services, L.L.C.
(Mockingbird), and hereinafter
occasionally referred to as the
Project Area (PA) (Figures 1
and 2). Tierras Antiguas
Archaeological Investigations
(TAAI) conducted the field
survey along the right-of-ways
in September 2011, and in
February and March 2012.

Modern
Environmental
Setting
Climate
and
Vegetation
McMullen County is
located in south-central
Texas mid-way between
the Gulf of Mexico to
the east, and the Rio
Grande to the west (see
Figure 1). The generally
flat to rolling terrain
ranges in elevation from
about 150-700 feet
above mean sea level.
Clayey and loamy soils
support the growth of

small predominately mesquite trees, and
thorny scrub brush with assorted cacti,
chaparrel, and grassy understory. With
its semi-arid environment, the counties
are generally frost-free from midFebruary through early December,
allowing for a 290-day growing season.
The average annual rainfall is about 24
inches. However, rainfall amounts vary
significantly from year to year, and the
high evapotranspiration effects in the
area effectively offset any beneficial
surplus of annual rainfall. This is another
reason irrigation systems are so
necessary, and commonly found in use
today throughout the area. Summers are
indeed hot and dry, with temperatures
consistently hovering above 980F,
although humidity is generally low
compared to environments closer to the
Gulf Coast. Overall, the area’s climate
can be classified as subtropical steppe.

(Leffler 1996; Peterson 1996).

Hydrology
The Nueces River and the Rio Grande
are the major southeasterly trending
rivers draining the South Texas region.
A subtle divide through the county
causes numerous intermittent creeks to
flow south into the Nueces River, and
others to drain toward the north, and
into the Frio River. Many drainages
intermittently flow into both rivers
during infrequent seasonal periods of
abundant rainfall. Although there are
many springs in the area, very few are
active due primarily to the dip of the
substrate shales which carry these
subterranean seeps to the south and
east. Ancient springs that may have
existed in the area at one time have
likely succumbed to overgrazing and
irrigation pumping during modern times Figure 4. Blair’s (1950) biotic provinces of Texas.

(Brune 1981). During our investigation of the Project Area, we observed no water flowing, or
niche pools.
Flora and Fauna
The Project Area lies within the South Texas Plain/Brush Country vegetation area as defined by
Gould (1975), and the regional flora of South Texas has been classified as being part of the
Tamaulipan biotic province extending out from northeast Mexico (Figures 3 and 4). This is the
only part of Texas where some vegetation exhibits growth throughout the year (Blair 1950; Map
2011). Thorny brush is the dominant vegetation today, but this is a relatively recent occurrence,
with a mix of woody and grassland species providing a savanna environment during prehistoric
times (Archer 1995; Black 1989; Hester 1980; Inglis 1964). The original vegetation was an open
grassland mixed with brushy chaparral. Oaks, pecan, and ash were common along perennial
streams. Due in part to overgrazing and the exclusion of fire, the invasion of woody species has
changed the vegetation into “Texas brush country” dominated by mesquite, acacia, spiny
hackberry, brazil, whitebrush, lotebrush, and others (Diamond et al. 1987:203-221). On sandy
soils, the brush includes mesquite with mixed grasses. In contrast, clay soils support mesquite
(Proposis juliflora), various species of Acacia, and mimosa, granjeno or desert hackberry (Celtis
pallida), lignum vitae (Porliera angustifolia), cenizo (Leucophyllum texanum), white brush
(Aloysia texana), prickly pear (Opuntia lindheeimeri), tasajillo (Opuntia leptocaulis), and species
of Condalia and Castela (Blair 1950).
The South Texas Plains/Brush Country exhibits some of the greatest mammalian species diversity
in the state. Sixty-one species of mammals, 36 snakes, 19 lizards, and several species of turtles,
salamanders, and frogs are present in the region (Blair 1950). Approximately 50 species of fish
have been identified in the lower Rio Grande (Lee et al. 1980).

Paleoenvironment
The paleoenvironment of south Texas is as varied as the landscape, and the South Texas
Paleoclimatic record contains significant gaps primarily due to the scarcity of deep, finely
stratified, and well-dated deposits (Stahle and Cleaveland 1995:51). To date, the best record of
paleoenvironmental reconstruction in South Texas has been accomplished by Robinson (1982)
from analysis of phytoliths from three archaeological sites in Live Oak County. Overall, the data
there along with data from other sites in Texas suggest that the waning of the Pleistocene, or lateglacial period, marked a transition from a cooler, wetter environment to one that steadily grew
warmer and drier, and more seasonal, with intermittent moist periods through about 6,000 years
ago.
Most researchers then generally agree that the period between 6,000 and 3,000 years ago was
much warmer and drier than today. Since that time, intermittent moist and dry intervals have
occurred over the past 3,000 years.
It is unlikely that the climate has changed significantly in the past few thousand years in the area
3

that would significantly induce vegetation changes. The greater changes have been induced by
human intervention through the clearing of wooded areas along the river and streams for
construction purposes, pumping more water for irrigation which has lowered water tables, and
overgrazing by livestock. Although there are still many seeps, springs, and streams in the area,
they most probably flowed with greater abundance during wetter intervals than exist at the
present time, providing an abundant resource for prehistoric occupants.

Cultural Chronology
The Countiss projects lie within the South Texas Archaeological region as defined by Hester
(1980, 1995, 2004; Figure 5). Refining a cultural chronology for south Texas is problematic, due
to the compressed nature of the archaeological record and the scarcity of stratified sites excavated
within the region. Hester (1995:433) acknowledges the paucity of information that exists for
south Texas and as such offers only a “general framework” for prehistoric periods particular to
the region (Figure 6). All dates are given as approximate years before present (B.P.), i.e., before
1950.
Paleoindian (11,200 - 7950 B.P.)
This period is estimated at between ca.11,200–7950 B.P. in south Texas (Hester 1995). The
Paleoindian period began toward the close of the Pleistocene. Diagnostic artifacts of the early
Paleoindian interval include Clovis and Folsom projectile points. The wide distribution of Clovistype points across most of North America and even into Central America suggests a wide
dispersal and interaction of the people who made them. Other artifacts associated with the Clovis
culture include bifaces and prismatic blades, engraved stones, bone and ivory points, stone bolas,
ochre, and shaft straighteners. During the late Paleoindian interval, the first stemmed lanceolate
points, such as Angostura, Golondrina, St. Mary’s Hall, and Barber (among a few others) appear.
In general, the Paleoindian adaptation has been considered to be one of small bands of nomadic,
big-game hunters following herds of Late Pleistocene fauna, including mammoth, mastodons,
bison, camel, and horse, across North America (Black 1989). More recently, emphasis has been
placed on the wide diversity of plants and animals used for subsistence by these early Americans,
such as turtles and tortoises, alligators, mice, badgers, and raccoons, although they undoubtedly
hunted the large animals as well (Collins 1995:381). Known Clovis sites include killsites, quarries,
caches, open campsites, ritual sites, and burials (Hester 1995:433–436). A Folsom interval
follows the Clovis. Folsom artifacts are fairly common in south Texas; however, no camp sites
or killsites have been found south of a large workshop, Pavo Real (41BX52), in Bexar County
(Hester 1995:434–435). Most Paleoindian finds in south Texas have consisted of surface lithic
scatters on upland terraces and ridges (Black 1989).
As the warming that marks the transition from Pleistocene to Holocene climates began to take
effect in Texas, prehistoric inhabitants adapted with changes in lifestyle. This climatic shift is also
marked by the decline and extinction of mammoth, mastodon, horse, camel, and giant bison
(Bison antiquus). Large gregarious game animals were perhaps extinct in Texas. Human hunters

4

were forced to concentrate on
deer, antelope, and other
medium-size or smaller game.
Changes in the subsistence base
required technological shifts that
mark the beginning of a new
cultural period known as the
Archaic.

Early Archaic (7950 - 4450
B.P.)
Hester (1995:436–438)
identifies the Early Archaic, with
Early Corner Notched and Early
Basal Notched dart points, as
roughly dating between 7950 to
4450 B.P. The extinction of
large herds of megafauna and
the changing climate at the
beginning of the Holocene
stimulated a behavioral change
by the Prehistoric inhabitants of
south Texas (McKinney 1981).
While the basic hunter-gatherer
adaptation probably remained
intact, an economic shift away
from big game hunting was
necessary. In general, more
intensive exploitation of local
and smaller resources such as
deer, fish, and plant bulbs is
indicated by greater densities of
ground-stone artifacts, firecracked rock cooking features,
and more specialized tools. Weir
(1976) speculates that Early
Archaic groups were small and
highly mobile, an inference
based on the fact that Early
Archaic sites are thinly
distributed and that diagnostic
projectile point types are seen Figure 5. South Texas Archaeological region cultural
across a wide area, including chronology.

most of Texas and northern Mexico. Story (1985) believes that population densities were low
during the Early Archaic, and that groups consisted of related individuals in small bands with “few
constraints on their mobility” (Story 1985:39). Their economy was based on the utilization of a
wide range of resources, especially such year-round resources as prickly pear and lechugilla, as
well as rodents, rabbits, and deer.
Middle Archaic (4450 - 2350 B.P.)
Hester (1995:438–441) suggests that the period between 4450 and 2350 B.P. reflects the Middle
Archaic in south Texas. The Middle Archaic appears to have been a time of increased population,
based on the large number of sites from this period (Story 1985:40; Weir 1976:125, 128). On the
South Texas Plains, exploitation of widely scattered, year-round resources such as prickly pear
continued (Campbell and Campbell 1981:13–15), as did hunting deer and rabbit. Weir (1976)
believes that the widely scattered bands prevalent in the Early Archaic now began to coalesce, at
least during the acorn-gathering season, into larger groups who shared the intensive work of
gathering and processing the acorn harvest (Weir 1976:126). Many researchers believe burned
rock middens are a result of this endeavor (Creel 1986; Prewitt 1991; Weir 1976). The common
presence of deer remains in burned rock middens encourages the view that deer processing took
place at burned rock midden sites. Bison bone is encountered in archaeological sites in south
Texas, at least occasionally, during all but the earliest part of the Middle Archaic (Dillehay 1974).
Cemeteries make their first appearance during this period, suggesting a movement toward less
mobility and perhaps territorialism. One of the earliest occurrences dating to the south Texas
Middle Archaic, is Loma Sandia in Live Oak County, which dates between ca. 2550 and 2750
B.P. (Taylor and Highley 1995).
Late Archaic (2350 - 1250 B.P.)
Hester believes the Late Archaic in south Texas may be defined as between 2350–1250 B.P,
Some researchers believe populations increased throughout the Late Archaic (Prewitt 1985),
while others feel populations remained the same or fell during this period (Black 1989:30).
Subsistence is assumed to have become less specialized on acorns, in favor of a broad spectrum
subsistence base (Black 1989:30). Story (1985:44–45) believes the presence of cemeteries
indicates that Late Archaic populations in central and south Texas were increasing and becoming
more territorial. Although inhabitants of the South Texas Plain near Brownsville and Rockport
had begun to make pottery by about 1750 B.P., the northern part of the plain was still “preceramic” until 1,000 years later (Story 1985:45–47). Late Archaic points tend to be much smaller
than Middle Archaic points.
Transitional Archaic (2250 - 1250 B.P.)
A late subperiod or interval of the Late Archaic is frequently referred to as the Terminal Archaic
or Transitional Archaic. Turner and Hester (1993) cite data placing the Transitional Archaic as
2250–1250 B.P. Although Hester may lump current data into a Late Archaic period, he cautions
that more evidence will likely result in what may be termed as a “Terminal Archaic” period during
the latter part of the Late Archaic in south Texas. This Terminal Archaic period is represented
by diagnostics such as Ensor, Frio, and Matamoras points which appear to overlap the Late
Archaic and Late Prehistoric periods (Hester 1995:442). Weir (1976) believes this marked a
6

transition period to localized area sites, a disappearance of burned rock middens and bison, and
a reappearance of highly mobile hunters and gatherers. Others (Black and McGraw 1985; Peter
1982; Skelton 1977) argue that in some locations burned rock middens did not disappear and sites
were more intensely occupied during the Transitional Archaic period.
Late Prehistoric (1250 - 420 B.P.)
The term “Late Prehistoric” is commonly used to designate the period following the Late Archaic
in south Texas. Generally, the Late Prehistoric period is thought of as spanning the period
between A. D. 700 - 1530 ([1250 - 420 B.P.] [Hester 1995]). A series of distinctive traits mark
the shift from the Archaic to the Late Prehistoric period, including the technological shift to the
bow and arrow and the introduction of pottery to central Texas and the northern South Texas
Plain (Black 1989:32; Story 1985:45–47). Two distinct phases recognized within the Late
Prehistoric are the Austin and Toyah. During the Austin phase, there appears to be a subtle
transition from expanding stem projectile points that may have been used as dart points, as well
as early arrow points. The most prevalent point found in Austin phase sites is the Scallorn arrow
point. Settlement shifts into rockshelters such as Scorpion Cave in Medina County (Highley et
al. 1978) and Classen Rockshelter in northern Bexar County (Fox and Fox 1967) have been
noted. Cemeteries from this period often reveal evidence of conflict (Black 1989:32).
Beginning rather abruptly at about 650 B.P., a shift in technology occurred. The Perdiz arrow
point may best represent the appearance of a distinct culture in south-central Texas lasting for
about 300 years, which archaeologists have labeled the Toyah phase. Hester (1995:444)
recognizes this phase as the “best documented Late Prehistoric pattern” throughout south Texas,
with dates ranging between ca. 650/700 to 300/350 B.P. (A.D. 1250/1300 to 1600/1650).
In addition to Perdiz points, evidence of a Toyah culture is manifested as bone-tempered pottery,
bone spatulates, awls, and beads, stone endscrapers, beveled knives, and expediently utilized
flakes. Briefly, expedient lithic technology involves removing flakes from a core in a nonstandard
manner; the purpose is to knock off sharp flakes for immediate use, selecting the ones that best
suit the need at the time. This technology differs from formal, standardized core reduction and
the manufacturing of formal, usually bifacial tools. Expedient lithic technology is a continent-wide
phenomonon indicative of increased sedentism, and is observed in Toyah assemblages in Texas.
Whether the Toyah phase seen in the south-central Texas archaeological record is a result of a
group of people moving into the region, or adapted technologies from the region’s periphery is
a matter of conjecture. Steele and Assad-Hunter (1986) argue for the occurrence of a distinct
change in diet between the Late Archaic and the Late Prehistoric components in two sites in the
Choke Canyon Reservoir area in south Texas. Analysis of the number of identified specimens
(NISP) shows a marked increase in artiodactyla elements present during the later part of the Late
Prehistoric, an increase largely due to the addition of bison to the “menu” (Steele and AssadHunter 1986:468).
Whether or not agriculture was practiced during this period in south Texas has not been
documented. There simply is not enough evidence to postulate there was ever a significant
7

presence of maize in the area. The later arrival of the Spanish during the later
Protohistoric/Historic period brought significant cultivars to south Texas.
Protohistoric/Historic (420 B.P. - present)
The end of the Late Prehistoric and beginning of the Historic period in south Texas is
characterized by written accounts of European contact with indigenous groups. The Protohistoric
period begins in 1528 when Spanish explorer Cabeza de Vaca traversed parts of southeast and
south Texas and left a diary of his five years spent traveling among the hunter-gatherers of Texas
and northern Mexico (e.g., Hallenbeck 1971). Cabeza de Vaca’s account of his stay with the
Miriami in 1533-34 indicates that groups of Native Americans would normally tether themselves
to the easily exploitable riverine environments in the fall, winter and summer, occasionally sending
a hunting party onto the grasslands to hunt deer. In the summer, many groups would live near
each other in the semiarid environs of South Texas to harvest prickly pear pads and other
succulents (Campbell and Campbell 1981:13-37).
Linguistically, early protohistoric accounts of the late 1500s indicate that a large group which
spoke Cohuilteco inhabited the area now known as south-central Texas. Coahuiltecan is a term
coined by Mexican linguists in the 1800s, and the name refers to the many small bands of Native
Americans who lived in northeastern Coahuila, Mexico and south Texas. The Coahuiltecans were
rapidly dispersed or killed during the Protohistoric period.
By the 1540s and 1550s Spanish ranchers had established large ranches in northern Mexico, with
several hundred thousand cattle, using Indian slaves as labor. Large mining ventures in northern
Mexico did the same. This encroachment from the south forced Native Americans to escape into
the south-central Texas region.
The period between de Vaca’s written account and the advent of Spanish missions in the late
1600s and early 1700s is referred to as the Protohistoric; a time when few, scant written
documents exist detailing Native American life outside the missions. The Historic period then, is
generally thought of as beginning in the 1700s.
Some 30 miles south of Eagle Pass, the Spanish established Mission San Juan Bautista in 1700
(now modern-day Guerrero). Early Spanish explorers then repeatedly traveled the Camino Real
enroute to newly established missions and settlements in today’s modern Texas throughout the
1700s and 1800s. Mexican families from across the river expanded into Texas, and these families
trace their roots to the early development of the area. In the ensuing years, lawlessness prevailed,
with saloons, gambling houses, outlaws, and slave hunters prevalent.

McMullen County Prehistory and History
Indian artifacts found in McMullen County indicate that the area has been occupied for about
11,000 years. Plentiful food sources such as wild game, fruits, seeds, and roots made the land
hospitable. Early technology included tools from wood and stone, woven basketry, sewed
rabbitskin robes, and a very effective weapon was the atlatl, a throwing stick that greatly
increased the deadliness of their spears (Leffler 1996). Perhaps as early as 1,300 years ago, they
learned to make pottery and to hunt with bows and arrows. During the seventeenth and
eighteenth centuries, the Coahuiltecan Indians native to McMullen County were squeezed out by
other Indian who were migrating into the area and by the Spanish, who were moving up from the
south. Many of the Coahuiltecans were taken to San Juan Bautista in Coahuila. Apaches and
Comanches moved in to take their place (Leffler 1996).
“In the earliest of written accounts, no permanent Spanish settlements seem to have been
established in the area now known as McMullen County. In 1828, the land was assigned to John
McMullen and James McGloin, who contracted to settle the area with 200 Catholic immigrants.
By 1835 the Mexican government had issued perhaps fifteen grants of land in the area of present
McMullen County to colonists associated with the McMullen-McGloin project. None of these
grantees actually settled on the land assigned to them, however. By 1836, when Texas seceded
from Mexico, the area remained populated almost entirely by the Indian bands that roamed
through the area.
When William Bollaert, an English land speculator, traveled through the area between the Nueces
and Frio rivers in 1844, for example, the only people he encountered were convicts who had
escaped from a prison in Laredo. Even after the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo definitively
assigned the Nueces Strip to Texas, outlaws and unfriendly Indians delayed development of the
area for years. By 1860, there were perhaps 100 settlers in the county. By the late 1860s and
early 1870s, a number of ranches had been established, mostly in the northern part of the county.
For protection, ranchers often grouped their dwellings together” (Leffler 1996).
Prehistoric Site Potential
Without written or oral accounts before the 1700s, it is difficult or impossible to truly say what
bands or tribes were within the modern political boundary of McMullen County before then. Only
cultural affiliations can be assigned to those groups, equating their technologies and apparent
lifestyles to the successive Paleo-Indian, Archaic, and Late Prehistoric periods. Archaeologists
have documented an assundry of prehistoric archaeological sites, including large open campsites
that are most commonly located along stream or river terraces with numerous campfires, where
a wide variety of stone tools, grinding stones, pottery sherds, and butchered animal remains are
found. Where gravels outcrop, either along eroded streambeds, or on higher terrain where more
ancient gravels are sometimes exposed in isolated pockets, one can expect stone chipping
stations, or prehistoric quarries.
Historic Site Potential
The earliest historic accounts of Native Americans in south Texas and perhaps the McMullen
9

county area, are those of Cabeza de Vaca. In the 1500s, Spanish explorer Cabeza de Vaca
traversed parts of southeast and south Texas and left a diary of his five years spent traveling
among the hunter-gatherers of Texas and northern Mexico (e.g., Covey 1961). His account of
his experiences in 1533–34 indicates that groups of Native Americans would normally tether
themselves to the easily exploitable riverine environments in the fall, winter, and summer,
occasionally sending a hunting party onto the grasslands to hunt deer. In the summer, many
groups would live near each other in the semiarid environs of south Texas to harvest prickly pear
pads and other succulents (Campbell and Campbell 1981:13–37).
By the 1540s and 1550s, Spanish ranchers had established large ranches in northern Mexico with
thousands of cattle, and using Native Americans as slave labor. This encroachment by the Spanish
forced groups from northern Mexico to flee into south Texas. In the 1700s and 1800s, there are
documented accounts of Spanish entradas passing through the area, but none have been noted
to establish any sort of permanent bases in present-day Mc Mullen county (Chipman 1992).
It was not until about 1865, that the surrounding frontier hinterlands that are now politically
known as Atascosa and Mc Mullen counties were considered safe enough for white settlers to
begin establishing smaller ranches and farmlands without complete annihilation by the many
roving bands of angry Comanche raiders from the north, as well as other displaced Native
American groups (Leffler 1996). In sum, there may be rare and isolated occurrences of early
ranching activities along the Countiss pipelines, but the expectations of encountering any
archaeological site of significance from the 1500s through the mid-1900s along these lines were
minimal.

Results of A Cultural Resources Background Review

The research by TAAI included:
1) A review of the most current literature documenting the prehistory and history of the
immediate area
2) A review of the Texas Historical Commission’s Texas Archeological Sites Atlas to identify
what cultural resource surveys have been conducted, and what archaeological sites have been
documented within one mile of the project area
3) A search of various websites that offer old maps of the PA
4) A literature review of both published and unpublished reports and manuscripts that describe
the types of archaeological sites that have been documented, and thus provide insight as to the
types of sites that may be expected either in the PA, or immediately adjacent to it

10

5) A review of a local soils map in order to evaluate the potential for intact and buried cultural
materials either within or immediately adjacent to the PA.
Archaeological Atlas Site Results
We preface this section by stating that although it presents the number of sites and their types
documented within each of the two counties, the results simply provide the data that is available.
In reality, the number of documented sites and their types are very heavily skewed based upon the
types of cultural resource surveys, and the areas of those surveys. That said, the data that is
available on the Texas Atlas is only as good as the areas of south Texas that the surveys represent.
Most of south Texas has never been subjected to formal cultural resource surveys, so it is
conceded that the true character of the archaeological record is very poorly understood.
Nevertheless, the few surveys that have been accomplished provide at least some aspect of what
the region looks like from an archaeological perspective.
McMullen County
There are 225 documented archaeological sites in McMullen County. Of those, 147 are prehistoric
open campsites with evidence that as a whole, open campsites in the county have been occupied
from the Paleoindian through the Historic periods. As with most of the region, many campsites are
situated on stream terraces, but there are also some in the uplands. Fifty-nine sites are classified
as lithic scatters, and generally these are located in the uplands and along stream cutbanks where
gravels outcrop. They also exhibit evidence of being used for the past 11,000 years. One quarry
site has been recorded in the county, as has a single sandstone burned rock midden. The only
prehistoric burial noted was found at one of the open campsites. Historic sites consist of local
family cemeteries with just a few burials in each, house sites and farmsteads from as early as the
1850s, and trash scatters (Atlas 2012).
Without written or oral accounts before the 1700s, it is difficult to nearly impossible to truly say
what bands or tribes were within the modern political boundaries of McMullen County before then.
Only cultural affiliations can be assigned to those groups, equating their technologies and apparent
lifestyles to the successive Paleo-Indian, Archaic, and Late Prehistoric periods. Archaeologists
have documented an assundry of prehistoric archaeological sites, including large open campsites
that are most commonly located along stream or river terraces with numerous campfires, where
a wide variety of stone tools, grinding stones, pottery sherds, and butchered animal remains are
found. Where gravels outcrop, either along eroded streambeds, or on higher terrain where more
ancient gravels are sometimes exposed in isolated pockets, one can expect stone chipping stations,
or prehistoric quarries.
Nevertheless, the lack of previously documented sites is thought to be a direct reflection of the
lack of cultural resource surveys near the PA that would have located sites, rather than the
probable non-existence of sites. In fact, the Project Area lies to the west of a large archaeological
survey conducted in anticipation of the construction of the Choke Canyon Reservoir (e.g., Hall
et al. 1981).
During that survey conducted in the 1980s, 116 prehistoric archaeological sites located in both
Live Oak and McMullen counties were documented, ranging in age from 350 years ago to 11,000
11

years ago. Through all the periods of Choke Canyon's history, humans subsisted by hunting and
gathering natural food resources available in the area. In addition, archaeologists from the Center
for Archaeological Research at the University of Texas at San Antonio conducted archaeological
investigations at eight historic sites at Choke Canyon Reservoir. A number of different types of
structures were investigated, the purpose being to extract as much information as possible about
architecture, lifestyles, and settlement patterns during the last half of the 19th century within the
reservoir area. Artifacts recovered helped recreate the life of the people, demonstrating how they
met the challenges of living in a frontier area, and how life changed after the Civil War and the
coming of law and order, railroads, and modern communications (Fox and Ward 1986).
Archaeological Sites and Surveys within at Least 1,000 Meters of the Proposed Countiss
Pipelines
Notably, no portion of the proposed Countiss pipelines had been subjected to a formal cultural
resources survey, and by implication, there were no documented archaeological sites within 1,000
meters of the right-of-ways. However, in our opinion, the terrain along certain areas of the Project
Area suggested a high probability for potentially significant sites to exist.
In addition, archaeologists from the Center for Archaeological Research at the University of Texas
at San Antonio conducted archaeological investigations at eight historic sites at Choke Canyon
Reservoir. A number of different types of structures were investigated, the purpose being to

the life of the people, demonstrating how they met the challenges of living in a frontier area, and
how life changed after the Civil War and the coming of law and order, railroads, and modern
communications (Fox and Ward 1986).
Old Maps, Aerial Photographs, Historic Research
A standard source of review is the extensive collection of online maps and aerial photographs
available at the Perry Castañeda Library at the University of Texas at Austin (Perry Castañeda
Library 2012). Although this source would normally prove invaluable for researching the
possibility of, and potential for, historic sites and structures to exist within one mile of a project
area, in this case the only old map found was a 1942 1:62,500' U.S. Army Corps of Engineers
Tactical map of the Franklin Settlement that revealed no structures within or adjacent to the
Countiss routes.
Nevertheless, the lack of comprehensive historic map and aerial information, coupled with the
paucity of cultural resources surveys within the area is possibly, and perhaps probably, why no
information is available regarding the presence of historic structures, ranching or industrial
activities, or persons of historic significance to the immediate area.
Technically, any structures old than 45 years are now considered of interest by the Texas
Historical Commission, and this should be considered when the pipeline right-of-way is
excavated. Historic sites recorded in McMullen County consist of local family cemeteries with

12

just a few burials in each, house sites and farmsteads from as early as the 1850s, and trash
scatters.

Soils
A review of county soils maps and publications online indicated that there are a multitude of
different soil types that will be encountered along the Countiss pipeline right-of-ways (Table 1;
Figure 6). These are of varying depths, with different sedimentation, deposition, and erosional
rates (Web Soil Survey 2012). However, terrace deposits in close proximity to streams offer the
highest potential for buried and intact archaeological deposits to exist. In this case, the line extends
across prime areas that prehistoric inhabitants likely occupied. The areas along and near Clear

Creek and San Miguel Creek possess a moderate to high potential for intact cultural deposits to
still be extant within broad as well as narrow terrace deposits.

Field Survey Goals, Methodology, and Levels of Effort
Goals
The project goals focused on archaeological issues that could be addressed by the types of data
obtained through pedestrian survey, along with limited shovel testing. The topics addressed were
site type, distribution, density, size, depth, and stratigraphy. The theoretical framework is
structured around patterns of settlement, mobility, subsistence, and social systems for the South
Texas region.
The goals of the project were to:
1)

locate and record cultural locations and sites in the project area using a systematic
survey methodology;

2)

quantify site size, as well as depth, and stratigraphy; and,

3)

place any diagnostic artifacts within the regional time frame.

Methods and Levels of Effort
Two archaeologists
conducted an intensive
100-percent pedestrian
survey along the
pipelines, meandering
back and forth across the
100-foot width of the
right-of-ways. Surface
visibility ranged from 70
to 100 percent (see for
example, Figure 7). All
cutbanks, and rodent and
mammal backdirt piles
along the right-of-way
were thoroughly
examined. In accordance
with a general “no
collect i on” pol i cy, Figure 7. E 2H Pipeline right-of-way; facing south-southeast.
cultural material of a
redundant nature, both prehistoric and historic, were not to be collected. Instead, they were to be
fully documented via sketches, field photographs, and copious notes.
Exceptions were to be made for diagnostic artifacts, particularly those artifacts which could be
considered as significant to the interpretation of Texas prehistory, such as Early Archaic15

Paleoindian transitional, or Paleoindian diagnostics. These were to be collected on a case-by-case
basis, and that decision was left up to the Principal Investigator and/or the Project Archaeologist.
Historic buildings, trash scatters, or other historic occurrences adjacent to the ROW were to be
documented with photographs and included in this report of investigations. A total of six shovel
tests were dug in 20-cm levels, and all sediments were screened through 1/4-inch wire mesh.
Following our designed research plan, any artifacts recovered from shovel tests were not to be
collected, but were to be placed in the upper 10 cm of the backfilled shovel test. The results of
shovel testing were fully documented on Shovel Test forms, are on file at the Tierras Antiguas
Archaeological Investigations office in Martindale, Texas, and may be made available upon
request.

Results of the Field Investigations
Four prehistoric open campsites and one Isolated Find were discovered along the right-of-ways.
Trinomials received from the Texas Archeological Research Laboratory at The University of Texas
at Austin for the four field sites (FS) are : FS1 - 41MC680; FS2 - 41MC681; FS3 - 41MC682;
FS4 - 41MC683. Their locations are depicted in Figure 8, and they are described below.

41MC680
Description
41MC680 (Figures 9 and
10) is a prehistoric open
campsite of an unknown
age, consisting of surface
fire-cracked rocks,
bifacial stone tools, and
chert debitage. It is
situated on a gentle
southeastern sloping
upland, midway between
Clear Creek and San
Miguel Creek. The site is
dissected by a two-track
road and a new graveled
lease road that has been
bladed to expose
cutbanks from 5-20 cm in
depth. Push piles are the
results of ranch
management and clearing
in the area. However, the
area is now overgrown
with secondary mesquite
and other thorny brush,
extremely sparse bunch
grasses, prickly pear and
other assorted cacti. In
February 2012, surface
visibility ranged from Figure 9. 41MC680 site map.
very good to excellent. Surface elevation at the site ranges from 300-305 feet above mean sea level
(amsl). Soil on the site consists of Brystal fine sandy loam (BsB), deep loams commonly found on
undulating convex-shaped uplands in north-central McMullen County (Web Soil Survey 2012).
The expectations of discovering intact archaeological deposits in these soils is minimal to about
9 inches (23 cm) below the surface.
Levels of Effort and Results
An inspection of the surface, along with shovel test results suggest that the site is spread across
approximately 3,850 square meters (see Figure 10). Fire-cracked rocks observed on the surface

17

likely represent scattered
hearth remnants.
Artifacts discovered on
the surface included firecracked rocks, nondiagnostic bifaces, core
fragments, and flakes (see
Figure 11).
Fine-grained cherts made
up approximately 95
percent of the material,
with the remaining
approximately 5 percent
consisting of fine and
coarse-grained quartzites.
Bifaces were observed
that exhibited middle and
late stages of reduction. Figure 10. 41LMC680 site shot; facing south-southeast.
Flake classifications included exterior core reduction, interior, and bifacial thinning, suggesting a
continuum of lithic reduction activities occurred at the site. The burned and fire-cracked rocks on
the surface were predominately chert.
Two Shovel Tests (STs)
excavated on the site
revealed pale brown, fine
sandy loam from 0-20
centimeters below the
surface (cmbs),
increasing in red clay
content, caliche fines,
threads, and nodules,
semi-cemented hardness
with depth, and red clay
hardpan at 20 cmbs. No
cultural materials were
found in either of the two
tests.
Site Summary,
Conclusions, and
Recommendations

Figure 11. Thin bifacial knife fragment found on the surface at
41MC680.
41MC680 appears to have been intensively used as an open campsite during an unknown
prehistoric period, or periods. The stone tools, debitage, and scattered fire-cracked rocks now lie
on an eroded and deflated surface that has apparently been mechanically cleared during ranch
18

management activities in the not too distant past, with a two-track road, an oil lease road, and a
new well pad causing further disturbance to the site’s integrity. Evidence of stone tool
manufacturing was evident, from core reduction through final stage bifaces, and multiple heavily
disturbed hearth features are probable. However, in its current eroded and palimpsest condition,
its research value is considered minimal. As such, Tierras Antiguas recommends that construction
of the Countiss G Pipeline as currently aligned be allowed to proceed with no further investigations
at this site.

41MC681
Description
41MC681 (Figures 12 and
13) is a prehistoric open
campsite of an unknown age,
consisting of small and
scattered fire-cracked rocks
and a unifacially flaked adze.
It is situated on a sloping
surface trending south 30
meters to Clear Creek. The
site is dissected by a bladed,
and now overgrown twotrack road and a cattle trail
perhaps 10 cm in depth.
Moderately dense small
thorny brush and grasses are
the understory to mesquite,
persimmon, and elms, with
vegetation thickening toward
Clear Creek. In February
2012, surface visibility
ranged from poor to very
good. Surface elevation at
the site ranges from 300-302
feet above mean sea level
(amsl). Soil on the site
consists of Cochina clay
(CmA), deep clay on
occasionally and frequently
flooded bottomlands in
north-central McMullen
County (Web Soil Survey
2012). The expectations of

19

discovering intact archaeological deposits in these soils is minimal to about 24 inches (60 cm)
below the surface.
Levels of Effort and Results
An inspection of the surface,
along with shovel test results
suggest that the horizontal extent
of artifacts on the surface is
roughly 23 meters (east -west) x
12 meters (north-south), or 276
square meters (see Figure 13).
The chert fire-cracked rocks
observed on the surface likely
represent scattered hearth
remnants. The only piece of
chipped stone discovered on the
surface was a crudely made
unifacial, unheated, chert adze
(Figure 14).

Figure 14. Crude adze found on the surface at 41MC681.

A single shovel test excavated on
the site revealed light brown silty clay from 0-20 cmbs, underlain with brown silty cloamy clay,
over hardpan clay and white caliche at 50 cmbs. The only possibly cultural materials found were
13 pieces of fire-cracked rocks less than 2 centimeters in size in the upper 20 cm.
Site Summary, Conclusions, and Recommendations
41MC681 appears to a relatively small open campsite briefly occupied during an unknown
prehistoric period and tethered to Clear Creek, likely flowing at least intermittently. The single
stone tool and widely dispersed fire-cracked rocks now lie on a heavily disturbed surface that has
apparently been mechanically cleared during ranch management activities in the not too distant
past, with an overgrown two-track road causing the primary disturbance. In its current condition,
its research value is considered minimal. As such, Tierras Antiguas recommends that construction
of the Countiss G Pipeline as currently aligned be allowed to proceed with no further investigations
at this site.

41MC682
Description
41MC682 (Figures 15 and 16) is a prehistoric open campsite of an unknown age, consisting of
scattered fire-cracked rocks, crude bifaces, and chert debitage. It is situated on an eroded slope

20

on the south bank of an
intermittent tributary of Clear
Creek. The slope is subtle to
steep nearer the drainage. The
right-of-way had been cleared
and shredded prior to our field
examination in September 2011.
However, the adjacent
vegetation consists of typical
riverine large elms, with smaller
cedars, thorny brush, and
lotebush as understory (see
Figure 16). Surface visibility at
that time averaged approximately
70 percent. Surface elevation at
the site ranges from 301-305 feet
above mean sea level (amsl). Soil
on the site consists of Brystal
fine sandy loam (BsB) (Web Soil
Survey 2012).
Levels of Effort and Results
An inspection of the surface
suggests that the horizontal
extent of artifacts on the surface
is roughly 45 meters (east -west)
x 45 meters (north-south), or
2,025 square meters (see Figure
15). The chert fire-cracked rocks
observed on the surface likely
represent scattered hearth
remnants. Chipped stone
artifacts discovered on the
surface included unheated and
crudely flaked chert bifaces, as
well as core reduction and
bifacial manufacturing flakes, all
resting on eroded and deflated
shallow soil.

period, or periods, near the
confluence of Clear Creek and
one of its deeply incised
intermittent drainages. Both were
likely flowing periodically in
prehistory, as they do in modern
times. Chert gravels were
observed in the immediate area,
and were likely exploited for the
manufacture of those bifaces
found on the site. The riverine, Figure 17. Selected artifacts on the surface at 41MC682 wooded area would have two crude bifaces and a bifacial manufacturing flake.
provided a source for fruits and
nuts, shelter for game animals as well as, and abundant mussels and fish. However, in its current
condition, its research value is considered minimal. As such, Tierras Antiguas recommends that
construction of the Countiss C 3H Pipeline as currently aligned be allowed to proceed with no
further investigations at this site.

41MC683
Description
41MC683 (Figures 18 and 19) is
a prehistoric open campsite of an
unknown age, consisting of
scattered fire-cracked rocks,
stone tools, and chert debitage.
It is located on an upland,
southeasterly sideslope with
scattered oak trees, moderately
dense mesquite trees, prickly
pear, and tasajillo. San Miguel
Creek is 200 meters to the
southwest. Surface elevation at
the site ranges from 300-302 feet
above mean sea level (amsl). Soil
on the site consists of Brystal
fine sandy loam (BsB) (Web Soil
Survey 2012).

such, surface visibility ranged
from 60 to 90 percent. An
inspection of the surface suggests
that the horizontal extent of
artifacts on the surface is roughly
35 meters (east-west) x 35
meters (north-south), or 1,225
square meters (see Figure 18).
The chert fire-cracked rocks
observed on the surface likely
represent scattered hearth
remnants, and the stone tools
represent both bifacial and
unifacial technology (Figure 20).

brown clay hardpan, with no
evidence of cultural material.
Site Summary, Conclusions,
and Recommendations
41MC683 was an open campsite
occupied during an unknown
prehistoric period, or periods, on
a sideslope 200 meters northeast
of San Miguel Creek. Exposed
chert gravels were were likely
exploited for the manufacture of
both bifacial and unifacial tools.
The upland environment likely

water and riverine environs of
San Miguel Creek.
In its current condition, the research value of 41MC683 is considered minimal. As such, Tierras
Antiguas recommends that construction of the Countiss C 3H Pipeline as currently aligned be
allowed to proceed with no further investigations at this site.

23

Isolated Find
A single isolated artifact was found on
the Countiss N Lateral Line at a location
shown in Figure 8. This specimen is a
tan, non-heat treated fine-grained chert
blade flake (Figure 21) found on a
heavily eroded and deflated hard claypan
surface. It exhibits a post-depositional
break on its distal end. Although not
diagnostic, blade technology is
commonly found in Late Prehistoric
assemblages.

isolate.

Survey Summary, Conclusions, and Recommendations

Two archaeologists conducted a 100-percent pedestrian survey with shovel testing of moderate
to high probability areas along the Countiss Well Connects pipelines in September 2011, and
February and March 2012. During the surveys, it was obvious that much of these right-of-ways
had in the recent past been mechanically disturbed.
Four newly discovered prehistoric archaeological sites were documented (41MC680-683), as was
an isolated blade flake. No diagnostics were observed which would allow for an estimated
occupation time frame on any of the four sites. Our assessment of these four sites is that they are
shallow and heavily disturbed, and construction of the pipeline through these sites will not impact
significant cultural resources.
In sum, Tierras Antiguas recommends that the development of the Countiss Well Connects be
allowed to proceed as planned. However, Tierras Antiguas further recommends that if any
additional, undiscovered cultural resources are encountered during development, such finds should
be examined and evaluated by Tierras Antiguas, or by any qualified archaeological consultant.
