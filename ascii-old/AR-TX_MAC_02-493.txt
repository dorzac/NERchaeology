ABSTRACT
On November 20, 2006, Moore Archeological Consulting, Inc., conducted a cultural
resource survey investigation of an approximately one acre tract in Harris County, Texas. The
objectives of the investigation were to locate and identify cultural materials, sites, or historic
properties within the proposed impact area, and to prepare management recommendations
regarding any identified resources. The investigations were conducted for S & B Infrastructure,
Ltd., and the Texas Department of Transportation (CSJ 0271-07-281), under Texas Antiquities
Permit Number 4324. An intensive pedestrian field survey of the project area was conducted, and
included both surface and subsurface (shovel test) examination. A total of 14 shovel tests were
excavated. The tests documented significant layers of modern fill and disturbance. No evidence
of archeological or historic remains or features was identified. Consequently, no further
archeological investigations are recommended. In the event that archeological deposits or
features should be encountered during construction, work should cease in the immediate vicinity
and the Archeology Division of the Texas Historical Commission contacted for further
consultation.

INTRODUCTION
On November 20, 2006, Moore
Archeological Consulting, Inc., conducted a
cultural resource survey investigation of an
approximately one acre tract in Harris
County, Texas.
The objectives of the
investigation were to locate and identify
cultural materials, sites, or historic
properties within the proposed impact area,
and
to
prepare
management
recommendations regarding any identified
resources. The investigations (MAC PN 05134) were conducted for S & B
Infrastructure, Ltd., and the Texas
Department of Transportation (CSJ 027107-281), under Texas Antiquities Permit
Number 4324.

intersection of Houston Avenue and White
Oak Bayou, and ends approximately 57 ft
(ca. 17 m) south of the intersection of
Houston Avenue and Alamo Street. The
total length of the project corridor is 1445 ft
(ca. 440 m). The existing ROW has a
maximum width of approximately 119 ft
(ca. 36 m), and will be the same for the
replacement bridge. The bridge itself will
be no more than approximately 65 ft (ca. 20
m) wide plus side slopes. It is expected that
the depth of impact will be no more than 6 ft
(ca. 1.8 m). This APE is based on the
project description provided to Moore
Archeological Consulting by S & B
Infrastructure.

The project area is depicted on the
Settegast, Texas 7.5' USGS topographic
quadrangle map (Figure 1). The proposed
project consists of the replacement of an
extant four-lane concrete bridge on Houston
Avenue where it crosses White Oak Bayou.
The project was an intensive linear survey
during which all work occurred within the
existing TxDOT right-of-way (ROW). No
right of entry was required.

An intensive pedestrian field survey
of the project area was conducted, and
included both surface and subsurface
(shovel test) examination (Figure 2; see
Appendix 1 for details). A total of 14 shovel
tests were excavated. The investigations
were conducted by project field archeologist
Randy Ferguson and field technician Kelly
Schexnayder, under the supervision of
project archeologist Douglas G. Mangum.
Roger Moore served as the projectâs
principal investigator.

The bridge replacement begins
approximately 110 ft (ca. 33 m) south of the

ENVIRONMENTAL BACKGROUND
Climate

Soils and Geology
Harris County is located within the
West Gulf Coastal Plain physiographic
province (Hunt 1974). In the Texas region,
the surface topography of the plain is
characterized by relatively flat topography
that dips slightly towards the Gulf of
Mexico. Geologically, the project area lies
atop the Beaumont Formation, a surface
outcrop that extends from just east of the
Mississippi River in Louisiana, to
Kingsville, Texas (Bureau of Economic
Geology 1982).
The formation was
deposited during a series of glacial and
interglacial events during the Middle to Late
Pleistocene. Extensive riverine downcutting
and erosion of the formation occurred during
the periods of lower sea levels associated
with the Wisconsin glaciation. During the
Holocene, after sea levels rose once more,
the resulting river valleys filled with alluvial
soils, creating broad, level floodplains.

The modern climate of the Harris
County study area is moderated by winds
from the Gulf of Mexico, resulting in mild
winters and relatively cool summer nights
(Wheeler
1976:2,
66).
Summer
temperatures average 92Â°F (33Â°C), while
winter temperatures average 64Â°F (18Â°C).
Annual precipitation averages 46 inches
(117 cm).
Hydrology
The project area is located on a
section of White Oak Bayou, approximately
1.5 miles upstream from its confluence with
Buffalo Bayou. The surrounding area is
heavily urbanized with both commercial and
industrial development, and significant
portions of White Oak Bayou have been
straightened and channelized.
Flora and Fauna
The county lies within the
Austroriparian biotic province (Blair
1950:98-101). Not determined by a marked
physiographic break, the western boundary
of this province is loosely identified by the
distribution of pine and hardwood forests on
the eastern Gulf coastal plain. San Jacinto
County is situated within the pine-oak
subdivision of the Austroriparian province
(Tharp 1939).
Blair (1950) lists the
dominant floral species of the pine-oak
forest subdivision as loblolly pine (Pinus
taeda), yellow pine (Pinus echinata), red oak
(Quercus rubra), post oak (Quercus
stellata), and blackjack oak (Quercus
marilandica). Hardwood forests are found
on lowlands within the Austroriparian and
are characterized by such trees as sweetgum
(Liquidambar
styraciflua),
magnolia
(Magnolia grandiflora), tupelo (Nyssa
sylvatica), water oak (Quercus nigra), and
other species of oaks, elms, and ashes, as
well as the highly diagnostic Spanish moss
(Tillandisia usneiodes) and palmetto (Sabal
glabra).

The property is depicted on sheet 92
of the Soil Survey of Harris County, Texas
(Wheeler 1976).
The single soil type
identified in the project area is VamontUrban land complex (Vn). Urban lands soils
consist of sediments that have been
impacted by urban development, and have
often been altered or covered by buildings
and other structures (e.g., dwellings, office
buildings, streets, parking lots, etc.).
Vamont soils have a high clay content, and
are described as somewhat poorly drained
with slow surface runoff (Wheeler et al.
1976:22). Vamont soils are identified as
upland clayey ancient (pre-Holocene)
alluvium, with a low potential for containing
deeply buried prehistoric deposits, and the
area is classified as Map Unit 4: No Survey
Recommended (Abbott 2001). However,
due to proximity of the project area to early
historic occupations of the Houston area, it
was determined that intensive survey be
conducted to prospect for the presence of
historic cultural resources.

at various times in the past (Gadus and
Howard 1990:15). Common land turtles
include eastern box turtle (Terrapene
carolina) and Terrapene ornata, while
snapping turtle (Chelydra serpentinia), mud
turtle (Kinosteron spp.), river cooter
(Chrysemys concinna) and diamondback
terrapin (Malaclemys terrapin) comprise
common water turtles. Common lizards
include Anolis carolinensis, Sceloporus
undulatus, Leiolopisma laterale, Eumeces
laticeps, Cnemidophorus sexlineatus and
Ophiosaurus ventralis.
Snakes and
amphibians are also present in considerable
numbers and diversity.

Blair (1950) and Gadus and Howard
(1990) identify the following mammals as
common within the Austroriparian province:
white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus),
muskrat (Ondatra zibethicus), raccoon
(Procyon lotor), coyote (Canis latrans),
opossum (Didelphis virginiana), Scalopus
aquaticus, Pipistrellus subflavus, Lasiurus
borealis,
Sciurus

Sciurus
carolinensis, Glaucomys volans, Geomys
breviceps,
Reithrodonomys
fulvescens,
Peromyscus leucopus, Oryzomys palustris,
cotton rat (Sigmodon hispidus), packrat
(Neotoma floridana), eastern cottontail
(Sylvilagus floridanus), and swamp rabbit
(Sylvilagus aquaticus). Bison (Bison bison)

CULTURAL BACKGROUND
The earliest period of occupation in
southeast Texas is identified as the
Paleoindian stage. Based on the earliest
securely dated appearance of populations in
the New World, this stage begins around
11,000-10,000 B.C., and lasts for
approximately 4000 years. During this time,
it is proposed that populations continued
with a highly nomadic hunting tradition
brought with them from the Old World.
Traditional models emphasize the heavy
reliance that these groups placed on the
hunting of the large mammals of the
Pleistocene. Plant foods and small game
undoubtedly supplanted this diet, and may
have played a more important role than
previously thought (Black and McGraw
1985; Patterson 1995).
Artifact types
associated with this phase include various
fluted and non-fluted lanceolate projectile
points, such as Clovis and Folsom. In
general, due to a paucity of well-stratified
older sites, the Paleoindian stage remains
poorly defined in southeast Texas.

Southeast Texas Culture History
The project area is located within
the southeast Texas archaeological region
(Patterson 1995; Story et al. 1990). The
culture history of the region extends back at
least 12,000 years into the past. A number
of researchers have compiled chronological
frameworks to describe the cultural histories
of the area (Aten 1983; Ensor 1991;
Patterson 1995; Shafer et al. 1975; Story et
al. 1990). The majority of these divide
human occupation into four broad stages,
Paleoindian, Archaic/Lithic, Ceramic/Late
Prehistoric, and Historic. The stages are
based on a proposed sequence of economic
strategies as they are revealed through the
archaeological and/or historical record.
These proposed shifts in dominant lifeways
consider
cultural,
economic,
and
technological factors in order to provide a
heuristic model useful for attempting to
understand ancient and early historic
populations. While the dates assigned to the
period interfaces are based on "absolute"
dating methods, they of course represent a
generalized time range for the implied
cultural evolution. The dates provided in the
following discussion will be drawn from
Ensor (1991) and are presented in Table 1.

By 8000 B.C., the Late Wisconsin
glaciation had ended, increasing climatic
aridity and creating extensive changes in the
environment. As a result, the majority of
Pleistocene megafauna became extinct. This
required drastic changes in the dominant

territory, the nomadic populations were able

available within their local environment.

subsistence strategies of the affected
populations. By 8000 B.C., the start of the
Early Archaic stage, the remaining southeast
Texas populations had adapted to the
environmental changes by shifting to a
lifeway dominated by seasonal scheduling.
This type of subsistence economy

1000-1300 has been used to suggest the
presence of extended trade networks or
migration during this time (Aten 1983). The
period has also been associated with the
introduction of the bow and arrow around
A.D. 600 (Aten 1983).

However, research has suggested
that human population densities remained
low in the area, and may have even
decreased significantly during this time
(Moore and Moore 1991). Eventually, the
stabilization of the climate by around 1000
B.C., the start of the Late Archaic, appears
to have led to increasing populations. This
rise in regional population may have been
further facilitated by the development of
long-distance
trade,
technological
innovations, and changing social relations
(Patterson 1995).

Historic Overview
European contact in the region
began in the early 16th century with the illfated NarvÃ¡ez expedition that, in 1528,
deposited Cabeza de Vaca onto the Texas
coastline, possibly on Galveston Island.
More long-term contacts resulting from
permanent European settlement did not
directly impact aboriginal lifeways in
southeast Texas until the early 18th century
(Patterson 1995).
However, European
diseases introduced by explorers and early
traders had begun to affect Native American
populations in Texas by the 16th century
(Ewers 1974). Throughout the eighteenth
and nineteenth centuries, epidemic diseases,
the mission system, and the fur trade
seriously reduced, and in some cases
exterminated, the indigenous populations
residing in the region.

The final prehistoric period in
southeast Texas is marked by the emergence
of ceramics. Ceramic artifacts appear in the
archaeological record of the Galveston Bay
area by approximately A.D. 100, and by
A.D 500, had been adopted by a number of
inland populations (Pertulla et al. 1995). A
plain, sand-tempered type of ceramic
identified as Goose Creek became prevalent
during the period, although a number of
decorated varieties and tempering materials
were also present (Patterson 1995; Pertulla
et al. 1995). The appearance of Caddoan

the city of Houston in particular. The
establishment of six railroad lines in the area
prior to the Civil War further stimulated
economic prosperity, and helped lure a
steady stream of settlers to the region. By
the second decade of the 20th century, the
growing gas and oil industry was competing
with agricultural interests, and helped create
a significant boom in population.

Anglo-American settlement in the
Harris County area began in the early 1820s,
with a number of Mexican land grants
awarded in 1824 (Henson 1996). The
modern boundaries of the county were
established as Harrisburg County by the
Texas Congress in 1836, and it was renamed
Harris County in 1839. The presence of the
highly navigable Buffalo Bayou stimulated
economic development of the county, and of

PREVIOUS ARCHEOLOGICAL INVESTIGATIONS
Prior
to

field
investigations,
Moore
Archeological
Consulting, Inc., performed a background
investigation of archeological and historical
literature relevant to the project area.
Literature examined for this project includes
site inventory records on file at TARL,
previous archeological investigative reports
on file at the Texas Historical Commission
(THC)
and
Moore
Archeological
Consulting, Inc. and other published
literature pertinent to the current project.
The archival background search determined
that no previously recorded archeological
sites are located in or near (within Â½ km) the
project property.

been undertaken along White Oak Bayou.
Wayne Neyland was the first to investigate
the White Oak Bayou drainage in 1955.
Neyland recorded site 41HR116, which,
according to his field notes on file at the
Texas Archeological Research Laboratory
(TARL), was eroding out of the bayou bank
over a distance of about six city blocks.
Surface collection and subsurface probing
yielded a possible hearth, one Gary point,
and nine Goose Creek Plain ceramic sherds
(Fields 1988).
In 1960 and 1961, William Caskey
collected artifacts from 37 prehistoric
localities. Nineteen of these localities can
be associated with eight archeological sites
recorded by TARL. All of Caskeyâs sites
consisted of surface exposures of artifacts
(Fields 1988).

There have been no previous
archeological investigations within the
project area. The nearest previous survey
was located approximately 1.3 km southwest
of the current project. The survey was
conducted
by
Moore
Archeological
Consulting in 1999 as part if the
Sesquicentennial Park project, and consisted
of the investigation of several city blocks.
The closest previously identified site is
located approximately 1.2 km southsoutheast of the project. The site, 41HR983,
is a 19th century historic cemetery associated
with the Jefferson Davis Hospital.

Professional archeologist William
Payne conducted a reconnaissance survey of
White Oak Bayou between Cole Creek and
West Road in 1973. He walked the banks of
the bayou and examined the surface in
search of archeological materials. Payne
recorded five of Caskeyâs sites and
recommended sites 41HR239 and 41HR240
for testing due to their archeological value.
Sites 41HR241, 4HR242, and 41HR 243
were not considered to have potential
research significance (Payne 1973).

While no formal investigations have
been conducted within the Project Area, a
number of cultural resources studies have

FIELD METHODS AND RESULTS
The fieldwork was conducted on
November 20, 2006, and consisted of a
100% pedestrian survey that included
systematic shovel testing and visual
examination for surface exposure of cultural
materials.

A total of 14 shovel tests (ST) were
excavated, each in 10 cm levels and
screened through Â¼â mesh (Figure 3;
Appendix 1). Each of the projectâs shovel
tests were recorded and plotted on the
project map. The tests identified the
presence of varying depths of fill and
disturbance related to previous construction
in all areas of the project area.
No
prehistoric or historic cultural materials or
features were found in any of the shovel
tests.

The project area is depicted on the
Settegast, Texas 7.5' USGS topographic
quadrangle map (Figure 1). The proposed
project consists of the replacement of an
extant four-lane concrete bridge on Houston
Avenue where it crosses White Oak Bayou.
The project was an intensive linear survey
during which all work occurred within the
existing TxDOT right-of-way (ROW). No
right of entry was required.

RECOMMENDATIONS

An intensive pedestrian field survey
of the project area was conducted, and
included both surface and subsurface
(shovel test) examination. A total of 14
shovel tests were excavated. The tests
documented significant layers of modern fill
and disturbance (e.g., Figure 4, Appendix 1).
No evidence of archeological or historic
remains or features was identified.
Consequently, no further archeological
investigations are recommended. In the
event that archeological deposits or features
should be encountered during construction,
work should cease in the immediate vicinity
and the Archeology Division of the Texas
Historical Commission contacted for further
consultation.

On November 20, 2006, Moore
Archeological Consulting, Inc., conducted a
cultural resource survey investigation of an
approximately one acre tract in Harris
County, Texas.
The objectives of the
investigation were to locate and identify
cultural materials, sites, or historic
properties within the proposed impact area,
and
to
prepare
management
recommendations regarding any identified
resources. The investigations (MAC PN 05134) were conducted for S & B
Infrastructure, Ltd., and the Texas
Department of Transportation (CSJ 027107-281), under Texas Antiquities Permit
Number 4324.
