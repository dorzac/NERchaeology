On May 3, 2016 a bone fragment was received by FACTS for human vs. nonhuman identification. Gross
morphology indicators were insufficient for identification, so permission was obtained to investigate
histomorphology indicators. There are several histomorphology indicators observable in nonhuman
bone only. These include plexiform bone and osteon banding. Plexiform bone is a type of fibrolamellar
bone with “a pattern of radial, longitudinal, and circular vascular canals (Dominguez 2011)”. Osteon
banding is defined by Mulhern and Ubelaker (2001) “as a distinct row of five or more primary and/or
secondary osteons” (221). Therefore, when conducting histological analysis, bone samples are observed
for the presence or absence of nonhuman histomorphology indicators. If these indicators are present, a
definitive classification of nonhuman bone can be made. If these indicators are absent, there can be no
definitive classification of human or nonhuman bone.

Figure 1. Plexiform bone

A histology section approximately two inches in length was cut from the bone for histological analysis.
The slides were prepared using standard histological protocols. The slide was observed for nonhuman

histomorphology. The slide exhibited nonhuman histomorphology in the form of plexiform bone (Figure
1). Overall, the presence of plexiform form bone supports a nonhuman classification.
I would be happy to discuss these results further if you wish. The bone fragment and slides will be
retained by FACTS until otherwise instructed.
