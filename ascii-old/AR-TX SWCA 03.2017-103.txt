Intensive Cultural Resources Survey of the University Lands Owned Portion of the Proposed Delaware Connector
Pipeline within Crane County, Texas

ABSTRACT
On behalf of Medallion Delaware Express, LLC. (Medallion) SWCA Environmental Consultants (SWCA)
conducted an intensive cultural resources survey of the 5.6-mile portion of the proposed Delaware
Connector Pipeline which crosses property owned by University Lands in Crane County, Texas. All work
was conducted in support of Medallion’s application requirements for a U.S. Army Corps of Engineers
(USACE) Section 404 permit (USACE File No. SWF-2014-00467) in accordance with 33 Code of Federal
Regulations (CFR) Part 325, Appendix C (Processing Department of Army Permits: Procedures for the
Protection of Historic Properties; Final Rule 1990; with current Interim Guidance Documents dated April
25, 2005, and January 31, 2007) and Section 106 of the National Historic Preservation Act (NHPA) (16
United States Code [USC] 470) and its implementing regulations (36 CFR 800).
All investigations were conducted in accordance with the standards and guidelines of the NHPA, the Texas
Historical Commission’s (THC) standards for such projects, and the Council of Texas Archeologists
Guidelines for Performance, Curation, and Reports. All portions of the proposed pipeline within lands
owned by political subdivisions of the State of Texas, in this case University Lands, were investigated in
compliance with the Antiquities Code of Texas under Texas Antiquities Code (TAC) Permit No. 7932.
The proposed Delaware Connector Pipeline falls under the jurisdiction of the USACE Albuquerque District.
This report addresses the 5.6-mile portion of the proposed right-of-way on University Land-owned parcels
within the USACE Albuquerque District, in Crane County, Texas. Background research indicated that a
0.48-mile segment of the line located near Crane Station had been previously surveyed for cultural
resources, with none being discovered. Therefore, the cultural resources survey focuses on the remaining
5.12-mile segment which had not been previously surveyed for cultural resources.
The investigations included an archaeological background review and an intensive pedestrian survey
augmented by shovel testing to systematically identify, record, delineate, and, if possible, determine the
significance of any cultural resources located within the proposed project area. Following agency approval,
the cultural survey included the entire 5.12-miles western segment of the proposed project route within the
USACE Albuquerque District which had not been previously surveyed for cultural resources.
As a result of the current survey, no new sites were recorded, no previously recorded sites were revisited,
and no isolated finds were identified.
SWCA completed an intensive cultural resources survey within University Lands in Crane County, Texas.
In compliance with the Antiquities Code of Texas, the results of the investigation under TAC Permit
Number 7932 are provided in this report. No cultural resources were identified during this survey; therefore,
no NRHP or State Antiquities Landmark (SAL) eligibility determinations are required.
In accordance with 33 CFR Part 325, Appendix C, Section 106 of the NHPA, and 36 CFR 800.4 (b)(1),
SWCA has made a reasonable and good faith effort to identify historic properties within the anticipated
permit review areas (PRAs). Based on the results of these investigations and the proposed avoidance
measures recommended, it is SWCA’s opinion that the proposed action would have NO EFFECT on
historic properties (per 36 CFR 800.5[b]) and recommends that the project be allowed to proceed.

Proposed Delaware Connector Pipeline within Crane County, Texas
SWCA Project Number. 42358
Project Description. The proposed Delaware Connector Pipeline described in this report consists of an
approximately 42-mile-long, 16-inch-diameter pipeline. The portion of the proposed right-of-way
investigated and discussed in this report consists of a 5.12-mile segment which crosses University Landsowned parcels and which has not been previously surveyed for cultural resources. This portion of the
proposed right-of-way originates at a Medallion Delaware Express, LLC (Medallion) owned facility, and
runs east-west for 5.12 miles, ending at a Medallion-owned facility approximately 8.5 miles west-northwest
of Crane, Texas.
Location. Crane County, Texas
Area Surveyed. 5.12 miles
Principal Investigator. J. Eric Gilliland, MA, RPA
Purpose of Work. All work was conducted in support of Medallion’s application requirements for a U.S.
Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) Section 404 permit (USACE File No. SWF-2014-00467) in accordance
with 33 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) Part 325, Appendix C (Processing Department of Army
Permits: Procedures for the Protection of Historic Properties; Final Rule 1990; with current Interim
Guidance Documents dated April 25, 2005, and January 31, 2007) and Section 106 of the National Historic
Preservation Act (NHPA) (16 United States Code [USC] 470) and its implementing regulations (36 CFR
800).
Number of Sites. None.
Curation. No artifacts were collected, thus nothing will be curated except project paperwork and
photographs, as per the requirements of the Antiquities Code of Texas.
Comments. Based on the negative results of the survey, it is the opinion of SWCA Environmental
Consultants (SWCA) that the proposed undertaking will have no effect on historic properties. SWCA
therefore recommends that no further archaeological investigations of the affected portions of the subject
properties. No artifacts were collected; project paperwork and photographs will be curated per the
requirements of the Antiquities Code of Texas.

CHAPTER 1. INTRODUCTION
On behalf of Medallion Delaware Express, LLC, (Medallion) SWCA Environmental Consultants (SWCA)
conducted an intensive cultural resources survey of the proposed 5.12-mile Delaware Connector Pipeline,
in Crane County, Texas. All work was conducted in support of Medallion’s application requirements for a
U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) Section 404 permit (USACE File No. SWF-2014-00467) in
accordance with 33 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) Part 325, Appendix C (Processing Department of
Army Permits: Procedures for the Protection of Historic Properties; Final Rule 1990; with current Interim
Guidance Documents dated April 25, 2005, and January 31, 2007) and Section 106 of the National Historic
Preservation Act (NHPA) (16 United States Code [USC] 470) and its implementing regulations (36 CFR
800).
All investigations were conducted in accordance with the standards and guidelines of the NHPA, the Texas
Historical Commission’s (THC) standards for such projects, and the Council of Texas Archeologists
Guidelines for Performance, Curation, and Reports. Additionally, the portions of the pipeline within lands
owned by political subdivisions of the State of Texas were investigated in compliance with the Antiquities
Code of Texas under Texas Antiquities Code (TAC) Permit No. 7932 (Appendix A).
The proposed Delaware Connector Pipeline falls under the jurisdiction of the USACE Albuquerque District.
This report addresses the entire 5.12 miles of the proposed pipeline, in Crane County, Texas.
The investigations included an archaeological background review, and an intensive pedestrian survey
augmented by shovel testing to systematically identify, record, delineate, and, if possible, determine the
significance of any cultural resources located within the proposed project area. Because the proposed
pipeline area falls within state-owned lands, the entire 5.12-mile area was surveyed, in compliance with the
TAC permit.
Eric Gilliland served as Principal Investigator. Nicholas Wood served as Project Archaeologist. Fieldwork
was completed between February and March of 2017, by Miles Martin and Nicholas Wood. Report
preparation was done by Nicholas Wood, under guidance of Eric Gilliland. Jayme Fontenot provided
geographic information systems (GIS) support from fieldwork through report production.

Project Description
The Delaware Connector Pipeline will consist of an approximately 42-mile-long, 16-inch-diameter pipeline
installed in an 80-foot-wide (24.4 meter) right-of-way. The portion of this proposed right-of-way which
crosses parcels owned by University Lands, and which is the subject of this report, consist of a 5.6-milelong segment in Crane County, Texas. This segment will originate at a Medallion owned facility, run eastwest, and terminate at another Medallion owned facility, approximately 8.5 miles west-northwest of Crane,
Texas (Figure 1).
The proposed pipeline will be installed at a minimum depth of 48 inches (121.9 centimeters) below the
ground surface. The pipeline will be installed through double ditching, in which the top one foot of soil is
removed and retained so that this topsoil can be replaced at the top of the backfilled trench. All construction
will take place within the 80-foot (24.4 meter) right-of-way.

Project Area
This report includes the survey results for the western 5.12 linear miles of the proposed pipeline. The eastern
portion of the proposed project area, consisting of a segment approximately 0.48 miles in length, was
deemed unnecessary to survey (See Figure 1), as it had been recently surveyed by SWCA (Project Number:
34929.03; Cultural Resources Report Number: 15-734) as part of a separate project effort. More
information on this previous survey is presented in the Results chapter below. As a result of this previous
survey effort, two archaeological sites (41CR43 and 41CR44), both historic scatters, were recorded. Due
to the poor condition of these sites, and the unremarkable character of the features and artifact assemblages,
it was deemed that there was little potential to provide additional information that may contribute to the
understanding of local and/or regional history. As such, sites 41CR43 and 41CR44 were recommended as
NOT ELIGIBLE for inclusion for the NRHP, and no further work was recommended. In June of 2016, the
State Historic Preservation Office (SHPO) determined that both sites were INELIGIBLE for inclusion in
the NRHP.
Based on the results of this investigation, SWCA recommended that the proposed project area would have
NO ADVERSE EFFECT to any significant resources within the project area, and further recommended
that the project be allowed to proceed.

CHAPTER 2. ENVIRONMENTAL SETTING
Crane County is situated at the southern end of the High Plains within the Shinnery Sands ecoregion (Griffin
and Omernik 2015). The area is commonly characterized as a flat sandy recharge zone subjected to wind
erosion and is comprised of sandy hills and dunes, stabilized by Harvard oak brush. The formation of the
area most likely attributed to the buildup of sands from Pecos River Basin blown against the western face
of the Llano Estacado (Griffin and Omernik 2015).

Geology
Given the nature of the formation of the area, the underlying geological formation of the project area is
comprised of Holocene-age sand sheet deposits. These deposits consist of areas of large dunes from
windblown sands comprised of predominately sand intermixed with silt. Typical depths of the deposits are
undetermined and are characterized as having a shallow water table with soils that are moderate to very
high permeability and have a low to moderate water holding capacity (Barnes 1992).

Soils
Soil complexes encountered during the survey include Penwell-Jalmar, Upton-Regan, and WickettTriomas-Kinco-Jalmar. Each complex soil is described in detail in the table below (Natural Resources
Conservation Service [NRCS] 2017).

Table 1. Soils Encountered During the Survey for the Proposed Delaware Connector Pipeline
Soil Series

Description

Jalmar

The Jalmar series consists of very deep, well drained, moderately permeable soils. These soils formed
in sandy and loamy eolian deposits from the Blackwater Draw Formation of Pleistocene age. Jalmar
soils are on nearly level to moderately sloping plains and interdunes. Slope ranges from 0 to 8
percent. Mean annual precipitation is 406 mm (16 in), and mean annual temperature is 16 degrees
Celsius (ºC) (61 degrees Fahrenheit [ºF]).

Kinco

The Kinco series consists of very deep, well drained, moderately rapidly permeable soils formed in
calcareous loamy material of eolian or alluvial origin. These soils are on nearly level to very gently
sloping uplands. Slopes range from 0 to 3 percent.

Penwell

The Penwell series consists of very deep, excessively drained, and rapidly permeable soils that
formed in sandy eolian deposits of Holocene age. These soils are on very gently sloping to moderately
steep hills or dunes. Slope ranges from 1 to 20 percent. The mean annual precipitation is 406 mm (16
in) and the mean annual temperature is 16ºC (61ºF).

Triomas

The Triomas series consists of very deep, well drained, moderately permeable soils that formed in
sandy and loamy eolian deposits from the Blackwater Draw Formation of Pleistocene age. These soils
are on nearly level to gently sloping plains. The mean annual precipitation is 406 mm (16 in) and the
mean annual temperature is 16ºC (61ºF). Slopes range from 0 to 5 percent.

Wickett

The Wickett series consists of soils that are moderately deep to a petrocalcic horizon. They are well
drained soils that are moderately rapidly permeable above and below a very slowly permeable
petrocalcic horizon. These soils formed in sandy and loamy eolian materials over thick beds of calcium
carbonate. These soils are on nearly level to very gently sloping uplands. Slopes range from 0 to 3
percent.

CHAPTER 3. CULTURAL SETTING
The project area is located in the Permian Basin of the Southern High Plains (Llano Estacado) archeological
region, which lies immediately to the east of the Pecos River, a physiographic dividing line of the TransPecos and the Southern High plains archaeological regions (Perttula 2004; Turner and Hester 1999). Both
archaeological regions have been extensively researched and comprehensive chronological sequences have
been established for these regions (Turner and Hester 1999). According to research conducted at
archaeological sites in both regions, evidence of human occupation in the regions roughly spans 12,000
years before present (B.P.) (Miller and Kenmotsu 2004; Johnson and Holliday 2004). These 12,000 years
of occupation are typically divided into four main periods based on technological and cultural changes seen
throughout the archaeological record. These four main periods are the Paleoindian (12,000/11,500–
8500/8000 B.P.), the Archaic (8500/8000–2000 B.P .), the Late Prehistoric (2000/1500 B.P.–1650 A.D.), and
the Historic (A.D. 1650–1950s) (Miller and Kenmotsu 2004; Johnson and Holliday 2004). The following is
a general overview of trends seen during each period, followed by a discussion of what occurred in the
Southern High Plains and the Tran-Pecos regions.

Paleoindian Period
The Paleoindian Period was commonly characterized throughout Texas as being populated by nomadic biggame hunters who heavily relied on megafauna of the Pleistocene (e.g., mammoth, mastodon, bison, camel,
and horse) for subsistence (sensu Willey 1966). However, a more accurate description of this stage is
presented by Bousman et al. (1990:22), who state that “this period may have seen use by small, mobile
bands of nonspecialized hunters and gathers occasionally utilizing megafauna perhaps only as the
opportunity arose.” Thus, according to Bousman et al. (1990), Paleoindians used a wider variety of
resources than previously thought. Evidence of this broader resource subsistence is based on the works of
Johnson (1977), Collins (1998: 1505–1506), and Collins and Brown (2000). Johnson (1977) reviewed
reports on numerous Paleoindian sites that indicated a range of small and medium fauna were harvested in
addition to big game. Investigations at the Wilson-Leonard site (41WM235), the Gault site (41BL323), and
Lubbock Lake (41LU1) provide evidence of small- and medium-sized faunal remains (i.e., turtle, rabbit,
squirrel, snakes, gopher, and deer) associated with megafaunal remains (i.e., bison and mammoth) (Collins
1998:1505–1506). Clovis and Folsom points are the primary diagnostic artifacts associated with this period
(Turner and Hester 1999; Collins 1995).

Archaic Period
The Archaic period is characterized by a shift from big-game hunting subsistence strategies to a less mobile,
more generalized subsistence strategy. This change in subsistence strategies shows a greater exploitation
of local environments with the exploitation of plants and animals located in the immediate vicinity. Along
with the change in subsistence practices a change is also seen in lithic technology. Evidence of this is
apparent in the archaeological record where lanceolate-shaped points are replaced by dart points that are
stemmed and barbed, and in the creation of groundstone tools typically thought to indicate an increase in
the use of plant materials (Black 1989; Collins 2004). Although Archaic peoples were still nomadic in
nature, traveling became seasonal, utilizing food resources specific to certain localities.

Late Prehistoric Period
The Late Prehistoric is marked by the replacement of the atlatal with the bow and arrow and by the
production of small arrow points (Hester 1981:122). With this technological advancement an apparent
increase in warfare is reported (Black 1989; Story 1985). During this stage new technological adaptations
came about. As previously mentioned, Late Prehistoric peoples began to use the bow and arrow; however

Pipeline within Crane County, Texas

this is not the only technological innovation of this time period. Ceramics and agriculture became an
important technological advancement in the lifeways of the Late Prehistoric peoples.

The Southern High Plains Region in Relation to the Cultural Chronology
Although a complete chronological sequence is well represented in the Southern High Plains region, it is
limited to the northern half of the Southern High Plains. Representation of archaeological sites in the
southern half of the Southern High Plains is generally scarce, and knowledge of prehistoric lifeways in this
area is incomplete. This is in part due to a lack of resources within the area. This lack of resources kept
populations low, therefore keeping sites to a minimum. A review of archaeological sites found in the region
revealed that the majority of sites are open campsites consisting of scatters of lithic debris on the surface or
are shallowly buried and burned rock features. Although these types of sites are commonly found
throughout Texas, they are easily disturbed by erosion and modern intrusion (Turner and Hester 1999).
Although the southern half of the Southern Plains region is lacking in long-term occupation sites and
quarries, the region does contain an important site possibly dating to the Folsom period (12,610–12,170 cal
years B.P.). This particular site, unearthed at Scharbauer Ranch in 1953, is known as the Scharbauer or
Midland Site (41MD1). This site is one of the earliest sites known within this region. Investigation of the
site revealed a partial human female cranium, faunal remains from extinct megafauna, and projectile points
dating to the early Paleoindian period (Leffler 2015).
As the Southern High Plains moved into the Archaic Period, the southern half of the Southern High Plains
entered a long altithermal phase that lasted around 4000 years (7000–3000 B.P.). The altithermal was a
period with a warmer and drier climate that ultimately led to severe xeric conditions. According to
researchers, the altithermal phase resulted in the “decreased use, if not complete abandonment” of the region
(Johnson and Holliday 2004; Stafford 1981). Most sites recorded in the Southern Panhandle Plains region
date to the Middle Archaic through Late Prehistoric periods.

The Trans-Pecos Region in Relation to the Cultural Chronology
The Trans-Pecos region, much like the Southern High Plains contains well established chronological
sequence, however it encompasses a considerably more dynamic cultural environment than the southern
half of the Southern Plains around Midland/Odessa. The Trans-Pecos Region is characterized by its
numerous natural rock shelters that formed in limestone cliffs, abundant lithic material, and isolated microenvironments formed in mountain ranges or at springs. Limitations of accessibility between various
environments contributed to distinctive prehistoric site types (Turpin 1995). Prehistoric sites are often found
within natural rock shelters located in many of the limestone cliffs, which create ideal conditions for the
preservation of burned rock middens, organic materials, burials, and various types of rock art. Native
peoples utilized these rockshelters throughout all periods of prehistory and well into the historic period.
Paleoindian sites in the Trans-Pecos occur rather infrequently. However, those that are known are primarily
kill sites found in or near rock shelters where ancient peoples processed megafauna such as bison, camel,
and bear (Turpin 1995). Other evidence of the existence of Paleoindian inhabitants comes from Paleoindian
tools or points found in isolated occurrences or points found within multicomponent scatters (Seebach
2001).
During the Archaic, habitation sites within rock shelters became more prevalent, along with rock art. The
Late Archaic (4000–1500 B.P.) is the best known period of the three. This period is characterized by
expansion into all available ecological niches, and the use of specialized food processing earth ovens (Miller
and Kenmotsu 2004). In the Late Archaic the more common site types in the Trans-Pecos are massive
burned rock middens, used for large scale food processing. These middens are typically found exposed on
mesa tops overlooking the surrounding canyons and waterways.

During the Late Prehistoric, sites found in the Trans-Pecos region consisted of tipi rings, cairn burial sites,
rock shelter sites with pictographs and petroglyphs, and pit houses built on river and stream terraces. It was
during this time that the lifeways of the Late Prehistoric peoples changed, with the development of protoagriculture, use of the bow and arrow, and the manufacture of ceramics. Material culture associated with
this social organizational change includes Perdiz arrow points, flake drills, end and side scrapers, beveled
knife fragments, ground stone items, end-notched sinker stones, small bone and stone beads, tiny turquoise
beads, and a few Olivella shell beads.

Historic Context
The Historic Period in Texas can be divided into two sub-periods: the Protohistoric and Historic. The
Protohistoric (ca. A.D. 1528–1700) is ushered by the venture into south and southeast Texas by Spanish
explorer Cabeza de Vaca in 1528. Archaeological sites dated to this sub-period contain a mix of both
European (e.g., metal and glass arrow points, trade beads, and wheel-made or glazed ceramics) and
traditional Native American artifacts (e.g. manufactured stone tools). The effect the Spanish presence in
Mexico had on Native Americans in Texas prior to about 1700 is not well understood. What is known is
that the initial arrival of Spanish missionaries and explorers spread disease that killed, displaced, and
fragmented a huge percentage of the population. As colonization spread from Mexico, many of the
Coahuiltecan groups moved northward to avoid the Spanish. At the same time, invading Indian groups from
the north put pressure on Native American groups in north Texas (Nickels et al. 1997). Historians believe
that these pressures led to intense territorial disputes, further destabilizing Native American populations.
The establishment of the first Spanish missions and the expansion of the Spanish Colonial Empire mark the
Historic period (ca. 1700–present). Most of our knowledge of this subperiod is through the written records
of early Spanish missionaries and by records kept by local land officials.
Spanish exploration, however, had little direct impact on Crane County. The area was too remote, and,
except for the area around the Pecos River, remained largely unexplored by Europeans until the end of the
nineteenth century. The first European settlers were ranchers who came in the late nineteenth and early
twentieth centuries, though lack of water and other resources hindered significant population growth. These
areas remained sparsely populated until oil was discovered in 1923. Crane County still relies on petroleum
and ranching as the primary industries today (Leffler 2017).

Crane County
The area that is now Crane County was within the territory of the Lipan Apaches, who were among the
originators of the plains culture common to Apaches, Comanches, Kiowas, and other Native Americans.
This part of the Pecos country may have been crossed by Spanish explorer Felipe de Rábago y Terán in
1761, and some of the early California-bound American travelers passed through Castle Gap and Horsehead
Crossing (Leffler 2017).
Crane County was formed in 1887 from land previously assigned to Tom Green County the same year, but
for many years the area's scant rainfall deterred settlement. In 1890 only fifteen people lived in Crane
County; as late as 1900 the United States census enumerated only fifty-one people and twelve ranches in
the county. Almost 17,650 cattle and 3,750 sheep were counted that year (Leffler 2017).
The county seems to have experienced a brief burst of settlement during the first years of the twentieth
century; Crane, the future county seat, became a post office in 1908, while census figures show that in 1910
there were seventy-one farms or ranches in the county, and that the population by that year had risen to 331.
Almost no crop production was reported for the county in 1910, however, and in any case most of the new
settlers had moved away by 1920, when only eight ranches, thirty-seven people, and about 4,700 cattle

were reported. As late as 1918 the county had no roads, although the Texas and Pacific Railway crossed
the northwest corner and the Panhandle and Santa Fe crossed the southern tip (Leffler 2017).
The area only began to develop after oil was discovered in the county in 1926, after which an oil boom
attracted thousands to the county. O. C. Kinnison opened a realty office and platted a town site for Crane,
where he named the streets for his daughters and sons. He also invited a preacher to hold services in the
area; according to county tradition, local gamblers resented the gesture and gave Kinnison a beating for it
(Leffler 2017).
Crane County was attached to Ector County for administrative purposes until 1927, but with (according to
one estimate) 6,000 oil boomers in the area by that time, the county was ready for organization. The town
of Crane, bustling with as many as 4,500 fortune-seekers, was designated as the county seat, and citizens
organized to build a courthouse. Water was a scarce commodity. People paid a dollar a barrel for water
brought from a well seven miles east of town, or, if prosperous, paid $2.25 a barrel for better water from
Alpine. Water was too precious then for any use but cooking or home-made whiskey; women sent their
laundry to El Paso. According to the census 2,221 people were living in Crane County in 1930 (Leffler
2017).
The county became one of the most productive oil counties in the state. In 1938, more than 5,494,600
barrels of oil were produced in the area. In 1944 more than 9,557,500 barrels were pumped, and in 1948
production was 16,851,698 barrels. Almost 27,377,800 barrels were produced in 1956, almost 30,731,500
in 1960, almost 34,092,000 in 1978, and about 26,866,000 in 1982. In 1990 the county produced almost
19,026,000 barrels of oil. By the beginning of 1991 almost 1,552,324,000 barrels of oil had been produced
in the county since 1926 (Leffler 2017).
Thanks almost exclusively to the oil industry Crane County's population rose to 2,841 in 1940, 3,956 in
1950, 4,699 in 1960, and 4,172 in 1970. In 1980, 4,600 people lived in the county, and in 2014 the area had
a population of 4,950. Highways in the county include U.S. Highway 385 and Farm Road 1053 (north to
south); U.S. Highway 67/385, which crosses the southeast corner; and State Highway 329, Farm Road 11,
and Farm Road 1223 (west to east). The town of Crane (population 3,756) is the county's only community
and its seat of government. In 2000 business establishments in the town included a foundry and a surfboard
manufacturer. Tourist attractions included historic pioneer trails and Horsehead Crossing on the Pecos
River (Leffler 2017).

CHAPTER 4. METHODS
Background Review
SWCA conducted a background review to identify previous cultural resources surveys, previously recorded
archaeological sites, or any other known cultural resources located within one mile of the proposed project
area. To conduct this review, an SWCA archaeologist reviewed the Texas Archeological Sites Atlas
(TASA), the National Register of Historic Places (NRHP) database, and historic topographic maps. These
sources provided information on the nature and location of previously conducted archaeological surveys,
previously recorded cultural resources, locations of NRHP-listed properties, sites designated as State
Antiquities Landmarks, Official Texas Historical Markers, Recorded Texas Historic Landmarks,
cemeteries, and local neighborhood surveys.

Archaeological Survey
The field survey consisted of one team of two SWCA archaeologists walking a single transect within an
80-foot-wide (approximately 24.4-meter) survey corridor. Subsurface explorations used during the survey
consisted of the excavation of shovel tests at 100-meter intervals along a single transect. SWCA keyed the
utilization of shovel tests to the level of disturbance of the proposed project area and the nature of the soils,
geology, and topography. Shovel tests were not excavated in areas where ground surface visibility was
greater than 30 percent. Investigators traversed the entire portion of the project area and examined the
ground surface for cultural materials. Other areas of exposed ground surface such as animal burrows and
erosional features were examined for the presence of cultural materials.
Shovel tests measured roughly 30 x 30 centimeters (cm) in size and were excavated in 20-cm arbitrary
levels to a depth of 1 m or to culturally sterile deposits, whichever came first. All excavated soil was
screened through ¼-inch mesh hardware cloth to retrieve any cultural materials that might be present. The
location of each shovel test was recorded using a Trimble GEO XT handheld global positioning system
(GPS) receiver. Data for each shovel test were recorded on appropriate field forms. Soils were described
utilizing standard terminology and colors were identified with a Munsell Soil Color Chart. Areas with
previously recorded or newly discovered cultural resources required additional shovel testing, per THC
standards, to explore the nature and extent of the cultural deposits. Photographs were also taken at each
location and were recorded on appropriate field forms.

CHAPTER 5. RESULTS
Background Review
On February 17, 2017, a SWCA archaeologist conducted a cultural resources background review for the
proposed Medallion Connector pipeline in Crane County, Texas. Review of the TASA revealed three
previously recorded archaeological sites, no historic districts or markers, and four previous cultural
resources surveys within one mile of the proposed project area.
Site 41CR12 was recorded in 1985 by Dr. L. Adrien Hannus of Augustana College. The site was recorded
as a prehistoric artifact scatter site. Artifacts include lithic debitage and a milling stone. All artifacts were
collected, with the exception of tertiary flakes. According to the information provided by the TASA, the
site is located “in an expanse of undulating dunes.” The NRHP eligibility status of archaeological site
41CR12 is UNDETERMINED. The site is located approximately 300 meters north of the proposed project
and will not be impacted by the proposed project.
Site 41CR43 was recorded in December of 2015 by Ashley Eyeington of SWCA. The site was recorded as
a historic trash dump, with artifacts including ferrous metal, glass, barrels, machine fragments, and large
grain cements blocks. The site is located within Mayfield Draw between Dump Ground Rd and Foundry
Rd approximately 2.65 miles north of Crane, Texas. The site is located at the western edge of the 0.48-mile
segment of the proposed right-of-way which was previously surveyed for cultural resources. According to
the TASA, the SHPO reviewed the site in June 2016, and determined that the site was INELIGIBLE for
inclusion in the NRHP. Therefore, no additional work is necessary at this location.
Site 41CR44 was recorded in December of 2015 by Ashley Eyeington of SWCA Environmental
Consultants. The site was recorded as a historic scatter, with artifacts including ferrous metal, barrels,
posts, glass, whiteware and porcelain, brick fragments, wood planks, and wire nails. The site is located in
an active oil and gas field 0.3 miles northwest of where Tarpley Road becomes Gold Course Road. This is
approximately 0.49 mile east-northeast of the eastern edge of the proposed right-of-way and will not be
impacted by the proposed project. According to the TASA, the SHPO reviewed the site in June 2016, and
determined that the site was INELIGIBLE for inclusion in the NRHP.
A portion of the proposed project area has already been surveyed (Atlas Number: 8500079927) by SWCA
in December of 2015 for the Medallion Pipeline Company. This survey resulted in the recordation of
archaeological sites 41CR43 and 41CR44, discussed above. No additional work is recommended regarding
these sites.
An archaeological survey (Atlas Number: 8500015545) was conducted to the east of the proposed project
area by TAS, Inc. in November of 2008. No other information on the survey is available.
An archaeological survey (Atlas Number: 8500000349) was conducted in 1998 to the west/southwest of
the proposed project area. No further information on this survey is available.
An archaeological survey (Atlas Number: 8500021211) was conducted to the north of the proposed project
area in August of 2012 by TAS, Inc. for URS, Inc. Jeff. P Turpin served as Principal Investigator, and the
project was sponsored by University Lands.
The 1954 and 1957 Pecos 1:24,000-scale topographic maps include several features within one mile of the
proposed project area. However, they are all related to oil and natural gas extraction, and are still visible on
current aerial and satellite imagery.

Pipeline within Crane County, Texas

GLO maps are not available for this section of Texas and therefore were not reviewed.
The proposed project area is considered to have a moderate potential for containing unrecorded prehistoric
archaeological sites, a low potential for containing unrecorded historic archaeological sites, and a low
potential for containing unrecorded architectural resources.

Archaeological Survey
Investigations of the land owned by University Lands involved an intensive pedestrian survey augmented
by shovel testing of the entire 5.12-mile portion of the proposed project line which had not been previously
surveyed for cultural resources. The investigators traversed the entire portion of the right-of-way examining
the ground surface for cultural materials. Area of exposed ground surface such as erosional areas, animal
burrows, and the like were examined.
The pedestrian survey was augmented by shovel testing. During the survey a total of 82 shovel test locations
were examined (Figure 2). Of those, 22 were not excavated due to disturbance (Figure 3), or were deemed
unnecessary due to ground surface visibility being greater than 30 percent (Figures 4, 5, and 6). These are
referred to as “no dig” locations.
The excavated shovel tests revealed varying soil profiles. Soils in the western portion of the survey area
consisted of strong brown sandy loams and dark yellowish brown sands, generally with no soil changes
evident. Soils in the eastern portion of the survey area consisted of light brown sandy loam overlying white
sandy loam. No cultural materials were observed within the survey corridor and no cultural materials were
recovered from any of the excavated shovel tests. Depths of shovel tests ranged from 30 cmbs to 100 cmbs
and were terminated due to bedrock, compact soil, or depth. A complete shovel test log is presented in
Appendix B.
Based on the negative results of the survey and previous disturbances within the proposed project area, it
is SWCA’s opinion that the proposed project will have no effect on historic properties. SWCA therefore
recommends that the proposed project be allowed to proceed with no further archaeological investigations
of the proposed project area. No artifacts were collected, therefore, project paperwork and photographs will
be curated as per the requirements of Texas Antiquities Code Permit 7932.

CHAPTER 6. SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS
On behalf of Medallion, SWCA conducted an intensive cultural resources survey of the 5.12-mile proposed
Delaware Connector Pipeline right-of-way located on lands owned by University Lands in Crane County,
Texas. As the undertaking will be located on University Lands property, investigations were conducted in
accordance with the requirements of the Antiquities Code of Texas under Texas Antiquities Permit 7932.
The background literature review revealed three previously recorded archaeological sites, no historic
districts or markers, and four previous cultural resources surveys located within one mile of the proposed
project area. Archaeological sites 41CR12 and 41CR44 are located well outside of the proposed project
area and thus will not be impacted by the proposed project. Archaeological site 41CR43 is located adjacent
to the proposed project area, but has been determined to be ineligible for inclusion in the NRHP, and no
additional investigations are recommended at the site.
Investigations of the proposed project area owned by University Lands involved an intensive pedestrian
survey augmented by shovel testing. During the survey, 82 shovel tests locations were inspected. Of these,
20 were not excavated because of good ground surface visibility or evident disturbance. Sixty shovel tests
were excavated, none of which contained cultural materials. Observation of the surface throughout the
survey area also failed to result in the location of cultural materials.
Based on the negative results of the survey and previous disturbances within the proposed project area, it
is SWCA’s opinion that the proposed project will have no effect on historic properties. SWCA therefore
recommends that the proposed project be allowed to proceed as planned, and that no further archaeological
investigations of the affected portions of the proposed project area are necessary. No artifacts were
collected; project paperwork and photographs will be curated as per the requirements of the Antiquities
Code of Texas.
