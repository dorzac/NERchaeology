The rapid

courses
taught
at the Pennsylvania
State College
by Paul D. Krynine
and J. C. Griffiths,
l9451950, together
with later modifications
of and additions
to this material
by the present
author
during
his own work on sediments
after
1950.
I would therefore
like to dedicate
this booklet
to those two inspiring
teachers:
Krynine,
without
peer as a sedimentary
petrographer,
mineralogist
and man of ideas (see JSP Dec. 1966); and Griffiths,
pioneer
in the application
of rigid statistical
techniques
to description
of the physical
properties
of sediments.
Historically,
Henry
Clifton
Sorby of Sheffield,
England
(1826-1908)
is the founder
of sedimentary
petrography
(and microscopic
petrography
in general).
His work was so
voluminous
and so excellent
that
it was not matched
until
well
into the twentieth
century,
fifty
years after
his publications.
Although
the microscope
had been used
earlier
to study slides of fossils and a few rocks, Sorby was the first geologist
to realize
their importance,
cut his first thin section
in 1849 (a cherty
limestone)
and published
on
it in 1851, the first paper in petrography.
Sorby demonstrated
his technique
to Zirkel
in
I86 I, and thus igneous
petrography
was born.
Sorby’s three monumental
papers were on
the origin
and temperature
of formation
of crystals
as shown
by their
inclusions,
etc.
(1858); on the structure
and origin
of limestones
and petrography
of fossil invertebrates
(1879); and on quartz
types, abrasion,
surface
features,
and petrography
of schists
and
slates
( 1880).
He made
20,000
paleocurrent
measurements
for a decade
before
his
publication
(1859).
He also has fundamental
publications
in structural
petrology
(18561,
studied
fluvial
hydraulics,
founded
the science
of metallography
in 1864, and devoted
the latter
part of his life to study of recent
sediments
and marine
biology.
A good
biography
is given
by Judd (I 908, Geol. Mag.), and Naturalist
(I 906) lists some 250 of
Sorby’s papers;
a short review
of Sorby’s career
is given
in J. Geol. Educ.
1965.
Even
today his papers
deserve
detailed
study by every
petrographer.
Two volumes
of his
collected
works have been edited
by C.H. Summerson
(publ. by University
of Miami).

INTRODUCTION

TO SEDIMENTARY

ROCKS

Sedimentary
rocks cover some 80 percent
of the earth’s
crust.
All our knowledge
of stratigraphy,
and the bulk of our knowledge
of structural
geology
are based on
studies
of sedimentary
rocks.
An overwhelming
percentage
of the world’s
economic
mineral
deposits,
in monetary
value,
come from
sedimentary
rocks:
oil, natural
gas,
coal, salt, sulfur,
potash,
gypsum,
limestone,
phosphate,
uranium,
iron, manganese,
not
to mention
such prosaic
things
as construction
sand, building
stone, cement
rock,
or
ceramic
clays.
Studies
of the composition
and properties
of sedimentary
rocks are vital
in interpreting
stratigraphy:
it is the job of the sedimentary
petrologist
to determine
location,
lithology,
relief,
climate,
and tectonic
activity
of the source area; to deduce
the character
of the environment
of deposition;
to determine
the cause for changes
in
thickness
or Iithology;
and to correlate
beds precisely
by mineral
work.
Sedimentary
studies are also vital
in prospecting
for economic
mineral
reserves,
especially
as new
deposits
become
harder
to locate.
Study of sediments
is being pursued
intensely
by oil
companies,
phosphate,
uranium,
and iron mining
companies
in order
to locate
new
deposits
and explain
the origin
of those already
known.

are those substances

because
in general
they
have been later moved
as solids within
the basin; they have a higher

than simple

(Greek:

They
are produced

Size

Quantitative
measurement
of such grain
size parameters
as size and sorting
is
required
for precise
work.
To measure
grain
size, one must
first
choose
a scale.
Inasmuch
as nature
apparently
favors
ratio scales over arithmetic
scales, the grain size
scale, devised
by Udden,
is based on a constant
ratio of 2 between
successive
classes;
names for the class intervals
were modified
by Wentworth.
Krumbein
devised
the phi
(41) scale as a logarithmic
transformation
of the Wentworth
scale, and modern

nearly
always

in Q terms because

are much simplified.

It is
extremely
risky to postulate
anything
based on size analysis
from
one sample

unless that sample

section.
One thing that is an especially
common
error
is the idea that if a sediment
is
fine it must be far from
the source,
while
if it is coarse
it must be near to a source.
Many studies
of individual
environments
show sediments
getting
finer
away from
the
source but these changes
are so varied
that they can be deciphered
only by extensive
field and laboratory
work.
For example,
strong
rivers
may carry
large
pebbles
a
thousand
or so miles away from
their
source,
while
on the other
hand the finest
clays
and silts are found
in playa
lakes a matter
of a few
miles
from
encircling
rugged
mountains.
Grain size depends
largely
on the current
strength
of the local environment
(together
with size of available
particles),
not on distance.
Flood
plainlays
may lie
immediately
adjacent
to course fluvial
gravels,
both being the very same distance
from
their source.
One must work up a large number
of samples
before
anything
much can be

3

said about the significance
and only by collecting
data

of grain
on grain

size.
Still,
it is an important
size will we be able to learn

descriptive
the meaning

property,
of it.

Mean size is a function
of (I) the size range of available
materials
and (2) amount
of energy
imparted
to the sediment
which depends
on current
velocity
or turbulence
of
the transporting
medium.
If a coastline
is made up of out-crops
of soft, fine-grained
sands, then no matter
how powerful
the waves
are no sediments
coarser
than the fine
sands will ever be found
on the beach.
If a coastline
is made up of well-jointed,
hard
rocks which
occasionally
tumble
down during
rains,
then the beach sediment
will be
coarse
no matter
how gentle
the waves
of the water
body.
Once the limitations
of
source material
are understood,
though,
one can apply the rule that sediments
generally
become
finer
in the direction
of transport;
this is the case with most river sands, beach
sands, spits and bars.
This is largely
the result not of abrasion,
but of selective
sorting
whereby
the smaller
grains
outrun
the larger
and heavier
ones in a downcurrent
,direction.
Pettijohn
and students
have made excellent
use of maximum
pebble
size in
predicting
distance
of transport
quantitatively.
Sediments
usually
become
finer
with
decrease
in energy
of the transporting
medium;
thus, where
wave
action
is dominant
sediments
become
finer
in deeper
water
because
in deep water
the action
of waves on
the sea bottom
is slight,
whereas
this turbulence
is at a maximum
in shallow
waters
at
the breaker
zone.
Where
current
action
dominates,
particularly
in tidal
channels,
coarses sediments
occur in deeper
waters,
largely
because
of scour.
Research
is needed
to quantify
these changes
so that
the rate of grain-size
change
with depth
can be
correlated
with wave energy expenditure
or other environmental
factors.
Sorting
is another
measure
which
is poorly
understood.
It depends
on at least
three
major
factors:
(I) Size range
of the material
supplied
to the environment-obviously,
if waves
are attacking
a coastline
composed
of glacial
till with everything
from
clay to room-sized
boulders,
the beach
sediments
here will
not be very
well
sorted;
or if a turbulent
river
is running
through
outcrops
of a friable
well-sorted
Tertiary
sand then the river
bars will be well sorted.
(2) Type
of deposition--“bean
spreading”,
with
currents
working
over
thin sheets
of grains
continuously
(as in the
swash and backwash
of a beach) will give better
sorting
than the “city-dump”
deposition
in which
sediments
are dumped
down the front
of an advancing
series of crossbeds
and
then
rapidly
buried
by more
sediment.
(3) Current
characteristics--currents
of
relatively
constant
strength
whether
low or high, will give better
sorting
than currents
which
fluctuate
rapidly
from
almost
slack to violent.
Also very weak currents
do not
sort grains well, neither
do very strong
currents.
There
is an optimum
current
velocity
or degree
of turbulence
which
produced
best sorting.
For best sorting,
then, currents
must be of intermediate
strength
and also be of constant
strength.
(4) Time--rate
of
supply
of detritus
compared
with
efficiency
of the sorting
agent.
Beach
sediments
where
waves
are attacking
continually
caving
cliffs,
or are battling
great
loads of
detritus
brought
to the shore by vigorous
rivers,
will be generally
more poorly
sorted
than beaches on a flat, stable coast receiving
little
sediment
influx.
It is probable
that in every
environment,
sorting
is strongly
dependent
on grain
size.
This can be evaluated
by making
a scatter
plot of mean size versus
sorting
(standard
deviation).
In making
many of these plots, a master
trend
seems to stand
revealed:
the best sorted
sediments
are usually
those with mean sizes of about 2 to 3$1
(fine sand) (Griffiths;
Inman).
As one measures
coarser
sediments,
sorting
worsens
until
those sediments
with
a mean size of 0 to -IQ (I to 2 mm) show the poorest
sorting
values.
From here sorting
improves
again into the gravel
ranges (-3 to -5@), and some
gravels
are as well sorted as the best-sorted
sands (Folk and Ward).
Followed
from
fine
sand into finer
sediments,
the sorting
worsens
so that sediments
with a mean size of 6
to 8$ (fine
silts) have the poorest
sorting
values,
then sorting
gradually
improves
into

4

the pure clay range (IO@).
Thus the general
size vs. sorting
trend
is a distorted
sine
curve of two cycles.
Work so far indicates
that the apparent
reason
for this is that
Nature
produces
three
basic
populations
of detrital
grains
to rivers
and beaches
(Wentworth).
( I) A pebble population,
resulting
from massive
rocks that undergo
blocky
breakage
along
joint
or bedding
planes,
e.g. fresh
granite
or metaquartzite
outcrops,
limestone
or chert
beds, vein quartz
masses.
The initial
size of the pebbles
probably
depends
on spacing
of the joint
or bedding
planes.
(2) A sand-coarse
silt population,
representing
the stable
residual
products
liberated
from
weathering
of granular
rocks
like granite,
schist,
phyll ite, metaquartzite
or older
sandstones
whose
grains
were
derived
ultimately
from one of these sources.
The initial
size of the sand or silt grains
corresponds
roughly
to the original
size of the quartz
or feldspar
crystal
units in the
disintegrating
parent
rocks.
(3) A clay population,
representing
the reaction
products
of
chemical
decay of unstable
minerals
in soil, hence very fine grained.
Clays may also be
derived
from
erosion
of older shales or slates whose grain
size was fixed by the same
soil-forming
process
in their
ultimate
source
areas.
Under
this hypothesis,
a granite
undergoing
erosion
in a humid
climate
and with
moderate
relief
should
produce
(I)
pebbles
of granite
or vein quartz
from
vigorous
erosion
and plucking
of joint
blocks
along the stream
banks,
(2) sand-size
quartz
grains,
and (3) clay particles,
both as
products
formed
in the soils during
weathering.
Because
of the relative
scarcity
in nature
of granule-coarse
sand (0 to -2$)
particles,
and fine silt [6 .to 84 grains,
sediments
with --mean sizes in these ranges must
be a mixture

As a rule, it is difficult
to study surface
features
in ancient
sediments
because of
cementation.
An attempt
may be made by cleaning
the grains thoroughly
in warm HCI
to remove
carbonates
and iron stains.
They should
be studied
under highest

of
the binocular
microscope,
on a black surface
and under
strong

After
this, the
grain should be mounted
in water
and examined
with petrographic

(Krinsley),

Rounded

The “roundability”
of a particular
mineral
or rock fragment
depends
upon
its hardness
(softer
grains
rounding
faster),
and the cleavage
or toughness
(large
grains
with good cleavage
tend to fracture
rather
than round;
brittle
pebbles
like chert
also
tend to fracture
readily
whereas
quartz
pebbles
will round).
On the Colordado
River,
limestone
pebbles
attain
their maximum
roundness
in only a few miles of transport
and
thereafter
do not get any more
rounded.
Quartz
also becomes
well rounded
but at a
much slower
rate, equalling
the roundness
of limestone
after
about
150 miles;
chert
shows only a slight
increase
in roundness
in over 200 miles of transport.
Coarser
grains
round easier than finer
ones, because
they hit with greater
impact
and also tend to roll
along the surface
while
finer
ones may be carried
in suspension.
Aeolian
sands round
faster than aqueous
sands because
the grains have a greater
differential
density
in air,
therefore
hit harder;
also they are not cushioned
by a water
film.
In experiments
by
Kuenen, wind-blown
quartz
rounded
much more rapidly
than water-transported
grains.
Beach sands also round faster
than river
sands because
on a beach the grains are rolled
back and forth
repeatedly.
It is thought
that little
or no rounding
of sand grains
takes
place in rivers;
pebbles
get rounded
rapidly
in rivers,
however.
To get rounded

for two things:
(I) an abnormal

it means there

e.g. if coarse

and fine ones are round
it again
usually
means a multiple

To determine
how much rounding

look for the most angular

COLLECTION

AND

PREPARATION

OF SAMPLES

FOR

ANALYSIS

Sampling
There
are two methods
of sampling,
the channel
sample and the spot sample.
The
channel
sample
is useful
when you are trying
to get average
properties
over
a large
stratigraphic
interval.
For example,
if you are making
a channel
sample
of a sand
exposed in a 20-foot
cliff,
you can dig a trench
the full height
of the cliff
and take a
continuous
sample
all the way up, mix it up thoroughly
and analyze
the whole
thing
together,
or you can take small samples
every foot, mix them up thoroughly
and analyze
the mixture.
This method
is good for determining
economic
value,
for example
if you
would like to find out how much iron or how much clay mineral
is present
in the whole
cliff.
But it is absolutely
useless for determining
origin
or sedimentational
conditions,
since you are analyzing
a mixture
of many layers
deposited
under varying
conditions.
We will therefore
use spot sampling.
To take a spot sample,
one selects
a representative small area and takes a sample
of just one bed that appears
homogeneous--i.e.,
you
sample just one “sedimentation
unit.”
For example,
if an outcrop
consists
of two-inch
beds of coarse sand alternating
with one-inch
beds of fine sand, your spot sample
will
include
only one of these beds, trying
to get it pure without
any admixture
of the
alternate
bed.
The
smaller
your
sample
is, the
more
nearly
will
it represent
sedimentational
conditions;
for sands, 50-100
grams
is probably
adequate
(this
is a
volume
of 2 to 4 cubic
inches);
for gravels,
a larger
sample
is required
to get a
representative
amount
of pebbles,
thus usually
1000 grams or more is needed
(50 to 100
cubic inches);
for silts and clays, you may sample
as small as 20 to 50 grams.
Just
remember
to sample
only one layer
of sediment
if possible,
excluding
any coarser
or
finer layers that lie adjacent.
If you have the problem
of sampling
a sedimentary
body, be it a recent
sand bar or
a Cambrian
shale, first
decide
on the extent
of the unit to be sampled
(which
may be
either area, linear
distance
along an outcrop,
or stratigraphic
thickness)
and then on the
number of samples
you want to take.
Dividing
these two numbers
gives you the spacing
of the samples.
If you are going to take only a few samples,
it is a general
rule to take
representative
ones (i.e., sample
the most common
or typical
beds exposed).
If you are
going to take a large number
of samples,
the ideal way to approach
it is as follows:
(I)
after dividing
the extent
of the unit by the number
of samples,
set up an equispaced
grid of sampling
stations
through
the unit.
For example
if the cliff
is 20 feet high and
you want to take about
7 samples,
then
20/7 = 3 and you space your
main sample
locations
at 1.5, 4.5, 7.5, 10.5, 13.5, 16.5, 19.5 feet and sample
the material
at those
precise points. By doing this according
to a rigid grid spacing,
you are pretty
sure to get
representative
samples
of the typical
rock.
In addition
to the samples
spaced on the
grid, you should take extra samples
of different
or peculiar
layers that may have been
missed on the grid; in the example
above,
if a conglomerate
layer had occurred
at I2
feet you would take an extra sample
of that even if you did not land on the grid, and
These extra
samples
should be especially

labeled inasmuch
as they are somewhat
unique
and not representative
of the outcrop.
The whole
purpose
of the grid
sampling
method
is to avoid
the error
of nonrepresentative
samples;
if one were to sample
a batholith,
for example,
one would
not

40 samples

Preparation

of Samples

for

Grain-Size

Analysis

The purpose
of grain
size analysis
is to obtain
the grain
size of the elastic
particles
as they were deposited.
This is often
difficult
because
(I) elastic
sandgrains
may
acquire
overgrowths,
or be cemented
into
tough
aggregates
to form
hard
sandstones;
(2) chemically-precipitated
materials
may be introduced
into
the rock
which,
if not removed,
give erroneous
size values
because
we are trying
to measure
size
of the elastic
particles,
not size of the cementing
material;
and (3) clay minerals
because
of their flaky character
and surface
electrical
charges
tend to cluster
in lumps.
The idea of disaggregation
and dispersion
is to separate
all of the individual
grains
without
smashing
any of them,
and to remove
all chemically-precipitated
substances.
To avoid smashing
grains
as much as possible,
one should
start with gentle
treatments
and gradually
work up to the more severe
treatments
only if the gentle
ones fail.

Grain-size
analysis
of fine-grained
materials
is not very satisfactory
and there
are a great
many unsolved
problems.
In the first
place we are
trying
to measure
the size of the individual
particles,
and to separate
clay
lumps into individual
grains is very difficult.
As you may see, the grain-size
distribution
we obtain
on analysis
may not really
be a measure
of the true
size of the particles,
but only tells
how efficient
our disaggregation
has
been.
In general,
one can rely on these analyses
as giving
a fairly
true
picture
of the size-distribution
down to diameters
of 6 or 7 4 t.016 to .008
mm) but for sizes finer than this the analyses
are often
invalid.

size the analysis

(usually

This leaves
the
surrounding
solution
swarming
with unsatisfied
negative
ions (OH-,
etc.) in
the vicinity
of the clay flakes.
Thus when a clay flake with its surrounding
“fog”
of negative
ions approaches
another
clay flake,
also with a negative
fog of ions around
it, the two flakes
repel each other.
This is the state we
try to maintain,
because
if the flakes
repel
each other
then they will not
aggregate
into clumps,
and we can then make a grain-size
analysis
on the
individual
grains.
If however
we add a strong
electrolyte
like HC I or NaC I
to the solution,
then the solution
becomes
a conductor
and the negative
swarm
of ions leaves the clay crystal,
and left unprotected
the clay flakes
attract

and flocculate
into chains and large clumps.
Grain-size
analysis
is thereby
made impossible.
Therefore
we must always
use distilled
water,
never
tap water,
in these
analyses,
because
tap water
always
contains
small amounts
of ions which
cause flocculation.
The best way to
insure
a good
analysis
is to add a small
amount
of certain
dispersing
chemicals
(called
peptisers)
which
prevent
flocculation.
These
chemicals
either
build up the charges
on the clay particles
so that they repel
each
other
more
strongly,
or else “plate’
the particles
with
a protective
and
repulsive
coating.
The quantity
of peptiser
or dispersant
used must be
pretty
exact
because
too little
peptser
can result
in flocculation,
and too
much may also cause flocculation.
To a large extent
the grain size obtained
by analysis
depends
on the type of dispersant,
efficiency
of stirring,
etc.
Some disperants
are the following:
(I) a few drops of cont.

hexametaphosphate.
The latter
(Calgon)
is best for most purposes.
In all your operations
using dispersants,
keep the water
you are using to
mash or wash or suspend
the particles
in, always
at the exact concentration
of dispersant.
This can be done by using a solution
of the proper
strength
in
your
wash
bottle
and never
using
any water
unless
it has the
right
concentration
of dispersant
in it. You must always
know exactly
how much
dispersant
is in the water
because
it is an important
factor
in computation
of the results.
Keep in mind that you should always
try several
dispersants
and use the one that works best; one of them may work on one sediment,
and
fail completely
on another
one. This is just a matter
of trial and error.

of the total sample.
But this is not true, since the total sample
weight
we determined
was that of the sample
plus a large
amount
of water.
A
second
method
would
be to wet-sieve
the sample
and weigh
the amount
of sand;
then evaporate
the muddy water
passed through
the screen
to dryness,
and weigh
that.
This would be satisfactory
were it not that further
size analysis
of the fine
fraction
is made impossible
by over-drying.
You can never
analyze
the fines once
they have been baked.
There
are three
ways to solve
this dilemma,

of sand weighed.
The
mud
fraction,
after
dispersion,
is placed
in a cylinder
and diluted
up to exactly
I liter,
and stirred
thoroughly.
Twenty
seconds after
stirring,
a pipette
is inserted
to 20cm depth and
exactly
20 ml. of suspension
withdrawn
and put in a beaker.
The suspension
is
evaporated,
and the dried
mud is weighed.
The weight
of mud multiplied
by 50
gives the weight
of mud in the total sample
(since you have withdrawn
exactly
l/50 of the muddy water
in the cylinder).
This assumes (I) that there has been no
loss of fines in the various
operations,
(2) that
during
stirring
all the particles
have
been perfectly
uniformly
suspended
throughout
the column
of water,
and
that exactly
l/50 of a liter has been withdrawn,
and (3) that there
is negligible
error
in the weighing
operation,
especially
in regard
to absorption
of moisture
during
weighing.
Despite
its drawbacks,
this
is probably
the most
accurate
method
and the one we will use. Results
obtained
by this method
may be checked
by using either
of the two methods
below.

Methods
2 and 3 split the sample
into two portions
with the mud-sand
ratio
being determined
on one portion,
and the analysis
of the individual
fractions
being
performed
on the other
portion.
Both of these assume that both sub-samples
have
exactly
equal proportion
of constituents.
This can be approached
by very careful
mi xi ng.
In Method
2 (wet-sieve
replicate
method)
the sediment
sample
is spread
out and thoroughly
mixed.
Then by repeated
quartering
or simly scooping
portions
from
every
part
of the pile,
one divides
it into
two subsamples.
The first
subsample
is then wet-sieved,
and the amount
of sand weighed;
the mud passing
through
is evaporated
to dryness,
allowed
to come
to equilibrium
with
room
temperature
and moisture
content,
and weighed.
The percentage
of sand versus
mud is then computed
for the first
subsample
and assumed
to hold true for the
second subsample.
The second subsample
is also wet-sieved,
and the amount
of
sand weighed.
Knowing
the percentage
of sand (from
the first subsample),
and the
weight
of sand in the second subsample,
it is then possible
to compute
what the
weight
of mud in the second
subsample
should
be.
Then the mud in the second
subsample
can be dispersed
and pipetted
to obtain
its size-distribution,
because
it
has not been oven-dried.

contains
over 40% mud, Method

Another
way
to get rid of small
quantities
of mud from
the
sediment
sample
is by decantation.
Decantation
is not recommended
if the sediment
contains
more than 20-30%
mud.
Essentially,
the sediment
is stirred
with water
in a
beaker,
and after
allowing
a certain
time
for the coarser
particles
to settle
to the
bottom,
the finer
material
remaining
in suspension
is siphoned
off.
This process
is
repeated
until the water
is clear.
The advantage
of this method
is that it is somewhat
easier
than wet-sieving
where
only small quantities
of mud are involved;
also it can be
used when no wet-sieve
is available.
The disadvantages
are the tremendous
volumes
of
water
required
and the necessity
to evaporate
all this water
to dryness.

Decide
what size material
is to be decanted.
If decantation
is done in connection
with sieving,
then either
44 or 4.54 (62.5 or 44 microns)
is chosen.
Determine
the
settling
time of particles
of this size and density
at the given
temperature
by
means of Stokes’
Law.
For particles
of 4.54 diameter
(44 microns),
the settling
velocity
at 20°C is 0.174 cm/set.

2.

Set a 1000 ml beaker
or cylinder
on a small stand about 6” above the table.
Fill it
about one-third
of the way with distilled
water.
Introduce
the sample
into the
cylinder
and stir vigorously,
distributing
all the sediment
evenly
throughout
the
column.
Now, when the time comes for siphoning,
you are to insert
the sucking
end of the siphon to a distance
about
one inch above
the layer of sediment
that
has settled
to the bottom
of the cylinder.
Measure
the distance
from
the top of
the water
to the point
where
the siphon
will be.
Let us say that this is 50 cm.
Then,
particles
of 4.5@ diameter
will take 50/0.174
seconds,
or 287 seconds,
to
settle
that distance.
In practice
this means
that at the end of 287 seconds
all
particles
coarser
than 4.5$ will have settled
to the bottom
and that only particles
finer
than this size remain
suspended.
After
computing
the desired
time,
stir
vigorously
and start
timing
the moment
stirring
stops.
Fifteen
seconds
before
withdrawal
time,
insert
the siphon
into the bottom
of the cylinder,
keeping
the
siphon
I” above
the deposited
sludge on the bottom.
At the proper
time,
start
siphoning
the material
off into an extra
1000 ml beaker.
DO NOT SUCK ANY
SEDIMENT
OFF THE BOTTOM
OF THE CYLINDER.
Now, place the beaker
in the oven and start evaporating
it (this assumes
that you
are not going
to analyze
the size-distribution
of the fines themselves,
but only
weigh
them-remember
never
to oven dry the fines if you ever expect
to obtain
their grain size).
Fill the cylinder
with water,
stir again, wait the same length
of
time,
and siphon off another
liter
of muddy water
into another
beaker.
Repeat
this process until the water
in the cylinder
stands clear (you see this takes a great
deal of water,
and you cannot
use this method
for obtaining
fines
for pipetting
because
you end up with some 3 to 5 liters of water,
and you can only have
I liter
for pipetting).
Evaporate
all the beakers
to dryness,
and add their
weights
(subtracting
weight
of any dispersant
you may have used).
The sand in the bottom
of
cylinder
is also dried and weighed.
Then the sand is sieved,
and THE AMOUNT
MATERIAL
THAT
PASSES THE FINEST
SCREEN
(say 4.5@) -MUST BE ADDED
THE WEIGHT
OF THE MUD IN THE EVAPORATED
BEAKERS.

Size Nomenclature

The basis of the classification
is a triangular
diagram
on which
are plotted
the
proportions
of gravel
(material
coarser
than Zmm),
sand (material
between
0.0624 and
2mm),
and mud (defined
as all material
finer
than O.O625mm,
i.e., silt plus clay), as
shown in the triangular
diagram.
Depending
on the relative
proportions
of these three
constituents,
fifteen
major
textural
groups
are defined--for
example,
sandy conglomerate, slightly
conglomeratic
mudstone,
or sandstone.
This classification
is presented
in
detail by Folk (Jour.
Geol. 1954); and also Folk, Andrews
& Lewis (NwZd).
To place a specimen
in one of the fifteen
major
groups,
only two properties
need
to be determined:
(I) how much gravel
(material
coarser
than 2mm.)
it contains-boundaries
at 80, 30, 5 per cent, and a trace; and (2) the ratio of sand to mud (silt plus
clay) with boundaries
at 9: I, I : I, and I :9.
The proportion
of gravel
is in part a function
of the highest
current
velocity
at
the time of deposition,
together
with the maximum
grain
size of the detritus
that is
available;
hence even a minute
amount
of gravel
is highly
significant.
For this reason
the gravel
content
is given
major
emphasis,
and it is the first
thing
to determine
in
describing
the specimen.
This is best done on the outcrop
by naked-eye
examination,
perhaps
aided
by a percentage
comparison
chart;
thin sections
and hand specimens
commonly
give too small
a sample
to be representative
of the gravel
content.
Using
this scheme,
a specimen
containing
more than 80 per cent gravel
is termed
“conglomera te”; from
30 to 80 per cent gravel,
“sandy conglomerate”
or “muddy
conglomerate”;
from 5 to 30 per cent gravel,
“conglomeratic
sandstone”
or “conglomeratic
mudstone”;
from
a trace
(say 0.01 per cent)
up to 5 per cent gravel,
“slightly
conglomeratic
sandstone”
or “slightly
conglomeratic
mudstone”;
and a specimen
containing
no gravel
at all may range from sandstone
through
mudstone,
depending
on the sand:mud
ratio.
The proportion
of sand to mud is the next property
to be determined,
reflecting
the amount
of winnowing
at the site of deposition.
Four ranks are defined
on the basis
of the sand:mud
ratio;
in the nonconglomeratic
tier, these are sandstone
(ratio
of sand
to mud over 9: I), muddy
sandstone
(ratio
I: I to 9: I), sandy mudstone
(ratio
I :9 to I: I),
and finally,
mudstone
(ratio
under
l:9).
The ratio
lines remain
at the same value
throughout
the triangle:
e.g. sandy conglomerate
is also divided
from
muddy
sandy
This division
is fairly
easy to make with a
conglomerate

ratio of 9:l.
hand lens, unless a large amount
of coarse silt and very fine sand is present.
These two simple
determinations
are sufficient
to place a specimen
in one of the
fifteen
major textural
groups shown in Table
I. One might simply stop at this point and
say no more
about
the grain
size; yet a great
deal
of information
is gained
by
specifying,
whenever
practicable,
the median
diameter
of each of the fractions
present.
Thus
two
specimens
belonging
to the
conglomeratic
sandstone
group
have
quite
different
significance
if one is a bouldery
fine sandstone
and the other
is a pebbly very
coarse sandstone.
The detailed
breakdown
will be used in all our class work.
These
fine
subdivisions
are determined
by specifying
the median
diameter
of
each fraction
considered
independently
of any other fraction
that may be present.
For
some specimens
this is, of course,
not possible;
but in most it can be accomplished
sufficiently
well for field
purposes,
especially
if the material
is bimodal.
The size
terms
of Wentworth
(1922) are used for the various
classes.
Thus, if gravel
is present,
one determines
whether
the median
of the gravel
fraction
considered
alone falls in the
for example,
the major
group
of sandy
granule,
pebble,
cobble,
or boulder
class;

conglomerate
can be subdivided
into sandy granule
conglomerate,
sandy pebble
conglomerate,
sandy cobble
conglomerate,
adn sandy boulder
conglomerate.
For the sand
fraction,
the median
is also estimated
separately,
using the standard
Wentworth
grades
of very coarse sand, coarse sand, medium
sand, fine sand, and very fine sand.
This can
be done very easily by reference
to a comparison
set of sand grains of the several
sizes.
For muds a somewhat
different
procedure
is used, the name depending
on the
relative
proportion
of silt versus
clay.
This proportion
is usually
very
difficult
to
determine
with a hand lens, and the only really
satisfactory
way is to make a thinseciton
(preferable)
or a grain-size
analysis
by pipette
or hydrometer.
In many samples
it might
be best just to use the broad
term
“mud”
and not attempt
to split
it any
further.
But the mud fraction
of many sediments
is obviously
composed
dominantly
of
silt, while
the mud fraction
of others
is just as certainly
composed
largely
of clay;
therefore,
it is considered
worthwhile
to make an attempt,
if at all practicable,
to
estimate
this ratio.
A threefold
division
is suggested:
if the mud fraction
contains
more than 67 per cent silt (i.e., silt-to
clay ratio greater
than 2:l),he
material
should
be called
“silt”
or silty”;
if more than 67 per cent clay is present,
it should
be called
“clay”
or “clayey”
and for intermediate
mixtures,
the term “mud”
or “muddy”
(used in a
restricted
sense) is proposed.
Thus the major
group of muddy sandstone
may be divided
into clayey
fine sandstone,
silty very fine sandstone,
muddy coarse sandstone,
and so on,
since both the grain
size of the sand fraction
and the mud composition
are to be
specified.
The complete
series
of major
textural
groups
is presented
in the table.
Both
unconsolidated
and consolidated
equivalents
are given
for each group.
At the right
of
the group
name
is given
an example
of how the terms
are to be further
specified,
depending
on the median
grain
size of each fraction
present.
Sand, silty
sand, and
slightly
conglomeratic
sand may be further
described
by mentioning
the degree
of
sorting.
The major
textural
groups of “mudstone”
and “sandy mudstone”
should be modified
according
to their
structure,

closely
spaced

of whether
they are composed

the method

whether
it be by hand-lens,

A space is left for the
grain-size
name,
which,
of course,
is filled
in after
the description
has been made.
Next, the size characteristics
of the sediment
as a whole
and then of each of the three
size fractions
are reported.
For the entire
sediment,
the range between
the sixteenth
and eighty-fourth
percentiles
of the size distribution
should
be given,
as this gives a
much truer picture
of the nature
of the sediment
than simply
mentioning
the extreme
range.
Possible
discontinuities
in the distribution
(bimodality)
are very important
and
should be described
in detail.
Following
this information
appears
a discussion
of the
relation
of the three
textural
end-members
of one another,
including
the following
characteristics:
(I) homogeneity
(Does the rock have coarse and fine layers, or are the
size fractions
thoroughly
intermixed?);
(2) thickness
and type of bedding
(is it massive,
random,
or cyclic
parallel,
hummocky,
graded-bedded,
or cross-bedded?
Is the bedding
caused
by a physical
parting
or a change
in composition,
texture,
or color?);
(3)
Mention
is then made of the
orientation
of grains;
and, finally,
(4) particle

A very useful
way to summarize

studies
that involve
sampling
large
areas
(bays,
offshore
areas,
deltas,
etc.)
is to make
a map of the
geographic
distribution
of grain
size classes.
This can be done very easily
using the
grain
size triangle
nomenclature
for sand-silt-clay
mixtures.
One takes his sampling
points
and records
for each one the percent
of sand in the sediment.
This data is
contoured
using values
of IO%, 50%, and 90% sand as contour
lines (these
are the
boundary
lines of the four “sandiness”
classes of the grain
size triangle).
Next,
one
records
at each sampling
point the percent
silt in the mud fraction
(i.e. percent
silt
divided
by percent
silt plus clay).
These values are contoured
at the 33% and 67% lines.
The map is now covered
with two independent,
intersection
contour
systems,
and each
“cell”
bounded
by these contours
is a grain size class (e.g. the sector
bounded
by the 50

contours
and the 33 and 67% siltiness
contours
is termed
“muddy
sand”).

cause of poor results).
If there

Pipette

Analysis

by Silt

and Clay

There
are several
methods
of analysis
of silts and clays (finer
than 4@ or 62
microns
diameter)
in common
use.
The most common
method
is by pipette.
Hydrometer
and decantation
methods
are more
difficult
and less accurate,
and many
electronic
sediment-analysis
devices
are now available
(and expensive).
All are based
on the settling
velocity
of the particles,
usually
computed
on the bases of Stokes’ law:
in the pipette
method,
one sucks off a small
volume
of suspension,
evaporates
and
weighs
the residue
remaining
suspended
at the given
time;
in the hydrometer
method
one measures
the density
of the suspension,
which depends
on the grains
still suspended
after
a given
time,
dries and weighs
them.
Electronic
devices
measure
the density
of
the suspension.
No settling
method
is very apropos
for particles
finer than I I$ or l2$,
where Brownian

interferes
with settling.

It is unnecessary
to stir the
suspension
at any time after
the first stirring;
however
if you need to you can stir over
again and start timing
from
the new stirring;
for example
if you forget
to take the 2hour sample,
you can stir the cylinder

is not desirable
and should be avoided
if possible.
Years
of experience
have
shown
that
this is the best procedure
for
making
withdrawals:
fifteen
seconds
before
the time of withdrawal,
grasp the rubber

the pipette
with the left hand and convey
it to the mouth.
With the right hand, insert
the glass part of the pipette
to the proper
depth, and steady it by resting
the right hand
on the rim of the cylinder.
With your left hand grasp the pipette
at the place where
the
rubber
tube is attached
to the glass, so you will be able to get an exact volume
in the
pipette
by using your left index finger
to clamp the rubber
tube shut against
the end of
the glass tube.

The principle
behind
the computation
is this:
if the fine sediment
is uniformly
distributed
throughout
the entire
1000 ml. column
by stirring,
and we draw off exactly
20 ml. at stated
times,
then the amount
of mud in each withdrawal
is equal to l/50 of
the total amount
of mud remaining
suspended
in the column
at that given
time and at
that given
depth
(i.e., the amount
of mud finer
than the given
diameter;
all particles
coarser
than the given
diameter
will have settled
past the point of withdrawal).
The
first withdrawal
is made so quickly
after
stirring
(20 seconds)
and at such a depth that
particles
of all sizes are present
in suspension;
therefore
if we multiply
the weight
of
this first
withdrawal
by 50 (after
subtracting
dispersant
weight),
we will obtain
the
weight
of the entire
amount
of mud in the cylinder.
Then if we withdraw
a sample
at a
settling
time corresponding
to a diameter
of 64, and multiply
it by 50, then we know
that the product
represents
the number
of grams of mud still in suspension
at this new
time, therefore
the grams of mud finer
than 69. Similarly
we can compute
the number
of grams present
at any size, and obtain
the cumulative
percentages
as shown below:
First,
we wet-sieved
the sample.
Let the weight
of sand caught
on the 44 (62
micron)
screen
be called
S. Then,
50 times
the first
pipette
sample
(the 20-second
sample)
equals
the total
amount
of mud in the cylinder,
hence
the amount
of fines
passing through
the screen;
call this amount
F. The percentage
of sand in the sample
is
then
IOOS/(S+F).
Let us now denote
by “P” the quantity
obtained
by multiplying
each
later
pipette
sample
by 50; then to obtain
the cumulative
percentages
of the total
sample

from
the pipetting

The data obtained
from grain-size

may be plotted
in many different
ways.
For some purposes,
one method

other methods
are best.
Get
familiar
with
all methods,
so that you do not become
so blindly
used to using one
method
that you ignore other ways which may be more suitable
for a given problem.
All the methods
use grain size as the abscissa (horizontal
scale) and some measure
of percentage
frequency
as the ordinate
(vertical
scale).
Grain size analyses
may either
be plotted
directly
in millimeters,
using a logarithmic-base
paper;
or they may be
plotted
in phi units (o), in which case arithmeticbase
paper is used.
The latter
is much

This is the most commonly
used
method.
As the abscissa,
one may use either
millimeters
(in which
case he must use

or phi units (ordinary

arithmetic
paper).
The ordinate
is an
arithmetic
scale running
from
0 to 100%; grain
size is plotted
on the abscissa
with
coarser
particles
to the left (this is customary
in all size analysis
plots).
Cumulative
percentages
of the sediment
are plotted
on this graph;
for example,
if 32% of the
material
is coarser
than 24 (caught
on the 241 screen)
then 32 is plotted
as the ordinate
against
2.0 as abscissa.

The advantage
of this curve
is that all statistical
parameters
may be
read from
it exactly,
thus one can compare

quantitatively
as to median,
skewness,
etc.
The shape of the curve
is independent
of the sieves
used.
Its only
disadvantage
is that
it is difficult
for the untrained
eye to look at the curve
and
interpret
it at a glance;
it is not “pictorial”.
Also if the sieve

sketching
the curve

for studying

Now one measures
the slopes of tangents

at a diameter
of 2.83#,
lay a straight-edge
tangent
to the

at the point where
the 2.83@ line intersects
it. Measure
the slope of this tangent

Size

For evaluation
of sets of samples
it is probably
best to compare
the curves
directly
by eye as only in that way can the entire
character
of the sediment
curves
be
revealed.
But this is inconvenient
and furthermore
not very quantitative:
it is often
difficult
to decide
whether
curve
A represents
a better
sorted
or finer
sample
than
curve 3, or how great
the differences
are.
To solve this problem
one resorts
to various
statistical
measures
which describe
quantitatively
certain
features
of the curves;
these
values
can then be tabulated
and, it is hoped,
certain
combinations
of values
may be
indicative
of different
sedimentary
environments.
There
are two basic
methods
of obtaining
statistical
parameters.
The most
commonly
used method
involves
plotting
the cumulative
curve
of the sample
and
reading
the diameter
represented
by various
cumulative
percentages
(as, what
grain
size value
corresponds
to the 25% mark of the sediment--meaning
25% of the material
is coarser
than
that
diameter).
In this method,
much
more
accurate
results
are
obtained
if one plots the cumulative
curve
on probability
paper, because
of the superior
accuracy
of extrapolation
and interpolation.
The second method,
called
the method
of
moments,
is far more complicated
and probably
of no greater
value.
It is explained

Measures

of Average

Size

It is desirable
to have a measure
which
will say, “sample
A is so much coarser
than sample
6.”
This is not nearly
as easy as it looks, though,
because
there are many
different
measures
of average
size.
Using one measure,
sample
A might be “coarser”;
using another
measure,
sample
B might
be coarser.
There
is no consensus
yet as to
which is best.
Until then, become
familiar
with all of them.
Mode (MO) is the most frequently-occurring
particle
diameter.
It is the diameter
corresponding
to the steepest
point (point of inflection)
on the cumulative
curve
(only if
the curve
has an arithmetic
frequency
scale).
It corresponds
to the highest
point on the
frequency
curve.
Several
formulae
have been developed
for determination
of the mode,
but none of them are satisfactory.
The only way the mode can be determined
is by
successive
trials.
Using the graph
of the sample
plotted
on probability
paper,
one
selects a point where
the mode ought to be, and measures
the percentage
of the sample
that occurs
within
the diameter
range from
Y4$
coarser
than that point to Y4$ finer than
that point
(i.e., within
Y2@ interval
centered
on the presumed
modal
point).
Then he
moves over a small distance
(say 0.1 or 0.2$) to a new presumed
mode and measures
the
percentage
occurring
in the Y2$ interval
centered
on that new point.
This is done
repeatedly
until
the highest
value
is obtained
which
then corresponds
to the modal
diameter.
It is often
difficult
to fix the mode
more
accurately
than 0.1 or 0.2$.
Sediments
not uncommonly
have two or more modes,
located
by finding
other points
of
inflection
on the cumulative
curve
or other
peaks on the frequency
curve.
Advantages:
the mode is quite valuable
in sediment
genesis
and transport
studies,
especially
when
two or more sources
are contributing.
The modal diameter
often stays fairly
constant
in an area while the other,
more “synthetic”
measures
tend to vary more erratically.
It
deserves
more common
use.
The disadvantages
are its lack of common
usage, and in
the fact that it is difficult
to determine.
Also, it is independent
of the grain size of the
rest of the sediment,
therefore
is not a good measure
of overall
average
size.
Median
(Md).
Half of the particles
by weight
are coarser
than the median,
and
half are finer.
It is the diameter
corresponding
to the 50% mark on the cumulative
curve and may be expressed
either
in @ or mm.
(Md+ or Md,,).
The advantage
is that
it is by far the most commonly
used measure
and the easiest
to determine.
The
disadvantage
is that it is not affected
by the extremes
of the curve,
therefore
does not
reflect
the overall
size of sediments
(especially
skewed
ones) well.
For bimodal
sediments
it is almost
worthless.
Its use is not recommended.

of this measure
is that it measures
only the skewness

also, it is greatly
affected

Measures

of Kurtosis

or Peakedness

In the normal
probability
curve,
defined
by the Gaussian
formula,
the phi diameter
interval
between
the $5 and $95 points
should
be exactly
2.44 times
the phi diameter
interval
between
the $25 and ~$75 points.
If the sample
curve
plots as a straight
line on
probabi
Ii ty paper
(i.e., if it follows
the normal
curve),
this ratio
will be obeyed
and we
say it has normal
kurtosis
(1.00).
Departure
from
a straight
line will alter
this ratio,
and kurtosis
is the quantitative
measure
used to describe
this departure
from
normality.
It measures
the ratio
between
the sorting
in the “tails”
of the curve
and the sorting
in
the central
portion.
If the central
portion
is better
sorted
than the tails, the curve
is
said to be excessively
peaked
or leptokurtic;
if the tails are better
sorted
than the
central
portion,
the curve
is deficiently
or flat-peaked
and platykurtic.

lines.
For
example,
the median
is obtained
graphically
by merely
reading
the diameter
at the 50%
mark of the cumulative
curve,
and is --not at all affected
by the character
of the rest of
the curve;
but the mean,

by the
distribution
over

of the curve
(see sheet

Details
on the computations
involved
are given
in Krumbein
and Pettijohn,
and many computer
programs
are available
for calculation
of these values
very rapidly.
It is possible
to obtain
skewness

ourselves
to determination
of the mean and standard

one sets up the following

using the $I scale.
A midpoint
of each 0
class is selected
(usually
2.5, 3.541) but in some cases (as in Pan fraction)
a different
midpoint
must be selected.
In this “open-ended”
distribution,
where
there
is a lot of
material
in the pan fraction
of unknown
grain size, the method
of moments
is severely
handicapped
and probably
its use is not justified.

Instead

we can ask “what

The Graphic

B has a much coarser

the Graphic

B would

A FEW STATISTICAL

MEASURES

FOR USE IN SEDIMENTARY

PETROLOGY

Introduction.
A good knowledge
of statistics
is becoming
essential
for anyone who
wishes to work in any of the sciences, because the whole of scientific
work from laying
out the experiment
to interpretation
of data is based on statistics.
Trying
to use
numerical
data without
a knowledge
of statistics
is like trying
to drive without
a brake.
You never know where you will end up and the odds are you will end up in the wrong
place and get the wrong conclusion.
In sedimentary
petrography,
statistics
are used in laying
out the sampling
program;
in determining
the best experimental
technique
for analysis;
in collecting
the
analytical
data; and in drawing
correct
geological
conclusions,
such as: what is the
content
of feldspar
in X formation?
Within
what limits
am I certain
this value is
correct?
What is the spread of values to be expected?
Does X formation
have more
feldspar
than Y formation,
and how confident
am I of this?
Does its heavy mineral
content
differ
significantly
from that of formation
Y? What is the relation
between
grain size and zircon content,
expressed
mathematically?
This outline
is not intended
to make you an expert
in statistics.
It merely shows
examples
of the use of statistics
in petrography,
with the hope that it will stimulate
you
to take several courses or read up on your own.
It is super-simplified
and condensed,
therefore
omits a lot of material
that should really be covered.
For further
information
refer
to any standard
textbook,
especially
for geologists:
Miller
and Kahn,
1962;
Krumbein
and Graybill,
1965: Griffiths,
1967; Koch & Link, 1972; Davis, 1973.
The Normal
Probability
Curve.
In order to understand
some of the assumption
and
underlying
principles,
it is essential
to study
the statisticians’
most fundamental
concept,
that
of the normal
probability
curve.
This is the basis for study
of
experimental
data of all kinds.
As a first
step in the analysis
of data from any field
of science,
one usually
constructs
a frequency
distribution.
For example,
if one is studying
the batting
averages
of baseball
players,
he would select convenient
class intervals
to divide the
entire range of data into about IO to 20 classes and proceed
to find how many batters
had averages
between
.200 and .2 IO, how many between
.2 IO and .220, and so on; here
the class interval
would be .OlO. Or if an anthropologist
were studying
the lengths of
human thigh bones, he would first ascertain
the spread between
the largest and smallest
bone (say for example
12” to 3l”), and divide this into a convenient
number of classes.
Here a convenient
class interval
would be I”, and he would proceed to find how many
thighbones
were between
12” and I3”, how many between
13” and l4”, and so on. When
data of this type is plotted
up in the form of a histogram
or frequency
curve, it is
usually
found that most of the items are clustered
around the central
part of the
distribution
with a rapid “tailing
off” in the extremes.
For example,
far more baseball
players hit between
.260 and .280 than hit between
.320 and .340, or between
. I80 and
.200.
Even less hit between
. IO0 and .I 20, or between
.380 and .400.
A great many
types of data follow this distribution,
and the type of frequency
curve resulting
is called
the “probability
curve,”
or the “normal
curve,”
or often a “Gaussian
curve” after Gauss
who was a pioneer in the field.
The curve is defined as the kind of distribution
resulting
if one had 100 well-balanced
coins and tossed them all repeatedly
to count the number
of heads appearing.
Naturally,
the most frequent
occurrence
would be 50 heads and 50

49

tails; 40 heads or 60 heads would
be less likely,
and so on down to occurrences
of IO
heads and 90 tails,
which
would
be very few; a throw
of I head and 99 tails would
be
exceedingly
rare.
By tedious
computations,
one could
figure
the chances
of throwing
any combination
of heads
and tails,
and this
is the useful
feature
of the normal
probability
curve:
the probabilities
fall off at a definite,
predictable
rate which is fixed
by a mathematical
equation.
Furthermore,
the curve
is symmetrical
about the mean--a
throw
of 34 heads (50-16)
is exactly
as likely
as a throw
of 66 heads (50 + 16); and a
throw
of I8 heads is just as likely as 82 heads.
Many
types
of data
follow
closely
this curve
which
is defined
by coin-tossing
experiments
and rigidly
fixed
by an equation.
Baseball
batting
averages;
weights
of
bolts turned
out by a factory;
life spans of electric
light bulbs; mean daily temperatures
for any month
if records
are kept over
some
years;
heights
of people;
densities
of
granite
samples;
widths
of brachiopod
valves;
slope angles
of geomorphic
features
and
many
others
often
follow
this
normal
probability
curve,
providing
enough
data
is
collected.
For example
if one chose ten people
and weighed
them
his curve
would
be
rather
irregular;
by the time he weighed
1000 people
it would
be much smoother,
and if
he weighed
10,000 the distribution
would hew very closely
to the normal
curve.
Many
distributions
do not follow
the theoretical
normal
distribution,
however.
One of the most common
ways that a distribution
departs
from
normality
is in its lack
of symmetry.
The graph of a normal
distribution
is a perfectly
symmetrical
bell-shaped
curve,
with
equal frequencies
on both sides of the most common
value
(i.e. in the IOOcoin
toss,
25 heads
are just
as common
as 75 heads).
Many
kinds
of data
are
asymmetrical,
though.
Consider
the prices
of houses in an average
American
city.
The
most common
price
might
be somewhere
around
$10,000.
In this city there
might
be
many $25,000
homes;
in order
to have a symmetrical
frequency
distribution,
this would
demand
that there
be many homes that cost minus
$5000!
This curve,
then would
be
highly
asymmetrical
with
the lowest
value
being
perhaps
$3000,
the peak frequency
at
about $10,000,
and a long “tail”
in the high values
going out to perhaps
$100,000
or even
more.
The distribution
of the length
of time of long-distance
telephone
calls is also a
distribution
of this type, since most calls last between
two and three
minutes,
very few
are less than one minute
but there
are some long distance
calls lasting
as long as I5
minutes
or even
an hour.
The
frequency
distribution
of percentage
of insoluble
materials
in limestone
samples
is also a highly
asymmetrical
or skewed
distribution,
with most limestones
in one formation
having,
for example,
between
5 and IO percent
insoluble,
but some samples
having
as much
as 50 or 75% insoluble,
with
0% as the
obvious
minimum
percentage.
A further
way in which
distributions
depart
from
normality
is that they may have
two or more peak frequencies
(termed
modes).
If one took a large college
building
and
obtained
the frequency
distribution
of ages of all people
in the building
at a given time,
he would
find a curve
that had two peaks (bimodal)
instead
of one.
The highest
peak
would
be between
19 and 20 (the average
age of students
who would
make up most of
the population),
and another
peak might
occur
at around
40 (the average
age of the
professors),
with
a minimum
at perhaps
30 (too young for most professors,
and too old
for most students).
This distribution
would
be distinctly
non-normal;
technically,
it
would
be said to have deficient
kurtosis.
In geology
we would
obtain
a similarly
nonnormal,
bimodal
distribution
if we measured
the sizes of crystals
in a porphyritic
granite,
or if we measured
the percentage
of quartz
in a sand-shale
sequence
(sand beds
might

pure quartz,
while the shale beds might
have 20% or less).
In analyzing
frequency
distributions,
the most
common
measures
used are the
arithmetic
mean ( or average)
and the standard
deviation
( or degree
of scatter
about
the mean).
Skewness
and kurtosis
are also used for special
purposes
(see pages 45-46).

Arithmetic
Mean:
The most common and useful type of average
for ordinary
purposes is the arithmetic
mean, symbolized
X. To obtain this value, simply add up the
values and divide the result by the number (n) of values.
This is symbolized
as

There are a number of other averages (median, mode, geometric
mean, etc.) which are
useful in special cases-- especially
when the data is skewed, as when you are taking an
average
consisting
of a lot of small values and a few very large values, which would
tend to distort the simple arithmetic
mean.
Standard Deviation:
For most data we are interested
in determining
the spread or
scatter of the values.
For example,
a set of reading 4, 6, 7, 4, 5, 6, obviously
is less
scattered
than a set such as 2, 5, 14, I, 9, 3, al though both have the same mean. The
standard deviation
(s or a) is a precise measure of this scatter and, next to the mean, is
the most useful value in statistics.
It is the only measure of spread that has wide use.
The standard
deviation
is computed
such that, on an average,
68% of the samples will
fall within
plus or minus one standard
deviation
(+ a) from the mean; 95% will fall
within
plus or minus two standard
deviations
(22~);
and 99% of the samples will fall
within
+ 3a. For example,
if we have 100 porosity
values on a sandstone formation
and
the mean porosity
is 15.0% with a standard
deviation
of 3.0%, we know that
approximately
68 of these 100 samples will have porosities
ranging between
I2 and 18%
ti +a), that 95 samples will range between 9 and 21% (x +2a), and that 99 samples will
range between
6 and 24% (2 + 3a).
Of course this assumes that we have a sufficient
number of values, and that the values follow the normal bell-shaped
probability
curve
(in which most of the values cluster about the mean, and “tail off” symmetrically
to
each side). This is tacitly
assumed for most statistical
work.
A complete
table of the
percent of values included in a number of standard deviations
is given on page 61.
To obtain
the standard
deviation
there are
identical
answers.
In the long method, one finds the

of each value from this mean,

of this quotient.

If our samples
are representative
and the feldspar
content

curve,
then, if we collected
100 samples
of the same formation,
we
would
expect
68 of them to have feldspar
contents
between
6.6 and 13.4%.
If someone
asks you, “what
are the odds of finding
a sample
with
over
17% feldspar,
you can
immediately
answer
“only
2 or 3 out of 100.”
Why?
Well,
17% is about equal to x + 2s,
or 10.0 + 2t3.4);
we know
that 95% of the samples
will
fall
in the range
of X 2 2s,
therefore
only 5% of the samples
will fall outside
this range; of these, half will be higher
and half
lower,
so 2.5% of the samples
will have less than 3% feldspar,
and 2.5% will
have over
17%. Again,
this assumes a normal
distribution
symmetrical
about the mean.
Confidence
Limits
on a single
mean.
In the example
above,
we got a mean of 10.00
percent
feldspar
based on five samples
of the formation.
This is our estimate,
based on
five
samples,
of the feldspar
content
of the entire
formation.
Now the true feldspar
content
could
not be determined
unless we analyzed
every
one of the millions
of sand
grains
in the entire
formation.
This we cannot
do, so we have to estimate
the mean by
taking
a small number
of representative
samples.
But by the test to be described,
we
can tell
how close
our estimated
mean
is likely
to be to the true
mean
of the
formation--in
other words,
we can assign confidence
limits
to the mean.
We can say, “I
am 95% sure that the true formation
mean lies between
9.0 and I I.O%,“--which
means
we will be wrong
only 5% of the time--or
one time in twenty.
We realize
immediately
that if we take 100 samples
we will be more confident
of
our mean,
than if we took only five samples.
Also, we will be more
confident
of the
mean if the values
show a small spread
(standard
deviation)
than if they show a large
spread
(Example:
if we have values
of 4.2, 3.6, 4.0, 4.8, 3.4 we are more confident
that
our mean is nearly
4.0 than if we have values
1.2, 4.8, 7.6, 3. I, 3.3).
The formula
for
computing
the
confidence
limits
appropriately
then
takes
these
two
factors
into
account.

n is the number

deviation,
and t is explained

or values,

s is the standard

The factor
t is put into the equation
so that
we can choose
our “confidence
level.”
Assume
a formation
with a mean porosity
of 12.0%,
standard
deviation
3.0%.
If we
want to be only 50% sure of our mean, we look up in a table the value
of t at the 50%
level,
and insert
this in the formula.
Let us say this makes “L” come out to + 1.5. This
means that we would
be only 50% sure that our true formation
mean lay between
10.5
and 13.5%, and there
is one chance
in two that the true mean lies either
above or below
these
limits.
However,
if we chose the 95% level,
we insert
this value
of t in the
formula.
Say that L then comes out to 3.0%; then we would
be m
sure that the true
formation
mean
lay between
9.0 and 15.0%,
and there
would
be only one chance
in
twenty
of our being wrong.
Most statisticians
use the 95% level all the time.

The value
t is found
in a table with the levels
to be selected
(5%, IO%, 20%, etc.)
plotted
against
the “degrees
of freedom”
(which
in this case simply
means
the number
of values
minus
I); the value
of t to be used lies at the intersection
of our chosen
confidence
level and the degrees
of freedom.
For example,
with 21 values,
at the 5%

t = 2.09, as shown in t table on page 59.

Populations

it

and Probability

is essential

that

we

understand

the

two

concepts

of

Population
is the term
used for the data we are sampling;
if we are measuring
porosities,
the “population”
that
we are sampling
is the vast
number
of porosities
present
in every
cubic
inch of that formation,
of which
we test what we assume are a
representative
few;
if we are measuring
the mica content
of a bed, the “population”
is
the percent
of mica in each minute
part of that bed; if we fill a jar with 500 black and
1,000 red beans
and proceed
blindfolded
to pull out 50 beans,
then we hope that
our
sample
of 50 is representative
of the true “population”-i.e., the 1,500 total beans.
The
population
is the vast amount
of numerical
data available,
of which
we take only a
smal I sample.
In many statistical
tests,
we try to answer
the question,
“what
are the odds that we
could
have obtained
as great
a difference
or greater
by chance
sampling
of the same
population?”
This gives
us an insight
whether
or not there
is a real difference
in the
properties
of the two formations
we have sampled,
or whether
we could
have gotten
by chance
sampling
of a single
just
as large
a difference
in, say chert
content,
formation
(a “homogenous”
population).
Let’s think about
it this way.
We have a square
jar and a round
jar, each filled
with a certain
mixture
of 1,000 black and white
beans.
The round jar has a population
with
a certain
number
of blacks,
the square
jar has a
different
proportion
of blacks.
You are now blindfolded
and asked to pull 50 beans from
one of the jars; let’s say you got 30 blacks and 20 whites.
Now, still blindfolded,
you are
asked to reach again into a jar (you still don’t know which one you are reaching
into) and
pick 50 more beans.
This time you get 22 blacks and 28 whites.
Statistics
enables
us to
anwer
the question,
“on the second
drawing,
did I take from
the same jar as I did the
first
time;
what
is the probability
that I drew both sets of beans from
the same jar?”
“what
are the odds that
I drew
both samples
of 50 from
the
Or phrased
differently,
This is essentially
what we do when we obtain

(i.e., the same jar?)”
numerical
data
from
rocks.
We take
only
a small
sample
of the numerical
data
available
in the formation,
then
sample
another
formation
and see if there
is any
difference
between
the two formations--and
difference
in the population
of beans in
the jar, so to speak.
Probability.
Many
statistical
tables
have
a critical
value
called
“P” as an
important
part.
P stands for probability--in
most cases, P, represented
as a percent,
stands
for the probability
of a certain
event
happening.
In the jar experiment
above,
after
running
through
the computations
of the statistical
test,
we enter
a table
and
come out with a certain
value
for P. In this case let us say P came out to be .I0 (10%).
This means
that
if we had repeatedly
sampled
the same jar, only once in every
ten
times would
we have gotten
as large, or larger,
a difference
as we did on the two draws.
Or, there
is only
one chance
in ten that
we have
sampled
the same
population.
Although
it is not technically
correct
to say it this way, we may state the corollary
that
there
is a 90% chance
that we have sampled
two different
jars.
Most statisticians
do
not accept
an experiment
as significant
unless P reaches
the 5% level (.05 on the table,
pages 59 and 60).

Comparison
of two means.
We have studied
the heavy mineral
suites of two formations.
We examine
50 samples
of the Abner
formation
and find that within
the heavy
minerals,
of the garnet
content
averages
15.0% with a standard
deviation
of 5%; and 30 samples
of the Benjamin
formation
show a garnet
content
of 10.0 with a standard
deviation
of
4.0%.
The question
arises,
does the Abner
really
have more garnet
than the Benjamin,
or could such differences
have arisen
by chance
sampling
of a homogeneous
population?
The so-called
“t test”
has been devised
to answer
this question
and is one of the most
useful
statistical
devices.
We substitute
our values
in the following
equation,
where
;;i: is
our mean
garnet
content,
and n equals
the number
of samples
(subscript
a refers
to
values
from
the Abner

, b to the Benjamin
formation).

equals
the average

To

in this case, we add up the number

data and subtract
2 from
the result
(in the example,
50 + 30-2 = 78 d.f.) Entering
the
table
with
78 degrees
of freedom,
we read across
the horizontal
row at this value
until
we encounter
the correct

saying
“our experiment
has shown
that there
are only 5 to IO chances
in 100 that the
garnet
content
of the two formations
is the same,”
or the reverse,
“there
is a 90 to 95%
chance
that the Abner
really
does contain
more garnet
than the Benjamin.”
Both these
statements
are technically
not exactly
precise,
but may be considered
as pretty
close to
the truth.
As stated
before,
statisticians
ordinarily
consider
that
in any experiment
that
fails
to reach
the 5% level,
the data do not warrant
making
a conclusion.
In other
words
if your P comes
out to the 10% level,
it means
that you have failed
to find a
really
significant
difference
between
the two formations,
either
because
the difference
in means
is too small,
or the standard
deviation
is too large,
or you took too few
samples.
The only way to remedy
this situation
is to take enough
samples
to push the
results

the 5% level.

To use the XL test we must
in some way arrive
at a predicted
or expected
frequency
or occurrence,
based on a prior
reasoning
or else on long experience.
We
then compare
our observed
frequency
with the given frequency.
For example,
if we roll
a dice 600 times,
we would
expect
that
if the dice is well
balanced
each number
(I
through
6) would
appear
equally
and our expected

would
therefore
be 100.
Y/hen we actually
do roll the dice, we may find that we got only 95 I’s, 123 2’s, 82 3’s,
etc.
The purpose
of the X2 test
is to compare
the observed
with
the expected
frequency
and see how likely it is that the deviations
are due to chance,
or whether
the

is loaded.
As another
example,
say that data collected
over a period

years shows that American
League
teams hit a grand total of 1,035 homers

on the average;
thus we would expect
them to hit about
1,035 homers
this season.

We start
out with the assumption
that both have the same heavy
mineral
content
and proceed
to compute
our expected
frequencies
on this basis.
To figure
the number
of green
tourmalines
expected
in a count
of 45 grains
of the Eli formation,
we decide
(from
looking
at the totals)
that 40/96 of the grains
should
be green;
thus we expect
45
times
40/96 green grains
in the Eli, or 18.7. Since there
were a total of 40 green grains
counted,
then we’d expect
40-18.7
or 21.3 green grains
to occur in the Nineteenten.
The expected
number
of browns
is 45 times
22/96 or 10.3 for Eli, and 22-10.3
or
I 1.7 for Nineteenten.
For “others”
we expect
45 times
34/96 or 15.9 for Eli, and 3415.9 or 18.1 for Nineteenten.
Now we set up the following
table,
subtracting
0.5 from
each of the differences,
giving
our corrected
differences
(the reason
we subtract
0.5
from
each difference
is a “correction
for continuity”
because
obviously
you cannot
count fractional
grains,
and IO grains
is as close as you can possibly
get to an expected
frequency
of 10.3 grains).

for details,

Techniques.
Any statistical
text will
list many other
valuable
tests and
Some of these, of more interest
to geologists,
are simply
mentioned
here;
go to the texts, e.g. Miller
and Kahn, Snedecor,
etc.

Much geologic
data can be presented
in the form of scatter
plots, wherein
we wish
to see how one property
is related
to another.
Examples
are plots of roundness
versus
distance;
mean
grain
size versus
sorting;
feldspar
percentage
versus
stratigraphic
position;
for a collection
of dinosaur
bones, length
of thigh bone versus thickness
of the
bones; zircon/tourmaline
ratio
versus
grain
size; percent
carbonate
mud versus
roundness of shell fragments,
etc.
To analyze
such associations,
two main procedures
are
applied:
(I) the perfection
of the association
is tested,
and (2) the equation
of the
relationship
is determined.
If the two properties
are very closely
related,
they give a long narrow
“train”
of
points
on a scatter
diagram.
If the two
properties
are not associated,
a random
“buckshot”
pattern
emerges.
The correlation
coefficient,
r, computes
the perfection
of
correlation.
For perfect
correlation
r = 1.00, which
means that,
knowing
one property,
we can predict
the other
property
exactly,
and that both increase
together.
An r of
- I .OO means perfect
negative
correlation,
a correlation
just as exact except
that as one
property
increases
the other
decreases.
If the two properties
are not correlated,
r may
be .OO; weak correlation
would
be +.25 or -.l5,
etc.
Coefficients
beyond
+.50 are
considered
“good”
for most geological
work.
The normal
correlation
coefficient
is valid
only for straightline
trends.
Other
methods
must be used for hyperbolic,
parabolic,
sinusoidal,
etc., trends.
If a small
number
of data points
are available,
it is possible
for “good-looking”
correlations
to arise purely
by chance.
Thus one should
always
refer
to tables
which
show
whether
the given
value
of r shows
a significant
correlation;
this depends
of
course on the number
of samples
and the value of r, thus is similar
in principle
to the t
test.
Squaring

property.

the correlation
coefficient,
r, gives the coefficient
of causation
much of the variation
in one property
is explained
by the variation

standard
texts.

A trend line may be fitted
to a scatter
diagram,
and an equation
may be fitted
to
this line so that,
given
a value
of one property,
the other
property
may be predicted.
Trend
lines
can be drawn
in by eye,
but
this
process
is usually
sneered
at; a
mathematical
way of doing it is the “least
squares”
method.
It is important
to realize

57

that, unless the two properties
are almost
perfectly
correlated,
two trends
lines can be
computed;
let’s say we have
a graph
of feldspar
content
versus
roundness,
with
a
correlation
coefficient
of +.45 (good,
but far from
perfect
correlation).
We can either
(I) compute
the line to predict
most
accurately
the roundness,
given
the feldspar
content;
or (2) a line to predict
most
accurately
the feldspar
contents
given
the
roundness.
The two
lines may easily
form
a cross
with
as much
as 30” or more
difference
in angle.
Again,
these work only for straight-line
trends;
non-linear
trends
require
more complicated
arithmetic.
To the
trend
line
is usually
attached
a “standard
error
of estimate”
band,
essentially
equal
to the standard
deviation.
This band runs parallel
to the computed
trend
and includes
two-thirds
of all the points
in the scatter
diagram.
Its purpose
is to
show the accuracy
of the relationship.
For example,
in a certain
brachiopod
the length
and width
of the shell are related
by the equation
L = 2W -I + 0.5.
The last figure
is
the standard
error of estimate;
if a given specimen
has a width
of 3.5 cm, the length
is
most likely
8 cm, but we can expect
two-thirds
of the specimens
to range between
7.5
and 8.5 cm. (one-sixth
of them will be over 8.5 cm, and one-sixth
under 7.5cm).

in the granites

are

for distinguishing

Quartz
is the most durable
of the abundant
minerals
because
of its
hardness,
toug ness, and lack of cleavage.
To round a quartz
grain takes a tremendous
amount
of time;
thus quartz
is usually
subangular
in sediments
(see section
on shape).
Grains
are usually
subequant,
but those derived
from
schists
are usually
slightly
more
elongated
or platy.
In silts it is fairly
common
to find the grains
elongated
parallel
to
the c axis,
probably
the
result
of obscure
prismatic
and rhombohedral
fracture.
Terrigenous
quartz
grains
as fine as 3 microns
or even less occur,
but .OlO-.020
mm is
about
the practical
lower
limit
of quartz
in most mudrocks.
Fractured
quartz
breaks
easily on transport
(Moss, ‘72 JSP), as does poly-crystalline
(Harrell
and Blatt ‘78 JSP).
Stability.
Quartz
is ultra-stable
under
nearly
all surface
conditions,
and it is
probable
that very
little
quartz
is ever
dissolved
by weathering;
but some solution
of
quartz
in tropical
areas has been reported
with
corrosion
of grains
(Crook,
1968) and
corrosion
(by organics)
can even occur
in soils of S.E. USA (Cleary
and Conolly
‘72 JSP),
producing
skeletal
grains
by solution
along
fractures
(microgriking).
Folk
(‘78 JSP)
reviews
quartz
solution.
However,
on burial
in the sub-surface,
even
under
only
moderate
pressures
and temperatures,
quartz
may occasionally
dissolve;
thus,
some
sandstones
show sutured
quartz
grains
along
styolites,
and even styolites
in limestone
often
cut through
and dissolve
quartz
grains.
Dolomite
or calcite
rarely
replace
the
edges
of quartz
grains,
to form
etched
or pitted
contacts
(quartz
in limestones
or
dolomi tes is often thought
to be replaced
when it is really just an optical
illusion
caused
by “overlap”
of carbonate
around
the curving
edge of the quartz
grain).
It can also be
replaced
by pyrite.
On the other
hand, quartz
grains
commonly
have authigenic
quartz
overgrowths,
showing
that the mineral
may either
grow or be destroyed
depending
on
condi tons.
Depositional
Characteristics.
Quartz
in sandstones
is uniformly
distributed,
in
mudrocks
usually
occurs as laminae
or clots, and in limestones
may occur as laminae
or
as scattered
grains
or nests.
Grains
often
show physical
orientation
parallel
with the
bedding,
in addition,
they also more rarely
show an optical
orientation
with the slow ray
(c axis)
parallel
with
the bedding.
Check
this by inserting
the gypsum
plate;
a
dominance
of blue
grains
in one direction
and yellow
grains
in a direction
of 90”
indicates
optical
orientation.
This is partially
due to differential
abrasion,
with the “c”
axis direction
being harder
so the grains
tend to become
elongated
parallel
to “c”, and
partially
due to a weak
tendency
to fracture
into chips
parallel
to “c” rather
than
perpendicular
to it.
Quartz
Varieties.
The study of quartz
types is one of the most fascinating
and
valuable
aspects
of sedimentary
petrography.
It is of great
value
in paleogeographic
interpretation,
and is increasingly
used in the correlation
of formations.
H.C. Sorby
(1858,
1877, 1880) first
studied
inclusions
and extinction
in quartz
grains
as a clue to
their
source.
Later
work
along
this line was done by Mackie
in the 1890’s, and the
subject
achieved
great
height
under
Krynine
in the 1940’s.
Blatt
(1960’s)
has made an
intensive
quantitative
study of quartz
in source
rocks and sediments,
and Basu, Suttner
and others
have made further
advances
in the ‘70’s.
Quartz
is an ideal mineral
to use
because
there
are so many possible
varieties,
and because
many of them can be assigned
to a definite
type of source
area.
Each environment
of quartz
formation--batholith,
volcano,
schist,
pegmatite,
fault
zone --lends
its characteristic
impress
to the properties of the quartz
grains,
and these properties
remain
when the grain
is deposited
in
sediments
derived
from
these areas, as first shown by Sorby.
In the

about the provenance

Quartz

A.

Plutonic
Quartz, from granite
batholiths
or granite-gneisses,
thus the most
abundant
type.
Shape xenomorphic,
irregular
subequant,
sometimes
with
re-entrant
angles.
Single crystals
average
about
0.5 mm.
Often
has
straight

undulose
extinction
in sand-size
grains,
but may be
strongly
undulose if the batholith
has been stressed after solidification,
or if
the rock is gneissic.
A few grains may be composites.
Usually contains no
inclusions
other than a small amount of scattered
vacuoles;
if these are
randomly
scattered
they were probably
trapped during crystallization,
but if
arranged
in lines (actually
planes) they probably
formed
upon stressing of
the parent rock and represent
incipient,
healed fractures.
Mineral
inclusions
sometimes
occur
but are not common;
rutile,
zircon,
micas, feldspar,
biotite,
hornblende,
tourmaline,
etc. are most frequent.
Because much
quartz
from other
environments
(metamorphic,
vein, etc.) has the same
characteristics
as “plutonic”
quartz,
a better
name for this type is “common” quartz.

B.

Volcanic
Quartz, as phenocrysts
derived from erosion of volcanic
rocks such
as rhyolites,
latites,
dacites, etc. or as direct contributions
from ash falls, is
not abundant
in general but some stratigraphic
sequences contain numerous
grains of it, and it is an excellent
stratigraphic
marker.
Recognition
is
based mainly on shape --whole
or fragmental
bipyramidal
crystals
lacking
prism faces, hexagonal
with geometrically
straight
edges (compare
with

but usually
with rounded corners.
They often have
large rounded

always straight,
usually contain no inclusions
and thus are water-clear.
There are rarely any

occasionally
bits of volcanic
glass or aphanitic
volcanic
ground-mass
may be trapped,
sometimes
in the form of negative
hexagonal
crystals.
On abrasion,
the diagnostic
features
of volcanic
quartz are lost.
Be on the conservative
side when identifying
quartz as volcanic.
In recent
sands, volcanic
phenocrysts
are easily recognizable
by their highly polished
surfaces
and water-clear
appearance,
together
with the typical
hexagonal
bipyramid
shape and embayments.

C.

Vein Quartz, derived
from pegmatites,
hydrothermal
and much more rarely
sedimentary
vein fi Ilings.
It is very common
but not usually
abundant
except in certain
stratigraphic
horizons;
it is possibly the most comon type
of quartz occurring
in pebbles.
Shape is not diagnostic.
Extinction
is most

partly a reflection
of the comb structure
produced
as the crystals

to the walls of

Many grains have straight
extinction,
however,
and sometimes
the
extinction
may be slightly
undulose, because the formation
of veins is often
accompanied
by stresses; intense stress and shearing
causes vein quartz in
some cases to take on a metamorphic
appearance

but this is then arbitrarily
classed as stretched
metamorphic
quartz.
Grains contain
no microlites
as a rule (occasionally

or feldspar
may occur if it is from a pegmatite,
or
carbonate
if a cooler vein) but in most cases vacuoles are very abundant,
giving the typical
milky appearance
to pebbles and even sand grains, because

Quartz

not be referred

descriptive,
non-genetic
term.
II.

Metamorphic

Quartz

A.

Recrystallized
Metamorphic
Quartz.
Formed
under intense
but non-shearing
stresses
when quartz
recrystallizes,
or else by recrystallization
after
stress
has passed.
In the lab, recrystallization
occurs
at 600-8OoOC
(Tullis,
‘73
GSA).
Occurs
in many recrystallized
metaquartzites,
highly
metamorphosed
and gneissic
rocks.
Shape subequant.
Extinction
is straight
(recrystallization destroys
any previous
strain),
and grains may be either
single individuals
or composites
made
up of a mosaic
of equidimensional
grains
with rather
straight
boundaries,
and widely
different
optic
orientation.
Contains
few
inclusions,
mostly
vacuoles;
appears
to have
less vacuoles
than plutonic
quartz.
May have
mineral
inclusions
in small
amounts,
feldspar,
micas,
tourmaline,
etc.
Usually
it is quite
difficult
to tell from
plutonic
quartz
(of ten
impossible),
but
despite
its
lack
of
recognition
probably
is an
important
contributor
to sands.
Caution:
the chief diagnostic
feature
is the
presence
of composite
grains;
naturally
these
will
be less evident
if the
sandstone
is finer,
so in comparing
samples
you should
work
with
ones of
about
the same grain
size; also on prolonged
abrasion
or chemical
weathering composite
grains
will break apart
into their
sub-individuals
and look like
single grains
of plutonic
quartz.

B.

Schistose
Quartz
forms
during
lit-par-lit
injection
of schists,
also
on
recrystallization
of schistose
rocks.
Quartz
grows
in between
parallel
mica
flakes,
hence
is often
elongated
or platy,
with
sub-parallel
straight
edges;
since it forms
by recrystallization
or growth
from
solution
after
stress has
passed,
it seldom
has strain
shadows
and usually
shows straight
extinction.
Composite
grains
are common.
It sometimes
has no inclusions
and vacuoles
are uncommon,
but micaceous
inclusions
or other
metamorphic
minerals
are
frequent.
It is a common
type of quartz
but difficult
to recognize
if there
has been prolonged
abrasion,
because
the chief
diagnostic
feature
is the
shape.
Its presence
can be shown by a statistical
count
of the length-width
ratios
of grains
in a slide (Bokman),
an idea first proposed
by Sorby.

C.

Stretched
Metamorphic
Quartz
(or Sheared
Quartz)
is very easy to recognize
It
forms
when
a quartz-bearing
rock
and is quite
important
in sediments.
(be it older
sandstone,
granite,
schist,
or quartz
vein) is sheared
or strained
in the absence
of recrystallization.
Grains
are generally
elongated
or platy.
Extinction
is moderately
to strongly
undulose,
and grains
may be single
but
are usually
made
up of sub-individuals
of lensoid
or “smeared-out”
shape.
Often
boundaries
between
sub-individuals
are intensely
crenulated
or sutured,
sometimes
finely
granulated.
Sometimes
metamorphic
inclusions--

71

micas, sillimanite,
garnet,
etc,--are
present.
This type of quartz
is common
in graywackes.
Cautions:
(I)
do not confuse
fine-grained
stretched
metamorphic
quartz
with chert.
Microcrystals
of chert seldom
are over
IO
microns,
and are randomly
oriented
as a rule; the component
individuals
of
stretched
metamorphic
quartz
are
usually
elongated,
coarser
than
20
microns,
and are in sub-parallel
orientation
(test with gypsum
plate).
(2) On
prolonged
abrasion
metamorphic
quartz
may possibly
abrade
or fracture
faster
than plutonic
quartz,
so in very well-rounded
sands the percentage
of
metaquartz
may be abnormally
low.
(3) Be careful
not to be confused
by
post-depositional
strain-shadows
when
studying
quartz
types;
sandstones
made entirely
of straight-extinction
quartz
develop
strain
shadows
where
strongly
folded
or faulted,
with
most
strain
occurring
where
a grain
is
“pinched”
by corners
of a neighboring
detrital
grain.
III.

Reworked

Sedimentary

Quartz.

Sedimentary
authigenic
quartz
is sometimes
found
as reworked
detrital
grains.
The most common
kind is as quartz
grains
with
reworked
overgrowths,
formed
in an
older sandstone
or limestone.
Overgrowths
survive
river
transport,
and probably
most
beach transport,
with very little
sign of abrasion;
so do not try to identify
a reworked
overgrowth
by its so-called
“abrasion”,
because
this cannot
be seen in thin section
(unless the grain is broken
right
slap in two).
If, in a sandstone,
scattered
grains
have
good overgrowths
and others
have none, and particularly
if the nuclei
of the overgrowth
grains
have
a uniform
shape
(e.g.
all are well
rounded),
then
they
are
probably
reworked.
Indigenous
overgrowths
usually
interlock
with long or sinuous
contacts,
and
occur
on most
of the grains
in the slide
regardless
of the shape
of the nucleus.
Occasionally
quartz
nodules
are reworked
from older carbonate
rocks, where
they occur
associated
with chert nodules.
These consist
of flamboyant
quartz
and are quite scarce;
they often
originate
through
replacement
of evaporites.
Empirical
Classification
(Folk).
Six extinction
types are recognized
for counting
purposes;
(I) Straight,
the grain
extinguishes
uniformly
all over
at once.
(2) Slightly
undulose,
the grain is a single individual
and the extinction
shadow
sweeps smoothly
and
without
breaks
across
the grain;
however
the sweep
is accomplished
on very
slight
rotation
of the stage.
(3) Strongly
undulose,
the grain
is a single
individual
and the
extinction
shadow
sweeps smoothly
across,
but a large rotation
of the stage is required
betwen
the time
one part
of the grain
is extinguished
to the time
another
part
is
extinguished.
(It is difficult
to establish
objective
boundaries
between
the three
classes,
but experience
has shown
that
in grains
of .I!%.35mm,
“straight”
grains
undulose”
grains
require
a
extinguish
with
a stage
rotation
of less than
lo, “slightly
rotation
of lo to 5” before
the deepest
part of the extinction
shadow
sweeps from one
side of the grain
to the other,
and “strongly
undulose”
grains
require
a rotation
of over
5”, often
as much as 20” or more.
Blatt
says that this measurement
is useless if made
on a flat stage because
we do not see the true extinction
angle).
(4) Semicomposite,
the
grain
is made up of two or more sub-individuals
with very close optical
orientation,
but
there
is a distinct
break between
individuals
and the extincxshadow
does not sweep
smoothly
across;
the
individuals
may
however
have
straight
to slightly
undulose
extinction.
The presence
of crenulated
borders
or strong
undulose
extinction
throws
this into class “6 . I’ (5) Composite,
th e grain in made up of two or more sub-individuals,
with wide1
differing
orientation,
but these same individuals
have normal
(not crenulated + boundaries
and straight
to slightly
undulose
extinction.
(6) Composite
metamorphic,
the grain
is made
up of two or more
sub-individuals
with
strongly
undulose
extinction,
and may or may not have crenulated
boundaries.

72

There
is of course
some degree
of tie-up
between
the genetic
and empirical
classifications.
As shown
on page 71, types
I and 2 come mostly
from
granites
and
gneisses,
to a smaller
extent
from
recrystallized
metamorphic
rocks,
and to some
extent
from
veins.
Types
3 and
6 come
chiefly
from
gneisses
and stretched
metamorphic
sources,
but type 3 is in some strained
granites.
Type 4 is typical
of
hydrothermal
veins (but also occurs
in lesser amounts
in other
rocks),
and type 5 occurs
chiefly
in schists or recrystallized
metamorphic
loci, but to a small extent
in granites.
The second
basis for the empirical
classification
is the type of inclusion
present.
Here
some leeway
is present
and for each problem
a different
classification
might
be
set up; for example,
in some areas vermicular
chlorite
inclusions
might
be diagnostic
and would
be set up as a separate
class for counting;
or, the presence
of negative
crystals
or of tourmaline
inclusions
might be of value
and would
be counted
separately.
For general
purposes,
the following
classification
is suggested,
operated
under
the
principle
that if a grain
does not fit in the first
category,
one goes on down the line
until he finds the first category
that applies
(for example,
a grain with abundant
bubbles
and rutile
needles
would be placed
in class “a”).
The types are as follows:
(a) Abundant
vacuoles
(grain
may even appear
milky
in reflected
light;
(b) Rutile
needles
or other
hairlike
inclusions;
(c) Microlites
(inclusions
of minerals
other
than rutile);
(d) Sparse
vacuoles,
no microlites.
For detailed
work,
microlites
should be identified
and counted
separately.
Of these classes,
type “a” is diagnostic
of hydrothermal
veins;
‘lb” is an
excellent
stratigraphic
and regional
marker,
but its genetic
significance
is characteristic of metamorphic
terranes,
but also occurs
in plutonic
environments;
and “d” is the
commonest
type, derived
from all sources.

In practice,
one examines
a series of slides to set up the diagnostic
quartz
types
present,
patterning
it after
the above
classes.
If necessary
he erects
additional
classes
to take care of types he thinks
might
be significant.
Then he proceeds
to count
100 or
more
grains
(always
under
high power),
and classifies
each grain
as “I b”, “3a”,
etc.,
recording
them in a binary
table.
If special
types, such as volcanic
quartz
or reworked
abraded
grains
are present,
they may be counted
in a separate
class.
After
this has
been done, he re-examines
the slide with
the genetic
classification
in mind, refers
to
the graph,
and decides
the probable
lithology
of the source
area.
To do this he also
takes into account
the associated
minerals,
and the effects
of grain size and abrasion
on
his count
(less composite
grains
will
be found
if the material
is fine-grained,
etc.).
Criteria
for an older sedimentary
source
have already
been indicated.
In general
grains
from a sedimentary
source
area are of diverse
types;
if quartztypes
are few the source
is probably
a primary
igneous
rock.
An Opposing
View on Quartz
Extinction.
H. Blatt
(I 963-l 967) has recently
made
study
of quartz
in igneous
and metamorphic
rocks,
in the immediate
disintegration
products
of such rocks (grus),
and in consolidated
sedimentary
rocks from many areas.
His results
do not support
the “classical”
interpretation
given above.
(I) Blatt measured
the true degree
of undulatory
extinction
in 586 medium
sand-sized
quartz
grains
from
freshly
disintegrated
granites,
schists,
and gneisses.
He found
(a) that
91% of these
grains
have less than seven
degrees
of undulose
extinction;
(b) there
is no correlation
between
rock type
and amount
of strain
of the grains;
(c) no grain
had undulose
extinction
greater
than
eighteen
degrees.
From
these
data,
Blatt
concluded
the
strength
of the quartz
structure
does not generally
allow the development
of more than
ten degrees
of undulose
extinction.
This
result
is consistent
with
the results
of
experimental
deformation
of quartz.
The important
point
is that Blatt
claims
that no
real difference
exists
in degree
of undulose
extinction
in quartz
grains
among
igneous
and metamorphic
rocks,
and therefore
that
any “averaging”
method
of determining
amount
of undulose
extinction
on a flat
stage
is at least as useless
as attempts
at
differentiation
with
universal-stage
measurements.
(2) Blatt
further
says that
if one
defines
“strongly”
undulatory
as greater
than five
degrees
of undulose
extinction,
as
Folk does, there
are very
few truly
strongly
undulatory
grains,
and most grains
that
appear
to be “strongly”
undulatory
appear
that way only as a result
of the relationship
between
the plane
of the thin-section
and the plane
containing
the optic
axes in a
strained
grain.
(3) Blatt’s
dat a indicates
that, based on universal-stage
measurements,
the percentage
of grains
with greater
than one degree
of undulose
extinction
(Folk’s
slightly
and strongly
undulatory
grains)
is statistically
identical
among granites,
schists,
and gneisses.
Therefore,
there
appears
to be no way of distinguishing
between
quartz
grains
from
each of these
three
rock groups
on the basis of either
the unstrained/strained
ratio or on the basis of the slightly
strained/strongly
strained
ratio.
(4) Blatt
feels
that medium
sized polycrystalline
quartz
grains
composed
of ten or more subgrains
are an excellent
indicator
of metamorphic
source
(composite
quartz
of Folk).
However,
he considers
that medium
sized grains
composed
of less than five sub-grains
are as commonly
derived
from
granites
as from
schists
and gneisses.
(5) Blatt’s
data
shows that well-rounded,
pure quartz
sandstones
(i.e. supermature
orthoquartzites)
have
a very
high percentage
of “straight”
quartz,
much higher
than any conceivable
source
rock.
He interprets
this as being
due to selective
destruction
of undulatory
quartz,
while
the unstrained
quartz
survives.
This had been suspected
for some time by many
workers.
Basu et al. (I 975 JSP) and Young (I 976 JSP) have come to a practical
middle

is a very

by how tightly
that formation

thus
it is essential
to determine

deformation
of the depositional
basin.
“Deformation”
here
includes
anything
from
gentle
warping
to intense
folding
and
faulting;
the essential
point
is that now sediments
are no longer
being
laid down in the same basin.
Source
of the silica may be far-travelled
subsurface
waters;
solution
of detrital
quartz
grains
under
pressure
provides
a small
amount

For any given
formation,
deciding
when it became
cemented
with quartz
is a very
difficult
problem.
Petrographic
work must be supplemented
with extensive
field
work;
in fact field work is probably
the best method
of attack.
The microscope
must be used
however
to determine
how the cement
formed
(by replacement
or direct
precipitation);
the nature
of diagnostic
inclusions
which
might
indicate
temperature
or composition
of
the precipitating
solutions;
whether
the cement
has spread
the sand grains
apart
by
pressure
of its growth;
the relation
of the cement
to joints,
stains,
alteration
or other
time markers.
But field work combined
with intelligent
sampling
is generally
required
to obtain
the areal and stratigraphic
distribution
of cement,
which
is generally
the key
to the problem.
For example,
if a formation
is cemented
uniformly
over
tens of
thousands
of square
miles,
the cement
is probably
syngenetic,
formed
from sea water
at
the same time
as or just after
the sand grains
were
being
deposited.
Hydrothermal
sources
are rather
easy to establish
or eliminate
by noting
if the formation
is cemented
only in the vicinity
of known
hydrothermal
activity;
widespread
cements
cannot
be
caused
by this process.
Whether
or not the cement
has formed
on deep burial
can be
determined
by reconstructing
the structural
history
of the area in which
the formation
occurs;
parts of the formation
never
deeply
buried
then should
lack cement.
Cements
quite
frequently
are related
to the structural
geology
of a formation;
many
are

78

cemented
tightly
in the vicinity
of faults
(where
shattering
has aided
migration
of
silica-precipitating
fluids),
and some are cemented
in tightly
folded
areas but loose in
non-folded
ones.
In large scale folds a thermal
gradient
may be established
(because
of
the general
increase
of temperature
with
depth),
and this affects
the solubility
of
minerals
and may cause selective
cementation
at anticlinal
crests or synclinal
troughs.
Badly
jointed
areas
(as at the crests
of folds)
may
also become
tightly
cemented
because
of easier
fluid migration.
Weathering
may be easily determined
as the cause by
noting
correlation
of cementation
with the actual
outcrop
of the formation
versus
its
condition
in deep cores or spots inaccessible
to weathering.
If one sets out to solve a
problem
of this type, sampling
is the chief
concern.
He should
take weathered
outcrop
samples
and deep cores; sample
folded
areas, jointed
areas, faulted
areas, and flat-lying
areas, obtain
samples
near and far from
hydrothermal
activity;
study the correlation
of
grain
size of the sand with
cementation;
the relation
of cemented
zones to overlying
and underlying
formations,
etc.
In general,
older
formations
are more
likely
to be cemented
with
quartz
than
younger
ones; yet there
are many uncemented
Cambrian
or Ordovician
sands, and some
Cretaceous
or Tertiary
ones are tightly
cemented
with
quartz.
In general,
deeply
buried
or strongly
folded
sands are more
apt to be cemented,
but many
horizontal,
unfaulted
beds that have never
been buried
over a few hundred
feet are also cemented
tightly.
The problem
is an interesting
and difficult
one.

Chert

and Opal

Sedimentary
quartz
assumes
three
forms:
(I) megaquartz,
a general
term
for
quartz
overgrowths,
crystals,
geode and vein fillings,
composed
of equant
to elongated
grains
larger
than 20 microns;
and (2) microquartz,
divided
into (2A) microcrystalline
quartz,
forming
a pinpoint-birefringent
aggregate
of equidimensional
grains
usually
ranging
from
l-5 microns
in diameter
(but ranging
from
a fraction
of a micron--in
the
apparently
isotropic
cherts--to
20 microns,
the
arbritrary
upper
limit);
and (2B)
chalcedonic
quartz,
forming
sheaf-like
bundles
of radiating
extremely
thin fibers,
which
average
about
0.1 mm long but may range from
20 microns
to a millimeter
long.
All
three
types
are transitional
in some degree.
Both
forms
of microquartz
consist
of
nothing
but finely
crystalline
quartz
containing
variable
amounts
of very minute
Iiquidfilled
spherical
bubbles,
averaging
0.1 micron
in diameter,
which
look brownish
in
transmitted
light and silvery
in reflected
light
(Folk
and Weaver).
These
bubbles
are
responsible
for lowering
the index of chalcedony
so that it varies
from
1.535 in most
bubbly
specimens
up to 1.544 in those with few bubbles.
They also decrease
the density
of microquartz
and provide
a sponge-like
character
so that solution
is quicker,
and this
type of quartz
consequently
weathers
faster
than megaquartz.
Two
length-slow
varieties
of fibrous
silica,
quartzine
and lutecite,
apparently
occur
as a replacement
of evaporites
or in sulfate-rich,
alkaline
environments
such as
semi-arid
paleosoils
(Folk
& Pittman,
197 I, J.S.P.;
Milliken,

rock, essentially
monomineralic
and composed

of microcrystalline

Reworked

Detr

i tal Chert

Chert
may be eroded
out of older
limestones
and chert
beds, and the elastic
particles
contributed
to form a terrigenous
constituent
of sandstones.
Chert
may be in
turn
reworked
from
these older
chert-bearing
sandstones.
Such reworked
chert
forms
l-4%
of the terrigenous
fraction
of sediments.
It is always
diagnostic
of an older
sedimentary
source,
hence should
be searched
for diligently
in determining
the source
area of a given sandstone.
It is slightly
less durable
than quartz
(slightly
softer,
a little
more
brittle),
but despite
this, usually
occurs
in pebbles
because
the nodules
simply
started
out so big.
E. Sneed (U.T.M.A.
1955) has shown
that chert
pebbles
are more
difficult
to round
than quartz
because
they tend to chip and split;
but sand-sized
chert
rounds
faster
than quartz
because
it is softer.
It is also somewhat
less stable
than
quartz,
because
the fine grain size and bubble
content
presents
a large surface
area to
chemical
attack.
Weathered
cherts

a whitish
outer
band or patina

of carbonate

and sometimes

Availability.
Feldspar
forms
5-15%
of the terrigenous
fraction
of sediments.
Feldspar
is by far the most abundant
mineral
in igneous
rocks,
and its much
lessened
volume
in sediments
is because
of the ease of weathering
and lack of durability,
Most

Volcanic
rocks contribute
small quantities
of plagioclase
and a

In general,
orthoclase
is the dominant
feldspar
in sediments
because
of
its great availability;
microcline
is a close second despite
the fact that it is more stable
than
orthoclase;
sodic
plagioclase
is a poor
third;
and calcic
plagioclase
is almost
lacking.
Formations
in which plagioclase
is abundant
are consequently
unusual.
Thus, if
a formation
contains
more
plagioclase
than K-feldspar,
suspect
a volcanic
source-especially
if the plagioclase
crystals
are zoned.
If a formation
contains
very little
or no
feldspar,
people
often
assume that it was because
of prolonged
abrasion
or a high rate
of weathering;
however,
it may just as easily
mean
that
little
or no feldspar
was
available
in the source
area.
Schists,
phyllites,
slates,
or older
sediments
contribute
little
or none.
Occasionally
feldspar
can be reworked
from
an older
feldspathic
sediment
into a younger
one; but nearly
all feldspar
comes from
a primary
igneous
or
metamorphic
source.
Durability.
Feldspar
is softer
than quartz
and has a much better
cleavage,
hence
abrasion
reduces
size and increases
roundness
much more
rapidly.
Thus the relation
between
the size of quartz
and feldspar
and the roundness
of quartz
and feldspar
is one
of the most valuable
keys to the history
of the sediment
and in determining
direction
of
the source
area.
In youthful
sediments
quartz
and feldspar
will be the same size (or
feldspar
may even be larger
since it starts out in the parent
rock as larger
crystals),
and
of essentially
similar
shape.
As the sediments
suffer
more abrasion,
feldspar
becomes
smaller
and rounder
than quartz;
by the time quartz
becomes
well-rounded,
the feldspar
is usually
much finer.
Of course,

the process
of abrasion

composed
of angular
grains
of quartz
and feldspar
of equal size, and simply

alone

a supermature
orthoquartzite
in which
all the grains
are wellrounded,
and the feldspar
is reduced
to a very small percentage
concentrated
in the silt
size while the sand fraction
is nearly
all quartz
(Folk).
Stability.
Feldspars
are unstable
under
deuteric,
hydrothermal,
and weathering
conditions.
Four
types
of alteration
are important:
kaolinization,
sericitization
(or
illitization),
solution,
and vacuolization.
Kaolin
forms
as tiny flakes
throughout
the
feldspar
grain;
the flakes
have an index
slightly
higher
than the feldspar,
and give a
gray
birefringence.
They
do not impart
a cloudy
appearance
to the grain,
as the
brownish
turbidity
that textbooksassign
to kaolin
is actually
caused
by bubbles.
Most
kaolin
forms
on intense
weathering
by the complete
removal
of K, but sometimes
forms
hydrothermally.
Sericite
and illite
form
tiny flakes
with indices
higher
than feldspar,
giving
a white
to yellow
birefringence
and often
having
crystallo-graphically-controlled
distribution.
They
are most
commonly
formed
hydrothermally
but also result
on
weathering
if it is not intense
(as in semi-arid
climates).

the crystallizing
feldspar
(thus feldspars

contain
abundant

while
the feldspar

rocks is clear
because

T.W.
Todd and D.N.
Miller,
Jr. (U. T. 19.55) have discovered
post-depositional
cavernous
alterations
of Kfeldspars
with development
of huge holes inside the feldspar
grains.
Todd (I968

the complexities

Feldspars
may
become
altered
(I)
in the
source
rock
through
deuteric
or
hydrothermal
activity;
(2) in the soils of the source
area
by weathering;
(3) postdepositionally,
either
on deep
burial
by migrating
connate
waters,
or when
the
sedimentary
rocks are exposed
to the Recent
surface
and weathered.
Post-depositional
alteration
may be suspected
if weathered
feldspar
grains
tend to occur
together,
as in
the neighborhood
of veins,
stylolites,
or other
weathered
surfaces;
or if well-cemented
rocks
contain
fresh feldspar
and porous
portions
contain
weathered
feldspar.
Comparison of the freshness
of feldspar
overgrowth
with the feldspar
sand grains
also helps.
In
some
sedimentary
rocks,
feldspars
are partially
to completely
replaced
by calcite;
rarely,
they are replaced
by quartz.
Considering
the several
kinds
of feldspar,
microcline
is the most
stable
under
weathering
conditions,
with
orthoclase
next.
Sodic
plagioclase
is apparently
more
unstable
under
surface
conditions,
for in streams
and soils on peneplaned
igneous
areas
there
is very
little
plagioclase,
even though
it is common
in the source
rocks.
In Llano
(Texas)
plagioclase

more

microcline
(Begle).

Climatic,
Tectonic
and Physiographic
Interpretation
based on Feldspar.
This is a
complex
subject,
because
of the relative
durability
and chemical
stability
of quartz
and
feldspar,
together
with the confusing
effects
of rate of weathering
and rate of erosion.
P.D. Krynine
has shown
that
the main clues are grain
roundness,
indicating
length
of
time
available
hence
the
rate
of erosion,
the
ruggedness
of the
topography
and
ultimately
the tectonic
framework;
and average
degree
of alteration
of the feldspar
together
with homogeneity
of alteration
of the feldspar.
By homogeneity
is meant:
“do
all the feldspars
of one species
show about
the same degree
of alteration,
or does the
same species
show a mixture
of fresh
and weathered
grains?”
It is normal
in sediments
to find orthoclase
more
weathered
than microcline
or sodic plagioclase,
but the thing
you must
look for
is a mixture
of fresh
plus weathered
grains
of the same mineral
species
(Krynine).
A humid
climate
with
rugged
topography
produces
abundant
feldspar
in angular,
coarse
grains
with
a wide
variation
from
fresh
to heavily
weathered
(because
the
vigorous
streams
can cut through
the intensely
weathered
mantle
to fresh
bedrock).
If
the climate
is dry the feldspar
will
all be pretty
fresh,
as was observed
by Mackie
( 18991, Judd (I 885), and Wade (191 I, QJGS).
Well-rounded,
fresh
feldspars
if present
in
moderate
to abundant
quantitites
are excellent
indicators
of an arid
climate
and
peneplane
conditions.
These
are commcn
in some
of our
best ancient
dune
sand
blankets,
associated
with
dune cross-bedding
and evaporities.
The criterion
seems to
work
so well
that
it may somewhat
irreverently
be referred
to as the “Dogma
of the
Immaculate
Feldspar”.
If topography
is low, and the climate
is humid
and warm,
nearly
all the feldspar
will be weathered
away.
These relations
are shown
in the graph below,
in which
“Intensity”
is to be determined,
given the other factors.

The boundary

source
for the micas
is, however,
in the metamorphic

In general,

4:l.
This is a result
of the chemical

Durability.
Despite
its low hardness
of 2-3 and the good cleavage,
mica is a very
durable
mineral,
extremely
difficult
to round and almost
impossible
to fracture.
This is
becasue
it is so elastic;
also because
of the flaky shape it tends to dodge
around
grains
in transport.
Rarely,
formations
contain
rounded
flakes
of mica

exceptional
conditions

abrasion.
Modern

definitions
of clay:
(I) based simply
on size, including

be it true clay minerals,
quartz,
calcite,

or any other
substance;
this is the “clay”
of the grain-size

of the sedimentologists
and oceanographers;
(2) based on composition,
defined
as one of the hydrous

silicates
belonging
to the kaolin,
montmorillonite

groups
and also including
fine-grained
chlorite

(3) the petrographic

Because
they
are so similar
in these
properties,
they
are
difficult
to identify
microscopically.
Study is hindered
by their
fine grain
size (most true clay minerals
are
finer
than 2 microns),
by the fact that most naturally-occurring
clayey
rocks contain
intimate
mixtures
of several
different
clay
minerals,
and by the
abundance
of
impurities

the appearance

of the difficulty
of microscopic
study, clays are commonly
identified
by

techniques.
The best technique
is to get the composition
by such instruments,
then go back to the thin section

with
this information

Origin
and Significance.
Clays
form
25 - 35% of the terrigenous
fraction
of
sedimentary
rocks.
The clay minerals
in a qiven
sedimentary
rock may have formed
in
any one of ‘the following
ways;
( I ) reworked
without
chemical
change
through
simple
disaggregation
of older clay-bearing
rocks such as shales, clayey
limestones,
slates, or
phyllites;
(2) by chemical
weathering
(soil formation)
of minerals
containing
Al and Si,
chiefly
feldspar
but some
from
mafic
minerals,
micas
and some
from
older
clay
minerals;
(3) by subaqueous
weathering
of volcanic
ash; (4) by diagenetic
changes
taking
place
on the sea floor
after
deposition;
(5) by diagenetic
changes
taking
place during
deep burial,
migration
of connate
solutions,
or incipient
metamorphism;
(6) by intense
metamorphism;
and (7) by post-diagenetic
weathering,
taking
place after
the outcrop
is
once more exposed
to the surface
and weathered-thus running
the cycle back to (2)
again.
(I) Simple
disaggregation
of older clay-bearing
rocks yields chiefly
illite,
because
most shales are composed
of illitic
clay which
is often
reworked
without
much change
except
for K stripping.
Lesser
amounts
of sericite,
chlorite,
montmorillonite,
and
kaolin come from this source.
Disaggregation
of slates and phyllites
yields either
illite
or sericite
depending
on the intensity
of the metamorphism,
with sericite
indicating
the
higher
grade;
considerable
chlorite
may also come from this source,
but little
kaolin and
almost
no montmorillonite,
as these are generally
converted
into other
minerals
(illite,
sericite
or chlorite)
on metamorphism.
To ascertain
whether
this
is the source
responsible
for the clay minerals
in a given sediment,
look for other evidences
of a slate
or shale source
area, such as discrete
shale or slate fragments
in the associated
sands.
This
is a very
important
source
of clay minerals
in Recent
sediments
and those of
Tertiary
or younger
age, because
the continents
are now largely
blanketed
with
older
clay-bearing
sedimentary
rocks.
An abundance
of detrital
chlorite
and biotite
is often
associated
with volcanism.
(2) Weathering
(soil formation)
is the ultimate
source
of most clay.
The effect
of
weathering
on clay minerals
may be understood
if one thing
is remembered:
the clay
minerals
because
of their
tremendous
surface
area are highly
reactive,
and will react so
as to attain
equilibrium
with the ions in their
environment.
Naturally
the ions present
will depend
on two things:
(I) what ions are supplied
in abundance
by the source
rock,
and (2) are those ions retained
in the soil (arid climate)
or rapidly
removed
by leaching
(warm,
humid
climate).
Under
incomplete
leaching
K and Mg remain
in the soil; if basic
rocks are being weathered,
abundant
Mg ions are liberated
and montomorillonite,
the
Mg clay, forms
(possibly
sometimes
chlorite
and vermiculite);
if acid rocks are being
incompletely
leached,
abundant
K ions are freed
and illite,
the K clay, results.
Under
complete
leaching,
both K and Mg are removed
from
the soil by percolating
ground
water,
and Kaolin
(which
lacks both K and Mg) forms.
Temperature
also affects
this
reaction,
cooler
conditions
inhibiting
formation
of kaolin.
Under
humid
tropical
conditions
and prolonged
time,
even the Si will be removed
from
kaolin
and gibbsite,
purehydrous
alumina,
is left (but sometimes
bauxite
can be re-silicated
to kaolin).
In
the humid
tropics,
basalts
give much amorphous
clay (allophane).
Note
that not only
feldspars
and ferromagnesians
break
down to clay; even illite,
for example,
if derived
from
an older
illitic
shale and then weathered
under warm
humid
conditions
may first
break
down into “degraded
illite”
(which
is simply
the illite

not-too
intense
weathering,
and gives
a mortmorillonite-like
pattern
on the X-ray
spectrometer.
Weaver
has found that this type of “montmorillonite”
will take up K and

91

revert
to illite
in the lab (also in sea water),
whereas
most volcanic
montmorillonite
will
not, and this serves
to distinguish
the two.
To determine
if weathering
is
responsible
for the particular
clay mineral
present
in a sedimentary
rock,
the clay
mineralogy
should be compared
with other
data, e.g., conditions
of feldspars
or kinds of
fossils
as climatic
indicators.
It has been claimed
that a prolonged
time of weathering
under moderate
conditions,
may have the same mineralogical
results
as more extreme
heat and moisture
for a shorter
period.
Thus, rarely,
kaolin
and alumina
minerals
may
form
in very old “temperate”
soils.
(3) Subaqueous
weathering
of acid volcanic
ash usually
produces
montmorillonite
but sornetimes
illite;
the older bentonites
tend to be more illitic,
but these may have
been montmorillonite
to begin
with
and changed
over
on diagenesis
and deep burial.
Volcanism
is a major
source
for montmorillonitic
clays,
but much
montmorillonite
develops
on weathering
(= degraded
illite,
above).
Basic
volcanic
material
often
weathers
to chlorite.
To prove
a volcanic
origin,
look for shards,
volcanic
fragments,
plagioclase,
biotite,
other mafic
minerals,
or idiomorphic
zircon and apatite.
(4) Marine
diagenesis
starts
altering
certain
clay minerals
as soon as they are
dumped
by fresh-water
streams
into the salty ocean, rich in Na, Mg, and K ions. Mixedlayer montmorillonite-illite
(i.e., partially
to completely
degraded
illite,
the latter
also
termed
“Weathering”
mcntmorillonite)
regains
its K very quickly
from
sea water
and is
partly
or completely
reconverted
to illite.
Fixation
of K+ to form
illite
happens
very
rapidly
if the clay is ingested
by certain
animals
and defecated
(Jonas).
Under
certain
conditions,
it may pick up Mg from
sea water
and go to chlorite
instead.
“Volcanic”
montmorillonite
apparently
undergoes
no change
on deposition
in marine
waters,
or if
there
is a change
it is much slower.
Detrital
chlorite
and illite
probably
also remain
stable
in sea water,
but minor
chemical
changes
may occur
(Ressman
& Keller,
JSP
1967).
The role of kaolinite
is uncertain.
Because
it usually
decreases
offshore,
it was
once thought
that it altered
to other
clays (e.g., illite)
by reaction
with sea water.
This
view
is now largely
abandoned.
Kaolinite
is stable
in continental,
fresh
water
deposits
and in soils under-going
weathering.
Clay minerals
in recent
sediments
are often
found
to change
systematically
when
traced
out to sea; kaolinite
being present
in continental
and nearshore
sediments,
with
illite
and montmorillonite
farther
out.
To some, this is the result
of marine
diagenesis,
with the farthest-seaward
clays having
had more time to react
with the saline
waters.
To others
(Riviere;
Weaver)
this represents
a sorting
effect,
with clay minerals
being
physically
transported
for different
distances
by currents
as a result
of their
differences in particle
size or degree
of flocculation.
The latter
school
also feels that clay
mineral
variation
both laterally
and vertically
depends
chiefly
on sorting
processes
like
that
mentioned,
or upon changes
in petrographic
character
or climate
of the source
area; clay minerals,
like sand grains,
are largely
detrital
hence chiefly
controlled
by
source
area
Iithology.
The other
school
(Grim)
feels
that clay minerals
are more
controlled
by the chemical
nature
of their
depositional
environment.
To determine
if
depositional
environment
plays a role
in clay
mineralogy
of a specific
formation,
determine
environment
of successive
beds
by other
criteria
(fossils,
glauconite,
sedimentary
structures,
size and shape criteria)
and see if clay mineralogy
changes
with
these different
environments
--but
realize
that different
clay composition
in different
environments
might
be caused by sorting
as well as diagenesis.
If the clay minerals
are
constant
in beds of different
environments,
this indicates
that the clays are probably
controlled
by the source area.

diagenesis,

and
if the environment
is rich in Fe or

Mg, chlorite

place,
and if the environment

Thus
kaolin
and montmorillonite
are uncommon
in pre-Devonian
rocks.
As true
metamorphism
begins,
both
illite
and chlorite
grow
larger,
then sericite
begins
to
replace
illite
in the higher-rank
slates, takes over almost
completely
as illite
disappears
in the phyllites,
and then sericite
in turn gives
way to muscovite
as schists
develop.
Finally
the muscovite
abdicates
in favor
of feldspar
and the rock becomes
a gneiss or
perhaps
even
a granite.
At the same time,
if the rock contains
much Fe and Mg,
chlorite
is transformed
into biotite
in the low-rank
schist stage, then may be upgraded
to hornblende
in the higher-rank
schist.
In determining
if diagenetic
processes
have
happened
in a sedimentary
rock, look for evidence
of recrystallization
(i.e., larger-thannormal
flakes),
or replacement
of detrital
quartz,
feldspar,
or calcite
by illite
or
chlorite.
In some
cases

sandstones
is filled
with
vermicular
hexagonal
stacks
of water-clear
kaolin,
encrusting
fringes
of chlorite
or montmorillonite,
or large
flaky
sericite
crystals,
all probably
precipitated
from
solution
just as
salt in a beaker
in one of the many manifestations
of diagenesis.
These
changes
can
take
place
in geologically
young
sediments
that
have
never
been folded
or deeply
buried,
therefore
require
no extreme
heat or pressure.
Kaolinite
is the most common
clay
mineral
encountered
as authigenic
pore-fillings
in sandstones,
but authigenic
chlorite

Content

The heavy
mineral
content
of a sediment
is a function
of five
very
complex
variables.
Usually
the aim of the petrographer
is to eliminate
all variables
except
one:
the lithology
of the source
area at a given time and place.
This he can use as a tool in
correlation,
and can interpret
geologic
history
by following
the source
area
as it
becomes
unroofed
by erosion
and exposes
different
types
of minerals
in different
amounts.
The five variables
are:
the ultimate
aim of the petrographer.
(I)
Lithology
of the source
area-be simple
(one rock type or assemblage)
but more commonly
is complex

PETROLOGY

OF SANDSTONES

According
to Krynine
(Jour.
Geol.
1948) sedimentary
rocks
have
three
basic
properties:
mineral
composition,
texture,
and structure.
Mineralogy
and texture
have
already
been discussed
from
a piecemeal
aspect;
now it remains
to see how they are
integrated
in the classification
and used in interpreting
the genesis
of sandstones.
Structure
is not
covered
in this
syllabus,
many
excellent
texts
now
exist
[e.g.
Pett ij ohn/Potter,
( I 963- 1964)] .
Textural
Maturity.
The texture
of sediments
has two aspects:
(I) description
of
properties,
i.e.,
determination
of the
grain-size
parameters
and grain-size
name,
measurement
of grain
shape and description
of surface
features,
and (2) integration
of
these
properties
into an assumed
sequential
development,
the four
stages
of textural
maturity.
(Folk,
J. Sed. Pet.
1951, 1956).
This concept
proposes
that,
as sediments
suffer
a greater
input of mechanical
energy
thorugh
the abrasive
and sorting
action
of
waves
or currents,
they pass sequentially
through
the following
four stages:

of the environment

In determining
maturity,
there
is one exception
to the numerical
limit
a = .5$
advocated
above.
Some sands that would
be considered
poorly
sorted
as whole,
consist
of two distinct
modes which
are in themselves
well sorted.
These examples
should be
called
“bimodal
mature”
or “bimodal
supermature”
(depending
on the rounding),
considering
them
to be genetically
well
sorted
for the purpose
of maturity
terminology,
although
numerically
they would
not be.
Many of these are desert
deflation
products
(Folk,
I968 XXIII
Int. Geol. Congress,
Praha Cedskoslovensko).
Textural
Inversions
occur when well-sorted
or well-rounded
grains occur
in a clay
matrix,
or when
a sediment
is composed
of poorly
sorted
but well-rounded
grains.
These are very valuable
in interpretation
because
they indicate
mixing
of the products
of two energy
levels.
Sorted
or rounded
sand grains
in a clay matrix
often
occur
in
lagoons
behind
barrier
bars, where
the sand grains
are blown
off the beaches
or dunes
(where
they achieved
their
sorting
and rounding)
and mixed
with the lagoonal
clays by
storm winds or waves.
Final deposition
occurs
in a low energy
environment,
therefore
texturally
inverted
sediments
are classified
as to the lowest
stage of maturity
present,
which
normally
represents
the latest
environment.
Textural
inversions
also occur when
older sandstones
are eroded
to produce
a new sediment,
for example
poorly sorted
river
sands made up of rounded
grains from outcrops
of much older sandstone.
Some textural
inversions
may be caused
by burrowing
organisms;
for example,
pelecypods
or worms
could burrow
through
a nicely
interlayered
series of well-sorted
sands and interbedded
clean
clays, and make the whole
thing
into a homogeneous
mass of clayey,

or else the currents

The range
of maturity
encountered
in natural
environments
is estimated
in the
following
figure,
thickness
of the lenses corresponding
to the most common
stages of
maturity
present
in each environment.
The next figure
attempts
to show typical
grain
size for the various
sedimentary
environments.
It is important
to realize
that the maturity
rating
of an environment
depends
on
how much
mechanical
energy
is exerted
on a sediment
after
it has been
moved
essentially
to its final
resting
place,
by currents
and waves
at the final
site of
deposition;
it does not depend
on the energy
expenditure
required
to move
it from
the
7
source
area to the sr te of final
deposition.
A flood
or turbidity
current,
for example,
may expend
a tremendous
amount
of energy
while
it is transporting
sediment,
but once
the sediment
is dropped
it is simply
buried
by more
sediment
and never
suffers
any
further
sorting
or winnowing;
thus such sediments
have low maturity.
Waves on a beach,
on the contrary,
sort and rework
the sediment
continually
as the tide goes in and out, or
as storms
and seasonal
changes
chew up beach sediments
and shift them repeatedly.
Krynine
has shown
that each sediment-modifying
process
operates
at a certain
optimum
energy
level,
and this philosophy
is certainly
true
in concept
of textural
maturity.
Thus the amount
of energy
expended
in modifying
sediments
must be within
certain
limits;
if it is too little,
sorting
and rounding
do not operate
efficiently;
if too
much energy
is exerted,
the maturity,may
be destroyed
(such as when a sudden storm
destroys
a well-sorted
beach
and mixes
it with
lagoonal
clays,
or when
a mountain
cloudburst
produces
torrents
that fracture
boulders
that had become
rounded
under a
more
gentle
stream
regimen).
Thus
sudden
excess
bursts
of energy
are
often
responsible
for textural
inversion.
It is a curious
thing that the best rounded
sands are
usually
not too well sorted;
this may mean that rounding
operates
best in environments
with
energy
levels
that are too high for optimum
sorting,
where
currents,
winds
or
waves
are too vigorous
and repeatedly
mix up and “unsort”
previously
sorted
layers of
sands.
Tectonism
and Textural
Maturity.
It has been pointed
out above
that textural
maturity
is very
largely
the result
of the environment
of deposition
(beach,
lagoon,
Some workers,
however,
claim
that
textural
floodplain,
delta,
alluvial
fan,
etc.)
maturity
is a direct
function
of tectonism:
intense
tectonic
activity
with
rapidly
subsiding
geosynclines
yielding
stratigraphic
sections
composed
entirely
of immature
sediments,
mild tectonic
instability
(unstable
shelves)
giving
all submature
sediments,
stable
conditions
(stable
shelves)
producing
nothing
but mature
sediments,
and periods
of prolonged
tectonic
stability
resulting
in supermature
sediments.
This is a gross oversimplification
because
(at least in the lower
three
stages of maturity)
environment
of
deposition
exerts
a much greater
control
than tectonism
on the sorting
and rounding
of
sediments.
Thus a flood-plain
or neritic
sediment
will probably
contain
just as much
clay if the depositional
basin
is sinking
at the rate
of one inch per hundred
years
(violent
subsidence),
or one inch per ten thousand
years
(stable
shelf).
Similarly,
a
beach sand may get just as well sorted
if the shore line stays at one position
for one
hundred
years, as it would
if the shoreline
was stabilized
for a hundred
thousand
years.
For example,
Texas
Gulf
coast beaches
(and their
buried
Tertiary
equivalents)
have
superb
sorting
values,
with a in the range
of 0.25-0.35~);
yet no one would
call this
rapidly
subsiding
geosynclinal
region
a “stable
shelf.”
The reason
for that is that the
geologic
processes
of sorting
and winnowing
take place
almost
instantaneously
when
compared
with
the geologic
time
scale-sands can be sorted
pretty
well,
and clay
any long period
of
removed,
by a few swishes of a miner’s
pan ! Thus it does not require
crustal
stability
to produce
well-winnowed
or well-sorted
sediments.

106

The role of tectonic
stability
in producing
supermature
sediments
is less clear.
Certainly
those
times
in earth’s
history
that
were
characterized
by very
stable
and
quiescent
conditions
(upper
Cambrian,
Ordovician,
and Cretaceous
for example)
have
produced
abundant
supermature
sediments;
and relatively
stable
areas of the earth’s
crust
have produced
supermature
sediments
throughout
much of geologic
time (Canadian and Australian
shield
sediments,
for example).
But contrary
evidence
shows that
supermature
sands can be produced
in one cycle, and in very brief
geologic
time if the
environment
is potent
enough.
This happens
in the Ellenburger
of West Texas,
where
beds of supermature
sand alternate
repeatedly
with
angular
sands of the same grain
size, all coming
from
the same primary
granitic-gneissic
source
area.
The identical
thing
happens
in the Silurian
of West Virginia,
where
quartz
sands from
the same
metamorphic
and vein source may be very well rounded
in one bed and subangular
in a
bed two feet higher.
If periods
of tectonic
stability
are called
upon to explain
these
sequences,
then those “stable”
periods
must
have
lasted
only a small
fraction
of a
gologic
period.
In the opinion
of this writer,
then, these rapid alternations
are caused by
shifts
in environment
(beach
or dune vs. fluvial
or neritic,
for example)
and do not
require
any prolonged
stability
of the crust.
They probably
would not form
in a period
of such rapid shoreline
shifts
as we have had in the Pleistocene
or Recent
(since very
little
rounding
of sand-size
grains
is going on in present
U.S. ocean beaches),
but might
be formed
during
non-glacial
times
in places
where
the environment
was right.
The
beach-dune
environment
would
have
to be relatively
stationary
at one place (or else
sweep
through
the same spot repeatedly)
in order
to produce
high rounding,
but the
point is that it need not be stabilized
for more than a fraction
of a geologic
period.
Although
the environment
of deposition
is apparently
the immediate
controlling
factor
in textural
maturity,
the tectonic
framework
exercises
an indirect
control
by
determining
which
environments
shall be volumetrically
dominant
and which
environments shall be rare in a given
region
or stratigraphic
section.
As Krynine
has shown,
the degree
and type of tectonic
activity
does determine
a certain
preferred
(but not
necessary)
association
of source
area lithology,
relief,
geomorphic
processes,
and rate
of subsidence
of the depositional
basin.
These
factors
in turn
integrate
to produce
preferred
associations
of environments,
because
the rate of influx
of detritus
into a
basin, combined
with the rate of subsidence
of that basin, determines
the quantitative
distribution
of the environments,
e.g., proportion
of continental
to marine
facies,
or
relative
importance
of deltaic
vs. each sediments.
And these environments
in turn
control
the textural
maturity.
For example,
in a tectonically
active
geosynclinal
area
sediment
deposition
is rapid
with
buildup
of extensive
floodplains,
aggrading
river
channels,
large deltas,
and thick masses of neritic
sediments,
possibly
in part deposited
by turbidity
flows
and submarine
mudslides.
In such a tectonic
framework,
immature
sediments
will dominate
because
of the prevalence
of low-maturity
environments
in the
region.
But local beaches
in this complex,
although
volumetrically
minor,
may contain
extremely
well-sorted
sediments
of high maturity,
and some of the river
channel
and
shallow
neritic
sediments
may be pretty
well
sorted.
When intense
block-faulting
occurs
in the continental
interior
(e.g., Basin and Range
province),
very
rapid erosion
and presence
of abrupt
scarps
leads to the production
of immense
thicknesses
of
continental
sediments,
huge alluvial
fans, mudflows,
bahadas,
bolson
fill,
and fluvial
sediments.
As a whole then, these deposits
will be of low maturity,
but occasional
river
channel
sands or lake beaches
(e.g., Lake Bonneville)
may be quite
well sorted.
In a
tectonically
stable
shield area, the shoreline
transgresses
and regresses
over large areas
because
of the flat topography,
while subsidence
is very slow and little
sediment
influx
occurs.
Thus most of the sediments
are beach (or dune) deposits,
and fluvial
sands have
only a temporary
existence
because
they
are destroyed
and reworked
by the next
marine
transgression.
The beach sands are packed
one against
the other
by shoreline
shifts,
to produce
a wide sheet of highly
matured
sand.
But neritic
sediments
(and

107

occasionally-preserved
fluvial
or neritic

fluvial
sediments)
may be just as clayey and poorly
sorted
sediments
produced
in the other more active
tectonic
frameworks.

as the

Thus
grandiose
tectonic
conclusions
should
not be drawn
from
one or a few
samples,
unless it can be shown that they are typical
of a large stratigraphic
interval.
A single
bed of very
well-sorted
sand may represent
a beach,
but one cannot
jump
immediately
and conclude
that
the
beach
sand
formed
in a tectonically
stable
framework;
it may be just a local beach in a great
mass of deltaic
sediments
formed
in
a violently
subsiding
geosyncline.
The decision
on what
type of tectonism
is represented
has to be made by examining
the quantitative
distribution
of environments
over
a large
stratigraphic
interval,
and integrating
this with
other
rock features
such as
mineralogy,
thickness
distributions,
and gross stratigraphy.
Thus,
the textural
maturity
of sandstones
is dependent
on environment,
but
volumetric
importance
of specific
environments
is determined
by tectonic
activity.
The mineral
composition
of sandstones
is controlled
by source area lithology,
and this in
turn
is also affected
by tectonism
(Krynine).
Consequently
both properties
interact,
although
they show a considerable
degree
of independent
variation.
Their
interaction
produces
what may be called
a “main
sequence”
of sandstone
types:
most immature
rocks, usually
formed
during
periods
of crustal
unrest,
are rich in unstable
constituents
like metamorphic
rock fragments,
micas,
and feldspars,
hence
are usually
arkoses
or
litharenites.
Most supermature
rocks, formed
during
periods
of crustal
stability,
have
suffered
enough
abrasion
or weathering
to remove
the unstable
constituents,
and the
only thing that remains
is quartz;
thus they are usually
quartzarenites.
Sublitharenites
and subarkoses
frequently
represent
transitional
stages
of maturity
and mineralogy.
There
are many exceptions
to the main sequence,
however,
which
are very important
to
recognize
as they represent
unusual
conditions
of climate
or depositional
environment.
ivlature
litharenite,
supermature
sublitharenites,
immature
and submature
orthoquartzites, and mature
and supermature
arkoses
are quite
common
examples
falling
off the
main sequence.
Any mineral
composition
can occur
in any stage of textural
maturity,
but certain
conditions
are preferred
in nature.

Krynine’s

Theory

of the Tectonic

Control

of Sandstone

Properties

M. S. Shvetsov,
in the 1920’s, was apparently
the first
one to realize
that pure
quartz
sandstones
are characteristic
of stable
shelf
areas
and quiescent
continental
shields,
or kratons;
and that
sandstones
in erogenic
areas
are much
more
complex
mineralogically--either
arkoses
(rich in feldspar),
graywackes
(rich in rock fragments)
or tuff ites (rich
in volcanics).
But Krynine
went
further
and about
1940 set up his
system,
a three-stage
scheme
for linking
the tectonic
development
of a continent
with
deposition
of specific
mineralogical
sandstone
types.
These
were,
in chronological
order;
(I) Quiescence
or Peneplanation
Stage,
resulting
in “quartzite”;
(II) Moderate
Deformation
or Geosynclinal

Under
quiescent
tectonic
conditions
the top layer of the crust (sedimentary
layer)
furnishes
the detritus.
Furthermore,
under
quiescent
conditions,
intensely
matured
beach and dune sediments
dominate
the stratigraphic
section.
For both these reasons,
then, the resultant
sediments
will consist
largely
of quartz
(with or without
chert),
i.e.,
they will be quartzarenites.
If quiescence
is prolonged,
erosion
may eat down to the
granitic
layer, and some feldspar
may enter the sediment.
Under
orthogeosynclinal
deformation,
tectonic
activity
buckles
the metamorphic
layer up to provide
a source
area.
Intense
folding,
thrusting,
and dominant
horizontal
tectonic
movements
actually
create
low-rank
metamorphic
rocks
like
slates
and
phyllites
out of the folded
sediments.
Because
of high relief
and rapid
erosion,
the
dominant
environments
are those
where
rapid
sediment
dumping
takes
place,
i.e.,
fluvial
planes,
deltas
and neritic
shelves.
Thus sands are rich in metamorphic
rock
fragments
and are not well sorted;
hence,
they will be graywackes
(now,
1966, termed
“Phyllarenites”).
Fold mountains
(Alps, Pyrenees,
Slovak
Carpathians)
contain
abundant
phyllarenites.
If violent
tectonic
movements
of a dominantly
vertical
nature
occur,
as in block
faulting
following
a period
of folding,
the deepest
layer of the crust,
granite
and gneiss,
is raised
to the surface
to provide
a source area.
Environments
again are those of rapid
deposition,
i.e. fluvial
plains
and alluvial
fans.
Sediments
consequently
are rich in
feldspar,
therefore
are arkoses.
Krynine’s
theory
is vastly
oversimplified
and idealistic,
nevertheless
it works
rather
well in many areas and is an excellent
guide
to stratigraphic
thinking.
Its big
imperfection--and
no model
is ever perfect
--is that it ignores
the important
part played
by the past history
of a region,
which
is a large “chance”
variable
thrown
into the ideal
tectonic
scheme.
For
example,
consider
an area
that
was in some
past age a
geosyncline
filled
largely
with shale and that later became
orogenized
and converted
to
low-rank
metamorphics.
If such an area is block-faulted,
the pile of metamorphics
would
be so immense
that
MRF-sandstones
(graywackes
of PDK)
would
be deposited
instead
of, as theory
proposes,
arkoses.
Related
to this is the absence
of any place in the scheme
for sedimentary
deposits
resulting
from
simple
rejuvenation
(without
differential
deformation)
of an old source
(of whatever
Iithology).
Another
weak point is the very minor
role assigned
to volcanic
sediments.
In view
of these
relatively
minor
shortcomings
to what
is basically
a sound
organized
scheme,
the following
“New Gospel”
(conceived
in fall,
1965) is propounded
as
a modification
of Krynine’s
scheme and to take into account
these difficulties.

A Concinnity

of Depositional

Regions

To understand
the relation
between
tectonics
and sandstone
types, one must first
consider
gross continental
architecture.
The following
scheme
is a development
of the
work of Stille,
Knopf,
Kay, Krynine,
Krumbein-Sloss,
and others.
For the record,
terms
originated
by myself
are shown thus (*).
In its early
stages,
a continent
may consist
of a stable
kraton
(typically
mostly
granite
or gneiss or high-grade
metamorphics),
surrounded
in part by subsiding
regions
of sedimentation
(geosynclines)
with outlying
welts
serving
as most active
sources
of
detritus;
most detritus
moves centripetally,
from the outlying
welts towards
the kraton.

Tectonics

The concept
of mobile
oceanic
crust,
colliding
and splitting
continents
and plate
tectonics
has wreaked
great changes in ideas of geosynclines
and classical
“sedimentary
tectonics”
as championed
by the workers
of the pre- 1960 period.
However,
one should
not be defeatist
and say “let’s
throw
out all this
garbage
on nomenclature
of
geosynclines,”
or “tectonics
has no relation
to sandstone
petrology.”
The two schemes
can be satisfactorily
inteqrated;
true it is not simple but the steak should not be thrown
out with the grease.
(See Dott; SEPM Sp. Publ. I9 and 1978 E. Sci. Rev.; and Dickinson,
SEPM Sp. Publ.
22).

Surely
we recognize
that there
are deep troughs
wherein
enormous
sections
of
sediments
accumulate,
and other areas that are stable with only thin undeformed
layers
of sediment.
And among the sediment-filled
troughs
there are many different
settings;
non-volcanic
vs. volcanic,
occurring
in different
positions
with respect
to continents,
plates, etc.
What
we see in a thin
section
of a sandstone
usually
is the endpoint
of an
incredibly
long chain of events
extending
back into the dimmest
geologic
past.
As we
trace causes back things get more and more hazy.
Nevertheless
it is worthwhile
to try
to trace this chain of events
as far back as we can, to as ultimate
a cause as possible.
Beginning
at the prime
source,
(I) convection
currents
in the mantle
presumably
cause
(2) movements
of crustal
plates.
These movements
produce
(3) zones of surface
rocks
having
different
types
of tectonic
activity--compression,
tension,
volcanism,
etc.
These in turn (4) become
different
types of source
terranes:
metamorphics,
granites,
andesi tes, etc.
These in turn (5) produce
different
types of sandstones
as modified
by
weathering
processes,
relief,
rate of erosion,
and differential
abrasion
or weathering
during
transport
and deposition
in various
environments.
For example,
plate converand folds,
and this often
gence
produces
horizontal
deformation
(Dh), e.g., thrusts
produces
metamorphic
rocks,
which
under
rapid
erosion,
ineffective
weathering
and
lack of abrasion
will
produce
fluvial
sediments
that
are phyllarenites,
or beach
sediments
that will be quartzarenites
with a lot of metamorphic
quartz.
As another
example,
plate separation
produces
vertical
deformation,
i.e., tension
and block faulting
and either
uplift
of plutonic
basement
(Dv) or granitic
intrusion,
thus common
granitic
sources,
hence alluvial
fans and arkoses.
These are ideal examples,
providing
the “main
sequence,”
or the “guiding
model.”
Mother
nature
is not that simple
and we have to
realize
that variations
exist because
of random
interfering
causes,
e.g., past geologic
history.

In deciphering
genesis of a sandstone,
we need to consider
at least five elemental
points.
These
are (I) tectonics
of the source
land,
which
controls
erosion
rate,
geomorphology,
etc.; (2) paleogeology
of the source terrane,
which controls
mineralogy;
(3) tectonics

(4)
depositional

which
controls
texture,

etc.; and (5)
degree of weathering
of the material,
which affects
mineralogy
and texture.
All are to
some degree
linked,
but the latter
two are more or less “accidental,”
while
the first
three are linked more closely
to the diastrophic
framework.
To serve as a shorthand,
or
at least
an outline
for meditation,
any sandstone
can be categorized
by a symbol
involving
all five aspects;
for example,
Dv.G/p/Cf(w),
or Qk.S/s/L(n).
If you don’t like

it can be written

Mineralogical

Classification

of Sandstones

The perfect
classification
of sandstones
does not now and never will exist.
Each
of the dozens of classifications
proposed
have reflected
the composer’s
personal
bias
and limited
experience.
The less one knows about a subject,
the easier it is to cook up a
logical
classification
that seems to have all problems
answered.
But no classification
can be developed
to answer
all purposes
and reflect
all local peculiarities.
Problems
of
classification
have been thoroughly
reviewed
by McBride
(I 964 JSP), Klein (I 963 GSA)
and Okada (I 97 I JG) while Huckenholz
(I 963 JSP) and Dott (I 964 JSP) have considered
in particular
the significance
of arkose and graywacke.
The first
English-language
attempt
to create
a quantitative,
comprehensive
and
geologically
meaningful
(as opposed
to a random)
Classification
of sandstones
was that
of P. D. Krynine,
who had developed
essentially
his complete
system
by about
1941,
taught
it starting
in 1943, and published
it in detail
in 1948 (JG).
His thinking
on
sandstone
classification
had apparently
been strongly
influenced
by that of his teacher
in Moscow,
Shevtsov
(see Folk and Ferm,
1966 JSP, for details
and citations).
Krynine
stressed
sandstone
mineralogy
as a powerful
indicator
of tectonics,
and drew quantitative lines between
five sandstone
types, expressing
composition
by triangular
diagrams
based on poles of (I) quartz
plus chert,
(2) feldspar
plus kaolin,
and (3) micas (including
MRF’s and matrix
together).
After
Fischer
(I 933), he was the first to express
sandstone
composition
by a triangular
diagram,
though
Pirsson’s
text used a ss-sh-Is
sedimentaryrock triangle
in I9 15. My own ideas on mineralogical
classification
of sandstones
were
strongly
influenced
by Krynine;
but ‘the realization
that an “arkose”
with 35% feldspar
could
have a very wide range
of textures
necessitated
some addition
to the strictly
mineralogical
terminology,
hence
the idea of adding
to the clan name
a scale of
textural
maturity
(I 9.5 I JSP).
The
five-fold,
textural
maturity/mineralogical
classification
used in previous
editions
of this book (1954-1965)
and published
by the writer
(1951 JSP, 1954 JG, 1956
JSP, 1960 JSP) was intended
to be objective
and descriptive,
but the end-members
of
the sacred
triangle
were
collected
in three
groups
thought
to be most indicative
of
provenance,
generally
following
Krynine’s
philosophy.
Hence
quartz
and chert
were
linked
at the Q-pole,
indicative
of prolonged
chemical/physical
attack
or else of
derivation
from
an older sedimentary
source terrane,
the end-member
rock type being
the ort hoquartzi
te.
All feldspars
and all plutonic
and volcanic
rock fragments
were
linked
together
at the F-pole,
indicative
of igneous
source,
the end-member
type being

Metamorphic
rock fragments,
micas,
and metaquartzite
fragments
were
linked
together
at the M-pole,
indicative
of metamorphic
source,
the end-member
rock
type being
the “graywacke”
(this is essentially
the composition
of the graywacke
of
Naumann,
I850 text).
Later
versions
added a fourth
pole for subaerially-eroded,
much
older
carbonate
rock fragments,
defining
a rock known
as a “calclithite”
with over 50
percent
CRF’s (I 959 AAPG).
Clays
were eliminated
from
the compositional
name (a
major departure
from the Krynine
system),
and placed
in the textural
part of the name.
Several
difficulties
arose
with
this scheme.
The division
between
“ordinary
quartz”
(Q-pole)
and “stretched
metaquartzite”
(M-pole)
is subjective,
difficult
enough
to determine
with the microscope
and certainly
impossible
in the field.
A dark-colored
sand grain might be a chert, a basalt fragment,
or a piece of slate, thus assignable
to QF-, or M-poles;
the distinction
is rarely
attainable
in the field
and is sometimes
hifficult
even with the microscope.
Chert
itself
shows a complete
gradation
into shale
and siltstone,
fine-grained
metaquartzite,
and silicified
volcanic
rock--and
it is
difficult
to define
these reproducibly.
The word “graywacke”
is encumbered
by so many
radically
differing
definitions
that it has been rendered
almost
useless.
Therefore,
after
much soul-searching,
the following
revised
and hopefully
more
workable
sandstone
classification
has been used by the writer
since spring
1966.
It is
hoped that those of us seriously
interested
in sandstone
classification
can, some decade,
all get together
and use some compromise
system,
so this classification
is tentative
and
subject
to change
should such a miracle
come to pass.
I have been strongly
influenced
in this change
of heart
by prolonged
discussions
with Earle
F. McBride,
Keith
A. W.
Crook,
and Harvey
Blatt;
many of their
ideas have been incorporated
into the new
revised
version.
This new system
has been now published
formally
[Folk Andrews
and
Lewis (I 970), New Zd. J. Geol. & Geoph.]
.
The main difference
between
this and my previous
classification
is the lumping
of
all rock fragments
(except
plutonic
ones, granite
and gneiss)
into the third
or “rockfragment”
pole of the triangle,
and the switching
of chert--which
is in reality
a rock
fragment--from
the Q-pole
to the RF-pole.
Van Andel
(I 958 AAPG)
also placed
chert
with rock fragments.
Unfortunately,
by putting
all rock fragments
regardless
of genesis
in one pole, the main triangle
loses almost
all its source-area
significance;
but splitting
the rock fragments
on the subordinate
RF triangle
restores
much of this loss. Lumping
of all rock fragments
together
to produce
a “rock-fragment
sandstone”--however
it
might
be named--was
essentially
the approach
used by Shvetsov
in the early
1930’s, and
he termed
the rock a “graywacke”;
this system
has been followed
by later
Russian
petrographer
(Shutov,
1965).
Later
workers
who used the same idea include
McElroy
(I 954 Austral,
J. Sci., petromictic
or lithic
sandstone):
Gilbert
(I 954 book);
Pettijohn
(1954 JG; I957 book);
Van Andel
(1958 AAPG);
Crook
(1960 A. J. Sci.); and MC Bride
(I 963 J. S. P.).
Splitting
of the rock fragments
by means of a subordinate
VRF/MRF/SRF
triangle
is my own idea, (though
Kossovskaya
used a RF triangle
with different
poles in 1962) as
are the names
“Calclithi
te” and “phyllarenite.”
The percentage
lines of the main
triangle
are almost
the same as those used by Crook
(I 960), and the name “Litharenite”
was coined
by McBride
(1963)
who shortened
it from
Gilbert’s
(1954)
term
“lithic
areni te.”
So much for the record
of how this scheme
developed--like
so much else, a
mass of borrowing.

The garbage-can
words “Litharenite,”
“Sublitharenite,”
etc. should only be

it is not possible

identify
the specific

The more exact terms “phyllarenite,”
“feldspathic

should
be used if at all possible.

of “Sublitharenite”
one can use “Subphyllarenite”

The unfortunate
characteristic
of this plot is that it is no longer

to show

of one dot on the main triangle

Of course,
two dots

one on the RF triangle)
do pretty
well indicate
provenance,
but this becomes
messy with a lot of samples.
The only way to indicate
provenance
satisfactorily
is by a separate
graph.
One good way to show this is by a star diagram,
such as this:

Opi ni on on Graywac
ke. Originally,
the term “graywacke”
was applied
to a hard,
dark,
semi-metamorphosed
sandstone
that
was rich
in mixed
rock
fragments
and
chloritic
clay matrix,
a type
of rock that
many now think
has been deposited
by
turbidity
currents,
and is often
somehow
metamorphosed.
Modern
workers
have each
seized
some one aspect
of the type
“graywacke”
and have
used it to define
their
particular
kind of “graywacke.”
One group
considered
the graywacke
to be a rockfragment
sandstone,
later
specifically
one
rich
in metamorphic
rock
fragments,
emphasizing
a source-area
approach
to the definition.
A second group
considered
the
graywacke
to be a clayey,
ill-sorted
sandstone
regardless
of mineralogy,
essentially
a
textural
approach.
A third
group
considered
the graywacke
to be characterized
by
those sedimentary
structures
thought
to be formed
by turbidites,
essentially
a depositi onal
environment
approach.
Others
insisted
that
it be dark,
dirty,
and highly
indurated
(a “know-nothing”
approach).
Because
of these vastly
different
usages, the
writer
now follows
McBride
(1962 and 1963 JSP) and has discarded
the term
“graywacke”
from
any seat
in a quantitative,
mineralogically-oriented
classification
of
sandstones.
It should
revert

Rocks

Feldspar,
the essential
mineral
of the arkose,
is comparatively
easily decomposed
by weat hering.
Therefore,
in order
for it to be abundantly
presented
in a sediment,
special
conditions
are required.
Either
(I) climatic
conditions
were too dry (or too cold)
to allow
much weathering,
and the feldspar
remained
largely
undecomposed,
or (2) the
source
area was uplifted
and eroded
so rapidly
that sufficient
time was not available
for
weathering
to be completed.
Type (I) is here designated
the climatic
arkose,
because
it
owes its high feldspar
content
to a dry or cool climate;
type (2) is the tectonic
arkose,
because
it owesits
feldspar
content
to a rapid
tectonic
uplift.
A third
type,
the
volcanic
or plagioclase-rich
arkose,
owes
its feldspathic
constituents
to volcanic
activity,
again a case of rapid deposition
short-circuiting
weathering.
Tectonic
Arkose
(Krynine),
often
Dv.G/p/CF(w).
If violent
vertical
deformation
and block-faulting
of the order
of several
thousand
to 20,000
feet take place,
granitic
or gneissic
basement
is characteristically
raised
to the surface.
This type of tectonism
is typically
associated
with
KA tectonics
(and aulacogens,
which
are incipient
KAK).
Continued
sporadic
movement
maintains
a rugged
topography,
into
which
vigorous
streams
carve
deep valleys.
Rapid
erosion
on steep slopes contributes
a huge load of
sediment,
which
quickly
piles
up as coarse
alluvial
fans passing
out into aggrading
fluvial
plains;
sediments
are very
thick
(thousands
of feet)
near the source,
but thin
rather
rapidly
outward
so that the form
of the seidmentary
body is that of a wedge.
Most of the described
examples
have formed
under a warm,
seasonally
humid climate,
but there is no reason why such an uplift
could not happen
in areas of dry climate
also.
Near
the source,
the alluvial
fan environment
dominates
so that sediments
are
quiet
coarse
(conglomerates
common)
and poorly
sorted
(clayey,
immature)
although
local stream
channels
may have better
sorted
sands.
Farther
from
the source, deposits
consist
of alternating
beds of river-channel
sand (which
may be mature
arkose,
i.e., well
sorted),
and immature
flood
plain
muds and muddy
sands with
little
or no gravel.
Composition
may range up to 50 percent
or more feldspar
(mainly
K-feldspar);
Krynine
has shown that because
of rugged
relief
combined
with humid climate,
some feldspar
is
eroded
from
fresh
granitic
bedrock
in the bottoms
or sides of vigorous
down-cutting
stream
channels,
and other
feldspar
is eroded
from
interfluves
where
it has had a
chance
to be thoroughly
weathered
in the soil mantle.
Thus the diagnostic
marker
of
the tectonic
arkose
is a mixture
of fresh
plus badly
weathered
feldspars
of the same
species.
The remainder
of the rock consists
largely
of quartz;
clay (often
kaolinitic
or
bauxitic)
is abundant
either
as a matrix
to the immature
sands
or as abundant
intercalated
shale beds; it is provided
by the thick
intensely
weathered
soils.
Heavy
minerals
are abundant
and of unstable
types, such as hornblende,
garnet,
pyroxene,
etc.
Cements
are not common
because
sands are often
clogged
with clay matrix

U n d er some situations

Such may happen
either
to areas that have been stable for a very long time (e.g., Canadian

or to
areas
that have been uplifted,
undergone
deep erosion,
and then were planed
down on
cessation
of uplift.
If the climate

the feldspar

because
of the slow rate of erosion

and quartzarenites
will result.
But if the climate

little

Feldspar
is eliminated
by abrasion
alone,
because
of its
inferior
hardness.
Because
of tectonic
quiescence
and low topography,
beaches
and
dunes comprise
the bulk of the sedimentary
environments.
No areas are subsiding
or
being uplifted
greatly,
consequently,
a sheet of sand is spread
smoothly
and evenly
by
broadly
transgressive
or regressive
seas; the very
slow
influx
of detritus
permits
uniform
spreading
of the sediment.
Thus sands are of the blanket
type.

type of
climatic
“arkose”
is really a subarkose)
or even into
quartzarenites.

Arkose

Arkose,
often
X.X/b/C.
One type of plagioclase
arkose
(that eroded
from
a basic pluton)
has already
been discussed.
Most plagioclase
arkoses
and subarkoses,
however,
are
formed
when
volcanic
activity
contributes
material
to rapidly
depositing
sediments.
Deposition
must be rapid because
of the very
unstable
nature
of basic volcanic
materials.
If the volcanic
materials
are chiefly
bits of
aphanitic
ground-mass,
then the term “volcanic-arenite”
(or, if specific
identification
is
possible,
“andesi te-areni
te,” “rhyol i te-areni
te, ” “basalt
arenitic,”
etc.) should be used; if

133

it is chiefly
plagioclase,
use “plagioclase-arenite”
as the clan name.
These rocks imply
unstable
tectonic
conditions
and rapid
deposition
of volcanic
materials
plus other
diluting
terrigenous
detritus
in fans, floodplains
and river
channels;
hence maturity
is
immature
to mature.
Grain size varies
from conglomerates
to silts.
Volcanic
biotite
is
a common
accessory
as is apatite,
together
with basaltic
hornblende
and other
more
common
ferromagnesians.
Sometimes
these constitutents
may be so abundant
that the
rock can be called
“hornblende-arenite,”
etc.
Clays
may be chloritic
or montmorillonitic,
occasionally
grown
as authigenic
fringes;
a chloritic
matrix
is very common
if
the rock fragments
are basic.
Cements,
if any, are usually
calcite,
opal or zeolite.
Volcanic-arenites
are usually
dark colored
in the field
(if derived
from
andesites,
or
basal ts); plagioclase-arenites
are light
gray.
If volcanic
glass is a major
component
(implying
a siliceous
magma),
the rock may be classed
as a “vitric-arenite”;
these rocks
are
light
gray
and,
on the Texas
Gulf
coast,
contain
much

(Callender).

Rocks

Metamorphic
rock fragments,
the chief
essential
constituent
of the phyllarenite,
are soft
and quite
susceptible
to abrasion.
Therefore
their
abundance
in sand
(consequently
theclan
designation--phylIareni
te vs. subphyllareni
te vs. quartzareni
te)
varies
quite
enormously,
with
environment
of deposition,
distance
from
source,
and
tectonic
activity.
The former
term
for this sandstone
type was “graywacke,”
now
abandoned
as completely
prostituted.
The term
“phyllarenite,”
coined
in 1965, was
suggested
by an older term,
“schist-arenite”
as used by Knopf
in the 1930’s.
“Phyllarenite”
implies
that
the major
constituents
are foliated
metamorphic
rock fragments:
slate, phyllite
and schist.
Krynine
(unpublished
notes) divided
his “graywackes”
into “Drowned

(mioand eugeosynclinal)
and “Floating

with
detritus
derived
from
a welt
beyond
the margin
and moving
dominantly
inward,
toward
the kraton
(as in the Appalachian
geosyncline).
Near the
continent,
the geosyncline
subsides
less rapidly
(miogeosyncline)
to produce
“normal”
phyllarenites
lacking
feldspar,
while
the outer
geosyncline
subsides
more rapidly
and
also receives
volcanic
contributions
(eugeosyncline
of Stille)
to produce
rocks
that
range
widely
in composition
from

to volcanic-arenite
to plagioclaseareni te.
Rejuvenation
Phyllarenites
can be produced
any place;
an ancient
metamorphic terrane
is simply
uplifted
(without
further
squashing)
to produce
a rejuvenated

area, and they need have no connection
at all with
orthogeosynclines.
A fine
example
(first
pointed
out
by H. Blatt)
is the southern
Appalachians,
an area
metamorphosed
in the Paleozoic
but which
provided
a flood
of Rejuvenation

all the way to Texas

Furthermore,
uplift
attendant
on the rise of the welt brings deeper
crustal
areas to the surface,
and some
intrusion
and volcanism
may occur.
But dominantly
the source
area consists
of lowrank metamorphic
rocks, carved
into considerable
relief
as it is continually
deformed
and raised.
The resulting
great
flood
of detritus
is dumped
rapidly
in a series
of
coalescing
alluvial
fans, flood plains,
river
channels,
large and small deltas,
coastal
loci
such as beaches,
swamps,
lagoons,
and estuaries,
and neritic
environments.
Since this
type of deformation
produces
linear
welts,
sediments
accumulate
in a linear
trough
which
may be quite
thick in the middle
and thins to both sides.
Climatic
evidence
is
difficult
to obtain,
but it seems likely that a rugged
welt surrounded
on all sides by seas
would usually
have considerable
rainfall.
Because
of the softness
of the slate
and phyllite
fragments,
environment
of
deposition
has a tremendous
influence
on the composition
of the phyllarenite.
Near the

although
mature
phyllarenites
are common
in high-energy
loci such as river
channels.
Rapid
abrasion
of slate and
phyllite
fragments
produces
great volumes
of clay-mica
mush, which
are winnowed
out
of the sands to produce
thick shale section.
At intermediate
distances
from the source,
environment
plays the strongest
role;
beach
sands (although
not abundant
in such a
rapidly
subsiding
basin) may have lost all their
soft MRF’s
and contain
only stretched
rnetaquartzite
as a reminder
of their origin;
some of these may pass into quartzarenites
or supermature
subphyllarenites
if a brief period
of quiescence
stabilizes
the beach line.
But fluvial
sands
at the very
same
distance
from
the source
may
still
contain
considerable
MRF’s,
and floodplain
or deltaic
sediments
may be extremely
rich in them.

consist
chiefly
of shales (marine,

Variants
are common.
It has already
been mentioned
that under more-than-usual
abrasion,
subphyllarenite
or quartzarenites
develop
with
few MRF’s
and some metaquartzite
grains;
in hand specimen
these
look like clean,
white,
well-sorted
quartz
sandstones
but they may contain
a few scattered
black or white
specks.
These
rocks
may occur either
far from the source area or along local, temporary
strand
lines nearer
the source.
During
brief periods
of quiescence
which occasionally
interrupt
geosynclinal
subsidence,
such sands may spread
as blankets
entirely
across
the basin;
frequently
these
sands
are supermature,
and although
usually
classifiable
as subphyllarenites,
intensive
abrasion
may make them pass into quartzarenites.
Often
these sands contain
pebbles
of vein
quartz
or metal
quartzite.
Continental
deposition
under
a humid
climate
in the source
area may produce
red phyllarenites,
developed
if uplift
overbalances the rate of subsidence
so that detritus
spills into the basin faster
than sinking
can
take care of it, and a great delta (exogeosyncline)
is built up. Uplift
or erosion
may be
so great
(especially,
late in the history

that higher-rank
metamorphics

Petrology

of Quartzareni

tes

Krynine’s
original
scheme
of the 1940’s used the term “quartzite”
for sandstones
made of quartz
f chert;
as this was confused
with metamorphic
rock, Pettijohn
(I 949)
used instead
“orthoquartzite”
(this term
was apparently
coined
by Tieje
(I 921, JG).
Even
so, this still
misled
the average
geologist
into
thinking
metamorphically,
so
gradually
the term
quartzarenite
(Gilbert;
McBride)
has superceded
it.
Though
less
euphonious
and longer,
it will be used throughout
this book.
Quartzarenites
originate
in diverse
ways, but their
high degreee
of purity
usually
requires
a long period
of abrasion
and/or
weathering
to remove
the less stable feldspar,
metamorphic
rock fragments,
etc.
Quartzarenites
may be developed
directly
from
a
granite
or granitic
gneiss
under
humid
conditions
if tectonic
stability
is sufficiently
prolonged
(say of the order
of one-fourth
to one-eighth
of a geologic
period).
If the
climate
is arid,
however,
a quartzarenite
may be made directly
from
a granite
only
under
an exceptional
and very
prolonged
period
of tectonic
stability
coupled
with
intensive
beach
and dune action,
because
the feldspar
must be removed
by abrasion
alone,
unassisted
by much
chemical
decay.
Quartzarenites
may
be derived
from
metamorphic
sources,
but this also requires
rather
prolonged
stability
(a fraction
of a
geologic
period)
to remove
all the metamorphic
rock fragments.
Some are made largely
of vein quartz;
these also require
prolonged
abrasion.
If the source
area consists
of
older sediments,
however,
a quartzarenite
may be developed
very rapidly
because
the
source
material
is already
quite enriched
in quartz.
Hence quartzarenites
derived
from
reworked
sediments
require
no period
of stability,
in fact
many of them
are erogenic
sediments.

the area.
Under
such stable
conditions
the source
area is worn down to a peneplane;
influx
of detritus
is slowed
very
markedly,
so that winds,
waves
and currents
are able to do their
work thoroughly
on
each grain.
Consequently
these sediments
are practically
always
supermature
and show
extreme
roundness.
Because
detritus
is contributed
very slowly,
and because
no part of
the depositional
area is going down rapidly,
the mild epeirogenic
warpings
and continual
transgressions
and regressions
of the sea spread the deposits
out into a thin blanket
of a
large
area; sheets
of sand 100-200
feet thick
may cover
10,000 square
miles.
These
sheets
are made
up of coalescing
beaches
and dune sands reworked
into beaches
or
peritidal
and shallow
marine
sands.
The humid
climate,
given such a long time in which
to work on the parent
material
in the deep soils of the source
area, destroys
all the
feldspar.
Hence this rock type consists
entirely
of quartz,
almost
all “common”
quartz.
If the source
is deep within
a batholith,
there is very little
vein quartz.
Of course
there
is no chert
and little
metamorphic
quartz.
The only heavy
minerals
that can stand this
prolonged
abrasion
are the ultra-stable
tourmaline
and zircon.
The grain size is medium
to fine sand (the typical
size of beaches
and dunes), and there
is no silt or clay; gravel
is
rare, occurring
only near the base.
Quartz
overgrowths
are perhaps
the most common
cement,
but carbonates
are common
and many of these rocks (even older Paleozoic
ones)
are uncemented.

is very commonly
white,

Vein Quartz
Source.
Many areas of soft,
low-rank

rock are shot
through
with abundant
quartz
veins.
If such areas are eroded
under quiescent
tectonic

the beach-dune
activity
is sufficient
to wear away the soft MRF’s
so that
about the only resistant
particles
left are the sand grains
and pebbles
composed
of vein
quartz,
recognized
by their
richness
in bubbles.
This is an uncommon
rock type, but
there are a few conspicuous
examples.
Older Sedimentary
Source.
Since no period
of tectonic
stability
and no period
of
beach-dune
action
is required
to attain
a quartzarenite
by reworking
older,
already
quartz-rich
sediments,
these can form
under any tectonic
framework
and almost
any
environment.
Some are erogenic
sediments,
deposited
in thick wedges
and eroded
from

of older sandstones,
mudrocks,
and limestones;
some develop
on
gentle

of a large area blanketed
by older sedimentary
rocks, hence form
blanket

Petrology

of Calclithites,

typically

D. Sc/p/Cf(n).

Calclithites
are terrigenous
rocks of the Litharenite
group,
in which
carbonate
rock fragments
dominate;
often
they contain
over
50 percent
carbonate
fragments,
obtained
by erosion
of limestones
or dolomites
outcropping
in a source
land.
The source
rocks are usually
(though
not necessarily)
much older than the calclithite
itself;
thus the
Miocene
Oakville

of Texas consists
of grains
of Cretaceous
limestone;
some
Triassic
beds in New
Mexico
consist
of pebbles
of Pennsylvanian
Carbonate
rock;
Pennsylvanian
conglomerates
in Oklahoma
consist
of Ordovician
limestone
pebbles.
Hence these are to be distinguished
from intrasparite
limestones,
which are made up of
a penecontemporaneous
intraclasts
torn up from the basin of depositon
itself.
Calclithites
are terrigenous
rocks like arkoses,
graywackes,
or orthoquartzites;
it is indefensible
to consider
them
as limestones
although
they
have
the
composition
of a
limestone--it
would
be just as bad as calling
an arkose a “granite”
because
they both
contain
quartz
and feldspar.
In order
for a rock to be made largely
of a constituent
so soft and so soluble
as
limestone,
the rate of erosion
must have greatly
overbalanced
the rate of chemical
decay.
Hence these rocks are exactly
like arkoses,
whose unstable
and soft feldspar
can
be preserved
only by rapid erosion or a dry (or cold) climate.
Therefore
calclithites
also
form chiefly
in areas of intense
faulting,
but where the sedimentary
cover is so thick or
faulting
is not of enough
magnitude
to get down to the granitic
basement
rock.
It is
possible
that some calclithites
are the result
of a cold or arid climate

these also require

The source
area of calclithites
must have had rugged
relief,
and the deposits
are
laid down in alluvial

(like the tectonic
arkoses).
Contemporaneous
faulting
within
a carbonate
basin may produce
marine
calclithites
and some
calclithites
are turbidites
(McBride).
Maturity
is variable,
and conglomerates
are very
frequent;
in fact
it appears
that most calclithites
are conglomerates.
Consequently
deposits
accumulate

rapidly

Most
calclithites

Chert-arenites

irregular

in some shales.
Burrows
of animals
riddle
many specimens
of
shale, and some contain
clay fecal pellets.
In most clays, the clay minerals
are oriented
so that the flakes
lie parallel
with
the bedding.
Orientation
occurs
in clays ranging
in age from
Cambrian
to Pleistocene;
in depth of burial
from tens of thousands
of feet to a few tens of feet.
Therefore
it is
not a diagenetic
feature
that requires
great
pressures
or geological
age, rather
it forms
upon original
deposition
of the clay.
Some claystones
have randomly
oriented
clay
minerasl;
these also may be of any age or depth
of burial.
The factors
that cause
orientation
are not now known,
but organic
burrowing
is probably
the chief cause of unoriented
clays.
For a claystone
to be fissile
requires
that all the following
conditions
be satisfied:
(I) the rock must contain
little
silt or sand; (2) the rock must show even
bedding
undisturbed
by slumping
or burrowing
organisms;
(3) it must
contain
little
or no
chemical
cement;
(4) the clays must be well oriented.
If any one of these conditions
is
not satisfied,
the clay will not be fissile.
Yet sometimes
one obtains
a well-bedded,
“pure”
claystone,
lacking
in cement
and with
oriented
clays that
still
is not fissile
despite
the fact that it fulfills
all above
requirements.
The presence
of mica or very
thin laminae
of fine silt is an aid to fissility.

using the following
outline,

For each of the properties,
for each of the minerals,
ask yourself
why this is so; for example,
if zircon
is smaller
than quartz
and
more angular,
and tends to be placered
into streaks,
you reason
that it is smaller
and placered
because
it has a higher
density;
also it is more angular
than quartz
because
it is harder.
A great
amount
of valuable
information
can be unearthed
if you will
continually
ask yourself
why;
it will
stimulate
you to look for
clues that otherwise
might
be completely
missed.

nomenclature.
Much
more
information
is communicated
if we say “Spirifer
mucronatus”
rather
than “brachiopod”
or simply
“fossil”
as was done
in the
17th century.
Describing
an igneous
rock as “phanerite”
or “trap
rock”
long ago passed out of style,
and we now use such terms
as “pink,
fine-grained
hornblende
quartz
monzonite.”
Unfortunately,
primitive
and simple
(thereby
meaningless)
terminology
still
prevails
among
geologists
for
sedimentary
rocks,
and most
stratigraphic
sections
are
still
described
simply
as sandstone,
shale, or limestone.
To do this is to gloss over
the
tremendous
variation
which
occurs
in these
rocks,
and to obscure
stratigraphic
and
regional
changes,
most
of which
would
become
of obvious
importance
if proper
terminology
were
in use.
How far would
geologic
work
in igneous
and metamorphic
areas progress
if areas and sections
were described
as covered
with outcrops
of “fine,
pink rock,”
” course
rock,”
or “crystalline
rock” as is now done with sediments?
The more information
a term communicates,
the longer
it must become.
A term
including
all the important
information
about a sandstone,
then, is bound to be lengthy
because
there
are so many
important
ways
in which
sandstones
can vary.
Five
sandstone
properties
are held to be important
enough
to be included
in the rock name:
the grain-size
name,
the chemical
cements,
the textural
maturity,
the miscellaneous
transported
constituents,
and the clan designation.
I.
The grain-size
name
is the most obvious
property
to many geologists,
and
often
is the only description
given
to a sandstone.
First
determine
the percentage
of
gravel
(grains
larger
than
2 mm) if posible
from
a hand specimen
because
the thin
section
is too small in area to give a representative
sample
of the gravel
content.
Then
estimate
the median
size of the gravel
fraction
alone.
From this point on, the process
is the same whether
the rock contains
any gravel
or not.
Estimate
the ratio of sand to
mud (silt plus clay).
This can be easily done by selecting
a detrital
grain
.062 mm in
diameter
and placing
it under the cross-hairs
to use as a standard
for comparison,
then
estimating
what
proportion
of the rock consists
of grains
larger
than
this.
Next,
estimate
the median
size of the sand fraction,
alone.
Finally,
estimate
the ratio of silt
vs. clay matrix
and name according
to the triangle
on page 28.
2.
The chemically-precipi.tated
cements
offer
important
clues to the chemical
conditions
prevailing
when
the
rock
was
deposited
or afterward.
Clay
is not
considered
as a cement,
but as a detrital
matrix.
If one considers
clay as a cement,
he
gets into difficulties
with the shales which
then become
entirely
“cement.”
Only the
prominent
cements
(usually
one, almost
never
more than two) are included
in the fivefold name.
Wherever
there
is a possibility
of confusion
in that
one mineral
can be
present
in a sandstone
either
as a cement
or as a transported
constituent,
use the
construction
“-cemented”
as opposed
to “-bearing”.
The following
usage is suggested:
Quartz:
If the rock is so tightly
cemented
with abundant
quartz
overgrowths
that
no pore space is left (and the rock consequently
breaks through
the grains),
use “highly
si I iceous.”
If there
are only a few small
overgrowths,
use “slightly
siliceous.”
Most
rocks may be called
simply “siliceous.”
Chert:
“Chert-cemented”
(not “cherty”
because
this could

The Clan
designation
(arkose,

etc. analogous
to
5.
granite
or quartz
diorite
in igneous
rocks) is the most important
as it indicates
the bulk
mineral
composition.
Mineralogy
depends
chiefly
on source
area Iithology,
a factor
which
stays relatively
constant
for long periods
of time and consequently
is the most
characteristic
feature
of a sandstone
format
ion. It is a more dependable
property
than
the other
parts of the name, which
tend to fluctuate
more rapidly.
The clan name is
determined
as shown previously
by using the composition
triangles.
Order

of terms
No order
is inherently
more
sacred
than
any other;
however,
it facilitates
comparison
of samples
if the same order
is followed
by everyone.
As in igneous
or
metamorphic
rocks the most important
part of the name,
the clan designation,
should
come last.
Grain

that
is used by all

should

with the term
mudstone
coming

or calcitic

mudstone).
Both
of the above
can
usually
be easily related
to one of the terrigenous

omit the

and follow
the pattern

Disregarding
admixture
of terrigenous
sand, silt, and clay, there
are three
basic components
of limestone:
(I) microcrystalline
calcite
ooze, (2) sparry
calcite,
usually
a cement,
and (3) allochems.
These are, in most limestones,
analogous
with the clay matrix,
chemical
cement
and sand grains of a sandstone.

(probably
the situation

Most mud today comes from
disintegration
of organisms,
mainly
green algae,
into constituent
crystallites.
Some mud also is windblown
dust, can come
from abrasion
of shells, or may be precipitated
by algae, bacteria,
etc.
The origin
can

be deciphered
by study with electron

Carbonate
mud today forms

as in the Bahamas,

Lithified
ooze, or micrite,
is the
main constituent
of the “lithographic”
limestones.
(2)
Sparry
calcite
forms
crystals
generally
over
IO microns
in diameter,
and is
distinguished
from
micrite
by its clarity
as well as coarser
crystal
size, which
may
range up to I mm or more.
This type of calcite
usually occurs as a pore-filling
cement;
pores are often
lined first by fibrous
calcite,
with equant
mosaic
calcite
filling
the final
spaces.
In modern
sediments,
the first
fibrous
coating
is usually
aragonite
or magnesium-calcite,
but in older
limestones

Some sparry

is the result
of recrystallization
of micrite;

Allochemical
constituents
(allos:
differentiation
from
the normal)
are those
components
that have formed
by chemical
precipitation
within
the basin of deposition,
but which
for the most part have suffered
some later
transport;
or, if they have not
been transported,
they include
such organized
aggregates
as sedentary
fossils
or fecal
pellets
differentiated
from
“normal”
chemical
precipitates
as one usually
thinks
of
them.
Only four types of allochems
are of importance:
intraclasts,
oolites,
fossils,
and
pel I ets.
( I)
lntraclasts
represent
pieces of penecontemporaneous,
usually
weakly
consolidated
carbonate
sediment
that have been torn up and redeposited
by currents
(hence
the term
intraclast,
signifying
that they have been broken
from within
the formation).
lntraclasts
vary from
fine sand size up to pebble
or boulder
size, as in the familiar
limestone
conglomerates.
lntraclasts
themselves
may consist of any kind of limestone,
micrite,
biomicrite,
intrasparite,
pelsparite,
etc. (see later).
They indicate
a tearing-up
of the bottom
by an increase
in current
velocity
(such as in storms),
lowering
of wave
base by partial
emergence,
or possible
tectonic
instability
of the basin of deposition.
Rare intraclasts
form
by accretion,
analogous
to lumps in a sugar bowl, and are then
transported.
Of such nature
are the “grapestone”
aggregates
of fecal
(?) pellets
in the
Bahamas
(III ing).
They may also form
in the wave-attacked
margins
of broad areas
where ooze is being precipitated,
or upon tidal and supratidal
flats.
(2)
Oolites
range from
0.1 - 1.0 mm in diameter,
and show radial
or concentric
structure.
They usually
form
around
a nucleus,
often
a small
fossil
fragment,
fecal
pellet,
or quartz
grain.
They form
in loci of vigorous
and continuous
current
or wave
action,
in places where
aragonite
is being rather
rapidly
precipitated.
An individual
oolite
may go through
several
cycles
of abrasion
alternating
with
growth.
In the
Bahamas
(Illing)
oolites
form
in current-swept
tidal channels
or form

are powerful.

that some may form

Rock Classification.
Almost
all carbonate
rocks contain
more than one type of
material;
one may be a mixture
of oolites,
fossils
and sparry
calcite
cement
while
another
may consist
of quartz
silt, pellets,
and microcrystalline
ooze partially
replaced
by dolomite
and chert.
Thus the problem
of classification
becomes
one in systematizing
these variations
of composition
and drawing
significant
limits
between
types.
Carbonate rocks are so complex
that it is usually
necessary
to make a thin section
study in
order
to pigeon-hole
a specimen
properly,
although
good estimates
can be made in the
field or with an etched specimen.
Disregarding
for a moment
the content
of terrigenous
material,
base a practical
limestone
classification
on the relative
proportions
members
(I) allochems,
(2) microcrystalline
ooze, and (3) sparry calcite

I57

it is possible
to
of three
endcement.

Allochems
represent
the framework
of the rock:
the shells,
oolites,
carbonate
pebbles
or pellets
that make up the bulk of most limestones,
analogous
to the quartz
sand of a sandstone
or the pebbles
of a conglomerate.
Microcrystalline
ooze represents
a clay-size
“matrix”
whose
presence
signifies
lack of vigorous
currents,
just as the
presence
of a clay mineral
matrix
in a sandstone
indicates
poor washing.
Sparry calcite
cement
simply
fills up pore spaces in the rock where
microcrystalline
ooze has been
washed
out, just as porous,
non-clayey
sandstones
frequently
become
cemented
with
chemical
precipitates.
Thus the relative
proportions
of microcrystalline
ooze and
sparry
calcite
cement
are an important
feature
of the rock, inasmuch
as they show the
degree
of “sorting”
or current
strength
of the environment,
analogous
to textural
maturity
in sandstones.
If we plot
these
two
constituents
and the allochemical
“framework”
as three
poles of a triangular
diagram
(see figure),
the field
in which
limestones
occur
is shown
by the shaded
area;
divisions
between
the three
major
textural
types of limestone
are also shown on this figure.
A similar
field appears
if one
plots
terrigenous
rocks on a triangle
with
the three
poles of sand and silt, clay and
orthochemical
cement.
This classification
is predicated
on the assumption
that the sparry
calcite
has not
been formed
by aggrading
recrystallization
of a fine calcite
ooze, and that microcrystalline
calcite
has not formed
by degrading
recrystallization
of coarser
calcite.
In most
carbonates
the writer
has examined,
this assumption
is believed
to be very largely
true.
Nevertheless,
the writer
agrees
that recrystallization
is a very important
process
in
some
limestone
formations,
and the classification
proposed
here does not apply
to
recrystallized
rocks.
It provides
a starting
point
for study of recrystallized
rocks,
though,
because
on original
deposition
these
rocks must have belonged
to one of the
groups here proposed.
Type
I limestones
(designated
as Sparry
Allochemical
rocks)
consist
chiefly
of
allochemical
constituents
cemented
by sparry
calcite
cement.
These
rocks
are
equivalent
to the well-sorted
terrigenous
conglomerates
or sandstones
in that solid
particles
(here
intraclasts,
oolites,
fossils
or pellets)
have
been heaped
together
by
currents
powerful
or presistent
enough
to winnow
away any microcrystalline
ooze that
otherwise
might
have accumulated
as a matrix,
and the interstitial
pores have been
filled
by directly
precipitated
sparry calcite
cement.
The relative
proportions
of sparry
calcite
cement
and allochems
varies
within
rather
restricted
limits
because
of the
I imi tations
of packing:

(2)
There
must be a certain
minimum
amount
of allochems
present
in order to
support
the structure-sparry
calcite
cement
grows
only in poor spaces and in general
cannot
form
a rock
on its own
right,
unless
recrystallization
occurs.
Similarly
sandstones
require
a minimum
amount
of sand grains
(say 60 percent)
to support
the
rock structure.
It may be noted that carbonate
rocks on deposition
often
have porosity
much
greater
than
sandstones
or conglomerates
of equivalent
size because
of the
irregular
shapes of fossils (see Dunham
1962).
Type II limestones
(designated
as Microcrystalline
Allochemical
rocks) consist also
of a considerable
proportion
of allochems,
but here currents
were not strong
enough
or
persistent
enough
to winnow
away
the microcrystalline
ooze,
which
remains
as a
matrix:
sparry
calcite
is very subordinate
or lacking
simply because
no pore space was
available
for it to form
in.
These
rocks
are equivalent
texturally
to the clayey
sandstone
or conglomerates,
which also tend to have little
cement.

a rock in its own right
(comparable
to a claystone

and can accept

Thus the boundary
line between
Microcrystalline

arbitrary,
and has been set at IO percent

Type
I limestones
indicate
strong
or persistent
currents;
type
II limestones
indicate
weak,
short-lived
currents
or a rapid
rate of formation
of microcrystalline
ooze; and most
limestones
can be assigned
readily
to one or the other
of these two
classes
because
usually
either
sparry
calcite
or microcrystalline
calcite
is clearly
dominant.
In some rocks there
are transitions,
however,
either
because

and the ooze is only partially

or (2) in some very
fine grained

calcilutites,
the pore spaces
between
pellets
are so tiny that
sparry
calcite
crystals
are very minute,
and can only with great
difficulty
be told from
microcrystalline ooze.
Transitional
types can be designated
by symbol
I - II. Some of these types
may also represent
rocks in which the matrix
has partially
recrystallized.
Type
III limestones
(the Microcrystalline
rocks)
represent
the opposite
extreme
from
Type
I, inasmuch
as they consist
almost
entirely
of microcrystalline
ooze with
little
or no allochem
material
and no sparry
calcite.
This implies
both a rapid rate of
formation
of microcrystalline
ooze together
with
lack of strong
currents.
Texturally,
they correspond
with the claystones
among the terrigenous
rocks.
Some microcrystalline

without

of distinct

These
are considered
as Disturbed
Microcrystalline
rocks,
and a special
symbol
and rock term (“dismicrite”)
is used for them (see classification
table).
Bioherm
rocks
(Cummings
and Shrock,
1928),
made
up of organic
structures
growing
in situ, are unique
and place
in a special
class, “biolithite”
Type
IV.
The
dominant%gansm
should be specified,
e.g., coral biolithite,
blue-greek
algal biolithite,
etc.
Of course,
if these bioherms
are broken
up and redeposited
the resulting
rock is
considered
to be made up of intraclasts
and falls in Type I or Type II depending
on the
interstitial
material.
After
the main division
of limestones
into Types I, II, or III it is most essential
to
distinguish
whether
the allochemical
portion
consists
of intraclasts,
oolites,
fossils
or
pellets.
In terrigenous
sandstones,
one wishes
to know not only whether
the rock has
clay or not, but what the composition
of the sand is; hence geologists
recognize
arkoses,
phyllarenites
and orthoquartzites,
all of which
types
may or may not contain
clay
matrix.
It is just as important
to recognize
the radically
different
allochem
types in
limestones,
and the scheme
for classification
is presented
in the table.
The division
lines between
the groups
are set at levels
believed
to reflect
the significance
of the
constituent;
for example,
intraclasts
are so important
genetically,
indicating
as they do
a tearing
up of previously-deposited
limestone
and possibly
indicating
tectonic
uplift,
that
a rock is called
an intraclastic
rock if it contains
only 25 percent
intraclasts,
Whether
a rock is intraclastic,
oolitic,
although
it may have 60 to 70 percent

biogenic,
or pelletiferous
is indicated
by adding
“i”, “o”,.“b”,
or “p” to the symbol I or II
or III, as in Sparry
lntraclastic
rocks (Ii), or Microcrystalline
biogenic
rocks (Ilb).

I61

So far, gross texture
(whether
Sparry
Allochemical,
Microcrystalline
AllochemiCal, or Microcrystalline),
and composition
of allochems
(whether
intraclasts,
oolites,
fossils,
or pellets)
have been included
in the classification,
but nothing
has been said
about grain
size of the allochems.
If the allochems
average
coarser
than
I mm, the
rock is a calcirudite
(or dolorudite);
if they lie between
.0625 and I mm, the rock is a
than
.0625
mm,
calcilutite
or dololutite.
In
calcareni
te or dol areni te; if finer
determining
the grain
size name,
only
the size of the allochems
is considered;
percentage
and crystal
size of microcrystalline
ooze or sparry
calcite
and grain size of
terrigenous
material
is ignored.
Thus a rock consisting
of 20 percent
brachiopod
shells
embedded
in microcrystalline
ooze and quartz
sand is descriptively
a calcirudite,
just as
much as a rock consisting
of 80 percent
limestone
pebbles
cemented
by sparry
calcite.
Genetically,
of course,
there
is a great
difference
between
them and the writer
seldom
uses the term “biomicrudite”.
In theory,
the three
fold size classification
just given
is valid;
but in practice,
rocks
with
allochems
averaging
in the calcilutite
range
are very
rare.
The only
allochem
rock types with representatives
in this size class are pellet
rocks or biogenic
rocks, and in both of these the pellets
or fossil fragments
average
no smaller
than .04 or
.05 mm, just barely
under the limit of calcarenite;
pellet
rocks nearly
always
hover on
the borderline
between
calcilutite
and calcarenite
(since
the average
pellet
size is
between
.05 and .I 0 mm).
Setting
a new rock class apart
on such an artificial
and
insignificant
boundary
seems to be an unnecessary
complication,
hence the writer
has
lumped
these rare allochem
calcilutites
together
with the calcarenites
in the classification scheme.
The only common
calcilutites
are the pure
microcrystalline
oozes,
although
many pellet
rocks appear
as calcilutites
in the field
and under
a binocular
microscope.
All the rock characteristics
discussed
above
are combined
in a single name, shown
in the table
and diagrammatically
in the second
figure.
At first the writer
used such
cumbersome
terms as “sparry
intraclastic
calcarenite”
for intrasparite,
“microcrystalline
biogenic
calcirudite”
for biomicrudite,
etc.; but these names, although
self-explanatory,
were too awkward
to use in descriptions.
As an alternative
he thought
of introducing
locality
terms,
but the localities
would
be difficult
to choose
and the terms
in
themselves
would
be entirely
meaningless
and difficult
to memorize.
Finally,
the
writer
decided
to use single
composite
words,
each portion
of which
referred
to a
specific
rock characteristic:
thus “intra”
for intraclastic
rocks, “00” for oolitic
ones,
“bio”
for biogenic
types, and “pel”
for pellet
rocks.
Whether
the rocks were type I or
for those with sparry
calcite
type II was shown
by the second
part of the name, “spar”
cement
and “micr”
(pronounced
with a short i, as in “mick”)
for those with microcrystalline ooze matrix.
Type III limestones,
almost
entirely
ooze, were designated
“micrite”
(pronounced
“rnick-rite”)
without
any allochem
prefix.
Inasmuch
as most limestones
are
calcarenites,
no further
syllable
was added
if the size fell
in that category,
and as
exlained
above,
the rare and somewhat
artificial
calcilutites
are lumped
together
with
the calcarenites
in this table.
It is important
to differentiate
the calcirudites,
though,
and the word segment
“rudite”
may be added if the size falls in that class.
Examples,
together
with the symbols
used, are presented
in the table.
Some
rocks
classified
as Oosparite,
Intramicrudite,
etc. may have
significant
amounts
of other
allochems
which
do not appear
in the name.
These may be specified
at the discretion
of the worker,
such as Fossiliferous
Oosparite,
Oolitic
Intramicrudite,
etc.
Biogenic
rocks, if composed
largely
of one or two types of organism,
should always
be described
as Brachiopod
biomicrudite,
Gastropod
biosparite,
Foramcrinoid
biomitrite,
Oyster-echinoid
biosparite,
etc.

The writer
has not yet adapted
this classification
to rocks in which recrystallization has been important;
any such attempt
would
be quite premature
until these rocks
have been better
studied
and their
importance
evaluated.
One recrystallized
rock type
appears
to be of rather
frequent

however.
These rocks would
be classified
as micrites,
type III, or biomicrites,
type Ilb, (i.e., nearly
pure microcrystalline
ooze, or fossils in an ooze matrix,
respectively)
were it not for the fact that the
grains
are still
equidimensional
and uniform
in size but microcrystalline
calcite
is
coarser
than normal--average
5 to I5 microns
instead
of 2 to 5 microns.
Because
this
relatively
coarser
material
occupies
large areas or makes up the entire
specimen,
it
cannot
have formed
as a cement
and probably
represents
aggrading
recrystallization
of
a “normal”
microcrystalline

as

Carbonate
rocks contain
both physically-transported
particles
(oolites,
intraclasts,
fossils,
and pellets)
and chemically-precipitated
minerals
(either
as pore-filling
cement,
primary
ooze, or as products
of recrystallization
and replacement).
Therefore
the size
scale must be a double
one, so that
one can distinguish
which
constituent
is being
considered
(e.g. coarse
calcirudites
may be cemented
with
very
finely
crystalline
dolomite,
and fine calcarenites
may be cemented
with
coarsely
crystalline
calcite).
The size scale for transported
constituents
uses the terms
of Grabau
but retains
the
finer
divisions
of Wentworth
except
in the calcirudite
range;
it is most useful
for
limestones
where
transported
particles
are most obvious.
For obviously
allochemical
dolomites,
the terms “dolorudite”,
“dolarenite”
and “dololutite”
are substituted
for these
shown.
The scale for authigenic
constituents
also follows
the Wentworth
divisions;
it is
most
useful
for
dolomites,
where
transported
particles
are usually
obliterated
by
replacement,
and crystal
size is one of the few describable
characteristics.
Most
dolomites
fall in the medium

In general,

(Sparry

short)
are those limestones

of vigorous

they often
show good bedding

of allochems.
Thus they

as eolianites

shallow
neritic
sediments,
submarine
raised
banks, swift
tidal
channels,
barrier
bars, etc.
To
these
sediments
the concept
of textural
maturity
can be fruitfully
applied
(this idea
stimulated
by R. J. Dunham
and C. 8. Thames).
Of course
all type
II limestones
(-micrites)
would
be classed
as immature,
and the -sparites
would
be submature
or
better.

significance
for pelsparite
and oosparite,
which
are virtually
by definition
well sorted
and well rounded.
lntrasparites
could be divided
into well-sorted
versus
poorly
sorted
types,
but intraclasts
are almost
always
rounded
so that “supermature”
would
have no
meaning.
The most
cogent
application
would
be to the biosparites.
Supermature
biosparites
(finely

to bits by wave action

coquinas.
Such supermature
pelecypod
biosparites
formed
a semicircular
beach coquina
around
the north flank of Pilot Knob, a
Cretaceous
submarine
volcano
near Austin
(R. White).
Often,
the well-sorted
(mature)
ones are made
up of one fossil
type,
e.g., pelecypod
fragments,
crinoid
columnals,
forams,
or fusulinids;
the poorly
sorted
(submature)
ones are made
up of diverse
mixtures
of fossils of inherently
different
size, e.g. forams
plus crinoids,
or brachiopods
plus bryozoans
plus fusulinids.
Thus sorting
is believed,
as in terrigenous
rocks, to be
largely
a function
of source
(i.e. available
types
of fossils),
with
environment
(i.e.
strength
of waves
and currents,
or water
depths)
playing
a modifying,
but not
controlling
role.
Sorting
is best in shallower
waters
or on the beach
itself,
and gets
worse offshore.
Thus in moving
from
a beach surf zone into deeper
waters
one might
theoretically
expect
the sequence
to go from
supermature
biosparite
(well rounded
and
sorted)
to mature
(sorted
but only slightly
rounded)
to submature
(unsorted,
fragments
not rounded
but possibly
broken)
to biomicrite
(immature,
with
unsorted,
broken
or
whole
fossils)
and finally
micrite.
This sequence
would
undoubtedly
be modified
by
types of fossils
available
and wave energy
of the coast.
See I962 AAPG
Mem I’/ I and
1964 JG (Folk & Robles)
for details.
In some areas, shoal regions
and littoral
zones are characterized
by algal, coral,
or other
types of reefs.
Most reef-forming
organisms
live in the shallow
waters
where
there
is still sunlight
available
for photosynthesis
of the algae, which
make up the bulk
of living
tissue on most reefs (Odum).
Reef rocks (biolithites)
are exceedingly
complex,
because
of (I)
abundant
life
and many
different
types
of fossils,
making
rock
petrographically
varied,
especially
the algae (there
is probably
as much complexity
and
variety
of external
form and internal
structure
in algae as there
is in all other
fossils
put together),
(2) the fantastic
growth
forms
assumed
by many of the reef organisms,
with
weird
branching,
bushy
or encrusting
habits,
(3) the reef
rock
is riddled
with
cavities
which may be empty
(and later filled
with spar in fibrous
or mosaic
forms),
or
cavities
may be partly
filled
with
terrigenous
sand, intraclasts,
lime mud,
pellets,
organisms
that lived in the cavity,
and inswept
broken
fossil
debris.
Add to this the
fact
that
reefs
are prone
to patchy
recrystallization
(because
of the high aragonite
content)
and one can see that a thin section
will be of the utmost
complexity.
Reefs,
although
they usually
thrive
in high-energy
zones, act as baffles
to the current,
and the
water
movement
down in the crevices
and pockets
between
branching
organisms
may be
relatively
calm even
in a surf zone, just as the interior
of a forest
may be calm in a
windy day.
Hence
reefs are associated
with much micrite
and fine debris
which
filters
down between
the branching
growths
and cannot
be dislodged.
In fact,
stromatolitic
reefs,
probably
formed
by blue-green
algae, are largely
micrite,
presumably
trapped
by
the slimy algal mats and then firmly
bound together
by the filaments.
Rocks of type II and type III (either
pure micrite
or rocks with a micrite
matrix)
indicate
formation
in areas of ineffective
winnowing
and calm
currents.
These can
form
in four
important
ways:
(I) in protected
lagoons,
in which
the water
is very
shallow,
perhaps
not more than a few feet deep; (2) in broad, shallow
platforms
on the
lee side of barriers
(e.g. west side of Andros
Island,
Bahamas),
where
the great width
of
the platform
prevents
any permanent
removal
of lime mud and it is merely
shifted
around;
(3) in moderately
deep waters
in geosynclines
(probably
down to a few hundreds
of feet);
(4) as open-ocean
Chalks;
(5) as Ginsberg
has shown,
lime mud may accumulate
locally
around
organic
baffles
(marine
grasses,
coral
or algal
growths)
even
in fairly
high-energy
environments.
To tell these micrite-rich
environments
apart
is often
a
difficult
problem
as they may represent
very shallow
or moderately
deep areas.
Several
criteria
are useful.
Among
the best criteria
is the fossil content.
For example,
clams
or oysters
in micrite
would
indicate
a shallow,
perhaps
lagoonal
area,
whereas
an
exclusively
pelagic
fauna of small forams
would probably
be indicative
of deeper
water

167

far from
shore.
Another
very good criterion
is the Iithology
of associated
beds.
If the
micri te occurs
i nterbedded
with
high-energy
calcareni
tes and calcirudites,
cemented
with sparry
calcite
and showing
evidences
of current
action,
then the micrite
is very
likely
of shallow
water
origin;
the alternation
might
represent
a fluctuation
between
lagoon
and barrier-bar
or beach
environments.
If, on the contrary,
monotonous
thicknesses
of micrite
occur
with
no interbedded
-sparites,
a deeper
water
origin
is
implied.
Burrowed
or churned
up dismicrites
seem to be characteristic
of lagoonal
or
shallow-water
sediments,
as are micrites
that have been torn up and reworked
to form
intraclasts.
If the climate
was semiarid
with development
of evaporitic
tendencies,
the
lagoonal
micrites
might
be associated
with
beds of more
saline
indicators
such as
replacement
dolomite,
or,
if restricted
circulation,
primary
dolomite,
anhydrite,
gypsum,
celesti te, etc.
If the climate
was humid,
influxes
of clay may be associated
with lagoonal
micrites
because of river drainage
into bays and lagoons.
In many beds of biomicrite
and fossiliferous
micrite,
the fossils are badly broken;
how does this happen
in supposedly
calm-water
environments?
Sometimes
these beds
would
represent
a normal
sequence
from
shoreline
well-rounded
biosparites
into more
poorly
sorted
biosparites
made of broken
but non-rounded
shells,
to biomicrites
and
finally
micrites
in deeper
or calmer
waters.
But often
the shells
are broken
not by
wave or current
action
but by the activities
of predator
organisms,
which crunch
up the
shells in search of food and in some cases pass the debris through
their digestive
tracts.
Many
beds of micrite
show
badly
broken
and randomly
oriented
shells
distributed
patchily
throughout
the rock, often
arranged
along vague “flow-lines.”
These probably
represent
a lime mud riddled
with burrowers
and scavengers,
which break the shells and
churn them up with micrite.
Beds of intramicrite
and oomicrite
might
be formed
by a similar
mechanism.
A
bed of lime mud might
be laid down, followed
by deposition
of a well-sorted
layer of
intraclasts
or oolites.
Before
the rocks have a chance
to get cemented,
the whole
sediment
might be churned
up by burrowers
so that the allochems
would
get mixed with
micrite.
In these rocks the allochems
often show a patchy,
swirled
distribution.
The significance
of color in limestones
is not too well known.
Ordinarily,
in welloxygenated
(shal I ow and wave-agi
toted)
waters,
bacteria
thrive
and eat up decayed
organic
matter,
resulting
in light-colored
rocks.
In waters
of poor oxygenation,
either
restricted,
stagnating
lagoon
or deeper
offshore
marine
waters,
reducing
conditions
dominate
and organic
matter
accumulates
faster
than bacteria
can remove
it, and dark,
pyri tic limestones
result.
The Buda limestone
in central
Texas
grades
from
white
micrite
in the nearshore
facies
to dark gray micrite
in deeper
wates
farther
offshore
(Hixon).
Many deep geosynclinal
limestones
are dark colored,
but so are many shallow
lagoonal
limestones.

It is
when referring

or when the exact

Neomorphism
(and its more
specific
processes,
inversion

usually
result
in increase
of crystal
size (aggrading
recrystallization),
such as when a
carbonate
mud
goes
to sparry
calcite.
Occasionally,
the crystal
size decreases
(degrading
recrystallization),
as when
oolites
or fossils
degrade
to micrite,
but this
porcess
is much more rare.

177

Aggrading
neomorphism
may be either
porphyroid
or coalescive.
In porphyroid
neomorphism
(or porphyroid
recrystallization,
porphyroid
inversion)
a few large crystals
grow
at the expense
of a static
matrix,
thus a porphyroid
fabric
with large and small
crystals
is in existence
during
intermediate
stages
of the process.
In coalescive
neomorphism,
most of the crystals
are either
growing
or being consumed,
i.e. the whole
mass is changing
like the growth
of bubbles
in a soap foam;
a uniform
crystal
size is
maintained
throughout
the mass, though
the average
crystal
size gradually
grows larger.
Porphyroid
neomorphism
appears
to be a much more
common
process,
but coalescive
neomorphism
may be the mechanism
by which
microspar
is formed;
it is usually
very
equigrai
ned.
The importance
of calcite-to-calcite
recrystallization
is an unsolved
point.
In Folk’s
opinion
this occurs
importantly
in some
localities
and at some
stratigraphic
horizons,
but is overall
volumetric
importance
is minor.
Recrystallization
of micrite
to 5-15 micron
microspar
is rather
common,
however.
Recrystallized
allochems
can be recognized
if they consist
almost
entirely
of
mosaic
spar;
some
fossils
and intraclasts
are thus affected.
Recrystallization
of
micrite
matrix
should yield allochems
floating
far apart
in a “sea” of spar, like plums in
a pudding,
far too loosely
packed
to fit the requirements
of packing;
it should
also
produce
isolated
patches
of recrystallization
spar in homogeneous
micrite
beds.
Such
rocks are quite rare.
Usually,
where
allochems
are closely
packed
they have a sparry
calcite
cement
(like close-packed,
well-sorted
sandstones);
where
allochems
are loosely
packed,
they lie in a micrite
matrix
(like sand grains
in a shale).
The overwhelming
dominance
of these two types argues
that most spar is a pore-filling
cement,
not the
result
of recrystallization.
The abundance
of well-sorted,
now-porous
calcarenites
in
recent
sediments
indicates
that well-sorted,
calcite-cemented
calcarenites
should
be
abundant
in the geologic
column.
Recrystallization
can be proven
if spar can be shown to transgress
allochems
and
matrix
more or less indiscriminately.
The criteria
for proving
recrystallization
are the
same as those for replacement.
Bathurst
(I 958) has pot-posed
some fabric
criteria
for
recognition
of recrystallization,
and Folk (I 965) has a few comments.

Because

the Mg/Ca

In summary,
these data on natural

either
by supratidal

(2) by a reflux

through

beneath

Both these models
rely upon using
a brine
that
is always
hypersaline.
Hypersaline
dolomite
certainly
exists,
but we
propose that it is much easier and of much greater
importance
to produce
dolomite
by
dilution
with
fresh
water.
This can happen
in several
ways:
(I) the schizohaline
environment,
wherein
hypersaline
brines are periodically
mixed with fresh waters
in a
near-surface
environment;
(2) mixture
in the shallow
subsurface
of evaporitic,
highly
saline brines with fresh water;
(3) mixture
of normal
sea water or its connate
equivalent
with meteoric
water,
as in a salt-water/freshwater-lens
contact
zone; and (4) phreatic
meteoric
water collecting

Schizohaline
environment.
Many shallow
hypersaline
environments
are subjected
to episodic
flushing
by fresh water.
A sabkha can be flooded
with monsoon
rains; or a
shallow
hypersaline
bay may be flushed
by storms
or hurricanes.
In either
case the
salinity
drops suddenly
and drastically
to nearly
fresh conditions,
only to be built slowly
back to hypersaline
conditions,
as the normal
evaporitic
regime
regains
mastery.
Such
environments,
characterized
by wild
swings
between
hypersaline
and nearly
fresh
condition,
with
essentially
no times
of normal
marine
salinity,
are designated
as
“schizohaline”
environments.
Why is a schizohaline
environment
such an ideal place to form dolomite?
Let us
assume a typical
sabkha with perhaps
five times normal
salinity
and a Mg/Ca
ratio of
double
normal,
say 7: I.
Adding
fresh
water
drops
the salinity
drastically,
but the
MgICa
ratio remains
almost as high as it was initially
because
of the low concentration
of total
salts, including
Ca and Mg, carried
by the diluting
water.
On the diagram
this
illustrated
by a line dropping
almost
vertically
and the compositon
of the water
plunges
deeply into the dolomite
field.
For example,
diluting
one part normal
sea water
with 9 parts
of average
river
water
with about
100 ppm total dissolved
solids (typically
including
20 ppm Ca and 7
ppm Mg) decreases
the salinity
of the mixture
to about one-tenth-normal
sea water,
but
Diluting
a typical
hypersaline
changes
the Mg/Ca
ratio

3: I to 2.2: I.
sabkha brine with 9 parts of river
water
would drop the Mg/Ca
ratio
only from
7:1 to
6:l.
Water of such composition
in the subsurface
then should
continue
to precipitate
dolomite
until the Mg/Ca
ratio approaches
l:2.
Repetition
of this process every several
decades
might allow significant
quantities
of dolomite
to form.
