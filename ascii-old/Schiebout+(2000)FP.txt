13. ABSTRACT (Maximum 200 words)

This report discusses research on the fIrst Miocene terrestrial mammal fauna from Louisi~a and its paleoenvironment, from August,
1995 through August, 2000, including addition of nine lower vertebrate and thirteen mammalian taxa to the faunal list. New additions
include an unusually small beaver, a squirrel which is an ecologically significant range extension, a giant camel, a large rhinoceros, a
tiny peccary, an oreodont, a weasel, a procyonid, a toad, two types of snake, and a shark.
The Fort Polk sites represent a new and increasingly well-documented record of faunal and environmental changes in a period of major
worldwide temperature and sea level changes. Age of the fauna lies between 13.8 Ma and 12.6 Ma. The fossiliferous beds are from the
non-marine upper portion of the Castor Creek Member of the Fleming Formation. A 12.8 Ma d 13C isotope shift was probably
associated with a local change from a dominant C3-type vegetation (usually trees, shrubs, cool climate or wetland grasses) to a C4type vegetation (usually warm climate grasses) and reflects environmental changes associated with base level drops. Timing is close to
a warming period following global cooling associated with Antarctic ice development, an event tied to global lowering of sea level.

ABSTRACT
This report discusses recovery offossils and
research on the first Miocene terrestrial mammal fauna from Louisiana and its paleo-environment, from August, 1995 through February, 2000, including addition of nine lower
vertebrate and thirteen mammalian taxa to
the faunal list. A total of 3,950 specimens was
numbered in this period, ranging from tiny
shrew teeth to pieces of the relatively large
bones of extinct rhinoceros and giant camel.
Techniques for the recovery of tiny and fragile fossils from strongly cemented carbonate nodule conglomerates have evolved, allowing the processing
of approximately 5,000 kg of rock.
The fossiliferous beds are from the non-marine
upper portion of the Castor Creek Member of the
Fleming Formation, with the best concentrations
of small vertebrates coming from conglomerates
formed by concentration of coarse material from
soils. The Fort Polk region was coastal and environmentally different from the long-studied Great
Plains sites, which partly explains why many of
the Miocene small mammals are particularly
small for their kinds compared to those from
Northern sites. Their recovery from soil concentrates using fine screens is also part ofthe explanation, but the comparative scarcity of mediumsized mammals appears to be at least partly ecological, related to increase oflocal grassland habitats. Palynological evidence supports the presence
of both forest and grassy, open areas. Changes in
diversity of kinds of abundant rodents helps in
recognition of changes in relative amounts of forest and grassland environments in the Fort Polk
fossiliferous section.
New additions to the Fort Polk Miocene
fauna include an unusually small beaver, a
squirrel which is an ecologically significant
range extension, a giant camel, a large rhinoceros, a very small peccary, an oreodont, a
weasel, and a procyonid. The fauna now includes ten orders oflower vertebrates and nine
orders of mammals. Insectivores, chiropterans,
alagomorph,alargecarnivore,rodents,horses,a
prosynthetocerine, and a gomphothere were pre-

viously known from the fauna. Lower vertebrate
fossils previously known from the fauna include fish, crocodiles, turtles, and lizards. This
work has added more closely identifiable fish material, allowing recognition offour additional forms
in the fauna, plus remains of the first toad in the
fauna, two types of snake, and a shark. Some
forms, such as the tiny beaver and a member of
the rodent genus Copemys are probably new species. Otherformsknownfrom vmyfragmentaJ:ymaterial, such as the small peccary, may also prove to be
new species ifmore material can be recovered.
Age of the fauna is early Late Barstovian,
based on mammalian biostratigraphy. Age
range of the fossiliferous sites, based on newly
obtained paleomagnetic data, lies between
13.8 Ma and 12.6 Ma. The Fort Polk Miocene
sites represent a new and increasingly welldocumented record offaunal and environmental changes in a period of major worldwide
temperature and sea level changes. Carbon
isotope study confrrms that the carbonate nodules and associated faunas are definitely older
than the worldwide 7.0 to 7.4 Ma (31ac shift,
usually considered to be associated with a
change from a dominant Ca-type vegetation
(usually trees, shrubs, cool climate or wetland
grasses) to a C4 -type vegetation usually warm
climate grasses). Ca and C4 plants utilize different photosynthetic pathways, resulting in
differences in carbon isotope composition of
organic carbon residues left in soils and sediments where they were the dominant vegetation. A 12.8 Ma carbon shift at Fort Polk reflects environmental changes associated with
base level drops recorded in conglomerate layers in the top 20 m of the Castor Creek Member. Timing is close to a warming period following global cooling associated with Antarctic ice development, an event tied to global
lowering of sea level. The carbon shift may
reflect a local spread of C4 grasses, known from
phytolith evidence to have been present at
least in small amounts over the stratigraphic
span of the Fort Polk fossil vertebrate sites.

INTRODUCTION
Background

Technical terminology for fossil teeth (Appendix A) and abbreviations (Appendix B) are
given in the Appendices.

This is the second report for the Corps
of Engineers since 1994 to be prepared on a
portion of the work supported by the D. S.
Army FORSCOM on contracts with the Corps
of Engineers via Prewitt and Associates. Publications in the scientific literature and presentations at scientific meetings are given in
Appendix D. The fauna has grown appreciably, both in numbers and in taxa recovered.
The Fort Polk Miocene fauna occupied 577
numbers in the Vertebrate Paleontology collections ofthe LSD Museum of Natural Science at the completion for the first report
(Schiebout, 1997b), and now occupies a total
of 3,991 numbers.
Before the discovery of the Fort Polk Mi0cene sites, there was only a single report of
Miocene land animal"remains from Louisiana
(Arata, 1966), the tips of the lower tusks of a
gomphothere (Mammalia: Proboscidea). Arata
(1966) estimated that the specimen was from
Miocene beds of Fort Polk, and it could have
come from the vicinity of one of the sites currently under study in this project, but precise
locality information on it was not available.
Only a single proboscidean specimen, a tooth
fragment, has been recovered in the current
work on Fort Polk (Schiebout, 1997b, p. 60),
so our work has not provided a solid link to
the occurrence of that specimen. The previous lack of Louisiana Miocene fossil mammals
results in most genera recovered in the research on the Fort Polk Miocene fauna being
new to the state.
In the following report, both in the table
of contents and when used as section headings, names of vertebrate taxa added to the
fauna after the first report (Schiebout, 1997b)
are underlined. In the segments on taxa previously reported in Schiebout (1997b), anyadditions or changes to the characterization of
the taxon at this stage of the work are given.

General Geologic History:

Environments

And

The upper half of the Castor Creek Member of the Fleming Formation has yielded the
mammals discussed in this report. The Castor Creek Member underlies the Blounts
Creek Member, uppermost of the six members
in the Fleming Formation (Figure 1), which
outcrop in a broad band crossing Fort Polk
(Figure 2). Further information on the extent,
composition, and depositional environments
of the Member is found in Rogers and
Callandro (1965), Jones et aI. (1995), Hinds
(1998, 1999), and McCulloh and Heinrich
(2000). Correlation of at least part of the Castor Creek Member with beds exposed at
Burkeville, Texas (Figure 3) has been based
in part oftheir both containing the Potamides
matsoni fauna of brackish water invertebrates
(Rogers and Callandro, 1965; Turcan et aI.,
1966; and Hinds, 1998). The Castor Creek
mammal faun~s have been correlated with the
Cold Spring Local Fauna of east Texas (Figure 3), younger than the stratigraphically
lower Burkeville Local Fauna of Wilson (1956)
(Schiebout et al 1996, Schiebout, 1997a,
1997b; Schiebout et aI. 1998; Schiebout and
Ting, 1998).
The upper Castor Creek Member was deposited during a period of falling sea levels,
as shown in a comparison ofthe temporal history of Louisiana and depositional episodes
with reference to eustatic sea level changes
(Figure 4) modified from Galloway et aI. (1991)
and Hinds (1999). According to Hinds (1998,
p. 68), "The Castor Creek Member section may
represent an overall shoaling-up from basal

marine associated deposits of a lower deltaic
plain environment during a period of maximum transgression, to more terrestrial-associated deposits in its upper section." The upper Castor Creek Member concentrations of
calcareous pedogenic nodules from which most
small vertebrate remains have been recovered,
have been attributed to drops in base level
causing erosion on interfluves (Schiebout et.
al. 1998). David Hinds mapped and studied
the Castor Creek Member in the Fort Polk
area as part of his Masters study at LSD. His
field work on the Castor Creek and the
Fleming Formation members above and below it did not yield more conglomerates which
proved to be productive fossil screening sites.
His work also did not locate conglomerates
outside of the stratigraphic range ofthe original site clusters, DISC (sites near the initial
discovery of a vertebrate fossil) and TVOR
(sites near a terminal very-high frequency
omni radar installation). Hinds (1998, pp. 2527) concluded re the conglomerates in the
upper portion of the Castor Creek Member:
"The conglomerate is composed of surrounded carbonate nodules and rounded clasts
of clay, and contains rare biogenic material.
The clasts, including the calcareous nodules,
range in size from coarse sand to gravel-sized
clasts. The conglomerate is in many places
well cemented and has a sandy calcite matrix. Bed thickness varies from approximately
15 cm (6 inches) to laminae less than 1 cm
(0.4 inches) thick, a few clasts in thickness.
Beds may show a poor sorting and weak sedimentary structure or show a distinct fining
up to fine sand and well developed cross bedding. Weakly consolidated, uncemented conglomerate beds occur displaying the same
sedimentary characteristics as cemented
beds."
David Hinds measured and described a
section at Persimmon Barrow site (Figure 5),
which has yielded horse and beaver specimens, highest site of the DISC cluster and a
site not previously described in Schiebout

1997b), as follows:
"The Persimmon Barrow Section is located approximately 50 m (164 ft) northnorthwest of the man-made exposure at
the main DISC site. The section begins
with 20 cm (8 in) of calcareous, light gray,
interlaminated silt and clay, mottled yellowish brown, with a distinctive blocky
weathering style, suggestive of weakly
defined joints. This lithology is overlain
by 40 cm (16 in) of blocky, calcareous, light
gray clay, with a distinct black color mottling thought to be iron-manganese oxide
staining. The section continues with 40 cm
(16 in) of calcareous, clayey silt, mottled
yellowish brown. The silt has a blocky
appearance and displays drab-halo root
traces. Calcareous nodules are found
throughout this lithology, but become
more abundant towards the top. The fossil find was recovered from within the calcareous nodule rich layer at approximately 1 m (3.2 ft) from the base of the
section, in 15 cm (6 in) of light gray, silty
clay, mottled yellowish brown. Overlying
the approximate location of the fossil discovery, is a distinctive, light yellowish
brown very fine, ripple laminated, calcareous silty sand. The sand is 5 cm (2 in) in
thickness, mottled yellowish brown, and
is weakly indurated with a carbonate cement. The sand is overlain by 30 cm (12
in) of light gray, calcareous silty clay
mottled yellowish brown, with drab-halo
root traces. Calcareous nodules are abundant, especially above the underlying sand
bed, where nodules appear to coalesce to
form a thin calcrete/calcareous crust. Rare
black, iron-manganese oxide staining is
found throughout the lithology. Calcareous nodules are absent in the next 10 cm
(4 in) of the section, being composed of
calcareous light gray silty clay, mottled
yellowish brown, with abundant black,
iron-manganese oxide staining and drabhalo root traces. 10 cm (4 in) oflight gray,

silty clay, and are in turn overlain by 30
cm (12 in) oflight gray noncalcareous silty
clay, heavily weathered and mottled, immediately below a thin soil. The

DISCOVERY Site (DISC) This site is a
seven and a half acre barrow pit south of the
Fort Polk landfill (Figure 8, 9, 10, 11) west of
Georgia Ave. At this locality the conglomerate is exposed in several outcrops at both the
east (a relatively continuous layer) (Figure
12), and west (small lenses) ends ofthe landfill.
GULLY Site This locality is an erosional
gully to the east of STONEHENGE (Figure
13) and to the south of the DISC site. Here
the conglomerate is patchy, friable and about
10 cm thick within a meter-thick gray clay.
STONEHENGE Site This locality, stratigraphically lowest of the DISC cluster, is in a
creek bed due south ofthe DISC landfill. Initially, there were a few broken and overturned
tabular blocks lying in the creek bed. Additional blocks were recovered using heavy
equipment (Figures 13, 14, 15). The lithology
of Stonehenge layers is similar to that of the
conglomerate at TVOR site.

II. METHODS
Field and laboratory methods offossil recovery are given in detail in Schiebout (1997b)
and Schiebout et. al. (1998). Dooley et al. (in
press) focuses on bulk lab methods. One ofthe
goals of this project has been to develop an
efficient process for bulk dissolution of sediments for faunal extraction. Laboratory treatment of the Fort Polk Miocene conglomerates
(Figure 6) involves soaking chunks in approximately 10% acetic acid to partially dissolve
and break, up ~he rock, which releases the fossils and nodules as a residue, which is then
sorted under the microscope to pick out small
fossils, mainly bone scrap and teeth (Figure
7). Removal of calcium carbonate nodular
material, other mineral coatings, and clay
from large vertebrate specimens is accomplished mechanically, either with an engraving tool or with mounted needles and dental
tools.

TVOR area sites
TVOR SiteÂ· This site is near the terminal
very-high frequency omni range radar tower,
off of Exchange Road. The primary exposure
of conglomerate at this site is in an erosional
gully directly on strike with the radar tower
and north of the east-west dirt road (Figure
9, 16). There are a few outcrops and some displaced blocks scattered in the cleared area
above the gully exposure and in the woods to
the north and NW of it.
TVOR northern sites N Hill (AKA Tadpole), TVOR NE
Bulldozing by the Army of the hill on which
TVOR occurs revealed small areas of sandstone and conglomerate (Figure 17). Mapping
of the area indicates that all are within 112 m
of each other in elevation, suggesting that they
may have been continuous or nearly so.

III. SITE DESCRIPTIONS
More detailed descriptions of sites
worked prior to 1996 are given in Schiebout
(1997b). Sites from subsequent work are underlined. Fossil sites occur in two main clusters (Figures 8, 9), those near the original
Discovery Site (DISC) and those near TVOR
Site. A third site, called Shamrock, just outside the Fort Polk boundary, has yielded Miocene rhinoceros material which is considered
with the rest. of the Fort Polk fauna. Relative
heights and stratigraphic relationships are
given in Figure 45.

Other Sites
Cemetery This site, mentioned in Schiebout
(1997b) is a creek bed to the northwest of
North Fort Polk, not in the vicinity of the other
conglomerate sites. It has proved unproductive.
NSU small outcrop of conglomerate near
Northwestern State University. Test washing
has proved unproductive. The site has been
covered as part of Fort Polk anti-erosion efforts.
Shamrock This bulldozed mudstone exposure has yielded a partial skeleton of a large
rhinoceros to quarrying (Figs. 20, 21). The site
is outside the Post boundary, but the specimen is from the Castor Creek Member and is
on strike with the TVOR site cluster, so it is
relevant as a source of part of the fauna.

Cores
Four cores have been available for
lithological and palynological study. No diagnostic microfossils other than pollen have been
recovered from the cores. DISC 1 and DISC 2
were drilled specifically to increase stratigraphic control at the DISC fossil sites and
DISC 3 is a longer core, nearby but outside
the DISC outcrop, drilled to monitor ground
water condition,s. TVOR core began directly
above the fossiliferous conglomerate at TVOR
Site (Figure 9).

interval sampling in a terrestrial
environment, and Smith and Kitching
(1997) estimated 50,000 years for the
accumulation of the widespread condensed bed they studied in the Jurassic
of South Mrica. The accumulation of the
DISC main conglomerate probably took
more time than the development of
regular paleosol fossil assemblages,
because it includes a period of denudation and concentration in addition to
paleosol formation, and probably less
time than the thicker and more extensive South Mrican deposit.
Bown and Kraus (1981) discussed
vertebrate concentrations in mudstones
from lower Eocene floodplain sediments
of Wyoming, concluding that the bones
accumulated as lags in the A horizons of
paleosols with little effect of sorting in
water. They reported that small mammal teeth make up 70% of the teeth
recovered, teeth that would readily
travel with sand-sized particles, and
used their presence, the lack of sand,
and other evidence to conclude that
hydraulic sorting was not significant in
these deposits (Bown and Kraus 1981 p.
48-49). All of the Fort Polk conglomerates include nodules and bones rounded
in water transport ... , some show distinctive cross bedding ... , and some of the
most fossiliferous include considerable
sand ... Many of the fossil remains from
the pedogenic nodule conglomerates
moved as sedimentary particles when
carried by water, as did vertebrate
remains discussed by Voorhies (1969),
Dodson (1973), and Korth (1979). Those
that accumulated in channel lags, for
example, the deposit at TVOR Site, Fort
Polk, were certainly subjected to such
processes. Small mammal teeth are
moderately transportable in water
compared to other skeletal elements.
They belong to Korth's (1979) dispersal

IV. TAPHONOMY
Taphonomy and depositional environment are discussed in detail in Schiebout et
al. (1998, Taphonomy) from which the following is quoted:
"Concentration of nodules and bones
can result from reworking during
channel meandering, overbank fluvial
erosion due to flooding or avulsion, or
erosion resulting from a drop in base
level, which causes rivers to entrench,
overbank addition to interfluvial areas
to slow or stop, and erosion to begin to
denude the interfluves. The conglomerates of very limited lateral extent,
like ... smalllenses exposed at the DISC
Site at Fort Polk ... , probably represent
material washed into small channels or
low areas on the floodplain ... The most
laterally extensive deposit at DISC site
in the Louisiana Miocene represents a
locally variable blanket of material
concentrated from soils by erosion. The
thin mudstone layer between upper and
lower portions of the main conglomerate
may represent an avulsion or crevasse
splay event flooding part of the area or
may represent local sheet wash. The
extreme fragility of some of the fossils
recovered from DISC precludes long
transport for them, but the well-rounded
condition of many bone pieces, particularly those from larger animals, suggests some transport for them, perhaps
including several cycles of
reworking ... DISC has also yielded
remains of large vertebrates (horses and
the early camel relative
Prosynthetoceras, ....). They were found
at or slightly above its upper surface
and probably represent animals buried
when deposition of overbank fine
sediment resumed in the area.
Behrensmeyer (1982) discussed paleosol
assemblages representing 4,000-9,000
year durations in her discussion of time

18

category II or III, with I having the
lowest settling rate (ribs), and IV the
highest, for example, mandibles. High
percentages of fish teeth (including
pharyngeal teeth) are found with the
terrestrial mammal teeth at Fort
Polk .... When identifiable, they have
proved to be from fresh-water fish,
which had to be transported into the
areas where nodules and terrestrial
vertebrate teeth were accumulating, or
the nodules and mammal teeth had to
be transported to join them. These
factors indicate that the Fort Polk
conglomerates include more reworking
and transport in water and mixing of
materials, and comparatively more time
averaging than the fossil accumulations
described by Bown and Kraus (1981).
The lower part of DISC main conglomerate is more similar to deposits such as
those described by Bown and Kraus
(1981) than are TVOR or Stonehenge
sites, where more transport occurred, at
Fort Polk. It shows a lower concentration of all kinds of teeth, fewer fish teeth
per unit of weight when compared to
mammals, and more large bone fragments versus small bone fragments,
than they do .... A rough correspondence
between degree of cementation with
calcium carbonate and productivity of
teeth, including terrestrial mammal
teeth, is seen at Fort Polk sites. Conglomerates like TVOR where more
winnowing has taken place have better
cementation ... and more fossils, including a higher percentage offish teeth ...
Clayey conglomerates like DISC ... have
fewer fossils because they represent
both less erosion and concentration of
the harvest."
The high percentage of small teeth versus large and medium ones is partly
taphonomic. Tiny teeth may last unmodified
longer during weathering (Andrews, 1990)

than the teeth oflarger animals. Small cracks,
fatal to whole teeth travelling with masses of
nodules which act like a ball mill during transport, would break up many large specimens.
It must be remembered in looking at the teeth
and other fossils from conglomerates that the
fossil harvest represents animals that lived
when the overbank mudstones formed, burrowing animals (and some surface dwellers)
that lived when soils that included the nodules were forming, animals that lived when
the soils were being eroded and concentrated,
and animals living in streams and lakes (Figure 22). The ratio of one small artiodactyl tooth
to several hundred rodent teeth (Figure 23)
in the collection may simply reflect, in part,
the original abundance of these teeth in the
harvest of animal remains. For every deer living in an area, dozens of mice may well be
living, and they produce several generations
per year of the deer's life. According to
Fastovsky and Weishampel (1996, p. 347) "... a
community oflarge herbivores might yield 25
% of its total biomass as prey, whereas a community of small herbivores might produce 600
% of its total biomass as prey."
Medium-sized animals are particularly
rare in the fauna, and this phenomenon is
partly taphonomic (Figure 26), but may also
be, in part, paleoecological. Remains of the
larger animals, such as camels and horses,
have a better chance of being recovered from
surface search (Figures 24, 25) compared to
individual teeth of medium-sized animals such
as Pseudoparablastomeryx. Bone scrap and
teeth of the larger forms, such as the
merychippine horse tooth in Figure 26, occur
in the conglomerates, so medium-sized forms
should be recovered in screening, even if
missed in surface search, if the difference were
not in part paleoecological.

spp., ?Asyregraamspora sp.) indicates active
plant degradation occurred under oxygenated
and damp, if not wet, conditions.
The presence of 7ricolporopollenites sp.
A and Ambrosia sp. in the uppermost sample
(O.64-0.66m) studied in the TVOR Core indicates that the sample can be no older than
nannofossil zone NN7, approximately at the
Serrevallian -Tortonian boundary, a pproximately 11-12 MA). The core was collected adjacent to and stratigraphically just below the
prolific TVOR vertebrate site. Age diagnostic
pollen were not recovered in any of the other
samples covered in Schiebout (1997b).

Paleobotany
Palynological Analyses
Prior Work
Samples have been collected from outcrops at DISC, TVOR, TVOR S, and from the
DISCI, DISC 2, and TVOR cores. Current
work is by John Wrenn, and palynological
methodology is given by Wrenn's discussion
in Schiebout (1997b), which includes illustrations of many of the palynomorphs. The following prior work summary is from Wrenn's
discussion in Schiebout (1997b).
All samples were non-marine in origin.
The pollen assemblages recovered from the
most productive samples suggest derivation
from a mixed evergreen and hardwood forest
with associated open areas containing grass
and herbaceous plants. Freshwater algal cysts
(e.g., Pseudoschizea concentricus) indicate periodically wet or permanent standing bodies
of shallow wat~r in the woodland. Fungal debris, including hyphae and spores (e.g.,
Uncinulites, Atrophonites sp., Polyporisporites

Current Work

TVORSE
A sample of reddish-brown rock was
scrubbed and dried before a subsample was
taken and processed. This was done to minimize modern contamination. The assemblages
probably have been altered from their original composition by post-depositional processes
in the geologic environment. Selectively removal of thinner walled pollen and other specimens may have occurred and need to be kept
in mind when interpreting the assemblages
recovered. The palynomorphs recovered are
similar to those previously reported from the

22

i

upper portion (0.64-0.66m) of the TVOR core,
and to additional core samples reported below. This suggests that the assemblages recovered are in situ and representative of the
preserved Miocene assemblages in the TVOR
area.
The recovered pollen are generally whole
and well preserved, and do not exhibit perforations, pit, tears, or bacterial markings typical of grains that have been subjected to environmental degradation. Specimens listed as
"Indeterminate" in Table 1 includes those
folded, damaged or sufficiently covered by
debris to prevent identification.
Arboreal Pollen: Arboreal pollen is the
most commonly encountered, with Pinus sp.
being by far the most abundant component of
the assemblage. Minor amounts ofBetulaceae,
Myrica (bayberry), Quecus (oak), and rare
specimens of Acer (maple), Alnus (alder),
Carya (hickory) Liquidambar (sweet gum),
Salix (willow), TCT (probably Taxodium) and
Ulmus (elm) complete the arboreal assemblage.
All are wind-pollinated trees, exceptAcer
and Salix, which are insect-pollinated. Wind
pollinated plants produce more pollen than
insect pollinated plants and this probably accounts for their dominance in the assemblage.
Herbaceous Pollen: Pollen of the herbaceous plants Ambrosia, Gramineae and
composites (Asteraceae) were present in low
numbers. All are wind pollinated and known
to produce large amounts of pollen. None of
the herbaceous plants are abundant and may
indicate few of these plants were present at
the time of deposition. Limited openings in the
forest cover would eliminate the settings
where these plants prefer to grow. It may also
indicate preferential destruction of these types
of pollen in the geologic environment, though
the preservation of the specimens recovered
does not indicate that this is necessarily the
case.
Other: Cysts of Pseudoschizaea circula,
apparently the cysts of a freshwater Zyneg-

matacean algae, are present though not common. P. circula can live in damp soil or ephemeral to permanent shallow freshwater sites.
Rare fungal spores were noted in the sample.
The diversity and abundance of the arboreal assemblage indicates a mixed hardwood forest with associated pines, not unlike
parts of central Louisiana today. Scarcity of
herbaceous pollen and freshwater alga cysts
suggests that the forest cover was closed and
open areas were limited in the TVOR area at
the time of deposition.
Age Determination: The presence of
"Compositae, short spine" indicates an age no
older than about 11 million years (Styzen,
1996; Wrenn, 1996).
TVORCore
Sample 3; Core 3, 0.15-0.17cm; Total Depth
1.67-1.69m
The original preparations of this sample
were plagued at the end of acid digestion by
the precipitation of a white gel that prevented
further processing. Experimentation led to
boiling such samples in concentrated HCL
acid for up to 30 minutes to solubilize the gel,
followed by immediate sieving to wash out
whatever ions were causing the gel to form.
This seemed to work well and resulted in the
recovery of a rich assemblage of pollen.
The general aspects of this assemblage
are similar to that reported for the Sample 1
(0.64-0.66m) of the TVOR core, and TVOR SE,
reported above. This sample assemblage also
is dominated by Pinus, but differs in that it
contains a lower diversity of arboreal pollen,
somewhat more common herbaceous pollen,
and abundant Pseudoschizaea circula cysts.
The assemblage suggests hardwoods
were less abundant, open areas in the forest
were more common at this time, and wetter
conditions may have existed for part of the
year. The Pseudoschizaea circula cysts indicate at least wet soil or shallow, standing water for part of the year.

TVOR core samples (Table 2) produced only
rare palynomorphs, or common phytoclasts
(plant fragments). These samples have been
highly altered and most organics have been

the additional palynological work is that the
two samples that yielded age diagnostic material are even more out of synchronization
with the mammal information than the prior
palynological results. TVOR SE at a level
which has yielded most ofthe vertebrate material so far, and 1.67-1.69 m in the TVOR Core
indicate an age no older than about 11 million years (Styzen, 1996; Wrenn, 1996).

Preliminary phytolith analysis is provided by Caroline Stromberg (Graduate Student, University of California, Berkeley), who
is studying the phytoliths of the east Texas
Miocene mammal sites. Rock samples from
TVOR, TVOR S, TVOR SE, Stonehenge, Discovery and Persimmon Barrow were processed
for phytoliths. Phytoliths are microscopic
silica bodies produced in the tissue of many
plants. They have been employed extensively
in Holocene paleoecological investigations (see
Piperno, 1988 for review), but are for historical reasons seldom used in sediments older
than the Pleistocene (but cf. Rovner, 1971;
Smith, 1996 b). Because of their composition,
phytoliths are more durable than palynomorphs and other organic fossils, and therefore, particularly useful in facies lacking or
low in organic material, like, for example, the
sediments at Fort Polk. Phytoliths are taxonomically sensitive, especially within the
grass family (Rapp and Mulholland, 1992),
and phytolith assemblages convey information
on a similar (to more local) spatial scale than
palynomorphs.

DISC I Core
Four samples from DISC I Core (Table
3) were processed but yielded only occasional
plant fragments andlor inertinite. Inertinite
is "inert" organic matter, "charcoal", which
may not have formed by burning, but may
have oxidized by immersion in oxygenated
waters.
One sample (8.88-8.91m) produced a
couple fecal pellets of unknown origin. No useful information was obtained from these
samples.

Palynological results
This work adds TVOR SE and DISC 1 to

(Zhao and Pearsall, 1998) and Piperno
(Piperno, 1988). Briefly, 20 g of sediment
sample was sieved through a 350 f.lm sieve,
and the fine fraction was treated with concentrated HCl to dissolve CaC0 3, a common
cement in this type of sediment. Clays were
eliminated from the samples using clay dispersion (with Na 2 H 2 EDTA) and sedimentation. The samples were oxidized using
Schultze's solution (50% concentrated nitric
acid and 50% saturated solution of potassium
chlorate). Phytoliths were separated from inorganic silica using heavy liquid (ZnI 2) at a
specific gravity of about 2.3, and finally
mounted in Meltmount (refractive index=1.539).
Over 200 grains with a diameter> 5 f.lm
from each sample (coarse and fine fraction)
were examined and counted under the optical microscope, at 1000X magnification. In addition' a "quick-scan" of the rest of each slide
was made to confirm that the pattern emerging from the count was consistent across the
slide. 200 grains is the minimum number that
will give a representative sample of the
phytoliths on the slide, according to Pearsall
(1989) .
The phytoliths were classified into
groups more or less according to Alexandre et
al. (1997):
(1) saddle, diagnostic of Choridoid C4 short
grasses;
(2) (Panicoid) dumb-bell and cross, diagnostic
of Panicoid C4 tall grasses;
(3) elongated, point and fan-shaped, as well
as conical, keeled, pyramidal, Stipa-type and
simply-lobate dumb-bells of Fredlund and
Tieszen (1994), taken as diagnostic of PooidJ
Festucoid C3 grasses, but includes a lot of
forms, e.g. elongates, that are produced by all
grasses;
(4) circular crenate, diagnostic of Palmae;
(5) circular rugose and other phytoliths (e.g.
tracheids with. bordered pits) diagnostic of
dicots and woody flora;
(6) unclassified.

26

Fredlund and Tieszen's (1994) distinction between diagnostic (Panicoid) and nondiagnostic (non-Panicoid) dumb-bells (Stipatype and simply-lobate) was followed, contra
Alexandre et al. (1997), and the non-diagnostic dumb-bells were lumped with elongates,
point and fan-shaped (group (3). This is done
to give a more accurate estimate of C3 vs. C4
grasses in the flora.
A rough estimate of the proportion of
woody flora in the assemblage is given by d.p,
where d is the dicotyledon/woody phytoliths,
and p is the Poaceae phytoliths (Alexandre et
al. 1997). Phytoliths diagnostic of woody
plants, other than circular rugose, were added
to d. The dominance of C3 vs .. C4 grasses is
indicated by a comparison of number of Pooid
and Panic aid short cells.

Result
All samples except TVOR S contained a
lot of CaC0 3 , in particular Persimmon Barrow. The organic content was very low in all
samples, but analysis of the residue after
phytolith preparation showed that a few
palynomorphs, mainly fern spores, had been
preserved. TVOR, Stonehenge, Dicovery and
Persimmon Barrow were especially rich in
clay.
In an initial analysis using only 10 g of
sediment, all samples proved unproductive for
phytoliths. When the process was repeated,
increasing the amount of processed sediment
to 20-25 g, TVOR, TVOR SE, and Stonehenge
yielded some phytoliths, while the rest of the
samples once again appeared barren. The
phytoliths in the three productive samples
were commonly etched (displaying etch-pits
a few f.lm in diameter), broken or partly dissolved. Only a few were in pristine condition.
This could be due to a diagenetic environment
with high pH associated with the presence of
CaC0 3 , in which the solubility of silica is particularly high (John Jones, 2000, pers. comm.).
Additional potential preservational biases are
covered in the following discussion.

in an overall more seasonal climate. They do
grow in Louisiana today.
Normally C4 grasses would be expected
to dominate in subtropical to tropical
savannahs. The dominance of C3 grasses could
therefore be related to the timing of evolution,
migration into, and dominance of C4 grasses
in the area rather than be strictly tied to ecological factors.

Discussion (Table 4)
The partly decomposed state of most
phytoliths presents a problem when analyzing the flora, even with the very basic approach employed here. Bulliforms (including
keystone-shaped), elongates, and trichomes
are readily identifiable even if very poorly
preserved, while other, more delicate and more
diagnostic ones are hard to identify if broken
or etched. For example, highly diagnostic
Panicoid dumb-bells, as well as Stipa-type
dumb-bells and simply-lobate dumb-bells
(Fredlund and Tieszen 1994) are very likely
to be broken, and therefore often unidentifiable. This produces a bias in the counts of
phytolith shapes, and a bias that potentially
varies between samples. The comparative lack
of diversity among phytolith types in TVOR
could be a result of this bias, or it could reflect a real vegetational signal. The interpretation below is based on the assumption that
the counts accurately reflect what was originally in the sample, i.e. disregarding diagenetic biases and biases associated with identification, but it must be remembered that
there has been considerable diagenesis and
that only 40% of the specimens could be identified.
All sites record presence of woody elements, palms, C3 grasses and C4 grasses; unclassified phytoliths make up about 40% of the
samples, in accordance with the analysis of
Alexandre et al. (1997). At all of the sites, the
d.p value-which broadly gives the proportion
of trees vs. grass-is very low, indicating a
grass savanna habitat (d.p<l corresponds to
savanna (Alexandre et aI., 1997). This takes
into consideration that woody dicotyledon
phytoliths generally are underrepresented in
comparison to grass phytoliths, because of
differences in durability and production
(Alexandre et al. 1997).
C4 grass is present at all sites, but in very
low numbers. Ii is therefore likely that these
savannas were dominated by C 3 grasses. The
presence of palms at all sites suggests a cli-

INVERTEBRATE ANIMALS
No identifiable invertebrates were recovered. Snail steinkerns, common, for example,
in the upper layers of the DISC conglomerate, are not further identifiable. Invertebrate
shells of either microfossls or macrofossils
have not been recovered in screening done
especially to recover them from surface and
core samples.

LSUMG 11841 from Stonehenge appears
to be a shark tooth lacking its base. According to Robert Purdy (USNM, pers. com.), it
could have come from an animal similar to
the sand tiger shark and could be Miocene.
As it is the only marine form from Stonehenge
Site, the possibility that it is reworked, possibly from Eocene rocks exposed further north,
must also be considered. Eocene marine specimens are mixed with the older (Miocene,
Arikarean) Toledo Bend mammalian fauna of
east Texas (Albright, 1991; Manning, 1990).
The lack of other reworked specimens from
Stonehenge after six years of screening suggests that this may not be reworking, but the

28

dark gray color of the specimen and one other
possible tooth piece even more fragmentary,
which is unlike the brown color of most
Stonehenge specimens, indicates the possibility of reworking. Young sharks tend to stay
near shore (Robert Purdy, pers. com.), and the
small size of LSUMG 11841 suggests that it
was young. Other evidence (Figure 44, p. 71)
places Stonehenge among the more marine influenced of the Fort Polk Miocene Sites.

Otoliths (fish inner ear bones) offer an
opportunity for additional characterization of
the fish fauna, but would normally be destroyed by the acid treatment used to break
down bulk samples from Fort Polk for screening. An additional effort was made to see if
they could be recovered through a separate
process. Samples from the following sites were
dis aggregated in water with no added chemicals and screened. Amount of sediment
screened is given in kilograms and pounds in
parentheses after the site name. Sites studied included: Gully (2.3; 5), Shamrock (2.3; 5),
TVOR (2.3; 5), TVOR SE (1.4; 3), Discovery
(2.3; 5). No otoliths were recovered. They were
probably dissolved in acidic ground water. The
lack of invertebrate shell where steinkerns
indicate it was originally abundant, such as
in the upper layers of the DISC conglomerate, probably has the same cause.

Ray teeth were the first fossils from

fossils remain rare at TVOR SE, but the fact
that it and TVOR S are the only sites to yield
more than the single ray tooth from TVOR
(Schiebout, 1997b) is suggestive of possible
greater marine influence at these sites, which
stratigraphy (Figure 44) also suggests.

Fish material was studied iIi comparison with modern Louisiana specimens in the

with theAMNH fish collection, shown in consultation with C. Lavet Smith. Unidentifiable
fish teeth, and bone and scale fragments remain common in Fort Polk Miocene screening. Some are unidentifiable because they are
fragmentary, and others are simply not distinctive enough to assign to any particular
taxon. Remains of four additional fish, drum,
sunfish, sucker, and bowfin, all taxa presently
part of the freshwater fish fauna of modern
Louisiana, have been recognized since publication of Schiebout (1997b). The similarity of
the Miocene and modern fish fauna is in sharp
contrast to the differences between modern

the earlier modernization of fish fauna seen
elsewhere.

Amphibia are rare because of initial fragility, lack of identifiable features on small
bone fragments, and possibly, rarity in a time
of sea retreat and lowering of water table
which could have resulted in loss of habitat
for some. They should be less common in the
fossil record at Fort Polk than mammals,
many of which have a dozen molars, each identifiable to genus. Amphibian bones are also
less likely to stand reworking than the enamel
of teeth, and amphibian teeth would generally be so tiny that they would go through our
screens. The two jaws seen in Figure 28A
(LSUMG 4160 from Stonehenge) are probably
from frogs or salamanders because of the

condyle and cylindrical sacral diapophyses,
and the pelobatid differing in having the urostyle fused to the sacrum. Holman (1995, p.
87) comments that ontogenetic and individual
variations in ilia and sacra are a problem in
identifying Pleistocene taxa. Since these are
the skeletal elements generally used for identification of fossil anurans from disarticulated
bones because they relate to the mode of locomotion (Holman, 1995, p.85), and because the
available Fort Polk specimen is broken, more
exact identification will not be attempted. The
genus Bufo is found in the late Miocene
(Holman, 1995, p. 26), and this specimen could
well have come from an individual of Bufo.

In the period since Schiebout (1997b) was
written, the idea that loose teeth can be used
to recognize crocodilian genera seems less certain, so only Alligator is recognized in this list,
instead of Alligator sp. and Gavialosuchus.

Non-diagnostic snake vertebrae are also

colubrines and natricines below, such as
LSUMG 9122 (Figure 29A), which has double

Vertebrae must be from the trunk region to
be identifiable. Neither the natricine (related
to living water snakes) nor the colubrine (related to living rat snakes and racers) material is sufficient to be identified as a Miocene
genus. Both types are common in Louisiana
today.
Holman (1977), in a study of snakes from
the Myers Farm late Miocene fauna from Nebraska, considered the animals to have been
living in a subtropical climate, the natricines
as aquatic or semiaquatic seekers of invertebrate or fish prey, and the colubrines as fossorial or cursorial seekers of invertebrate or rodent prey.

Alligator teeth and trionychid shell

LSUMG 9148 was originally considered
to be a very small felid. Baskin (1998) mentions a feliform carnivore which has sometimes been placed in the Mustelidae,
Stenogale, from the Thomas Farm locality of
Florida (Early Hemingfordian). It is slightly
larger than Miomustela, and older, but its
existence suggests the possibility that other

Miomustela, might be around the Fort Polk

omnivorous procyonine.

Description On LSUMG 9148 (3.5 mm estimatedA-P, 1.8 mmT), a lower carnasial and
the most diagnostic tooth, the loss of the posterior root and some enamel at the
posterolingual edge makes it impossible to
characterize the area in detail, but the break
is low enough on the protoconid posterior face
to rule out a substantial metaconid or talonid.
LSUMG 4521 is 2.0mm A-P and 1.6 mm T,
and LSUMG 4758 is 3.7 A-P and 1.9 T.
Discussion Baskin (1998b) gives the range
of Miomustela as early Hemingfordian to the
base of the early Clarendonian, and the Fort
Polk specimens are in the size range of Martes
(Plionictis) ogygia or Miomustela cf
madisonae discussed by Voorhies (1990) from
Nebraska. The morphology and occlusal and
labial surface wear is similar in LSUMG 9148
and the lower carnasial ofAMNH 100010 (cast
of type CM 848) Miomustela madisonae (M.
Clarendonian, Lower Madison Valley, Gallatin
Co. Montana). The metaconid of 9148 was
probably smaller estimating from the broken
surface. LSUMG 4521 would be a reasonably
sized reduced M2 of the animal yielding
LSUMG 9148. LSUMG 4758 could belong

small form such as Cynorca or Dyseohyus. The
identity of the cusps in L8UMG 4179 is uncertain, but they are closely appressed, and
the largest enamel surface of the fragment
could reasonably have been the exterior of an
upper premolar. Molars have prominent cingula which seem likely to have left some trace.
The cusps may be the twinned main cusp from
a P3. Twinning of this cusp is a feature seem
in some Dyseohyus (Woodburne, 1969, p.313).
Woodburne (1969, p. 286) reported Cynorca
proterua and Dyseohyus stirtoni from the Trinity Pit 1 locality of east Texas, indicating that
small peccaries were present on the Gulf
Coastal plain in the Barstovian. Wright (1998, Fig.

and .0'seohyus from the Early Barstovian to
the beginning of the Late Late Barstovian.

Woodburne (1969, p. 277) calls Hesperhys a
large form that obviously has '" nothing to do

Hesperhys and some Cynorca ("Cynorca

Discussion The single Fort Polk premolar
seems sufficient evidence to recognize the
presence of an oreodont, but too little for definite further assignment. In characterizing
Merychyus, Lander (1998) mentions its small
size and P 2 -P 4 being "complexly crested". He
lists it as ranging through the Miocene
(Lander, 1998).
LSUMG 3323 is morphologically similar
to L PI of AMNH 72389, Merychyus from
Sheep Creek Fm., Nebraska; AMNH 72389,
Merychyus from Railroad Canyon in Idaho;
and AMNH 31802, Merychyus from Phillips

synonymized with Aepycamelus. Honey et aI.
(1998, p.458) comment that, ".. the systematics of both Megatylopus (Voorhies and Corner, 1986) and Aepycamelus are not well understood ... ".
Aepycamelus is a large Barstovian camel
which is known from Trinity River Pit 1 (Early
Barstovian) (Honey et aI., 1998) and the Cold
Spring Local Fauna (patton, 1969), both in the
Fleming Formation of east Texas. It ranges
from the Late Hemphillian to the beginning
ofthe Late Hemingfordian (Honey et aI., 1998,
p. 453, Fig. 30.6). Given that the systematics
of Aepycamelus and Megatylopus are are not
well worked out, and the Fort Polk material
is scanty, questionable referral to Aepycamelus
seems reasonable.

Locality DISC.
Description The medial crest on the
metapodial epiphysis is not complete across
the distal face.
Discussion LSUMG 11212 is not from a
perissodactyl because the medial crest is incomplete. The epiphysis is from a juvenile,
which would clearly have been a large adult,
like Megatylopus or Aepycamelus.
LSUMG 11221 (5.4 cm W, 2.5 cm dorsoventrally) is similar in morphology to camel
unciforms from the Lapara Creek Fauna
(Early Clarendonian) of the Goliad Formation
in east Texas, and falls within their size range.
It is larger than TMM 31132-426 (5.1 cm W,

Description-LSUMG 4482 measures 5.1AP. A parastyle, mesostyle, and metastyle are

crests merge but do not contact the mesostyle.
LSUMG 9449, a strongly worn small artiodactyl premolar, is 4.6A-P and 2.0 T.
Discussion-It is clear that LSUMG 4482
represents a genus new to the Fort Polk Miocene fauna. Positive identification to genus
of a Barstovian small ruminant on the basis
of two premolars, one incomplete and the other
well worn, is not possible, because much of
the taxonomy hinges on skull shape, diastemata, incisor arrangement and other features currently unknown for this animal. The
artiodactyls reported from the Barstovian of
east Texas are too large to have yielded these
teeth, with one possible exception. Taylor and

and 2.8 cm dorso-ventrally.
Discussion-LSUMG 9280 was compared at
AMNH to three east Texas specimens, labeled
P. francisi, with deciduous teeth. It is similar
in morphology and slightly larger. In specimen AMNH 68931A (Trinity River Pit 1,
Texas), a tooth very morphologically similar
to LSUMG 9280 was the only molar-like tooth
erupted. It measured 15.9 mm A-P, 7.9 mm
transversely on the anterior selene and 9.6
on the posterior. In AMNH 33067 (Woodville
# 1 Locality, Tyler Co., TX), the deciduous
tooth is slightly more worn than in AMNH
68931A, and the first selene of M2 is just beginning to erupt. The deciduous tooth measures 23.9 mm A-P, 8.1 mm transversely
across the anterior selene and 10.3mm at the
posterior third, and Ml is 21.1 mm long.
AMNH 33066 from east of Woodville, TX, has
a deciduous tooth measuring 18.1 mmA-P, and
10.3 at the posterior third. Its Ml is 19.9 mm
A-P and 10.2 transversely.
According to Prothero (1998a, p. 432), in
protoceratids, "The astragalus develops a distinct distal keel, and the proximal side of the
sustentacular facet is concave, a feature
unique to the group." The postcranial material is not distinctive at the species level, but
seems reasonably ass.ociated with the Fort
Polk Miocene prosynthetocerid on the basis
of size and morphological similarity to postcranial elements assigned to prosynthetocerids
from east Texas sites roughly similar in age.
LSUMG3636, an astragalus, is very similar
to TMM 31219-261 (4.1 cm wide and 2.6 cm
dorso-ventrally, Prosyntheroceras from Cold
Spring Local Fauna, Donahoe Farm, San
Jacinto Co., TX) in both size and morphology
and about the same size as TMM 30936-112
(4.5 cm wide, 2.5cm dorso-ventrally,
?Syntheroceras from the Goliad Formation in
Live Oak Co, TX). LSUMG 3641, a tibia fragment, is similar in size and morphology to
TMM 31242-90 (3.8 cm wide, 2.8 cm dorsoventrally, Prosyntheroceras from the

Webb (1976) discuss aPseudoparablastomeryx
from the Fleming Formation of San Jacinto
County, Texas on which Ml ranges from 6.06.9 mm wide and M2 ranges from 6.8 to 8.0
mm inAP. The dp4 shown in Fig. 3D (Taylor
and Webb, 1976) is morphologically similar to
the molars, but smaller, suggesting that a
Pseudoparablastomeryx deciduous tooth could
have yielded a fragment the size and shape of
LSUMG4482.
LSUMG 9449 can not be definitely referred to the same taxon as LSUMG 4482, as
there may have been several Fort Polk Miocene artiodactyls in this size range for which
diagnostic material is currently lacking, but
it is similar morphologically to P 3 of AMNH
53395, Pseudoblastomeryx scotti from the
early Barstovian Olcott Formation in Sioux
County, Nebraska.AMNH 53395 P 3 measures
5.8 mm A-P and 2.9 mm T. Its P 4 measures
6.3 mm A-P and 3.0 mm T.

Texas Miocene in the collections of the Texas

which morphologically similar specimens are
found. Not all the Texas specimens are identified to genus.
LSUMG 11224 is morphologically similar and
approximately 3 mm shorter than TMM
31242-104 and TMM 31242-98 (Merychippus,
Miocene Fleming Fm., site 4, San Jacinto Co.)
and about the same size as TMM 31242-23
and 31242-66 from the same site. It is 5 mm
shorter and narrower than TMM 40196-1 from
Miocene, Cold Spring Local Fauna (Red Bluff,
Frick Trinity River Site, San Jacinto Co.).
LSUMG 3638 is morphologically similar and
only slightly smaller than TMM 40068-18
(Parahippus cf P. texan us, Miocene,
Arikareen, Oakville Fm., Cedar Run Site,
Washington Co.)
LSUMG 11220 (3.5 cm W, 2.6 cm L) is similar
in morphology to TMM 31200 (2 cm W, 1.5 cm
L, Merychippus , Site 3, Polk Co.) and to TMM
31242-48 (2.2 cm W, 1.6 cm L, Merychippus,

LSUMG 11226 is very similar in morphology
to TMM 31219-205 (San Jacinto Co., Site 3),
but 3 cm shorter. It is only 4 mm shorter than
TMM 31242-6 (San Jacinto Co., Site 4).

Order PERISSODACTYLA
Family EQUIDAE
Continuing surface search of the DISC
cluster sites has yielded a small number of
specimens additional to those described in
Schiebout (1997b), most notably, a fine maxilla fragment (LSUMG 11216) and a second
mandible. The mandible (LSUMG 11212) differs from LSUMG 3628 (the original Fort Polk
Miocene first discovery specimen) in being
slightly more worn but shows no significant
morphological differences. The lower dental
material presents no evidence for the presence
of more than one taxon of equid at the DISC
sites, but there is morphological difference
among the upper teeth available now, versus
the sample in Schiebout (1997b), particularly
in the elaboration of the fossettes. Possibly, a
single variable population was present, although the presence of several horses (up to
5) at other Gulf Coast sites in the mid and
late Miocene suggests that the two forms of
upper molar probably belonged to two taxa,
but the mix of characters makes it difficult to
assign the more derived (elongate protocones,
complex plications) unequivocally to a different taxon.

relatively smaller posterior process than TMM

LSUMG 11211 (4.9cm W, 4.2 cm dorso-ventrally), is morphologically similar but smaller
than TMM 31183-25 (equid, 6.7cm W, 4.6 cm
dorso-ventally, Polk Co., Site 2).

LSUMG 11219 may have obscured some details.
Discussion Merychippus was placed in
quotes in Schiebout (1997b), and is not at this
time, because work such as MacFadden (1998)
has somewhat clarified its relationships.
Merychippus gunteri is recognized as being a
little-derived member of a clade leading to the
hipparionine forms such as M. goorisi. and M.
inszgnis (Hulbert and MacFadden, 1991, Table
1) which have more elaborate fossettes. The
most recent cladistic characterizations do not
allow sure separation of the Fort Polk Miocene
specimens, but placing the teeth with complex
internal plications with these seems to obscure
what almost certainly were important features.
The two good specimens of lower jaws,
LSUMG 11219 are placed with M. gunteri on
their lack of prominent protostylids, a M.
gunteri character.

LSUMG 11216 P4. LSUMG 11210 also is similar in dental pattern to LSUMG 11216.
The hypoconal groove is open on all these
upper teeth.
Discussion-In hipparionine Merychippus,
the protocone-protoloph connection does not
form until a very late wear stage, persistent
hypocone grooves do not form lakes, and well
developed protostylids occur on P 3-P4 (Hulbert
and MacFadd~n, 1991). M goorisi is separated
from M insignis in part by having complex
internal fossette plications (Hulbert and
MacFadden, 1991, Fig. 10, node 23). It occurs
in the Cold Spring Fauna of east Texas
(MacFadden, 1998).
The current allocation of specimens to
taxa leaves no derived lower teeth in the collection to ascribe to the hipparionine
Merychippus. This fact and the fact that the
protocones appear to be likely to connect to
the protolophs soon in all the Merychippus cf.
M goorisi uppers, argue towards recognizing
a single merychippine, so recognition of M
goorisi is tempered with a "cf."

lower tooth. LSUMG V-11212 is a metapodial
4.0 cm wide.
Discussion-Prothero and Serreno (1980)
have described four rhinos for the Miocene
Gulf Coast, two dwarf and two large forms
(Aphelops and 'Jeleoceras). The Shamrock
rhino is definitely a large form, but would fall
in the size range of either large animal, and
both range throughout the Barstovian
(Prothero, 1998b). Prothero (1998b) lists
strong antecrochets as a teleoceratine character, so their absence indicates the Shamrock
rhino is best assigned to Aphelops. The rhino
tooth scrap from DISC (LSUMG 11 775) could
have come from Aphelops. LSUMG 11212, a
metapodial, is similar to TMM 31057-148 (4.0
cm wide) an Aphelops megalodus metapodial
from the Miocene of east Texas, Fleming Formation, Barringer Farm Site in Polk Co.
In general, Aphelops has been considered
a browser and 'Jeleoceras a more hippo-like
grazer (Prothero, 1998b), but recent
geochemical studies by MacFadden (1998) on
Florida Aphelops and 'Jeleoceras, both before
and after the spread
, in Florida of C4 grasses
at 4.5 Ma, indicate that both ate browse and
C3 grass prior to the shift, Aphelops was a
browser after it, and 'Jeleoceras a mixed feeder/
C4 grazer. According to MacFadden (1998) the
modern black rhino is a reasonable analog for
Aphelops and the white rhino for 'Jeleoceras.

A third taxon of castorid (beaver) is
present at Fort Polk, in addition to the two
small species of Eucastor described below, a
relatively large form represented, so far, only
by a labially-convex fragment of the labial
surface of upper incisor enamel, LSUMG
11528,9.6 mm wide (Figure 37A). The incisor
appears to have been approximately twice the
width of Eucastor tortus upper incisors figured
by Xu (1995), and thus more than twice as
large as the largest beavers previously known
from the Fort Polk Miocene. Unfortunately,
nothing more can be said about the animal
until more diagnostic material is found.

Subfamily CASTOROIDINAE
GENUS EUCASTOR
Xu (1995) has recommended synonymizing Monosaulax with Eucastor in his revision
of the Family Castoridae. Of the fifteen species previously assigned to Eucastor and
Monosaulax, Xu (1995, p. 117) retains only two
North American species, E. tortus (lacks a
parafossette in Ml and M2 and a metafossettid
in all lower molars)and E. pansus (smallest
member of the genus, "rabbbit pattern" molars). According to Xu (1995), in the "rabbit
pattern", the hypostria (id) and mesostria(id)
are well developed, the labial end of the
hypoflexid is opposite the lingual end of the
mesoflexid, separating elongate parafossetteids and metafossettids, and there is
no parastria(id) or metastria(id).

Locality Gully (LSUMG 4818,4165), DISC
(LSUMG 3448, 4470), Persimmon Barrow
(10278).
Description LSUMG 4818 is a right P 4 with
its posterolingual edge missing enamel. It has
no metafossette or lingual striids, and the
hypostriid extends a bit over half the crown
length. The mesofossette is small, oval, and
opposite the hypoflexid, which extends approximately 3/4 the width of the tooth crown.
LSUMG 3448, R P 4' has an anterofossettid,
para-fossettid, mesoflexid, hypoflexid, and
meta-fossetid. The mesoflexid and hypoflexid
almost meet, with the mesoflexid extending
almost 2/3 of the crown width. On the last
lower molar, LSUMG 4165, the hypostriid
extends approximately 3/4 of the way down
the tooth and the mesostriid extends approximately approximately 113. There are no other
striids. The hypoflexid and mesoflexid each
extend about halfway medially, with the medial end of the mesoflexiid anterior to the
medial end of the hypoflexiid. The tooth has a
wide parafossettid and a metafossettid. The
width of the parafossettid was a factor in deciding that this tooth is M 3 , because
parafossettids widen posteriorly in LSUMG
10278, the only specimen in which more than
a single tooth is available. The metaflexid and
hypoflexid almost meet medially. LSUMG
4470 shows the same pattern as 4165, except
the mesostriid is shorter, extending across less
than a fourth of the tooth.
LSUMG 10278, the most complete individual beaver specimen from Fort Polk, has a
consistent pattern on all four lower teeth.
Each tooth has a strong hypostriid. P 4 has a
faint parastriid and metastriid and mesostriid
extending 2/3 of the height of the tooth. The
molars have a small notch for each mesostriid.
A long hypoflexid (over half the tooth width)
lies posterior to a shorter mesoflexid. A
metafossetid lies lingual to the end of the
hypoflexid. It is longest in the premolar and
becomes progressively smaller in posterior

Locality Stonehenge (LSUMG 4774), DISC

Description On LSUMG 4774, the
hypostriid extends down halfthe tooth length,
there is no mesostriid, and there is only a
small notch at the edge of the parafossettid.
The hypoflexid and mesoflexid meet but don't
merge, and the parafossettid extends almost
to the hypoflexid medially. On LSUMG 4175,
the hypostria extends half the current tooth
height and there is a faint mesostria on the
lower 2/3 of the tooth. LSUMG 4175 has an
open root and is triangular with the
postmetafossette and its corner broken. The
specimen has two fossettes, a wide
metafossette and a small postmetafossette.
Discussion-The animal is the right size, but
no molars are available to determine the presence or absence of the "rabbit pattern" on
them. The hypoflexus and mesoflexus on the
fourth premolars almost meet as expected in
the rabbit pattern. The meostria(id)s are absent or faint, not strong as mentioned by Xu
(1995) for Eucastor pansus.

Discussion The Fort Polk animals are
smaller than E. pansus, for which size information is given in Xu (1995) and the size difference is statistically significant (Table 7).
The labial edge of the hypoflexids and the lingual
edge of the mesoflexids are not opposite, so these
animals did not have the ''rabbit pattern".

pansus can be compared to Eucastor n. sp. specimens. ill Fort Polk Eucastor cf E. pans~ the
hypoflexus (id) and mesoflexus (id) on the fourth

seen in Eucastor n. sp. specimens.

ered a point in favor of the age of the sites
being quite early in the Barstovian (Schiebout,
1994). Later work showed that many of the
small animals are particularly small in comparison to members of the same genera from
elsewhere (Schiebout et aI., 1998). Initial results examining DISC sites (from lowest to
highest: Stonehenge, Gully, and DISC conglomerates), also suggested a size increase in
Copemys in western Louisana through time.
Further screening and analysis, however, produced a very different picture without stratigraphic size trends (Figure 39), emphasizing
the value of continuing processing to extract
more statistically significant numbers of specimens.

Description-M3 is subtriangular and expands posterolabially. There is only one ridge
on the tooth, here named the protoloph. It is
robust and complete, connecting a large protocone with the paracone. No parastyle,
protoconule, metaloph, metacone, or metaconule are present. The anterior cingulum
extends from paracone to protocone and
projects slightly anteriorly. The posterior cingulum forms the posterior edge of the tooth.
The anterior basin is narrow antero-posteriorly. The trigon is a large triangular basin
with numerous rugosities.
LSUMG 3388 is subrectangular and

terior to the metaconid. This specimen is included in Petauristodon mainly because of
slightly rugose enamel in the basin.
LSUMG 9563 is subrectangular. The
metaconid is larger than the protoconid and
both ofthem are robust. There is a small cusp
situated in front of the protoconid. The hypoconid is distinct, but the entoconid is indistinct; however, the edge surrounding the entoconid is thickened. No mesostylid is present
and the mesoconid is very faint. There is no
distinct rugose enamel on the tooth, but the
tooth edge is uneven.
Discussion-Rugose enamel in the molars is
characteristic ofPetauristinae. The small size
and the rugose enamel are the main reason
to assign LSUMG 4624 to this subfamily.
Petauristodon is the only known fossil genus
offlying squirrel in NorthAmerica. LSUMG
4624 is smaller than M3 in most species in
the genus and is slightly larger than M3 of P.
minimus from Barstow (Bastovian), California. It differs from the latter in having rugose enamel mainly in the trigon basin instead
of on the protoloph and metaloph, a large and
broad posterior basin, and much more posterior expansion of the posterior edge. It is similar to an Asian species, Meinia asiatica from
Shanwang (middle Miocene), Shandong,
China, in basic morphology, but differs from
the latter in being slightly smaller and lacking a )TIetacone.
LSUMG 9563 is tentatively included in the
Petauristinae, mainly based on its small size, uneven edge of the tooth, and presence of a small
cusp in front of the protocone. It is smaller than
P 4 of most known species of flying squirrel and
slightly larger than P. minimus.

Locality TVOR (LSU MG 4623, 4625);
DISC (LSUMG 3278).
Description-LSUMG 4623 is small and
rectangular. The anterior cingulum is slightly
convex and extends lingually 2/3 of the tooth
width. The parastyle is distinct, with a small
cusp. The protocone is slightly larger than
the paracone and metacone, which are
sub equal. The protoloph and metaloph form
complete ridges connecting protocone with
paracone and metacone, respectively. No
protoconule, metaconule, or mesostyle is
present and the posterior cingulum is reduced.
It extends from the middle of the tooth posteriorly to the protocone.
LSUMG 4625 is a deciduous tooth. It is
small and roughly triangular in occlusal view.
The parastyle is greatly expanded anteriorly,
and has a distinct parastyle cusp. The anterior cingulum is reduced. The protocone is
larger than both paracone and metacone.
There is no mesostyle. The protoloph is complete and ridge-like, lacking a protoconule.
The metaloph extends postero-obliquely from
protocone to metacone. The metaconule is
distinct, large, and interrupts the metaloph
at its midpoint. The posterior cingulum is low
around the metacone and higher near the protocone.
LSUMG 3278 is rectangular in crown
view. The protoconid and metaconid are close
together on the anterior edge, so that the anterior edge is much narrower than the posterior. The metaconid is larger than the protoconid, and there are no anteroconid,
metalophid, mesoconid, or mesostylid. The entoconid is indistinct, merged with a high posterior cingulum. The hypoconid is more labial
than the protoconid.

(Pratt and Morgan, 1989, p.95). LSUMG 4623
is assigned to Nototamias because of its small
size, complete protoloph and metaloph, and
absence of the protoconule, metaconule, and
mesostyle.
The species of Nototamias now include
N. hulberti from the Thomas Farm Local
Fauna (Late Early Hemingfordian), Florida
(Pratt and Morgan, 1989), N. sp. from the
Wounded Knee local fauna, Sharps Formation
(Early Arikareean), South Dakota, and N.
quadratus from the McCann Canyon local
fauna (Harrison Formation, Late Arikareean),
Nebraska and from Monroe Creek Formation,
South Dakota (Korth, 1992). Pratt and Morgan (1989) referred Tamia atelesfrom Barstow
beds (Barstovian),of southern California (Hall,
1930) to Nototamias, but this species is considered by us to be Tamias, following Sutton
and Korth (W95). The specimen LSUMG 4623
is about the size of the largest Ml of N.
hulberti and smaller than Ml or M2 of N.
quadratus. It is similar to N. hulberti in having a complete protoloph and metaloph, and
lacking a protoconule, metaconule, and
mesostyle; however, it differs from the latter
in having a distinct parastyle and reduced anterior and posteror cingula. LSUMG 4623
differs from N. quadratus and N. sp. of the
Wounded Knee fauna in the absence of a
mesostyle and reduced anterior and posterior
cingula.
The specimen LSUMG 3278 is considered Nototamias rather than Tamias mainly
based on its small size and absence of a
mesoconid.

with paracone and metacone equal in size.
The metaconule is distinct and moderately
large. The protoloph is narrow, and there is
no protoconule. The parastyle is distinct and
projects anteriorly. The mesostyle is small, but
distinct.
The lingual side of LSUMG 3798 is broken. It is small and sub quadrate in occlusal
view. The paracone and metacone are equal
in size and bulbous. The protoconule is absent. The metaconule is distinct, but only
moderately developed. The parastyle is
minute and the mesostyle is distinct, but
small. The protoloph is narrow, The metaloph
connects the metacone and metaconule, but
there is a groove between metaconule and
protocone.The anterior cingular shelf is broad
and low, terminating anteriorly and labially
at the protocone. The posterior cingulum is
narrow and terminates lingually at the metacone.
LSUMG 3785 is sub quadrate and slightly smaller than LSUMG 3798. The paracone
and metacone are equal in size, but the paracone is more deeply worn The protocone is
broad and deeply worn. The protoconule is
absent and the metaconule distinct, but small.
Both protoloph and metaloph are narrow.
There is a narrow enamel ridge extending
from the metaconule towards the protocone,
but it would not connect with the protocone
until the tooth was deeply worn. The mesostyle is large and the parastyle smalL The
anterior and posterior cingula are low and
narrow.
LSUMG 3322 and 9159 are almost identical in morphology. LSUMG 3322 is almost
unworn and LSD MG 9159 is slightly worn.
LSUMG 9652 is also similar to LSUMG 3322
and 9159 in morphology, but its posterolabial

Ius sp. from the Barstow Formation may represent anAmmospermophilus. In addition to
being larger, the ground squirrel, SpermophiIus, usually possesses a protoconule and has

corner is missing, so that the hypoconid can
not be seen. All three teeth are rhomboidal in
occlusal view, with posterolabial expansion.
The metaconid is higher, larger, and more
anteriorly situated than the protoconid. The
hypoconid and protoconid are equal in size and
situated anteroposteriorly in line. The entoconid is indistinct. Both mesoconid and mesostylid are absent. The ectolophid is short,
low, and narrow. The anterior cingulum is
higher than the metalophid. Both of them are
V-shaped and lower at their midpoints, surrounding the trigonid basin and connecting
metaconid and protoconid. The trigonid basin is small, oval, and deep, and the talonid
basin is large and deep. The posterolophid is
slender and straight.
Discussion-LSUMG 4867 is grouped here
with Ammospermophilus mainly because of its
small size, distinct metaconule, and metaloph
not reaching the protocone. If it is P\ its parastyle is lower than that of living Ammospermophilus, the antelope squirrels. The specimen is also similar to that of MiospermophiIus wyomingensis from Split Rock Formation
(early Hemingfordian), Wyoming (Black, 1963,
p. 193), in size and morphology. Its very distinctive metaconule is more similar to that of
M. wyomingensis than to Ammospermophilus,
which suggests that it is also possible this
specimen represents a Miospermophilus.
LSUMG. 3798 is referred to Ammospermophilus mainly based on its small size, lack
of protoconule, and moderate development of
the metaconule. This specimen is similar to
A. fossillis from the Cuyama Valley Badland,
California (early Clarendonian) andA.junturensis from the Juntural Basin, Oregon (Clarendonian) in both size and morphology, but
differs from the latter in having a slightly
smaller metaconule. It is slightly smaller than
Miospermophilus sp. from Barstow Formation, Mojave Desert, California (Barstovian).
But they are simirar in morphology: both having a small metaconule and lacking a protoconule, which indicates that Miospermophi-

a large, bulgy metaconule separated from both
metacone and protocone. However, the protoconule is absent (James, 1963), and the metaconule
inAmmospermophilus is a slight swelling on
the metaloph. LSUMG 3798 is also similar to
Tamias ateles in morphology, but slightly larger. Lindsay (1972, p. 27) noticed the morphologic similarity between Tamias and Ammospermophilus and suggested that Ammospermophilus is derived from and is not completely distinguishable from T. ateles in the Barstovian.
LSUMG 3785 is assigned to Ammospermophilus based on its small size, lack of protoconule, and smaller metaconule. LSUMG
3322, 9159, and 9652 are referred to Ammospermophilus based on their small size, indistinctive entoconid, and complete metalophid.
The preservation of lower dentition is poor in
Ammospermophilus fossilis (J ames, 1963): the
crown of P 4 and M2 are broken off and the lingual margin of Ml is missing. LSUMG 3322
is about the same size as A. fossilis; however,
it is difficult to compare it with that ofA. fossilis in detail because of the poor preservation ofA. fossilis. Black (1963, p. 224) referred
Citellusjunturensis (Shotwell and Russell, 1963)
from the Clarendonian (early Pliocene) of Juntura, Oregon, to Ammospermophilus? sp., which
was reassigned to Ammospermophilus junturensis by Korth (1993). Black (1963, p. 225)
summarized a few diagnostic features in the
dentition for Ammospermophilus, which include: small size, low crown height, lack of anteroposterior compression ofMl_2, straight posterolophid curving only at the lingual border, equal
size of the protoconids and hypoconids on M l_2, and
shallow and broad buccal valleys. LSUMG 3322
is similar to A. junturensis in all these characters, and also in size. Lindsay (1972) described a Miospermophilus sp. from the Barstow Formation of southern California. He

62

considered the lower first and second molars
of Miospermophilus to be similar to those of
Tamias and Ammospermophilus; with the following differences among them:Tamias - entoconid indistinct, metalophid more or less
complete, posterolingual corner of tooth angular; Ammospermophilus - entoconid indistinct, metalophid more or less complete, postero-lingual coneI' of tooth sub angular; and
Miospermophilus-entoconid distinct, metalophid incomplete or minute, posterolingual
corner of tooth angular. Small size, absent or
indistinct entoconid, and metalophid more
complete are characteristic of living Ammospermophilus, so they should be considered
synapomophies for Ammospermophilus.
Living members ofthe genusAmmospermophilus occur only in dry areas in western
NorthAmerica. Ammospermophilus interpres,
the Texas antelope squirrel, found in New
Mexico and west Texas (Hall, 1981), has a
range extending eastwards farther than other living species (Whitaker, 1996).The National Audubon Society's Field Guide to North
American Mammals (Whitaker, 1996) describes A. interpres as spotty in distribution,
eating insects, seeds, and plants, and dwelling in burrows, one of which was measured
as 10 m long. If the Fort Polk Miocene specimens do belong with this genus and if there is
some similarity in habit in the Miocene form,
their presence may be additional evidence for
base level drop during formation of the upper
portions of the Castor Creek Member which
include carbonate nodule concentrations. The
interfluves, higher than the incised local
streams, would make a home dryer and more
appropriate for burrowing than floodplains
low on the coastal plain.

VI. PALEOECOLOGY
Schiebout (1997b) recognized that the
absence of rhinoceroses, peccaries, small ruminants, small carnivores, and lower vertebrates was in part a result of the relatively
small amount of work done at that time. The
faunal list now includes all of the above, although medium sized animals such as peccaries, small ruminants like Pseudoparablastomeryx, and oreodonts are very rare. Rarity
of medium-sized animals may be indicative
of an open versus heavily forested environment, based on work by Legendre (1986) on
body-size distributions of animals in various
environments.
Graham (1999, p. 246) pointed out that
the deciduous forest in the North American
Southeast reached its maximum extent during and after the Middle Miocene cooling and
reached Mexico by the Pliocene. By the Barstovian, a mosaic of deciduous forest and
grassland was present in the North American
plains, giving way to grasslands by the
Pliocene as temperatures and seasonal rainfall decreased (Graham, 1999). Palynological

data (p. 22-25) indicate that the TVOR SE region included a mixed hardwood forest with
pines, and that TVOR had less abundant hardwoods than TVOR SE, with more open and
wetter areas in the region. Phytoliths indicate
a grassy savanna habitat associated with all
sites (p. 28), but it must be kept in mind that
40% of them were unidentifiable and that the
phytoliths were affected by diagenesis.
In Schiebout (1997a, b), percentages of
the three most abundant rodent types were
used for estimation of relative amounts of forest and open areas at Fort Polk sites and at
the two Texas Coastal Plain sites from which
good faunas of small animals are available
(Dorsey 1977), Town Bluff Site and Trinity
River Site. Modern heteromyid rodents prefer open areas, and cricetid rodents prefer
wooded areas (Dorsey, 1977). Cricetids make
up the lowest percentage at any of the Fort
Polk Miocene sites (year 2000 counts) and
geomyoids the highest at DrSC (Figure 43);
the DISC distribution is significantly different from that at Stonehenge, Gully, and TVOR
(Table 9). Stonehenge is significantly different from TVOR, having more cricetids and
fewer geomyoids. These distributions would
be consistent with DISC having the least forest cover of the four Fort Polk sites, and with
Stonehenge being wetter and less suitable for
the possibly-burrowing geomyoids than
TVOR. It is interesting to note that distributions at DISC and TVOR from Schiebout
(1997b) and from year 2000 counts are statistically different, indicating new information
arising from the ongoing work, even in common rodents at the longest worked sites (Table 9). East Texas sites Trinity River (71.5%)
and Town Bluff (39.4%) have high percentages of geomyoids (Schiebout, 1997a), higher
than any Fort Polk Miocene site other than
DISC (Figure 44). East Texas was almost certainly dryer than western Louisiana in the
Miocene, as it is today.
Base level changes in the region are considered to have led to stream incision and rel-

atively dryer surface conditions at times in
the Fort Polk area, probably analogous to the
Pleistocene "terraces" seen in modern Louisiana versus the wetter active floodplains. Base
level and sea level changes will be discussed
at greater length under Regional and Global
Changes. Some of the mammals seem indicative of either dryer/upland/more open situations and others of wetter/lowland/more forested situations. All of the Fort Polk environments were relatively near the coast, of course,
and the conglomerates incorporate animals
concentrated from a variety of sub-environments. The rarity of fossil mammals other
than the common rodents means that the presence of animals with particular adaptations
is suggestive that certain environments were
available in the area, but their presence at a
site does not mean that the site included only
their main habitat, and their absence at particular sites is not meaningful.
Possible relative upland or dry land indicators would include the squirrelAmmospermophilus (Stonehenge), the browsing rhino
Aphelops (Shamrock), merychippine horses
with high crowned teeth (DISC, Gully, Persimmon Barrow), an oreodont (DISC), and the
geomyoid rodent '/exomys. Although modern
geomyoids are burrowers, it cannot be certain
that '/exomys was. Wetland or lowland conditions could be needed by the possibly mooselike protoceratids (DISC). The procyonid
(Stonehenge) and the flying squirrel Petauristodon (TVOR) probably needed at least a
partially treed environment.

VII. BIOSTRATIGRAPHY
Vertebrates
Several papers arising from this research
(Schiebout, 1994, 1996, 1997a; Schiebout et
al. 1996) have focused on the age of the Fort
Polk Miocene sites, considering finds from the
DISC conglomerates and surface finds from
the bulldozed areas to indicate an early Late
Barstovian age, in part because of the pres-

66

ence of the rodent Copemys. Lindsay (1995)
redefined the Hemingfordianl Barstovian
boundary as solely determined by the first appearance of Copemys, but Woodburne and
Swisher (1995, p. 347) mention a possible Late
Hemingfordian occurrence of Copemys in
southern California. Copemys is one of the
more abundant rodents at the Fort Polk sites.
Its lowest stratigraphic occurrence at DISC
cluster is at Stonehenge Site and the highest
is the main DISC conglomerate layer. At
TVOR, it occurs at the main TVOR conglomerate, approximately level with the top of the
TVOR core. The fact that it is not present at
TVOR Sand TVOR SE, at which little screening has been done, and Shamrock Site, at
which no screening has been done yet, is inconclusive.
In comparison with a sequence of Miocene local faunas in east Texas (Wilson, 1956;
Tedford et aI., 1987), DISC Site has been considered most closely equivalent to the sites of
the Cold Spring Local Fauna (Schiebout,
1997a). Surface search at the DISC exposure,
just above the main DISC conglomerate, has
yielded a prosynthetocerine jaw similar to the
prosynthetocerine seen in the Cold Spring
Local Fauna, different from the animal seen
in the underlying Burkeville Local Fauna.
Surface search has also yielded a fragment of
gomphothere molar (Schiebout et al. 1997b).
The proboscidean specimen, like the specimens of Copemys, limits the age to after the
immigration of these animals to North
America, but the proboscideans did not spread
throughout the NorthAmerican continent instantaneously. Tedford et al. (1987) suggested
that their first appearance marks the beginning of the Late Barstovian. They appear in
NorthAmerica in the Hemingfordian at about
16.2 Ma in Nevada and at 15.8 Ma in Florida,
but appear in the mid-continent at about 14.8
Ma, the beginning of the mid-continent Late
Barstovian (Woodburne and Swisher, 1995)
The earliest occurrence of proboscidea in east
Texas is in a site which has yielded the mam-

malian Burkeville Local Fauna. The
Burkeville Local Fauna is considered by
Tedford et al. (1987 p. 6; Fig. 2) to be no older
than 14.5 Ma. The preponderance of small
forms at the western Louisiana sites and the
scarcity of small forms at the Texas sites initially proved a problem, which has been approached by screening at a classic Cold Spring
locality. It has yielded a single Copemys molar which falls in the size range seen at Fort
Polk (Schiebout and Ting, 1998).

Invertebrates
Earlier workers have found marine or
brackish water invertebrates of the Potamides
matsoni zone in the Castor Creek Member
(Rogers and Callandro, 1965). A list prepared
by W. H. Dall and reported in Deussen (1914,
p. 73) gives 21 species from well samples at a
site eight miles southwest ofAlexandria , Louisiana. Proboscidea and the fauna of the
Potamides matsoni zone occur at the
Burkeville site in Texas (Deussen, 1914;
Tedford et al., 1987). Occurrence of the
Potamides matsom' zone in the Louisiana subsurface in conjunction with benthic foraminifera led Tedford et al. (1987, p.176) to conclude that the age of the Burkeville Local
Fauna is between 14.5-13.0 Ma and that it
should be considered Barstovian in age. The
age range of the Barstovian is 15.9 Ma to 11.5
Ma, and Late Barstovian is 14.8-11.5 according to Woodburne and Swisher (1995). Size of
Copemys was considered by Lindsay to be
stratigraphically informative, but a lack of
pattern of size change among the sites at DISC
where stratigraphic order is known suggests
that this criterion can not be used for detailed
biostratigraphic work in western Louisiana
(Figure 40; Schiebout et al. 1998).

Palynology
Both TVOR SE at the main fossiliferous
level and a sample from 1.67-1.9 m in the TVOR
core are no older than about 11 million years based
on the current palynological research. A sample

67

fmm near the top of TVOR core (0.64-0.66), approximately at the level of TVOR conglomerate
was considered by Wrenn in Schiebout (1997b) as
no older than approximately 11-12 Ma. An age of
llMa would fall past the end of the Barstovian, in
the early Clarendonian Land Mammal Age
(Woodburne and Swisher, 1995). This age is unlikely for the Fort Polk Miocene vertebrates.
A possible explanation is that composites arrived earlier in the Gulf Coast than palynologists currently think they did. The
record is based primarily on occurrence in offshore Miocene sediments where the grains are
preserved. However, the composites are
known first from the Oligocene (Chattian;
upper Orellan) elsewhere in the world, with
ranges expanding in the mid-Miocene
(Burdigalian; Hemingfordian/Barstovian
boundary). The composites and grasses moved
into the south as the planet continued cooling
and the tropical forests disappeared in relatively drier climates.
It does seem as unlikely that the first
occurrence in the Gulf Coast would be dramatically different than that in the Shell Oil
Company zonation, as it is that the Fort Polk
Miocene vertebrates are Clarendonian. The
appearance has been noted and related to foraminiferal zonations in probably hundreds of
wells offshore for the past 40 years. Fort Polk
material was processed many times, to recover
any pollen, and each successful effort was repeated to insure that the pollen was coming
out of the rock and not from cross contamination. Further work on fossil vertebrates and
fossil pollen and use of additional dating techniques is needed to umavel this contradiction.

Paleomagnetic Analysis
Sampling
One hundred and forty-nine specimens
were sampled from four USGS cores (19 specimens from DISC 1; 17 from DISC 2; 84 from
DISC 3; and 29 from TVOR) to cover the maximum 33 m (108 ft.) stratigraphic section. The
specimens were collected from massive clay

or silty clay within the Castor Creek Member
and cut into cubes to fit into an 8 cm3 sample
holder for paleomagnetic measurements.

Paleomagnetic Methodology
Stepwise Alternating Field(AF) demagnetization was employed in the measurements. Demagnetization is achieved by cycling
the specimens through magnetic hysteresis
loops of decreasing amplitude to randomize
domain moment directions. InAF treatment,
each step consists of higher peak fields than
the previous one. After each step, the specimen is measured again. Each successive
stepwise treatment will realign the magnetizations of more and more grains, as their coercivities are exceeded by the higher and
higher fields. Fifteen to twenty steps are employed for 10 test specimens at LSU. After
stepwise alternating field (AF) demagnetization with peak up to 100 milliteslas (mT) ,
Natural Remanent Magnetization (NRM) was
measured with a three-axis CTF cryogenic
magnetometer equipped with SQUID within
a shielded room. Seven to eight steps are employed for 110 specimens (84 from DISC3; 9
from DISCI; 17 from DISC2 and 24 from
TVOR) at University of Texas at Austin. After
Stepwise Alternating Field(AF) demagnetization with peak up to 800 milliteslas (mT) ,
Natural Remanent Magnetization (NRM) was
measured with a two-axis cryogenic magnetometer within a shielded room. Results of progressive demagnetization experiments are displayed by using the orthogonal vector end
point diagram (Zijderveld, 1967) and stereonet
diagrams. Paleoinclinations ofthe component
magnetization were determined with principal component analysis (PCA) which yields a
least-squared-fit vector and its mean angular
deviation (MAD) (Kirschvink, 1980).
Polarity intervals were defined by grouping adjacent sample polarities and matching
them to the polarity chrons and subchrons of
the Geomagnetic Polarity Time Scale (GPTS;
Cande and Kent, 1992, 1995). The magnetic

elevation of DISC Core 1 & 2 to one another and DISC sites was
determined by plane tabling and DISC Core 3 is from USGS determination and is
approximate. Relative elevation of TVOR core to DISC cores is determined by the
paleomagnetic data, and the elevation of TVOR cluster sites in relation to the core
is by plane tabling.

polarity of the samples is based only on the
direction of paleoinclinations. The reliability of
the paleoinclinations acquired can be judged on
the basis of their mean angular deviations (MAD):
59 very good for MAD less than 50, 57 good for
MAD less than 150, and 33 poor for MAD more
than 150.

CCC in the following geochemical discussion refers to samples from Castor Creek conglomerates, samples taken from the main productive conglomerates stratigraphically high
in the member, DISC conglomerate, TVOR
conglomerate, and conglomerates in the north
part of the TVOR cluster that are
stratigraphically equivalent to it. On the basis of the remarkable similarity observed in
d 13 C values of modern PCN and TOC (Table
10) and CCC-PCN and TOe from conglomerates (Table 11), it can be concluded that vegetation was identical, consisting primarily of
C3 type plants. It can be noted, however, that
the insoluble residue and the organic carbon
contents are higher in the modern nodules
relative to CCC (Castor Creek conglomerates).
The d 18 0 values of the 3 cores are within the
range of the CCC-PCN.
The modern and Castor Creek groups of
samples are significantly different. The 8180
of CCC-PCN is about 1.67 permillighter than
MGC-PCN. This difference can be interpreted
in one of the three following ways:
1. Ground (or soil) temperature effect during
formation of the PCN. In this case, the isotope difference is compatible with a cooler
ground temperature equivalent to about 7Â°C
(1.67/0.24, the Epstein effect) during formation of CCC-PCN relative to present.
2. Dryer soils during the formation of the PCN.
3. Changes in rainfall isotope composition in
a warmer atmosphere. This would imply a
cooling effect at the site of rain condensation
of about 2.4Â°C (1.67/-0.69, the so called
Dansgaard effect) during formation of CCCPCN relative to modern.
The new data since the work reported in
Schiebout (1997b), from modern PCN/TOC in
the Gulf Coast and PCN/TOC from the CCC ,
reinforce the findings that the observed postCCC excursion observed in Core DISC 1 (Fig-

Paleomagnetic Results
The paleoinclinations derived from core
DISC 3 samples delineate a succession of normal and reversed polarity intervals which generally show good stratigraphic correlation
with the adjacent cores DISC 1 and DISC 2 .
The polarity reversal pattern was correlated
with the GPTS (Cande and Kent, 1992; 1995)
using the following chronological control
points: (i) The level of DISC conglomerate and
closely overlying surface fossilfinds indicative
of an early Late Barstovian age (Schiebout,
1994, 1996; Schiebout, et aI., 1996); (ii) the
Barstovian Land Mammal age falling between
15.9 Ma and 11.6 Ma (Woodburne and
Swisher, 1995); (iii) distinctive sets of polarity chrons and subchrons and the succession
of normal and reversed polarities within
Chron 5A.
On the basis of these correlations, the
chronology of the core DISC 3 at Fort Polk,
Louisiana extends from Chron 5Br (late
Langhian) at the base to Subchron 5Ar.2n
(Serravallian) at the top, covering about 2.3
Ma of deposition and erosion. The ages of the
Miocene terrestrial vertebrate fossils in the
conglomeratic units within the Castor Creek
Member of the Fleming Formation are probably between 13.8 and 12.65 Ma.
The paleoinclinations derived from core
TVOR samples delineate a succession of normal and reversed polarity intervals which generally show good stratigraphic correlation
with the upper part of DISC cores. The polarity reversal pattern was correlated with the
GPTS (Cand~ and Kent, 1992; 1995) and
shows that the chronology of the TVOR core
is between Chron 5AAn and Chron 5ADn, covering about 1 Ma of deposition and erosion.

ure 46) may indicate a temporal shift in vegetation from C3 to C4-dominated plants about
12.8 Ma.Asingle point suggests an almost immediate return, and a goal of future work will
be to examine the interval above the excursion to be more sure of its duration. This excursion may be related to a global withdrawal
of atlI}ospheric CO 2 during the Monterey event
(p. 75) which sequestered the carbon in marginal seas.

Castor Creek within one transgressive-regressive event. The interpretation ofthe paleomagnetic data which correlates the TVOR core
with those from DISC, despite the TVOR well
being situated up dip of the DISC cluster, is
consistent with Hinds (1999) placement of the
Castor Creek Member on the regression portion of a cycle which reached maximum transgression at approximately 16 Ma. To move the
TVOR sites to the transgressive portion of the
cycle or the next lower transgression-regression cycle in the Gulf Coast would be inconsistent with the presence of Copemys, indicative of an age younger than 14.8 Ma
(Woodburne and Swisher, 1995) at TVOR at
the top of the core and at Stonehenge Site.
TVOR Sand TVOR SE are then relatively
similar in stratigraphic height to Stonehenge,
lowest DISC cluster site, which has yielded a
single partial shark tooth. Hit is not reworked,
it indicates that Stonehenge, like TVOR SE,
was near the sea, which was regressing

IX. REGIONAL AND
GLOBAL PATTERNS
Before fitting the Fort Polk Miocene sites
into larger-scale patterns, the relationships of
the DISC and TVOR site clusters to each other
and within the Castor Creek Member have to
be evaluated. TVOR SE and its fossil rays represents a marine incursion into the Fort Polk
area. The adjacent TVOR S, slightly stratigraphically higher, has yielded more definitely
terrestrial mammals. Hinds (1999) placed the

Gulfwards from the Fort Polk region.
The most marine-influenced of the Fort
Polk sites (TVOR S, TVOR SE, and
Stonehenge) may be more closely equivalent
to the east Texas Burkeville Site, which includes a mixture of marine and terrestrial
vertebrates (Tedford et aI.,1987), than to the
Texas sites bearing the subsequent Cold
Spring Local Fauna. DISC surface exposure
at the Prosynthetoceras level, estimated at
approximately 13.5 Ma, is best considered
equivalent to the Cold Spring Local Fauna.
This would have the effect of narrowing the
possible age range of the Burkeville Local
Fauna, estimated in Tedford et aI. (1987) as
14.5 Ma-13 Ma, to 14.5 Ma-13.4 Ma.
Placing the TVOR cluster of sites as
equivalent in age, in part, to the DISC ones,
puts the TVOR sites stratigraphically at the
very top of the Castor Creek Member. The conglomerates of the DISC and TVOR clusters
occur in a stratigraphic span of 20 m, and
clearly do not represent a single event. The
conglomeratic zone also includes sequences of
soils (Jones et aI., 1995). The transition from
the Castor Creek to the overlying sandier
Blounts Creek Member is indicative of major
changes in the Fort Polk region. Changes taking place in the central Gulf Coast include
Balcones faulting in central Texas and a shift
of depocenters eastward with the uplift of the
southern Roc~ies, from east Texas to southwestern Louisiana in the early Miocene and
southeastern Louisiana in the late Miocene
(Hinds, 1999; McCulloh and Heinrich, 2000).
Sea level changes, with the conglomerates possibly representing pulses of base level drop,
and climate changes are both possibly involved and interconnected.
A Miocene cooling event dated as extending from 14 to 11.5 Ma produced the Harang
facies (Figure 47; 48) recognized in the Louisiana subsurface (Echols & Curtis, 1973).
Cooling (Figure 48) appears to have greatly
affected diversity of Caribbean corals (Collins
et aI., 1996). Collins et aI., (1996) considered

constriction of the TropicalAmerican Seaway
to have occurred prior to its 3.5 Ma close and
to have led to warming and an increase in
coral diversity in the Caribbean between 12
Ma and 9 Ma. Vincent and Berger (1985) have
proposed a hypothesis, the Monterey Hypothesis' to explain a carbon excursion towards
heavy values associated with worldwide cooling (Fig. 48) from 17.5 to 13.5, with a pronounced cooling shift between 15.5 and 12.5.
They considered Monterey events to have
started with increased temperature differences between high latitudes (where Antarctic ice was expanding) and low latitudes, resulting in increased carbon deposition, zonal
winds, and formation of a thermocline
(Vincent and Berger, 1985). Some ice was
present in the Eocene, and there was a significant ice cap by the end of the Oligocene
(John Wrenn, pel's. comm.) A deep sea hiatus,
a halt in deposition, at approximately 15 Ma
(Abreu and Anderson, 1998) may be correlative, in part, to the lower Castor Creek Member marine phase. The top ofthe Castor Creek
with its conglomeratic concentrates, related
to a drop in base level which would have resulted in sediments being eroded and carried
out to sea, may have been correlative to resumption of deep sea deposition.
The 12.8 Ma carbon excursion at the top
of DISC core 2 was probably tied to the global
complex of related changes at the time, including climate changes at the end ofthe Monterey
global cooling period, which is recorded in the
Louisiana subsurface as the Harang excursion. The 818 0 values prior to the excursion
represent either significantly cooler andlor
dryer soil or warmer atmosphere leading to
818 0 equivalent in rainfall (p. 71). A possible
scenario would be for 818 0 values for the Castor Creek conglomerates at the DISC and
TVOR level to represent Monterey cooling
compared to modern climates and for the carbon excursion to represent later relative
warming. The lowest of the Fort Polk Miocene

conglomerate, has the highest percentage of
cricetid rodents, which tend to prefer forested
sites, of any Fort Polk Miocene site. Later sites
would have been more open with more grassy
areas. C4 grasses, present throughout the
range of sites (see the Phytotith section) may
have become dominant in the region temporarily, perhaps invading C 3 grasslands. The
change represented in the carbon excursion
has since been reversed in the modern soils.

x. CONCLUSIONS

special note include a partial rhinoceros skeleton. Lower vertebrates and mammalian postcranial material have received additional attention. Postcranial samples have proved a
valuable adjunct in identification of the larger
forms recovered in surface search. The Miocene lower vertebrates, relatively similar to
the forms present in the region today, present
an interesting contrast to the Miocene large
mammals, which are very different from the
modern fauna, which is relatively depauperate after the Late Pleistocene extinction of
many forms of the North American
megafauna, such as horses, camels, and proboscideans.
New sites include TVOR SE, low in the
TVOR cluster, and Persimmon Barrow, highest site in the DISC cluster, where a nice jaw
of a tiny beaver, a species new to science, was
recovered. An expansion of classic TVOR took
place with working of conglomerates similar
in stratigraphic height at TVOR N cluster
sites. Stonehenge, lowest of the DISC cluster
sites and source of particularly well preserved
tiny fossils and rare animals in the fossil list,
such as the recently recovered procyonid, has
yielded an additional five to six tons of conglomerate to trackhoe excavation in the fall
of 1999. Five sixths of this material remain
for future proc~ssing and study and is not part
of the work covered in this report.
The Fort Polk Miocene sites represent,
not a single catastrophe kill, but a sampling
of over a million years from a region. The age,
length of time spanned by the fossiliferous
sites (13.8-12.6 Ma), and the relationship of
the TVOR cluster of sites to the DISC cluster
has been worked out using paleomagnetic and
biostratigraphic data. This is consistent with
the early Late Barstovian age suggested for
the major sites on the basis offossil vertebrate
content. Paleopalynological dates remain at
variance with dates by other means.
Mapping by the Louisiana Geological
Survey and David Hinds on an LSU project
supported by the EDMAP program has made

The opportunity to use a variety of scientific techniques on the fossil deposits of the
Fort Polk Miocene has made it possible to recover a large fauna for a region where the modern heavy vegetation would otherwise make
obtaining a fossil record impossible, or the
record very scanty. It has also made it possible to compare and contrast sites at different stratigraphic levels, to unravel
paleoecologic differences, and to recognize
both local and global influences on the ecology.
Continued work has made steady
progress towards revealing the diversity of
animals which were inhabiting western Louisiana in what would become Fort Polk. The
faunal list has more than doubled since
Schiebout (1997b), including addition of 22
taxa, 13 of them mammals. New forms continue to be found and there is no reason to
suppose the list is near its maximum. The Fort
Polk Miocene faunal list is now longer than
that of most sites in east Texas but well below
the Myers Farm Miocene site in Nebraska,
which has yielded over a hundred taxa of
mammals (Corner, 1976). Not all of the Fort
Polk taxa recently added to the faunal list
have yielded sufficient material to allow specific or even generic level identification, but,
like the beaver material reported in the previous report (Schiebout 1997b), these materials offer hope that even small amounts of new
material, which are very likely to be recovered with further work, will clarify their relationships. Once researchers are alerted to the
presence of an animal, they can be particularly alert for and recognize even fragmentary
pieces of diagnostic structures.
Continued work on the Fort Polk Miocene has made significant changes in our
view of even the most common animals, the
small rodents, as well as sharpening the picture of rare f~rms such as the animals of medium and large body size. Individual finds of

77

it possible to consider the fossiliferous Fort
Polk Miocene beds to lie at the very top of the
member, despite the lack of a contact with the
overlying Blounts Creek Member in the vicinity. The fossil-bearing conglomerates all fall
within the regressive portion of the upper
Castor Creek Member, within about 20 m of
the top of the member. Earlier work recognized
that the fossiliferous beds were confined to the
upper half of the Castor Creek Member, as
much as 75 m based on some estimates ofthe
Member's thickness.
Orienting the Fort Polk sites stratigraphically with the sequence in east Texas was
an original goal; now, Fort Polk information
can be used to revise the east Texas picture,
refining the age of the Burkeville Local Fauna.
It seems likely that the Burkeville/Cold Spring
faunal and environmental changes mirror
those upsection in Fort Polk from Stonehenge
to DISC conglomerate, or TVOR SE to TVOR
conglomerate. The Louisiana aquiclude which
has been correlated with beds bearing the
Burkeville Local Fauna in east Texas is probably the more marine influenced, lower main
portion ofthe Castor Creek Member. The lowest and most marine-influenced of the Fort
Polk Miocene vertebrate sites might also be
correlative to the Burkeville Local Fauna, as
no definitive animals tying them either to it
or the overlying Cold Spring Local Fauna are
available. The DISC conglomerate and the
Prosynthetoceras occurring above it, are most
reasonably correlated to the Cold Spring Local Fauna, thus constraining the Burkeville
Local Fauna to less than the age of their level
at Fort Polk, approximately 13.5 Ma.
Continuing environmental study is producing a complex ecological picture. The
coastal location of the Fort Polk Miocene sites
originally suggested an environment like current south Louisiana, but continuing work
raises the possibility of some of the environments being more like south central
Louisiana's Pleistocene uplands, higher than
the modern coast and floodplains because of

the entrenching of rivers like the Mississippi
and Red rivers when sea level dropped during the major Pleistocene glaciations.
Paleopalynology has indicated a mix of forest
and open marsh and grassland for some of the
sites, and changes in the ratios of common
rodent types allows tracking changes in forested versus open environments in a broad
way. One of the most exciting finds from the
Fort Polk Miocene is a geochemical change in
carbon isotopes. One of the cores at DISC
records a 12.8 Ma carbon excursion high at
the site, which was probably tied to a complex of related changes at the time, including
climate changes at the end of the Monterey
global cooling period, related to increase in
Antarctic glaciation. The lowered base level
resulting in erosion of soils and concentration
of nodules and animal remains in the conglomerates may also have produced vegetational
changes, probably including a brief expansion
of C4 grasses to produce the carbon excursion.

XI. RECOMMENDATIONS
Work at all currently known productive
sites should continue. This report represents
an intermediate stage in ongoing work which
is continuing to yield results for publication
in the scientific literature. Some sections and
some types of fossils have been published or
are under review, others have yielded new
material recently and are in relatively early
stages of study. Several animal types have
been greatly affected by finds in the period
reported in this report. For example, there are
now considered to be two taxa of horses. Every horse tooth or jaw fragment offers the possibility of refining their diagnoses significantly, and horse material is recovered regularly.
The harvest of new forms has been considerable since the last report, and this increase in new finds has not been concentrated
in the earliest portion of the work, but continues in 1999 and 2000. Recently discovered significant specimens include a large beaver in-

cisor fragment (probably a new taxon for the
faunal list), the procyonid, and the shark
material. Rare specimens make a considerable
difference, as many taxa significant in ecological and stratigraphic interpretation are still
known from less than a half dozen specimens.
The possibility of new sites is good wherever the top 20 m of the Castor Creek Member is exposed, either by erosion or human activities. Field work should concentrate on this
interval, although nodule concentrations that
are found in the future anywhere in the
Fleming Formation might yield concentrations of fossils. Any extensive Miocene exposures should be checked, even if no conglomerates are present, because of the possibility
of an isolated animal in overbank mudstone,
like the Shamrock rhino.
Additional techniques which should be
tried include two possibilities for independent
dating (magnetic susceptibility and strontium
isotope dating) both of which can be tried with
equipment available at LSD. The discrepancy
between paleomagnetic and vertebrate biostratigraphic dating results on one hand and
the paleopalynological dates on the other
makes use of an additional independent
method desirable. More study of the Fort Polk
Miocene soils would be expected to yield additional paleoecological data. Additional comparison of Fort Polk Miocene fossils with specimens at other museums should take place, for
example, at the Florida State Museum in
Gainesville, which houses eastern Gulf
Coastal Miocene faunas, and the Nebraska
State Museum in Lincoln which houses extensive Miocene high plains faunas.

ered. Processing of the Stonehenge rock and
study of resulting fossils is recommended.
Gully-Periodic examination for exposure of
new promising conglomerate should be done.
DISC-The following recommendations from
Schiebout (1997b) have been implemented
successfully, and continuation of this work is
proposed:
"As the sole currently available large exposure of the Castor Creek which has proved
rich in Miocene vertebrates, it provides the
best hope for ongoing recovery of medium and
large sized animals. It is no longer a barrow
pit yielding clay and sand, but it is yielding a
slow but steady harvest of bones and teeth as
erosion exposes the animal remains buried in
the fine overbank fluvial sediment. As long as
the erosion causes no problem for Fort Polk,
it is recommended that the site be left open
and that it undergo periodic surface reconnaissance. Personnel of the environmental section
have proved proficient fossil collectors and
have added important specimens to those collected by LSD scientists. Collection of bulk
samples should also continue."
Persimmon Barrow-The barrow pit is
overgrown, has been partly covered, and has
yielded nothing on some surface searches, but
its level of interest as the stratigraphically
highest site in the Fort Polk Miocene, makes
it worthwhile for occasional surface searches,
particularly at the level at which mammal
specimens were found. Now that phytolith evidence suggests the presence of C4 grasses in
the Fort Polk sections under study, more detail on the carbon excursion becomes especially desirable. It should be sought in part
via geochemical work on nodules higher in the
DISC section, in Persimmon Barrow.

DISC Site Cluster
Stonehenge-A ton of new rock was transferred to the acid lab at LSD and over four
tons remain at the DISC landfarm for safekeeping prior to transfer. Stonehenge remains
one of our most productive sites. It is the site
processed by scree~ing from which the most
complete specimens oftiny animals are recov-

TVOR Site Cluster
Original TVOR and exposures north and
northwest of the well site should be periodically examined for additional conglomerate.
Extensive bulldozing and churning ofthe surface has taken place, and future rains may

80

clean off conglomerate now concealed by mud.
Tvor Sand TVOR SE Both are rapidly
eroding, and, in addition, are among the sites
closest to marine environments. Both continue
to yield to surface search and should continue
to be monitored.
Outreach
A main focus on outreach should remain
the Fort Polk Environmental Learning Center. The small brochure (Fig. 49) for youngsters, the posters prepared for professional
meetings which are then brought to the center, and the hands-on fossil dig, which uses
casts and picked screening residue from the
project to simulate fossil hunting, are available there. LSD undergraduate and graduate
classes have been brought on field trips to the
Fort Polk Miocene, and portions of the research have been carried out by graduate students as part of their training, and this should
continue.
The :J;..SU: Museum of Natural Science is
now the main component of the Louisiana
State Museum of Natural History, and it is
hoped that increased outreach on museum research will become possible in the future. Information on the Fort Polk Miocene research
is already on the Museum webpage, and a Fort
Polk Miocene diorama has been proposed for
development as part of Museum renovation.
As the Fort Polk Miocene fauna grows, spectacular animals like the giant camel and the
rhino are added, and the ecological picture
comes into sharper focus, to be fit into earth
history on the global scale. The opportunities
to interest and educate the public can be expected to expand in th!3 future.

13. ABSTRACT (Maximum 200 words)

This report discusses research on the first Miocene terrestrial mammal fauna from Louisiana and its paleoenvironment, from August,
1995 through August, 2000, including addition of nine lower vertebrate and thirteen mammalian taxa to the faunal list. New additions
include an unusually small beaver, a squirrel which is an ecologically significant range extension, a giant camel, a large rhinoceros, a
tiny peccary, an oreodont, a weasel, a procyonid, a toad, two types of snake, and a shark.
The Fort Polk sites represent a new and increasingly well-documented record of faunal and environmental changes in a period of major
worldwide temperature and sea level changes. Age of the fauna lies between 13.8 Ma and 12.6 Ma. The fossiliferous beds are from the
non-marine upper portion of the Castor Creek Member of the Fleming Formation. A 12.8 Ma d13C isotope shift was probably
associated with a local change from a dominant C3-type vegetation (usually trees, shrubs, cool climate or wetland grasses) to a C4type vegetation (usually warm climate grasses) and reflects environmental changes associated with base level drops. Timing is close to
a warming period following global cooling associated with Antarctic ice development, an event tied to global lowering of sea level.
