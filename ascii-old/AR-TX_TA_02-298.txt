Abstract
Flatrock Engineering and Environmental, Ltd. of San Antonio, Texas contracted with Tierras
Antiguas Archaeological Investigations (TAAI) to conduct a field survey of five river crossings
along the proposed Karnes North Oil Pipeline right-of-way. The pipeline was to be installed by
TexStar through Bexar, Wilson, and Karnes counties, Texas. The project was entirely privately
funded, and the properties across which the pipeline will course through at these river crossings
are privately owned; therefore, no Texas Antiquities Permit was required.
A pedestrian survey with shovel testing conducted at these five river crossings within the
proposed Karnes North Oil Pipeline right-of-way resulted in the discovery of three prehistoric
open campsites – 41KA202 , 41KA203, 41WN123. On 41KA203, an early 1900s farmstead was
constructed. A fourth site documented is the 1880s-1890s Mackey Brick and Tile Factory –
41WN124.
41KA202 is situated some 400 m west of River Crossing #4, and is a medium-sized open
campsite occupied during an unknown period, or periods, in prehistory. However, our assessment
is that it lies on the southern periphery of the ROW, has been heavily disturbed by historic
cultivation, and as such possesses little research potential.
41KA203 is a relatively large prehistoric open campsite located on an upland knoll/ridge near
the San Antonio River’s Crossing #2. The Karnes North Pipeline ROW that could have
potentially impacted this site courses through the western portion, which is sloping and heavily
disturbed by cultivation. Shovel testing revealed no evidence of cultural material below the plow
zone. Upon this site, a house, outbuildings, etc. had been constructed in the early 1900s. The only
structure remaining was a fine example of a ca. 1915-1930 Wilson Dickey Silo, on the periphery
of the proposed pipeline ROW. In this case, Tierras Antiguas recommended that the ROW be
shifted so that it was some 30-50 meters remote from the standing silo so to avoid possible
damage to the silo’s foundation and overall structure. The pipeline’s installers (TexStar)
concurred, and the pipeline was re-routed accordingly.
41WN123 is a relatively small prehistoric open campsite located on the periphery of the pipeline
ROW that crosses the San Antonio River at River Crossing #5. Because of its location on the
periphery of the ROW, it should not be impacted by pipeline construction. A sandstone tempered
brownware pottery sherd found on the surface of a cultivated field suggests that the site was
occupied at least once during the Toyah phase of the Late Prehistoric period, some 350-700 years
ago. The context of fire-cracked rocks and mussel shells on this site were observed to be heavily
disturbed due to cultivation, and were not directly within the pipeline ROW. Accordingly,
Tierras Antiguas recommended that the Karnes North Pipeline in this immediate area be allowed
to be constructed as designed.
41WN124 is the potentially historically significant Mackey Brick and Tile Factory, in operation
during the late 1880s and 1890s. The proposed ROW for the Karnes North Pipeline will not
i

impact any portion of the site, as the pipeline will be deeply bored under the San Antonio River,
and exit the surface in a cultivated field several meters east of the site. Therefore, we
recommended that the pipeline construction as it is currently designed be allowed proceed with
no further archaeological investigations.
However, as always following a Phase I survey, Tierras Antiguas further recommended that if
any additional, undiscovered cultural resources were encountered during development along the
entire pipeline right-of-way, such finds should be examined and evaluated by Tierras Antiguas,
or by any qualified archaeological consultant.
No artifacts were collected during this project.

Acknowledgments
I express my sincere appreciation to Mr. Ryan DeBarros and Ms. Judy Vader, Project Managers
at Flatrock Engineering and Environmental, Ltd. Both were extremely amiable and helpful
throughout, and their overall knowledge of the project contributed significantly to our
understanding of the project’s scope of work.
In addition, I express my sincere gratitude to Tierras Antiguas staff archaeologists Belisario Silva
and Emory Worrell, who worked hard, long hours, and expressed an attitude and work ethic that
ensured this survey was conducted in a thorough and professional manner.

Introduction
In December 2013,
Tierras Antiguas
conducted a cultural
resources background
review of the 51-mile
Karnes North Oil
Pipeline right-of-way
(ROW) through Bexar,
Wilson, and Karnes
counties (Figures 1 and
2). That review
identified the known
archaeological sites
within 1,000 meters of
the right-of-way, as well
as the potential for both
prehistoric and historic
archaeological sites to
exist.
Based upon that review, Figure 1. Location of the Karnes North Oil Pipeline project in Texas.
Flatrock Engineering
then requested a field survey of five river crossings of the Karnes North Oil Pipeline that were
to be impacted by TexStar Energy for the construction of the pipeline. The survey of the five
river crossings was conducted by Tierras Antiguas in December 2013 and January 2014, and is
hereinafter occasionally referred to as the Project Area (PA).

Modern Environmental Setting
Bexar County
The physiographic makeup of Bexar County is a combination of four distinct physiographic
regions of Texas: the Edwards Plateau, the Balcones Escarpment, the Blackland Prairie, and the
South Texas Gulf Coastal Plain (Figure 3). More specifically, the Project Area lies within a
transitional zone on the lower Balcones Escarpment region where it gives way to the Blackland
Prairie. As such, this micro-environmental zone can still be classified as upland prairie. In

Figure 2. Project Area on large topographic map.
addition, the Project Area lies within the Balconian vegetation area as defined by (Blair 1950;
Map 2013; Figure 7). The annual average rainfall is about 28 inches (77 centimeters), with 194
growing-season days per year (Taylor et al. 1991).
The Edwards Plateau physiographic region of Texas exists in the northern portion of Bexar
County where the group(s) which occupied it were advantageously able to exploit an ecotone
encompassing riverine, upland, and semi-arid adapted plants and animals. The Edwards Plateau,
with elevations reaching 2,250 ft. above mean sea level (amsl) in northern Gillespie County
(Allison et al. 1975:76), is a hilly region, gradually sloping to the southeast, and ending in the
escarpment running across the middle of the sub-region (Figure ). The most common flora
observed on the plateau include juniper (Juniperus ashei), plateau live oak (Quercus fusiformis),
Texas persimmon (Diospyros texana), honey mesquite (Prosopis glandulosa), and agarita
(Berberis trifoliata) (Blair 1950:112; Van Auken 1988:45; Simpson 1988). Due to overgrazing
by livestock and restricted range fires, much of the plateau has been overtaken by juniper in
modern times (Buechner 1944:703-704; Van Auken 1993:199-210).

The
Balcones
Escarpment separates
the Edwards Plateau
from the lower
blackland prairies to the
east. It is a fault zone,
consisting of blocky
limestone, chalk, shale,
and marl. The
escarpment slopes to the
southeast from about
700-1,000 feet above
mean sea level (Taylor
et al. 1991:119). The
most economically
important floral species
are riparian nut trees,
including oak, walnut,
and pecan that thrive
along the rivers and
creeks (Van Auken
1988:55).

intertwined diversity in
biotic resources existing

from season to season
(Collins 1995:366; 2004). The presence of prehistoric cemeteries found in areas along the
escarpment where seasonally rich food resources such as nut-bearing species, particularly acorn
and pecan trees, and prickly pear tunas may not be just a coincidence (Hall 1995:633-647).
The Blackland Prairie is a rolling and well-dissected plain representing the extension of the true
prairie that runs through the center of North America. The prairie was once dominated by
tallgrass species such as little bluestem (Schizachyrium scoparium), big bluestem (Andropogon
gerardi), indiangrass (Sorghastrum nutans), tall dropseed (Sporobolus asper), and silveus
dropseed (Sporobulus silveanus). Oaks (Quercus species), elms (Ulmus), cottonwoods
(Populus), and native pecan (Carya illinoinensus) are common along the drainages.
The South Texas Plain is the western extension of the Gulf Coastal Plain. It is a nearly level to
3

rolling plain that is
moderately dissected by
major river drainages
through its northern half
and by numerous
intermittent drainages,
and the Bordas
Escarpment in the
south. It was originally
an open grassland
mixed with brushy
chaparral. Oaks, pecans,
and ash (Zanthroxylum
fagara) were common
along streams (Black
1989:12; Hester
1980:31, 33).
Both the plains and the
prairies have apparently
undergone dramatic
vegetational changes
over the past 300 years.

fire suppression, much of
the original vegetation
has been replaced by woody invader species, transforming the grassland into what we know
today as the “South Texas Brush Country”, dominated by mesquite, huisache, granjeno or spiney
hackberry, brasil, lotebush, whitebrush, and cenizo (Black 1989:14-16; Hester 1980:34-37). As
shown on the cover photo and in Figure 8, the Project Area in Universal City has apparently been
cleared, used as pastureland, and now secondary growth mesquite and huisache is again
overtaking the land.
Wilson County
The modern political boundary of Wilson County encompasses 802 square miles on the upper
coastal plain of South Texas. Nearly flat to gently undulating terrain across the county ranges
from 790 to 290 feet above mean sea level (amsl) from the northwest to southeast. Deep loams
underlain by clayey subsoils support the growth of mesquite, live oak, blackjack, post oak, live
oak, various thorny shrubs, and assorted cacti. Where these are not present, long and short
grasses make for fine pasture and farm lands. The San Antonio River courses through the
western portion of Wilson County, while two major tributaries – Cibolo and Ecleto creeks drain
4

the eastern portion of the county. Annual temperatures range from 400 to 650 in the winter, and
from 740 to 960 in summer, and the average annual rainfall is just under 29 inches. These climatic
conditions allow for about 280 days of growing season per year (Long 1996a; Taylor 1977).
With its semi-arid environment, the county is generally frost-free from mid-February through
early December, allowing for about 290 growing season days. The average annual rainfall is
about 28 inches, with most rainfall occurring in May and September. These peaks are the result
of thunderstorms bearing moist air from the Gulf of Mexico to the east, and the Pacific Ocean
much farther to the west (Leffler 2011a, b).
However, rainfall amounts vary significantly from year to year, and the high evapotranspiration
effects in the area effectively offset any beneficial surplus of annual rainfall. This is another
reason irrigation systems are so necessary, and commonly found in use today throughout the area.
Summers are indeed hot and dry, with temperatures consistently hovering above 1000F, although
humidity is generally low compared to environments closer to the Gulf Coast. Overall, the
climate can be classified as subtropical steppe.
Karnes County
Karnes County covers 758 square miles of the Rio Grande Plain region, with rolling to hilly
terrain ranging from 400 feet amsl in the northwestern portion to 180 feet amsl in the
southeastern portion.
In the northwestern areas of the county, loamy surfaces are underlain by clayey subsoils.
Otherwise the soils in the remainder of the county are loamy surface soils, lying over reddish and
black clay atop often shallow soft limestone bedrock. The San Antonio River drains the central
and southern portions of the county, while Cibolo and Ecleto creek are major drainage basins for
the northern areas. Pecan, mesquite, post oak, and live oak are prevalent along the numerous
stream divides, while mesquite brush, other assorted brush and cacti thrive where pastures and
fields remain unattended. Annual temperatures range from 410 to 650 in the winter, and from 740
to 960 in summer, and the average annual rainfall is about 27 inches. With its subtropical humid
environment, the county is generally frost-free from mid-February through early December,
allowing for about 280 growing season days, and roughly 80 percent of the county is considered
to be prime farm land (Long 1996b; Molina 2000).

Paleoenvironment
The paleoenvironment of Texas is as varied as the landscape, and the South Texas Paleoclimatic
record contains significant gaps primarily due to the scarcity of deep, finely stratified, and welldated deposits (Stahle and Cleaveland 1995:51). To date, the best record of paleoenvironmental
reconstruction in South Texas has been accomplished by Robinson (1982) from analysis of
phytoliths from three archaeological sites in Live Oak County. Overall, the data there along with
data from other sites in Texas suggest that the waning of the Pleistocene, or late-glacial period,
5

marked a transition from a cooler, wetter environment to one that steadily grew warmer and
drier, and more seasonal, with intermittent moist periods through about 6,000 years ago.
Most researchers then generally agree that the period between 6,000 and 3,000 years ago was
much warmer and drier than today. Since that time, intermittent moist and dry intervals have
occurred over the past 3,000 years.
It is unlikely that the climate has changed significantly in the past few thousand years in the area
that would significantly induce vegetation changes. The greater changes have been induced by
human intervention through the clearing of wooded areas along the rivers and streams for
construction purposes, pumping more water for irrigation which has lowered water tables, and
overgrazing by livestock. Although there are still many seeps, springs, and streams in the area,
they most probably flowed with greater abundance during wetter intervals than exist at the
present time, providing an abundant resource for prehistoric occupants.

Cultural Context and Chronology
The Project Area lies along the cusp of both the South Texas archaeological region as defined
by Hester (1980, 1995, 2004), and the Central Texas Coast archaeological region as refined by
Ricklis (2004). All dates are given as approximate years before present (B.P.), i.e., before 1950.

South Texas
Paleoindian (11,200 - 7950 B.P.)
Refining a cultural chronology for south Texas is problematic, due to the compressed nature of
the archaeological record and the scarcity of stratified sites excavated within the region. Hester
(1995:433) acknowledges the paucity of information that exists for south Texas and as such
offers only a “general framework” for prehistoric periods particular to the region (Figure 5). This
period is estimated at between ca.11,200–7950 B.P. in south Texas (Hester 1995). The
Paleoindian period began toward the close of the Pleistocene. Diagnostic artifacts of the early
Paleoindian interval include Clovis and Folsom projectile points. The wide distribution of
Clovis-type points across most of North America and even into Central America suggests a wide
dispersal and interaction of the people who made them. Other artifacts associated with the Clovis
culture include bifaces and prismatic blades, engraved stones, bone and ivory points, stone bolas,
ochre, and shaft straighteners. During the late Paleoindian interval, the first stemmed lanceolate
points, such as Angostura, Golondrina, St. Mary’s Hall, and Barber (among a few others) appear.

In general, the Paleoindian adaptation has been considered to be one of small bands of nomadic,
big-game hunters following herds of Late Pleistocene fauna, including mammoth, mastodons,
bison, camel, and horse, across North America (Black 1989). More recently, emphasis has been
placed on the wide diversity of plants and animals used for subsistence by these early Americans,
6

such as turtles and tortoises,
alligators, mice, badgers, and
raccoons, although they
undoubtedly hunted the large
animals as well (Collins
1995:381). Known Clovis sites
include killsites, quarries,
caches, open campsites, ritual
sites, and burials (Hester
1995:433–436). A Folsom
interval follows the Clovis.
Folsom artifacts are fairly
common in south Texas;
however, no campsites or
killsites have been found south
of a large workshop, Pavo Real
(41BX52), in Bexar County
(Hester 1995:434–435). Most
Paleoindian finds in south
Texas have consisted of surface
lithic scatters on upland terraces
and ridges (Black 1989).
As the warming that marks the
transition from Pleistocene to
Holocene climates began to
take effect in Texas, prehistoric
inhabitants adapted with
changes in lifestyle. This
climatic shift is also marked by
the decline and extinction of
mammoth, mastodon, horse,
camel, and giant bison (Bison
antiquus). Large gregarious
game animals were perhaps
extinct in Texas. Human
hunters were forced to
concentrate on deer, antelope,
and other medium-size or
smaller game. Changes in the
subsistence base required
technological shifts that mark
the beginning of a new cultural

period known as the Archaic.
7

Early Archaic (7950 - 4450 B.P.)
Hester (1995:436–438) identifies the Early Archaic, with Early Corner Notched and Early Basal
Notched dart points, as roughly dating between 7950 to 4450 B.P. The extinction of large herds
of megafauna and the changing climate at the beginning of the Holocene stimulated a behavioral
change by the Prehistoric inhabitants of south Texas (McKinney 1981). While the basic huntergatherer adaptation probably remained intact, an economic shift away from big game hunting
was necessary. In general, more intensive exploitation of local and smaller resources such as
deer, fish, and plant bulbs is indicated by greater densities of ground-stone artifacts, fire-cracked
rock cooking features, and more specialized tools. Weir (1976) speculates that Early Archaic
groups were small and highly mobile, an inference based on the fact that Early Archaic sites are
thinly distributed and that diagnostic projectile point types are seen across a wide area, including
most of Texas and northern Mexico. Story (1985) believes that population densities were low
during the Early Archaic, and that groups consisted of related individuals in small bands with
“few constraints on their mobility” (Story 1985:39). Their economy was based on the utilization
of a wide range of resources, especially such year-round resources as prickly pear and lechugilla,
as well as rodents, rabbits, and deer.
Middle Archaic (4450 - 2350 B.P.)
Hester (1995:438–441) suggests that the period between 4450 and 2350 B.P. reflects the Middle
Archaic in south Texas. The Middle Archaic appears to have been a time of increased
population, based on the large number of sites from this period (Story 1985:40; Weir 1976:125,
128). On the South Texas Plains, exploitation of widely scattered, year-round resources such as
prickly pear continued (Campbell and Campbell 1981:13–15), as did hunting deer and rabbit.
Weir (1976) believes that the widely scattered bands prevalent in the Early Archaic now began
to coalesce, at least during the acorn-gathering season, into larger groups who shared the
intensive work of gathering and processing the acorn harvest (Weir 1976:126). Many researchers
believe burned rock middens are a result of this endeavor (Creel 1986; Prewitt 1991; Weir 1976).
The common presence of deer remains in burned rock middens encourages the view that deer
processing took place at burned rock midden sites. Bison bone is encountered in archaeological
sites in south Texas, at least occasionally, during all but the earliest part of the Middle Archaic
(Dillehay 1974). Cemeteries make their first appearance during this period, suggesting a
movement toward less mobility and perhaps territorialism. One of the earliest ccurrences dating
to the south Texas Middle Archaic, is Loma Sandia in Live Oak County, which dates between
ca. 2550 and 2750 B.P. (Taylor and Highley 1995).
Late Archaic (2350 - 1250 B.P.)
Hester believes the Late Archaic in south Texas may be defined as between 2350–1250 B.P.
Some researchers believe populations increased throughout the Late Archaic (Prewitt 1985),
while others feel populations remained the same or fell during this period (Black 1989:30).
Subsistence is assumed to have become less specialized on acorns, in favor of a broad spectrum
subsistence base (Black 1989:30). Story (1985:44–45) believes the presence of cemeteries
indicates that Late Archaic populations in central and south Texas were increasing and becoming
more territorial. Although inhabitants of the South Texas Plain near Brownsville and Rockport
8

had begun to make pottery by about 1750 B.P., the northern part of the plain was still “preceramic” until 1,000 years later (Story 1985:45–47). Late Archaic points tend to be much smaller
than Middle Archaic points.
Transitional Archaic (2250 - 1250 B.P.)
A late subperiod or interval of the Late Archaic is frequently referred to as the Terminal Archaic
or Transitional Archaic. Turner et al. (2011) cite data placing the Transitional Archaic as
2250–1250 B.P. Although Hester may lump current data into a Late Archaic period, he cautions
that more evidence will likely result in what may be termed as a “Terminal Archaic” period
during the latter part of the Late Archaic in south Texas. This Terminal Archaic period is
represented by diagnostics such as Ensor, Frio, and Matamoras points which appear to overlap
the Late Archaic and Late Prehistoric periods (Hester 1995:442). Weir (1976) believes this
marked a transition period to localized area sites, a disappearance of burned rock middens and
bison, and a reappearance of highly mobile hunters and gatherers. Others (Black and McGraw
1985; Peter 1982; Skelton 1977) argue that in some locations burned rock middens did not
disappear and sites were more intensely occupied during the Transitional Archaic period.
Late Prehistoric (1250 - 420 B.P.)
The term “Late Prehistoric” is commonly used to designate the period following the Late Archaic
in south Texas. Generally, the Late Prehistoric period is thought of as spanning the period
between A. D. 700 - 1530 ([1250 - 420 B.P.] [Hester 1995]). A series of distinctive traits mark
the shift from the Archaic to the Late Prehistoric period, including the technological shift to the
bow and arrow and the introduction of pottery to central Texas and the northern South Texas
Plain (Black 1989:32; Story 1985:45–47). Two distinct phases recognized within the Late
Prehistoric are the Austin and Toyah. During the Austin phase, there appears to be a subtle
transition from expanding stem projectile points that may have been used as dart points, as well
as early arrow points. The most prevalent point found in Austin phase sites is the Scallorn arrow
point. Settlement shifts into rockshelters such as Scorpion Cave in Medina County (Highley et
al. 1978) and Classen Rockshelter in northern Bexar County (Fox and Fox 1967) have been
noted. Cemeteries from this period often reveal evidence of conflict (Black 1989:32).
Beginning rather abruptly at about 650 B.P., a shift in technology occurred. The Perdiz arrow
point may best represent the appearance of a distinct culture in south-central Texas lasting for
about 300 years, which archaeologists have labeled the Toyah phase. Hester (1995:444)
recognizes this phase as the “best documented Late Prehistoric pattern” throughout south Texas,
with dates ranging between ca. 650/700 to 300/350 B.P. (A.D. 1250/1300 to 1600/1650).
In addition to Perdiz points, evidence of a Toyah culture is manifested as bone-tempered pottery,
bone spatulates, awls, and beads, stone endscrapers, beveled knives, and expediently utilized
flakes. Briefly, expedient lithic technology involves removing flakes from a core in a
nonstandard manner; the purpose is to knock off sharp flakes for immediate use, selecting the
ones that best suit the need at the time. This technology differs from formal, standardized core
reduction and the manufacturing of formal, usually bifacial tools. Expedient lithic technology
is a continent-wide phenomonon indicative of increased sedentism, and is observed in Toyah
9

assemblages in Texas.
Whether the Toyah phase seen in the south-central Texas archaeological record is a result of a
group of people moving into the region, or adapted technologies from the region’s periphery is
a matter of conjecture. Steele and Assad-Hunter (1986) argue for the occurrence of a distinct
change in diet between the Late Archaic and the Late Prehistoric components in two sites in the
Choke Canyon Reservoir area in south Texas. Analysis of the number of identified specimens
(NISP) shows a marked increase in artiodactyla elements present during the later part of the Late
Prehistoric, an increase largely due to the addition of bison to the “menu” (Steele and AssadHunter 1986:468).
Whether or not agriculture was practiced during this period in south Texas has not been
documented. There simply is not enough evidence to postulate there was ever a significant
presence of maize in the area. The later arrival of the Spanish during the later
Protohistoric/Historic period brought significant cultivars to south Texas.
Protohistoric/Historic (420 B.P. - present)
The end of the Late Prehistoric and beginning of the Historic period in south Texas is
characterized by written accounts of European contact with indigenous groups. The Protohistoric
period begins in 1528 when Spanish explorer Cabeza de Vaca traversed parts of southeast and
south Texas and left a diary of his five years spent traveling among the hunter-gatherers of Texas
and northern Mexico (e.g., Hallenbeck 1971). Cabeza de Vaca’s account of his stay with the
Miriami in 1533-34 indicates that groups of Native Americans would normally tether themselves
to the easily exploitable riverine environments in the fall, winter and summer, occasionally
sending a hunting party onto the grasslands to hunt deer. In the summer, many groups would live
near each other in the semiarid environs of South Texas to harvest prickly pear pads and other
succulents (Campbell and Campbell 1981:13-37).
Linguistically, early protohistoric accounts of the late 1500s indicate that a large group which
spoke Cohuilteco inhabited the area now known as south-central Texas. Coahuiltecan is a term
coined by Mexican linguists in the 1800s, and the name refers to the many small bands of Native
Americans who lived in northeastern Coahuila, Mexico and south Texas. The Coahuiltecans
were rapidly dispersed or killed during the Protohistoric period.
By the 1540s and 1550s Spanish ranchers had established large ranches in northern Mexico, with
several hundred thousand cattle, using Indian slaves as labor. Large mining ventures in northern
Mexico did the same. This encroachment from the south forced Native Americans to escape into
the south-central Texas region.
The period between de Vaca’s written account and the advent of Spanish missions in the late
1600s and early 1700s is referred to as the Protohistoric; a time when few, scant written
documents exist detailing Native American life outside the missions. The Historic period then,
is generally thought of as beginning in the 1700s.

10

Some 30 miles south of Eagle Pass, the Spanish established Mission San Juan Bautista in 1700
(now modern-day Guerrero). Early Spanish explorers then repeatedly traveled the Camino Real
enroute to newly established missions and settlements in today’s modern Texas throughout the
1700s and 1800s. Mexican families from across the river expanded into Texas, and these families
trace their roots to the early development of the area. In the ensuing years, lawlessness prevailed,
with saloons, gambling houses, outlaws, and slave hunters prevalent.

Central Texas Coast
Paleoindian (11,000 - 7500 B.P.)
Although some Paleoindian artifacts have been found, no intact paleoindian components have
been found in the Central Texas Coast region, so that a chronology of the Paleoindian period or
stage cannot be adequately defined (Hester 1980; Ricklis 2004). Exasterbating the discovery of
intact components is due in part to the rising sea level along the coast since Paleoindian
campsites were occupied; those campsites are presumably under water, far east of today’s
shoreline. Ricklis surmises that if buried and intact Paleoindian components are discovered, they
will be in today’s riverine environments away from the modern Gulf of Mexico shoreline.
Early Archaic (7500 - 4200 B.P.)
Two sub-periods are recognized during the 3,300-year Early Archaic period along the Central
Texas Coast. The earlier sub-period ranges from about 7500 to 6800 B.P., and is based upon
radiocarbon dates from shoreline archaeological sites in the Nueces Bay area. Sites during this
period are predominantly oyster shell middens situated on upland margins overlooking the bay.
These middens are the result of exploitation of oysters as a food source, but more often than not
few artifacts have been found. Those chipped stone pieces that have been found resemble Central
and South Texas, Uvalde and Gower dart points. Worked shell pieces include flaked sunray
venus clamshell scrapers and knives. Faunal remains are mostly non-existant at these sites, but
that could be due to the relative rapid disintegration of bone in the silty soils. Otherwise, only
a few of the more resiliant fish otoloiths have been found, suggesting that the occupants of the
shoreline at this time relied heavily on shellfish as their primary food source.
A valid archaeological record for the next circa 1,000 years is largely unknown. However, the
later sub-period of Early Archaic shoreline occupation sites date to around 5800-4200 B.P.
Ricklis sites radiocarbon data from 15 site components dating to this period. Cultural
manifestations during this sub-period are primarily oyster shell lenses, with occasional fish
otoloiths and chert flakes. However, one site (41NU221 - McKinzie Site) yielded a relatively
thick shell midden, along with hundreds of chert flakes, two Bell points, a Tortugas point, and
two modified shells. Triangular dart points have also been found on the surface at the Maens Site
(41NU184) in Nueces County. Potential evidence of an Early Archaic structure in the form of
post molds were also documented at 41NU184 (Ricklis and Gunter 1986). Although animal
bones are not generally found at these sites, the presence of chipped stone dart points and
scrapers suggest that hunting must have been very much a part of the subsistence base.
Seasonally, data retrieved from oyster shells and fish otoliths indicate that shellfish were most
11

likely exploited in the winter through early spring, and fish were trapped or caught in the fall and
early spring. Although Ricklis (2004) surmises that based upon the number of sites discovered,
human populations may have increased during this later sub-period, he cautions that the number
of sites that could have existed during the earlier sub-period may well have been destroyed and
removed by a dynamically eroding landscape.
Middle Archaic (4200 - 3100 B.P.)
This period is poorly dated, and may reflect a hiatus in Gulf shoreline occupation between 4200
and 3100 B.P. Ricklis (2004) opines that the numerous midden shell deposits that were present
during the Early Archaic and Late Archic, are either absent during the Middle Archaic, or are
most certainly few in number. Environmentally, the relative absence could be attributed to a
rapid sea level rise and highstand during the Middle Archaic. Much more effort needs to be
exerted to find and research Middle Archaic components before this period can begin to be more
clearly understood.
Late Archaic (3100 - 950 B.P.)
Roughly 3,000 years ago, the sea level in the Gulf of Mexico stabilized to what we see it today.
Much like Central Texas, the archaeological sites along the Central Texas Gulf Coast are larger
than during the Early Archaic, the middens at these sites are thicker, and there are a relatively
wider variety of tools being were being produced and utilized. These data strongly suggest that
populations increased significantly, and sites were likely occupied for longer periods of time.
Concurrent with the stabilized shoreline, and in effect the biotic production offered in coastal
estuaries, gathering shellfish became a very important food source, but supplemented with fish
and white-tailed deer. Around the middle of the Late Archaic, ca. 2,000 years ago, fishing
became very much an important part of the subsistence base. One of the more important Late
Archaic archaeological sites investigated is the Kent-Crane site (41AS3). It is situated on a
shoreline bluff above Copano Bay, was likely occupied as early as about 2,700 years ago, and
extends for roughly 1,000 meters along the bluff. The intensive occupation at Kent-Crane is
manifested by a sea shell midden as much as 1.8-meters thick.
A second significant archaeological site in the Central Texas Gulf Coastal area that represents
a Late Archaic occupation period is the Mustang Lake site (41CL3). Once again, this site was
occupied during a period of apparent sea level stabilization very similar to today’s level. The first
occupations at the Mustang Lake site appear to be temporally co-eval with those at the KentCrane site. Once again, there are dense layers of oyster shells, along with bone, and chipped
stone. In the upper-most portion of these midden layers, archaeologists found sandy-paste pottery
sherds. Other significantly important Central Texas Gulf Coastal, Late Archaic sites investigated
at Ingleside Cove on the northeastern shore of Corpus Christi Bay include 41SP43 and 41SP120.
Late Prehistoric (950 - 250 B.P. [A.D. 1000 - 1700])
Along the Central Texas Coast area, a marked change in stone tools, the transition from the
shoulder-thrown atlatl to the bow and arrow as a more accurate and deadly killing weapon, and
the production of clay vessels for storage and cooking occurred around 950 B.P. (A.D. 10001700). Ricklis (2004) divides the Central Texas Coast Late Prehistoric period into two sub12

periods, the Initial Late Prehistoric and the Final Late Prehistoric.
Initial Late Prehistoric (A.D. 1000-1250/1300)
A robust Initial Late Prehistoric occupation excavated at 41SP120 dates to between A.D. 1022
and 1209. Fish consumption was prolific, with human dietary needs supplemented by the hunting
and consumption of deer. Arrow points recovered at 41SP120 included triangular, Fresno-like
specimens. Further north within the coastal area, Scallorn arrow points have been found in
association with plain, sandy-paste pottery sherds. Although sandy-paste pottery appears to have
been manufactured during the earlier part of this sub-period, there is evidence to suggest that
decorated wares such as Rockport Black-on-Gray were a result of evolving pottery
manufacturing and design during the later centuries.
Final Late Prehistoric (ca. A.D. 1250/1300 - 1700)
As with much of the rest of what we now know as Texas, the archaeological record in the Central
Texas Coast area reveals that the variety of chipped stone tools increased dramatically, and the
manufacturing of ceramic vessels in terms of quality, shape, and style changed significantly.
These changes demonstrated a marked advancement in tool production, and food storage and
cooking manufacturing technology, and further infer substantial changes in subsistence choices
and mobility patterns that occurred during this roughly 450-year period.
Chipped stone tools include smaller and presumably stream-lined arrow points such as the Perdiz
type, small unifacially flaked end scrapers, bifacially flaked knives, drills, and small prismatic
blades removed from blade cores. Pottery sherds found at period sites include those from bowls,
jars, and ollas which have been coated or decorated with asphaltum, and may have incised
designs, and even ceramic smoking pipes. Pottery types during the Final Late Prehistoric are
named as Rockport Incised, Rockport Crenelated, and Rockport Black-on-Gray; otherwise
referred to as the “Rockport Phase”. Remains found at Rockport Phase sites suggest the reliance
of fish as a food source probably reached its peak in prehistory, while the reliance on shellfish was
largely overshadowed.
There appears to be a non-discrete boundary between sites located close to the Gulf Coast
compared to those located roughly 40 kilometers (25 miles) inland. At about that imaginary line,
Rockport pottery typical of shoreline occupations wanes, whereas bone-tempered pottery so
typical of Late Prehistoric Toyah occupations (e.g., Collins 2004; Hester 2004; Hester and Parker
1970; Black 1986) tends to be prevalent. It was during the latter part of this Final Late Prehistoric
sub-period when the bison became so much a predominate part of Toyah occupation, that the
reliance on bison herds also penetrated the imaginary 40-kilometer line west of the Gulf Coast,
along the riverine environs leading to the coast. For example, at the Mellon site (41RF21) in
Refugio County, bison and deer bones were found in association with Scallorn and Perdiz arrow
points, and Rockport pottery sherds.
Historic (ca. A.D. 1700-Present)
Although the coast of the Gulf of Mexico was charted by Spanish Captain Alonso Alvarez de
Pineda in 1520, perhaps the earliest white men to see this land area of Texas were Alvar Nuñez
13

Cabeza de Vaca, and two or three of his shipwrecked companions. De Vaca traversed parts of
southeast and south Texas and left a diary of his five years spent traveling among the huntergatherers of Texas and northern Mexico (e.g., Hallenbeck 1971). His stay with the Miriami in
1533-34 indicates that groups of Native Americans would normally tether themselves to the easily
exploitable riverine environments in the fall, winter and summer, occasionally sending a hunting
party onto the grasslands to hunt deer. In the summer, many groups would live near each other
in the semiarid environs of South Texas to harvest prickly pear pads and other succulents
(Campbell and Campbell 1981:13-37). In addition, his diary speaks extensively of the ways of the
Karankawa Indians, a nomadic tribe that favored the modern site of the community of Refugio
as a campsite and eventual permanent village (Leffler 1996).
In 1722, the faithful Catholic fathers, with support from the Spanish Crown, established Mission
Señora del Espiritu Santo de Zúñiga in Goliad in an attempt to Christianize and otherwise
domesticate the Karankawas. Later, in 1793, Mission Nuestra Señora del Refugio was founded at
the confluence of the Guadalupe and San Antonio rivers (Leffler 1996). However, Indian
depredations caused the location of this mission to be moved twice; the final site to be on the
Mission River in what is now modern-day Refugio. In 1830, the mission was closed, but by that
time Mexican ranchos surrounded the area.
In the early 1830s, colonists from Ireland, New York, and New Orleans were enticed to settle in
the area under empressario land contracts. During the Texas Revolution in 1835, residents of the
area were forced to flee to the east during the “Runaway Scrape”, and the Mexican town of La
Bahia was nearly destroyed.
Following the Civil War, the area’s economy was bolstered by cattle ranching and corn farming.
However, by 1900 the cattle industry had declined significantly. With the coming of railways in
the early 1900s, and a renewed cotton demand, cotton became the most predominate cash crop. In
the 1920s, oil and gas were discovered in the area, and although somewhat diminished by the Great
Depression, production of oil and gas in the area has been a mainstay, and today is on a
springboard driving the economy of the area.

Site Types to be Expected Along the Karnes North Oil Pipeline
Prehistoric Open Campsites
Most numerous among the sites recorded in Bexar, Wilson, and Karnes counties are prehistoric
open campsites ranging in age from the Paleoindian period through the Historic period (see Figure
3). Some of these represent a single campfire where a very small group of Native Americans may
have camped for one night. Others are very large, covering very extensive areas representing large
groups of people that stayed for long periods, perhaps seasonally, with ancestral groups returning
to these same campsites over a period of several thousands of years. Cultural remains to be found
at these large campsites include among other items, an abundance of fire-cracked rocks
representing multiple hearths, a wide variety of chipped stone tools and the lithic debris that results
14

from making them, ground and smoothed stones used to grind nuts and seeds, faunal remains from
terrestrial and aquatic animals consumed, bone tools, pottery sherds, and mussel and snail shells.
Open campsites occur in all types of environments, whether that be in a plush riverine environment
that offered a wide variety banquet of plant and animal foodstuffs, or in the uplands away from
flowing water sources. Seasonally, the upland grasses, shrubs, cacti offered a different food source
that could be exploited such as various grass seeds, mesquite beans, prickly pear pads and tunas,
and agave hearts. In addition, at various times, bison were known to graze on the northern South
Texas Plains, and were highly sought after for use as food, hides, and bone tools (Dillehay 1974).
Depending upon the integrity of these open campsites, archaeologists and the Texas Historical
Commission consider these as perhaps the most significant types of sites in regard to their ability
to contribute to our understanding of south Texas prehistory. A few of the desired ingredients that
can indicate significance include cultural material that is buried beneath the surface in a wellpreserved, stratified, and relatively undisturbed context. Although these situations most frequently
occur within stratified terrace deposits adjacent to streams, they can also occur in upland settings
where the landscape has been generally stable through time. Other ingredients that archaeologists
look for in potentially significant campsites include good organic preservation in the form of
charcoal and/or charred plant remains, faunal preservation, temporally diagnostic stone tools or
ceramics, and intact features such as hearths.
Prehistoric Lithic Scatters or Procurement Sites
Lithic scatters are the next most common type of archaeological site that can be expected along
the Karnes North Oil Pipeline. These sites simply represent the chipped stone debris and broken
tools that were left behind when Native Americans made new tools or re-sharpened their old ones.
The general absence of fire-cracked rocks and other cultural material normally found at open
campsites suggest that they did not camp there, or remain there for any extended period of time (
However, small camp fires may have been used to heat-treat chert or quartzite cobbles to make
them more knappable). Yet, they were drawn to these isolated locales because of the natural
outcroppings or surface exposures of good quality raw material such as chert or quartzite cobbles.
Examples of chipped stone most commonly found at these sites include cobbles with one or two
flakes removed, called ‘tested cobbles’. That is, the Native Americans knew from experience the
quality of stone that could most easily be flaked and reduced for stone tool production, so they
‘tested’ the cobble to judge whether it was useable or not. If the quality was judged to be inferior,
then the cobble was tossed aside. That is why the majority of tested cobbles found on these sites
are of poor quality, coarse-grained material. While the finished stone tool products are carried
away from these sites, what remains are those tools broken during the manufacturing process, and
the thousands of pieces of debitage in the form of flakes and angular debris. Also unique to lithic
scatters where large cobbles are present are snapped ‘quarry blanks’. These are simply cobbles
flakes on both sides, reducing the cobble into a transportable ‘blank’ that can be used to further
reduce it and make finished stone tools from the flakes taken off of it. The unbroken quarry blanks
are usually not found on these sites because they have been carried off, presumably to areas of
south Texas where raw material is not readily available. The snapped or broken quarry blanks are
of little or no use, so they are discarded and left behind.

15

Lithic scatters range in age from the Paleoindian through the Historic periods and can be found on
any landscape setting where gravels or cobbles have been exposed. Notably, gravel outcrops that
were exposed to the surface a few hundred or thousand years ago could be deeply buried today,
and the opposite could also be true; it all depends on the terrain setting and the dynamics of
landscape evolution through time. Most lithic scatters in the Live Oak and McMullen County areas
have been documented along upper stream terraces abutting the eroded upland slopes.
Prehistoric Quarries and Procurement Sites
Prehistoric quarries and procurement also can range in age from the Paleoindian through Historic
periods, but differ from lithic scatters in that at those sites Native Americans exploited loose
gravels, but at times they specifically sought quarry sites where raw material such as cherts or
quartzites were not yet freed from their parent geologic formation, and they had to be ‘quarried’.
These types of sites are rare in south Texas for two reasons: 1) the geological exposures generally
do not present themselves, and 2) throughout Texas, even in central Texas, it is much easier to pick
up gravels from the surface than to try to mine them from hard rock. Quarried and chipped stone
remains likely to be found at these sites include large chunks of angular cherts or quartzites, as well
as parent material detritus, and flaking debris. Snapped quarry blanks can also be expected.
Although a handful of prehistoric quarries or procurement sites have been recorded in south Texas,
they are rare.
Prehistoric Burned Rock Middens
Although the documentation of burned rock middens are rather frequent in Bexar County, their
presence is absent in both Wilson and Karnes County. Burned rock middens result from a series
of multiple-use earth ovens that were constructed much like modern-day roasting pits are dug into
the earth for roasting a pig. With repetitive uses, as the larger rocks that serve as heating elements
in the earthen pit fracture and thus become less effective as a thermal source, they are ‘pitched out’
around the edge of the pit. As the pit becomes unusable, another is dug near by, and the procedure
repeated. Over time, these multiple pits and the ‘pitched out’ fire-cracked rocks coalesce together,
obscuring each pit as indiscernible. (For a full discussion of the formation of burned rock middens
and their documented presence in Texas, see Leach and Bousman 2001; Leach et al. 2001; Mauldin
et al. 2003).
Prehistoric Burial and Cemetery Sites
Although not common, isolated prehistoric burials and cemeteries have been documented in south
Texas. Individual and isolated burials have been found in association with open campsites in both
upland settings as well as in alluvial terraces along streams, but the largest prehistoric cemetery
found in proximity to the Karnes North Oil Pipeline is 41LK28, in Live Oak County.
Historic Sites
As discussed above in the Cultural Chronology portion of this report, although Spanish ranchers
had established large ranches in northern Mexico by the mid-16th century, and Spanish entradas
began penetrating south Texas in the 1700s and 1800s, there is no record of any sort of permanent
structures in the area during those periods (Chipman 1992), the area was generally not considered
safe for settlement by whites until after the Civil War in 1865, and white settlers then began
16

establishing smaller ranches and farmlands (Leffler 2011a, b).
Because of the vastness of the landscape and the relatively late settlement and development of
south Texas compared to east and central Texas and northern Mexico, historic sites are not
abundant, but they certainly do exist. The most common types to be encountered are related to
ranching and farming endeavors, or small communities from the 19th and 20th centuries. Site types
most commonly include farmsteads or ranches with corrals, cisterns, chimney and foundation
remains from both main houses and outbuildings, related trash dumps, an occasional family burial
or cemetery, school houses, churches, community buildings, and industry-related structures or
construction projects.

Archaeological Atlas Site Results
We preface this section by stating that although it presents the number of sites and their types
documented within each of the two counties, the results simply provide the data that is available.
In reality, the number of documented sites and their types are very heavily skewed based upon the
types of cultural resource surveys, and the limited areas of those surveys. That said, the data that
is available on the Texas Atlas is only as good as the areas of Texas that the surveys represent.
Most of this area of Texas has never been subjected to formal cultural resource surveys, so it is
conceded that the true character of the archaeological record is very poorly understood.
Nevertheless, the few surveys that have been accomplished provide at least some aspect of what
the region looks like from an archaeological perspective.
Bexar County
The first officially recognized local (Bexar County) institution organized to promote an interest
in Texas archaeology was the Witte Memorial Museum, established in 1926. The Witte continues
to this day to promote to citizens of all ages the need to preserve our cultural resources. Over 45
years ago, in the early 1970s, two other organizations were formed. The Center for Archaeological
Research (CAR) at the University of Texas at San Antonio was born in 1973. As the Center’s first
director, Dr. Tom Hester sought to foster a hand-in-hand relationship among amateur collectors,
landowners, and professional archaeologists. As such, he was instrumental in establishing the
Southern Texas Archaeological Association (STAA) in 1973, a dedicated bunch of individuals
who were (and still are) committed to documenting and preserving archaeological sites throughout
Bexar County and South Texas.
While we will never know for sure how many archaeological sites have been destroyed, or how
many still remain in Bexar County, we do know that professional and avocational archaeologists
have managed to document nearly 2,000 over the past 40 years. Although it may seem odd that
there have been more sites recorded in Bexar County than in all its surrounding counties, and the
reader could presume that there are simply a whole lot more sites in Bexar, there are other factors
that influence the documentation of sites. For example, the largest city in the area is San Antonio,
and as such the city has many historic structures that qualify as archaeological sites that skew the

17

numbers in favor of Bexar County. Thanks to the city’s historic preservation office and codes
enacted by the city, many have been recorded over the years.
It also makes sense that the more pieces of property that archaeologists are able to examine, the
more sites are likely to be found. Most archaeological projects are undertaken because of Federal
and State Antiquity codes that require cultural resource surveys be conducted when public money
(tax dollars) are used for construction, such as highways, schools, prisons, etc. In addition, military
installations and the National Park Service (NPS) are required by federal law to evaluate any
cultural resources within their lands. Because of Bexar County’s explosive population growth,
many military installations, and the Spanish missions administered by NPS, it seems reasonable
that Bexar County should have more archaeological sites documented than in the surrounding
counties. In addition, professional and avocational archaeologists and historians have been actively
involved for many years in the county.
Wilson County
As of February 5, 2014, there had been only 119 archaeological sites recorded within Wilson
County. This most probably directly reflects the paucity of professional archaeological surveys that
have been conducted in the county. Of the 199 sites, 57 are prehistoric open campsites along
streams, where temporally diagnostic artifacts suggest that the Wilson County area has been
occupied at least periodically by humans for the past 11,000 years. At another 49 sites,
archaeologists have found stone tools and lithic debitage that are typical of those left behind at
lithic scatters where Native Americans have exploited the stone raw material for manufacturing
stone tools. Of particular significance is the documentation of an early Paleoindian Clovis point
in a plowed field (41WN77). Otherwise, there are 28 historic archaeological components
documented. Among those are pottery kilns, farmstead and house sites such as that of Benito
Lopez, numerous trasch scatters, and an historic well and campsite along the old Lodi to
Sutherland Sprins Road (41WN117), to name a few. Designated State Archeological Landmarks
within the county include a prehistoric open campsite on the dge of Cibolo Creek in the Jackson
nature Park (41WN27), the Las Cabras Mission (41WN30), and the Wilson County Courthoues
and Jail in Floresville (Atlas 2014).
Karnes County
There have been a scant few archaeological surveys conducted within Karnes County, and as
expected, the small number of documented sites are a direct reflection of th at level of effort. As
of February 5, there had been 185 archaeological sites documented within Karnes County, and
nearly half of these had been documented along pipeline right-of-ways. Of the 185, 56 are
prehistoric open campsites ranging in age from the Paleoindian through the Late Prehistoric
periods (see Figure 5). On one of these sites, a human burial was discovered. Prehistoric open
campsites have been commonly found along stream terraces, however they also occasionally
located in generally upland areas away from modern streams, but in proximity to where ancient
streams or springs were once extant. For example, two potentially significant Paleoindian sites are
41KA7 (the Tessman Site), and 41KA95, both in the Poth/Falls City area, are located on upland
knolls. Prehistoric lithic scatters comprise 100 sites, along with 8 lithic procurement sites. Once
18

again, the diagnostics found at these sites suggest occupations from the Paleoindian through Late
Prehistoric periods. Historically, Karnes County is enriched with archaeological sites from Spanish
Colonial sites beginning in the mid-1700s, through 1900s Anglo-American farmsteads. A review
of documented sites thus far include three rural cemeteries with headstones indicating burials from
the 1850s. One of those cemeteries contains the remains of Jane Hardin, the wife of the infamous
John Wesley Hardin. Early Spanish presence has been documented at the headquarters of Rancho
Cibolo, as well as El Fuerte del Cibolo, a State Archaeological Landmark. The only other State
Archaeological Landmark in Karnes County is the courthouse in Karnes City. Otherwise, the many
other historic components represented include 1900s house sites and farmsteads, Hobson’s
Crossing on the San Antonio River, and many scatters of early period ceramics and glass (Atlas
2014).

Field Survey Goals and Methods
Goals
The project goals focused on archaeological issues that could be addressed by the types of data
obtained through pedestrian survey, along with limited shovel testing. The topics addressed were
site type, distribution, density, size, depth, and stratigraphy. The theoretical framework is
structured around patterns of settlement, mobility, subsistence, and social systems for the South
Texas region.
The goals of the project were to:
1)

locate and record cultural locations and sites in the project area using a systematic
survey methodology;

2)

quantify site size, as well as depth, and stratigraphy; and,

3)

place any diagnostic artifacts within the regional time frame.

Methods
Tierras Antiguas archaeologists were escorted to each of the five crossings by representatives of
Flatrock Engineering and Environmental, Ltd. The right-of way was clearly marked with wood
survey stakes and flagging tape at all crossings. Tierras Antiguas archaeologists then conducted
a thorough pedestrian survey of each crossing, and but with the exception of Crossing # 5 where
landowner access was denied on the west side of the river, archaeologists examined the surface on
both sides of each drainage, as well as all cutbanks. In addition, an evaluation was made of the
potential for buried cultural materials to exist if terraces were present.

19

At the same time, consultation was conducted with a Flatrock environmentalist onsite. These
consultations resulted in onsite decisions as to the most opportune locations from which to bore
under the river crossings in order to avoid any cultural resources that could ne be observed on the
surface and in cutbanks, as well as any cultural materials that may bee deeply buried in terrace
deposits.
The potential for buried and intact archaeological deposits to exist was very much an important
consideration in boring locales. In those cases where boring was to be conducted, Tierras Antiguas
archaeologists identified a buffer zone along both sides of the crossings that should not be
impacted.
Where shovel testing was conducted, they were dug in 20-cm levels, and all sediments were
screened through 1/4-inch wire mesh. All shovel test locations were documented with a hand-held
GPS, and recorded using standardized descriptions as prescribed by the U.S. Soil Conservation
Service (see Appendix A). In accordance with a general “no collection” policy, cultural materials
of a redundant nature, both prehistoric and historic, observed either on the surface or within shovel
tests were not to be collected. Instead, they were to be fully documented via sketches, field
photographs, and copious notes, and their locations recorded with a hand-held GPS. Following
that, they were to be returned to the surface if surface finds, or to the top 10 cm of the shovel tests.
Exceptions were diagnostic artifacts, particularly those artifacts which could be considered as
significant to the interpretation of Texas prehistory, such as Early Archaic-Paleoindian
transitional, or Paleoindian diagnostics. These were to be collected on a case-by-case basis, and
that decision was left up to the Principal Investigator and/or the Project Archaeologist.
Historic buildings, trash scatters, or other historic occurrences within the ROW were to be
documented as archaeological sites. In addition, any potentially historic buildings 45 years or older
that were located adjacent to the ROW were to be documented with photographs and included in
the report of investigations.
Sites were to be mapped using a pace-and-compass method, as well as a GPS. Field notes were to
be made about each site and sketch maps were to be drawn. Representative artifacts on each site
were to be gathered and photographed.

Results of the Investigations
This section identifies the locations of the five San Antonio River crossings, and describes the
levels of effort expended at each of those crossings. At all five crossings, Tierras Antiguas
concurred with Flatrock Engineering and TexStar representatives that boring was the appropriate
method for crossing the river, and thus avoiding any adverse impact to both known and potentially
intact cultural resources.

San Antonio River Crossing #1
Description
As shown in Figures 6 and 7, San Antonio River Crossing #1 is located on the easternmost
segment of the pipeline. In this case, due to landowner access issues, only the east side of the river
was examined. As shown in Figure 8, soils are Sinton sandy clay loam, occasionally flooded (St)
(Molina 2000; WebSoil Survey 2014). These soils are very deep along floodplains in this area of
Bexar County. The terrain on the approach to the river on the east side is gently sloping between
Shovel Tests 66 and 67, an apparent T-3 terrace that has been cultivated (Figure 9). Closer to the
river, the terrain drops off significantly into narrow, apparent relict T-2 and T-1 terrace remnants
(Figures 9-11).

Levels of Effort and Results
A thorough pedestrian examination of the heavily eroded eastern approach of the pipeline to the
San Antonio River was conducted, and as shown in Figures 9 and 10, surface visibility was
excellent. An examination of the slope revealed no lithic material other than pre-Holocene caliche.
Cutbank exposures were then examined to investigate the geological profile, as well as the
stratigraphic positioning of any cultural materials that may be present (see for example, Figure 12).
As a result, no cultural materials were observed, and the geologic profile suggested multiple
episodes of alluvial deposition, with concurrent or subsequent erosional events. These dynamic
flooding and erosional episodes have deposited gray clay, pale brown clay loam with caliche,
overlain by grayish brown clay loam. Table 1 presents the results of shovel testing (ST) in
centimeters below the surface (cmbs) in Shovel Tests 63 - 67.

Summary, Conclusions, and Recommendations
A thorough surface examination of heavily eroded and cultivated surfaces and recent erosional
cutbanks of the pipeline ROW as it crosses the San Antonio River revealed no cultural material,
nor was any cultural material found in any of the five shovel tests. In addition, TexStar will deeply
bore under the San Antonio River at this crossing, thereby not disturbing any cultural materials that
may exist. As such,Tierras Antiguas concurs that the ROW as currently aligned will have no
adverse impact upon cultural resources, and the pipeline should be allowed to be constructed as
designed.

Levels of Effort and Results
A thorough pedestrian examination of both approaches of the pipeline to the San Antonio River
was conducted, and as shown in Figures 16 and 17, surface visibility was generally excellent in
fallow agricultural fields. Otherwise shovel tests were more heavily concentrated on the lower
terraces adjacent to the river (Figures 14 and 18). Other than on newly documented site 41KA203
(see discussion below), an examination of the slopes revealed pre-Holocene fragmented caliche
with infrequent rounded chert gravels. Cutbank exposures were also examined to investigate the
geological profiles, as well as the stratigraphic positioning of any cultural materials that may be
present (see for example, Figures 19 and 20). As a result, no cultural materials were observed, and
the geologic profile suggested multiple episodes of alluvial deposition, with concurrent or
subsequent erosional events. These dynamic flooding and erosional episodes have deposited gray
clay, pale brown clay loam with caliche, overlain by grayish brown clay loam. Table 3 presents the
results of shovel testing (ST) in centimeters below the surface (cmbs) in Shovel Tests 46 - 62,
including those on 41KA203.

Archaeological Site 41KA203
Description
41KA203 (Figures
21-23) is a
prehistoric open
campsite of an
unknown age
apparently
occupied during
the Middle and
Late Archaic, as
well as the Late
Prehistoric Period.
In addition, an
early-mid 1900s
farmstead was
located on the site.
It is situated on
the northern end
of a prominent
knoll overlooking
the San Antonio
R i v e r v a l l e y. Figure 21. 41KA203 site map.
Significant historic
alteration has occurred so that remnants of what was likely the original vegetation consisting of
large mesquites, elms, and pecans now only are extant downslope near the river; otherwise the
pipeline right-of-way has been cleared and cultivated within and adjacent to the site.

34

The rounded knoll
gives way to more
steeply sloping
terrain to the
north, toward the
river, so that
artifacts can be
observed from
roughly 270 to
290 feet above
mean sea level
(amsl). Due to
recent machine
clearing, blading,
and cultivation by
the landowner,
surface visibility

Levels of Effort
and Results
A full pedestrian

excavated before being
notified that TexStar had
agreed to re-align the
ROW so to avoid the site.
Within the pipeline
ROW, the surface
distribution of prehistoric
artifacts covers an area
roughly 7,000 square
meters. However, as the
current landowner (Mr.
Robert Drees) persistently
pointed out, an abundant
quantity of prehistoric
artifacts are present
upslope and south of the
ROW, surrounding an oil
and gas processing
facility constructed within
the past three years.

Figure 24. Quarry blank found on the surface at 41KA203.

Prehistoric Component
Prehistoric artifacts
observed on the surface
within the pipeline ROW
included sparsely
scattered fire-cracked
rocks, a bifacial quarry
blank, a triangular biface,
a handful of core
reduction flakes, primary
and secondary biface
manufacturing flakes, and
mussel shell fragments
(see for examples,
Figures 24 and 25). Our
onsite assessment in
January 2013 was that Figure 25. Selected examples of artifacts found on the surface within
these artifacts had through the pipeline ROW: top row, left to right - triangular biface, core
time slowly washed fragment, biface manufacturing flake, fire-cracked rock; bottom row,
downslope from the knoll left to right - mussel shell umbo, undecorated whiteware, light green
apex, main portion of the glass, heavily patinated clear glass..
site, and were now
incorporated into the upper 10 cm of a cultivated sloping field within the pipeline ROW. The
36

landowner (Mr. Drees) concurred with our assessment, and stated that he noted how the prehistoric
artifacts were more apparent downslope as repeated cultivation over the years continued. The only
evidence of possible prehistoric materials found in any of the shovel tests were a few fragmented
mussel shells.
Mr. Drees has in his possession several Middle and Late Archaic dart points, made from chert and
chalcedony, as well as a small Late Prehistoric Scallorn point made from chert. In addition, he has
a round sandstone pendant. These all reportedly were collected from the upper portion of the site
before an oil and gas facility was constructed there.
Historic Component
No historic artifacts were
recovered from any of the
shovel tests. During our
surface examination
within the ROW we
observed an ephemeral
scatter of undecorated
whiteware, light green
and clear glass, and
yellow brick chunks with
no makers mark. Mr.
Drees indicated that a
house once stood upslope
to the south, but the house
had burned prior to his
family purchasing the
property in 1967, and that
a barn, other outbuildings,
a corral, and cattle
dipping vat upslope had
been bulldozed in years
past. A review of a 1960
USGS topographic map
indicated the presence of
two temporary structures
on the site at that time
(Map 2014).
The only structure still
standing in January 2014
was a large silo, along the
eastern periphery of the Figure 26. Dickey Silo @N3202574 E608384 along the eastern
pipeline ROW (Figure periphery of the pipeline ROW; facing east.
37

26). It measures 34 feet
high by 24 feet in
diameter, and is made
from vitrified tile. A
metal plate near the base
of the silo bears an
inscription indicating that
it was a product of the W.
S. Dickey Clay
Manufacturing Company
of Kansas City, Missouri
(Figure 27) and a few of
the clay tiles were
embossed with “Dickey
Silo Jug-Tight Kansas
City, MO” (Figure 28).
“Walter S. Dickey
(1862-1931) was a
newspaper publisher,
politician,
and
industrialist in Kansas
City, Missouri. Dickey
was born in Toronto and
moved to Kansas City in
1885. In 1889, he
established the W.S.
D i c k e y
C l a y
Manufacturing Company
which started out creating
ceramic pipes made of
‘burnt clay’ that were
used to drain farmland
via tile drainage. The
company had large plants
in several states and made
a fortune providing pipes
for buried conduit lines of
Bell Telephone” (Dickey
2014; Dickey Silo 2014).

Figure 27. Metal plate in the opening near the base of thE silo reads
“THE DICKEY SILO” “TIGHT AS A JUG” “W. S. DICKEY
CLAY MFG. CO.” “KANSAS CITY, MO”.

Figure 28. Some of the clay tiles are embossed with “DICKEY
SILO” “JUG-TIGHT” “KANSAS CITY, MISSOURI”.

The Dickey Jug-Tight
Silos were newly advertised for sale in 1915, when Dickey guaranteed his vitrified, salt glazed tiles

38

would last forever in the world’s best silo. They could be ordered in any specified size or tonnage
capacity, and would be shipped to the buyer for assembly (Dickey Silo 2014a, b).
Site Summary, Conclusions, and Recommendations
It is apparent that this hilltop/knoll site has been occupied at least periodically since the Middle
Archaic through the historic periods. It is situated on a high apex offering a panoramic view of the
San Antonio River valley, with the river only 150 meters to the north, across a gentle slope. As
such, the prehistoric inhabitants would have been afforded access to fresh water, as well as the
abundant riverine resources available, such as fish, mussels, and turtles, as well as seasonally
available fruits and nuts within the tree canopy and understory. In addition, the site’s location
afforded the occupants an opportune location from which to exploit upland game animals and plant
resources, as well as outcrops of chert gravels and cobbles for the production of stone tools and
use as heating elements for prehistoric hearths.
However, historic alteration including the construction of farmstead corrals, a cattle dipping vat,
house, silo, stock tank, etc., significantly altered the integrity of the prehistoric component of the
site in the early 1900s, before an oil and gas facility was constructed on the knoll within the past
three years. Subsequent to the establishment of the 1900s farmstead, the house was appraently
burned, the corrals, outbuildings, and dipping vat was bulldozed. Otherwise, the southern and
western-most portion of the site has been in cultivation for years. No artifacts were discovered
below the surface in any of the shovel tests, nor within the profile of a recently dug trash pit just
south of the ROW. Instead, within the pipeline ROW all artifacts either lay within the upper few
cm of the cultivated field, or on bladed clay hardpan. As such, the fire-cracked rocks and other
cultural materials are highly disturbed, widely dispersed, and lay in an apparent palimpsest
condition.
The historic component at this site is also heavily disturbed and other than archival research to add
to the information regarding early 19th-century farmsteads along the San Antonio River valley and
Karnes County, has minimal research potential in its current condition. However, the single
exception is the W. S. Dickey Silo, likely constructed between 1915 and 1930. Archival research
on these structures suggests that they were unique, and likely relatively rare in this region of Texas.
Our observations in January 2014 were that the structure is very much intact and stable, attesting
to Dickey’s claim that his vitrified, salt glazed tiles would last forever in the world’s best silo
(Dickey Silo 2014). Accordingly, even though the pipeline as currently designed will not directly
impact the silo, we recommend that the pipeline be realigned at least 30 meters remote from the
silo so that heavy equipment and trenching will not adversely impact the stability of the structure.
River Crossing #2 Summary, Conclusions, and Recommendations
A thorough surface examination of heavily eroded and cultivated surfaces and recent erosional
cutbanks of the pipeline ROW as it crosses the San Antonio River revealed no cultural material
on the north side of the river, nor was any cultural material found in any of the five shovel tests.
In addition, TexStar will deeply bore under the San Antonio River at this crossing, thereby not
disturbing any cultural materials that may exist. As such,Tierras Antiguas concurs that the ROW

39

as currently aligned on the north approach to the river will have no adverse impact upon cultural
resources, and the pipeline should be allowed to be constructed as designed.
However, the ROW approaching the San Antonio River from the south will encounter portions of
Site 41KA203. As discussed above, both the prehistoric and historic components of this site that
lie within the ROW have been heavily disturbed, and thus in these areas they are assessed as nonsignificant. Of concern is the rare and classical W. S. Dickey Silo constructed of vitrified and salt
glazed tile, likely constructed between 1915 and perhaps 1930. Even though the structure is not
within the ROW, in our assessment, it lies close enough to the ROW so that the introduction of
heavy equipment nearby could detrimentally impact the tower’s integrity and stability. Therefore,
we recommend that the pipeline ROW be re-routed at least 30 meters remote from the silo.
Otherwise, the pipeline will be deeply bored underneath the San Antonio River at this crossing,
thereby not disturbing any cultural materials that may exist. As such, Tierras Antiguas concurs that
the ROW as currently aligned to the north of 41KA203 will have no adverse impact upon cultural
resources, and the pipeline should be allowed to be constructed as designed in that area.

examination of the slopes revealed no lithic material other than highly fragmented pre-Holocene
caliche. Cutbank exposures were then examined to investigate the geological profiles, as well as
the stratigraphic positioning of any cultural materials that may be present (see for example, Figures
36 and 37). As a result, no cultural materials were observed, and the geologic profiles suggested
multiple episodes of alluvial deposition, with concurrent or subsequent erosional events. These

River Crossing #3 Summary, Conclusions, and Recommendations
A thorough surface examination of heavily eroded and cultivated surfaces and recent erosional
cutbanks of the pipeline ROW as it crosses the San Antonio River revealed no cultural material
on either the north or south side of the river, nor was any cultural material found in any of the
12 shovel tests. In addition, TexStar will deeply bore under the San Antonio River at this
crossing, thereby not disturbing any cultural materials that may exist. As such, Tierras Antiguas
concurs that the ROW as currently aligned on both approaches to the river will have no adverse
impact upon cultural resources, and the pipeline should be allowed to be constructed as
designed.

San Antonio River Crossing #4

Description
As shown in Figures 38 and 39, San Antonio River Crossing #4 is located near the eastern end of
the pipeline. As shown in Figure 40, and briefly described in Table 6, three different soils types
will be encountered at this crossing (Molina 2000; Web Soil Survey 2014). The western approach
to the river is generally gently sloping, lowlands that are occasionally flooded, and are currently
used as open hay fields. The eastern approach is more steeply sloping, is more heavily wooded, and
currently used for cattle grazing. A farmstead with a barn, outbuildings, and house occupies the
eastern side of the river. However, the pipeline will not impact any of these structures, and in fact
is proposed for construction immediately adjacent to two previously installed pipelines, a Tierra
Line in the 1930s, and a much more recent Atlas gas line. A prehistoric open campsite (41KA202)
was documented some 450 m northwest of the crossing, and a possibly historic barn was
photographed on the ROW’s periphery on the south side of the river.

Site 41KA202
Description
41KA202
(Figures 47 and

open campsite of
an unknown age,
consisting of chert
stone tools,
debitage, faunal
remains, and
mussel shells. It is

Antonio River,
but is now on a
cusp of the
modern 100-year
floodplain. The
site area has been
cleared and
cultivated in the
recent past so that
it now lies within
a hay field and
cattle pasture. As
such , s urface
visibility was 70
to 100 percent
during our
examination of
the site in
December 2013.
The San Antonio Figure 48. Photo of 41KA202; facing southeast.
River channel courses some 220 m to the east. Surface elevation at the site ranges from 299 to 301
feet above mean sea level (amsl). Soils on the site consist of Pernitas sandy clay loam, deposits
57

commonly found on convex uplands in this area of Karnes County (Molina 2000; Web Soil Survey
2014).
Levels of Effort and Results
An inspection of the surface suggests that the site covers approximately 5,000 square meters (see
Figure 47). Artifacts observed on the surface included ten non-heat treated interior and exterior
chert flakes, a unifacially worked scraper, the medial portion of a biface, widely scattered firecracked rocks, bone fragments, and mussels shells (see Figure 49 for examples). Six shovel tests
were excavated to evaluate the horizontal extent and vertical integrity of the site. As shown in
Figures 38 and 39, and described in Table 6 above, four of the six shovel tests yielded artifacts.
However, without exception, the artifacts were within the upper approximately 22-cm plow zone.

Figure 49. Selected examples of artifacts observed on the surface at 41KS202: Top row, left to
right – unifacial scraper, bifacial core reduction flake, biface manufacturing flake, biface midsection, two mussel shell fragments; Bottom row – bone fragments.

Site Summary, Conclusions, and Recommendations
41KA202 appears to have been a medium-sized prehistoric open campsite occupied during and
unknown period in prehistory, and tethered to a backwater slough of the nearby San Antonio River.
As such, the occupants were able to exploit both aquarian mussels and fish, as well as upland game
animals. Although not diagnostic, the flaking pattern, estimated size, and patination on the single
biface imply a Late Archaic occupation.
58

Because of historic cultivation as well as natural deflation processes, the overall integrity of this
site is significantly diminished. Our assessment is that the research value of this site is minimal,
other than its positioning on the landscape. Accordingly, it has little ability to contribute
significantly to our understanding of this area of Texas prehistory. In view of this, Tierras Antiguas
recommends that construction of the Karnes North Pipeline as currently aligned be allowed to
proceed, with no further investigations.

Description
As shown in Figures 51 and 52, San Antonio River Crossing #5 is located near the northwestern
end of the pipeline in western Wilson County. As shown in Figure 53, and briefly described in
Table 8, four different soils types will be encountered at this crossing (Taylor 1977; Web Soil
Survey 2014). As such, they likewise imply the potential for the preservation of intact cultural
resources to exist. The western approach is generally low, modern floodplain along an oxbow in
the river, while the eastern approach generally courses through elevated cultivated fields

Levels of Effort and Results
A thorough pedestrian examination of both approaches of the pipeline to the San Antonio River
was conducted, and as shown in Figures 54 and 55, surface visibility was generally excellent in
fallow agricultural fields. Otherwise shovel tests were more heavily concentrated on the lower
terraces adjacent to the river (Figures 51 and 52). Cutbank exposures were also examined to
investigate the geological profiles, as well as the stratigraphic positioning of any cultural materials
that may be present (see for example, Figure 56). The geologic profile suggested multiple episodes
of alluvial deposition, with concurrent or subsequent erosional events. These dynamic flooding and
erosional episodes have deposited pale brown and grayish brown sand, gray clay, pale brown clay
loam with caliche, overlain by grayish brown clay loam. Table 9 presents the results of shovel
testing (ST) in centimeters below the surface (cmbs) in Shovel Tests 1-13, including those on
41WN123 and 41WN124.
41WN123 is a small prehistoric open campsite discovered on an upper terrace on the west side of
the river. 41WN124 is the late 19th and early 20th century Mackey Brick Factory located on the east
bank of the river. Both of these are discussed below.

Archaeological Site 41WN123
Description
41WN123 (Figures 57 and 58) is a
prehistoric open campsite occupied
sometime during the Toyah Phase of the
Late Prehistoric period, roughly 350 to
700 years ago. Artifacts remaining
include fire-cracked rocks, mussel shells,
and a pottery sherd. It is situated on an
upper terrace of the San Antonio River.
The site area has been cleared and
cultivated in the recent past so that it now
lies within a hay field and cattle pasture.
As such, surface was 80 to 100 percent
during our examination of the site in
January 2014. The San Antonio River
channel courses some 50 m to the east.
Surface elevation at the site ranges from
418 to 420 feet above mean sea level
(amsl). Soils on the site consist of Karnes
loam, deposits commonly found on gently
sloping upper terraces in this area of

Levels of Effort and Results
An inspection of the
surface suggests that the
site covers approximately
2,250 square meters (see
Figure 57). Artifacts
observed on the surface
included three pieces of
sandstone fire-cracked
rocks, eight mussels shell
umbo fragments, and a
single pottery sherd (see
Figure 59 for examples).
The
pottery sherd
exhibited a brown,
undecorated exterior, with
a tan interior, and its
coarse sand temper was
heavily blackened.
Although the surface was Figure 58. Photo of 41WN123; facing southeast.
thoroughly examined no
ch ipped stone was
observed. Because the site
was not within the
pipeline ROW, no shovel
tests were excavated to
evaluate the horizontal
extent and vertical
integrity of the site.
However, as noted above,
the artifacts lay on the
surface of a cultivated hay
field
with
an
approximately 16-cm
plow zone.

Summary,
Conclusions, and
Recommendations

Figure 59. Selected examples of artifacts observed on the surface at
41WN123: mussel shell umbos, pottery sherd, fire-cracked rock.

41WN123 appears to have
been a relatively small prehistoric open campsite occupied at least one time during the Toyah phase
67

of the Late Prehistoric period, and tethered to the nearby San Antonio River. As such, the
occupants were able to exploit aquarian mussels, turtles and fish, as well as seasonal pecans. In
addition, the site was conveniently located in an upland setting where both large and small game
animals were presumably available. Because of historic cultivation as well as natural deflation
processes, the overall integrity of this site is likely significantly diminished. However, we were
unable to test it, so our assessment is that the research value will remain an unknown. Notably, the
site lies on the periphery of the proposed Karnes North Pipeline ROW. In view of this, Tierras
Antiguas recommends that construction of the Karnes North Pipeline as currently aligned be
allowed to proceed, with no further investigations.

Archaeological Site 41WN124 - Mackey Brick Factory
Description
This is the site of
the Mackey Brick
and Tile Company
in operation in
Calaveras, Texas
in western Wilson
County in the late
1880s and 1890s.
It is situated on an
upper terrace, but
within
the
modern-day 100
year floodplain,
along the eastern
edge of the San
Antonio River
(Figure 60; see
also, Figure 52).
This area for a
brick and tile
plant was selected Figure 60. Mackey Brick and Tile Factory (41WN124) site map.
by Nelson Mackey
in 1887 because of its fine quality clay, as well as the dense supply of mesquite and oaks for fuel
(Kosub and Kosub 2014). Current riverine vegetation such as pecans, elms, and oaks line the
river’s edge. Otherwise, dense thorny brush has overgrown the disturbed and fragmented remains
of the brick factory and yard. The eastern edge of the site proper is being used for cultivated
farming and cattle pasture.

Levels of Effort
and Results
Upon our drive
from the north,
and our walk to
the west and

broken bricks (Figure 61). A single shovel test (ST9; Figure 62) excavated on this southernmost
portion of the site yielded no evidence of cultural material (see Table 8).
Site Summary, Conclusions, and Recommendations
In 1887, entrepreneur Nelson Mackey purchased several hundred acres in the Calaveras area and
devoted 135 acres to the manufacturing site of brick and tile. The surrounding several hundred
acres were used by woodcutters he employed to supply fuel for the large kilns at the site. A San
Antonio Aransas Pass (SAAP) rail spur was brought to the site to transport bricks and tile to many
areas throughout Texas. The factory met its demise in the late 1890s due to fierce competition from
other brick manufacturers (Kosub and Kosub 2014). Our January 2014 observations revealed
multiple collapsed stacks of yellow bricks with no makers marks along the old rail spur, as well
within the dense overgrowth north of the proposed pipeline ROW. Within the proposed ROW,
there were widely scattered and small areas of bricks. A single shovel test revealed no evidence
of cultural material. The pipeline will be deeply bored under the San Antonio River, and will exit
roughly 50-75 meters east of the site. As such, this portion of the site will not be impacted by
construction, and Tierras Antiguas recommends that construction of the Karnes North Pipeline as
currently aligned be allowed to proceed, with no further investigations.

Survey Summary, Conclusions, and Recommendations

A pedestrian survey with shovel testing conducted at five river crossings within the proposed
Karnes North Oil Pipeline right-of-way resulted in the discovery of three prehistoric open
campsites – 41KA202 , 41KA203, 41WN123. On 41KA203, an early 1900s farmstead was
constructed. A fourth site documented is the 1880s-1890s Mackey Brick and Tile Factory –
41WN124.
41KA202, as previously discussed in detail, is situated some 400 m west of River Crossing #4, and
is a medium-sized open campsite occupied during an unknown period, or periods, in prehistory.
However, our assessment is that it lies on the southern periphery of the ROW that will not be
significantly impacted by pipeline construction, has been heavily disturbed by historic cultivation,
and as such possesses little research potential.
41KA203 is a relatively large prehistoric open campsite located on an upland knoll/ridge near the
San Antonio River’s Crossing #2. The Karnes North Pipeline ROW that could have potentially
impacted this site courses through the western portion, which is sloping and heavily disturbed by
cultivation. Shovel testing revealed no evidence of cultural material below the plow zone. Upon
this site, a house, outbuildings, etc. had been constructed in the early 1900s. The only structure
remaining was a fine example of a ca. 1915-1930 Wilson Dickey Silo, on the periphery of the
70

proposed pipeline ROW. In this case, Tierras Antiguas recommended that the ROW be shifted so
that it was some 30-50 meters remote from the standing silo so to avoid possible damage to the
silo’s foundation and overall structure. The pipeline’s installers (TexStar) concurred, and the
pipeline was re-routed accordingly.
41WN123 is a relatively small prehistoric open campsite located on the periphery of the pipeline
ROW that crosses the San Antonio River at River Crossing #5. Because of its location on the
periphery of the ROW, it should not be impacted by pipeline construction. A sandstone tempered
brownware pottery sherd found on the surface of a cultivated field suggests that the site was
occupied at least once during the Toyah phase of the Late Prehistoric period, some 350-700 years
ago. The context of fire-cracked rocks and mussel shells on this site were observed to be heavily
disturbed due to cultivation, and as mentioned, were not directly within the pipeline ROW.
Accordingly, Tierras Antiguas recommends that the Karnes North Pipeline in this immediate area
be allowed to be constructed as designed.
41WN124 is the potentially historically significant Mackey Brick and Tile Factory, in operation
during the late 1880s and 1890s. The proposed ROW for the Karnes North Pipeline will not impact
any portion of the site, as the pipeline will be deeply bored under the San Antonio River, and exit
the surface in a cultivated field several meters east of the site. Therefore, we recommend that the
pipeline construction as it is currently designed be allowed proceed with no further archaeological
investigations.
However, as always following a Phase I survey, Tierras Antiguas further recommends that if any
additional, undiscovered cultural resources are encountered during development along the entire
pipeline right-of-way, such finds should be examined and evaluated by Tierras Antiguas, or by any
qualified archaeological consultant.
No artifacts were collected during this project.
