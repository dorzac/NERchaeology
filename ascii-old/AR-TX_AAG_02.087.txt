ABSTRACT
An archaeological survey of two proposed road rights-of-way for an extension of
the Southeast Inner Loop in Williamson County, Texas was conducted by American
Archaeology Group LLC (AAG) in June 2004 and April 2006. The survey was
conducted for the City of Georgetown under the auspices of Texas Antiquities Permit
Number 3463. Fieldwork was implemented in two phases, one for the originally
proposed right-of-way (ROW) and a second for an alternate ROW for the western half of
the loop extension. The rights-of-way are 400 feet (122 meters) wide and have a
combined length of approximately 22,600 feet (6,888 meters). Both phases of fieldwork
involved pedestrian surface survey, shovel testing and backhoe trenching. The survey
located and documented one site, 41WM1105, an historic farmstead with several
standing structures including a house, a garage, barns and sheds. The house and other
standing structures were apparently constructed between 1914 and 1923. The survey also
located remnants of two historic rock walls possibly dating to the nineteenth century.
Neither the site nor the rock walls are considered eligible for inclusion on the National
Register of Historic Places (NRHP) or worthy of designation as a State Archaeological
Landmark (SAL). Therefore, AAG recommends that construction within the project area
be allowed to proceed as planned and that monitoring during construction by an
archaeologist is not necessary. No artifacts were collected; therefore, no curation was
made.

INTRODUCTION
The City of Georgetown plans to construct an extension of the Southeast Inner
Loop in Williamson County, Texas (Figure 1). Two road rights-of-way are under
consideration (Figure 2). One is approximately 13,000 feet (3,962 meters) in length and
follows a sigmoid-shaped route that trends east-west, beginning approximately 1,600 feet
west of the intersection of CR 110 and Carlson Cove and ending at the intersection of CR
104 and Preliminary State Highway 130. The second proposed right-of-way (ROW), an
alternative route for the western half of the proposed loop, is approximately 9456 feet
(2882 meters) in length. It begins at the same point as the first and follows a route that
first trends south and then curves northeast to intersect with the originally proposed
ROW. The width of the proposed rights-of-way is 400 feet (122 meters). Construction
impacts are not expected to exceed 4-6 feet (1.2-1.8 meters).
Permitting approval for the project is contingent upon compliance with state
provisions for the protection of cultural resources including the Antiquities Code of
Texas (Title 9, Chapter 191, Texas Natural Resources Code of 1977) and guidelines
established by the Archeology Division of the Texas Historical Commission (THC), the
state agency which administers the Antiquities Code. In accordance with these
provisions, Kasberg Patrick & Associates LLP retained American Archaeology Group
LLC (AAG) to conduct an intensive archaeological survey of the project area. The
objective of the survey was to detect and assess cultural resources that could potentially
be impacted by the construction of the Southeast Inner Loop. Prior surveys in
Williamson County have documented significant prehistoric and historic archaeological
sites, though no sites registered with the THC prior to AAGâs investigation lie within the
boundaries of the project area.
The survey was conducted under the auspices of Texas Antiquities Permit
Number 3463. Fieldwork was implemented in two phases, one in June, 2004 for the
original proposed right-of-way (ROW) and a second in April, 2006 for the alternate
ROW. Both phases of fieldwork involved pedestrian surface survey, shovel testing and
backhoe trenching. The survey located and documented one site, 41WM1105, an historic
farmstead with standing structures (house and garage with associated barns and sheds)
built early twentieth century. The survey also located remnants of two rock walls
possibly dating to the nineteenth century. Neither the site nor the rock walls is
considered eligible for inclusion on the National Register of Historic Places (NRHP) or
worthy of designation as a State Archaeological Landmark (SAL). Therefore, AAG
recommends that construction within the project area be allowed to proceed as planned
and that monitoring during construction by an archaeologist is not necessary.
This report provides archaeological and historical information relevant to the
survey and describes the implementation and results of fieldwork. Based on the results of
the investigation, AAG recommends that construction of the proposed Southeast Inner
Loop be allowed to proceed.

ENVIROMENTAL SETTING
Regional Environment
The project area is located within the Texan biotic province as defined by Blair
(1950:110-102) based on unique associations of topographic features, soils, climate,
vegetation types, and terrestrial vertebrates exclusive of birds (Figure 3). This province
constitutes a broad ecotone between the forests of the Austroriparian province of eastern
Texas and the western grasslands. Areas of the province with clay soils once supported
tall-grass prairies. Widespread cultivation of these areas in historic times has led to
sandy soils characterized by oak-hickory forests dominated by post oak (Quercus stellata),
blackjack oak (Quercus marilandica), and hickory (Carya buckleyi). Though the province
is classified by Thornwaite (1948) as having a moist, subhumid climate, rainfall barely
exceeds water need.

Figure 3: Biotic provinces of Texas (adapted from Blair 1950 and TPWD 2007).
Local Setting
The project area is located in southeast Georgetown, Williamson County, Texas
(see Figure 2). It is drained by intermittent streams that flow north and west into
Mankins Branch, a tributary of the San Gabriel River. The confluence of Mankins
Branch and the San Gabriel River lies 3.53 miles (5.68 kilometers) northeast of the
approximate center of the project area (UTM 14R 630720 E, 3388490 N). Elevations in

4

the project area range from approximately 835 feet above mean sea level (amsl) to 715
feet amsl. At present the project area is used primarily for farmland and pasture.
Soils
Sheet 48 of the Soil Survey of Williamson County, Texas (Werchan and Coker
1983) depicts six soil series in the study area: Austin, Austin-Whitewright Complex,
Branyon, Castephen, Heiden, and Houston Black (Figure 4). The soils on the upper
portion of the project developed on Cretaceous Austin Chalk, an interbedded microgranular limestone alternating with marl beds. Soils on the lower portion of the project
developed on Buda Limestone, a poorly bedded and thin bedded, argillaceous, nodular
limestone. All of the soils are residual in situ soils and have a very low potential for
buried intact assemblages of artifacts. Most of the soils sampled were very eroded and
had thin soil solum.
The Austin silty clay consists of moderately deep soils underlain by fractured
chalk. These soils occur on uplands on broad ridges and adjoining side slopes. Slopes
range from 1 to 6 percent. The thickness of the solum ranges from 51 to 102 centimeters.
The soils developed on fractured chalky limestone under a prairie vegetation of mid and
tall grasses. The A horizon is a 20 to 51 centimeters thick. Colors are dark grayish
brown, very dark grayish brown, light yellowish brown, or light brownish gray silty clay.
The horizon is moderately alkaline. The B horizon is approximately 20 to 81 centimeter
thick, grayish brown, pale brown, brown, or light olive brown silty clay with common
soft and hard calcium carbonate concretions. The horizon is calcareous and moderately
alkaline. The C horizon is approximately 36 centimeter thick, finely divided, weathered
soft and crumbly chalk that has interstices filled with loamy material. The colors are
reddish yellow, very pale brown, light brown, yellow or light gray. The horizon is very
calcareous and moderately alkaline (Werchan and Coker 1983).
The Austin-Whitewright Complex consists of gently sloping to gently undulating
soils of the uplands. Slopes range from 1 to 5 percent. This complex is made up of about
50 percent Austin soils, 35 percent Whitewright soils and 15 percent other soils. The
Austin soils are described above. Whitewright soils are shallow well-drained loamy
soils. The solum ranges from 28 to 48 centimeters. The soils formed on weakly to
strongly cemented, platy chalk. The A horizon is about 13 centimeters thick. Colors are
light brownish gray, pale brown, grayish brown, or dark grayish brown silty clay loam.
The horizon is calcareous and moderately alkaline. The B horizon is approximately 25
centimeter thick, light brownish gray, light gray, pale brown, light yellowish brown, very
pale brown, or brown silty clay loam with few to common chalk fragments. The horizon
is calcareous and moderately alkaline. The Cr horizon is approximately 58 centimeter
thick weathered, weakly to strongly cemented, whitish platy chalk. The horizon is very
calcareous and moderately alkaline (Werchan and Coker 1983).

Brackett clay loam consists of shallow well-drained, loamy soils on uplands.
Slopes range fro 3 to 30 percent. The thickness of the soil solum ranges from 13 to 41
centimeters. The soil forms in interbedded marl and limestone. The A horizon is 8 to 13
centimeters thick, light brownish gray, brown, grayish brown, pale brown, or very pale
brown, clay loam, calcareous, gravelly clay loam, or gravelly silty clay loam. The soil is
moderately alkaline and contains about 15 percent small limestone fragments. The B
horizon is approximately 28 centimeter thick, light brownish gray, very pale brown, pale
brown, brown, light yellowish brown, or grayish brown clay loam, loam, gravelly clay
loam, or gravelly loam with few weakly cemented small calcium carbonate fragments
and masses. The horizon is calcareous and moderately alkaline. The Cr horizon is
approximately 111 centimeter thick weathered, calcareous loam or silt loam that is
interbedded with weakly cemented, platy, limestone (Werchan and Coker 1983).
The Branyon series consists of deep, moderately well-drained soils that developed
on clayey soils of high Pleistocene terraces. Slopes are generally less than 1 percent but
range up to 3 percent. The thickness of the solum ranges from 152 to 183 centimeters.
The A horizon is a 63 to 152 centimeters thick. Colors are very dark gray, dark gray or
gray clay. The horizon has a few concretions of calcium carbonate in the upper part to
many concretions in the lower part and is moderately alkaline. The AC horizon is
approximately 40 centimeter thick, gray, grayish brown, pale brown, very pale brown or
light brownish gray clay. The horizon has prominent slickenside and shiny surface on
peds. The horizon has common calcium carbonate concretions and is moderately
alkaline. The C horizon is approximately 30 centimeter thick, light gray or light
brownish gray, clay, silty clay or silty clay loam. Water-bearing gravels and sand are at a
depth of 4.6 to 7.6 meters in most localities (Werchan and Coker 1983). Branyon clays
were located at BHT 54 and BHT 56 near the boundary of the Austin and Branyon map
units (Figure 4).
The Castephen series consists of shallow, well-drained soils that developed on
uplands and on interbedded chalk and marl. In the study area, Castephen slopes range
from 1 to 3 percent. The thickness of the solum ranges from 20 to 51 centimeters. The A
horizon is approximately 40 centimeters thick. The horizon consists of dark brown,
brown, dark grayish brown or very dark grayish brown silty clay. The horizon is
calcareous and moderately alkaline. The Cr horizon is approximately 15 centimeter thick
chalky limestone interbedded with marl and limey earth (Werchan and Coker 1983).
The Heiden series in the study area consists of well-drained, gently sloping to
sloping, calcareous, clayey soils on uplands. The Heiden series soils are found on 1 to 3
percent slopes. The combined A and A/C horizon of Heiden soils ranges from about 101
to 165 centimeters thick. The A horizon is a 30 to 91 centimeters thick, very dark
grayish brown, dark grayish brown, or olive gray, clay. The horizon is moderately
alkaline and calcareous and has weak, fine to weak, coarse angular blocky structure. The
horizon contains up to 70 percent rounded siliceous gravels with less than 5 centimeter
diameter. Common calcium carbonate nodules are found in the lower horizon. The A/C
horizon is 50 to 102 centimeter thick, yellowish brown, olive gray or olive clay with a
few faint mottles and streaks and weak, coarse, angular, blocky, structure. The horizon is

7

moderately alkaline and calcareous with common calcium carbonate soft masses and
nodules. The C horizon is 30 centimeter thick mottled olive and yellow shaley clay with
massive structure. The C horizon is moderately alkaline and calcareous (Werchan and
Coker 1983).
The Houston Black clay consists of deep, moderately well drained, clayey soils
on uplands. Slopes range from 1 to 3 percent. The thickness of the combined A and AC
horizons is 152 to 254 centimeters thick. The soils formed in marine silty clays and
shales. The A horizon is a 15 to 81 centimeters thick, dark gray to very dark gray clay.
The horizon is moderately alkaline and contains a few chert pebbles. When dry the soils
have cracks ranging from 1 to 8 centimeters in width that extend in depth of more than 61
centimeters. The AC1 horizon is approximately 56 centimeter thick, grayish brown, dark
grayish brown, brown, or light olive brown clay with common fine to medium to grayish,
yellowish, or olive mottles. The horizon has prominent slickenside and shiny surface on
peds. The horizon is calcareous and moderately alkaline. The AC2 horizon is
approximately 20 centimeter thick, dark grayish brown, light brownish gray, or grayish
brown clay, silty clay or shale with common to many olive or yellowish mottles. The
horizon is moderately alkaline (Werchan and Coker 1983).

ARCHAEOLOGICAL BACKGROUND
Williamson County is located in the North Central Texas cultural-geographical
region as defined by Biesaart et al. (1985:76). This area is referred to as Central Texas
by most archaeologists and is rich archaeological sites.
Summaries relevant to the prehistory of Williamson County and vicinity have
prepared by various archaeologists, primarily as a result of work at the Fort Hood
Military Installation (Guderjan et al. 1980; Skinner et al. 1981, Thomas 1978; Roemer et
al. 1985, Carlson et al. 1986), Belton Reservoir (Shafer et al. 1964), the Youngsport site
(Shafer1963), and Stillhouse Hollow Reservoir (Shafer et al. 1964: Sorrow et al. 1967).
Weir (1976), and Prewitt (1981, 1985) have published summaries of the region.
Additional work by Prewitt (1974) at the Loeve-Fox site has also provided additional
data on local inhabitants in Williamson County, Texas. Most recently, two thorough
articles concerning Central Texas were published in Volume 66 of the Bulletin of the
Texas Archeological Society. These works, entitled âForty Years of Archaeology in
Central Texas,â by Michael B. Collins (1995) and âImplications of Environmental
Diversity in the central Texas Archaeological Regionâ by Linda Wootan Ellis, G. Lain
Ellis, and Charles D. Frederick (1995), represent a major synthesis of the vast amount of
collected data for the region. The following discussion is taken primarily from the works
cited above.
Paleoindian Period
According to Willey and Phillips (1958:80), problems exist with the term
âPaleoindian;â nevertheless, the term is used ubiquitously in the archaeological literature,
often to refer to prehistoric cultures oriented toward big game procurement as a primary
means of subsistence. Collins (1995:381) posited instead that during Clovis times,
Paleoindians exploited a diverse range of fauna that not only included large herbivores
such as mammoth, bison, and horse, but also included smaller animals such as turtles,
land tortoises, alligators, mice, badgers, and raccoons. The results of excavation of a
cultural pavement at Kincaid Rockshelter suggest that the Paleoindian inhabitants of the
site returned there repeatedly as part of a regular hunting and gathering strategy, in
contrast with the migratory subsistence pattern of nomadic hunters who only pursued big
game. Thus, it is probable that the Clovis diet included a broad array of plants (Collins
1990; Collins et al. 1989).
According to Skinner et al. (1981:13), the Paleoindian period is one of the least
understood times periods in Central Texas prehistory, primarily because so few sites have
been excavated. As of 1985, for example, only two Paleoindian sites had been reported
for Bell County (Biesaart et al. 1985:125). Evidence of this period often occurs in the
form of surface collected materials found over much of Central Texas. At Fort Hood,
distinctive projectile points representing this period are found in multicomponent surface
sites and as isolated finds (Carlson et al. 1986:125). Generally, it is believed that this
period lasted from about 10,000 B.C. until 6000 B.C. Diagnostic artifacts of the period

9

include dart types Angostura, Clovis, Folsom, Golondrina, and Plainview as defined by
Suhm and Jelks (1962) and Turner and Hester (1985).
These early sites are often found on old terraces of major river drainages and may
be more distant from major streams than some more recent occupations (Bryan 1931).
Some rockshelters, such as the Levi site, were intensively occupied even though they are
located a considerable distance from major rivers. The only example of a rockshelter in
Central Texas immediately adjacent to a major drainage known to contain Paleoindian
occupation is the Horn Shelter (41BQ46) in Bosque County, Texas (Redder 1985).
Collins (1999) reported on the Gault Site, a major Clovis site in Bell County that is still
being studied.
Archaic Period
The Archaic represents a broad cultural time period, which lasted from
approximately 8500 Before Present (B.P.) to 1250 B.P. in Central Texas. According to
Prewitt (1981:71), âThe Archaic Stage dominates all other remains in Central Texas.â
Prewitt (1981) has subdivided the Archaic into eleven phases. LeRoy Johnson (1987)
has questioned the validity of the phase concept as used by Prewitt, especially the phases
occurring before the Middle Archaic. Carlson et al. (1986:15) has grouped these into
Early, Middle, Late and Terminal Periods.
According to Prewitt (1981:77-78), during the Early Archaic there was a âstrong
orientation toward the gathering aspect rather than the hunting, and a mobile population
was of low density.â These characteristics apparently were predominant during the
Circleville, San Geronimo, and Jarrell phases (8500-5000 B.P.). In the Middle Archaic,
food gathering apparently became very specialized as evidenced by the presence of
numerous burned rock middens/mounds (Prewitt 1981:78-80). Prewitt divides the Middle
Archaic into the Oakalla, Clear Fork, Marshall Ford, and Round Rock phases (5000-2600
B.P.). It appears that considerably fewer burned rock middens were formed during the
Late Archaic than in the earlier Archaic. The archaeological record indicates that bison
were important in the diet of prehistoric peoples, but were not necessarily the principal
food source during this time (Prewitt 1981:80-81). The Late Archaic occurred during the
San Marcos and Uvalde phases (2600-1750 B.P.). The terminal Archaic, according to the
classification by Carlson et al. (1986), includes the Twin Sisters and Driftwood phases
(1750-1250 B.P.). An increase in the importance of gathering and an apparent peak in
site density seem to have occurred during Prewittâs (1981:82) Driftwood phase. A
majority of the sites in Williamson County are Archaic in age, which, according to
Prewitt (1981:Figure 3), lasted from 8500-1250 B.P. This interpretation is supported by
Collinsâ (1995:383) assertion that âtwo-thirds of the prehistory of Central Texas is
âArchaicâ in character.â

Late Prehistoric Period

10

This period has been characterized in the archaeological literature as the NeoAmerican Stage (Suhm et al. 1954), the Neo-archaic (Prewitt 1981), and the Post-Archaic
(Johnson and Goode 1994). The Late Prehistoric is typically divided into the Austin
(1250-650 B.P.) and Toyah (650-200 B.P.) phases. Technological changes are the
primary distinguishing characteristic of this stage. The archaeological record indicates
that during this period, the bow and arrow became the principal weapon for hunting and
warfare, and that the use of ceramics and the practice of horticulture first appeared in
Central Texas and the surrounding regions.
According to Collins (1995:385), during the Late Prehistoric of Central Texas, the
bow and arrow was the first of these cultural innovations to be adopted, followed by
pottery, and finally agriculture though it was of relatively minor importance. Until the
onset of these Late Prehistoric adaptations, most cultural groups continued to practice
hunting and gathering as their principal means of subsistence, as had their ancestors
throughout the Archaic and Paleoindian periods. However, in about 800 B.P., evidence
for a different subsistence adaptation appears in the archaeological record and this
cultural time boundary marks the separation between the late Archaic and the Austin and
Toyah phases of the Late Prehistoric period (Collins 1995:385).
The most obvious changes that emerged at the beginning of the Late Prehistoric
period is the introduction of the bow and arrow and decreased use of the atlatl or spear
thrower. Otherwise, subsistence life ways in the Late Prehistoric were probably little
different from those in the earlier Archaic period (Weir 1976). A chronological model by
Dillehay (1974) of bison presence and absence periods on the southern plains suggests
that bison were present during the Toyah phase but not during the preceding Austin
phase.
Historic Period
Collins (1995:386) divides the historic period of Central Texas into three subperiods: early, middle, and late. During the first two, vestiges of both indigenous and
European peoples and cultures were present; however, in the third the indigenous peoples
had virtually disappeared. The early historic sub-period in Central Texas began in the
late 17th century with the first documented arrival of Europeans. Williamson County is
situated within the historic range of the Tonkawa Indians who inhabited the area in the
16th Century (Newcomb 1986). By the 19th Century, they had broken ties with the
Comanche and Wichita and were associated with the Lipan Apache (Aten 1983:32).
They have been described as typical southern Plains Indians who were hunters and
gathers and who lived along the streams and rivers of Central Texas. Remains of this
group have not been found in an historic context in Williamson County.
During this period, numerous aboriginal groups including the Caddo, Jumano,
Tonkawa, Comanche, and Lipan Apache (Newcomb 1986) occupied Texas. Trade is
known to have existed between the Jumanos and the Caddos. The Lipan Apaches and
subsequently the Comanches entered the region from the Plains while following key

11

animal resources as they migrated into Texas. Contact period occupations are often
identified by the occurrences of glass beads, gun parts, gunflints, metal projectile points,
and European manufactured ceramics. The archival search did not locate any Historic
Indian sites in Williamson County. In nearby Coryell County, a blue glass bead was
found with one of the burials at 41CV1, a group burial along the Leon River (Jackson
1931), and a steel arrow point has been reported as an isolated find on Horse Creek in the
extreme east corner of Coryell County (Campbell 1952).
The earliest European expedition likely to have visited present-day Williamson
County was led by Spaniard Alvar Nunez Cabeza de Vaca. They wandered throughout
Texas from 1527 to 1535. Some workers believe that the eight months spent among the
Avavares Indians relates to Tonkawas of the Williamson area (Scarbrough 1973:52).
The French governor of Texas, Robert Cavalier Sieur de la Salle, led the next
recorded European visitation. In 1686 and 1687, La Salle met Indians and described
landmarks that, according to some scholars, were of Williamson County (Hackett
1931:519-520).
In response to French activity in Texas, Captain Alonso de Leon followed
Spanish government orders by building El Camino Real (The Kingâs Highway) in 1688.
This road would be used to establish missions being planned for east Texas. It was soon
discovered that this roadway skirting just to the east of present Williamson County
became impassable when heavy rains overflowed the streams. In such wet times, De
Leon designated a route to the west and north as the Camino de Arriba (the Upper
Route). This road crossed Brushy Creek, the San Gabriel River, and the Brazos River
just north of its confluence with the Little River. In his recorded trip along this route, De
Leon left ââa bull, a cow, a stallion, and a mare at each river he crossed,â thus
significantly contributing to the mustang and longhorn population of Texasâ (Gard 1954).
Passing through the heart of Williamson County, De Leonâs trail-blazing effort represents
the first unequivocal Spanish exploration of the area immediately surrounding the project
area.
In 1691, Spanish governor of Texas Domingo Teran de los Rios brought herds of
cattle to the missions established the year before. Consisting of 50 soldiers and 13
churchmen, this entourage passed through southeastern Williamson County (Casteneda
1936 I:362, Bancroft 1884 XV:391, and Gard 1954:5).
The next expedition to pass through Williamson County occurred under the
leadership of Spanish Captain Domingo Ramon and the dashing French trader Juchereau
de Saint Denis. The Ramon-St. Denis entourage, consisting of 75 men, 64 oxen, 490
horses and mules, and more than a thousand sheep and goats, spent several weeks in
present-day Williamson and adjoining Milam Counties. They met and traded with
several thousand Native Americans of various tribes. One of its clergy, Fray Espinosa,
named several of the streams (Casteneda 1936 II:42, and 51).
The Aguayo expedition was the largest Spanish exploration effort to cross present

12

Day Williamson County. In fall of 1720, el Marques de Aguayo launched one of the
largest expeditions ever launched to establish Spanish dominion over the province of
Texas: 500 men, 600 loads of supplies, 4000 horses, 600 cattle, 900 sheep, and almost
800 mules. After traveling nearly a thousand miles, the huge delegation reached the
Colorado River. From there, it proceeded northeastward, crossing Chandler Branch and
the South and North branches of the San Gabriel River in central Williamson County
(Castaneda 1936 II:131, 137). After traveling across the Lampasas, Salado, San Andres
(now called the Little), and Brazos Rivers to the north of the County, the entourage
turned eastward near present-day Waco to reestablish the inactive Spanish missions
founded in 1691. In successfully re-planting permanent presence in Texas, this last of the
major expeditions had kept the French from capturing Texas (Bolton 1962:144, Bolton
1939:17-18, and Morfi 1935 I:221-223).
In general, the expedition followed present-day Interstate 35 through Williamson
County (Hackett 1931:474). Following the advice of a Tonkawan chief El Cuilon (also
called Juan Rodriguez), Aguayo had followed the El Camino de Arriba through
Williamson County, rather than the more heavily traveled El Camino Real which the
chief had deemed to be impassable for this huge expedition because of marshes and thick
woods (Hackett 1931:474).
The Spanish Army waged war against the Lipan Apache in the Williamson
County area for 14 years. The area became renowned for its buffalo (Morfi 1935 I:221223; Bolton 1939:17-18; Bolton 1962:27-28, 30, 141; and Hackett 1931:492). A
particularly large Indian settlement called Rancheria Grande attracted frequent Spanish
visitations during the first four decades of the eighteenth century to recruit candidates for
the San Antonio missions. In 1746, the Spanish established Mission San Francisco
Xavier de Horcasitas on the San Gabriel River just east of Williamson County to address
the spiritual needs of the Native Americans and to fend off French incursions by also
establishing a trade network with the local tribes (Bolton 1962:45, 150-151, 153-156,
160, 166, 185; Gilmore 1969:143).
Just two years later, Mission Xavier was destroyed by the Apache. However, by
the 1749, two new missions, San Ildefonso and Candelaria, opened, and Xavier was
rebuilt. All three were simultaneously utilized for the next 7 years. To add protection,
Presidio San Francisco Xavier de Gigedo was established in 1751. But fortunes turned
tragic. Infighting among the Spanish left the Native American neophytes discouraged.
Many retreated into the wilderness. In 1756, the missions were abandoned. Although
now actually in Williamson County, these three missions and presidio impacted daily life
of every Native American living for many miles around (Scarbrough 1973:63-64).
As early as the early 1820s, a few pioneers of Austinâs Colony drifted beyond its
boundaries to settle in the valleys of Brushy Creek and San Gabriel River. The main
body of Williamson County was part of the Robertson Colony. Most of the original
settlers of 1835 lighted at Salado, Bell County. Most of Williamson Countyâs earliest
residents came from Bastrop and the Webberâs Prairie area to the south and the Brazos
River to the east (Scarbrough 1973:64-70).

13

Within the State of Coahuila and Texas, the earliest regional governing precursor
to Williamson County was the Municipality of District of Viesca. This district lay
northwest of the Camino Real, extending to the east beyond the Brazos valley. Along the
Brazos, Tenoxtitlan, a Mexican military post abandoned in 1832, became a large trading
post, the closest one to the settlements of Williamson County. The seats of government
also were located on the West Bank of the Brazos, first in Sarahville de Viesca, five
miles north of Marlin, Falls county, and then Nashville, between present-day Gause and
Hearne (Scarbrough 1973:71-77).
Far removed from official security, these remote settlers suffered frequent Indian
attacks. Surveyor Thomas A. Graves was ambushed by Indians while working on the
San Gabriel River in the fall of 1835. A surveyor named Lang was killed by Indians in
1836 while working at the headwaters of Brushy Creek (Scarbrough 1973:76). Neil
McLennan, Sr. and his family suffered several dangerous encounters in the San Gabriel
Valley. These attacks stimulated the organizing of one of the three original Texas
Ranger companies in 1835. They built a cedar facility near present Leander called the
Tumlinson Block House (Barker, Eugene C., 1925:329-330; Smithwick 1900:213;
Yoakum 1856 II:265-267; Webb 1952 II:690; Brown 1896:85; De Shields 1912:90-93;
and Wilbarger 1889:190-192).
During 1835, the District was renamed the Municipality of Milam. The Mexican
Army invaded Texas to put down the Revolution. This caused the Runaway Scrape,
causing many of the Anglo-American settlers in the Williamson County area to flee.
During this time, Tumlinsonâs Block House Fort was burned by Indians. Most of this
company of Rangers had departed to assist General Sam Houston at San Jacinto. The
command of this company was placed under Major Robert M. Williamson (Bolton
1962:141).
With General Houstonâs victory at San Jacinto, the Republic of Texas began to
govern the vast territory. Milam was made a county, one of 23 original counties in the
Republic. In 1837, the United States suffered a devastating crop failure and depression.
Many of these newest immigrants settled in Milam County. Many more Swedish
immigrants settled in present-day Williamson County. The first organized settlement in
Williamson County was Kenneyâs Fort, located just east of present-day Round Rock. Dr.
Thomas Kenney built a house and fort on an elevated coveland on the south bank of
Brushy Creek, just west of where Dyer Branch flows northward into Brushy Creek.
Indian raids plagued the first settlers. In 1839, a particularly bloody conflict, the Battle
of Brushy, resulted in the death of several colonists and 20 to 30 Native Americans.
Williamson County territory was the setting for several other skirmishes occurred with
Indians (Scarbrough 1973:80-97).
Williamson County played a crucial role in two crucial incidents involving
ongoing relations between Texas and Mexico. One was the Flores-Cordova Affair, and
the other was the Santa Fe Expedition.

14

In 1839, a prolonged chase led to the Texas Rangers capturing a party of Mexican
officials between the North and South San Gabriel. Specifically, they were cornered on a
steep bluff of the North San Gabriel River, probably overlooking our project area.
Although most escaped, the Texans recovered at least 156 horses and mules, several
hundred pounds of gunpowder, and a variety of luggage. In the bags they discovered
several official communications revealing a plot to incite Indians against the government
of Texas (Scarbrough 1973:89-92).
Two years later, Texas forces met a Kenney Fort and other sites north of Austin to
head for New Mexico. The expedition met with bitter failure, as the forces were poorly
organized and New Mexico remained loyal to the government of Mexico (Scarbrough
1973:98-101).
Relations between Native Americans and settlers remained hostile, producing
deadly conflicts throughout this period. Dr. Thomas Kenney, founder of Kenny Fort, was
killed by Indians. A notable mediator who resolved numerous conflicts between Indians
and settlers was Delaware tribesman Jim Shaw (Scarbrough 1973:103-108).
The 1840s witnessed steady growth of this area. New communities arose around
mills, churches, and general stores. Makemson identifies the location of these
settlements: âAt the time the county was organized, with few exceptions, the settlements
were confined to Brushy Creek and San Gabriel River. Comparatively few settlements
were made far out in the prairies until the era of barbed wire and the advent of railroads:
(Makemson 1904). New stage lines were added. A line connecting San Antonio to
Waco was the first to run through the heart of Williamson County area. The first general
mercantile store in the county was opened by nelson Morey in 1848 just south of present
Hutto. That same year, R. H. Taliaferro organized Missionary Baptist Church, the areaâs
first Protestant church (Scarbrough 1973:108-115). Also in 1848, the countyâs first
school was built at Mossâs Spring, just west of present Round Rock (Makemson 1904).
Led by San Jacinto hero Washington Anderson, a campaign was launched in 1848
to create a new county in this area north of Travis County. It was impractical to travel all
the way to Nashville to conduct Milam County government business involving this area.
The population well exceeded the 250 estimated by various historians. The Legislature
agreed, naming the area after longtime Judge Robert McAlpin Williamson on March 13th,
1848. The Judge officiated over court many times throughout Milam County.
In May 1848, a tract of land lying between the North and South San Gabriel
Rivers, just south of their confluence was donated by George Washington Glasscock for
the count seat. In his honor, it was named âGeorgetownâ (Scarbrough 1973:113-127). It
was located near the post office of Brushy, which had been established the year before
(Scarbrough 1973:145).
Conflicts between settlers and Indians gradually declined throughout the 1850s as
more and more, the Indians were reported as being friendly (Scarbrough 1973:141). The
last Indian attack occurred as Mr. and Mrs. Wofford Johnson and their daughter were

15

killed in western Williamson County on August 15, 1863. Comanches still ranged in the
area, although attacks were rare because of the Rangers. Most of the lawmen had been
called to the Confederate cause in the Civil War (Makemson 1904:11-12; and Maltby
1906:20, 23-34, 26-27, 150-152, and 204).
By 1850, the population of Williamson County had grown to 1,568, and reached
3,779 by 1858 (Scarbrough 1973:141). In the 1860 Census, the Countyâs population was
4,529, which rose slightly during the tumultuous Civil War and Reconstruction years to
6,368 by 1870. During Post-Bellum industrialization and tenant farm transition,
population exploded to 15,155 in 1880, the highest rate of increase over a 10-year period
in the Countyâs history. By 1870, Indian violence against settlers had been halted,
encouraging much greater settlement. Population continued to increase but at a slightly
lower rate, being 25,909 in 1890, 38,072 in 1900, and 42,228 in 1910. From 1920 to
1970, population levels actually decline, but they explode in the past 25 years as
Williamson County became part of the Austin Metropolitan Area (Texas Almanac 1993:
335).
The City of Georgetown follows a similar pattern of population increase. From
1850 to 1870, it experienced modest growth from 200 to 320. From 1870 to 1880,
phenomenal growth yields 1,354, and it almost doubles to 2,447 in 1890. Increases were
slight through 1960, except for 1920 when populations slightly declined (United States
Census).
The frontier moved westward, leaving in its wake a growing population and
farming area in western central Texas. The earliest farms grew commodities necessary
for sustaining life for the pioneer settlers. Of the 249,528 acres of land comprising the
County in 1858, only 22,618 acres were in cultivation. These consisted of 11,100 acres
planted in corn, 9,350 in wheat, and 1,378 in cotton. As property of citizens, 4,000
horses and 25,000 cattle were listed (Scarbrough 1973:141). Peaches and hogs also are
listed as agricultural commodities. In the 1850 U. S. Census, three-fourths of the men
were listed as âfarmers,â and most of the othersâ occupations were listed jointly with
âfarmerâ (United States Census, 1850).
John S. Knight planted some of the first massive amounts of cotton in the County
in 1870. Many acres of eastern Williamson County became planted in cotton during the
1870s and -80s. Gins and mills involving the spin-off cottonseed industry flourished in
Circleville, Granger, Taylor, and Georgetown. In 1899-1900, Williamson County led the
state in number of bales of cotton produced. The Countyâs first gristmill was built by
Wash Anderson on the north bank of Brushy creek in 1843, at present Round Rock.
After its destruction by flood in 1845, others were maintained in the area throughout the
19th century. Other Antebellum mills were: Gannâs Mill on Berryâs Creek, from 1846 to
1916; Goochâs mills from 1849 onward; Matherâs mill from 1852; Ira Chalkâs mill in
1855; and Knightâs Springs mills of Benjamin Gooch and John W. Owens, between 1852
and 1855 (Scarbrough 1973:161-162). Throughout the Post-Bellum period to the end of
the 19th Century, numerous mills flourished throughout the County processing corn,

16

syrup, and other products. Carried out mostly in the western portions of the County, the
cattle industry reached its zenith from 1875 to 1900 (Scarbrough 1973:233-235).

PREVIOUS INVESTIGATIONS
In the sites files at TARL are numerous pieces of correspondence from
landowners and artifact collectors documenting and describing sites and artifacts found in
Williamson County. Also present are copies of unpublished manuscripts, some of which
do not provide information concerning author and date of preparation. Information
regarding previous work in other parts of Williamson County appears in the various
references cited above.
Williamson County has been the scene of numerous investigations by professional
archaeologists at various levels from small projects by private contractors, universities, and
state agencies to large area surveys such as Granger and North Fork Reservoirs, the first
large-scale projects in the county. Very little systematic work was carried out in Williamson
County prior to the initial survey of the proposed North Fork, South Fork and Laneport (now
referred to as Granger) reservoirs in 1963 (Shafer and Corbin 1965) as part of the Texas
Archeological Salvage Project (TASP). Prior to this effort, two published articles
documenting archaeological work in the county were published by T.N. Campbell (1948)
and Mardith K. Schuetz (1957).
In 1963, TASP surveyed the sites of the proposed reservoirs. At North Fork, 44 sites
were recorded, over half of which are burned rock middens or sites buried in alluvial
deposits (ceramics were only found at one site [41WM71]); at South Fork, 30 sites were
identified, almost half of which were burned rock middens; and at Laneport 10 sites were
recorded. At this reservoir, both burned rock middens and alluvial terrace sites were found,
but it was concluded that only the latter type of site could be said to be typical of the
Laneport area (Shafer and Corbin 1965:47). At approximately 10 miles north of Taylor,
Laneport Reservoir is the site of the closest major archaeological survey to the project area
except for Brushy Creek about five miles to the southeast. Additional work in the area was
conducted by Frank W. Eddy (1973) at Laneport, William S. Sorrow (Jackson 1974) at
North Fork and Prewitt (1974) at Granger.
These early studies were not conducted using intensive or systematic sampling
procedures. Therefore, in May 1976 the Anthropology Laboratory at Texas A&M
University (TAMU) began an intensive archaeological site survey and assessment program
of all government owned lands in the North Fork and Granger reservoir boundaries
(Patterson and Moore 1976). Work by TAMU consisted of a preliminary assessment
(Patterson and Moore 1976), an archeological survey of Granger (Moore, Shafer and Weed
1978) and North Fork (Patterson and Shafer 1980).
Several sites were tested prior to the inundation of Granger Reservoir. Site 41WM21
was tested by TAMU. In 1976 Gary L. Moore (1976, 1977, 1978) tested sites 41WM21,
41WM124, and 41WM133. Clell L. Bond (1978) tested 41WM30, 41WM284, and
41WM294 were tested in 1977. Site 41WM21 was determined to represent an intermittent
occupation during the Early, Middle, and Late Archaic periods of Texas prehistory.
The work at sites 41WM30, 41WM284, and 41WM294 was designed to determine
possible similarities in lithic procurement and reduction at the three sites and to explain

18

behavior patterns manifested in the archaeological deposits at 41WM130. This study
established that 41WM130 had been periodically occupied from the Twin Sisters phase
through the Toyah phase. It was determined that the subsistence pattern of the site's
inhabitants remained nearly constant through time and included the wide range exploitation
of resources found in the San Gabriel Valley. It was hypothesized that the availability of
lithic resources was one of the principal reasons this site was reused as a habitation area
through time.
The next large-scale survey near the project area was along Brushy Creek in 1974
by TAMU (Shafer 1974). Six sites (41WM273 - 41WM278) were recorded as a result of
this project. All are on the Taylor topographic quadrangle. The four prehistoric sites are
thin lithic scatters. None of the sites were recommended for additional work. A single
site (41WM283) is located about three miles northwest of the center of Taylor on the east
bank of the north fork of Mustang Creek at the former Wilson Springs community. This site
was recorded by Dan Prikryl and others in 1976 (TARL site files). It is described as an
Archaic occupation and quarry site.
At the time of this survey there were no archaeological sites recorded in the
project area. Recent surveys by Espey, Huston & Associates (Foster 1994) revisited
41WM432, 41WM546, and 41WM547. They also recorded one new site, 41WM808.
Bradle et al. (1998) surveyed along the North Fork San Gabriel River in Georgetown,
Texas and recorded 41WM432, 41WM930, 41WM931, 41WM932, and 41WM933.
Recently, Brownlow (2002) surveyed a 100-acre tract on the north side of the
South Fork San Gabriel River in the uplands for a new proposed shopping center. Site
41WM1047 was recorded as a rockshelter located above the South Fork San Gabriel
River. It was not subjected to subsurface testing since it was located in the floodplain
and would not be impacted. The survey also recorded site 41WM1048, an extensive
lithic scatter confined to the surface since the soils in that area are Eckrant by nature and
do not contain any depth on top of the bedrock. The site was not considered eligible for
inclusion on the National Register of Historic Places (NRHP) or worthy of State
Archeological Landmark (SAL) designation. Neither site will be affected by the current
project.

19

METHODS OF INVESTIGATION
The project described in this report entailed archival research and an
archaeological field investigation. The archival research consisted of a check for records
of documented sites in the online âTexas Archeological Sites Atlas,â which is maintained
by the Texas Historical Commission, as well as a review of other literature concerning
previous work in the county. The objectives of the review were to identify any
previously recorded sites in the project area and to compile information relevant to the
project from reports of previous archaeological investigations in the region.
The field investigation, an intensive survey, was conducted by personnel from
American Archaeology Group LLC (AAG) in June, 2004 and April, 2006. Michael R.
Bradle was the Principal Investigator, and Gilbert T. Bernhardt served as Project
Geoarchaeologist. Prior to the commencement of fieldwork, the project was discussed
with a representative of Kasberg Patrick & Associates LLP to ensure that the field crew
was aware of the correct location of the proposed rights-of-way, and rights-of-entry were
obtained through the City of Georgetown for access to properties along the survey routes.
The field investigation consisted of a pedestrian survey at 3-meter intervals
supported by backhoe trenching and shovel testing to identify any potential subsurface
deposits of cultural remains. Surface visibility during the pedestrian survey was
generally good (greater than 50%) and excellent along two track roads running through
the project area. Backhoe trenches were excavated along the proposed rights-of-way at
intervals of approximately 220 feet (67 meters) except along one 1,200 foot (366 meter)
section of the alternate route where rough terrain impeded access (see Figure 4). Seventy
(70) backhoe trenches were excavated along the original route and forty-nine (49) along
the alternate route (Appendix I). The trenches were oriented north-south but staggered
relative to the centerline of the proposed rights-of-way at 50 foot (15 meters) offsets.
This patterning created three rows of trenches, one row down the centerline, one 50 feet
to the left of center and one 50 feet to the right of center. All trenches were excavated
into either subsoil or bedrock. The excavation of all backhoe trenches was supervised by
AAG personnel. Following the excavation of each trench, the trench walls were
examined for cultural remains, and samples of matrix from one wall were screened
through 1/4-inch hardware cloth. The samples were extracted at vertical intervals of 10
centimeters from cuts measuring 30 x 30-centimeters. The seven shovel tests along the
1,200 foot long tract of the alternate right-of-way ranged in depth from 20 to 60 centimeters
(Appendix II). Matrix from the shovel tests was also screened through 1/4-inch hardware
cloth.
The pedestrian survey located one site, an historic farmstead (41WM1105). All
standing structures at the site were measured, photographed, and described. Five (5)
shovel tests were excavated at various locations throughout the site to identify any
potential subsurface cultural deposits (Appendix III; see also Figure 6). Matrix from the
shovel tests was screened through 1/4-inch hardware cloth.

RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS
Archival Research
A search of the literature revealed no previously documented sites within the
project area. Two sites registered with the Texas Historical Commission are located
within 1 kilometer of the study area (RCRI 2007). These sites â 41WM1018 and
41WM1019 â were documented in 2002 by PBS&J. They are located approximately 500
feet (152 meters) and 1000 feet (305 meters), respectively, to the east of the eastern tip of
the project area. Site 41WM1018 is of undetermined type and contains prehistoric and
historic components. It has been disturbed by bulldozing activity. One piece of glass
and one flake were recovered in shovel tests at depths of less than 5 centimeters below
surface. Glass and lithics (flakes and cores) were observed on the surface. The
approximate size of the site is 70 meters x 220 meters (230 x 722 feet). 41WM1019 is
described as an historic house site with a prehistoric component. It has also been
disturbed by bulldozing activity. Shovel tests at the site yielded prehistoric and historic
materials to depth of 40 centimeters below surface. Artifacts recovered in the shovel
tests and a surface collection include debitage, glass, square nails, wire nails, and
horseshoe fragments. The approximate size of 41WM1019 is 100 x 160 meters (328 x
525 feet). Neither of the two sites are State Archaeological Landmarks. No additional
research was recommended at 41WM1018. Phase II testing and archival research was
recommended at 41WM1019.
The single site documented during the survey is 41WM1105, an historic
farmstead with several standing structures including a house, garage, sheds and barns.
Archival research and information obtained from local residents indicate that the
structures date to the early twentieth century. The house appears on a 1928 edition of the
Round Rock USGS quadrangle map (1:62,500 scale), which is based on survey data from
1923-1925 (Figure 5; USGS 1928). The other structures may well have been present
prior to the map survey; sheds and barns are generally not shown on USGS quadrangles
of small scale. (Even the 1:24,000 scale 1982 USGS quadrangle map of the property,
also designated Round Rock, depicts only the house.) According to Mrs. Emory Carlson,
a local resident since 1919, the buildings on the farmstead were constructed by Wilbur
Munson sometime after 1900 but before 1925. Mrs. Carlson noted that the farmstead
was later purchased by the Gustafson family (personal communication to Michael R.
Bradle, 2007). Mrs. Carlsonâs son and daughter-in-law (Rodney and Mildred Carlson)
advised that the earliest structures in the complex, which include the barns, sheds, and
pens, were constructed in 1914 (personal communication to Michael R. Bradle 2004).
Statements by the Carlsonâs statements regarding the age of the buildings are consistent
with Williamson County deed records pertaining to the farmstead property. The records
indicate that farmstead property was granted to âC. J. Munsonâ in 1881, âJ. R. Munsonâ
in 1914, âH. Lundblad in 1919â and âC. Gustafsonâ in 1923 (Appendix IV). Assuming
that the buildings were constructed by the Munson family as indicated by Mrs. Carlson,
they likely predate the 1923 transfer of the farmstead property to C. Gustafson and the
1919 transfer of the land to H. Lundblad. Considering all the lines of evidence above, it

21

appears that the farmstead structures were constructed after 1914 and before 1923 (and
possibly before 1919).

Field Survey
All backhoe tests and shovel tests excavated during the survey were negative for
cultural remains (see Appendices I-III). The pedestrian survey identified one site,
41WM1105, the historic house and barn complex discussed above (Figure 6). This site is
located on the western portion of the originally proposed right-of-way. Only the house
and garage fall within the study area. No artifacts were recovered at the site during the
survey. A description of the site and its structures is provided in the following section.

22

Figure 6: Map showing location of site 41WM1105 and rock wall remnants (adapted
from USGS 1982a-b, 1987a-b; RCRI 2007).
The survey also located remnants of two historic rock walls at the edge of fields
along the northernmost portion of the originally proposed right-of-way (Figure 6).
Standing sections of the westernmost of the two walls are approximately 2-2.5 feet (0.610.76 meters) tall and 3 feet (0.91 meters) wide (Figure 7). The eastern wall is low and
indistinct. It is characterized by a linear rock scatter (Figure 8). The antiquity of the
walls is unknown, though similar walls in the region date to the nineteenth century.

24

Archival records and information obtained from local residents suggest that the
standing structures at 41WM1105 were constructed between 1914 and 1923, prior to the
50-year age threshold for archaeological significance. However, because the structures
are architecturally unremarkable and apparently have no significant historic associations,
American Archaeology Group LLC considers 41WM1105 ineligible for inclusion on the
National Register of Historic Places (NRHP) and unworthy of designation as a State
Archaeological Landmark (SAL). Likewise, the rock wall remnants documented during
the survey are architecturally unremarkable and lack significant historic associations.
AAG considers that these features are also ineligible for inclusion on the National
Register of Historic Places (NRHP) and unworthy of designation as a State
Archaeological Landmarks (SALs). AAG finds no basis for further documentation or
investigation of 41WM1105 or the walls, and recommends that construction within the
project area be allowed to proceed as planned. Monitoring during construction by an
archaeologist is not necessary.
Descriptions of Standing Structures at 41WM1105
Site 41WM1105, an historic farmstead, was located and documented during the
2004 phase of fieldwork for this project (Figure 9). This section provides descriptions of
standing structures at the site and assessments of their integrity, historic affiliation, and
significance. Because the architecture of the structures is based in the English system of
measurement, only English dimensional units are used in the descriptions. All
dimensions cited are approximate.
The structures documented by AAG include a house and garage (Structures 1 and
2) as well as several barns and sheds (Structures 3A-5C). The house is built in the
âAmerican foursquareâ architectural style. American foursquare houses, whose
characteristics include a cube-like shapes and hipped roofs, were popular between 1900
and 1940 (Sennott 2004:43-44). The house and garage were sealed and secured at the
time of the survey and were not entered. From the exterior, they appeared to be of basic
wood frame construction using standard Western framing and lumber, composition
roofing, and cement and asbestos aggregate siding. Galvanized embossed metal sheeting
was used to skirt the foundation of the house. Asbestos siding similar to that used on the
house and garage was manufactured from about 1955 to 1960 (Hope 2004). All
components of the residential complex exhibited good structural and functional integrity
and were apparently in use until just prior to survey.
The barns and sheds are of wood construction and appear to have been stick-built
on site using standard Western framing with 2â x 4â and 2âx 6â lumber. Exterior siding
is wood and roofs are corrugated tin. All contain only dimensional lumber and round
wire nails. When observed by AAG, all of the agrarian buildings were unsecured and
empty and all of them exhibited basic structural and functional integrity, and were
located outside of the project area.

Figure 9: Plan drawing of standing structures at site 41WM1105.
Structure 1
Structure 1 is a rectangular, single family, one-story, wood frame dwelling with a
hip-style roof (about 8/12 pitch) with composition shingles, asbestos and cement siding,
and foundation skirting of embossed galvanized metal panels. The plan dimensions of
the house, not including its extending porch and steps, are approximately 45â11â x
36â11â. The front of the house faces west, where wooden steps with railing lead to the
front entry (Figure 10). A bay window extends several feet outward from the north
exterior wall, and a closed porch or landing with steps, railing, and a shed-style roof
extends outward from the exterior east wall at the rear of the house (Figure 11).

26

Figure 10: Structure 1 from the west (left) and southeast.

Figure 11: Structure 1 from the northwest, showing bay window, (left) and southwest.
The closed porch connects to concrete flatwork consisting of a small patio and
walkway extending from the patio to a small concrete porch at the front of the garage
building. Another branch of this walkway extends southward along the west side of the
garage to a small concrete pad in front of the entry on that side. A utility pole is located
about 30 feet north of the northeast corner of the house, just south of the main gravel
access road that extends through this portion of the project area. The asbestos siding on
the house is a yellowish cream color, the trim on the house and around the windows is
white with beet red-colored screen trim, the metal foundation skirting is gray, and the
composition roofing is a light reddish-gray color.
Structure 2
Structure 2, a garage, lies to the east of the house (Figure 12). Its construction
and exterior colors generally match those of the house, but the garage lacks foundation

27

skirting and has a gabled roof with approximately 8/12 pitch. A single bay door is
located along the west half of the north exterior wall, and a small entry door is located
just east of the center of that wall. Another small entry door is located toward the south
end of the west wall. The entries at both of the smaller doors are covered with
rectangular, shed-style, wood-framed canopies with composition roofing matching that
on the rest of the garage and on the house.

Figure 12: Structure 2 from the north (left) and northeast (structure 1 at far right).
The plan dimensions of the garage are 28â4â x 24â4â. A modern, cased water
well with electric pump and metal tank is located near a utility pole about halfway
between the northeast corner of the garage and the main gravel road that extends east-towest through this portion of the project area. A gravel driveway extends from the road
southward to a gravel parking area between the garage and the house. When the site was
investigated during the survey, large portions of the driveway and parking area were
heavily overgrown with grasses and weeds, making accurate mapping of these elements
impractical.
Structures 3A and 3B
Structures 3A and 3B are two small storage buildings on the north side of the
main road across from the house and garage (Figure 13). The westernmost of the two
storage buildings, Structure 3A, is nearly square, with plan dimensions of 10â8â x 12â. It
is of wood frame construction, has ship-lap wooden siding, a shed-style metal roof, two
small windows along the south exterior wall, and a small wood door at the west end of
that wall.

28

Figure 13: Structures 3A (foreground) and 3B from the southwest.
The second of these storage buildings, Structure 3B, is adjacent to the first
(Figure 14). A gap of about two feet separates the two buildings. The plan dimensions
of Structure 3B are 28â7â x 12â. This building has two components. One component, on
the east end, has a low pitched, gabled metal roof, and the second has a shed-style metal
roof. Both components of Structure 3B are wood framed with vertical plank wood
siding. The component with the gabled roof has a small wood door in the center of the
north exterior wall, and the other component has four side-hinged, wood plank doors
along the exterior south wall.
At the time of AAGâs investigation, Structure 3A was missing its two front
windows, and part of its roof had collapsed. Structure 3B was closed. AAG staff entered
neither of the structures and, thus, interior finishes of the buildings were not determined.
The exterior surfaces of the shiplap siding of Structure 3A are painted white, and the
paint shows little deterioration. The exterior siding of Structure 3B was once painted
white, but most of the paint had worn off.

29

Figure 14: Structures 3B (foreground) and 3A from the southeast.
Structures 4A, 4B, and 4C
These three structures consist of a one-story barn with two attached sheds. All
are wood frame with galvanized metal roofs, and have earthen or graveled floors.
Structure 4A, a barn, has a metal-panel, gabled roof (about 8/12 pitch) and was obviously
built first (Figure 15). Its plan dimensions are 32â4â x 17â7â. The approximate height at
the apex of the barn roof is 12 feet. On its west side the barn has three large bays, each
of which has double, side-hinged wood doors at the entrances to separate animal stalls.
The barn was once painted red, but most of the paint was worn off, and wood surfaces
were exposed at the time of AAGâs investigation.

Figure 15: Structure 4A from the southwest. Structure 4C, an attached shed, is visible at
far left.
The plan dimensions of Structure 4B, a shed attached to the east side of the barn,
are 29â4â x 18â (Figure 16). The shed is of wood-frame construction with corrugated

30

galvanized tin sheeting on the roof and on the north and south sides. The shed has no
siding on its east face and was probably added to the barn for small implement or hay
storage. It has a low, single-slant roof.

Figure 16: Structures 4B (foreground) and 4A from the southeast.
Structure 4C is an enclosed shed attached at the north side of the barn (see Figure
15). It is the same width as the barn, is approximately 10 feet in length. The shed has
wood framing and siding and a metal, single-slant roof. The large entry door of the shed
opens on to the same side as the three bay doors of the barn. The shed was obviously
added well after construction of the barn, probably as an additional animal stall.
Structures 5A, 5B, and 5C
These three structures comprise a large, tall barn and two attached open sheds.
All are wood frame and have galvanized metal roofs and earthen or graveled floors. All
have vertical plank wooden siding except for the Structure 5C shed, which has corrugated
sheet metal siding. The exteriors of the wood-sided structures had been painted red in the
past, but at the time of the AAG investigation, most of the paint had deteriorated.
The plan dimensions of the original rectangular Structure 5A, a barn, are about
32â9â x 30â (Figure 17). The barn roof is gabled, with about 7/12 pitch, and the
approximate height at the apex of the gabled ends is 18 feet. A large portion of the roof
is missing near the southwest corner of the original barn. The front of the barn faces
west, and two small entry doors are located along the west exterior wall.
Structure 5B, a shed, extends along the entire south side of Structure 5A, a barn,
and is about 11â8â from front to rear (Figure 17). Large metal hinges attached at the
sides of a bay opening on the west end of the shed indicate that the opening once had two
vertical wood plank doors. A door plank is still attached to one of the hinges. Except for
an opening strip along its entire length midway from top to bottom, the south side of the
shed is enclosed. The opening is about 30 inches in height. The frame of the south wall

31

of the shed includes several vertical cedar posts, indicating that the shed was probably a
secondary or later addition to the original barn, which contained no cedar posts.
Although its exact purpose was not determined, this shed would have been suitable for
sheltering or storing small tractors and other relatively small farm equipment.

Figure 17: Structures 5B (foreground) and 5A from the southwest.
The plan dimensions Structure 5C, a shed extending lengthwise from the east wall
of the Structure 5A, a barn, are 40â6â x 22â10â. The shedâs gabled roof has about 5/12
pitch, and the height of the apexes on the gabled ends is about eight feet. The south wall
of the shed is open and faces an adjoining hog pen. The shed contains upright cedar post
roof supports and other cedar framing. Thus, it was probably a secondary or tertiary
addition to Structure 5A, which apparently contained no cedar posts. Since the shed
adjoins what was likely a hog pen, the shed was probably used primarily for sheltering
hogs or perhaps other farm animals.
The hog pen fence south of the Structure 5C shed averages about four feet in
height and is constructed of a hodge-podge of cedar posts, horizontal 1â x 6â wooden
slats, and hog wire. It encloses a rectangular open yard area the length of Structure 5C
and is about 45 feet wide.
Structure 6
Structure 6, a small ramshackle wooden chicken coop, is located inside the fence
near the southeast corner of the hog pen. It was apparently constructed of scrap lumber
and other materials and has a corrugated galvanized tin roof. Its plan dimensions are 12â
x 7â, and it is about six feet tall at the peak of its low-pitched gabled roof.

RECOMMENDATIONS
A survey of two proposed rights-of-way for an extension of the Southeast Inner
Loop in Williamson County, Texas performed for the City of Georgetown on behalf of
Kasberg Patrick & Associates LLP identified one historic farmstead (41WM1105). The
site was determined not to be eligible for inclusion on the National Register of Historic
Places (NRHP) or worthy of designation as a State Archaeological Landmark (SAL).
Therefore, American Archaeology Group LLC recommends that construction within the
project area be allowed to proceed as planned, and monitoring during construction by an
archaeologist is not necessary. It is always possible that buried cultural materials can be
missed during any Phase I survey. Therefore, should any sites be located during the
construction of the pipeline, all work within the site should cease until the situation can
be evaluated by the Archeology Division of the Texas Historical Commission in
consultation with American Archaeology Group LLC, the City of Georgetown, and
Kasberg Patrick & Associates LLP.
