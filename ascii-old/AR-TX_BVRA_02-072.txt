INTRODUCTION
A Phase I archaeological survey of approximately 6400 linear feet of rerouted
force main in west-central Polk County, Texas (Figure 1) was conducted on October 28
and 29, 1999 by Brazos Valley Research Associates under antiquities permit 2266
issued by the Division of Archeology, Texas Historical Commission. The field crew
consisted of William E. Moore (Principal Investigator), James E. Warren (Project
Archaeologist) and two Field Assistants (Bobby Jemison and Art Romine).
Prior to entering the field, a records check was made at the Texas Archeological
Research Laboratory (TARL) in order to identify all previously recorded sites, if any, in
the project area and vicinity. No sites were found to be present within the project area.
However, several significant prehistoric sites have been reported in the vicinity along
Kickapoo Creek (now under Lake Livingston) and its tributaries to the south. Based on
this records check and personal experience in the area by the Principal Investigator it
appeared that there was a chance for the occurrence of archaeological sites in the
project area.
The project area is depicted on the topographic quadrangle Onalaska, Texas
(3095-441) dated 1961 and photorevised 1972 (Figure 2). It follows the highway rightof-way on the east side of Old Groveton Road for a distance of 4400 feet from north to
south. Then it crosses Highway 190 and crosses private land for a distance of 2000
feet until it connects with the existing wastewater treatment plant (Figure 3).

FIELD METHODS
The Phase I survey was conducted utilizing the pedestrian survey method
supported by shovel testing and probing. During the field survey, the entire project area
was examined for surface and subsurface evidence of archaeological sites with
emphasis on those areas believed to be high probability for site occurrence. Virtually all
of the project area was obscured by ground cover; therefore, few exposed surfaces
were observed. Limited shovel probing was also conducted to find out the depth of clay
in the various areas.
All earth excavated during shovel testing was screened through 1/4 inch
hardware cloth. In all, 26 shovel tests were dug throughout the project area (Appendix
I). Each shovel test was 30 x 50 cm in size and was dug in arbitrary 10 cm levels. Of
this number, 16 were dug along Old Groveton Road, and 10 were dug south of Highway
190 (Figure 3). Selected shovel tests were profiled (Appendix II). Along Old Groveton
Road shovel tests were dug in the least disturbed areas. It should be noted that this
route was very disturbed due to buried sewer lines and a telephone cable. According to
the surveyors working for KSA Engineers, Inc. on this project, a buried water line was
also present. There was a built-up, paved area on both sides of Highway 190, and no
shovel tests were dug in this location (Figure 3). The existing wastewater treatment
plant was found to be in the floodplain of the creek that contained no water (only muddy
areas due to seepage). No shovel tests were dug in this low probability area. There
was a steep 30 foot bank overlooking the creek that was examined for in situ cultural
materials. A backhoe was not considered necessary due to the overall shallow soils
and negative results of all 26 shovel tests. In addition to the topographic quadrangle
and engineering map, the soils book for Polk and San Jacinto counties was consulted
during the survey (McEwen, et al. 1988). The project area map (Figure 3) was taken
from a blowup of the topographic map prepared by KSA Engineers, Inc. dated October
1999.

ARCHAEOLOGICAL BACKGROUND
The project area is located in a county that contains significant archaeological
sites, both prehistoric and historic. A file search conducted by the Texas Archeological
Research Laboratory (TARL) in Austin, Texas revealed no previously recorded sites in
the project area. Several sites have been reported south of the area along Lake
Livingston. No sites in the vicinity are listed in the National Register of Historic Places
1993 update or as State Archeological Landmarks. There is, however, a State
Archeological Landmark referred to the Lake Livingston Recreation Area to the south of
the current project area, but it appears that only one site (41PK21) may be included.
According to a planning document prepared by the Department of Antiquities
Protection (now Division of Antiquities Protection), the project area is located in the
Southeast Texas Archeological Study Region of the Eastern Planning Region
(Kenmotsu and Perttula 1993:Figure 1.1.2). At the time this document was prepared
Polk County contained 0.001 to 0.1 sites per square mile. This is the lowest recorded
site density of any county in Texas except for two counties with no recorded sites.
The three archeological regions in the Eastern Planning Region exhibit greater
internal environmental homogeneity than does the planning region as a whole and is
characterized by considerable cultural diversity, both through time and space
(Kenmotsu and Perttula 1993:13). Early cultures in the region exhibit a greater degree
of similarity in lifeways than was the case for later cultures. These early groups were
probably hunters and gatherers utilizing site areas for brief periods based on the
widespread distribution of point styles, the frequent occurrence of exotic raw materials,
and the meagerness of occupational debris found at excavated campsites (Kenmotsu
and Perttula 1993:13-14). Through time, group territories appear to have been reduced,
perhaps due to increased population. As territoriality of groups increased, greater
internal diversity is evidenced in the archeological record of the region (Kenmotsu and
Perttula 1993:14). The diversity in the archeological record becomes quite pronounced
by the Late Prehistoric period, enabling researchers to distinguish the Late Prehistoric
from earlier periods.
The discussion above was taken largely from the planning document by the
Department of Antiquities Protection. Interested researchers are encouraged to consult
this comprehensive document for additional background information regarding the
archaeology of Polk County and Southeast Texas.
Much of our current knowledge of the prehistory and history of Polk County has
resulted from cultural resource studies, primarily involving Lake Livingston. The first
major project to involve the reservoir area was the initial survey (Nunley 1963), testing
(McClurkan 1967), and mitigation (McClurkan 1968) of the proposed lake area by the
Texas Archeological Salvage Project (TASP) in the 1960s. Since that time a number of
small projects have been conducted. Typically, these are small area surveys by private
contractors working with the Corps of Engineers (COE) or in-house projects by COE
staff. Since the TASP investigations in the 1960s, only one major excavation project
has been conducted in the county.

The Crawford site (41PK69) was excavated by the Archeological Research
Laboratory, Texas A&M University, under the direction of H. Blaine Ensor and David L.
Carlson (1988) in 1984-1985. Their work provided evidence that deeply stratified
upland sites exist within the region. The Crawford site was determined to have been
inhabited during much of the Holocene as Early, Middle, and Late Archaic occupations,
as well as Early and Late Ceramic Period components, were defined. The data suggest
that the latest deposits are Caddo related, and some occupational debris may be
attributed to the historic Bidai (Ensor and Carlson 1988:iii). The interested researcher is
advised to consult the above-mentioned sources for previous work in Polk County.
In 1998, Brazos Valley Research Associates conducted a Phase I archaeological
survey of a wastewater system improvement project for the Polk County Fresh Water
Supply District Number 2 approximately 3.5 km northwest of the current project area
(Moore 1998). One multi-component site (41PK122) was located.

RESULTS AND RECOMMENDATIONS
A 100% pedestrian survey of the project area (6440 feet) did not locate any
archaeological sites. The segment along Old Groveton Road (4400 feet) was in a very
disturbed area due to a buried sewer line, telephone cable, and water line. Much of this
segment was in a ditch that was created when the highway was constructed. This was
obvious when the natural contour of the landforms paralleling the highway were
compared to the road. Shovel tests in the undisturbed areas along the highway
revealed a hard clay above the roadbed. The center of the project area was built up
and paved; it is in this area that Highway 190 crosses the project area alignment and
several parking lots and businesses are located. The area south of Highway 190
contained fairly shallow soils (average depth 40-50 cm) on a landform that sloped
gradually to the creek to the south. It appears, after the fact, that the project area
crossed the landform in an area that was on the slope rather than at the top. The
highest probability areas for an archaeological site are believed to be east (near shovel
tests 18-21) and west (shovel tests 24-26) of the current alignment.
It is recommended that the client be allowed to proceed with construction as
planned. It is always possible that cultural resources are missed during any
archaeological survey. Should, however, evidence of a site be encountered during
construction all work should cease until a decision can be made by the Division of
Archeology, Texas Historical Commission in consultation with the Polk County Fresh
Water District Number 2 and Brazos Valley Research Associates.
