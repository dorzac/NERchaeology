ABSTRACT
On September 10–14, 2018, two archeologists with Prewitt and Associates, Inc., conducted
a reconnaissance survey of the proposed MISAE Solar Park II project area in Childress County,
Texas, for ESE Partners, LLC. The project area encompasses 2,800 acres in 20 partly contiguous
parcels of privately owned property and a few connecting road corridors in the southeast corner
of the county, approximately 19 km east of the City of Childress and south of U.S. Highway
287. The survey was undertaken as part of a due-diligence process to assess the likelihood that
the project area could contain important archeological sites. Two prehistoric sites, 41CI146
and 41CI147, were recorded, along with five isolated prehistoric artifacts, three mid- to latetwentieth century houses (two ruinous), and three twentieth-century artifact scatters. None of
these remains meet eligibility criteria for listing in the National Register of Historic Places or
designation as State Antiquities Landmarks. Hence, they should require no further consideration
before the project proceeds. Further, the results of this survey indicate that portions of the project
area that were not examined during the fieldwork have a very low likelihood of containing
other archeological remains that could be considered eligible. Hence, it is recommended that
no additional archeological investigations are warranted.

INTRODUCTION
On September 10–14, 2018, two archeologists with Prewitt and Associates,
Inc., conducted a reconnaissance survey of the proposed MISAE Solar Park II
project area in Childress County, Texas, for ESE Partners, LLC. The project area
encompasses 2,800 acres in 20 partly contiguous parcels of privately owned
property and a few connecting road corridors in the southeast corner of the county,
approximately 19 km east of the City of Childress and south of U.S. Highway 287
(Figure 1). The area is in low-relief uplands, the surface of which has been extensively
modified by plowing and agricultural terracing. These uplands form the divide
between South Groesbeck Creek, which flows east though the southernmost extent
of the project area and drains most of the parcels, and North Groesbeck Creek, the
headwaters of which drain some of the northernmost parcels. Both drainages flow
east-northeast and eventually merge to form Groesbeck Creek, which joins the Red
River in Hardeman County.
The survey was undertaken as part of a due-diligence process to assess
the likelihood that the project area could contain important archeological sites.
The assessment was based on the results of three tasks. First, a file search was
undertaken to determine if known cultural resources are present within or near
the project area. The sources consulted include the Texas Historical Commission’s
Archeological Sites Atlas and Historic Sites Atlas; geologic, soils, and topographic
maps; and historic aerial photographs.
The second task involved fieldwork. Two archeologists visually inspected all
parcels from the county roads and private roads that crisscross the project area.
Based on this initial inspection and the topography of each parcel, as shown on the
USGS Kirkland South quadrangle, particular parcels or sections of parcels deemed to
have some potential for archeological sites were subjected to a walkover inspection.
Walkover inspection was nonsystematic and done at wide intervals. Information
collected is contained in a daily journal of activities kept by the archeologists,
archeological site forms, digital photographs and accompanying log, GPS mapping
data, and annotated parcel maps.
The third task involved analysis of the information gathered to present the
results and recommendations of the survey. This report is the result of that effort.
ENVIRONMENTAL SETTING
The MISAE Solar Park II project area location is in low-relief uplands
underlain by the Permian Blaine Formation, which consists of interbedded shale,
siltstone, sandstone, gypsum, and dolomite. The shale can be calcareous near the top
and show various shades of red and gray. The siltstone and sandstone are orange to
red. Gypsum karst is mapped within the project area along South Groesbeck Creek
(Bureau of Economic Geology 1992), and one sinkhole is marked in the project area
on the Childress County soils map (Web Soil Survey 2018). This sinkhole, which is
in the northwest corner of Parcel 5, was not confirmed in the field. Rock outcrops
are also marked on the soils map. The outcrops in the project area are in the eastern
and southernmost parcels (Nos. 10, 12, 13, 14, 15, and 17). They were considered to

have a high potential for prehistoric sites. Several were field inspected, and several
others were looked for but not found, suggesting that they may have been buried by
agricultural terracing. Those that were found in Parcels 10, 15, and 17 are composed
of shale or sandstone with calcareous material or caliche on top. Such outcrops
could have provided lithic resources to prehistoric inhabitants as well as overlooks
of the surrounding area (Figure 2). Caliche fragments along with quartzite gravels
also appear in patches in many of the terraced fields within the project area. The
quartzite fragments are likely lag gravels associated with the Ogallala Formation
(Hurst et al. 2010). Some of these gravels are large enough to be used for lithic tool
production.

north toward North Groesbeck Creek headwater drainages.

The Childress County climate is classified as subhumid with warm dry
summers and mild dry winters (Blakley and Mohle 1963:69). Temperatures can
exceed 100°F for several consecutive days within the summer and dip below 32°F for
a few days in the winter. Historically, the mean annual precipitation for Childress
County is 23.3 inches with a range of 11.3 to 50.0 inches (Blakley and Mohle 1963:69).
In the spring and summer months, this precipitation is uneven across the county, as
it occurs in heavy downpours with scattered thunderstorms. More-widespread rains
occur in fall and winter months, but long periods of drought can occur any time of

4

the year. As such, South Groesbeck Creek and its tributaries, which drain most of
the project area, and the headwaters of North Groesbeck Creek, which drain the
northernmost parcels, are mapped as intermittent streams that carry water only
during wet periods.
Childress County is within the Rolling Plains physiographic zone of Texas,
which has temperate grasslands with original vegetation including tall and short
grasses such as little bluestem, big bluestem, Indian grass, switch grass, hairy
gama, blue gama, Canada wild-rye, and western wheatgrass (Correll and Johnson
1979:10–11). Parts of the Rolling Plains underlain by Permian deposits, including
Childress County, are also called the Permian red plains. The red plains include open
mesquite savannas and fauna that is a mixture of eastern forest species and western
grassland species (Blair 1950:110). Presently, various grasses and mesquite, oak,
salt cedar, juniper, and hackberry trees, which form cover for wildlife, are confined
to corridors along stream channels and the edges of agricultural fields within the
project area (Figure 3).

RESULTS OF FILE SEARCH
Review of the Texas Historical Commission’s Archeological Sites Atlas
on September 4, 2018, revealed no previously recorded prehistoric or historic
archeological sites and no previous archeological investigations within the
MISAE Solar Park II project area. The closest recorded sites are 2–4 km west and
southwest of the project area. These sites (41CI135, 41CI136, and 41CT34) were
recorded in 2011 and 2012 as a result of surveys along utility corridors. Of these,
only 41CI136 is in the South Groesbeck Creek drainage. The other two sites are
in drainages that flow south to the North Pease River. The same utility surveys
encountered and recorded a cluster of seven prehistoric sites (41CI12, 41CI134,
41CI138, 41CI139, 41CI143, 41CI144, and 41CI145) approximately 10 km farther
west. These sites are also within drainages that flow south to the North Pease
River. All of these sites were recorded as prehistoric but of unknown time period.
They were found on heights near streams and were recorded as surface scatters
of lithic flakes and tools. Lithic materials present were identified as Potter chert,
jasper, petrified wood, and Tecovas and Alibates chert. No temporally diagnostic
artifacts were found on any of these sites. Several (41CI134, 41CI139, 41CI143,
and 41CI144) had burned rock features, which are likely the remains of hearths
or cooking features. None of these sites were found to be eligible for listing in the
National Register of Historic Places, and no further work was recommended. These
sites indicate prehistoric utilization of upland drainages for resource procurement
with small short-term camps. This kind of activity can be attributed to many
different groups who crossed the Rolling Plains during some 12,000 years of Texas
prehistory (Perttula 2004:5–9).
A review of the Texas Historical Commission’s Historic Sites Atlas on
September 4, 2018, showed no National Register properties or Texas Historic
Markers in or within 1 km of the project area. The closest designated property is
the cemetery in the town of Kirkland. The cemetery has some 735 graves dating
from 1908 to 2010. Kirkland is just north of the project area at the intersection
of County Road 1033 and U.S. Highway 287. It was moved to this location from
Hardeman County in 1887 to take advantage of the construction of the Fort Worth
to Denver City rail line (Anderson 2018). Kirkland flourished at this location,
as did all of Childress County, in the early part of the twentieth century as the
farming and ranching economy based on cotton, poultry, and cattle was expanding
(Abbe 2018). Hard years in the 1930s resulted in a gradual decline in population
that culminated in the 1950s–1960s with the introduction of modern farming
techniques (Abbe 2018).
A 1954 aerial photograph of the project area shows eight buildings or clusters
of buildings in the project area that appear to be farm complexes. The 1967 USGS
Kirkland South quadrangle (revised in 1981) shows structures at six of these,
although most apparently were no longer occupied by then. These locations have
the potential for historic-age archeological remains and buildings and structures.
All of these were checked in the field to determine their present condition.

WORK ACCOMPLISHED
All 20 parcels within the MISAE Solar Park II project area received some
level of inspection, whether it was simply noting the vegetation and topographic
conditions, investigation of a possible historic building location, or walkover
reconnaissance of a high-probability area for prehistoric sites. Parcels or sections
of parcels with heights overlooking South Groesbeck Creek or one of its tributaries
were considered to have the highest potential for prehistoric sites. Also, parcels
with rock outcrops as noted on the Childress County soils map were deemed to have
some potential for prehistoric sites, as these could have provided access to lithic
resources. High-probability areas within parcels that also had good ground surface
visibility (50–100 percent) were subjected to a walkover inspection. The parcels
were numbered for ease of reference following a project area map provided by ESE
Partners, LLC (Figure 4). Sections of 10 parcels were inspected by walkover survey:
Parcel 3, southeast corner; Parcel 5, southwest corner; Parcel 8, southeast side; Parcel
10, east half; Parcel 12, south half; Parcel 14, west-central and east edges; Parcel
15, east half; Parcel 16, southwest corner; Parcel 17, south edge; and Parcel 19, east
edge. In addition, the eight historic-age farm complex locations on the 1954 aerial
photograph were inspected. Ruinous houses dating to the mid-twentieth century
were found at two on Parcels 4 and 20; historic artifact scatters were found at three
on Parcels 8, 14, and 18; and no remains were found at three on Parcels 6, 8, and
11 (not shown on Figure 4).
SURVEY RESULTS
The survey identified two previously unknown prehistoric sites (41CI146
and 41CI147), five isolated prehistoric artifacts, two ruinous mid-twentieth-century
houses, one still-occupied later-twentieth-century house, and three historic artifact
scatters; only the two prehistoric sites were given state trinomials. Sites 41CI146 and
41CI147 are both in Parcel 10 (see Figure 4). The five isolated prehistoric artifacts
are in Parcels 5, 10, 14, and 16. The three houses are in Parcels 4, 9, and 20. The
historic artifact scatters are in Parcels 8, 14, and 18.
Site 41CI146 is on an upland projection that overlooks the main channel
of South Groesbeck Creek in the east-central part of Parcel 10. The site is a sparse
lithic scatter across an area approximately 100 m in diameter that extends into the
plowed field and the eroded creek edge (Figure 5). A total of five flakes, one core,
one unifacial tool, and possible burned rocks were observed on the surface. The
burned rocks consist of small gray pieces of caliche scattered in the plowed field.
The burned rocks may be remnants of hearth features destroyed by plowing. Flaked
material types include Alibates chert, petrified wood, and quartzite, all of which
are characteristic of Ogallala gravels. No time-diagnostic artifacts were found. The
potential for substantial buried deposits is very low, given the topographic setting.

Figure 5. Site 41CI146, view to the south along the landform edge overlooking the drop-off to
South Groesbeck Creek.

Site 41CI147 is on a grass- and mesquite-covered sandstone and caliche
outcrop in the north-central part of Parcel 10. The site is adjacent to and south of
County Road DD and extends into the plowed field south of the outcrop (Figure 6).
The site dimensions are 400 m east-west by 200 m north-south. The site and the
outcrop are approximately 250 m north of the main channel of South Groesbeck
Creek and 750 m northwest of 41CI146. Like its nearby neighbor, 41CI147 is a
sparse lithic artifact scatter consisting of seven flakes and one core along with some
possible burned rocks scattered along the south edge of the outcrop. Flaked material
types include Edwards chert, petrified wood, and quartzite. No time-diagnostic
artifacts were found. The potential for substantial buried deposits is very low, given
the topographic setting. A historic artifact scatter is present on the north edge of
41CI147 close to County Road DD. Artifacts observed include whiteware, glass,
screw-top glass bottles, cans, a metal toy, and a metal belt buckle. A section of metal
culvert is also present; it is upturned and may have functioned as a water trough
or cattle feeder. Because no structural remains were observed and no structure
appears at this location on the 1954 aerial photograph of the project area or the
1967/1981 USGS quadrangle, it is likely that the materials observed represent a
late-twentieth-century trash dump.

Figure 6. Site 41CI147, view to the northeast of the south side of the grass- and mesquite-covered
rock outcrop.

The five isolated prehistoric artifacts found in Parcels 5, 10, 14, and 16 were
along South Groesbeck Creek or in uplands close to mapped rock outcrops (see
Figure 4). Single chert or quartzite flakes were found at two locations in Parcel 10
on the south side of South Groesbeck Creek. A tested quartzite cobble was found in
Parcel 5 on an upper reach of the creek. A single possibly utilized quartzite flake was
found in Parcel 14, and a quartzite flake core was found in Parcel 16. The latter two
were near rock outcrops shown on the county soils map but not found in the field
during this survey. The outcrops may have been covered by agricultural terracing.
The two newly recorded archeological sites and the five isolated artifacts
indicate that Native Americans used South Groesbeck Creek and the surrounding
uplands probably for seasonal resource procurement forays, with small short-term
camps located near the creek. Given the sparseness of artifacts, this use was of low
intensity and frequency.
The two ruinous historic-age houses are in Parcels 4 and 20 (see Figure 4). The one in
Parcel 4 is a partially collapsed single-story house of concrete and brick construction
(Figure 7). The house apparently faced east as evidenced by a collapsed wooden porch
on that side and the presence of a road there connecting it to County Road BB. The

10

one in Parcel 20 is a collapsed house of wooden construction with a peaked roof that
was at least partially covered with cedar shingles (Figure 8). It likely faced west to
County Road 1033; it has a below-ground storm shelter near its southeast corner
and a large circular concrete pad on its east side that may have been the base of an
above-ground cistern. Both of these houses appear on the 1954 aerial photograph
of the project area and the 1967/1981 USGS Kirkland South quadrangle, indicating
that they date at least as early as the middle of the twentieth century.

Figure 7. Ruinous historic-age house in Parcel 4, view to the west.

Figure 8. Ruinous historic-age house in Parcel 20, view to the southwest.

The house on Parcel 9 is a brick ranch-style house that is presently occupied. It
faces west to County Road 1033. This house is on the updated 1967/1981 USGS
Kirkland South quadrangle but not the 1954 aerial photograph. It apparently was
built after 1967 and before 1981.
The three historic artifact scatters are at locations where buildings shown
on the 1954 aerial photograph have been removed. These scatters are in Parcels 8,
14, and 18. The scatters generally include whiteware sherds, an occasional piece of
transfer-ware ceramics, bottle glass, wire nails, and unidentified metal fragments.
These artifacts are consistent with the conclusion that the buildings at these
locations dated to the mid-twentieth century or before.
RECOMMENDATIONS
A reconnaissance survey was conducted within the project area of the MISAE
Solar Park II in Childress County, Texas, in September 2018. The survey was done
for ESE Partners, LLC, as part of a due-diligence process to assess the likelihood
that the project area could contain important archeological sites. The two prehistoric
archeological sites (41CI146 and 41CI147) and five isolated prehistoric artifacts
recorded by this survey suggest that Native Americans used South Groesbeck
Creek and its surrounding uplands for low-intensity seasonal resource procurement,
with small short-term camps located near the creek. None of these remains have
significant research value, however, because artifact densities are very low, intact
features and temporally diagnostic artifacts are absent, they are restricted to the
surface or at most shallowly buried, and they have been disturbed by extensive
plowing and agricultural terracing as well as erosion. No further work on them is
recommended.
The two ruinous historic-age twentieth-century houses, one later stilloccupied house, and three historic artifact scatters found during the survey reflect
a dispersed twentieth-century farming community associated with the town of
Kirkland on U.S. Highway 287 just north of the project area. Most of the buildings
and structures originally at these locations have been removed, and the locations
have been returned to agricultural production. The remnants documented are not
old enough or intact enough to have any significant research value.
None of the prehistoric or historic remains found during this survey exhibit
qualities that would make them eligible for listing in the National Register of
Historic Places under Criteria A–D or eligible for designation as State Antiquities
Landmarks. Hence, they should require no further consideration before the project
proceeds. Further, the results of this survey indicate that portions of the project
area that were not examined during the fieldwork have a very low likelihood of
containing other archeological remains that could be considered eligible. Hence,
it is recommended that no additional archeological investigations are warranted.
