ABSTRACT
The Somervell County Water District is proposing to construct forty miles
of water pipeline in the central part of the county primarily along roads
that surround Glen Rose, the county seat. An archaeological investigation
of the twelve pipeline routes resulted in the recording of an extensive
prehistoric site that is located on terrace deposits of the Turner Bend of the
Brazos River. A second prehistoric site was located buried in terrace
sediments of the Paluxy River, and may be Archaic in age. Both sites may
be eligible for inclusion on the National Register of Historic Places
(NRHP). In addition, two early twentieth century house sites, with intact
storm cellars, were recorded during the survey. However, based on their
age and the absence of residences they are not considered eligible for
nomination to the NHRP. The prehistoric site and the two historic sites
will be avoided by the proposed pipeline route. A unique gas
station/speakeasy that was constructed in the late 1920s is also described
in the report but was not recorded as an archaeological site, as it is not
within the proposed pipeline corridor. AR Consultants, Inc. recommends
that further cultural resource investigations are unwarranted in conjunction
with the planned expansion of the Somervell County Water District
pipeline system as long as prehistoric site 41SV172 is avoided by the
construction of a mud pit that is about five feet deep and ten by thirteen
feet in width and length. If unknown cultural resources are encountered
during construction, the Texas Historical Commission should be
immediately notified.

INTRODUCTION

The Somervell County Water District (SCWD) is proposing to construct Phases 5 through 8 of
its water distribution system in Somervell County, Texas (Figure 1). The proposed project
consists of approximately 40 miles of 6 to 12 inch diameter pipe. Pipelines will be located north,
south, and east of Glen Rose, which is the county seat of Somervell County. These routes will
approach the north side of the Squaw Creek channel and will cross Turner Bend on the west side
of the Brazos River. It will also cross the Brazos River in two places and will also follow roads
in the uplands south and east of Turner Bend. A relatively short line will cross the Paluxy River
just east of Glen Rose. Pipelines will also be installed along major and minor roads in the
uplands south of Glen Rose. In addition, one elevated storage tank would be constructed along
with three ground storage tanks with associated pump stations, these locations have yet to be
determined. Much of the pipeline will be constructed within or adjacent to existing road and
highway right-of-ways. The Area of Potential Effect (APE) for the pipeline route will consist of
a 40-foot wide right-of-way (ROW) with an average depth of installation being 48 inches. Two
portions of the pipeline routes fall within existing TxDOT ROW and these are along FM 200 and
Hwy 144. SCWD contracted with AR Consultants, Inc. (ARC) to conduct the intensive
pedestrian archaeological survey of the proposed routes.
Because Somervell County is a political subdivision of the State of Texas, a Texas Antiquities
Permit was required for this project. Permit number 5949 was issued to AR Consultants, Inc.,
with Cody S. Davis serving as Principal Investigator. Section 106 of the National Historic
Preservation Act of 1966 also applies to the environmental permitting. Other relevant federal
legislation includes the Clean Water Act, as amended (PL92500), the National Environmental
Act of 1969 (PL-90-190), and the Archeological and Historical Preservation Act of 1974, as
amended (PL-93-291).
This report is written in accordance with report guidelines developed by the Council of Texas
Archeologists (n.d.), and adopted by the Archeology Division of the Texas Historical
Commission. The following report presents a brief description of the natural setting of the
project area, followed by a discussion of the cultural history of Central Texas. A chapter on the
research design and methodology employed in the investigation is then followed by the results of
the field investigation. The report concludes with recommendations followed by the references
cited.

NATURAL ENVIRONMENT
The City of Glen Rose, which is situated roughly in the center of the study area, is located near
the southeastern edge of the Western Cross Timbers as defined by Dyksterhuis (1948:Figure 1),
although it is actually mapped as once having been open grassland. The bedded limestone of the
Glen Rose Formation (Bureau of Economic Geology 1988) underlies the Western Cross Timbers
and most of the Paluxy River Watershed as it winds its way through Somervell County to its
junction with the Brazos River. The river channel and Squaw Creek are flanked by Quaternary
alluvium and by Quaternary terraces that are between the alluvium of the floodplain and the toe
of the upland slopes. Numerous intermittent tributaries originate on the upland divides north and
south of the river and carry storm water runoff down to the river. These drainages are shown on
the Glen Rose East and Glen Rose West, TX 7.5’ USGS maps and on the relevant sheets in the
“Soil Survey of Hood and Somervell Counties, Texas (Coburn 1978).”
Vegetation in the study area varies among the distinct settings crossed by the pipeline route. The
uplands and slopes are dominated primarily by post oak, elm, and juniper (Figure 2), while the
river valleys support various grasses and mixed deciduous forest including pecans (Figures 3 and
4).

Cretaceous-aged limestone forms the majority of the underlying geology of the study area, with
the Glen Rose Formation of limestone present mainly to the west of the Brazos River and
flanking the Paluxy River (Bureau of Economic Geology 1988). Additional geological
formations present include the Paluxy Formation of sandstone, mudstone and limestone, which
overlies and roughly flanks the Glen Rose Formation, and the Walnut Clay formation, which is
composed almost equally of clay and limestone, and roughly encompasses the Paluxy Formation.
The river floodplains are composed of Quaternary-aged alluvial floodplain deposits, including
gravel, sand, silt and clay. Several of the slopes above the floodplains are composed of older
fluviatile terrace deposits.
Several soil association overly the geology of the region. These include the Tarrant-Purves
association of shallow clayey soils which overlay the upland limestone, and the WindthorstDuffau association of deep loamy and sandy soils which formed on the weakly-cemented
sandstone of the uplands (Coburn 1978: General Soils Map). Soils present in the floodplains
include the Bastrop-Yahola association of level sandy and loamy soils in the Brazos floodplain
and the Frio-Bosque association of level clayey and loamy soils in the Paluxy floodplain.
Given the three distinct topographical settings, the study area features significant relief. The
undulating upland areas crossed by the pipeline routes attain elevations of higher than 900’. The
steep slopes in this area have developed fairly rugged topography due to channel and slope
erosion and the down cutting of intermittent tributaries which drain the uplands. These factors
have resulted in several hills, valleys and benches on the slopes. The river floodplains constitute
the lowest setting in the study area, and sit at elevations well below 600’ asl.

CULTURE HISTORY
The prehistory of the Central Brazos River Valley has been summarized in conjunction with the
construction of Lakes Granbury, Whitney, and Wheeler Branch and Squaw Creek Reservoir
(Skinner 1971; Skinner and Humphreys 1973; Stephenson 1970; Moore 2005). These summaries
are not repeated here but information presented in them is used in putting the archaeology of the
Somervell County Water Pipeline in a regional perspective.
Based on the discovery of Clovis and other dart point styles on the surface of several sites, it is
apparent that the region was first occupied by Paleo-Indians sometime before 9,000 BC (Blaine,
Harris, Crook, and Shiner 1968; Skinner and Rash 1969). No evidence of this early occupation
has been documented from Somervell County (Bever and Meltzer 2007). This early occupation
is further confirmed by the finding of Folsom and Brazos Fishtail dart points during excavation
at the Horn Shelter Number 2 downstream in Bosque County (Redder 1985; Forrester 1985).
The stratum with Folsom points has not been dated at Horn Shelter but four radiocarbon dates
from Stratum 5G date the Brazos Fishtail points at about 8,000 BC (Watt 1978). The subsequent
Plainview stratum (8B) has been dated 6,450 BC.
Prehistoric sites have been described at numerous locations within the river and creek valleys as
well as on the bluffs that overlook the valleys. Sites include deeply buried and vertically
stratified deposits, midden deposits [including sites like Asa Warner (Watt 1956)] that contain an
abundance of freshwater mussels, lithic workshops, and inhabited rock overhangs. There appears
to have been a heavy occupation during the Late Archaic period, but prehistoric occupation was
continuous by the Native American residents who apparently practiced a seasonal round and a
hunting and gathering economy. It appears likely that about a thousand years ago the local
economy shifted to a more "Plains"-oriented subsistence pattern that is reflected by an increase
in Plains-adapted animals, particularly the buffalo, and in a tool kit that included specialized
scrapers, arrow points, and the manufacture of pottery (Shafer 1977).
Historic archaeology in the area has focused on the excavation of Native American sites, or on
the recording of small samples of artifacts that relate to this time period. The Walton site (Story
1985), the Stansbury site (Stephenson 1970:58-111), and the Mixon site (Harris, Harris, and
Blaine 1974). This pattern of widely dispersed, or at least preserved, historic Native American
sites appears to be the norm throughout North Central Texas and the Southern Plains (Skinner
1988). The presence of few and widely scattered historic sites does not match with the historical
documentation of marauding Indians in this region, but may be a true reflection of the ephemeral
nature of historic Native American occupation and the shift to horse travel. The historic Anglo
occupation of the area began in the mid-1800s and is known primarily for the occupation of Glen
Rose and the early twentieth century discovery of dinosaur tracks in the bed of the Paluxy River.
A unique thing about the historic settlement is the presence of early twentieth century houses in
the immediate Glen Rose area where locally acquired petrified wood was used in the creation of
distinctive vernacular house and commercial building facades (Saltarelli n.d.).

Previous Investigations
Archaeological investigations in Somervell and surrounding counties have reported prehistoric
artifacts spanning the period from the Paleo-Indian (ca. 8,000 B.C.) to the Late Prehistoric (A.D.
500 to 1700). The Texas Archeological Atlas (2011) was checked to determine if any
archaeological sites were listed along any of the pipeline routes but none were listed, although
sites have been documented along the benches, terraces, and floodplains of the Brazos and
Paluxy rivers as well in the Squaw Creek Watershed. The nearby Squaw Creek Reservoir was
surveyed for archaeological sites by the Archaeology Research Program at Southern Methodist
University [SMU] (Skinner and Humphreys 1973) in 1973. Fifty one archaeological sites were
recorded in the reservoir and construction study areas. These included primarily prehistoric
middens and lithic scatters along with historic log cabins, houses, a school, and a lime kiln. The
survey was followed by excavation of the Hopewell School site (41SV30), which was a Late
Archaic campsite (Gallagher and Bearden 1976). Approximately 300 square meters of the site
were excavated. A variety of lithic tools included dart points, hammerstones, cores, bifaces, and
ground stone tools were recovered as were animal bones.
Additional surveys downstream from the power plant dam and on the adjacent Brazos River
terrace have located prehistoric sites in settings similar to the upstream area. These surveys
include the Squaw Creek Golf Course (Moore 1991; Moore and Bradle 1997), the Glen Rose
Housing Development site (Todd 2008), the SH 144 crossing of Squaw Creek, and US 67 on the
west side of the Brazos River (Griffith and Boyd 2006). Survey at the golf course found four
previously unrecorded prehistoric sites and revisited 41SV51 where rock art had previously been
reported. During a subsequent golf course survey in 1997, a buried hearth was located in the
terrace deposit adjacent to an old Squaw Creek channel. Burned rock was encountered at 45 cm
and additional rock with bone, and charcoal were found between 95 and 110 cm in a trench. This
site, 41SV151, was avoided and preserved in-place. A single quartzite flake was found on a knoll
at the Glen Rose Housing Development site but was reported as an isolated artifact. No sites
were found along US 67 west of the Brazos.
The proposed Wheeler Branch Reservoir was investigated by Brazos Valley Research Associate
[BVRA] (Moore 2005). Approximately 496 acres were investigated, but only two 20th century
farmsteads and a dam were recorded. In 2010, BVRA surveyed sections of the Wheeler Branch
Pipeline and the water treatment plant (Moore and Baxter 2010; Frederick 2010). Two isolated
finds and artifacts at site 41SV51 were encountered, but no further investigation was
recommended.
Site 41SV153 was recorded and then tested where SH 144 crosses Squaw Creek. The site is
situated in Holocene sediments but chipped stone lithics and fire-cracked rock were scarce and
the rock features uncovered were displaced. Due to the inability to date the deposit and
reconstruct the natural environment, the part of the site in the road easement was considered not
eligible for listing in the National Register of Historic Places (Griffith and Boyd 2006).
Surveys and testing in the Paluxy River Watershed have recorded buried site deposits in the
floodplain and on terrace sediments and limestone knolls. Numerous sites were recorded during

archaeological surveys of the Dinosaur Valley State Park. During the archaeological evaluation
of the Dinosaur State Park, SMU (Gallagher n.d.) recorded four prehistoric sites containing lithic
debris, mussel shells, and midden deposits. No diagnostic artifacts were found. Two of the sites
(41SV56 and 41SV57) were subsequently tested (Turpin 1994). Site 41SV56 contained at least
five intact occupational levels and dated to the Late Prehistoric period based upon radiocarbon
samples. Based upon the artifact assemblage type, site 41SV57 was tentatively dated to the Late
Prehistoric. During the testing, four other prehistoric sites (41SV117 to 41SV120) were recorded
and a historic farmstead (41SV63) was assessed for future impact and this supplemented
information from SMU and a previous Texas Parks and Wildlife survey (Carpenter, Utley,
Carlson, and Turpin 1999).
Lemens Rockshelter (41SV60) contained two Late Prehistoric burials and is located more than
15 km west of Glen Rose on a tributary of the Bosque River. The rockshelter was used primarily
as a hunting camp based upon the number of arrow points and lithic debris present. One burial
was an adult male, 35 to 45 years old, and the other was a four year old child. The adult grave
contained a variety of burial goods including polished pebbles, a hammerstone, a Scallorn arrow
point, a bone fish hook, a freshwater mussel shell, and bone and antler tools (Smith 1994).
Two prehistoric sites, the Rodeo Hill and Third Dam, are located on the south side of the Paluxy
River midway between Glen Rose and the Brazos River junction (Smith 1996:67-75). The sites
contained burned rock, arrow points, lithic tools, bison and deer bones, bone tools, and shell
concentrations. The pottery types include Maydelle Incised and possibly Canton Incised, which
are Late Caddo wares from East Texas, which correspond in age to the Alba, Bonham, and
Perdiz arrow points that were also recovered.

RESEARCH DESIGN & METHODOLOGY
Research Design
The pipeline route crosses three settings with the potential for containing historic or prehistoric
archaeological sites, however the planned boring under the Brazos and Paluxy Rivers will
essentially avoided the need for deep testing or profiling in the floodplain sediments. The
limestone-based uplands and upland drainage channels throughout Somervell County generally
contain shallow young sediment deposits where cultural materials are exposed on the surface
when they are present. These upland settings have a low potential for containing preserved
archaeological sites. The terraces along the Paluxy and Brazos Rivers have a higher potential for
containing prehistoric sites that may be exposed on the surface of formerly or presently farmed
fields or buried in the deep Holocene sediments that fill the valleys.
Although roads follow ridge-tops and cross valleys throughout the upland, historic residences are
also widely spread due to ownership of relatively large tracts and the scattered pattern of small
pieces of farmable land. Most of the upland has been used as pastures over the past century.
Furthermore, residences were generally set back from the edges of unpaved roads in order to
avoid being showered with dust caused by passing traffic. Significantly larger farmable areas are
located on the terraces of the Brazos and Paluxy Rivers where residences tended to be located
adjacent to or at the end of roads in areas which were not prime farmland or were difficult to
farm such as the toe of bluffs at the valley edge. Consequently, it is predicted that residences will
be found throughout the area but in widely dispersed settings set back from most pipeline routes
that parallel the roads.

Methodology
Field personnel visually inspected all segments of the pipeline routes, either from the roadways
or during pedestrian survey, and made field notes about artifacts on the surface, ground
exposure, soil types, and disturbed areas. Shovel tests were excavated on a judgmental basis in
areas determined by archival research or perceived in the field to have high archaeological
potential. Shovel tests were excavated to subsoil or to an approximate depth of 150cm, so as to
search for buried site deposits, and were excavated according to THC standards (n.d.). Shovel
tests averaged 30 cm in diameter. The clay fill from the shovel tests was hand sorted, while
loamy and sandy fill was screened through 1/4” hardware cloth screens to determine if cultural
materials were present. Trench profiles were described following the procedures developed by
Vogel (2002), and photographs of the profiles were taken. Shovel test and trench matrices were
also described on the basis of texture and color. The Munsell Soil Color Chart was used to
identify soil colors. Shovel test and trench locations were recorded using Garmin GPSmap 76,
GPSmap 76CX, GPSmap 78, and Colorado 400t handheld GPS receivers. Photographs were
taken throughout the survey area using a Canon PowerShot SD1100 IS Digital Elph 8.0 mega
pixel digital camera.

RESULTS
This chapter begins with a description of the twelve pipeline routes (PL 1-12) that have been
defined in a shapefile provided by the SCWD (Figures 5 and 6). Additionally, this section
includes descriptions of archaeological sites located and recorded during the survey. Almost all
of the pipeline routes run adjacent to existing roadways, generally within the road easement. The
results of the geomorphological investigation are contained in the second part of this chapter.
Conclusions about the historic and prehistoric archaeology are presented at the end of the
chapter. Shovel tests are discussed in the text and a complete description is presented in the table
at the end of the archaeological survey section.

The Survey
PL 1: This pipeline is approximately 2.87 miles long, and parallels North SH 144. It is situated
primarily on the west side of the highway, but on the south end it crosses to the east side for the
final 1800’. The majority of this pipeline runs through improved pasture, which features ankle to
knee-high grasses and ground visibility between 20 and 40 percent. Some maintained areas,
which feature thick Bermuda grass, are present and ground visibility in these areas is limited.
This roughly parallels part of an intermittent tributary of Squaw Creek, and crosses the channel
several times. Soil here is rocky and thin with excellent ground visibility, but the areas near the
drainage are thickly wooded with junipers. No cultural materials were found along this route.
PL 2: For its northernmost 700’, this pipeline parallels the south side of Van Zandt Road, before
turning south and crossing the Paluxy River in a southwesterly direction. It then runs through
2200’ of open pasture, before following a two track road that extends from the northeastern end
of Summit Edge Drive for approximately 2000’. It then skirts gravel fire roads and back fences
of the Summit Edge Housing Development, before turning south to run through a thickly

wooded area, before terminating at the proposed pump location at the end of Bryan Drive. The
entirety of this route was surveyed, with the final portion along Van Zandt being inspected from
the road.
The southern 1.5 miles of this 2.2-mile long route runs through a thickly wooded upland setting.
Ground visibility showed abundant eroding limestone bedrock on the surface, and shovel tests
(01 through 03) demonstrated that the dark grayish brown sandy loam soil is exceedingly
shallow, attaining depths of only between 3 and 8 cm over the bedrock. It was not until the broad
floodplain south of the Paluxy was surveyed that soils of any depth were encountered. Shovel
testing here commenced with ST 04, which encountered 45cm of dark grayish brown loamy clay
over dark brown clay, with a trace of eroding limestone. The two subsequent shovel tests (05 and
06) uncovered a similar soil profile of clays, though in varying hues ranging between dark
reddish brown and very dark gray, with occasional pieces of limestone. ST 07, which was
excavated approximately 20 meters from the Paluxy channel, encountered various hues of sandy
clay loam to a depth of 135cm. It is likely that this resulted from the deposition of large particle
sand close to the channel, while smaller particle clay was deposited as much or more than 500 m
away from the channel (the overall distance that was shovel tested).
Two shovel tests (08 and 09) were excavated northeast of the Paluxy crossing. Shovel test 08
was placed immediately northeast of the steep east bank of the channel, in an expanse of pasture
similar to that encountered to the southwest. The soil profile encountered in this shovel test
closely mirrored that seen in 07, and consisted of various hues of mottled sandy loams to a depth
of over 130cm. Shovel test 09 was placed approximately 145 meters north of 08 and 25 meters
south of Van Zandt Road, in a wooded area that featured distinctly rising topography, and which
was situated almost on the toe slope of the upland edge (Figure 7). This shovel test encountered
dark grayish brown, brown and dark yellowish brown sandy clay loams with some degraded
limestone to a depth of 85cm, at which point the test was terminated due to impenetrable roots.
No cultural materials were encountered in any of the shovel tests excavated along PL 2.

At the northern end of PL 2 along Van Zandt Road, two historic structures were noted near the
route. These include a rock house and gas station, both of which are situated on the north side of
Van Zandt Road. The gas station, which dates to the early 20th century (Saltarelli n.d.: Figures
30-32), features a great deal of petrified wood which has been incorporated into the construction
of its exterior (Figure 8). The gas station also served as a speakeasy and was built in the late
1920s. It has red and white brock trim and is known locally as Sycamore Grove. A ragged
cornice of vertical slabs of petrified wood lines the tops of the walls on the north and south
elevations. The chimney of Sycamore Grove is located in the north elevation and has a diamondshaped “window” outlined with petrified logs and with limestone filling the center of the
window. Despite the known historic age of the gas station, field personnel did not have access to
the land, and did not have landowner permission to record the structure as a site.

Figure 8.

side of Van Zandt Road. View is to the northwest.

PL 3: This line parallels SH 67 for approximately 0.92 miles east of its intersection with CR
2008. The entirety of the segment’s length is situated on the eastern side of the road. It is located
in upland prairie utilized primarily as pasturage, and is at a considerable distance from perennial
water sources. The Barker Branch channel crossing was given special attention, but was noted to
be entirely dry, with exposed limestone bedrock visible on the channel bottom. No cultural
resources were noted along this pipeline route.
PL 4: Running for approximately 1600’ from the intersection of SH 67 and CR 2008, this
pipeline’s western end marks the planned location of Pump Station #1. Though essentially
located in the same upland prairie setting as PL 3, this area is far less maintained, and features
abundant junipers. The pump station site is located in a fenced vacant lot east of the Cedar Ridge
RV Park. Given its upland setting, this segment was visually inspected but no evidence of
historic or prehistoric occupation was noted.

PL 5: PL 5 runs for approximately 5.9 miles, and parallels CR 2008 from its intersection with
SH 67 to its intersection with SH 144 to the south. The route crosses the road several times, but
generally runs along the east side of the road. There are two short cross-country portions. The
first is approximately 2200’ long and is routed straight southeast from an eastern curve in the
road that runs by the Ward Branch Cemetery. By doing so, the route avoids the cemetery by
more than 300’. The second is 1.3 miles to the south, where the pipeline diverges from the road
to avoid an almost 140-degree turn.
Situated in the same upland pasture as the two previous pipelines, the vast majority of PL 5 was
merely visually inspected. Although several intermittent tributaries and the main channels of
both Barker Branch and Cross Branch are crossed, the pipeline crosses them extremely high up
in their watersheds. Indeed, the upland divide between these and other watersheds is located less
than 4000’ south of the southernmost extent of PL 5. Both main channels were dry and featured
eroding limestone bedrock visible in the channel bottoms. Even so, shovel tests (10 and 11) were
excavated on either side of Cross Branch (Figure 9). Both encountered limestone gravel on the
surface, with very thin to no coverage of sandy loam. This confirmed that what artifacts might
have been present would be readily visible on the surface, although no artifacts were observed.
No additional shovel testing was conducted along PL 5.

Site 41SV173
One historic site was recorded approximately 1700’ south of the Cross Branch crossing, near the
final eastern turn in CR 2008. The site consists of the remnants of an early to mid-20th century
house site, and consists of a storm cellar, a poured concrete water tank and a pipe for a nowabsent windmill (Figures 10 and 11). The entire site sits east of the fence line that runs east of the

16

road easement, and is partially within the 40’ wide ROW. The cellar is located in a corner
formed by the north to south-running fence line and an east to west-running one located
immediately to the north. The cellar extends to the northeast, with its stairwell access facing the
roadway. It measures 11.5’ west to east, 8’ north to south, and features a 5’ by 2.25’ stairwell
situated at the cellar’s southeastern corner. Three stairs lead down into the approximately 5’ tall
interior of the cellar. Iron bolts are present on the sidewalls of the stairwell, and likely mark
where a door was attached. A vertical iron pipe is anchored in the roof and provided ventilation.
Approximately 33’ east of the storm cellar, along the east to west-running fence line, is a poured
concrete water tank, which is between 9’ and 10’ tall, with a circumference of approximately 8’.
A metal faucet extends from the south-facing side of the tank, roughly 4’ above the base of the
tank. The concrete face of the tank below this height is greatly degraded, revealing the vertical
rebar that reinforces the concrete. Approximately 6.5’ south of the tank is a 4’ high vertical
length of pipe, which likely formed part of a windmill-operated pump. It is secured in the ground
by a poured concrete base, which seems to be of finer-aggregate than the tank or cellar,
indicating it was either a newer addition or replaced a previous pipe.
The scant remnants of a previously-demolished house are present approximately 20’ to the south
of the cellar and tank in the form of a possible concrete step, a roughly 22’ long span of
cemented limestone foundation skirting, a broken concrete slab, and a pile of housing debris. The
foundation skirting extends northeast from the step, and is approximately 1.5’ tall. The debris
pile includes corrugated metal, concrete chunks, bricks, timber, pipes and a cast iron bathtub.
The presence of a shade tree, and several planted bushes such as lantana, irises and mulberry,
suggest a house site, though no additional building materials were found that would suggest the
presence of a structure. A barn is located to the north of the site along a north to south-running
fence line, though this, like the majority of features at this site, is outside the 40’ ROW (Figures
12 and 13). Additionally, PL 5 was rerouted further to the west, so as to completely avoid the site
during construction.

Plan map of site 41SV173.

In order to ascertain the age of this site, the family that currently owns the property was
contacted, and Irene Henkens, née Mann, who lived on the property as a child, was interviewed.
Her father, Proctor Mann, and brother purchased the land on which the site is located in 1942 or
’43 (Henkens, personal communication 2011). The house, of which almost nothing remains, was
already on the property at that time, and she believes it was built in the 1920s or 1930s.
However, the house was remodeled immediately prior to the Mann family’s purchase, and the
windmill (now completely absent), tank and barn were built at approximately the same time, but
may have been on the property somewhat earlier. The cellar was built by her father some time
after the initial purchase, possibly in the late 1940s. The house and property were rented out by
Mrs. Henkens’ brother starting in the 1950s. The house burned down in the past two years, and
was demolished shortly thereafter.

An addition to PL 5 runs southwest from the main route approximately 4000’ south of the
intersection of CR 2008 and 2009, and the entirety of this addition was walked. This route runs
through rocky upland with abundant growth of junipers, and sparse ground cover of ankle-high
grass (Figure 14). Ground visibility ranged from 30 and 70 percent, with eroding limestone and
fossilized mussel shells (Texigryphaea) visible on the surface (Figure 15). The route terminated
at the base of a distinct knoll, atop which a pump station will be located. Only one shovel test
(12) was excavated along this portion of the route, and this was placed in an area with relatively
low ground visibility, where abundant soil was observed on the surface. It encountered 40 cm of
brown sandy clay loam with abundant eroding limestone bedrock and some calcium carbonate in
the lower depths. Bedrock was encountered below this depth. No cultural resources were located
in this test or on the ground surface.

PL 6: This route parallels FM 144 to the west for 4.1 miles north of its intersection with CR
2008. Situated in the same upland prairie setting as previously described pipeline, featuring 20 to
60 percent ground visibility, and crossed by only the upper ends of intermittent drainages, this
route was visually inspected. The proposed location of Pump Station #3 sits immediately west of
the route on a slightly elevated knoll. No cultural resources were encountered.
PL7: Paralleling the west side of South FM 56, this pipeline generally runs through the same
upland prairie setting as many of the previously discussed routes. As shown earlier, parts of the
route were planted in Bermuda grass. Parts of this route, however, feature far greater tree cover,
particularly the northern portion, which is located near or crossed by intermittent tributaries of
the Paluxy River, such as Montgomery Branch. Although Montgomery Branch was noted to be a
dry channel with a limestone bedrock bottom, some soil was noted adjacent to the channel. As
such, three shovel tests (13, 14 and 15) were excavated on either side of the crossing. Shovel
tests 13 and 14 were placed north of the channel, and encountered between 15 and 20 cm of
yellowish brown sandy loam overlaying gravelly deposits of eroding bedrock. Shovel test 15,
placed 35 meters south of the creek, encountered a similar soil profile, although the top layer
attained a depth of 30cm, at which point a dark yellowish brown sandy loam was encountered.
These soils overlaid the same gravelly deposit as seen north of the channel. No artifacts were
noted in any of the three shovel tests or on the surface anywhere along the route.
PL 8: Running for 2.4 miles, this pipeline alternately parallels the north, south and west sides of
CR 303, before turning east to parallel the north and west sides of CR 305. This route is situated
in a low lying portion of the upland, near the slopes leading down to the Brazos River valley.
Though it encountered elevations of as low as 650’ asl at its eastern extreme on Turner Bend, the
route is primarily well over 100’ higher than the river channel. Although PL 8 runs through some
wooded and unmaintained areas, particularly where it comes within a half mile of the Brazos at
the southern curve in CR 303, the route runs primarily through pastures and fields. Ground
visibility was accordingly excellent, generally averaging between 30 and 70 percent. Reddish
clay was seen in the numerous exposures, with very little bedrock noted on the surface. Because
of this excellent ground visibility, and due to the route being crossed only by the extreme upper
end of an intermittent tributary of the Brazos, the majority of the route was visually inspected.
However, one shovel test was excavated on a portion of the route which exhibited some potential
for containing cultural resources, as it was situated near a ridge overlooking the Brazos to the
north. This shovel test (16) encountered 65cm of reddish brown sandy clay loam with abundant
water-rolled pebbles and eroded limestone. Below 65cm, the soil was too compact to continue
digging, and so the shovel test was terminated. No cultural material was observed or
encountered.
PL 9: This route parallels SH 67 for a distance of 3.23 miles between FM 200 on the west to
FM 199 on the east. With the exception of 1.2 miles of route that runs north of the road, the
majority of PL 9 parallels the south side of SH 67. The western approximately 1.5 miles is
situated in low lying portions of the upland similar to the setting encountered along PL 8. In
addition to pastures, some commercial structures and parking lots are present along the pipeline
ROW, and much of the route was within the road easement of SH 67, which has been built up
and disturbed to a greater degree than other roadways paralleled by previously discussed routes.

Given its potential for containing buried prehistoric deposits, the Brazos crossing was intensively
surveyed. Shovel testing was performed both west of the Brazos on the east-trending slope of
Turner Bend, where Bureau of Economic Geology maps indicated that fluviatile terrace deposits
were present, and atop the steep slopes to the east of the river. Four shovel tests (17 through 20)
were placed at 200-meter intervals west of the channel. Shovel test 17, excavated approximately
30 meters west of the channel, and consequently within the portion of the crossing that will be
bored, encountered 65cm of yellowish brown sandy clay loam with trace fragments of degrading
limestone over light yellowish brown sand to a depth of 150cm. This predominance of large
particle sand is in keeping with the close proximity of the shovel test to the channel, and
indicates that it encountered Quaternary-aged alluvium rather than the terrace deposits mapped
upslope from the channel. The three subsequent shovel tests encountered between 28 and 35 cm
of brown clayey sandy loam overlaying dark yellowish brown sandy clay loam, which was
consistent with the terrace setting in which this portion of the route is mapped (Bureau of
Economic Geology 1988). No cultural material was encountered.
Shovel testing on the east side of the Brazos floodplain encountered a soil profile containing far
more clayey soils than were seen to the west, but of comparable depth. Shovel testing then
moved to the uplands overlooking the channel. It had been the intention to shovel test the tops of
the upland ridges east of the channel, but in the case of the highest point atop the ridge
immediately east of the Brazos, this was found to be impossible. This is due to the fact that the
high point of this ridge has been leveled to form the SH 67 road embankment, and has also been
concretized, negating the need for shovel testing in this area (Figure 16). As such, only a single
shovel test (22) was excavated atop the lower-lying portion of this ridge to the east. It
encountered a predictably shallow soil profile of very dark grayish brown sandy clay loam over
eroding limestone bedrock. No cultural resources were observed in the test or on the ground
surface, despite the excellent ground visibility in this area.

PL 10: This 2.06-mile long pipeline parallels the north side of SH 67 for approximately 2800’
east of its intersection with FM 199, and then curves back to the west to parallel the same 2800’
on the south side of the road. It then turns south to parallel the west side of FM 199 for
approximately 5000’, before crossing the road and paralleling the east side for its final 900’.
Pump Station #4 is situated immediately east of the route’s southern end. This route features
good ground visibility, as it is situated in previously cleared upland pasture, although judging by
the age of the abundant growth of invasive junipers and mesquite, much of the area has been
abandoned as active pasture in the last few decades. Many large pecans remain, indicating native
deciduous growth, which is in keeping with its proximity to several wooded intermittent
tributaries of the Brazos. The route often parallels the side slopes of these tributary drainage
valleys, the slopes of which are generally between 12 and 15 percent. Given the good ground
visibility along this segment, the slope of the terrain, and the absence of drainage crossings, this
route was visually inspected. No cultural resources were encountered along the route.
PL 11: Paralleling SH 67 to its intersection with CR 308, turning south to parallel 308, and
finally turning west to parallel CR 407/FM 200, this pipeline is situated primarily in the same
previously cleared upland pasture as PL 10. Although the westernmost 5000’ of this alignment
along SH 67 is situated in a drainage valley similar to that crossed by PL 10, it avoids the
elevated knolls within the valley which have some potential for having been occupied
prehistorically. The remainder of the route runs entirely through uplands which are crossed by
the upper ends of mostly dry unnamed, intermittent tributaries of slightly larger, unnamed Brazos
tributary channels. No cultural resources were found along the route.
PL 12: Although situated primarily in the same unmaintained upland pasture setting
encountered by the two previous pipeline routes, PL 12 also crosses the Brazos, skirts a short
portion of the upland edge slopes and crosses the drainage valley of the intermittent Eddy
Branch, which flows into the Brazos. Running for a distance of approximately 3.9 miles, almost
the entirety of the route parallels FM 200 south of SH 67. Both sides of the Brazos crossing were
surveyed, with approximately 0.5 miles of the route being walked and shovel tested between CR
312 in the north and the eastern turn in FM 200 on the south.
North of the channel, the route ran through open pasture situated atop a broad rise, which
featured ankle to knee-high mixed grasses, before encountering the slopes overlooking the
channel. These featured rugged terrain, rocky soils with abundant eroding bedrock, and a series
of benches leading down to the channel. The slopes were thickly wooded, with an overstory
containing both native deciduous growth and invasive juniper and mesquite. The abandoned FM
200 roadway cuts east across the pipeline atop the first bench below the pasture, and features a
rock wall which may have either been part of a scenic overlook or may have been used to ease
erosion (Figure 17). A second wall, composed of coarse-aggregate poured concrete, was
encountered on the second bench below the pasture (Figure 18). This wall appeared to be
somewhat older than the rock wall, possibly dating to the mid 20th century, and was likely built
for flood control. Given the uncertain date of the two walls, and their location on the slopes
which will be bored under by the pipeline, they were not recorded as historic archaeological
sites.

South of the channel, the route ran through a wooded area that featured a floodplain that sloped
toward the Brazos, including a distinct drop-off approximately 300’ south of the channel. Shovel
test 23 was excavated 15 meters south of the Brazos on the floodplain, and encountered various
hues of slightly clayey sandy loam to a depth of 150cm. This area was likely cleared in the past,
but now features abundant deciduous growth, particularly along the drop-off. As the terrain rises
to the south, the route encountered mowed pasture. Sites were recorded on both sides of the
channel. A prehistoric site (41SV175) was recorded on a bench of sandy Quaternary alluvium
north of the channel, while a historic site (41SV174) was recorded on the east of the road south
of the channel.

Site 41SV175
This site was recorded during shovel testing of the route north of the Brazos crossing. Negative
shovel test 24 was excavated approximately 100 meters south of CR 312, and encountered a soil
profile of variously hued fine sands to a depth of 155cm, suggesting the presence of terrace soils
on this rise above the channel, as it is mapped by the SCS. Shovel test 25 was placed 100 meters
to the south, adjacent to the drop-off to the first bench. It encountered three strata of clayey
sandy loam and sandy clay loam over a layer of slightly clayey sand reached at 130cm, and was
positive for cultural resources. It contained abundant lithic debitage recovered between
approximately 80 and 130cmbs, which included 30 flakes and 8 chips or shatter (Table 1).
Relatively fine-grained chert was the primary raw material present, although some quartzite
artifacts were recovered. Primary, secondary and tertiary flakes were encountered, and 14 were
tentatively determined to have been heat-treated. Some of the chips and shatter were also heattreated.
An effort was then made to delineate the horizontal boundaries from the positive shovel test
through additional shovel testing. Shovel tests 26 and 27 were excavated downslope to the south
and southeast and both encountered abundant lithics similar to those seen in 25, and encountered
them at far shallower depths, with some just below the surface. Shovel test 26 contained 152
artifacts between 0 and 90cmbs. The type and variety of lithics was similar to that found in 25
except that four freshwater mussel shell fragments were encountered between 70 and 80cmbs.
Historic artifacts were encountered as well, and these included fragments of blue and clear glass
and an earthenware rim shard. Shovel test 27 encountered abundant lithics as well as pieces of
bone, shell, charcoal and a square-cut nail and a piece of earthenware pottery. Thirty-nine was

25

the total artifact count for shovel test 27. Shovel test 28, located east of 25, was negative, but
shovel tests 29 and 30 were positive for both historic (29) and prehistoric (30) artifacts.
Attempts to delineate the site by shovel testing at greater distances from 25 proved unsuccessful,
as shovel test 31, which was excavated approximately 70 meters north, encountered only four
flakes. However, the decrease in lithics to the north indicates lowering artifact concentration, and
hints at a site boundary somewhere between shovel test 25 and 31. The results of this shovel
testing are in keeping with statements made by the property owner, who recalled encountering
lithics, including projectile points, throughout the pasture. The widespread nature of the positive
shovel tests and the diversity of material encountered, indicates that the site is likely a
widespread prehistoric midden, which may constitute an area contiguous with the rise atop which
the pasture is located (Figure 19).
In an attempt to avoid site 41SV175, a reroute of PL 12, which moved the route approximately
620’ to the east of the pasture into the adjacent property, was approved by the District. This
reroute ran the pipeline directly west of a heavily disturbed area shown on recent aerial
photographs, which has sustained obvious earth mining efforts, resulting in virtually no
undisturbed soil remaining in the area. In addition to the general disturbance, an approximately
three to five-meter deep and four to six-meter wide trench has been open cut along the path of
the proposed alignment (Figure 20). According to the property manager, Tim Spears, this trench
was dug in preparation for the installation of a road that will be utilized to park FEMA trailers in
a lot by the river. The trench began approximately 25 meters south of the northern end of the PL
12 reroute, and continued to a point well south of the reroute’s bore point. The bore point may be
identified by a southeastern turn in the line north of the Brazos crossing.
Shovel test 32 was excavated at the northern end of the reroute. It encountered a series of fine
sands and fine sandy loams to a depth of 150cm. Only two chert chips, one primary and one
secondary, were encountered in this shovel test, and they were encountered between 50 and 70
cmbs. Shovel test 33, excavated downslope and 100 meters to the south of 32, and immediately
west of the reroute and the open cut trench encountered similar soils, but encountered some fine
sandy clay beginning at 90cmbs, before encountering yellowish red sandy clay subsoil at a depth
of 105cmbs. Shovel test 33 encountered a higher density of artifacts than 32, but most of the
artifacts were encountered at roughly the same depth, 50 to 60cmbs. These include five chert
flakes and chips. Single artifacts were encountered at 0 to 10cmbs and 20 to 30cmbs.
The relative density of artifacts in these tests generally mirrors that seen in the shovel tests
excavated on the original PL 12 route. In both routes, artifact density increases markedly
approaching the channel, and decreases as elevation increases. This indicates that, with the
exception of some outliers such as shovel test 32, the majority of site deposits are to be found
near the edge of the terrace overlooking the river, and not in the gently sloping uplands to the
north.
The open cut shown in Figure 20 reaches to the depth of the subsoil, and has even reached the
depth of the underlying bedrock in many places. As such, the rerouting of the pipeline through
this heavily disturbed area constitutes effective avoidance of the site.

The open cut trench on the PL 12 reroute. View is to the south.

Site 41SV174
This site was located immediately east of the pipeline ROW off of FM 200 south of the Brazos
channel (Figure 21). It consisted of a storm cellar, which is likely all that remains of a mapped
structure shown at this location on the 1961 Nemo, TX 7.5’ USGS map (Photorevised 1979).
Though similar in construction to that seen at site 41SV173, this cellar was somewhat more
ornate, in that it featured red tile, petrified wood and limestone inset within the poured concrete
walls of the structure (Figure 22). One such inset feature of note is a brick located on the exterior
of the west wall of the stairwell, which bears the inscription “M R CO, 96 108” (Figure 23). The

cellar also features windows on its southwest and northeast-facing walls, which are noted on the
plan map.
In addition to being more ornate than the cellar at site 41SV173, this cellar is also slightly larger.
Oriented at roughly 45 degrees, the cellar measures approximately 12’ along its longest
(southwest) side, and over 10’ along its shorter (northwest) side. The stairwell, which extends
from the southeast wall, measures 6.3’ by 4.2’, and features seven steps down to the interior of
the cellar, which has a height of over 6’ from floor to ceiling. A 3”-diameter pipe runs along the
roof of the structure, exiting into the stairwell, and was likely meant to balance air and provide
ventilation. Hinges from a door remain on the east wall of the stairwell.
Four shovel tests (34 through 37) were excavated along the PL 12 route west of the cellar.
Shovel test 34 encountered 40cm of mottled slightly clayey sandy loam with abundant road fill
material such as asphalt and crushed rock, and an impenetrable layer of road fill below. A
corroded wire nail was present in the top 15cmbs. 35, 36 and 37 encountered deep yellowish red
slightly clayey sandy loam to depths of up to 150cmbs. In 36 and 37, a 24 to 28 cm-thick top
layer of very dark grayish brown compact sandy loam was encountered above the slightly clayey
sandy loam. The only cultural material encountered was a single piece of blue-glazed
Depression-era pottery encountered in the top 15cm of shovel test 36. No further testing was
conducted.

After the survey, an interview was conducted with Mr. Ray Creswell, the current landowner of
the property on which site 41SV174 is located. Mr. Creswell has owned the property since 1963,
and, by that time, whatever structure had been associated with the cellar was already gone
(personnel communication 2011). However, he learned from the previous landowner, Mr. E.J.
Dowdy, that a bait store was located at that point south of the Brazos crossing on what was then
SH 67, but which is now FM 200. Mr. Creswell stated that it is likely that the store operated from
the 1930s to at least the time when the SH 67 bridge collapsed in 1943, as this effectively
eliminated the main route along which customers could reach the shop. It is likely that the cellar
was associated with the store, and that the owners had a residence near the shop, or lived in the
same building, and used the storm cellar during inclement weather. As such, if the shop did
indeed operate during the 1930s, and the cellar was built during that time, a tentative age for the
site would be around 80 years old. As PL 12 was rerouted to the east to run through the disturbed
area north of the river, this site has been entirely avoided by the proposed pipeline route.
South of the Brazos crossing, PL 12 has been rerouted to closely parallel an abandoned portion
of FM 200 (Figure 24). As the pipeline will be routed either under the old FM 200 roadway, or
between the roadway and the fence to the west, shovel testing was confined to relatively
undisturbed areas in this narrow space. Five shovel tests were excavated in this area, starting
with shovel test 38, which was excavated immediately south of the bore point. This shovel test
encountered various hues of very fine sandy clay loam and clayey sandy loam to depths of 32cm,
where an impenetrable gravel layer was encountered. The top 32cm contained abundant pea
gravels and limestone chunks, indicating that the roadbed for FM 200 extends at least this far
west of the roadway. Shovel test 39 encountered much the same types of mottled soils to a depth
of 35cmbs, although in addition to the pea gravel, quartzite cobbles and limestone chunks were
encountered in shovel test 38, and shovel test 39 also contained marine fossils (Texigryphaea).
Below 35cm, very compact very dark brown and pale brown clay was encountered.
Shovel test 40 contained three darkening layers of fine sandy loam and silty sandy loam, with at
least one zone containing the pea gravels and limestone chunks seen in earlier tests. Like 39, this
test encountered a clay subsoil at a depth of 68cmbs, which consisted of mottled yellowish
brown sandy clay and very pale brown clay. This soil profile is generally consistent with the
profile observed in a column of uneroded or unleveled soil seen at the base of a tree west of the
pipeline route, which featured roughly 30 to 40cm of generally dark brown soil in the top of the
profile overlaying steadily lightening yellowish brown soils, which appeared to be clay (Figure
25).
Shovel tests 41 and 42 encountered shallow soil profiles consisting of mottled fill from the
roadway, with asphalt, crushed rock and pea gravel present. No further shovel tests were
excavated to the north of these, as the space between the pipeline and the fence line narrows
moving north, and the likelihood of encountering further road fill in subsequent tests was high.

After pedestrian survey of the Somervell County Water District Pipeline route, a series of
backhoe trenches were excavated near the major river crossings to search for deeply buried
cultural material. This trenching was done by Steve Ahr of on September 14 and 18, 2011. The
results of trenching are presented in the following chapter.

Geomorphological and Geoarchaeological Assessment
Steven W. Ahr

1. Introduction
This report documents the results of geomorphological and geoarchaeological investigations for
a proposed Texas Water Development Board (TWDB) waterline project, located in Somervell
County, Texas. The proposed waterline will cross portions of the Paluxy and Brazos Rivers in
the vicinity of Glen Rose, Texas, and could potentially impact cultural materials that may be
deeply buried within late Quaternary alluvial deposits. The majority of the pipeline will be
placed within a 4-ft (120 cm) deep open-cut trench. At the Paluxy and Brazos River crossings,
however, the pipeline will be bored to go well below the drainages, and impacts at the site of
each bore location would penetrate through the full extent of alluvial deposits.
An archaeological pedestrian survey was previously conducted along the overall proposed
waterline alignment by AR Consultants, Inc (this report). During the pedestrian survey, areas
exhibiting potential for deep Holocene deposits were identified for further geoarchaeological
investigations. When standard archaeological survey methodologies, as defined in Title 13, Part
II, Chapters 26.5(35) and 26.20(2) of the Texas Administrative Code, are found to be inadequate
to fully investigate the vertical depths of potentially deep archaeological deposits, a
geomorphological approach is warranted, particularly when dealing with deep construction
impacts. Given the potentially deep alluvial deposits at the proposed borehole locations along
the Paluxy and Brazos Rivers, a geomorphological and geoarchaeological assessment was
recommended. The results of this assessment are presented in this chapter.
The purpose of this geomorphic assessment is to provide a detailed stratigraphic and pedologic
framework for evaluating potential archeological sites within alluvial deposits along the Paluxy
and Brazos River crossings in the study area. The investigated areas were designated as the
Paluxy crossing, the Brazos central crossing, and the Brazos west crossing (Figure 26). The
objectives of these investigations are to: 1) construct a geomorphic map of the study area, 2)
conduct detailed field recording of soils and alluvial stratigraphic units, 3) reconstruct the
alluvial history of the study area through absolute and/or correlative age-dating, 4) develop a
model to predict the presence/absence of cultural materials, and 5) evaluate the geoarcheological
integrity potential for any sites identified during trenching.
2. Setting
The Paluxy River originates west of Glen Rose in Erath County and primarily drains Lower
Cretaceous Glen Rose and Twin Mountains Formation limestones (Bureau of Economic Geology
1988). The Paluxy River joins the Brazos River near the study area at the town of Glen Rose.
Pleistocene terraces (Qt), Holocene age terraces, and floodplain deposits are present within the
valleys and become more widely distributed as stream sinuosity increases near the mouth of the
Paluxy River.

Historic peak discharge stream data indicate that large floods occasionally occur within the
Brazos and Paluxy River drainage basins, but the upper terrace surfaces are rarely, if ever,
flooded. Such events appear to be limited to only a few instances when floodwaters topped the
T-1 terrace along the Brazos River (Figure 27). The upper T-2 Pleistocene terrace does not
appear to have ever been overtopped by floods in historic times. However, the lower elevation
floodplains are flooded regularly, indicating this surface is continually aggrading.

terraces above base flow. Data source: http://nwis.waterdata.usgs.gov.

The patterning of soils can be generally grouped according to the major geomorphic surfaces
within the study area (Table 3). Upland soils flanking the valleys are mainly within the TarrantBolar and Tarrant-Purves associations and consist of shallow loamy residuum weathered from
local underlying bedrock formations. Decordova loamy fine sand, 0-5% slopes, are widely
mapped on uplands and ancient high terraces. Soils developed on Pleistocene age surfaces are
characterized as Sunev clay loam, which is comprised of loamy and gravelly alluvium.
Holocene age terrace soils are mapped as Frio silty clay. These soils are described as
occasionally flooded and loamy alluvial soils, and occur along the southern floodplain margin of
the Paluxy River. Venus loam, 1-3% slopes, are soils that are primarily mapped along the inside
terrace margins of the Paluxy River. Paluxy very fine sandy loam, 1-3% slopes, are loamy
alluvial soils that occur on similar age terrace surfaces along the Brazos River. Yahola-Gaddy
complex soils, occasionally flooded, are loamy and calcareous alluvial soils that are found on the
active floodplains (T-0) of both the Brazos and Paluxy Rivers (NRCS 2011).

3. Methods
A geomorphic map of the study area was constructed from USGS topographic maps, aerial
photographs, Geologic Atlas of Texas sheets from the Bureau of Economic Geology, and United
States Department of Agriculture-Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS) soil data for
Hood and Somervell Counties, Texas. The primary purpose of a geomorphic map is to
differentiate the aerial extent of geomorphic surfaces (i.e., terraces, floodplains) in order to
facilitate geoarcheological interpretations and to guide field investigations, including backhoe
trench placement. The geomorphic map was further refined on the basis of field observations.

Backhoe trenches were excavated and described to characterize the alluvial stratigraphy and
pedology within the study area and to prospect for deeply buried cultural materials. A total of
eight backhoe trench (BHT) were excavated, with five trenches at the Paluxy River crossing, and
three trenches south of the Brazos River. In addition, a private road-cut profile adjacent to a
proposed borehole location on the north side of the Brazos River was inspected and recorded in
detail. All profiles were hand-cleared, and soil descriptions followed standard Natural Resources
Conservation Service (NRCS) standards (Schoenberger et al. 2002). Soil stratigraphic
descriptions included texture, structure, consistence, color, coarse fragments, redoximorphic
features, and other pedologic features. Each profile was photographed, and trenches were
backfilled after field descriptions were completed.
4. Alluvial Stratigraphy
4.1

Paluxy Crossing

Figures 28 and 29 illustrate the major Quaternary-age landforms within the Paluxy River
crossing. These include one Pleistocene terrace (T-2), one Holocene age terrace (T-1), and
modern floodplain (T-0). Alluvial stratigraphic units associated with these alluvial landforms
include Unit 1 alluvium beneath T-2, Unit 2, Unit 3, and Unit 3A alluvium beneath T-1, and Unit
4 alluvium beneath T-0. Unit 5 colluvium was identified and described on the north side of the
River within BHT-5.
Terrace 2 (T-2)
The T-2 terrace is the oldest alluvial deposit within the Paluxy River crossing. The narrow
terrace surface is at an elevation of 620 ft., approximately 15 m above the modern Paluxy River
channel. This terrace is represented on the Dallas Sheet of the Geologic Atlas of Texas as a
Pleistocene fluvial terrace deposit (Qt), which contain gravel, sand, silt, and clay (Bureau of
Economic Geology 1988). No paired T-2 terrace is present at the north side of the Paluxy River
within the corridor. However, in places upstream this terrace is mapped on both sides of the
Paluxy River, indicating an ancient valley width of at least 1.7 km. The T-2 terrace fill
(designated as Unit 1 for the current study) rests unconformably upon Lower Cretaceous Glen
Rose limestone (Bureau of Economic Geology 1988). Small and medium size gravels from the
T-2 terrace were encountered at 124 cm below surface in BHT 1, beneath on-lapped fine-grained
Holocene-age T-1 terrace deposits (Figure 30). The total thickness of the T-2 terrace fill was not
determined, although based on topographic and geologic maps it could be as much as 15 m thick.
The lower deposits likely consist of laterally-accreted channel gravel facies that fine upward to
vertically-accreted gravelly sand, silt, and loam facies. Given the Pleistocene age of the T-2
terrace, the geoarcheological potential for buried archeological deposits within the terrace fill is
considered low. However, portions of this terrace that are buried beneath Holocene deposits
could potentially contain buried/intact archeological materials. None were found at this contact,
however, in BHT-1.

Terrace 1 (T-1)
The T-1 terrace is a fairly broad alluvial terrace that partially overlaps the T-2 terrace, but
primarily rests unconformably upon Glen Rose limestone. The T-1 terrace tread surface is at an
elevation of 600 ft. and lies approximately 6 m below the T-2 surface and 9 m above the modern
Paluxy River channel. This terrace is shown on Geologic Atlas of Texas maps as undifferentiated
Holocene age alluvium (Qal). Four backhoe trenches (BHTs 1-4) were excavated within the
terrace. BHTs 1 and 2 were excavated at the southernmost extent of the T-1 terrace, while BHT 3
was excavated at the center point of the terrace, and BHT 4 was placed at the site of the proposed
borehole location.

Backhoe trenches revealed three distinct alluvial stratigraphic units below the T-1 terrace,
designated Units 1-3. An additional alluvial stratigraphic unit, Unit 3A, was not directly
observed in backhoe trenches in the field, but was identified on the basis of soil maps and
regional alluvial correlations.
Unit 1 was encountered at the bottom of BHT-1, beneath 124 cm of T-1 terrace fill. This unit
consists of small and medium size gravels associated with a truncated portion of the T-2
Pleistocene terrace edge. This T-2 terrace is described in the previous section.
Unit 2 is the lowermost unit within the T-1 terrace fill and was encountered in BHTs 3 and 4.
The top of this unit lies at 200 cm below the terrace surface and consists of fine-grained
vertically accreted overbank silt loam and silty clay loam. A buried soil caps Unit 2 and exhibits
an A-Bk horizons sequence (Figure 31). The soil exhibits weak fine subangular blocky ped
structure, with less than 1% coarse fragments and few calcium carbonate filaments. Soil colors
range from dark yellowish brown (10YR 3/6) in the A horizon, gradually transitioning to
yellowish brown (10YR 5/8) in the Bw horizon. The total thickness of Unit 2 could not be
determined from the limited reach of the backhoe. However, it is possible that it extends to basal
bedrock as deep as 9 m below the current ground surface. BHTs 3 and 4 yielded small fragments
of burned limestone, mussel shell fragments, and a lithic flake from the top of the buried soil
(Figure 32). The site was assigned the trinomial 41SV172. These cultural deposits are clearly
associated with the upper portion of the buried A horizon and do not appear to extend much
deeper. The aerial extent of the site is currently defined by BHTs 3 and 4, which are spaced 30
meters apart. None of the artifacts were collected.
Unit 3 overlies Unit 2 and was encountered in BHTs 1-4. This unit ranges from 124 cm thick at
the southern T-1 terrace margin where it on-laps onto the adjacent Pleistocene terrace, and up to
200 cm thick in the central and proximal portions of the T-1 terrace. Unit 3 is comprised of silt
loam and silty clay loam with a moderately expressed floodplain soil capping the surface. This
soil exhibits an Ap-A-Bk1-Bk2-Bk3-BC horizon sequence to a maximum recorded thickness of
200 cm. The soil exhibits weak fine to moderate fine and medium subangular blocky structure in
the upper horizons, transitioning to prismatic ped structure in the lowermost horizons. Soil colors
in the A horizon are dark brown (10YR 3/3), transitioning to dark yellowish brown (10YR 3/6)
in the upper Bk horizons, and strong brown (7.5YR 5/6) in the lower Bk horizon. The soil is
highly calcareous, with 1-5% fine calcium carbonate filaments. No archaeological materials were
identified within Unit 3 in any of the trenches.
Unit 3A occurs along the inner T-1 terrace margin and was identified on the basis of soil maps
and regional correlations (Nordt 2004). Deposition of Unit 3A is likely to have occurred after a
period of lateral channel erosion and bedrock incision following construction of the main part of
the T-1 terrace, but prior construction of the modern floodplain. Unit 3A is located outside of the
area of proposed impacts and would not be disturbed by the project. Thus, no backhoe trenches
were excavated to investigate this unit.

Floodplain (T-0)
The modern floodplain (T-0) in the study area consists of a narrow wedge of recent alluvium
designated as Unit 4 and occurs at an elevation of 587 ft. This unit rests unconformably on the
bedrock floor approximately 4 m below the T-1 terrace, and approximately 5 m above the
modern Paluxy River channel. Although the borehole will bypass these deposits and they will
not be impacted, they were briefly examined for archaeological potential. No stratigraphic,
pedologic or lithologic breaks were observed in Unit 4, which contains common rounded channel
gravels at the base that fine upward to silt loam and silty clay loam (Figure 33). Clearly defined
primary bedding could be observed throughout the unit, indicating a recent age in which
pedogenesis has not completely obscured these depositional sequences.

North colluvial slope
A single backhoe trench (BHT-5) was placed at the proposed borehole extraction location on the
north side of the Paluxy River. The trench revealed a colluvial deposit (designated as Unit 5)
approximately 130 cm thick, resting unconformably over Glen Rose bedrock. The soil exhibits
an Ap-Bk1-Bk2-Bk3-BkC-R horizon sequence and consists of silt loam and silty clay loam. Soil
structure is weak fine subangular blocky structure in the upper Bk horizon, which transitions to
strong medium angular blocky structure in the Bk3 horizon (Figure 34). Faint laminations <1mm
thick were observed within the BkC horizon from 112-130 cm. Coarse fragments, including
pebbles and detrital calcium carbonate nodules, occur throughout the soil column, ranging from
0.5 to 10 cm in diameter. In situ pedogenic carbonate development consists of 2-5% fine
filaments in the upper horizons, with carbonate soft masses in the lower horizons. No
archaeological materials were identified in this trench.

Brazos Central Crossing

Figure 35 illustrates the major Quaternary-age landforms within the central Brazos River
crossing area, which include a Pleistocene terrace (T-2), a Holocene age terrace (T-1), and
modern floodplain (T-0). These surfaces correlate well with those described previously for the
Paluxy River crossing. Four alluvial stratigraphic units are associated with these alluvial
landforms and include Unit 1 alluvium beneath T-2, Unit 2 and Unit 3/3A alluvium beneath T-1,
and Unit 4 alluvium beneath T-0. A 15-ft deep vertical road cut exposure is present at the
proposed borehole location on the north bank of the Brazos River and was also investigated.
Terrace 2 (T-2)
The T-2 terrace surface is at an elevation of 600 ft. and is approximately 13 m above the modern
Brazos River channel. The terrace begins approximately 300 m south of the Brazos River and,
based on similar age, height, and lithology, correlates with the T-2 terrace described at the
Paluxy River. The T-2 terrace fill at the Brazos River crossing (designated as Unit 1) rests
unconformably upon Glen Rose limestone (Bureau of Economic Geology 1988), and no paired
T-2 terrace is present at the north side of the Brazos River within the corridor. The total thickness
of the T-2 terrace fill above bedrock was not determined, although based on topographic and
geologic maps it could be as much as 18 m thick. The lower deposits likely consist of laterally
accreted channel gravel facies that grade upward to vertically-accreted gravelly sand, silt, and
loam facies. No trenches were excavated within the T-2 terrace. However, given the Pleistocene
age, the geoarcheological potential for buried archeological deposits within the terrace fill is
considered low.
Terrace 1 (T-1)
The T-1 terrace surface south of the central Brazos River crossing is at approximately 590 ft.
elevation and rests unconformably on Glen Rose bedrock. The terrace lies approximately 3 m
below the T-2 surface and 9 m above the modern Brazos River channel. As such it correlates to
the T-1 terrace previously described for the Paluxy River crossing. Three backhoe trenches
(BHTs 6-8) were excavated within the T-1 terrace deposits, which were placed between the T-2
terrace margin and the proposed borehole location. BHT 8 was placed at the site of the proposed
borehole location at the northern end of the terrace. Backhoe trenches revealed two distinct
alluvial stratigraphic units (Units 2 and 3) below the T-1 terrace (Figure 36).
Unit 2 is the lowermost unit within the T-1 terrace fill and was encountered in each of the
backhoe trenches, at depths ranging from 64-130 cmbs. This unit consists of fine-grained
vertically accreted overbank silt loam and silty clay loam. A buried soil caps Unit 2 and exhibits
an A-Bw-C horizons sequence and was identified in each of the backhoe trenches. The soil
capping Unit 2 exhibits moderate medium subangular blocky ped structure in the A horizon,
grading down to weak fine granular and subangular blocky structure in the lower horizons
(Figure 37). No secondary pedogenic carbonates (e.g., filaments, nodules, soft masses) were
observed within these soil horizons, and indicate that the soil was either buried shortly after a
brief episode of pedogenesis, or the alluvial parent materials were significantly non-calcareous.
At the borehole location within BHT-8, coarse massive sand containing approximately 2%
pebbles and gravels was encountered from 220-340 cmbs, and this is consistent with lower basal

terrace deposits. These deposits were found within the maximum reach of the backhoe, and it is
expected that increasingly greater amounts of bed load channel gravels would be encountered
just below these sands. No cultural materials were identified in any of the backhoe trenches or in
association with the buried soil.

Unit 3 overlies Unit 2 and was encountered in each of the excavated trenches. Thickness of this
unit ranges from 64-130 cm as it thins away from the Brazos channel and ultimately on-laps onto
the T-2 Pleistocene terrace margin to the south. Unit 3 is comprised of silt loam and silty clay
loam with a moderately expressed floodplain soil capping the surface of the terrace. This soil
exhibits an Ap-Bw-C horizon sequence and exhibits weak to moderate medium subangular
blocky structure in the uppermost horizons, transitioning to weak fine subangular blocky to
massive in the lowermost horizons. Soil colors in the A horizon are yellowish brown (10YR 4/6),
transitioning to dark yellowish red (5YR 4/6) in the upper Bw horizons, and reddish yellow
(5YR 6/8) in the C horizons. Faintly laminated primary bedding structures are observable in
these horizons. No secondary pedogenic carbonates (e.g., filaments, nodules, soft masses) were
noted. No archaeological materials were identified within Unit 3 in any of the trenches.

Floodplain (T-0)
The modern floodplain (T-0) consists of a narrow wedge of recent alluvium resting
unconformably on the bedrock floor on both sides of the Brazos River channel, approximately
4.5 m below the T-1 terrace. The floodplain surface occurs at an elevation of 575 ft.,
approximately 4 m above the modern Brazos River channel. The proposed borehole will bypass
these deposits and they will not be impacted; no investigations were carried out. However, based
on the relative position of this geomorphic surface and height above the river channel, this
surface is correlative to the Paluxy T-0 floodplain, which is underlain by a single alluvial unit
(Unit 4) with no stratigraphic, pedologic or lithologic breaks. This unit contains common
rounded channel gravels at the base that fine upward to silt loam and silty clay loam near the
surface of the unit.
North Upland Edge
The proposed borehole location on the north bank of the Brazos River crossing is mapped as
undivided Holocene age colluvium and alluvial fan deposits (Qu) (Bureau of Economic Geology
1988). This area is located within an active quarry. An approximately 15-ft deep vertical road cut
into these deposits has been created at the location of the proposed borehole (Figure 38). This
vertical road cut was closely inspected, and a single representative profile was described
following the same procedures used for the backhoe trenching. From the top of the ground
surface, the profile measures 4 m in depth. A single soil has developed from this surface, and
exhibits an A-E1-E2-Bt1-Bt2 horizon sequence with a well-developed diagnostic subsurface
argillic horizon extending down to at least the lower 2 m of the soil column (Figure 39). The
lower 1 m was covered by slump and could not be observed. Strong textural contrasts between
upper and lower sola observed in this soil are common to Alfisols whereby weathering and
translocation of phyllosilicate clays from the A and E horizons in the upper profile contributes to
the Bt horizons in the lower profile. Such processes can take upwards of tens of thousands of
years (Hallmark and Franzmeier 1999; Soil Survey Staff 2010). In some places, nearly 1-cm
thick clay lamellae were observed in the lower E horizon, attesting to the continued formation
and upbuilding of the Bt horizons. Prehistoric materials were observed throughout the upper
sandy A and E horizons along the length of this road cut, and are reported in the main body of
the survey report. Based on topographic position and genetic history, these soils greatly predate
the archaeology of the region. Consequently, any artifact burial in the sandy A and E horizons
has resulted from intensive bioturbation and artifact reworking down the profile. Thus, little
potential exists for intact archaeological deposits.
4.3

Brazos West Crossing

Two major Quaternary geomorphic landforms are present within the Brazos River crossing at the
west end of the study area and include a Pleistocene terrace (T-2) that rests 15 to 20 m above the
modern channel, and the modern floodplain (T-0), which rises approximately 6 m above the
modern channel (Figure 40). Correlation of these units with those identified at the Paluxy
crossing and the Brazos central crossing indicate that the T-2 terrace is underlain by Unit 1
deposits (Pleistocene age), and the T-0 floodplain is underlain by Unit 4 deposits (modern).
These areas were not investigated with backhoe trenches during the current study since the

proposed borehole location within the Unit 4 deposits is located within previously disturbed
right-of-way. These disturbances include extensive earthmoving activities and clearing, and
emplacement of utilities (Figure 41). Thus, the potential for intact cultural materials is
considered low.

5. Quaternary alluvial history
No radiocarbon ages were obtained for this project. However, a generalized model of
Quaternary landscape evolution can be constructed based on our general understanding of
regional geology and lithology of Quaternary formations in the study area, and regional
correlations of terrace heights above the modern Paluxy and Brazos River channels.
During the Pleistocene, large gravel-dominated streams were incising the surrounding
Cretaceous bedrock formations and began to establish the modern alluvial valley
networks. Gravelly terrace deposits were left behind on higher elevation landforms as
streams underwent down cutting at the end of the Pleistocene, possibly in response to
climate change and sediment supply. These deposits comprise the T-2 terraces observed
in each study area location, and are situated 13-18 m above the modern channels. These
terraces correlate well with the T-2 terraces described along Cowhouse Creek at Ft. Hood
in central Texas, which occur 16-18 m above the channel and began to aggrade around
15,270 14C yr B.P. (Nordt 2004).
After this time, a period of down cutting and bedrock incision occurred, and was
followed by construction of the T-1 terrace and deposition of Unit 2 in the study area.
The lowermost section of Unit 2 could not be observed due to limitations in the reach of
the backhoe. However, based on characteristics common to central Texas stream
morphology and alluvial valley architecture, the lower reaches of the T-1 terrace fill are
______________________________________________________________________________________

SOMERVELL COUNTY WATER DISTRICT PIPELINE ARCHAEOLOGICAL SURVEY

56

likely dominated by coarse-grained gravelly channel, and point bar facies. As such, Unit
2 deposits in the study area would correlate to the Georgetown alluvium identified in
central Texas (Nordt 2004), which began to aggrade around 11,000 yr. B.P.
Following deposition of Unit 2, a brief period of landscape stability and soil formation
ensued at both the Paluxy and Brazos River locations. This period of floodplain stability
and soil formation is reported elsewhere in south, central, and east-central Texas (Mandel
et al. 2007; Nordt 1994; Waters and Nordt 1995). At the Paluxy River crossing, the
surface of this soil was briefly utilized by prehistoric populations, as evidenced by small
amounts of burned limestone FCR, mussel shell fragments, and a lithic flake identified in
BHTs 3 and 4. The buried soil identified in the project area appears to correlate with the
Royalty paleosol that formed on top of the Georgetown alluvium at Ft. Hood. Both soils
exhibit well-structured Bk horizons and clay loam textures, contain fine filaments of
secondary pedogenic carbonates, and lack significant iron redoximorphic features. If this
correlation holds, the buried soil in the study area would have formed over the interval
from around 8830 to 6850 14C yr B.P.
Following a period of soil formation, construction of the T-1 terrace resumed and Unit 3
was deposited as fine-grained overbank vertical accretion sediments, likely in response to
increased flood stage and sediment supply. The lowermost horizons of Unit 3 retain some
of these primary bedding structures associated with this resumed deposition. Eventually
the build-up of Unit 3 terminated at the current T-1 terrace surface, and the surface soil
began to form. Based on regional correlations, the construction of the T-1 terrace outside
the modern meander belt would have ended approximately around 5000 yr. B.P.
Subsequent channel erosion occurred, followed by renewed deposition on the inner
margins of the T-1 terrace, resulting in Unit 3A. This unit was not observed through
backhoe trenches, but is based on current channel morphology and regional correlation,
and would have occurred between approximately 4170 and 600 14C yr B.P. (Nordt 2004).
Based on current project designs, these inner margin deposits (Unit 3A) along the T-1
terrace would not be impacted by the boring operations.
Following deposition of Unit 3A, another period of channel erosion occurred, followed
by deposition of the T-0 floodplain (Unit 4) in the study area. This unit likely aggraded
within the last 400 years (Nordt 2004), and the young age is supported by field
observations of well-preserved primary bedding structures.

6. Geoarchaeological Interpretations
Since radiocarbon ages were unavailable to constrain the ages of each alluvial unit, ages
were based on relative positions of each landform, terrace heights, the degree of soil
development, and regional correlations with published alluvial chronologies. These age
estimates form the basis for geoarcheological interpretations, which are summarized in
Table 4.

The T-2 terrace was constructed during the Pleistocene and likely has undergone intense
pedogenic weathering. Archeological materials representing all cultural periods could be
present in mixed context on any exposed surface of these terraces; no prehistoric artifacts
are likely to be deeply buried and vertically separated since historic stream discharge data
indicate little chance that this surface was ever inundated by flood waters. It is possible
that Paleoindian through Middle Archaic deposits could be found resting on eroded
portions of the T-2 terrace surface that are currently buried beneath the Unit 3 fill.
However, none were found during backhoe trenching of BHT-1.
The T-1 terrace occurs 9 m above the modern channel. Based on correlation the T-1
terrace deposits outside the modern meander belt (Units 2 and 3) likely date from 11,0005,000 yr. B.P., and as such, could contain stratified Paleoindian through Middle Archaic
cultural materials. Later prehistoric materials would be found at or near the surface.
Sediments deposited along the inside terrace margin (Unit 3A) likely aggraded from
4170-600 yr. B.P. and could contain cultural materials representing the Middle Archaic
through the early part of the Late Prehistoric Periods. Unit 3A is located on the inside
terrace margin and would not be impacted by the proposed project.
The T-0 floodplain, represented by Unit 4, dates to within the last 400 years and has
potential to contain Late Prehistoric Toyah cultural materials. This unit is located on the
inside channel margins and would not be impacted by the proposed project.

7. Summary and Recommendations
Geomorphological and geoarcheological investigations revealed three primary
geomorphic landforms in the study area. These include one Pleistocene terrace (T-2), one
Holocene terrace (T-1), and one Holocene floodplain (T-0). Alluvial stratigraphic units
(Units 1-4) of various ages are associated with these landforms and exhibit varying
potential to contain cultural components of varying ages (see Table 2).
At the Paluxy River a buried soil with associated artifacts was found capping Unit 2, at a
depth of 2 m below the T-1 terrace surface. This buried soil appears to correlate with the
Royalty paleosol reported in central Texas (Nordt 2004). As such, Paleoindian through
Early Archaic materials could be present throughout Unit 2. The cultural materials
identified in the buried soil along the Paluxy River during investigations at 41SV172 are
likely representative of an Early Archaic occupation. Given the ideal geologic context of
this site, which appears to be well-preserved in fine-grained overbank alluvium, site
41SV172 could potentially yield information important to the prehistory of the area. If
the site cannot be avoided during construction, additional site testing at 41SV172 may be
needed to further assess its eligibility and research potential. However, according to
revised construction plans, the site will be avoided by construction of a mud pit that is
approximately five feet deep and covers an area 13’ by 10’, and which will effectively
limit the depth of impact to five feet.
No cultural materials were identified within Unit 3 in any of the backhoe trenches,
including the proposed borehole location on the Paluxy River. As such, no further
investigations for Unit 3 are recommended.

Colluvial deposits on the north side of the Paluxy River crossing at a proposed borehole
location were investigated with a single backhoe trench (BHT 5). These deposits
shallowly overlie Glen Rose bedrock, which was found 130 cm below the surface. No
cultural materials were identified at this location. No additional investigations are
warranted in this area.
Backhoe trenches within the T-1 terrace on the south side of the central Brazos crossing
failed to result in the identification of cultural materials. Deep trenching at the proposed
borehole location appears to have penetrated most of the entire sequence of Holocene T-1
terrace deposits, as evidence by the occurrence of coarse gravelly sand at the base of the
trench. As such, little likelihood exists for any preserved archeological deposits below
these depths. No additional investigations are warranted in this area.
The north side of the Brazos River crossing is situated within an active quarry, and a 15ft. deep road cut has been excavated across the proposed borehole location. Sandy soils
overlie a clay-rich argillic horizon. Given the time-dependence of well expressed argillic
horizon formation in Ustic soil moisture regimes, which can take tens of thousands of
years, the age of the soil likely pre-dates human occupation of North America. The scant
artifacts observed eroding from these sand horizons have likely been reworked down the
profile via bioturbation, and do not likely retain any spatial or vertical integrity.
Quarrying and the road-cut have removed any artifact bearing deposits at the proposed
borehole location. No additional investigations are warranted in this area.
At the west crossing of the Brazos River, the two Quaternary-age geomorphic surfaces
include a terrace (T-2) underlain by Unit 1 deposits of Pleistocene age, and the modern
floodplain (T-0), which is underlain by Unit 4 deposits of recent age. The proposed
borehole location is with previously disturbed ROW. Thus, the potential for intact
cultural materials is limited. No additional investigations are warranted in this area.

Conclusions
Archaeological survey of the twelve pipeline routes described above resulted in the
recording of two historic and two prehistoric archaeological sites and the description of a
vernacular gas station/speakeasy commercial structure into which numerous pieces of
petrified wood have been incorporated. Additionally, geoarchaeological investigation
resulted in the discovery of a prehistoric site deposit associated with a paleosol that is
buried under the terrace surface almost two meters.
No evidence of prehistoric occupation was found in the uplands that surround the valleys
of the Brazos River and Paluxy River but this confirms the results of surveys throughout
parts of the county except for surveys in the uplands along Squaw Creek. Squaw Creek is
the only major drainage located in the vicinity of the study area and it may have been a
perennial stream in the prehistoric past before the surface was impacted by brush
clearing, cattle grazing, and well drilling. At present it is mapped as an intermittent
tributary by the Soil Conservation Service and the US Geological Survey. However,
prehistoric sites, such as the Hopewell School site, are located on elevations adjacent to
the creek channel and on the eroded surface of the limestone-based upland. Limestonebased uplands occur throughout the county but the results of this survey as well as
previous surveys by Brazos Valley Associates and others have found few prehistoric
campsites in the uplands. In part this may be a reflection of the fact that lag gravels
containing knappable chert are not present in the Somervell County uplands unlike the
nearby uplands of Hood County where they are apparently present near the Zweifel and
Pirate sites on the east side of the Brazos. Consequently it would appear that the functions
of sites in the uplands surrounding Squaw Creek are different than the upland sites
recorded on the bluffs in neighboring Hood County. Certainly, water was not a readily
available resource in most of the uplands in this region, except where permanent springs
were present at the upper ends of streams like Squaw Creek.
In contrast, prehistoric site deposits were found to be present on the plowed surface of
Turner Bend east of Glen Rose as well as buried in the floodplain sediments of the
Paluxy. While we do not know the age or function of either site based on a detailed
analysis of the artifact assemblages, we can conclude that both sites are campsites that
were occupied repeatedly for a considerable amount of time since the Turner Bend site
covers a significant area and the Paluxy River site is associated with a stable surface that
was exposed for sufficient period to allow for the development of a paleosol. The Turner
Bend site setting is reminiscent of the Lowden site at Lake Granbury which was
determined to have been a base camp that was repeatedly occupied for hundreds of years
and possibly longer. This conclusion is based on the large size of the site and the report
that many projectile points have been collected over the years by the landowner. The
artifact assemblage from the Paluxy River site is significantly smaller and could compare
favorably to the Aiken site at Lake Granbury which was determined to be a temporary
camp which also was buried and on a stable ground surface and was occupied about two
thousand years ago. Additional buried prehistoric sites are likely to be countered in the
river floodplains based on the results of testing conducted by Prewitt and Associates, Inc.

(Griffith and Boyd 2006; Gibbs 2004; Griffith 2004) and also documented by Charles
Frederick (2010) for the Somervell County Water District.
Historic sites were found in both the upland and on the river terraces. In all three cases,
historic buildings/houses were in settings along rural roads where flooding was not a
major problem although it could have been a rare occurrence at the two houses that were
represented primarily by root cellars. The Brazos River floodplain in the vicinity of site
41SV173 could have occasionally been flooded and the root cellar at site 41SV174 could
have been flooded by rainwater runoff from upslope after major rain events. In both
cases, both houses were probably elevated on piers and beams or on cement footings. The
Sycamore Grove petrified wood gas station/speakeasy site is situated at the toe of the
upland where flooding was probably not an issue and also where ground insulation
provided by a concrete slab was sufficient for a commercial structure. As field personnel
did not have access to the property on which the Sycamore Grove gas station was located,
and because it is not within the right of way of the proposed pipeline, it was no recorded
as a site, but has been generally described in this report.

RECOMMENDATIONS
Based upon the results of this archaeological survey, AR Consultants, Inc. recommends
that further cultural resource investigations within the pipeline right-of-way are
unwarranted. However, this recommendation is contingent on the pipeline route’s
avoidance of the sites recorded during the survey. A table below lists these sites, their
potential for inclusion on the NRHP, and how they will be avoided by the proposed
pipeline route.

AR Consultants, Inc. requests that the Texas Historical Commission agree with the
findings of this report. Furthermore, we recommend that if unknown buried cultural
materials are discovered during construction along the pipeline routes, work should stop
in that area immediately and the Archeology Division of the Texas Historical
Commission should be notified. Work should not continue until any necessary
investigations have been carried out after consultation with the THC.
