Tommy Garrison Will Present
November Program
Tommy Garrison from Iraan Archeological Society will present a slide
program on an excavation he did some 30
years ago on three shelters on a drainage
of Live Oak Creek in far western Crockett
County. The site, 41CX914, was partially
excavated in a layered trench. Cultural artifacts date the use of the shelters from
early through late archaic. Tommy will
bring and exhibit many of the artifacts recovered and recorded from the excavations.
Tommy was born and raised in
Iraan. He graduated from Iraan High
School and attended Angelo State in San
Angelo. Later, he served four years in the
U. S. Air Force. After that, he entered the
goat dairy business, and raised purebred
Swiss Oberhasli goats, which are an endangered species. He still has some Oberhasli goats, along with cows, on his ranch
near Midkiff, Texas.

President’s Message
Hello everyone! An organization is
only as good as the sum of it's parts. I think
the CVAS has great parts and therefore is a
great society.
Thanks to all of you who help each
month to set the program room up and tear
it down again. Thanks to all of you who
help in every way for each meeting.
The Fair was a great success this
year and it's all because of each of you
members, and the direction of Larry.
We have an exciting year coming up
in 2009 starting in Jan. in Bronte at the
Clark place. Then again at Ft. Chadbourne
to dig. Then I'm sure there will be field
trips as well. Watch the web site and newsletter for updates.
This month we will be presented
with a slate of proposed officers to serve in
2009. Then we will vote at the Christmas
Party Dec 11th, 2009. New officers will be
installed in January. See you the 20th.

Field Trip Saturday, 15th
The Iraan Archeological Society is
conducting a field trip Sat. Nov. 15th, and
the CVAS is invited to participate. This will
be to the Earnest Woodward Ranch which is
about 5 miles southwest of Girvin. Rock
shelters, middens, and rock art sites previously reported by IAS members in the 1970's
and also some recently discovered archeological sites discovered by Mr. Woodward
will be visited.
You will need to bring a sack
lunch, drinking water, wear stout walking
shoes, protective clothing, hat and sunscreen. Also we will be recording the sites
with GPS instruments so bring yours if you
have one. This trip should have something
for every club member.
Meet at the Wal-Mart (Sherwood Way

need to be at Girvin, TX (130 mi) by 9:30 to

IN 2009

Archaeological Legacy Institute
Friends and colleagues: Improved
technology increasingly is revealing unimagined facts about the impressive accomplishments of ancient societies. To
see a fascinating account of modern imaging techniques uncovering the complexities of an ancient machine, watch
The Antikythera Mechanism: Decoding an
Ancient Greek Mystery, the latest video
feature on our nonprofit streaming-media
Web site, The Archaeology Channel
(http://www.archaeologychannel.org).
In 1901, sponge divers found an extraordinary mechanism on the sea bottom
near the island of Antikythera. It astonished the whole international community,
stumping scientists for decades. Was it
an astrolabe, an astronomical clock, or
something else? More recent research is
revealing its secrets. Dating from around
the 1st century B.C., it is the most sophisticated mechanism known from the ancient world. The Antikythera Mechanism
operated as a complex mechanical
"computer" to track the cycles of the Solar
System.
This and other programs are available on TAC for your use and enjoyment. We urge you to support this public
service by participating in our Membership
(http://www.archaeologychannel.org/

help can we continue and enhance our
nonprofit public-education and visitorsupported programming.
