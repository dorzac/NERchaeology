Dear Dr. Herrington:
In response to Executive Order 12348, the Fort Worth District has designated
2,569 acres at 15 of our Operating Projects as surplus land. In order to
comply with Section 106 of the National Historic Preservation Act, as amended,
we will be forwarding an archeological report on the surplus land at each
project for your review and comment.
Scheduling constraints make it necessary to receive your comments as soon as
possible, and we have therefore inclosed two forms for your signature (Incl 1).
Please retain one copy for your records and return the other to our office.
The letter report on Hords Creek Lake is inclosed (Incl 2) for your review. If
possible we would appreciate your-comments prior to 29 November 1982. Thank you
for your cooperation.
Sincerely, ­

HAHKINS, JR.

DEFINITION OF THE STUDY AREA
In accordance with Executive Order 12348, lands on civil works projects of the
Army Corps of Engineers (COE) were proposed as surplus. These lands are to
be disposed of, on a staggered basis, over the next six months.

U.S~

In the Fort Worth District, COE, 2,569 acres in 97 parcels at 15 projects is
proposed as surplus. The Real Estate Division of the Fort Worth District
designated these areas on the appropriate tract maps. These maps were then
provided to the Permits Section, Operations Division where the areas were
delineated on the USGS quad sheets. Both sets of maps were used in the field,
and were cross-checked with aerial photographs, project personnel and project
maps.
COE surplus holdings at Hords Creek Lake totaled approximately 29 acres divided
into 3 parcels. These areas are designated by parcel on both the real estate
tract maps and USGS quad sheets which are attached.

:..

RESEARCH DESIGN
Section 106, of the National Historic Preservation Act as amended, compliance
will be coordinated on the surplus land by the COE. The proposed surplus lands
identified under Executive Order 12348 will be sold by the General Service
Administration. Current land use is for approved, authorized project purposes
of flood control, water supply, and recreation. However, due to location, .
configuration and other factors, it was determined that these lands could be
released without adversely affecting project operations. The proposed surplus
lands were identified after an evaluation which determined that; they were not
designated park areas, were uneconomic remanent, noncontiguous, undeveloped, and
unneeded peripheral lands.
At Hords Creek Lake, flowage easement may be retained on some of the parcels, so
permanent structures will not be erected, and other pertinent restrictions on
development will be imposed on these parcels. The archeological survey was
conducted to develop the necessary compliance information.
The site files at the Texas Archeological Research Laboratory (TARL) and the
Texas Historical Commission (THC) were checked for information on previous work,
and known archeological sites in the designated parcels. The current, updated
version of the National Register of Historic Places (NR) was examined to
determine whether, or not listed or eligible properties occurred in the designated
parcels. Published and unpublished literature was reviewed for related
information.
The parcels were examined by a pedestrian survey. The locational information
provided and the existing boundary fences clearly delineated parcel boundaries.
Transects with a 30 meter spacing were walked in a zigzag pattern, at 20
meter intervals, or where appropriate, a shovel was utilized to examine the
subsurface. In instances where erosional features, sloughs, roads, or a lack
of vegetation afforded be~ter visibility those areas were thoroughly examined.
In those instances where an archeological site was located, or relocated, the
area was photographed, features recorded and mapped, and shovel testing was
conducted to determine the nature and extent of any subsurface features, or
deposits.

RESULTS OF HORDS CREEK
Three parcels of surplus lands totaling 29 acres were examined for prehistoric
and historic resources. One parcel HC-l was found to have intact prehistoric
remains, whereas parcels HC-9 and HC-13 were found to contain no significant
cultural materials.
HC-13 was a narrow, five acre track bordered by private land on three sides.
A rocky drainage crossed its north edge, though the area was generally flat.
Thick grass coves and oak stands - some of possible great age - covered the
remainder of the parcel. An historic dump ran basically along the north-south
fenceline on the western portion of the parcel. Glass, metal, car parts, and a
1963 Texas license plate were strewn for over 200 meters along the fence. This
dump was not deemed historically significant and was not recorded.
Parcel HC-9 was a steep portion of a large hill. Greenbriars and oaks made
portions of the understory impenetrable. Little soil formation had occurred in
this area, being mostly a humus layer overlying limestone. No historic or
prehistoric remains were encountered.
Parcel HC-l was bisected by Hords Creek in its northern half and rocky limestone
hills on the extreme north and south ends. Vegetation varied widely on the
parcel from sparse oaks, tasajillo, prickly pear, and some grasses on the hills
to a thick mesquite, prickly pear and grass floodplain. The riparian area of
Hords Creek was dominated by large oaks and greenbriars. A light scatter of
prehistoric debris - burned rocks and chert debitage - was found scattered
throughout the parcel. Agriculture had badly disturbed the material found on
the floodplain. The north banks of Hords Creek was found to have an intact
prehistoric site, 41CN183. Commonly termed a "Burned Rock Midden", it is a
roughly oval pile of fire-fractured limestone and chert debitage. More burned
rocks extended to the east and west of the midden and were considered to be part
of the site. The midden has the unusual feature of, apparently, being intact.
Artifact hunters have not damaged the site and erosion has only damaged a small
portion of the entire site area. Thick grasses seem to have anchored the site
as well as providing enough cover to discourage collectors. Some chert debitage
was strewn across the midden, along with a hammerstone, several biface
fragments, and some burned clay and charcoal. The single artifact collected was
a proximal half of a thin biface.
On the basis of the pedestrian survey, 41CN183 was considered to have intact
cultural deposits which could yield significant information on the prehistoric
past. 41CN183 is not a unique site type, however its relatively pristine
condition makes it unusual in research potential. The site is considered
potentially eligible for the NR. The proposed surplus land parcel has been
altered so that the COE will be offering a parcel whose northern boundary will
be 150 feet south of the southern boundary of Hord's Creek. The southern site
boundary of 41CN183 is the northern bank of Hords Creek. This alteration will
leave an ample buffer between the surplus land and 41CN183. For these reasons,
the proposed surplus land parcels, as amended will have no effect on any
properties eligible for the NR. It is recommended that the surplus land action
proceed.
