Dedication

This work is dedicated to those who have shaped my intellectual development and to
those who supported me through the process of researching the Arenosa Shelter faunal
materials. First must come my parents, Kenneth C. Jurgens (deceased) and Evalyn K.
Jurgens, who gave me examples for hard work, lifetime learning, and appreciation of the
bounty of the natural environment in Texas. Jean Richmond (deceased), my junior high
science teacher, provided a strong start to a broad approach to the study of biology and
archaeology. Next, my undergraduate advisor in archeological studies at the University
of Texas at Austin, E. Mott Davis (deceased), used the Arenosa Shelter excavations as an
icon for his freshman introductory archaeology classes. He put the vision of the site as
the uncut crown jewel of Lower Pecos archaeology into our thinking. In my case, the
vision remained and colored my research interests for the past 30 years. Mott also
encouraged me to believe in myself, to return to academia to pursue my doctorate a
decade after completing my M.A., and to enjoy life and family. Samuel Wilson, my
doctoral supervisor, has encouraged me, guided me, and amazed me with the breadth of
his knowledge throughout this process. He also showed me how to balance work, family,
marriage, academic pursuits, and life while remaining a decent person. For Ernest
Lundelius (retired director of the Texas Memorial Museum-Vertebrate Paleontology
Laboratory and Professor Emeritus, Department of Geosciences at the University of
Texas at Austin) and Eileen Johnson (Professor of Museum Science and Curator of
Anthropology, Texas Tech University Museum and Director, Lubbock Lake Landmark),
I must give a heart-felt thank you for your direction and strong support. As dissertation
committee members, professors, and friends who have demanded excellence and strong
effort over nearly two and a half decades, you’ve rewarded me with friendship and
insight into how faunal remains may be studied and how very different individuals
conduct the process of scientific research. For the other members of my dissertation

committee, Thomas R. Hester, Michael B. Collins, and James A. Neely, thanks for your
wisdom in guiding me out of the wilderness of finding a topic, through the research, and
into the shelter on the river to completion.

Finally and most importantly, to my wife

Kathleen and to our children, Will and Hannah, who were born and have grown during
my doctoral studies--I could not have finished this marathon without your support.

Acknowledgements

For assistance in completing this research, I must acknowledge the following
persons and organizations. Dr. Timothy Rowe, Director of the Texas Memorial
Museum-Vertebrate Paleontology Laboratory and his predecessor, Dr. Ernest
Lundelius, strived to provide a stable research environment in which to study the
faunal collections from Arenosa Shelter. Bob Rainey and Earl Yarmer (retired)
of the Texas Memorial Museum-Vertebrate Paleontology Laboratory shared their
combined nearly six decades of experience in professional museum preparation,
teaching me skills that made completion of this research possible. Dr. Thomas R.
Hester, Dr. Darrell Creel, and the rest of the staff of Texas Archeological
Research Laboratory provided lab space, access, and insight into the Arenosa
Shelter research collections housed at the lab. The National Park Service allowed
access to the Arenosa Shelter collections for research. My employer, the Texas
Water Development Board, partially supported my doctoral studies to benefit all
of the citizens of Texas by increasing the professional development of its
archaeological staff.

Research into the zooarchaeology and bone technology of the Lower Pecos
cultural region provided in insight into extraction of faunal resources from the
arid canyon lands of the region by its prehistoric inhabitants and how they
incorporated those resources into human subsistence and technological systems.
Using samples from the National Park Service held-in-trust faunal and bone
artifact collections obtained from Arenosa Shelter during excavations at 1960s,
the current research detailed the extensive use of faunal resources in the site and
use of diverse econiches in subsistence pursuits by prehistoric inhabitants of the
region. In particular, heavy reliance on resources from the rivers themselves was
documented. The current research discovered specific processing methods for the

vii

many medium to large fish caught by prehistoric inhabitants. Filleting was used
prehistorically in preparing fish for consumption and raises the possibility of both
long-term storage and transport of food products away from the rivers and
canyons themselves. Also encountered in the faunal study was a specific skinning
method used prehistorically to remove whole pelts, preserving the distinctive
features of the head.

Presence of this method, termed caping, raises the

possibility of pelt use for shamanistic purposes and may have implications for
connections to the region’s prominent rock art.

More typical was the

documentation of fauna-related subsistence pursuits with a heavy reliance on
rabbits, artiodactyls, and certain other terrestrial animals from late Pleistocene to
Historic times. Detailed butchering sequences were determined from the analysis.
From those pursuits, subsistence byproducts entered the technological system as
input for bone technology subsystem operating in parallel to and in support of
subsystems based on other raw materials. Detailed analysis of manufacturing and
use wear characteristics was conducted using a large sample of the bone artifacts
from Arenosa Shelter. The analysis enabled the prehistoric manufacturing
process for bone implements and ornaments to be defined. The use wear
component was the first of its kind in this region and documented use of
implements in support of subsistence, textile, lithic, and other segments of the
technological system over a significant time period.

I. CONTEXT OF RESEARCH
Chapter 1: Introduction
PROLOGUE
During the terminal Pleistocene and early Holocene, the natural and cultural
environment on the southern margin of the North American Great Plains changed
significantly (Bement 1986; Johnson 1986, 1987). Extinction of large herd mammals
during the terminal Pleistocene removed all megafauna as potential Paleoindian quarry
except the bison. Availability of bison varied during the Late Quaternary in response to
greater seasonality and increased annual temperature fluctuations (Dillehay 1974;
Lundelius, et al. 1987; Johnson and Holliday 1989, 1995; McDonald 1984).
Apparent in the archaeological record from sites in the region, including Aubrey,
Baker Cave, Blackwater Draw, Bonfire Shelter, Devils Mouth; Hinds Cave, Lipscomb,
Lubbock Lake, Miami, Plainview, and Wilson–Leonard, is an apparent shift by later
Paleoindians from a concentration on megafauna hunting to hunting, trapping, or
collecting a wider variety of smaller game (Bousman, et al. 2002; Collins 1995, 1998;
Dibble and Lorrain 1968; Ferring 2001; Hester 1983; Hofman, et al. 1991; Holliday, et
al. 1994; Hulbert 1984; Johnson 1964; Johnson and Holliday 1989; Johnson 1987; Lord
1984; Lorrain 1965; Saunders 1980; Saunders and Daeschler 1994; Sellards, et al. 1947;
Sorrow 1968). Available evidence supports Late Paleoindian hunters responding to
environmental change at the Pleistocene – Holocene transition by adopting initial aspects
of a broad-spectrum hunting and gathering Archaic lifeway, actively hunting or
scavenging large prey opportunistically only when it was available (Bousman, et al.
2002; Collins 1998; Johnson 1964; Johnson 1987; Sorrow 1968; Vierra 1994). Broad
1

resource procurement was evident in Baker Cave deposits of this context, with an
established fiber industry apparent (Andrews and Adovasio 1980; Hester 1983).
Despite episodes of increasing aridity in the early Holocene over much of the
region and the evident shift in several aspects of human technology, long-term stability is
apparent in the regional archaeological record of the Archaic cultural stage throughout
most of the Holocene (Dering 1999; Hudler 2000:88-91; Toomey 1993:450).
Subsistence and tool-making technologies may have been altered during the Early
Archaic in response to region-wide changes in the natural environment, but thereafter
achieved a stability that lasted with minor variations to within 1,000 years of the present
time. A wide, but changing array of plant and animal resources obtainable by huntergatherer subsistence technologies has been available during the last 12,000 years on the
southern Great Plains and at its margins (Dering 1999; Hudler 2000; Johnson 1987;
Toomey 1993).
Episodic aridity in the early Holocene partitioned the landscape of the Southern
Great Plains into relatively dry uplands bisected by a series of better-watered riparian
corridors (Figure 1). This was especially true in the Lower Pecos cultural region of
Texas and northern Mexico, located at the southern margin of the Great Plains (Bryant
and Holloway 1985; Dering 1999; McMahan, et al. 1984; Trimble 1980:Fig. 1). Riparian
corridors formed oases in the midst of a desert-adapted shrub-shortgrass savannah. The
shrub-shortgrass savannah had a component of desert succulent vegetation that became
more pronounced as the Holocene progressed, although this trend may have been
reversed by at least one strong mesic interval (Dering 1999).

Four vegetation units have been identified for the Holocene Lower Pecos region
on the basis of modern analogues and plant fossils, broadly grouped into upland and
lowland zones by Dering (1979), Flyr (1966), and Lord (1984). These units include the
vega-terrace unit found on riparian canyon floors, the cliff-canyon unit in the middle and
upper portions of tributary canyons, upland hills, and upland flats (Lord 1984:45-48).
The canyon units are distinguished on the basis of water needs of woody vegetation.
Large trees have been present on the vega-terraces in the past, including mesquite,
willow, sycamore, pecan, live oak, and mulberry. Other constituents have included the
common reed, and several species of Opuntia sp. cacti. Large trees in the Rio GrandePecos canyons are susceptible to destructive effects of flooding which removes them
from the landscape for several decades (Williams-Dean 1978). Similar effects from
flooding may be documented on prehistoric settlement in the region.
Hunter-gatherers living permanently in the Lower Pecos oasis focused on critical
natural resources, especially permanent water sources. Subsistence technologies aided
successful adaptation of hunter-gatherers to the Lower Pecos oasis and surrounding arid
lands, allowing available prey to be extracted from all environmental zones.
INTRODUCTION OF RESEARCH PROBLEMS

Hunter-gatherer subsistence technology may be split into several behavioral
components. Among these are procurement (tools or food), processing (tool-making or
processing of foodstuffs), and use/storage (tools, foodstuffs, etc.). Procurement of
foodstuffs may be differentiated by the nature of prey. Plants and animals have much
different procurement and processing requirements, with differing implications for
hunter-gatherers (Speth 1990, 1991a). Both provide carbohydrates, proteins, fats, and
trace minerals necessary in the human diet.

4

The pursuit and capture of many animals represents more of a risk because they
are mobile. This risk may be lessened through adequate knowledge of a specific prey’s
behavior and habitat preferences that reduces the total area searched for them (Bettinger
1991; Winterhalder 1986). One important generalization understood by both the huntergatherer and the anthropological analyst is that animal foods also provide large amounts
of complete protein and fat, two critical nutrients lacking in many plants foods. These
are variable, but usually seasonally predictable and reliable. Fish often have higher fat
levels than most terrestrial vertebrates, an important consideration in a riparian oasis. Fat
and protein content in fish vary seasonally individually and within a species, as do the
overall condition and amount of meat and roe (McClane 1981:3, 7; Speth 1990, 1991a).
Bone may be fashioned into formal or informal tools through a variety of
manufacturing techniques, including dynamic fracturing (analogous to flaking of lithic
tools) using hammer stones or grooving and snapping.

Further shaping during

manufacturing or rejuvenation is possible by flaking, grinding, and other abrasion
(Harrell 1983; Johnson 1985). Tools may be used in many ways, including but not
limited to cutting, scraping, puncturing, and punching.
Bone may have offered Lower Pecos hunter-gatherers an acceptable alternative
material to wood, shell, and cryptocrystalline stone for producing usable tools or tool
components that would have been used in active or passive hunting and fishing,
butchering, net-making, hide processing, lithic tool-making or many other activities in
their daily lives. Long-term bone preservation in archaeological and paleontological
localities in the region is often quite good, so evidence for manufacture and use of bone
tools is identifiable and available in the form of finished tools and manufacturing debris.
The intent of the dissertation research was to determine what vertebrate animal
resources Late Quaternary resident of the Lower Pecos region took from the
5

environment, how they used it for subsistence purposes, and how they incorporated
byproducts from subsistence into a sub-set of the technology system. By examining the
hunting and fishing technology used in the Lower Pecos region, the author determined
how prehistoric hunter-gatherers gained, processed, possibly stored, used foodstuffs and
gained the means necessary to cope with both stability and variability in the environment
(Croes and Hackenberger 1988). Inferences are drawn from these coping mechanisms
may have affected individual or group decisions, such as cooperative behaviors, such as
those relating to technology, ritual, etc. (Chartkoff 1989:291).
Specific research questions used in the dissertation research to examine aspects of
Lower Pecos subsistence technology included:
1. Did Lower Pecos residents use much of the landscape to obtain the faunal portion
of their subsistence economy?
2 . How much use of faunal resources from the canyons and surrounding arid
uplands did Lower Pecos indigenous residents make and did they fully process
carcasses for food and other products?
3. Did prehistoric Lower Pecos indigenous inhabitants tap the resources of the rivers
and fully use the available fish for subsistence and technological purposes?
4 . Were specific techniques used by Lower Pecos indigenous peoples, such as
caping, to skin medium sized mammals for purposes other than standard
subsistence needs?
5. By the Middle Archaic, did Lower Pecos indigenous peoples use faunal resources
for purposes beyond fulfilling subsistence needs and incorporate their byproducts
to fulfill technological needs?

6

6. Did prehistoric Lower Pecos indigenous inhabitants exploit the byproducts of
subsistence in specific ways for raw materials that were incorporated into the
technological subsystem?
7 . Were decorative elements incorporated into their technological pursuits by
prehistoric Lower Pecos inhabitants?
8. Did prehistoric residents of the Lower Pecos region use bone technology for the
purposes of supporting other segments of the overall technological system?
SUMMARY OF THE PROJECT

The dissertation project began with background research into methods and theory
of subsistence technology and the archaeology of the Lower Pecos cultural region. The
background research was especially directed to determine how they related to Arenosa
Shelter (site 41VV99), a site with a large, diverse, but incompletely studied faunal
collection and abundant evidence of bone technology. Also included in the background
research was a thorough examination of existing field and laboratory records for Arenosa
Shelter. From the results of background research, the theoretical orientation and
methodology for data collection, analysis, and interpretation were developed for the
current project.
The project used two parallel lines of investigation to examine Lower Pecos
subsistence technology. One was a study of the Arenosa Shelter faunal collection that
included residues from the inhabitants’ subsistence economy. The second was a study of
bone technology, using artifacts from the site to determine how bone tools and ornaments
were manufactured and used in the technological system in a region where many other
durable raw materials for tools were limited.
The two studies occurred sequentially, beginning with the faunal analysis. A
sample of complete or fragmentary animal bones was drawn from Arenosa Shelter faunal
7

specimens housed in the Texas Memorial Museum’s Vertebrate Paleontology Laboratory
(TMM-VPL) collections. Following museum preparation of the sample, data were
collected using microscopic examination to identify taxonomic characteristics and
cultural modifications.

The bone technology analysis was the second step in the

sequence. A sample of specimens was taken from the bone artifacts in the collections of
the Texas Archeological Research Laboratory at the University of Texas at Austin.
Following museum preparation of the sample, data were collected using low to highpower microscopic examination to identify manufacturing and use wear characteristics.
The results from both studies were analyzed and compared to results anticipated from the
theoretical framework.
SCOPE OF THE PROJECT

Reassessing initial intentions to study Paleoindian subsistence technology, the
current research was decided upon because it involved a similar theoretical perspective
using an important, but incompletely studied, collection from the Lower Pecos region. A
major consideration involved in choosing the current research subject was that all
collections from Arenosa Shelter were housed in Austin, where the author’s family
resided and where he had full-time employment. Choosing to study the Arenosa Shelter
materials provided access to a faunal collection of over 47,000 complete or fragmentary
late Quaternary faunal specimens and nearly 1,000 Middle Archaic to Late Prehistoric –
Historic bone artifacts from Arenosa Shelter.

The complex nature of the site’s

stratigraphy, its physiographic location, recovery methods used by the excavators, the
effects of long term museum storage, and current physical state of the records and
collections themselves all affected the data available to research. It was known early in
the investigation that the research would provide a detailed look at an incomplete sample
of remains from Lower Pecos subsistence technology. However, both of these large and
8

diverse collections had sufficient bone preservation to make research results a major
contribution to the study of Lower Pecos archaeology.
During this research project, data from 547 bone artifacts and approximately
4,900 faunal specimens were collected in FileMaker Pro databases and analyzed.
Included in the faunal sample were the plaster-jacketed Late Pleistocene bison remains
from Feature 18 that were excavated under laboratory conditions prior to its analysis.
The stratigraphy of Arenosa Shelter was carefully re-examined to determine taphonomic
factors that caused reduced frequency and deteriorated condition of faunal and bone
artifact materials from lower strata, including Feature 18. Based directly on Dibble's
original field notes, profiles, and photographs, rather than subsequently published but
incomplete descriptions, the refined definition of lower strata more completely reflects
the complicated stratigraphy in the area specifically studied for the current research. The
faunal analysis resulted in identification of approximately 140 taxa from this diverse
assemblage that was dominated by rabbits, deer, catfish, and cyprinid suckers. Terminal
Late Archaic faunal specimens dominated the sample and originated in upper strata that
were the site’s least disturbed. The flood ravaged Early Archaic strata provided very few
faunal specimens. Specific outcomes of prehistoric processing of prey carcasses were
identified, including specialized skinning behaviors for carnivores and filleting of fish.
Analysis of 547 bone artifacts from Middle Archaic to Late Prehistoric – Historic
context resulted in definition of 40 forms of ornaments and 29 forms of implements based
on morphology and manufacturing characteristics. Bead forms constituted the ornament
class. Implements included a wide array of formal and informal forms that were
dominated by elongated, tapering spatulates. Manufacturing byproducts and stages were
also identified during the investigation. Analysis of manufacturing characteristics
identified a range in complexity in both tools and ornaments. Artifact forms varied from
9

simple tools or ornaments that were based on minimally modified skeletal elements to
formal tools or ornament with extensive raw material modification during manufacture.
Incised decoration was found on a limited number of both tools and ornaments. Most
implements were made from extensively modified deer or antelope long bones, while a
more diverse array of mammals and bird long bones provided raw materials for beads.
Wear characteristics were also used to tentatively identify what implements were used
for.
STRUCTURE OF THE DISSERTATION

The dissertation structure is comprised of eight chapters grouped into three major
sections and four appendices. The major sections include: Context of Research; Current
Research, Analysis, and Results; and Interpretation. The initial section contains three
chapters. The first chapter is introductory. It introduces research problems, summarizes
the project and its scope, and introduces the structure of this study. The second chapter
places the research into regional archaeological context.

The theoretical and

methodological context of the work is contained in the third chapter. The second section
of the dissertation contains three chapters that are the central to the work. Chapter Four
puts forth the methods and materials used in the current research. The next two chapters
describe the results of the faunal and bone artifact analyses. Final chapters of the
dissertation are grouped into the third section and interpret the results of the research.
Chapter Seven discusses subsistence evidence, bone modification, and special topics that
include specific skinning behaviors used in obtaining carnivore hides and interpretation
of the Late Pleistocene bison carcass in Feature 18. The final chapter presents a summary
of the research, its eight conclusions, and suggests avenues for further research.
Appendix 1 contains tables from Chapter Two. Tables from Chapter Five are contained
in Appendix Two and relate to results of the faunal analysis. The third appendix contains
10

tables from Chapter Six, the bone artifact analysis results. The final appendix contains
four tables from Chapter Seven that synopsize the context of research at Arenosa Shelter
and regional chronology, compare diachronic degree of fragmentation for aggregated
groups of taxa, and interpret Feature 18.

Chapter 2: Arenosa Shelter and the Lower Pecos Archaeological Record
Arenosa Shelter was recorded as an archaeological site in 1958. Graham and
Davis (1958) located the site during preliminary archaeological survey of the proposed
Diablo Reservoir in Val Verde County, southwestern Texas. Diablo Reservoir was later
renamed Amistad Reservoir in the spirit of friendliness and cooperation hoped for along
the international boundary between the United States and Mexico (Figure 2). The site
was designated with the triniomial number 41VV99 in the River Basin Survey site
numbering system used by the Smithsonian Institution's program for archaeology. The
trinomial designation indicates the ninety-ninth site recorded in the county of Val Verde
(VV) in Texas (state designator 41).
Arenosa Shelter was originally recorded as a terrace site exposed in gully
cutbanks and terrace scarps dissecting the river terrace below the canyon wall. The rock
shelter was recognized after testing at the site began (Prewitt 1997). Only when the brush
and tree cover was removed was it determined that the site was a rock shelter almost
completely filled with alluvial and cultural deposits.

Pecos Cultural Area.
CHRONOLOGY AND CULTURAL POSITION
Arenosa Shelter’s cultural sequence was uniquely important to the excavator
(Patton and Dibble 1982:106). He stressed that it represented an essentially continuous
occupation in the upper part of the Amistad Reservoir area over the last 10,000 years of
cultural development in the region. The unique sequence existed because the lower
deposits in the rock shelter were protected from Pecos River floodwaters. A large roof
block partially blocking the shelter entrance and an alluvial fan immediately upstream of
13

the shelter both deflected much of the destructive force of floodwaters away from the
site.
Researchers over the last three decades segmented the Lower Pecos cultural
sequence according to their own needs (Collins 1974; Dibble personal communication to
Prewitt cited in Prewitt 1983; Shafer 1986; Story and Bryant 1966; Turpin 1991). The
current research uses a chronology based on Dibble’s phase names as period designations
with durations reported by Turpin (1991). The chronology is in Table 2.1.
There are recognized problems with the natural and typologically-based cultural
stratigraphy from Arenosa Shelter. But, as Dibble firmly believed, it remains very
14

important. The excavations produced over 32 C assays that yielded a chronological
14

sequence of at least 9,550 radiocarbon years. The published C assays in Table 2.2 are
abstracted from Patton and Dibble (1982) and Turpin (1991:Table 1.1).
Most of the chronological sequence is from the Archaic cultural stage. The
14

earliest C date from Arenosa Shelter was from charcoal in stratum 38 near the base of
the depositional sequence (Patton and Dibble 1982:106; Turpin 1991:24-25). Like many
of the other lower strata in the shelter, stratum 38 is partially flood-disturbed. Stratum 38
contains burned rock, charcoal, and lithic artifacts that are the earliest unequivocal
cultural materials in the site (Collins 1974:549). This stratum is below the first identified
Early Archaic cultural materials (Early Barbed-style projectile points).
An undated bison carcass was recorded by Dibble (n.d.) as Feature 18 in stratum
40. His field notes associated the disarticulated partial carcass in Feature 18 with two
limestone cobbles and a single small chert flake. These associations were in a fine
textured stratum devoid of other cobbles. Vertebrate paleontologist Rickard Toomey
tentatively identified the Feature 18 carcass as Bison antiquus, an extinct late Pleistocene
species of bison. Undated, scattered fragments of bison and other large ungulates were
14

recorded in stratum 42 and included Bison antiquus long bone fragments recorded as
Feature 19, the oldest cultural feature found. Features 18 and 19 were deposited between
the end of the Paleoindian Bonfire period and the beginning of the Oriente period.
Many researchers would recognize late Paleoindian-aged cultural remains in the
Lower Pecos region as Archaic (Turpin 1991:24-25). They meld a Paleoindian lithic
tradition into a subsistence technology with broad-spectrum resource procurement and
fiber industry technology. Research reported from Baker Cave and Hinds Cave supports
this view (Andrews and Adovasio 1980; Hester 1983; Shafer 1986). Late Paleoindian
evidence in the Lower Pecos is very similar to that reported for the Paleoindian Western
Pluvial Lakes tradition in the Great Basin, rather than the big-game hunting association
typically associated with the southern Great Plains (Hester 1973; Willig, et al. 1988).
The end of the Lower Pecos Archaic was marked by a technological change about
1,000 years ago when the bow and arrow was adopted (Bement 1989; Turpin 1991:2635). Between 8,800 years ago and about 1,300 years ago, the archaeological record is
dominated by a stable broad-spectrum subsistence technology. Subsistence primarily
utilized starches from desert succulent plants as a major staple food source in an
episodically arid environment (Brown 1991; Chadderdon 1983; Dering 1999; Shafer
1981, 1988; Shafer and Bryant 1977; Sobolik 1991, 1996; Stock 1983; Turpin 1988;
Williams-Dean 1978).
The Lower Pecos Early Archaic is the Viejo period. Typological nomenclature is
still evolving for over-lapping projectile point forms during this 3,400-year period
between 8,800 and 5,500 years before present (B.P.). Forms include Early Barbed, Early
Stemmed, and Early Corner Notched. Typology of the Early Barbed forms has been
refined to define the Baker and Bandy types in the Lower Pecos. These are similar to the
Uvalde and Martindale types of central and southern Texas.
15

Well-adapted Early Archaic hunter-gatherers occupied Arenosa Shelter during the
Viejo period (strata 37 - 33) that intensified their broad-spectrum subsistence
technologies in response to environment changes. Feature types known from the region
include burned rock middens, hearths, and prickly pear pad-floored living areas (Lord
1984). Earth ovens were first used to cook desert succulents such as lechugilla, prickly
pear cactus, and sotol during the Viejo periods. Evidence for them is found from the
latest part of the archeological record for the Viejo period at Baker Cave and Hinds Cave
(Brown 1991; Dering 1999; Shafer and Bryant 1977). Williams-Dean (1978) and Stock
(1983) analyzed coprolites from Hinds Cave dating to this period. The human fecal
matter analyzed by Williams-Dean (1978) dated to about 6,000 years B. P. She found the
remnants of a diet that included gathered plants (desert succulents such as prickly pear,
sotol, and lechugilla; nuts; and wild onions) rodents, birds, and reptiles. Stock (1983)
analyzed slightly earlier coprolites to compare with the Williams-Dean (1978) data. Her
analysis found prickly pear, wild onion, walnuts, persimmons, fish and rodents.
Between 6,000 and 5,000 years B.P., projectile points change typologically and
technologically to Middle Archaic styles, including Pandale. The gradual postPleistocene regional drying trend prior to 5,000 B. P. was occasionally punctuated by hotxeric or cool-mesic intervals, but had an overall reduction in effective moisture and
increase in seasonality (Blum, et al. 1994:14; Dering 1999; Hall 1990; Toomey
1993:450). Arenosa Shelter’s depositional records (strata 32 - 30) contain erosional
disconformities caused by floods at the beginning of the Middle Archaic. Intense erosion
in the region and major flood events disturbed many of the lower strata at Arenosa
Shelter. Ten major flood events affected the site during the latter half of the period from
5,500 to 3,200 B.P. (Collins 1974:547-556; Dering 1999; Patton and Dibble 1982).
16

Cultural deposits in Arenosa Shelter’s lower strata are significantly disturbed by flooding
and often not in primary context between strata 30 and 36 (Dibble n.d.).
The post-glacial minimum in effective moisture occurred between 5,000 and
2,500 B. P. (Blum, et al. 1994:14-15; Toomey 1993). Increased summer insolation and
other factors favored greater monsoonal flow during the early Holocene. Isolated high
intensity convectional storms first occurred during this period. A concurrent reduction in
vegetation allowed soil profiles degradation and erosion across the Edwards Plateau,
including at its southwestern margin in the Lower Pecos. Deep, overbank flood events
were rare for Edwards Plateau streams in the Early Holocene (Blum, et al. 1994: 16).
The sedimentary response to climatic change in the Lower Pecos region itself differed in
timing from streams on the Edwards Plateau proper (Blum and Valastro 1989:450-451;
Kochel 1988; Kochel and Baker 1988; Kochel, et al. 1982; Patton and Baker 1977;
Patton and Dibble 1982; Patton, et al. 1979).
The cultural response to increasing aridity during the early Middle Archaic was an
increased population density in the canyons. This increase was accompanied by regional
insularity in projectile point styles during the first millennium of the Eagle’s Nest period,
5,500 - 4,500 B.P. (Hester 1980; Turpin 1991:28-29). Lord (1984:212-213) found that
deer were the primary meat animal in the diet during the Archaic at Hinds Cave,
supplemented by smaller mammals before about 4,800 B. P. and after 4,000. B. P. After
4,800 B. P., fish and aquatic turtles were also important supplements. Dering (1999) and
Brown (1991) consider the use of labor-intensive earth oven cooking technology to cook
desert succulents an indication that dietary stress caused less desirable plant resources to
be used during prolonged seasonal drought. Dering (1999), based on experimental
evidence, considers earth ovens for processing desert succulents to indicate forced
reliance on foods that required adoption of a high degree of residential mobility because
17

fuel and desert succulents are quickly depleted. Mussel shells from the rivers occurred in
many of the Archaic strata at Arenosa Shelter (Collins 1974:547-556). Periodic, more
intense flooding during this time exposed higher quality chert sources in river gravels
often buried within the thick alluvium in stream valleys (Collins 1974:390-395).
Regionally, fluvial deposition restarted about 5,000 years ago and allowed alluvial
terraces to accrete (Blum and Valastro 1989; Blum, et al. 1994; Hall 1990).
At Arenosa Shelter (strata 21 - 23), the trend in regionally insular projectile point
development continues in the San Felipe period (4,100 - 3,200 B.P.). Refinement and
differentiation on the Pandale technological theme led to development of the Langtry,
Val Verde, Almagre, and Arenosa types. Population density and episodic environmental
deterioration are two factors possibly relating to the introduction of ritual rock art in the
region during this period (Turpin 1990). The Lower Pecos region is situated in a
gradational zone between the Great Plains and Chihuahuan Desert and experiences an
extreme variation in annual and seasonal rainfall (Boyd 2003; Dering 1999).
The early part of the Late Archaic (Cibola period, 3,150 - 2,300 B.P.) had a
moister climate regime. Plains grass species recolonized the upland desert grasslands and
the major protein and fat resources in bison returned to the region. An economic shift
towards hunting of bison is shown by widespread occurrence of broad-bladed, barbed
projectile points, e.g. Marcos and Marcos-like (Dibble, as cited Turpin 1991:31). B.
bison remains from this time period are known from Arenosa Shelter (strata 10 and 11).
A widely held view is that these B. bison remains and associated projectile points may
represent the intrusion of Plains groups (Turpin 1991:31).
The latter two Late Archaic sub-periods (Flanders, 2,300 B.P. and Blue Hills,
2,300 - 1,300 B.P.) have both typological and stratigraphic problems, which make
interpretation of their remains at Arenosa Shelter difficult (Turpin 1991:32-34). These
18

include dating inconsistencies in strata 9 and 10 that contain Shumla-like projectile
points. Possible mixing of strata containing Ensor - Frio-type projectile points between
Strata 2 and 9 in the site is another problem. Both overall continuity and some variation
in technique in the lithic technology through time occur in these strata at Arenosa Shelter
(Collins 1974:356-360).

Differences in use of soft hammer bifacial thinning support

evidence for the possible intrusion of Plains bison hunters during the Late Archaic.
The Late Prehistoric cultural stage is represented at Arenosa Shelter by the Flecha
and Infierno periods, 1,320 - 450 B.P. (Turpin 1991:35-36). A change in subsistence
technology is documented when the bow and arrow was adopted at the beginning of the
period. Arrow points co-occur with Ensor dart points in mixed context in Arenosa
Shelter (Stratum 2a). It is difficult to properly sequence the chronology of arrow point
types for similar reasons (Turpin 1991:35-36). Economic strategies, mortuary patterns,
and rock art change during the period. Ring middens consistently appear to date to this
or later time periods. The results of recent work by Kenmotsu and Wade (2002) and
Mehalchick and Boyd (1999) consider the Infierno cultural manifestation to be a local
variant of Toyah groups residing elsewhere on the Edwards Plateau.
Coprolites from the Late Prehistoric occupations at Baker Cave contained dietary
remnants rich in plants and small animals (Sobolik 1991). The principal plant was the
prickly pear cactus, although desert succulents were also eaten as a staple. Wild onions
were used as a seasoning or relish (Sobolik 1991:109). Seeds from cacti, goosefoot,
juniper, and hackberry, oak acorns, and walnuts were also part of the plant foods
consumed. Fish were the most important faunal constituent of the diet. Cyprinform and
perciform fish bones and scales were associated with charcoal. This co-occurrence is
attributed to roasting of whole fish prior to consumption (Sobolik 1991:110). Small
mammals included cotton rat, woodrat, and deer mouse. Recovery of nearly all bones of
19

single individuals of these species in individual Baker Cave coprolites indicated that
small mammals were being ingested nearly whole (Sobolik 1991:110). Small birds were
also being eaten whole. Lizard bones and skin, snake vertebrae and scales, and rabbit
bones in coporolites also occur in Baker Cave coprolites. Larger animal remains were not
contained in the Late Prehistoric Baker Cave coprolites because meat was removed from
their bones before it was eaten (Sobolik (1991:110, 115).
A lack of many material remains from the Historic period other than rock art
panels is evident (Boyd 2003; Turpin 1991). Historic rock art includes post-contact
motifs such as missions, crosses, cattle, robed figures, and men on horseback
(Boyd:2003:21, Figure 2.7). Historic period indigenous rock art has early and late styles
(Kenmotsu and Wade 2002:119-121). The late art is drawn in naturalistic Plains
Ceremonial and Biographic style, possibly reflecting intrusion of Comanche or Kiowa
Apache into the region (Kenmotsu and Wade 2002:121-122; Keyser 1987:45-48). Stone
structural remains are reported from Historic Period sites and include wickiup or tipi
rings, small cairns, and mortar holes (Kenmotsu and Wade 2002:117; Mehalchick and
Boyd 1999:157).
SITE DESCRIPTION
Arenosa Shelter is described based on excavations made before its 1969
inundation by Amistad Reservoir. Site 41VV99 is a rock shelter on the right-hand
(northwest) bank of the Pecos River, 1.2 km above its confluence with the Rio Grande
(Figure 3). Kochel (1980), Patton (1977), Patton and Dibble (1982:108) reported that its
location is within the conservation pool of Amistad Reservoir (Figure 4). Before dam
construction, it was on the outside of a meander of the Pecos just above its Rio Grande
confluence (Figure 5).
20

The shelter opens in a southeasterly direction and had a horizontal extent of over
95 meters. The excavated area of the site was at least 14 meters deep (Collins 1974:35;
Dibble 1967). The alluvial fan at the mouth of a short tributary canyon extends onto the
alluvial terrace about 100 meters upstream of the site. The fan protects the site's deposits
from the direct impact of all but the largest floods from upriver. The tributary canyon
extends about 1.5 km into the uplands west of the Pecos River. Surrounding uplands rise
at least 100 meters above the floor of the Pecos river canyon.

The site's topographic setting is important because it lies low on the canyon wall.
The site is at the topographic boundary between the alluvial terraces of the Pecos River
and the lower canyon wall at an elevation of approximately 329 meters (1080 ft) above
mean sea level (U. S. Army 1944). The site is contained in the first and second alluvial
terraces (Dibble 1967:4; Kochel 1980; Patton 1977; Patton and Dibble 1982). The
topographic setting is important in stratigraphic interpretation because it shows primary
characteristics of open alluvial terrace sites and secondary characteristics of rock shelters.
A large, distinctive notch that forms a pour-off point for runoff draining down the steep
slope marks the bedrock of the lower canyon wall just above the site.
As excavated, Arenosa Shelter’s deposits were between 6 and 21 meters above
the natural, low water surface of the Pecos. As shown in Figure 6, the site contained
stratified cultural materials, features, and living floors in a sequence that almost
completely filled the shelter (Collins 1974:35; Kochel 1980; Patton 1977; Patton and
Dibble 1982:Figure 5).

The stratigraphic sequence also contained inter-bedded,

culturally sterile limestone fragments, alluvial sands, and silts. Context of cultural
materials in most upper strata was good except where mixing was documented. Some
lower strata were adversely affected by flooding. Cultural materials in strata 32-36 were
redeposited and in secondary context. The largest of several large limestone spalls and
roof blocks that fell during the shelter's early occupation blocked the shelter's mouth in
the lower deposits.

26

Named the “Big Mother Rock” by the excavation crew, this spall was at least
15.17 meters long, 13.14 meters wide, and 5.5 meters thick and had formed part of the
overhanging roof of the shelter before its fall (Dibble, n.d.).

The lowest deposits

excavated at the site were composed of limestone dust, small limestone spalls, and sands.
The excavated late Quaternary depositional sequence at Arenosa was at least 48
feet (14.5 meters) thick and consisted of 49 defined strata. Twenty four strata contained
cultural materials in either primary or redeposited context (Collins 1974:547; Dibble
n.d.). Stratigraphic descriptions found in Tables 2.3 and 2.4 and Figure 6 are based on
the excavator's field notes and published sources. The descriptions for strata 1- 22 are
based on those in Dibble (n.d., 1997) and Collins (1974). Descriptions for strata 23 - 42
are based solely on Dibble's original field notes, profiles, and photographs, rather than
subsequently published but incomplete descriptions. These sources more completely
illustrate the complicated stratigraphy in the area specifically studied for the current
dissertation. The more detailed description is critical in interpretation of the site's basal
deposits and their faunal contents.
HISTORY OF PREVIOUS RESEARCH
This research uses National Park Service (NPS) collections resulting from major
salvage excavations sponsored by the NPS at Arenosa Shelter. Excavation of the site
occurred during planning and construction of Amistad Reservoir. Prior to its inundation
in 1969, the site was excavated in four field seasons between 1965 and 1968 by
University of Texas at Austin crews. Crews from the Texas Archeological Salvage
Project (TASP) worked under the field direction of David S. Dibble (Prewitt 1997:ix-x).
Dibble excavated the site in two large blocks, with a standard grid overlaid to
control horizontal provenience (Collins 1974:548-549). The grid's N-S axis was oriented
27

to about 330° East of North to align with the bluff and terrace orientation along the river
(Figure 7). Two N-S backhoe trenches cut perpendicular to the bluff bounded the down
stream excavation block. A third N-S trench was excavated about 50 feet upstream.
Excavation unit size was based on 5x5 foot squares, but small individual units were
sometimes combined into larger aggregated units (e.g. 10 x 15 feet).
Dibble’s excavation strategy was to cut two initial trenches, designated Trenches
1 and 2, perpendicular to the bluff in areas where disturbance to site deposits were
evident. The location of the eastern trench (Trench 2) enabled use of an existing surface
gully below the pour-off notch. Trenches 1 and 2 were about 23 feet apart. They
delimited the initial block and provided stratigraphic profiles for the excavation. The
block delimited was squared on the river side by a third backhoe trench (Trench 3) that
also provided an excellent, connecting stratigraphic profile. A third large block was later
excavated immediately east of the first backhoe trench. Two additional backhoe trenches
(4 and 5) were also excavated. The areas excavated in each field season are shown in
Figures 8 – 10.

Excavation of individual controlled units totaled about 1460 ft2. Dibble and his
assistants excavated downward from the initial surface by working back from the profiles
exposed in the trenches. Excavation was by natural strata. Thicker strata were subdivided
into several arbitrary levels, termed “cuts,” which dipped with the strata (Dibble 1967:9;
M. B. Collins, March, 1995:personal communication). All material from controlled
excavation units was manually screened. Most screens used 0.25-inch mesh hardware
cloth. The initial 1965-66 field season used the 0.5-inch mesh size that was also
commonly in use at the time (E. R. Prewitt, May, 1996:personal communication).
Material recovered from each stratum within an excavation unit was grouped into about
750 numerically designated lots for cataloging and future analysis. No final report on the
excavations had been written by the time of Dibble’s death in 1993. In 1997, the Texas
Archeological Research Laboratory (TARL) reprinted the interim report submitted to the
NPS in 1967.
Field records indicated that Dibble designated 404 of the approximately 750 total
lots as containing bone. The current research sampled faunal materials from the upstream
end of the site containing the deepest deposits. It also sampled previously cataloged bone
artifacts. Selection of the sample area allowed analysis of faunal materials from 85 lots,
or about 20 per cent of the lots with bone, and included a large portion of lots with the
best bone preservation, most stringent recovery methods, and most accurate provenience.
The 440 ft2 study area was located east of Trench #2 and included materials
between Stratum 1 and Stratum 37 in the excavation block between N200/W160 and
N210/W180. Faunal material from Stratum 38 - 42 in the deepest parts excavated in the
site was also included in the current analysis. This lower zone included all areas
excavated between N199/W167 and N215/W195, including Pits D, E, and F, and the 5x8
ft2 units N208/W180 - N208/W190. Based on preliminary tallies from previous
33

cataloguing efforts, approximately 3,250 bone fragments were represented in the sample.
These represented about 7 percent of the total bone fragments from the site at the time
that analysis began. A revised estimate of bone fragments based on the current analysis
is presented in Chapter 4.
The collections from Arenosa Shelter are curated in two research laboratories at
The University of Texas at Austin and have been differentiated on the basis of their
contents. Field excavation and lab records, bulk samples, and excavated cultural artifacts
are curated at TARL, including previously recognized bone tools. Bio-artifactual faunal
materials were transferred to the Vertebrate Paleontology Laboratory of the Texas
Memorial Museum (TMM-VP) in the 1980s. These TARL and TMM-VP collections
were re-inventoried in the late 1980s, aided by a NPS grant for collections originating at
Amistad National Recreation Area. The re-inventory results were entered into the NPS
computerized database as part of the subset designated AMIS for Amistad. The NPS
database is designated the Automated National Catalog System II (ANCS II). This effort
re-inventoried approximately 56% of the 400+ lots from the excavations, including bone
artifacts and bone fragments. Many of the over 8,700 the ANCS II database entries for
Arenosa Shelter cultural materials represent single items. The database included 1,348
entries for bone fragments and bone artifacts at the beginning of the current research,
totaling over 47,000 individual items.
The TMM-VP collection received additional examination under a National
Science Foundation (NSF) collections management grant in the early 1990s. This NSF
grant funded a more complete analysis of faunal material in 88 of the lots, including 38
that were not examined during the NPS re-inventory by TARL. This analysis results
were entered into the TMM-VP permanent computerized specimen catalog. The
34

databases resulting from these studies were not intended to be the results of full-scale
analysis.
Collins (1974:581) researched the lithic technology of Arenosa Shelter in his
dissertation and reports 1,541 projectile points in Arenosa Shelter site collections. His
research occurred soon after the completion of field work. Complete projectile points
include previously defined Archaic and Late Prehistoric types (See Table 2.5). There are
also several untyped cataloged forms that include early lanceolate and parallel-flaked
styles. Lithic artifacts and debitage are abundant in the site collections at TARL, with
973 entries in the AMIS catalog for projectile points (n=1,256). Many of these are
multiple-specimen entries. Additionally, many other entries in the TARL database
catalog identify items as bifaces that are recognized specifically as projectile point
fragments or preforms.
The typological classifications in the Arenosa Shelter AMIS catalog are broad and
may be internally inconsistent (Turpin 1991:18). Provenience information in the catalog
does not account for the horizontal and vertical variation across the site or divisions in its
strata. The original excavator recognized this discrepancy and cautioned that stratigraphic
designations were not always equivalent to cultural levels across the site (Dibble 1989:
personal communication to Turpin cited in Turpin 1991).
The only detailed typological study on projectile points from Arenosa Shelter
reported a statistical analysis of the three Middle Archaic Langtry-type variants (n=101)
from the shelter (Bement 1991). These include concave-based contracting stemmed
(Langtry), convex based contracting stemmed (Variant 3), and expanding stemmed (Val
Verde) forms. The analysis showed that all three are statistically valid types. Bement
(1991:62) proposes recognition of the Variant 3 form first documented by Schuetz (1956)
as a distinct, formal type under the name Arenosa.
35

Two Ph.D. students of University of Texas at Austin geology professor Victor
Baker conducted dissertation research using Arenosa Shelter. This research was
conducted in the mid- to late 1970s and used Arenosa Shelter data. The research
concentrated on the site’s stratigraphic record and was assisted by Dibble. These
dissertations by Robert C. Kochel (1980) and Peter C. Patton (1977) investigated paleoflood hydrology, its reflection in the stratigraphic record, and the effect of those earlier
floods on the region's stratigraphic record.
ASSESSMENT OF RESEARCH POTENTIAL AND TAPHONOMY
Considerable effort was spent in the present research locating and identifying all
relevant notes, photos, drawings, and plans now available from the 1965-68 excavations.
The field excavation records in the possession of TARL constitute most of those
originally produced by Dibble and his associates.

My conclusion is based on

examination of relevant collections and associated records, and through supplementary
interviews with persons directly involved with the excavations or who conducted
research using the collections over the last three decades (M. B. Collins, E. R. Prewitt,
and S. A. Turpin). Some original profile drawings and plane table maps, and most color
slides are no longer accessible at The University of Texas at Austin. They were either
lost in the field, were misplaced in the laboratory, or passed from possession of either
TASP or TARL after field work was completed.

Dibble returned records in his

possession when he left University employment in the early 1980s. The missing sources
may have been overlooked when Dibble left or they may remain at TARL in an
unforeseen location.
Records in TARL's possession duplicate each other. Copies made by the Records
Section overlap original records formerly in Sponsored Projects (formerly TASP). The
36

original records were combined with those in the Records Section after a mid-1990s
union of these research units. Elton Prewitt’s cooperation clarified additional details of
both field and lab records. Prewitt directed the excavation crew during the last field
season and also assisted in the lab. Michael B. Collins was also intimately familiar with
the TASP's 1960s work in the Lower Pecos, the specifics of Arenosa Shelter, its
excavation history, and contents of its records and collections. The present study has, by
necessity, been based on the Arenosa Shelter records and collections in the late 1990s.
Bone preservation of specimens in the TARL and TMM-VP collections ranges
from poor to excellent. As an example, the partial Bison antiquus remains from Feature
18 are poorly preserved while many of the small rodent bones from strata higher in the
site are in excellent condition. Abundant deer antler was found in Late Archaic levels in
the site (Collins 1974:347-349). The TARL collections contain at least one modified
Odocoileus sp. antler hypothesized to represent part of the flint-knapping toolkit (Collins
1974:129-130). Bone beads are also quite abundant, with 204 identified in preliminary
analyses by Dibble and catalogued in the AMIS catalog. Additional grooved and
snapped bone fragments are also coded in the AMIS catalog. Several hundred items were
coded in the 1980s re-inventory as awls or awl fragments, some with distinctive wear
patterns.
The site contains abundant mussel shells and bones of ducks, fish, and turtles.
These are evidence of the abundant aquatic vertebrate and invertebrate resources from the
region’s rivers being used. Many of the fish bones were earlier identified as the remains
of economically useful species, including the freshwater drum, alligator gar, and several
species of large catfish.
Recovery methods used at the site were not specifically developed to take
maximum advantage of faunal materials present. Variable bone preservation is evident
37

between strata. Storage of recovered faunal materials and bone artifacts prior to museum
preparation has not been climate controlled. Considering each of these issues, the current
research potential of the collection is less than it potentially was at the onset of
excavations in 1965. However, the site’s faunal and bone technology collection remains
one of the most complete in the region.
Several literature sources report that this site has been affected by complex natural
and cultural phenomena during the past eleven millennia (cf. Collins 1974; Kochel 1980;
Patton 1977; Patton and Dibble 1982; Turpin 1991). The effect impacted the integrity of
its cultural deposits. Flooding during the early Holocene (5,500 - 3,200 B.P.) disturbed
or discontinuously removed deposits from the earlier deposits (strata 30 - 36). Ten major
floods affected the site during the latter half of this period (Collins 1974:547-556; Patton
and Dibble 1982). The current research reinforced this interpretation. The reanalysis of
records for portions of the lower strata (strata 23 - 42) determined that published
descriptions significantly understated the magnitude of disturbance (cf. Figure 6). The
greater disturbance in lower deposits is at least partly explained by their location within
the alluvial first terrace, fully within the reach of major flooding. Above this elevation,
deposits are within the reach of only the most intense floods, such as that produced in
1954 by Hurricane Alice.
Cultural reworking that incorporated overlying ash and charcoal into sterile flood
deposits is another identified source of disturbance to integrity of cultural deposits.
Mixing resulted in sterile alluvial deposits that graded upwards into ash deposits
definitely cultural (Patton and Dibble 1982:108). The mixing may have masked
individual flood events and oversimplified the complicated stratigraphy (Patton
1977:121). After preliminary analysis of field records for the 1965 - 68 field seasons and
the computerized artifact catalogs, it was obvious that taphonomic factors causing
38

differential bone preservation and frequencies must be accounted for in the current
research.
Documented high-energy floods originated in the Pecos drainage and had
typically yellowish, buff, or tan-colored sands. Lower energy flood events originated in
the Rio Grande drainage are also present in the Arenosa Shelter depositional record.
They are red mud drapes that represent slackwater flooding (Kochel 1980:73, 106, 114116; Patton 1977:122, 185-186; Patton and Dibble 1982:108). Pecos flood events at
Arenosa Shelter are unique because they exhibit reverse grading of sediments. Pecos
flood events also begin with a mud drape that then gives way to laminated or ripplestratified sands, the opposite of typical fining-upward flood sequences. Geologists
attribute reverse grading to the site’s location in a slackwater zone early in flood events
or to the higher concentration of wash and suspended load that precedes the hydrographic
peak (Kochel 1980; Patton 1977; Patton and Dibble 1982).

Chapter 3: Method and Theory

THEORETICAL BASIS FOR THE ARENOSA S HELTER STUDY
The current faunal material and bone technology research was conducted using a
theoretical orientation from zooarchaeology.

This orientation is based on the

development and use of middle range theory in archaeology, including its subfield of
zooarchaeology. Middle range theory relies on actualistic research into site formation
processes, behavioral archaeology, and ethnoarchaeology (Bettinger 1991:77-82;
Gifford-Gonzales 1991; Gould 1978; Kroll and Price 1991:310; Schiffer 1976; Thomas
1971, 1986). Actualistic research uses observations of modern phenomena to create a
framework within which to interpret the remains of past cultures contained in
archaeological collections (Bettinger 1991:61-2; Binford 1977:6; Grayson 1986; Raab
and Goodyear 1984). Ethnographic observations of hunter-gatherer cultural behaviors
and the material residues of those behaviors are included.
In addition to potential incorporation of bone into the technological system as a
raw material, other aspects of recent zooarchaeological research are pertinent to the
current study. These are studies of bone modifications occurring during carcass
processing that include skinning, butchering (dismemberment and meat removal),
marrow removal, bone grease production, and disposal. An overview of the development
of zooarchaeological method and theory follows, with special emphasis to carcass
processing and disposal aspects.
ANTHROPOLOGICAL PERSPECTIVE IN ZOOARCHAEOLOGY
Zooarchaeological analyses have approached the subject from anthropological
perspectives that are both archaeological and ethnographic, as well as one more clearly
40

paleontological. The paleontological perspective is more often termed archaeozoology
(Reitz and Wing 1999:3). Both vertebrate and invertebrate remains are usually included
in modern archaeological analyses of faunal materials. Some use the term
osteoarchaeology to refer to the archaeological study of vertebrate osteological remains
(Olsen and Olsen 1981; Reed 1963; Reitz and Wing 1999; Uerpmann 1973:22).
The scope of zooarchaeological research may vary widely, depending on the
nature of the faunal remains, archaeological deposits, and the research orientation,
training, and research biases of the analysts involved (Reitz and Wing 1999:4).
Zooarchaeological studies in the past have investigated the physical constituents of
animal bodies, byproducts, and the remains of parasites present. Anthropological faunal
studies have been used to investigate site formation, biological processes, and cultural
processes (Reitz and Wing 1999:6-7). The anthropological perspective reflects the
complex interaction between humans and their environment. The consequences of that
relationship are also included in zooarchaeology.
The human – environmental interaction may exhibit aspects of cultural change or
stasis. Explaining those characteristics is complicated by the interaction itself (Reitz and
Wing 1999:7). The uses to which humans put animals and their physical constituents and
the diverse ways by which those constituents enter the archaeological record are part of
what Reed (1963) termed the "cultural filter." This filter is a specialized aspect in the
study of taphonomy, the transition of organic matter from faunal remains through its
history of post-mortem, pre-burial, and post-burial changes to incorporation in the
geological record (Hesse and Wapnish 1985; Lyman 1994a:1-3, Figure 2.5; Meadow
1981).
The ways culture has affected faunal material in archaeological sites and its
recovery are subject to zooarchaeological study. Lyman (1994a:4) distinguishes two
41

types of fossil faunas from archaeological sites: archaeofaunas spatially associated with
cultural materials, and paleontological faunas that are not. This is the major research
emphasis of the past two decades (Avery 1984, Binford 1981, Potts 1984, Turner 1984).
Modern cultural behavior affects the taphonomic process through excavation
techniques and analytical strategies selected for use by the analyst, including theoretical
orientation. This analytical behavior subjects the archaeofaunal record to biases that can
be documented (Andrews and Cook 1985; Clark, et al. 1967; Hesse and Wapnish 1985;
Hill 1978; Meadow 1981).
Historical Development of Zooarchaeological Method and Theory
Zooarchaeology has evolved under multiple anthropological theories most
concerned with the relationship between human culture and the environment. Three most
common during the latter twentieth century have been most influential (Reitz and Wing
1999:13). Theoretical orientations prevalent in the early part of the twentieth century
limited faunal research contributions to lists of animals found in sites.
Under more recent anthropological theories, zooarchaeology has examined the
relationship between human culture and the environment. Cultural ecology, ecological
anthropology, and historical ecology have allowed full realization that this relationship is
dynamic and may result in significant changes to behaviors or institutions (Bates and
Lees 1996; Bogucki 1988; Butzer 1990; Clarke 1972; Ellen 1982; Geertz 1963; Jochim
1979, 1981:3-4; Moran 1990; Reitz and Wing 1999:14-15; Steward 1955; Vayda and
Rappaport 1968; Winterhalder 1994; Winterhalder and Smith 1992). Recent use of postprocessualist theory has brought into play perspectives that examine human behavior in
terms of native meaning, especially the critical role that animals play in human culture
(Hesse 1995; Hodder 1982, 1990; Leone and Potter 1988; Ryan and Crabtree 1995).

42

Bone’s role in explanations of culture has changed considerably. Clason (1973,
1986) notes that early Swiss researchers influenced later zooarchaeologists. Eaton (1898)
provided unquantified species lists, but also much more complete description and
interpretation of data on butchering and faunal distribution. Loomis and Young (1912)
quantified numbers of individuals in species lists and described the species recovered.
They hypothesized about dietary importance based on frequency and butchering pattern
data, inferred seasonality, described modified remains, and distinguished between
cultural and natural occurrences of species. Wyman (1868a, 1868b, 1875) voiced early
concerns about improving analytical approaches, echoing the concerns of Lartet (cf.
Clermont 1994) who demonstrated the value of including small animals in studies.
The concern of most early North American archaeologists in culture history
prevented advancement of zooarchaeological method and theory and found animal
remains to be insignificant (Barker 1985:4; Reitz and Wing 1999:18). Animal remains
from archaeological sites were studied more adequately elsewhere in the world. Most of
the resulting literature was published in biological literature, e.g. Wintemberg (1919),
Hargrave (1938), and van Giffen (cf. Clason 1983, 1986). These studies reported human
association with extinct animals (Eddy and Jinks 1935; Miller 1929a, 1929b). Biological
researchers working with North American archaeofaunas reviewed aspects of the
materials that included ecosystems, descriptions of the physical remains, exploitation of
age classes, hunting ranges, and seasonality (cf. Howard 1929).
Increasing procedural sophistication is addressed by more stress on recovery
techniques and curation of faunal remains (Weigelt 1989, Wintemberg 1919). Pioneering
zooarchaeologists sought accurate identification of specimens, improved recovery
methods, and appropriate measurements to properly interpret archaeofaunas (Clason
1983; Hargrave 1938; Howard 1929; Merriam 1928). Changes in anthropological theory
43

by Taylor (1948, the conjunctive approach) and Steward (1955, cultural ecology) stressed
cultural behavior and information about former lifeways inherent in artifacts. Based on
their work, interest in ecologically-based cultural adaptations rose dramatically (Reitz
and Wing 1999:20). The standard practice continued to be collecting unquantified
descriptions of unmodified faunal specimens that were relegated to brief appendices or
notes (Hadlock 1943; Tyzzer 1943; Webb 1959).
Taylor's (1948) definition of the conjunctive approach was a key step forward in
the development of zooarchaeological method and theory. Archaeologists had a sound
basis through which to interpret archaeofaunas. Zooarchaeology became more
recognizable as a field of study within archaeology and had a greater role in concerns
about site formation processes, methodology, and interpretation of sites (Reitz and Wing
1999:21). Sampling issues and the role of archaeofauna transformation through cultural
and natural processes were recognized as major concerns (Byers 1951; Dart 1957;
Efremov 1940; Parmalee 1957a, 1957b; White 1956).
In a series of methodological papers in the early 1950s, White (1952, 1953a,
1953b, 1954, 1955, 1956) established the importance of paleontological techniques to
estimate the minimum population represented by archaeological site collections. He also
advanced methods of reconstructing cultural butchering patterns by analyzing damage. A
major shift in emphasis to interpretation of meaning marked a more mature phase of
zooarchaeological endeavor (Lawrence 1957; Taylor 1957). Included in this emphasis on
interpretation were ecological reconstruction, dietary studies, and population size
estimation (Cook and Treganza 1947; Meighan, et al. 1958a, 1958b).
Theories that emphasized adaptive aspects of behavior dominated theoretical
discussions and archaeological practices during the late twentieth century (Willey and
Sabloff 1974:189). This is especially true in functionalist analyses of subsistence
44

strategies (Barker 1985:19-25; Dunnell 1986; Hesse 1995). Reflecting increased
emphasis on scientific process and empirical methods, including hypothesis testing,
zooarchaeology concentrated on general laws about the interaction between the
environment, humans, and their culture, including its technological component (Clarke
1968:38-42; Jochim 1981; Reitz and Wing 1999:22). The combination of ecological
principals with empirical data from archaeology was used to test cultural models.
During the latter twentieth century, explanatory mechanisms from processual
archaeology, ecological anthropology, and the large amounts of biotic data from research
projects combined to advance zooarchaeological study in the direction advocated by
Taylor (1948). Concepts emerged from the archaeological mainstream to become
dominant in zooarchaeological research. These concepts included the study of middlerange theory and the study of strategic decisions in culture's decisions concerning the
acquisition and allocation of resources through use of ecological and economic models
(Reitz and Wing 1999:23).
Middle-range theory is based on empirical, actualistic examination of technology,
subsistence, and settlement patterns in modern populations that allow the modern
processes and principles responsible for archaeological site formation to be used as
analogs to interpret prehistoric human behavior (Bettinger 1991:61-62; Binford 1977:6;
Grayson 1986; Raab and Goodyear 1984). Differentiating between natural and cultural
processes and their impacts on the archaeological record is fundamental to understanding
cultural behavior because the consequences of cultural behavior must be identified and
understood (Reitz and Wing 1999:23; Thomas 1971).

Archaeologists adapted

methodological and theoretical tools from within anthropology and other disciplines to
accomplish these goals. Behavioral archaeology and ethnoarchaeology both originated
from this need for actualistic studies to base archeological theory on (Gould 1978;
45

Schiffer 1976). Binford’s (1980) polar distinction between ends of a cultural continuum
described by different combinations of settlement patterns and technologies formed the
basis for these studies.
Site formation processes are often equated with middle-range theory and guided
the interest of influential geo-archaeological studies (Bettinger 1991:77-82; GiffordGonzales 1991; Kroll and Price 1991:310; Thomas 1986). Evaluations of sample sizes,
methodologies, and taphonomy emerged, especially concerning cultural decisions about
butchering of animal carcasses and dispersal of products from those carcasses.
Wintemberg (1919) presaged consideration of such topics much earlier. Thomas and
Mayer (1983:Figure 188) considered the cultural value placed on animal carcasses versus
the transportation costs between kill/butchering sites and other sites where most
consumption occurs.
Other middle-range theories focus on regional analyses, including site catchment
and site location (Bettinger 1991:66; Gamble 1984; Higgs and Vita-Finzi 1972). Such
analyses investigate areas and resources thought to be most used by inhabitants of an
existing settlement or archaeological site, often conceptualizing economic behavior
between centers on a local (gravity model) or regional scale (central-place model)
(Crumley 1979). Adaptive strategies and distribution of resources based on least effort
are the usual subjects considered by such analyses.
Decisions involving budgets of resources that arise from all aspects of human
behavior form the basis of game theory (Clarke 1968:43, 73, 85, 90; Earle and
Christenson 1980). Beyond those concerned with nutrition, decisions investigated by
game theory involve prestige, raw materials for technology, land, time, energy, or
specialized knowledge and skills. Such decisions are patterned solutions that have

46

multiple outcomes, such as a reduction in labor, increased yield of raw materials, or
lower risk (Clarke 1968:45-53; 1972).
The competing optimality model is based on an assumption that foraging
decisions that characterize human diets are based on an on-going analysis of the costs and
benefits of procurement (cf. Hawkes and O’Connell 1981; Perlman 1980; Smith and
Winterhalder 1992; Thomas 1986; Winterhalder 1987; Winterhalder, et al. 1988).
Theorists using optimality believe that human beings make rational decisions when
foraging to maximize the net rate of energy captured (Bettinger 1991:84; Jochim 1981:910). A well-known component of optimal foraging theory is diet breadth. Winterhalder
(1981) compares resource abundance, individual energy produced by each resource,
amount of energy needed to obtain each through search or pursuit, and amount of energy
needed to ready each resource for consumption.
Also important in zooarchaeological development since 1960 have been contract
research programs due to the large amounts of data that they have provided. Statutory
requirements to include archaeological research in land-altering projects have fostered
contract research programs termed cultural resource management (CRM) in the United
States.

CRM programs often have limited objectives, use emergency recovery

procedures, and have only short project duration with limited data recovery. The sheer
number of CRM projects has added large amounts of data with a concentration on
subsistence, site function, seasonality, and economic studies in research designs (Reitz
and Wing 1999:27).
The three most prevalent current research orientations in zooarchaeology are
concerned with anthropological research, methodological research, and biological
research. Methodological research in zooarchaeology centers on understanding how
first-order changes in archaeological deposits and materials originate from biotic and
47

abiotic processes, including cultural decisions (Lyman 1994a; Reitz and Wing 1999:28).
Other emphases stress an understanding of second-order changes induced by research
strategies, collection methods, and specimen identification procedures in order to
determine the biases that affect the interpretation of collections (Payne 1972). An
increasingly quantitative approach to evaluating these changes has been used over the
past two decades (Grayson 1984; Reitz and Wing 1999:28).
Theoretical research stressing both anthropological and biological perspectives
has also become more important in zooarchaeology during the past two decades. The
anthropological perspective in zooarchaeology has been concerned with relationship
between humans and animals. Much of the concern has centered on causes for continuity
and change in ecological and economic aspects of human behavior (cf. Brewer 1992).
Subsistence behaviors obtain foodstuffs to directly meet human biological needs for
specific dietary requirements and meet other, more cultural needs (Reitz and Wing
1999:28).
ARCHEOLOGICAL STUDIES OF BONE MODIFICATION
The potential time depth in most archaeofaunas lends utility to their use in
studying a varied suite of theoretical problems and technical issues. Their utility has led
to use in investigating problems that span almost the complete range of human evolution
(Lyman 1994a:306). An examination of the processing of fauna into consumable parts,
specifically by butchering is incorporated into most current research. Lyman (1987a:251252) labels butchering as a singularly human trait. Other researchers have included study
of modifications that reflect deliberate fracturing of bone. Bone fracture research has
been shrouded in controversy since Dart (1957) proposed this as a mechanism for the
cause of breakage in African Plio-Pleistocene faunal materials.
48

Archaeological Studies of Human Butchering Behaviors
Two researchers were most influential in the application of methodologies to
investigate remnants of human butchering in the archaeological record (Lyman
1994a:306). The first of these is Shipman (1981a, 1981b, 1983, 1986a, 1986b, 1987,
1988; Potts and Shipman 1981).

She used scanning electron microscopy (SEM)

techniques to identify butchering-induced cut marks on bones recovered from PlioPleistocene aged cultural strata at Olduvai I sites. Bunn and Kroll (1986:436; cf. also
Bunn 1981, 1982, 1983) built upon Shipman’s methods. Bunn’s addition was that
frequency distributions for cut marks must make anatomical sense to have meaning for
patterned human behaviors of carcass skinning, joint disarticulation, and defleshing.
Documenting Systematic Butchering
Shipman’s research led to critical assumptions that:
a) near-joint cut marks relate to disarticulation,
b) cut marks on meaty bones relate to defleshing and/or filleting of meat from a
carcass,
c) cut marks on metapodial skeletal elements from the site’s artiodactyls relate to
skinning, and
d)

an analogue for a systematic butchering pattern may be found in the
frequency of near-joint and mid-shaft loci on meaty vs. non-meaty bones
contained in a control.

Her analytical methods using frequency distributions of cut marks across
anatomical loci were a revolutionary shift from contemporary practices (Lyman
1994a:307).
Bunn and Kroll’s work led to inferences that:

49

a) abundant cut marks on limb bones with more plentiful meat indicate that
larger quantities of meat were removed from those elements,
b) bones with plentiful meat have a higher proportion of cut marks in small to
medium mammals than in large mammals,
c) ruminant metapodials with cut marks reflect skinning, and
d) cut marks at mid-shaft loci reflect defleshing through removal of muscle
masses at their insertion points on the bone.
Significant variation in the location and orientation of near-joint cut marks may
reflect how long after an animal’s death it has been broken into consumable components
(Lyman 1987a:263-265, 1987b:711). Separation into consumable components, often by
disarticulation, may occur through human butchering or scavenging (Binford 1981).
Bunn (1983; Bunn and Kroll 1986) suggests that a thorough and systematic
butchering process was applied to ruminants on the basis of the frequency distributions of
proportions of cut marks across different anatomical loci. Human butchers removed
significant amounts of meat (Bunn 1983; Bunn and Kroll 1986). Binford (1988:127) is
critical of this position. He notes that the frequency of cut marks not reflecting
disarticulation is a function of a differential investment by the butcher in removing issue
from the carcass. Bunn and Kroll’s (1988:144) reply that a simple comparison of cut
mark frequencies among skeletal elements and animal size groups cannot be the sole
basis for establishing the amount of meat present on a carcass when it was butchered.
Their inference about frequencies at Olduvai Gorge are similar to those in much later
analogues where cut marks indicate removal of significant amounts of meat from skeletal
elements, such as those reported by Gifford, et al. (1980) and Marshall (1986).
Lyman’s (1994:310-314) review of this debate notes alternatives that were
previously not examined. More critically examining the statistics, he notes that the
50

proportion of cut marked bone is not significantly different between size classes and
suggests that both were intensively butchered. He also finds no correlation between the
total number of identified specimens per anatomical category and the proportion of cut
marked specimens per anatomical category for either size class. The proportion of cut
marked bones is not a function of sample size. There are differences in the manner in
which size classes were butchered when there is a direct correlation between the
frequency of cut marked bones and butchered bones.
Lyman (1994a:311-312) tested Bunn and Kroll’s (1986) conclusion about limb
bones with more plentiful meat versus those with less meat. He made the assumption that
metapodials contain less meat than more proximal limb elements such as the humerus,
radius-ulna, femur, and tibia. He found no significant difference in the proportional
frequencies of cut marked metapodials, but significant differences in the proportions for
cut marked proximal limb elements. Lyman’s analysis included a stratification of the cut
mark data based on more precise anatomical position that included the specific skeletal
element articulation which cut marks were related to. The significant differences relate to
a more frequent butchery of small bovid knee joints and large bovid tibiae.
Lyman (1994a:313) directly examined Binford’s (1981, 1988) positions on joint
tightness versus proportion of cut marks and the relative food utility of various elements.
He found no significant correlation. Frequencies of cut marked elements should also be
compared to frequencies of elements modified by fracture. His rationale for suggesting
this was that the food utility may reflect the importance of marrow and bone grease, in
addition to meat, and may reflect deliberate fracture to obtain these products. Lupo
(1998) investigated extraction rates for marrow in modern members of the horse and deer
families, but noted that strategies for retrieval of marrow had implications for interpreting
earlier hominid scavenging behavior.

North American Application
Many aspects of basic human behaviors, such as butchering, were transmitted to
humans that colonized the Americas during the late Pleistocene. Rancorous debate
surrounded the question of interpreting bone tools from the Old Crow Basin of northwest
Canada (Binford 1981; Bonnichsen 1977, 1978, 1979; Frison 1970, 1974; Haynes 1981;
Johnson 1976, 1982; Miller and Dort 1978; Tatum and Shutler 1980; Wheat 1979).
Some of the debate examined the concepts of modification of bone by natural agents,
such as carnivores or weathering, vs. butchering and other types of culturally-induced
bone modification (Johnson 1985:201).
Butchery goes beyond Russell’s (1987:386) notion of its goal being only to
“remove meat”. His definition was more restrictive than Binford’s (1978) earlier
definition (Lyman 1994a:295). Binford’s (1978:63) explanation of butchery recognized
broader goals to partition a carcass into component parts through activities that happen
between killing of prey and its final consumption or discard. These activities include
dismemberment, skinning, defleshing, and other actions to remove, distribute, and use
carcass components. Binford (1978:63) uses the term “sets of bones” for component parts
produced by butchering. These parts should be archaeologically visible as results of an
extraction process yielding muscle, skin, and fat products (Lyman 1994a:295).
Lyman (1987a:252) defines behaviors and results of hominid butchery.
Behaviors are labeled as butchering processes or techniques. Results are defined as the
butchering pattern. The butchering process does not include cooking or consumption.
However, several stages of butchering may occur, including further post-cooking
reduction of carcass components into smaller portions.
North American zooarchaeology adopted a new perspective incorporating the
research results of Shipman and her associates. Most appropriate were the results
52

concerned with the anatomical location and characteristics of marks left behind by cutting
tools used during carcass processing, especially signatures of stone tools. Precedents for
this perspective are found in the work of Guilday, et al. (1962).
An increased knowledge and use of taphonomy by Shipman and her associates
(cf. Bunn 1981, 1982; Olsen 1988; Potts 1982; Potts and Shipman 1981; Shipman 1981a,
1981b; 1983, 1986a, 1986b, Shipman and Rose 1983a, 1983b; Shipman, et al. 1981;
Walker and Long 1977), Bonnichsen (1979), and Morlan (1980) also occurred.
Application of taphonomic principles led to suggestion of alternative mechanisms for
producing similar scratches on fresh bone that were clearly known to be possible. Ways
were sought to distinguish between cultural and natural agencies, including trampling and
tooth marking by carnivores or rodents (Behrensmeyer, et al. 1986, 1989; Eickhoff and
Hermann 1985; Fiorillo 1989; Gibert and Jimenez 1991; Haynes 1993; Haynes and
Stanford 1984; Lyman 1987a; Marean and Bertino 1994; Noe-Nygaard 1989; Schmitt
and Juell 1994; Shipman and Rose 1984).
Replication of similar anatomical placement of marks on multiple specimens has
developed into a measure of primary importance in distinguishing between culturallyinduced marks and those produced by natural agencies. Guilday, et al. (1962:63)
suggested that cut-marks related to butchery or skinning should have a detectable purpose
for their location on an animal’s anatomy, such as dismemberment or muscle removal.
This second criterion relates to an idea of efficiency in butchering or skinning that results
in functions for each mark (Lyman 1994a:298).
Binford (1984b:247) distinguishes between cut-marks made for disarticulation,
skinning, and filleting or meat removal. Skinning leaves cut-marks on distal portions of
the extremities, the lower margins of the mandible, and on the skull. Disarticulation cutmarks are considered to be limited to articular surfaces of long bones or their edges and
53

the surfaces of vertebrae and portions of the pelvis. Filleting or meat removal leaves
marks parallel to the long axis of skeletal elements (Binford 1984b:247).
Zooarchaeologists currently record the location and orientation of cut-marks.
Hammerstones were used to break bones for various purposes, including marrow and
bone grease removal, but have also been used both to detach muscle masses at their
insertion point on bones (Blumenschine and Selvaggio 1988, 1991; Bunn 1982:44;
Lyman 1994a:298, 1995:236-240; Morlan 1980:50; Potts 1982, 1988). In use as a
butchering tool, hammerstones also left distinctive marks.
Subsidiary activities damaging bones occur during butchering and including
removal of viscera or blood vessels and extraction of brain, marrow, grease, periosteum,
and sinew tissues (Lyman 1987a). Butchery is divided into a series of cumulative stages
due to the complexity of the process (Lyman 1987a). These discrete stages include killbutchery (primary butchery) prior to possible transport, secondary butchery (usually at
the site of consumption), and final butchery-consumption. His expectation is that bones
from later stages in this process may exhibit more cut-marks than those from earlier
stages because they are subjected to more butchery activities (Lyman 1994a:300).
Archaeofaunal remains rarely represent consumption byproducts at kill-butchery
sites. Kill-butchery remains are identifiable because they are less fragmented (Lyman and
O’Brien 1987). Sites later in the butchery process have more consumption byproducts
present because more subsidiary activities may have occurred (Lyman 1987a). This
positioning later in butchery results in more intensive processing of the carcass, which
may yield more bone fragmentation and reduce identification of specimens.
Zooarchaeologists assume the frequencies of bones exhibiting evidence of butchery are
positively correlated with the frequencies of butchered bones and represent unambiguous
quantitative indicators of human butchering behaviors (Lyman 1994a:302-303). This
54

theoretical assumption has not been borne out in ethnoarchaeological research yet, but it
has led to methodology for quantifying evidence of marks left by carcass processing
which differs from that used to determine taxonomic abundance (Lyman 1994a:304).
Varying frequencies of skeletal elements allowed an inference that bighorn sheep
from Horizon 2 at Gatecliff Shelter represented a later stage of butchery than other
portions of the site’s archaeofauna (Thomas and Mayer 1983). Transport logistics
involved in moving products of kills towards the site of final butchery and consumption
have an effect on both the specifics of butchery operations used in any situation and the
resulting damage evident on the bones remaining in the collection studied. Binford (1978,
1984b) identifies these influencing effects determining how an animal carcass is
butchered and transported as contingency factors.
Various measures have been used to express the relationship between
archaeofaunas and the original collection of live animals represented by them. Among
these measures are the number of identified specimens per taxon (NISP, an observational
unit) and the minimum number of individuals necessary to account for an analytically
specified set of faunal remains (MNI, an analytical unit). Both of these are widely used,
quantitative units. MNI and NISP may refer to either complete specimens (including
skeletal elements) or analytically specified portions of them, including fragments (Lyman
1994a:100-101). To estimate the more complex MNI measure for each taxon, element,
symmetry (side), age, sex, size of individual, and archaeological context are analyzed for
the most numerous complete element.
Other quantifiable units have assumed major roles in recent taphonomic analysis
and represent a refinement in how frequencies of skeletal elements are enumerated
(Lyman 1994a:102). The minimum number of elements (MNE) was defined to measure
portions of skeletons by analytically specified anatomical units to allow frequencies of
55

partial skeletal elements to be quantified (Binford 1984a; Bunn and Kroll 1988; Grayson
1984; Hesse and Wapnish 1985; Potts 1988). The anatomical units used in MNE may
include fragmentary skeletal elements. As with MNI, MNE may account for observed
differences in age, sex, and probable body build of the original animals. The MNE
estimate more specifically allows reconstruction of the number of whole elements from
identified specimens, allowing butchering units to be defined (Lyman 1994b:290).
The ratio between NISP and MNE may be used to measure the degree of
fragmentation of enumerated skeletal elements, so the method of how MNE values are
derived from specimens is of interest. Marean and Spencer (1991:649-650) define two
methods of computing MNE values, one of them similar to a summed percentage method
used by Klein and Cruz-Uribe (1984). Bunn and Kroll (1986, 1988) provide three
methods to derive MNE values, based on the number of articular ends and limb bone
diaphyses present. Lyman’s (1994a:104) critical observation that the zooarchaeologist
must explicitly identify the criteria used to derive the MNE values is wise given the
variety of methods in use.
The distribution of cultural modifications such as cut-marks relates to carcass
processing behaviors that damage skeletal elements on which cut-marks or other physical
indicators are located (Lyman 1987a; Maltby 1985a, 1985b). Clusters of adjacent cutmarks are often recorded as an aggregate (cf. Lyman 1987a, 1992, 1995). Recording and
interpretation requires accounting for taphonomic and diagenetic factors that destroy
bone surfaces that might have exhibited cultural modifications. Factors may include
weathering, destruction by scavengers or carnivores, root etching, and other physical
stresses which remove evidence of cultural modification by altering the surface of the
bone (Lyman 1994a:306). Positive evidence of surface alteration by other means

56

correlates just to the absence of butchering damage at any particular anatomical location,
not to negative evidence of it (Lyman 1994a:306).
Evidence for carcass processing is highly variable and complicated by the fact
that it occurs under variable physical circumstances that alter methods used and the
resulting evidence. Binford (1984a:110-112) notes that these circumstances may have
varied from immediately after death (e.g. when fresh and supple), several days old (e.g.
slightly to substantially desiccated and stiffened by rigor mortis), or after being exposed
to high latitude winter conditions (e.g. frozen for several months).
Archaeological Studies of Human Animal Bone Processing
Dart’s (1957) claim that the Plio-Pleistocene Makapansgat fauna contained
specimens that had been deliberately fractured by hominids in ways which left behind
distinctive signatures touched off a significant controversy (Brain 1989; Hill 1976;
Maguire, et al. 1980; Read 1971; Read-Martin and Read 1975; Shipman and Phillips
1976; Shipman and Phillips-Conroy 1977; Wolberg 1970). Controversies surrounded
later claims for similar types of phenomena in North America (Bonnichsen 1973, 1979;
Haynes 1983; Irving and Harrington 1973; Irving, et al. 1989; Johnson 1983, 1985;
Lyman 1984a; Miller 1969, 1975; Morlan 1980, 1983, 1984, 1988; Sadek-Kooros 1972,
1975). Both controversies involve questions about whether animal bones deliberately
broken by humans may be distinguished from those broken by other physical means,
including carnivores and non-biological causes. Determining the cause of specific cases
of animal bone breakage requires knowledge of the physical nature of bone and how
specific agents act to of break bone.
Synopsis of the Physical Structure of Bone
Bone is a composite, two-phase material made up of hydroxyapatite mineral
crystals contained in an organic matrix (Currey 1984:26; Francillon-Viellot, et al.
57

1990:515; Lyman 1994a:72; Meinke 1979). The crystals are elongated hexagon in shape
(Sinkakas 1964:416). Hydroxyapatite is a highly diverse suite of hydrous calcium
phosphate compounds that contain minor amounts of other inorganic elements. Chemical
additions to hydroxyapatite affect the stability of bone during life and subsequent
diagenesis (Carlson 1990:531). The organic matrix is about 30 per cent of bone’s weight
and is made of long fibers of the structural protein collagen.
Hydroxyapatite resists compression forces, conferring rigidity and hardness, while
collagen resists tension forces and confers toughness, resiliency, and elasticity
(Hildebrand 1974:96; Lyman 1994a:72; Romer and Parsons 1977:150). The long axis of
the hydroxyapatite crystals is aligned with the much longer collagen fibers. The crystals
occur both within the collagen fibers and surrounding them (Currey 1984:26). Bone
serves as a metabolic reservoir for many minerals, and continually exchanges them with
the soft tissues. Variations in chemical concentrations affect the bone’s physical
characteristics (de Rousseau 1988:95; MacGregor 1985).
Bony tissue may be formed by replacement of existing cartilage, the formation for
endochondral bone (Lyman 1994a:73). This type of bone is divided during growth and
development of long bones in young vertebrates into three distinct parts, ends (epiphyses)
and a central shaft (diaphysis). Each is a center of ossification during ontogenetic
development. Cartilages separate the three growth zones. Fusion of the growth zones
into one skeletal element signals the onset of adulthood in mammals. A membranous
sheath termed the periosteum covers the exterior of nearly all portions of bones except
the articulations. Long bone growth occurs both in length and circumference, with
successive layers of compact bone deposited around the exterior of the diaphysis during
growth (Lyman 1994a:73).

58

Bony tissue has a complex structure (Wainright, et al. 1976:Figure 5.14). On a
microscopic scale, it is divided into cells that deposit bone material (osteoblasts) and
those that remodel bone once adulthood is reached (osteoclasts) (Lyman 1994a:73). The
interior cavities of some endochondral bones are lined with the endosteal membrane,
similar to the periosteum (Lyman 1994a:74). A dendritic network of small canals that
contain blood vessels exists within the compact bone and delivers nutrients. This
network is the Haversian canals and also contains nerves. Surrounding each Haversian
canal is a major element of bony tissue structure termed the osteon (Wainright, et al.
1976:Figure 5.14). Osteons are roughly cylindrical layers of compact bone lamellae.
While the osteons are parallel to the long axis of bones, alignments of collagen fibrils and
hydroxyapatite crystals vary between lamellae (Lyman 1994a:74). Linking the Haversian
canals within each osteon are radiating blood vessels). Osteons are bonded to each other
by chemical cement.
Mammalian compact bone may be deposited as lamellae, woven, or parallelfibered forms (Currey 1984:26-27). The earliest bony tissue to be formed is woven bone
deposited when the animal is developing in utero or when bone fractures are being
repaired in older individuals. Random orientation of fine collagen fibrils and
hydroxyapatite crystals and presence of irregular trabeculae or struts distinguish woven
bone (MacGregor 1985:4).

Extensive spaces around blood vessels also are a

characteristic of woven bone. Lamellar bony tissue forms slowly and has collagen and
hydroxyapatite crystals arranged in layers or lamellae (Currey 1984; Meinke 1979).
Collagen fibers are grouped within lamellae. The orientation of groups may vary
between adjacent lamellae. Parallel-fibered bony tissue is rare, but intermediate in
structure between lamellar and woven bone. Each type of bone contains small cavities

59

pervading the structure of the bones; these are termed lacunae. Blood vessels in all three
are contained within canaliculi, or small channels that extend through the bone.
Currey (1984:28-29) also notes that four types of bone exist on a more general
structural scale; woven bone, lamellar bone, Haversian system lamellar bone, and
fibrolamellar bone. Lamellar bone extends around the outside surface of mammalian long
bone as circumferential lamellae. Haversian system lamellar bone forms on a localized
scale where new bone is deposited by osteoblasts in concentric layers at the outer
boundaries of the cavities surrounding blood vessels. These vary considerably in layout,
but all contain a cement layer with very few penetrations, effectively isolating the
surrounding bone metabolically from the Haversian system (Currey 1984:29).
Fibrolamellar bone, also known as laminar bone, has characteristics of both woven and
lamellar bone. It forms in large mammals where long bones grow quickly in diameter.
Woven bone rapidly is built into a framework then filled in by lamellar bone, creating
alternating layers of woven and lamellar bone (Currey 1984:29; MacGregor 1985:5).
Using these components, skeletal elements exhibit structural characteristics that
contain several different types of bony tissue (Lyman 1994a:76). Compact bone is found
in the diaphysis of long bones in mammals and birds, made of lamellar, fibrolamellar,
and Haversian system lamellar bone. The diaphysis also contains an internal space, the
medullary cavity that contains marrow, a softer, fat-rich tissue in mammals. In birds, the
diaphysis is thinner walled and the medullary cavity may contain calcium used for eggshell production (MacGregor 1985:8). The epiphyses of birds and mammal long bones
contain cancellous or spongy bone made up of trabeculae interspersed with marrow. Fish,
reptiles, and amphibian bones are different. Amphibian bone is compact and lacks
Haversian systems, as does the bone in most lizards and snakes (Enlow 1969:45, 47). A
limited amount of cancellous trabeculae exists in mid-diaphysis in lizards (Enlow
60

1969:62-63). Turtle shells are specialized elements that have an inner cancellous layer
bounded by vascularized compact, lamellar bone (Zangerl 1969:313). Teleost fish bones
lack osteocytes (Currey 1984; Enlow 1969; Lyman 1994a).
The amount and distribution of cancellous and compact types of bony tissue in
individual skeletal elements depends on the structure and function of the element (Romer
and Parsons 1977:151). Anatomists recognize several basic shapes of skeletal elements
(Currey 1984:36; Davis 1987:47; Micozzi 1991:54). Long bones are typically tubular in
shape with an elongated shape, roughly circular cross section, and expanded ends; they
include ribs, limb bones, the mandible, and the human clavicle. Tabular or flat bones are
flattened and include the bones of the pelvis, scapula, and portions of the skull vault.
Short bones include phalanges, carpals, tarsals, metacarpals, and metatarsals. Irregular
bones include vertebrae, many skull bones, the hyoid, and the patella.
Antler and horn are hard tissues that are also part of the exoskeleton (MacGregor
1985:19). The keratinous sheath of horn grows around a vascular bony core. The horn
core develops as a separate center of ossification which later fuses permanently with the
bones of the skull (Goss 1983:67). Antler is a seasonally growing hard tissue structurally
similar to bone that originates within a specialized skin covering the frontal bone of the
skull in the deer family (Cervidae). It is often branched into tines and consists of
compact woven bone encasing a cancellous central core which is smaller or absent near
the tips of the tines (Goss 1983:57; MacGregor 1985:12-13). Antlers are shed annually.
Bone Biomechanics
Bone breaks when force exceeding the material’s tensile strength is applied to it
(Evans 1961:110-111; Johnson 1985, 1989). Loss of moisture within the bone’s structure
changes the manner of failure. In the living state and immediately after an animal’s
death, bone is ductile and responds to mechanical force by deforming prior to structural
61

failure (Evans 1973; Johnson 1985:161). Moisture escapes from the bone’s structure after
death and causes a more brittle response to mechanical force because the bone is harder,
stiffer, less elastic, less able to absorb stress, and permanently deforms when strained
(Amprino 1958; Evans 1961, 1973; Hayes and Carter 1979). Thermal alteration of bone
makes the bone less ductile by removing moisture from the bone’s structure. Thermal
alteration results in decreased compressive and tensile strengths, reduced elasticity, and
increased bone hardness and microhardness (Frankel and Burstein 1967; McElhaney
1966; McElhaney and Byars 1965; Sedlin 1965). A direct result of post-mortem moisture
loss is that the physical bonds between adjacent osteons and lamellae are reduced to
failure.
Bone breakage in structural failure may be due to a biomechanical response to
forces that create stress-strain relationships. Three types of force exist: tension,
compression, and shear (Evans 1961:110). Tension pulls two portions of a body apart.
Compression refers to those that act to push them together. Shear is the force that acts to
slide adjacent parts in opposite directions.
The way an element resists forces determines its ability to resist structural failure
and fracturing. Bone from living animals or fresh carcasses has a completely hydrated
structural matrix that will deform plastically unless micro-cracking is initiated that begins
all subsequent fractures (Johnson 1985:168). Bone will absorb large amounts of stress
without fracturing, but irreversible microscopic deformation occurs cumulatively
(Bonefield and Li 1966:874). Micro-cracking begins at the in cement lines surrounding
osteons (Evans 1973). Larger cracks amplify the damage (Bird and Becker 1966;
Sweeny, et al. 1965).
Long bones undergo stress-strain conditions under four variations of force loading
(Evans 1952:265, 1973; Johnson 1985:170). Concentrically applied forces compress the
62

element in parallel with the element’s diaphysis. Eccentrically applied forces load the
element off-center with the element’s long axis, bending it and producing both
compressive and tensile stress and strain. Loading the element perpendicular to its long
axis also bends the element. Finally, a torsional or twisting force applied to an end of the
element results in tensile and shear stress and strain. Loading may occur over a broad
area of the bone, or as a force concentrated in a much smaller point. Force may be
applied either a statically (constant) or dynamically (suddenly).
Bone fractures when dynamic loading exceeds the element’s tensile strength
(Evans 1961:114). Twisting of long bones during dynamic loading produces shear and
tensile failure. Fractures begin at the point of highest tensile strain on the exterior of the
bone (Evans 1957; Herrmann and Liebowitz 1972:808). The fracture and resulting
fragment morphology are affected by the dynamic interaction between the force
applicator, fracture dynamics, and bone structure (Bonnichsen 1979:43; Johnson
1985:170). Stress waves discharge kinetic energy. They are released during initial
application of force and later in the fracture process. Stress waves influence movement of
fracture fronts and affect the fragmentation of bone elements where fracture fronts
intersect (Bonnichsen 1979:15). They also initiate micro-features that determine the
appearance of resulting fracture surfaces. The epiphyses of long bones reflect and diffuse
stress waves due to the presence of trabecular bone. Fracture fronts in fully hydrated
bone from living or freshly dead animals will not crosscut epiphyseal ends (Bonnichsen
1979:43).
The morphology of long bones resists bending (Johnson 1985:171). M most long
bones are hollow tubes with bending strength that exceeds tensile strength of the
diaphysis (Hayes and Carter 1979:278). Bending strength and stress are important if a
long bone is subjected to eccentric or perpendicular force during dynamic loading
63

(Johnson 1985:171). Bending stress combines compressive, tensile, and shear stresses,
each acting on a different portion of the diaphysis during this type of dynamic loading.
The magnitude of stress and strain of each type is higher at the surface (Evans 1961:112,
1973:26-27; Hayes and Carter 1979:278).
When the elastic limit is exceeded, bending of a long bone produces crushing at
the impact point prior to any tensile failure. Torsional rotation or twisting occurs if the
epiphyseal ends are not immobilized. Shearing occurs along a helical course inclined at
45˚ to the skeletal element’s long axis at the point where shearing and tensile stresses are
equal (Evans 1973:20-21). This produces spiral or, more properly, helical fractures.
Structural failure is first evident on the side experiencing tensile stress, but is preceded by
localized failure on both sides (Carter and Hayes 1977; Hayes and Carter 1979).
Analysis of the Archeological Record
Taphonomists have typically concentrated on morphology of fractures (Davis
1985; Lyman 1994a:318). Many agents that produce similar morphologies may break
bone during life and soon after death. Zooarchaeologists and other taphonomists have
developed analytical tools to determine the timing and causative agents for bone
fractures. These aid identification of human agency involved (Lyman 1994a:318-324).
Davis (1985) recognized eight factors concerning the fracture of complete skeletal
elements. These were:
1) the physical size of the taxon represented does not influence bone fracture
patterns when taxa are sorted by live weight of the animal represented;
2) gross morphology or macro-structural differences between skeletal elements
determine fracture locations and underlie differences in cross-sectional
thickness of cortical bone between elements and the presence of anatomical
features such as crests (Davis 1985:94);
64

3) micro-structural differences between elements exert influences on fracture
form due to different alignments of osteons and the collagen bundles and
hydroxyapatite crystals that compose them (Davis 1985:97);
4) the effects of increased weathering on the physical structure of elements being
fractured are reflected in a reduced proportion of fracture morphologies
typically encountered in fresh bone;
5) differences in resulting fracture morphologies result from bone being
subjected to static loading vs. dynamic loading (Davis 1985:108);
6) the inherent structural properties of bone result in expectation of a high
percentage of oblique or spiral fractures in any assemblage (Davis 1985:29);
7) oblique, spiral, or helical fractures will occur with higher than expected
frequencies under static or torsional loading and lower than expected
frequencies under dynamic loading due to the inherent differences in strain
rates between these loading types (Davis 1985:133); and
8) fractures produced under dynamic loading are more likely to have rounded
distal ends.
Johnson (1985:172) uses characteristics of fracture location, fracture front,
surface, and shape to discuss the attributes of bone breakage. Discussion centers on the
anatomical location for the break, the direction in which the fracture front proceeded, the
cross-section of the bone that failed, and the plan-view configuration of the bone. Most
bone fracture is too ambiguous to identify agents involved in breakage (Marshall 1989;
Shipman, et al. 1981). Taxon size is a definite factor in bone fracture and should be a
major component in comparing faunal collections in attempting to determine the
causative agent (Shipman, et al. 1981:259). This is a logical conclusion, given the micro-

65

structural differences between taxa (Lyman 1994a:318). Agreement exists about the
relationship of the moisture content of bone to performance when fracture is initiated.
Examples of fracture type typologies Marshall (1989:14, Figure 1), building on
the work of Shipman, et al. (1981). He accounted for eight types of fractures, including:
1. stepped/columnar,
2. saw-toothed,
3. V-shaped,
4. flaked,
5. irregular/perpendicular,
6. smooth/perpendicular,
7. spiral, and
8. longitudinal.

Johnson’s key (1985:176) differentiates between fractures occurring within living
bone, long after death, and during diagenesis. This typology uses color of the bone
cortex and fracture surface, fracture texture, and the fracture angle at the cortical surface.
Johnson’s (1985) work includes weathering of bone in its description of fractures. It
differentiates between types of spiral fractures, separating Shipman’s (1981b) two
variants of spiral fractures (Type I and Type II) because they actually have different
causes. Shipman’s Type I spiral fracture is a horizontal tension failure occurring in
desiccated bone not from a fresh kill (Johnson 1985:174-176). Shipman’s Type II spiral
fracture is a true spiral or helical fracture from an animal that is a relatively fresh kill
because the surface of the fracture is rough when the break occurs during life or very
soon after death. When the surface of fractures is smooth, desiccation and slight
weathering is indicated. More intense weathering results in split-line cracks that may
66

interfere with the fracture front, producing stepped, longitudinal, and
smooth/perpendicular fracture types.
More intensive study of human-induced bone breakage in the archaeological
record and in actualistic research has been conducted in recent decades. The research
removed many earlier misconceptions that physical features of fractures could be used
solely to determine the agent responsible for the fracture (Bonnichsen and Will 1980;
Dart 1957; Haynes 1983, 1993; Johnson 1985; Lyman 1984a, 1994a:324; Zierhut 1967).
Determining agency for bone breakage requires study of bone fracture features and the
surface of the fragments themselves (Johnson 1985:175). Deliberate breakage of bone by
humans for marrow or bone grease retrieval and tool manufacture may be distinguished
from other fracture causes. Competing agents include carnivore and rodent activities,
sub-aerial weathering, trampling, violent death through volcanic activity, falls, or other
catastrophic force, and post-deposition compression by overburden (Lyman 1994a:324325).
Removal of element epiphyses through mastication, scalloping of remaining
diaphysis edges, reduction of the diaphysis into splinters, punctures from small-diameter
loading points, and overall furrowing, scoring or pitting of the fragment surface are
marks which reflect carnivore activity-produced static loading (Johnson 1985:192;
Lyman 1994a:325). Dynamic loading used by humans leaves behind broader remnants of
point loading, percussion pits, or flake scars which indicates human agency for bone
breakage when used with spiral or helical fracturing, (Blumenschine and Selvaggio 1988,
1991; Johnson 1985:192; Lyman 1987a).
The absence of carnivore scoring – pitting damage or typically small loading
points and the presence of true spiral or helical fractures are the visual attributes most
used to indicate the presence of human-induced fractures (Lyman 1994a:326). Other
67

physical features may be present which are dependent on specific types of dynamic
loading used. A circular or oval depressed area with crushed bone or surrounding ring
cracks represents the point of impact. It will usually exhibit a semi-circular notch in the
outer cortical surface at the impact. Bone exhibits remnant fracture features (stress relief
hackle marks and ribs radiating outward form the loading point), interference features
(chattering and stepping), and wedge flakes where bending failure happens as the element
is flexed (Johnson 1985:194-197).
Zooarchaeological researchers examine a broad variety of physical features in
analyzing fracture patterns. Fracture types, proportion of fragmentary to whole elements,
extent and intensity of fragmentation, size of fragments and NISP:MNE ratios, and
identification of bone artifacts, are the more important measures used (Brink 1997;
Buehler 1997; Capaldo and Blumenschine 1994; Hill and Hofman 1997:63-83; Johnson
and Holliday 1997:337-348; Lyman 1994a:328-338; Marean and Bertino 1994; Quigg
1997:157-159; Schmitt and Lupo 1994; Silverstein 1980:503-504).
Interpretation has allowed conclusions about human behavior concerning prey
species, butchery activities, and products that resulted. Conclusions have included
seasonality of kills, possibility of communal hunting, butchery, or preparation of carcass
byproducts, age-structure and potential aggregate makeup of prey species (single animals
to herds of land mammals, schools of fish, etc.), the manufacture and short-term use of
bone tools during butchery, the manufacture of bone artifacts for long-term use
elsewhere, the pattern of butchery and degree to which carcasses were butchered or
scavenged, retrieval of marrow, rendering of bone for grease and other fatty byproducts
for later use, further processing of fresh meat for long-term storage (salting, drying,
smoking, incorporation with fat into pemmican, etc.), etc. (Brink and Dawe 1989;
Buehler 1997; Byrd 1997; Greenspan 1998; Hill and Hofman 1997:75-77; Hughes

Daeschler 1994; Speer 1978, Steele and Carlson 1989; Todd 1987). Used with data from
cultural features and other artifact classes, bone fracture data enable zooarchaeologists
more complete interpretations about behavior.
STUDIES OF MODERN ANIMAL BONE PROCESSING
For many decades, paleontologists, physical anthropologists and archaeologists
have studied modern conditions to directly observe how natural or cultural processes may
modify animal bone before and after burial and fossilization (Clark, et al. 1967; Haynes
1978, 1980, 1981, 1982, 1983, 1988a, 1988b, 1993; Haynes and Stanford 1984;
Lawrence 1968; Lyman 1994a; Müller 1951; Olson 1952, 1958; Voorhies 1969). Such
actualization studies involve direct observation and have often been approached from the
field of taphonomy. Elements of taphonomy originated within paleontology several
centuries ago (Lyman 1994a:17). These elements were included in a formal definition of
the field by German paleontologists in the early twentieth century (Cadée 1990:4-13;
Lyman 1994a:17; Rudwick 1976). German scholars viewed these studies as precursors
steps to fossilization. They were known variously as biostratonomie (now termed
biostratinomy), fossildiagenese (now termed diagenesis), or aktuo-paläontologie prior to
their inclusion in the current definition of taphonomy (Efremov 1940; Müller 1963;
Richter 1928; Weigelt 1989). Neotaphonomic studies are used within vertebrate
paleontology and physical anthropology to better understand the physical processes that
lead to the formation of paleontological localities. Taphonomy continues to grow in
sophistication and importance within paleontology (Allison and Briggs 1991; Briggs and
Crowther 1990; Donovan 1990; Lyman 1994a:20).
69

The archaeological interest is similarly directed towards the physical and cultural
processes affect how archaeological sites or localities are formed, especially those
processes that meet subsistence and technology needs. Dart’s (1949, 1956, 1957, 1960;
Hughes 1954) work was the major introduction to archaeological use of taphonomic
principles. His ideas served as a catalyst that spurred American interest in the subject.
One aspect of this strong archaeological interest in taphonomy is in documenting the
processes that affect culturally modified bone assemblages before and after deposition.
Archaeologists rapidly adopted a taphonomic perspective. In the process, they
conducted an increasingly large amount of ethnographic and actualistic research to aid
interpretation of their archaeological research. Among the more important for this
dissertation are the works of Bartram (1993); Behrensmeyer (1975a, 1975b, 1978, 1979,

Skinning, Butchering, and Dismemberment
Once secured, many vertebrate prey species require some form of additional
processing to be rendered useful. Some species are simply too large for immediate
consumption or transportation without such work. Usually, but not always, additional
processing will include removing viscera to control spoilage and to retrieve usable food
or other byproducts. Occasionally, hunter-gatherers will relocate to kill sites for the
duration of the kill-processing event. The potential for confrontations with large
carnivores intent on scavenging exists during carcass processing.
Beyond the initial evisceration, breaking down the prey carcass into more usable
component products usually first requires that its external covering be removed using
either fire (singeing) or cutting implements to pierce and remove the skin (de Graaf 1981;
Henshilwood 1997; Kent 1993:337-339). In the early 1970s, the Dassanetch of the Lake
Turkana area in eastern Africa, skinned small, goat-sized mammals before butchering
them (Gifford-Gonzales (1989a:185, Figure 3). Skinning was initiated by an incision on
the ventral midline, followed by a circumferential cut at the proximal end of the
metapodial that was extended up the leg’s inner surface to join the initial midline
incision. The skin was separated from the underlying muscle fascia without use of
cutting tools. Terrapins and other smaller reptiles were roasted whole by the Dassanetch
before butchery which removed the shells by prying or cutting apart to remove the
contents (Gifford-Gonzales 1989a: 187; Gifford-Gonzales, et al. 1999:431).

Large

reptiles, such as crocodiles, were skinned in a manner similar to mammals. The
Dassanetch prepared fish for consumption by removing external scales using either a
bone or metal tool (Gifford-Gonzales, et al. 1999:403, 423).
A small mammal-skinning pattern similar to that used by the Dassanetch and San
was used for small rodents among indigenous farm workers in South Africa
71

(Henshilwood 1997:661). An incision was made along the ventral midline and inner
margins of the hind legs prior to removal of the skin by hand. However, the skin of these
mole-rats was removed following roasting in coals, the skin having served as insulator
and cooking container. This is very similar to the procedures described for squirrels and
mongooses among the San in Botswana (Kent 1993:337).
Navaho pastoralists’ skinning and butchering practices currently used for
domestic sheep were documented by Binford and Bertram (1977:91-93). With the
carcass lying on its side on the ground, butchery was initiated by a ventral cut from the
sternum forward along the neck to the throat, followed by extension of the cut
posteriorally to the tail. Beginning on the forward legs, incisions were made up the
mesial side to the proximal articulation of the metacarpal where the lower leg, including
skin and metacarpals, is severed by a cut through the carpals. The rear legs were
butchered in a similar fashion with a cut through the tarsals severing the lower leg that
remains attached to the hide. The remainder of the skin was worked free from the tail up
the back to the neck and removed after the animal was hung to facilitate the remaining
steps in butchery.
Binford (1978:51-62) also worked among the Nunamiut in the Alaskan Arctic and
recorded their skinning and butchering methods used for caribou and Dall sheep. These
inland Inuit lived in the Brooks Range and were still subsistence hunting. Caribou
processing depended on final disposition of the meat—immediate consumption, drying or
freezing, or caching (Binford 1978:142). Dall sheep were only prepared for immediate
consumption during the warmer months (Binford 1978:142-144). Sheep were skinned
following evisceration and removal of the metapodials, and then butchered. Skinning of
the sheep began with a deep cut at the back of the skull to remove it. Then cuts were
made up the medial aspect of the rear legs to the trunk allowing the skin on the rear legs
72

to quickly be stripped by hand.

After repeating the process on the other rear leg, the

ventral cuts were joined to the cut made during evisceration. Working a hand between
the skin and muscles of the haunches, the hide was worked loose ventrally to mid-body
before the front legs were skinned similar to the rear legs. The ventral cut from
evisceration was extended anteriorally to the neck before the hide was worked loosed
from the rib cage, shoulder, and neck by hand. The final skinning operation for Dall
sheep was to pull the hide off of the rump.
For use as dried meat for storage, caribou carcasses were skinned starting with
cuts that allow the head to be removed (Binford 1978:94-95). Additional cuts were then
made down the medial side of the front legs from the shoulder joint to a point where cuts
were made around the circumference at the carpal-metacarpal articulation. Anchoring the
phalange with his own foot, the butcher pulled the skin off the upper part of the front leg
up to the body. The rear legs were treated similarly, but the inner cut was extended to the
anus. A ventral cut was made down the sternum and across the abdomen to meet the cuts
from the rear leg. The sternal cut was extended in an anterior direction up the ventral
surface of the neck, and then the front leg cuts were linked to it. The hide was removed
by inserting a hand under it and “punching” the fist between the muscle and hide while
the other hand pulled the hide upward away from the body and removed the skin. This
action was begun at the shoulders, extending dorsally to the vertebral column, and then
the skin was removed from the rear of the carcass in a similar manner.
When caribou was to be used for immediate consumption as food, the removed
skull was skinned by making cuts transversely between the antlers, longitudinally from
that cut to the posterior edge of the remaining hide, longitudinally along the upper surface
of the muzzle from between the eyes to the nose, and then around the nose to the lips

73

(Binford 1978:152). The resulting flaps were pulled down and removed from the ventral
side of the mandible.
Caribou cows and calves hunted for clothing skins received special skinning
attention, with careful attention being paid to the head (Binford 1978:151-152). Because
hide on the skull is used for parka hoods, care was taken to retain the original contours of
the hide as it was removed from caribou cow or calf skulls as what is termed a cape.
After removing the antlers of adult or subadult caribous by cutting or sawing, a cut was
made posteriorally from the chin down the ventral side of the muzzle to the neck. The
skin was then “worked” upward around the lips, cut behind the nose, and worked from
around the eyes, preserving the eyelids by careful work. The “working” of the hide
apparently involves very careful cutting. After the skin has been removed from the
muzzle, it was removed from the dorsal surface of the frontals rearward from the eyes to
the antler bases. Circular cuts from the underside at the antler bases freed the hide from
the antler remnants and allowed it to be pulled to the rear and completely removed.
Once skinning is accomplished, the partitioning of the carcass itself into resulting
meat, sinews, fats, bodily liquids, and bone or bone products may be accomplished
(Lyman 1987a:252). Portioning may involve removal of the desired products directly
from the articulated carcass itself at the kill location or may require dismemberment into
smaller units for transport or use (Binford 1978; Binford and Bertram 1977; DomínguezRodrigo 2002:11-12; Gifford-Gonzales 1989:185-187; Monahan 1998; O’Connell, et al.
1990, 1992). Factors affecting this decision are based on the anatomy of the prey. They
may include the size of the prey carcass, season, time of day, the distance to where the
products will be ultimately used, food preservation methods in use, the cooking method
to be used in later food preparation, or cultural preference (Marshall 1994; O’Connell, et
al. 1990, 1992). The removal of skeletal elements at the kill site and their deposition
74

there is highly variable and sometimes depends on prey size, but may also be motivated
by decisions to enhance further use or sharing of the resources involved (Bartram 1993;
Domínguez-Rodgrigo and Marti Lezana 1996).
Among the Dassanetch, partitioning of medium to large-sized mammal carcasses
during butchery was documented and reported by several researchers (Gifford-Gonzales
1989:185-186; Lupo and O’Connell 1999:87). The pattern of butchery among this group
is dependent on the size of prey.
For the smaller sized prey, Dassanetch butchery was initiated by cutting the
proximal articulation of the metapodials that are removed with the hide (GiffordGonzales 1989). The ribs were then separated from the sternum as a group and their
vertebral articulation was broken. The muscles associated with the scapula and forelimbs
were severed from the vertebral column. Once the forelimb-rib units were removed, the
muscles around the scapula were cut and separated to sever the forelimbs from the ribs.
Returning to the carcass, the next action cleaved the remaining sternum attachments and
removed the belly muscle masses from the carcass. Continuing, the vertebral column
was removed by severing at the thoracic-lumbar and thoracic-cervical articulations and
then subdivided by cutting through between the third and fourth thoracic vertebrae. The
head was removed by cutting between the atlas and axis (first and second cervical
vertebrae), and then the neck was subdivided by cutting through the articulation between
the third and fourth cervical vertebrae. The final actions taken to butcher carcasses of
this size was to crack the pelvis at the pubic symphysis, sever the iliac-sacrum
articulation by cutting and levering it apart, detaching the hind quarters from the sacral
unit.
The Dassanetch butchered fish by cutting off the head and epaxial spines of the
fins, prior to further butchery and either boiling, roasting, or drying (Gifford-Gonzales, et
75

al. 1999:403, 410, 423, 437). On larger fish carcasses, the braincase was separated from
other portions of the skull and broken open to remove its contents (Gifford-Gonzales, et
al. 1999:437). Production of dried fish for trade also documented (Gifford-Gonzalez, et
al. 1999:410). South Asian market fishers butchered fish larger than 25 cm in length in a
manner similar to that used at Lake Turkana—gills, viscera, fins, and tails were removed
and discarded early in the butchery process (Belcher 1984). For fish in excess of 1 meter
in length, the head was separated from the carcass and also used.
In North America, Flenniken (1981:77-90) observed butchery of flat and round
fish by the Makah tribe of the U. S. Northwest Coast using tools replicated from
prehistoric originals. Traditional butchery methods were used by skilled Makah women
butchers who prepare salmon and halibut for smoking and drying. Their methods
included decapitating each fish, removing the vertebral column and fins, and separating
the remaining flesh into several fillets.
Salmonid fish processing in the northern Pacific Rim is a topic of great interest
among archaeologists working in the region, due to its role in understanding the evolution
of storage-based economies (Hoffman, et al. 2000:699). A wide variety of methods are
documented for salmon butchery, depending on several factors that include intended use,
season and current weather conditions, and condition of individual fish (Fall, et al.
1984:98-113, 1996:52-55; Hutchinson-Scarborough and Fall 1996:43-52; Stanek
1985:141-144; Seitz 1990:68-69). All methods separate the head and entrails from the
body. For storage after drying and smoking, dressed fish carcasses are split lengthwise
and filleted into several fillets as a first step. Further processing used for larger salmon
species or more fatty individual fish removes the fins and vertebrae from the fillets,
although tail elements of the vertebral column are left in place to connect the fillets for
drying (Hutchinson-Scarborough and Fall 1996:45; Seitz 1990:69).
76

When sufficient

time and labor are available, the heads, fins, tails, and entrails may be fermented together.
These methods are similar to others reported ethnohistorically from salmon waters in
western North America (Hoffman, et al. 2000:701; Kennedy and Bouchard 1992:290298; Nelson 1983:267-268; O’Leary 1992:62-88; Romanoff 1992:233-241; Stewart
1977:129-146).
Other North American fish processing among Alaskan Inupiat in the Meade River
delta has been observed (Chang 1988). Arctic char are harvested and processed, as are
whitefish. Whitefish are cleaned and prepared for use by vertical filleting cuts to remove
the entrails and all of the skeleton except the tail (Chang 1988:155). The tail elements
and skin remain attached to the two fillets of flesh.
Lupo and O’Connell (2002:87) documented a different order of activities used by
the Dassanetch for larger prey carcasses. Butchery began by removing the hindquarters
as individual units using a cut to the head of the femur, separating them from the
acetabulum. Front limbs were removed as a unit with the scapula, with similar cuts being
made as documented for smaller prey to separate the forelimb-scapula units from the ribs.
The muscles and other tissues covering the ribs were then cut away. The skull was
removed, usually using a heavy chopping tool, prior to cutting away the longissimus
dorsi muscle between the sacrum and anterior end of the neck. Alternatively, the muscles
of the neck were sliced away by careful cutting around the cervical vertebrae. The
muscles of the belly were removed from the carcass by cutting along the distal ends of
the ribs, with the cuts occasionally being extended to also remove the sternum using
heavier chopping tools. The tongue and esophagus were removed from the skull and
neck using cuts along the ventral aspect of the neck. The Dassanetch only eviscerate
large animals at this point in carcass butchery (Lupo and O’Connell 2002:87). Following
removal of the internal organs, the Dassanetch butchers then separated the ribs into
77

groups of three to six, cutting between the groups and either snapping or chopping the
rib-vertebral articulations free. The vertebral column itself was then cut or chopped into
small sections.
Other researchers (Bunn, et al. 1988; Lupo 1993; Monahan 1998:414-418;
O’Connell, et al. 1988, 1992) have noted consistent variation in these two patterns of
carcass butchery that are based on particular prey species or body size. With smaller wild
prey, the carcass was sectioned into two parts and the limbs remained attached during
transit between the kill-initial butchery site and location of final butchery. Very large
animals were routinely field-butchered to an even higher degree. Their limbs were
disarticulated and meat was stripped from the long bones. Meat attached to the scapulae
was filleted into long sheets. The pelves were stripped of muscle and occasionally split
on a sagital plane. Butchery and transport of near-complete game of up to 360 kg (zebrasized) was possible among the Hadza (Monahan 1998:414-418). Offensive weaponry
allowed hunters to protect kills from predators while waiting for carriers to arrive from a
residence camp and complete field butchery to occur.
The results of butchery leave deep cutmarks (also noted as slice marks) on long
bone epiphyses and near-epiphyseal sections of the diaphyses where connective tissues
supporting the joint articulations were severed during dismemberment (Binford 1981).
Chop marks in similar locations indicated the use of choppers to cut more resistant
connective tissues in disarticulation. Defleshing cutmarks occurred on long bone
diaphyses where muscle attachments are severed, both near the epiphyses and mid-shaft
(Domínguez-Rodrigo 1997a, 1997b, 2002:17). They also left shallow scrape marks
where small amounts of muscle were removed from previously defleshed bones and
where the periosteum was removed (Domínguez-Rodrigo 2002:17). Percussion or deep

78

chop marks at muscle insertions indicated use of hammerstones or choppers to sever the
connective tissues binding muscles to the bone.
Binford and Bertram (1977:91-93) documented Navaho butchering practices for
domestic sheep. Following hide removal from the lower extremities, the next step was
the removal of the anterior end of the esophagus, it being tied in a knot to prevent the
leakage of stomach contents during the remainder of butchery. The head was then
sometimes removed before the animal was hung from a rack for further butchery, with a
cut being made from the dorsal surface of the skull and the atlas vertebra. The hanging
operation was conducted by making a cut between the tibia and tensor calcaneum
(Achilles tendon) on both rear legs, through which a rope was passed to lift the animal
onto the rack. If not done earlier, the head was removed at this point as detailed earlier.
The sheep forequarters were removed by making an incision along the inner
surface of the leg at its juncture with the trunk, freeing the leg from the rib cage. The
neck meat was also cut free at this point while the scapula and trapezius muscle are
removed up to the vertebral column. Both legs were removed at the same time and were
attached by the trapezius muscle. Returning to the ventral area previously having the legchest muscles removed, a layer of fat was removed from the sternum back to the posterior
end of the sternum. Then the sternum was removed with the fat layer by cutting through
the cartilage between the rib ends and the sternum.
The sheep’s abdomen was butchered starting with a relatively small, incision
through the abdominal wall immediately posterior to the diaphragm, the attachments for
the viscera were severed, then the abdominal incision extended to the area between the
rear legs. This allowed the viscera to be removed as two units; stomach, intestines, and
spleen in the first unit to be removed, then heart, lungs, liver, gall bladder, and diaphragm
in the second.
79

Following removal of the viscera, the Navaho butcher cut along the dorsal spines
of all thoracic vertebrae to sever the longissimus dorsi muscle (loin or backstrap). Then
the butcher removed the support from one of the rear legs and chopped through the pelvis
to sever the connection to the sacrum and lumbar vertebrae. The chopping cut continued
up the vertebral column to sever the ribs as part of the rear leg unit. The next chopping
cut removed the caudal vertebrae and sacrum from the other half of the pelvis, extending
up the vertebral column to allow it to be removed as a unit from the remaining rear leg
unit.
Additional butchering chopped the vertebral column into three or four sections,
cut the rib units into three sections, and chop through the diaphyses of the long bones.
Following partitioning of the carcass, meat was cut from the bones for use.
Variability in Nunamiut butchering practices observed during the late 1960s and
early 1970s were described by Binford (1978). The variability depended on factors that
ranged from age of prey, season of kill, and need for vs. ultimate use of the carcasses, to
transportation demands (Binford 1978:51-54).

Field butchery involved a range of

actions from simply eviscerating the prey to complete stripping of the meat from the
carcass after it had been sectioned. In many cases, the heads and metapodials were
removed to initiate carcass processing, often before skinning. In some cases, carcasses
were then cut in half at the thoracic—lumbar transition, sometimes without being
skinned. In other cases, the animal was quartered, with the front and rear legs being
separated from the axial skeleton before evisceration. The rear legs were removed by
cutting through from the ventral side to the acetabulum. Also cutting from the ventral
side between the ribs and scapula removed the front legs. Cuts longitudinally down the
vertebral column on either side of the dorsal vertebral spines and transversely at the base
of the sacrum allowed the longissimus dorsi muscle (loin or backstrap) to be removed.
80

Following evisceration, rib units (third to last) were removed by cutting between the
second and third ribs prior to the rib unit being levered up to break the rib-vertebrae
articulations, the break being completed by cutting. The brisket meat and sternum was
next removed by cutting the cartilage at the rib ends. A transverse cut between the last
lumbar vertebra and sacrum separated the sacral-pelvic unit from the vertebral column.
The tongue was removed by cutting along the inner margin of the mandible.
A variation of the typical methods reported by Binford (1978: 51-54) left the
anterior two ribs attached to the neck unit and the remainder of the vertebral column
attached to sacral-pelvic unit and ribs from one side. Butchery methods used by the Inuit
to remove meat intended for drying for longer-term storage produced smooth-surfaced
meat parcels that were resistant to blue fly larvae resulted in different cutting activities
(Binford 1978:95-97). Following dismemberment, the meat was removed from the hind
legs as fillets, a procedure that began with the severing of the tensor calcaneum at the
calcaneus. The flesh of the tibialis cranialis and fibularis tertius muscles was separated
from the caudal surface of the tibia with a series of short cuts. This action also severed
the distal attachment for the vastus lateralis muscle. Next, a long longitudinal cut was
made along the mesial surface of the femur to allow its proximal attachment to be
removed with a series of short cuts along the surface of the femur. The articulated
remainder of the hind limbs was set aside for further use. The butcher then moved to the
fore limbs for a similar filleting action. Beginning at the dorsal surface of the distal
radio-cubitus, a transverse cut allowed the distal attachment for the extensor digiti and
extensor digitorum communis muscles to be severed. The next cut, made transversely at
the proximal end of the cubitus, severed the distal attachment for the flexor digitorum
profundus muscle. A follow-up longitudinal linear cut along the mesial aspect of the
humerus allowed this muscle to be removed once the attachment at the humerus-scapula
81

articulation was severed with a transverse cut. The meat remained attached to the scapula
and was dried in this form.
Dall sheep were butchered in the manner that the Inuit use for caribou that are to
be used immediately (Binford 1978:143-144). Following skinning, cuts were made in the
crotch area to the ventral side of the acetabulum, loosening the femur-pelvic articulation.
The butcher then twisted the hind limb to dislocate the articulation completely. Cutting
through the proximal end of the muscle mass covering the femur allowed the rear leg to
be removed. The fore limbs were removed by cuts at the anterior aspect of the shoulder
joint to loosen the articulation, extending posterior to the margin of the scapula allowing
removal. The longissimus dorsi muscle (loin or backstrap) was removed in the manner
previously mentioned for caribou butchery. Cutting between the costal ribs and distal rib
ends from the diaphragm and sternum allowed the brisket meat-sternum unit to be
removed. The lungs, heart, and diaphragm were then removed, with the lungs and
diaphragm being discarded by burying. A cut between the second and third ribs, allowed
a rib unit to be pried loose, with final separation being accomplished by a cut along the
rib articulations with the vertebrae. The neck was separated by cutting through the
vertebral column at the point where the cut to remove the rib unit ended between the
second and third ribs. Another cut was made between the thoracic and lumbar vertebrae,
separating the thoracic axial section and a lumbar section with attached sacral-pelvic
component with kidneys.
Butchers from the adjacent Inupiat secondarily butchered a caribou carcass
following initial field dressing at the kill site that divided it into four parts consisting of
the forelegs, the hind legs, the chest cavity and backbone, and head (Chang 1988:153).
Field dressing did not include evisceration, but did leave the head at the kill site.
Secondary butchery at a residence camp separated the ribs, chest meat, and upper
82

portions of the forelegs, including the scapulae, from the trunk and foreleg units. Further
processing removed the entrails, ribs, loin meat, heart, liver, and some fat.
Kent (1993) reported on sedentary hunter-gatherers in Kutse community in the
Kalahari region of Botswana. Predominantly Basarwa or San, the community also
included Bakgalagadi Bantu-speakers and all of the residents depended on wild game as a
major protein source (Kent 1993:326-327). Animals the size of gemsbok or smaller
(<240 kg) were initially butchered at the kill site unless the kill happened late in the day,
in which case springbok and smaller game were carried to camp before any butchery was
done (Kent 1993:336-339). Initial field butchery eviscerated the carcass and removed the
skull and distal portions of the limbs, either at the proximal or distal articulation for the
metapodials. After the carcass was moved to the residence camp, further butchery
disarticulated the tibiae and radii from the more proximal elements of the skeleton and
then, if roasted, butchery was completed by chopping and slicing the carcass into smaller
units for consumption. This involved chopping rib units out and slicing to remove the
forequarter from the carcass, after which the humerus was removed by chopping its
articulation with the scapula. The hindquarters were removed as complete units before
the neck was separated from the remainder of the axial skeleton by cutting. If the carcass
was to be boiled, it was chopped into segments of suitable size to fit the available
cooking vessel.
Yellen (1977:286-290) provided some description of !Kung San butchery
practices related to the production of biltong or dried meat. !Kung butchers stripped from
a kudu carcass meat from all four legs to be dried, together with flesh from part of the
back and pelvis. Rib sections, the liver, and the metapodials were also removed from the
carcass for immediate use. The rumen or stomach was removed for later use. A tortoise
and hare also obtained at the same time were roasted whole and then dismembered.
83

In addition to hunting, humans also obtain prey by passive or aggressive
scavenging from the kills of large predators. This behavior is considered to have been
potentially important in human evolutionary history. It has also been termed early and
secondary access scavenging, with human confrontation of carnivores being a major
difference between the two methods (Cavallo and Blumenschine 1989; DomínguezRodrigo 2001, 2002:15). Modern hunter-gatherer populations used the practice of
confronting carnivores (Bartram 1993; Blumenschine 1986; Blurton Jones, et al. 1989,
1996; Domínguez-Rodrigo 1994; Hawkes, et al. 1991; Gifford-Gonzales 1989a:184-185;
Klein, et al. 1999; Lupo 2001; Lupo and O’Connell 2002). Carcasses scavenged from
felid kills provided Dassanetch hunter-gatherers with either entire anatomical units, such
as a hindquarter or forequarter, or just the meat and sinews (Gifford-Gonzales 1989:184).
Blumenschine (1986, 1988, 1989, 1991, 1995) provided a significant advance in
the knowledge of the limits of potential opportunistic scavenging, based on work in
Africa with canid, hyaenid, and felid predators. His conclusion was that secondary
access to carnivore kills only provided abundant meat in the case of felid-killed prey
because the other carnivores were more social and consumed prey more thoroughly and
at a faster rate. The consumption behavior of many species of felids seemed to leave an
opening for humans to obtain portions of a carcass from a kill either by scavenging from
a cached kill or by driving off the predator while it was consuming the carcass (Cavallo
and Blumenschine 1989). Larger, more social felid species were less likely to be driven
from a kill without overwhelming threat of force by humans possessing offensive
technology, such as the bow and arrow (Lupo and O’Connell 2002:105).
Marrow Procurement
Mammal bones contain stores of fat in two forms, bone grease in cancellous bone
within the axial skeleton and long bone epiphyses and marrow found in the medullary
84

cavities of long bones (Outram 2001:401). Various wildlife management researchers
(Brookes, et al. 1977; Cheatum 1949; Davis, et al. 1987; Peterson, et al. 1982) have
noted that the fat stores within the bone are the last to be metabolized by the animal.
They are the most reliable source of fat for a hunter securing game. The sequence of fat
depletion within the appendicular skeleton has been well studied in ungulates
(Blumenschine and Madrigal 1993; Brookes, et al. 1977; Speth 1987, 1989, 1991a).
Based on this research, fat stores in ungulate proximal limb bones are depleted first for
metabolic use and the distal elements of the forelimbs are the last to be mobilized.
Speth (1983, 1987, 1991b; Speth and Spielmann 1983) established the nutritional
importance of animal fat in cases where access to carbohydrate sources is limited.
Kutchin and Copper Eskimo hunter-gatherers of North America were aware of the
seasonal need for sufficient fat intake to ward off the adverse effects of over-consumption
of lean meat protein in the diet. The caloric value of animal fat is much higher than
animal protein or carbohydrates. Fat also contains fat-soluble nutrients (Erasmus 1986;
Mead, et al. 1986).

Indigenous hunters in both tropical and temperate climates

preferentially chose quarry with a higher potential for a higher fat content, sometimes to
the exclusion of other high-calorie foods (Speth 1983:146, 1987, 1989, 1991a; Stiner
1991, 1994). Exploitation of bone fats by indigenous hunters has been corroborated by
others pursuing actualistic research among the North American Nunamiut Inuit (Binford
1978), South American Ache (Hill, et al. 1987, Hill 1988), !Kung San of southern Africa
(Yellen 1991; Kent 1993), Dassanetch and Hadza of eastern Africa (Blumenschine 1986,
1988, 1991, 1995; Blumenschine and Selvaggio 1988, 1991; Bunn, et al. 1988; GiffordGonzales 1989a; Lupo 1998, 2001; Lupo and O’Connell 2002; O’Connell, et al. 1988.
1990, 1992), and Australian Alyawara (O’Connell and Marshall 1989).

85

Energy value alone is not the only consideration with animal fat as a resource
because other factors, such as macronutritional constraints and social factors, also affect
any decision to use it (Lupo 1998:663). Lipids in animal fat are indispensable for certain
segments of any population. This is especially true for females during pregnancy and
post-partum lactation (Hill, et al. 1987; Hill 1988). During childhood development,
animal-derived long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids are quickly metabolized and
incorporated into the brain’s structural. Fat has also traditionally had many other uses,
among them waterproofing skins, treating bowstrings, tanning hides, and lighting
(Binford 1978:24; Burch 1972; Levin and Potapov 1964:636).
Zooarchaeological and ethnoarchaeological actualistic studies of marrow
procurement have followed two parallel lines of investigation. The first documented the
fat content characteristics of potential prey animals. The second line of investigation
documented the marrow processing behavior of indigenous hunter-gatherer groups.
Lupo (1998) reports the characteristics and caloric variability for African wild
ungulate marrow and brain fat reservoirs. In the study, seventeen carcasses of mediumsized artiodactyl (impala, hartebeest, wildebeest) and perrisodcatyl (zebra) taxa were
experimentally butchered, marrow was extracted from limb bones and mandibles, and the
nutrient contents and average extraction time for meat, marrow, and other tissue
determined (Lupo 1998:659-664). In the results, perrisodcatyl (zebras) were reported to
have much less marrow in the legs than artiodactyls (Lupo 1998:660). The reduced
marrow capacity in equid limb bones is directly related to the anatomical structure and
their locomotor function (Blumenschine and Madrigal 1993). The proximal limb bones
(humerus, femur, and tibia) of all species investigated had larger amounts of marrow and
were more easily processed than other limb bones or the head (Lupo 1998:Tables 5 – 12).
From the appendicular elements assayed and reported by Lupo (1998:Tables 2, 6), the
86

impala yielded 110 – 146 g of marrow (120 - 1272 kcal), the wildebeest 430 – 440 g of
marrow (460 – 3940 kcal), the hartebeest 210 – 376 g of marrow (228 – 1828 kcal), and
the zebra 135 – 171 g of marrow (150 – 1300+ kcal).
Outram and Rowley-Conwy (1998) produced economic utility indices for
horsemeat and marrow, based on butchery of several horse carcasses. Because the
carcasses were obtained from a rendering plant, the carcass weights of 168 to 268 kg did
not include viscera, skin, or blood, but were dressed weights only.

The results

corroborate those of Blumenschine and Madrigal (1993) concerning the reduced marrow
yields from equids in general. The horse was actually being lower than the zebra.
Outram and Rowley-Conwy (1998:Figures 7 and 8) graphically portray how trabecular
bone in the horse’s upper limb bones significantly reduces the medullary cavity volume
and total marrow yield. They also report that much of the marrow from horses is in the
form of linoleic and linolenic acids, relatively liquid polyunsaturated fatty acids. The
average marrow yield from the three horses used in this study was approximately 230
grams, almost 30 percent of which comes from the femur. The humerus, mandible, and
tibia also yield significant amounts of marrow in horses. The excessive trabecular bone
in the medullary cavity of the limb bones and extremely dense cancellous bone of their
diaphyses make marrow recovery difficult.
Hockett and Bicho (2000) investigated lagomorphs and quantified the marrow
contents of long bones of European rabbit and Iberian hare. They noted that the
jackrabbit-sized hare would contain approximately 7 grams of marrow, while the
cottontail-sized rabbit would contain approximately 3 grams of marrow.
Madrigal and Capaldo (1999) collected data on marrow yields of seven whitetailed deer from the eastern United States. They included marrow recovery at least
partially using hammerstones in experimental butchery. The results showed seasonal
87

variation in the energy yield from this sample of primarily young female deer (only one
adult female and one subadult male deer in the sample). Madrigal and Capaldo’s
(1999:243-245) results also revealed that the tibia of this taxon has the highest marrow
yield, with over twice the amount of the next highest element, the femur. All of the other
limb bones provide considerably less marrow. The total marrow yield for the adult
female white-tailed deer was in excess of 1060 kcal, based on a dry weight of over 121
grams of marrow (Madrigal and Capaldo 1999:Table 2). The much larger subadult male
provided a higher amount of marrow, even though it was under some nutritional stress at
the time of death. Madrigal and Capaldo’s (1999:244) results corroborate the sequential
fat depletion of the proximal limb bones prior to the more distal elements.
Ethnographic research by ethnoarchaeologists in Africa, Australia, and the
Americas examined the marrow-recovery procedures used by indigenous peoples for a
range of mammalian prey (c.f. Binford 1977, 1978; Bonnichsen 1973; Gifford-Gonzalez
1989; Jones 1983, 1984; Kent 1993; Lupo and O’Connell 2002; O’Connell and Marshall
1989; O’Connell, et al. 1992; Zierhut 1967). Research among the East African
Dassanetch showed several situation-dependent methods of marrow recovery (GiffordGonzalez 1989:186, 196-200, 211, 214, 216, 218). In residential camps, long bones were
roasted to either cook attached meat (proximal limb segments) or the marrow itself
(metapodials) and then broken with hammerstones and anvils afterwards, especially with
larger bovid or zebra specimens. Alternatively, long bone segments were treated in the
fashion of vertebral or rib segments and boiled, then broken open to remove the marrow.
Both anvil and hammerstone were used to fracture the elements in mid-diaphysis to
remove the marrow. In foraging camps, long bones were fractured prior to cooking and,
in the cases of large bovids, much closer to the epiphyses.

88

Among the Hadza, (O’Connell, et al. 1988:118; Lupo and O’Connell 2002:87-89)
documented the mid-diaphysis breakage of marrow bearing long bones using
hammerstones and consumption of marrow at intercept or encounter butchering stands
and kill or “snack” sites, if the bones had been fully defleshed there. Similar actions were
taken when bones were defleshed at residential camps. The periosteum was not removed
from the bones.
For small animals, the San of southern Africa warmed bones before smashing or
chopping the epiphyses away (Kent 1993:338; Yellen 1991). Once the marrow cavity of
a long bone was heated and opened, its liquefied contents were then sucked out. In some
cases, the marrow of smaller animals was not harvested separately, but was included in
cooked carcasses being chopped and shredded before consumption (Kent 1993:342).
The Aché of eastern Paraguay in South America used a similar technique to
obtain the marrow from small mammals long bones (Jones 1983, 1984). The articular
ends were either chewed or broken off and then the marrow was removed for
consumption.
Zierhut (1967) reported Calling Lake Cree butchery of the largest North
American cervid, the moose, in the Canadian province of Alberta. As documented by
Bonnichsen (1973:9-13), based on Zierhut’s research, the Cree butchered moose
carcasses in a traditional pattern modified by the use of steel cutting tools, especially
heavier ones such as the ax. Cree butchers removed the head by chopping before the
neck was partitioned into several segments by chopping. Following removal of the head,
the skull was transversely cut in half at the base of the muzzle by ax blows that opened
the cranial cavity, allowing the brain to be removed. The processing allowing access to
marrow cavities in the maxillary was done by chopping to remove the orbits and nose,
then by splitting the nose and palate longitudinally. The inferior border and anterior end
89

of the mandible was chopped off or struck with blows from the blunt end of the axe head
to gain access to the mandibular marrow cavity.
The proximal appendicular skeletal elements of the moose were also harvested for
marrow after being heated on an open wood fire. The periosteal sheath was burned away
in the process. In the process of being broken to obtain marrow, each element was
supported by stone anvils placed under the epiphyses. An axe was used to strike the
diaphysis, shattering it into at least two portions. The marrow was then removed with a
small stick. Alternative materials sometimes included log anvils, hammers, formerly
hammerstones.
Also in North America, Binford (Binford and Bertram 1977:94-95; Binford
1978:145-149, 152-164) studied marrow harvesting among the Nunamiut Inuit in the
Canadian Arctic and the Navaho in the arid southwestern United States. He found that the
Navaho formerly harvested marrow from the bones of game or domestic stock (Binford
and Bertram 1977:94-96). The Nunamiut were observed to harvest marrow using several
methods (Binford 1978:145-149, 152-164). They expediently fractured bones in middiaphysis at kill sites and temporary camps to “snack’ on marrow. The bone to be
fractured was placed near a fire to warm and in the case of unskinned metapodials, to
singe the hair off. Once the element had been warmed, remaining skin, soft tissue, and
periosteum was removed by cutting and scraping and the bone was stuck with a blunt
object to fracture it. Objects documented by Binford (1978:153) to be used to fracture
bones for marrow removal included handles of butchering tools and articulated
metapodials. Proximal appendicular elements such as the humerus and femur had the
epiphyses removed similarly before the marrow was extruded. The two epiphyses and
resulting bone cylinder or fragments of the diaphysis were saved for later use in bone
grease rendering. The same method was used in Nunamiut base camps. Diaphysis
90

fracture was never done with the element supported by anvils (Binford 1978:153). The
element was held unsupported and struck in the manner that a flint knapper would strike
a core or tool being manufactured. The butchering methods for the caribou or Dall sheep
skull chopped or smashed open the marrow cavities in the skull and mandible. The brain
and fat in the muzzle were also made available for use.
Bone Grease Procurement
Researchers investigating bone grease procurement have also followed two
parallel lines of investigation. The first documented the non-marrow, in-bone fat
characteristics of potential prey animals through actualistic research. The second line
ethnographically documented the bone grease processing behavior of indigenous huntergatherer groups.
Brink (1997) and Emerson (1990) investigated bone grease in modern North
American bison. The importance of the in-bone fat resources of this species was
recognized when Euro-Americans first encountered indigenous North American huntergatherer cultures. Vehik (1977) and Brink (1997:260, 272) provide an excellent review of
indigenous bone grease rendering methods reported in ethnohistoric and ethnographic
accounts from the 19th and 20th centuries.
Brink (1997:260- 264) analyzed the in-bone fat characteristics from the limb
bones of three northern Bison bison. Two of these were harvested in late fall from a
relatively free-ranging herd in a Canadian national park. The other was from a herd
intensively managed for commercial meat markets, was grain-fed like cattle, and was
harvested in spring. A total of 54 bone samples were collected from the humerus, radiusulna, metacarpal, femur, tibia, and metatarsal of each animal. The portions of each bone
sampled included the proximal and distal epiphyses and midpoint of the diaphysis,
exclusive of the marrow. Samples were crushed, oven dried, and homogenized; then
91

grease was extracted using petroleum ether. Once the ether residue evaporated, weight
and percentage of chemical fat results were calculated on a dry weight basis for each
animal with a mean derived for the group.
Brink’s (1997:262-263) analysis verified the grease content variation within
elements, with a wide variety of fat content in the elements sampled. Of the proximal
skeletal elements, the proximal ends generally have a higher amount of fat than the distal
ends. The dense cortical bone of the proximal skeletal elements diaphyses has a much
lower fat content. Of the four proximal skeletal elements of the bison (humerus, radiusulna, femur, and tibia), the humerus had the highest percentage of fat, with a mean of
40.5%, and also the greatest amount of fat, 324 g. Most of the proximal skeletal elements
had bone grease content of 30 – 35% proximally (mean weight of 110 – 129 g). The
distal ends vary more, with a range of 14 – 35% grease content (18 – 256 g). The
metapodials’ fat content varies in a inverse order, with the distal ends having a higher fat
content than the proximal aspects. The metapodials also have a much lower bone grease
content, between 7 – 9 grams proximally and 26 – 36 g.
Emerson’s (1990) extraction method differed, with boiling of whole bones being
used instead of chemical extraction from the crushed, differentiated portions that Brink
(1997) used. Brink (1997:268) notes that the boiling process used by Emerson (1990)
more approximates techniques observed historically and would recover an amount more
approaching that done by indigenous American practitioners. Field experiments by
Brink, et al. (1986), using a stone boiling method in bison hide-lined pits that
approximates the ethnohistorically-observed methods, found grease lost during heat
extraction to be considerable. However, the differential bone grease production per
segment of skeletal element should correspond to his results (Brink 1997:268).

92

Research by ethnoarchaeologists in Africa, Australia, and the Americas examined
the bone grease rendering procedures used by indigenous peoples for a range of
mammals (Binford 1977, 1978; Bonnichsen 1973; Gifford-Gonzalez 1989; Kent 1993;
Lupo and O’Connell 2002; O’Connell and Marshall 1989; O’Connell, et al. 1992). The
African pastoralists and hunter-gatherers studied by these researchers all live in warm
tropical or subtropical climates. The warm climate in which the San live precludes longterm storage of bone grease because it will become rancid (Kent 1993). Bone grease
production on the scale practiced in colder climates is not attempted. Cancellous articular
ends of bones are added to stews and broths where the rendered fat enriches taste and
adds fat to the diet. Binford (1978:163-165) terms this the manufacture of bone juice and
notes that it is commonly used where freshly killed animals are introduced into residence
camps for immediate use, especially if weather conditions would hasten fat becoming
rancid. It often includes the ribs, especially if made away from a residence camp, but
may include pulverized articular ends of long bones. The Dassanetch typically segmented
carcasses into pot-sized units for boiling to cook meat and to prepare broths (GiffordGonzalez 1989:186, 196-200). Similar behavior was also found among the Hadza who
consumed cancellous tissue gouged out of the epiphyses and ribs (Lupo 1993, 1995;
Lupo and O’Connell 2002:87).
In temperate climates, bone grease need not always be limited to immediate use
because it will not go rancid as quickly and may be stored for long periods of time.
Perishable items placed within grease will be protected against spoilage because the
grease protects them from oxidation because it seals out oxygen. The Canadian Cree
processed bone grease from moose carcasses by removing the proximal epiphyses of the
humerus, chopping ribs into small sections, and removing the neural spines from thoracic
vertebrae to be chopped into small sections similar to ribs (Bonnichsen 1973:11). The
93

blade portions of the pelvis are also removed for a similar use. The fragments from these
bone segments were chopped into smaller sizes on an anvil and then added to boiling
water in a container. The fat in the cancellous bone was melted and floated to the top of
the liquid to be skimmed off. Older members of the Cree remembered the use of
hammerstones before the widespread availability of metal axes (Bonnichsen 1973:11).
In Nunamiut base camps where full-scale grease production was practiced, the
epiphyses were fractured and pulverized before being boiled in water. Heat melted the
grease from within the bone and allowed it to float to the top of the liquid where it was
skimmed off and cooled for later use (Binford 1978:145-149, 158 - 164). Another less
intensive method was to add smaller amounts of crushed bone to hot water to produce a
broth or bone juice. Diaphyses fragments retained after harvesting of marrow were often
boiled to remove residual bone grease.

II: CURRENT RESEARCH ANALYSIS AND RESULTS
Chapter 4: Methods and Materials
BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF ARCHAEOFAUNAL AND BONE ARTIFACT A SSEMBLAGES
The 1965-68 excavation of Arenosa Shelter by University of Texas at Austin
crews was described in Chapter 2. Excavation of controlled, individual units totaled
approximately 1460 ft2 in three blocks within the site.

These excavations were

conducted at a time when archeologists were making a transition to finer mesh size to
screen removed fill. In the first of the three blocks, excavated in 1965-66, crews used
0.5-inch mesh screens. The other blocks were screened using 0.25-inch mesh hardware
cloth, resulting in greater recovery of smaller items.
The upstream block was excavated in 1966-68. It included a 440 ft 2 area on the
upper terrace between the shelter’s drip-line at N200/W160 and its back wall. The
upstream block also included units outside of the shelter, on the terrace slope leading
down to the Pecos River between N180/W160 and the upper terrace surface. The portion
of the upstream block within the shelter overlaid the most deeply excavated portion of the
site. The stratigraphy within the upstream block contained nearly all of the site’s defined
strata. It was the least disturbed portion of the site, although the block’s stratigraphy also
exhibited evidence of flood damage. The unit size used in this block was smaller than
that in the other two blocks, primarily 5x5 feet in stratum 37 and above. The lowest
portion of the site contained strata 38 – 42 and included six units between N199/W167
and N214/W195. This area encompassed three 5x8 feet units and Pits D, E, and F.
14

These lower strata predated 9,550 radiocarbon years before present, the uncorrected C
date from Stratum 38 in Pit D.
95

The upstream block was excavated using a more stringent recovery method with
finer controls over the excavations than that used in the other blocks. The more stringent
controls resulted in more accurate provenience for all materials recovered within the
block. Based on the author’s initial physical examination of the TMM-VP research
collection, this area also had the best bone preservation found within the site. For these
reasons, faunal materials from the upstream excavation block were determined to be the
best sample to use for the current research.
Full-scale analyses of all collections from Arenosa Shelter were never completed,
but as indicated in Chapter 2, Bement (1991) and Collins (1974) analyzed lithic
specimens from the Arenosa Shelter collections. These researchers examined the
statistical typology of an Archaic projectile point type and the lithic technology used at
the site to manufacture a variety of tool types, including Archaic and Late Prehistoric
projectile points. Collins (1974:341-352) documented the use of soft-hammer percussion
and pressure flaking in the lithic technology from Arenosa Shelter, based on evidence in
the lithic assemblage. He also suggested that bone or antler implements might be present
among bone artifacts from the site that were used in such roles. Also, Collins (1974:570572; December, 1999:personal communication) notes the presence of wedge-shaped,
backed unifaces in the lithic assemblage that may have functioned to cut fiber or bone in
manufacturing items in these technological system subsets.
Based on his first two of four field seasons at Arenosa Shelter, Dibble (1967:6371) provided a short summary of the vertebrate faunal remains from the site in a
preliminary report to the National Park Service. His preliminary description of the
assemblage indicated a wide variety of cultural materials excavated from the site that
included archaeofaunal specimens and artifacts of bone or antler. The 1967 report defined
several categories of “worked” bone or antler artifacts. Dibble’s (1967:63-64) type
96

definitions including several forms interpreted as beads, awls, split-bone needles, and
notched or incised bone implements. It also noted the large number of archaeofaunal
specimens and differential preservation that reduced the survival of bone in the lower
strata. Dibble (1967:63) recognized the strong potential to greatly increase “the ultimate
interpretive potential of the site” during the excavations.
Subsequent NPS and NSF-supported cataloging and re-inventory identified over
47,000 objects or fragments of bone in the collections from Arenosa Shelter. This total
included many bone artifacts. Almost 1,000 complete or partial items generally
corresponded to Dibble’s (1967) initial description of the bone-based cultural assemblage
from 1966. The bone artifacts were housed in the TARL research collection. Items listed
as awls, beads, bead preforms, polished bone, modified catfish spines, modified deer
antler, painted bone, and grooved or incised bone were recorded in the ANCS II database
at the beginning of the current study. Approximately 200 beads and over 500 awls were
listed in the inventory at the beginning of the current research. Several different forms of
both awls and beads were noted in the catalog. Many more bone fragments housed in the
TMM-VP research collection exhibit cultural modifications such as burning, impact
fractures, polish, and cutmarks.
The vertebrate species represented in the site’s collection inventories when the
current study began included birds, fish, reptiles, and amphibians, but were primarily
mammals. Remains of many small to medium mammal species were predominantly
rabbits and deer. Small to medium-sized rodent and carnivore remains were also present.
Larger mammals included both modern and extinct species of bison. Birds included
waterfowl and terrestrial species. Fish were represented by a variety of sizes and species
with potential economic importance, such as catfish, gar, and several cypriniform
suckers.
97

Within the upstream block, the more protected area inside of the shelter had
characteristics warranting more intensive examination of its archaeofaunal material as a
sample for the current research. This protected area included excavation units overlying
the deepest excavated portion of the site. A total of 340 ft2 was excavated within the
upstream block’s upper strata between the N180/W160 and N210/W184 grid points. The
lower portion of the upstream block was excavated in an L-shaped area that included six
units sampling strata below Stratum 37 between N199/W167 and N214/W195, an area of
just over 200 ft2 (Figure 10). Based on a thorough examination of field records archived
in TARL’s Records Section, the sampled area was known to contain 85 lots recorded as
containing bone, slightly more than 20 per cent of the 404 bone-containing lots. Physical
examination of the archaeofaunal material from the sample area in TMM-VP’s research
collection showed it to be varied in condition of preservation, but generally better than
much of the bone from less protected

98

portions of the site. While the sampled area was also known from Dibble’s field records
to have experienced the harmful effects of scouring during episodic major flooding, most
of the site’s defined strata were present within it. As research progressed, the author
became acutely aware of contextual limitations imposed by the site’s depositional history.
As a cautionary note, readers should refer back to discussion of applicable previous
geological research in Chapter 2 and stratigraphic description in Tables 2.1 and 2.2 to
refamiliarize themselves with the harmful effects of erosion on the site’s contents and
their context, especially in strata below Stratum 18. The effect of contextual limitations
within the site is strong and significantly affected the presence and preservation of
archaeofaunal material. The sampled area showed the least damage even though it, too,
was affected by erosion associated with river flooding. Even with these limitations, the
archaeofaunal sample from Arenosa Shelter is among the best from the Lower Pecos
region.
Thus, the sample selected for detailed examination during the current research
was chosen from the portion of the site with the best stratigraphic record and the best
bone preservation. Due to a number of factors, it had the strongest potential of the site’s
archaeofaunal contents to allow the most complete examination of the current research’s
fundamental aims.
METHODOLOGY
The current examination of Arenosa Shelter archaeofaunal materials was
conducted to expand upon previous material culture analyses. The methodology was
designed to fully define the characteristics of the site’s vertebrate faunal assemblage by
closely examining a sample of the Arenosa Shelter archaeofaunal collections and bone
artifacts.
100

As an important first step, the remains of vertebrate species present in the sample
area described previously were to be identified and quantified, including those
documented as prey of the site’s prehistoric human inhabitants obtained for food or other
uses. Secondly, the study methodology was planned to detect and record evidence for
processes used to manufacture bone or antler tools and ornaments during the region’s
long occupation. By these means, the study methodology was to identify and describe
the mechanisms and cultural modifications through which bone from prey species was
incorporated into the Lower Pecos technological system as a raw material.
Unmodified Bone
Animal carcasses found in archaeological sites may enter the fossil record with no
obvious indication of cultural modification or manipulation. Arenosa Shelter’s
topographic location within an alluvial terrace of the Pecos River canyon had relatively
good availability of water, an important resource. Due to this location, the site is within
the woody vega-terrace vegetation unit defined by previous botanical researchers. This
unit contains relatively large-scale vegetation--brush and mesquite, willow, sycamore,
pecan, live oak, and mulberry trees, an oasis in an otherwise arid environment. As such,
the site’s physiographic situation would have provided an attractive, sheltered woodland
habitat during its long cultural occupation concurrently to both the prehistoric human
inhabitants and a wide range of terrestrial vertebrate animals.
The site’s demonstrated habitation use by terrestrial animals and potential use as a
roost area by predatory birds allows additional agents introducing animal carcasses into
the fossil record. Those not definitely introduced through human agency could have
entered the fossil record through natural death or accumulations of prey remains. Bones
reflecting no obvious cultural modification or manipulation were assumed to originate
from naturally introduced animal carcasses. Bones lacking physical evidence of burning,
101

cutmarks, impact damage, or remnant of culturally-derived disposal such as bone
stacking recorded in the project’s field notes were anticipated to be reflected in remains
originating from non-cultural deposition. Similarly, animal carcasses associated with
flood deposits would probably not reflect cultural association except through potential
scavenging or mixing. Based on this assumption, a methodology was developed to
enable the author to address paleo-environmental reconstruction needs using remains that
lacked obvious cultural modifications or manipulations. The archaeofaunal materials
from the study’s target area represent a statistically significant sample of the over 47,000
bone fragments collected during four field seasons of excavation at the site.
During several decades of curated storage, the Arenosa Shelter archaeofauna had
not previously been prepared for study. As a result, the current study’s methodology
included initial cleaning of all bone fragments. Water and gentle scrubbing using small
artists brushes and bamboo splints was used to remove adhering sediment. Where
necessary to make the surface of bone fragments visible, the methodology incorporated
standard vertebrate paleontological preparatory techniques to remove calcium carbonate
encrustations. A short-duration soak in a dilute (10%) solution of acetic acid was to be
used for this purpose. Following use of acetic acid, specimens were soaked in water and
air-dried. Fragile fragments were then consolidated with a solution of polyvinyl acetate
(PVA, brand-name Gelva) diluted in acetone.

Specimens were also examined

microscopically using a binocular dissecting microscope at a magnification of 10x – 30x
and then cataloged separately, if needed.
Species Determination
The species determination methodology developed for the Arenosa Shelter
archaeofaunal study incorporated classificatory practices from vertebrate systematics. An
assessment of taxonomic differences between skeletal materials from recent, sub-fossil,
102

and fossil organisms must be based on remaining hard tissues. The methodology used
with the Arenosa Shelter faunal collection was designed to make taxonomic
identifications using standardized anatomical methods from veterinary anatomy, zoology,
and vertebrate paleontology. These particular methods use morphometric differences in
remnant hard tissues, such as teeth, bone, antler, and shell, to phenotypically classify
organisms into the Linnaean hierarchical classification system. The TMM-VP modern
comparative osteological and fossil locality collections were used as primary aids in
determining taxonomic assignments for individual specimens in the Arenosa Shelter
archaeofaunal collection. Specimens from Arenosa Shelter were identified to the
appropriate taxonomic level, based on size and visual characteristics of elements from
specimens of known taxa from the TMM-VP collections. Veterinary anatomy and taxonspecific zoology texts were consulted to determine appropriate anatomical characteristics
for distinguishing between species of catfish, ruminants, carnivores, rodents, and
lagomorphs. Where necessary to determine anatomical characteristics or to ascertain
specific damage by carnivores, low power microscopic examination of specimens used a
binocular dissecting microscope at a magnification of 10x – 30x.
Age and Sex Determination
The methodology developed to examine the age composition of the Arenosa
Shelter archaeofaunal collection was based on existing methods from zoology and
vertebrate paleontology. These methods use visual characteristics to assign vertebrate
skeletal material to approximate age classes of fetal, juvenile, sub-adult, or adult, based
on size and morphology. Morphological characteristics used included tooth wear, the
surface texture and other physical appearance of the bone structure, fusion of bone
sutures, and presence of deciduous or permanent dentition. Other more specific methods
were used for fish. Although not as applicable to warmer waters, annual growth cycles
103

leave distinctive growth structures termed annuli that may be counted. Use of this
method allowed a more accurate determination for some of the fish specimens. While
similar growth structures are found in mammalian teeth and several bony other tissues in
fish, most of these annuli are only detectable using invasive, techniques that require
cross-sectioning of the elements. The Arenosa Shelter methodology specifically was
developed to allow use of non-invasive optical methods to detect and record annular
growth structures in fish vertebrae.
Enumeration
Enumeration of archaeofauna may be based on both observational and analytical
units, such as NISP, MNI, MNE, or MAU, as discussed in Chapter 3. The methodology
adopted for use during the current study enumerated numbers of elements or fragments of
elements, identified to most appropriate taxon and differentiated by side and age, where
possible. NISP was derived for each taxon, differentiated by horizontal and vertical
excavation units used by the excavators. MNI and MNE were derived to allow for
identification of the number of individual animal carcasses represented in the Arenosa
Shelter study collection, distinguished on the basis of anatomical and age characteristics.
As recommended by Lyman (1994a:104), the MNE measure used in this study was
specified to include diaphysis fragments. The degree of fragmentation in the collection
was assessed using a comparison of NISP, MNI, and MNE.
Culturally Modified Bone
Animal carcasses with obvious indications of cultural modification may also enter
the fossil record in archaeological sites. Physical evidence of cultural modifications and
manipulations were anticipated to be reflected in remains originating from cultural
deposition. This would include burning, cutmarks, impact damage from fracturing for
marrow retrieval or grease production, or remnants of culturally derived disposal such as
104

bone stacking recorded in the project’s field notes. Based on this assumption, a
methodology was developed to enable the author to address cultural faunal processing
aspects of the study using remains with obvious cultural modifications or manipulations.
Subsistence-Related Faunal Processing
Lyman (1987a:252, 1994a:295) reasoned that osteological components produced
during butchering should be archaeologically visible as results of an extraction process
yielding muscle, skin, and fat products. This reasoning guided development of the
methodology for recognition and analysis of the Arenosa Shelter culturally-modified
archaeofauna. The methodology for recording and assessing heat-related discoloration
possibly associated with cooking or bone disposal takes into account Shipman, et al.’s
(1984b) cautions concerning culturally-related heat damage in recording the anatomical
position, intensity, and frequency of burning, although high power microscopy was not
used. Given that grass fires in semiarid areas don’t achieve the heat intensity or duration
necessary to alter the color or structure of bone (cf. Shipman, et al. 1984b:323), it was
assumed that heat damage was culturally induced. Overall burning was assumed to
indicate bone disposal, with partial burning indicating bone insulated by meat during
roasting. General degree of color change was noted for burned bone, but not rigorously
assessed. Shipman, et al.’s (1984b:313) burning stages and resulting bone color was used
as a guide in assessing degree of heat damage.
The means for detecting and recording butchering activities necessary to
disarticulate, skin, and fillet meat from animal carcasses were adapted from standard
zooarchaeological methods currently in use. Cutmarks resulting from butchering are
grouped in locations that impact a specific biological structure on butchered skeletal
elements, such as a muscle insertion or articulation (Shipman and Rose 1983a). Trample
marks are not grouped in the same manner and do not show similar parallel micro105

striations within the marks’ narrow, approximately V-shaped cross-sections. Chop-marks
are deeper and wider in profile, but shorter in length than cutmarks resulting from slicing
actions. They also occur in anatomical areas that had more resistant connective tissues
present, such as articulations (Binford 1981).
Following Binford (1981:47), the study methodology defines skinning to leave
cut-marks on distal portions of the extremities, the lower margins of the mandible, and on
the skull. Disarticulation chop- and cut-marks are limited to articular surfaces of long
bones or along their edges, and on the surfaces of vertebrae and portions of the pelvis.
Filleting or meat removal leave cut-marks transverse to the long axis of some skeletal
elements at the insertion points for muscles, parallel to the long axis of some skeletal
elements, or in the case of fish, parallel to the long axis of larger anatomical units such as
the vertebral column. Hammerstone blow marks at appropriate anatomical positions, such
as the insertion points for muscles (cf. Domínguez-Rodrigo 2002), were included as
evidence of a defleshing method. Stress on blow locations allows impact damage from
roof fall within the shelter to be separated from cultural alteration.

The study

methodology also distinguishes between primary butchery, secondary butchery, and final
butchery-consumption, sensu Lyman (1994:300).
Use of low power (10x – 30x magnification) microscopic examination of
specimens employing a binocular dissecting microscope and low-angle directional
lighting was used to detect and record cut-marks, chop-marks, blow-marks, and any
carnivore damage which might also be present. The methodology also included an
analysis of the Feature 18 cultural feature to determine whether bone stacking reported
elsewhere for Paleoindian occupations might be deduced from field notes.
Also incorporated into the methodology for assessing culturally-related faunal
processing was detection and analysis of fragment surface damage and fracture patterns
106

to determine the frequency and characteristics of those most likely to be caused by
fracture-based cultural behaviors. Following Johnson (1985:175, 192), fragment surfaces
were examined using low power (10x – 30x magnification) microscopic examination
employing a binocular dissecting microscope and low-angle directional lighting to detect
and record blow-marks, notching, ring-cracks, crushing, or other fracture features. The
microscopic examination was used to detect any scoring and pitting damage from
carnivore mastication that might also be present. The examination also recorded the
weathering state at which fragmentation occurred, using characteristics advanced by
Shipman, et al. (1981). MNE vs. NISP calculations were derived to assess the overall
degree of fragmentation represented by the collections.
Technology-Related Manufacturing and Use Modification
The methodology developed to study manufacturing of bone artifacts and
modifications caused by use of those artifacts complemented the methodology used for
studying fracture-based bone fragmentation. Following soaking in water and air-drying,
each artifact was thoroughly cleaned under 10x – 20x magnification by gentle scraping
with a bamboo splint, dental scaler, or brushing. Final dusting with compressed air was
used to clean the surfaces for analysis. Where necessary, a short-duration acetic acid
(10% solution) bath was employed prior to water-soaking to enable calcareous
encrustations to be removed.
Time limitations required sampling to reduce the number of artifacts for analysis
by approximately 50% prior to analysis while still being able to produce valid results.
From the collection of approximately 1,000 artifacts, artifacts were chosen that reduced
redundancy within strata and time units. This emphasis facilitated efficient use of
analytical efforts by securing a diverse sample with which to document the breadth of
artifact types, manufacturing methods, and use-wear characteristics through as much of
107

the site’s occupational history as possible. The sampling strategy was judgmental. The
author used a combination of factors that were based on a thorough knowledge of the
excavation and recovery methodology used at the site, its stratigraphy, and the physical
contents of the resulting artifact collection and its characteristics.
The analysis methodology involved specimen examination using low power (10x
– 70x magnification) microscopic inspection. A binocular dissecting microscope and
low-angle directional lighting were employed to detect manufacturing features, such as
impact fractures, grooves or cutmarks, and grinding, which were recorded prior to
analysis of attributes. Polish and burning that related to subsequent use or discard were
also recorded for items subsequently incorporated within the site’s matrix. Both
manufacture and use wear characteristics were recorded using standardized signatures
reported in the bone technology literature (cf. Griffits 2001; Griffits and Bonsall 2001;
Lemoine 1995, 1997).

108

Chapter 5: Results of Faunal Analysis
The preceding discussion of methodology described both standardized and
project-specific procedures used in the current research to prepare and analyze a sample
of faunal materials from Arenosa Shelter that are now contained in the research
collections of TMM-VP. The analysis allowed verification of previous analyses,
specifically regarding species identification of many of the previously recorded
specimens. However, the more detailed examination and analysis conducted during the
current research also enabled significant revisions to be made that enriched the
knowledge of fauna present during Archaic occupation of the Lower Pecos cultural
region. This enrichment expanded the foundation for understanding indigenous cultural
behavior during the Lower Pecos Archaic.
SPECIES IDENTIFICATION
As previously indicated, the author determined at the outset of research that the
archaeofaunal sample excavated from Arenosa Shelter was richly varied in composition,
but dominated by significant amounts of rabbit and deer remains. The author assumed,
using an extension of the reasoning by the site’s excavators (cf. Dibble 1967), that these
remains at least partially represented the residues of cultural behavior associated with
fulfilling subsistence and technological needs. Detailed examination of approximately
4,900 individual specimens from 85 lots allowed the preliminary observations of previous
NPS and NSF-funded collections management research to be verified and expanded. The
current research results documented the presence of a wide range of the resident and
transient fauna available in this region. Identification of individual specimens was made
to the taxonomic level most appropriate, given the particular anatomical characteristics
109

for each specimen. The following table presents a composite of taxa identified during the
current research.
It should be noted that over 140 individual taxonomic assignments were made
during analysis of the Arenosa Shelter sample, filling the full range of classifications
between Class and sub-species levels. Taxonomic assignments included one sub-species,
sixty-five species, thirty-three made to genus, twelve made to family, ten made to order,
and twelve to class only. Identification was successfully made for many specimens to
either genus or species. The Arenosa Shelter faunal sample was diverse in its makeup,
especially in the site’s better-preserved upper strata.
QUANTIFICATION AND CONTEXT IN ASSEMBLAGE
Data for specimens examined by the author were recorded as 2,380 records in a
FileMaker Pro database during data collection. These data were exported to Microsoft
Excel spreadsheets during analysis. Records originally separated in the FileMaker Pro
database by provenience and taxonomic assignment were aggregated in several ways,
including by taxa, provenience, regional cultural period, and cultural stage. Values were
derived for NISP, MNI, and MNE. These data are presented in Table 5.2, organized by
provenience unit.
The NISP, MNI, and MNE measures aggregated by regional cultural period are
presented in Tables 5.3, 5.5, and 5.7. Percentages were calculated for each measure and
as a composite value for the sample itself. The percentages aggregated by regional
cultural period are presented in Tables 5.4, 5.6, and 5.8.
A composite figure of NISP, MNE, and MNI differentiated by regional cultural
stage is presented in Table 5.9 and Figure 12.

Figure 12: Composite NISP, MNE, and MNI Data Arranged by Cultural Stage
When the aggregations by cultural stage are examined, it is evident that two taxa
are most frequent in the Arenosa Shelter collection sample, especially when the Late
Archaic and later cultural stages are considered. This prevalence is evident for both
NISP and the two measures that look more closely at minimum numbers of individual
carcasses represented. Most fragments in the sample were identified as mammalian
(NISP n = 3391; MNE/MNI n = 609), with significant numbers of fish fragments also
present (NISP n = 1357; MNE/MNI n = 285). Bird remains were appreciably less
numerous in the sample (NISP n = 90; MNE/MNI n = 61). Relatively few reptile
fragments were identified (NISP n = 58; MNE/MNI n = 31), mostly turtle remains.
Amphibians were virtually absent from the sample (NISP n = 5; MNE/MNI n = 3).
111

The total NISP count included a large number of fragments that could be
differentiated only to vertebrate class. About 18 per cent of the total NISP tally consisted
of mammal (n = 629) and fish (n = 254) fragments that lacked distinguishing
characteristics allowing more specific taxonomic assignment. The tallies for MNI/MNE
associated with mammal or fish fragments unidentifiable beyond vertebrate class were
considerably less (mammalian n = 10, fish n = 21).
Mammalian lagomorph species are more frequent in this sample than any other
taxa (NISP n = 1786; MNE/MNI n = 271). These members of the family Leporidae
represent 36.4 per cent of the total sample and include two species of cottontail rabbit and
jackrabbits. Cottontail remains make up the bulk of the leporid material, with the larger
jackrabbits representing about 24 per cent of the total leporid NISP (n = 429) and almost
31 per cent of the total leporid MNE/MNI (n = 84).

Most cottontail axial and

appendicular skeletal remains could not be assigned to species due to the difficulties
expressed by Hulbert (1984) for differentiating between smaller Sylvilagus species.
Identifiable in the cottontail remains are a few individuals identifiable as the small desert
cottontail (NISP n = 9; MNE/MNI n = 5) and slightly larger eastern cottontail (NISP n =
3; MNE/MNI n = 3).
Large mammals, defined here as those weighing above 40 kg, included
representatives of the orders Artiodactyla and Perrisodactyla present regionally. Deer,
sheep, bison, and pronghorn antelope are artiodactyls identified in the Arenosa Shelter
sample. Horse species were also present in the oldest deposits. Large mammal
fragments constituted 13.1 per cent of the sample NISP (n = 642) and 13.9 per cent of the
sample MNE/MNI (n = 138).
Non-lagomorph medium-sized mammals, defined for this study as weighing
between 1.0 kg and 40 kg, included the largest rodent (beaver) present in the sample and
112

all mammalian carnivores. The broad category also included fragments that were
identifiable as medium mammal in size and characteristics but lacking the distinctive
characteristics allowing more specific taxonomic assignment.

Medium mammal

fragments constituted about 3.3 per cent of the sample NISP (n = 161), but 13.9 per cent
of the sample MNE/MNI (n = 138).
Small mammals, defined here as those weighing less than 1.0 kg, included all
rodents except the beaver. Fragments of small mammals made up about 3.5 per cent of
the sample NISP (n = 173) and 9.3 per cent of the sample MNE/MNI (n = 92).
Although a diverse array of fish remains was identified and analyzed in the
Arenosa Shelter sample, catfish (Order Siluriformes) and minnows or suckers (Order
Cypriniformes) are most common. Overall, catfish represented 10.6 per cent of the total
sample NISP (n = 519), while suckers comprised 6.6 per cent of the sample NISP (n =
323). In terms of the sample MNE/MNI, catfish were 15 per cent (n = 149) while
minnows or suckers were 6.5 per cent (n = 64).
Body size of fish varied greatly between taxa as might be expected, such as
between small sunfish or bass and very large catfish. It also varied widely within a
specific taxon where different age classes were present. For analytical purposes, five size
classes were recorded for fish taxa where appropriate, ranging from small to large. Small
fish represented 0.94 per cent of the sample NISP (n = 46) and 2.42 per cent of the
sample MNE/MNI (n = 24). Small to medium fish represented 5.5 per cent of the sample
NISP (n =271) and 6.56 per cent of the sample MNE/MNI (n = 65). Medium fish
represented 9.12 per cent of the sample NISP (n = 447) and 18.28 per cent of the sample
MNE/MNI (n = 181). Medium to large fish represented 3.26 per cent of the sample NISP
(n = 160) and 5.3 per cent of the sample MNE/MNI (n = 54). Large fish represented 1.49
per cent of the sample NISP (n = 73) and 4.65 per cent of the sample MNE/MNI (n = 46).
113

It should be noted that at least two taxa recorded from the Arenosa Shelter sample
are currently not present in the vicinity of the lower Pecos watershed. These are the
shovelnose sturgeon and a large, heavily-built gar that most closely resembles the
alligator gar.
The avian archaeofauna was diverse, but sparse (NISP n = 90, MNI/MNE n = 61).
It comprised only 1.84 per cent of the sample’s total NISP and about 6.16 per cent of the
sample’s total MNE/MNI. Hawks, ducks and geese, and quail dominated the avian
fauna. Both dabbling and diving ducks are represented in the sample, as are large and
small geese. The white-winged dove, roadrunner, and an undetermined species of gull
round out the avian fauna from the Arenosa Shelter sample and are represented by single
specimens
Small to medium sized birds, such as quail, doves, and the smallest hawks,
constituted 1.12 per cent of the sample’s total NISP (n = 55) and 3.23 per cent of the total
MNE/MNI (n = 32). All other avian taxa were considered to be large birds; they made up
0.5 per cent of the sample’s total NISP (n = 25) and 2.36 per cent of the total MNE/MNI
(n = 24). Although no direct osteological evidence of owls was present, their presence
may be detected indirectly from the presence of skunks, a larger prey sometimes hunted
by great horned owls in addition to their favored lagomorphs (Austing and Holt 1966:19;
Johnsgard 2002:117). Great horned owls often hunt opportunistically at dawn and dusk
from perches that provide a vantage point for short flights (Johnsgard 2002:117). Skunks
are represented among the medium mammalian carnivores in the Arenosa Shelter fauna.
Their remains exhibit ravaging typical of owls, including shearing of the braincase from
the cranium (Austing and Holt 1966:31).
Both reptilian and amphibian remains were limited in diversity and quantity. The
amphibian remains were extremely sparse and consisted only of frogs. Two species of
114

ranid frogs were identified, but made up less than 1.0 per cent of the site’s total NISP (n =
5) and MNE/MNE (n = 3). The reptilian remains were more common, with turtles being
more numerous than snakes in the sample. Turtles represented about one per cent of the
total NISP (n = 48) and 2.2 per cent of the total MNE/MNI (n = 22) for the sample, while
snakes were 0.2 per cent of the sample’s total NISP (n = 10) and 0.91 per cent of the total
MNE/MNI (n = 9).
Changes through time for each of these groupings of taxa, including size classes
of fish, are presented in Tables 5.10 - 5.11. A graphical representation of the NISP and
MNE/MNI trends through time is presented in Figures 13 and 14.

As may be seen from the data and graphical representation in the
foregoing figures and Tables 5.10 – 5.11, the Arenosa Shelter faunal sample
exhibits differences between cultural stages represented in the site’s stratigraphic
record. The early cultural stages, Paleoindian and Early Archaic, are sparsely
represented and correspond to 4.08 per cent of the sample total NISP and 3.94 per
cent of the sample total MNE/MNI. It should be noted, however, that remains
from the Paleoindian strata (NISP n = 187; MNE/MNI n = 33) are more numerous
than the succeeding Early Archaic (NISP n = 13; MNE/MNI n = 6). The Middle
Archaic strata have slightly more numerous remains than the Paleoindian stage
(NISP n = 205; MNE/MNI n = 83). Within these early strata, large mammal
remains in the Bison antiquus or Equus sp. size range effectively dominated the
Paleoindian stage. Early Archaic remains are very rare in the Arenosa Shelter
sample. Large mammal remains are prevalent in Middle Archaic strata and more
frequent than remains of smaller mammals or other vertebrate classes. Fish were
recovered from the Middle Archaic strata, but constituted a minority of the
remains associated with this stage (NISP n = 21; MNE/MNI n = 15).
Strata from the Late Archaic, Terminal Late Archaic, Late Prehistoric, and
Historic cultural stages exhibit a strong shift from the dominance by large
mammal remains to a prevalence of remains from animals of medium body size.
Importantly, fish were included in the category of animals with large body size for
the first time beginning in Late Archaic strata. Large fish remains were identified
as large gar, catfish, or cypriniform suckers. Late Archaic (NISP n = 59;
MNE/MNI n = 30) frequencies for large fish were greater than for the succeeding
Late Prehistoric – Historic (NISP n = 2 and MNE/MNI n = 2) and preceding Late
118

Archaic (NISP n = 7 and MNE/MNI n = 7). Large mammals included deer,
pronghorn antelope, and sheep or domestic goat.
Even though animals of large body size were relatively more abundant
than in earlier strata, those of medium body size widely surpassed them in
frequency during the Late Archaic and succeeding cultural stages. Medium body
size forms included large birds, many species of fish, rabbits, beaver, and
mammalian carnivores. Rabbits were always the most common taxa. The Late
Prehistoric – Historic composite rabbit NISP (n= 40) is considerably less than that
of the Terminal Late Archaic (n = 1501) and Late Archaic (n = 211). The Middle
Archaic strata yielded fewer rabbit remains (NISP n = 33), while the extreme
disturbance in Early Archaic strata left none of the fragile leporids in place. A
single rabbit fragment was found in Paleoindian context.

The MNI/MNE

measures point to the higher fragmentation of rabbit remains from Terminal Late
Archaic strata (n = 203), compared to those from the Late Prehistoric – Historic (n
= 13) and Late Archaic (n = 39) strata. Middle Archaic MNI/MNE frequencies
(n= 14) also show less fragmentation of rabbit remains.
Mammalian carnivores are less common in Late Prehistoric – Historic
strata (NISP n = 6; MNE/MNI n = 6) than those in the Terminal Late Archaic
(NISP n = 85; MNE/MNI n = 51), Late Archaic (NISP n = 17; MNE/MNI n =
16), or Middle Archaic (NISP n = 17; MNE/MNI n = 7) strata. It should be noted
that the raccoon was present in Middle Archaic, Terminal Late Archaic, and Late
Prehistoric – Historic periods. Late Prehistoric – Historic occurrences of the
raccoon (NISP n = 2; MNE/MNI n = 2) are approximately equivalent to those of
the Middle Archaic (NISP n = 7; MNE/MNI n = 2). Those of the Terminal Late
119

Archaic were slightly more prevalent (NISP n = 8; MNE/MNI n = 7). Several
robust individuals (NISP n = 2; MNE/MNI n = 2) were identified among raccoon
specimens from Terminal Late Archaic strata that may be referred to the large
Pleistocene-remnant subspecies (Procyon lotor simus). This subspecies was
extirpated in the region within the last millennium. A smaller relative of the
raccoon, the ringtail (Bassariscus astutus), was also present in equivalent
frequencies during the latter two periods and also present during the Late Archaic.
It was less frequent than the raccoon during the Late Prehistoric – Historic
cultural stages (NISP n = 1; MNE/MNI n = 1) and more frequent during the
Terminal Late Archaic (NISP n = 11; MNE/MNI n = 7). The ringtail was not
numerous during the Late Archaic (NISP n = 4; MNE/MNI n = 3).
Domestic dog (Canis familiaris) remains were identified from Terminal
Late Archaic strata (NISP n = 3; MNE/MNI n = 1), distinct from remains of the
similarly sized coyote (Canis latrans NISP n = 5; MNE/MNI n = 3) in this period.
The domestic dog remains consisted of fragmentary mandible with M2,
premaxillary, and isolated left lower canine smaller in size than coyote. Possible
coyote (cf. Canis latrans) remains (NISP n = 4; MNE/MNI n = 2) were identified
in Late Archaic strata. Numerous remains of a medium to large canid in the size
range and build of domestic dog or coyote were identified in Terminal Late
Archaic (NISP n = 23; MNE/MNI n = 6) and Middle Archaic (NISP n = 7;
MNE/MNI n = 2) strata.
Smaller, fox-sized canids that could not be assigned to a more specific
taxon were present in Late Archaic (NISP n = 1; MNE/MNI n = 1) and Terminal
Late Archaic (NISP n = 3; MNE/MNI n = 3) contexts. Foxes were identified
120

from strata of all cultural stages except Paleoindian. They included at least three
species, the gray fox (Urocyon cinereoargenteus), two members of the fox genus
Vulpes, the red fox (Vulpes vulpes) and the kit or swift fox (Vulpes velox).
Remains of a large fox in the size range of both Urocyon cinereoargenteus and
Vulpes vulpes was also present, but could not be assigned to a more specific
taxon.
The frequency of fox remains is highest in the Terminal Late Archaic,
with the gray fox being most common. Frequency for the gray fox peaks in the
Terminal Late Archaic strata (NISP n = 11; MNE/MNI n = 9), with lesser
numbers in the Late Prehistoric – Historic (NISP n = 3; MNE/MNI n = 3), Late
Archaic (NISP n = 2; MNE/MNI n = 2), and Middle Archaic (NISP n = 1;
MNE/MNI n = 1). The red fox is present in the Terminal Late Archaic (NISP n =
2; MNE/MNI n = 2). The desert-adapted kit or swift fox is present during the
Terminal Late Archaic (NISP n = 2; MNE/MNI n = 1), Late Archaic (NISP n = 1;
MNE/MNI n = 1), Middle Archaic (NISP n = 1; MNE/MNI n = 1), and Early
Archaic (NISP n = 1; MNE/MNI n = 1). A fragmentary Vulpes sp. fragment that
could be either red or kit fox was present in the Terminal Late Archaic (medial
right tibia diaphysis, NISP n = 1; MNE/MNI n = 1). The large fox not assignable
confidently to either genus was represented by a Terminal Late Archaic specimen
(NISP n = 1; MNE/MNI n = 1).
A single fragment represented the bobcat. This small felid was identified
from Late Archaic strata. The badger, largest of the mustelids, was identified
from a single specimen excavated within Terminal Late Archaic strata.

121

Skunks, members of the family Mephitidae, were present in strata dating
to the Terminal Late Archaic and Late Archaic. The small spotted skunks
(Spilogale sp.) were identified, in addition to a fragment from an unidentified
larger species of skunk in the genera Mephitis or Conepatus. Spotted skunk
(Spilogale sp.) remains (NISP n = 5; MNE/MNI n = 5) were identified from
Terminal Late Archaic strata and Late Archaic strata. The large skunk specimen
also came from Late Archaic strata.
The only rodent within the medium body size category was the beaver.
This important aquatic-adapted furbearer was found within Late Prehistoric –
Historic, Terminal Late Archaic, Late Archaic, and Middle Archaic strata. Its
frequency within the Terminal Late Archaic was significantly more (NISP n = 6;
MNE/MNI n = 5) than the Late Prehistoric – Historic (NISP n = 2; MNE/MNI n =
2), Late Archaic (NISP n = 2; MNE/MNI n = 2), or Middle Archaic (NISP n = 3;
MNE/MNI n = 2).
The large birds identified from the Arenosa Shelter sample were defined
as being in the medium body size category. They included geese, ducks, broadwinged hawks (members of the genus Buteo), turkey, gull, roadrunner, and an
unidentified species of large bird. Most large birds were found in Terminal Late
Archaic strata (NISP n = 17; MNE/MNI n = 12), with fewer found in either Late
Archaic (NISP n = 11; MNE/MNI n = 11) or Middle Archaic (NISP n = 2;
MNE/MNI n = 2) strata. The turkey was found only in the Terminal Late Archaic
strata (NISP n = 1; MNE/MNI n = 1). A gull of the family Laridae (NISP n = 1;
MNE/MNI n = 1) was found in Late Archaic strata, as was the roadrunner (NISP
n = 1; MNE/MNI n = 1). Broad-winged hawks (genus Buteo) and accipitrid
122

hawks were found primarily in Late Archaic context (NISP n = 7; MNE/MNI n =
5), although they were also found in Terminal Late Archaic strata (NISP n = 4;
MNE/MNI n = 4).
A single dabbling duck fragment (mallard, Anas platyrhynchus) was found
in Terminal Late Archaic strata, while three other specimens separately
identifiable as members of the family Anatidae were also found in these strata.
One of those was mallard-sized, one was wood duck-sized, and one was only
identifiable to family. Dabbling duck fragments were also identified from Late
Archaic or Middle Archaic strata, with teal and gadwall both represented by
single individuals. Diving ducks were also present in Late Archaic strata.
Canvasback (NISP n = 2; MNE/MNI n = 1), redhead or scaup (NISP n = 1;
MNE/MNI n = 1), and an unidentified diving duck (NISP n = 1; MNE/MNI n = 1)
being represented. Geese genera Chen and Branta were only present in the Late
Archaic, with both being represented by single specimens. Similarly, a large duck
or small goose was represented by one specimen.
Small birds included small hawks, such as the Mississippi kite (Ictinia
mississippiensis) and sparrow hawk (Falco sparverius), white-winged dove
(Zenaida asiatica), and two species of quail—the Bobwhite (Colinus virginianus)
and the scaled quail (Callipepla squamata). Small birds were isolated within
strata of Late Archaic or Terminal Late Archaic ages. The NISP for small birds is
dissimilar for the Terminal Late Archaic (n = 35) and Late Archaic (n = 17). The
MNE/MNI frequency is more for Terminal Late Archaic (n = 21) than for Late
Archaic (n = 12). Quail were the most common small bird during the Late
Archaic and Terminal Late Archaic, but are more common in the Late Archaic
123

(NISP n = 30; MNE/MNI n = 19) than during the Terminal Late Archaic (NISP n
= 14; MNE/MNI n = 8).

The white-winged dove and small hawks were

represented by very few specimens in each cultural stage.
Small mammals such as the gopher, common muskrat, wood rat, cotton
rat, rock squirrel, gray squirrel, and two species of ground squirrels were present
in significant numbers, but were never as common as rabbits during any of the
latter cultural stages. The small mammal NISP for Late Prehistoric – Historic
strata was very sparse (n = 5), while Terminal Late Archaic strata contained
significantly higher NISP frequencies (n = 110 and n = 52). Middle Archaic
strata had about the same NISP frequency for small mammals as did Late
Prehistoric – Historic strata (n = 4). Review of the MNE/MNI measures also
revealed differences between the Late Prehistoric – Historic (n = 3), Terminal
Late Archaic (n = 67), and Late Archaic (n = 16), with Middle Archaic strata (n =
3) again being similar to Late Prehistoric – Historic strata.
The frequency of smaller fish was lower in the Late Prehistoric and
Historic stages (NISP n = 1; MNE/MNI n = 149) than during the Terminal Late
Archaic (NISP n = 41; MNE/MNI n = 20) and Late Archaic (NISP n = 4;
MNE/MNI n = 3). Smaller fish were less frequent than fish of medium body size,
the most frequent size class of fish reported in Tables 5.10 and 5.11. Medium
large fish were uncommon in the Late Prehistoric – Historic (NISP n = 7;
MNE/MNI n = 4), but considerably more common in the preceding Terminal Late
Archaic (NISP n = 126; MNE/MNI n = 35), Late Archaic (NISP n = 23;
MNE/MNI n = 6). The Middle Archaic frequency of medium large fish was
closer to that of the Late Prehistoric (NISP n = 8; MNE/MNI n = 6).
124

Reptiles and amphibians were both only present during the Late Archaic
and afterwards. Two species of ranid frogs were present in the Arenosa Shelter
fauna, with the bullfrog (Rana catesbiana) found in Late Archaic (NISP n = 2;
MNE/MNI n = 1) strata and the leopard frog (Rana pipiens) found in the Terminal
Late Archaic (NISP n = 3; MNE/MNI n = 12).
Among the reptiles, at least four different snakes were present, two of
them venomous. No snake remains were present in contexts earlier than the Late
Archaic. The non-venomous colubrids were present during the Terminal Late
Archaic. They included the bullsnake (Pituophis sp. left dentale, NISP n = 1;
MNE/MNI n = 1) and a form that could not be differentiated between the racer
(Coluber constrictor) and coachwhip (Masticophis flagellum) (right dentale and
vertebra; NISP n = 2; MNE/MNI n = 1). The crotalids included the Western
diamondback rattlesnake (Crotalus atrox) and the copperhead (Agkistrodon
contortrix). Vertebrae from the copperhead were identified from Late Prehistoric
– Historic (NISP n = 1; MNE/MNI n = 1) and Terminal Late Archaic strata (NISP
n = 1; MNE/MNI n = 1). A large vertebra from the Western diamondback
rattlesnake was found in Late Archaic deposits (NISP n = 1; MNE/MNI n = 1). A
left mandible specimen identified to Crotalus sp. (NISP n = 1; MNE/MNI n = 1)
was found in Terminal Late Archaic strata, while a vertebra specimen that could
not be differentiated between Crotalus sp. and Agkistrodon sp. was identified
from Terminal Late Archaic strata (NISP n = 1; MNE/MNI n = 1). Vertebrae
specimens that could only be identified as crotalid were identified in Terminal
Late Archaic (NISP n = 1; MNE/MNI n = 1) and Late Archaic (NISP n = 1;
MNE/MNI n = 1) strata.
125

Turtles were the most common reptile and, like the snakes, were found in
Middle3 Archaic and later strata. Turtles were considered to be medium-sized
animals.

Three individual turtle genera were identified, along with

undifferentiated members of the family Testudinidae, and a fragment that could
only be identified to the sub-class Chelonia. Among the more confidently
identified turtles, spiny softshell turtles (Trionyx spiniferus) were the most
common and were identified from Late Prehistoric – Historic (NISP n = 4;
MNE/MNI n = 3), Terminal Late Archaic (NISP n = 28; MNE/MNI n = 8), Late
Archaic (NISP n = 6; MNE/MNI n = 3), and Middle Archaic (NISP n = 4;
MNE/MNI n = 3) strata. The snapping turtle (Chelydra serpentina) was
identified in from Late Archaic deposits (NISP n = 1; MNE/MNI n = 1), while a
slider (Pseudemys sp.) was present in Terminal Late Archaic deposits (NISP n =
2; MNE/MNI n = 1). The undifferentiated testudinid specimens were identified
from Late Prehistoric – Historic (NISP n = 1; MNE/MNI n = 1) and Late Archaic
(NISP n = 1; MNE/MNI n = 1) contexts. The specimen that could only be
identified to sub-class Chelonia was found in Terminal Late Archaic deposits
(NISP n = 1; MNE/MNI n = 1).

126

Age and Sex Identification
Age and sex determination was approached using several methods of
investigation. Several methods were used to determine the relative age of
individuals represented by specimens. The first, used with most mammals,
combined taxon-specific tooth replacement and wear characteristics, taxonspecific long bone epiphyses fusion schedules, relative element size, and skeletal
surface texture to assign a relative age to specimens. In some cases, relative age
assignments were more specific and based on taxon-specific previous research
that had produced narrow age-classes on the basis of observed tooth eruption and
wear or bone epiphyses fusion schedules, such as those reported by Severinghaus
(1949) for deer, etc.
A second method for relative age determination was used specifically with
fish and relied on data that Carlander (1970, 1977) reported concerning the sexual
maturation age and size of most fish. They become active reproductively between
the third and fifth year of life, especially in warm waters. For most of the larger
fish taxa identified for the Arenosa Shelter faunal sample, such as catfish, suckers,
bass, and gar, this would occur within a length range of about 200 – 350 mm.
Smaller taxa, such as sunfish, mature earlier and at a smaller size, 100 – 150 mm.
A more specific method was used in a limited manner and relied on a count of the
number of growth annuli observed on vertebral centra. This method is commonly
used in zoology and fisheries studies as an adjunct to similar studies of annuli in
fin spines. The method is time consuming under the best of circumstances. It is
not considered accurate or reliable by fisheries researchers in determining the age
of fish taken from warmer waters, such as those in the lower Pecos River and
127

much of Texas. The basis of their concern is that the warmer climate in the
region does not allow sufficient seasonal differences in water temperatures to
cause growth to cease during cold weather (D. Hendrickson, 1998:personal
communication; G. Powell, January, 2003:personal communication). Such lack
of seasonal growth rate does not allow the bone density differences to develop
that result in formation of strong annuli and often result in multiple weak annuli
per year.
The detailed examination of the 4,900 specimens during this analysis
resulted in 2,380 individual entries recorded in the FileMaker Pro database. Age
observations were differentiated into four classes. Among the database entries,
117 were listed as juvenile, 165 as subadult, 2,079 as adult, and 15 as old
individuals.
Total NISP for all juveniles is 131, with an MNE/MNI of 62. As could be
expected from the preceding description of the fauna recovered from Arenosa
Shelter, cottontail rabbits are the most numerous of the juvenile forms recovered
(NISP n = 68; MNE/MNI n = 26). Jackrabbits are also very numerous (NISP n =
17; MNE/MNI n = 11). Small rodents were common as carnivores (NISP n = 16;
MNE/MNI n = 9).

Carnivores were almost as numerous (NISP n = 12;

MNE/MNI n = 3), with the most common taxon being a coyote or large dog-sized
Canis sp. (NISP n = 10; MNE/MNI n = 1). Deer were also numerous (NISP n =
9; MNE/MNI n = 7) with single mule deer and white-tailed deer individuals being
identified as part of the composite deer total. Juvenile non-specific mammal
fragments were present (NISP n = 2; MNE/MNI n = 2), as were juvenile

128

generalized bird fragments (NISP n = 2; MNE/MNI n = 2). Single juvenile quail
and softshell turtle individuals were also recognized in the sample.
Age of individual was recorded as subadult in 165 of the sample’s records.
Total NISP for all subadult individuals is 188, with an MNE/MNI of 79. As with
the juveniles, rabbits are most common (NISP n = 128; MNE/MNI n = 46).
Cottontails constituted the bulk of the subadult rabbit remains (NISP n = 109;
MNE/MNI n = 39), with the larger jackrabbits contributing almost 15 per cent of
the composite subadult rabbit remains (NISP n = 19; MNE/MNI n = 7). Other
subadult medium-sized mammals were less common (NISP n = 9; MNE/MNI n =
9). Canids made up the bulk of these, with the gray fox (NISP n = 3; MNE/MNI
n = 3) being more common than the larger coyote or domestic dog (NISP n = 1;
MNE/MNI n = 1), fox-sized canid (NISP n = 1; MNE/MNI n = 1), or generalized
canid (NISP n = 1; MNE/MNI n = 1). Single subadult specimens also represented
raccoon and beaver.
Subadult large mammal remains were also relatively common (NISP n =
24; MNE/MNI n = 10), with deer (NISP n = 15; MNE/MNI n = 7) being the most
frequent subadult large mammal. Bison antiquus (NISP n = 1; MNE/MNI n = 1)
and a non-specific large mammal (NISP n = 6; MNE/MNI n = 1) made up the
remainder of the fragments recognized as subadult large mammal in the earliest
levels of the site. In the uppermost levels of the site, a subadult sheep or goat
(NISP n = 2; MNE/MNI n = 1) was also recorded.
Small mammals were the least common (NISP n = 12; MNE/MNI n = 6)
body size range subadults represented in the sample. The most frequent small
mammal subadults were the rock squirrel (NISP n = 5; MNE/MNI n = 2) and
129

woodrat (NISP n = 4; MNE/MNI n = 2), followed by muskrat (NISP n = 2;
MNE/MNI n = 1) and cottonrat (NISP n = 1; MNE/MNI n = 1). Fragments of
non-specific small mammal bone (NISP n = 3; MNE/MNI n = 3) recognized as
subadult were also present.
Age of individual was recorded as old in 15 of the sample’s records. Total
NISP for all old individuals is 15, with an MNE/MNI of 9. Over half of the
specimens identified as old individuals were raccoon (NISP n = 8; MNE/MNI n =
2). Other specimens identified as old individuals included single individuals of
deer (NISP n =1), cottonrat (NISP n = 2), woodrat (NISP n =1), white-throated
woodrat (NISP n = 2), beaver (NISP n =1), and rock squirrel (NISP n =1).
Fragments of adults made up the remainder of the sample. Total NISP for
adults was 4,576, with an MNE/MNI of 840. As may be expected from previous
discussion, mammal remains are very frequent and were cataloged in 1,434 of the
records from the Arenosa Shelter faunal sample. Fragments identifiable only to
adult Mammalia and Osteichthyes were common when only NISP was considered
(629 and 254, respectively), although their frequency dropped dramatically when
only MNE or MNI were considered (10 and 20, respectively).
Cottontail rabbits were the most abundant adult mammal remains
identifiable to the most specific taxon (NISP n = 1128; MNE/MNI n = 112).
Adult jackrabbits were also very common (NISP n = 393; MNE/MNI n = 66).
Mature deer were common, with 261 individual specimens identified (NISP n).
These specimens represent 49 individuals (MNE/MNI). Within the adult deer
category, fragments of adult mule deer (NISP n = 16; MNE/MNI = 9) and adult
white-tailed deer (NISP n = 14; MNE/MNI = 7) were identified to species. Other
130

adult large mammals represented included domestic sheep or goat (NISP n = 14;
MNE/MNI = 2 that includes a subadult), Bison bison (NISP n = 4; MNE/MNI =
2), Bison antiquus (NISP n = 90; MNE/MNI = 9), horse (NISP n = 6; MNE/MNI
= 3), pronghorn antelope (NISP n = 6; MNE/MNI = 6), and a large Pleistoceneaged deer that was between the sizes of the mule deer and elk (NISP n = 1;
MNE/MNI = 1).
Fragments of adult birds were significantly less common than mammals,
with a total of 67 records resulting in an NISP n = 84 and an MNE/MNI n = 56.
Adult hawks (NISP n = 17; MNE/MNI n = 12), ducks and geese (NISP n = 13;
MNE/MNI n = 10), and quail (NISP n = 32; MNE/MNI n = 18) were the most
common adult birds represented in the Arenosa Shelter faunal sample analysis.
Non-specific fragments identifiable to avian class were also present (NISP n = 9;
MNE/MNI n = 8). Also present in very low frequencies were remains of an adult
gull, turkey, and roadrunner (for each, NISP n = 1; MNE/MNI n = 1).
All fragments of reptiles were of sufficient size and characteristics to be
identified as adult (NISP n = 58; MNE/MNI n = 31). Likewise, the amphibian
remains were from adult individuals (NISP n = 5; MNE/MNI n = 3).
Adult fish fragments identifiable beyond class were very common (NISP n
= 1,103). Due to recovery methods that effectively precluded recovering
fragments of the smallest size classes of fish remains, all fish fragments were
considered to represent adults for the purposes of this study. In the limited
number of cases where vertebral annuli were counted (NISP n = 15), annuli
counts ranged upward from 5 to 25. Species represented included the black
buffalo, river carpsucker, flathead catfish, and blue or channel catfish. Vertebra
131

were identified to the most appropriate taxonomic level based on detailed
comparison of distinctive morphology and surface textured with modern
specimens from TMM-VPL. The qualitative relationship between size and
observed number of growth annuli is presented in Table 5.12 and is based on
observed specimens.
Differentiation between sexes confirmed in only a very limited number of
cases (NISP n = 28) with very few taxa. Taxa included Bison antiquus,
Odocoileus sp., and Castor canadensis. Distinctive skull fragments of a single
female Odocoileus sp. were identified in Late Archaic strata. Based on size in
comparison to a sexed known age reference specimen, a molar from an old male
beaver was identified from Late Prehistoric – Historic strata. Adult male
Odocoileus sp. deer remains (NISP n = 6; MNE/MNI n = 5) were identified from
Late Prehistoric – Historic, Terminal Late Archaic, and Late Archaic contexts in
the Arenosa Shelter faunal sample, based on identification of antler fragments,
long bone fragments with heavy muscle scars, and overall size and robustness of
fragments. Remains of male Bison antiquus (NISP n = 20; MNE/MNI n = 2)
were recovered from Paleoindian-age contexts.

Differentiation of sexual

characteristics for this taxon was based on comparison with published
comparisons of sexual dimorphism in Bison antiquus skull and horn core
characteristics for the young bull that made up Feature 18 in stratum 40. Other
Bison antiquus remains of appropriate appendicular elements were too
fragmentary to reliably compare to published data that would allow the sex of the
animal to be distinguished.

132

BUTCHERING PATTERNS
Evidence of cultural modification of animal remains was recorded in 444
of the 2,380 individual records from the Arenosa Shelter faunal sample. A total
of 566 individual specimens (NISP n) were considered to be culturally modified,
resulting in an MNE/MNI of 454. Skeletal materials from the skull, axial, and
appendicular regions exhibited evidence of damage from butchering or heat,
sensu Binford (1981b) and Shipman, et al. (1984b). Most fragments with heat
damage are recognized as problematic and reflecting bone disposal rather than
cooking. A differential patterning of heat damage, reflected in color differences,
indicates direct evidence of roasting with flesh still attached that insulated
portions of the bone from burning. Taxa modified in these fashions included fish,
birds, turtles, and a wide range of mammals.
Cultural modifications were considerably more prevalent among remains
of large and medium mammals than small mammals. Culturally modified large
mammal remains included deer, bison, pronghorn antelope, and goat/sheep.
Medium mammal remains exhibiting modifications included carnivores, rabbits,
and beaver. Among the small mammals represented in the Arenosa Shelter faunal
collection, only the remains of rock squirrels (NISP n = 3; MNE/MNI n = 3) were
culturally modified with butchering damage. While these rock squirrel remains
were found in the same unit and stratum, (N200/W170, Stratum 9), two were
found in three separate lots of material from two separate excavation cuts (1 and
2).
Fragments identifiable only to Class Mammalia included an NISP n of 46;
MNE/MNI n = 20. Two of these fragments were identified as small – medium
133

mammal; both were burned and calcinated, coming from Late Archaic contexts.
Remains of two separate medium to large mammals (NISP n = 2; MNE/MNI n =
2) were culturally modified by helical fracturing and/or burning. A limb bone
fragment from Late Prehistoric/Historic context was burned, split longitudinally,
ground to shape, and polished. It was recognizable as a probable tool fragment.
A ventral mandible fragment from a subadult individual in Middle Archaic
context was fractured transversely on its proximal end. Large mammal fragments
(NISP n = 14; MNE/MNI = 4) from three separate contexts exhibit damage from
burning or helical fracturing. The contexts represented include Late Prehistoric –
Historic, Late Archaic, and Middle Archaic. The remainder of the fragments
identifiable only to Mammalia exhibits damage primarily from burning,
sometimes intense enough to produce calcination (NISP n = 28; MNE/MNI n =
12). One fragment was a possible limb bone roughly 1 cm in diameter that has
deep cut marks resulting in a transverse groove and snap fracture.
Remains of medium sized mammalian carnivores (NISP n = 19;
MNE/MNI n = 19) show cultural modification primarily through presence of
butchery damage (fracturing or cutmarks), although several (NISP n = 5;
MNE/MNI n = 5) show evidence of burning only or in combination with butchery
damage. Those with butchery damage (NISP n = 14; MNE/MNI n = 14) include
gray fox, kit fox, dog and/or coyote, raccoon, ringtail, and badger. Among the
carnivore remains with butchery damage are bones of the head and extremities.
Several skull fragments (NISP n = 3; MNE/MNI n = 3) from Late Prehistoric –
Historic context exhibit longitudinal cutmarks between the tooth row and
infraorbital foramen on bucchal aspect of the maxilla or shallow transverse
134

cutmarks along the supraorbital arch and temporal line on the superior aspect of
the frontal. These included remains of a gray fox, raccoon, and coyote. Five
mandibular fragments (NISP n = 5; MNE/MNI n = 4) from Late Prehistoric –
Historic context exhibited damage from butchery or burning and included gray
fox, ringtail, and badger. This was primarily transverse cutmarks along the
ventral margin of the element that resulted in separation of the anterior element
under the middle of the tooth row in the vicinity of the first molar. One of the
gray fox mandible specimens had cutmarks flanking the condylar fossa at the
element’s articulation.
Carnivore axial or appendicular remains from Late Prehistoric – Historic,
Terminal and earlier Late Archaic, and Middle Archaic context exhibited cultural
modifications that consisted of burning or butchery damage. The modified
remains (NISP n = 10; MNE/MNI n = 10) were those of coyote or domestic dog,
gray fox, desert fox, a subadult undetermined small canid, and an adult large foxsized canid. Three of these specimens were damaged by heat (Middle Archaic
desert fox, Late Prehistoric – Historic coyote or domestic dog, and juvenile Late
Prehistoric – Historic coyote or domestic dog) and a third (Middle Archaic coyote
or domestic dog) was modified only by helical fracturing of the element.
Cutmarks on specimens are in positions and orientations to sever muscles at joints
for dismemberment (e.g. distal epiphysis of humerus with transverse cutmarks
adjacent to medial epicondyle), to deflesh elements (longitudinal “filleting” cuts
on diaphysis of humerus), or to remove distal portions of limbs in process of
skinning (transverse cuts on posterior aspect of distal femur diaphysis, transverse
cutmarks on distal portion of tibia and fibula).
135

Culturally modified leporid remains (NISP n = 126; MNE/MNI n = 126)
included fragments of 49 jackrabbits (NISP and MNE/MNI) and 77 cottontails
(NISP MNE/MNI). Burning affected jackrabbit remains (NISP n = 9; MNE/MNI
n = 6) to a limited extent, with the effects of burning ranging from minor
discoloration of portions of elements to total calcination. In some cases, the
burning evidence indicates a lack of heat discoloration on flesh-covered portions
of elements, a pattern that may be interpreted as supporting secondary butchering
following cooking. Three of these also have butchering damage that includes
cutmarks.
A total of 33 jackrabbit specimens (NISP n) exhibit butchering damage
and represent 22 individuals (MNE/MNI n) from Late Prehistoric – Historic to
Late Archaic context. The butchering damage is primarily cutmarks in positions
and orientations to sever muscles and connective tissues at joints for
dismemberment (e.g. distal epiphysis of humerus with transverse cutmarks
adjacent to medial epicondyle; transverse cutmarks on body of pelvis immediately
anterior to acetabulum; oblique cutmarks on distal femur just proximal to medial
supracondylar tuberosity; transverse cutmarks on cranial aspect of proximal tibia
to sever tendons; transverse cutmarks on distal tibia immediately proximal to
lateral maleolus and on caudal aspect immediately proximal to perineum muscle
sulcus; and transverse cutmarks on distal caudal aspect of humerus immediately
proximal to olecranon fossa to sever triceps brachii muscle; transverse cutmarks
on the supraglenoid tubercle of the scapula to sever the infraspinatus and deltoid
muscles). Cutmarks are also in positions and orientations to deflesh elements
(longitudinal or diagonal “filleting” cuts on diaphysis of humerus; transverse or
136

diagonal cutmarks on caudal aspect of tibia diaphysis proximal to fibula
insertion), or to remove distal portions of limbs in process of skinning (transverse
cutmarks on distal aspect of tibia; transverse cutmarks on ventral dorsal and
ventral aspects of proximal metatarsal). Similar to carnivore remains, one
jackrabbit specimen from an early to mid-Late Archaic context exhibited
cutmarks on the diastema portion of the mandible.
Cottontail remains also show evidence similar to the jackrabbits. A total
of 73 specimens (NISP n; MNE/MNI n = 75) were culturally modified in some
fashion, with almost half (NISP n = 33; MNE/MNI n = 33) affected by burning.
Butchering damage is little different than that documented for jackrabbits, with
cutmarks in positions and orientations to sever muscles and connective tissues at
joints for dismemberment, to deflesh elements, and to remove the skin. Mirroring
the evidence for jackrabbits, evidence of skinning is provided by cutmarks on
cottontail metatarsals, although no parallel to the skinning damage on jackrabbit
mandible was found among the cottontail remains. However, cutmarks were
documented on the dorsal margin of the pelvis and are interpreted as skinning
damage. The metatarsal and pelvic skinning evidence is found in a Late Archaic
context; faint cutmarks on the distal caudal-medial aspect of cottontail tibiae
provided evidence of skinning from Late Prehistoric/Historic context. Contrary to
the pattern for jackrabbits, there is no evidence on the Arenosa Shelter’s sample
cottontail scapulae or pelves for disarticulation of the shoulder or hip joints
facilitated by severing muscles or connective tissues at the articulation itself.
Disarticulation of these joints in cottontails may have been accomplished in
different fashion, with severing of muscles on the proximal femur or humerus and
137

occasional fracturing of the element diaphysis instead. As with jackrabbits,
evidence for burning damage indicates a lack of heat discoloration (“smoking” or
more intense darkening) on flesh-covered portions of elements. This pattern may
be interpreted as supporting secondary butchering following skinning and
cooking.
Culturally modified rodent remains were documented in Late Prehistoric –
Historic and Late Archaic contexts, all modified by skinning or butchering
damage. One specimen each of beaver and muskrat were recovered from Late
Prehistoric – Historic context. The beaver specimen is a metatarsal fragment
modified in the same fashion as lagomorph and carnivore specimens showing
skinning damage. The muskrat specimen is a tibia fragment with mid-diaphysis
caudal-medial cutmarks that may have severed connective tissues to allow
disarticulation or allowed removal of the pelt. Three rock squirrel fragments from
Late Archaic context, two pelvic and one tibia diaphysis. The tibia fragment has
shallow cutmarks on its lateral aspect that allowed connective tissues to be
severed. Cutmarks on the two pelvic fragments are posterior to the acetabulum
and allowed disarticulation of the hip joint by severing the gluteus minimus
muscle and connective tissues.
Culturally modified bird remains were rare and consisted of the lower
limb bones of quail (NISP n = 2; MNE/MNI n = 2), diving duck (NISP n = 1;
MNE/MNI n = 1), and hawk (NISP n = 3; MNE/MNI n = 1). One hawk (redtailed or red-shouldered) tibiotarsus specimen from Late Prehistoric – Historic
context was burned only, the diving duck specimen from Late Archaic context
was slightly burned similar to the partially burned rabbit specimens and had
138

dismemberment cutmarks on the distal caudal aspect. Two quail tibiotarsae, one
each from Late Prehistoric – Historic and Late Archaic context, exhibited
defleshing cutmarks on the cranial aspect. One Late Archaic Cooper’s hawksized acciptrid femur specimen exhibited dismemberment cutmarks on its caudolateral surface. A second red-shouldered hawk distal tibiotarsus specimen, from
Late Archaic context, exhibits distinct deep transverse fractures of the grooveand-snap variety.
Six turtle specimens (NISP n; MNE/MNI n = 4) were culturally modified.
Four of these were burned carapace specimens. One was a testudinid specimen
from an upper Late Archaic context. The others (NISP n = 3) of these were spiny
softshell turtle specimens from the same lower Late Archaic context and were
considered to be from two individuals (MNE/MNI n = 2). Two spiny softshell
turtle femur fragments from upper Late Archaic or lower Terminal Late Archaic
context had transverse dismemberment cutmarks.
Culturally modified fish remains were common (NISP n = 161;
MNE/MNI n = 108). Of these, 69 (NISP n; MNE/MNI n = 46) had signs of heat
alteration. Within this group, 10 specimens (NISP n; MNE/MNI n = 8) also had
butchering damage. The remainder (NISP n = 91; MNE/MNI n = 60) was
modified by cutmarks associated with butchering or tool manufacture, polish,
grinding, possible drilling, or possible human tooth marks. Elements modified in
this fashion consist of vertebral centra and pectoral or dorsal spines. Vertebral
centra of a variety of fish taxa were represented in the non-burned, culturallymodified sample, including catfish, gar, buffalo and carpsucker, white bass, and

139

freshwater drum. All of these specimens came from Late Prehistoric – Historic or
Late Archaic context and show a similar pattern of butchering damage.
Specific modification of vertebrae consists of cutmarks on the dorsal,
lateral, and/or ventral aspects of vertebral centra parallel to the long axis of the
body. In some cases, these cutmarks extend onto haemal or neural spines, neural
arch, or transverse processes from the centra themselves. A total of 67 vertebral
centra or haemal and neural arch fragments (NISP n) were modified in such a
manner, representing 41 individuals (MNE/MNI n = 41). An additional specimen
exhibited tooth marks on its margins, possibly related to human mastication rather
than carnivore ravaging (Jones 1986; Wheeler and Jones 1989).
Spines of catfish and freshwater drum are also modified, most typically by
transverse cutmarks. Only a few drum spines (NISP n = 4; MNE/MNI n = 3)
were modified in this manner, all dorsal spines with cutmarks on the posterior
aspect. One of these was also polished on its anterior aspect.
In the case of catfish spines, 23 specimens (NISP n; MNE/MNI n = 22)
exhibited transverse or oblique cutmarks on the shaft or near the articulation at its
base, or some other modification of the shaft or articulation. Three blue catfish
pectoral spine specimen from Late Prehistoric – Historic context were broken
near the base of the shaft of the spine and beveled in an arc from anterior to
posterior. The break in one case was a groove and snap fracture, with the
articulation on this specimen exhibiting possible drilling. Almost half of the
catfish spines (NISP n = 11; MNE/MNI n = 11) had cutmarks at the base of the
spine or on the articulation itself (ventral or anterior processes) that would have
severed muscles at the articulation. Two of these specimens had a slight to
140

significant polish evident on the shaft or its distal end. The remainder had
transverse or oblique cutmarks on the shaft.
The largest group of culturally modified faunal remains from the Arenosa
Shelter collection is from artiodactyl large mammals. A total of 169 specimens
(NISP n) represent 146 individuals (MNE/MNI n). Of these specimens, almost a
third (NISP n = 50; MNE/MNI n = 42) exhibit signs of heat modification of
differing intensity. A few of these burned specimens (NISP n = 4; MNE/MNI n =
4) were exposed to intense heat and were calcined. Most were less intensely
burned over part or their entire surface. Five specimens (NISP n; MNE/MNI n =
3) were “smoked” and had minimal heat discoloration. Burned artiodactyl
remains were recovered from Late Prehistoric – Historic to early to mid-Late
Archaic contexts.
Approximately 84 percent of the specimens (NISP n = 141; MNE/MNI n
= 124) are modified through either fractures interpreted to be human-induced or
through the cutmarks of butchering. Cutmarks are present on almost 48 percent
of the culturally modified artiodactyl specimens (NISP n = 81), representing 67
individuals (MNE/MNI n). Remnants of human-induced fractures are present on
a similar percentage of specimens (NISP n = 79; MNE/MNI n = 77). Such
fractures represent fragmentation of the elements for marrow recovery during the
latter stages of butchering or incorporation of bone into some stage of tool
manufacture as a raw material.
Artiodactyl remains with butchering or heat damage were recovered from
the lowest Paleoindian to Late Prehistoric – Historic contexts. Bison, deer,
pronghorn, domestic sheep or goat, and an undifferentiated artiodactyl form are
141

represented in culturally modified remains from the Arenosa Shelter faunal
sample.
The evidence for cultural modification of bison in Paleoindian context is
vague because much of the bone is in deteriorated condition and has been
carnivore-ravaged. None of the bone from Paleoindian context is burned. Two
individuals (MNE/MNI n=2) are represented by these 20 Bison antiquus
specimens (NISP n=20) from Stratum 42 in the deepest excavated portion of
Arenosa Shelter. One bison phalange is marked by two possible cutmarks. The
other fragments represent a single bison radius that was marked by a transverse
cut mark across the insertion for the brachialis muscle, distal to the radial
tuberosity. The Bison antiquus remains from Stratum 40 also have only vague
evidence for cultural modification and are discussed more fully in Chapter 7.
Due to extreme disturbance of the Early Archaic deposits in the site, very
little evidence is available for procurement and use of artiodactyls. A single
burned fragment of deer metatarsal was recovered from Early Archaic context in
Stratum 32.
Evidence of butchered deer, mule deer, pronghorn, and an undifferentiated
artiodactyl was present in Middle Archaic context within strata 12 – 30 (NISP n =
68 and MNE/MNI n = 47). Elements marked by dismemberment or defleshing
cutmarks included 31 specimens (NISP n) representing 15 individuals
(MNE/MNI). Dismemberment evidence included scapula, metapodial, and tibia
fragments marked by transverse cutmarks proximally or by cutmarks along their
margins.

Defleshing cutmarks were found on deer scapula fragments as

transverse cutmarks and scrape marks parallel to the long axis of the element.
142

Fragmentation for marrow removal was found on 19 specimens (NISP n),
representing 18 individuals (MNE/MNI).

Fracturing, grooving, and other

modifications for tool manufacture were also found on several fragments.
Contexts with Late Archaic materials in strata 10 – 11 yielded evidence
for cultural modification of deer. Fragments of burned deer remains from these
contexts include 8 specimens (NISP n), representing 8 individuals (MNE/MNI n).
Evidence of butchering was present on 7 specimens (NISP n) marked by skinning,
dismemberment, or defleshing cutmarks representing 7 individuals (MNE/MNI).
Fragmentation for marrow removal was found on 3 specimens (NISP n),
representing 3 individuals (MNE/MNI).

Longitudinal grooving for tool

manufacture was also found on 2 fragments.
Deer dismemberment evidence from Late Archaic context included
transverse cutmarks on scapula articulations, hind foot, skull, and proximal tibia
fragments. Defleshing cutmarks were found as longitudinal scrapes and transverse
cutmarks on scapula; stylohyoid, and proximal radius fragments. Fragmentation
for marrow removal, bone grease production, or modification for tool
manufacture was found on 7 specimens (NISP n) from Late Archaic contexts in
strata 10 - 11, representing 7 individuals (MNE/MNI). Fragmentation for
retrieval of fats residing in skeletal elements was found on 5 specimens (NISP n;
MNE/MNI n = 5). Evidence consisting of helical or spiral fractures on element
diaphyses or internal negative flake scars on element diaphysis fragments
indicates marrow removal rather than preparation for bone grease production.
Evidence for bone modification leading to potential tool manufacture or use was
detected on 2 specimens (NISP n; MNE/MNI n = 2) and consisted of longitudinal
143

splitting of metapodial elements, grinding of resulting fracture edges, and heavy
polish of element and edge surfaces.
The Terminal Late Archaic context from Arenosa Shelter produced
evidence for culturally modified artiodactyl remains in Strata 3 - 9 that included
99 specimens (NISP n) of deer, mule deer, pronghorn, and an undifferentiated
artiodactyl.

These were the remnants of 16 individuals (MNE/MNI n).

Fragments of burned artiodactyl remains from this context included 29 specimens
(NISP n) of deer or mule deer, representing 10 individuals (MNE/MNI n). Six of
these specimens have irregular heat damage indicated roasting with attached
flesh. Evidence of butchering was present on 47 specimens (NISP n) marked by
skinning, dismemberment, or defleshing cutmarks representing 16 individuals
(MNE/MNI). Fragmentation for marrow removal or bone grease production was
present on long bone and scapular fragments of deer, mule deer, pronghorn, and
undesignated artiodactyls, (NISP n = 33; MNE/MNI n = 14). Bone modification
leading to tool manufacture or use was detected on 5 tool fragment or
manufacturing debris specimens (NISP n; MNE/MNI n = 5). The evidence for
tool manufacturing modification consisted of longitudinal splitting of metapodial
elements, scraping or grinding of resulting fracture edges and surfaces, and heavy
polish of element and edge surfaces.
Arenosa Shelter’s Late Prehistoric – Historic context from above Stratum
3 yielded culturally modified artiodactyl remains from white-tailed deer,
unidentified deer, pronghorn, domestic sheep or goat, and unidentified
artiodactyls (NISP n = 12; MNE/MNI n = 4). Fragments of burned artiodactyl
remains from these contexts include one specimen each of deer and domestic
144

sheep or goat (NISP n = 2; MNE/MNI n = 2), although the burning evidence is
not conclusively related to cooking. Evidence of butchering from Late Prehistoric
– Historic context was present on 3 artiodactyl specimens (NISP n), representing
an MNE/MNI n = 3.

These included elements of deer, pronghorn, and

unidentified artiodactyls marked by defleshing cutmarks.
Fragmentation for marrow removal, bone grease production, or bone
modification for potential tool manufacture was found on 9 specimens (NISP n)
from Late Prehistoric – Historic context, representing 4 individuals (MNE/MNI)
that included white-tailed deer, unidentified deer, pronghorn, and unidentified
artiodactyl. Fragmentation for retrieval of fats residing in skeletal elements was
found on 8 specimens (NISP n; MNE/MNI n = 4). Evidence consisted of helical
or spiral fractures on element diaphyses, internal negative flake scars on elements,
and external blow-marks. Evidence for bone modification during tool
manufacture or use was detected on one tool fragment (NISP n; MNE/MNI n = 1)
and consisted of longitudinal splitting of metapodial elements and grinding of
resulting fracture edges.

Chapter 6: Results of Bone Artifact Analysis
DESCRIPTION OF BONE ARTIFACT CATEGORIES
Analyses of bone and antler artifacts from Arenosa Shelter resulted in definition
of two artifact classes broadly differentiated on the basis of form and function. The
current analysis also revealed manufacturing and use wear characteristics from these
artifact classes.
Ornaments and implements comprised the two defined artifact classes. The
ornament class was primarily represented by segments of mammalian or avian long bone
or antler fashioned into beads. Other long, narrow, cylindrical bone artifacts are
problematical. Termed bone tubes, they may represent early stages in bone bead
manufacture or, alternatively, may have a different function. Implements served a more
utilitarian use and were typically undecorated.

Most artifacts in this class used

appendicular skeletal elements from large ruminant mammals as raw materials.
Appendicular elements from fish also were used as raw material for a small percentage of
implements.
Basis of Determination for Artifact Forms
The sample analyzed from Arenosa Shelter included a total of 547 artifacts.
These represent almost 55 per cent of the bone artifacts cataloged in the NPS artifact
collection from the site. The largest group of the artifacts were finished whole or
fragmentary items in the implement class, manufacturing byproducts, or early stages
from implement manufacture. Implements and their byproducts totaled approximately 56
per cent of the sample. Approximately 44 per cent of the sample was classified as
ornaments or their manufacturing debris. Most (30 per cent) were finished whole or
fragmentary items in this class. A further seven per cent consisted of early stages in the
146

manufacturing process for ornaments or byproducts.

Bone tubes constituted the

remainder of the sample, or another almost seven per cent that were possibly also within
the ornament class.
Manufacturing Characteristics
Bead manufacturing evidence in the sample included preforms, manufacturing
failures, and debitage (sensu Emery 2001:74). Debitage and manufacturing failures were
valuable because they contained epiphyses or articular ends of skeletal elements. The
presence of distinctive anatomical features on the epiphyses made the debitage more
identifiable than the isolated diaphyses that made up preforms, beads, or bead fragments.
A schematic description of selected bead forms and their associated manufacturing debris
is shown in Figure 15.
Conforming to standard terminology in the bone technology literature, proximal
refers to the un-worked or hafted end when describing tapering bone tool forms (Lemoine
1997:22, 2001:3). This end will often be broader and have an articular surface present
that may not be the anatomical proximal epiphysis of the skeletal element that the tool
blank was detached from.

Figure 16 graphically represents this relationship for

artiodactyl metatarsals, a common source of implement raw material in the Lower Pecos.

Debitage from Arenosa Shelter (Site 41VV99).
148

Figure 16: Lateral Schematic Comparison of Biological and Technological Anatomy of
Artiodactyl Metatarsal-Based Implements.
In addition to finished tools, manufacturing evidence for bone implements in
Arenosa Shelter’s bone artifact collection included bone blanks, preforms, and
byproducts that included manufacturing failures and debitage. Refitted or rejuvenated
broken tools, informal tools, and expedient tools were also recognized during the
analysis. Debitage, bone blanks, and manufacturing failures were valuable because they
contained more identifiable anatomical features than the isolated diaphyses making up
fragments of some tools and preforms. They also often contained clearer evidence of the
techniques used to manufacture implements from bone and antler obtained in subsistence
activities. Documentation of Lower Pecos implement manufacturing techniques used
procedures experimentally verified by Griffits (1997), Lemoine (1997:23 – 30), and
149

Olsen (1980) for Native American manufacturing signatures elsewhere in North America.
Characteristics of residual manufacturing criteria used in the present study are in Table
6.1.
Based on evidence from Arenosa Shelter, manufacturing techniques indicated a
specific sequence for most bone implement production in the Lower Pecos cultural area.
Techniques used to make formal tools included grooving or scoring with a lithic cutting
tool and subsequent snapping apart of blank and debitage, scraping, grinding to shape,
and polishing. Grooving included both longitudinal and circumferential directions on
long bones, especially metapodials from deer and pronghorn antelope. Verified by
microscopic examination of implements in the sample, scraping during manufacturing of
formal tools may have had two roles: to remove the periosteum covering the bone surface
and as an intermediate shaping method between grooving/snapping and grinding.
For informal tools, the manufacturing sequence was more variable. Dynamic
fracturing of skeletal elements using a siliceous hammerstone produced expedient tools
and smaller fragments that acted as blanks informal tool production. Several additional
techniques shaped the actual working edge on informal tools. Unifacial or bifacial
flaking produced a cutting edge, as did grinding. Scraping of the informal tools surfaces
with a siliceous stone tool to produce minor additional shaping was documented. The role
of scraping may have been only to remove the periosteal membrane.
Use Wear Characteristics
Following the manufacturing process, most ornaments and implements were used
and worn through further surface modification from friction (Rabinowicz 1965:109-112).
Friction alters surfaces through processes of attrition or addition and often results in a
surface polish acquired through physical or chemical means (Barwell 1979; Dowson
1979; Griffits and Bonsall 2001; Lemoine 1997:7-8; Ruff and Ludema 1986). The study
150

of wear patterns has proven very useful as bone technologists have adapted
methodologies and research orientation from the lithic technology research to explain
artifact function (Lemoine 1997:4-5). Extensive experimentation to verify use wear on
bone tools has occurred in bone technology research within the past 15 years. The results
of that research were adapted for the current study.
Documentation of use wear in the current study used procedures verified
experimentally by Lemoine (1997:Table 4.14), Griffits (1997, 2001), and Olsen (1980,
1989) for use wear signatures on Native American mammal bone-derived tools elsewhere
in North America. Although the structure of catfish spines is not the same as mammal
bone, it is similar enough to warrant inclusion here with use wear on mammal bone tools.
Characteristics of residual use wear criteria used in the present study are presented in
Table 6.2. As defined by Lemoine (1997:21), the terms invasive and non-invasive in
Table 6.2 refer to distribution of polish on bone artifacts. Invasive polishes cover all or
most of the surface when wear is present, including sides and bottoms of striations. They
are produced by a soft abrasive material conforming to the surface of an artifact. A noninvasive polish does not conform to the surface of an artifact, is produced by hard rigid
materials, and primarily affects high points on an artifact. Lemoine (1997:21) recognizes
that these two polish distributions form end points on a continuum.
Definition of Artifact Forms
Within the ornamentary artifact class, 40 forms of beads were defined. Several of
these forms had decorations of incised grooves or ground facets. Bead forms are defined
in Table 6.3 on the basis of manufacturing and use wear characteristics.
Within the implement class of artifacts, 29 basic forms were documented. These
are defined in Table 6.4 on the basis of manufacturing and use wear characteristics.

151

QUANTIFICATION AND CONTEXT IN CULTURAL ASSEMBLAGE
The bone artifact sample from Arenosa Shelter contained complete and
fragmentary ornaments, implements, manufacturing preforms and debris from a variety
of contexts. Discussion about the stratigraphic context of Arenosa Shelter’s
technologically modified bone follows the conventions defined in Chapter 2 and used in
earlier discussion of culturally modified faunal materials in Chapter 5. None of the bone
artifacts occurred within the Early Archaic or Paleoindian contexts in the site. All came
from Middle Archaic to Historic period cultural deposits in or above stratum 30 that were
less affected by flooding.
Quantification, Composition, and Context of General Cultural Assemblage
All of the defined artifact forms were based on observations from the Arenosa
Shelter bone artifact sample. About three per cent of the sample lacked vertical
provenience. Less than five per cent of the artifacts in the sample were from Historic or
Late Prehistoric contexts above stratum 3. The bulk of the sample, almost 60 percent,
originated in Terminal Late Archaic contexts within strata 3 – 9. The remainder of the
sample came from earlier Late Archaic (strata 10 – 11) or Middle Archaic contexts (strata
12 – 30). About eighteen (18.1) percent came from the site’s lower Late Archaic strata
and about fifteen (14.6) percent were deposited in Middle Archaic strata. A graphic
representation of this frequency distribution is shown in Figure 17.

Mammalian appendicular skeletal material and antler supplied most raw materials
for bone artifacts in the Arenosa Shelter collection. Artifacts made from these materials
make up almost 85 percent of the sample. Frequency data for taxa providing raw

Vertebrate Taxa

Figure 18: Frequency of Vertebrate Taxa Providing Raw Material Used in Arenosa
Shelter Bone Artifact Sample.
Bird bone was used for a total of 78 artifacts in the sample. All of these were
complete or fragmentary ornaments or their manufacturing byproducts. A single bead
fragment of hawk bone was excavated in Historic or Late Prehistoric contexts. Terminal
Late Archaic context in strata 3 – 9 provided 40 artifacts of bird bone, including three
items of manufacturing debitage, 35 items complete or fragmentary beads or preforms,
and five that were complete or fragmentary bone tubes or bead preforms. Earlier Late
Archaic context within strata 10 – 11 contained 25 artifacts of bird bone, including 16
complete or fragmentary beads or preforms and eight complete or fragmentary bone tubes
or preforms. A single item of bone bead manufacturing debitage of bird bone was found
in this context. In Middle Archaic context, 12 bird bone artifacts found were complete or
fragmentary bone beads or preforms. Most of the Middle Archaic bird bone artifacts
154

were manufactured from the long bones of medium to large hawk species, although long
bones from turkey, cormorant, and an unidentified bird taxon were also used in this
fashion.
Fish bones or scales were used to manufacture ten artifacts, all of them in the
implement class. A single ganoid scale from a large gar was apparently utilized as a
butchering tool, with resulting areas of use wear polish having characteristics of meat
contact. A large freshwater drum dorsal spine was also used in the processing of fresh
hides. A second dorsal spine, this one from an unidentified fish taxon, was also used in
the processing of silica-rich plant materials. All of the remaining implements made of
fish bone originated from blue or channel catfish pectoral spines used as either
perforators or spatulates in the processing of silica-rich plant materials or dry hides. With
the exception of the gar implement from Historic or Late Prehistoric contexts above
stratum 3, all remaining implements of fish bone were from Terminal Late Archaic
context within strata 5 and 9.
A single softshell turtle plastron fragment from Middle Archaic context in stratum
25 was modified by incising and subsequent use. At medium to high magnification, it
exhibits use wear consistent with wet hide.
Fifteen complete or fragmentary implements and ornaments made from deer
antler were recorded in the Arenosa Shelter sample. They were found primarily in earlier
Late Archaic context in strata 10 – 11 and Middle Archaic context in strata 12 – 25. One
tool fragment made of antler tine originated in Terminal Late Archaic context in stratum
9. It has a distal bevel that exhibits wear consistent with use on wood. The four forms
from the earlier Late Archaic context included flint-knapping tools for soft-hammer
percussion and pressure flaking, a bead fashioned from a tine segment, and tine segment
tools that appear to have been used in working hide or wood. Seven antler artifacts were
155

found in this context at Arenosa Shelter and included tools fashioned from both beam and
tine segments. In Middle Archaic context, seven artifacts of antler were also found, but
were all manufactured from tine segments. On the basis of use wear and manufacturing
characteristics, antler artifacts from Middle Archaic context apparently had a broader
variety of functions than the Late Archaic tools and included pressure flaking tools, and
hide and wood working tools. A single antler tube from Middle Archaic context was
found that had been manufactured by chopping from an antler tine prior to subsequent
surface scraping and grinding, but had no evidence of use wear.
All of the remaining 448 bone artifacts were manufactured of appendicular
skeletal material from small to large mammals. The smallest taxa were cottontail rabbits,
with 24 artifacts out of the mammalian group. Artiodactyls of pronghorn to mule deer
size formed the upper limit on this range. They provided raw materials for 292 bone
artifacts, the most numerous group in the sample. In between these two extremes, large
leporids and small to medium-sized carnivores supplied skeletal material used in
manufacture of 79 bone artifacts. Fifty-three of these were from jackrabbits and 59 were
from carnivores in the fox to bobcat, coyote, or dog size range. Twenty-one artifacts
made from the bone of an unidentified mammalian taxa made up the remainder of the
sample.

Figure 19 graphs the frequency distribution of taxa for bone artifacts

manufactured from mammalian bone.
Among the 448 artifacts created from mammal bone, there were considerably
more items representing the implement class and its manufacturing byproducts than those
from the ornament class. A total of 287 artifacts represented the former, while 163 of the
latter were found in the sample. The relative abundance of each class varied considerably
through time. The variation in relative abundance may be a result of differential survival
of the more robust members of the implement class in the rock shelter’s alluvial
156

sediments. Data comparing the frequency distribution between the ornament and
implement classes through time is presented in Figure 20.

Artifact Sample.

Beads, bone tubes, and their manufacturing byproducts were the only artifacts
identified within the ornament class. The author differentiated beads or bone tubes
manufactured from four mammalian taxa with body size classes that ranged between
cottontail rabbit and deer or pronghorns. Jackrabbits were also recognized as raw
materials used for ornaments, as were small to medium-sized carnivores. Frequency data
for mammal bone ornaments and implements are summarized diachronically in Tables
6.5 and 6.6.
A diachronic comparison of mammalian constituents of the two artifact classes is
presented in Figure 21, differentiated by body size.

Cottontail rabbits provided raw material for 26 beads during or after the Late
Archaic. They were most common in Late Archaic contexts in strata 10 – 11, with 14
items present. Eight cottontail beads were found in Terminal Late Archaic contexts in
strata 3 – 9, with only two in more recent sediments above that level. Two cottontailderived beads in the sample lacked provenience.
Among ornaments manufactured from medium-sized mammal skeletal materials,
jackrabbit-derived beads were relatively common in Late Archaic context, with 20 items
found in the sample from strata 10 – 11. The sample from Terminal Late Archaic context
in strata 3 – 9 provided 29 beads manufactured from jackrabbit. Only four jackrabbit
beads were present in Historic or Late Prehistoric context above stratum 3. Two
jackrabbit beads were found in Middle Archaic context and two beads lacked
provenience. Medium-sized mammalian carnivores utilized for ornamental artifacts were
identified on the basis of size and remnant anatomical features and were primarily foxes,
coyotes, or possibly domestic dog. The bobcat was also represented in this body size
class. Carnivores of this sized class were common in Terminal Late Archaic context.
The 43 complete or fragmentary beads or tubes, their preforms, and manufacturing
byproducts made up almost 26 percent of the total mammal bone-derived ornament
sample. They were virtually non-existent in Historic or Late Prehistoric context, with a
single specimen present. Eight ornaments of carnivore bone were present in Late Archaic
context within strata 10 – 11. Five beads manufactured from carnivore bone were present
in Middle Archaic context below stratum 11. Three carnivore bone ornaments or their
manufacturing byproducts lacked provenience.
Beads manufactured from appendicular skeletal material of artiodactyls were
identified, but made up less than six percent of the bone ornaments in the sample. Most
of them were present in Terminal Late Archaic context in strata 3 – 9 (11 items),
although a single antler bead was present in Late Archaic context in strata 10 – 11, and
two artiodactyl-derived ornaments or manufacturing byproducts were excavated from

162

within Middle Archaic context below stratum 11. A final, indeterminate mammal
designation was used for ornamental items that did not retain anatomical features that
facilitated further taxonomic identification. Ornaments of this designation composed
about six percent of the mammal bone ornament sample. They were most common in
Terminal Late Archaic context (six items), with fewer found in Late Archaic and Middle
Archaic contexts (two items each).
Only carnivores, indeterminate mammals, and artiodactyls were identified as
providing raw materials for the wide variety of artifacts within the implement class, with
artiodactyls providing raw materials for almost 96 percent of the 290 complete or
fragmentary implements made of bone in the sample. Carnivore-based implements were
present at less than one percent of the bone implements, with indeterminate mammals
making up the remainder.
The artiodactyl-derived implements were clearly the most abundant artifact group
in the site through much of the Archaic, based on the analyzed sample. An exception to
this predominance occurs in the Late Archaic context. During this period, ornaments
made from leporids of both size classes were slightly more abundant than artiodactyl
implements and ornaments.
Quantification, Composition, and Context of Specific Artifact Forms and
Manufacturing Byproducts in the Cultural Assemblage
The following discussion of quantification, composition, and context of specific
artifact forms and their manufacturing byproducts in the cultural assemblage is organized
by artifact class. It incorporates not only the taxonomic identification used in the
preceding section, but also analysis of metrical, technological, and use wear data for the
study specimens. The results of this stringent analysis are presented here in order to
define the context within the underlying technological behavior for these artifact forms as
completely as possible.

163

Ornament Forms and Manufacturing Byproducts
Forty bead forms were defined previously on the basis of observations of
taxonomic, metrical, technological, and use wear data from specimens in the Arenosa
Shelter bone artifact sample. Results presented earlier in this section noted that the
greatest frequency of antler and bone beads, bead preforms, bone tubes, and bone tube
preforms manufactured from mammalian and avian-derived constituents occurred in
Arenosa Shelter’s Terminal Late Archaic context. Slightly more than half of the
ornaments in the analyzed sample originated within strata 3 – 9. Significant numbers of
both constituents also occurred in earlier Late Archaic strata in the site, with about 29 per
cent of the sample coming from this context. While not numerous, about ten percent (23
items) of the ornaments manufactured from avian and mammalian carnivore species were
present in Middle Archaic contexts in Arenosa Shelter. Historic or Late Prehistoric
contexts above stratum 3 provided only about three per cent (eight items) of the sample’s
ornaments. Slightly more than one per cent (three items) of the analyzed ornament class
lacked provenience. Most ornament manufacturing debitage (87 per cent) was found in
the site’s Terminal Late Archaic context, although lesser amounts were also found in Late
Archaic and Middle Archaic strata or lacked provenience. Frequency, measurement data,
and cultural context for specific bead or bone tube forms and manufacturing byproducts
is found in Table 6.7.
Deer antler and decorated bead forms were present in the sample in small
numbers. A single tapered bead with an oval cross-section was made from a deer antler
and found in Late Archaic context in strata 10 – 11. It was manufactured by removing
the tip of a tine section and then the cancellous bone from the interior. Three forms of
decorated beads were also present in contexts dating to the Late Archaic or later.
The sample contained two beads on which multiple facets had been produced by
grinding. One of these was also from Late Archaic context in strata 10 – 11 and was
fashioned from a jackrabbit radius. This bead had 10 relatively indistinct facets and

164

exhibited a bright non-invasive polish from contact with silica-rich plant materials. The
second faceted bead was from Terminal Late Archaic context in strata 3 – 9 and was
manufactured from a hawk ulna. It exhibited several indistinct facets ground into its
surface and had a medium invasive polish and slight rounding of high points typical of
wear from contact with dry hide.
Two forms of beads with incised annular grooves were documented in the sample
from contexts more recent than the Late Archaic. Form 1 beads were found in both
Terminal Late Archaic and Historic – Late Prehistoric contexts. They were produced on
narrow (<10 mm) long bone segments of hawk or rabbit that were typically incised with
multiple annular grooves at intervals of 1 – 2 mm along their length. A single Form 1
incised bead fashioned from a jackrabbit tibia had only one annular groove incised at its
midpoint. Form 2 incised beads were made from slightly wider (10 – 20 mm) segments
of carnivore long bone that were similarly incised with at least one annular groove along
their length and were found only in Terminal Late Archaic contexts.

In all but one

instance, cutting of the annular groove decoration was the only manufacturing step in
addition to removing the blank from original long bone element. An exception to this
generality was one Form 2 bead that was ground and polished to further shape it once the
single annular groove had been incised. All incised beads exhibited use wear from
contact with either dry hide or hide with hair. A graphic representation of the diachronic
frequency of incised bead forms is shown in Figure 22.

Cultural Context

Undecorated tubular forms comprised the vast majority of all bone beads found in
the sample. As previously presented in Table 6.3, 36 individual forms of undecorated
bone bead were defined on the basis of size, source animal, and manufacturing process.
The following narrative will discuss variations in these forms and resulting artifacts
documented in the collection sample.
The first undecorated form (Form 1) was limited to two specimens from Terminal
Late Archaic context in strata 3 – 9. These specimens were manufactured from deer or
pronghorn phalange diaphyses and closely resemble the antler bead in being tapered
longitudinally. They were longitudinally scraped during the manufacturing process and
then ground or polished as a finishing method.
A group of 28 specimens in undecorated bone bead forms (2 – 6) may be
considered together because they are similar in length (<20 mm) and share avian sources
of raw material, primarily hawk taxa. The primary differences between the forms are
based on width and degree of further surface alteration following detachment of the bead
blank. Narrow beads (Forms 2 and 3) were less than 10 mm in width, while medium
beads (Forms 4 – 6) were between 10 and 20 mm in width. Surface alteration consisted
of minimal additional alteration (Forms 2 and 4), longitudinal scraping (Forms 3 and 5),
or scraping with subsequent grinding and/or polishing (Form 4).
These forms were all found in Terminal Late Archaic context in strata 3 – 9 (20
specimens, all forms), although specimens were also found in Late Archaic context in
strata 10 – 11 and in Middle Archaic context in strata below this level. Within the
Terminal Late Archaic context, more (13) specimens were minimally modified than those
subsequently undergoing scraping (five) or grinding/polishing (two) steps in
manufacturing.

167

There is a difference between the Late Archaic and Middle Archaic
representations of undecorated forms 2 - 6. Late Archaic specimens include only the two
narrow forms (2 and 3). Middle Archaic specimens include the narrow, minimally
modified form (Form 2) and a medium-width form that has been additionally modified
through scraping and grinding or polishing. Wear on most of the specimens is attributable
to contact with dry hide or hide with hair, although three specimens had wear consistent
with contact by silica-rich plant materials. A graphic representation of the diachronic
frequency of these undecorated bead forms is shown in Figure 23.

The next group of undecorated bone beads also contained 28 specimens and
consisted of seven forms (7 – 13). As noted in Table 6.3, these forms were medium (20 –
30 mm) or long (>30 mm) in length and narrow (<10 mm) or medium (10 – 20 mm) in
width. Similar to the previous discussion about undecorated Forms 2 – 6, beads in
undecorated Forms 7 – 13 varied in degree of further surface alteration following
detachment of the bead blank. In addition, undecorated Form 12 contained items
fashioned from more robustly built bird taxa that produced thicker wall thickness on the
resulting beads.
Recovery context for these seven forms was Middle Archaic to Terminal Late
Archaic, with almost half (13 specimens) originating in the latest of these. Medium
length – medium width forms were slightly more prevalent in Middle Archaic context
while the narrower or longer forms were more prevalent in later context. Forms with
minimal additional modification accounted for approximately 40 per cent of the beads in
these forms, with thicker, larger, minimally modified beads in Form 12 being more
common in the Middle Archaic context and notably absent from Terminal Archaic
context. Narrow to medium width beads in Forms 7 and 10 were more common in Late
Archaic or Terminal Late Archaic context. Approximately 29 per cent of the specimens
within this group of forms were additionally scraped (Form 8). Slightly more of them
were found in Terminal Archaic context than in earlier Late Archaic strata. About one
third of the beads in this group of forms (9, 11, and 13) were additionally ground and/or
polished during the manufacturing process. Again, slightly more of them were found in
Terminal Archaic context than in earlier strata. Wear on most of the specimens is
attributable to contact with dry hide or hide with hair, although six specimens had wear
consistent with contact by silica-rich plant materials. A graphic representation of the
diachronic frequency of these undecorated bead forms is shown in Figure 24.

Undecorated bone beads fashioned from mammalian taxa comprise the remainder
of the forms from the analyzed Arenosa Shelter sample and come from a wide range of
source taxa ranging in size from cottontail rabbit to deer or pronghorn-sized artiodactyls.
The initial group of undecorated bead forms is from the small end of this range and
includes Forms 14 – 18. The group consists of short (<20 mm), narrow width (<10 mm)
forms differentiated on the basis of wall thickness and degree of further surface alteration
following detachment of the bead blank. Thin-walled forms include those with minimal
surface alteration (Form 14), longitudinal scraping (Form 15), or scraping with
subsequent grinding and/or polishing (Form 16). Other forms with evidence of scraping
followed by subsequent grinding and/or polishing steps during manufacturing include a
medium thick-walled (Form 17) and thick-walled (Form 18) variant. While this group of
forms is represented in all contexts documented in this analysis, half of its 50 specimens
come from Terminal Late Archaic context in strata 3 – 9. Forty per cent of its specimens
also come from Late Archaic context in strata 10 – 11. The remainder is almost evenly
split between Historic – Late Prehistoric and Middle Archaic contexts.
Minimally modified, thin-walled specimens make up Form 14 that contributes 13
of the total of 50 specimens in this group. A majority of these items (seven specimens)
originated in Late Archaic strata. Although a large portion of the remainder (five
specimens) come from Terminal Late Archaic context, the Middle Archaic is represented
by a single specimen. All 13 of the specimens in this group are in the rabbit size range,
with all but one identified as either cottontail or jackrabbit. A single specimen from an
unidentified mammal taxon of similar size is also included. Slightly more than half of the
specimens in this form exhibit wear consistent with dry hide contact. Five of the Form
14 specimens have wear more consistent with contact by silica-rich plant materials. A
single specimen is burned, obscuring its wear signature.
172

Thin-walled specimens additionally modified by longitudinal scraping make up
Form 15. This form contributed 24 of the total of 50 specimens in this group of short
bead forms. Seventeen of these specimens were manufactured from jackrabbit long
bones. Of the remainder, two specimens were manufactured from an unidentified small
to medium-sized mammal taxon, four from cottontail rabbit, and one from a fox-sized
canid.
Most of the Form 15 specimens (17) originated within Terminal Late Archaic
context. They included two specimens from unidentified small to medium-sized
mammals, two from cottontail, and 13 from jackrabbit. Six specimens came from Late
Archaic strata and included the fox-sized canid, two from cottontail, and three from
jackrabbit. Only one Form 15 jackrabbit-derived bead specimens was found in Middle
Archaic context.
Use wear in the Form 15 specimens is primarily consistent with contact by silicarich plants (10 specimens), although wear associated with contact from dry hide (nine
specimens), sinew (one specimen), hide with hair (one specimen), and an unknown cause
(one specimen) were also documented. A single specimen is burned, obscuring its wear
signature.
Thin-walled specimens more extensively modified by grinding or polishing to
final shape made up Form 16. This form includes 11 of the 50 short, narrow bead
specimens. These were found in Late Archaic to Historic – Late Prehistoric context,
primarily in Late Archaic strata. Sixty-four per cent of Form 16 specimens were found in
Late Archaic context. The remainder of the specimens was evenly distributed between
Terminal Late Archaic and Historic – Late Prehistoric contexts.
While the overall range of source animal taxa was used for raw materials as with
Form 15, there was more variation within each context for Form 16. Within the Terminal
173

Late Archaic and Historic – Late Prehistoric contexts, single specimens of beads
fashioned from jackrabbit and cottontail, respectively, were found. The seven Late
Archaic beads included three fashioned from cottontail, two from jackrabbit, one from a
small fox-sized canid, and one from an unidentified small to medium-sized mammal
taxon.
The use wear for Form 16 specimens is consistent with that previously mentioned
for Form 15. Wear caused by contact with silica-rich plants was exhibited on four Late
Archaic specimens. Wear from dry hide was also documented for nine specimens,
including all from Terminal Late Archaic and Historic – Late Prehistoric context.
Forms 17 and 18 are each represented by single specimens. The primary
difference between these forms and the preceding Form 16 lies in the diaphysis thickness
of the original skeletal element from the source animal and the resulting wall thickness
for the manufactured bead. Form 17 was represented by a bead from Terminal Late
Archaic context that was manufactured from an indeterminate long bone of a large foxsized unidentified mammal taxon. Form 18 was represented by a bead from Middle
Archaic context that was manufactured from a long bone of a medium-sized carnivore,
probably a canid. Use wear for each was consistent with contact by hide. A graphic
representation of the diachronic frequency of undecorated beads in Forms 14 - 18 is
shown in Figure 25.

The second group of undecorated bead forms manufactured from mammal bone is
from the small to medium end of range of source animals present in the collection sample
and includes Forms 19 – 23. The group consists of short (<20 mm), medium width (10 –
20 mm) forms differentiated on the basis of wall thickness and degree of further surface
alteration following detachment of the bead blank. Thin-walled forms include those with
minimal surface alteration (Form 19) and longitudinal scraping (Form 20). Other forms
with evidence of scraping followed by subsequent grinding and/or polishing steps during
manufacturing include a medium thick-walled (Form 21) and thick-walled (Form 22)
variant. A final thick-walled variant is similar to Form 19, but manufactured from thickwalled skeletal elements of medium-sized mammals. While this group of forms is
represented in all contexts documented in this analysis, about 44 per cent of its 9
specimens come from Terminal Late Archaic context in strata 3 – 9. One-third of its
specimens also come from Late Archaic context in strata 10 – 11. The remainder is
evenly split between Historic – Late Prehistoric and Middle Archaic contexts.
A minimally modified, thin-walled specimen is the single representative of Form
19 that contributes one of the total of 9 specimens in this group of short, medium width
bead forms. It occurred in Terminal Late Archaic context and was manufactured from a
jackrabbit tibia. This specimen is burned to the point of calcination, obscuring its wear
signature.
A single thin-walled specimen that was further modified by longitudinal scraping
is the only representative of Form 20. It was also manufactured from a jackrabbit tibia
and occurred within Late Archaic context in strata 10 - 11. Use wear present on this
specimen was consistent with contact from silica-rich plant material.
Short, medium-width, medium thick-walled beads derived from bone blanks that
were further modified by longitudinal scraping constitute Form 21. This form is
176

represented by two beads from Terminal Late Archaic context and were both fashioned
from small to medium-sized carnivore long bone blanks. One of them has use wear
consistent with dry hide contact. The other’s use wear is consistent with contact from
silica-rich plant material.
Form 22 is the largest constituent of the group of short, medium-width
undecorated beads and, in addition to longitudinal scraping, exhibits final shaping or
finishing by grinding or polishing. Four of its medium thick-walled beads contribute 44
per cent of this group of beads. Two of the specimens are from Terminal Late Archaic
context in strata 3 – 9, a single specimen is from more recent Historic – Late Prehistoric
context, and the final specimen is from Middle Archaic context below stratum 11. All
were fashioned from mammals in the small to medium-sized range, with at least two
being identifiable as carnivores. The other two specimens were identifiable only as
originating with mammals in the medium-sized body range. Invasive polish typical of
contact with dry hide, wet hide, or hide with hair is found on all four of the specimens in
this form.
Short, medium-width beads from thick-walled blanks that were had minimal
further modification make up Form 23, the final member of this group of beads. Two
specimens were found in Late Archaic context in strata 10 – 11. Both were made from
medium to large carnivore long bones. One of these specimens is too heavily weathered
for identification of any of its original use wear characteristics. The other specimen
exhibits use wear typical of contact with dry hide.

The third group of undecorated bead forms manufactured from mammal bone is
from derived from a wide range for source animals present in the analyzed sample. This
group includes Forms 24 – 31. The group consists of medium length (20 – 30 mm) forms
differentiated on the basis of wall thickness and degree of further surface alteration
following detachment of the bead blank. Thin-walled forms include narrow width (<10
mm) beads with minimal surface alteration (Form 24), longitudinal scraping (Form 25),
and scraping followed by subsequent grinding and/or polishing steps during
manufacturing (Form 26). Other narrow width forms with evidence of scraping followed
by subsequent grinding and/or polishing steps during manufacturing include a medium
thick-walled (Form 27) and a thick-walled (Form 28) variant. Medium width (10 – 20
mm) forms are similar and include a medium thick-walled form with longitudinal
scraping (Form 29), a medium thick-walled form with final grinding and/or polishing
evidence (Form 30), and a final thick-walled variant with minimal additional surface
modification (Form 31). While this group of forms is represented in all contexts
documented in this analysis except the Historic – Late Prehistoric, about 41 per cent of its
29 specimens come from Late Archaic context in strata 10 – 11. Thirty-eight per cent of
its specimens are from Terminal Late Archaic context in strata 3 – 9. The final 21 per
cent of its specimens comes from Middle Archaic context below stratum 11.
Minimally modified, thin-walled specimens make up Form 24 that contributes 25
per cent of the specimens in this group. A majority of these items (five specimens)
originated in Late Archaic strata. The Terminal Late Archaic and Middle Archaic
contexts are each represented by a single specimen. All of the specimens in this form are
in the rabbit size range, with all identified as either cottontail or jackrabbit. While
jackrabbits were the source taxon for slightly more than half of the beads in this form,
most of the Late Archaic Form 24 beads were manufactured from cottontail tibiae.
179

Slightly more than half of the specimens in this form exhibit wear consistent with dry
hide contact. Two of the Form 24 specimens have wear more consistent with contact by
silica-rich plant materials.
Thin-walled specimens additionally modified by longitudinal scraping make up
Form 25. This form also contributed 25 per cent of the total of 28 specimens in this
group of medium length bead forms. All except one of the specimens from this form
were manufactured from jackrabbit long bones.

The remaining specimen was

manufactured from a cottontail rabbit.
Similar to Form 24, most (5) of the Form 25 specimens originated within Late
Archaic context. They included the cottontail specimen and four fashioned from
jackrabbit. Two jackrabbit specimens came from Terminal Late Archaic strata. Except
for one Late Archaic specimen, use wear in the Form 25 specimens is primarily
consistent with contact by contact from dry hide. The single Late Archaic exception
exhibited use wear typical of silica-rich plants.
A more narrow range of taxa was used for raw materials for Form 26, a thinwalled medium length narrow bead form found exclusively in the Middle Archaic context
below stratum 11. Except for the longer length, this form is very similar to Form 16 in
manufacturing techniques represented, with the surface and ends being ground or
polished as a final shaping step. Two specimens of beads fashioned from fox-sized
canids were found, as was a single specimen from a fox or jackrabbit sized unidentified
medium mammal taxon. Use wear for Form 26 specimens is consistent with that
previously mentioned for Form 25. Both canid specimens have wear caused by contact
with silica-rich plants. Wear from dry hide was documented for the specimen of
unidentified mammal.

180

An unidentified medium-sized carnivore taxon was used for raw materials for
Form 28, a thick-walled medium length narrow bead form found in the Late Archaic
context in strata 10 – 11. Except for the greater wall thickness, this form is very similar to
Forms 26 and 27 in manufacturing techniques, as the ends are ground or polished as a
final shaping step. Use wear for the Form 28 specimen is consistent with wear caused by
contact with wet hide.
Medium thick-walled specimens modified by longitudinal scraping make up Form
29, a form very similar to Form 25, but differing in the greater wall thickness and width.
A single specimen of Form 29 bead originated within Terminal Late Archaic context and
was manufactured from coyote or domestic dog. Use wear in the Form 29 specimen is
consistent with contact by contact from dry hide.
An unidentified medium-sized carnivore taxon and large fox-sized canid were
used for raw materials for Form 30, a medium thick-walled medium length narrow bead
form found in the Terminal Late Archaic context in strata 3 – 9. An unidentified
medium-sized carnivore taxon was also used for Form 30 bead raw materials in Middle
Archaic context below stratum 11. Except for the greater width, this form is very similar
to Form 27 in manufacturing techniques, as the ends are ground or polished as a final
shaping step. Use wear for the Form 30 specimen is consistent with wear caused by
contact with dry hide.
The two specimens of Form 31 beads were manufactured from coyote or domestic
dog and a deer or pronghorn-sized artiodactyl. This thick-walled form was documented
in Terminal Late Archaic context in the Arenosa Shelter sample. Similar to Form 24,
these specimens have minimal additional surface modification following detachment of
the bead blank. Use wear for the artiodactyl-derived specimen was consistent with

181

contact from silica-rich plant materials. The other specimen did not have documented
use wear.
A graphic representation of the diachronic frequency of undecorated beads in
Forms 24 - 31 is shown in Figure 27.

from derived from the medium to large range for source animals present in the analyzed
sample. This group includes Forms 32 – 36. The group consists of long (>30 mm) forms
differentiated on the basis of wall thickness and degree of further surface alteration
following detachment of the bead blank. The single thin-walled form includes narrow
width (<10 mm) beads with minimal surface alteration (Form 32). Another long bead
form (Form 35) exhibiting minimal surface alteration is of medium width and fashioned
from thick-walled mammal blanks. A medium width form (10 – 20 mm) from a mediumthick walled mammal blank further modified by longitudinal scraping (Form 33) is
among the long beads in this group. Other medium width forms with evidence of
longitudinal scraping followed by subsequent grinding and/or polishing steps during
manufacturing include a medium thick-walled (Form 34) and a thick-walled (Form 36)
variant. While this group of forms is represented in all contexts documented in this
analysis except the Historic – Late Prehistoric and Middle Archaic contexts, about 66 per
cent of its 9 specimens come from Terminal Late Archaic context in strata 3 – 9. A
single specimen is from Late Archaic context in strata 10 – 11. The final 22 per cent of
its specimens lack provenience.
The minimally modified, thin-walled long narrow Form 32 bead contributes a
single specimen in this group. It is the single long bead that originated in Late Archaic
strata. It was identified as being manufactured from a jackrabbit tibia. This specimen
exhibits wear consistent with dry hide contact.
Form 33, a long, medium-width bead exhibiting longitudinal scraping, was
represented by two specimens. Both specimens were manufactured from domestic dog or
coyote. One specimen was found in Terminal Late Archaic context in stratum 3 – 9. The
other specimen lacked provenience data. The Terminal Late Archaic specimen was
184

burned, obscuring its wear signature, while the other had use wear typical of contact with
dry hide.
Three specimens of Form 34 long, medium-width beads were manufactured from
medium thick-walled mammal bone blanks obtained from gray fox, domestic dog or
coyote, and a large fox-sized canid. Specimens were found primarily in Terminal Late
Archaic context in stratum 3 – 9. Use wear for each was consistent with dry hide.
Long, medium width beads (Form 35) were fashioned form thick-walled elements
and had minimal additional surface modification. The single specimen was manufactured
from a deer or pronghorn-sized artiodactyl rib. The bright invasive polish with limited
rounding of the ends was consistent with contact from silica-rich plant materials.
The final bead form in this group (Form 36) was a long, medium-width tubular
form manufactured from thick-walled elements and, similar to Form 34, has evidence of
longitudinal scraping followed by subsequent grinding and/or polishing steps during
manufacturing. The single specimen of Form 36 in the sample was made from a fox or
raccoon-sized carnivore. It is slightly burned and has highly polished ends. The use wear
is bright and invasive, typical of contact from dry hide.
A graphic representation of the diachronic frequency of undecorated beads in
Forms 32 - 36 is shown in Figure 28.

Eight preforms for bead forms or their manufacturing failures were found in the
full range of cultural contexts represented in the Arenosa Shelter sample. Preforms
documented in the collection are typically long, in excess of 30 mm, with several
representing significant portions of the diaphyses from long bones that were used as raw
materials.
A single preform and a preform manufacturing failure for Form 1 undecorated
beads were found in Terminal Late Archaic context in strata 3 – 9. Both were
manufactured from artiodactyl phalanges that had been longitudinally scraped. Limited
grinding was also present on the articular portions present in the specimens.
A single preform for an undecorated Form 3 bead was found in Middle Archaic
context below stratum 11. It was manufactured from a large hawk proximal tibiotarsus
and exhibits longitudinal scraping on its distal half. A second annular groove is incised
into the diaphysis 6.5 mm proximal to the terminal groove and snap fracture, possibly
presaging detachment of the next Form 3 bead.
Two undecorated Form 13 bead preforms manufactured from an unidentified
large bird taxon were documented in the sample, one in Late Archaic context and the
other in Middle Archaic context. The Late Archaic specimen was of indeterminate long
bone that had been scraped prior to removal of the blank by grooving and snapping. The
Middle Archaic specimen was identifiable as a medial tibiotarsus diaphysis that had been
similarly prepared.
A bead preform was recovered from Late Archaic context in strata 10 – 11 and
represented an undecorated Form 25 bead being manufactured from a jackrabbit tibia
diaphysis. This preform for a medium-length, narrow bead exhibited longitudinal
scraping to smooth and shape its cross-section and the remnants of a single annular
groove incised 20 mm from the proximal end.
187

A specimen from a generalized Late Archaic – Middle Archaic context in strata 9
– 19 represents a preform for a Form 29 or Form 30 undecorated bead. It was the
preform for a medium length bead being manufactured from a dog or coyote humerus
diaphysis
The final bead preform recognized in the Arenosa Shelter sample was from
Terminal Late Archaic context and represents the manufacturing process for a Form 32
undecorated bead. This long preform was being fashioned from a juvenile carnivore
radius and exhibits a terminal groove and snap fracture that removed the proximal
epiphysis.
Thirty-one items of bone bead debitage were recognized during analysis of the
Arenosa Shelter bone artifact sample. Almost two-thirds of these were identified as the
remains of carnivores. Artiodactyls and birds make up almost all of the remainder, with a
single specimen of unidentified mammal also being recognized. Four of the bead
specimens did not originate within Terminal Late Archaic context in strata 3 – 9. Late
Archaic specimens consist of a large hawk distal radius and a juvenile dog or coyote
distal humerus. This canid specimen included the distal epiphysis and had been
longitudinally scraped on the surface of the diaphysis. More than four sets of deep,
transverse cutmarks were adjacent to the terminal groove and snap fracture on the canid
humerus.
A Middle Archaic artiodactyl proximal phalange specimen of bead debitage was
removed from a bead blank by grooving and snapping. This final non-Terminal Late
Archaic bead debitage specimen lacked provenience. It was manufactured from a
juvenile medium carnivore distal humerus diaphysis in the bobcat, coyote, or domestic
dog size range. This specimen exhibited longitudinal scraping proximal to the terminal

188

groove and snap fracture. A medium, non-invasive polish consistent with contact from
silica-rich plants was also present on this specimen.
The remaining 27 bone bead debitage specimens were from Terminal Late
Archaic context and represented a variety of bird, carnivore, artiodactyl, or unidentified
mammal taxa. Three Terminal Late Archaic bead debitage specimens were recognizable
as medium to large hawk. One was smaller than the others at 16.5 mm in length and was
the distal epiphysis of a medium – large hawk right humerus. The element had been
longitudinally scraped prior to initiation of the terminal groove and snap fracture. The
other two hawk debitage specimens were longer, 30 and 43 mm respectively, and
represented an ulna distal diaphysis and tibiotarsus diaphysis that included the distal
epiphysis. The ulna specimen was from a large hawk, had been longitudinally scraped,
and exhibited 4 deep transverse cutmarks immediately adjacent to the terminal fracture.
The tibiotarsus specimen had longitudinal scraping on its lateral aspect distally, with
remnants of two groove and snap fractures on its proximal end.
A fourth Terminal Late Archaic bead debitage fragment from a bird was
attributable to Phalacrocorax sp., a cormorant. This tibiotarsus diaphysis included the
distal epiphysis and exhibited longitudinal scraping.
One Terminal Late Archaic specimen of bead debitage was recognizable as
originating with a medium to large mammal, but could not be identified further. This rib
diaphysis fragment had at least five grooves incised at 3 mm intervals proximal to the
terminal groove and snap fracture. It exhibited a bright, non-invasive polish on high
points on its dorsal aspect, with no polish ventrally. At the higher magnification (30 –
70x) used in the current study, this polish included sharp-edged transverse striations
consistent with contact from silica-rich plant.

189

Three Terminal Late Archaic specimens are artiodactyl phalanges, one from a
juvenile individual. Two of these specimens included the proximal epiphysis that had
been removed from the bead blank by grooving and snapping. The other was a distal
epiphysis that had been similarly removed following longitudinal scraping of the element.
A fourth artiodactyl proximal phalange epiphysis, more identifiable and attributable to
deer, included a grinding modification on the terminal fracture and had areas of slightly
non-invasive wear consistent with contact by silica-rich plant materials.
The remaining 18 Terminal Late Archaic bead debitage specimens were
recognizable as remains of carnivore taxa. A single radius distal epiphysis specimen was
identifiable only to Carnivora due to its poor preservation and had been removed from the
blank by a groove and snap fracture. Two specimens of bead debitage attributable to
bobcat were identified due to included epiphyses, one from a distal femur, and the other
from a distal humerus. The femur specimen was poorly preserved, but exhibited several
sets of parallel grooves adjacent to the terminal groove and snap fracture. The humerus
specimen exhibited longitudinal scraping on its surface and limited polish on high points.
It also had 20 – 25 sets of deep cutmarks adjacent to the annular groove and snap fracture
that formed the terminal fracture.
Three of these carnivore Terminal Late Archaic debitage specimens were
attributable to the family Canidae, but could not be further identified. One was a distal
humerus diaphysis from a juvenile individual that had been longitudinally scraped prior
to removal of the epiphyses. It had multiple deep transverse cutmarks adjacent to the
terminal fracture. A second juvenile canid specimen was from a medium dog or coyote
sized proximal ulna that included the epiphysis. It exhibited longitudinal scraping on the
surface of its diaphysis. The last canid specimen was from a proximal femur, including

190

the epiphysis. It had five or more deep transverse cutmarks or partial grooves adjacent to
the terminal groove and snap fracture, but no further modification.
All other Terminal Late Archaic canid bead debitage fragments were attributable
to the genera Canis, Vulpes, or Urocyon. Eight were recognizable as long bones from
either coyote or a similarly sized domestic dog. Five of these specimens were from
tibiae, with four including the epiphyses. Four of these dog or coyote specimens had
been longitudinally scraped prior to detachment of the bead blank. The fifth was from a
juvenile individual and was extremely pitted. It had deep transverse cutmarks adjacent to
the terminal groove and snap fracture.
One specimen was identified as a subadult large fox, dog, or coyote distal tibia
that included a partially fused epiphyseal plate and epiphysis. The diaphysis was
longitudinally scraped and exhibited five or more sets of transverse deep cutmarks
adjacent to the terminal fracture.
The last three Terminal Late Archaic canid bead debitage fragments were
attributable to the fox genera. Two specimens of fox distal tibia diaphyses were
identified as Vulpes sp. One Vulpes specimen had been longitudinally scraped and had
two sets of partial annular grooves and deep transverse cutmarks adjacent to the terminal
fracture. The other Vulpes specimen had been minimally modified. The last fox
specimen was a proximal humerus with epiphysis that was attributable to either gray fox
or a similarly sized Vulpes sp. It had longitudinal scraping, but little additional surface
modification.

Bone tubes and preforms will be considered separately from bead debitage within
the ornament class because they differ in manufacturing and use wear characteristics and
may have a different function. Bone tubes were found in both Late Archaic and Terminal
Late Archaic contexts. Documented in the sample were 37 examples of bone tubes or
bone tube preforms manufactured from an array of bird and mammal taxa.
Within the 16 Late Archaic specimens, nine are avian. Three of these are
attributable to hawk or falcon-like birds and include wing elements from small to large
hawks. These hawk elements have been longitudinally scraped or ground and have
polish on high points or ends that is consistent with contact from dry hide or silica-rich
plants. The six remaining Late Archaic specimens of avian bone tubes are identified only
to Aves. One is from a small hawk-sized radius diaphysis that had been longitudinally
scraped. It exhibited invasive polish consistent with dry hide contact on the ends only.
Five of them are from large bird long bones, although the exact element could not be
identified. Two of these were burned and did not exhibit obvious wear. The other three
Late Archaic large bird bone tubes were longitudinally scraped, but without obvious
wear.
A single Late Archaic bone tube specimen was identifiable only as a juvenile
medium-sized mammal ulna diaphysis. It had been treated in a similar fashion to the
previously mentioned large bird tubes that were only scraped but not obviously worn. A
single Late Archaic bone tube fashioned from a cottontail tibia diaphysis was
longitudinally scraped and then ground on one end, following detachment of the bone
tube from the debitage. It exhibited very limited medium invasive polish with slight end
rounding consistent with silica-rich plant material wear.
The other five Late Archaic bone tubes or bone tube fragments were
manufactured from jackrabbit long bone diaphyses that included two radii, two tibiae,
193

and a phalange. Four of these specimens exhibited wear from either silica-rich plants or
dry hide. Wear from siliceous stone was also evident on one of the tibiae. The phalange
and one of the radii had also been longitudinally scraped.
The 19 complete or fragmentary bone tubes from Terminal Late Archaic in the
sample had a slightly broader range of source taxa that added an artiodactyl and at least
three carnivores to the range. Five of these specimens were avian, all from hawk long
bone elements. A single bone tube fashioned from a proximal tibiotarsus diaphysis that
was identified as originating from a very large hawk or eagle-sized bird in the family
Accipitridae exhibited longitudinal scraping and had medium non-invasive polish on high
points consistent with silica-rich plant material wear. Four other specimens were
identifiable as from long bones of hawks in the genus Buteo that had minimal surface
modification. Two were fashioned from wing bones, an ulna and radius, respectively.
They exhibited non-invasive polish on high points consistent with contract from silicarich plants. A third was from a tibiotarsus and retained a remnant of the fibular crest.
The other specimen was not identifiable to a specific element.
The remaining 13 specimens of Terminal Late Archaic context bone tubes or their
fragments were manufactured from mammal long bones. A single artiodactyl tube
fragment was documented in the sample that had been scraped and exhibited bright,
invasive polish from dry hide contact. All other Terminal Late Archaic context complete
or fragmentary bone tubes were manufactured from either carnivore or lagomorph long
bone diaphyses.
The six carnivore specimens included those fashioned from a fox in the genus
Vulpes, domestic dog or coyote, and unidentified taxa in Carnivora. The domestic dog or
coyote specimen was from a radius with minimal surface modification. The fox
specimen was identified as an ulna diaphysis fragment that had been longitudinally
194

scraped, but with no additional smoothing. It exhibited slight end rounding and medium
non-invasive polish consistent with silica-rich plant material wear. Remaining carnivore
bone tubes include two from tibiae, a radius, and a humerus. One of the tibia specimens
is weathered, but retains evidence of surface modification by longitudinal scraping and
has medium invasive polish and micro-pitting consistent with wear from dry hide. The
remaining tibia specimen had minimal surface modification, but did evidence end
rounding and slight polish on the terminal fractures. Two of the Terminal Late Archaic
carnivore-derived bone tube specimens are from juvenile individuals and include tubes
made from radius and humerus diaphyses.

The humerus specimen had been

longitudinally scraped. The radius specimen had no technologically related surface
modification. Neither of theses specimens had documented wear.
The seven Terminal Late Archaic bone tubes that were manufactured from
lagomorphs included one from cottontail and six from jackrabbits. All of the jackrabbit
specimens were fashioned from tibia diaphyses, while the cottontail specimen was
manufactured from a radius diaphysis. The cottontail bone tube specimen was not
modified beyond grooving and snapping that formed its terminal fractures, but did have
bright invasive polish with slight end rounding that were consistent with dry hide wear.
The jackrabbit-derived bone tube fragments included one manufactured from a juvenile
individual.

Modifications to all but one of these jackrabbit specimens included

longitudinal scraping. One of these specimens was also ground. Two of these adult
specimens had wear present; one consistent with dry hide and the other consistent with
silica-rich plants.
Two additional Terminal Late Archaic specimens were considered to be preforms
for bone tubes. Both of these were from canid taxa. One was identified only to family
and was a weathered distal diaphysis from a juvenile fox-sized canid tibia. The only
195

modification to this specimen was an annular groove incised 15 mm from the distal
terminal groove and snap fracture. The other specimen was from a domestic dog or
coyote humerus that had been longitudinally scraped.
A graphic representation of the diachronic frequency of bone tubes and their
preforms in is shown in Figure 30.

Implement Forms and Manufacturing Byproducts
Six forms of antler implements and 25 forms of bone implements were identified
from specimens in the bone artifact sample from Arenosa Shelter on the basis of
observations of taxonomic, metrical, technological, and use wear data. These included a
further refinement of antler implement definition that provided several additional forms
of antler tine tool that were based on tip morphology and use wear data. Mirroring the
situation with ornaments from the sample, frequency data indicate that bone and antler
implements were most numerous in the site’s Terminal Late Archaic cultural context.
Almost 60 per cent (184 items) of the implements in the analyzed sample originated from
within strata 3 – 9. In contrast to the ornaments, the second highest frequency of
implements in the analyzed sample was from Middle Archaic context, with about 18 per
cent (55 items) of its contents coming from the zone between stratum 12 and stratum 30.
Late Archaic context in strata 10 and 11 accounted from about one-third less total
artifacts, with about 12.5 per cent (42 items) of the total implements in the analyzed
sample. Historic and Late Prehistoric implements from above stratum 3 provided only
about six per cent (21 items) from the sample. Slightly more than four per cent (14
items) lacked provenience in the analyzed sample. Almost 64 per cent (7 items) of the
manufacturing or refitting debitage was found in Terminal Late Archaic context, with
lesser amounts being found in Late Archaic or Middle Archaic context or lacking
provenience completely. Frequency and cultural context for specific implement forms
and manufacturing byproducts are found in Table 6.8.
Thirteen separate complete or separate deer antler implements were identified in
the Arenosa Shelter bone implement sample from Terminal Late Archaic to Middle
Archaic contexts. These included six separate defined forms that were based on observed
198

morphology, anatomical location of raw material, manufacturing characteristics, and use
wear, as previously defined in Tables 6.1 and 6.2.
Most of these artifacts (7) were from Middle Archaic context beneath stratum 11
and included a wide variety of antler tine tool forms (5) used for functions that were
interpreted as varying from woodworking to flint-knapping based on crushing, striations,
and use wear present. Antler tine tools interpreted as chisels were found in all three
Archaic contexts where antler tools were present. These tools were defined on the basis
of bevels ground into one end, with distinctive wood polish that included visible osteons
present on the bevel. Scraping was also used to shape the Middle Archaic and Late
Archaic specimens.
Two additional antler tine tools with beveled tips were recovered from Middle
Archaic contexts. Both were heavily weathered or carnivore-ravaged, but retained
sufficient surface characteristics for use wear and manufacturing characteristics to be
deduced. The tip bevel in at least one case was done by grinding. The tools had a 6 to 9
mm wide profile with an oval to round cross section. The tine body was longitudinally
scraped to shape on one of these. A bright non-invasive polish of unknown source was
also found on one specimen.
Two antler tine fragments from Middle Archaic context were identified as
pressure flakers on the basis of broad or blunt, rounded tip profile characteristics, tip
battering, tear-out of tip or lateral edges, or concentrations of striations at the tip and
adjacent areas along the lateral edges. The striations have wear characteristics produced
by siliceous stone.
Two other antler tine tools with rounded tips were found, one each in Late
Archaic and Middle Archaic contexts. The tips of each were ground to a gently rounded
profile with a round cross section. The Late Archaic specimen had use wear from dry
199

hide that is recognized due to the presence of weathering damage. Although the Middle
Archaic specimen was burned, it had evidence remaining of wear from hide with hair.
Another poorly preserved antler tine tool fragment from Middle Archaic context
was heavily weathered and carnivore ravaged. It had no remaining use wear polish, but
did show manufacturing evidence of longitudinal scraping.
Only the tool form fashioned from antler beams was not included in Middle
Archaic context. These tools were interpreted as antler billets used in soft hammer
percussion flaking. Three of these tools were identified from Late Archaic contexts and
included two that were relatively complete and one identifiable fragment. The two
almost complete specimens were at least 125 mm in length and 20 to 32 mm in lateral
direction, with broadly rounded ends that were ground to shape. The end of one of the
billets has a slightly invasive polish similar to that produced by dry hide. Longitudinal
scraping was used to further shape the billet prior to use. The ends of the two almost
complete specimens have deep cutmarks on the end itself or longitudinal cutmarks,
grooves or striations adjacent to the ends. The grooves and striations have characteristics
produced by siliceous stone.
The remainder of the implements was fashioned from mammal, turtle, or fish
bone or, in one case, a ganoid scale from a large fish. For narrative purposes, tools that
underwent an informal modification process will be considered before those that
underwent a more formal manufacturing process. Tools that underwent a less formal
manufacturing process are termed informal tools for this study. These include utilized
bone fragments and expedient tools that underwent minimal additional modification
before use (Johnson 1987:108).
The informal tools show evidence of minimal modification of mammalian skeletal
elements or, in one case, a utilized fish scale. Raw material for the mammal bone-based
200

tools was primarily helically fractured long bone elements that were byproducts of
butchering, marrow extraction, or bone grease production. Nine informal tools were
identified in the Arenosa Shelter bone artifact sample analysis, found in all four cultural
contexts. Six of these tools were from Terminal Late Archaic context in strata 3 – 9. A
single utilized scale from a large Lepisosteus sp. (gar) fish was found in Historic – Late
Prehistoric context above stratum 3. Single informal tools from Late Archaic and Middle
Archaic contexts were also found. Except for the gar scale and a single modified
carnivore ulna, all of these tools were fashioned from fragments of artiodactyl elements.
In addition to the utilized gar scale from Historic – Late Prehistoric context, four
of the six Terminal Late Archaic specimens were identified as butchering tools. Helically
fractured fragments of two tibiae, one humerus, and an indeterminate long bone were
utilized in butchering and show wear from use in cutting meat. Three of these specimens
were modified by percussion flaking to remove bone material along a lateral or distal
cutting edge that shows subsequent use wear. One of the tibia specimens was scraped to
shape prior to having its cutting edge reshaped by percussion flaking. The other tibia
specimen was utilized with no resharpening.
An additional artiodactyl-derived informal tool from Late Archaic context was
identified as a cutting tool fashioned from a helically fractured humerus fragment that
was subsequently grooved medially and distally. One lateral edge shows two small areas
of unifacial hard hammer percussion flaking near its end that have use wear from what
was probably short-term cutting of meat.
The remaining informal tools fall into two morphological forms. One of these
forms was apparently used in hide working. A single Terminal Late Archaic specimen
fashioned from an artiodactyl radius diaphysis was derived from byproducts of the
manufacturing process for formal tools and shows evidence of blank removal by
201

grooving and snapping, with removal of the periosteum layer by longitudinal scraping.
Middle portions of the lateral edges were further shaped by hard hammer percussion to
produce a scalloped edge profile. The lateral edge ends are slightly rounded and
polished, as are the high points of the scalloped edges. Use wear associated with this
implement fits the pattern of contact with hides containing hair.
The remaining two informal tool specimens have been modified into
morphological forms that have projecting narrow working areas with an oval cross
section. For the purposes of this analysis, these tools are termed informal bone tool
spatulates. A Terminal Late Archaic specimen fashioned from a helically fractured
carnivore ulna has utilization wear on its distal fracture. The periosteum was scraped off
and the distal fracture and much of the elements ventral aspect have a use wear polish
consistent with contact by hides with attached hair. The single informal tool of this type
from Middle Archaic context was fashioned from a weathered, helically fractured
artiodactyl tibia that was scraped and ground to its final shape. The working area on this
specimen has use wear consistent with contact by silica-rich plants.
Implements undergoing more extensive and formalized manufacturing processes
and the byproducts of those processes will now be considered. Approximately 300
individual items in the analyzed Arenosa Shelter bone artifact sample represented
complete or fragmentary formal tools and their manufacturing byproducts. Twenty-four
separate artifact forms were defined during the analysis, along with several additional
preforms, manufacturing debitage, and refitting debitage.
Long tool forms were the most frequent and their morphology differed most
importantly in the width of the tip section. Similar to the expedient tools, most of the
formalized long tool forms were fashioned from artiodactyl long bones. Many of these
were manufactured from the metapodia of the lower legs, either the metacarpal or
202

metatarsal. Some tool forms used metacarpals almost exclusively as their raw material,
among them the defined awl/bodkin, bodkin, and bodkin/perforator forms. Other forms
used the metatarsals in many instances where the raw material source could be
anatomically identified to a reliable degree, including for many spatulates. Some specific
tool forms used the robust pectoral or dorsal spines of fish species, such as the blue
catfish pectoral spines that formed the basis of the catfish spine spatulate and perforator
forms.

The exact manufacturing process and wear resulting from use varied

considerably within many of these formalized tool forms.
Description of the formalized tool forms will begin with the metacarpal-derived
forms. The 14 specimens of the awl/bodkin form were found primarily in Terminal Late
Archaic context in strata 3 – 9, although specimens also occurred in earlier Late Archaic
and Middle Archaic contexts. Eleven fragmentary Terminal Late Archaic awl/bodkins
were fashioned from deer or unspecified artiodactyl long bone fragments, that included
definite metacarpal, generalized metapodial, and indeterminate long bone fragments. A
single Late Archaic awl/bodkin was manufactured from a deer metacarpal. The two
Middle Archaic specimens were also manufactured from deer metacarpal bones.
Evidence drawn from fragmentary awl/bodkins that included all portions of the
tool form indicates that the blank for this form was fashioned from the distal epiphysis
and diaphysis of artiodactyl metacarpal bones by several methods. These included
chopping, grooving and snapping, or an undetermined method used to remove
unnecessary portions of the skeletal element from the blank. The blank was then further
shaped by longitudinal scraping and/or grinding to refine the shape of the lateral edges
and tip section. The tip section is typically oval in cross section, gently to sharply
tapered, and sharp to rounded in end profile. The tip may exhibit a use-induced bevel or
tear-out. Notably, on specimens that include the proximal portion of the tool, the lateral
203

condyles have been extensively ground, exposing underlying cancellous bone. Use wear
signatures for this form include wear from dry hide and silica-rich plants during the
Middle Archaic and silica-rich plants during the Late Archaic. During the Terminal Late
Archaic, use wear signatures included one instance of hide with attached hair, four of
wood contact, and six instances of silica-rich plant contact.
Two Late Archaic specimens of awl/perforators were manufactured from distal
diaphyses of medium to large mammal ulnas that had been grooved and snapped
longitudinally and/or transversely to prepare the tool blank and then longitudinally
scraped to final shape. These long narrow tools were had gently tapering tips with a
round cross section, but the exact tip profile is unknown due to the absence of distal tips
on both specimens. Use wear for both was consistent with dry hide contact.
Two small tools from Terminal Late Archaic and Middle context were interpreted
as beamer/fleshers used in the removal of meat residue from hides. Similar to the
expedient hide-working tool, these tools had wear signatures that were consistent with
meat use. The Terminal Late Archaic form was closer to the expedient form in its
manufacturing process and was based on a helically fractured artiodactyl indeterminate
long bone fragment. A portion of this specimen was further modified by dynamic flaking
to remove multiple bifacial flakes in forming a 9 mm wide beveled tip that showed use
wear. The fragmentary Middle Archaic specimen was manufactured by grooving and
snapping to remove the ventral margin of an artiodactyl scapula and then grinding it to a
final shape. The lateral edge and distal tip had use wear from meat contact, a signature
that is consistent with use in hide working to remove flesh remnants from the hide.
Another Terminal Late Archaic specimen was identified as the fragment of a
flesher and was fashioned from the distal portion of an artiodactyl rib. This medio-distal
tool has a 10 mm wide beveled tip section that was prepared by removal of multiple
204

unifacial flakes across a transverse fracture. The polish present on the distal end of the
tool indicates use wear from meat contact, a signature that is consistent with use in hide
working.

It should be noted that this specimen and the Terminal Late Archaic

beamer/flesher are technologically more formalized than the similar expedient tools
previously described and may represent intermediate positions in a continuum between
expedient and more formalized tool manufacturing behavior exercised by the inhabitants
of the Lower Pecos during this period.
Ten bodkin fragments were identified in the Arenosa Shelter bone artifact
analysis.

Each of these short, relatively broad tools was manufactured from distal

artiodactyl metacarpal bones. Four of the specimens included the distal epiphysis. Three
of the specimens were recognizable as deer. Similar in many respects to the awl/bodkin,
the bodkin blank was prepared by chopping, grooving and snapping, or an undetermined
method used to remove unnecessary portions of the skeletal element from the blank.
Grinding of the lateral condyles into underlying cancellous bone was also employed in
several instances to shape the proximal portion of the bodkin form. The distal end and
lateral edges of the tools were further modified by longitudinal scraping and/or grinding
to refine their shape. Tip profiles are variable, but typically relatively oval in cross
section and sharply tapering. Identified use wear signature for the Historic – Late
Prehistoric specimen is for silica-rich plant contact.

For Terminal Late Archaic

specimens, wood use wear is present on one specimen, with silica-rich plant contact wear
on the other two. The three Late Archaic specimens include two that have silica-rich
plant contact use wear and one that has wear from dry hides. All three Middle Archaic
specimens have silica-rich plant contact use wear.
One unprovenienced fragment interpreted as bodkin manufacturing debitage was
identified in the Arenosa Shelter bone artifact analysis sample. This metacarpal
205

diaphysis had been modified by longitudinal grooving and snapping to remove a bodkin
blank and had no further modification or use wear.
A single Middle Archaic specimen was identified as the distal tip of a
bodkin/perforator manufactured from an artiodactyl metacarpal diaphysis. This sharply
tapering distal section of a long, thin tool had an oval cross section that was 2 mm in
width. Under magnification, the tip exhibited a slight tear-out from use.

While the

blank was prepared by an unknown method, it was possible to determine that the surface
and edges of the tip were ground to final shape. A bright invasive polish, rounding of
high points, and extensive fine, transverse, smooth-edged striations are consistent with
dry hide wear.
Three fragments of narrow tools from Terminal Late Archaic contexts are
interpreted as bone needles on the basis of morphology, manufacturing signatures, and
remnant use wear. One of these was created from the distal ulna diaphysis of a coyote or
domestic dog-sized canid that was scraped to remove the periosteum. It exhibits a
minimally invasive polish that is suggestive of use with dry hide. The other two needles
were fashioned from artiodactyl long bone fragments. In one case, the artiodactyl needle
raw material was not identifiable. In the other case, the raw material source was the
distal ulna diaphysis and epiphysis. The ulna was prepared by grooving and snapping
that removed the tool blank, with deep cutmarks evident under magnification radiating
from the lateral groove and snap fracture. The method used for the other artiodactylderived needle was unclear. Both artiodactyl needle fragments were then longitudinally
scraped to further shape them. The artiodactyl indeterminate long bone needle fragment
was additionally ground to its final form. The proximal half of this tool has over 50
transverse grooves, including nine prominent grooves on one aspect and two on the other
aspect. Its polish signature indicates use wear from fresh or dry hides. The use wear
206

signature on the artiodactyl ulna-derived specimen also has strong transverse striations or
shallow use wear grooving on its proximal one-third and a polish that is consistent with
dry hide use wear.
Fourteen complete or fragmentary perforator specimens were identified in the
bone artifact analysis sample from Arenosa Shelter, with 78 per cent of them originating
from Terminal Late Archaic contexts in strata 3 – 9. The other specimens came from
either Late Archaic (one) or earlier Middle Archaic (two) contexts. Raw material for all
of the Terminal Late Archaic tools was identifiable as from artiodactyl long bones, in two
cases more specifically as the distal metatarsal diaphysis and epiphysis or a more
generalized metapodial diaphysis. Blanks for these long narrow tools were prepared,
either by grooving and snapping, helical fracturing, chopping, or by an unknown method,
and the blanks were then further shaped by longitudinal scraping and grinding to final
form with a narrow oval to virtually round distal cross section. They were apparently
used for several tasks as remnant use wear is indicative of contact with dry hide, hide
with attached hair, fresh hide, silica-rich plants, and wood. The intact tips of three of
these specimens exhibit tip tear-out or the presence of micro-bevels. The long specimen
with the micro-bevels is complete and has multiple transverse deep and broad cutmarks
or grooves across its proximal one-quarter that may indicate a hafting modification. At
least two other specimens appear to be broken remnants of larger tools that were refitted
into the form of a perforator. The Late Archaic specimen was unique as it was a dorsal
spine from a large fish that exhibited a rounded cross section and minimal additional
shaping. Its use wear was consistent with contact from silica-rich plants. The two
Middle Archaic specimens both were identifiable as originating from artiodactyl
metapodia that were prepared in similar fashion to the later tools. Remnant use wear
indicates dry hide and silica-rich plant contact.
207

Another Terminal Late Archaic specimen was identified as a perforator fashioned
from a modified catfish spine. Modified catfish pectoral spines were manufactured into
several forms of tools, including perforators, by scraping or grinding their oval cross
section and tip section. In this case, the tip was ground to a rounded cross section. The
remnant polish on the distal half of the tool indicates use with dry hides.
Two tools from the site’s more recent contexts are similar to the antler pressure
flaking tools previously described. The Historic – Late Prehistoric and Terminal Late
Archaic tools exhibit cross section and tip profile characteristics that are similar to the
antler tools. Each has a relatively rounded tip on a long narrowly tapered distal segment.
Both tools have tips that are 2 – 3 mm in width with an approximately round cross
section. The Historic – Late Prehistoric specimen has a rounded tip profile with slight
crushing damage and small amount of lateral tear-out. The Terminal Late Archaic
context tool has a rounded, slightly beveled tip. Tool blanks for both were prepared by
an unknown method, with subsequent longitudinal scraping and grinding to final shape.
Under magnification, both tips have use wear characteristics that include longitudinal
scrapes and striations or bright invasive polish that is consistent with contact by siliceous
stone.
Two tools used in woodworking were distinguished in the sample of bone
artifacts analyzed from the site, both here termed rib tools. Both were fashioned from
artiodactyl bone, in once case identifiable as a distal rib segment. One was a distal
fragment from a larger Historic – Late Prehistoric tool with a widely tapered, beveled tip.
While the blank for this specimen was prepared by an unknown method, it was scraped to
final shape. The Terminal Late Archaic context tool blank was prepared by grooving and
snapping followed by scraping to final shape. Use wear on both specimens was
consistent with wood contact.
208

The largest group of formal implements are variants on the spatulate theme that
includes an oval distal tip cross section as its central definition. Two hundred twenty
seven specimens of these were identified in the analyzed sample. They included
examples from each identified cultural context producing bone tools, as well as
unprovenienced specimens. The most frequent tools in this group were those defined
specifically as within the spatulate implement form. Within this group there were 184
complete or fragmentary tools, over 55 per cent (102 specimens) from Terminal Late
Archaic context. Middle Archaic spatulates accounted for the next most frequent
constituent of the spatulate form, with slightly more than 17 per cent (32 spatulate
fragments) identified in the sample. Late Archaic spatulate fragment were almost as
numerous as those from the previous cultural context, with slightly more than 15 percent
(28 fragments). While less numerous, the 15 complete and fragmentary Historic – Late
Prehistoric spatulates included one complete tool and included about 8 per cent of this
form identified in the Arenosa Shelter sample. Slightly less than 4 per cent (7 spatulate
fragments) were unprovenienced.
As stated previously, the 15 Historic – Late Prehistoric spatulates included one
complete tool, with 14 additional fragmentary tools also present. Complete or relatively
complete specimens measured 140 – 160 mm in length and 15 – 25 mm in width. About
half of the Historic – Late Prehistoric spatulates had sufficient portions of the distal ends
to determine tip profile characteristics. Narrow, constricted tip sections were present in 4
cases. Broad, sharply taped tip sections were present in 3 cases. Due to tip damage, tip
profiles were only identifiable as rounded in 3 instances and relatively sharp in a single
case.
Artiodactyls provided raw materials for 13 of the 15 specimens, two of which
were identifiable as deer. Source animals for the other two Historic – Late Prehistoric
209

spatulate fragments were identifiable only as medium to large mammal. Five artiodactyl
metapodials, three artiodactyl metatarsals, a deer metatarsal and metacarpal, a medium to
large mammal rib, a medium-sized mammal tibia, and four artiodactyl indeterminate long
bones served as raw material for the Historic – Late Prehistoric spatulate tool blanks.
The blank preparation method for eight (53 per cent) of these specimens was not
identifiable, six (40 per cent) involved grooving and snapping, and one (7 per cent) used
a helically fractured fragment of butchering waste as a starting point for further
modification. It should be noted here that blank preparation method is not identifiable
where subsequent shaping and smoothing have removed evidence for it, such as on the
distal ends of tools. The prepared blanks were shaped and smoothed by use of both
longitudinal scraping and grinding in just over half (eight) of the Historic – Late
Prehistoric spatulate cases, longitudinal scraping only in about 27 per cent (four) of the
cases, and grinding only in about 20 per cent (three) of instances. In two cases,
additional scraping and grinding was use to refit and reshape broken tools to extend their
useful life.
Use wear characteristics for the Historic – Late Prehistoric spatulate specimens
also varied. Due to weathering, root-etching, carnivore-ravaging, and other surface
destructive forces, four of the 15 complete or fragmentary spatulates from this context did
not retain identifiable remnant use wear. Ten of the remaining 11 (61 per cent of total)
had been used with a variety of materials that included silica-rich plants (20 per cent),
fresh hides (20 per cent), dry hides (7 per cent), hide with attached hair (7 per cent), and
wood (7 per cent). One specimen (7 per cent) had wear from both silica-rich plants and
dry hide.
Slightly more than 100 complete and fragmentary spatulates were identified from
Terminal Late Archaic context in the Arenosa Shelter bone artifact collection sample that
210

was analyzed during the current research. These included three complete spatulates and
99 fragments of varying portions of spatulate tools.
Complete or relatively complete specimens from Terminal Late Archaic context
measured 70 – 175 mm in length and 14 – 28 mm in width. About 25 per cent of the
specimens had sufficient portions of the distal end present to determine tip section
characteristics or tip profiles. Narrow, constricted tip sections were present in 18 cases.
Broad, sharply taped tip sections were present in three cases. Due to tip damage, tip
profiles were only identifiable in 12 cases with rounded profiles found in three instances
and relatively sharp in four cases. Beveling of the tip accounted for eight of the tip
profiles, sometimes accompanying rounding or sharpness of the tip.
Artiodactyls provided raw materials for 100 of the 102 specimens, 29 of which
were identifiable as deer. Source animals for the other two Terminal Late Archaic
spatulate fragments were identifiable as freshwater drum in one case or mammal in
another case, providing a dorsal spine and indeterminate long bone, respectively. Raw
material for Terminal Late Archaic spatulate tool blanks was provided by long bone from
undifferentiated artiodactyls that included 26 metapodials, 17 metatarsals, four
metacarpals, two tibiae, one humerus, one ulna, and 20 indeterminate long bones. Deer
bone used as raw materials included 25 metatarsals, two metacarpals, and two
metapodials.
The blank preparation method for 37 (36 per cent) of these specimens was not
identifiable, 55 (54 per cent) involved grooving and snapping, five (5 per cent) chopping,
and five (5 per cent) used a helically fractured fragment of butchering waste as a starting
point for further modification. It should be noted here that blank preparation method is
not identifiable where subsequent shaping and smoothing have removed evidence for it,
such as on the distal ends of tools. The prepared blanks were shaped and smoothed by
211

use of both longitudinal scraping and grinding in 25 per cent (26) of the Terminal Late
Archaic spatulate cases, longitudinal scraping only in about 60 per cent (61) of the cases,
and grinding only in about 13 per cent (13) of instances. Refitting appears to have been
employed to reshape tools to extend their use in five cases.
Use wear characteristics for the Terminal Late Archaic spatulate specimens also
varied.

Due to weathering, root-etching, carnivore-ravaging, and other surface

destructive forces, three of the 102 complete or fragmentary spatulates from this context
did not retain identifiable remnant use wear. The remaining 99 (97 per cent of total) had
been used with a variety of materials that included silica-rich plants (61 per cent of total),
fresh hides (4 per cent of total), dry hides (5 per cent of total), hide with attached hair (1
per cent of total), and wood (24.5 per cent). At least five specimens had multiple use
wear signatures, indicating multiple uses or a complex history of use.
The Late Archaic spatulate inventory analyzed in this study included 28
fragmentary specimens from a context within strata 10 and 11. The most complete
specimens from Late Archaic context measured 97 – 164 mm in length and 19 – 25 mm
in width. Only six of the specimens had sufficient portions of the distal end present to
determine tip section characteristics or tip profiles. Narrow, constricted tip sections were
present in four cases. Medium width tip sections were present in a single case. A broad,
sharply taped tip section was present in one case. Due to damage or absence, profiles of
the extreme tip were only identifiable in four cases with rounded profiles found in two
instances and relatively sharp in one. No beveling of the tip sections was noted for Late
Archaic specimens.
Artiodactyls provided raw materials for all of the 28 specimens, seven of which
were identifiable as deer. Raw material for Late Archaic spatulate tool blanks was
provided by long bone from undifferentiated artiodactyls that included nine metapodials,
212

four metatarsals, one tibia, and seven indeterminate long bones. Deer bone used as raw
materials included four metatarsals and three metacarpals.
The blank preparation method for 15 (53.6 per cent) of these specimens was not
identifiable, 12 (42.9 per cent) involved grooving and snapping, and one (3.5 per cent)
used a helically fractured fragment of butchering waste as a starting point for further
modification. The prepared Late Archaic spatulate blanks were shaped and smoothed by
use of both longitudinal scraping and grinding in 68 per cent (19) of the cases,
longitudinal scraping only in about 14 per cent (four) of the cases, and grinding only in
about 3.6 per cent (one) of instances. Refitting appears to have been employed to reshape
tools to extend their use in three cases.
Use wear characteristics for the Late Archaic spatulate specimens were variable.
Due to weathering, root-etching, carnivore-ravaging, and other surface destructive forces,
only one of the 28 complete or fragmentary spatulates from this context did not retain
identifiable remnant use wear. The remaining 27 (96.4 per cent of total) had been used
with a variety of materials that included silica-rich plants (42.8 per cent of total), fresh
hides (3.6 per cent of total), dry hides (3.6 per cent of total), and wood (17.8 per cent).
At least one specimen had multiple use wear signatures, indicating multiple uses or a
complex history of use. This refitted spatulate fragment was used with both silica-rich
plant material and dry hides.
Middle Archaic spatulates included in the current Arenosa Shelter bone artifact
analysis included 29 fragmentary specimens from between stratum 12 and stratum 30.
Middle Archaic spatulate were considerably more fragmented than those from more
recent contexts, with only three of the spatulates exceeding 80 mm in length.

The

longest of these was 96 mm in length and was only a portion of a longer tool. A
relatively complete shorter tool was 40 mm in length. Due to the inclusion of epiphyseal
213

portions of the raw material bones in some of finished tools, maximum tool widths
approaching 35 mm were noted although most fragments were considerable narrower.
Only two of the specimens had sufficient portions of the distal end present to determine
tip section characteristics or tip profiles. A narrow, constricted tip section was present in
one case. One beveled tip section was noted for Middle Archaic specimens.
Artiodactyls provided raw materials for all 29 Middle Archaic specimens, seven
of which were identifiable as deer. Raw material for these spatulate tool blanks was
provided by long bone from undifferentiated artiodactyls that included 13 metapodials,
seven metatarsals, one tibia, and one indeterminate long bones. Deer bone used as raw
materials included four metacarpals and three metatarsals.
The blank preparation method for 12 (41 per cent) of these Middle Archaic
specimens was not identifiable, 15 (52 per cent) involved grooving and snapping, one
(3.5 per cent) used chopping, and one (3.5 per cent) used a helically fractured fragment of
butchering waste as a starting point for further modification. The prepared Middle
Archaic spatulate blanks were shaped and smoothed by use of both longitudinal scraping
and grinding in 62 per cent (18) of the cases, longitudinal scraping only in about 28 per
cent (eight) of the cases, and grinding only in about 10 per cent (three) of instances.
Refitting appears to have been employed to reshape a single tool to extend its use.
While weathering, root-etching, carnivore-ravaging, and other destructive forces
acted to fragment spatulates that were deposited in cultural deposits within Arenosa
Shelter’s Middle Archaic context, all 29 fragmentary spatulates from this context in the
sample retained identifiable remnant use wear. Use wear characteristics for the Middle
Archaic spatulate specimens were variable. The majority had been used with silica-rich
plants (72 per cent), although the tools were also used on other materials that included

214

sinew (3.4 per cent), and wood (24 per cent) made up the rest. No specimen had multiple
use wear signatures that might indicate multiple uses or a complex history of use.
Unprovenienced fragmentary spatulates accounted for 7 of the specimens in the
current analysis. Five of these were fashioned from the remains of undifferentiated
artiodactyls, one was from a deer, and the last was from an unidentified medium to large
mammal. Three of the artiodactyl-derived specimens were relatively large, between 65
and 80 mm in length. Four of the deer or artiodactyl-based spatulate fragments were in
excess of 14 mm in width. Only one of the specimens had sufficient portions of the distal
end present to determine tip section characteristics or tip profiles. A narrow, constricted
tip section with bevel was present in the case of the unidentified medium to large
mammal.
The blank preparation method for three (43 per cent) of these unprovenienced
spatulate specimens was not identifiable, three (43 per cent) involved grooving and
snapping, and one (14 per cent) used a helically fractured fragment of butchering waste
as a starting point for further modification. The unprovenienced prepared spatulate
blanks were shaped and smoothed by use of both longitudinal scraping and grinding in 72
per cent (five) of the cases and grinding only in about 14 per cent (one) of instances. A
single case (14 per cent) was too weathered and carnivore ravage to determine shaping or
smoothing measures that may have been used in its manufacture. Signs of refitting to
extend their use were not recognized in any of these unprovenienced fragmentary
implements.
All unprovenienced fragmentary spatulates in the sample retained identifiable
remnant use wear, although one specimen had only faint traces that could not be
identified. Use wear characteristics for the unprovenienced spatulate specimens were
variable. The majority (four specimens, 57 per cent) had been used with, although three
215

(43 per cent0 of the tools were also used on silica-rich plants. No specimen had multiple
use wear signatures that might indicate multiple uses or a complex history of use.
An additional form of spatulate found exclusively in Terminal Late Archaic
context is made from catfish pectoral spines that had modification of the distal tips, and
in some cases, more extensive modifications to the diaphysis of the element. Six
specimens of catfish spine spatulates were identified in the Arenosa Shelter bone artifact
sample analyzed in the current research. Several of the specimens contain the same
transverse deep cutmarks at their base that was noted in Chapter 5 as severing the
muscles that control the friction-locking mechanism which holds the spines rigidly erect
when the fish is threatened. The Arenosa Shelter residents apparently disarmed the
catfish’s defenses during catch or butchering and the resulting cutmarks remaining on
later tools. Three of the catfish spine spatulates have sharp tips and two have the tips
absent. Blank smoothing and shaping was done by longitudinal scraping and/or grinding
to flatten the cross-section, remove the teeth along the spine’s edges, and to modify the
tip profile. Remnant use wear is present on five of the specimens that show use with
silica-rich plant materials (three specimens), fresh hides (one specimen), and dry hides
(one specimen).
Variants of more typical spatulates were also included in the Arenosa Shelter
sample analysis. The first of these was the spatulate/bodkin, a possible Terminal Late
Archaic tool form that was fashioned from appendicular skeletal elements of deer or
pronghorn-sized artiodactyls. Five spatulate/bodkin specimens were recovered from
Terminal Late Archaic contexts at Arenosa Shelter and studied during the current
research. Another three unprovenienced specimens were also recovered during the
Arenosa Shelter excavations and analyzed as part of this study. Except for one first
phalange, each of these was manufactured from a distal metacarpal. Source animal for six
216

of these artiodactyl-derived tools were recognizable as deer.

Three of the

spatulate/bodkin fragments were large enough to determine that the complete tools would
have been in excess of 120 mm long and about 20 mm wide. Blank preparation was by
grooving and snapping (three specimens), or by unknown methods that may have
included either chopping or dynamic fracturing (five specimens). Shaping and smoothing
evidence points to scraping and grinding being used, with heavy modification of the area
around the condyles by grinding into the underlying cancellous bone. In at least one
instance, the medial groove between the condyles was hollowed out. Remnant use wear
is suggestive of uses with silica-rich plant materials (six specimens), dry hide (one
specimen), and hide with attached hair (one specimen).
A single spatulate/creaser from Terminal Late Archaic context was fashioned,
similar to bodkins and spatulate/bodkins, from the metacarpal of a deer-sized artiodactyl.
This long narrow tool had a narrow, tapered, and beveled tip section with a rounded
profile. The cross section of the tip section is a narrow oval. Blank preparation was by
chopping, using longitudinal scraping and grinding to with smooth and shape the tool to
its final form. The wear signature is consistent with use on fresh hides.
Spatulate/perforators were also found in Terminal Late Archaic context. Two of
them originated from artiodactyl metapodia, but the third was fashioned from a catfish
pectoral spine. These long narrow tools had very constricted tip sections with an oval
cross section and rounded profile. The catfish specimen had several ground micro-bevels
evident under magnification, but was otherwise minimally modified. The artiodactyl
metapodial-based spatulate/perforator blanks were prepared using unknown methods,
then ground or scraped and ground to final form. Use wear signature for all three
Terminal Late Archaic spatulate/perforators was consistent with dry hide contact.

217

Five fragmentary narrow spatulates were documented within the analysis sample,
the majority from Terminal Late Archaic context in strata 3 – 9. One of the specimens
came from Middle Archaic context, with the final specimen coming from Historic – Late
Prehistoric context above stratum 3. Except for one Terminal Late Archaic specimen for
which the source animal may only be identified as a medium to large size mammal, all of
the narrow spatulates were manufactured from deer or pronghorn-sized artiodactyls. One
of the artiodactyls provided a metatarsal as raw material; the remainder of the artiodactyl
skeletal material was identifiable only to metapodia. The raw material from the
unidentified mammal was identified only as indeterminate long bone. The largest of
these narrow spatulate fragments was almost complete and was 85 mm in length. Most
were between 35 and 50 mm in length, with a width less than 14 mm. Blank preparation
was by grooving and snapping or by unknown methods, with subsequent smoothing to
final shape by scraping or scraping and grinding. Use wear is variable with three of the
five specimens having a signature indicating contact with silica-rich plants, one with
wood, and one with dry hide.
A total of nine spatulate fragments decorated by incising of parallel lines or crosshatching were documented during this analysis. Similar to narrow spatulates, incised
spatulates were most numerous in Terminal Late Archaic context (seven specimens), but
were also found in Middle Archaic and Historic – Late Prehistoric context. All seven
incised spatulates were identifiable as being manufactured from deer-sized artiodactyl
long bones, most typically metapodia. One of these was a deer metatarsal and two
artiodactyl metatarsals were also recognized as providing raw materials for incised
spatulates. Blank preparation was by grooving and snapping in all but two cases where
the method used was unknown. Smoothing and shaping was applied prior to incising of
the decoration on the tools and was done by longitudinal scraping and grinding in four
218

cases, only longitudinal scraping in two cases, and grinding in one case. Tools were
decorated with multiple incised transverse parallel lines, cross hatching, or chevrons, all
typically placed along either a lateral edge or across the proximal end of the tool.
Polishing following incising is indicated in at least two of the cases that have smooth
edges to the incised lines, with a wear signature suggestive of wet or fresh hide that is
separate from the overall use wear pattern for the tool fragment. Use wear for these
seven specimens is predominately from silica-rich plants (six specimens), although wood
(two specimens) and dry hides (one specimen) were also indicated. One specimen was
too weathered to have remaining identifiable use wear.
Five ulna spatulates were recovered from Terminal Late Archaic context and
included in the current analysis. The source animal for these long tools was typically a
deer-sized artiodactyl. Four of these tool fragments were recognizable as deer. The tool
fragments included the proximal epiphysis of the ulna, including the lunar notch and
articulation, and had a distal edge 100 – 125 mm down the diaphysis of the element.
Blank preparation was by grooving and snapping, chopping, or unknown methods, with
further shaping by grooving to produce possible hafting modification, and scraping
and/or grinding. Use wear signatures observable in four of the cases indicated use with
silica-rich plants, dry hides, or wood.
Distally notched spatulates were a distinctly Middle Archaic occurrence in the
analysis sample. Three of these unique spatulate forms were identified. Two of them
were fashioned from deer-sized artiodactyl metacarpals and the third was manufactured
from a medium to large mammal humerus. Each of the specimens had a tip section with
a V-shaped bifurcation that has been scraped or cut into the wide distal end. The
bifurcation is up to 8 mm deep and separates two tips that are up to 5 mm wide and 3 mm
thick. The tips have been shaped by scraping and are blunt and battered on one of the
219

specimens. Helically fractured blanks were prepared for two of the specimens, while the
method for the third could not be determined. Use wear is different for each of the
specimens. The short, blunt-tipped artiodactyl specimen has wear from wood contact.
The longer, more sharply tipped artiodactyl specimen has wear from contact with sinew
and the unidentified mammal specimen has wear from hide with attached hair.
A single item from Middle Archaic context was identified that was similar in
several ways to the artiodactyl-derived distally notched spatulates previously described.
It was a lateral fragment from the proximal end of a longitudinally split tool form that had
been prepared by surface scraping and then had a deep, wide bifurcation incised or
scraped along its mid-point. A remnant of a second 3.5 mm long tip section was present,
across the bifurcation from the main portion of the fragment. The proximal end exhibited
a transverse groove and snap fracture. The overall profile of this tool fragment was
roughly in a J-shape. The burned condition of the fragment limited an accurate
determination of its use wear. The overall layout also suggests a preform for a bone fish
hook as described in Harrell (1983).
Also from Middle Archaic context came a specimen of softshell turtle plastron
that has faint incised cross-hatching. The fragment has a bright, slightly invasive polish
present on its surfaces and numerous smooth-edged striations oblique or paralleling one
axis of the cross-hatching. The use wear is consistent with contact from fresh hides.
Two relatively small tools exhibit a stepped triangular profile that is otherwise
unknown in the analyzed sample and were termed wedges. One of these came from
Terminal Late Archaic context and the other was unprovenienced. Both of these
specimens were fashioned from artiodactyl appendicular skeletal material, although the
raw material for the Terminal Late Archaic specimen could not be identified beyond
indeterminate long bone. The raw material for the unprovenienced specimen was
220

identifiable as the proximal diaphysis of a deer 3 rd phalange. Both of these short, wide,
sharply tapering tools had three shallow transverse stepped grooves cut and ground across
their surfaces. The tip of the unprovenienced specimen exhibited slightly tear-out. The
use wear present on each specimen is indicative of contact by wood, with a non-invasive
to slightly invasive polish and rounding of features, with longitudinal striations evident
on the Terminal Late Archaic specimen.
The final tool form encountered in the Arenosa Shelter bone artifact analysis
sample was also apparently used in conjunction with processing of wood. A single
unprovenienced specimen derived from an artiodactyl metatarsal diaphysis was
manufactured from spatulate manufacturing debitage. This tool had a moderately narrow
(7 mm width), beveled tip that had several facets ground across its face. Although the tip
is broken, the facets and limited adjacent areas retain discoloration and polish on high
points, with limited rounding of the facet edges. Also present are grouped narrow,
smooth-edged, oblique striations angling back from the discolored areas at the tip and the
thicker lateral edge. This use wear is consistent with wood contact.
An unprovenienced spatulate manufacturing blank failure fashioned from a
heavily deer tibia diaphysis was scraped to remove the periosteum prior to cutting of a
transverse groove and snap the distal epiphysis. A helical fracture is also present on the
other end of this specimen. This item has no evidence of subsequent shaping or wear
from use.
Nine examples of spatulate manufacturing debitage were identified in the analysis
sample. All were fashioned from artiodactyl long bone, with one of them being
identifiable as a deer metatarsal that included the proximal epiphysis.

Six of the

specimens were from Terminal Late Archaic strata and included diaphyses segments
from four metatarsals, a tibia, and a humerus. A single Late Archaic specimen was
221

identifiable as an undifferentiated artiodactyl metapodial, as was one of two Middle
Archaic specimens. The final Middle Archaic specimen was the deer metatarsal
mentioned previously. Processing of the elements to remove tool blanks was similar for
most specimens, with grooving and snapping being used to detach portions of the element
either longitudinally or transversely. In the case of the Middle Archaic deer metatarsal,
grooving and snapping was used to detach the blank from the epiphysis following helical
fracturing. Longitudinal scraping was used to remove the periosteum or being initial
scraping for the Late Archaic specimen and two of the Terminal Late Archaic specimens,
each a metapodial. One of the specimens from Terminal Late Archaic context shows
wear from contact with wood, possibly during the manufacturing process.
A single example interpreted as debitage from refitting of a spatulate was
recognized that originated from within Terminal Late Archaic context. This metapodial
fragment had a distal transverse groove and snap fracture and evidence of longitudinal
scraping. The remnant use wear indicates contact with dry hide.
Three spatulate preforms or early stage blanks from Terminal Late Archaic
context were identified in the collection sample. All were from artiodactyls, one
recognizably form a deer metacarpal. One includes a segment from the distal half of a
preform that has been scraped to shape, but not yet ground to its final profile. Another is
from the proximal half of a preform that has been prepared by grooving and snapping to
detach the blank and longitudinally scraped to shape, but not yet ground to its final form.
The third specimen has lateral edges that are have begun to be smoothed to its final form
following scraping.
A similar fragment of a preform from Terminal Late Archaic context was
identified as a separate tool preform. This deer metatarsal fragment is helically fractured
and carnivore ravaged but was identified as an early stage spatulate or perforator preform.

III. INTERPRETATION
Chapter 7: Discussion
OVERVIEW OF SUBSISTENCE EVIDENCE AT A RENOSA SHELTER
Excellent preservation of perishable materials in Lower Pecos region
archaeological sites allows researchers to put the reliance of prehistoric inhabitants on
faunal resources into perspective with their reliance on floral resources. The results of
the current research using collections obtained during excavations at Arenosa Shelter in
the mid- to late 1960s have clarified issues concerning prehistoric subsistence practices.
This is especially true for those relating to procurement and processing of terrestrial and
aquatic fauna in the Lower Pecos cultural region. The relationship of fauna-centered
subsistence practices of prehistoric inhabitants to their bone modification practices is
reflected in how faunal residues were incorporated into the technological base as raw
materials for ornaments or implements. While not necessarily issuing from the other
process, a more complete understanding of the Lower Pecos cultural region’s bone
technology is enriched by a thorough understanding of the results of prehistoric
subsistence behaviors practiced by the region’s inhabitants.
Arenosa Shelter’s depositional history, its effects on the site’s taphonomic history
and subsequently, its effects on the resulting bone artifact collection analyzed as part of
the current research, limit the full magnitude of this increased understanding to the past
4,500 years.

Thus, any understanding about the regional interrelationship between

subsistence and technology behaviors that is based on the Arenosa Shelter collections is
limited to the Middle Archaic or later cultural stages. However, some insight into

224

subsistence behaviors and the region’s faunal makeup during the Early Archaic and
Paleoindian stages is possible using the Arenosa Shelter faunal collection.
Chronological Units
For analytical purposes, the current research separated the Lower Pecos’s defined
cultural chronology into six periods that are slightly different than typically used in the
region. Part of the author’s reasoning behind such modifications to how culture history is
considered is that the site’s depositional history, the excavation techniques used, and the
recovery strategies employed by the site’s excavators do not allow deposits from Late
Prehistoric and Historic stages at Arenosa Shelter to be differentiated. Another part of
the reasoning for presenting an atypical view of culture history is that the portion of the
collection from the earliest Late Archaic context may be securely differentiated from later
portions. Doing so allows a comparison between subsets of data that allow tools and
ornaments from the earlier Cibola period, with its emphasis on big game and cultural
similarities to the Southern Plains, to be differentiated from the remainder of the Late
Archaic portion of the collection. Due to the predominance of Late Archaic artifacts in
the bone artifact collection, the ability to differentiate between portions of this period is
beneficial to interpreting the results.
Table 7.1 is presented to reiterate the current minor modifications to defined
regional cultural stages used in the current research. Approximate dates used in the table
are in the format originally presented by the site’s excavator using uncorrected
radiocarbon years before present.
The uppermost of the Paleoindian strata in Arenosa Shelter contains the single
radiocarbon assay from the site’s deepest strata. This assay yielded a date of 9,550
radiocarbon years before present. Due to the paucity of charcoal or other datable material
found in lower strata, the site’s excavator was unable to firmly date the late Pleistocene –
225

early Holocene faunal remains in strata 40 – 42 at the time that the original radiocarbon
dates were done.
To review data introduced in Chapter 5, the bulk of analyzed subsistence remains
was in cultural contexts that dated to the Late Archaic or later. The highest NISP
frequency in the sample came from Terminal Late Archaic context, a NISP:MNI/MNE
ratio of 6.03. Comparing NISP:MNI/MNE ratios between Historic – Late Prehistoric and
Late Archaic contexts yields values of 2.19:1 and 3.19:1. This difference is interpreted as
an indication of a considerably higher degree of fragmentation among Terminal Late
Archaic materials that had a much higher NISP frequency, but lower MNI/MNE
frequency in relation to the NISP. Late Prehistoric – Historic remains were less
fragmented than other late context faunal remains from Arenosa Shelter.
While not totally absent from earlier Archaic contexts, subsistence remains were
much less frequent. They exhibited a 60 per cent decrease in total abundance between
the earlier of the Late Archaic time periods and the Middle Archaic. A much more
drastic reduction in frequency occurred between the Middle Archaic and preceding Early
Archaic. Extremely disturbed Early Archaic cultural remains from Arenosa Shelter
provided minimal evidence of either faunal remains or subsistence behaviors of the
region’s human inhabitants. They were contained in strata that evidenced major flood
perturbation. Due to favorable preservation conditions provided by the “mother rock”
against the effects of subsequent high energy flooding, faunal remains from Paleoindian
context were more frequent than those from the subsequent Middle Archaic and Early
Archaic.
Paleoindian faunal remains were more than 15 times more abundant than Early
Archaic remains and as abundant as those from the Middle Archaic. Composite
NISP:MNI/MNE ratios for Middle Archaic, Early Archaic, and Paleoindian contexts are
226

3.19, 2.17, and 6.2, respectively. A comparison of these ratios shows that the Middle
Archaic and Early Archaic faunal materials are less fragmented than faunal remains from
the Paleoindian period. They are also less fragmented than remains from Terminal Late
Archaic contexts.
Working with this concept and data about relative abundance of vertebrate body
size classes presented in Chapter 5, the degree of element fragmentation present in
cultural contexts may be compared.

Table 7.2 presents NISP:MNI/MNE ratios

aggregated for each vertebrate body size class by cultural context.
Low values for ratios in Table 7.2 are consistent with either a low frequency or a
direct correspondence between NISP and MNI/MNE, such as would occur with single
prey animals contained in human coprolites or predator scat deposited in dry cave sites.
Similarly, the higher values for the NISP:MNI/MNE ratios for undetermined fish and
mammals in Terminal Late Archaic contexts are strongly affected by the low MNI/MNE
frequency for these particular taxonomic groupings.
Mammals were the most frequent faunal residues in all cultural contexts. Fish also
constituted a sizable constituent of the faunal remains. During the current analysis,
fragmentation of specimens in the collection was noted as originating from cultural
behavior-induced changes or carnivore ravaging that occurred before deposition and
diagenetic changes that occurred in skeletal elements after deposition. Due to the
structure of bone as a matrix of longitudinal fibers in a collagen matrix, it reacts
negatively to physical stresses after changes that reduce the internal moisture content of
the collagen matrix. Relatively greater intensity of diagenetic changes or cultural
processing both impacted bone deposited in the site by fragmenting it and rendered this
sizable portion unidentifiable.

Highly fragmented mammal and fish remains

unidentifiable to taxa lower than vertebrate class were especially common in the
227

Terminal Late Archaic period. Remains representing unidentifiable mammals or fish
constituted a significant part of the total faunal remains and almost 20 per cent of the
NISP frequency for the Terminal Late Archaic period.
Subsistence evidence for the Paleoindian period is limited. While large mammal
remains identified as Bison antiquus or Equus sp. are relatively numerous, evidence for
cultural modification of them is limited, at least partly due to the deteriorated physical
condition of the fragments themselves and carnivore ravaging of the fragments’ surfaces.
Also, the less sophisticated recovery strategy used in the stratum 42 Paleoindian deposits
at Arenosa Shelter did not allow for reconstruction of bone fragment scatters, such as
those in basal strata at Bonfire Shelter (Bement 1986). A single bison radius from
stratum 42 exhibits a transverse cut mark that would sever the brachialis muscle insertion.
Three of the bone fragments from this same stratum show evidence of dynamic fracturing
that could potentially be due to controlled bone breakage similar to that documented by
Bement (1986) in the Late Pleistocene basal deposits at Bonfire Shelter in bone
fragments surrounding an anvil.
Other potential evidence for Paleoindian subsistence practices includes the
carcass of a young Bison antiquus bull from Feature 18 in stratum 40. Interpretation of
these remains is again limited by their poor physical condition and incomplete recovery
of documented remains from this very constrained excavation under the “mother rock”.
None of the remains examined from Feature 18 has any evidence of cutmarks and none
had evident helical fractures that could be related to controlled bone breakage.
The earliest evidence for possible subsistence practices in the site comes from the
limited faunal material remaining in the highly disturbed deposits in Early Archaic
context. Although originating from the redeposited spally lag facies in stratum 32, north
of N200, a single burned deer metatarsal fragment was recovered that may provide
228

evidence of prehistoric cultural behavior although it did not contain cut marks associated
with subsistence activities.
Subsistence practices in the Middle Archaic are more solidly documented due
both to the less disturbed, primary context that they originate within and the higher
frequency of Middle Archaic vertebrate remains that reconstruction of the practices are
based upon. Rodents clearly enter the subsistence picture during this period, with the
gray squirrel, ground squirrel, gopher, wood rat, and beaver being hunted or trapped
using snares or nets evident in the archeological record (Shafer 1986:72 – 78). Medium
to large mammal remains from this context are burned or exhibit helical fractures. The
remains of a coyote or domestic dog were broken using dynamic fracturing, possibly to
obtain marrow or to use in tool making, and a small fox was damaged by heat, potentially
from roasting. Fish included a wide variety of gar, catfish, large suckers, and drum
caught from the rivers using nets, toxicants, or other means. They were filleted and
cooked. Dabbling ducks were also hunted along the rivers, as were soft-shelled turtles
that could be carefully picked up. In the brushy main canyons and other areas with
suitable cover, quail were taken, possibly by throwing stick, rocks, or thrown nets. Both
deer and antelope were included in the artiodactyl herbivores hunted in the river canyons
and surrounding terrain.

Middle Archaic remains from deer or pronghorn-sized

ruminants contain butchering evidence of carcass dismemberment and defleshing. They
also contain evidence for heavy fragmentation of the resulting bone for marrow removal.
By the early part of the Late Archaic, considerably more subsistence evidence
accumulated.

Rodents continue to occur as subsistence residues, but beginning in this

period, remains of small and large rabbits begin to appear prominently in the
archeological record of Arenosa Shelter, allowing their role in prehistoric subsistence
practices to be determined. Rabbits were driven into nets, clubbed with throwing sticks,
229

or snared. Skinning and butchering of jackrabbits is documented from placement of
cutmarks on remains in this context. Butchering evidence of these larger rabbits is such
that it indicates skinning prior to disarticulation and dismemberment of the appendages,
then defleshing of the dismembered carcass. The evidence for cottontails is somewhat
similar, although skinning behavior may not include skinning the head out and
disarticulation of the shoulder and hip joints by cutting was not practiced on these smaller
rabbits. An alternative method used with the smaller rabbits appears to have been
severing the muscle masses on the proximal upper long bones, with subsequent breaking
of the long bone diaphysis itself. Burning patterns on long bone elements indicates
damage with the meat still on the bone partially insulating elements and supports an
interpretation of secondary butchering following completion of cooking.
Turtles were collected and prepared for food during the Late Archaic, as indicated
by dismemberment evidence on the long bones. Both soft-shelled and snapping turtles
were hunted or trapped. The animals may have been roasted in the shell, as burned
softshell turtle carapace fragments also occur in this context.
Fish from the region’s rivers continued to be netted, poisoned, or obtained
through other means including noodling or other physical methods as part of the
subsistence behavior used in the Late Archaic, as indicated by heat alteration and
butchering damage. Catfish could be caught by noodling, speared in shallow water, or by
use of weirs. Prior to butchering, the musculature controlling their defensive pectoral
spines was severed or the spines themselves were snapped off. Several larger species of
catfish included those with deep water habitat preferences and habits required use of nets
and toxicants. The butchering of these and other fish by the Lower Pecos prehistoric
inhabitants during the early part of the Late Archaic continued the Middle Archaic
practice of filleting. Other medium to larger fish species included freshwater drum and
230

suckers, both indicating a wide variety of habitats being tapped by the subsistence
behaviors, including the deeper pools of the rivers. Many of these species have oily flesh
that is higher in calorie content (Lord (1977).
During the early part of the Late Archaic, geese and diving ducks were trapped,
hunted, or netted near the deeper riverine pools as they migrated through the region in fall
or spring. Gulls were also taken when present, possibly with throwing sticks or thrown
rocks. Roadrunners, quail, small hawks such as Mississippi kites and sparrow hawks, and
larger hawks were taken for food or other uses using thrown nets, snares, or other means.
Complementing rabbits, artiodactyls also provided a major part of the animalbased subsistence during the early part of the Late Archaic, with at least three forms
contributing to the larder, tool kit, and economy. Mule deer, undifferentiated deer, and
non-diagnostic remains of artiodactyls that could not be distinguished between deer and
antelope were identified within this context. The skins were carefully removed, and then
the carcasses were disarticulated, largely dismembered, and defleshed. Burning of bone
fragments in the collection indicates housekeeping in the shelter to dispose of defleshed
remains and possible roasting. The long bones of artiodactyls were fractured to remove
marrow or for bone grease production, as was splitting of the bones and further
modifications done as part of incorporating this material into the tool-making practices.
The Terminal Late Archaic saw a continuation of previous emphases on using a
wide variety of animal sources of food, bone, and skins, but with a possible broadening to
an emphasis on skins from medium-sized mammalian carnivores. Specialized techniques
were used to take complete skins from medium sized carnivores. Turkeys and doves
were present in the brushy canyons and served as food and other uses. Hawks continued
to be hunted, snared, or netted for multiple purposes. The riffles and pools of the rivers
region’s canyons continued to provide sustenance. Hunters or gatherers collected soft231

shelled and pond slider turtles; trapped, hunted, or netted ducks and geese; caught
shovelnose sturgeon, large gar, several species of small to very large catfish, carpsuckers,
suckers and buffalo fish, white bass, and temperate bass using nets, weirs, toxicants, and
more direct means such as noodling. Beavers and muskrats were also trapped from these
well-watered zones. Smaller game, such as rock squirrels, were hunted or trapped on the
rocky slopes overlooking the canyons and on the canyon walls themselves. Cotton rats
and woodrats were also clubbed, snared or other trapped, or netted. Rabbits also
continued to be netted, trapped, and hunted with throwing sticks in the canyons and
surrounding semi-arid uplands. Deer and antelope again were hunted by Lower Pecos
hunters in the canyons and uplands, adding additional protein and fats to fare used to
support the prehistoric inhabitants of the canyons. Limited evidence from Arenosa
Shelter also supports possible opportunistic hunting of an occasional bison in the canyons
and surrounding upland grassland savannahs.
During the Historic – Late Prehistoric period, limited evidence is provided for
incorporation of European domestic animals into the local subsistence economy. These
animals became available prior to the mid-eighteenth century to the mobile groups of
Apache and Comanche tribes documented by Spanish civil and ecclesiastical authorities
(Kenmotsu and Wade 2002:26-32, 65-68; Weddle 1968:325). Spanish military
expeditions passed nearby or through the region beginning as early as the 1670s. Native
American raiding of Spanish colonial ranches in Texas and across the Rio Grande in
Mexico occurred early in the eighteenth century. Direct Spanish entradas into the region
and Native American raiding or acquisition of Spanish stock both made domestic sheep,
goats, and possibly cattle, available on a sporadic basis to the canyon residents in the
Lower Pecos region. During the mid-1800s, more intensive ranching by Anglo-

232

Americans settling in the Lower Pecos region introduced these animals to the canyon
lands on a regular basis.
Specimens identified from stratum 2 included a large bovid molar fragment that
could not be differentiated between cow and bison, one metacarpal fragment verified to
be domestic sheep, and 11 fragments that could not be differentiated between domestic
sheep and goat. Procurement of indigenous artiodactyls also continued, with pronghorns,
deer, and the sparse bison that inhabited the uplands hunted. Rabbits continue their
significance to the nutrition and industry of the local inhabitants. The importance of fish
and other aquatic species continues, according to patterns established much earlier in the
region’s prehistory.
Diachronic Changes
Major regional climate changes, the resulting episodic high-energy floods, and
evolution or extirpation of species themselves has altered the landscape of the Lower
Pecos region since the end of the Pleistocene. Changes in plants and animals present in
the canyons and surrounding uplands of the Lower Pecos have followed the regional
trend as the terrestrial and aquatic communities adapted to hotter, drier conditions. Many
life forms present at the end of the Pleistocene either became extinct, were regionally
extirpated, or evolved to smaller size that were sometimes different enough to be
classified new species or subspecies. This was true both for the large herbivores and
carnivores that preyed on them and also for smaller species, such as white-tailed deer
(McDonald 1981:250; Jerry Cooke, May, 2004:personal communication). The life forms
present in the region have also adapted to more localized cataclysmic habitat change
phenomena following destructive floods and other major runoff events that removed
large trees in the river floodplains and significantly altered long-standing regimes of
riverine riffles and pools.
233

Adjustments by the prehistoric inhabitants in their subsistence economy through
time are obvious as they involve changes in targeted habitat niches or evolutionary
changes in target species themselves. A discussion of such changes documented by the
current research follows.
Species Evolution and Replacement
Species present in the region during the Pleistocene included a large, long-horned
form of bison, Bison antiquus, and a large subspecies of raccoon, Procyon lotor simus.
Both of these were replaced in the region over time by related species or subspecies,
although the timing of replacement was significantly different for each. The long-horned
bison was replaced on the Southern Plains during the early Holocene, possibly evolving
into the modern species of Bison bison. Paleozoologists and vertebrate paleontologists
do not agree about the taxonomy and genetic relationship of late Pleistocene bison, the
possible relationship between species or subspecies of bison in the early Holocene, and
the ensuing evolutionary history of modern bison (Frison 1984; Frison, et al. 1976; Lewis
2003; McDonald 1981; Skinner and Kaisen 1947; Wilson 1974, 1975; and Wyckoff and
Dalquest 1997). Bison antiquus does not occur in deposits more recent than the Early
Archaic here or elsewhere in the region, including Bonfire Shelter. By the beginning of
the Middle Archaic, modern bison were being hunted either opportunistically in small
cow-calf herds such as those that provided an occasional kill for inhabitants at Arenosa
Shelter or in the very large herds that occasionally entered the region from the Central
Plains, as Bone Bed 3 at Bonfire Shelter documents (Dibble and Lorrain 1968; Johnson
1987:Table 8.2).
The large subspecies of raccoon, Procyon lotor simus, was present in the region
during the Pleistocene and through much of the Holocene, occurring elsewhere in the
central and western portions of Texas (e.g. Wunderlich Cave, Reference Specimen
234

Number TMM-VP-40451-100) and in late Pleistocene deposits at the Washington Beach
locality in the northern Mexican state of Tamaulipas (Reference Specimen Number
TMM-VP-41378-1) (E. Lundelius, October, 1997:personal communication; Wright and
Lundelius 1963). Its occurrence at Arenosa Shelter as late as 2,000 years ago (stratum 5)
is in line with its extirpation from the Edwards Plateau and withdrawal to the north and
west into its current range. The replacement by a more gracile subspecies in this portion
of Texas occurred only within the past 1,000 years (Wright and Lundelius 1963).
The members of the cervid family remaining in the Lower Pecos region following
the Pleistocene included both the mule deer and the white-tailed deer. The Amistad area
has served as a zone of gradation between the mule deer-dominated Trans-Pecos region
to the west and the whitetail deer-dominated hill country of the Edwards Plateau to the
east for thousands of years (Jerry Cooke, May, 2004:personal communication). In this
zone, the two species are known to hybridize, producing offspring that blend the antler,
body size, and developmental characteristics of both. Genetically, the two species in this
region are now more similar than to each other than they are to more pure members of
either species (Ballinger, et al. 1992; Derr, et al. 1991). A known result of Holocene
evolution in the region’s cervid populations has been a gradual reduction in overall body
size through time, including antlers.
Habitat Niche Use
Use of specific habitat niches by prehistoric Lower Pecos inhabitants to procure
targeted prey species may be demonstrated by examining the habitat preferences of
species represented in the faunal sample from Arenosa Shelter. These species occupied a
variety of aquatic and terrestrial habitats that extended from the depths of the river
canyons to the heights of the upland plains beyond. Hunters and gatherers tapping these

235

sources of food understood a broad range of plant and animal communities and the
constituents that comprised their habitat niches.
In the river canyons, deep-water pools were present episodically between riffles
along the rivers between high-energy flood events.

The pools met the habitat

requirements for migrating diving ducks, such as the canvasback, scaup, or redhead that
prefer water depths of 20 – 30 feet. The deep pools also provided suitable habitats for
very large, mature members of the blue and flathead catfish species. The largest blue
catfish are actively predacious and seek out other smaller fish, including their own
species (Heavey 2004; Lundberg 1970). Other large fish, such as the shovelnose
sturgeon and large gar, were present in these relatively permanent features along the
rivers. The gar species present may have included the alligator gar, although it is not
found in this portion of the Rio Grande drainage now. Shallower water would have
harbored smaller catfish, the suckers, and what modern inhabitants of the region consider
to be gamefish, white bass, temperate bass, and drum. The aquatic turtles used by the
regions inhabitants would also have occupied this niche, as would dabbling ducks and
geese.
On the brushy vega-terraces between the canyon walls and the river, and also in
the lower side canyons, brushy vegetation with occasional stands of larger trees provided
the heavy cover niche preferred by a variety of mammal and bird species. Documented
species from these niches included cottontail rabbits, gray squirrels, white-tailed deer,
woodrats, cotton rats, gophers, bobwhite quail, turkeys, and some of the smaller raptorial
birds. Many of the carnivores would have either hunted or had their living quarters in
this niche.
The uplands were also used by human hunters ranging out from residence areas in
the canyons along the region’s rivers. The cliff-canyon wall niche was tapped by human
236

hunters for rock squirrels. The steep, rocky cliffs and upper canyon walls would have
also provided excellent roost areas for some of the larger raptorial birds. The upland hills
and upland flats were home to jackrabbits, pronghorn, and bison in the more open
grasslands, with white-tailed or mule deer in brushier areas.
Skinning, Butchering, and Carcass Processing
Evidence for carcass processing by the Lower Pecos inhabitants is more firmly
based on high quality data for cultural contexts that date within the past 3,000 years. The
higher frequency and better quality of surviving bone fragments with remaining evidence
of past processing behaviors insures better understanding of more recent phenomena, but
an insight into behavior can be hazarded that is based on current data for earlier periods.
The Paleoindian deposits in Arenosa Shelter contained little bone that was
unequivocally modified by humans upon which a statement about processing behaviors
may be based with existing records. None of the bone fragments from Paleoindian
context has been heat damaged. Few of the fragments show any cut marks related to
butchering or carcass dismemberment. A single bison radius from stratum 42 exhibits a
transverse cut mark that would allow the brachialis muscle to be separated. Three of the
bone fragments from this same stratum show evidence of dynamic fracturing that could
potentially be due to controlled bone breakage. Due to the deteriorated nature of the bone
fragments and paucity of cut marks, helical fractures, or other direct evidence, it is
unclear if such evidence is the result of secondary butchering of remains brought back to
a rock shelter habitation locale or scavenging of bone fresh enough to provide edible
marrow and raw material for tool manufacture. The bison bull from Feature 18 is
problematic, but may represent a partially butchered single kill from undated, later
Paleoindian context. It was accompanied by at least two small cobbles that may have

237

been used in butchering or carcass processing. This enigmatic feature will be discussed
more fully later in this chapter.
Elsewhere in the Lower Pecos, Bonfire Shelter provides a much clearer indication
of Paleoindian large mammal skinning, butchering, and carcass processing, with evidence
of large-scale bone breakage for marrow removal and bone grease production.
Butchering of Bonfire Shelter’s 120 bison from separate kill events of three mixed herds
of bulls, cows, and calves evident in Bone Bed 2 carefully removed the forequarters and
hindquarters by severing the connective tissues. Dessamae Lorrain (Dibble and Lorrain
1968; Lorrain 1965), the faunal analyst who worked with Dibble on the Bonfire Shelter
analysis, noted the systematic dismemberment, separation of the carcasses into resulting
butchering units, and then defleshing and bone breakage for marrow or bone grease. At
least with these larger kill events, skulls were smashed. Several boulders used as anvils
in bone breakage were documented in Bone Bed 2 and the underlying Bone Bed 1.
Evidence for Early Archaic carcass processing is non-existent at Arenosa Shelter.
The end result of processing is present in the form of burned artiodactyl and canid bones
found in cultural remains redeposited as a lag as a result of a high-energy flood event.
Lower Pecos Middle Archaic skinning, butchering, and carcass processing is
more clearly understandable, based on faunal remains from Arenosa Shelter. Large gar,
catfish, drum, and suckers were filleted in the process of being prepared for consumption.
Medium to large mammal remains from this context are burned or exhibit helical
fractures from bone breakage for marrow removal to use in tool making. At least one
coyote or domestic dog was processed in this fashion, although the details of the
preceding butchering process are unclear. Deer and pronghorns were systematically
dismembered, butchered, and defleshed, with lower limb bones being retained for
subsequent tool manufacture. While limited, carcass processing for smaller mammals
238

such as rabbits included cutting of muscles at the hip joint to facilitate remove the
hindquarters.
Late Archaic hunters and gatherers in the Lower Pecos are understood better
because of a higher frequency of faunal remains at sites such as Arenosa Shelter. The
processing of carcasses during this time period included careful skinning, dismembering,
and defleshing of medium and large animals, including artiodactyls, canids, and
jackrabbits. Medium to large animals were quartered before roasting. Butchering
evidence for larger rabbits is such that it indicates skinning prior to disarticulation and
dismemberment of the appendages, then defleshing of the dismembered carcass. The
evidence for cottontails is somewhat similar, although skinning behavior may not include
skinning the head out, and disarticulation of the shoulder and hip joints by cutting was
not practiced on these smaller rabbits. An alternative method used with the smaller
rabbits appears to have been severing the muscle masses on the proximal upper long
bones, with subsequent breaking of the long bone diaphysis itself. Burning damage on
long bone elements indicates exposure to heat with the meat still on the bone and
supports an interpretation of secondary butchering following completion of cooking.
Large fish continued to be filleted in processing, possibly to allow drying the
flesh. Heads of large catfish may have been also roasted following removal of the fillets.
Catfish were carefully handled, with the musculature controlling the locking mechanism
for the defensive pectoral and dorsal spines being disabled by cutting at the base of the
spines.
The sampled portions of the Arenosa Shelter faunal collection did not include any
bison remains in context from this portion of the Late Archaic. However, bison were
apparently more numerous in the area during the Late Archaic and were preyed upon by
the region’s inhabitants. Bone Bed 3 at Bonfire Shelter is composed of the remains of at
239

least one, if not several, cool season kills of relatively large mixed herds of modern bison
that occurred within a short period of time (Dibble and Lorrain 1968; Lorrain 1965). The
carcass processing for these very large herbivores was less systematic than that used
during the Paleoindian period, possibly due to the massive amount of work necessary to
process hundreds of carcasses in a short amount of time. Another reason may be that
only primary butchering remains were found in the site. In any case, after skinning of the
bison, their feet and hooves were cut off and discarded intact, then the limbs were
removed not by cutting the connective tissues, but by smashing through the femur and
humerus with chopping tools or cobbles. Heads were removed and the braincases of the
skulls were smashed to remove the brains. The mandibles were also removed to access
the tongues and marrow cavities in the mandibles themselves.
In the Terminal Late Archaic, the underlying skinning, butchering, and carcass
processing methods used earlier in the Late Archaic continued, although there is more
evidence for skinning of small to medium-sized mammalian carnivores, excluding
skunks. The head areas received careful attention, in a manner that would allow the hide
to be removed intact from the braincase, around the eyes, and from the snout. The
patterning of skinning damage on the skulls indicates removal of the cartilage supporting
external portions of the ear with the hide.
The Late Prehistoric – Historic evidence for skinning, butchering, and carcass
processing is similar to earlier periods, with a continuation of secondary butchering of
rabbits following cooking. The limbs of foxes and similarly sized animals were
dismembered following being skinned. Fish continue to be cooked, with catfish
defensive spines being specially treated as they have been since the Late Archaic. No
clear evidence is present in the sample for continued filleting of fish. Artiodactyl
carcasses continue to be defleshed with fat sources within the bone being tapped
240

following fragmentation of the bone. Lower limb bones were treated in a similar manner
to the upper limb bones, although care may have been taken to control the extent of
breakage to preserve sufficient raw material for bone tool manufacture. The occasional
bison that appears is treated in like manner, as may be the European domestic stock that
becomes available within the past 300 years.
Special Topics--Evidence for Carnivore Modification
Many of the specimens analyzed for the current research exhibited signs of
carnivore modification (cf. Schmitt and Juell 1994). The degree and extent of carnivore
modifications in both collections is variable, but extensive ravaging of individual
specimens is present. Almost twenty per cent of the faunal collection sample exhibited
carnivore damage. Carnivore modification of bone is evident throughout the stratigraphic
column at Arenosa Shelter, from a few bison fragments from Paleoindian context in
stratum 42 to domestic sheep from Historic context in the upper-most strata.
Signs of carnivore modification vary from a few small tooth marks, most likely by
small canids that may have included the domestic dog, to pervasive modification of the
surfaces and edges of individual bone fragments, ornaments, or tools by deep tooth
marks. In some cases, especially with smaller mammal remains or small fragments of
large mammal remains, surfaces of element or artifact fragments have been shallowly
pitted by the digestive acids of carnivores. Also present with rabbits and other smaller
mammal remains are wholesale shearing of portions of elements or helical fracturing, for
example the mandibles, scapulas, pelves, and long bones, in patterns documented to
occur with avian or terrestrial predators. These particular patterns typically remove the
diaphysis portion of long bones, leaving the proximal or distal epiphyses. Tooth
perforations are also present in thinner segments of smaller mammal bones, included the
calcaneum of jackrabbits. Crushing of portions of large mammal bones, scalloping of
241

fragment edges, and certain types of edge polish on fractures are also present that round
out indications of carnivore damage to almost 1,100 items in the faunal collection
sample.
BONE MODIFICATION AT ARENOSA SHELTER
Deliberate modification of animal bone by prehistoric residents in the Lower
Pecos was done for at least two purposes, only one of which resulted in a technological
outcome.

Subsistence modifications to bone resulted in damage from skinning,

butchering, or fat removal activities. In many cases, residual indicators of these primary
activities lingered when bone fragments resulting from subsistence activities were reused
for a technological purpose. This was especially true of tools or ornaments that involved
minimal technological alteration in their manufacturing process, such as the expedient
tools or minimally modified long bone bead forms documented in the Arenosa Shelter
archaeological record.
The manufacturing process for more formalized implements and ornaments that
involved extensive surface modification or reshaping was a second purpose for which
Lower Pecos residents deliberately modified bone. Although this manufacturing process
emanated from subsistence activities used mainly to secure foodstuffs, skins, feathers,
connective tissue, and other animal materials for sustenance or other day-to-day needs of
food, clothing, or shelter, its end results were not directly tied to subsistence activities.
Exhibiting a considerable time depth, the process results added to the products
immediately available for use or supplied means of producing additional items needed by
the indigenous residents of the canyon lands of the Lower Pecos.
Procurement of Raw Material for Bone Technology
Based on the current research, raw material for both expedient and more formal
implements and ornaments were obtained from subsistence activities practiced by Lower
242

Pecos residents during the Middle Archaic to Historic – Late Prehistoric period. That
being said, apparently not all bone residual from subsistence activities was suitable for all
uses or forms that were considered by the indigenous crafters of implements and
ornaments in the Lower Pecos.
Surviving fragmentary implements and ornaments, their preforms, and
manufacturing byproducts sampled from the Arenosa Shelter artifact collection reveal
patterns of potential raw material preferences by Lower Pecos residents in choices of raw
material for particular forms of artifact being manufactured. Fragmentary implements or
manufacturing byproducts distinguished during analysis of the faunal collection sample
corroborate this supposition.
Decorated and undecorated beads were primarily manufactured from long bones
of small to medium-sized mammals that included rabbits and carnivores, all hunted for
other purposes. Except for occasional aberrancies, such as beads manufactured from deer
antler or phalange segments, this remained true throughout the Middle Archaic to Late
Archaic. Long bones from medium to large birds also formed the basis of undecorated
bead production. Hawks, turkeys, and aquatic birds were most often chosen for bone
bead production, possibly due to the size, structure, and smoothness of the raw material
itself.
Implement raw materials were primarily chosen from the ample supplies of
skeletal material that resulted from subsistence hunting of deer-sized artiodactyls. Based
on the frequencies of artiodactyl-based forms and their manufacturing byproducts in the
Arenosa Shelter bone artifact collection sample, this choice by Lower Pecos residents
was true whether those implements were to be expediently crafted for short-term use or
more formally manufactured for more extensive use over a longer period of time.

243

Most tools were manufactured from artiodactyl long bone, quite often the
metapodials.

Specific forms of implements appear to have required use of the

metacarpal, others the metatarsal. It is not possible to determine whether the choice of
artiodactyl metapodials for specific tool forms was based only on the relative availability
of this specific raw material.

An alternative consideration might be whether its

underlying physical characteristics could influence how trouble-free it was to use as a
raw material in implement manufacture or how durable the material might be in use.
Manufacture of other specific formal tool forms used the ribs and long bones of
artiodactyls or segments of deer antler. Billets used in flint knapping were manufactured
from antler beam segments. Antler pressure flakers used tine tip segments that had
modifications to their tips. Long bones from medium to large mammals were also
occasionally retained for use as tool material, although its use was much less frequent
than that of artiodactyls. Bony spines from fish, most often the pectoral spines of catfish,
were used for specific narrow implement forms.

These implements required a lesser

amount of work to fashion into final form versus the larger and more formalized tools
manufactured from artiodactyl metapodials.

Compared with the expedient tools

fashioned from butchering waste, the catfish spine implements were intermediate in
manufacturing complexity and comparable to a few of the simpler artiodactyl-based tool
forms that could be easily made using tool manufacturing debitage, rib fragments, or
other long bone fragments left from subsistence activities. Expedient tools used
artiodactyl long bone fragments remaining from subsistence activities, often the helically
fractured remnants that were the byproducts of bone marrow removal. Some exhibited
utilization of an un-worked edge, others had minimal modification to shape or re-sharpen
a working edge.

244

Techniques of Manufacture for Bone Artifacts
Due to less complexity, the manufacturing techniques applicable for bone
ornaments in the Lower Pecos will be discussed before that for bone implements.
Undecorated bone ornament forms at Arenosa Shelter are documented from Middle
Archaic upward through the Historic – Late Prehistoric contexts. Decorated bone
ornaments are a Late Archaic to Historic – Late Prehistoric phenomenon. As all
documented decorated bone ornaments in the Lower Pecos are beads and the basic
techniques of manufacture for most undecorated and decorated bone beads were similar,
with decoration adding a finishing step, manufacture of decorated beads will be discussed
as additional variants of the manufacturing process for undecorated bone beads.
Manufacturing of undecorated bead forms in the Lower Pecos Archaic, Late
Prehistoric, and Historic periods was a continuum that included at least three potential
shaping and smoothing steps prior to bead use. The overall manufacturing process for
undecorated beads centers on the transformation of diaphyses of tubular skeletal elements
into finished ornaments. A key point in this process is the decision to use the portions of
diaphyses that contain the medullary cavity. The process for manufacturing undecorated
bone beads is portrayed schematically in Figure 31.

245

Figure 31: Schematic of Manufacturing Process for Undecorated Bone Bead Forms in
Lower Pecos.
In a linear fashion, the steps involved in manufacturing of most undecorated bead
forms was:
1) selection of a suitable long bone or metatarsal from a small to medium-sized
mammal or medium to large-sized bird;
2) longitudinal scraping to remove the thin periosteum layer of connective tissue
from the surface of the bone and to begin shaping the surface of the bone;
3) grinding to final shape;
246

4) circumferential cutting of annular grooves to allow snapping off unneeded
portions of element, including the epiphyses, as debitage;
5) final smoothing of fresh cut surfaces on ends and other areas by grinding or
polishing, as needed.

Where it was fully implemented, variations in the outcome of the manufacturing
process were related to decisions concerning the desired overall shape of finished
undecorated beads. This resulted in at least six different groups of beads defined
analytically on length vs. width characteristics. Other variations were evident in a
number of cases where a) raw material choice did not include long bones or metatarsals
of birds or small to medium mammals, b) steps were restricted in the extent to which they
were implemented on individual beads, c) steps were sequenced differently, or d) steps
were not used at all. If bone tubes are considered to be preforms for beads, they exhibit
implementation of only steps 1 and 4.
The first of these variations allows discussion of beads that were manufactured
from artiodactyl bony elements, either phalanges or deer antler segments. Rare in the
bone artifact collections from Arenosa Shelter were several undecorated beads
manufactured from deer or pronghorn. The process of fashioning beads from segments
of mule, white-tailed, or hybrid deer antler involved a choice of tine segments that had
cancellous bone interiors. Seasonally, white-tailed deer and mule deer differ on the
presence of this characteristic (Jerry Cooke, September, 1998:personal communication).
White-tailed deer have this condition during the summer growth season for their antlers,
but it disappears as the antlers complete their growth and harden out. The condition is
present during the entire time that antlers grow and are in place on mule deer.

247

In creating beads using antler segments with cancellous interiors, the
manufacturing process removed tine tips from the beam by grooving and snapping before
longitudinal scraping was applied to the medial and proximal portions of the bead to
smooth and shape them. The tip was then ground to a slightly rounded shape that
penetrated the compact bony exterior of the tip. The cancellous interior of the antler was
hollowed out, although it is unclear what means were used to accomplish this step. The
process resulted in a tapered tubular bead.
A similar process that used bone instead of antler was also used to fashion tapered
tubular beads from artiodactyl phalanges during the Terminal Late Archaic. The
manufacturing steps involved longitudinal scraping of the element to remove the
periosteum layer and begin shaping of the body of the bead prior to grooving and
snapping away of the epiphyses as debitage. Final grinding smoothed and shaped the
beads to a more slightly rounded form.
Restriction of the extent and intensity of application of manufacturing steps
partially forms the basis of potential variation in undecorated bead forms. Limiting the
extent to which grinding or scraping steps are applied alters the final shape and
smoothness of the undecorated bead form. Variation is noted in the Arenosa Shelter
analysis sample where grinding is present on ends only, on one end and in the middle, or
other combinations. Similarly, scraping is sometimes present only on part of an observed
bead.
Another variation in implementing the manufacturing process forms a continuum
with the just-discussed partial presence or absence of manufacturing steps. This variation
involves a re-sequencing of the steps involved and potentially deletion of steps
altogether. Re-sequencing of the steps may be involved in crafting antler beads during
the Late Archaic. Tip grinding preceding removal of the cancellous interior rather than
248

as a final step in manufacture. In some cases, longitudinal scraping is not used to remove
the periosteum or to initially smooth bead forms. In other cases, grinding does not appear
to have followed the longitudinal scraping step or was used only on ends.
The addition of relatively simple decorative elements to bone beads in the Lower
Pecos Terminal Late Archaic and Historic – Late Prehistoric draws upon techniques that
are already in use in their manufacturing sequence. These involve cutting, typically
termed incising, of additional annular grooves along the length of the bead body. The
decorative grooves are more shallowly incised than the terminal groove and snap
fractures that define the ends of the bead. At least two forms of incised beads are
presently defined, differentiated on the basis of wall thickness. While not typical,
manufacture of incised beads may also involve additional smoothing steps using
grinding, especially on larger beads fashioned from thicker elements that allow for
incising of deeper decorative grooves. A final decorative bead form present in the
Arenosa Shelter bone artifact collection sample is a small, barrel-shaped, faceted bead
created from jackrabbit foreleg or hawk wing elements. Used in the Late Archaic and
Terminal Late Archaic, the manufacturing process for this form elaborates on the process
used for similarly sized undecorated beads by the use of grinding to create multiple facets
around the circumference of the bead body. The technique of creating small bevels is
also used in the manufacturing of implements and will be discussed further when that
process is taken up. Figure 32 schematically portrays the manufacturing process for
incised and faceted bead forms.

249

Figure 32: Schematic of Manufacturing Process for Decorated Bone Bead Forms in
Lower Pecos.
At least two separate manufacturing processes are evident for implements in the
Lower Pecos during the Archaic that vary considerably on formality of procedures. An
250

informal manufacturing process is present and used for quick crafting of simple tools
apparently intended for short-term use. These expediently made tools were relied on for
a variety of tasks from butchering and hide working to processing of the region’s vast
array of silica-rich plants. A second manufacturing process for more formal tool is more
involved and the tools produced by it saw much more extensive use. At least some tools
exhibit characteristics of both processes and will be discussed as a potential variant.
As its raw material, expedient tool manufacture utilizes helically fractured
butchering waste from medium to large mammals, primarily artiodactyls. Following
selection of a suitable fragment, working edges are shaped using scraping or hardhammer percussion flaking. In some cases, existing edges of helical fractures are initially
utilized with no further modification until resharpening is necessary. At that point, the
dulled edges are resharpened using hard-hammer percussion flaking.
Formal implement manufacture is also based on subsistence activity byproducts
that are primarily from artiodactyls, although fish and carnivore remains are also present.
Most implements use as their raw material a metapodial from a deer or pronghorn-sized
artiodactyl. Few of these metapodials are subjected to marrow removal procedures as
part of subsistence activities involved in butchering. Specific choices appear to be
involved in raw material choice for various implement forms. Artiodactyl metacarpals
are used for certain forms and metatarsals are used for others. Additional implement
forms use catfish pectoral spines, deer antler segments, and indeterminate elements from
medium to large-sized mammals.
Implement manufacture uses some of the techniques that are also used in
ornament manufacture, including in step-wise fashion:
1) selection of suitable fish bony spine or long bone from medium to large
mammal;
251

2) cutting of grooves and snapping to separate the implement blank from
debitage;
3) scraping to remove the periosteum and to begin initial shaping of the
implement blank;
4) grinding to smooth and further shape the implement blank;
5) polishing, as needed, to finish implement.
Variations in this process and its outcome are related to decisions concerning
overall shape of finished tool, its intended use, and the implement’s current stage in its
use-life. At least 23 implement forms are defined analytically on the basis of physical
characteristics that include length, width, thickness, tip form and cross section, and
manufacturing techniques. As with ornaments, variations are evident where a) raw
material choice did not include artiodactyl metapodials, deer antler, catfish spines, or deer
ulna, b) steps were restricted in the extent to which that they were, c) steps were sequence
differently, or d) steps were not used at all.
As long implement forms based on artiodactyl metapodials form the bulk of the
tools from the Lower Pecos, at least as viewed through the lens of the Arenosa Shelter
bone artifact collection sample, variability in their manufacturing techniques will be
discussed first. Forms based on artiodactyl metacarpals include awl/bodkins, bodkins,
bodkin/perforators, and spatulate/bodkins. The primary difference between these
implement forms is in the tip cross-section and profile. Spatulate/bodkins have a
generally oval distal cross section and may have a tip profile that varies from rounded to
sharp. Other metacarpal-based forms vary, with bodkin/perforators also having a
tapering oval cross section with a long, narrow, sharply tapered tip profile. The
awl/bodkin and bodkins are similar to the spatulate/bodkin, but differ in length to width
ration as their overall length differs.
252

The process of manufacturing these metacarpal-based tools differs from that used
for those used for artiodactyl metatarsal-based tools in the portion of the metapodial
isolated as an implement blank. At least two techniques may be used to separate blanks
from the original skeletal element. Grooving and snapping is used to separate the
debitage from the distal epiphysis and diaphysis intended for production of these tools.
Alternatively, chopping to achieve the same end is evident on some specimens. The
medial and distal portion of the blank consists of posterior aspect of the metacarpal
diaphysis. Following initial shaping of the blank by longitudinal scraping, distal and
medial portions of the tool are ground to their final profile and U-shaped to oval or
circular cross-section. Additional grinding occurs on the proximal end where anatomical
features including the lateral condyles and intra-condylar groove are smoothed. In some
cases, smoothing occurs to such an extent that all compact bone is removed and the
underlying cancellous bone is exposed.
Metatarsal-based tools generally fall within the spatulate form. Derivatives of this
form, including the narrow spatulate, spatulate/perforator, and creaser spatulate, are
manufactured from artiodactyl long bone fragments identifiable as metapodial, but not
specifically as metatarsal or metacarpal due to the absence of appropriate anatomical
features. Other spatulates use the ulna or helically fractured butchering waste as a raw
material that is identifiable as other artiodactyl long bones because of overall shape, size,
cross section, and anatomical features present. Metatarsal-based implements retain
anatomical features that allow identification of the proximal portion of this element.
Blank preparation for these tools more typically uses groove and snap fracturing
than chopping to longitudinally section the metapodial or metatarsal. The metapodials
are sectioned in half by grooving and snapping on anterior and posterior aspects, with at
least one of the linear groove and snap fractures utilizing the anatomical medial groove
253

on the element’s cranial aspect. Some tools are obviously prepared by quartering the
metatarsal, whether during the initial blank preparation or during subsequent refitting or
rejuvenation of longitudinally broken tools. Other tools have the proximal portions
modified by a transverse groove and snap fracture to create a straight to slightly curved
proximal margin. Additional shaping steps are similar to those used for metacarpal-based
tools including variations where shaping and smoothing obviously only use longitudinal
scraping and delete the following grinding step.
Incised spatulates are present, but rare, in Middle Archaic to Historic – Late
Prehistoric context and are fashioned from wide, relatively flat portions of the lateral and
medial aspects of metapodials.

Their manufacture is similar to other spatulates,

especially those that have the proximal articular surfaces removed by grooving and
snapping, prior to incising of cross-hatched, chevron, or parallel line decorations across
the proximal end or along proximal lateral margins. Due to subsequent use, the
decorations appear to have smoothed.
Ulna spatulates from Terminal Late Archaic context are prepared by helically
fracturing the diaphysis of the element to remove the distal half, leaving the proximal
portion as the implement blank. Longitudinal grooving under the lunar notch may
modify the tool blank, and then the tip section is shaped by longitudinal scraping to
produce the required cross section and profile. Grinding may also be used to smooth the
distal portions of the implement.
The distally notched spatulate is a special case that occurs in Middle Archaic
context. While the overall tool form is variable because it appears to utilize helically
fractured butchering waste as its raw material, a specific modification appears in each
case. The distal portion of the implement exhibits a bifurcation of up to 10 mm that is
scraped into the surface of the bone, with the resulting tips having a blunted profile and
254

oval cross section. The tips are relatively equivalent in length. A similar deep
bifurcation is involved in creation of potential bone fish hook preforms during the Middle
Archaic that have tips of dissimilar lengths. These implements are similar in technology
to those reported by Harrell (1983) in Central Texas.
Perforators are present in Middle Archaic to Terminal Late Archaic contexts and
typically utilize a long narrow segment of artiodactyl metapodial or other long bone as a
blank. In some cases, the original element is identifiable as a metatarsal due to retention
of part of the proximal articulation. Grooving and snapping is used to create the long,
narrow blank, occasionally by refitting of a larger, wider tool that was broken. An
occasional use of a suitably robust dorsal or pectoral spine from a drum or large sucker is
also documented from similar context. The narrower tip section of this tool form is
shaped by scraping and smoothed by grinding prior to use.
Catfish spine spatulates and perforators are special implements found in Terminal
Late Archaic context. These forms use pectoral spines from medium to large catfish as
an implement blank that needs only minimal additional work to create a finished tool. In
some cases, the diaphysis of the spine is longitudinally scraped, especially on cranial and
caudal aspects to remove the teeth that are present. On more robust specimens, the tip of
the diaphysis is then shaped using scraping. Grinding is the final shaping and smoothing
technique used to create the desired tip profile and cross section.
Needles use as their basis either narrow skeletal elements, such as the ulna of an
artiodactyl or medium to large canid, or an artiodactyl long bone. Blank preparation of
these Terminal Late Archaic implements is by grooving and snapping the element
longitudinally where necessary to achieve a long narrow shape. The distal portion of the
resulting blank may be then scraped and ground to remove the periosteum layer and to
shape and smooth its profile and cross section.
255

Pressure flaking tools of bone are similar in manufacturing process to other long,
narrow implement forms, although the exact blank preparation method is unknown.
Although very rare in Terminal Late Archaic and Historic – Late Prehistoric context,
these implements have rounded tip section profile and cross section shaped by scraping
and smoothed further by grinding.
Other appendicular skeletal elements from artiodactyls form the basis of
implement forms involved in hide working in Middle Archaic and Terminal Late Archaic
contexts. Raw materials for the beamer and beamer/flesher forms are obtained from
portions of the scapula, rib, and indeterminate bone with blank preparation by grooving
and snapping, helical fracturing, and other means. Grinding or bifacial flaking to a final
form shaped the blanks.
The rib tool form is another Terminal Late Archaic form. Its blank was grooved
and snapped from distal segments of artiodactyl ribs prior to the working edge being
scraped to final shape.
A final artiodactyl metatarsal-based implement form has spatulate manufacturing
debitage as its raw material. The beveled and faceted woodworking form is fashioned
from a blank utilizing cast-off spatulate manufacturing debitage that has a tip section
scraped to shape. Final smoothing and profiling on the distal tip is by grinding of
multiple facets.
To complete the discussion of implement form manufacturing techniques, another
enigmatic Terminal Late Archaic form must be discussed, the wedge. This relatively flat
form has a triangular profile that exhibits three step-wise grooves between its base and
apex. Fashioned from fragmentary artiodactyl phalanges and other relatively flat bone
fragments, the wedge blank is prepared by grooving and snapping. Subsequent shaping
is by transverse grooving, scraping, and grinding to the final profile and cross section.

Function of Bone Technology in Tool Kit and in Hunting/Fishing System
Fortuitous preservation conditions allow researchers to investigate problems using
perishable materials from Lower Pecos archaeological sites including Arenosa Shelter.
Such is the case with the current research. The function of bone technology in the
prehistoric tool kit and system for hunting and fishing may be addressed using bone
fragments from Arenosa Shelter.
The archaeological record in the upper strata at Arenosa Shelter preserves a
wealth of data about the prehistoric technological role of bone.

The prehistoric

inhabitants of the Lower Pecos fit bone technology into a broader technological system to
exploit the region’s varied resources.
Bone and antler tools were incorporated directly into the manufacture of tools
from other materials in the Lower Pecos. As such, the prehistoric technologist was able
to craft lithic implements using greater precision necessary in soft hammer percussion
and pressure flaking techniques.
Implements made from bone and antler also assisted directly in the gathering,
processing, and manufacturing of plant fiber-based textiles and in the processing of wood
to craft small items. At least some of the Arenosa Shelter bone artifact forms represent
implements that were used directly in collecting tree bark or fiber from the region’s
desert succulent plants. Spatulate forms aided in processing desert succulent leaves,
allowing fiber to be stripped and separated for use in cordage and textiles. Two forms
were used in woodworking to split and shape small pieces of wood for other uses.
Distally notched or bifurcated spatulate forms may have had a role in textile manufacture,
including netting. The presence of long sections of netting that used both cordage and
small wooden supports is documented from bundled specimens recovered from the
259

Lower Pecos’s dry caves and rock shelters (Schuetz 1961, Shafer 1986). While an exact
use for these long nets is not known, possible uses in game drives or in fishing are within
reason and known from other areas in the arid lands of the American Southwest. Other
smaller nets have been interpreted to be much the same as modern cast nets that are
thrown to envelop prey.
Once the prehistoric inhabitants of the Lower Pecos caught small and large game
animals, their remains entered the subsistence economy for human consumption and,
potentially, byproducts from that consumption entered the technological system. In
processing game animals for consumption, their skins were removed for later use, meat
was cut from the carcasses to be eaten immediately or preserved for future consumption,
and sinews and other connective tissues were separated for use where needed. Finally,
fat sources contained in the skeletal elements themselves were tapped for human
consumption and recovered. The remnant bone fragments were left available for other
uses that included raw materials for technological use.
The bone implements fashioned by the region’s prehistoric inhabitants definitely
functioned within this process of transforming the products represented by each animal
into a form usable to humans. Informally or expediently made forms necessary to assist
in butchering of fish or game animal carcasses in Lower Pecos prehistory are documented
in implements present in the Arenosa Shelter artifact collection. Other informally or
expediently fashioned forms were used in processing skins from those animals, as were
more formally manufactured forms. Formally manufactured spatulate forms functioned
in working of hides, whether freshly obtained and retaining their fur, freshly defleshed, or
dried. Some of these spatulates were used to perforate hides to be sewn together. At
least some of the spatulates were used in working with sinews from animal carcasses

260

obtained by area hunters, possibly to be used in sewing or other uses as a parallel to plant
fiber cordage.
Finally, the role of ornaments, bone tubes, and decorated implements in the
region’s hunting and fishing system may be at least partially addressed. Decorated
spatulate-form implements are similar in manufacture to undecorated forms, but incised
linear motifs may have a connection with the region’s abundant and long-lived rock art
tradition. Although conjectural, ornaments such as beads may have functioned in the
hunting and fishing system as markers of group identity or other signifiers in the same
fashion as rock art (Boyd 2003). Bone tubes are enigmatic and apparently may have
functioned at least partially in a ritual role.
Provisional Interpretation of Uses
Based on the fore-going technological and use-wear analysis of the Arenosa
Shelter bone artifact collection sample, a provisional interpretation of uses for its contents
may put forth at this point. Ornaments will be discussed first because less complexity is
involved in doing so. The 40 bead forms identified in the sample differ primarily in
morphology and may be separated into four main groups on the basis of form,
manufacturing techniques, and raw material. The groups are large beads based on
artiodactyl antler tines and phalanges, small to medium decorated beads, small to large
undecorated beads manufactured from bird bone, and small to large undecorated beads
manufactured from small to medium-sized mammals. Based on the use-wear analyses
for these beads that was presented in Chapter 6, the provisional interpretation of their
function was as surface decorations for plant fiber-based textiles, hides used as clothing
or containers, and as stand-alone strands of ornaments.
A provisional interpretation of function for implement forms is, by necessity,
much more complex due to varied morphology of the forms and documented use-wear
261

signatures.

Expedient implement forms are varied in morphology and use, but

provisionally are identified as being used for primary and secondary butchering, hide
working of hides with attached hair, and plant fiber processing.
More formalized implements are also widely varied in morphology and
documented use-wear. Provisional uses for implements fashioned from antler include
pressure flaking and soft-hammer percussion techniques in flint knapping, wood working,
and working of both dry hides and hides with attached hair. The following discussion of
provisional interpretation of functions for formalized bone implements from the Lower
Pecos follows the pattern of the fore-going discussion of their manufacturing techniques
that recognized the variability in form and raw material sources. Artiodactyl metacarpalbased implement forms that include the awl/bodkins, bodkins, bodkin/perforators, and
spatulate/bodkins vary in their uses, but provisionally were used in procurement and
processing of silica-rich plant fibers from desert succulents and tree bark, textile
manufacturing, or working of dry hides or hides with attached hair.
Spatulate implements are provisionally are identified as being used in many uses.
These included procurement and processing of silica-rich plant fibers from desert
succulents and tree bark, textile or cordage manufacturing, wood boring in soft woods,
working of hides that include fresh, dry, or hides with attached hair, sinew dressing,
sewing, or pressure flaking in flint knapping. Artiodactyl metatarsal, metapodial, or long
bones were used to manufacture spatulates and related forms, including needles and
perforators. Although they use considerably different raw materials, catfish spine-based
spatulate or perforator forms have similar functions as those made from artiodactyl
elements and are provisionally identified as being used in production of textiles, and
working of fresh or dry hides. Distally notched spatulates function as bark strippers,
sinew dressers, or hide dressers. Rib tools were used for woodworking, most likely with
262

the region’s softer woods rather than hard woods such as oak or pecan. Beamers and
fleshers made from indeterminate bone or rib fragments have use wear related to meat or
fresh hides and their function is provisionally identified as hide-dressing.
Although using similar manufacturing techniques to distally notched spatulates,
the function of the more deeply bifurcated longitudinally split specimen in the sample is
provisionally identified as a fish hook preform due to its similarity to like items identified
by Harrell (1983) in Central Texas. Final provisional function assignments are for the
spatulate manufacturing debitage that has been modified with a beveled and faceted tip
section and a small wedge-shaped form. Each of these has use wear consistent with
woodworking tools. The beveled and faceted form is provisionally identified as a bark
stripper. The two wedge-shaped implements are enigmatic, but provisionally identified
as wood working tool with an unknown specific function.
SPECIAL TOPICS
Two special topics will complete the discussion of the current research. Within
the Arenosa Shelter faunal collections, two unique lines of evidence were happened upon
during the research that afforded the author to investigate and more fully understand
subsistence behaviors used by the prehistoric people’s who occupied the Lower Pecos
region for so long. Both of these lines of evidence center on decisions made by the
prehistoric residents about how fauna was treated during carcass processing that
processed the successful outcome of a hunting or trapping endeavor. The clearer, more
recent line of evidence will be discussed first. The final line of evidence is from
Paleoindian context and is more enigmatic.
Evidence of Caping, a Specialized Skinning Behavior
While the author analyzed specimens from the faunal collection included in the
current research, certain patterns emerged among the remains of mammalian carnivores
263

present in the sample. Among the 110 fragments of foxes, dogs, coyotes, raccoons,
ringtails, badgers, skunks, and possibly larger carnivores, skinning damage was observed
on remains of all species except the skunks. Among these remains modified by
prehistoric Lower Pecos hunters and gatherers, 35 fragments represented cranium or
mandible remains. Twenty-seven of these cranial or mandibular fragments were from
Terminal Late Archaic context in strata 3 – 5. Of this group of carnivore specimens,
eight exhibited skinning damage. The intra-species similarity was striking in the
patterning of cutmarks on the mandible—transversely along its ventral margin, transverse
chopping on the ventral margin in the vicinity of the P 2 to M 2 , and cutmarks adjacent to
the condylar fossa. Similar patterning of cutmarks was also noted on skull elements.
Cutmarks on the cranium were placed between the tooth row and infraorbital foramen or
zygomatic arch, along the supraorbital arch and temporal line, along the margins of the
orbits, and the edges of the infraorbital canal (see Figure 34).
Shallow cutmarks on the skull fragments are in positions to allow separation of
hide from the cranium itself. Of interest is the location of cutmarks posterior and medial
to orbits that would allow the pinna or auricula (external portions of ear) would be
removed with the skin. The deep cut marks or chop marks on the ventral margin of the
mandible in the vicinity of the P 2 to M2 teeth do not represent disarticulation damage, nor
are they similar to other more faint cutmarks on the mandibles and crania. They are,
however, in a position directly ventral to the base of the muzzle and removed the anterior
portions of mandible. None of these patterned cutmarks could be considered to represent
disarticulation damage except for the cutmarks on one of the mandible specimens in the
vicinity of the temporomandibular articulation.

Carnivore Cranial and Mandibular Materials from the Terminal Late Archaic at Arenosa
Shelter.

265

Taken together, these three rather distinctive sets of cut and chop marks represent
a single pattern of damage related to a specific skinning behavior. Other lines of
evidence from the dry rock shelters and caves of the Lower Pecos and adjacent regions
are informative at this point. The Lower Pecos and Trans-Pecos collections of the Texas
Archeological Research Laboratory and the Witte Museum both contain skins of
carnivores that include the intact features of the face, including ears and muzzles (D.
Creel, January, 1998:personal communication).
Used in conjunction with the current analysis, these additional lines of evidence
point to a step in skinning and carcass handling that requires a specific decision to
include the complete face of the animal being skinned. This type of skinning is termed
caping (Binford 1978:152; Field-N-Water.com 2004; Leach 2004; World Class Outdoors
2004).

The osteological evidence from Arenosa Shelter reveals previously

undocumented information about how pelts from small to medium-sized carnivores were
removed with intact facial features. While not directly reported from the Lower Pecos
region to date, ethnographic and archeological information from the Plains region records
the results of a practice of small mammals and birds being similarly skinned to leave
facial features intact. Importantly for potential interpretation of uses of similar pelts in
the Lower Pecos region, pelts of small carnivores from the Plains were stuffed and
prepared for use as medicine bundles, personal fetishes, and ceremonial adornments
(Ubelaker and Wedel 1975).
The abundant Lower Pecos rock art has numerous representative depictions of
carnivores, including felids and canids (Boyd 2003:95-105). Importantly, Campbell
(1958:60) recognized similarities between anthropomorphic depictions in Pecos Riverstyle rock art and paraphernalia worn by Historic period mescal bean cult practitioners.
These similarities included fox skins wrapped around the waist of cult members and
266

draped over their arms (Boyd 2003:89). Mescal beans, as seeds of the Texas mountain
laurel (Sophora secundiflora) shrub are known, have been recovered from Archaic to
Historic contexts in dry caves in the region, including Hinds Cave, Eagle Cave, Fate Bell
Shelter, Coontail Spin, and Zopilote Cave (Boyd 2003:84-95).
Among hallucinogenic plant remains from the region are peyote and Datura sp.
Boyd (2003) notes that both are associated with shamanism throughout Mexico and the
American Southwest. Datura seeds were found in Hinds Cave in Middle Archaic context
approximately 4,900 years ago (Dering 1979).

Boyd and Dering (1996) identify the

Middle Archaic Pecos River-style rock art’s shaman-held staff motif as having a Datura
seed at its distal end. The frequency of association between Lower Pecos Datura and
canid rock art motifs increases with the appearance of the Red Linear-style during the
Late Prehistoric (Boyd 2003:100).
The physiological effects of low dosages of Datura that ethnographers
documented as producing behaviors remarkably similar to canid predators are detailed by
Boyd (2003:95-99). This behavioral similarity underlies an accompanying belief in
practitioners of lycanthrophy or human transformation into canid predators. The belief is
often reinforced by tactile suggestions from animal skins worn by the person undergoing
the drug-induced transformation (Boyd 2003:97-99). The long recognized connection
between ethnographically documented shamanistic practice and Lower Pecos rock art is
strengthened by the current study’s results with its evidence for caping behaviors to
produce predator skins that could be used as ritualistic paraphernalia.
Analysis, Interpretation, and Discussion of Feature 18 -- Paleoindian Bone Stacking
or Just Plain Bull?
The carcass of a late Pleistocene bison is the final point to be discussed. Resting
within the alluvial silts of stratum 40 in Pit D (N205/W167 unit) and beneath the inner
267

edge of the “mother rock”, these remains were designated as Feature 18 when initially
discovered in 1967. In his field notes, Dibble (n.d.) fully believed the carcass to be
affected by humans, although no obvious cultural associations, such as chert tools or
debitage were found during the excavations. The remains also had no obvious butchering
damage. Due to an impending hurricane, Feature 18 was reburied and excavated during
the 1968 final field season. Although it was mapped, the excavators were not able to
recover the exposed feature in its entirety due to the fragile nature of the water-saturated
sediments and bone fragments. Two matrix blocks containing portions of the skull and
four smaller groups of bone fragments were consolidated, jacketed, and removed for
future analysis.
Following thorough museum preparation during the current research, the feature
was analyzed over 30 years after its recovery from the site. Through careful laboratory
examination, it was verified that the bone was water saturated at the time that the original
consolidant was applied. The bone’s internal moisture effectively prevented penetration
of Gelva into the silty matrix or bone surface, resulting in a thin surface coating of
consolidant on the bone and attached silty matrix. In the process of cleaning, this surface
coating was carefully removed. This action revealed the surface of individual bone
fragments for the first time, allowing their contents, integrity, and potential cultural
modification to be assessed. In addition, the two jacketed matrix blocks were excavated
under laboratory conditions. Concurrent analysis of field photographs allowed the author
to determine that some of the lots containing appendicular bone included several
elements and that the matrix blocks containing the skull had been removed in an
anatomically flipped position.

268

Six lots of bone were field-cataloged upon their removal from the excavation unit
and were available for the current analysis. Table 7.3 shows the contents of each of these
lots.
Following museum preparation that revealed the anterior-posterior diameter of the
right horn core base, the lateral edge of the orbit and the zygomatic arch were also
exposed for examination and measurement that allowed identification of the species, age,
and sex of the carcass. Figure 35 provides a composite view of Feature 18 that is based
on the original mapping and photographs by the University of Texas field crew and the
author’s subsequent laboratory excavation of the matrix blocks containing the skull and
analysis. The non-conventional orientation of map north in the figure enhances visual
recognition of the feature’s contents.

269

Figure 35: Composite View of Feature 18, Based on Original Excavations and Current
Research.
Careful visual inspection of excavation photographs and sketch maps, a slow and
thorough examination of Dibble’s field notes, and the author’s own current research
documented that Feature 18 contains the anterior portion of a single bison carcass that
270

was separated into two primary groups of bone approximately 1.5 linear feet apart. Two
fragments of the right humerus, a fragment of the right radius, several ribs and thoracic
vertebra spines, and the skull were clustered to the east of another group that included
several rib fragments, a thoracic vertebra centrum, and the right scapula. The proximal
diaphysis of the right humerus was absent, but the diaphysis and distal epiphysis were
present in one large fragment. Elements identifiable in field photographs, but not
collected by the field crew included the right scapula and an unspecified number of
vertebral and rib fragments. No elements anatomically posterior to the thorax are evident
either in the excavation photographs or in the physical collection. Whether this is due to
the limited extent of the original excavation or the pre-burial condition of the carcass
itself cannot be determined with the current data.
Using available sources of information, the carcass appears to have been disturbed
prior to burial. The right scapula lies out of anatomical position to the left of the skull,
separated from the fractured proximal end of the right humerus by a distance of 1.5 linear
feet. The anterior portion of the skull rests on the distal end of the right humerus and
points towards the back wall of the rock shelter, away from the river. In addition, the
skull is resting on its palate with the left horn core tilted up at about a 30˚ angle. No
evidence of the right horn core was noted in Dibble’s field notes or faunal collection,
although the conditions of excavation and recovery may have precluded the care in
recognition, isolation, and consolidation that deteriorated, water-saturated bone demands.
The brain case is fragmented, but present. Notably, neither mandible was documented
during the excavation, nor were mandibular teeth were present in the faunal collection.
Compared with bone fragments contained in the underlying stratum 42, the bone
contained in Feature 18 is more deteriorated physically. Causes of this deterioration
originate both in pre-deposition weathering and the effects of possible groundwater271

related diagenesis following its subsequent burial by deposition of stratum 39 and the
overlying large roof spall or “mother rock”.
Notable inclusions in Feature 18 are two limestone cobbles. Given that stratum
40B’s largest other clasts are small gravels that are less than 0.5 inches in diameter, these
cobbles are out of place in the otherwise sandy silt matrix of stratum 40B and silt drape
of stratum 40A. The smaller cobble inclusion is globular in shape and about 2.5 inches in
diameter. It was found near the west wall of the excavation unit in association with the
bone cluster containing the right scapula. The other cobble was tabular in shape,
approximately 1.0 inch thick, and 5.0 inches in diameter. The tabular cobble was found
near the skull, adjacent to the proximal end of the right humerus. While no larger stone
block was found associated with the recorded portions of the feature that might have
functioned as an anvil, presence of the small cobbles is reminiscent of occurrences in
Bone Bed 1 at Bonfire Shelter (Bement 1986; Dibble and Lorrain 1968).
Taken as a whole, the deteriorated remains recorded as Feature 18 during the
Arenosa Shelter excavations represent portions of the anterior half of a single disturbed
extinct bison carcass. Using the teeth present in the upper tooth row and a relative
position for the frontal suture, analysis and interpretation of the feature centered on skull
fragment measurements that allowed comparison with known age, sex, and species of
extinct Terminal Pleistocene – Early Holocene taxa of bison and their modern
replacements to determine the age, sex, and species of the bison from Feature 18. Given
that the relative position of frontal suture position used is a rough estimate only and is
most likely placed too far laterally, the resulting measurements are in fact smaller than
actual for specific characters being measured. The physical measurements of the cranium
from Feature 18 were compared with relevant published data for Southern Plains modern
and extinct Late Pleistocene – Holocene bison, including Bison antiquus antiquus, Bison
272

antiquus occidentalis, and Bison bison from McDonald (1981), Skinner and Kaisen
(1947), and Wilson (1974, 1975) and are presented in Table 7.4.
Measurements that were chosen for comparison with known taxa include those
for
1) total length of the maxillary molar portion of the tooth row,
2) width of the upper first molar,
3) skull width at the orbit and immediately posterior to the orbit,
4) basal antero-postero diameter of the horn core,
5) angle of divergence of the horn core forward from the sagital plane, and
6) direction of origin of the horn core from the frontal bone.
Some of the anatomical measurements for Feature 18 in Table 7.4 are less than half of
what they were in life because only one side was available for measurement and the
frontal suture position is roughly estimated, most likely resulting in a underestimation of
the actual measurement.
Compared with cranial characteristics for both sexes of the three Late Pleistocene
– Holocene Southern Plains Bison, the Arenosa Shelter Feature 18 specimen was between
3.5 and 4.5 years of age at death, based on tooth eruption and wear characteristics for
Southern Plains bison (Guthrie 1990; McDonald 1981; Skinner and Kaisen 1947; Wilson
1974, 1975; Wyckoff and Dalquest 1997). While all three of the maxillary molars are
1

2

3

erupted, the M is heavily worn, the M is moderately worn, and the M is unworn. This
represents a fall to winter season of mortality.
The Feature 18 bison carcass most closely resembles the male Bison antiquus
antiquus on the basis of composite horn core characteristics. Specifically, these
characteristics include the horn core's virtually perpendicular angle of divergence forward
from the sagital plane (86°), its subhorizontal exit from the frontal, and its relatively large
273

antero-postero basal diameter (104 mm). Given these combined physical characteristics,
Feature 18 most likely represents the disturbed, partial carcass of a young adult male B. a.
antiquus.
A review of the physical evidence is useful. Portions of the carcass’s right
forelimb were present, but disarticulated and spread across a distance of several feet.
After careful cleaning and museum preparation, no obvious cutmarks were found on
these or other fragments present because the bone surface was too deteriorated.
Reiterating Lyman’s (1994a:306) caution about the absence of butchering damage at any
particular anatomical location, positive evidence of surface alteration by other means
correlates only to absence of butchering damage, not to negative evidence for it.
Although the carcass was not in original anatomical position, only two of the bone
fragments examined had minor tooth marking from carnivores or scavengers.
Significantly, these tooth-marked fragments were a rib fragment and thoracic vertebra
spine that were found in situ beneath the hard palate of the maxillary portion of the skull.
The other cranial, axial, or appendicular skeletal fragments do not retain any evidence of
carnivore modification. None of the available fragments have evidence of feeding by the
large carnivores or scavengers that were present in the Late Pleistocene. The minor
carnivore activities associated with the carcass are best explained by the furtive activities
of smaller scavengers prior to movement of the skull to overlying the affected bone
fragments. The humerus was unattractive to carnivores in search of marrow if first
broken by humans who removed the marrow (cf. Marean and Bertino 1994:765).
Hill (1979a:742-744; Hill and Behrensmeyer 1985) compared the natural
disarticulation sequence and butchering evidence for extinct bison at the Olsen-Chubbuck
Paleoindian site. He found little difference between the naturally occurring sequence and
dismemberment that accompanies intensive butchering because both processes exploit
274

weaknesses in articulations found throughout the body. One of the illustrations that he
used is telling because the degree of disarticulation or dismemberment exhibited by
Arenosa Shelter’s Feature 18 bison carcass is relatively advanced (Hill 1979a:Figure 2).
How should the disarticulated forelimb of this carcass and associated cobbles be
interpreted? Given its position below strata that have an absolute date within the
Paleoindian period, can this feature be considered the results of a kill or scavenging of a
relatively fresh carcass by Paleoindians? The degree of disarticulation in Feature 18 does
not fit the cold-season pattern of minimal disarticulation of fresh bison kills seen farther
north on the Plains, but is closer to the greater disarticulation seen in warm season kills
(Todd, et al. 1990:821). While it is difficult to determine whether articulated portions of
the axial skeleton were removed as a unit, the recognition of portions of thoracic
vertebrae in the elements present make this unlikely. Rogers and Martin (1984:761) reexamined the 12 Mile Creek Clovis site in Kansas and found that when bison skulls were
not removed from a Paleoindian kill area for further processing elsewhere or totally
fragmented in place, they may be moved a relatively short distance.
Bement (1999) notes a difference between the intense butchering of small kills
and less intense butchering with large kills during the Folsom period, at least operable
farther north on the Central and Southern Plains. From evidence in the Lower Pecos’s
Bonfire Shelter, the dichotomy in butchering intensity may not have been operable in the
Lower Pecos. Bonfire’s Paleoindian period Bone Beds 1 and 2 show evidence of
intensive primary butchering that involved virtually complete dismemberment of bison
carcasses, intensive processing of skull units to obtain the contents of the brain case,
tongues, and other desirable products, stacking of like elements in the same areas, and
marrow retrieval after fragmentation of appropriate elements (Dibble and Lorrain 1968;
Lorrain 1965). Notably, Bonfire Shelter excavator Dibble (Dibble and Lorrain 1968) also
275

found what he and later investigator Bement (1986) interpreted as butchering blocks or
stone anvils, cobbles, and evidence of articulations that had been battered apart in the
lower portion of Bone Bed 2 and in underlying Bone Bed 1.
At this point in the discussion, it is useful to remember that Dibble (n.d.) defined
stratum 40 as a low-energy flood deposit that contained no inclusions larger than small
gravels. The bison carcass in Arenosa Shelter’s Feature 18 was associated with two
limestone cobbles. Dibble (n.d.) noted that these cobbles were out of place in the fine
sediments of stratum 40. The limited extent of excavation associated with this feature
hinders interpretation of the extent of processing associated with its young bison bull
carcass. The small area excavated under the “Mother Rock” did not reveal the presence
of the remainder of the carcass or a stone anvil/butchering block. However, the
unexplained presence of the cobbles in stratum 40, degree of dismemberment of the
carcass, and fragmentation of the right humerus are suggestive of evidence for
disarticulation using battering during butchering found in Paleoindian context in Bonfire
Shelter’s lower levels, although the Arenosa Shelter cranium was not damaged to the
same extent. It is also suggestive of deliberate human bone fragmentation for marrow
removal (Marean and Bertino 1994).
At best, the proof for Paleoindian involvement with Feature 18 is moderately
convincing to corroborate Dibble’s (n.d.) belief that this young bull was butchered or
scavenged by humans. Using available indirect evidence in the absence of direct evidence
that more complete excavations at this level would have provided leaves potential
interpretation of this feature incomplete. However, the position of the bull’s skull
overlying other elements that were minimally carnivore ravaged, fragmentation of the
humerus, and suggestions of bone processing similarities to the earliest levels at Bonfire
Shelter partially lend credence to Dibble’s (n.d.) belief that Feature 18 represents an
276

episode of cultural modification of a freshly killed animal through butchering or through
scavenging of its bone, sinews, and fat sources.

277

Chapter 8: Summary and Conclusions
In summarizing the current research to, the full extent of data recovered from
Arenosa Shelter should be considered. The Arenosa Shelter collections do not contain as
complete an inventory of perishable material culture as drier rock shelter sites in the
region. However, they do provide a unique view into inter-related technological
subsystems present prehistorically in the Lower Pecos region. The faunal component of
subsistence data for the site extends into Paleoindian context and forms the foundation
upon which the bone technology is based. Flood damage in the lower Archaic cultural
deposits winnowed the deposits. The impact of these recurrent catastrophic floods
removed the record of bone technology from Early Archaic deposits at Arenosa Shelter.
A firm understanding of bone technology for Middle Archaic and later contexts is
possible because they are well represented in Arenosa Shelter’s lengthy stratigraphic
record.
SUMMARY
The rich faunal record contained in Arenosa Shelter’s deep, stratified deposits
contains over 47,000 specimens collected during the 1965–68 excavations, including
many bone artifacts. The current research examined a 10.4 per cent sample of faunal
materials from more precisely controlled excavations that had the best bone preservation
and deepest stratigraphy in the site. Although biased by a recovery strategy that excluded
most of the smaller faunal remains, the current research yielded remains of over 140
vertebrate taxa. Taxonomic assignments included 12 to class only, ten to order, 12 to
family, 33 to genus, 65 to species, and two to sub-species.
While the range of taxa present in the site’s faunal assemblage was diverse,
several more narrow segments dominated it. The NISP frequency was highest for
278

lagomorphs, large mammals that were nearly all deer or pronghorn, and medium to large
fish. Lagomorph frequency was greatest from Late Archaic to Historic context, although
large mammals were an important component throughout the sequence. Lagomorphs
were important in subsequent technological pursuits wherever present. Large mammals
were the most numerous Paleoindian constituents and were largely in the horse or bison
size range. Large mammals in later contexts were in the deer or pronghorn size range
and were also incorporated into technological activities.
The high relative frequency of the two leporid genera indicates that Lower Pecos
hunters and gatherers during the Late Archaic to Historic periods utilized a wide swath of
the landscape, from the riparian canyons to upland desert grasslands. MNI/MNE counts
are similar, although medium body-size mammals including carnivores and large rodents
are also a more frequent constituent of the total Late Archaic and Historic – Late
Prehistoric subsistence remains than evident if frequency is based solely on a NISP
measure. During and after the Late Archaic, large fish become an important part of the
subsistence economy, especially gar, catfish and cypriniform suckers. Importantly,
although they were never as numerous as mammals in the faunal remains, large birds
were present and included geese, ducks, broad-winged hawks, turkeys, roadrunners, and
gulls. Hawk bone was important in subsequent prehistoric technological activities. The
remains of dabbling ducks seasonally present in the canyons corroborate the episodic
presence of deep pools along the Pecos and Rio Grande that are suggested by the frequent
presence of blue catfish remains. Small birds included kites and small hawks, doves, and
quail, which was the most numerous of these smaller avian forms.
Age classes and sex were recorded in the limited cases where appropriate. Well
over 87 per cent of the faunal sample was considered to represent adult individuals.
Approximately 5 per cent of the sample was juvenile, about 7 per cent was subadult, and
279

the remainder were old individuals. Cottontail rabbits were the most frequent juvenile
form, although jackrabbits and canids also being moderately common. Juvenile deer
were poorly represented in the faunal remains recovered from the site. Subadult rabbits
are also very common, with cottontails being about six times more numerous than
jackrabbits. Subadult gray foxes are the most frequent of the medium mammals.
Subadult deer are slightly more common than subadult jackrabbits. Raccoons were the
most common old mammals, with deer, woodrat, white-throated woodrat, beaver, and
rock squirrel also being represented in this age group. Cottontail rabbits are the most
common adults. Jackrabbits and deer are less common, but still numerous. Adult
domestic sheep or goat, modern bison, Pleistocene bison, pronghorn, and an extinct
Pleistocene large deer were present. Differentiation between sexes was possible in only a
few cases. An extinct bison bull was present in Paleoindian context, adult deer remains
were identified in all contexts later than Middle Archaic, and an old male beaver was
identified in Historic – Late Prehistoric context.
Culturally modified faunal specimens in the faunal sample totaled about 11 per
cent, with changes induced by cooking or butchering, sensu Binford (1981b). A wide
variety of taxa were included: fish, birds, turtles, and of course, mammals. Remains of
large and medium mammals had more cultural modifications than those of small
mammals. Only rock squirrels among small mammals had butchering damage.
Modified medium mammals included rabbits, beaver, and most carnivores, except
the skunks. Modifications included recognizable skinning behaviors affecting the regions
of the extremities and head. Specialized skinning behavior evidence was present among
carnivore remains in Terminal Late Archaic contexts, but was also seen in a Late Archaic
rabbit specimen. The combination of patterned burning damage and recognizable meat
stripping among rabbit remains points to the practice of secondary butchering following
280

cooking. Importantly, cottontail extremities do not appear to have been disarticulated by
cutting in the same manner as jackrabbits and other medium-sized mammals.
Culturally modified large mammals included deer, bison, pronghorn, and sheep or
goat. Heat damage is common, as is butchering damage or human-induced fracturing for
marrow recovery, bone grease production, or the initial stages of subsequent
technological modification.

Skinning, dismemberment, and meat stripping damage is

common in specimens of Middle Archaic or later context. Modification included
scraping to remove the periosteal membrane covering appendicular elements.
Non-mammalian specimens in the sample were also culturally modified. Quail,
hawk, and diving duck specimens exhibit burning damage, cooking damage, or
dismemberment and defleshing cutmarks. At least one red-shouldered hawk specimen
has been technologically modified in the manner that would result in bone bead
production.

Burning or dismembering cutmarks modified turtle carapace and

appendicular fragments. Fish remains were modified by either burning or by cutmarks
that indicate butchering or subsequent tool manufacture.

While previously

undocumented from the region, the current research has resulted documented specific
signatures on fish vertebrae that point to specific filleting behaviors in human processing.
Other specific, but previously undocumented, butchering damage recorded specific
methods of safely handling catfish. Cutmarks at the base of the pectoral spines in a
position to sever the musculature of the articulation with the body document a disarming
method to defeat the defensive spines.
Fragments that had been modified beyond the normal limit for butchering or
marrow retrieval were a common occurrence during the faunal analysis. In some cases,
the fragments were recognized as implement fragments or debris from the implement or
ornament manufacturing process that had not been cataloged. Recognition of such
281

technological modification set the stage for analysis of bone artifacts in the second phase
of the current research.
The research’s second phase analysis was of a large sample of the site’s
technologically modified faunal remains. Approximately 55 percent of the cataloged
bone artifacts were analyzed to determine manufacturing and use wear characteristics.
Importantly, the analysis followed an exacting museum preparation effort that
exposed the surfaces of these artifacts for analysis, many for the first time. In the process
of microscopic examination during the preparation work, it was recognized that many of
the fragmentary tools and ornaments had significant amounts of surface modification.
The research design was expanded to include microscopic analysis of manufacturing and
use wear characteristics for the sample at magnifications of 10x – 70x. Also recognized
during museum preparation were manufacturing byproducts that indicated the presence of
a process of manufacturing for both tools and ornaments. This important point in the
research’s second phase allowed documentation of parallels to existing lithic technology
processes.
Two classes of bone artifacts were recognized in the collection sample,
implements and ornaments. While the implement class was determined to have two
approaches to blanks preparation during the manufacturing process, both classes shared
subsequent steps in the process. Recognition of this commonality led to understanding an
underlying strategy for raw material manipulation operable in bone technology.
Insight was gained into source animals used for implement and ornament forms.
Byproducts discarded from the manufacturing process retained anatomical features that
were identifiable to taxa, sometimes to genus or species level. This material was
considered to be debitage. When combined with manufacturing failures, it assisted in
understanding some of the decisions made by prehistoric technologists. Importantly,
282

while raw material for many of the undecorated beads was obtained from rabbit bone,
other major sources included long bones from hawks and mammalian carnivores that are
less frequent in the subsistence debris. The sources for bone tubes were also often
identifiable because minimal manufacturing modification left remnant anatomical
features identifiable to taxon.
Using the methods of Lemoine (1997) to determine manufacturing and use wear
signatures, a probable tool kit and sequence of manufacture were developed for both
ornaments and implements. These included cutting implements produced by the region’s
lithic technologists and tools used to produce lithic tools.
One of the primary methods of manipulating osteological raw material was by
cutting grooves with chert tools, sometimes accompanied by snapping apart the element
to separate portions that had been cut. The snapping procedure induced torsional or
perpendicularly applied forces in the element to remove the blank from its debitage.
Further steps potentially involved scraping with a chert tool. The scraping step had two
possible results, a) the periosteal membrane was removed from the surface allowing
easier access to the underlying bone, or b) the bone surface or surface of grooves that had
just been cut were further shaped. Grinding was often then used to achieve a final
configuration to the item being manufactured, including a) removal of unwanted portions
of the item (e.g. remnant articulations), b) edge or tip shaping, or c) creation of functional
or decorative facets.

For implements not using this approach to raw material

manipulation, the byproducts of subsistence activity-related marrow retrieval provided a
ready source for raw material that could be shaped further using the above methods or
using dynamic methods more akin to lithic technology. Percussion flaking was used for
some tool forms to shape them. Most implements were manufactured from large

283

mammal bone originating from subsistence activities. Much of the large mammal bone
was identifiable as artiodactyl metapodia.
Microscopic examination of surface characteristics on the bone artifacts resulted
in recognition of wear patterns from prehistoric use. These consisted of striations of
varying widths, depths, configurations, and orientations; surface polishes and rounding;
and presence or absence of the bone’s structural features (osteons) at the surface. Given a
broad range of possibilities documented in the current bone tool use wear literature, wear
on bone implements and ornaments in the Lower Pecos exhibited a narrower array of
uses. These involved contact between the bone artifact and several materials, including
silica-rich plants, wood, meat, fresh hide, hide with hair, dry hide, and siliceous stone.
Using morphological and use wear characteristics in tandem, uses for implements
included:

1. wood-working,
2. flint knapping,
3. stripping of bark from shrubs and small trees,
4. fiber stripping from desert succulents,
5. pressure and soft hammer percussion flaking in flint knapping,
6. meat cutting and butchering,
7. fresh hide dressing,
8. perforating hides or bundles of plant fiber textiles, and
9. sewing of sinew or plant fiber cordage.

284

Use-wear for bead forms indicates that they were sometimes strung on plant fiber
cordage, sometimes on sinew, and occasionally sewn onto hides or silica-rich plant fiber
textiles as surface decorations.
CONCLUSIONS
The current research documented the outcome of subsistence and technological
activities that occurred when indigenous inhabitants congregated along the river.
Archaic, Late Prehistoric, and Historic period residues from Arenosa Shelter contain
results of their attempts to hunt, fish, trap, gather plants for food and fiber, create
implements and ornaments, and fulfill many of their other daily needs including rituals.
Zooarchaeological Research
Gathering at the river is an important component in a broader landscape use that is
documented by the current zooarchaeological research. Use of additional components of
the Lower Pecos landscape is also documented by the current research. A much broader
use of the Lower Pecos environs, especially the uplands, was evident from research
results.
Zooarchaeological Research Conclusion #1: Lower Pecos residents used much of the
landscape in obtaining the faunal portion of their subsistence economy.
A conclusion that the Arenosa Shelter residents used much of the Lower Pecos landscape
is strongly supported by the results of this study. Many of the animal taxa are not
denizens of the canyons, but inhabit the rocky upland slopes and rolling arid plains of the
uplands themselves. Only in the human habitation areas of the Lower Pecos do the
upland jackrabbits and blue catfish of the deep river pools mix together to enter the
larder, decorative arts, and tool kits of the hunters and gatherers.

285

Zooarchaeological Research Conclusion #2: Lower Pecos indigenous residents made
full use of faunal resources from the canyons and surrounding arid uplands, fully
processing carcasses for food and other products.
If the prehistoric Lower Pecos residents gathered at the river, how did they use the
faunal resources obtained in the canyons and surrounding landscape?

From the

zooarchaeological segment of the current research, the conclusion is drawn that
prehistoric hunters and gatherers from the Paleoindian period onward took large and
small animals as prey. Human residents of the Lower Pecos canyon lands processed the
prey carcasses for the meat, fat, connective tissues, hide, bone, and other products offered
by them. Although the evidence for Paleoindian use of faunal resources in the vicinity of
Arenosa shelter is scanty and potentially enigmatic, there is evidence of butchering and
processing for marrow retrieval. The stratigraphic sequence at Arenosa Shelter dating to
the Early Archaic is badly affected by the effects of catastrophic flooding that winnowed
out most faunal remains or removed them altogether, but burned bone indicates presence
of human inhabitants making use of faunal resources in the shelter. The stratigraphic
sequence dating to the Middle Archaic and later reveals a much better case for aspects of
the subsistence system operating in the canyon lands.
Zooarchaeological Research Conclusion #3: Prehistoric Lower Pecos indigenous
inhabitants tapped the resources of the rivers and fully used the available fish for
subsistence and technological purposes.
Conclusive evidence is present in the Arenosa Shelter record for precise processing
strategies for removing the flesh from fish and safe handling of catfish that were caught.
Patterning in cutmarks present on axial skeletal material of fish indicates filleting of flesh
from the carcasses of medium to large fish. The use of this technique raises the
possibility that residents were drying or otherwise preserving the fillets. With the arid
regional climatic conditions, dry locations protected from weather, and the products of
286

the textile technological subsystem, the possibility of transport of products from fish out
of the canyons themselves should not be discounted. Fish filleted, preserved as a staple
for long-term storage, and moved elsewhere in the landscape for storage and use is a
distinct possibility that has not been considered before. The results of prehistoric
decisions concerning safe handling of catfish between capture and butchering are
conclusively revealed in specific patterning of cutmarks on pectoral spines from the site.
The ability to safely control and manipulate the bodies of these very muscular fish
following capture was a benefit that allowed full benefit to be obtained from the food and
other products that they represented. Large catfish could exceed a weight of 100 pounds
and seriously injure a careless human handling them. The prehistoric discovery of a
procedure to disarm the locking mechanism for the defensive spines by cutting the
controlling musculature must have been important and one that enhanced the proceeds of
the rivers’ bounty.
Zooarchaeological Research Conclusion #4: Lower Pecos indigenous peoples used
specific techniques, such as caping, to skin medium sized mammals for purposes other
than standard subsistence needs.
Conclusive evidence is also present that documents a skinning method used by hunters to
remove whole pelts of mammalian carnivores. Similar methods were used elsewhere on
the Plains to produce fetishes and shamanistic paraphernalia from the hides of birds and
small to medium-sized mammalian carnivores. Connections are present between these
skinning methods with the potential of their products to be used as fetishes or shamanistic
paraphernalia, ethnographic evidence for use of such skins as paraphernalia in rituals
using hallucinogenic plants found in the region paleobotanical record, and motifs in the
region’s rock art showing use of such paraphernalia ritually.

287

Zooarchaeological Research Conclusion #5: By the Middle Archaic, Lower Pecos
indigenous peoples used faunal resources for purposes beyond fulfilling subsistence
needs, incorporating their byproducts to fulfill technological needs.
The Lower Pecos residents incorporated faunal subsistence byproducts into their
technological systems by the Middle Archaic.

Taking a portion of the region’s

subsistence bounty as raw material for a technological subsystem provided an alternative
for scarce durable raw materials, such as hardwood, and allowed further development of
lithic and textile technological subsystems.
Bone Technology Research
The bone technology segment of the research results allows conclusions to be
drawn about raw material choices, processing methods, and use of bone technology to
support or enhance other technological subsystems during the Archaic, Late Prehistoric,
and Historic periods. These will be considered on the basis of provisional interpretations
from the current research.
Bone Technology Research Conclusion #1: Prehistoric Lower Pecos indigenous
inhabitants tapped the byproducts of subsistence in specific ways for raw materials that
were incorporated into the technological subsystem.
A conclusion from the bone technology portion of the current research can be
deduced prehistoric choices about raw material sources. Choices were documented in the
research about which raw materials were obtained for technological purposes from
subsistence residues and how they were processed. Fortuitous presence of debitage and
completed artifacts retaining anatomical features allowed source animals for raw
materials to be identified for several of the ornament and implement forms to be
determined with a greater degree of certainty in the current research than previous
researchers had achieved. The identification of source animals allowed a conclusion that
288

Lower Pecos residents used a diverse range of animals as raw materials in the
manufacture of ornaments. Beyond frequent rabbit remains, the current research
concluded that hawk, mammalian carnivore, and artiodactyl bone and antler were used as
raw materials for bead forms.
As with ornaments, prehistoric choices about raw materials for specific
implement forms can be deduced from the implements themselves, their debitage, and
other manufacturing byproducts. Smaller implement forms used medium-sized mammal
bone or catfish spines in some cases. This possibly represented a decision to reduce the
labor input required to create a similar, more durable form from artiodactyl elements.
Raw material for most forms was obtained from only a few artiodactyl appendicular
elements centering on dense lower leg bones. Manufacturing techniques for artiodactyl
metapodia-based implement forms were extensive and labor intensive. Refitting or tool
rejuvenation was practiced where breakage during manufacturing or use resulted in a
usable fragment of a tool.
Bone Technology Research Conclusion #2: Prehistoric Lower Pecos inhabitants
incorporated decorative elements into technological pursuits.
Conclusions are also allowed about the manner that the bone technology
subsystem took products from the subsistence process and created decorated ornaments
and implements. Employing simple linear motifs that vaguely mirror the rich and longlived multimedia artistic traditions of the Lower Pecos, subsistence residues were
modified into atypical implements and ornaments. While most forms analyzed during the
current study are unadorned by decorative elements, several bead and spatulate forms
have parallel or cross-hatch decorative motifs incised into their surfaces. Use wear
studies reveal that these implements and ornaments were fully functional with the sort of
wear resulting from uses typically found on undecorated forms.
289

Bone Technology Research Conclusion #3: Residents of the Lower Pecos region used
bone technology for the purposes of supporting other segments of the overall
technological system.
The current research results also allow conclusions about how the bone
technology subsystem created implements to support other technological subsystems
directly and indirectly. The bone technology subsystem enhanced subsystems for lithic
technology, textile technology, and subsistence technology as a whole. The results of use
wear analysis revealed that certain implement forms were used to obtain and process bark
and plant fibers. The bone technological subsystem functioned in this case in a role to
support the textile technological subsystem in obtaining and processing raw materials to
create woven or twined textiles, including cordage, matting, and other items. Other
implements aided in specific steps of the flint knapping process used by the lithic
technology subsystem to create cutting tools and armaments used for hunting, gathering,
and defensive purposes. Subsistence technology itself was aided by use of products from
the bone technology subsystem in the butchering process and in processing hides for
future use, with expedient and formal implements both being used in subsistence pursuits.
The final inter-related system affected by bone technology must be the religious
belief system of the Lower Pecos inhabitants. Best illustrated by the rock art still
prominent in the region, the belief system apparently used bloodletting in its rituals due
to inclusion of items with blood residues on them in dry cave caches. The potential ritual
uses for the catfish spines that so much care was used in obtaining must not be
underestimated. The relationship between the caping evidence from this study,
ethnographic evidence for use of hallucinogenic plants, and the religious beliefs evident
in the Lower Pecos region’s rock art are intriguing. They support potential outcomes as
shamanistic paraphernalia for this particular skinning behavior. The ritual linkage

290

between the manufacture of bead forms and specific source animals such as the hawk,
mammalian carnivore, deer, or all-important rabbit should also not be ignored.
Further Research
The current research represents an initial foray into aspects of zooarchaeology and
bone technology studies that have never been attempted in this region. Further research
might allow the following issues to be more fully investigated.
The possibility that filleted fish were preserved as a staple for long-term storage
and moved elsewhere in the landscape for storage and use is a distinct possibility that has
not been considered until the current research. Sites with a better Early Archaic record,
such as Baker Cave and Hinds Cave, are available for study using existing museum
collections as follow-up research to fill any information gaps based on Arenosa Shelter
conclusions. Use of these collections would eliminate the time gaps in the Arenosa
Shelter-based record. It would also allow differences in prehistoric use of the river and
adjacent landscape between the Pecos, Rio Grande, and Devils River drainage portions of
the region to be explored using such data.

Stratum

Description

1

thick (4.0 ft) layer of loosely compacted, unstructured humus rich tan sand containing noticeable quantities of
decaying organic matter, deposited by the major 1954 flood during Hurricane Alice.

2

thick (2.0 ft) semi-compacted light brown sand, with abundance of prehistoric cultural materials throughout, with
scattering of historic artifacts in upper surface. Level and continuous within shelter, truncated by erosion towards
river. Prehistoric material included arrow points, dart points, shell, limestone spalls, and burned rock.

3

thick (3.2 ft), compacted light gray to medium brown sand with high percentage of ash, burned rock, bone, mussel
and snail shells, and lithic waste in several distinct lenses towards rear of shelter.

4

thin (0.5 ft), loosely compacted light to medium brown sand with a thin scattering of chipped stone cultural materials
and sparse burned rock forming discontinuous separation between strata 3 and 5.

5

thick (2.8 ft), loose light to dark gray sand with abundant cultural materials, especially burned rocks, shell, limestone
spalls, charcoal, ash, and lithic tools and waste, also contains abundant mammal and fish bones.

6

Thin (1.1 ft), light orange aeolian sand within the shelter, apparently sterile and originating from alluvial deposits on
the former floodplain surface below the shelter.

6a

thin (1.5 ft), sterile sand, apparently aeolian in origin, but modified by runoff to include graded laminae, located on
terrace outside of shelter.

7

thin (<1.1 ft) grayish sand with abundant ash, and charcoal burned rock, shell, lithic artifacts, and lithic waste. Ash
noted in field notes as probably originating in unlined hearths.

8

thick (max. 2.8 ft) reddish-tan sand with sparse charcoal and shell, thinner or absent in shelter and thickest on
downstream terrace, apparently redeposited.
297

Stratum

Description

9

thickest (max. 5.3 ft) stratum in site, light gray to dark gray-brown sand, internally separated by thin compact layers
of sterile tan silt on downslope edges where stratum was thickest. Stratum 9 contained high percentage of burned
rock, limestone spalls, charcoal, ash, shell, lithic artifacts, and bone.

10

thin (0.1 - >1.0 ft) semi-compacted tan sand similar to Stratum 9 but light in color and less rocky, separated from
Stratum 9 on by compact thin layer of sterile silt on downstream end of site.

11

moderately thick (1.0 - 2.3 ft) light gray to dark gray brown sand, similar in character to Stratum 9.

12 - 18

a series of seven very thin (0.1 ft) strata that included four with sterile silt or sand (strata 12, 13, 15, 17) separating
three (14, 16, 18) with at least some cultural materials. They were recorded and removed as a single unit, although
they could be separated into individual strata in the downstream exposure.

19

a virtually sterile extensive reddish tan sand of variable compactness. Apparently deposited as fill in a drainage
channel that paralleled the back wall of the shelter, it slopes sharply downward and widens to the west and forms the
deepest stratum encountered in the downstream part of the excavations.

20

a thin (1.0 ft) dense fine-grained light reddish tan silt at the base of the (stratum 19) channel fill. The channel cut
through a number of lower strata in the central part of the shelter. Stratum 20 contains at least some cultural
materials, primarily as a very thin zone of charcoal, possibly redeposited from elsewhere in site.

21

a thin (<1.0 ft) light reddish to yellowish brown sand that sloped sharply downward and thinned to west, was
apparently highly disturbed and eroded, and contained limited amounts of cultural materials, probably redeposited.

22

a thin (<1.5 ft) reddish sand of restricted exposure, found within shelter. It contained limited cultural material in its
upper portions, mainly ash, charcoal, and burned rock. The lower part of this stratum was a sterile sand with at least
one very thin reddish silt layer between upper and lower sands.

VITA

Christopher James Jurgens was born in Austin, Texas on September 13, 1953, the
son of Evalyn Kruger Jurgens and Kenneth Charles Jurgens. He graduated from Sidney
Lanier High School in Austin, Texas, in 1972 and entered The University of Texas at
Austin. After completing the degree of Bachelor of Arts in Archaeological Studies in
1977, Mr. Jurgens earned the degree of Master of Arts in Anthropology from Texas Tech
University in Lubbock, Texas, in 1980. The Texas Department of Water Resources
employed Mr. Jurgens in 1981 as an archaeologist and environmental reviewer, a position
that he held subsequently with that agency’s successor, the Texas Water Development
Board. In September 1990, while continuing full-time employment as a professional
archaeologist with the State of Texas, Mr. Jurgens entered the Graduate School of the
University of Texas at Austin to pursue further studies.
