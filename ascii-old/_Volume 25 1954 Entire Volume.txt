The society was organized and chartered
in pursuit of a literary and scientific undertaking; for the study of the history, prehistory and the major artifacts of man and
the fossils representing the past floras and
faunas of Texas; for the encouragement of
the proper collection and preservation of
such artifacts and fossils in museums and
their study and classification and the publication of the results of the researches incident thereto.
The BULLETIN is published annually for
distribution to m e m b e r s of the society.
Opinions expressed herein are those of the
writers, and do not necessarily represent
views of the society or the editorial staff.

INTRODUCTION
In many fields of science it is possible to obtain handbooks or guides which summarize knowledge in those fields,
reducing a vast amount of original research by many different persons to a concise, relatively simple form. Thus,
if One wishes to identify certain mammals, birds, fishes, insects, reptiles, trees, flowers, rocks, minerals, and so on, there
are many books designed for this purpose, giving descriptions and illustrations of species and types, outlining their
distributions and principal identifying characteristics.
For exact, positive identifications, it is still necessary
to have specialists do this directly; for not only does the
specialist have knowledge of the alternative possibilities, but
he may have a file of material built up carefully over a long
period with which he can make direct comparisons and thus
eliminate errors. Handbooks are nevertheless tremendously
useful for educational purposes, for the pleasure they bring
in enabling each person to gain an idea of what he has found,
and for what they show about the complexity of nature.
Archeology has never developed the handbook principal,
except in the case of guides to individual museum collections. The archeological profession has often, and justifiably, been criticised for its clannish attitude, its refusal to
make the products of its research clearly understandable to
the layman. It is, however, not so much refusal to meet this
obligation that impresses me, as the fact that this profession has not yet found any consistent procedures for establishing types of artifacts. By and large, each archeologist
classifies to suit himself. It is as though the zoologist or
botanist classified organisms in all sorts of ways, according
to what seemed significant to him, but without the central
concept of a species. The species concept did not reach perfection overnight, and for a long time each biologist had his
own idea of how to apply it in practice. As a result, the
biological world was long swamped with new "species" for
almost everything collected; but in recent years re-organization has taken place and superfluous species gradually weed-

Texas Archeological Society

ed out. Archeology, at least in the New World, has yet to
face this problem of superfluous, conflicting, and overlapping "types" of artifacts. They are created constantly, either
by name or by some system of symbols, without much regard for the effect they have on other archeologists or confusions in the minds of students who attempt to understand
these "types".
From a purely practical point of view, it is unreasonable
to expect that everyone interested in archeology should try
to remember all of the details, agreements, and conflicts, between the hundreds of "types" set up by scores of workers,
without some sort of concise guide to follow. This step must
come eventually for American archeologists, and we regard
this "Introductory Handbook of Texas Archeology" as a step
in that direction.
The word "Introductory" is necessary because this work
is far from complete, even for the State of Texas. Part I
consists of trait lists for the culture complexes which we
regard as fairly well established. These are subject to revision as information increases; new traits may be added in
the course of time; and as more studies are made it is possible that some of the traits we have listed will prove not
to be associated with these complexes, but with others of
earlier or later date in the same areas. We expect and welcome suggestions as to how the lists may be improved. It
must be realized that great parts of the State are not represented at all in these lists--particularly the bulk of the
Panhandle and the plains to the south of it--and that amateurs as well as professionals have ample opportunity to find
new material.
Part II consists of descriptions of the better-known types
of pottery and projectile points, also incomplete for lack of
typological analysis in many parts of the State. It has been
necessary to confine the type descriptions to these two categories, first because the bringing in of all other recognizable
classes of artifacts would entail a great deal more research
and time than we had available for this volume; and second

Introduction

because of the prohibitive cost of publishing it all in a single
volume. It is to be hoped that the many other classes of
artifacts, houses, burials, earthworks, etc., can be formally
typed and illustrated in future volumes.
We have chosen pottery and projectile points for this
initial volume for a very practical reason: they provide the
best clues to the presence of particular culture complexes in
this State, if not elsewhere. Where definitely identifiable
types of pottery and projectile points are present, it is usually seen that other traits of the same complexes are also
present. However, it is necessary to warn the reader that
the presence of a single type of artifact is not reliable evidence for the identification of the complex of which it is
supposed to form a part. Complexes are identified through
the presence of several key traits in association; a single type
can--and usually does--appear as a part of several distinct
complexes. In other words, several different Indian tribes
living over a large area may have shared in the manufacture
of a particular type of artifact,~ and that type would not prove
the presence of one of those tribes any more than the others;
but when a complex consisting of several types of weapons,
utensils, skinning and sewing implements, a particular burial
practice, special form of pipes, ornaments, and the like can
be worked out, the total assemblage is usually distinct in
some ways from the total assemblage of traits of any other
tribe or cultural group. Each complex, then, is a combination of culture traits which happen to coincide in a particular
way in one place or area, whereas each of the traits embraced by it will have a somewhat different distribution,
traceable in different directions, from each of the others.
Archeologists have themselves been classified into "splitters" and "lumpers". The "splitters" prefer to set up types of
great refinement, so that the smallest differences are considered to designate typological distinction and a collection will
be sorted into innumerable small groups of rigid uniformity.
Thus, projectile points which are similar in stem and blade
shape will be subdivided into "types" with short barbs, medium barbs, and long barbs; the average "splitter" would be

Texas Archeological Society

horrified at the suggestion that concave bases could be included in the same type with straight bases, or that pottery
bottles could be included in a single type with bowls. The
"lumpers", on the other hand, make only rough divisions
along general lines, either because more refined types do not
seem worth the effort, or because they hold no particular
interest in comparing the products of man from one site to
another and one region to another. In practice, very rough
typing of the "lumper" variety is often quite useless for strict
comparisons.
We do not identify ourselves with either of these extremes, believing that all archeological material must be
analyzed for consistency, and the groupings continually tested for what they reveal about the distribution in time and
space of the underlying, human idea behind the manufacture
of the objects in question. Thus--as will be noticed in many
of the plates in Part II--a specimen at the extreme range
of variation of one type may be identical to one at the extreme range of another type. Artifacts which seem identical
to the eye may each have been produced with a somewhat
different pattern in mind--patterns dictated by the cultural
habits of the group--and their identity is thus due to coincidence rather than to intent.
Both the "splitter" and the "lumper" have a comparatively easy time of it. The former simply puts together all
specimens which look alike, and if he then has 50 "types"
of arrow points for a single culture complex, this causes him
neither concern nor curiosity about what the ancient people
were actually doing. The "lumper" likewise is not concerned about how many actually distinct--and therefore
culturally significant--styles were being manufactured by
the people he is studying through their archeological remains.
Concern with the inner problems of artifact typologyhas been going on for many years at the University of Texas.
This partly explains why it has taken so long to produce
typological results such as herein presented. As recently

Introduction

as the fall of 1954, when this Handbook was still being planned (due to the fact that no manuscripts were re~eived for
the 1954 Bulletin), many of the types herein presented were
still quite tentative, and others had not even been created.
The amount of trial sorting, re-sorting, and checking against
facts of time and space distribution done between October,
1954, and April, 1955, would be impossible to convey to the
reader. The types of pottery and projectile points herein
presented are the principal results of that process; but many
other possible types emerged which will require more study
--and more material from different parts of the State--before we will know whether they constitute real types or not.
In all, over 4,000 complete pottery vessels and 200,000
potsherds have been examined. Most of these are in the
University of Texas collections, but many were examined
through the courtesy of private persons and museums, as
acknowledged under "Plate Identifications~. We also examined intensively more than 25,000 projectile points for
establishing the types, holding in reserve another 20,000 or
so which were then examined to see whether the types could
be readily recognized in consistent form and variation. This
check showed generally good results, although we would be
the first to admit that some revisions may be needed as exact
data increases. In other words, there is little purpose served
in juggling the types further, until specific information on
distribution in space, or position in a stratigraphic sequence,
is available to provide objective bases for altering the inelusiveness of a given type--information which we do not
now possess. Without going into detail, the premises and
procedures used to form these types are those discussed by
Krieger (1944) and Newell and Krieger (1949, pp. 71-74).

A common stumbling block in archeology is to try too
hard to make every specimen fit into some kind of a type.
Usually this means that endless numbers of new "types"
have to be created just to take care of a minority of divergent
specimens. We have followed the principle that it is utterly1
impossible to establish the type of every specimen. Our
types have been established on the basis of large sampling~,

Texas Archeological Society

so that contrasts become clearer than in samplings of only
five or ten specimens (as is too often the case in this country). The pottery types are based on a minimum of 25 complete vessels each, but most include at least 100 vessels each,
and several are represented by hundreds. The single exception is in the Alto Focus types, where no complete vessels
were found among 96,000 potsherds excavated; but the number of sherds in this case which revealed vessel shape and
design distribution on rim and body plainly made up for
their lack of completeness. As a general rule, no pottery
type has been defined unless we had good knowledge of what
the whole vessels looked like. The projectile-point types are
based on a minimum of 100 specimens each, but few of them
were so scantily represented; most consist of several hundred, and some of as many as 3,000 specimens.
The problems and headaches of sorting grow in proportion to the magnitude of the sampling, so that the more
specimens, the more complete and exasperating their overlapping in all ways. On the other hand, the magnitude of
our sampling has made the principal contrasts in pattern
clearer, and--most important--errors in judgment have been
to a large extent overcome by sheer numbers. Thus, -while
it was impossible to make satisfactory decisions about all
specimens belonging to this or that type, the borderline
cases can hardly constitute 10 per cent of the total number
typed, if that much.
In the case of both pottery and projectile points, we
have not even attempted as yet to establish types for minor
groups which do not agree well with the many large gro,ups.
Their identification should follow as knowledge of them increases. It is particularly important that such material
should be fully reported in the publications on individual
sites. Thus, future reports will include frequency tabulations of types as they are given here, provided there is no
argument about their reality; proposed revisions in the present types (with the reasons therefore) ; new types (with explanations of why they are new) ; and "left-overs" which do
not fit into any well-established types and should be de-

Introduction

scribed and illustrated individually. The "left-overs" may
eventually be expected to assume one of three statuses, hence
their individual treatment in publications is of critical importance. They may be identified in due time as:
1. Representatives of new types, developed by further
research in a single area, or in another area or state where
they prove to be more common.
2. Intrusions, brought from elsewhere by native trade,
visits, war parties, intermarriage, etc.; or intruded into a
site by some sort of accident (e.g., when an Indian picked
up a more ancient artifact and, out of curiosity, took it home,
just as we do).
3. Curiosities and accidents: odd products of some personâ€™s imagination or "doodling" which, never having been
adopted by the cultural group, or even by a second person,
do not attain the status of culture traits. Included here are
artifacts which probably simply did not turn out according
to plan, but their deviations from normal did not spoil them
for use.

Progress in Texas archeology depends far more on research by amateurs than most of them realize. The University of Texas, contrary to popular opinion, does not provide
funds for field work or site exploration; such work as has
been done since the 1930â€™s has been done on grants which
have to be raised from a number of sources with a great deal
of time and trouble. The University does maintain an archeological laboratory, now in comfortable new quarters
with much more working and storage space than before. The
University thus has the facilities for acting as a center of
research, a place where archeological material can be seen
and compared, where problems can be discussed, and advice
given as to how amateurs can work independently.
In order to develop the typological problems initiated by
this Handbook, the University needs the help of all amateurs who wish to contribute something to human known

Texas Archeological Society

edge; from past experience, I think that this includes the
majority of them. We urge that amateurs as well as professionals view the present results critically: if specimens
in your collections do not seem to fit rather readily into any
of the types presented here, it may very well be that new
ones should be defined. This is quite possible--even probable-in those parts of the State which we have not been
able to cover for lack of adequate collections in our records.
However, as indicated above, new types, to be valid, must
be based on quantities rather than a few odd specimens. It
would be very desirable as well as practical for tentative
new types to be discussed by those concerned, perhaps during the annual meetings of the Society. Various types have
already been proposed independently here and there, but
without reference to what is being done in other areas. This
results in a multiplicity of names being coined for artifacts
which are very similar if not identical, and adds to confusior~ without advancing the science of archeology. It is
very difficult to get rid of superfluous names for the same.
artifacts after they have been recorded in print, and still
more difficult to explain to the uninitiated why there are so
many different names already in the literature which conflict with one another. This goes on in different states as
well, for lack of consultation beforehand.
One of the purposes of this Handbook is to encourage
amateur archeologists to analyze their own collections, and
thus contribute to increasing knowledge of the thousands of
years of native history of this State. Many of the most important discoveries already made in Texas and other states
have been made by amateurs who not only have sharp eye.s
and a good sense of observation, but who learn a great deal
more about the details of a small area over the years than
any professional who is able to spend only a few days--or at
most a few weeks--in the intensive investigation of selected
sites.
We should like to see amateur archeologists throughout
the State make a compilation of artifacts in their own collections, starting with the types of pottery and projectile

Introduction

points described herein. The notes which we have given
on distribution are very general, barely suggesting the main
areas in which each type has so far been found. This has
been done because we really do not know the full distribution of a single type. We have presented enough for the
reader to gain some perspective, to get a general idea of what
he can expect to find in various pa~ts of the State, and the
general time position of such remains. In order to increase
this knowledge, and eventually to publish maps showing the
full distribution of each type (and new types), we suggest
the following procedures:
1. Count the specimens that you feel can be readily
identified from the present descriptions and illustrations, but
keep separate accounts for those found on different sites. Do
not force the identification too much, for it is not to be expected that all your specimens are of known types.
2. Make outline drawings or photographs of those that
do not agree, and label them by some system to indicate the
sites on which they were found. If possible, bring such material to the annual meetings for discussion and comparison
with other members (the Texas Archeological Society meets
annually in late October or early November at a place announced by September; non-members have always been welcome too).
3. List the other classes of artifacts found on the same
sites, so that associations can be checked with the trait lists
in Part I and the particular culture complexes identified. We
expect that new complexes will be identified in many parts
of Texas, and local archeological groups can do much to discover them.
Some warnings are in order. First, a single type of artifact may have a very restricted distribution, hardly ever
being found away from that area, while another may be
found over half the North American continent. Many of
those found in Texas will eventually be recognized far beyond the boundaries of this State, but at this point we prefer
to wait for such matters to develop. Named types as de-

10

Texas Archeologica! Society

scribed herein should not conflict with the innumerable
numbered "types" found in hundreds of publications. With
time and patience those that are really similar and have the
same meaning in history should be brought together under
the same name.

Second, a particular complex or "focus"

cannot be recognized through any one artifact type.

A

single type can--and normally does---occur in two or more
foci, sometimes in dozens of them, being borrowed by one
cultural group after another. A focus is recognized by the
presence of several key types in association. The number
needed for such recognition cannot be stated exactly and
advice should be sought on this point.

The most common questions asked by students of archeology are: What Indians made these artifacts? How old
are they? It is one of our curious paradoxes that the most
simple and obvious questions are the hardest to answer,
even after years of intensive effort. The most famous Texas
tribes, such as Comanche and Apache, only entered the State
shortly before or after the first Europeans had explored it;
and as they wandered constantly, they left no accumulation
of remains anywhere that compare with those of the older,
native tribes. In other cases, such as the Karankawa, Wichita, and Caddo, connections have been made with archeological material in some areas, as noted on the trait lists.
For the most part, however, it is practically impossible to
state that such and such artifacts were made by any particular tribes. A great field of research remains to be done on
this subject, particularly in conducting excavations around
Spanish missions and other historic sites, where the early
documents often give the names of tribes who gathered about
the settlements. Usually the pre-European material must be
discussed without the use of known tribal names; thus we
speak of the "people of Pecos River Focus"; "the Edwards
Plateau Indians", etc., using the name of the cultural units
applied to their archeological remains.
The determination of age is one of our most difficult
problems. It would be of greatest benefit if we could obtain
more Carbon 14 age determinations in Texas, but the labora-

In~roduc~io~

11

tory established for this purpose at the University of Texas
has not, at this writing, yet produced a dating to aid in this
survey. Meanwhile, we have entered an "estimated age" in
the trait lists and type descriptions which has been carefully
considered from different points of viewmby comparison
with culture complexes elsewhere dated by Carbon 14; by
comparison with tree-ring datings in New Mexico and
zona; by stream terrace association; and so on. Any of the
estimates we have used may be badly off, but we have tried
to make them reasonable without being insistent. Back to
about 1000 A. D. we have made estimates in spans of about
two or three hundred years (1400-1700 A. D., 1200-1500 A.
D., etc.), within which we think the cultural unit existed.
This is not to say that the unit existed for 300 years in each
case, but that it is believed to have thrived during at least
good part of that time.
Going back beyond 1000 A. D., estimates have been made
in blocks of 500 years or 1000 years. We prefer them to be
so generalized because there is a deplorable tendency among
archeologists to publish precise dates for many phases of
culture, when as a matter of fact there simply is not information enough to do any close figuring. The Southwestern
culture area provides a notable exception through the treering dating system, which does enable extremely close figuring, almost to an exact year in some cases, back approximately to the time of Christ.

A word must be said about the reasons for the tardiness
of this printing. During the winter and spring of 1954, Miss
Suhm was a University of Texas graduate student in anthropology, and part-time office assistant to Mr. Jelks, the
Texas representative of the River Basin Surveys of the
National Park Service (formerly this Survey was a division
of the Smithsonian Institution). Her interest in archeology
and conversations with Mr. Jelks and myself and others led
Miss Suhrn to try to draw up a list of traits and artifact types
in various parts of Texas. She also made a wall chart for
purposes of clarifying the picture.

12

Texas Archeological Society

It seemed to me that this survey should be encouraged
and eventually put into publication when it was full enough.
By June 1954 it was time to plan the 1954 Bulletin of this
Society, but instead of asking for manuscripts from various
members, I decided to see what would be submitted voluntarily. Part of the summer was spent in Mexico writing a
dissertation, and on my return to Austin early in September, I found that not a single manuscript had been submitted
for the Bulletin, nor did anyone even indicate plans for submitting one. This left the field open for following up the
idea of a guide or manual of Texas archeology. Miss Suhm
and Mr. Jelks had worked on the trait lists during the summer whenever time permitted. In September we began to
plan this Handbook seriously and made a survey of the
amount of new typological research we would have to do to
round it out.
By this time it was fully apparent that new research
would have to be performed on artifact types in all parts
of Texas before we could present enough of them to be really
helpful for others in analyzing collections. I went through
great numbers of specimens, photographs, and notes to see
what could be used. By October, we were moving along
fairly well and had hopes of finishing by the yearâ€™s end. As
in all such cases we underestimated the job or overestimated
our abilities. Unfortunately, it was at this time that we lost
the services of Ed Jelks. The National Park Service closed
its River Basin Surveys office in Austin and transferred him
to the Jamestown project in Virginia. His last month was
taken up with ordering and packing the extensive files and
equipment of the Austin office. From November 1st onward, Miss Suhm and I continued the research and writing
alone. Due to the fact that she was now the secretary of the
Anthropology Department, and I was rather desperately trying to complete other manuscripts for other deadlines, neither of us was able to spend more than a part of our time
on the Handbook. After February 10th, I was able to increase this time.
The actual writing of this Handbook would not have

Introduction

13

been too difficult if all the typological research had been
well set beforehand. However, it was necessary to reexamine every pottery and projectile-point type set up by
all those who have created them in the State, including the
re-examination of those of the authors themselves. Adjustments were made in some of these, but it was necessary to
create many new ones to take care of even the general run
of artifacts in most parts of the State. Thus the experimental
sorting, study, and re-sorting done by Miss Suhm and myself since November 1st has taken at least twice the time
spent on actual writing.
Miss Suhm deserves the place of senior author because
of her original idea of a simplified guide, the vast araount
of interest, energy, and judgment that she exhibited in ex~
tracting information from the literature, her writing the
first drafts of all the sections of Part I and the descriptions
in Part II, and her critical and acute role in extending the
typological studies. My part has been one of planning and
organization, contributing unpublished information and evaluations, criticizing and reconciling previous works (including my own), re-writing most of the sections, making final
decisions on most of the types, preparing the illustrations;
and doing editorial work for the final printing. Jelks has
provided information from excavations and eolleetfons of the
River Basin Surveys in dozens of reservoir basins in Texas
between 1947 and 1954, and contributed typological determinations from his own researches and those of his predecessor, Robert L. Stephenson. Jelks is also responsible for
the basic scheme of four cultural stages--Paleo-Ameriean,
Archaic, Neo-Ameriean, and Historiemwhich we have used
to discuss the data; the first and third of these terms were~
coined by him.
This work contains deficiencies and it may raise more
questions than it answers. Much more data could have been
included, but we had to be brief and reduce expenses. The
type descriptions have been trimmed to fit single pages
facing the illustrations, except in those cases where two
pages of illustration allowed two pages of description. Much

14

Texas Archeological Society

more data on types could have been included, but we hope
we have included enough for general purposes, and believe
that the facing-page system will prove convenient.
Each plateâ€™showing a type of projectile point attempts
to convey (1) an impression o.f the total range ol variation
as we see it, with largest, smallest, broadest, narrowest,
finest, and crudest extremes; variations in shoulders, barbs,
shape and size of stem in relation to blade; variations in
shape of base, etc.; and (2) a representation roughly reflecting the frequency of such details: Thus thbse variations seen
least often in actuality appear least often on the plates. The
pottery types also attempt to show variations in form and
design distribution, but it is difficult to do this with as much
success. Whole specimens cannot always be found for each
variation; we have no photographic record yet of many ir~teresting specimens in other hands; and som~ vessels are so
decorated that it is almost impossible to make their designs
show in photographs.
The trait lists in Part I do not include explanations for
many decisions made about what to include and not to include in the various loci and aspects. To have done so
would again have increased the length of this work, and
moreover would be very confusing to the average reader.
Such problems are best threshed out in the discussion sections of individuai~ site reports and areal surve.ys. Here w~e
have omitted those trait problems which cause the greatest
controversies, and it may well be that traits other than the
ones we have listed should belong to a particular complex.
Certain type descriptions do not agree closely with
previous publications. In such cases we have notedthat a
change of opinion has taken place since the original work
Â¯ was written. The reader is to assume that the present wording is our best estimate, the previous ones obsolete..
Some type names for projectile points in Central and
western Texas are those coined by J. Charles Kelley many
years ago, provided that they have been mentioned in print
in one way or another, and quoted by other writers. Since

Introduction

he has never described or illustrated any of these in any detail, we cannot be sure that his conception of their ranges
of variation coincides with ours. It simply seemed best not
to create new names when these had already gained some
use in his and othersâ€™ publication.s. On the other hand,
scores of other type names coined by him but never described have not been used here. We have, in fact, done .the
projectile-point typology over again for central and western
Texas, at considerable labor. This was desirable anyway,
to bring a uniformity of concept into the present work for
all sections of the State.
All qualifying terms have been dropped from projectilepoint names, even from those which have previously been
Â¯ published. Thus, they are simply "Nolan points", "Gary
points", "Folsom points", etc. Qualifying terms give too restr,ictive an idea of what variations may occur within a type.
Thus, those with "Barbed" in the name need not always be
barbed; those with "Contracting Stem" as part of the name
may vary from sharply contracting to parallel-edged; and
so on. No one is going to learn the appearance and variations of any type anyway until he has studied illustrations
and gained some idea of what features to look for, just as
he would with animals, plants, minerals, etc.. If desired,
types can always be tabulated under certain headings such
as "triangular", "stemmed", "notched", "lanceolate". In pottery typology, on the other hand, there is more reason to use
qualifying names such as "Engraved", "Punctated", "Stamped", "Incised", "Plain" for purposes of stressing technique
and technological tradition.

Some of the cultural terminology used herein shouldbe
briefly explained: The four stages are ~ery broad in concept
but they serve to indicate the principal differences in age of "
most archeological remains.
1. Paleo-American is used in place of the more commonly used Paleo-Indian because there is growing doubt that
the earliest migrants to the New World from Asia were truly

16

Texas Archgological Society

Indians. They may not even have been Mongoloids (a race
which some anthropologists regard as of rather recent development in Asia), but representatives of a stock which
might be called proto-Caucasian. Whoever these first inhabitants were, their initial migrations occurred a long time
ago. For some time it has been popularly believed that the
makers of Folsom points were the New Worldâ€™s first inhabitants, about 10,000 years ago, but there are now evidences of
much older people. We cannot guess the span of human
occupation as yet, except to say that it begâ€™an well back in
the Glacial or PleiStocene epoch, probably as much as 25,000
years ago and perhaps much more than that. The Pleistocene, on the other hand, has been shown by Carbon 14 datings to have lasted somewhat later than previously estimated, the last full glaciation having reached its climax
about 11,000 .years ago. The characteristic Pleistocene mammals such as mammoth, mastodon, saber-toothed cat, native
American horse, camel, giant ground sloth, giant wolf, cave
bear, extinct species of bison larger than the modern one,
etc., rather certainly became extinct everywhere in America
by 5,000 B. C, when a long period of desert conditions (the
Altithermal Age) set in, destroying the grass on which some
of the animals lived, and the carnivores which lived on the
grazing mammals. Most of these animals had, however,
disappeared long before the Altithermal Age, or even before
the last major glaciation. The large bison, probably also the
sloth and dire wolf, seem to have lingered on longer than the
others, so that there may have been a differential of several
thousand years between the extinction of various species;
and, na.tu~ally, some may have lingered longer in some areas
than in others.
We therefore apply the term "Paleo-American" to those
unknown people who arrived in the New World by way of
northeastern Siberia. at some remote but unknown time
during the latest phases of the Pleistocene, lived as nomadic
hunters of big game, and survived about as long a~ the last
of the Pleistocene animal species which eventually became
extinct--that is, until approximatel~y 5,000 B. C. The term

Introduction

"Paleo-American" is thus synonymous with Pleistocene
habitants of the New World. Between approximately 11,000
and 7,000 years ago, when Pleistocene animals were finally
disappearing, archeologlcal sites show less and less evidence
of the hunting of such animals, ~as one would expect. Thus
a Plainview, Scottsblu]], or other early post-glacial type of
projectile point may be found with now-extinct bison ir~
some localities but not in others because man was now turning to other foods to exist. Milling stones and manos first
appear widely in North America during this early postglacial period, indicating use of plant foods, nuts, berries,
roots, etc., which were ground into meal. It is important to
note that we have distinguished between ground and polished stone artifacts, the first category consisting of implements ground by use on certain faces, the second being
shaped, grou~.d, and polished for beauty as well as utility..
Thus~ manos, milling stones, mortars, and pestles are theâ€™
chief artifacts ground by Use alone, but of these, mortars
and pestles are exceedingly rare in Texas. Manos and milling stones definitely appear before the end of Pleistocene
times as we define this stage, that is, in early post-glacial
times, while true polished-stone artifacts do not appear until
later, in the Archaic Stage, beginning perhaps as early as
4000 or 3000 B. C.
Archeological evidence of the Paleo-Americans is very
scanty at best, consisting largely of choppers, scrapers, and
projectile points. The earliest known projectile points, however, did not appear until America had already been inhabited for some time. These were the Sandia and C~ovis types,
both appearing, it now seems, somewhat before the final
Wisconsin ice advance, or roughly between 18,000 and 15,000
years ago. They are the~:efore approximately as old as any
of the Old World stone points. The FolSom type, developin~
out of Clovis, belongs more or less to the final major Wisconsin ice advance, called Mankato by most geologists. The
FoIsom type appears to have disappeared rather rapidly, by
about 9000 years ago, giving way to Plainview, Scottsblu~,
Eden. Anaostura. Meserve, and Browns Valley points (some

1.8

Texas Archeological Society

of which have been widely termed "Yuma" points) in early
post-glacial time, or roughly 9,000 to 6,000 years ago.
Most of the known Paleo-American sites are simply
places where characteristic Pleistocene animals were killed
and butchered. The artifacts are therefore largely from the
weapons used spears or atlatl darts--and implements used
for skinning and dismembering the carcasses. Dwellings, if
any, and burial customs are totally unknown, nor has any
evidence of domesticated dogs been found. In spite of the
simple existence lived by wandering bands of people in
search of game, there probably are thousands of such sites
in North America alone; but because of their age and the
changes in climate which have occurred, the vast majority
of such sites must be buried under layers of sand and
alluvium. Those which have been found have almost always
been exposed by erosion of the covering materials, so that
the chances of discovering them are infinitely small in proportion to the enormous amounts of covering up of ancient
land surfaces.
2. An Archaic Stage is used in the usual sense in North
America north of Mexico. It bridges the time between
Paleo-American nomadic hunting people on the one hand,
and the settled agricultural, pottery-making Indians on the
other. Hunting~ gathering of wild plant foods anal shellfish,
and fishing were all pursued. Chipped-stone artifacts cover
a much wider range of classes and types than before; projectile points reveal scores of distinct shapes, most of them having stems formed by making notches in the corners in various ways. 1Vfanos and milling stones continued in use, while
mortars and pestles appear widely in some regions. ~Polished-stone artifacts such as pendants, boatstones and bannerstones (beautifully shaped weights for atlatls), tubular
beads, and t~bular pipes provide entirely new traits) Probably canoe transportation and domestic dogs were spread
over most of America in this stage. Dwellings must have
been rude brush shelters, perhaps co~ered with mats or skins
in some areas, or simple lean-tos; but being easily built of
light poles and sticks, evidence of them is practically im-

Introduction

19

possible to find archeologically. Generally speaking, the
dead were buried in flexed position and without offerings
except for personal adornments left on the bodies. There
are notable exceptions, as in California, where whole cemeteries have been found with bodies extended; but whether
flexed or extended, they were accompanied by numerous
offerings.
The Texas Archaic remains fit into this generalized
picture, but there are important differences within the State.
The East Texas material is closely connected with that of
the Eastern United States as a whole; Trans-Pecos Texasâ€™
shows connections with the Southwe.st; Southwest Texas
with northeastern Mexico; and the central part is unique in
some ways. No Archaic Stage has yet been defined in the
Panhandle and South Plains. North-Central Texas shows
blends of artifact types in Central and East Texas.
In western New Mexico and southern Tamaulip~s, perhaps in other areas yet to be discovered, agricul~ture was
introduced before the end of Archaic times, as shown by the
discovery of large amounts of primitive races of maize pre-.
served in dry cave deposits. ~Where such preservation is
lacking it is difficult to determine whether agriculture was
present or not, for there were no farming implements of
imperishable nature to provide even indirect evidence. In
Texas. so far as known, no agriculture was practiced before
pottery was made; tt~at is, it belongs in the next or NeoAmerican Stage. While the atlatl and dart was the common
weapon of Archaic people everywhere, the bow and arrow
was widely adopted not long after the time of Christ, as
seen in the appearance of small, thin, light stone points over
tremendous areas. In some parts of Texas, such small projectile points appear somewhat in advance of pottery, which
is t.o say that, if pottery is the chief criterion for the NeoAmerican Stage, the bow and arrow must have appeared
before the end of Archaic times. However, it was a recent
acquisition in terms of the several thousand years that the
Archaic Stage must have lasted in Texas as well as elsewhere. Its beginning may be estimated at between 4000

2O

Texas Archeological Society

and 3000 B. C., and its end somewhere between 0 and 1000
A. D., depending upon the time of appearance of pottery in
different parts of Texas.
3. The Neo~American Stage includes cultural manifestations which possessed pottery (whether made locally or acquired by trade) ; small, light arrow points; and agriculture
of a more developed nature than that of the late Archaic
Stage. Usually a still greater refinement of artifacts accompanies these traits; houses were often large and well built,
located in permanent settlements; earthworks were erected
for ceremonial purposes in the Eastern United States (including East Texas); ceremonial objects used in rituals,
dances, prayers, and sacrifices appear; some sites were quite
large and became ceremonial or trading centers; and withal
a level of culturai development was reached in Some regions
which may be called civilization (which, literally, means
life in cities, with specialization of labor and social stratification). Arts and crafts were more highly developed than
before, due to greater security of food supply and more
leisure time. Not only was pottery one of the worldâ€™s great
inventions, but some Indian groups exercised a great deal of
ingenuity in creating new and pleasing forms and design
conceptions as this stage went on.
In Texas archeology we have several anomalous situations in which it is difficult to assign a particular complex
to a late phase of the Archaic Stage or to the Neo-American.
That is, they do not show, as yet, clear evidence of whether
the three institutions--pottery-making, agricultures and bow
and arrow--appeared simultaneously or with some time differentials between them. We have done about all that could
be done under the circumstances--placed the cultural units
in a Neo-American Stage if they showed the presence of any
two of these three developments. Future research may prove
these decisions wrong in some cases; in most, they should be
confirmed and amplified.
4. The Historic Stage is used to embrace all remains
associated with objects of European or modern American

In~roductio~

origin, such as metal, glass, porcelain, etc. The presence of
such tangible objects is the only practical way we have of
proving that a given archeological complex belongs to a time
Â¯ of contact (direct or indirect) with members of the white
race. This, lzowever, was seldom the first such contact, for
many of the earlier explorers passed through certain areas,
meeting and conversing with the Indians, obtaining food and
travel directions from them, claiming the area in the name
of their King~ and so on, but leaving practically nothing
among them that can be recovered by archeologists. With
the establishment of trading posts and missions, trade was
carried on with Indians, so that they obtained European
articles in some quantity, leaving them about their villages
or placing them in graves. Thus, the firs~ contacts made no
appreciable effect on native life, and only gradually did sufficient change come about to mark a separate "stage" of
culture., lYfany archeolbgica! complexes, although they may
have existed after the discovery of America--~.yen as much
as two or three centuries after Columbus in some cases-therefore remained in the Neo-American Stage until evidence of white contact can be picked up. As this contact
increased, the native Indians abandoned some of their weapons, tools,, and utensils, substituting steel arrow points for
stone, iron knives and axes for flint and polished stone, glass
beads for shell pendants and bead,s, copper or iron buckets
for pottery cooking jars, and so on.
We have discussed the Historic Stage only very briefly
in the various sections of Texas, first because such sites are
very rare in Texas compared with those of the Archaic and
Neo-American Stages, and second, because a great deal of
documentary research remains to be done in connecting such"
sites with specific tr~bes existing in definite locations during
definite dates. Where we have felt that such connections
can.be made, we h~ve noted the tribal names.

It must be pointed out that the above ".stages" are of
the most general nature. The traits of any stage may and

22

Texas Archeological Society

commonly do continue into the next one. A stage is therefore recognized by the new elements which appear, regardless of how many older ones continue. At the same time, the
four stages mark a series of developments in economic evolution, increasing exploitation of the environment for new
and more varied foods, increasing population density and
size of villages, increasing social stratification and specialization of labor, and with the exception of the Historic
Stage--by increasing development of arts and crafts. In
the last stage there was a general breakdown of native culture everywhere, in great part due to the terrible decimations of smallpox, when most tribes lost from half to threequarters or more of their numbers; in part to the intertribal
wars which were fostered and encouraged by the white man
in order to help the Indian to destroy himself; in part .to
the white manâ€™s own warfare to take away the Indianâ€™s
lands;.and in part to substitution of the white manâ€™s weapons,
tools, and utensils for those of native origin.
Furthermore, each stage may have begun at a different
time in one area from that in another. The Neo-American
Stage, for example, probably began at different times in
Texas, according to the source of the influences which
brought agriculture, pottery-making, and bow and arrow,
not to mention the many other traits which accompanied
these three in the course of normal diffusion. Thus, the
Neo-American Stage was instituted in far western Texas
by influences from cultures already well established in New
Mexico and Chihuahua; in the upper Panhandle from cultures already well established in the Great Plains and northern New Mexico; in North-Central Texas from the Great
Plains of Oklahoma and Kansas; in East Texas from the
general lower Mississippi Valley region (at least in part).,
and possibly by migration from the Middle American province. In Central, Coastal and Southwest Texas, agriculture has not been proved present prior to establishment of
Spanish missions in the 18th century, when the friars specifically state in several instances that they taught the Indians to plant and irrigate. The origins of arrow-point

Introduction

styles and ceramics in Central and Coastal Texas have not
been traced satisfactorily in any specific direction as yet, except for obvious trade pieces. Thus, even within the boundaries of Texas alone, the onset of a Neo-American Stage
may differ by as much as a thousand years in one section
or another.
It remains to define certain cultural terms used throughout this work. These are:
Site: !~uy place ~revealing occupation by human beings.
There may have been more than one occupation, superimposed in vertical order, or overlapping horizontal.ly. Sites
may-,be open camps, caves or ro~ck shelters,-mounds, pict0,
graphs, bedrock ,mortar holes, pr burial areas. Burials may
sometimes be isolated, away from an occupation area., and
while not technically sites, are evidence of occupation nearby.
Focus: One or more sites consistently revealing similar culture traits. These are seldom identical, especially over large
areas, but provide complexes of traits which, taken as a
whole, are distinct from other such combinations; in other
words, "they reveal thematerial-culture remains of similar
people .living ~iuring a limited time span. One focus may
change into another in the same area.
omponent: A site, or part of a site, which reveals the remains of a single focus..
Aspect: A grouping of loci which contain a number of culture traits in common, bind~ing them more closely together
than with the ioci of another aspect.. These foci may occupy
adjacent areas and be more or less contemporaneous with
one another~ or they rhay follow one another in time within
the same. general area. In some cases there are both hori-.
zon~al and vertical relationships between the loci of one as:.
pect. A focus may be a mixture of-traits, so that it is difficult
to place within one aspect or another. This isâ€™ sometimes
"solved" by assigning the focus to one aspect rather than another on the bas~s of themajority of its traits; however, we

24

Texas ArcheoZogical Society

prefer to describe these situations as mixtures rather than to
force decisions where they are far from clear.
Phase: This has two meanings. In the original McKern or
Midwestern System of classifying cultural units, a "Phase" is
a grouping of aspects which show important traits in common, in distinction to other such groupings. This process
has caused so much difference of opinion among archeologists that it has now been virtually abandoned. The second
meaning is that of a slight change in culture which took place
during the life-span of a given focus. Thus, One speaks of an
"early phase" or a "late phase" of a focus. The authors have
used "phase" in this latter sense.
Pattern: In the McKern System, a "pattern" is a major cultural division, a grouping of "phases" in the first sense men:
tioned above. In North America as a whole there would be
only a very few patterns: the Archaic would be one (at
least in the Eastern United States) ; the Woodland and Mississippian cultures in the Eastern United States would
provide two others; and probably the Puebloan and Hohokam cultures of the Southwest would provide others (in
which case the Anasazi and Mogollon would be separate
"phases" of the "Puebloan Pattern").
Culture: This is always used loosely by archeologists to embrace almost any kind of complex, from focus to pattern.
Probably it should be confined to the largest groupings or
conceptions, such as "pattern". Thus, one may speak of a
Woodland, Mississippian, or Puebloan "culture", within
which there are various subdivisions such as aspects and
loci.
We present this Introductory Handbook, then, as (I) a
general summary of what is fairly well known in Texas
archeology, and (2) as a sort of manual which we hope will
be used for identifying various culture complexes and individual types of pottery and projectile points in collections
everywhere. As such, it is merely a starting point for more
intensive and exact research.

TRANS-PECOS AREA
Little evidence of the Paleo-American Stage in TransPecos Texas has been found, although remains of late Pleistocene fauna have been reported. Lack of data on early
occupation of this region is due perhaps to insufficient
reconnaissance, and intensive search for Paleo-American
sites is likely to be fruitful.
Principally for clarity of presentation, archeological
manifestations post-dating the Pleistocene have been divided into two groups. In the western portion of TransPecos Texas from E1 Paso to the Guadalupe Mountains ~n
the east and southward down the Rio Grandevalley to th~
Rio C0nchos are sites either of Puebloan occupation or
strongly influenced by Puebloan culture, The southeastern
part of Trans-Pecos Texas, much less influenced by Puebloan culture, includes the Big Bend region and lower Pecos
River drainage. Virtually nothing is known of the remainder of the Pecog River valley in Texas and the area east of the
Guadalupe Mountains. The following chart lists and aligns

Western Trans-Pecos Texas
In south-central New Mexico, northwestern Texas, and
the adjacent portion of Chihuahua are sites of the Jornada
Branch of the Mogollon--a cultural sequence of relatively
long duration defined by Donald J. Lehmer (1948). The
Jornada Branch has been traced through a developmental
sequence beginning with a late Archaic phase1 (Hueco) and
progressing through a series of successive phases (Mesilla,
Dona Ana, and E1 Paso) of the Neo-American Stage. The
pottery and house structures of the Jornada Branch clearly
indicate that this Branch is a southward extension of Puebloan culture. We include Mogollon in the general term
"Puebloan culture".
Beginning with the Mesilla Phase there is an expansion
southward down the Rio Grande valley by sedentary agriculturalists of the Jornada Branch. Between A. D. 1100
and A. D. 1400 many farming villages of the Dona Ana and E1
Paso Phases were established in the Rio Grande valley,
reaching at least as far south as the head of El Cajon, a
canyon located about 125 miles down the Rio Grande from
E1 Paso (Kelley, 1952, p. 361). Possibly because of unfavorable climatic factors and/or raids by nomadic groups,
the entire area occupied by Jornada peoples was suddenly
abandoned shortly after A. D. 1400.
Archeological remains of the Neo-American and Historic Stages in the Rio Grande valley south of El Cajon have
been grouped into the Bravo Valley Aspect (Kelley, et al,
1940). The Bravo Valley people were sedentary agriculturalists and their culture seems to have been a marginal
manifestation of the Jornada Branch and related traditions
of the Southwest, with an admixture of traits which may
have been derived from a local Archaic and/or diffused from
areas to the north and east. La Junta, the eartiest of the
Bravo Valley foci, is entirely prehistoric (being dated at
A. D. 1200-1400) and has evidence of a close relationship
I. The term â€™~phase" is here roughly equivalent to a "focus" of the McKern
classification system, but since "phase" is more commonly used in Southwestern clasaification it is retained for complexes which represent extensions of Puebloan cultur~

Trans-Pecos Area

29

with the Jornada Branch,â€™ particularly the E1 Paso Phase.
The Concepci6n Focus which seems to have developed out
of the La Junta Focus extends into historic times, thus
bridging the Neo-American and Historic Stages.
Contacts with Western European culture, begun in the
late 16th century with the Spanish explorations and continued to the present time, ushered in the Historic Stage
and resulted in accretions to the aboriginal culture. The
four latest loci of the Bravo Valley Aspect trace this development by gradual stages, from the purely native culture
of the early Concepci6n Focus through the Conchos and
Alamito Foci to the present day population, termed Presidio
Focus.
Southeastern Trans-Pecos Texas
In the southeastern portion of Trans-Pecos Texas, the
Archaic Stage is represented by three poorly known lithic
complexes and the Big Bend Aspect. Indications of a relatively early appearance of the Archaic Stage in this portion
of Texas consists of the Maravillas and Santiago complexes.
A third lithic complex, the Red Bluff, is included in this
group, but the temporal relationship of the Red Bluff to the
Maravillas, Santiago, and other Archaic complexes is not
known. Present data pertaining to these three complexes
are extremely scarce, however, and no accurate statements
regarding artifact inventories or distributions are possible
at this time.
Two foci, Pecos River and Chisos, have been recognized
as comprising the Big Bend Aspect. The Pecos River Focus
is known principally from a number of excavated rockshelters in the vicinity of the lower Pecos River, although
components have been reported as far west as the Big Bend
region. Lithic artifacts, particularly dart point types, suggest that affiliations of the Pecos River Focus lie predominately with the Edwards Plateau Aspect to the east. Known
Chisos Focus components are located in mountainous areas
west of the Pecos. Chisos Focus is essentially an Archaic
complex, like the Pecos River Focus, but stratigraphic evi-

Texas Archeological Society

dence and the occurrence of intrusive pottery (which could
hardly have been acquired before A. D. 1200) in the upper
levels of Chisos components indicate that it is later, at least
in part, than the Pecos River Focus. Broad similarities between Chisos Focus and Archaic complexes to the west,
notably with the Hueco Phase, have been observed.
Little is known about the Neo-American Stage in the
southeastern portion of Trans-Pecos Texas, the only complex which has been recognized thus far being the Livermore Focus. This focus, however, is known from only one
occupational site, a component near Alpine which has an
admixture of Chisos Focus material (Kelley, et al, 1940,
p. 87). Detailed descriptions and accurate cultural and
temporal placement of the Livermore Focus must await
further research. Additional work will probably result in
the recognition of other Neo-American complexes in this
portion of Texas.
In historic times, from the 16th century on, large portions of Trans-Pecos Texas were inhabited by nomadic
hunting tribes such as Apaches and Tobosos. Virtually no
archeological remains have been attributed to them, but a
few crevice burials and pictographs showing horses and guns
probably should be. The Jumanos, Sumas, and Chisos tribes
were found to be settled agriculturalists along the Rio
Grande and Conchos Rivers by 16th century Spanish explorers and are thus involved in the development of the
Bravo Valley Aspect; other members Of these tribes, away
from the large and fertile valleys, probably were nomadic
hunters. Little has been published on these tribes and
their cultures to clarify the historic archeological picture.
Broad historical developments in Trans-Pecos Texas are
fairly clear, but many details cannot be accurately filled
in at present. Carefully controlled excavations with particular attention to the stratigraphic distribution of artifacts
are vital to the solution of most current problems. In general, there are two lines of investigation of prime importance: (1) more accurate determination of focal artifact

Trans-Pecos Area

31

invento~ries, and (2) relationships of one complex to another, both in time and space.
PALEO-AMERICAN STAGE
No sites of the Paleo-American Stage, nor any artifacts
which can be attributed to this stage have been reported
in Trans-Pecos Texas. Extensive reconnaissance in Pleistocene deposits may, however, uncover evidence of an early
occupation in this portion of Texas.
WESTERN TRANS-PECOS AREA
ARCHAIC STAGE
Hueco Phase
This phase was first described systematically by E. B.
Sayles (1935) who termed it the Hueco Cave Dweller, to
distinguish it from the Big Bend (now Chisos Focus) and
Pecos River (now Pecos River Focus) Cave Dwellers. In
general, subsequent work of C. B. Cosgrove and Donald J.
Lehmer has sUpported Saylesâ€™ three-fold division, although
a comprehensive comparison of these "Cave Dwellers" is
badly needed. Sharing of traits is most evident in basketry,
matting, wooden utensils, and other artifacts of a perishable
nature. Actually the problem is a far-reaching one, for it
involves similar material found over a large portion of the
western United States.
The Hueco Phase, like other early branches, of the
Mogollon, seems to have developed out of the widely distributed "Cochise Culture". During the latter portion of
its existence, the Hueco Phase received pottery from peoples
to the northwest and gradually developed and differentiated
into the Mesilla Phase and the closely related Capitan Phase
of southeastern New Mexico.

NEO-AMERICAN STAGE
Mesilla Phase
The incipent development of the Neo~American Stage
began in the latter part of the Hueco Phase, as evidenced
by the appearance of agriculture and small quantities of
pottery. These new traits spread in popularity and were
supplemented by other innovations so that a Neo-American
complex, termed the Mesilla Phase, gradually emerged out
of the old Archaic pattern of the Hueco Phase.
Sites of the Mesilla Phase, which contain pit houses
and an abundance of pottery, are known from surface collections in southeastern New Mexico and the adjacent portion of Texas, and from work at Los Tules, the principal
excavated component. The following characterization, of
the Mesilla Phase is based mainly upon Lehmerâ€™s list of
traits at Los Tules (Lehmer, 1948, pp. 13-34):
COMPONENTS:
Type Component: Los Tules Site, on the Rio Grande
just above the Mesilla Dam, excavated in 1940 by
the Arizona State Museum and the Museum of New
Mexico, under the direction of Donald J. Lehmer.
Excavated Components: At the La Cueva Site, near
Las Cruces, New Mexico, El Paso Brown pottery found
in the lower levels of a test pit suggest an occupation
by the Mesilla Phase.
TYPES OF SITES:
Villages of small pithouses, with refuse scattered over
the site.
HOUSES:
Pithouses varying considerably in depth. Unaltered
bottom of the pit served as the floor; pit walls not
plastered except in one instance.
Superstructure~
probably made of poles laid on heavier framework
and covered with grass thatch. The houses can be
divided into two types, circular and rectangular. Fea,

Trans-Pecos Area

tures of rectangular houses include sloping entrance,
leading from east or southeast; and main roof supports in the corners and at the centers of the shorter
sides. Posts at the ends of the long axis suggest a
central beam which formed the ridgepole of a peaked
roof. As a group, the rectangular houses are smaller
than the circular ones.
Circular houses are characterized by the absence of
any trace of a doorway (a hatchway may have been
used as an entrance); primary interior roof supports
in the center, so the walls sloped in from the rim of
the pit to the roof. Fire areas occur consistently in
rectangular houses but rarely in circular ones. One
circular pithouse at the Los Tules site was exceptionally deep, with a bench 45 cm~ wide encircling
the wall 1 meter above the floor. There was an unusual posthole arrangement, suggesting that this particular structure may have served a different purpose
from the other circular pithouses.
STORAGE PITS:
Located inside and outside the houses; shapes of pits
are oval, circular or irregular. Circular and .oval pits
are undercut, while irregular pits have straight sides.
Depths range from 30 to 75 cm,; width across opening range from 43 to 75 cm. Pits contain refuse.
LIVELIHOOD:
Agriculture inferred, supplemented by hunting and
gathering.
CERAMIC TRAITS:
Pottery Types: El Paso Brown.
Temper: Angular fragments of limestone and quartz.
Decoration:
Typically undecorated; v e r y rarely
sherds have black or red painted design, foreshadowing the development of El Paso Polychrome. Oc-

Texas Archeological Society

casionally shreds show gouging, punching, and incising.
Forms: Jars without necks, and rarely bowls.
Scraping tools made from potsherds.
OTHER ARTIFACTS OF CHIPPED STONE (uncommon):
Projectile Points:
Arrow Points (no named types): Long, thin, slender
triangular points, with straight and concave bases;
also triangular points with side notches and expanding stem with concave base.
Dart Points:
Phase.

Possibly carry-overs from the Hueco

Knives: Oval, percussion-chipped.
Scrapers: Side (not as frequent as sherd scrapers).
ARTIFACTS OF GROUND STONE:

a distinct pit on one face; occasionally wedge-shaped.
Milling stones:

Stone bowls with incised decorations.

ARTIFACTS OF POLISHED STONE:
Turquoise, polished and perforated for suspension.
Incised pendants.
ARTIFACTS OF BONE:
Awls made from splinters.

from transverse segments of long bone of some large
animal.

ARTIFACTS OF SHELL:

Site. Sporadically, El Paso Brown occurs in the Big
Bend region.
ESTIMATED AGE:
A. D. 900-1100 (Lehmer, 1948, p. 89).
S~URCES:
Lehmer, 1948.
Dona Ana Phase
The short-lived Dona Ana Phase is transitional between
the Mesilla and El Paso Phases. The persistence of pithouses and El Paso Brown pottery indicate a direct linear
descent from the Mesilla Phase. Such traits as surface
houses and painted pottery were evidently borrowed from
Afiasazi groups to the north and from the Mimbres people
already in the Jornada area to the west (Lehmer, 1948,
pp. 78-80).
Expansion of the Jornada Branch down the Rio Grande
valley, begun during the Mesilla Phase, was continued in
Dona Ana times (Kelley, 1952, p. 361). Cultural relations
also extended over a wider area than in the earlier phases
of the Jornada Branch, for intrusive pottery types furnish
evidence of contact with the Zu5i district, and the Mimbres,
Three Rivers, and Cedarvale Phases.

Texas Archeological Society

Since no Dona Ana sites have been excavated, this phase
is known solely from surface collections, which consist almost entirely of pottery.
COMPONENTS:
None excavated; however test pits at the La Cueva Site,
near Las Cruces, New Mexico, indicate that a Dona
Ana occupation succeeded the Mesilla Phase at that
site.
TYPES OF SITES:
Appear to be small villages composed of pithouses and
surface structures.
HOUSES:
Pithouses and adobe-walled surface structures with contiguous rooms.
LIVELIHOOD:
Probably same as Mesilla Phase.
CERAMIC TRAITS:
Pottery types: El Paso Brown (similar to Mesilla Phase
with modification of rim), and El Paso Polychrome.
ARTIFACTS OF GROUND STONE:
Arrow-shaft tools: Straighteners and abraders.

El Paso Phase

At about A. D. 1100, influences from the !knasazi or
northern division of the Puebloan culture1 began to be felt
by peoples of the southern or Mogollon division--more specifically, by the Jornada Branch with which we are here
concerned. Many of the older cultural patterns were now
markedly altered. Although the reasons are not clear, a
number of population movements are evident in the Southwest during the 12th and 13th centuries.
The E1 Paso Phase appears to be the result of such
movements or i.nfluences extending down the Rio Grande
valley in southern New Mexico and western Texas. The
phase was first defined by Sayles (1935) and later supplemented by the work of Mrs. Glen E. Moore (1947) and
Donald J. Lehmer (1948). The artifacts are derived directly
from the Dona Ana Phase, with a few changes and additions.
A southward expansion, probably initiated during the
Mesilla Phase, was continued by agriculturalists of the E1
Paso Phase, who established villages on alluvial terraces
along the Rio Grande. This Puebloan-derived culture spread
as far south as the Presidio vicinity at the Rio Conchos
entry, and perhaps up the Conchos from there. In the Presidio area the La Junta Focus of the Bravo Valley Aspect
represents this southward thrust; however, the Bravo Valley
Aspect itself represents a distinct cultural development
which only borrowed part of the Puebloan traits of the
Jornada Branch, particularly of the E1 Paso Phase.
Shortly after A. D. 14{}0, the E1 Paso Phase seems to
have disappeared rather suddenly. Climatic changes may
have forcdd migration to other regions, or the pressure of
nomadic invaders may have been responsible. Perhaps
both factors operated. !k similar situation obtained widely
i~ the Southwest at about this time, for reasons which
warrant close study.
1. We use "Puebloan" here in the same sense as Reed (1946, 1952).
The Auasazl
is the northern division of this great culture pattern, from Basket Maker t~mes t~
the l~resent. "Phe Magollon is the southern division, beginning by about B. C. 40~) nr
300, and continuing until 1400 or 14/;0, by which time the whole southern region was
practically abandoned by agricultural Indians. Presumably the nomadic in~â€™aders from
the north, mainly the Apache tribes, were responsible for much of this abandonment

for they were found in possession by the early Spanish explorers.

Bravo Valley Aspect
Largely through the work of J. Charles Kelley, five
loci, La Junta, ConcepciSn, Conchos, Alamito, and Presidio,
have been recognized as comprising the Bravo Valley Aspect. This aspect is a marginal manifestation of Puebloan
culture which appears to represent local groups who also
borrowed a number of traits from their neighbors to the
south and west (Kelley, 1952). The earliest focus of the
Bravo Valley Aspect, La Junta, was contemporaneous with
the E1 Paso Phase, while other loci of this aspect date from
about A. D. 1400 to the present. Only the La Junta Focus
is entirely prehistoric, the ConcepciSn having evidence of
European contact toward its end. The following period of
increasing acculturation of the native culture has been
termed the Conchos Focus. Since the Presidio and Alamitos
are modern, they will not be considered here.
With respect to the La Junta, ConcepciSn, and Conchos
Foci, house styles and pottery types are the main differentiating features; most other traits appear to be shared. To
avoid needless repetition the traits common to all three loci
will be characterized first, then the traits tentatively assigned to each focus will be listed separately.
COMPONENTS:
Centered in the Rio Grande valley, in the vicinity of
Presidio, Texas.
TYPES OF SITES:
Rockshelters and small caves in tuff cliffs; pithouses,
often marked by surface depressions and large middens; and surface houses, sometimes indicated by partially standing walls. Villages known, but detailed
descriptions lacking.
HOUSES:
Pithouses vary from one focus to another, but were

Early Lithic Complexes of the Big Bend
To be briefly considered in this group are three lithic
complexes, the Maravillas, Santiago, and Red Bluff. Stratigraphic evidence at the Calamity Creek Site in Brewste~"
County (Kelley, et al, 1940, pp. 107-119) indicates that Maravillas is older than the Santiago, but, as yet, the Red Bluff
has not been found in any context that clarifies its chronological relationship to the other two. These Archaic complexes are known from only a few projectile points, scrapers,
knives, blades and grinding implements. Available data
indicate that Maravillas and Santiago antedate the big Bend

Aspect, and thus, are the earliest known archeological manifestations in the Big Bend region. It seems likely, however,
that further work in extreme western Texas may find evidence of the Paleo-American Stage, which to date has been
notably absent in that region. An accurate interpretation
of the Maravillas, Santiago, and Red Bluff complexes will
not be possible until additional excavations give a better
representation of the artifact assemblage and distribution of
these complexes.
SOURCES:
Kelley, et al, 1940.
Pecos River Focus (Big Bend Aspect)
The Pecos River Focus is the earliest manifestation of
the Big Bend Aspect. This focus is best known and characterized from rockshelter sites, although open campsites
are known. The combination of aridity and occurence of
archeological material in rockshelters is conductive to the
preservation of such items as clothing, basketry, matting,
wooden implements, etc., which do not survive under ordinary circumstances. Consequently, many of the artifacts
from these sites provide data on aboriginal technology and
enable a fairly accurate cultural reconstruction. Pictographs on the rockshelter walls, while not unique in the
Pecos River Focus, are unexceptionally well represented.
Many of the pictographs consist of conventionalized human
and animal figures.
Similarities between Pecos River and Basketmaker artifacts have been pointed out. While basketry, matting, sandals, and other perishable items are reminiscent of Basketmaker material the resemblance seems to be largely superficial and there is probably little direct relationship between the two complexes. Relationships, especially lithic
artifacts, appear to lie to the east with the Edwards Plateau
Aspect.

lechuguilla and sotol; rectangular in shape with a
squared toe, Usually consist of two opposing warp

Chisos Focus (Big Bend Aspect)

are many sites of the Chisos Focus. Like the Pecos River
Focus, it is best known and characterized from rockshelter
occupations, although Chisos components have been found

57

Many traits of the Chisos Focus are shared with the
Hueco Phase of the Jornada Branch to the north and.vcest.
and, to a lesser extent, with the Pecos River Focus to the
east. The Chisos Focus appears to be roughly contemporaneous with the Hueco Phase and, despite a slight time
overlap, later than the Pecos River Focus. Although it is
essentially an Archaic complex, intrusive Southwestern pottery types, evidence of agriculture, and possibly the bow and
arrow occur in the upper levels of Chisos components, suggesting that in the later part of this focus there were contacts with Neo-American groups to the northwest.

NEO-AMERICAN STAGE
Livermore Focus
The only known complex in central and southeastern

Texas Archeological Society

6O

Trans-Pecos Texas which might be placed in our NeoAmerican Stage has been called the Livermore Focus. This
"focus" is based almost entirely on the presence, in the
Davis Mountains area, of a single arrow-point type known
as the Livermore point. There is but one excavated component. Another component is not an occupation site, but
a large cache of these distinctive points on the top of Mt.
Livermore, the highest peak of the Davis Mountains (James,
1930, pp. 8-9).
This complex has as yet no evidence of agriculture or
indigenous pottery. Its placement in the Neo-American
Stage is therefore a questionable procedure, based entirely
on the assumption that there is a distinctive complex dominated by small arrow points. Other stone artifacts, few in
number, and trade pottery of El Paso Polychrome appear
to show a link with Chisos Focus. Chisos Focus is said to
have agricultural products in its "latest" components, and
conversely, to have few if any small arrow points. Little
sense can be made of such a situation with present information.
It has been suggested that Livermore Focus first appeared while the Pecos River Focus still existed (before 900
A. D.), then continued to co-exist with the Chisos Focus, and
finally was succeeded by the Bravo Valley Aspect (Kelley,
et al, 1940, p. 163). We fail to see how such a nebulous
"focus" can be interpreted as covering such a long time span.
It is further suggested that "the Livermore culture" represents an intrusion of Plains hunting people into Trans-Pecos
Texas, who might thus have been responsible for the appearance of certain "Plains traits" which appear in the
Bravo Valley Aspect (Kelley, 1952, p. 359). The traits are
not itemized, nor is it explained why they could not have
reached Trans-Pecos Texas by normal diffusion from the
southern Plains.
COMPONENTS:
Type component: Alpine 2:7, Brewster County, excavated in 1938 by J. Charles Kelley for the West Texas

ESTIMATED AGE:
A. D. 800- 1200 (Kelley, et al., 1940, p. 163). The present
authors see no reason to set the date earlier than
~bout A. D. 1200-1400, since this is the date given by
Kelley for the La Junta Focus, which lies to the west
and also contains El Paso Polychrome. The apparent
lack of agriculture cannot be taken to give an early
date if the E1 Paso ware is associated with the Livermore points.

HISTORIC STAGE
No complexes have been accurately defined for Indian
cultures within the Historic Stage in all of Trans-Pecos
Texas, except for those of the Bravo Valley Aspect in the
vicinity of Presidio, namely, the ConcepciSn and Conchos
Foci. Sayles (1935) defined a Lipan Phase for Trans-Pecos
Texas, but it was not formulated from cultural material
found on sites identifiable with the Lipanes or "Lipan
Apache", and many of its traits are identical to those in his
Hueco and Pecos River Cave Dweller phases. The Tobosos,
Chisos, Jumano, and other tribes inhabited this section of
Texas in the 16th century, so that camp material and artifacts, even if they come from sites with European trade
materials, can hardly be lumped under a single label "Lipan". As in other parts of Texas, research in historical
archeology is badly needed.

PANHANDLE-PLAINS AREA
This includes all of the Llano Estacado in Texas, as well
as lower plains on the eastern side of the Panhandle, and
extends southward where the Llano Estacado gradually descends into the lower plains of the Edwards Plateau. Most
of the evidence of a Paleo-American Stage from excavated
sites in Texas comes from the Llano Estacado. The thousands of playa lakes of that region, where now-extinct Pleistocene fauna watered, contain beds of fossil bones in which
are found dart points and butchering implements of PaleoAmerican hunters. Some of these lake beds no longer hold
water and are undergoing extensive wind and water erosion.
These ancient lake deposits have yielded hundreds--perhaps thousands--of Paleo-American artifacts to collectors
who patiently follow the progress of erosion and watch for
fresh exposures. Surface collections contain a few points
possibly of the two Sandia types, and these must be very
rare (if present at all). Ample numbers of points of the
Clovis, FoIsom, PIainview, Scottsblu]f, Eden, Angostura
(Long), and related forms not yet analyzed typologically
are known in private and institutional collections but cannot be described here. In the section below the excavated
sites of the Pleistocene age are briefly described.
Beyond the sporadic occurrence of a variety of stemmed
dart points in surface collections from sites of this area
which seem not to include pottery, there are no data concerning the Archaic Stage, either on the Llano Estacado or
on the adjoin.ing lower plains. We thus have the peculiar
circumstance of a gap in our knowledge of several thousand
years between the Paleo-American and Neo-American
Stages. The de~finition of cultural remains in this gap is an
important future problem for Texas archeology.

For the Neo-American Stage only one complex, the
Antelope Creek Focus, has been formally defined. The
sites of this focus, which is a blending of Plains agricultural
and hunting economy with masonry of Puebloan derivation,
occur along the Canadian River and its numerous short
tributaries. On the eastern side of the Panhandle, on the

64

Texas Archeological Society

low plains, are a number of small sites which have the same
cordmarked cooking pottery and stone artifacts of the Antelope Creek Focus, but there is no evidence of masonry
architecture.
On the Llano Estacado south of the Canadian River
valley are numerous sites around the larger, permanent
lakes, and on the edges of dune fields where the sand retains rainwater and agriculture can be practiced without
irrigation. Such sites are not closely connected with those
of Antelope Creek Focus. They commonly include potsherds
of many Puebloan types dating from about A. D. 1100 to 1800
or even later. In the spots where farming could have been
practiced, ~some such sites may represent actual occupation
by Puebloan peoples, driven eastward into the plains by
wars or overpopulation (Krieger, 1946, pp. 75-82). On the
other hand, some sites with small amounts of Puebloan pottery must represent temporary camps of Indians who went
on annual bison hunts from the pueblos of the Northern Rio
Grande Valley. Still other camps may be those of indigenous tribes which, like those of Antelope Creek Focus, received Puebloan pottery by trade from the west. Still further material of Puebloan origin, as well as that of indigenous peoples, may be found around lake beds in the extreme
southern part of this area, east and southeast of the southeastern corner of New Mexico. Needless to say, some very
important cultural complexes should be defined when excavations and analyses can be made for this region.
The Historic Stage is represented in the PanhandlePlains principally by bison-hunting nomads, such as those
met by the Coronado expedition in 1541, who followed the
general pattern of life of historic Plains Indians except, of
course, that they had no horses until much later. Puebloan
Indians from north-central New Mexico continued their
bison-hunting expeditions until the bison became extinct in
this area in the 1870â€™s.
PALEO-AMERICAN STAGE
The sites of this stage in which controlled excavations
have been made are listed below. The reader should con-

Panhandle-P~ains Area

sult the works cited for more details. Most of the speci.mens which we now identify as Clovis points were called
"Folsom," "Folsom-like" "Folsomoid", or "Generalized Folsom" in the original literature, whereas others correctly retain FoIsom as the type name.
Miami Site, Roberts County. Located on C. R. Cowan
ranch, 9 miles northwest of Miami, Texas. Remains of Columbia mammoth found in deposits which filled a former
water-hole or pond. Three Clovis points and a scraper were
in direct association with the mammo~th.. Site first excavated in 1934 by Judge J. A. Mead and others, later by the
University of Texas under direction of Glen L. Evans and
E. H. Sellards (Sellards, 1938, pp, 999-1009; 1952, ppl 18-29).
Lipscomb Site, Lipscomb County. Pleistocene lake bed
site 11 miles southwest of Lipscomb, Texas. Extinct bison
the principal fauna. Eighteen points of Folsom type, two
scrapers, a flake knife, and a channel flake in association
with the bison. Excavated in 1939 by C. Bertrand Schultz
for Nebraska â€™State Museum (Schultz, 1943, pp. 242:249;
Wormington, 1949, p. 33; Sellards, 1932, pp. 58-59).
Lubbock Site, Lubbock County. A stratified deposit in
Yellowhouse Draw, within the city limits of Lubbock, was
excavated by the Texas Memorial Museum in 1948, 1950,
and 1951. Of the five strata recognized, the next to oldest
one produced charred bones of extinct bison, four fluted
Folsom points, one side scraper, and flint chips (Sellards,
1952, pp. 52-54, Fig. 24). A radiocarbon age determination
was obtained on this charred bone of 9,883 Ã· -- 350 years,
which is now widely accepted as proving that Folsom artifacts are approximately 10,000 years old.
PIainview Site, Hale County. An extensive fossil bed
cont.aining remains of extinct l~ison (estimated at more
than 100 animals) discovered in a gra~vel quarry within city
limits of Plainview. During excavation by the Texas .~iemorial Museum in. i945, eighteen projectile points of the
Plainview type, and both side and end scrapers, were found
in association with the bison. The bone bed had beencoy-

66

Texas ArcheoIogical Society

ered with elever~ feet of gravel and wind-blown sand. This
is the type site for the PIainview point (Sellards, Evans,
Meade, and Krieger, 1947, pp. 927-954).
Colorado City Site, Mitchell County. A fossil bed containing extinct bison~bones, on the banks of Lone Wolf Creek
near Colorado City, Texas, was excavated by Hay and Cook
in 1924. Three projectile points were found in a block of
matrix containing bison bones. One point was lost and no
adequate description is available. Another is a basal fragment of the Plainview type. The third is complete and
like Plainview except that the base is slightly convex; perhaps this is a Plainview variation (Krieger, in Sellards et al,
1947). The latter specimen may also be of a type found recently in the Portales Complex (Sellards, 1952).
" Scharbauer Site~ .,Midland County. In July, 1953, parts
of a human skull were found exposed by wind erosion in the
bottom of a sand blowout six miles south of Midland, Texas,
by an amateur archeologist, Keith Glasscock. An excavation conducted at the site in February, 1954, revealed the
geology of the sand formations and showed that the skull
may belong to a very ancient deposit. Fluorine analysis of
the human bone showed that it was contemporaneous with
the Pleistocene animals in the same deposit (mainly extinct
species of horse). In a series of five blowouts nearby, artifacts of the Folsom complex were found, in a geological
position much later than that of the human skull. An extensive publication is in press; by Wendorf, Krieger, and
others.
ARCHAIC STAGE
It has been mentioned that, although projectile, points
and probably other artifacts of the Archaic Stage occur
widely in the Panhandle-Plains area, no sites have yet been
located where a definite complex can be defined.
NEO-AMERICAN STAGE
Antelope Creek Focu~
Numerous sites which include ruins of masonry build-

Panhandle-Plains Area

67

ings along the Canadian River and its tributaries have attracted amateur and professional archeologists for years. In
1921 W. K. Moorehead published a map and brief description of some of them, pointing out similarities with architecture of the Puebloan groups of New Mexico. Excavations
conducted by Floyd V. Studer, Steward Johnston, W. C. Holden, and others have revealed much evidence as to the connections of this complex with the Great Plains and the
Southwest alike. An economy based on both hunting and
agriculture, use of bone hoe blades, cordmarked utility
pottery, triangular arrow points with side and base notches,
numerous bone and antler tools, and the absence of most
of the characteristic Puebloan artifacts, indicate that th.e
Antelope Creek Focus people reached the upper Texas Pan5
handle from the central Great Plains. In pushing south-~
ward into this area they eventually came into contact with
the Puebloan Indian culture of northern New l~Iexico, and
acquired a number of Puebloan traits such as multi-roomed
dwellings, stone house construction, and painted pottery
(which fortunately allows us to date this focus with fair
accuracy at A. D. 1300-1450).
A summary of available data on the Antelope Creek
Focus and its relationships with the Southwest, Plains, and
other parts of Texas has been given by Krieger (1946, pp.
41-74). Watson (1950) then published on the closely related Optima Focus in Oklahoma Panhandle, which shows
a somewhat less developed use of stone architecture and
closer relationships with the central Great Plains, as one
would expect. Both loci appear to have been approximately
contemporary with the Upper Republican Aspect of Kansas
and Nebraska. Krieger (1946) established the Antelope
Creek Focus as the only focus in the Panhandle Aspect,
while Watson (1950) added the Optima Focus to this Aspect.

W. C. Holden (Holden, 1930; Johnston, 1939; Krieger,
1946).
Principal Excavated CompQnents: Tarbox (Holden,
1930; Studer, 1931a; Moorehead, 1931; Holden, 1933),
Alibates (Moorehead, 1931; Mason, 1929), Ruin 55
(Studer, 1934).
TYPES OF SITES:
Villages usually situated on ridges and promontories
overlooking the Canadian River or its short tributaries; on mesa tops and small terraces with steep banks.
Convenience to fields and water secondary to wide
view and defensive features. Villages consist of multi-roomed, one-story pueblos, also scattered single
rooms. Number of houses in a village varies from
about six to as many as about eighty; no particular
plan apparent.
HOUSES:
Pueblos consist of one-story rooms. Some are rectangular or nearly square, with sides oriented approximately in the cardinal directions; others are
small, odd-shaped rooms, made by: (1) building out
from the walls of large rooms, (2) partitioning large
rooms, and (3) building across odd spaces and corners.
Presumably large rooms were dwellings, while the
smaller ones possibly served as storage bins, sleeping
quarters or workrooms. In addition to, and separate
from, the main block in each village are stone-walled
single rooms. At present it is not known whether or
not the rooms were constructed in pits.
Walls were constructed by placing large slabs vertically
in the ground so as to~ form two parallel rows, then
filling the space between the rows with adobe and
rubble; on top of this other vertically parallel stones
were mounted; each time the rows of vertical slabs
were placed closer together, and again filled with
adobe and rubble. Another method was to construct
the wall of odd-shaped stones, held together by adobe
mortar. On occasion, horizontal masonry was used,

Panhandle-Plains Area

69

particularly in corners; this is usually above an initial
course of vertical slabs. Masonry construction, however, was confined in virtually all cases to the lower
portion of the walls, the upper part of the walls and
roof evidently having been of jacal-like construction.
Usually the larger rooms, which are the best made and
follow a more definite plan, range in size from about
16 by 12 feet to 22 by 24 feet. Interior features of
such rooms include: (1) a sunken central portion
(about 6 to 10 inches deep) dividing the floor into
three nearly equal sections; (2) four central supports;
(3) a circular, plastered, or stone-lined, fire basin in
the centrally depressed middle section; (4) a long (10
to 12 feet) masonry tunnel (ventilator ?), square in
cross-section (18 to 30 inches), beginning slightly inside the room and extending eastward; (5) large slabs
serving as deflectors between the tunnel and the fire
basin; (6) occasionally two small anterooms or bins
flanking the tunnel; and (7) slabs possibly used as
covers for entrance hatches in the roof. Less frequently there are raised square or rectangular clay
banks (altars?) at the west end of the central depression; opposite the tunnel.
Entrance probably
through the roof.
STORAGE PITS:
In house floors and outside within 20 to 30 feet are
found slab-line oval and circular cists; also in floors
are circular and rectangular pits. In some instances
bell-shaped cache pits with interior plastered with
adobe.
LIVELIHOOD:
Dependence on both maize agriculture and huntinggathering. Direct evidence for maize (charred cobs).;
beans and squash inferred. Animals hunted were
mainly bison, antelope, and deer; also various small
animals and birds. Various nuts, berries, and seeds
probably utilized.

Holden, 1929, 1930, 1932, 1933; Johnston, 1939; Krieger,
1946; Mason, 1929; Moorehead, 1921, 1931; Sayles, 1935;
Studer, 1931a, 1931b, 1934; Watson, 1950; Wedel, 1947.
HISTORIC STAGE
No archeological complexes have been defined for this
stage. The whole Panhandle-Plains is singularly barren of
camp debris which can be assigned to the nomadic tribes
such as Apache, Comanche, Kiowa, and others that are
known to have inhabited it and hunted the bison. Stone
circles or "tipi rings" where stones were used to weight tipi
covers are not uncommon, but it seems to be a general rule
that nomadic hunters have left extremely few artifacts, food
remains, graves, etc., in any one place.
We know from the Coronado documents that tribes
called Querechos and Teyas were met in the present Texas
Panhandle and that they were nomads with portable skin
tipis, following the bison and living entirely from its products. Late in the 17th century the Comanche began to
spread south from eastern Wyoming and Colorado, eventually holding dominion over almost aI1 the western half
of Texas and eastern New Mexico, forcing the earlier
Querechos and Teyas (doubtlessly both Apache tribes) farther south and into Mexico. There are records of occasional
graves found in rock clefts in northwestern Texas which
have ornaments of brass, glass beads, parts of guns, knives,
etc., and it is assumed that these graves are those of the
afore-mentioned tribes. The nomadic peoples appear to
have favored using rock clefts rather than to dig graves for
their dead. Other than that, an occasional steel arrowhead,
b~ass tinkler, or glass bead is about all we have to show for
these bison-hunters for some 400 years of occupation.
No missions were ever established in this section of
Texas.

NORTH-CENTRAL AREA
Because of mergings with archeological remains in surrounding areas, it is difficult to set definite boundaries for
this part of Texas. In a general way it is marked by pottery
cultures which existed in late pre-E,uropean times, the pottery being characterized as undecorated and heavily tempered with pulverized shell (type Nocona Plain). For present purposes the boundaries are taken as the 100th meridian
on the west, the Caddoan archeological area in East Texas
on the east, marked by Lamar, Delta, and Hopkins Counties,
the Red River on the north, and a part of the upper Brazos
River valley on the south, and the upper Trinity River drainage in Tarrant, Dallas, and Kaufman Counties.
Very similar archeological materials occur in southcentral Oklahoma (Bell and Baerreis, 1951), principally in
the W~shita River valley and the Lake Texoma area. On
the other three sides there are gradual transitions into different cultural remains treated in other sections of this
volume. Trade pottery appears in the eastern part of this
area from the Caddoan archeological area (see Wylie Focus),
and trade pottery and true metates in its western part from
Pueblo Indian culture in the Southwest (see Henrietta
Focus). The native cultures of this area as a whole, however, were definitely of a Plains flavor, so that there are
more similarities with Oklahoma, Kansas, and Nebraska
than there are to the east, west, or south.
As in the other parts of Texas (except Trans-Pecos),
projectile points of types essentially belonging to ~he PaleoAmerican Stage have been found in surface collections,
sometimes mixed with material of later stages. No sites of
the Paleo-American Stage have been excavated, but the
"Lagow Sand Pit Man" provides an interesting case of ancient human remains ~(see below).
The Archaic Stage is represented by the Carrollton
and Elam Foci of Trinity Aspect; and undoubtedly other
complexes are yet to be defined. The Neo-American Stage
is represented by two loci, Henrietta and Wylie; and like-

North-Central Area

75

wise further complexes are to be expected. There are indications that certain remains along the Red River, now
included in Henrietta Focus, may provide a distinct focus
when further field work is done and strict associations can
be defined. The Bryan Focus of south-central Oklahoma
(Bell and Baerre~s, 1951) may be found to have extended
south of the Red River; the ceramics of Henrietta and Bryan
Foci are similar but not identical and other traits should
be worked out in relation to these loci or to others not yet
defined. Our knowledge of the Historic Stage is virtually
confine~l to a single large site, that of Spanish Fort, part of
which is on the Red River bank in Montague County, an~i
part on the Oklahoma bank opposite.
PALEO-AMERICAN STAGE
Witte (1942) has described a few fluted points from
what he has called Clear Fork sites (see Central Texas
Area) in the general .vicinity of the Little Wichita River
and its confluence with the Red. Other fluted points, both
Folsom and Clovis, some very small points apparently of the
Eden type, and numerous P~ainview and Meserve points
have come from surface localities in various counties. The
Plainview type also appears in a number of Carrollton
Focus components (see Archaic Stage). As in the Edwards
Plateau Aspect of Central Texas, there appears to be actual
survival of Paleo-American projectile-point types into
Archaic complexes, as well as accidental association with the
latter when ancient points were picked up by later people.
Lagow Sand Pits, Dallas County
In 1920, human bones were discovered by workmen in
a gravel deposit, with the overlying strata reported to be
undisturbed. The degree of fossilization of the human bones
appeared to be about equal to that of the fauna in the
gravel, which included mammoth, camel~ horse, bison, sabertosth cat, and other Pleistocene species. The skeletal material is so fragmentary that little can be made of the physical characteristics (Shuler, 1923). There was no evidence
of cultural material at the site. From the point of view of
Pleistocene antiquity for human skeletal remains, the Lagow

Texas Archeological Society

76

Sand Pit discovery may be compared with the recent discovery at Midland, Texas (see Panhandle-Plains Area), and
perhaps to the two mineralized skeletons reported by Ray
(1934) from near Buffalo Gap south of Abilene.
ARCHAIC STAGE
Carrollton Focus (Trinity Aspect)

The Carrollton and Elam Foci of Trinity Aspect were
recently defined by Crook and Harris (Crook, 1952; Crook
and Harris, 1952, 1954). The Aspect is known primarily in
the upper Trinity River valley, but it may extend as far
south as the Whitney Reservoir on Brazos River. The
general artifact assemblage appears most closely related to
the East Texas Aspect of the Archaic Stage, but there are
some similarities to the south with the Edwards Plateau
Aspect. All known components in the Trinity River valley
occur within the two uppermost members of the Union
Terminal--Carrollton terrace.
The following list of traits for Carrollton Focus is based
on test trenches, surface collections, and study of local collections, as compiled by Harris and Crook.
COMPONENTS:

Type Components: Wheeler Site near junction of Denton Creek and Elm Fork of Trinity River (Crook,
1952) ; and Dallas Lake Site just below old Lake Dallas Dam (Crook and Harris, 1952).
Other Components: Station 2 on Denton Creek, upstream from Wheeler Site; Station 4, below Backmanâ€™s Dam in Dallas; Station 8, near Seagoville in
southeast Dallas County; Station 10, near Trinidad,
Henderson County (Crook and Harris, 1952).
TYPES OF SITES:
Small campsites usually buried in river terrace material near small tributary streams.
HOUSES:
No data.

North-Central Area

LIVELIHOOD:
No direct evidence; hunting and gathering implied.
CERAMIC TRAITS:
Absent.
ARTIFACTS OF CHIPPED STONE:
Projectile Points:
Arrow points: Absent.
Dart points: Carrollton, T~nity, Wheeler, and Dallas
types have been described by Crook and Harris
(1952) but whether they are truly distinctive from
other types described herein is open to question.
Gary points also occur, probably including the "Denton Nub-Stemmed" of Crook and Harris. Examples
of the Clovis and Plainview types have been found
in Carrollton components, and are either survivals
of an earlier cultural stage or of secondary association (picked up by later Indians).
Choppers: Made of quartzite and characterized by
Â¯ large, crude percussion chipping.
Scrapers: Clear Fork end scrapers, roughly triangular
in outline with steeply beveled bits at the broad end;
Â¯ some have concave bits but more frequently the bits
are straight. Also flint spalls with fine flaking on
one or more edges; and large, roughly chipped side
scrapers, usually made of reddish quartzite.
Gravers and Spokeshaves:

Present.

Drills: Present, with stems similar to those of the local
dart-point types, or made from broken parts of such
dart points.
Knives: Crude, triangular in shape, chipped on both
faces. Another form in leaf-shaped and usually better made.
Axes: CarroIlton type; crudely made, double bitted with
constriction in middle, or single-bitted with constriction opposite cutting edge.
ARTIFACTS OF GROUND STONE:
"Waco Sinkers", egg-shaped stream pebbles smoothed

Texas Archeological Society

by natural wear, with notch across each end.
Manos of sandstone, one-hand size, rectangular in shape
with rounded corners. Used on either one side or
both.
Milling stones showing rotary motion.
ARTIFACTS OF POLISHED STONE:
No data:
ARTIFACTS OF SHELL, BONE, ANTLER:
No data.
MISCELLANEOUS TRAITS:
No data.
BURIAL CUSTOMS:
No data:

RELATIONS:
Sharing of certain dart-point types with East Texas Aspect to east and Edwards Plateau Aspect to south suggests contemporaneity at least in part of all three.
Carrollton type of chipped axe is similar to that of the
Fourche Maline complex of eastern Oklahoma, an
early pottery culture, suggesting either contemporancity or ancestry of Carrollton type.
ESTIMATED AGE:
2,000 to 1,000 B. C. (Crook and Harris, 1952).
SOURCES:
Crook and Harris, 1952, 1954a, 1954b; Crook, 1952.
Elam Focus (Trinity Aspect)
The Elam Focus, while closely related to the Carrollton,
is differentiated from it by dart points of smaller size, by
an evident absence of the "Waco Sinkers", and by an apparently later position as judged by correlation with stream
terraces.
COMPONENTS:
Type Components: Wood and Milton Sites in Dallas
County (Crook and Harris, 1952).

North-Central Area

79

Other Components: Loving Site near mouth of Prairie
Creek; and below this along Trinity River at least 18
others probably belonging to this focus, all in southeast Dallas County (Crook and Harris, 1952).
TYPES OF SITES:

NEO-AMERICAN STAGE
Henrietta Focus

The Henrietta Focus was first defined by Krieger (1946,
pp. 87-159) on the basis of excavations at the M. D. Harrell
Site in Young County, at the junction of Brazos River and
the Clear Fork. Surface collections in many other counties
in the upper valleys of the Red, Trinity, and Brazos Rivers,
and their tributaries, were added to determine the extent
of the focus. The principal diagnostic trait is a plain pottery heavily tempered with crushed mussel shell, the type
Nocona Plain. Commonly associated with this pottery are
small triangular arrow points with two notches in their
edges, and often a notch in the base as well; and a variety
of bone implements, among them hoe blades made from
bison scapulae and skulls.
Many sites of the Henrietta Focus represent a sedentary
or semi-sedentary population supported by agriculture,
hunting, gathering of wild plants, and fishing. The bone
hoe blades are like those commonly associated with farming
Indians of the Great Plains. The variety of implements
made of bones of bison and other animals also points to the
Plains, as in the case of the Antelope Creek Focus (see
PanhandJe-Plains Area). The shell-tempered 1~ocona Plain
pottery may also be of northern origin, as it occurs in cen-

North-Central Area

81

tral Oklahoma and is quite different from any shell-tempered ware in the Caddoan archeological area to the east.
Relationships to the south are also evident in the apparent
survival of dart-point types of the Edwards Plateau Aspect,
although in the pottery-bearing complexes these darts are
small and poorly made when compared with those of the
Archaic Stage.
Contact with the Puebloan culture of the Southwest is
shown by the common occurrence in Henrietta Focus of true
metates, on which grinding was done with a back-and-forth
motion of the mano, as in the corn grinding of the Puebloans
and Middle American Indians. Occasionally potsherds of
painted Puebloan types appear in Henrietta components,
aiding in establishing their age. In the upper Red River
valley, in the area about Vernon, Mr. and Mrs. J. H. Ray
have found several magnificent polished celts of Ouachita
Sandstone which undoubtedly were made within the Caddoan area in southwest Arkansas or southeast Oklahoma,
and carried as far westward as the Panhandle boundary by
Indian trade (Ray, J. H., 1946, p. 261).
The trait list below is based primarily on the Harrell
Site, the added data collected by Krieger, and Witte (1936).
COMPONENTS:
Type Component: M. D. Harrell Site in Young County,
excavated by University of Texas--WPA crew in 193839 under supervision of George R. Fox and A. T. Jackson (Krieger, 1946).
Other Components: Numerous unnamed sites in Young,
Palo Pinto, Archer, Baylor, Wilbarger, Wichita, Clay,
Montague, Cooke, and perhaps other counties.
TYPES OF SITES:
Open campsites on terraces of large and small streams,
also on upland areas of loose, sandy soil where primiÂ¯ tive agriculture could have been practiced. Size of
sites varies from very small to as muchâ€™ as 30 acres
or more.
HOUSES:
No data.

Texas Archeological Society

82
LIVELIHOOD:

Based primarily on maize agriculture and hunting. Direct evidence of maize found in charred cobs and
kernels, but not of other domesticated plants as yet.
Bison and deer bones most numerous, but many small
animals, birds, and fish also represented. Occasional
bone fish-hooks. Mussel shells found in quantity, and
various wild plant foods and nuts probably used.

STORAGE PITS:
Simple pits two or three feet deep, without clay lining,
and of irregular shapes are found in excavated sites
and may have been used for food storage; they contain no skeletal material.
CERAMIC TRAITS:
Type:

Nocona Plain.

Temper: Pulverized mussel shell.
Form: Mainly jars with bulging shoulders and rim
bent outward, bases flat in some cases, perhaps convex in others. A few simple bowls, fairly deep, with
convex bottoms. No complete vessels.
Decoration: Usually undecorated, but occasionally
there are rows of small appliqued nodes around the
neck at the base of the rim. Rarely, there are small
rounded punctates on rim or body, or faint striations
on body. No basketry impressions have been observed on the flat bases although this trait occurs
on very similar pottery in southern Oklahoma,
where the noded decoration is more common than
south of the Red River.
Fragments of crude clay figurines, none complete
enough to see form. Beads (?) of clay, roughly barrel-shaped with perforation running length-wise.
ARTIFACTS OF CHIPPED STONE:
Projectile Points:
Arrow Points: Harrell, Fresno, Cliffton, Young, and
Scallorn types common; Alba, Bonham, and Perdiz
also occur.

North-Central Area

Dart Points: Castroville, Pedernales, and Nolan points
were recognized at the Harrell S i t e by Krieger
(1946) but it was not proved conclusively that they
were made by the Henrietta Focus people; they may
have been survivals from an older culture in the vicinity. However, they were very poorly made and
"decadent" when compared with true Archaic specimens from the Edwards Plateau Aspect and may well
have continued into this horizon. Darl points are
common in the ~-Iarrell and related sites in the upper
Brazos valley, with either the stem or the blade beveled in opposite directions; if both the stem and blade
are .beveled, these are done in opposite directions from
one another. Other dart points occur, not yet defined
by type.
Knives: Diamond-shaped with four alternately-beveled
edges, or with two opposed bevels at one end and
rounded at the other. Also leaf-shaped knives with
bases straight, convex, or almost pointed. "Curved
knives" with one edge straight and other convex.
Scrapers: Small snub-nosed form, heel end sometimes
constricted as though for halting. Side scrapers made
Â¯ by retouching one or more edges of flint spalls very
common. Oval scrapers, occasionally well made. The
Clear Fork end scraper ("gouge") possibly survives,
but if so is very rare.
Flakes with serrated edges, "saws".
Drills: Most commonly made from small flakes, unshaped except for the shaft, which is delicate and
only about 1 inch (2.5 cm.) long. Also larger drills
with base shaped to a narrow T or more or less square.
Spokeshaves and tiny graver points found on flint spalls.
Pick-like objects, crudely chipped, of size to fit in palm
of hand.
Obsidian chips and (rarely) artifacts such as small projectile points.
ARTIFACTS OF GROUND STONE:
Metates of sandstone, thin, flat, used over nearly entire

Texas Archeological Society

surface but usually on one side only; often well shaped
by pecking. With extensive use a very shallow basin
may appear, but never as deep as on milling stones.
Back-and-forth grinding can be seen by scratches
running lengthwise.
Manos of rounded-rectangular shape, usually worn down
on both faces but the two faces pecked to different
degrees of roughness, may be linked with the true
metates because they also bear straight scratches
across their faces from back-and-forth rubbing. Most
are of one-hand size, but long, two-hand manos appear occasionally in the upper Red River valley.
Milling stones less common, made from slabs of various
thicknesses of both sandstone and limestone; rotary
motion produced oval basins near the center, usually
on one side, occasionally on both. The sills around
the basin were not used and the whole stone shows
little workmanship other than the ground basin.
Manos, commonly more or less oval stream pebbles of
sandstone, limestone, and quartzite, and which do not
show the crossing scratches of back-and-forth motion,
are presumed to have been used on the milling stones.
(One may suppose that the true metates were used
for corn-grinding, a trait derived from the Pueblo
culture, while the milling stones are representative
of a very widespread implement in North America,
of much greater age than metates, for pulverizing a
variety of wild plant products, including nuts).
Hones of sandstone.

Shaft smoothers or abraders, consisting of poorly shaped
sandstone blocks with a single groove running lengthwise. Possibiy used in pairs clamped over arrow shaft,
but definite pairs have not been recognized in this
complex. More common in components close to Red
R4ver.
ARTIFACTS OF POLISHED STONE:
Celts, small, highly polished, of hematite.

North-Central Area

Celts, thick, oval in cross-section with tapered poll, of
polished "green-stone" (Ouachita Sandstone). Found
principally close to Red River and probably carried
westward up that valley from Caddoan area.
Pipes, equal-armed, of fine white siltstone or pale greenish-brown sandstone.
ARTIFACTS OF SHELL:
Small mussel shells perforated at thickest part near
hinge (so-called "Hoe blades" but too fragile for this
purpose).
Beads of OlivelIa shells with spires removed; probably
a Gulf of Mexico species.
Disk beads cut from mussel (?) shells.
Mussel shells with serrated edges ("saws").
Large unperforated mussel shells, possibly used as receptacles.
ARTIFACTS OF BONE AND ANTLER:
Hoe blades of bison scapula, with and without socket
in proximal end for halting to wooden handle.
Hoe blades cut from top of bison skull, using base of
horn as the halted end.
â€™"Digging-stick points" of hollowed-out bison metapodial
or cannon bone, with shaft beveled to chisel-like edge
(Red River components).
Knives and/or "draw-shave" scrapers made from bison
scapula and skull-horn sections, with cutting edge
running lengthwise (Red River components).
Awls made from split sections of deer .metapodial or
cannon bone; heads may be unworked (using natural
end bone as butt), the head partly worked down, or
the head entirely removed.
Awls made from splinters of deer and bison bone with
only the tip worked.
Awls of fish bone sharpened at tip.
Awls of bison ribs trimmed to sharp tip
components).

(Red. River

Texas Archeological Society

86

"Rasps" of bison ribs notched along inner edge; occasionally othe~ bones notched along one edge or face.
Fish-hooks of bone, rare.
Long tubes (beads?) of bird-leg bone, either plain or
covered with finely incised geometric designs.
Beads of short, plain sections of bone, from birds or
small animals.
Flaking tools (?) of deer ulna trimmed to chisel-like
points.
Flaking tools (?) of antler tines with bluntly rounded
tips.
MISCELLANEOUS TRAITS:
Large. flint hammerstone, thick or discoidal in shape.
Small blocks of hematite, faces scraped, then polished.
Pieces of meteorite.
Basketry impressions (coiled) on bases of pots (one
Red River component; trait probably intrusive from
Oklahoma).
BLFRIAL CUSTOMS:
Bodies tightly to loosely flexed, placed singly or in
groups in shallow graves, with limestone slabs carelessly placed around sides of grave or over skeleton.
Burials placed in restricted areas of village site.
Usually without offerings that have been preserved;
personal adornments such as beads left on bodies.
Heads not oriented in any particular, direction. Hands
sometimes ,over face. Multiple interments may be up to
seven individuals; sometimes they were placed parallel with legs placed together, spoon-fashion. Instances
have been found where either skull or mandible, or
both, were entirely missing, and others where these
parts were in the grave but out of their proper place.
RELATIONS:
Celts from southeast Oklahoma or southwest Arkansas
carried westward up Red River valley as far as
vicinity of Vernon (J. H. Ray, 1946).

North-Central Area

Chupadero Black-on-White, "brown ware", and glazepaint sherds from the Puebloan culture appear to be
associated with some components.
Obsidian, probably from New Mexico.
Flat metates with back-and-forth motion, probably
diffused eastward from the Puebloan culture.
Sharing of a few dart point types with Edwards Plateau
Aspect to south, and arrow point types with Central
Texas Aspect to south; type Alba with Gibson Aspect
in East Texas Caddoan area.
Olivella-shell beads by trade with Gulf of Mexico.
ESTIMATED AGE:
Puebloan trade pottery suggests a period of about 14001600 A.D., but the Focus may have been established
earlier, before this trade began. The general pattern
of life was similiar to that of the Wichita Indians of
historic times, but there are some significant differences and no evidence of European contact has been
found with Henrietta Focus components. (Krieger,
1946).
SOURCES:
Krieger, 1946, 1947b, ~949; J. H. Ray, 1946; Witte, 1936.
Wylie Focus
During preliminary analysis, Krieger (1946) included
sites as ~far east as Dallas and Collin Counties in the Henrietta.Focus. Beginning in 1948, the intensive reconnaissance
and excavations of the Smithsonian Institutionâ€™s River
Basin Surveys, added to many years of field work by members of the Dallas Archaeological Society, resulted in a
large amount of data which led to the recognition of a
Wylie Focus as a separate cultural unit. Components of this
focusare concentrated along the East Fork of Trinity
River and one of its principal tributaries, Pilot Grove
Creek. The chief components so far known are in Collin
and Rockwall Counties.
Geographically, the Wylie Focus lies

at

the

south-

88

Texas Archeological Society

eastern edge of the Great Plains and just west of the Caddoan archeological area of northeastern Texas. The artifacts reflect this intermediate position, being a blend of
Plains and Caddoan traits, probably with some survivals
from an earlier Archaic Stage. Judging from intrusive pottery types, Wylie Focus was contemporaneous in part with
both the Gibson and Fulton Aspects (see East Texas Area).
Stephenson (1950) placed the Wylie Focus within the Fulton Aspect, but has since withdrawn this in favor of treating Wylie Focus as an amalgamation of traits which can
not easily be placed in any known aspect.
One of the most distinctive and interesting traits of
this focus is the presence of a large, saucer-shaped pit in
nearly every known component. The use of these pits is unknown. They appear too large to be house floors, and although they. haste, definite floors, postholes have not been
found in any prder that would indicate walls. At the Hogge
Bridge Site, where such a pit was excavated carefully, it
was found that the central part had been dug out and the
earth piled around the edges to increase the height of the
rim. Both pit and rim, however, had smooth contours and
gentle slopes. The Hogge Bridge pit measured about 100
feet across the highest parts of the rim and 10 feet deep
in the center; one burial was found in the rim earth but
this hardly explains the purpose of these basin-shaped earthworks (Stephenson, 1952).
Except for the pits, few if any Wylie Focus traits are
distinctive, but the total assemblage is clearly different
from any others. The question has not been settled whether
these people made any pottery of their own, or obtained
it all by trade: the plain, shell-tempered Nocona Plain
probably comes from Henrietta Focus people to the west, and
various engraved, incised, and punctated clay-tempered
wares from Caddoan tribes to the east. Some of the latter
sherds are obviously trade pieces, yet the total pottery is
perhaps too much to be explained as entirely imported.
.Agriculture is indicated by charred corn and bone hoe

Nor~;h-Cent,raI Area

blades; because of this it is probable that some pottery was
made.
COMPONENTS:
Type Component: Hogge Bridge Site, Collin County,
excavated in 1950-51 by River Basin Surveys under
direction of Robert L. Stephenson and Edward B.
Jelks (Stephenson, 1952).

HISTORIC STAGE
Spanish For~ Site
The so-called Spanish Fort Site is one of the largest
historic sites in the southern Great Plains. Actually, there
are two sites, one on each side of Red River. That on the
Texas side is about one mile northwest of the present
town of Spanish Fort in northern Montague County, on the
eastern side of a big northward bend of Red River. In
Jefferson County, Oklahoma, the historic site is said to be
as large as that on the Texas side.
As a matter of fact, neither of these had. anything to
do with occupation by Spaniards. They were known in the
18th century as the "twin villages" of the Taovayas Indians,
a tribe of the w~Shita group. There is a widespread belief

North-Central Area

that Coronadoâ€™s Expedition visited these towns before
going northward to the land of Quivira, in what is now
central Kansas, but there is nothing in the Coronado documents to substantiate this. The two Taovayas villages were
probably first seen by white men not long after the French
had established the post of Natchito.ches in central Louisiana. The French were primarily interested in trade and
rapidly pushed their explorations up the Red River valley,
perhaps reaching the mouth of Little Wichita River (above
Spanish Fort) as early as 1718, The Taovayas villages became
an important trading center, where Comanches from the
west came to meet both the Taovayas and the French who resided among them. This situation must have obtained
until the Louisiana Purchase in 180,3, after which the French
were no longer claimants to this land, but the Taovayas
continued to live there.
The Spanish had only one contact with "Spanish Fort"
--an unsuccessful attack on it in 1759 to punish the Taovayas
and Comanches who had, the year before, come south to
destroy the Spanish mission of San Saba in central Texas.
This mission had been established in 1756 among Apaches
who were the-mortal enemies of the allied Comanches and
Tao~ayas. When Captain Parflla~ commander at San Saba,
led the expedition northward toâ€™ retaliate in 1759, he
astonished to find as many as 6,000 confederated Indians at
the Taovayas "village" (which must have been the one on
the south side of Red River). Moreover, it was fortified
with entrenchments, stockades, and ditches, and over it
flew the French flag. The defending Indians were well
drilled, in military discipline and soon routed the attacking
Spanish, who left all their baggage and six field pieces.
Â¯ The above notes will make it clear that the objects of Europe.an manufacture which have been found in great amounts
on these sites by many collectors are probably mainly of
French origin. Spanish objects may also exist, either directly from this raid or by some round-about trade from SpanÂ°
ish sources in New Mexico and elsewhere. In many cases,
of course, it is impossible to tell whether certain types of

94

Texas Archeological Society

glass beads, iron bit and bridle pieces, parts of guns, locks,
kettles, etc. are of either French or Spanish origin because
they were too much alike. On the other hand, experts
on such objects can often determine the country of origin,_
yet no one has yet undertaken such a study for the rich
collections from Spanish Fort in private hands. That of
Mr. Joe Benton of Nocona, Texas, is probably ~he largest,
while A. H. Witte of Henrietta and others also have valuable
ma.terial.
No excavation has ever been attempted systematically
at either of these sites. The surface collections suggest
that there may have been pre-European occupation here,
but this cannot be proved yet. A number of differences
have been noted in comparison with Henrietta Focus material, which is entirely of prehistoric age, so far as known.
The Henrietta Focus therefore appears to represent aprehistoric agricultural people of unknown tribal affiliation, while Spanish Fort represents the known, historic
Wichita-speaking Indians through the Taovayas tribe. The
chipped-stone artifacts, polished stone elbow pipes, large
grooved pemmican-pounding stones, and perhaps other
traits of Spanish Fort definitely point northward for their
origin. There is documentary material to show that the
various members of the Wichita family probably did not
live in Texas at all before 1700 A. D. The Taovayas may
have been on Red River before~that time, but it is necessary
to explore such sites as Spanish Fort thoroughly to determine how long this site was occupied by the same group.
The more southerly Wichita, such as the Tehuacane (Tawakoni) reached as far south as Waco and the prairie, lands
to the east of it in the late 18th and early 19th century, but
they too seem to have comb south of the Red River only
shortly after 1700 (Krieger, 1946, pp. 144-150, 161-164).
B~lton (1914) has considered the history of the Taovayas villages in some detail, together with the French
activities and Spanish attack. He has, however, located
the twin villages near modern Ringgold, Texas, rather than
at Spanish Fort, Texas. There is no doubt that the same

North-Central Area

95

villages are involved, and since there is no historic site
at Ringgold to fulfill the requirements, it is clear that Bol. Â¯
ton erred in placing the Taovayas villages about 30 miles
too far up the Red.
There is a striking similarity between the objects of
European origin at Spanish Fort and at the Stansbury Site
on the Brazos River in Hill County, a large historic site
excavated by the River Basin Surveys in the Whitney
Reservoir basin (R. L. Stephenson, manuscript in preparation). The Stansbury Site is believed to be the location of a Tehuacane (Tawakoni) Indian village in the late
18th and early 19th century. Since these Indians, like the
Taovayas, also belonged to the Wichita family (and have
often been confused with the Taovayas), and both tribes
appear to have migrated southward from Kansas or Okiahoma at about the same time, this similarity in their materials is understandable and instructive.
Until the Spanish Fort collections are analyzed and
published, a brief trait list must suffice to indicate the
range of materials. The list has been compiled from the
short study of the Benton and Witte collections made by
Krieger (1946, pp. 161-164).
LOCATION:
On both sides of Red River, in Montague County, Texas,
and Jefferson County, Oklahomh.
TYPE OF SITE:
Large open villages on flat terrace adjoining a major
river; said to have been fortified with trenches and
stockades in 1759.
HOUSES:
None have been excavated; written descriptions by
18th century writers describe Wichita houses as
circular, shaped like bee-hive, with grass-thatched
roofs and walls.
LIVELIHOOD:
.Agriculture of considerable importance;

hunting of

96

Texas ArcheoIogical Society

bison also important; hunting of deer and smaller
animals; gathering of wild plant products. No evidence for or against fishing, but Wichita may have
had common Plains Indian taboo against fish.
CERAMIC TRAITS:
Little pottery; what there is is incised, paddle-marked,
and shell-tempered plain ware of unidenified types.
Trade sherds from historic period in Caddoan area
to east and Puebloan area to west.
Clay figurines, human, animal.
Globular beads.
Elbow pipes, of same form as stone pipes (see below).
ARTIFACTS OF CHIPPED STONE:
Projectile Points:
Arrow points: Principally, small triangular Fresno
points or similar thereto; others, not yet defined.
Dart points: Reported but types not yet defined.
Drills: Small, with delicate shafts, bases unshaped.
Scrapers: Snub-nosed form of very small size. Also
retouched flakes.
Knives: Diamond-shaped with edges beveled in alternate directions.
Gun flints, square.
ARTIFACTS OF GROUND STONE:
Manos: Unshaped stream pebbles; shaped sandstone
manos with edges parallel and ends rounded. (Not
known whether these were accompanied by milling
stones or true metates with back-and-forth motion).
Shaft smoothers of standstone blocks with longitudinal
groove.
Pemmican pounders: Large pieces of stone with encircling groove ar~l ends rounded, used as large ham~
mers with wooden h~indles by historic Plains Indians.
ARTIFACTS OF POLISHED STONE:
Elbow pipes: Well made and highly polished pipes
with bowl and stem parts meeting at right angle;
stem end and bowl of about Same size and length or

North-Central Area

97

bowl somewhat longer than stem; often have a spur
projecting beyond bowl, in line with stem.
Catlinite pipes: Various forms traded among historic
Plains Indians. One complete specimen has cylindrical bowl rising out of a rectangular block, stem (of
perishable material) once inserted into hole in side
of block.
Fragments of fine-grained sandstone pipes.
Greenstone celt, thick oval in cr0ss-section, tapered

CENTRAL AREA
The central area includes, generally speaking, the middle courses of the Colorado and Brazos Rivers, with their
tributaries, plus some additional territory. It extends
westward to include Tom Green and Edwards Counties,
northward to a line extending from Jones to Kaufman
Counties, on the east to the middle Trinity River, and on
the south to the coastal and Southwest areas. Its most
striking physiographic feature is the Edwards Plateau, a
great limestone uplift dissected by numerous shallow canyons and valleys. Many springs are found in these canyons
and along the Balcones Fault which marks the Plateauâ€™s
southern ~ margins, This country is now. heavily covered
Â¯ with oak, mesquite; juniper, and elm on uplands and valley
bottoms alike. There is a common belief that less than a
century ago the uplands were luxurious grassland, with
~orests largely confined to the stream bottoms. The abundance of water, large and small game animals, various wild
roots, berries, nuts, fish, birds, etc. provided an unusually
favorable environment for primitive man. Flints of many
varieties were abundantly available in many places, in quarries and stream gravel, and used in great quantity.
As in other sections of Texas, the central area offers
no particularly distinctive traits for the Paleo-American
Stage. There are numerous surface finds of projectile points
which would be regarded as Paleo-American in the Great
Plains, but most of these are found on sites which produce
a large amount of Archaic material. This is particularly
true of points resembling the Plainview and Angostura
types, as discussed under Edwards Plateau. Aspect. One
fine Clovis point was found partially embedded in alluvium
near somewhat disarticulated mammoth remains at the
McLean Site in Taylor County, south of-Abilene (Bryan
and. Ray, 1938; Ray, 1942). Clovis points are, however, of
very rare occurrence in central Texas even though they continue to appear as far south as the Coastal Plain and the
Rio Grande delta. Folsom points are also uncommon, a few
having been found by Dr. Ray in the Abilene area and a half

lOO

Texas Archeological Society

dozen others coming from scattered localities as surface
finds. Five Folsom points come from the dump pile of Kincaid rockshelter (see below). Of all the early types of projectile points, the Scottsblu]f appears to be the rarest, only
three or four fragments coming from central Texas, although this type too extends farther south into the lower
Rio Grande valley and Coastal Plain. There are a number of puzzling aspects to the Paleo-American Stage in central Texas which cannot be solved without excavations
directed toward them.
The Archaic Stage is represented by Edwards Plateau
Aspect, a long-lived culture complex characterized by a
great variety of dart points and many other artifacts of chipped flint. This c~omplex is well known from numerous controlled excavations conducted by the WPA-University of
Texas from 1936 to 1941, but almost none of this valuable
data has been published. The tremendous numbers of projectile points, knives, and scrapers of flint, and great piles
of discarded hearth stones, indicate that economy was"
based on hunting, deer bones being by far the most frequent. Numerous grinding tools testify that vegetal products were also of considerable economic importance.
The Neo-American Stage is represented by the Central
Texas Aspect. Sites are similar~ to those of Edwards plateau
Aspect, on stream terraces and promontories, and in caves
and rockshelters, but the quantities of refuse are far less.
Usually the Central Texas Aspect material, appears as a
thin veneer over middens containing Edwards Plateau
material for the most part. Some of the large more or less
permanent sites, particularly those located on a fertile
terrace, may have been partly supported by agriculture,
but the fact remains that neither food remains nor implements have been found as evidence of agricultural practices. Pottery occurs widely in central Texas, much of it
identifiable as trade ware brought in from surrounding
areas; some sites, however, have numerous small sherds
of peculiar ware not found elsewhere and which may be
of local origin.

Ce~rgl Area

It has been suggested that the Austin and Toyah Foci
of the Central Texas Aspect extended into historic times
(Krieger, 1946; Kelley, 1947), but this suggestion has not
been properly demonstrated. Flint artifacts of native origin
have been found at mission sites, such as Goliad and San
Saba, and some rock-crevice burials with European trade
items have been found. However, there has as yet beer~ no
successful welding of historic material into an Historic
Stage for the area as a whole, with its relationship to the
Neo-American Stage. The Stansbury Site on the Brazos
River in Hill County, excavated by the River Basin Surveys before being iriundated by Whitney Reservoir, appears to have been the location of a Tehuacane (Tawakoni)
Indian village (Stephenson manuscript in preparation).
PALEO-AMERICAN STAGE
Brief summaries of the two excavated sites

of this

Stage in Central Texas follow:
K~ncaid Site, Uvalde County. This small cave four
miles north of Sabinal, Texas, was excavated in 1948 by the
Texas Memorial Museum, and the occupation area outside
of it excavated in 1953 by the University of Texas Field
School in Archaeology in collaboration with the Texas
Memorial Museum. The five Folsom points found in a dump
pile left by looters provided a tantalizing problem, so that
the excavators hoped to find more such points in place.
Despite a great amount of laborious work, no more such
points were found; however, a wealth of new information
resulted. Mostâ€™interesting, it was found that Paleo-American occupation of the cave existed in contemporaneity with
animals now extinct: particularly Pleistocene horse, bison,
and mammoth, and other animals such as turtle and alligator. At this remote time, the human inhabitants were evidently annoyed with mud on .the cave floor and brought in
many large stream-worn stones, laying them in a fairly
level pavement over at least half the cave area. This pavement overlay a clay pond deposit which is now higher than
the river terraces outside the cave. Many bones of extinct

102

Texas Archeological Society

animals lay over the pavement: Directly overlying the
Pleistocene deposits, and separated from them by an
erosional disconformity, was a thick occupation deposit of
the Edwards Plateau Aspect. At the base of this deposit
were found several projectile points c~Iosely resembling the
Plainview and Angostura types, and others of lanceolate
form not easily classified, (Sellards, 1952, p. 94; Campbell
and Evans, extensive report in preparation):
Montell Shelter, Uvalde County. A small shelter was
excavated in 1947 by Evans and Meade of the Texas
Memorial Museum. It produced a large burned-rock midden of typical Edwards Plateau Aspect nature in the upper
parts. Lower down were remains of extinct fauna, prim
cipally tapir (Sellards, 1952, p. 144). The artifacts have
not yet been described. They suggest lanceolate forn~s of
the Paleo-American Stage but as none are complete the
identification is .difficult.
ARCHAIC STAGE
Edwards Plateau Aspect
The Clear Fork Complex of Dr. C. N. Ray (1929, 1938,
1945, 1948) was the first definition of archaeological material which is now considered an intregral part of the Edwards Plateau Aspect. Dr. Rayâ€™s pioneering work in the
Abilene area was paralleled" by ~hat of Prof. J. E. Pearce
of the University of Texas, who excavated in the burntrock middens of Travis and Williamson Counties, recognizing certain differences between their upper and lower
levels. In 1935 E. B. Sayles published his famed Survey o]
Texas Archeology, the first definition of trait complexes
for the state as a whole. His Round Rock and Guadalupe
Phases are now considered to be slightly different expressions of the Edwards Plateau;Aspect. From 1936 to 1941 the
WPA-University of Texas Statewide Archaeological Survey conducted numerous excavations in central Texas, principally along the Colorado River ir~ sites that are now beneath the waters of Lake Buchanan, Lake Travis, and Lake

Central Area

103

Austin. One of the archaelogists of this Survey, J. Charles
Kelley, spent some years in analyzing the specimens and
excavation data from these sites, as well as from surface
collections in many central Texas counties. So far, only a
short chronological study of this material, without type definitions or descriptions, has been published (Kelley, 1947a).
Kelley recognized three loci in the Edwards Plateau
Aspect: the Clear Fork, Round Rock, and Uvalde, incorporating in this scheme some of the ideas of his predecessors.
The three foci are, however, chiefly recognized on the
basis of comparative distribution and frequency of certain
types of projectile points. On the other hand, it is well
known that the types considered diagnostic of the three
loci commonly occur together in the same sites and levels
in the Central Texas Area. Without the basic data to
demonstrate this three-fold division, if it can be demonstrated, the writers can 0nly discuss the Edwards Plateau
Aspect as a cultural unit,~.as we have done ~in the trait list
below.
A notable feature of this Aspect is the seemingly sedentary nature of the larger sites.~ The great accumulations of
burned and cracked limestone~ hearth rocks which typify
these sites could not have resulted in any way except
through the continued use of the same location for generations or even for centuries. Since, however, it is virtually
certainâ€™that these people n~ver practiced agriculture, it is
probable that the sites were not inhabited the year around,
but that each small band wandered over the surrounding
area in search of plant and animal food, returning to the
central location for part of the year.
The majority of these sites are found on river terraces,
but others occur 5n promontories of the limestone, and in
caves and rockshelters. Whatever their location, almost all
these sites, of which s~everal hundred are known, are marked
by masses of burned and cracked limestone. Controlled
excavations have proved beyond question tha~ the stone~
are accumulations of broken limestone slabs; basin~-sb~p~
hearth pits were dug and lined with such slabs, which

104

Texas Archeological Society

cracked under heat and were thrown out, then replaced
with new slabs. Such accumulations have been called
"mounds" but since they were not purposefully erected they
should be called "burnt-rock middens." Between the rock
fragments there is usually black earth and ashes, in which
great numbers of flint artifacts and flint workshop material are found, as well as cracked animal bone, snail shells,
mussel shells, and occasionally a human burial. So few
burials have been found, however, even in the completely
excavated middens, that they cannot possibly account for
all the dead of these people. The majority must have been
disposed of some other way, buried well away from the
camp sites and middens, or cremated.
We have already mentioned the occurrence of projectile points in sites of the Edwards Plateau Aspect Which,
in the Great Plains, have consistently been associated with
Pleistocene fauna. The Clovis and Folsom points very seldom
if ever occur in association with Edwards Plateau Aspect
material, so that it is probable that they constitute a distinct time period, or periods, as one would expect. The
Scottsbluf~ type is very rare but the few specimens known
cannot be associated with any particular complex as yet.
The great majority of the early projectile points belong to
the Plainview and Angostura types or are of similar lanceolate shapes that are difficult to classify in the present incomplete state of this typology. Over 200 such points have
been recorded from central Texas, and doubtlessly several
times this number could be recorded in private collections.
Those for which we possess some data can be divided into
surface specimens, and those which come from excavated
sites of the Edwards Plateau Aspect. There are at least 100 of
the latter from the WPA-University of Texas excavations in
the Lake Buchanan and Lake Travis basins alone, and 20
more from other sites in which tests have been dug. The
early types, however, are always found in very small numbers relative to the total of dart points from each site; it is
unusual to find more than one or two ir~ every 100 points
of all kinds. There are several, possible explanations for

Central Area

so many projectile points which elsewhere belong to a
Paleo-American Stage occurring here in scores of sites
which contain a full-blown Archaic complex of artifacts:
1. They were picked up by the Archaic people from
Pleistocene sites, just as we would pick them up today as
curios; the later Indians likewise took them back to camp
as curios or they actually re-used them (re-use is sometimes
definite when the artifact shows re-shaping with fresher
chipping marks).
2. They were accidental inclusions in refuse deposits
of Edwards Plateau components, brought up from lower
levels by the digging Of hearth pits, graves, house pits,
etc.; but if this were the case there was no evidence of
the "accident" that the archaeologist could discover in any
of the excavations.
3. The Paleo-American Stage lasted longer in central
(and coastal) Texas than it did in the Great Plains farther
north, so that when the Archaic Stage became establishe~l,
this region was still inhabited by people making types df
artifacts abandoned long before elsewhere; the great game
animals of the late Pleistocene would have disappeared by
this time, but somehow the ancient hunters kept existing
here by turning to plant food as well as game and fish.
4. The Paleo-American Stage did not survive longer
in central Texas, but the Archaic Stage began much farther
back *~han we have been supposing.
There is insufficient evidence to settle on any answers
to these questions. Both (1)and (2) doubtlessly account
for some specimens in places where they appear foreign or
intrusive. Choosing between (3) and (4) is a knotty prob. lem which cannot be solved by logic alone; there is a great
need for radiocarbon dates to determine the length of life
of the Edwards Plateau Aspect and the ages of the terraces
in which this material is commonly found. This question
.of how the Paleo-American and Archaic Stages may or
may not have overlapped is not peculiar to central Texas,
but occurs in the same manner in north-central, coastal,

]06

Texas Archeological Society

and southwestern Texas and also has wide implications for
North America as a whole.
In present knowledge, it seems beyond doubt that the
Edwards Plateau Aspect existed for several thousand years.
Radiocarbon dates on the Archaic Stage east of the Mississippi River have surprised archaeologists by showing that
their previous estimates of 500 B. C. (or even 500 A. D.!)
for the beginning of this cultural pattern were far too
modest. At least a dozen dates in Kentucky, New York, and
other states show that its beginning was not later than
3,500 B. C. and may have been as long ago as 5,000 B. C. In
central Texas we consider that a beginning date of not
later than 4,000 or 5,000 B. C. is entirely reasonable, and
that radiocarbon dates may necessitate moving this even
farther back. The ending date has also been revised backward in recent years to somewhere between 500 "and 1,000
A. D. by the present writers, due to pushing backward the
estimated beginning date of the next culture stage, the
Neo-American, in this region.
Several classifications have been made for cultural
material in this area, and have proved to be exceedingly
confusing to all archaeologists. The terms used by Kelley
(1947 a, 1947 b) may be compared with those preceeding
him, as follows, for use in consulting the literature: .

We may repeat that none of these divisions has ever

Plateau Aspect as a unit in the trait list below. It certainly

miscellaneous small flakes or spalls with slight edgework; spokesha~ve scrapers with small concave bit;
very large curved scrapers with long, thick, concave
bit.
Knives: Very numerous with all variations of shape
from triangular to a broad leaf, with parallel-edged
forms intermediate; all of these have concave,

rare. "Curved" knives fairly common, with one edge
more or less straight and other convex. Corner-tang
Â¯ knives and various others with stem off-center but
not at corner. Knives generally under 1/~ inch thick.
Axes: Common, generally thicker than knives, made
by crude percussion chipping only, and less variety
in shape; commonly oval to rounded-triangular shape
with bases usually convex, sometimes straight.
Choppers: Heavy percussion-chipped tools made from
broken flint nodules, the stream-worn surface of one
end fitting the hand, the other end fashioned into a
jagged edge useful for splitting bones; if the cutting
end is Well fashioned with a definite blade, the object is a "fist axe" but such workmanship is uncommoil.

Picks:. Heavy core tools like choppers but smaller in
diameter, worked over all or nearly all the surface,
and crudely pointed.
Drills: Usually have heavy shafts two to four inches
long; oval in cross-section; bases may be oval to
square, worked on both faces, but the majority of
"drills" appear to have been re-fashioned from
broken projectile points of several types.
Scrap: All sites.have quantities of flint scrap, both
waste flakes and cores; these never show any consistency in form either in the manner of flake removal or in reducing the cores.

ARTIFACTS

OF GROUND STONE:

Manos: Always of one-hand size, either shaped or unshaped. Shaped manos usually, of limestone or sandstone, roughly oval in outline and worn on one or
two faces; two convergent faces sometimes produced
a wedge shape. Unshaped stream pebbles usually
of granite, showing wear on at least one face.
Milling stones: Oval or circu~lar depressions worn in
one or both faces of unshapedâ€™ stone slabs; most
commonly limestone, sometimes sandstone.
Pipes: Large, egg-shaped, made of limestone pebbles
without much exterior modification, holes drilled
from both ends meet in middle; one has been found
with bone-tube mouthpie~ce (very rare).
ARTIFACTS OF POLISHED STONE:
Pendants: Thin, flat, oval plaques, usually limestone
but occasionally slate or metamorphic rock, holes
drilled through one or both ends for suspension;
sometimes decorated with extremely fine lines in
geometric patterns.
Boatstones: a few crude examples of limestone appear
to be indigenous; others may be importations from
the Southeast United States.
ARTIFACTS OF BONE AND ANTLER:
Bone awls, infrequent.
Flaking tools of deer ulna and antler, infrequent considering amount of flint working done.
Drill handles (?) : Short cylinders of antler withsocket
in one end.
ARTIFACTS OF SHELL:
A few perforated mussel shells (so-called "hoes").

NIISCELLANEOUS:
Pigments: Red and yellow ochre lumps, scraped for
paint material. Pieces of dark bluish-gray graphite
rubbed and scraped around edges, faces sometimes

hollowed out, apparently also for pigment.
Hones: pieces of limestone and sandstone with narrow
grooves worn in faces, probably to sharpen bone
tools.
Shaft abraders: rounded, elongate pieces of limestone
with rounded groove running crosswise and a series
of deep, narrow incised lines at right angle to the
groove (Kelley, 1948, has described them).
"Tablets": Small flat objects of limestone and limonite
or ochre with very finely incised lines in geometric
patterns.
Hammerstones, generally of quartzite.
"Sinkers": Flat limestone pebbles, oval or irregular
in outline, with two notches chipped into opposite
edges.
"Waco sinkers": Small" egg-shaped quartzite pebbles
with two notches chipped across the opposite ends.
These occur commonly in the northeast part of the
central area, between Waco and Dallas, very infrequently elsewhere.
BURIAL CUSTOMS:
. Individuals buried singly in flexed position in pits
usually unlined but occasionally lined with limestone slabs set on edge. Few or no offerings of a
durable nature were placed in graves. There is no
consistent orientation of the head. Very few burials
have been found in sites of this Aspect, hence burial
or cremation away from villages may have been
practiced.
RELATIONS:
Dart point types Wells, Gary, Ellis, Yarbrough occur in
small numbers, made of local flints, sUggesting diffusion from East Texas Archaic, although these types

NEO-AMERICAN STAGE
Central Texas Aspect

Central Texas Aspect sites are found in an area extending from the Brazos River drainage on the east and
north, to approximately Tom Green and Edwards Counties
on the west, and to the central coastal plain on the south.
Like the Edwards Platedu Aspect, it roughly conforms to
the Edwards Plateau limestone region, with a slight extension into the coastal plain area to the east and southeast.
However, the Central Texas Aspect occupies a later chronological position than the Edwards Plateau Aspect, being
marked by the appearance of pottery, small, thin arrow
points, beveled knives, small snub-nosed scrapers, and
other new traits. Much Of this pottery can be identified as
trade ware from various directions. The remainder may
have been made in this area; at least its outside origin is
doubtful.
P~-evious designations for the Central Texas Aspect
include J. E. Pearceâ€™s Texas Kitchen Midden Culture, Upper

Cenfral Area

113

Level, and E. B. Saylesâ€™ Wichita Phase, in part.
Kelley recognized two principal divisions of the Central Texas Aspect,* the Toyah and Austin Foci, largely on
distributional differences in arrow point types. He tenta~
tively linked the Toyah Focus with the Jumano Indians
of the early historic period (Kelley, 1947b, p.121), and the
Austin Focus has been identified as the archeological remains of Tonkawa Indians (Krieger, 1946, pp. 165-168).
Although .the linkage with these historic groups is not imProbable, it is best regarded as only tentative, as European
items are conspicuously absent in Central Texas Aspect
sites, and the archeological remains and their distribution
Â¯ do not altogether fit the early historic descriptions of the
Tonkawa and Jumano Indians.
Differences in distribution of the pottery types and
some of the arrow point types have been observed, and
regional variations in arrow point typology and quantitative representation of severa! types of artifacts have been
noted. Thus, it appears that the Central Texas Aspect
should probably be divided into several loci. However,
data are insufficient at present to accurately define the
hypo~thetical loci; consequently the following trait list has
been compiled for the aspect as a whole.

COMPONENTS:
Type Component: None designated.
Principal Excavated Components: Fall Creek Sites in
the Lake Buchanan Basin, San Saba, Llano, and
Burnet Counties (Jackson, 1938); sites in Belton
Reservoir, Cbryell County (Miller and Jelks, 1952);
Blum Rockshelter in Whitney Reservoir, Hill
County (Jelks, 1953) ; Lehmann Rockshelter in Gillespie County, upper level (Kelley, 1947b); Pictograph,
Buzzard, and Sheep Rockshelters in Whitney Reser*Stephenson (1950,..p. 154) listed a third focus, the Nueces, in the Centr2.1
Texas Aspect. The i~ueces and the Tradinghouse have beeh tentatively
suggested as foci of the Central Texas Aspect by Kelley (unpublished manuscript), again on the basis of arrow 9oint typology, but neither has been
described or defined in detail.

HOUSES:
No data. Probably never more than brush huts in most
cases.
LIVELIHOOD:
Hunting of deer, bison, and various small game; gathering of wild plant products; fishing indicated by presence of bone fishhooks and fish bones in sites.
Evidence of agriculture is lacking, but .is suggested
by the position of some semi-permanent villages on
fertile terrace soil; trade with agricultdral tribes to
the west, north, east, and perhaps Middle America
to the south, is fully evident in a variety of intrusive
potsherds.
CERAMIC TRAITS:
Pottery Types: Leon Plain found sparsely but widely.
Doss Red Ware (Kelley 1947 b) occurs rarely and
may be Huastecan trade pottery. Brushed and punciated utility ware similar in paste to Leon Plain occurs
rarely.
Temper: Usually heavily tempered with finelY crushed
bone.
Form: No complete vessels known, but some sherds
are from jars .with high, slightly flaring rim, bases
perhaps rounded or concoidal; bowls, shape unknown.
Decoration:Usually plain, sometimes surface well
polished On both bowls and jars; Brushing, scoring,

HISTORIC STAGE
Few sites in central Texas can be definitely assigned to
the Historic Stage. At some of the Spanish missions native
artifacts of flint, bone, and shell have been found which can
be related to at least some of the Indians collected at these
missions. Otherwise, there is only one Historic occupational
site of consequence on record so far, the Stansbury Site in
Hil! County. This is probably the location of a Tehuacane
(Towakoni) village of the late 18th and early !9th centuries. In addition to European material, there are marked
differences between the native artifacts of Stansbury, the
missions, and the Central Texas Aspect sites. Typologically,
the Stansbury material may be more closely related to His~
~oric sites such as Spanish Fort on the Red River, and those
in northeastern Texas, than it is to any known prehistoric
complex in the same area. These Historic links with known
tribes are among the most serious gaps in the archaeology
of Texas, and should be one of the best problems for future
research.

COASTAL AREA
The coastal area of Texas is a flat plain which includes
a series of very large bays and lagoons, as well as long offshore islands, and extends inland variable distances, usually
40 to 60 miles, to where rock outcrops and slightly hilly
country begin. Toward the southern end, the vegetation is
primarily tall grass and there are hundreds of ponds as
well as large fields of sand dunes. The central part is mixed
grassland and forest with motts of oaks and other hardwoods
dotting the plains, and dense corridor forests along the
streams. The eastern part grows increasingly more forestcovered, containing large stands of southern pine on open
ground, jungle-like tangles of hardwoods and vines along
the rivers, and open grassy plains near the ocean. Most of
the rivers broaden and become sluggish on nearing the coast
or the bays into which they empty. Most of the known
archaeological sites are along the shores of the bays, islands,
and lagoons; the few sites known farther inland appear to
be similar to those near the shores.
The Pateo-American Stage is represented by but a few
artifacts, most of which are Clovis fluted points, and there

are many reports of late Pleistocene fossils, often of mammoth. The coast is thus a very promising field of research
for this stage, but only one site has been extensively excavated (see below).
Material of the Archaic Stage occurs widely in this area
but only one complex is as yet well defined. This isthe
Aransas Focus in the central portion, particularly around
the shores of Aransas and San Antonio Bays (see below).
The Oso Phase of Sayles (1935) was defined from material
found near Oso Creek on the south side of Corpus Christi
Bay, but his data are insufficient for close comparisons with
the Aransas Focus or later complexes in the Neo-American
Stage. In the Addicks Reservoir area west of Houston,
Wheat (1953) found considerable pre-ceramic material underlying that of the Galveston Bay Focus (Neo-American
Stage), but this has not yet been defined as a distinct complex. Dart point types in the Addicks area indicate rela-

tionships with the East Texas and Edwards Plateau Aspects
of the Archaic Stage, as well as with the pottery-bearing
Tchefuncte complex of Louisiana. Undoubtedly other Archaic manifestations will be defined.
In the Neo-American Stage three complexes have been
defined, but none in detail in published form. These are the
Galveston Bay Focus on the east, Rockport Focus in the
center, and Brownsville Focus extending from the south
tip of Texas into the coastal plain of Tamaulipas, Mexico.
The first two are much alike in their stone artifacts but
their potteries are quite distinct and unique (the origin of
neither pottery tradition has been determined). The Brownsville Focus, on the other hand, contains great numbers of
shell artifacts lacking (for the most part) in the other two,
and pottery which can definitely be traced to an origin in
the Huastecan area on the east coast of Mexico. There are
considerable numbers of potsherds and a few whole vessels
in:the Rio Grande delta area which must have come there
by trade from the south, although it is possible that the
actual manufacture of such pottery gradually diffused northward up the coastal fringe as far as Arroyo Colorado in
Cameron County. The gaps between these three loci are
poorly known and should be explored.
In Orange County, just west of the Louisiana border,,
there are sites with potsherds of the Marksville c6rnplex.
These sites must represent either a small extension of the
Marksvirle complex into Texas, or people who received
more of this particular ware by trade than any others in
Texas.
The Historic Stage is represented by such articles as
arrow points and scrapers chipped from glass, glazed pottery and chinaware, iron, glass beads, etc. In the central
p~rtion the Rockport Focus appears to contain such objects
and tI~erefore continued into this stage, although ~this applies
to veiy few of its components. Glass arrow points have
been found on the surface of Brownsville Focus sites, but
since none of thesehave been excavated, it is uncertain
whether this is fortuitou~ or the Brownsville Focus actually

120

lasted into European times. In this area the first important
contact with Europeans was in 1747, when Jos~ de Escandon
explored what is now Tamaulipas. At the other extreme,
none of the Galveston Bay Focus components are known to
show any European materials. However, there are Spanish
mission sites in both the central and eastern portions of the
coastal belt which should produce valuable clues to the connections, if any, between the above-mentioned culture complexes and the Indian tribes who gathered about the missions.
PALEO-AMERICAN STAGE
Buckner Ranch Site, Bee County:
A WPA-University of Texas excavation sponsored by
the Bureau of Economic Geology was carried out at this
site, 12 miles east of Beeville, in 1938-39 to collect Pleistocene fossils. In the lower levels of the stream terrace, below
the remains of mammoth, mastodon, extinct horse, bison,
and glyptodon, were found a few projectile points. Viewed
in our present knowledge of late Pleistocene artifacts, these
points would seem not to have been in direct association,
because farther north, in the Great Plains, they fall into
two or three distinct time levels and usually ~appear with
different species of extinct fauna. The possibility, that the
Buckn~r Ranch a~tifacts and the overlying fossils were in
secondary deposition, was carefully examined in the field,
and while no absolute conclusion was made, the association
appeared to be a primary one (Sellards, 1940). The artifacts
were not water-worn and there were hearth stones in place
in the silt higher up. Referring to Sellardsâ€™ Plate I, the
artifacts can be identified in current terminology as follows:
No. 4, Angostura point; No. 5, Scottsblu]] point, tip and most
of stem missing; No. 6, a corner-notched dart point of a style
not otherwise reported from a Pleistocene site, but found in
the Edwards Plateau Aspect; No. 7, a very thin, flat, and
finely chipped fragment of what must be included in the
Folsom type but was simply too thin to flute; and No. 8, the
base of a fluted Clovis point. No. 9, said to be in the lower
stratum, was included by error and came from another site.

Coastal Area

121

The sixth specimen from the lower level is almost exactly
like No. 6, the corner-notched dart point. Nos. 1 to 3 on this
plate came from a h~gher level, above the fossils (No. 1 is a
Pedernales point).
Another explanation for this curious mixture is that
types stratigraphically distinct in the Great Plains, and
such animals as the mammoth, mastodon, horse, and large
Pleistocene bison, actually survived longer close to the Gulf
coast (now a sub-tropical zone) than they did in the Great
Plains. This requires that all the afore-mentioned types
would have been manufactured at aâ€™bout the same time, and
that the several animals mentioned lived here until something like 6,000 years ago, or until artifacts of the Archaic
Stage were already appearing.
tion from more sites.

As usual, we need informa-

Other ]inds:
Clovis points have been reported from surface collections almost throughout the coastal belt. Three or four
come from heavily-wooded Harris County in the vicinity of
Houston, while the base of a Clovis point was found by A. E.
Anderson close to the Rio Grande mouth in 1933. W.A.
Price, visiting the site of the latter specimen some years
later, found~ mammoth bones weathering from the clay
nearby. A fine, long Clovis point of black flint comes from
Calhoun County, and others from Aransas and San Patricio
Counties. Plainview points have been found in fair numbers in the Morhiss site in Victoria County and another was
found within a few feet of weathered mammoth bones on the
south shore of False Oso Creek, south of Corpus Christi, in
January 1954 by F. Berlet. A broken specimen, apparently a
PIainview, was found recently near Houston by Elwyn
Simons.
ARCHAIC STAGE
Aransas Focus
The Aransas Focus is an Archaic complex lmown from
shell middens concentrated in the vicinity of Aransas and
San Antonio Bays. Some dart points from these middens

Texas Archeological Society

122

are of Edwards Plateau Aspect types. However, the extensive use of shell, particularly conch, for the making of tools
and utensils sets the Aransas Focus apart from the other
known Archaic complexes in Texas. Shell artifacts similar
to those found at Aransas sites occur along the northern
and northwestern coast of the Gulf of Mexico, Florida, the
southern Atlantic coast, and in the Caribbean Islands. The
distribution of these shell artifacts may be the result of a
widespread Eastern Archaic pattern; or they may be merely
a reflection of a similar widespread adaptation to available
local materials provided by the environment. Data at
present are too inadequate for the confirmation of either
of these interpretations.
Aransas Focus sites were first recorded by George C.
Martin and Wendell H. Potter during their survey of the
Texas coast in 1927-1929. In the 1930â€™s The University of
Texas excavated several Aransas sites. Definition of the
focus, however, is primarily the work of T. N. Campbell
(1947 and 1952), and is based largely upon three excavated
sites.
COMPONENTS:
Type Component: The Johnson site, located on the
west side of Live Oak Peninsula, in Aransas County;
excavated sometime during 1927-1929 by George C.
Martin and Wendell H. Potter. In 1930 A. M.Wilson
did some testing for The University of Texas; final
excavations by The University of Texas-WPA in 194041 under the supervision of William A. Duffen (Campbell, 1947, p. 43).
Other Excavated Components:

UVELIHOOD:
Extensive use of shellfish, principally oyster, clam, and
conch; also utilized for food to a considerable extent
were various large animals (bison and deer), and
small game such as peccary, raccoon, rabbits, and
various aquatic birds. Fish, and to a lesser extent,
wild plant products were also used. No evidence of
agriculture.

Nolan, and Morhiss appear rarely.
Remarks: "Dart" points along the whole coastal margin are generally much smaller than in the interior,
probably due to the~carcity of stone of any kind
and the Indiansâ€™ need to utilize the smallest pieces.
Drills: Small, made from flint flakes.
Scrapers: Plano-convex end-scrapers; flakes with retouching on one or more edges.

ARTIFACTS OF BONE AND ANTLER:
Tubular beads of bird bone, less frequently of long
bones of mammals; both plain and decorated. Decorations consist of simple geometric designs, both incised and "dotted" (lines of tiny drilled holes).
Awls: Usually made of deer ulna; also from split bone,
sometimes decorated in a manner similar to the beads;
and splinter awls with only ,the tip smoothed.

Small disc-shaped objects cut from the whorl of conchshell.
Scrapers: Made from the lip portion of the conch bodywhorl.
Centrally perforated oyster shells.
Clam-shell knives or scrapers with chipping along one
edge.
Awls: Made by sharpening the tips of conch-shell
columellae.
MISCELLANEOUS TRAITS:
Twined basketry indicated by impressions preserved in
asphalt; also matting, but technique uncertain.
Miscellaneous lumps of asphalt.
Hammerstones: Oval, stream-worn pebbles or flint
nodules.
Various soft stones probably used as source of pigment.

125

BURIAL CUSTOMS:
Placed either flexed or extended in shell middens; unaccompanied by offerings of a durable nature.
RELATIONS:
Presence of flint (not occurring naturally on coast) indicates trade with inland groups or trips inland to
the sources of flint.
Most of dart-point types named above shared with Edwards Piateau Aspect.
ESTIMATED AGE:
No objective basis for dates at present; more or less contemporaneous with other Archaic complexes such as
Edwards Plateau Aspect.

NEO-AMERICAN STAGE
Rockport Focus
This complex in the central portion of the Texas coast
was first defined as the Rockport Phase by E. B. Sayles
(1935), who organized and enlarged upon the previous work
of George C. Martin and Wendell H. Potter. Saylesâ€™ trait
list, however, includes material now attributed to the Galveston Bay Focus of the eastern portion of the Texas coast.
The Rockport and Galveston Bay Foci share arrow point
types Perdiz, Fresno, Scallorn, and Cliff, on and probably
other traits, but are differentiated by their distinctive pottery.
Rockport components frequently overlie those of the
earlier Aransas Focus. Further evidence of a late chronological position for the Rockport Focus consists of an occasional arrow point made from glass and the intrusion of
European items, indicating its continuation into the Historic
Stage.
It seems probable that Rockport Focus represents archeological remains of the "Karankawa" Indians (a term

Galveston Bay Focus
Along the eastern portion of the Texas coast and extending inland for an unknown distance, are campsites and
shell middens of the Galveston Bay Focus. This focus is
known from three partially excavated sites in the Addicks
Reservoir area (Wheat, 1953) and from numerous unexcavated sites along the coast and on the shores of inland bays.
A detailed inventory of the artifact complex is not possible at this time but two pottery types, Goose Creek Plain
and Goose Creek Incised--identical in vessel shape and paste
--are considered to be diagnostic traits of the Galveston Bay
Focus. Arrow points associated with components at Addicks
include types Alba, Perdiz, Scatlorn, Fresno, and CliS~ton.
Alba has a very broad distribution northward and eastward
from Addicks, occurring in many complexes of the Caddoan
area and eastward into the Lower Mississippi Valley. The
other four arrow-point types are shared with the Rockport
Focus, the Central Texas Aspect, and other complexes.
A non-ceramic complex containing dart points of the
East Texas Aspect and, to a lesser degree, the Edwards
Plateau Aspect, underlay the Galveston Bay components at
Addicks, and there is evidence that some of these Archaic
dart point types may have survived into the Galveston Bay
Focus.
The following trait list is based e~itirely .on the Addicks
Reservoir sites west of Houston (Wheat, 1953). Whether or
not the same traits all o~cur in sites along the bay shores
and Gulf cannot be determined until some of them have
been excavated.
COMPONENTS:
Type Component: None designated.
Excavated Components: Doering, Kobs, and Grisbee
sites, and site 66A6-4 in the Addicks Reservoir basin,
Harris County (Wheat, 1953).

complex in the Lower Mississippi Valley (See Wheat,
1953, P1. 33, K).
ESTIMATED AGE:
Some evidence that this focus lasted a long time with
little change. If the Tchefuncte trade sherd is acceptable for dating, the focus probably began before
500 A. D. The Addicks sites have no European material and must have been abandoned before 1700; the
question of survival into historic horizon elsewhere
remains to be answered.

Brownsville Focus
Components of the Brownsville Focus are located in the

Coastal Area

extreme southern tip of Texas, on the Rio Grande delta and
along the coastal margin about to the San Fernando River
in northern Tamaulipas. The artifact complex is known
principally from the large surface collections of A. E. Anderson, who first recognized the focus, although Sayles
(1935) named and more fully described it as the Brownsville
Phase. The most striking feature is the great number of
shell artifacts, especially ornaments. Although this abundant working of shell is a very distinct industry, the suggested association of artifact types below needs verification
by controlled excavations.
COMPONENTS:
Type Component: None designated.
Excavated components: Ayala Site, Hidalgo County
(Campbell and Frizzell, 1949).
Other Components: A. E. Anderson located over 100
sites in Cameron County and made surface collections;
he also found scores of sites in northeast Tamaulipas,
many of which were relocated by McNeish (1947).
TYPES OF SITES:
Small campsites, usually situated on rises along streams
or arroyos; characterized by hearth areas with an
abundance of broken shell.
HOUSES:
No data.
LIVELIHOOD:
Use of various sea foods, game animals and wild plant
products. No evidence of agriculture.
CERAMIC TRAITS:
All the pottery appears to be intrusive mainly from the
Huasteca area (Periods V and VI) on the east coast
of Mexico, and to a lesser extent from the Rockport
Focus.

SOUTHWEST TEXAS
This section includes the whole southern horn of Texas
except for the coastal belt. Its northern boundary is placed
at Frio River, a tributary of the Nueces, because the Frio~
marks a rather sudden shift in archeological material from
that characteristic of Central Texas. This entire section of
Texas is popularly known as the "Monte", a vast expanse of
undulating plain and rocky outcrops of low relief, uniformly
covered with thorny brush. It is also called a "mesquite
savannah" by geographers, although many other sma!l trees
other than mesquite bear thorns and are adapted to the low
rainfall, high humidity, and great heat of this region. There
are evidences that the mesquite, as in other parts of western
and southern Texas, is a recent invader which, because of
its extremely long roots, is able to reach a gradually falling
water-table better than other plants. Grasses, wild flowers,
and prickly-pear cactus are other common plants. Except
for the bottomlands of the Frio and Nueces Rivers, there are
no oaks, pecans, or other large trees in this region. Cypresses
occur along the Rio Grande banks and those of tributary
rivers from Mexico. Deer, wolves, jaguars, cougars, and
numerous small animals are still found although the carnivores have largely been killed off. Bison and antelope
were still found here in the 19th century. Fish abound in
the Rio Grande, including the alligator gar; and alligators
are still sometimes found.
The first Europeans to enter this area are believed to
have been Cabeza de Vaca and his three companions, who,
after being shipwrecked on the central Texas coast, survived six years of captivity and hardships, and finally, in
the fall of 1534, escaped their captors somewhere south of
San Antonio and attempted to reach P~nuco (near present
Tampico) overland. After crossing the Rio Grande, more
or less in the vicinity of present Lake Fatc6n or Roma, they
came to mountain ranges in what is now eastern Nuevo
Leon, rounded them, and decided to explore the country to
the other ocean the Pacific. A reconstruction of their ad-

Southwest Texas

135

ventures and route has been prepared for publication by
Krieger ("Cabeza de Vaca in Texas and Mexico"). As
early as 1583, a permanent Spanish settlement was made
within 40 miles of FalcSn Dam, at present Cerralvo in eastern Nuevo Leon, and the lower Rio Grande valley became
well: known to the Spanish by 1600 A. D. Both Cabeza de
Vaca and the later Spaniards remark on the extreme density
of Indi~in population in the Rio Grand~ va!ley and lands to
the south 5f it~ even though these Indians planted no crops.
Radical Changes in environment are indicated, for the area
is now most uninviting and poor in plant resources.
The first known permanent settlements in South Texas
were th~se established by Jose de Escandon between 1749
and 1755 on both banks of the Rio Grande, from Laredo to
the delta. However, due to the presence of many Spaniards
in the-hills and mountains just south of the Rio Grande for
over 150 years preceding this time, it is to be expected that
historic objects were obtained by South Texas Indians at
almost any time between 1583 and 1749.
Numerous surface collections have been made in this
region; particularly along both sides of the Rio Grande
valley.

No formal excavations were made, however, until

the University of Texas, supported by grants from the River
Basin Surveys of the National Park Service, made a thorough
survey of the FalcSn Dam reservoir area in Zapata and Starr
Counties, between 1950 and 1953. A large monograph on
this work, "Archeology, Ethnology, and Early Spanish History of the FalcSn Reservoir Area," has been prepared by
Krieger and awaits publication. Not only were numerous
prehistoric sites found in this survey, but ruins of early
Spanish buildings were found in at least 29 locations and
records made of them. Prehistoric sites now buried under
river sediments were very common, and two of them excavated (Cason, 1952; Hartle, mimeographed report to River
Basins--Survey). Bulldozers were used to remove the terrace silts,

PALEO-AMERICAN STAGE
No sites in Southwest Texas can be said to belong certainly to this stage. However, no less than 11 localities were
found in the FalcSn Reservoir area with mammoth bones in
deposits which could easily have contained associated artifacts, but these had largely been destroyed by erosion. In
one case, a flint chip was found beneath the skull of a mammoth (Cason, 1952, p. 243). A possible association of mammoth and lanceolate projectile point was noted by Jack To
Hughes on the Mexican side of the reservoir in 1950. A fragment of Plainview point and a more or less complete Angostufa point were found by Luis Aveleyra and Sra. Sol Rubin
de la Borbolla in a site near old Guerrero (now under Lake
FalcSn),â€™ which otherwise contained ordinary artifacts of
FalcSn Focus (see below). Hughesâ€™ survey in 1950 als0 collected a basal fragment of what is probably a Scot~sbIuf]
point, in a site otherwise clearly of FalcSn Focus. Mr. Frank
A1 Weir and Mr. Fred Ruecking, Jr., of McAllen, Texas, have
discovered two sites in Starr County north of Rio Grande
City, in which there are several fragments of Scottsbluff,
Plainview, and Angostura-like points, as well as one that
may be a Clovis although its fluting is rather indefinite. The
last-mentioned sites also yield large amounts of Falc6n Focus
material.
As so often in Texas, we cannot determine whether the
Paleo-American types of projectile points actually define
the presence of this stage, or whether they survived in small
numbers into cultural units which belong in an Archaic
Stage. So far as the authors are aware, only one true Folsom
point has been found in Southwest Texas, a very small specimen from Webb County, association unknown. There is no
reason to doubt that this area was occupied in early postglacial times, and the future definition of this stage is to be
expected eventually.
ARCHAIC STAGE
In the FalcSn Reservoir area, two loci are recognized
as belonging to this stage: FalcSn and Mier..They are based

Southwest; Texas

137

on about 28,000 a~tifacts collected by the University of Texas
and River Basin Surveys projects, and private collections
found in the same general area. Excavations proved beyond
doubt that FalcSn Focus remains are associated with both
the Zapata and the Rosita Terraces in this valley, which
reach heights of 65-70 feet and 40-45 feet above the Rio
Grandeâ€™s normal level (manuscript by Glen L. Evans). A
lower terrace, 20-25 feet above the river, is subject to frequent overflow and no archeological remains have been
found within it. Three terrace systems of roughly equivalent heights are widely known in the southwestern United
States and Great Plains, where they appear to belong to
early, middle, and late post-glacial â€™times in a very general
way. We know that the Zapata Terrace must be of ~considerable antiquity, for the river is never able to overflow
it, even during the tremendous flood of June, 1954. Excavations in the Royer Site conducted by Cason were in ~archeological zones buried as much as 11 feet beneath the original
top of this valley fill; therefore these zones were occupied
while the valley was still being alluviated up to this high
level, and before the fills which are now the lower terraces
were ever laid down.
In one of the high-terrace excavations, however, Cason
found a small, highly polished pendant of greenish limestone, in place, where it undoubtedly had been buried before
the Zapata Terrace reached its full height (Cason, 1952,
Plate 30, I). Polished-stone artifacts are never found in a
Paleo-American context anywhere in America, but they do
appear very widely in the Archaic Stage.

None of the

Paleo-American projectile-point types mentioned above were
found in Casonâ€™s Royer Site trenches, although this would
have been the proper place for them if the Zapata Terrace
were early post-glacial in time. We therefore wonder whether all three of the great post-glacial terraces in this valley
are of somewhat more recent date than comparable terraces elsewhere; that is, they may cover no more than 5,000
years rather than 10,000 or so. Terrace dating is not suf-

Texas ArcheoIogical Society

138

ficiently refined in Texas or elsewhere to make more exact
estimates.
This point is important because of its implications regarding the total time of existence of FalcSn Focus and its
later descendant, Mier Focus. Not only did typical FalcSn
artifacts, including large dart points, exist for at least several thousand years, but they appear to have continued in
use with virtually no change, right up to the Spanish colonizations in the 18th century. They were even found lying on
the floors of stone houses, along with iron, copper, glass, and
Spanish majolica ware!
With so little culture change, and such great numbers
of simple flint artifacts, it may be implied that Indians of
the Coahuiltecan linguistic family occupied Southwest Texas and Mexico across the Rio Grande for several thousand
years, never progressing beyond the simplest sort of existence, and never being influenced to any notable extent
by developments elsewhere. The notes made by Cabeza de
Vaca on the many tribes he encountered between the place
of escape and the "river of the gourds" (undoubtedly the
lower Rio Grande) agree very closely wi~h this archeological picture of the South Texas "Monte".
FalcSn Focus
COMPONENTS:
Type Components: Excavations in Sites 78-B9-4 (not
named) and 78-B9-17 (Royer Site: see Cason, 1952).
Other Components: About 111 sites in FalcSn Reservoir
basin in Texas, 20 sites in Mexico, and private collections from LaSalle, Dimmit, Webb, Duval, Zapata,
Starr, Hidalgo, Brooks, and other counties.
TYPES OF SITES:
Open camps of all sizes, from a few feet across to perhaps 80 acres, in banks of Rio Grande and tributary
rivers and arroyos, .as well as on rocky uplands well
away from any present water. Natural water holes

Southwest Texas

139

or "tinajas" are found in arroyos otherwise dry and
also have archeological sites nearby. In silty river
terraces, occupation sites are thin and separated by
layers of sediments, .but as many as 11 have been
traced in a single bank.
HOUSES:
No archeological data. Cabeza de Vaca describes houses
as made of poles covered with mats and carried about
from one camp to the next.
LIVELIHOOD:
Hunting of all kinds of game, eating of reptiles, insects,
grul~s, etc.,and preparation of mesquite meal described by de Vaca. He does not mention fishing but this
may be presumed from later accounts. Tunas, or
prickly-pear fruit were staple food in summer. Archeological sites revealgreat abundance of land-snail
shells which must also have been a food staple. No
animal or fish bones found in sites; de Vaca states
that the tribes he met pulverized all such bones and
ate them as gruel.
ARTIFACTS OF CHIPPED STONE:
Projectile Points:
Arrow Psints: Abseflt:
Dart Points: Tortugas type most common; also Abasolo, Re]ugio, and possibly Langtry, Shumla, and
Almagre. The last three are infrequent and may be
late in FalcSn Focus or belong to Mier Focus. Types
Plainview, Angostura, and Scot~sbluf~ present in
four known sites, probably as survivals from PaleoAmerican Stage.
Large, crude fist axes very common.
Knives: Triangular and leaf-shaped very common,
with bases convex, straight, and concave.
Scrapers: Heavy side scrapers common, oval. scrapers
less so. Heavy end scrapers common, With bits convex, straight, and concave (the latter are also .called

Texas Archeolbgical Society

140

"gouges"). End scrapers made across broken edges
of knife blades common.
Pick-like tools: Like fist axes but smaller in diameter
and chipped to a sharp point.
Gravers, very rare.
Drills, very rare.
ARTIFACTS OF GROUND STONE:
None definitely associated. Wooden pest]es used in dug
pits described by de Vaca for grinding of mesquite
beans.
ARTIFACTS OF POLISHED STONE:
One small pendant with two holes at each end definitely
associated.

ARTIFACTS OF SHELL:
One small circular bead fragment.
ARTIFACTS OF BONE AND ANTLER:
None.
MISCELLANEOUS TRAITS:
Polished stream pebbles found in all sites. Some are
white quartz and egg-shaped; others are oblong and
flat on at least one side, of all materials found in
gravels except flint. Definitely carried to Sites for
some purposes. Egg-shaped ones may have been
charms or amulets; flat ones possibly once painted
(see Pecos River Focus), but if so, no traces of paint
remain.
Fossil shells and concretions, probably also picked up
as charms.
Scraped pigments of hematite, limonite, and chalk.
BURIAL CUSTOMS:
Three flexed skeletons found but lack of artifacts prevents association with definite complex.
RELATIONS:
Tortugas and Abasolo dart points shared with Central

Southwest Texas

141

Texas Aspect, Pecos River Focus, Aransas Focus, and
several complexes in Tamaulipas.
Langtry, Shumla, and AImagre points, if they belong to
this focus, show relationship with Pecos River Focus.
Almagre points found southward into southern Tamaulipas.
Lack of stone grinding implements is unique in Texas
archeology.
ESTIMATED AGE:
Possibly 5000 B. C. to 500 or 1000 A. D.
SOURCES:
Krieger and Hughes (mimeographed preliminary report,
1950); Hartle (mimeographed report on Site 78-B9-4
(1951); Cason, 1952; Krieger, manuscript.
Mier Focus

This complex will~ not be described in detail, as it represents the continuation of FalcSn Focus traits plus the following changes: Tortugas and Abasolo points continue, but
alongside of them are distinctly smaller counterparts of the
same shapes and with beveled edges, named Matarnoros and
Catdn points by MacNeish in Tamaulipas; tiny arrow points
appear, of the Fresno and Perdiz types known widely in
Texas, and a local type with three concave edges named
Start points; the Langtry, Shumla, and Almagre points already mentioned for FalcSn Focus possibly belong to Mier
instead; and a half dozen stone pestles found in prehistoric
sites may belong to this focus.
While this is admittedly scant evidence for another foCUS, it has some justification in that the Matamoros and
Catdn points do have chronological significance in the coastal
section of Texas. They occur in the pre-ceramic Aransas
Focus and probably continue into association with pottery
in Rockport Focus; they occur in the Rio Grande delta area
in Brownsville Focus, where Huastecan pottery Occurs as
trade ware (information from Campbell). In southern

142

Texas ArcheologiCal Society

Tamaulipas, the two large types Tortugas and Abasolo are
pre-ceramic, whereas their two descendants, Matamoros
and Catdn, are found in pottery levels (information from
MacNeish). Tortugas and Abasolo points occur widely in
Central and Western Texas, but the smaller Matamoros and
CatCh points do not. The appearance of the latter two types
may therefore be expected to mark a certain time horizon
in the FalcSn area. Probably the small arrow-point types also
have chronological significance and appeared later in thi~
area than the Mata~noros and Catdn points; still they must
have been pre-European.
A Mier Focus is thus transitional between FalcSn Focus
and the historic horizon. It might also be regarded as a late
phase of FalcSn Focus.
NEO-AMERICAN STAGE
This is not present in Southwest Texas. The native
tribes remained without agriculture or pottery until they
were taught these~arts by the Spanish friars. The bow and
arrow alone would be insufficient reason to establish this
stage.
HISTORIC STAGE
Indians of the Coahuiltecan stock were once qu~i~e thickly populated along the Rio Grande from Eagle Pass downward, and along its Mexican tributaries. For over 200
years they bitterly resisted Spanish enslavement and encroachment on their lands. In spite of this, the friars managed to pacify some of them, teaching them Spanish arts
and crafts (pottery-making, stone masonry, carpentry, smithing, etc.), and irrigation agriculture. Certainly by the middle
18th century there were some thousands of "civilized" Indians, not only around the missions, but back in their native
homes as well. After 1800 they rapidly became extinct due
to depredations of the Apache and Comanche and taking
sides in various wars: Mexicoâ€™s independence from Spain,
independence of Texas from Mexico, the United Statesâ€™ war
with Mexico, and even the Civil War. The Coahuiltecan

Southwest Texas

143

stock is believed to have been totally extinct for at least
50 years.
This interesting history of acculturation is partly reflected in the archeological work in FalcSn Reservoir basin,
where 29 ancient stone buildings were identified, measured, and photographed before the lake rose. over their
ruins. Excavations were made in six of them, and in four
were found mixtures of Indian and Spanish artifacts on
the floors. This indicates that the houses themselves were
in some cases built by Indians after Spanish instruction.
Great amounts of a peculiar pink pottery were found in such
sites, not wheel-made and easily distinguished from the
wheel-made, glazed, and painted wares made by the Spanish
themselves.
While no evidences of irrigation ditches were found for
the colonial period in the FalcSn area, it is likely that agriculture was learned by at least some of these Indians.

EAST TEXAS
East Texas is herein defined as all of the State lying
east of the middle course of Trinity River, southward to
the Coastal Area, and northward to Red River. It isa
uniform natural geographic province, quite distinct from
the rest of Texas, and contains extensive forests of hardwoods and pines. Before the white man destroyed much of
the forest for agriculture, it was even more extensive. With
its subhumid climate and vegetation it is a natural part of
the f~orested Eastern United States in general. Several species of oak, elm, ash, hickory, gum, pine, etc. are the dominant trees. Toward the west and northwest this part of
Texas becomes increasingly open prairie.
No part of East Texas rises more than a few hundred
feet above sea level, hence it is technically within the
Coastal Plain physiographic province. The actual coastal
strip of flat, sandy ground extends inland some 60 to 8{}
miles and is within the Coastal Area as we have defined
it in that section. Farther inland, in East Texas proper, the
country is rolling to hilly with numerous shallow alluvial
valleys and many streams. This part of Texas also conforms
to a distinctive archeological province, namely, the "Caddoan
Area". This extends beyond the boundaries of East Texas,
embracing large portions of Louisiana, Arkansas, and Oklahoma in addition.
Almost all of the historic native tribes of the "Caddoan
Area" spoke dialects of the Caddoan linguistic stock and
possessed a generally similar culture. They were skillful
farmers and lived in permanent villages of well-made
houses; the walls were of poles set upright and covered with
wattle which was then plastered with clay. Their ceramic
arts were among the finest of the New World, not only in
variety of vessel forms, but in techniques of decoration and
an almost limitless variety of patterns (see Plates 1 to 70).
Archeological material in East Texas which precedes
the Caddoan in the pre-ceramic Archaic Stage is also notably
distinctive from the rest of Texas; it shows affiliations with

East Texas

145

the Archaic Stage of Louisiana, Arkansas, eastern Oklahoma,
and the rest of the Eastern States, whereas to the west there
is a sharp difference with the Archaic of Central Texas.
Thus a strong break in artifact types and cultural development seems to have existed for a long time--probably for
two or three thousand years or more--in the lands to the
east and west of Trinity River. This may have been due to
the strongly different natural environment in these two
sections, but if so, this environmental difference was much
less effective in glacial and early post-glacial time, for in
the Paleo-American Stage, East Texas shows nothing very
distinctive from the remainder of the State.
PALEO-AMERICAN STAGE
Only one excavated site may possibly be associated with
this stage, the Malakoff Site in Henderson County, where
three large stones have been found, carved into crude but
definite semblances of human heads (Sellards, 1930, 1941).
This remarkable discovery has not received due attention
from students of ancient man in America, and has been
ignored in practically all compilations of "Early Man" culture traits. In !929, the first of these carved heads was
found by a gravel contractor at the bottom of a pit in a
terrace overlooking Cedar Creek, a tributary of Trinity
River in Henderson County; it was briefly described by
Sellards (1930).
In 1935 a second head was found by another gravel contractor, and in 1939 the third one was found during an excavation for recovery of Pleistocene fossils by a project
conducted by the Texas Memorial Museum and WPA. The
third pit was close to the first one of 1929, but the second
was about 1,000 feet from them. In all three cases the heads
rested on bedrock at the base of Terrace C of Cedar Creek
and nearby Trinity River. The circumstances of discovery
were open to question and it seemed possible that the heads
had been carved and buried by modern people as a fraud
or joke. However, the details of the heads themselves, and
the circumstances of discovery, and the integrity of the per-

!46

Texas Archeological Society

sons involved were carefully investigated by Evans and SeN
lards, and the case appears to be conclusive that these heads
were carved by human beings well within the Pleistocene
period. The first and second are sandstone concretions
weighing 98% and 63~/4 pounds, respectively; the third is a
sandstone boulder weighing 135 pounds. Pleistocene vertebrate fossils lay above the carved heads in each case, in
finely laminated gravel and sand which was in primary
deposition. Significantly, these gravels are all quite fine,
with few stones more than fist-size, none anywhere near approaching the size of the heads. In Pit 1 were remains of
the Columbian mammoth, extinct horse (Equus compli~catus), and a sloth of unknown species. In Pit 2 the same
species of mammoth and horse were found, and sloth of
genus MegaIonyx. Pit 3 produced a fossil tapir. A fourth
pit, dug through the same terrace to bedrock some distance away, produced mammoth, mastodon, horse, camel,
llama, bison, beaver, sloth, peccary., and wolf--all of Pleistocene species now extinct--as well as other species which
have survived to modern times. While the lack of evidence
of human occupation or other artifacts is a distinct handicap
in this case, the heads unquestionably were carved to represent human beings, although very crudely. The eyes,
nose, mouth, and ears are shown and still fairly well preserved. Sellards (1941) illustrates two of them. The conclusion seems inescapable that the three heads, lying below undisturbed terrace deposits containing the fauna listed
above, must date well before the end of Pleistocene times.
East Texas reveals scattered occurrences of the usual
Paleo-American projectile-point types, but in contrast to
the rest of Texas, the Scottsblu]] type is most common. At
least 50 are known in private collections and doubtlessly
many more would be revealed in a thorough survey. The
Scottsblu]] type is also relatively common in northern Louisiana, particularly from sites in sandy upland country; quite
probably they have become buried by sedimentation in the
big valleys and, although present, practically impossible to
find. Most collectors, while unable to supply details, feel

East Texas

147

that ScottsbluIf points are of different origin from the general Archaic material, perhaps because they are often heavily patinated while the Archaic artifacts are not. Some
specimens have been found on sites mainly Archaic, others
are isolated finds. One has appeared in a grave in an Arkansas Caddoan site (Harrington, 1920, P1. CIX, d), probably having been picked up by later people.
The same lack of specific information applies to finds
of other types. The Plainview and Meserve types (very
similar except that the latter has beveled blade edges)
lumped together about equal the Sco~tsbluff points in frequency, so far as the writers have been able to determine.
These types likewise sometimes are found on sites of Archaic material, sometimes in isolated places. The Eden type
of the High Plains is never seen this far east. A few possible examples of Angostura points have been noted.
Fluted points are very rare in East Texas. True Folsom
points are unknown and the Clovis type is represented by
only seven or eight specimens in our present incomplete
records. Curiously, Clovis points are much better represented farther east, in northern Louisiana, where they come
from sandy upland locations (some fine ones are displayed
in the Louisiana Exhibit Building in Shreveport,. together
with Scottsbluff and PIainview points). A fragment of
fluted point was found in mound fill at the Davis Site
(Alto Focus) in Cherokee County (Newell and Krieger,
1949, Fig. 57 v); and two bases of Clovis points were found
during excavation of the Yarbrough Site near Grand Saline
in Van Zandt County by the University of Texas and WPA.
The Yarbrough Site had purely Archaic material in its lower
levels and potsherds from several Neo-American comPlexes
in its upper levels. The two Clovis fragments were not in
positions that would connect them definitely with either of
th~se divisions; as so often in Texas, the conditions of discovery do not permit a decision on whether the early types
actually continued to be manufactured into much later periods, or were picked up as curios by later people, taken to
their villages, and perhaps even used over again.

148

ARCHAIC STAGE
East Texas Aspect

Nothing on this Stage in East Texas has ever been published. It is unquestionably present, however, wherever
collecting has been done by amateurs and formal surveys
have been made by professional archeologists. As this includes virtually every county in this part of Texas, this
Stage constitutes a very important chapter in the State as
a whole, covering a large amount of material and at least
two or three thousand yearsâ€™ time. A major publication on
it is urgently needed.
It is commonly said by amateur collectors in East Texas
that they find more sites without pottery than with pottery,
which is saying a great deal if one considers the hundreds
of sites which do have pottery. The most common class of
artifacts is that of dart points of many types, other artifacts
being rare in comparison. The most common dart-point
types are not found in any quantity in other parts of Texas
west of the Trinity River valley, but some extend southward to the eastern end of the Coastal Area. Conversely,
some of the projectile-point types found very commonly in
Central Texas fade out rapidly east of the Brazos and Trinity
Rivers, constituting a very minor quantity in East Texas, if
present at all. Most of the Central Texas projectile-point
types do not occur and there are sharp distinctions in other
categories of material culture as well. This appears quite
strange in view of the probability that Archaic peoples lived
much the same life, in general, from one end of Texas to
the other. That is, they must all have existed by hunting,
fishing, and collecting wild plant foods; have lived in small
family or band units which roamed over a small area around
a more or less stationary village site; possessed only a simple
social organization; and had a much wider range of weapons,
implements, and utensils than their predecessors in the
Paleo-American Stage.
If, as we suspect, these Archaic peoples lived from perhaps 3000 B. C. to 500 or 1000 A. D. in Texas, why was this

East Texas

149

strong distinction in material culture between the East and
Central areas maintained so long? While we cannot answer
this question, it is certain that the East Texas Archaic material connects with the Eastern United States in general
(and with Louisiana, Arkansas, and eastern Oklahoma in
particular) more closely than with the rest of Texas. We
thus use the term "East Texas Aspect" in contrast to "Central Texas Aspect" of the Archaic Stage or pattern. A detailed comparison of types and frequencies from surface collections might well reveal sufficient distinctions for the definition of two or more loci, but as in the case of Central Texas
Aspect, more profound differences than shifting frequencies
of a few projectile-point types will be needed to establish
distinct loci.
There are also notable distinctions from the Archaic
remains east of the Mississippi River in that polished-stone
artifacts are comparatively rare. Beautifully shaped and
polished boatstones and bannerstones, stone pendants and
beads, plummet stones, etc., occur westward in impressive
quantity to the Red River valley in southwest Arkansas, but
as soon as one enters Texas they become very rare. For this
and other reasons, the East Texas Aspect would appear to
be distinct from Archaic complexes east of the Mississippi.
Whether or not it is also distinct from manifestations of this
Stage in Louisiana and Arkansas is difficult to say. The material described by Webb (1946, 1948 b) from northern Louisiana provides general similarities, as does that described
by Harrington (1920, pp. 103-110) frdm the Gulpha Site in
Arkansas. Too much is involved, however, for any sound
conclusions to be made as yet.
A provisional trait list of artifacts is given below. Nothing is known about dwellings or burial practices; no study
has been made of the size of villages. Artificially constructed mounds are in all probability absent. Shell middens--so prominent a trait for the Archaic people farther
east--are entirely missing in East Texas, so far as the authors are aware. Shell fish were consumed, for their shells

150

Texas Archeological Society

are found in these sites, but not in notable accumulations.
There is no indication of agriculture, but numerous sites
which lack pottery do have small arrow points on them,
of the Alba and perhaps other types. The bow and arrow
thus seem to have entered this area somewhat in advance
of pottery and agriculture, but arrow points do not become
frequent until the Neo-American Stage.
Dart Points: Gary type most frequent in all parts. Yarbrough, Wells, Kent most common; Morrill, Trinity,
C~rrollton, Elam, Edgewood, Ellis, Darl, PalmilIas less
so. Some types common in Central Texas Aspect, such
as Bulverde, Williams, Uvalde, I,ange, Lerma, and
Ensor, occur occasionally and decrease in frequency
toward the east; some may be intrusive but others are
made of local flints and cherts. Tortugas. points extend
into East Texas at the Davis Site in Cherokee County,
made of local flints. Most of the resident types are m~de
of either reddish-brown chert or gray and yellow flints
in varying proportions, but Ellis, Edgewood, and Bulverde are nearly always of flint. San Patrice points, described in Lousiana (Webb, 1946) occur rarely.
Spear Points: The Pogo type appears to be much too large
and heavy for use with the atlatl, and-is the only type
of this size in Texas. Many of them are of n0vaculite,
obtained from western Arkansas or eastern Oklahoma;
others are flint, chert, and ferruginous sandstone of local
occurrence.
Arrow Points: Alba and perhaps other types.
Drills or awls of chipped flint, usually with T-shaped base,
those re-chipped from broken projectile points being
almost unknown.
Tiny fist axes, chipped to sharp point.
Heavy end scrapers, piano-convex, with concave bit at one
end (so-called "gouges"), usually of brown ferruginous
sandstone.
Small piano-convex snub-nosed end scrapers with convex
bit; of flint; very rare.

East Texas

151

Small end-scrapers, bi-convex, made by chipping across the
broken blade of projectile points. They are thus of
whatever material the original point was made, and retain the stem for use as a handle. Very rare.
Albany type of scraper, assymetrical, with stem (described
by Webb, 1948) ; rare.
Full-grooved axes of fine-grained pale yellow sandstone and
quartzite, hard materials which made the axes useful
for chopping.
Full-grooved axes of hematite, often well polished but too
fragile for use in chopping. It may be suggested they
served as a medium of exchange.
Slabs of ferruginous sandstone with small hemispherical
pits; for cracking nuts?
Small milling stones of ferruginous sandstone, sometimes
with similar small pits around sill or on under side.
Small manos, generally unshaped, of ferruginous sandstone
and quartzite, sometimes with a small pit in center of
the grinding surface.
Tubular beads, of ferruginous sandstone and perhaps other
materials; rare.
Boatstones; very rare; probably imported.
Bannerstones; very rare; probably imported.
Pigments of hematite and limonite.
NEO-AMERICAN STAGE
By far the richest archeological remains in East Texas
are those of the Neo-American and Historic Stages. In this
area these terms are practically synonymous with the material culture of the prehistoric and historic Caddoan-speaking Indians. The earliest investigators, such as Clarence B.
Moor~ 1908, 1909, 1912), and Harrington (1920), who published their findings, worked in northwest Louisiana and
southwest Arkansas, doing a great amount of digging in
mounds and burial grounds. Besides recovering valuable
data on the size, shape, and method of constructing mounds,~

152

and mapping mounds in relation to village areas, these investigators obtained huge amounts of fine pottery and other
burial offerings. While Moore usually carefully noted those
objects which came from individual graves, he selected 0nly
a few of the best vessels and other artifacts for illustration.
For many graves he merely noted that "great masses of
broken pottery were piled in the corners" or a similar generality; an analysis of his collections provides a fine research
project which no one has yet attempted. Harrington illustrated numerous vessels but did not give grave data on
any of it.
,
Due to this lack of specific analysis, despite the amounts
of material recovered, the idea was perpetuated for many
years that all "Caddoan" culture constituted a single unit
occupying a short period of time, either on the historic level
or very close to it. This supposed unity was continued in
the work of Ford (1936) in charting the cultural remains of
Louisiana. As recently as 1951 and 1952, Fordâ€™s publications
continued to insist on the placement of all Caddoan remains
at the top of the chronological column for Louisiana.
The term "Caddoan" has been used in al! four states of
Louisiana, Arkansas, Oklahoma, and Texas wherever elaborate pottery has been found which contrasts with that of
surrounding regions in its range of vessel forms and decorative techniques. The most striking of these techniques,
if not always the most frequently seen, is that of "engraving". Whereas incised designs were made in still-plastic
clay before drying and firing, engraved designs were cut
through the finished, polished surface. The lines were made
to contrast more strongly with the background by rubbing
~ed ochre into them; the ochre has nearly or completely disappeared from many vessels, but in others may be found
nearly intact. White pigment was used quite often in some
foci, never in others. Pale blue pigment, and rarely green,
were also .used in a few loci.
tn embracing large parts of these four states, Caddoan
archeology may. be fairly compared with that of the Pueb-

East Texas

loan culture pattern in the Southwest United States, in area
and time depth if not in complexity. On the other hand,
controlled excavations in the Caddoan Area do not equal
one one-thousandth part of what has been accomplished in
the Southwest; and whereas the Southwest has been systematically explored for many years by scores of professional
workers and hundreds of assistants as a full-time occupation,
the analytical work in Caddoan archeology has all been done
by not more than six persons, each devoting but part of his
time to it. A single "amateur", Dr. Clarence H. Webb, has
done nearly all of this in northern Louisiana and aided
greatly in evaluating work in the other states.
Caddoan remains form a part of the great Mississippi
culture pattern, which ,once covered most of the Southeastern United States and much of the Middle West. Among
other traits, this pattern was featured by an intensive development of agriculture, considerable population density,
town life and complex social structure with priest and warrior castes, some large ceremonial centers, and the building of "temple mounds". These moun~ds were very numerous
in some areas and occasionally reached enormous size, reflecting control over considerable labor forces. Unlike those
of Middle America, these mounds Were never Constructed
with stone. They were erected entirely of clay carried by
basket-loads, usually but not always from large excavations
termed "borrow pits": As a general rule they are square or
rectangular in shape, with flat tops, steep sides, and once had
stairways on .at least one side, made of hardened clay or logs.
There are, however, many different forms of temple mounds,
some with one or more platforms on their sides, others with
small "super-structure" mounds erected on their flat tops,
and their shapes may be more like a T or L in some cases
than square. If there is a single trait generally diagnostic
of the Mississippi Pattern, it is the clay temple mound. In
spite of this, no study of these mounds, variations in size
and shape, or comparisons with the thousands known in
Middle America, has ever been undertaken. Their function,
like that of Middle American mounds and pyramids, is

154

Texas Archeological Society

presumed to have been that of a raised stage on which
important ceremonial events, prayers, rituals, dances, and
the like were performed.
In East Texas, true temple mounds are of rare occurrence, not more than 15 being known to the writers. They
are also rare in eastern Oklahoma but become more common in Arkansas and Louisiana, and still more common in
the Mississippi and other eastern valleys. The majority of
East Texas Caddoan- speaking tribes, throughout several
centuries of their history, therefore got along without
mounds. However, in their general material culture, large
and substantial houses, elaborate ceramics, burial of the dead
with copious offerings, stone and pottery pipes, ornaments
of shell, effigy pipes and vessels, and many other traits, their
culture plainly belongs to the MissisSippi Pattern. The trait
lists of various loci which follow will give the reader a fair
view of the level of culture attained by these people.
In 1941, after WPA excavation crews had been exploring Caddoan archeological sites for several years in Texas,
Oklahoma, and Arkansas, comparative analysis was begun
by Krieger, who examined sites in these states and Louisiana,
the WPA reports and many others made previously, as well
as the published papers. Dr. Webb was a constant collaborator with his wide knowledge of Caddoan archeology. In
1943 the first results were briefly reported at the Third
Round Table Conference in Mexico City (Krieger, 1944 b).
Twelve foci were outlined, with more anticipated. These
were grouped into two aspects, each forming a distinct general time period: the Gibson and Fulton Aspects. Foci of
the Fulton Aspect were found in all four states to occupy a
later time period than the Gibson, in stratigraphic position
in a few sites, and otherwise linke.d together by common
possession of certain traits as well as by trade pottery.
Any discussion of Caddoan archeology in East Texas
must beâ€™considered in relation to the whole four-state area,
or one lacks perspective on how these cultural units acted
upon one another. The Gibson Aspect included five loci:

East Texas

155

Alto in Texas and Louisiana; Gahagan in Louisiana; Haley
in the adjacent corners of Arkansas, Texas, and Louisiana;
Spiro in eastern Oklahoma plus one site in Arkansas and
two in Texas; and Sanders in Texas and Oklahoma on both
sides of Red River. The Fulton Aspect included.seven loci
at first: Titus, Frankston, and Shelby in Texasi Belcher in
northwest Louisiana and the adjacent corner of Arkansas;
Texarkana in the adjacent corners of Texas and Arkansas;
McCurtain (defined by Baerreis) in southeast Oklahoma and
adjacent Red River valley in Texas; and Glendora in Texas,
northern Louisiana, and a small part of eastern Arkansas.
Of these, only the Glendora was recognized as belonging
to the historic period, associated with European .trade goods;
and it was the most widespread of all twelve.
The original concept of Gibson Aspect has borne up
fairly well~ to the present day. New work in eastern Oklahoma by Bell, however, has revealed some material which
belongs to the Aspect but is difficult to assign to any of the
five loci, so that one or more new ones may be indicated.
In some sites, however, the material may simply constitute
mixtures of traits, as inevitably happens. Bell and Baerreis
(1951, pp. 48-53) outlined a Nelson Focus on the basis of two
excavated sites in Choctaw County, Oklahoma, north of the
Sanders Site in Lamar County, Texas, type site for Sanders
Focus. They state than only six pottery vessels were found
in three graves; that most of these vessels and the sherds
from the village area are of Sanders Focus types; and that
the Nelson Focus may actually be primarily a Sanders Focus
occupation with admixtures of Spiro Focus pottery and other
traits. Since all these loci are known to have shared some
traits (which is the reason they are grouped into "aspects"),
it appears doubtful that the Nelson Focus is a distinct complex. The two sites, so near those of Sanders Focus components in Texas, may simply belong to Sanders Focus, with
a somewhat greater Spiro admixture due to their position
closer to Spiro Focus components in Oklahoma, as one would
expect.
A general comparison of the Gibson Aspect loci, their

156

Texas Archeological Society

similarities and differences, affiliations with other cultural
units in the Eastern United States, and certain lines of evidence pointing to an origin of Mississippi culture elements
in southern Mexico (or even in Guatemala), have been discussed by Newell and Krieger (1949, pp. 193-219).
The Fulton Aspect has undergone several changes. The
"Shelby Focus" was dropped or rather incorporated into
Webbâ€™s Bossier Focus, components of which occur widely
in northern Louisiana but less so in extreme eastern Texas.
A ceramic complex in the Ouachita River valley of southwest Arkansas, described by Dr. and Mrs. T. L. Hodges
(1943, 1944-45), became the basis for a Mid-Ouachita Focus
at the suggestion of Dr. Webb. A Fort Coffee Focus was
added in eastern Oklahoma by Orr (1946). Lehmer (1952)
added a Turkey Bluff Focus in the same general area.
Whereas Krieger (1944 b; 1946) had considered Frankston
Focus in the central part of East Texas as primarily prehistoric but extending into historic times, it was later decided to establish an Allen Focus for the historic material
(Newelt and Krieger, 1949, p. 191). Frankston is now considered entirely pre-European.
Thus two of the 11 Fulton Aspect loci are now considered to represent the historic Caddo tribes: Allen Focus for
the Tejas (Hasinai) Caddoan-speaking tribes; and Glendora
Focus for the Cadohadacho and their neighbors in the Red
River valley and lands farther east. Most of the Fulton
Aspect prehistoric loci reveal traits which unquestionably
developed directly into those of the historic Caddo. Two
sites .in Cass County known as the Hunt and Clements
Places also have produced a few objects of iron and glass
beads in graves with highly developed pottery. Their particular pottery types and other artifacts do not agree well
with either Glendora or Allen Focus, so that an additional
Hunt Focus may eventually be defined. At .present, however, we consider the two sites to provide a transition between Titus and Texarkana Foci on the one hand, and historic Glendora on the other.

No further mention of the Nelson, Fort Coffee~, and
Turkey Bluff Foci will be made herein, as none are directly
involved in East Texas archeology, and the available information on them appears in the references cited above. The
others either are represented by components in Texas or
are instructive in determining the closest relationship of the
Texas units.
It is still very difficult to arrive at reasonably accurate
datings for Caddoan archeology. The first estimates (Krieger, 1944 b) are now considered naive, for they were made
simply to conform with the estimates then current in the
Southeast and Middle West. In the past five years, Carbon
14 age determinations and more serious considerations of the
whole scale of development of native culture in the Eastern
United States have brought about a general lengthening of
the previous overly conservative estimates. For example,
the Hopewellian culture in the Middle West was once confidently "dated" at 1000 to 1200 A. D. and the entire Mississippi culture "dated" at 1200 to 1500 A. D. or even from 1400
to 1700 A. D. Carbon 14 dates have now been obtained on
several Hopewellian sites which consistently fall between
300 B. C. and the time of Christ. While still open to argument, there has lately been a strong tendency to accept this
date: If Hopewellian can be set back by 1300 years, one
naturally expects that Mi~sissippian culture also must be set
back; but no two persons will yet agree on how much. A
backward extension of Mississippian dates certainly allows a

158

Texas Archeolog~cal Society

great deal more freedom for the development of its many
locally specialized manifestations, the tremendous spread of
temple-mound construction and agriculture depending on
advanced races of maize, the many distinctive ceramic complexes within the Mississippian tradition, and so on.
The question of dating Gibson and Fulton Aspect loci
thus is not a local problem, but one and the same with that
of gaining better perspective on the whole Mississippian
pattern. In East Texas there are no evidences of Woodland
or Hopewellian culture intervening between the Archaic
and Mississippian remains, which means that the Archaic
Stage must have lasted longer in East Texas than it did east
of the Mississippi valley. Thus the Archaic dates in other
areas which indicate occupancy from about 3500 to 500 B. C.,
if directly applied to East Texas, would mean thit Mississippian culture appeared as early as 500 B. C. because there
is no real break between the two. Many Archaic traits in
East Texas, particularly the same projectile-point types,
continued in use among peoples of the Gibson and even the
Fulton Aspect, so we cannot postulate a long period of depopulation between them.
An initial date of 500 B. C. for the beginning of Mississippian culture in East Texas (the Gibson Aspect in this
case) would, on the other hand, be very hard to. believe.
One Carbon 14 determination has been obtained on the Alto
Focus, which we regard as the earliest Caddoan unit. This
is approximately 400 A. D. Ã· -- 175 years (Krieger, 1951 a),
obtained on charred corn from a house floor under the Davis
Site mound. There is some reason for accepting this as the
approximate beginning date of the Neo-American Stage in
East Texas, because the Davis Site also revealed evidence of
trade in the form of potsherds derived from the pre-Mississippian Marksville complex in Louisiana, and because of
certain traits held in common by some Gibson Aspect loci
and late Hopewellian culture (of which Marksville forms
a part).
Others, such as Ford and Griffin (in Phillips, Ford, and

East Texas

159

Griffin, 1951; and Ford, 1951, 1952) argue that these relationships and trade pottery are irrelevant and the Mississippian culture must be dated much later. Griffin would correlate Alto Focus with the Coles Creek complex in Louisiana at perhaps 900 A. D.; Ford prefers a correlation with
the Plaquemine complex at about 1200 A. D. although no
one else would now insist on such a late dating. What is
needed is not more guesswork but better analysis of the
whole Mississippi Pattern in its early and late phases everywhere, and many more Carbon 14 dates.1 For the present,
an "estimated age" on each of the following trait lists can
only be regarded as a reasoned guess. The pre-European
Fulton Aspect loci have, for the raost part, been allotted a
span of about 1200 to 1500 A. D. In each case the focus may
have come into existence somewhat earlier or somewhat
later than 1200 A. D., or it may have lasted until perhaps
1600. After about 1600, however, we have to allow for the
possible appearance of European material among the Caddo
tribes through a purely native trade network from New
Mexico or. northern Mexico (see Historic Stage, below). We
should also point out that if 1200 A. D. seems too early a
beginning date for Fulton Aspect units, there are three
known cases of Coles Creek trade sherds: one from the A.
P. Williams Site, a pure Titus Focus component in Titus
County, and two from the Texarkana Focus component of
the Hatche! Site in Bowie County.
For Gibson Aspect loci, we have entered estimates like

1. As this goes to press we note the announcement of four Carbon 14 age determinations on wood from the central tomb of the
Craig mound at Spiro, Oklahoma, type component for Spiro Focus
(Oklahoma Anthropological Society, Newsle*iez, Vol. 4,â€™No. 1, April
1955). These were determined in the University of Michigan laboratory. Three runs on Sample 14 gave 2400, 1800, and 203~+--500
years, which in our calendar would be about 450 B. C., 150 A. D.,
and 100 B.C., respectively. One run on Sample 54 gave 640+--250
years or about 13â€™00+--250 A. D. While the first three dates are not
extremely divergent and come rather close to those now accepted
for Hopewellian culture in the Middle West (there are several traits
in common between Spiro and Hopewell), the fourth makes the true
date of Spiro even more puzzling. Further determinations will be
needed for a decision.

160

Texas Archeological Society

"500 to 1000 A. D. or part thereof" to indicate that we do
not know the dates any more exactly. Each focus is not
supposed to have lasted anything like 500 years, but to have
existed during some part of this span. The Haley, Sanders,
and Bossier Foci provide transitions for which even these
estimates are difficult to apply; we have said "about 100(~
to 1200 A. D." for want of more definite information.
In the type descriptions of Caddoan pottery (Plates 170) two items have been omitted in order to fit the pages.
Under "Paste" the first item should in each case be "Method
of Manufacture: Coiled". All Caddoan pottery was made by
a coiling method--that is, by adding rolls of clay in a continuous spiral from the base upward to the lip. Hardness
has been omitted as well, for it ranges between 1.5 and 2.5,
and averages 2.0, for nearly all Caddoan pottery. A few exceptions have been noted in the description.
A conference on pottery typology was held at the home
of Dr. Clarence H. Webb in Shreveport in August, 1950, attended by Webb, W. G. Haag, J. L. Cotter, L. E. Howard, R.
L. Stephenson, and A. D. Krieger. Many Caddoan types
were reviewed with specimens and photographs, most of
those previously established by Webb and Krieger being
accepted with little modification. Several new ones were
defined which, if not published until now, bear a notation under "References" that they were established at the Shreveport Conference in 1950. One type, Wilkinson Punctated, was
considered invalid because it consists mainly of fingernailpunctated jar-body sherds from vessels which bore other
decorations on their rims, and are thus now classified under
other types.
In the trait lists below, we present only the barest outlines of the complex ceramics and other features of culture.
Many minor groups of pottery have been omitted, and the
utility pottery of most foci remains to be analyzed more
thoroughly. Most Caddoan loci are most readily recognized
through their engraved types and others of special n.ature.
The general absence of plain types herein is due to the fact

East Texas

161

that, with one exception, Caddoan loci simply do n.ot have
much completely undecorated pottery; the proportion is
geperally less than five per cent, and sometimes only two
or three per cent. Plain vessels, when they do occur, reveal
practically all the forms present in the focus as a whole.
The notable exception is Sanders Focus, in which about 60
per cent of the total is plain and included in one type: Sanders Plain. The type McKinney Plain of Texarkana Focus
is also described and illustrated here because its form differs from other types in this focus. Tracing the history of
developments within this framework must await another
publication; this study will only provide some orientation
for the student.
Alto Focus (Gibson Aspect)
The definition of this focus is based primarily on excavations made by the UniVersity of Texas and WPA in 19391941 at the George C. Davis Site in western Cherokee County.
An extensive monograph has been published (Newell and
Krieger, 1949), to which the reader is referred for details
on all the cultural material as well as on the relationships
of Alto Focus with other loci of Gibson Aspect, the southeastern United States, and cultures of southern Mexico and
Guatemala.
The Davis Site is located on a large alluvial terrace called Mound Prairie, about one mile east of the Neches River
bridge on State Highway 21. It contains three mounds surrounded by: extensive village areas, and like many Gibson
Aspect Sit~s, appears to have been an important economic
a.~d ceren~nial center. Only the largest of the three mounds,
an L-shaped, flat-topped structure, and the village area adjacent to it; on the south side of the highway, were excavated. Despite the extent of these excavations, no evidence
of graves was encountered.- No evidence of cremation was
found either, hence it is certain that the dead were disposed
of in the vicinity in some way yet to be discovered. This
lack of data on burial method and the nature of mortuary
offerings, which were quite elaborate in other Gibson Aspect

162

Texas Archeological Society

foci, poses a considerable handicap in comparing Alto Focus
with them. The graves of Gahagan Focus in northwest
Louisiana contained few pottery vessels, but all of these are
of types common in Alto Focus; therefore it is possible .that
the burial complex described herein for Gahagan Focus was
more or less paralleled at the Davis Site.
Components of Alto Focus have been found over a very
wide area reaching as far west as the Brazos River at the
Chupek Site above Waco (Watt, 1941) and as far east as
north-central Louisiana. However, such sites are exceedingly few in number for the extent of the area in which they
occur. Most include at least one mound definitely of artificial
construction, but west of the Neches River valley no true
mounds are known to us.
The Davis Site occupation was divided into three phases,
with certain changes in the comparative popularity of certain pottery types, the house patterns, and miscellaneous
artifact types (Newell and Krieger, 1949, pp. 186-192 and
Tables 1-19). The traits below are lumped for the entire
occupation.
COMPONENTS:
Type Component: George C. Davis Site, 6 miles west of
Alto, Cherokee County.
Other Components: McDonald Site, Anderson County;
Keith and Hale Sites, Titus County; Chupek Site, McLennan County (Watt, 1941) ; Site 9 in survey of David
Wilson, Brazos County; Mound Plantation, Smithport
Landing, Wilkinson, Allen, Colbert, and Greer Sites in
northwest Louisiana (Webb, 1948). Most of these are
briefly discussed in Newell and Krieger, 1949, pp. 196197. The Greer Site in Louisiana is not the same as
the historic Greer Site in lower Arkansas River valley
(Moore, 1908). The Allen Site in Louisiana is not the
same as the type site for Allen Focus in Cherokee
County, Texas.
TYPES OF SITES:
Large village areas around mounds.

In some cases, both

East Texas

163

temple mounds and burial mounds present; in others,
only a single temple mound. From Neches River valley westward to middle Brazos River are a few small
sites with village refuse but no mounds; none has
been excavated.
HOUSES:
Floor plans round, oval, and square with diagonal corners at Davis Site, found in village area and at different levels inside the mound. Features include centerpost (evidence that house was constructed in some
cases around living tree as centerpost, then tree cut
down and house stood without central support); fire
basin more or less in center of house, sometimes claylined; scattered posts or props; shallow cache pits,
oval and with step at one end, lined with hard clay;
entrance gained through any of several gaps in walls;
entranceway passage in a few cases indicated by parallel trenches; wattle and plaster walls; and (presumably) thatched grass roofs. Houses probably very
substantial and ranged in diameter from 21 to 50 feet.
EARTHWORKS:
One flat-topped temple mound at Davis Site, roughly Lshaped, constructed of clay from edge of terrace and
from village area, containing numerous potsherds (no
borrow pit in terrace itself). Also a conical mound on
opposite side of terrace to north, and third mound
which may have been flat-topped and rectangular
originally but is now plowed down and more rounded
in outline (neither has been excavated). Other components have one small flat-topped mound, one flat
and one conical mound, etc.

LIVELIHOOD:
Agriculture indicated by numerous fragments of charred corn cobs, but no other domesticated plants noted.
Economy supplemented with wild nuts, berries, seeds,
fruit; by hunting (primarily deer); and shell-fish
gathering.

Gahagan Focus (Gibson Aspect)
This focus has been established on the basis of excavations in a single site, at the flagstop of Gahagan on the west
bank of Red River in De Soto Parish, Louisiana. This is
about 40 miles downstream from Shreveport. The Gahagan
Site and Focus are of interest to Texas archeology because
they supply clues to what the burial customs of Alto Focus
may have been.
Only three graves have been excavated at Gahagan, but
they were extremely large and contained a wealth of offerings. Pottery was scarce compared with other artifacts, but
the few vessels are all of types common in Alto Focus:
Holly Fine Engraved, Hickory Fine Engraved, and Davis Incised. The last-mentioned type applies to a vessel called
"Coles Creek Incised" by Webb and Dodd (1939) before the
Davis Incised type was known.
Clarence B. Moore was the first to explore Gahagan,
noting "many mounds" there in 1912. In the largest of these,
Mound A, he discovered one large grave with five skeletons
and rich offerings. Since then, rapid erosion of the Red
River west bank has gradually cut back the site, destroying
most of the mounds. In 1938 Webb and Dodd found only
three remaining but one of them was Mooreâ€™s Mound A.
They excavated it more widely and deeply, finding two more
very large graves with multiple burials and numerous offerings (Webb and Dodd, 1939). The site has now disappeared
for all practical purposes, but by observing the bank from
time to time as it was cut back, Webb has been able to trace
the original village surface beneath the present ~loodplain
surfac.e. This village was at least one-half mile across, indicating a very large site. It has since been buried under about
18 inches of fine sediments. Except for the mounds and
graves, there is an almost complete dearth of artifacts and
refuse, suggesting that the ground around the mounds may
once have been swept clean--a trait also noted in Adena

168

Texas Archeological Society

sites in the Middle West and in Middle American sites.
The size of Gahagan graves is of great interest, as they
reflect an unusual amount of work in connection with burying the dead. Mooreâ€™s grave was 13 feet 9 inches by 9 feet 8
inches a~d its floor 11 feet below the mound surface from
which it had been dug; it contained five skeletons extended
on their backs, four of them parallel with the four walls of
the pit, the fifth more or less in the center on the long axis.
Webb and Doddâ€™s first grave was also rectangular, 19 feet
6 inches by 15 feet, and 8 feet deep: it contained seven
skeletons, six in a row parallel to one another, and one at
right angles to the others. Their second grave was 12" by 11
feet, 8 feet deep, and contained three parallel skeletons in
a row. Personal adornments had been left on the bodies as
worn in life, but the quantities of other offerings had been
placed in piles along the pit walls and in the corners, well
away from the bodies.
As Moore (1912) and Webb and Dodd (1939) give
ground plans of these graves and illustrate many of the
finest artifacts, these are not repeated here. A discussion
of the similarities and differences between Gahagan, Alto,
and other Gibson Aspect foci, and comparisons between
Gahagan burial customs and those of Midwestern Hopewellian culture, will be found in Newell and Krieger (1949).
To judge by the black color and fine polish of its engraved
pottery, Gahagan may be cross-dated with Phase 1 of the
Alto Focus at the Davis Site in Texas.
Besides the three pottery types already mentioned,â€™ other
artifact types in common between Gahagan and Alto Focus
at the Davis Site are: long-stemmed pottery pipes with tiny
bowls near one end, Copena type knives with recurred
edges, flint end scrapers, Alba type arrow points, manos,
petaloid celts of greenish stones, adze blades ("flat celts"),
hones of white Catahoula Sandstone, hammerstones ("pecking stones"), unworked quartz crystals, pulley-~haped stone
e.arspools with concentric circles grooved on outer face, and
the probably intentional breaking or "killing" of artifacts.

Gahagan has, on the other hand, produced a number of
artifact types, most of them supposedly of ceremonial function, not so far found in Alto Focus. The rich and widespread ceremonial complex known as the "Southern Cult"
is not present at Gahagan if this Cult is chiefly identified
by carved and incised conch shells and gorgets, human figures embossed in thin copper plates, and monolithic axes,
none of which have appeared there. Gahagan does, however, share in a number of "ceremonial" traits of an early
Mississippian culture stage which are much more widespread than the specialized "Southern Cult" complex. These
traits include spatulate celts, copper-covered stone and wood
earspoo!s, human and animal effigy pipes of stone and pottery, discoidal stones, shell beads, copper-covered wooden
beads, etc. (see full list in Webb and Dodd, 1939).
In summary, it might be argued that the Davis and
Gahagan Sites actually constitute only one focus (Alto
Focus components are found in northwest Louisiana as well
as Texas), Davis revealing more of the everyday material
side of life, Gahagan more of the religious side with its
treatment of the dead. On the other hand, no known component of Alto Focus has yet revealed anything like the
great Gahagan graves or the majority of its "ceremonial"
artifact types. It is to be hoped that somewhere in East
Texas or northern Louisiana there is a site which will combine these complexes.

Haley Focus (Gibson Aspect)
This focus occupies a relatively small area in southwest Arkansas and adjacent corners of Texas and Louisiana.
Although trade vessels are known in Oklahoma, no components have been reported there. The type site is a burial
mound at the Haley Place on the west bank of Red River in
Miller County, Arkansas, a few miles east of the Texas

170

border. The mound was excavated by Moore, who described the graves in detail and illustrated some of the
finest specimens (Moore, 1912). The mound was later destroyed by levee construction.
Among the many mounds and burial grounds excavated
in Hempstead County, Arkansas, by Harrington (1920), at
least two sites, Washington and Ozan No. 1, produced artifacts closely similar to those from Haley. Using these three
sites as a nucleus, Krieger (1946, pp. 213-218) defined a
Haley Focus. It was then possible to recognize several other
components: at the Crenshaw mounds on Red River above
Haley Place, also excavated by Moore (1912) and later by
Judge Lemley, Glenn Martin, and M. P. Miroir; the lower
component of Hatchel mound in Bowie County, Texas (see
Texarkana Focus for notes on this site); the Handy Site, a
cemetery area near Battle mound in Lafayette County, Arkansas (Moore, 1912, describes this mound and illustrates
vessels which belong to its later component); a lower component of Battle mound itself, revealed by excavations in
1948 by Krieger and Lynn Howard; the lowest level (IV)
of Belcher mound in Caddo Parish, Louisiana (Webb and
Dodd, 1941; Webb, 1948); and East mound in Clark County,
Arkansas, excavated by Dr. Robert Proctor of Arkadelphia
and the Huddlestons. Newell and Krieger (1949, Figs. 63-65),
illustrate East mound vessels, and describe the divergences
of this site from others of Haley Focus.
In at least three of the above cases (Hatchel, Battle, and
Belcher mounds), the initial occupation and mound construction was by Haley Focus people. In each case there was
then a rather abrupt change in culture but the mounds continued to be increased in height and dimensions by the later
occupants. This later occupation was by Texarkana Focus
people at Hatchel, by Belcher Focus people at Belcher, and
by a mixture of the two loci at Battle. Some of this mound
increase was probably inciden.~tal to building and rebuilding
houses, the outlines of which were found in the excavations;
but some of it was also probably intentional.

East Texas

17!

As occupation was probably continuous from Haley Focus times into the later Fulton Aspect horizon, Haley Focus
in the heart of the Caddoan Area is of unusual importance. It marks the appearance of such ceramic features
as the use of handles (wide strap handles on polished bowls
as well as cooking jars), applique fillets and nodes, brushing
of jar surfaces as an alternative to incising, fairly extensive
use of red filming, and effigy vessels, all of which are completely absent (or nearly so) in Spiro, Gahagan, and Alto.
Sanders Focus is divergent from the others, but Sanders and
Haley are believed to have been approximately contemporaneous from trade vessels appearing in them in both directions.
Elsewhere in the Caddoan Area, the changes from Gibson to Fulton Aspect units are on ~he whole quite radical,
indicating not only a break in continuity but perhaps a
period of depopulation. Thus the continuities from one
Aspect to the other appear to have been centered about the
great bend of Red River in the Haley Focus, and after a time
of lapse in the surrounding areas, new influences emanated
from this center, establishing the Fulton Aspect units in the
four states.
A satisfactory trait list for Haley Focus is difficult to
make, as the large collections of Moore and Harrington have
been in storage for many years and the authors have been
able to judge them only by the few published illustrations.
Combining these with many other collections actually examined, the main outlines presented below should be reliable; eventually they should be amplified.

Sanders Focus (Gibson Aspect)
Sanders is the most divergent of all Caddoan loci. Its
pottery is characterized by simple straight-line designs and
a much higher proportion of entirely plain pottery than in
any other complex in the region. The usual Caddoan decorative techniques of engraving, incising, and punctating are
well represented; there is considerable red-filming; and the
variety of vessel forms is comparable to that of other foci.
Participation in the Southern Cult ceremonialism is expressed in carved and incised conch-shell gorgets and dippers, although hammered copper plates and most other Cult
traits are absent, so far ~as known.
The focus is based on data recovered from the T. M.
Sanders Site in the northwest corner of Lamar~ County near
the right bank of Bois Dâ€™Arc Creek, about one-half mile
south of the Red River. Other components for the most part
lie to the north, in southern Oklahoma, and to the south, as
far as the Yarbrough and Joslin Sites in the vicinity of
Grand Saline on the Sulphur River in Van Zandt County.
No components are known very far east or west of this belt,
which is essentially a prairie rather than forest. The culture
of Sanders Focus clearly reflects this frontier position between eastern forests and the Great Plains. Bison bones are
plentiful in the middens, and artifacts such as hoe blades
were fashioned from bison bones; the four-edged beveled
knives and stone elbow pipes are other Plains traits, not
found in Caddoan loci except those in Oklahoma in a similar
frontier position.
The Sanders Site has been described and its artifacts
and graves analyzed (Krieger, 1946, pp. 171-203 and Plates
16-29; Newell and Krieger, 1949, p. 218). Due to conditions
described in the first publication, only the artifact types
present in graves containing typical Sanders pottery have
been definitely included in the focus. The site was occupied by different cultural groups after the close of Sanders
Focus itself, probably by various Caddoans passing this way
on bison hunts.

East Texas

177

A correction should be made in the publications cited,
which state that the Sanders "mounds" probably were natural knolls on which the Indians had lived and buried their
dead, and that the site is farther west than those on which
true mounds are found. Visiting the site in 1952, Krieger and
Jelks were convinced that Mound 1 was a true burial mound,
and Mound 2 originally a rectangular temple mound with
a flat, rectangular top. Both are now considerably reduced
and rounded by many years of plowing. Furthermore, they
visited another artificial mound on the Morgan Place about
10 miles farther west in Fannin County; this lies on a second
terrace a short distance south of Red River, is larger in
lateral dimensions than Sanders Mound 2, and has a large
flat, rectangular top. While only 6 or 7 feet high, the Morgan
mound is doubtlessly artificial also. No cultura! material
has yet been found in or on it, but R. K. Harris informs us
he has collected Sanders Focus sherds in the fields nearby.
The trait list below is based primarily on the graves
excavated in Sanders Mound 1. Other components are
recognized through typical pottery.
COMPONENTS:
Type Component:

T. M. Sanders Site, Lamar County,

excavated by University of Texas in 1931, under direction of A. T. Jackson and B. B. Gardner.
Other Components: Part of remains excavated in 1940
by University of Texas and WPA on Fred Yarbrough
and T. M. Joslin farms near Grand Saline, Van Zandt
County; surface collections on small sites in Lamar,
Fannin, Wood, and Hopkins Counties. Morgan mound
in northeast corner of Fannin County probably belongs. Nelson Focus in Choctaw County, Oklahoma,
across Red River, contains sites with Sanders Focus
material (Bell and Baerreis, 1951).
TYPES OF SITES:
Some sites (Sanders, Morgan, Yarbrough) are large,
with one or more mounds, situated on terraces adjacent to large streams; others probably quite small,

Texas ArcheologicaI Society

178

without mounds, and on small tributary streams.
HOUSES:
One house at Sanders Site is reported to have been .rectangular, about 10 by 12 feet, with wall posts set vertically on three sides, fourth side left open. Burned
clay with stick and reed impressions indicate walls
constructed of wattle covered with clay; roof construction unknown. No information on fireplace or
entranceway; association of this house with focus
uncertain.
EARTHWORKS:
In 1931, after they had been plowed down for many
years, the Sanders site mounds were measured by
A. T. Jackson, as follows: Mound 1, which contained
the 21 burials he excavated, plus scores more plowed
up and dug by looters, was 175 feet long northeast by
southwest, 70 feet wide, and 4 feet high; Mound 2, a
temple mound at one end of which the house described
above was found, was 230 feet long north-south, 90
feet wide, and about 8 feet high with more or less
rectangular flat top. Both mounds were on the edge
of an upper terrace and the sides facing Bois Dâ€™Arc
Creek drop sharply downward to a lower terrace; they
have probably been partly dissected by eros{on. Morgan mound estimated to have been rectangular originally, about 220 feet long north-south and 150 feet
wide; flat top about 110 feet !ong north-south and 90
feet wide, rising 6 or 7 feet above terrace level. Yarbrough site contains a single small eminence, ~either a
.natural knoll or a~small..artificial structure, containing camp refuse but few burials.
CERAMIC TRAITS:
Pottery Types: Sanders Plain, Sanders Engra,~e~, Canton Incised, Maxey Noded Redware, and Monkstow~
Fingernail Punctated.
Temper: Coarse clay-grit, sometimes, including pulver-

East Texas

179

ized bone or potsherds, and small amount of sand.
Shell temper ~absent.
Features: Red film occurs frequently in Sanders Plain,
Sanders Engraved, and Maxey types. Small lugs or
strap handles appear on jars of Monkstown type; appliq.ue on Maxey type. Where decoration covers upper parts of vessels, lower parts are completely plain,
never brushed or fingernail punctated. This absence
of brushing is important distinction from Fulton Aspect pottery.
Long-stemmed pipes with small bowls, but somewhat
larger and thicker %han those in other Gibson Aspect
loci except Haley (see Haley Focus).
Disks with central hole, usually made from disk bases
of broken pottery vessels, sometimes from side walls;
usually believed to have been spindle whorls.
ARTIFACTS OF CHIPPED STONE:
Proj ectile Points:
Arrow Points: Bonham type.
Dart Points: Present at Sanders and other components, but association of specific types with focus uncertain.
Knives: Diamond-shaped, four-edged, with steep bevels
on all edges, resembling common Plains type but very
narrow in proportion to length. Most have edges polished as though from continued use.
Unshaped flint-spa!l scrapers with edge retouch.
Small snub-nosed flint scrapers.
Thick single-bitted and double-bitted axes, two wide
notches for halting (association uncertain).
ARTIFACTS OF GROUND STONE:
Milling stones, small with round or oval basin, may have
small round pits in sill around basin.
Manos, any suitable pebbles, used with rotary motion,
may have pitsin face.
Hones of sandstone.

as graves not enlarged proportionately. Skeletons extended on back or side with heads usually to east;
grave pits rectangular. Pottery placed about head and
shoulders of individuals, sometimes along sides and
between legs. Personal adornments left where worn
in life. In at least one grave, offering of vessels was
away from sl~eleton, against grave wall, the method
described for Gahagan Focus in Louisiana.
RELATIONS:
Southern Cult traits connect with Spiro Focus.
Bonham points closely similar to Alba points of Alto,
Gahagan, and Spiro Foci; also to Hayes points of Haley
Focus.
Bottle of Haley Engraved type at Sanders as trade ware;
bottles of Maxey Noded Redware at Haley Place as
trade ware.

ESTIMATED AGE:
Some part of span 800-1200 A. D. Sanders and Haley
Foci believed to be the latest in Gibsonâ€™ Aspect, but
partly overlapping Spiro, Gahagan, and Alto.
SOURCES:

Spiro Focus (Gibson Aspect)
The famous site near Spiro, on the south bank of Arkansas River at the eastern edge of Oklahoma, has been the
principal basis for defining a Spiro Focus. The University
of Oklahoma and WPA conducted .~x..~ensive excavations in
the Craig,. Brown, and other mounds at this site in 19381941 (Orr, 1939), as well as in other components of this focus.
A Spiro Focus was later defined (Krieg~r, 1944 b, 1946; Orr,
1946, 1952; Bell and Baerreis, 1951), but there ~as been considerable controversy over the number of loci present at
the Spiro Site itself. The Fort Coffee Focus (Orr, 1946, 1952)
was created to embrace remains in the same vicinity which
are clearly of later date than the great ceremonial complex
seen in the Craig and Brown mounds. Orr (1946) defined
Early, Middle, and Late Spiro components for this ceremonial material, but failed to make clear whether all were
included in the same focus. Krieger (1953) has criticized
this division, claiming that only Orrâ€™s Middle Spiro component should be considered equivalent to a Spiro Focus,
the Early component belonging to a preceding occupation,
and the Late component more akin to Haley Focus.

Eas~ Texas

183

The fabulously rich Craig mound at this site was senselessly dynamited by commercial "relic hunters" before the
WPA excavations were conducted, thus spoiling forever
much valuable evidence. Through the interest and hard
W~rk of a few individuals, a great deal of the looted material subsequently reached the safety of museums. An
attractive book is now available, illustrating the wealth and
diversity of these artifacts (Hamilton, 1952).
Recent researches by Beli in eastern Oklahoma have
shown that the definition of Spiro Focus is very complicated.
Since a strict definition has yet to be made, a trait list is
not feasible atpresent. However, it may be said that the
richest m~terial, particularly that belonging to the â€™~Southern Cult", provides the central core for a Spiro Focus which
is not only distinct from others in the Caddoan Area, but an
integral part of the Gibson Aspect (Newell and Krieger,
1949, pp. 199-202). Bell and Baerreis (1951) present a concise summary.
The Sa~nders Focus in northeast Texas provides a close
relative of Spiro, partly in ceramics and partly in ceremonial
elements such as carved and incised conch shells and gorgers.
Sanders is believed to date somewhat later than the climax
of Spiro Focus, as the shell work is sparse and poorly done
by comparison, some typical Sanders Plain and Sanders
Engraved vessels appear to belong to Orrâ€™s Late component,
and not a sign of typical Spiro pottery has been found at
the Sanders Site. On the other hand, two sites with typical
Spiro Focus pottery (Spiro Engraved and Hickory Fine Engraved) are known in Texas, but do not have Sanders pottery, so far as known. These are the Jaggers Site in Franklin County, and Mustang Creek burial mound in southern
Red River .County.
A-mong the traits shared by Spiro and Sanders Foci are:
erection of mounds, probably both temple and burial mounds,
extended burials with copious offerings, rectangular house
floors, conch-shell gorgets and whole conch shells made into
cups or dippers ~by removing the columnellae, spatulate

Texas Archeological Society

184

celts, copper coating on pulley-shaped stone earspools, and
stone pipes.
We illustrate only one Spiro Focus pottery type herein,
Spiro Engraved (Plate 64). Although similar to Holly Fine
Engraved of Alto Focus (Plates 34, 35), the lines are generally heavier and farther apart, small areas in the designs are
sometimes finely punctated (absent in Holly), the design
units are almost always repeated four times (true of bottles
in Holly type, but not bowls), and these designs often consist of a tight spiral filling each Of the four panels (rare in
Holly). While these differences are clear enough at the
Spiro and Davis Sites, about the great bend of Red River
in southwest Arkansas (notably at the Crenshaw mounds)
they tend to fuse so that classification is sometimes difficult.
Pottery types Crockett Curvilinear Incised and Hickory
Fine Engraved are held in common by Spiro and Alto Focus
(as well as Haley), as are arrow points of type Alba, Copena
knives with recurred edges, delicate long-stemmed pottery
pipes, and pulley-shaped stone earspools with grooved designs on the outer face. Thus, when such traits are found in
northeast Texas, it is hard to assign them to Spiro or Alto
Focus unless appropriate pottery types accompany them.
They would, at any rate, indicate the presence of a Gibson
Aspect unit of some kind rather than Fulton Aspect.

Frankston Focus (Fulton Aspect)
Components of this focus are centered in the upper
drainage system of Neches River, in eastern Anderson and
Henderson Counties; in Cherokee County except for the
southern end; in southern Smith County; and southeastern
Van Zandt County. The town of Frankston marks the approximate center of this "home area". Other components
are found more widely, but not in such concentration. One

East Texas

185

component is known at the Lane Mitchell Place 12 miles
southwest of Marshall in Harrison County, about 60 miles
northeast of the main area.
Frankston Focus is a late prehistoric complex, directly
ancestral to the historic Caddoan-speaking Tejas tribes,
while the historic Allen Focus represents, the Tejas tribes
themselves (also called Hasinai by the Spanish and Cenis
by the French). Several common types of Frankston Focus
pottery are found as trade ware in Wylie Focus in the Dallas
area (see North-Central Texas) and in components of the
Central Texas Aspect (see Central Texas) in the Brazos
and Colorado River drainages, occasionally even farther
west..The only projectile-point type positively associated
with this focus is the small, thin Perdiz type of arrow point
with barbs and a long, pointed stem. The Perdiz t~ype occurs
very widely over Texas west and south of the Neches River
valley, but only rarely to the east. Because of its position
on the southwestern periphery of the Caddoan Area during
Fulton Aspect times, Frankston Focus plainly reveals more
contact with the non-Caddoan people to the west than any
other Caddoan loci.
While l~rankston Focus lies in approximately the same
area as Alto Focus components in the upper NeChes valley,
its pottery and other artifacts are very distinct from the
latter, with almost no continuities. This indicates that there
was probably a period of depopulation in this area after Alto
Focus ended. Not only are the Frankston Focus vessels different in shape and design, but the common use of da~:k gray
and black pottery in Alto Focus was replaced by pottery of
yellow, tan, buff, and light brown colors in Frankston Focus.
Whereas Alto Focus contains no brushed vessel surfaces,
applique, effigies, or handles, all these traits are common
in Frankston Focus. Although it was contemporaneous with
Texarkana, Belcher, and McCurtain Focus, which made use
of shell temper and red film, neither of these traits ever
appears in Frankston Focus, so far as known. The diffusion
of shell temper and red filming simply never reached this

far westward in East Texas; they are not present in the preceding Alto Focus, nor in the succeeding Allen Focus on
the historic level.
The A. C. Saunders Site in Anderson County, a pure
Frankston component, was excavated in 1931 and 1935
(Jackson, 1936). It produced not only a very large, circular
house floor and a great ashy midden, but several thousand
potsherds. In Cherokee County near Jacksonville, the Omer
and Otis Hood Site was excavated in 1936 by the University
of Texas, producing nearly 200 vessels from gr~aves. During
the same year, several other components were excavated to
a less extent, with many graves and pottery vessels as well
as pipes and stone artifacts. The following trait list is based
principally on the Saunders and Hood Sites, with supplementary material from the others and from surface c01lections.
COMPONENTS:
Type Components: A. C. Saunders Site, Anderson
County, and Omer and Otis Hood Site, Cherokee
County.
Other Components:

J. M. Cook, R. E. Daly, Rose Dan-

iels, Isabel Donne~l, E. W. Ellis, Pace McDonald, F.
Murphy, Quate Place, J. D. Reagan, Royal Place, J. C.
Slaughter; and Mrs. Joe Watkins Sites in Anderson
County; De Rossett, L. B. Miller; and T. W. Thrasher
Sites in Henderson County; Mrs. J. W. Blackburn, G.
Ellis, P. Johnson, and J. M. Snow Sites in Cherokee
County; Yarbrough Site (part) in Van Zandt County;
numerous surface collections made in eastern Van
Zandt and Smith Counties by Jack T. Hughes; and
Lane Mitchell Site in Harrison County.
TYPES OF SITES:
Small communities near virtually every stream in area
as well as on sandy uplands; probably each had a
cemetery area in or next to the village.

Â¯ 18.7

HOUSES:
Only one excavated, at Saumders Site, was circular and
approximately 46 feet across; any of several gaps between wall posts could have been entranceways. Interior features included support posts in. irregular
positions and a firebasin (Jackson, 1936).
LIVELIHOOD:
Agriculture inferred (probably maize, beads, .and
squashes), as recorded for historic Tejas in l~e 17th
century, supplemented by hunting, gathering of wild
foods, and both fish and shellfish.
EARTHWORKS:
Mounds unknown except in one or two cases where
Frankston people used a small mound erected by Alto
Focus people (e. g., Pace McDonald Site).
CERAMIC TRAITS:
Pottery Types:

Poynor Engraved, BuIlard Brushed,

Maydelle Incised, LaRue Neck Banded, and KiIlough
Pinched all common; also effigy bowls with bird and
animal heads and tails on opposite sides of rim;
rattle bowls with four hollow knobs containing pebbles.
Temper:

Usually very coarse clay-grit, occasionally

mixed with pulverized bone or potsherds; rarely,
crushed limestone.
Features: Shell temper and red filming absent; brushed
surfaces common, on jars and on underside of bowls
with polished and engraved rims. Some small jars
and rattle bowls have four legs resting on a ring base.
Engraved designs simple" and consist mainly of arcs
set back-to-back to form ovals around rim; also "ladders" and simple triangles. Some ticking occurs but
rare compared, with Allen Focus.
Flat disks (spindle whorls?) madeÂ¯ by boring hole in
center of thick base of discarded jar, Occasionally in
a body sherd.

pottery type.Poynor Engraved.
Beads of baked clay, large, tubular.
ARTIFACTS OF CHIPPED STONE:
Projectile Points:
Arrow Points: Perdiz type, found commonly in graves
as well as midden.
Dart Points: Many types of Archaic Stage found on
these pottery sites but not in graves so association
doubtful. Those found most often are Gary, YarbrOugh, Palmillas, Elam, Ellis.
Scrapers: Small snub-nosed end scrapers rare; unshaped
spalls common.
Drills: Small, bases unshaped or T-shaped; rare.
Knives: Large, usually triangular with edges straight
to convex.
ARTIFACTS OF GROUND STONE:
Small milling stones of ferruginous sandstone, some with
pits in sill.
Manos of unshaped stream pebbles.
Hones of ferruginous sandstone.
ARTIFACTS OF POLISHED STONE:
Celts; small, thick, petaloid form, of fine-grained sandstones.

ARTIFACTS OF SHELL:
Mussel-shell "spoons" (whole shells beveled toward
smaller end).
Perforated mussel shells (pendants?).
Small pendants of conch shell.
Cylindrical beads made from conch-shell columnellae.
ARTIFACTS OF BONE AND ANTLER:
Flaking tools of deer ulnae.

Flaking tools of antler tines, tips blunt and round.
Awls of unshaped animal-bone splinters.
Beads made of sections of bird-leg bones.
Sections of antler with socket in one end (knife or drill
handles?).
BURIAL CUSTOMS:
Interments single, extended on back, with most ceramic
offerings placed around head and shoulders, occasiona!ly along legs or at feet. Offerings of pipes, arrow
points, beads, etc., in various positions.
RELATIONS:
Utility pottery types Bullard Brushed, Maydelle Incised,
and LaRue Neck Banded shared with Titus Focus.
Sherds of RipIey Engraved occur rarely as trade ware
in Frankston Focus. No trade relationships known so
far with other Caddoan foci.
FrankstOn Focus sherds are found widely to the west,
in Wiley Focus .and Central Texas Aspect, as trade
ware. Sherds have been noted as far west as Abilene
and San Antonio.
Arrow-point type Perdiz shared with late prehistoric
units of Coastal, Southwest, Central, and North-Central Texas.
ESTIMATED AGE:
1200-1600 A. D. or greater part thereof.
SOURCES:
Jackson, 1936; Krieger, 1946, pp. 206-212, 237-241, 266268; Newell and Krieger, 1949, pp. 191-192.
Titus Focus (Fulton Aspect)
Components of this focus are found entirely within
northeast Texas, principally in the valleys of the upper
Sulphur and Sabine Rivers and the numerous small valleys
between them, such as the Big and Little Cypress Creeks.
The heart of the area lies in Titus, Franklin, Morris, Camp,
and Upshur Counties, with a great many sites represented

190

Texas Archeological Society

by surface collections, looted graves, and a dozen or so small
excavations. Other counties inÂ¯ which numerous sites are
known are: Hopkins and Wbod on the west, southern Lamar
and Red River on the north, western Bowie and Cass, Marion, Harrison, Gregg, and northern Smith on the south.
While the pottery of Titus Focus is poorly made when
compared with that of Texarkana, McCurtain, lYiid-Ouachita, and Belcher Focus (not to mention that of the whole
Gibson Aspect), it presents a very large array of vessel
forms and decorative patterns in such endless combinations
that it is probably the most difficult of all to classify.. The
University of Texas collections alone contain over 2,000 vessels belonging to this focus. The richest known site is that
on the H. R. Taylor-~farm in Harrison County, where more
than 550 vessels were found with 64 burials, one of which
contained 35 vessels and other artifacts. The Russell Site
in Titus County, Cash Site in Camp County, and Riley Site
in Upshur County, were nearly as rich although fewer graves
were found.
Titus Focus ceramics are featured by much lighter colors
than those of other Fulton Aspect loci except those farther
west, Frankston and Allen. The paste is usually light gray,
buff, tan, and cream and the cores slate gray. Red film is
not uncommon and when designs were cut through it, the
light colored paste underneath provided good contras~ with
the red--much more so than in the dark ware of other loci.
The engraved designs were executed with bold, forceful
lines usually of careless draftsmanship, although some may
be ~laSsed as excellent. The material culture of Titus Focus
appears to have been centered on producing large amounts
of pottery; it is otherwise poor, featured mainly by clay
pipes and numerous finely made triangular arrow points
of the Talco type. There was no mound building and as yet
there~is no data on house patterns.
Contact with the Puebloan culture during a Pueblo IV
period has been suggested in the appearance of ollas in
Titus and Belcher Foci, the sharing of carinated and sharp-.

East Texas

191

shouldered bowls in Titus, Texarkana, and McCurtain loci
as well as in the Southwest at this time, and the neck band~ng of utility jars in Titus, Frankston, Texarkana, and McCurtain Foci (Krieger, 1946, pp. 221-247 and Plates 30-35).
Titus Focus appears to have been involved in all these comparisons, more than the other loci, and it is the only one in
which actual trade sherds have been recognized from the
Puebloan culturel Sherds of Nocona Plain suggest trade
contact with either Wylie or Henrietta Focus in north-central Texas; and although Titus Focus sherds are found as
trade ware in the adjacent Caddoan loci on all sides, they
are not as numerous as one would expect.
Theâ€™ trait list below is compiled from the components
listed; at least 100 others are known but have not produced
any additional traits.
COMPONENTS:
Type Component: None designated.
Principal Excavated Components: Taylor Site, Harrison
County; Cash Site, Camp County; Riley .Site, Upshur
County; Cason, Justiss, Watson Sites, Morris County;
Atkins0n, Galt, Gandy Sites, Franklin County; Reese
Site, Wood County; Culpepper Site, Hopkins County;
Russell, Ford, Farrar, Caldwell, Williams Sites, Titus
County; and later component at Hale and Keith Sites,
Titus County. Titus County excavations briefly described in Goldschmitt (1935).
TYPES OF SITES:
Hardly any data, as collecting and excavation have been
done almost entirely in burial areas. Villages probably not extensive in any case, at most a few hundred
feet across, and located near both large and small
streams as well as in sandy uplands.
HOUSES:
No data.. One. large circular .floor partly excavated at
Keith Site,. Titus County (Goldschmitt, 1935) probably
belongs to an earlier component related to Alto Focus

Texas ArcheologicaI Society

192

(Newell and Krieger, 1949, p. 196).
EARTHWORKS:
No mounds constructed. A few mounds in area constructed by earlier people were lived on and
creased slightly in height, as shown by typical Titus
Focus sherds in their uppermost parts.
LIVELIHOOD:
Agriculture inferred, supplemented by hunting, fishing,
food gathering.
CERAMIC TRAITS:
Pottery Types: Most characteristic are RipIey Engraved,
Taylor Engraved, Bailey Engraved, Wilder Engraved,
and Harleton Appliqued. Glassell Engraved, Belcher
Ridged, and Belcher Engraved of Belcher Focus occur
in easternmost components, particularly at Taylor
Site, Harrison County. Karnack Brushed-Incised apparently a special development in these eastern components. Former type Leesburg Neck Banded now incorporated in LaRue Neck Banded and shared with
Frankston Focus. Former type Winfield Brushed now
incorporated in Bullard Brushed and shared with
Frankston Focus. Types Killough Pinched and Maydelle Incised of Frankston Focus occur occasionally.
Temper: Clay-grit, usually coarse, with pulverized bone
or kaolin occasionally added, in polished and utility
vessels alike. Shell temper absent in resident pottery
but occurs in some trade vessels from Texarkana o5
McCurtain Foci.
Features: Red film occurs on only two types: rather
commonly on Ripley Engraved, rarely on Taylor Engraved. An outstanding feature of all Titus potterF
is the strong insistence on repeating design units four
times, ~whether engraved, appliqued, or incised; there
are few exceptions. Utility vessels have every combination of incising, brushing, fingernail and stick

East Texas

193

punctating, and applique fillets and nodes, on bodies,
rims, or both in different combinations. Strap handles
and lugs, two or four in number, occur rarely on jar
rims. Quadration of jars in four raised peaks on rims;
of bottles in four...bo~ly lobes. Miniature vessels especially common, usually placed with child burials.
Effigy bowls with head and tail of birds and animals
on opposite sides of bowls, rattle bowls with four
hollow knobs containing pebbles, and small simple
bowls cover.ed with applique nodes also fairly commonÂ°
Elbow pipes, bowl and stem ends of about equal size;
sometimes engraved.
Perforsted disks made of potsherds (spindle whorls?).
Nose or lip plugs.
Squeezed lumps of clay, baked like pottery, and smoothed or polished.
ARTIFACTS OF CHIPPED STONE:
Projectile Points:
Arrow Points: Types Talco and Bassett found commonly in graves, Maud rarely.
Dart Points: Gary and Ellis frequently collected on
these sites.but never in graves; association not proved.
ARTIFACTS OF GROUND STONE:
Small milling stones, unshaped slabs of ferruginous
sandstone.
Manos, of ferruginous sandstone, unshaped or roughly
rectangular.
Pitted stones ("nut stones") ; also pits in faces of manos
and sills of milling stones.
.Hones, of ferruginous sandstone.
ARTIFACTS OF POLISHED STONE:
Petaloid celts common, usually shaped entirely by pecking, then bit end ground to high polish; made of pale
green Ouachita Sandstone.

Texas Archeological Society

194

Petaloid celts, ground and polished all over, less common.
Flat, rectangular adzes, ground and polished all over,
made of flint and other hard stones, uncommon.
Adzes, apparently made of selected flat stream pebbles,
unshaped except for highly polished bit; body may
or may not be polished.
ARTIFACTS OF SHELL:
Cylindrical beads of conch-shell columnellae, rare.
Effigy pendants (insects?) of conch or thick mussel
shell.
Thin mussel shells with hole in edge (used as beads?).
ARTIFACTS OF BONE:
Awls of split deer-leg bone.
Antler tines, possibly flaking tools.
Deer-ulna flaking tools.

BURIAL CUSTOMS:
So far as known, the hundreds of burials excavated contained a single individual, extended on back, with
pottery vessels around head and shoulders, occasionally at feet or sides or between legs. Graves small,
all offerings close to body; child burials often accompanied by miniature vessels 5 to 10 cm. high. In this
area, peculiar soil conditions appear to be responsible
for complete disappearance of bones (except teeth or
tooth enamel) in some sites, so that only evidence of
grave is position of pottery, soft earth fill, and impressions of bones in ground.
RELATIONS:
Pottery types shared with Belcher and Frankston Foci
as mentioned above.
Pottery types Hodges Engraved, Simms Engraved, Avery
Engraved, Keno Trailed, and Nash Neck Banded appear occasionally, probably as trade ware from foci
to north and northeast.

East Texas

195

One sherd of Coles Creek Incised appears in A. P. Williams Site, Titus County, which is pure Titus Focus
component without other foreign elements.
Trade sherds of Chupadero Black-on-White and upper
Gila brown ware found on other Titus Focus sites
(Krieger, 1946, pp. 207-208).
Sharing of certain vessel forms and neck banding with
Puebloan culture in Pueblo IV period (Krieger, 1946,
pp. 221-247 and Plates 30-35). Some of these may be
due to suggestion from trade ware, others to actual
movement of people in both directions.
Trade sherds of type Nocona Plain from Henrietta or
Wylie Focus of north central Texas.
ESTIMATED AGE:
1200-1500 A. D., possibly lasting until 1600 A. D.
SOURCES:
Krieger, 1946, pp. 205-247 passim, Figure 18, and Plates
30-35.
Bossier Focus (Fulton Aspect)
Components of this focus occur principally .in northwestern Louisiana, where it was recognized by Clarence H.
Webb on the basis of his site surveys and excavations (Webb,
1948). A few components have been recognized in northeast
Texas (Krieger, 1946; Stephenson, 1950). Typical vessels
have also appeared in private collections made in southwest
Arkansas, where they may be of trade origin.
The Bossier Focus has been particularly difficult to define, since all its known sites also contain material belonging
to other loci. By careful cross-checking of traits, however,
Webb has succeeded in drawing up a tentative outline on
which the trait list below is based. We agree that such a
complex exists, and that it was partly derived from both the
Haley and Alto Foci of Gibson Aspect; as such, it appears
to be an introductory phase of the Fulton Aspect, leading
to the Belcher, Titus, and perhaps other loci.

Texas Archeological Society

COMPONENTS:
Type Component: None designated.
Other Components: Harrison Bayou Site, Harrison
County (Webb, 1948); several in McGee Bend Reservoir basin in Jasper, Sabine, San Augustine, Angelina,
and Nacogdoches Counties (River Basin Surveys report by R. L. Stephenson, 1950) ; fifteen sites in Caddo,
Red River, DeSoto, and Natchitoches Parishes, Louisiana (Webb, 1948).
TYPES OF SITES:
Small, compact communities located on upland slopes
near minor streams, lakes, and springs, or on slopes
fronting toward large alluvial valleys; rarely on floors.
of largest valleys themselves.
HOUSES:
Apparently roughly oval structures with projecting entranceway. Interior features vary, may include multiple fire places not in prepared basin, cist-like cachepits, scattered interior posts or props.
EARTHWORKS:
Mounds rare; occasionally a small sand mound in hilltop site overlooking valley. At Belcher Site, Caddo
Parish, a Bossier complex appears to mark one stage
of mound construction (above a Haley Focus stage
and beneath two stages with Belcher Focus); Belcher
Site is on west side of Red River on a broad alluvial
plain.
LIVELIHOOD:
Agriculture, supplemented by hunting, fishing, gath~
ering of wild foods.

CERAMIC TRAITS:
Pottery Types: Pease Brushed-Incised and Sinner Linear Punc~ated are best diagnostic types. Maddox Engraved (Maddox Band Engraved), Maddox Brushed,

East Texas

197

and Belcher Ridged also diagnostic; types Dunkin Incised and Kiam Incised from late phase of Alt0" Focus.
Some Haley Focus types possibly occur as survivals,
especially in north of area. Taylor Engraved reported
as present (Webb, 1948) but this type now revised.
Temper: Principally clay-grit; occasionally pulverized
bone and tufa. Shell temper absent or extremely rare.
Features: Red filming unknown. Some quadration of
vessels and designs. Lugs and handles occasionally
present. Effigies absent or extremely rare. Incising,
punctating, brushing, and applique all present, but
work generally inferior to that of other Caddoan units.
Engraved designs consist mainly of "ladders" placed
vertically or diagonally on body or rim, less often of
cross-hatched bands in curvilinear patterns.
Elbow pipes, plain or engraved.

"

Pipes in form of rectangular block with incised decoration.
Perforated disks made from potsherds (spindle whorls?).
Beads made from potsherds.
Pottery trowels (?).
Fragments of human figurines.
ARTIFACTS OF CHIPPED STONE:
Projectile Points:
Arrow Points:
ciation.

Alba type; others of uncertain asso-

Dart Points: Gary, Ellis, San Patrice; possibly others.
Scrapers: Small, oval or triangular in shape.
Drills: Small flakes with expanded but unworked bases;
others with bases shaped more or less into rectangle
(association uncertain).
Spokeshaves: Albany type (see Webb, 1946, for description; association uncertain).
ARTIFACTS OF GROUND STONE:
Small, rough sandstone milling stones.
Oval manos.

Texas Archeological Society

198

Pitted stones ("nut stones").
Hones of brown sandstone.
ARTIFACTS OF POLISHED STONE:
Rectangular adzes or celts with squared bases and mildly recurved edges.
Small, triangular "celts", less frequent.
Full-grooved axes (association uncertain).
Two-hole gorgets (association uncertain).
Beads of tubular and pendant shape (association uncertain).
ARTIFACTS OF SHELL AND COPPER:
No data.
ARTIFACTS OF BONE:
Beads made from sections of bird-leg bone (association
uncertain).
MISCELLANEOUS TRAITS:
Hammerstones.
Unworked quartz crystals.
Pendant of quartz crystal (association uncertain).
BURIAL CUSTOMS:
Single interments, skeleton extended on back in shallow
grave in village area. Burial offerings sparse, usually
consisting of pottery vessels behind or near head, and
(rarely) pipes.
RELATIONS:
Presence of Dunkin Incised and Kiam Incised may mean
contemporaneity with phase 3 of Alto Focus, but probably these types lasted after most of Alto Focus traits
had disappeared. Pease Brushed-Incised probably occurs in Haley Focus and presence in Bossier probably
means survival. Presence of Belcher Ridged anticipates Belcher Focus complex. On the whole, Bossier
Focus appears to bridge time between disappearance
of Gibson Aspect and beginning of Fulton Aspect, but

East Texas

199

this needs to be determined more accurately with excavations. At Belcher Site, Level IV appears to be
Haley Focus, Level III, Bossier Focus, Levels II and I,
Belcher Focus (Levels but not foci discussed in Webb
and Dodd, 1941; foci discussed in Webb, 1948).
SOURCES:
Webb and Dodd, 1941;Krieger, 1946;Webb, 1948; Stephenson, 1950.
Belcher Focus (Fulton Aspect)
The Belcher Site on the west bank of Red River in
Caddo Parish, Louisiana, has provided the basis for this
focus (Webb, 1940; Webb and Dodd, 1941; Krieger, 1946).
The excavations of Clarence B. Moore (Moore, 1912) provide additional components at the McClure Place in Miller
County, and the Friday, Foster, Moore, and Battle Places in
Lafayette County, Arkansas, all on the alluvial valley of
Red River. Close relationships with Texarkana Focus are
evident in pottery and house types, with Mid-Ouachita Focus
in some pottery types, and with Titus Focus in northeast
Texas, particularly the Taylor Site in Harrison County.
COMPONENTS:
Type Component: Two upper levels at Belcher mound,
Caddo Parish, Louisiana.
Other Components: McClure Site, Miller County, and
Friday, Foster, Moore, and Battle Sites in LaFayette
County, Arkansas; Gum Springs mound, Hot Springs
County, Arkansas; last occupation at Crenshaw Site,
Miller County, Arkansas; last occupation at Mound
Plantation, Caddo Parish, Louisiana; part of material
from Taylor Site, Harrison County, Texas, and other
sites in Bowie, Cass, and Marion Counties, Texas, with
mixed materials.
TYPES OF SITES:
Large villages on alluvial plain of Red River; smaller
sites on tributary streams of other river systems.

Texa~ Archeological Society

2OO

HOUSES:
At Belcher Site, round, 30 to 42 feet in diameter, some
having extended entranceway. Interior features include: central firebasin, and small posts or props
where needed. Walls probably of woven cane and
grass with clay covering; roofs constructed of poles,
probably with grass thatch (Webb, 1940).
EARTHWORKS:
Most sites have no mounds; ~doubtful that Belcher people
built any mounds entirely. At Belcher Site, mound
erected by earlier people increased in height by covering over abandoned or burned houses with clean
sand, then building new ones over them. At Battle
Site, a very large platform had been erected by an
earlier (Haley Focus?) people and was greatly increased in height with a superstructure and ramp,
probably by Belcher Focus people, as shown by excavations in 1948 by Krieger and Howard (Moore,
1912, found evidence only of Belcher Focus at Battle).
LIVELIHOOD:
Agriculture based on maize, beans, squash presumed,
supplemented by hunting of deer, small game, and
birds; wild plant foods; some shellfish.
CERAMIC TRAITS:
Pottery Types: Belcher Engraved, Glassell Engraved,
Belcher Plain, most diagnostic. Hodges Engraved,
Taylor Engraved, Cowhide Stamped, Belcher Ridged,
Foster Trailed-Incised well represented. Bailey Engraved minor type.
Temper: Many of the best vessels have no visible temper; otherwise, small amount of sand, clay-grit, or
pulverized shell and tufa. Shell temper occurs frequently in Belcher Ridged, Cowhide Stamped, and
Foster Trai~ed-Incised, seldom if ever in other types.
Features: Red filming occurs occasionally in Hodges
Engraved, possibly in Taylor Engraved, but is absent

East Texas

in other types. Strap handles occur rarely. Applique
work uncommon. Effigy bowls with head and tail of
bird or animal attached to rim; four-legged effigy

small variant of Perdiz type.
Dart Points: None definitely associated.
Snub-nosed scrapers, small, thin, triangular.
Spall scrapers with edge retouching.
Drills, small, thick.
Knives, long, oval to ~double-pointed, uncommon.

BURIAL CUSTOMS:
Interments usually single, but some multiple, containing
up to seven individuals. Extended, usually on back.

around skeleton, ornaments left where worn in life,
and various weapons and utensils. Cemetery areas
near village, but dead also put in graves dug through
house floors and into previously built mound.
RELATIONS:
Pottery types Cowhide Stamped, Foster Trailed-Incised
shared with Texarkana and Mid-Ouachita Foci.

Ripley Engraved of Titus Focus occurs as trade ware in
Belcher mound.
Belcher Engraved and Belcher Ridged occur in Taylor
Site of Titus Focus,oprobably made there rather than
traded.
Taylor Engraved shared with Titus Focus; Bailey Engraved and Hodges Engraved with Titus, Texarkana,
and Mid-Ouachita.
Bassett and Maud arrow-point types shared with Texarkana Focus.
ESTIMATED AGE:
1200-1500 A. D. or part thereof.
SOURCES:
Webb, 1940, 1945, 1948; Webb and Dodd, 1941; Krieger,
1946, pp. 210-212, 235-237. Webbâ€™s complete report on
Belcher excavations and relationships is being prepared for publication.
Texarkana Focus (Fulton Aspect)
This focus is principally defined on the basis of excavations in three sites 10 to 12 miles northwest of Texarkana,
in Bowie County and on or near the flood plain of Red River.
The E. H. Moores Place is reported to have a plowed-down
mound about 50 feet in diameter and four feet high, containing midden refuse, and a cemetery area nearby. The
Paul Mitchell Place has a large cemetery and two midden
areas nearby. The A. Jâ€™. ttatchel Place has a mound over
25 feet high (also known as the Janes Mound) and a cemetery area about 200 feet to the northeast of it. The Moores
graves were excavated by the University of Texas in 1932,
and in 1938-1939 the University of Texas and WPA made
large-scale excavations in the Hatchel mound and cemetery,
as well as in the Mitchell cemetery. In addition, a number
of other sites in Bowie and Cass Counties have yielded collections closely agreeing with these, and several of the sites

Texas Archeological Society

2O4

explored b~y Clarence B. Moore along the Red River in Arkansas (Moore, 1912) may be said to include artifacts of
both Belcher and Texarkana Foci.
Components of Texarkana Focus lie at the heart ofthe
Caddoan archeological region, as do those of the earlier
Haley Focus. The initial construction of the Hatchel mound
was, in fact, by Haley Focus people, those of the later complex adding to its height by the construction of numerous
houses and accumulation of midden refuse. Certain continuities, particularly in pottery shapes and designs, are
apparent between Haley and Texarkana Foci. Both produced a high frequency of well-fired, dark, highly polished
vessels with beautifully executed engraved designs. The
Belcher, Mid-Ouachita, and McCurtain Foci are all also closely related to Texarkana and Haley in the excellence of their
pottery, but whereas Haley Focus lacks shell tempering, the
foci of Fulton Aspect used it in varying amounts. Shell
temper appears much more frequently in McCurtain Focus
pottery than in the others; in Mid-Ouachita, Texarkana,
and Belcher it appears with fair frequency in some types,
rarely in others, and not at all in still others. The historic
Glendora Focus probably derived its ceramics in part from
each of these prehistoric foci, with its shell temper being
as common as in the McCurtain Focus, if not more so.
A preliminary analysis of the Hatchel and Mitchell
collections was made in 1942 by Krieger, but this rich complex has yet to be described in detail. The trait list below
is based on the preliminary analysis, with pottery types
brought up to date.
COMPONENTS:
Type Component: Upper levels of the Hatchel mound
and adjacent cemetery, Bowie County (Krieger, 1946,
p. 207).
Other Components: Cemetery ~nd midden areas at the
Mitchell and Moores Sites, Bowie County; smaller collections in Red River, Bowie, and Cass Counties; part
of material from Battle, Foster, Friday, and McClure

East Texas

205

Sites on Red River in Arkansas (Moore, 1912); part
of material from Ozanil and Ozan 15 Sites, and probably others in Hempstead County, Arkansas (Harrington, 1920).

TYPES OF SITES:
Chief known components are large villages close to Red
River, on or near the floodplain and subject to periodic
overflow. Overflow has caused village site material to
be buried in sediments, except for mounds, middens,
and cemetery areas in slightly raised knolls. Sites
near smaller rivers generally small.
HOUSES:
Sixteen excavated at Hatchel Site were at different
levels in upper part of mound, circular, 15 to 25 feet
in diameter, extended entranceway pointing east or
southeast. Small interior supports present, but central firebasin and large interior posts rare or absent.
EARTHWORKS:
People of this focus started few, if any, mounds. At the
Hatchel Site and perhaps elsewhere, they added considerably to a mound erected by an earlier people. At
Moores Site, it has not been proved that the "mound"
was an intentional construction, as it consists mainly
of midden. More data needed.
LIVELIHOOD:
Charred corn and beans provide direct evidence of agriculture at Hatchel Site; intensive agriculture inferred
for other sites. Crops supplemented by hunting, fishing, gathering of wild food products and shell fish
(charred pecans found at Moores Site).
CERAMIC TRAITS:
Pottery Types: An unusually large number of types
found here because of central position and sharing of
types with neighboring complexes. Most common are
Barkman Engraved, Avery Engraved, Simms Engrav-

Texas Archeological Society

206

ed, McKinney Plain, Nash Neck Banded, and Foster
Trailed-Incised. Minor types are Hatchel Engraved,
Hempstead Engraved, Hodges Engraved, Taylor Engraved, Bailey Engraved, Bowie Engraved, Keno Trailed, Cass Appliqued, and Cowhide Stamped. Belcher
Engraved, Belcher Ridged, and Belcher Plain found in
minor amounts and may be trade ware from Belcher
Focus; Friendship Engraved of Mid-Ouachita Focus
occupies same position. Ripley Engraved of Titus Focus clearly trade ware.
Temper: Utility pottery generally has clay-grit temper,
with pulverized shell added o~casi~onally as in type
McKinney Plain. Polished pottery generally has no
temper, a small amount of fine sand, or pulverized
shell. Nash Neck Banded, Simms Engraved, Avery
Engraved, Foster Trailed-Incised, and Cowhide Stamped are those most frequently shell-tempered; Keno
Trailed and Bowie Engraved occasionally have this
feature; the remaining type.s do not.
Features:

Red film occurs frequently on Avery En-

graved although not always in conjunction with shell
temper; it is rare on Bowie Engraved and absent or
nearly so on all other types. Designs are frequently
repeated four times on all engraved and trailed-incised types. McKinney Plain jars are quadrated with
single appliqued fillets or nodes on rim or body, or
both; McKinney jars sometimes have four slight peaks
on rim. Nash Neck Banded vessels frequently have
rim pulled up into four high peaks so that mouth
looks square from above. Two or four small strap
handles may .be present on jars. Dentate stamp used
to decorate jars of Cowhide type. Rattle bowls; noded
bowls; effigies.
Elbow pipes, with spur projecting beyond bowl or folded
against bowl.
Perforated disks made from potsherds (spindle whorls?).

ceramic offerings around head and shoulders; less frequently, at sides or feet. Single interments the rule
although from two to four in a grave are known.
RELATIONS:
Various pottery types shared with Belcher, Mid-Ouachita, and McCurtain Foci.
Trade pottery from same loci and from Titus Focus.
One sherd of Coles Creek Incised from upper component
of Hatchel mound.
One sherd of Chase Incised from Hatchel Site village
area.
NovacuHte imported from Arkansas, used for some projectile points.
Turquoise bead indicates trade with Rio Grande Puebloans.
Certain vessel forms (sharp-shouldered bowls and carinated bowls) appear to have been borrowed from
Texarkana Focus by Puebloan Indians of north-central New Mexico through trade contact or intermarriages in the 15th or 16th century (Krieger, 1946, pp.
221-235).
With Titus and McCurtain Foci, Texarkana shares trait
of neck-banding, which may have been borrowed from
Puebloan culture in early Pueblo IV times, 14th or
15th Century (Krieger, 1946, pp. 237-241).

East Texas

ESTIMATED AGE:
From 1200 or 1300 A. D. to 1500 or 1600 A. D.
SOURCES:
Krieger, 1946, pp. 205-214, 230-247, Plates 30, 35.
Mid-Ouachita Focus (Fulton Aspect)
As the known components of this focus occur entirely
within southwest Arkansas, we are not directly concerned
with it except that it shares a number of traits with Texarkana, Titus, and Belcher Focus. /k number of extensive
excavations were made by the University of Arkansas and
WPA in i938-1941, none of which has been published, although Krieger has examined and photographed much of the
pottery stored in Fayetteville. Data on house floors, graves,
and other artifacts is not available to us at present. No
mound building has been reported, whereas amateur collectors have obtained huge amounts of fine pottery from
village and cemetery sites.
This focus appears to have been centered in the upper
drainage system of Ouachita River, from the area west of
Hot Springs downstream to well below Arkadelphia. Components also occur between the Ouachita and Red Rivers,
as. seen in much of the pottery from Hempstead County
illustrated by Harrington (1920). Dr. and Mrs. T. L. Hodges
of Bismarck, Arkansas, published some of their data and
illustrated typical vessels from the Vc-atermelon Island Site,
located on an island in Ouachita River a few miles above
Arkadelphia (Hodges and Hodges, 1943). Subsequently the
same. authors published a theory that this or similar sites
were the archeological representatives of the Cahinnio Caddoan-speaking tribe encountered by De Soto in crossing from
the Arkansas to Red River in 1541-1542 (Hodges and Hodges,
1944:45). Although it is strange to report, no European contact material has ever been found in any southwest Arkansas
si.tes, despite diligent search by the Hodges and other amateur archeologists. On the other hand, the De Soto expedition was not equipped to trade with the Indians and there

210

Texas Archeological Society

is little if any chance that objects referrable to it will be
found. It is therefore quite possible that the Cahinnio Caddo
did live in the Arkadelphia vicinity and that they were seen
by De Soto, but had disappeared by the time that Henri De
Tonti and other French explored this area nearly 150 years
later.
Amateur archeologists report that all, or nearly all,
graves which contain typical pottery of this focus, are single
interments, ex~ended on the back, with vessels around the
head and shoulders, sometimes along the legs and close to
the feet. This method is the common one of most Fulton
Aspect loci.
The pottery types Friendship Engraved, Means Engraved, Blakely Engraved, and Military-Road Incised are the
common diagnostic ones for this focus and do not, apparently, occur elsewhere in the Caddoan Area. Hodges Engraved is shared with Belcher Focus and to a less extent
with Texarkana and Titus Focus of Texas. Hempstead Engraved is shared with Texarkana Focus; Bailey Engraved
with Texarkana, Titus, and Belcher; Taylor Engraved with
Belcher and Titus; Keno Trailed with Texarkana, Belcher,
and Titus; Foster Trailed-Incised with Belcher and Texarkana; and Cowhide Stamped with Belcher and Texarkana.
There is a particularly close relationship between ~Â¢Iid-Ouachita, Texarkana, and Belcher Focus not only in these specific types but in the general tradition of producing a great
deal of dark pottery--gray, brown, gray-brown, and black-whereas Titus Focus pottery is not only of lower quality but
of much lighter colors.
Mid-Ouachita Focus may be said to reveal the finest of
all Caddoan potteries although other loci in the area of the
great bend of Red River would not be far behind, or the
Spiro Focus in eastern Oklahoma. The present plates illustrating the types named above will reveal this high quality.
Mid-Ouachita also contains more effigy ware than any other
Caddoan loci, bottles in particular being modeled after both
human beings and animals (Plate 23, A-C, F). Furthermore,

East Texas

211

these vessels are often complete effigies (although highly
conventionalized), whereas those of other Caddoan foci
consist mainly of bowls with heads and tails attached to the
rims; the latter may also at times have conventionalized
limbs, wings, or fins attached at the sides (Plates 22, 23).
This effigy work featuring complete forms may have been
the result of influence from the St. Francis Focus of eastern
Arkansas, where these are even more spectacular and more
numerous. In the latter case, however, they are usually
done with light buff-colored pottery and painted white and
red. Trade vessels of typical St. Francis ware have been
found in several Mid-Ouachita components, supporting their
contemporaneity.
Oddly, all surrounding loci of the Fulton Aspect reveal
some red filming, while Mid-Ouachita pottery does not, so
far as we are aware. Shell temper occurs frequently in such
types as Foster Trailed-Incised and Cowhide Stamped, only
occasionally in Military Road Incised, and rarely if at all in
the other types. Rattle bowls, common in other Fulton
Aspect loci, appear to be absent, as do the four legs standing
on a ring base, reported from Belcher, Texarkana, and
Frankston Focus.
One very special trait of Mid-Ouachita is the peculiar
"seed jar", a fat, high vessel with convex sides, the top covered over except for a small round aperture, and often with
vertically-perforated lugs in opposed pairs, near the base
and top. We illustrate one of these in Plate 7, H, but its
shape is more cylindrical than most, and its design unique.
Hodges and Hodges (1943, Plate 11; 1944-45, Plate 19 center
row) illustrate more typical ones. Glen L. Evans once suggested that these would serve perfectly as tobacco humidors,
which if true would constitute a unique Indian invention.
Our estimated age for this focus is approximately 1200
to 1600 A. D. or the greater part thereof.
McCurtain Focus (Fulton Aspect)
A McCurtain Focus was first defined by Baerreis (un-

Texas Archeological Society

212

published manuscript, 1943) on the basis of two components
excavated by the University of Oklahoma and WPA in McCurtain County in the southeast corner of Oklahoma. These
are the Clement and McDonald Sites, the general features
of which are described by Bell and Baerreis (1951). Other
components were recognized in a survey of McCurtain County, and several are known in Red River County, Texas, although detailed information is available only from the Sam
Kaufman Site (Harris, 1953).
The Clement Site (not to be confused with Clements
Site in Cass County, Texas) contained three mounds, all
apparently flat-topped temple mounds. In one of them a
large grave was found, containing ten skeletons. Although
such graves are generally associated with the Gahagan.and
Spiro Foci, the grave offerings of pottery vessels and ornaments in this case leave no doubt that it belongs to McCurtain Focus.
COMPONENTS:
Type Components: Clement and McDonald Sites, McCurtain County, Oklahoma.
Other Components: Kaufman, Buchanan, Hooks Ferry,
Atkinson, and Norris Sites, Red River County, Texas;
probably others in northwestern Bowie and northeastern Lamar Counties. In Oklahoma, probably others in McCurtain and Choctaw Counties. All sites
appear to be within 25 miles of this section of Red
River valley.
TYPES OF SITES:
Villages on terraces of Red River or tributary valleys
close to it; cemeteries in refuse areas, but burials
placed in temple mounds as well.
HOUSES:
Most of those excavated at Clement Site were square
to rectangular, 17 to 25 feet long. Extended entranceway marked by two parallel trenches (in which posts
were placed ?), roofs supported by either two or four

East Texas

213

large central posts. At McDonald Site, a circular
house found, diameter 18 feet, no centerposts, entranceway indicated by two parallel trenches (Bell
and Baerreis, 1951, Fig. 2).
LIVELIHOOD:
Agriculture, supplemented by hunting, fishing, and gathering of wild plant foods.
EARTHWORKS:
Three flat-topped temple mounds at Clement Site, one
of which was also used as a burial tumulus. No other
components are known to have mounds of any kind.
CERAMIC TRAITS:
Pottery Types: Avery Engraved and Nash Neck Banded
recognized by Bell and Baerreis (1951) a~ Clement
and McDonald Sites; same types and Simms Engraved
recognized by Harris (1953) at Kaufman Site. New
types Hatchel Engraved and Bowie Engraved also occur in some of these sites. Other types remain to be
defined, especially in utility ware.
Temper: Abundant pulverized shell common, especially
in polished vessels; clay-grit or shell in utility vessels.
Features: Red film common, often combined with shell
temper, in type Avery Engraved; also occurs in Bowie
Engraved. Utility vessels often have neck-banding,
four rim peaks, two or four small strap handles, and
applique features, including small nodes in place of
handles.
Bi-conical elbow pipes (diameter increases both at the
bowl and toward the stem end).
Long-stemmed pipes (association uncertain).
Perforated disks made from potsherds (spindle whorls?).
ARTIFACTS OF CHIPPED STONE:
Projectile Points:
Arrow Points: No type names designated yet, but described as having stems with side or corner notch-

Texas Archeological Society

ing, and triangular with edges of blades recurved
and serrated.
Dart Points: More frequent than arrow points; include types Gary and Ellis, probably others not yet
defined.
Knives: Ovate and asymmetrical forms found infrequently.
Scrapers: Ovate, found infrequently.
Hoe Blades: Pear-shaped outline, roughly chipped,
found infrequently.
ARTIFACTS OF GROUND STONE:
Milling stones.
Manos, usually of fine-grained sandstone.
ARTIFACTS OF POLISHED STONE:
Celts, shaped by chipping, only one end ground to cutting edge.
.. Celts, petaloid, shaped all over by grinding and polishing.
Pair of earspools, each with concave face covered with
copper sheeting; inner flange divided into two sections by broad transverse groove (from burial in
temple mound at Clement Site).
ARTIFACTS OF BONE AND ANTLER:
No data.
ARTIFACTS OF SHELL:
Small beads of shell and Lithos~ernum seeds.
Pearl beads (from fresh-water mussels).
Disk-shaped beads.
One incised gorget with voluted-circle or swastika motif
in center (from burial in temple mound at Clement
Site) (Bell and Baerreis, 1951, P1. 10, No.
ARTIFACTS OF COPPER:
Thin sheeting on earspools.
MISCELLANEOUS TRAITS:
Pitted hammerstones.

East Texas

215

Quartz crystals, tips consistently showing marks of
abrasion.
Spherical balls, shaped by pecking.
Lumps of green pigment, found in pottery vessels in
burials.
BURIAL CUSTOMS:
As a general rule, interments were single, extended on
back, with pottery placed around head and shoulders.
The large grave in the Clements Site temple mound
was exceptional in several ways and indicates a survival of practices from Gibson Aspect: it was apparently started at the mound surface and dug all the
way through to its base; there were cedar posts near
the four pit corners and approximately ten skeletons
(three extended, two fully flexed, the others frag.mentary and indeterminate); and the offerings were
not only on and between skeletons, but placed against
the pit walls. Offerings included 24 pottery vessels,
21 arrow points, three pottery pipes, the earspools and
shell gorget mentioned above, one celt, green pigment
in two vessels, pear! beads, Lithospernum seed beads,
and disk-shaped shell beads.
RELATIONS:
Sharing of pottery types Avery Engraved, Simms Engraved, Nash Neck Banded, Hatchel Engraved, and
Bowie Engraved with Texarkana Focus (other types
listed for Texarkana are absent or rare).
Keno Trailed occurs as trade ware, perhaps from MidOuachita Focus.
Square and rectangular houses with two or four large
centerposts and extended entranceways are closely
allied to those of Spiro Focus.
One round house without central posts but with extended entranceway (at McDonald Site) is closely
allied to those of Texarkana Focus at Hatchel Site
and to Belcher Focus at Belcher Site, Louisiana.

216

Texas Archeological Society

Shell gorget with voluted-circle motif is similar to one
at Hatchel Site, and both are similar to gorgers from
Tennessee and adjacent states, commonly assigned to
Southern Cult complex; however, they are unlike the
motifs on shells and gorgets from Spiro Focus and
probably belong to a later phase of the Southern Cult.
Sharing of certain bowl shapes and neck banding of
utility pottery with Puebloan IV culture is like that
described for Texarkana Focus.
A somewhat later chronological position than that of
Texarkana Focus is suggested by greater proliferance
of shell temper, absence of some Texarkana pottery
types, and presence of trade beads in Kaufman Site
(Harris, 1953). Historic Glendora Focus traits not
present.
ESTIMATED AGE:
1400-1700 A. D.

HISTORIC STAGE
It is difficult to set a definite date-line for the beginning
of historic times in East Texas, as well as other parts of
Texas. The first contact between Indian and European
would automatically mark this event, were it not that there
is usually a great deal of uncertainty about which tribes
were met, where they were located at the time, and how
much they may have moved before being again recorded in
later centuries. Furthermore, the first explorers were seldom equipped to carry on trade (that is, with glass beads,
ir0r~ knives, copper bracelets, etc., which they intended to
give the Indians in reward for services and information).
With the establishment of trading posts and missions, the
chances improve tremendously that an archeological site
can be definitely identified in time and tribal affiliation.
In East Texas the first Europeans who almost undoubt-

East Texas

217

edly entered the area of Caddoan-speaking Indians were the
survivors of the De Soto expedition, who, with Luis de
Moscoso in command, attempted to reach present Mexico
overland from the Mississippi River in 1542. They are believed to have crossed Red River not far from its great bend,
and continued southwestward until they reached a river,
beyond which they dared not continue because of what their
guides told them about the "wild" Indians beyond. Swanton
(1942, pp. 31-32) has identified this as Trinity River, which
appears reasonable because at that point Moscoso must
certainly have passed out of the peaceful agricultural Caddoar~ Indians and faced the "wild" or nomadic, non-agricultural Indians of central Texas.
About 145 years later, in 1686-1687, La Salle and some
of his followers visited the same general area in which
Moscoso had found Caddoan villages, even some of the
tribal names being easily recognized in the later account.
His route from Lavaca Bay toward the Illinois country would
naturally have taken him through Caddoan territory. Approaching this from the southwest, he would first have met
those tribes which the French called Cenis and the Spanish
Tejas. The Spanish knew them by the name Hasinai as well
although this term applied to a confederacy of. tribes in a
small area.
In 1690, the first Spanish mission was established among
the Nabadache and Neches tribes, members of the Hasinai
confederacy; and from then onward there were numerous
contacts between the East Texas Indians and both Spanish
and French traders, missionaries, and diplomats. In 1714
Fort Natchitoches was established at present Natchitoches
in central Louisiana, but the French had explored far up
Red River well before that, meeting the tribes which belonged to another confederacy, that of the Cadohadacho,
from which the English word Caddo is derived. As a general rule, we can say that extensive trade and missionary
contacts between the Tejas and Cadohadacho tribes, and
both Spanish and French, were well under way by 1700 A. D.

218

Texas Archeological Society

On the other hand, a different side of the picture has
usually been neglected. Soon after 1600 A. D., the Spanish
began to colonize present New Mexico seriously and had
carried an abundance of trade goods northward from present
central Mexico. In northeastern Mexico (in the states of
Coahuila and Nuevo Leon) no less than eight important settlements had been established between 1555 and 1596. Furthermore, we know from the account of Moscoso that the
Tejas Caddo had already built up a trade relationship with
the Pueblo Indians o5 New Mexico be]ore 1542, because the
Tejas had cotton blankets and turquoises which they obtained from people far to the west, to whom they carried
bois dâ€™arc and salt in exchange. Not only this, but comparative archeological studies have shown that this trade
contact was in existence for at least 100 years before Moscoso (Krieger, 1946, pp. 207-210).
If the trade mechanism for carrying objects back and
forth between East Texas and central New Mexico had been
going on for a century or two at least, before the Spanish
colonized northern Mexico and present New Mexico, then
it is easily possible that objects of Spanish manufacture were
carried eastward to the Tejas and other Caddo shortly after
1600. We must even allow for the possibility that such materials were carried from Coahuila or Nuevo Leon beSore
1600. It is perhaps not mere accident that the European objects found in early historic sites are almost entirely colored
glass beads and rusted fragments of iron knife blades, objects which would have had great appeal and been easy to
carry great distances.
Allowing thus for an Indian trade far in advance of
actual white settlement, we find it necessary to be rather
vague about an opening date for the Historic Stage in East
Texas. This certainly began by 1700 A. D. and could have
begun as early as 1600 A. D. if not even earlier.
Two historic foci have been defined, Allen for the
Tejas, and Glendora for the Cadohadacho and their allies
along Red River and farther east. Glendora may have

East Texas

219

begun somewhat later than Allen. Certain other sites cannot be placed in either of these as yet and will be discussed
separately.
Allen Focus (Fulton Aspect)
The components of this focus, so far as known at present,
occur in northwestern Cherokee County, eastern Anderson
County, northeastern Houston County, southeastern Henderson County, and western Nacogdoches County. The main
concentration is between the towns of Frankston. and Jacksonville. There is no doubt that Frankston Focus is the
pre-historic ancestor of Allen Focus, for several pottery
types continue into it. New pottery types were added, as
well as new types of chipped-stone artifacts. The Perdiz
type of arrow point was replaced by two others: Cuney and
Turney. Individual site reports will clarify these distinctions in more detail.
COMPONENTS:
Type Component: Jim Allen Site, Cherokee County,
excavated in 1935 by University of Texas.
Other Components: Patton, Jowell, Owens, Cecil, and
Freeman Sites in Anderson County; King Site in
Nacogdoches County; small surface collections in Henderson and Houston Counties, E. W. Hackney Site,
Cherokee County.
TYPES OF SITES:
Small villages situated along minor streams, most if not
all having a cemetery area in or adjacent to village
refuse.
HOUSES:

EARTHWORKS:
None.
LIVELIHOOD:
Agriculture, supplemented by hunting, fishing, gathering of wild foods.

CERAMIC TRAITS:
Pottery Types: Patton Engraved the principal type;
Hume Engraved minor; Killough Pinched, Maydelle
Incised continued from Frankston Focus in small
amounts; most of utility pottery not yet defined by
type. Bowls with effigy attachments and rattle bowls
continued from Frankston.
Temper: Predominantly fine sand or mixed fine claygrit and sand.
Features: Patton Engraved characterized by extensive
use of ticking (short spurs or tiny triangles attached
to lines at right angles) whether design consists of
parallel lines around rim, groups of lines arching toward one another on rim, spirals, or concentric circles
on body (Plate 52). This ticking easily distinguishes
Allen Focus pottery from Frankston.
Elbow pipes: Decorated with engraving or punctating,
red and white pigments rubbed into design; others
plain and less well made than Frankston.
ARTIFACTS OF CHIPPED STONE:
Projectile Points:
Arrow Points: Cuney, Turney types diagnostic; Talco,
Fresno, and Alba also occur; Perdiz rare.
Dart Points:

No definite associations.

Knives: Jowell type, a unique form with long, slender
blade pointed or slightly rounded at both ends, very
finely chipped over both faces; oval in cross-section;
all known specimens rubbed smooth on both edges
and faces alike. Anderson type, another unique
form, very broad but widest part near one end
where two nearly straight edges meet in a blunt
point, opposite end tapered and rounded at tip.
Diamond-shaped knives alternately beveled on all
four edges, or on the two edges of one end and
opposite end rounded.
Scrapers: Small snub-nosed form, and finely chipped spalls.

Glendora Focus (Fulton Aspect)
This focus represents historic Caddoan-speaking tribes

222

Texas Archeological Society

in extreme northeast Texas, much of northern Louisiana,
and a small part of eastern Arkansas. A number of tribes
must be represented along Red River from well above its
great bend downstream as far as present Natchitocheg in
central Louisiana, although few such tribes have yet been
identified definitely with particular sites. Walker (1935)
identified the Fish Hatchery Site at Natchitoches with the
tribe of the same name living there when the French established Fort Natchitoches in 1714. Moore (1909) excavated
many graves in the Keno and Glendora Sites in the Ouachita
River valley of northeastern Louisiana, identifying them
with the Ouachita Indians after whom the French named
this river. Although, like the above-mentioned sites, the
Douglas and Greer places in the lower Arkansas River
valley revealed European articles of glass, brass, and iron
in the graves with typical Glendora Focus pottery, Moore
(1908) was unable to determine which Caddoan groups
lived in that part of Arkansas.
The Womack Site near Red River in northern Lamar
County, Texas, likewise has produced European trade goods
and should represent one of the Caddoan groups, although
it is probably too far upstream for the Cadohadacho--a
tribe mentioned frequently in French and Spanish accounts
as the leading up-river group, in contrast to the Natchitoches farther down and the Tejas (Hasinai, Cenis~ villages
to the southwest in Texas.
The ceramics of these and similar sites are remarkably
uniform in their complex engraved designs, usually applied
to the bottoms of carinated bowls which have an outflaring
rim (Plate 51), and in the great abundance of shell temper.
McCurtain is the only other focus with shell temper in comparable amounts. Glendora Focus utility ware remains to
be analyzed and described, so has not been included here.
Webb (1945, pp. 67-70) ha~ listed a number of sites with
"typical" vessels and sherds of the type Natchitoches Engraved, and thus included these sites (or parts of them) in
Glendora Focus. These are: Clements Site in Cass County,
Texas, as described by Dickinson (1941); some material at

Battle mound in Lafayette County, Arkansas, as reported by
Moore (1912), with further excavations by M. P. Miroir;
Watermelon Island Site near Arkadelphia, Arkansas
(Hodges and Hodges, 1943); Belcher Site in Caddo Parish,
Louisiana (Webb and Dodd, 1941); and Hatchel Site in
Bowie County, Texas (information provided Webb by E:rieger in 1944). It must be stressed that at the time of Webbâ€™s
writing, the type Hodges Engraved (Plates 32, 33) had not
been recognized and that in all the cases just mentioned the
vessels once classed as "Natchitoches Engraved" must now
be classified as Hodges Engraved. In other words, these
sites (except Clements) are not historic and contain no
Glendora Focus material; they are listed herein under
Belcher, Texarkana, and Mid-Ouachita Focus, all without
sign of European contact.
On the other hand, the non-shell-tempered Hodges Engraved type almost certainly was a late pre-historic ancestor
of Natchitoches Engraved, a change in vessel forms, use of
shell temper, and a greater complexity of scroll designs
being the principal changes that took place with the beginning of historic times. Other types probably also shared
in the ancestry of Natchitoches Engraved, such as Ripley
Engraved of Titus Focus, which in rare cases also has designs of engraved and punctated scrolls on the bottoms of
carinated bowls (Plate 58, K-O); and Taylor Engraved
(Plates 65, 66).
COMPONENTS:
Type Components: Fish Hatchery Site (Walker, 1935)
and Lawton Site (Webb, 1945), both on Cane River, a
slough of Red River near Natchitoches, central Louisiana.
Other Components: Excavations at Glendora and Keno
Sites in Ouachita River valley, northeast Louisiana
(Moore, 1909); Douglas and Greer Sites in lower
Arkansas River valley (Moore, 1908); Allen Plantation and Wilkinson Place in hills northwest of Natchitoches, Louisiana, where J. A. Ford found European

trade goods in some graves (Webb, 1945); Womack
Site, Lamar County, Texas (University of Texas collections). Also graves excavated by M. P. Miroir and
J. T. Hughes in northeast Texas. All of the abo~elisted sites yielded European trade goods in graves
with Natchitoches Engraved pottery. Four or five
sites in northeast Texas have this pottery but no
trade goods; however, they have not been properly explored. No components yet reported from Oklahoma
or southwest Arkansas.
TYPES OF SITES:
Rather small villages located on or near major rivers
in broad, fertile valleys; cemetery areas in or adjacent to villages.
HOUSES:
No data.
EARTHWORKS:
None.
LIVELIHOOD:
Agriculture, supplemented by hunting, fishing, and food
gathering (known from early historical documents).
CER~AVIIC TRAITS:
Pottery Types: Natchitoches Engraved most characteristic and diagnostic type. Hudson Engraved. another
diagnostic type, shell-tempered. Keno Trailed continued from pre-historic foci; Cowhide Stamped, and
Glassell Engraved possibly continued in small
amounts. Utility pottery not yet analyzed by type.
Temper: Shell common, probably few exceptions.
Features: Red filming oc~casionally used in Natchitoches
Engraved but not other types; quadration of design
in all types the rule, but Natchitoches Engraved sometimes has three or five units; handles or lugs, applique
not reported. Some four-legged animal effigy vessels.
Rattle bowls not reported.
Simple elbow pipes, crudely made, without decoration.
ARTIFACTS OF CHIPPED STONE:
Projectile points, both arrow and dart, reported but not

East Texas

analyzed by type. Most are in private collections,
grave association uncertain.
ARTIFACTS OF GROUND STONE:
No data.
ARTIFACTS OF POLISHED STONE:
Petaloid celts.
ARTIFACTS OF SHELL, BONE, AND ANTLER:
No specific data.
BURIAL CUSTOMS:
Single interments, extended on back, with pottery
around head and near body. Walker (1935) reported
two horse skeletons buried at Fish Hatchery Site,
each with a large, thick, pottery bowl near head.
MISCELLANEOUS TRAITS:
Very pronounced fronto-occipital head deformation reported by Walker (1935).
RELATIONS:
Trade with Europeans shown principally by glass beads
and iron knife fragments; probably other metal artifacts as well in some sites.
Trade with historic Natchez Indians shown by intrusive
vessels of Fatherland Incised.
ESTIMATED AGE:
1650-1750 A. D., perhaps beginning earlier or lasting
later.
SOURCES:
Moore, 1908, 1909; Walker, 1935; Dickinson, 1941; Webb,
1945; Krieger, 1946.
Hunt and Clements Sites (Fulton Aspect)

In 1932, A. T. Jackson of the University of Texas recovered numerous pottery vessels and other artifacts from
the Clyde and Jay Clements farm 2V2 miles west of Atlanta,
Cass County. These were from 22 graves which had been
b~dly torn up by treasure hunters, but Jackson found some
materials remaining intact in most of them. Five of the 22

226

Texas Archeological Society

graves had glass trade beads in them. Mr. S. C. Dickinson
was given a collection of pottery from this site by Mr. Will
Scott, on which he has published a brief paper (Dickinson,
1941). Dr. D. A. Baerreis located still other fine vessels in
the American Museum of Natural History during the war,
sending sketches and notes to Krieger.
Also in 1932, Jackson excavated 17 graves on the Goode
Hunt farm 8 miles west of Atlanta, recovering 81 vessels
and many other artifacts. In this case, no glass beads were
found in any grave, and a piece of iron from one of them was
believed by Jackson to have fallen into the pit during excavation (field notes). For this reason, Jackson believed
that the Hunt Site was slightly older than Clements--that
is, it just preceded European contact.
The pottery vessels and other artifacts from these two
sites are closely similar, some vessels being virtually identical. They would appear to date in the earliest contact
times, somewhere between the prehistoric Texarkana and
Titus Foci on the one hand, and historic Glendora Focus on
the other. They perhaps indicate a separate focus.
Shell temper is very infrequent in these sites, most of
it appearing in the type Simms Engraved, which is also
shell-tempered in pre-European. Texarkana and McCurtain
Foci. Instead, there is no temper in some of the f~nest vessels, fine-clay grit in others, and fine to coarse pulveri.zed
bone in still others. The type Hodges Engraved is definitely
present in both large and miniature bottles, while Natchitoches Engraved has not been noted. The types Barkman
Engraped, Avery Engraved, Foster Trailed-Incised, and Cowhide Stamped, all common in the pre-historic Belcher and
Texarkana Foci, have not been noted in either the Hunt or
Clements Sites; however, both McKinney Plain and Nash
Neck Banded of Texarkana Focus are present but rare. Two
types not noted elsewhere are also present: Cass Appliqued
and Clements Brushed (Plates 11, 12). Some vessels appear
to be like the large compound bowls of Titus Focus, but with
Somewhat different designs consisting of long oval panels

East Texas

227

bisected by a horizontal line. Three vessels are like Hudson
Engraved of Glendora Focus in having finely cross-hatched
bands set horizontally and in arcs (Plate 36), but have fine
clay-grit temper instead of shell. Some utility jars have rows
of fingernail punctations of diagonal incised lines around
the rims, somewhat like those of Titus Focus, and are either
clay-grit or bone tempered.
Other traits noted by Jackson include lumps of green
and gray pigment (some inside of grave vessels), red ochre
pigment in one grave, red and white pigments in engraved
designs, conch-shell pendants shaped like insect effigies,
mussel shells pierced for halting (so-called "hoe blades"),
one dog burial with a vessel enclosed, manos, and pitted
stones. Projectile points are very small, with pointed stems
somewhat like the Perdiz type, and pottery pipes are of the
elbow form, simple and poorly made as in Glendora Focus.
In summary, these two sites appear to belong to a short
transition period with survivals of some Texarkana and
Titus Focus traits, but preceding the appearance of Natchitoches Engraved and other Glendora Focus traits. The
graves, as in most Fulton Aspect units, were single interments with bodies extended on the back with vessels about
the head, shoulders, and legs. It. is supposed that they date
between 1600 and 1700 A. D.,.allowing for the possible appearance of European goods in advance of colonizing activities and missions.
KauSman Site (Fulton Aspect)
This site in northern Red River County has been explored to some extent by R. E:. Harris and assigned to McCurtain Focus on the basis of such pottery types as Avery
Engraved, Simms Engraved, and Nash Neck Banded (Harris,
1953). It is the only McCurtain Focus component so far
known which includes European trade goods in the graves,
and is of interest in indicating that this complex extended
into a time of early contact. As in the case of the Hunt and
Clements Sites, its date would seem to be somewhere between 1600 and 1700 A. D.

CADDOAN POTTERY TYPES
AVERY Elff~RAVED
(Plates 1, 2)

PASTE
Temper:

Usually finely pulverized shell (most of vessels

shown). Otherwise fine clay-grit
temper (Plate 2, B, L).

(t>late 1, E, F)

or no

Texture: Fine compact except when shell par.ticles have leached away leaving paste soft and full of fine cavities.
Color: Commonly covered with bright, hard red film made of
~powdered red ochre (most of vessels shown). Otherwise
shades of brown and gray from medium to dark and nearly
black 6Plates 1, B, E; 2, C, E, J, L). Just under red film
-most usual surface color is buff, which shows in design lines
cut through film. Cores gray, brown.
.Surface finish: From poorly to fairly well polished.

FORM
Wall thickness:

3 to 5 ram.

Lip: Rounded and flush with rim or turned outward slightly.
Base: Slightly convex to flat but no thicker than side walls.
Vessel shape and size: Most common is compound bowl with
low, conical bottom, large.rounded shoulder area turned inward, and high rim curving outward (Plate 1, A, C-E, G,
I-I). Mouth diameter generally greater than that at shoulder. Many of these are magnificent vessels, diameters
ranging from 10 to 40 cm. and perhaps more. Compound
bowl with vertical rim (Plate 1, B) unusual. Very deep,
nearly cylindrical bowls with sides slightly convex or with
rims gently curving outward (Plate 2, A, B, D, F, I) are
also common and range from 6 to 20 cm. or more in height.
Bottles (Plate 2, C, E, G, K) also fairly common. Other
forms include small jars (Plate 2, H), squat bowls with
outflaring rims (Plate 2, J), and carinated bowls with convex rim standing vertically (Plates 1, F; 2, L). Small strap
handles may occur rarely (Plate 2, H).
D]~CO~tkTION
Treatment:

Engraving.

Designs: Center around semicircular motifs usually repeated
~our times around vessel. Each unit may consist of several
concentric semicircles, all plain lines, plain lines alternating with ticked lines, narrow bands with large spurs jutting from one edge, cross-hatched bands with spurs, and
various combinations. A common dividing element between these units consists of two vertical lines between
which a reversed S-shaped line is drawn, with short lines

p

pointing to~vard its ends from the flanking lines (best seen
in Plate 1, I, L). Straight lines and step-frets may be combined with curved lines. Spirals, whorls, scrolls, circles,
and negative disks outlined by cross-hatched areas are all
combined in a wide variety of pleasing designs. Rims of
compound bowls usually bear simple horizontal lines widely spaced but may be plain on the one hand (Plate 1, H) or
more elaborately decorated on the other (Plate 1, A-Aâ€™).
Selected examples of shoulder designs on compound bowls
in Plate 1, I-P, ~vith N also including rim decoration of
"eyes" like those of type Bowie Engraved (Plate 8). The
very deep bowls may have rim designs like those described
~(Plate 2, A, B, D) or completely angular motifs repeated
many times around vessel (Plate 2, F, I); these are regarded as a distinct variety within the type. Red pigment
may occasionally appear in lines of dark vessels and in at
least one case, white pigment provides contrast on a redfilmed vessel (Plate 2, B). Usually, however, the red film
provides a strong contrast with the light buff-colored clay
exposed by engraving.
CULTURAL AFFILIATIONS
Very common in McCurtain Focus, with many vessels having
both red film and shell temper. Also a Texarkana Focus
type but relatively less frequent there and neither shell
temper nor red film used as much as in McCurtain Focus
components; moreover, some red vessels have clay-grit or
no temper, and some shell-tempered vessels lack red film.
A few vessels occur in Titus Focus components (Plates 1,
E-G; 2, B) where they appear to be trade pieces from either
McCurtain or Texarkana Focus, or both. In one case (Harris, 1953) this type appears to be associated with European
~rade material; otherwise it is pre-European but probably
relatively late within the Fulton Aspect.
D ~tSTRIBUTION
Choctaw and Mc~Eurtain Counties in southeast Oklahoma; Lamar, Red River, and Bowie Counties in northeast Texas;
probably southwest corner of Arkansas along great bend of
Red River. May occur more widely as trade ware.
ESTI.,lVI~TED AGE
1400-1700 A. D., perhaps beginning earlier or surviving later.

PASTE
Temper: Fine clay-grit or a little sand, or both. Pulverized
shell in specimens from central Arkansas (A, C).
Texture:

Fine, compact.

Surface may feel slightly sandy.

Color: Surfaces buff, light to dark brown, gray to nearly black.
Cores gray to black. Fire-mottling only on lighter-colored
vessels.
~Surface finish:

Smoothed to well polished.

FORM
Wall thickness: 3 to 5 mm.
Lip:

Rounded, usually turned sharply outward.

Base: Convex or only slightly flattened, no thicker than sides.
"Extended base" or pedestal not infrequent, hollow and
wall about same thickness as body wall (H, K).
Vessel shape and size: Principally small bottles with spouts
varying in shape: vertical, out-flaring, slightly tapered, or
bulging slightly in middle (C, D). A few ollas known with
globular bodies and small mouths (J). Ollas considerably
larger than largest bottles.
DEC(~RATION
Treatment: Engraving, punctating.
Designs: Sets of concentric arcs placed around body in two
ways: upper sets arch upward, lower sets arch downward,
fitting under the upper arches. Arches always repeated
four times around body. The four uppermost lines form a
square around the spout base which is often filled with
small punctates made through the polished surface
J, K). The spaces at the base may also be punctated
Red, and occasionally white, pigments occur in lines.
CULTURAL AFFILIATIONS
Infrequent occurrence in any one site but widely spread in
components of Titus, Belcher, Texarkana, and Mid-Ouachita Foci.

PASTE
Temper: Often none visible; also fine clay-grit or (rarely)
fine white pulverized substance which may be bone.
Textu~â€™e: Fine and compact to somewhat granular. Well fired,
fairly hard.
Color: Surfaces usually various shades of dark brown and
dark grayish brown, ranging to nearly black. Lighter
shades of brown and gray appear, particularly with mottling due to uneven firing. Cores dark gray to black.
Surface finish: Exterior and interior both well smoothed to
highly polished.
FOI~M
Wall thickness: Extreme range from less than 2 to about 8
mm.; average 5 ram.
Lip: Very thin and rounded; may be turned outward slightly.
Base: On most small bowls the bottoms are shallow and evenly
convex without distinct base; on large carinated bowls the
base is a flat round disk to which the body wall is attached.
Vessel shape and size: Only definitely known shape is that of
carinated bowl, in two varieties: (1) with rim either quite
vertical or inclined outward slightly, 3 to 5 cm. high, and
body consisting of shallow, evenly convex basin of less
height than the rim; (2) larger bowls with straight vertical rim 5 to 7 cm. high, and body shaped like truncated
cone of definitely greater height than the rim (contrast lV~
and Q in Plate 4 with specimens at top). Bottles formerly
included in this type are now considered as Hatchel Engraved (Plate 29).
DECORATION
Treatment: Engraving and (rarely) fingernail punctations between lines.
Designs: Confined to bowl rims. Usually two or three horizontal lines at top, below which is a zone of narrow bands
arranged in rectilinear patterns. Occasionally the patterns
are compromises between rectilinear and curvitinear, ~s in
Figures C, H, I, M, P. The bands may be filled with crosshatching, with short dash lines singly or in pairs, with tiny
punctates made through the polished surface, or with a
row of fingernail punctations as in Figure G. Fine ticking
occurs on some lines. Design units commonly repeated
four times around rim. Many unique combinations made,
as exemplified by the sketches. When pigment present in
lines, it is usually white, but red and green occur.

CULTURA~ AFFILIATIONS
Â¯ ype apparently belongs exclusively to Texarkana Focus, even
trade pieces being almost unknown in other loci. Relationships apparent in the designs (but not vessel forms) of

intentional addition to clay.
Texture: Fine, compact.
Color: Mahogany brown to black but shading off into dark
gray-browns; buff or reddish brown occasionally. Cores
~darker than surface. ~Mottling.

Lip: Rounded, direct on most bowls, turned outward on bottles
and some bowls.
Base: Convex on bowls; convex to slightly flattened on bottles.
,%ressel shape and size: Webb and Dodd (1941, pp. 90-96 and
~Plates 15, 16) first described type with 15 "sub-types" more
or less equivalent to a variety of shapes. Most of these not
now regarded as included in this type but assigned to others such as Hodges Engraved, Glassell Engraved, and Taylor Engraved. Plate 5 shows range of forms now placed in
this type: most common are bottles (C, J-M) and small
bowls with rounded bottoms, narrow shoulder bent upward and inward at sharp angle, and rim bent outward
again to about same angle as body below shoulder (B, F-I).
The compound vessel (I~) is of the latter form surmounted
on a globular lower chamber. A third form, less common,
has rounded bottom, high side slanted inward and low rim
bent outward (A, E). Other forms may be added even~ually. Bottles may reach height of 25 cm.; bowls have
diameters of 10 to 28 cmo

DECORATION
Treatment: Engraving, punctating.
~Designs: On narrow shoulder area they are much like Simms
Engraved except that at four points where pattern is repeated there is a small node jutting straight out from edge
of shoulder (not visible in photographs on opposite page).
~In addition the rim is decorated with from one to three
encircling lines and one or two rows of engraved dash lines
Or tiny punctates cut through finished surface. Four tiny
lobes may appear on lip, directly above nodes on shoulder
i(B). Bottle designs also consistently show short dash lines
between concentric circles and flower or star-like elements
in center of each of the four sets of concentric circles (C,
J-M). Both white and red pigments found in designs.
CULTURAL AFFILIATIONS
A Belcher Focus type, with trade pieces found in Texarkana

PASTE
Temper: Pulverized shell, fine clay-grit, occasionally pulverized bone.
Texture: Compact, brittle; breaks with sharper edges than
most Caddoan area pottery, hardness 3.0 or more.
Color: Surfaces pale yellow, orange-yellow, light brown, light
to dark gray, etc., generally with considerable fire-mottling.
Cores gray to black.
Surface finish: Interiors smoothed but seldom polished; exteriors covered with fine ridges except in rare cases where
smoothed areas alternate with ridged areas (A, B).
Wall thickness: Range 3 to 6 ram., average 4 ram.
Lip: Rounded and turned outward (D, I-I, I, K, L) but more
often considerably thickened and nearly round in crosssection (E, G, J, ~i).
Base: Usually convex and vessels do not stand up well; sometimes partly flattened (A, B, M).
Vessel shape and size: Peculiar drop-shape is typical, widest
part below mid-section, height ranging from 7 to 33 cm.
Jar shape with everted rim (A, B) quite rare, as are
handles. A few examples of globular jars (D, H, L) generally much smaller than drop-shapes.

Treatment: Ridging, incising.
Designs: Incising may be used to make lines under the short
out-turned rim (H, K, L). Otherwise the vessel (with exceptions like A, B) is completely covered with tiny ridges
close together and vertically placed. Presumably the stillplastic clay was grooved with a broad, flat tool; ~f so, it was
skillfully done with ridges very evenly spaced. Possibly
the ridges were sometimes applied to surface, for they
sometimes come loose like applique work and the ridges
may be closer together at the neck than on the middle of

BLAKELY ENGRAVED
(Plate 7)
PASTE
Temper: Usually none; otherwise finely pulverized shell or
small amount of sand.
Texture: Fine, compact.
Color: Shades of gray and gray-brown from light to dark and
nearly black. Occasionally olive-gray tone, light to dark.
Better-made vessels (A-G) evenly colored without firemottling; such vessels as H, I, have mottling but typological status uncertain. Cores dark gray to black.
Surface finish: Fair to good polish.
FORM
Wall thickness: 3 to 6 ram.
Lip: Rounded, turned outward.
Base: Usually convex, otherwise somewhat flattened.
Vessel shape and size: Principally or entirely bottles with spouts
either of even diameter or tapered slightly and then expanded at mouth. A marked angle appears in lower body
in some cases (A). Use of three large, hollow legs expanded
at the feet is not uncommon (E, F). The cylindrical vessel
form with small mouth at top and four small lugs perforated vertically is a peculiar development in the Ouachita River valley, usually undecorated (Hodges, 1945); this
specimen possibly of Blakely type because of design.
DECORATION
Treatment: Engraving.
Designs: Very simple but striking, conisting of groups of three
or five parallel lines running down body. When vertical,
these sets are repeated two, three, or four times (A-C, I),
and usually if not always contain three lines. When they
slant across the body they contain five lines and have short
curved spurs of hatched bands and single lines on either
side of the main set (E, F). The two outermost of the five
lines may end or bend outward toward the ends of the
bands (D, G), and there may be border lines encircling the
top of the body (E-G). The five-line sets appear only twice,
on opposite sides of the body, so far as has been determined.
The curved lines on the body of H contain three to a set in
some places, four in others. Vessel I employes three sets
of three lines each. Red pigment sometimes appears in lines.

CULTURAL AFFILIATIONS
McCurtain and Texarkana Foci. The former seems to have
more of the very deep, red-filmed bowls, often with shell
temper, similar to those in type Avery Engraved (Plate 2) ;
Texarkana Focus appears to have more of the shallow carinated bowls with neither red film nor shell temper, similar to those in type Barkman Engraved (Plate 4). The vessels classified as Bowie Engraved might be assigned to the
two other types except that they are linked by the unique
designs. These defintely do not conform to the common
insistence on four-times repetition of Avery, Barkman, and
many other Caddoan types.
DISTRIBUTION
Same as Avery Engraved. Also occurs as trade ware in Titus
Focus (H).
ESTIMATED AGE
Same as Avery Engraved but unknown so far from historic
sites.

BULLARD BRUSHED

(Plate 9)
PASTE
Temper: Clay-grit; occasionally pulverized bone.
Texture: Coarse but not crumbly.
Color: Surfaces vary from cream to light yellowish brown and
medium to dark brown. Cores gray to dark brown and
black. Much fire mottling.
Surface finish: Poorly smoothed inside, roughened by brushing on outside.
FORM
Wall thickness: 4 to 9 mm.
Lip: Convex and either direct or turned outward.
Base: Round, thick, flat disk to which wall is attached.
Vessel shape and size: Jars with rims that curve gently into
body (A-D, H, G), tapered vessels (E), and jars with rim
meeting body at slight angle (F). Vessel I appears to be a
conical bowl although it may have been refashioned from
the lower part of a broken jar. Size ranges from small vessels like C and E to large jars 35 cm. or more in height
(H). Soot and grease stains indicate cooking function.
DECORATION
Treatment: Brushing, punctating.
Designs: Bodies covered with brushing usually vertical but
may run crosswise or diagonally (I-I, G). Rim may be brushed horizontally or vertically and from two to four horizontal rows of fingernail punctates made through the
brushing (A, B, E, F). Fingernail punctates may be made
end-to-end in rows (C) or in pinched ridges (D). Two opposed strap handles (C) or solid lugs (B, E) sometimes appear on Frankston Focus vessels.
CULTURAL AFFILIATIONS
Principally a Frankston Focus type, also occurs in Titus Focus.
Similar in general shape and coarse paste to La Rue Neckbanded (Plate 42) and Maydelle Incised (Plate 46), both of
which are also found in both Frankston and Titus Focus
compi)nents. The three types together constitute the utility
ware of Frankston Focus and part of that of Titus Focus.
Classification of all three types is difficult unless rim
present, for brushed body sherds could belong to any of
them. They also account for the very high incident of
brushed body sherds in Frankston Focus as compared
with pottery of all other Caddoan complexes.
DISTRIBUTION
Principally in drainage areas of Neches and upper Sabine
Rivers. Becomes less frequent eastward in Sulphur River
drainage area where Titus Focus components are found.
Carried westward into central and north-central Texas as
trade ware, as other Frankston Focus types; specimen B
from Coleman County.

CANTON INCISED
(Plate 10)

PASTE
Temper: Abundant clay-grit in which pulverized sherds sometimes recognized. Pulverized bone may be added to clay~
grit.
Texture: Coarse but firm.
Color: Shades of brown from light to dark with chocolate
predominating. Some fire-mottling but no strongly contrasting colors. Cores dark.
Surface finish: Both exterior and interior smoothed but rarely
polished. Surfaces retain ripples from use of smoothing
tools.
FORM
Wall thickness: Range about 4 to 9 mm., average about 6 mm.
Lip: Rounded or slightly flattened but not thickened.
Base: Flat, circular disk to which body wall attached.
Vessel shape and size: Cylindrical vessels most characteristic,
ranging in height from 15 to 42 cm. and perhaps more, in
diameter from 12 to 38 cm. and perhaps more (D, E, IrI and
rim sherds F, G). Also carinated bowls, diameter ranging
up to more than 30 cm., rims straight and vertical or sloping inward or outward (A and rim sherds B, C). Small
hemispherical bowls (I). Two suspension holes may occur
in rim of cylindrical vessels.
DECORATION
Treatment: Incising, punctating, fingernail impressions.
Designs: Parallel diagonal lines around rim, all same direction
(B), alternating in direction (A), alternating with intervening spaces filled with small punctates or fingernail marks
(D, E, H), nested together in hachures (F, G), or crossed
in diagonal grid (C). Also small triangles filled with punctates, pendant from horizonal borderline (I). Always confined to rim.
CULTURAL AFFILIATIONS
A Sanders Focus type. Similar incised and punctated designs
are known in most other Caddoan foci, widely in southeastern United States, and elsewhere. However, their use
on rims of carinated bowls and cylindrical vessels constitutes a very special trait, limited to Canton type and
Sanders Focus; occurrence of this combination elsewhere
indicative of trade relationship. The type has been reported from Nelson Focus in Choctaw County, Oklahoma
(Bell a.nd Baerreis, 1951, pp. 48-53), but its components are
just across Red River from Sanders Site in Lamar County.
DISTRIBUTION
From southern Choctaw County, Oklahoma, southward to
vicinity of Grand Saline on upper Sabine River in Van
Zandt County, Texas; westward into Fannin County;
eastward to Titus County. Trade sherds recognized as far
west as Dallas area and Lake Whitney on middle Brazos
River.
ESTIMATED AGE
Later part of G~bson Aspect, possibly 1000 A. D. but could be
earlier or later. Cross-dated with Haley Focus by trade
pottery in both directions.

Rims may be plain, brushed horizontally, or have from
one to four horizontal rows of punctates. In one case (D)
punctates of triangular shape are spaced at regular intervals around rim and down body between fillets. Faii~$
brushing may appear running vertically in spaces between
fillets. No rim or body quadration.
CULTURAL AFFILIATIONS
A minor element in Titus and Texarkana Foci. District from
Harleton Appliqued of Titus Focus because the latter occurs only in pre-European sites, whereas Cass Appliqued
occurs not only in pre-European components of Titus and
Texarkana Foci, but in the Hunt and Clements sites in
Cass County as well, where some graves contained iron
and glass artifacts. The Harleton and Cass types together
constitute a unique elaboration of the applique technique
which is absent in most Caddoan complexes.
DISTRIBUTION
The few specimens recognized so far are from a small part of
northeast Texas in Morris, Cass, and Bowie Counties.

Color: Buff, light brown, gray-brown with considerable firemottling. Cores gray to dark brown.
Surface finish: Bowls smoothed inside, ollas not smoothed inside; exteriors roughened by decoration.
FORM
Wall thickness: 5 to 9 ram.
Lip: Rounded, rolled outward.
Base: Flat, circular disk or convex and no thicker than side
walls.
Vessel shape and size: Those illustrated are most of the complete vessels on record. All but A are ollas and A perhaps
should not be included; it is a large compound bowl 27 cm.
high and 31 cm. across mouth. B is 23 cm. high and 25 cm.
in diameter, with faintly angular shoulder well below
middle. C-Câ€™ is slightly larger in the body than B but total
height unknown; D-Dâ€™ is taller than B but smaller in diameter. Two other specimens are about size of C-Câ€™.

DECORATION
Treatment: Brushing; possibly some incising.
Designs: B-Dâ€™ have four brushed areas on body, those on B
and D-Dâ€™ arching up from near base over shoulder and
down again, those on C-Câ€™ going in circle. Specimens not
illustrated also brushed in circles. Presumably brushing
done with handful of grass while clay still plastic. Olla
rims rough (B) or scraped and smoothed (D-Dâ€™). Large
bowl A brushed horizontally on rim and lower body, has
incised design poorly smoothed over on shoulder, repeated
four times.
CULTURAL AFFILIATIONS
Found at Clements and Hunt sites in Cass County near Atlanta.
Both sites have produced consistently similar ceramics and
some graves have had European trade materials. However, most of pottery types of historic Glendora Focus have
not appeared here and the vessels are mixtures of Texarkana and Titus Focus types. Assignment to any of these
loci, or to a new one, awaits more field evidence.
DISTRIBUTION
So far recognized only at Clements and Hunt sites, Cass County.
ESTIMATED AGE
Somewhere between 1500 and 1800 A. D., perhaps historic or
shortly preceding first European contacts,

P_A;STE
Temper: Usually abundant, finely-pulverized shell; otherwise,
fine clay-grit
Texture: Fine, firm, well-fired, does not break easily.
Color: Dark shades of brown and gray; occasionally tan to
cream. Cores gray to black.
Surface finish: Interiors smoothed to polished; exteriors same
where not roughened by decoration.
FORM
Wall thickness:
2 to 4 mm. (thinnest pottery in Caddoan
region).
Lip: Thin, rounded, turned outward.
Base: Ahvays convex; vessels do not stand up well.
Vessel shape and size:
Two principal forms: (1) globular
bowls 12 to 20 cm. in maximum diameter, with short rims
and mouths considerably smaller than bodies; (2) jars with
very high rims flared outward so mouth diameter equal to
or greater than body (A, D, G, J, L) and height up to 20
cm. or more. Webb collection has triple vessel, three small
globular bowls joined at sides with struts of clay.
DECORATION
Treatment: Dentate stamping (both individual and rocker),
incising, trailing, and punctating.
Designs: Most typical are graceful scroll bands repeated four
times around vessel, the bands filled with longitudinal incised lines (C, E, M) or dentate stamps set close together
across each band (F, H, I). Bodies may also bear simple
arched bands (B) or sets of trailed concentric circles (K).
The short rims of these bowls almost always are covered
with dentate stamps placed vertically as units (E, I, K) or
as rocker lines (B, C, M). Fingernail punctates in vertical
rows on rim may substitute for stamping (F). The highrimmed jars have scroll bands filled with dentate stamping
on rim (G) or both rim and body (D). A few simulations
of these techniques are classified as "Cowhide Stamped."
Thus, A is like D even though the bands are filled with
simple punctates, and L is like G even though the crosslines in the scroll bands are incised, not stamped.

Cl!LTI!RAL ~TIONS
Essentially a Belcher Focus t .ype, but occurs in Texarkana and
Mid-Ouachita Foci as minor element. Specimen L from
Greer site in lower Arkansas River Valley (Moore, 1908)
may prove type extended into European times. In Caddoan
area proper, however, it is entirely pre-European. Shell
temper is far more frequent in it than in other Belcher
Focus types. An affinity with Foster Trailed-Incised (Plate
20) is seen in the shape of the tall-rimmed jars and in the
sets of trailed concentric circles on the body of G; the
Foster type also includes shell temper frequently.
DISTRI~BUTION.
Red River valley from Belcher site in northwest Louisiana to
great bend area, extending into Bowie County, Texas; also
in components of Mid-Ouachita Focus in southwest Arkansas and at Greer site, lower Arkansas River valley.

Temper: Clay-grit; occasionally pulverized bone added.
~Texture: Coarse, lumpy, often crumbly. Temper particles often show on surface.
Color: Light, medium, and dark brown; reddish brown; graybrown; rarely black.
Surface finish: Smoothed to polished.
FORM
Wall thickness: 4 to 10 ram.; usually 5 to 6 mm.
Lip: Usually plain rounded; also flat but unwidened, flat and
widened (Plate 14, K), cambered (two convex edges meeting in ridge), thickened and circular in cross-section (Plate
14, E), and bent outward with scalloped edge (Plate 14, C).
]Base:
Convex and of even curvature and thickness across
bottom.
Vessel shape and size: Most frequent form is carinated bowl,
up to 40 cm. and perhaps more across mouth, rims uprigh~
or slanted outward slightly (Plate 14, C, F, H, I). Next
most frequent are globular bowls with plain, cambered, or
circular lips (Plate 14, E, G). Simple bowls (Plate 14, A,
K) of minor importance but usually have two or four rims
peaks. Cylindrical bowl (Plate 14, D), square bowl with
slightly raised corners (~late 14, B), and vessel with side
wall stepped outward (~Plate 14, J).
DECORATION
Treatment: Incising, punctating.
Designs: Many variations of scroll motif, plus alternating rings
and triangles. A circle or ring is usually the central element, flanked by inclined bands or paired triangles. Flanks
of inclined bands filled with p.unctates or parallel lines;
circles and rings also filled w~th these but punctates and
lines may be used alternately as fillers on same vessels.
Inclined bands may be plain or have bisecting line down
middle to connect bottom of one circle with top of next one.
No ticking or cross-hatching has been noted. Punctates are
]plain, ring-like (made with hollow reed?), or hemiconical
m shape. Design units often repeated four times (Plate 14,
A, B, D, J) but repetitions up to 15 or more also common.
Plates 15, 16 show further variations of designs, with F-~NI
on Plate 16 being "hybrid" or blendings with those of Pennington Punctated-Incised. White and pale blue pigments
found in designs, red ochre rarely.
CULT~ ~LIATIONS
Alto, Haley, and Spiro Foci of Gibson Aspect. Above description applies to Alto Focus; northward into Arkansas and
Oklahoma vessel forms change and four-times repetition
of scroll motif much stronger. Closely related to French
Fork Incised in central Louisiana (Ford, 1951).

DISTRIBD~ON
From central East Texas to southwest Arkansas and eastern
Oklahoma. Westward to middle Brazos River in central
Texas at Chupek site near Waco. Trade sherds occur at
Greenhouse site, central Louisiana (Ford, 1951).

PASTE
Temper: Abundant coarse clay-grit and carbonized particles;
occasionally some pulverized bone.
Texture: From moderately coarse to very coarse, lumpy, and
crumbly.
Color: Various shades of yellowish brown, red (not filmed),
reddish brown; occasionally gray-brown to black. Cores
like surface.
Surface finish: Smoothed but not often polished.
FORM
Wall thickness: 4 to 12 mm,, average 6-7 mm.
Lip: Rounded or flat but not thickened.
Base: Usually convex; sometimes flat and thicker than side
wal! but not a separate disk to which wall was attached.
Vessel shape and size: Most common are carinated and simple
bowls ranging from 15 to 45 cm. across. Simple bowls have
sides from slightly to pronouncedly convex (B, C, G), approaching hemispherical shape (A) ; some have sides slightly concave or recurved (D). Two or four rim peaks occur
rarely (F). Carinated bowl rims slant inward or out~,ard
slightly or stand vertica! (E, I). Bottles fairly common but
known only from sherds (H). Also cylindrical and barrelshaped vessels similar to those in type Dunkin Incised
(Plate 18), and small jars indicated by sherds.
DECORATION
Treatment: Incising with lines almost always smoothed over.
Designs: Horizonal lines encircling vessel rim or upper part of
bottle body, Carinated bowls usually have lines only on
upper half of rim (I), other vesse! forms have them variable distances downward from lip. Lines occasionally
"â€™overhang", an effect produced by holding the cutting tool
at a downward angle so that line is deepest along its upper
edge.
CULTUR~_L A~FILIATIONS
Associated with Alto and Gahagan Foci of Gibson Aspect. Related to types Coles Creek Incised, Greenhouse Incised, and
Hardy Incised of Coles Creek and Troyville complexes in
Louisiana (described in Ford, 1951), all of which have
simple encircling incised lines and include cylindrical and
barrel-shaped vessels as well as simple and hemispherical
bowls, but lack carinated bowls and bottles. Davis Incised
can also be distinguished from them by considerably greater thickness of vessel walls, much coarser and softer
paste, less polish, lack of thickened rims and incised lines
on top of lip, reddish and reddish-bro~vn colors, etc. Davis
Incised also lacks very shallow bottom line and row of
punctates sometimes found on Coles Creek and Troyville
types. In Caddoan area it is closely related to Hickory Fine
Engraved (Plate 31), the designs differing only in technique, and to East Incised of Haley Focus (Plate 19) as
discussed under that type.

PASTE
Temper:
Clay-grit; pulverized bone sometimes added, also
carbon or sand.
Texture: Coarse. ranging from compact to crumbly.
Color: Light yellowish-brown, reddish brown, medium brown
and chocolate. Cores gray, gray-brown, and same color as
surface.
Surface finish: Poorly smoothed to fair polish, except for decorated parts.
FORM
Wall thickness: 4 to 8 ram.
Lip: Rounded, flush with rim, rarely widened and flat.
Base:
Flat on cylindrical and barrel-shaped jars, rarely
square; convex on bowls. Of same thickness as side wall
in both cases.
Vessel shape and size: Primarily cylindrical vessels with sides
straight to slightly convex, approaching barrel shape (A-C,
E, H, K), height from 20 to 30 cm. or perhaps more. Carlâ€™
hated (I, J), simple (D, G), and compound bowls (F) are
minor forms. The few square bases known are on cylindrical vessels (E, H). Handles, applique, unknown.
DECORATION
Treatment: Incising and fingernail punctations.
Designs: Sets of parallel lines in wide variety of straight-line
patterns. Arranged in triangles, diamonds, hachures, simple parallel lines, and grids of crossed diagonals, placed
around upper halves of cylindrical vessels, or over whole
body, around rims of carinated bowls, and around variable
parts of simple bowls. Remainder of body plain or covered
with fingernail pinches or punctations (A, K). Zone just
below lip left plain (C), filled with crossed diagonal lines
(B), or with arched impressions like Weches type (~H).
CULTURAL ~IATIONS
Primarily an Alto Focus type, but extending in form of jars
into Haley Focus components. Above description covers
only most definite inclusions, there being several unsolved
roblems (see Newell and Krieger, 1949, pp. 110-116 for
iscussion). Vessels originally described as Kiam Incised
by Newell were included in Dunkin by Krieger in above
publication, but are now separate again (Plate 40). Vessels with very closely spaced and crudely made incised
lines and cross-lines, resembling brushing (Newell and
Krieger, Fig. 44, A-E), are still of uncertain status. Dunkin
as now defined closely resembles some vessels of Pease
Brushed-Incised of Bossier Focus (Plate 53) and the latter
may be an outgrowth of Dunkin; however, it lacks cylindrical vessels, carinated and simple bowls; and conversely,
Dunkin lacks any evidence of applique, punctates placed in
rows to divide design panels or in fillets, brushed surfaces
between fillets, rim peaks, and handles. A relationship
with Mazique Incised of lower Mississippi valley (described
in Ford, 1951) may be assumed.
DISTRIBUTION
Principally in central part of East Texas but ~lso in southwest
Arkansas on Red River and in Clark County (East mound) ;

EAST INCISED
(Plate 19)

PASTE
~emper: Fine clay-grit or small amount of sand.
Texture: Fine.
Color: Tan, various shades of brown and reddish brown. Red
produced by firing temperatures on mottled surfaces (C,
,F) and surfaces also sometimes red-filmed (A, D, F, J, N).
Cores brown, gray.
~;urface finish: Smoothed but seldom polished.
Wall thickness: 3 to 5 ram.
Lip: Rounded and flush with rim.
Base: Usually convex on bowls, flat on other vessels.
Vessel shape and size: Small vessels, not over 18 or 20 cm. in
greatest height or diameter. Simple bowls have convex,
straight, or slightly recurved sides standing more or less
vertical or sloping slightly inward or outward (A, B, D, G,
H, J, M) ; rims may have two opposed peaks (D, H), four
peaks .(M); two opposed tabs built out on side of lip (J),
and tabs may or may not have small pits sunk in center.
An oval effigy bowl (E) has animal head at one end and
pointed tail at other; the two peaks of bowl H suggest a
conventionalization of this effigy form. Other vessels are
cylindrical (C), barrel-shaped (F, N), barrel-shaped with
broadest part below the middle (K) or above the middle
(L), and deep bowl like truncated cone (I). Two opposed
suspension holes in rim are common on upright vessels (F,
I, K, L, N).
DECORATION
Treatment: Incised lines, partly or entirely smoothed over.
Designs: Horizonta! lines encircling vessel rims, except where
they are interrupted by sets of semicircular lines placed
under rim peaks or effigy features (A, D, E). In at least
one case (iM) the lines are parallel with peaks and dips of
rim. Vessel A was filmed after lines were cut and sm.oothed; vessels D, G, N have lines cut through film as m engraving technique, but both methods included in this type
for convenience. ~ite pigment appears rarely in lines (B).
CULTURAL AFFILIATIONS
Belongs to Haley Focus but probably only to certain components such as the East mound in Clark County, Arkansas
(all vessels in Plate 19 from there except J from Crenshaw
site on Red River in Arkansas). A close relative of Davis
Incised of Alto and Gahagan Foci (Plate 17) and thus related to certain Louisiana types in Coles Creek and Troyville complexes (see Davis Incised). East differs from
Davis in apparent absence of carinated bowls and bottles,
much finer paste and thinner walls, red film, suspension
holes, much smaller size, effigies, rim tabs, dipping of lines
under rim peaks, and perhaps in odd shapes such as K, L.
Both have either two or four rim peaks, simple bowls,
cylindrical and barrel-shaped vessels.
DISTRIBUTION
Southwest Arkansas from middle Ouachita River to great bend
of Red River.
t~SThMATED AGE
Near end of Gibson Aspect time, possibly 1000 A. D.
REFEREN~E:R
Not described as type before. Discussed as northern relative
of Davis Incised in Newell and Krieger, 1949, p. 217, Figures 63, 65.

FOSTER ~A~LED-INCISED
(Plate 20)
PASTE
Temper: Clay-grit or very abundant finely-pulverized shell
Texture: Compact, fairly fine; rather soft, friable.
Color: Light to dark browns and gray-browns; cores generally
darker than surfaces. Some fire mottling.
Surface finish: Interiors smoothed to almost polished; exteriors
about same in few areas not gouged up by design work.
FORM
Wall thickness: 4 to 7 mm.
Lip: Rounded, turned outward slightly to sharply; outer edge
sometimes notched.
Base: Usually convex so vessel does not stand up well; sometimes flat.
Vessel shape and size: Small jars only, height 7 to 20 cm. One
of outstanding features is height of rim in proportion to
body; occasionally rim and body are same height but
usually rim somewhat less. The globular bowl with short,
out-curving rim (H) is an exception. Rim may be nearly
vertical (D) but usually it flares outward so that mouth
diameter is notably greater than that of body.

D]DCORATION
Treatment: Incising, "trailing" (incising with a broad, roundtipped tool), punctating, and applique.
Designs: Most common designs are those shown in A and ~,
the high rim being divided into from two to seven horizontal panels of incised lines usually running downward to
the left (A, B, C, F, G, L) but occasionally downward to
right or alternating in herringbone fashion. Incised rim
lines usually made completely across rim first, then divided into panels with trailed lines cutting across them.
In some cases there are no trailed lines, but zones of incised diagonals made separately (C, L). Other rim treatments include diagonals made with fingernails instead of
incising (D) and horizontal lines made of fingernail impressions end-to-end (I). Some of handsomest designs include large open scrolls of trailed or incised lines with
punctates in the flanks (J, K). Body designs consist mainly
of concentric circles repeated two, three, or four times
(usually four). An applique node, often split into three
tiny lobes, usually occurs in the center of each set of concentric circles. Other designs consist of sets of curved
lines hooked together (H, L) and concentric semicircles
(G). Plain bodies (C) are rare.

CI/LTURAL i%FFILIATIONS
The trailed body designs bear an obvious affinity with those
of type Keno Trailed (Plate 39), but are simpler and the
vessel shapes are very different. The scrolls on J and K
suggest affinity with those of Cowhide Stamped (Plate
13), Foster Trailed-Incised belongs primarily to ]Belcher
and Texarkana Foci, but occurs in Mld-Ouachita Focus as
well. Foster and Cowhide, oddly, include most of the shelltempered vessels in all three of these foci.

DIST~I~BU~ON
Primarily in Red River valley from great bend downstream to
Belcher site near Shreveport; Bowie County, Texas; Little
River, Hempstead, Miller, Lafayette Counties, Arkansas.

Surface finish: Fair to good polish.
,Wall thickness: 3 to 5 ram.
Lip: Rounded and flush with rim or turned outward slightly.
Base: Usually evenly convex on both bowls and bottles, but
some bowls flat (I).
Vessel shape and size: Nearly all bowls and bottles. Carinated
bowls have shallow bottoms and high rims, usually vertical
but may slant inward or outward slightly; vessel F seems
to be this form with rim slanted far inward and body molded into four lobes. Simple conical bowls (I). Small jar with
squat body and rim slanted sharply outward (NI). Peculiar
vessel shaped like canteen is completely closed except for
small opening at one edge (K-Kâ€™). One oval, boat-shaped
vessel probably modification of carinated bowl (B). Bottles have vertica! spout and widest part of body below

DI~CORATION
Treatment: Engraving, punctating, applique.
Designs: Most typical are rectilinear pane}s of cross-hatched
bands and plain or ticked lines flanking them (A-C). Arcs
or semicircles may be substituted CD, F, G, I, K, M, N).
Negative scrolls outlined by cross-hatched areas may be
horizontal (E), slanting (H), or both (L). Bottles typically
have low, polished applique ridges, single (Q), double
(R), or triple (O), in two, three, or four sets, and on
upper or lower parts of body or both. Bottle designs consist mainly of horizontal lines encircling upper body and
sometimes ticked, plus cross-hatched ~ands runmng vertically (R), arched (O, P), or both (Q). Peculiar knobs
may be molded to rim of carinated bowls (B, D). Bowls
tend to repeat design four times, but two, three, five, six,
and seven are known. Bottles tend to repeat two or three
times, seldom four. Scrolls (E, H, L) may not belong to
type. Red and white pigments occur in lines but contrast
usually sufficient between dark surface and lighter core.

Cl!LTURRAL AFF]~LI,ATIOI~S
Principally a Mid-Ouachita Focus type but occurs also in Texarkana Focus. Use of ticked lines is somewhat like that of
Means Engraved (Plate 47) of Mid-Ouachita Focus; shape
and decoration of carinated bowls bear similarities with
Barkman Engraved of Texarkana Focus (Plate 4).

DISTI~IBUTION
Southwest Arkansas, especially Ouachita River valley, decreasing in frequency toward Red River valley but extending
into Boa~.â€™ie County, Texas.

FULTON ASPECT EFFIGY BOWLS
(Plate 22)
GENERAL NOTES
These bowls may be expected almost throughout the area
covered by the Fulton Aspect in Texas, Louisiana, Arkansas, and Oklahoma; they also occur in other parts of the
Eastern United States. A, I, probably from Texarkana
Focus association; B, C, Titus Focus; D, F, H, J, K, Allen
Focus; E, G, Frankston Focus. Temper, texture, color, and
finish variable, depending upon general features of focus
in which specimen belongs; however, none in Caddoan area
known with shell temper. Form quite similar, in all foci,
consisting entirely of bowls shaped like truncated cone,
varying only in steepness of sides, and bearing two modeled attachments on opposite sides of the mouth. The
crenelated attachments (A, D, F, G, K) are probabl~; highly
conventionalized bird~heads (the point of A is divided like
a .beak). Opposite these crenelated attachments are figurines of animals and human beings, standing or sitting
on smaI1 projecting platforms (A, D, F, H, K), or a simple
projection like a bird tail (G). Effigies plainly of birds
with prominent heads and tails are fairly common (C),
while others are conventionalized and barely recognizable
(E, I). Some bowls have ~tw~o equal attachments, symbolizing creatures whose identity can hardly be guessed (B,
J). Human heads are known on bowls in Arkansas, facing
either inward or outward, but are very rare in Caddoan
archeology. From three to five horizontal incised lines encircle the rim of all bowls of this class; the lines are usually
smoothed over and they may or may not dip below the two
attachments. Red and white pigments sometimes occur in
these lines.

FULTON ASPECT EFFIGY VESSELS
(Plate 23)
GENERAL NOTES
These vessels reflect generally more advanced craftsmanship
than the simple effigy bowls of Plate 22, and rather than
being found throughout the Fulton Aspect, they tend to be
associated with the elaborate ceramics of the Texarkana,
Belcher, and Mid-Ouachita Foci. A, D, E, may be assigned to type Hodges Engraved. The full-bodied effigies
B, C, F are actually bottles with hollow bodies and an
opening in top of head about same diameter as those of
ordinary bottles; they are confined to Mid-Ouachita Focus
in Arkansas. A is a superb example of impressionistic
modeling, the spout set at the back of the head rather than
at center, and two sides of face bearing different designs;
the left eye has below it a three-pointed â€™%Veeping Eye"
symbol (see also Plate 32, G) while the right eye is encircled .by a ticked scroll line. The effigy J-Jâ€™ is also an
elaborated bottle, probably representing a turtle; the top
of the ,body is decorated in the manner of pottery type
Belcher Ridged (Plate 6), and a panel on each side has a
design as on bowls of type Glassell Engraved (Plate 25).
Bowl I is like those of Plate 22 except that two small appendages at the sides represent wings or fins. Both I and
J-Jâ€™ are from the Belcher Focus complex at :Belcher mound,
Louisiana.

:H is also a bowl, but globular rather than

conical, and the turtle head is built out on the side rather
than attached to the lip; it belongs to Texarkana or lYlcCurtain Focus. G-Gâ€™ is a finely made bottle with walls
vnly 2 ram. thick, entirely covered with red film, found at
the Sanders Site in Lamar County (Krieger, 1946, Figure
16), but as it is shell-tempered and the fragments are from
the surface, it is probably from a later occupation than
that of Sanders Focus. The frog on one side is spread in
normal swimming position for a frog; that on the other side
has the forelegs in "crawl stroke" position. D, E, are redfilmed (Moore, 1909, Plates I, VII) but no other details are
available.

FULTON ASPECT RATTLE BOWLS AND NODED BOWLS
(Plate 24)
GENERAL NOTES
Like the effigy bowls and other effigy vessels of Fulton Aspect
(,Plates 22, 23), the principal of a rattle made of pottery
is also very widespread, occurring in nearly every focus
of this Aspect. Four knobs protrude from the sides of
small bowls, either of simple hemispherical shape (F) or
with convex sides, the mouth being smaller than the body
diameter (A-D). These knobs are hollow and each contains one or more small pebbles, producing a harsh rattling
noise when shaken. In the Texarkana and Belcher Foci
some of these bowls have four long legs which rest on a
ring or hollow square of clay (A, C). The bowls themselves are entirely covered with pinched-up ridges of clay
(F), tiny nodes stuck on the surface (B, D), applique fillets (C), or grooves made in the plastic clay (A); whatever the body decoration, it commonly covers the four
knobs as well.
Apparently wherever
vessels are found
the four legs, but
Texarkana Focus,

rattle bowls occur, similar or identical
which have the pinches, nodes, or e,~en
no rattles (E, G-J). In one case, from
the nodes are in panels alternated with

a herringbone incised design (J).
In several instances, squeezed lumps of a dense greenish clay,
or lumps of red ochre, have been found inside rattle bowls
and.simple noded bowls as well. Pro~ably they served a
definite function in ceremonies.

PASTE
See description of type Belcher Engraved except that shell
temper is very rare in vessels definitely of the GIassell
type. Shell temper is abundant in such vessels as D and N
but these are from the Keno site in northeastern Louisiana
(~:Moore, 1909) and need not belong in this group.
Wall thickness: 3 to 5 ram.
Lip: Usually thickened with a strip of clay attached to outer
edge, which sometimes splits off (K); otherwise, thin,
wedge-like (~M).
Base: Convex on bowls, slightly convex to flat on bottles.
Vessel shape and size: Carinated bowls with rim slightly concave and slanted inward; bottles with globular bodies and
spouts usually long and swelling, n,ea,r, mid,d~le,, bu~t sp,out,s
may also be larger at top than at oo~om
(N) is aberrant. Bowls up to 27 cm. across; bottles up to
20 cm. high.
DECORATION
Treatment: Engraving.
Designs: On bowls such as G, H, J-M the pattern is rectilinear
and repeated four times. A ticked or spurred line runs
horizontally through center of blank space and either ends
against an arc placed vertically, or makes a step up or
down and runs through another such blank space. On
bowls J-M each of the four design units includes five
panels, three in upper part and two in lower, or vice versa,
each bisected by a spurred line. Arched lines placed back
to back vertically provide "dividing elements" between
panels and between the four major units of design. Bottles
have various combinations of curved lines and circles in
which principal diagnostic feature is common use of very
narrow "ladders:â€™ or paratilel ~s with closely, spaced
y narrow hatched and
cross-lines (A-A, B-B, F, ).
cross-hatched bands are also used (C). Red pigment occurs in designs.

CULTU/~AL A~FILIATIOI~S
Essentially a Belcher Focus type but also occurs in thicker and
less well-made vessels in eastern components of Titus Focus. Possibly survives into Glendora Focus with vessels
like D and N but more research required to determine
range of shapes, designs, and tempering material.
DL~TRIB~TION
Red River valley of northwestern Louisiana, extending westward into Harrison and perhaps other counties in northeast
Texas, and southwestern corner of Arkansas.
ESTIMATED AGE
Same as Belcher Engraved.
Webb and Dodd, 1941, p. 91 and Plate 15, No. 4, considered this
to be "subtype C" of the type Belcher Engraved; Webb and
Kxieger now consider it distinct.

rim (G). Also large, high con]pound bowls (inturned
shoulder area and outflaring rim) with two broad handles.
DECORATION
Treatment: Engraving.
Designs: Gracefully arranged scrolls, doubled-back meanders,
or vertical panels, consisting of very fine lines in parallel
sets (A-C, F, G), or more open work with individual lines
and tightly packed sets which appear almost like excising
D, E). Slanting ticks and spurs appear commonly in opposed pairs (on different lines, running close together),
either as the principal element in the scroll (D) or as a
bordering element in any of several ways; ticks also occur
along single lines as bordering elements (G). Design units
repeated two, three, or four times. Red and white pigments occur in lines.
CULTURAL AFFILIATIONS
A Haley Focus type, occurring in other units only as trade
ware. Reported from "Late Component" at Spiro Site,
Oklahoma (Orr, 1946, Fig. 32, C) and Sanders Site, Lamar
County (Krieger, 1946, Fig. 15).

HALEY COMPLICATED INCISED
(Plate 27)
PASTE
Temper: Clay-grit.
Texture: Usually coarse, somewhat crumbly: occasionally finer
and firmer.
Color: Shades of brown and gray-brown from light to dark;
cores darker than surfaces.
Surface finish: Entirely covered with decoration.
FORM
Wall thickness: 4 to 9 mm.
Lip: Rounded, turned outward slightly.
~Base: Flat disk to which body wall was attached.
Vessel shape and size: Consists entirely of small jars, about
10 to 25 cm. high; some rims outfla,~ing (D, E, G, I), others
high and more or less cylindrical ~ ith two very wide strap
handles (A, B, C, F, H). Rims raised into four prominent
peaks fairly common, either with or without strap handles.

DECORATION
Treatment: Applique, incising, punctating.
Designs: Concentric circles, scrolls, and parallel diagonal lines
set in a wide variety of arrangements. Small areas flanking
main design units may be filled with stick punctates or
parallel lines, or both (B, C, E, H, I); or sets of fine diagonal or spiral lines may be alternated with single rows of
fingernail punctates (A, D). Some vessels have applique
fillets running vertically,â€™ diagonally, or both (A-D, F, G),
the fillets usually being notched or punctated along the
top. Strap handles are covered with same decoration as on
,body. Some jars with high rims have horizonal row of
punctates about midway., rising into punctate-filled triangles below the four rim peaks (B, C). Lips are often
notched along outer edge (B-E, G, I).
CULTURAL AP~ILIATIONS
A Haley Focus type. Its closest relative is Pease Brushed-Incised of Bossier Focus (Plate 53), which employs the same
techniques, covering the whole vessel body and rim, but
is simpler, lacks handles, and is believed to have been a
somewhat later type. When single rows of fingernail or
stick punctates are found between incised lines, this type
resembles Handy Engraved in design conception (Plate 26,
H-M).

Adjoining corners of Texas, Arkansas, and Louisiana. centered
around great bend of Red River.

Texture: Compact, fairly coarse.
Color: Surface cream, buff, shades of gray and brown. Considerable fire-mottling with spots dark gray to black.
Cores gray to black.
Surface finish: Interiors poorly smoothed; exteriors same except where fillets applied.
FORM
Wall thickness: 4 to 9 ram.
Lip: Rounded, turned outward.
Base: Usually a thick, flat, round disk to which wall attached;
sometimes convex or slightly flattened and no thicker

Vessel shape and size: Jars only, usually small, 10 to 15 cm.
high, but some 25 cm. or more. Rims high in relation to
body, curve outward so mouth diameter usually at least as
great as that of body and sometimes slightly greater. Rim
may meet body at definite angle (D, H) but usually merges
with it gradually. Pulling of rim into four raised peaks is
common; when strap handles are present there are two attached to opposite rim peaks (B); when lugs are present
there are four, one at each rim peak (A, G).
DECORATION
Treatment: Applique, incising, brushing, punctating.
Designs: Scrolls, chevrons, panels of vertical lines, concentric
diamonds, etc., formed with appliqued fillets on body; may
cover whole body or upper part. Design unit always repeated four times and aligned under rim peaks if present.
Fillets often punctated (A, B, E, F). Rims plain (G, D),
punctated in more or less regular rows (E, G), incised
with vertical lines (A, B), or brushed horizonally
Spaces between fillets occasionally brushed (H). Applique
knob may appear in center of design units (~B, E). Handles
and lugs may be molded into ridged ornamental patterns.

FORM
~rall thickness: Range 4 to 6 mm., average 5 mm.
Lip: Thin, rounded, may be turned outward slightly.
Base: Some bottoms convex and not distinguishable from side
wall; others slightly convex or flat but of same thickness
as side wall.
Vessel shape and size: Small bottles as shown, height 12 to 25
cm., neck vertical or tapered inward slightly, then expanding again at mouth. Some have angular shoulder near bottom. Other vessel forms may be added to type with further study.
DECORATION
Treatment:

Engraving and applique.

Designs: Body divided into oval or elliptical panels, almost
always four in number. Each panel half usually contains
a set of parallel arcs curved in same direction as sides of
panel, or in opposite direction. Vertical lines separate
panels. Rows of small applique nodes or low fillets sometimes extend part way down body from base of spout;
these are polished like the vessel surface and are difficult
to see (A, B, I). The nodes may be just above the center
of each panel or on the lines separating the panels. In one
case (F) there are two such rows in the center of each
panel. Two or three horizontal lines form an upper margin
to the design but the bottom is usually left open. If the
body is globular the design covers all but the base; where
an angular shoulder is present the design extends only.as
far downward as the shoulder (A, G, I). Red ochre .pigment common in engraved lines; white pigment occasionally seen.

AFFJ~LIATIONS
Like Barkman E,~graved, this type belongs exclusive}y to Texarkana Focus. The relationships in this case, however, are
more with the type Friendship Engraved (Plate 21) of MidOuaehita Focus in Arkansas, which includes bo~t]es with
similar small nodes and ridges just below spout and designs of arched lines in some cases.

CULT~ ~I/kTIONS
Well established type in Alto, Gahagan, Haley, and Spiro Foci
of Gibson Aspect. Area of greatest frequency remains to

(Plates 34, 35) of Alto and Gahagan Foci on the one hand,
and to Spiro Engraved (,Plate 64) on the other; i. e., it occurs in association with both these types but was spread
over a larger area than either of them. The encircling
horizontal lines of Hickory are like those found above the
body designs of both Holly and Spiro Engraved. Specimens
shown in Plate 31 are all from Haley Focus components in

PASTE
Temper: Usually none; sometimes fine clay-grit or small

Texture: Fine, compact.
Color: Shades of brown, gray, gray-brown, and reddish brown
from light to dark and nearly black. Best vessels uniformly
dark but fire-mottling sometimes has pleasing effect
(Plates 32, F, I-t, N; 33, E, N). Soft red film, probably applied after firing, occurs occasionally on Texas specimens
i(Plate 33, A, L) but unknown so far in other states. Cores
lighter than surface and contrast strongly with it on darker
vessels.
~Surface finish: Fair to good polish.
FORM
Wall thickness: 2 to 5 mm.
Lip: Rounded and turned outward; occasionally flush with rim.
Base: Usually convex; occasionally flat on both bowls and
bottles but no thicker than side walls.
Vessel shape and size: Bottles with spool-shaped spouts, both
~long and short (Plates 32, A, C, D, L, N; 33, I, J, M-4VIâ€™, O) ;
tripod bottles with legs hollow and expanded at feet (Plate
32, B) or long and tapered (Plate 33, F) ; effigy bottle with
spout oH-center and side molded into human face (,Plate
32, G); bottles with lower and upper chambers (Plates 32,
M; 33, K); olla-like vessels with globular to drop-shaped
bodies and small mouths with low necks (Plates 32, E, H;
33, N); simple globular bowls with two vertically-perforated lugs just below lip (Plate 32, F) ; simple conical bowls
(Plate 32, O); carinated bowls with rim slanted inward
(Plates 32, I, J; 33, B, D, G, H) ; small bowl with rim curved
sharply outward (Plate 32, K); globular bowl with short
rim rising vertically, then curved outward, and four small
suspension holes on opposite sides (Plate 33, A) ; vase-like
vessels with small globular bodies and rim either cylindrical (Plate 33, E) or gently curving.outward (Plate 33,
C); deep bowls with rim gently curving outward (Plate

DECORATION
Treatment: Engraving, punctating.
Designs: Featured principally by negative meandering sarolls
which double back sharply. The place of doubling back
may be pinched to a narrow neck from which the scroll
swells on either side (Plates 32, A; 33, C, L). The scroll
band may or may not have a ticked line in its center; the
flanks are formed by cross-hatching and blank disks of
various sizes are left within the cross-hatched areas. Large

(Plates 32, A, H; 33, I).

Single scroll arms may be used

without a continuous meander around vessel (Plates 32, G,
I, O; 33, F, I). Cross-hatched bands may be used as scrolls
themselves, with the spaces between them blank (Plate 32,
D, F). Bottle and jar bodies provide the largest space and
therefore the freest designs. On carinated bowl rims the
same doubled-back scrolls are squeezed into narrow horizontal zones, but with pleasing effect. Designs are almost
always repeated four times, the exceptions being tripod
bottles and effigies. Some carinated bowl rims appear to
bear eight slanting scrolls but these are really four, each
double. Both red and white pigments appear in lines, but
cores contrast without this.
CULTURAL ~IATIONS
Principally a Mid-Ouachita Focus type but also well established in Belcher and Texarkana Foci, and occurs occasionally in Titus Focus either as resident or trade ware.
Probably the handsomest of all Caddoan pottery, some
vessels being among the most striking achievements of any
American Indian potters. Plates 32, 33 show range of form
and workmanship rather than finest pieces; those in Plate
32 from Arkansas, in Plate 33 from Louisiana and Texas.
Some differences in vessel form apparent in these states
but scroll motif follows same essential principals; red film
known so far only in Texas (Plate 33, A, L). Mear~s
Engraved of l~Iid-Ouachita Focus is closely related type
(Plate 47) and some vessels may be difficult to classify in
one type or the other (e. g., Plate 32, D) ; however, Means
not known as resident type outside of Arkansas. Hodges
may at times also be confused with Natchitoches Engraved
of historic Glendora Focus and the doubled-back scrolls
may occasionally be identical (Plate 51, A-C). The scrolls of
Natchitoches are generally more complex, their flanks being filled with smaller scrolls; vessel forms are distinct on
the whole, running more to carinated bowls with flaring
rims; and shell temper is common in it while absent in
Hodges. The scrolls of Ripley Engraved of Titus Focus
(Plates 57-59) are also similar but simpler and cruder and
vessel forms again differ. Both Hodges and Ripley may be
regarded as ancestors of historic Natchitoches Engraved.
The forked-eye symbol (Plate 32, G) is a lingering element
of "Southern Cult" ceremonialism.

DISTRIBUTION
Southwest Arkansas, northwest corner of Louisiana, and northeast Texas as far west as Upshur County. Not definitely

HOLLY FINE ENGRAVED
(Plates 34, 35)
PASTE
Temper: Clay-grit, sometimes with added particles of carbonized material or bone, sometimes with no visible temper or
a little fine sand.
Texture: Usually fine but ranges to fairly coarse and somewhat lumpy.
Color: Usually rich dark brown, reddish brown, and graybrown, ranging to black. Occasionally pale gray or even
cream. Cores dark gray or brown, occasionally with reddish or greenish tinges.
Surface finish: From well smoothed to fair polish except that
interiors of bottles unsmoothed.

Wall thickness: Extreme range 3 to 9 mm., most specimens 4
or 5 mm.
:Lip: Usually rounded and flush with rim, but greatly widened
and flat lips occur on carinated and simple bowls (Plate
34, B, E, I); thick, cambered lips (two convex surfaces
meeting in a sharp ridge) occur on a few bowls, and some
carinated bowls have scalloped flange bent outward at
right angle to rim (Plate 34, G). Diagonal grooves across
thickened lip and into interior of vessel give rope-like
effect (Plate 34, C, D).
Base: Convex on bowls and most bottles; flat on some bottles
and upright vessels (Plate 35, E, F). Always of same
thickness as side walls.
Vessel shape and size: Carinated bowls most common, diameter 15 to 40 cm. or more (Plates 34, A, C, E, G; 35, A, B).
Bottles also common, body being small and globular or
rounded on upper part and sides straight on lower part
(Plate 35, E, G); spouts probably always well tapered.
Bottle bodies may meet spout at sharp angle or merge
gently in long curve (not illustrated). Sherds show other
~ottles with horizontal ledge around base of spout, 2 or 3
cm. wide. Simple bowls up to 40 cm. in diameter (Plate
34, D, I) ; small jars with vertical rim (Plate 34, F) ; deep
bowls with more or less vertical rim (Plates 34, B; 35, C);
and peculiar flat bowl with small mouth (Plate 35, D) constitute other :~orms.

DECORATION
Treatment: Very finely engraved lines set close together; excising; lip notching.
Designs: Bowls and jars usually have design confined to rim
or narrow zone near top equivalent to rim, consisting o~
fine engraved lines in sets running alternately vertically
and diagonally--i, e., parallel with one another and with
one side and hypothenuse, respectively, of right triangles
formed by excising, as shown clearly by specimens in
Plate 34. A few variations may be seen, such as concentric
quarter-circles in place of diagonals, a small pit being ex-

cised at their center (Plate 34, F, H); or sets of straight
lines in three directions, parallel to all three sides of small
excised triangles (Plate 34, D). Inclined scrolls with excised cores and longitudinal bisecting lines, similar to those
of Crockett Curvilinear Incised (Plates 14-16) except for
the technique, are tentatively included in Holly type (Plate
35, D). Bottles have a few encircling lines at top of spout,
the lowest line often deeper than others, and other such
lines at top of body; remainder of body covered with very
fine lines in full concentric circles or spirals, and areas between these filled with parallel straight lines running at
different angles. The cores of these sets of circles are excise~, as are the corners of squares made around the outermost circles. Bowl lips greatly widened and flat have zigzags and meanders along top of lip, formed by excising.
Main design units repeated four times on bottles and cups
(Plate 35, E-G), but on bowls any number used that fits
space, from five or six to 15 or more. Red pigment common
in lines and excised areasi no other colors noted.

CULTURAL ~IATIONS
A common Alto Focus type, also occurring in small numbers in
Gahagan Focus, both of Gibson Aspect. Designs closely
resemble those of Spiro Focus in eastern Oklahoma, but
Holly lines closer together, designs generally lack punctated circles in center of design units and spiral common
in Spiro type, and the vessel forms (except for bottles with
tapered spout) are quite distinct in the two types (see
Newell and Krieger, 1949, pp. 200-201 for discussion). In
intermediate area, as around great bend of Red River, it is
sometimes difficult to classify vessels as Holly or Spiro
Fine Engraved, particularly bottles. Plate 35, A-F, are
from Crenshaw mound excavations of Judge Harry J. Lemley and belong to a component which is primarily Alto
Focus; the small bowl with three molded animal heads on
rim (C) is only instance of effigy work known in Holly
type or in whole Alto Focus complex, and probably is due
to an outside influence. Plate 35, G is from C. B. Mooreâ€™s
excavations at Gahagan mound, on Red River in Louisiana
Moore, 1912) and illustrates typical bottle form and decoration in this type. All specimens in Plate 34 from Alto
mound site in Cherokee County, Texas; further illustrations and variations occur in Newell and Krieger, 1949.

DISTRIBIZIâ€™ION
Central part of East Texas is area of concentration, but examples found westward to Chupek site on Brazos River in
central Texas, in northwest Louisiana, and northward to
Red â€™River valley in Texas and southwest Arkansas. May
occur more widely as trade ware.
EST]RVIATED AGE
Some part of span 500-1000 A. D.

HUDSON
(Plate 36)
PASTE
Temper:

Finely pulverized shell, small amount of sand, or

none,
Texture: Fine. Full of tiny cavities where shell leached out.
Color: Cream, various shades of gray, gray-brown, reddishbrown from light to dark, Cores lighter than or about
same as surface,
Surface finish: Smoothed to poor polish; occasionally well
polished,
FORM
Wall thickness: 2 to 5 mm.
Lip: Rounded and turned sha,,rply outward.
,Base: Convex or nearly flat; extended base" fairly common.
Vessel shape and size: Principally bottles in wide variety of
shapes from globular to squat. Spouts usually spool-shaped
but may be very high like A. Olla-like vessels with small
mouths may have plain convex base (E) or "extended
base" (G, I). Vessel forms like A, F-I are peculiar in Caddoan archeo!ogy and B-D included only tentatively on
basis of design. Range of forms to be revised ~vith further
study.

DECORATION
Treatment: ]Engraving, small amount of incising and puncrating.
Designs: Primarily narrow cross-hatched bands in curvilinear
patterns. The hatching is exceedingly fine in some cases
(A, E, F, H) and may be supplemented by rows of fine punctares as borderlines (E, H). Vessels B-D have scroll bands
which appear to have been incised before firing, then
whole vessel polished afterward. Major units usually repeated four times. Red pigment may occur in lines.
CULTU~RAL A~IATIONS
Most specimens come from historic sites (A, E, F-J) and probably belong to Glendora Focus. Others from prehistoric
sites (D) or association unknown (B, C). The type is tentative and established so far mainly as a counterpart of
Maddox Engraved of Bossier Focus (Plate 44). The content of the latter has been considerably confused and it
now considered to be entirely non-shell-tempered, definitely pre-European in age, and probably belonging to an
early phase of Fulton Aspect. While the finely crosshatched ,bands of Hudson Engraved are much like those of
Maddox, the former is easily distinguished ~y its shell temper and different range of shapes, and it is later in time.
Vessel D has four scroll arms descending from base of neck,
alternating with four areas bending upward which resemble bird heads, with blank disk in body and another in
position of eye. This conventionalized bird is very similar
to the common bird on Marksville pottery but a direct relationship appears impossible; the vessel is heavily shelltempered and the shape completely un-Marksvillian.
DI~T~IBUTION
Mainly northeastern Louisiana and lower Arkansas River valley, so far as known from illustrations of C. B. Moore (190~,
1909). Specimens A-C from Red River and Upshur Counties, northeast Texas and may be trade pieces of Hudson or
some other type not yet recognized.

KARNACK BI~UScI-IED - INCISED
(Plate 38)

PASTE
Temper: Clay-grit; occasionally pulverized hone.
Texture: Fine to coarse.
Color: Surfaces cream to shades of gray and brown to nearly
black. Much fire-mottling. Cores like surface or darker.
Surface finish: Interiors poorly smoothed: exteriors roughened
by decoration.
Wall thickness: 4 to 7 ram.
Lip: Rounded, turned outward.
Base: Convex or small flat area; vessels do not stand up well.
Vessel shape and size: Bodies barrel-shaped, rims low and
turned outward sharply (A-C, E) or somewhat higher and
turned outward less sharply (D, F).
DF,CORATION
Treatment: Incising, brushing.
Designs: Incised lines (made individually) or brushed marks
(made with grass?) run vertically or nearly so over whole
body. Rim exterior has incised lines running vertically (B,
D) or diagonally (A, E), or brushed lines (F) horizontally
all the way around. Plain rim (C) unusual.
CULTURA~ AFFILI~.TIONS
Titus Focus, especially components with mixed Titus and
Belcher Focus pottery, but only one vessel (C) from
Belcher site. Closely related to Belcher Ridged (Plate 6)
in vessel form; decoration probably imitation of peculiar
ridging technique in latter. Webb (1948) includes such
vessels in type Maddox Brushed and compares the brushed
lines in irregular, vertical, horizontal, or herringbone patterns, and appliqued nodes and ridges, between Maddox
and Pease Brushed-Incised. It is suggested that such vessels in the Maddox type should simply be included in the
Pease type (Plate 53) and that vessels like those illustrated
in Plate 38 should be assigned to Karnack Brushed-Incised.
These vessels are not merely variations of Belcher Ridged,
for where they occur, the distinctive ridging of the latter
is very rare, and vice versa. Belcher Ridged furthermore
occurs in both Belcher and the earlier Bossier Focus, while
Karnack appears to be confined to the Titus Focus period,
contemporary with Belcher Focus; workmanship is much
cruder and rims show more variety than those of Belcher
Ridged. Webb further notes the peculiar use of brushing
in the much earlier Tchefuncte complex of Louisiana, its
absence in Marksville, Troyville, and Coles Creek, and its
"reappearance" in Bossier Focus, various loci of Fulton
Aspect, and Plaquemine in central Louisiana.

KENO TRAILED
(Plate 39)
PASTE
Temper: Finely pulverized shell, fine sand; or none visible.
Texture: Fine, very compact.
Color: Principally shades of gray from medium to dark; also
shades of gray-brown. Cores the same or lighter.
Surface finish: Exteriors smoothed to polished, over decoration as well. Interiors of bottles (nearly the only form)
not smoothed.
Wall thickness: 2 to 4 mm.
Lip: Rounded, turned outward; may be flush on bowls.
Base: Usually convex, but flat "extended base" fairly common (A, B, E, G, J, K, M).
Vessel shape and size: Primarily bottles, many quite large
with bodies up to 25 cm. in diameter and short necks or
spouts. Spouts usually spool-shaped, swollen in middle,
but may be cylindrical with lip turned sharply outward
(.L, J). Globular bow! with two opposed lugs (F) is only
other form recognized so far.
DECORATION
Treatment: Trailing (incising .broad lines with blunt in~rument), supplemented by a little engraving and applique.
Designs: Endless combinations of straight and curved parallel
lines fitted close together to cover nearly entire body.
Motifs include scrolls, simple or doubled back on one another, spirals, guilloches, meanders,, concentric circles, and
arcs fitted into areas between major units. Effigy faces
created with small applique nodes (K). Major units usually repeated either two or four times.
CUX,TURAL AFFILIATIONS
Occurs in four loci: Historic Glendora; prehistoric Mid-Ouachita, Texarkana, and Titus, being the least frequent in
Titus. A distinct division noted in width of lines, the narrowest and finest coming from northeast Louisiana (A-E).
Those from Greer site in eastern Arkansas have broader
lines and somewhat simpler designs (F-I), which is also
true of those from southwest Arkansas (J-L) and northeast
Texas (M). Shell temper occurs in some specimens from
historic as well as prehistoric sites in both northern Louisiana and southern Arkansas; farther west, shell temper
is absent. Apparently the type flourished both before and
after the earliest European contacts but it needs to be analyzed more in specific associations. The trailing technique
seems to â€™be related to that in type Foster Trailed-Inc~sed
(;Plate 20) of the prehistoric Belcher and Texarkana Foci.
DISTRIBIYrlON
Across northern Louisiana to lower Ouaehita River (Glendora
and Keno sites; Moore, 1909); across southern Arkansas to
lower Arkansas River (Douglas and Greer sites; Moore,
1998); and westward into northeast Texas as far as Hopkins County.

(Plate 40)
PASTE
Same as Dunkin Incised (Plate 18).
FOI~M
Wall thickness: 4 to 10 mm., average 6 or 7 mm.
Lip: Rounded. flush with rim.
Base: Flat disk to which body wall attached.
Vessel shape and size: Primarily jars with rims vertical to
everted (A, B, D, E), from only about 10 cm. high to as
much 50 cm. or more; the latter are fairly numerous and
may be regarded as storage jars. Probably some cylindrical
vessels and similar ones with rims gently outcurved (C)
should be included, although these would be distinguished
from Dunkin Incised only on the basis of designs.
DECORATION
Treatment: Incising; fingernail punctating; rarely stick-punctating.
Designs: Horizontal lines encircle the rim area of all vessels;
rather crudely done, lines do not "overhang". Bodies occasionally plain but usually have either vertical incised
lines closely spaced as on the rims (A, D), or fingernail
unctations more or less arranged in horizontal rows (C,
). Rarely, stick punctates cover the body (B), some of
which are angular as though done with the corner of a
square implement. Appendages absent.

~

CULTURAL AFFILIATIONS
An Alto Focus type which may also belong to ,Bossier and Haley
Foci. It appears to be one of the few specific types which
survives from the Gibson Aspect into Fulton Aspect. Very
similar to type Hardy Incised of central Louisiana, differing mainly in coarser paste and greater use of body punctating, also jars rather than barrel-shaped vessels.
DISTRIBUTION
Central part of East Texas, also occurring sporadically in northeast part, and at Crenshaw and East mound sites in southwest Arkansas. A close comparison needed to determine
its distribution in Louisiana in relation to Hardy Incised,
Dunkin Incised, and Coles Creek Incised, all of which may
have been mis-identified in some cases in available literature.
ESTIMATED AGE
Some part of span 500-1000 A. D. but probably farther toward
the end of span than most Alto Focus types, and may have
continued to 1200 A. D. or so.
REFE~RENCES
Newell and Krieger, 1949, pp. 1t0-116, Figs. 42 B, F; 43,
included this material in type Dunkin Inc~sed, but it is here
separated again as in Newellâ€™s original analysis; he distinguished between the pottery with sets of parallel lines
in both diagonal and horizontal arrangements (Dunkin
Incised) and those with only horizontal lines on rims and
vertical lines or punctates on bodies (Kiarn Incised).
Krieger, 1946, Fig. 19 referred to the latter as ".I-Iardy Incised" but this was withdrawn in 1949.

KILLOUGH PINCHED
(Plate 41)

PASTE
Temper: Clay-grit: occasionally pulverized bone or potsherds.
Texture: Coarse but not crumbly.
Color: Surfaces cream, buff, shades of brown and gray-brown.
Cores somewhat darker than surface. Some fire-mottling.
Surface finish: Interiors poorly smoothed; exteriors completely pinched.
Wall thickness: 5 to 8 ram.
Lip: Rounded to slightly flattened; flush or turned outward
slightly.
Base: Round, flat disk or slightly convex and only slightly
thicker than sides.
Vessel shape and size: Principally small jars with rim vertical
to everted, and set at slight angle to body or merged gen.tly
with it. Several of these have four legs resting on a ring
base and two opposed strap handles (A-C); others have
two strap handles or solid lugs (~-I, J). SimI~le bowls usually have four hollow knobs attached to side, in which
are pebbles which rattle. More elongate jars occur without appendages (F, G), and bottles are known but rare (I).

DECOR~TION
Treatment: Pinching and fingernail impressiorm placed end-toend.
Designs: Spirals and concentric circles in sets repeated four
times (A-C, G, H, J); nodes pinched up at random (D,
E); and pinched ridges running vertically on body (F, I).
Vertical or horizontal ridges appear on rims, legs, and
handles no matter what the body designs are. Entire exterior surface commonly covered except for bottle necks.
CUL~ AFF]~LIATIONS
Primarily a Frankston Focus type but appears occasionally in
Titus Focus components. One example (I) appears in historic Allen Focus, but this bottle is not characteristic of the
type either.
DISTRIBUTION
Principally in drainage areas of Neches and upper Sabine Rivers, but a few specimens as far east as Morris County. Apparently not traded much to tribes west of the Caddoan
region, as compared with other Frankston Focus types.

ESTI~IATED AGE
1200-1500 A. D., with survival as late as 1â€™/00 A. D. possible.

and often wider (A, C-F). More globular body with smaller mouth (~B) unusual. Height usually 15 to 30 cm., but
some vessels have capacity of several gallons, height of 40
cm. or more and correspondingly wide mou[hs (E). Largest
vessels perhaps for storage rather than cooking.
DECORA~ON
Treatment: Neck banding (crimping of neck coils), brushing,
applique.
,Designs: Each coil added to neck or rim of vessel was pinched
on to prec~d~g coil at fairly regular intervals and the resulting cramps not smoothed over. Such coils vary from
four to eight in number. Bodies pla~ (E, F), brushed vertically (A, C, D), or pla~ with appliqued fillets in simple
arrangements (~B).
C~~ ~LIATIONS
Frankston and Titus Foci. Very similar to type ~ren Neck
Banded of Alto Focus (not illustrated) but latter never
brushing or applique work, the bodies being plain or
covered with fingernail p~ctations. La Rue is also related
to Nash Neck Banded of Texarkana and M~urta~ Foci
(Plate 50), but the neck crimping is much cruder, ~e vessels much l~ger on the average, and shell tem~r~g
unsown in it. The three types provide a special development within the Caddo~ archeologica! region, for which
an influence from the Puebloan culture of the Southwest
has been postulated (Krieger, 1946, pp. 237-241). ~ the
Caddoan area, crimping of coils is always confined to the
vessel rim.

McKINNEY PLAIN
(Plate 43)
PASTE
Teinper:
Clay-grit: rarely, pulverized shell (specimen J).
Pulverized bone particles appear occasionally as additions
to clay-grit.
Texture: Granular, small to medium-sized particles; harder
than most pottery in Caddoan area (about 3.0). Sherds do
not crumble.
Color: Shades of light, medium, and dark brown, and grayish
browns. Core and surface colors frequently same or core
slightly darker.
Surface finish:
Interiors smoothed; body exteriors usually
poorly smoothed but occasionally brought to polish; rim
exteriors purposely roughened.
Wall thickness: Range 4 to 12 mm., average 6 to 8 mm.
Lip: Rounded, may be flush Or bent outward slightly.
~Base: Flat to slightly convex; bumpy; only slightly thicker
than side wall, if at all.
Vessel shape and size: Jars only; rim flares outward and may
be joined to body at rather sharp angle (C, E, F, J), or
very gently merged with it (A, B, D). Mouth diameter
usually at least as great as that of body, often greater. Size
ranges from very small, almost miniature vessels (C) to
jars at least 30 cm. high (I); sherds indicate still larger
vessels and one with a rma over 20 cm. high.

I)]~CORATION
Treatment: Applique, intentional roughening, and (rarely)
punctation.
Designs: Quadration of vessel affected by appliqued nodes on
rim, fillets on body, or by fillets on both rim and body (A,
B, F, H, I). Occasionally lip lifted into four peaks (B). A
row of diagonal punctates or slashes may appear at base of
rim (J). Rims almost always roughened and bumpy and
contrast with bodies when latter are smoothed. Bodies occasionally roughened also, having scoured or faintly brushed appearance (I) although never as complete or regular
as on vessels classified as "brushed".
CU~LTUR.AL A_FFILIArrIONS
A Texarkana Focus type, virtually unknown in other complexes. Might be expected to appear in McCurtain Focus
components nearby but has not been reported as a deftnite trait there.

PASTE
Temper: Usually clay-grit, rarely pulverized bone.
Texture: Fine to somewhat granular; soft, friable.
Color: Surfaces usually cream to pale brown, but dark brown,
reddish bro~vn, dark gray and black also occur. Cores
darker than surface.
Surface finish: Both exterior and interior smoothed but rarely
polished.
Wall thickness: About 3 to 6 mm.
Lip: Flat to rounded. In one case (F) thickened and circular
in cross-section.
Base: On bowls, convex and not distinct from side wall; on
bottles and barrel-shaped vessels, tends to be flatter but
still convex.
Vessel shape and size: Small simple bowls, maximum diameter
15 to 23 cm.; small barrel-shaped vessels, greatest diameter
below midsection; bottles, with tapered spout in some
cases; a human effigy.
DECORATION
Treatment: Engraving only.
Designs: Narrow bands filled with cross-hatching or hachure,
usually in gracefully arranged curvilinear patterns, sometimes with "flags" or pendants attached to main lines; also
similar bands i~ horizontal panels or encircling upper part
of vessel. Lips may be notched.
CULTURAL AFFILIATIONS
Within the Caddoan area this is primarily a Bossier Focus type
although it may also belong to the Frankston and Belcher
Foci. In central and eastern Louisiana it may belong to the
Plaquemine complex. Concepts as to what constitutes
"Maddox Band Engraved" or "Maddox Engraved" have
changed several times, the greatest confusion being with
what we now call Hudson Engraved of Glendora Focus
(Plate 36). Despite their common possession of narrow
engraved bands filled with cross-hatching, arranged in
curvilinear and horizontal patterns, the two types can now
be clearly distinguished on the basis of tempe.ring material: Maddox Engraved never has shell tempering, while
Hudson Engraved almost always does, and the vessel
shapes are different as seen in the p.resent illustrations.
The definition of Maddox Engraved still requires more research.
DISTRIBUTION
Princi~)ally in central and norther.n. Louisian..a and ~along
isl~aÃ·Texas border, occasionally extenamg as iar wes~ as
Fran~ston Focus area in Neches River valley; unknown so
far in Arkansas and Oklahoma.
ESTIMATED AGE
Within Fulton Aspect times in Caddoan area, probably in earlier part, before Belcher Focus flourished.

MAXEY NODI~D REDWARE
(.Plate 45)

PASTE
Temper: Fine clay-grit and sand in varying proportions.
Texture: Fine to granular; compact.
Color: Basically light to dark grayish-blue, except for thin
layer of buff on exterior under red film. Evidently firing
the vessels after the red-ochre film was applied not only
~baked the film but produced a buff color on the original
outer surface; since all the vessels are bottles, the interiors
were not exposed to as much heat and remained grayish~lue like the remainder of the core.
Surface finish: From well smoothed to good polish on exterior
with marks of smoothing tool producing a finely rippled
surface in some cases; interiors unsmoothed with original
coiling seams still visible.
FORM
Wall thickness: 3 to 6 mm.
Lip: Rounded to somewhat flattened and flush with side of
neck; rarely turned outward
Base: Convex bottoms, not notably thicker than .body wall.
Vessel shape and size: Bottles the only known form. At Sanders Site these are characteristically somewhat elongated,
with greatest diameter be!ow middle and necks ~cylindrical
to somewhat tapered (A-D); heights about 15 to 24 cm.
From same site there is one complete triple bottle, the
bodies connected with horizontal struts, and part of another such bottle. Those from other sites in Texas and
Arkansas (F-I) have bodies more evenly convex from base
to neck.
DECORATION
Treatment: Applique, punctating; surface always red-filmed.
Designs: At Sanders Site, bottles usually have three sets of
small oval nodes running vertically on body, each set consisting of three rows of nodes; variations include two or
four sets, each with two or four rows. In spaces between
nodes, and in band around top of body, are slits or fingernail
punctates set vertically (B, C), but some bottles have no
punctates (A) and others have punctates but no nodes (D).
One triple bottle (E) and part of another have human
faces modeled in low relief at top of each bottle and below
their common spout; they have no nodes but a horizontal
fillet runs around the outer side of each body, end-to-end
with the struts, and two rows of punctates appear at top
of each body below spout. Bottles from other sites (F-I)
tend to have continuous fillets, one to three in a set, vertically or diagonally on body, rather than nodes.

PASTE
Temper: Clay-grit; occasionally pulverized potsherds or bone,
or (very rarely) limestone particles.
Texture: Coarse and somewhat lumpy.
Color: Surfaces from cream to buff, shades of brown and gray.
Cores light brown, gray, black. Much fire mottling with
spots same color as core.
Surface finish: Interiors poorly smoothed; exteriors bumpy,
roughened by brushing or incising.
FORM
Wall thickness: 5 to lq mm.
Lip: Rounded, bent outward; occasionally somewhat flattened.
Base: Round, thick, flat disk to which side wall is attached.
Vessel shape and size: Exclusively jars with prominent rims
meeting body at slight angle; mouths usually at least as
wide as vessel ,body and often wider (B, C, F, G). Jars up
to 30 cm. high are common and some as high as 50 cm~ indicated by sherds; most, however, between 15 and 25 cm.
high. Very large strap handles (2) and thick, crudely
molded lugs (2 or 4) are fairly common on this type in
Frankston Focus components (not shown) but ap.parently
absent on very similar jars from Titus Focus hke those
~shown. Soot and grease stains show cooking function.
DECOP~TION
Treatment: Incising, punctating, brushing.
Designs: Rims decorated with parallel incised lines, in hachures
â€™(A, B, F, G), grids of crossed diagonal lines (C, D), or
diagonals pitched in alternate directions with punctates
filling areas between them (E). A row of fingernail or
stick punctates may appear as borderlines along the top
and bottom of rim design (A, G). Bodies may be plain (B,
D), incised with widely spaced vertical or diagonal lines
(A, E), or ,brushed. The brushing is usually vertical (F)
but may be random (G), and in one case consists of narrow
bands of brush strokes crossing one another diagonally (C).

CLrLTIY/b%~ AFFI~LIATIONS
Frankston and Titus Foci. At one time, two types were defined,
one in the Frankston Focus components which sometimes
had strap handles and lugs, and the other in Titus Focus
which appears never to have such appendages. They are
now considered as one type with the handles and lugs a
variable within it. The rim designs c}osely resemble those
of Canton Incised of Sanders Focus (]?late 10) but the
latter type can be distinguished by its cylindrical jars and
carinated bowls, which never occur in Maydelle Inc{sed;
the Canton bodies, moreover, are always plain.
DIST~,IBUTION
Found widely in northeast Texas in drainage systems of Neches,
Angelina, Sabine, and upper Sulphur Rivers. Traded westward into central and northern Texas among non-ceramic
people, much like Poynor Engraved.

very gracefully executed at times; may be repeated two
times, as on sides of effigy; three times, as on sides of tripod; four times on bottles and bowls; or continuously horizontal without breaks. Bottles sometimes have thickened
area at top of body, divided into four parts by vertical applique fillets (G-I). Tiny applique eyes, nose, lips, ears
form two highly conventionalized faces on opposite sides of

Cores about same.
Surface finish: Smoothed to slightly polished.

FORM
Wall thickness: 4 to 7 mm.
Lip: Rounded, turned outward; may be notched on outer edge.
Base: Convex to flat but not much thicker than side wall.
Vessel shape and size: Jars exclusively, from quite small to
very large, height 6 or 7 cm. to more than 40 cm. Rim
usually forms definite angle with body and curves or slants
outward so mouth diameter is more or less equal to that of
body.
DECORATION
Treatment: Incising, punctating.
Designs: Most common are sets of parallel lines around rim or
body, or both, either horizontal or meandering, or both.
Spaces between these sets of lines are filled with slit or
fingernail punctates set ve~rtically or at right angle to meandering lines (A). The punctates are sometimes so close
together as to give an impression of rocker stamping and
perhaps they were sometimes intended to simulate this
technique. Round punctates made with blunt instrument
also used (~). Diagonal lines and single rows of punctates;
herringbone patterns with one or more rows of punctates
(B, H) and various similar combinations (D, F, G, I) may
belong to type although they are not common.
CULTURAL AFFILIATIONS
A Mid-Ouachita Focus type, particularly common in Clark and
Hot Spring Counties, Arkansas, where best and most regular designs are found (A, E). The typical meandering
lines do not occur in any other focus but the designs that
grade into diagonal lines and horizontal rows of punctates
occur in Texarkana and perhaps other loci.
DISTRIBUTION
Principally in vicinity of Arkadetphia in Clark and Hot Spring
Counties, Arkansas, extending northward to Garland County, Arkansas, with less regularity of design (:B, C-I), and
southward as far as great bend of Red River where mergings into other utility types occur.

FORM
Wall thickness:
Lip:

Base:

Flat, thick disk to which body wall was attached.

Vessel shape and size: So far as known, includes only jars
about 10 to 20 cm. high, rim joining body at shallow angle
and flaring outward slightly; body and mouth diameter
about the same. These jars usually have two opposed loop
handles, upper end attached to lip and one or two peaks
rising above lip (â€™B, C), or two opposed small solid lugs
rising slightly above lip (A).

DECORATION

sampling is small, there appearsâ€™to be a tendency for the
smallest jars (B, C) to be completely covered with such
decoration, and the largest (A) to be decorated around the
upper part, the remainder plain.
CULTURA:L AFFILIATIONS
A Sanders Focus type in Texas. The particular jar shape ~vith
loop handles or lugs, and the set of the punctated lines, are
dis{inctive and not duplicated elsewhere, although K~llough
Pinched of Frankston Focus (Plate ,~1) is similar, and most
Caddoan loci have fingernail punctates of some kind.

DISTRIBUTION
Sanders Focus area from Red River valley in northern Lamar
and Fannin Counties southward to upper Sabine River
valley in Van Zandt County. May occur elsewhere as
trade ware, but difficult to distinguish from similarly
decorated pottery of other Caddoan loci unless shape and
presence of handles or lugs can be ascertained.

NASH NECK BANDED

(Plate 50)
PASTE
Temper: Clay-grit or pulverized shell.
Texture: Compact, granular; porous and soft when shell particles have leached out.
Color: Various shades of brown, gray, and gray-brown; some
light yellow-brown. Mottling due to uneven firing is common. Cores generally darker than surface.
Surface finish: Interiors usually rather well smoothed; exteriors about same.
Wall thickness: Range 3 to 10 mm., average 5 or 6 ram.
Lip: Rounded, bent outward slightly.
Base: Convex on small vessels, flatter on large vessels (I-K).
Vessel shape and size: Occurs only in form of jars. Some
bodies are squat, others g!obular or somewhat elongated.
Raising of rim into four peaks is common, either very pronouncedly (A) or with small lobes rising from rim (;B, C,
F-I). Rims bend outward from slightly (F) to sharply
(A) so that mouths are sometimes broader than bodies.
Loop handles (C), strap handles (H), or lugs ((3), all
fairly common, always four in number. Most vessels 10 to
25 cm. high, but range from 5 or 6 cm. to about 60 cm.
DECORATION
Treatment: Crimping of neck coils, applique, incising, fingernail punctates.
Designs: Type recognized chiefly by rather careful, regular

punctations in unsmoothed neck coils (f:, D, H). Vertical
rows of appliqued nodes or fillets usually occur on rim and
upper body of these vessels, dividing each into four segments; those on rim sometimes in line with those on body,
sometimes equidistant between them. Appliqued chevrons
occur on upper bodies (not shown). Incising as on body
of K is unusual.

CULTDZR~ AFFILIATIONS

Common type in both McCurtain and Texarkana Foci. Specimens J, K from Titus Focus components, where shell temper and careful execution of crimping mark them as trade
pieces. Relationship with LaRue Neck Banded (Plate 4.2)
of Titus and Frankston Foci obvious, but latter type includes only large rough (cooking?) vessels, the neck crimps
are carelessly done, and handles, lugs, applique, rim quadration, and shell temper absent.
DISTRIBUTION

Bowie Counties, Texas. No neck banding of any kind
known to be indigenous to Arkansas or Louisiana.

FOI~M
~Tall thickness; 2 to 4 mm.
Lip: Rounded and usually turned outward.
Base: Convex on bowls, somewhat flatter on bottles.
Vessel shape and size: Principally small carinated bowls of
special form, rim being low, slightly concave, and so attached as to make an almost continuous recurve with body
wall; the mouths are thus considerably wider than the
bodies (D, F, I-K). A similar body may occur with a
higher, more vertical but still concave rim (G). Animaleffigy bowl (B-Bâ€™) and four-legged effigy bottle (C) are
unusual forms. Bottles with large bodies and short, spoolshaped spout fairly common (A, H). Peculiar platter decorated on inner surface has a hollow conical pedestal base
with several large holes in sides (E).
DECORATION
Principally scroll bands, outlined by cross-hatched areas and
with ticked line bisecting each band down middle; bands
may be single arms running outward and curling at end,
S-shaped elements with curl at each end, meanders which
fold back on one another at intervals, or variations of scroll
motif. Cross-hatched flanking areas include blank disks of
different sizes, usually touching the scroll bands. Most
elaborate designs include scrolls of several sizes cleverly
arranged to fill spaces and maintain perfect balance. Rims
have rectilinear designs, usually two panels in which upright lines alternate with horizontal ticked lines. Major
units repeated three, four, or five times, all well represented. ~Vhite and (rarely) red pigments used in lines.
CULTI~AL AFF~IAT~ONS
Confined to Glendora Focus and important diagnostic type for
historic Caddo. One of few Caddoan types with designs on
botton~s of bowls, a trait noted on a few specimens of
Ripley Engraved of Titus Focus (Plate 58, K-O). The latter are s~mpler, however, and the vessels never shell-tempered. The scrolls of Hodges Engraved (~Plates 32, 33) are
on the whole distinct from those of Natchitoches, as are the
vessel forms, but occasionally it would be difficult to classify a vessel as either Hodges or Natchitoches except
through the presence or absence of shell temper. The
bottle forms (A, H) show afffinity with those of type Ken~
Trailed (Plate 39).

Vessel shape and size: Primarily small squat bowls with rims
vertical or slanted slightly inward or outward (A, B, E-J).
Bodies sometimes pushed out into four l~bes (H). Double
vessel (D) consists of one such bowl built on top of another. Also olla-like vessels with larger, globular bodies
and small mouths (K). Carinated bowls common, with
high rim slightly to pronouncedly convex (L). One small
ladle-like vessel (~M). Lugs present on two sides of square
bowl, perforated horizontally (C).

DECORATION
Treatment: Engraving.
Designs:
Usually ticked horizontal lines around rim, body
plain (E, F, J). Concentric circles and spirals on body,
frequently combined with two horizontal lines at top and
bottom of rim; in these cases, design unit usually repeated
three times (A, D, G, I, K, M), occasionally four times
Carinated bowl rims commonly have two large arms curving toward one another from the upper and lower margins,
each arm consisting of two, three, or four parallel lines
(L). These units likewise usually repeated three times,
separated by two sets of arched lines placed back-to-back.
White pigment occurs commonly in lines and ticks, occasionally red ochre pigment. Bottoms of carinated bowls
commonly have brushing running horizontally (L).
CLrLTU~AL ~LIATIONS
Allen Focus exclusively. The squat ,bowls (A, etc.) are similar
to those of the pre~European Frankston Focus type Poynor
Engraved (Plate 55) but they lack the series of oval panels
around the rims of the latter, and the Poynor type has little
if any ticking. The large carinated bowls with convex rims
are again similar to those in the Poynor type but the designs are easily distinguished. Frankston Focus pottery
does not have the sandy feel of Allen Focus polished ware.
DISTRIBUTION
Small area in upper Neches River drainage system, principally
in Cherokee, Anderson, Henderson, and Smith Counties.
~May occur in Nacogdoches, Rusk, and other counties.
Wherever found, it is a "marker type" for the historical
Hasinai or Tejas tribes of the Caddo family.

Lip: Sharply convex to flat but not widened.
Base: Flat, round disk to which wall was attached.
Vessel shape and size: Jars with rim varying considerably in
height and slightly outflaring. Oral diameter usually less
than that of body. Most known specimens between 12 and
24 cm. high; no very large examples or miniature vessels
have ~been noted.
DECORATION
Treatment:
Incising, brushing, applique, and punctation in
various combinations.
Designs: One of consistent characteristics is that entire exterior, except for base, is decorated. Body divided into
panels with vertical appliqued fillets or rows of punctates,
,or punctates made in appliqued fillets; no consistent number of panels which may vary from six to 20 or more.
Panels filled with brushing or parallel incised lines set
diagonally in alternating directions with "herringbone"
effect. Lines often deeper at one end than other. Rim
decoration similar e~cept brushing or incised lines may
run in different directions from those on body. Almost
always there is at least one row of punctates around rim,
made through the brushed or incised lines; often there are
two or three such rows, one just under the lip, one around
the middle of rim, and perhaps one at base of rim.
CIYLTURAL AFF~ IATIOI~S
Primarily associated with Bossier Focus, but may also occur in
Haley Focus and related components. The type appears to
be closely related to Haley Complicated Inc~sed (Plate 27),
but is simpler and lacks the circles and scrolls of this type.
The panels of diagonally-placed lines are similar to Dunkin
Incised of Alto Focus (Plate 18), but the latter type lacks
brushing, applique, and punctating; and cylindrical veso
sels are unknown in the Pease type. In general arrangement of design it is reminiscent of Sinner Linear Punctated
of Bossier Focus (Plate 63).
DIST~Iâ€™BUT,ION
Extreme northeastern edge of Texas and much of northwestern
Louisiana, extending up Red River valley into southwestern corner of Arkansas and possibly farther north.
ESTI2VIATED AGE
Precedes Belcher and Texarkana Foci of Fulton Aspect; may

of Belcher Focus (Webb).

that surfaces poorly to fairly well smoothed, but not polished.
FO]%M
Wall thickness: Range 4 to 9 mm., average 6 or 7 ram.
Lip: About equally divided between rounded and flat, some
of latter sloping to exterior. Some carinated bowls have
greatly widened flat lips, up to 21 mm. wide, most of
widening being on inside rather than outside of rim. One
rim circular in cross-section (E).
Base:
On cylindrical vessels (C) they are flat except for
rounding at edge; on all bowls they are convex and not dif~
ferentiated from body.
Vessel shape and size: Variations of large carinated bowls most
common, diameters up to 40 cm. or more, heights up to 12
cm. or more; rims flat to slightly convex on exterior and
vertical to slanting somewhat outward, as reconstructed
from sherds (A, B, E-G, I, J). A few apparently cylindrical
vessels up to 20 cm. or more in height (C). Two small
bowls with wide, shallow, convex bottoms and high, concave rims, one slanted inward (D), and one outward (H).
Appendages absent.
DECORATION
Treatment:
Incising, punctating, both sometimes smoothed
over.

Designs:

Primarily straight-line motifs consisting of slanting

bands, triangles, diamonds, triangl.es within triangles, and
diamonds within diamonds; on r~ms of carinated bowls,
whole sides of other small bowls, and apparently all but
the extreme tops and bottoms of the cylindrical vessels.
Slanting bands and other figures may be filled either with
punctates or short parallel lines, or these may.be alternated with one another and with plain areas ~n various
combinations. The broad, flat lips may be plain or have
spaced punctate-filled triangles, or bear engraved designs
like those of Holly Fine Engraved. Between Crockett and
Pennington an arbitrary line was drawn, the definitely
curvilinear motifs assigned to the former, and the straightline motifs to the latter. However, a few designs consisting
of gently curved meanders, the flanks filled with puncrates or excised (F, G) could not be easily assigned to
either type. Lines and punctates sometimes have traces of
red-ochre, but more often of a white pigment.
CULTIYRAL AFFILIATIONS
An Alto Focus type found on Louisiana as well as Texas components. Occurs as trade ware as far north as Crenshaw
Site in Miller County, Arkansas. Closely affiliated with
Crockett type in Alto Focus, but unlike the latter, does not
extend into Haley and Spiro Focus as a resident type.
Widened lips and some vessel shapes similar to those of
Holly type.

Coarse but compact.

Color: Surfaces center around light yellowish brown and bu~;
range to cream and to dark reddish bro~vn. Fire mottling
produced gray spots possibly done intentionally at times.
Cores gray.
Surface finish:
From poorly smoothed and bumpy to well

FOI~M
Wall thickness: Range 3 to 8 mm., average 4 to 5 mm.
Lip: Plain, rounded, usually flush with sidewall but occasionally turned outward; notching occurs.
Base: Thick, flat disk to which wall was attached.
Vessel shape and size: Most common form is a squat bowl with
rounded body and rim either vertical or somewhat everted
(Plate 55, B, J) and mouth diameters notably smaller than
those of bodies. These bowls are from 12 to 20 cm. in maximum diameter although miniatures occur as small as 5 cm.
across. In one case such a bowl has four long legs joined
by a clay, ring,at their feet, as in Plate 24, A, C, H, except
that the ring is a rounded square. Carinated bowls are
also common, usually with high rims which slant inward
(Plate 55, A, D-I); the rims may be quite flat but are
usually slightly to strongly convex, and the vessel bodies
also present various degrees of flatness and convexity between rim and base. Bowls such as Plate 55, C, with rim
slanted outward and body of considerably less height than
the rim, are very exceptional. Carinated bowls range in
diameter from 18 to as much as 40 cm. in diameter. Bottles
occur in two varieties: elongated, with short necks hardly
distinguishable from the bodies (Plate 56, A-G) ; and globular with long necks (Plate 56, H-J). The former form is
unique for the entire Caddoan archeological area, while
the latter is more in keeping with bottles occurring in many
other types. In both groups, heights range between 20 and
DEC OR.~TION

Treatment: Engraving, punctating.
Designs: On bowl rims the motifs center around a series of
negative ovals made with concentric lines arched back-to,back; these may be spaced somewhat apart and the area
between them filled with other lines (Plate 55, A), crosshatching or scrolls (.Plate 55, C, D). Punctated areas or
small punctated circles may occur within the ovals (Plate

CM.
PLATE 55

Texas Archeological Society

344

55, G, I). The bottles also show a wide variety of motifs
involving negative ovals and circles, but these may run in
vertical panels (Plate 56, A, E, F) instead of horizontally
as on the bowls. Designs are usually poorly executed, with
little contrast between surface colors and the cores exposed by engraving; red ochre pigment appears occasionally in lines.

C ULrr~ AFF ,ILIATIONS
This type belongs to Frankston Focus, of which it is the best
diagnostic trait. It seems never to have spread into other
loci as manufactured ware although numerous sherds have
been found in central and north-central Texas, where they
appear to have been carried as trade pieces among people
who made no pottery of their own. Bowls of shapes and
designs similar to those on Plate 55 have been found in
graves of the historic Allen Focus, showing that the type
survived until European articles reached eastern Texas; but
these are infrequent and bottles such as those on Plate 56
have not yet appeared in Allen Focus association. The design on Plate 56, D, with reversed S-shaped elements in the
panels, shows influence from the type Ripley Engraved of
Titus Focus. Unlike Titus Focus pottery, in which design
units are almost invariably repeated four times, those of
Poyner Engraved may be repeated only twice (Plate 55, C;
Plate 56, C, E, F, H), three times (Plate 56, A), four times
(Plate 55, G; Plate 56, D, J), or any number up to a dozen
or more. In this respect, Poyner Engraved appears to bear
a relationship with several Alto Focus types which existed in the same general area at an earlier time; in that
complex, designs (whether incised or engraved) were also
repeated with whatever frequency best fitted the rim, yet
in design motifs there is hardly any resemblance between
Alto and Frankston Focus.
DISTRIBUTION
Neches River valley in eastern Texas, from headwaters to junction with Angelina River. Carried westward, probably as
trade ware, to Colorado River valley of central Texas and
northwestward to Dallas County or perhaps farther. Some
components known in Smith and Van Zandt Counties in
upper Sabine River valley. Despite relatively poor quality
it appears to have been the most widely traded Caddoan
pottery among tribes living west of the Caddo.

ESTI~CIATED AGE
1200-1600 A. D., surviving infrequently until perhaps 1700 A. D.

I~IPLEY ENGRAVED
(Plates 57-59)
PASTE
Temper: Fine clay-grit: occasionally pulverized white or gray
kaolin.
Texture: Compact and firm in some vessels, grading to coarse
and crumbly in others.
Color: Various shades of buff, tan, medium to dark brown.
Hard, baked red film sometimes occurs (Plates 5â€™/, A, E, I;
58, I, J; 59, F, H). Cores gray, brown.
Surface finish: From poorly smoothed to fair polish.
FOPAVI
Wall thickness: 4 to 7 mm.
Lip; Rounded and almost ahvays rolled outward.
Base: Round, flat disk thicker than side walls.
Vessel shape and size: Great variety includes carinated bowls
%vith rims usually slanted outward but sometimes vertical
or slanted inward (57, A-C, E, H; 58, A-E, G, I, J); compound bowls with high convex shoulders and everted rims
(57, D, F, G, I); deep, nearly cylindrical bowls (58, F);
simple bowls (58, H) ; small jars with rims curved outward
(59, A, G); bottles of various forms (59, B-D, F, H-J);
ollas (59, K, L); and one instance of square box (59, E).
Four rim peaks occur on compound bowls (57, I) and jars
(59, G); four-lobed bodies on bottles (59, B, F, J) and
small jars (not shown).

DF_~]ORA2~ION
Treatment: Engraving, excising, brushing.
Designs: Slanted scrolls repeated four times on rims of carinated bowls and shoulders of compound bowls (57, A-H;
58, C, D, I; the strips in 57, J-U give further examples).
Flanks of scrolls have graded circles or small excised areas;
a simulation consists of whole excised triangles (57, I).
Scrolls often end in circles in center of which is small
circle, diamond, or cross. Other designs are horizontal
with S-shaped elements formed by excising (58, F, H), or.
diamond- in- circle alternated with diamond-in-diamona
and small excised triangles pointing up and down along
borderlines (58, A, B, J). Four-armed interlocking scrol.ls
occur on the bottoms of five carinated bowls, as shown m
58, K-O (rim design at top of each drawing; body design
in circle below). Carinated bowls occasionally brushed
vertically on body between rim and base (58, A). Bottles,
small jars, otlas, and square box have concentric circles
with ticking or pendant triangles on lines (59, A, B, E, F,
H, J), plain circles with cross in central one (59, K, L), and
scrolls with circle-and-cross in center (59, C, D, I). Various other combinations too numerous to mention. Red and
white pigments in lines.
CU~LTURA~ AF~ILIATIOI~S
Titus Focus. Scrolls on bowl rims sometimes similar to Hodges
Engraved but less well done, lines wider apart, vessel forms
distinct, etc. Scrolls on bowl bottoms (58, K-O) suggest
prototype for Natchitoches Engraved.
DISTPJI)UT~ON
Very common in Titus, Morris, Franklin, Upshur, Camp, and
Hopkins Counties; also occurs northward to Red :River and
southward to Smith, Gregg, and Harrison Counties.

SAN~DERS PLAIN
(Plate 60; 49, D-G)

PASTE
Temper: Abundantly tempered with clay-grit, sometimes including pulverized potsherds; pulverized bone occasionally
added. Some bottles have sand as well as clay-grit.
Texture: Coarse but quite firm.
Color: Surfaces principally shades of brown from tan to dark;
a rich chocolate is characteristic; gray-browns also occur.
Some fire-mottling, usually resulting in different shades
of brown. Baked red film on perhaps 15 per cent of vessels, primarily bowls (Plate 60, D, E). Cores darker than
surfaces, dark brown or gray to black.
Surface finish: Usually poorly to well smoothed but seldom
well polished; bottle interiors not smoothed. Surfaces
often evenly rippled from marks of smoothing tools.
FORUM
Wall thickness: Range 4 to 10 mm., average 6 or 7 mm.
Lip: Rounded to flat, flush with rim; may be notched along
outer edge or boldly scalloped (Plates 60, H; 49, G).
Base: Flat, thick disk to which side wall was attached~ on
bottles, "goblets", it may be more convex.
Vessel shape and size: More or less conical simple bowls,
ranging up to 42 cm. across and 18 cm. high (Plates 60, D,
H; 49, G). Carinated bowls even larger, up to 50 cm. or
more across and 20 cm. high, with rims 2 to 8 cm. high,
flat on outer face, and vertical or slanted slightly inward
or outward (Plate 60, F). Hemispherical bowls with two
lugs projecting upward and outward from lip on opposite
sides of mouth; other such bowls without lugs (Plate 49,
E, F). Bottles, rather poorly made (Plates 60, I; 49, D);
"goblets" with small bodies and large, cylindrical necks,
sometimes with two opposed suspension holes near top
(Plate 60, C, G); and (rarely) barrel-shaped vessels (Plate
60, A).
DECORATION
None, except for occasional red film, lip scalloping or notching.
CULTURAL AFFILIATIONS
Dominant type of Sanders Focus, constituting 60 per cent or
more of the total pottery, a unique situation in Caddoan
archeology, where most foci have very little plain ware.
Reported also in Nelson Focus, a mixture of Sanders and
Spiro Focus traits in southeastern Oklahoma (Bell and
Baerreis, 1951), and in "Late Component" at Spiro Site
(Orr, 1946).
DISTRIBUTION
Sanders Focus area in Texas, from Red River valley in northern Lamar and Fannin Counties, southward to upper Sabine
River valley in Van Zandt County; also in Choctaw County. Oklahoma. Found as trade~ ware in Wylie Focus sites
in Dallas and Collin Counties. in Central Texas Aspect
sites in middle Brazos River valley, and perhaps elsewhere.

PASTE
Same as Sanders Plab~. Red-filmed surfaces likewise occur
(F, G).
FO ~R~I
Wall thickness: Extreme range 4 to 10 mm., average 6 or 7 mm.
Lip: Rounded or slightly flattened and flush with rim.
Base: Flat, thick disk on larger bowls; evenly convex bottom
on smaller bowls and bottles.
Vessel shape and size: Carinated bowls range in diameter
from about 18 to 36 cm., in height about 8 to 12 cm.; rims
2 to 6 cm. high (A, E, G, I). Peculiar deep :bowls also
relatively common, broadest near bottom, slightly convex
sides slanting somewhat inward, two small lugs on oppo~
site sides of mouth jutting upward and outward from rim
(C, D). Large neckless, gourd-shaped bottles, with heights
up to 30 cm. and greatest diameter somewhat below the
middle (H). Engraved sherds also found which suggest
more ordinary bottle forms of Caddoan foci, but none have
been restored. Unusual shapes include a small "goblet"
with cylindrical upper part and small body (~B), and a
globular bowl with sharply outflaring rim (F). The "goblet" (B) and all known examples of the large neckless
.bottles (~H) have two opposed suspension holes not far
beneath the lip.
DECORATION
Treatment: Engraving.
Designs: Only very simple straight-line motifs in a single zone
around rims of carinated bowls, upper parts of deep bowls,
interior of rim of bowl (F), the cylindrical part of the
"goblet" (B), and the uppermost part of the large neckless
bottles,(H). The designs may consist only of parallel lines
pitched in opposite directions at intervals (G), groups of
vertical lines at intervals (rim interior of F), and a continuous series of triangles filled with hatching or crosshatching; such triangles may lie point down (A, B, C, D),
point up (H, I), or in opposed pairs (E). There may be
two or three horizontal border lines above the triangles
(C, D) but usually there are no borders either above or
below. Design motifs repeated whatever number of times
fits vessel best; while four may occur (as on H), this appears to be incidental. Red ochre pigment commonly found
in lines.
CULTURAL AFFILIATIONS
A Sanders Focus type, following Sanders PIain in frequency.
Reported in Nelson :Focus, southeastern Oklahoma (Bell

SIMMS

ENGR4kVED

(Plate 62)
PASTE
See type description for Barkman Engraved, except that Simms
Engraved is frequently shell-tempered and occasionally
red-~ilmed. Shell temper and red film rarely occur in the
same vessel, however. The film, of powdered red ochre,
was applied after firing and rubs off.
FORM
Wal! thickness: 4 to 7 mm.
Lip: Thin and rounded, turned sharply upward or outward
from an inward-slanting rim.
Base: Shallow bowls have no distinct base, but broad convex
bottoms. The very deep nearly cylindrica! bowls (see E)
have flat to slightly convex bases of about same thickness
as side walls.
Vessel shape and size: Bowls of a peculiar carinated form in
that the rim is very narrow and bends inward sharply, at
times almost at a right angle (see C, E), and the lip turns
upward or outward at a right angle to the rim. Be principal variation in form is in the depth of the bowls, most
being shallow while occasionally one is as deep as E. Maximum diameters are about 30 cm., maximum height about
20 cm.
DECORATION
Treatment: Engraving.
Designs: Decoration is confined to the very narrow rim zone
and consequently consists of very compressed designs.
Sketches G-~R illustrate some of the patterns, which are
mainly rectilinear. Ticking common and tiny punctates
made through polished surface sometimes occur as in
Bark~nan Engraved
Plate 4). Red ochre pigment found
in lines frequently, white pigment occasionally.

CULT~ AFF~LI~kTIONS
Type belongs primarily to Mc4l~urtain and Texarkana Foei; occurs occasionally in Titus and perhaps Belcher Focus, probably as trade ware. In at least two cases it extends into
association with European trade objects: at the Kaufman
site in Red River County
Harris, 1953), and as trade ware
at the Jim Allen site in Cherokee County, type site for the
historic Allen Focus in central East Texas. It is present
also at the Hunt and Clements sites near Atlanta, Cass
County, where some of the graves had European objects of
iron and glass beads. It is not well known, or even definitely present, in the historic Glendora Focus components
in Louisiana, from which it appears to be primarily a late
prehistoric type in the Fulton Aspect, surviving until the
beginning of European trade contacts, but not much
longer.
DISTRIBLPrION
Primarily close to Red River in Choctaw and McCurtain Counties, Oklahoma; Little River, Lafayette, and Miller Counties, Arkansas; and Red River, Bowie, and Cass Counties,
northeast Texas. Elsewhere probably trade ware. Occurs
seldom, if at all, in Louisiana.

SINtCER I2"NEAR P~ATED
(Plate 63)
PASTE
Temper: Clay-grit; rarely some pulverized bone added.
Texture: Compact, firm.
Color: Surfaces cream, buff, shades of brown and gray to
nearly black in fire-mottled spots. Cores same as surface
or darker.
Surface finish: Interiors smoothed; exteriors nearly covered by
decoration.
Wall thickness: 4 to 6 mm.
Lip: Rounded: usually notched along outer edge.
Base: Flat disk.
Vessel shape and size: Small jars about 10 to 15 cm. high, rims
meeting bodies at slig.ht ang!e and vertical to everted.
Globular bodies with rim varying from low and everted to
high and vertical (B). Webb (1948) includes small "cups".

DI~CORATION
Treatment: Punctating, applique.
Designs: Body and rim almost completely covered with punctations set close together in closely spaced rows, so regular
as to give the suggestion of cord marking. Punctations apparently made individually with round-tipped tool, although possibly they were made in rows with carved stamp
at times (C). Less often they were made with tip of fingernail, small and carefully done in neat rows. The rows
are arranged in parallel sets, pitched at different angles
and either straight (C-E) or slightly curved (A, B). Quadration sometimes affected with four single rows of nodes
running vertically on body (E), or sets of fillets
CULTU~AiL ~A~ILIATtONS
Principally a Bossier Focus type, possibly Haley .Fo,c.us .a.lso.
Use of sets of ~arallel lines pitched in different airec~ions
is somewhat similar to decoration of Pease Brushed-Incised, also of Bossier and possibly of Haley Focus (Plate
53). Webb (1948, p. 117) states that occasionally the decorative techniques of Sinner and Pease are combined, with
regular fields roughened by linear punctations, separated
by nodes, appliqued ridges, or single rows of heavy punctations. Some similarity in design arrangement also apparent with Dunkin Incised of Alto Focus (Plate 18) although the latter completely lacks applique and punctation. Webb also compares Sinner with type Lake Borne
Incised of Tchefuncte period in lower Mississippi valley,
pointing to the "startling similarity of decoration technique
and design arrangement," even though the intervening
complexes of Marksville, Troyville, and Coles Creek lack
these features.

DISTI~IBUrI~ON
Not found in quantity in any known site, but occurs widely in
central and northern Louisiana and southern Arkansas.
Apparently did not reach Bossier or Haley Focus components in eastern Texas.
]~TI I~AT~ AGE
Transitional between Gibson and Fulton Aspects, possibly
1000-1200 A. D. Stratigraphically older than Belcher Focus
at Belcher site in Louisiana.

PASTE (data from Orr, 1946, p. 237: see "Spiro 5 Type")
Temper: Fine clay-grit; rarely, bone.
Texture: Very fine, compact, contorted; hardness 2,5 to 4,
average 3.
Color: Darker shades of brown; black; a few red-orange.
Surface finish: Smoothed to polished.

Vessel shape and size: (1) cylindrical jars; (2) jars with short,
straight, and outflaring rims, and inverted pear-shaped
bodies; (3) "suittoon" shape, globular body and tall rim
(one case); (4~) bottles with tall conical necks and spherical bodies; (5) hemispherical bowls; (6) vertical-rimmed

bottles in Plate 64 (A, C, D, F-~H) ; bowls with two "open
sl~outs" on rim ,(,B, E); small jar with short, outflaring
rim (I).

DF~CORATION
Treatment: Engraving, incising, punctating.
Designs: Concentric circles with parallel diagonal lines between the sets (A, ~B, E); tight spirals (C); sets of concentric or nested arcs (D, F, H, I); nested squares, with
diagonals ,breaking across them or between different sets
(G); and various similar combinations of striking beauty.
Parallel horizontal lines always occur around the top of
bottle bodies, sometimes at top of spout (G), and rims of
other forms (B, E, I). Designs characteristically engraved
through polished surface, but some may have been incised
in still-plastic clay, then polished over. Fine punctates
appear in circles and corners of designs (B, F, I). Red
ochre pigment used in lines and punctates. Design units
repeated four times most commonly; two, three, five also
used.
AFFH~IATIONS
A ~piro Focus type, closely related to Holly Fine Engraved of
Alto Focus (~lates 34, 35), particularly in bottle form with
tapered spout, and design layout. The Spiro type Iacks
carinated bowls, common in Holly; the lines are bolder and
spaced farther apart; incising may be substituted for engraving; and where Holly type has design corners excised,
Spiro type uses punctating instead. The HoZly type lacks
"open spouts" on bowl rims (B, E); and several of its
special features of rim and lip contour are lacking in the
Spiro type.
DIS~I~IBUr~ION

TAYLOR ENC~RAV~ED
(Plates 65, 66)
PASTE
Temper: Often none visible; otherwise, fine clay-grit or small
amount of said; rarely, finely pulverized bone or tuff.
Texture:

Fine, compact, usually does not break easily.

Color: Various shades of gray and brown from very light to
very dark and almost black. Some fire-mottling on lightercolored vessels but best ones are evenly dark gray or
brown. Bright red, baked film occurs occasionally (Plate
65, B, D, G, L). Soft, flaky red film (Plate 65, K) may
have been applied after firing. Cores gray to black.
Surface finish: From smoothed to well polished; bottles not
smoothed inside.

Wall thickness: 2 to 5 mm. but most are 4 or 5 mm.
Lip: Rounded, almost always rolled outward.
Base: Round, flat disk on a few vessels (~Plate 65, M-O) ; usually convex or somewhat flattened. Some bottles have
"extended base" (Plate 66, D, E, I, K), probably solid.
Vessel shape and size: Variety of small bottles, bowls, jars.
Some bowls have small bodies and high, outward-flaring
rims (Plate 65, A, C, :I-I) with mouth diameter considerably
greater than body. Very deep bowls with rim gently flaring outward but not distinct from body (:Plate 65, D, G,
Simple bowls (Plate 65, N). Carinated bowls with rim
slanted inward or outward (Plate 65, I, L, O). Small
polished jars with rims low to high and vertical to flaring
outward, but mouth diameter less than that of body (Plate
65, B, E, F, J). Compound bowl (Plate 65, K). Hemispherical bowl (Plate 66, J). Bottles with spouts vertical,
slightly tapered, slightly outflaring, or spool-shaped with
bulge in middle (Plate 66, B, C, E, I). In one case, bottle
mouth covered with node-studded cap except for small
opening (Plate 66, G).

DECORATION
Treatment: Engraving, punctating.
Designs: Featured principally by tight scrolls, lines close together, and spirals which look almost like concentric
circles. Almost invariably the center of the scroll or spiral
shows two arms hooked toward one another but separated
by a short gap (seen most clearly in Plate 66, A). The
scrolls sweep gracefully around vessel, sometLmes very
evenly spaced. Ticks occur on lines (Plate 65, E, F, G, I;
Plate 66, F) and occasionally small triangles are pendant
from the lines (Plate 65, B, J, P). Scrolls adjusted to the
narrow horizontal space available on a carinated bowl
(~Plate 65, I, L, O) are naturally not handled as freely as
those on jar and bottle bodies with more space. In at least

PLATE 65

Texas Archeological Society

362

one case (Plate 66, I) a bottle xvith tight concentric circles
has been included because the appearance is almost like
that of the scrolls on bottles K, L. In Texas and Louisiana
the design is almost invariably repeated four times; specimens from west-central Arkansas (Plate 66, H, J, K) usually repeat the design three times, but two and four are
known. An area around the base of the spout, a square
when seen from above, may be filled with small punctates
(Plate 66, D, E, I). Both white and red pigments appear in
the lines with some frequency.

C ULTLr~AL AFFTLIATIONS
3,Iost commonly associated with Titus and Belcher Foci, less
frequently with Texarkana and Mid-Ouachita. Conceptions of what is to be included in type have altered several
times. Webb and Dodd (1941) considered such vessels to
*be one of the numerous sub-types of Belcher Engrave&
Krieger (1946, Figure 18) labeled some vessels "Taylor
Engraved" in Titus and Belcher Foci which contrasted in
several ways with Ripley Engraved on the one hand, and
Belcher Engraved (as it was then restricted by Web]a) on
the other. Webb (:1948) then labeled some Belcher mound
vessels as "Taylor Engraved but he and the authors have
recently decided that this was too inclusive also as it embraced specimens which we would now call Hodges Engraved (Plates 32, 33) and Glassel! Engraved (Plate 25).
Thus, in Webb, 1948, Plate 11, Nos. 3 and 4 would still be
regarded as Taylor Engraved but No. 5 is clearly Hodges
Engraved; and on Plate 12. Nos. 7-11 the sherds would
probably now be called Glassell Engraved. Future research
will require that a clearer distinction be made between
Taylor Engraved and what we have called Wilder Engraved
of Titus Focus as a new type (Plate 68). The latter does
not occur in Louisiana or Arkansas as a resident type but
it shares with Taylor Engraved some designs with the two
hooked arms in the center of the scrolls. Webb (1948, p.
110) reported that "Taylor Engraved" sherds are found on
the majority of Bossier Focus sites, as well as in Titus and
Belcher Foci, but association of this type with Bossier
should be re-examined.
DISTRIBUTION
Found widely in northeast Texas, northwest Louisiana, and
southwest Arkansas. Occurrence in Oklahoma may be expected, if only as trade ware.
ESTIMATED AGE
1200-1500 A. D. (span allowed for Titus and Belcher Foci). If
in Bossier Focus might be dated somewhat earlier at beginning.

PASTE
Temper: Clay-grit; rarely, bone.
Texture: From granular and compact to coarse and crumbly.
Color: Various shades of brown, reddish-brown, and brick red.
Largest and thickest vessels tend toward yellowish-brown
and reddish-brown; smallest toward medium to very dark
brown, ahnost black. Cores darker than surfaces.
Surface finish:
Many vessels covered with design; others
smoothed but not polished over plain areas.
FORM
Wall thickness: Extreme range 3 to 11 mm., average about 6
mm.
Lip: Rounded and flat in about equal numbers, some flat ones
sloping to exterior. Most are same thickness as body and
rim, a few widened to as much as 17 mm., flat and horizontal on top.
Base: Flat disk, 6 to 9 mm. thick, in all cases except one, a
flat square base on cylindrical vessel.
Vessel shape and size: Most common are small jars 7 to 20 cm~
high with more or less globular bodies and short rims from
vertical to slightly outflaring (A, C, D, I). Next most frequent are carinated bowls up to 30 cm. or more across (F),
and cylindrical vessels from 14 to 22 cm. or more in height
(B, G). A few compound bowls indicated by sherds appear
to be as much as 25 cm. in diameter (E, I:I). Appendages
absent.
DECORATION
Treatment: Arched punctures, done with thumbnail in most
cases, with hollow cyhnder pressed in at angle in others;
pinching; incising.
Designs: Type most easily identified by from one to eight or
nine rows of evenly spaced arched impressions around rim
of vessels, except in one case where they are on shoulder
of compound bowl (H); these rows of arches alternated
with horizontal incised lines in most cases but free in others; impressions usually arched upward but occasionally
downward. Vessel bodies plain (D, E, F, H), covered with
vertical incising closely spaced (B, C), pinched impressions running in vertical rows (A, G), fingernail impressions placed end-to-end or overlapping to make spiraling
lines (I), etc~ Spiral designs repeated four times. Other
bodies have grids of diagonal and horizontal lines like those
of Dunkin Inc~sed (Plate 18). Designs not smoothed over.

DECORATION
Treatment: Engraving, excising, punctating.
Designs: Scrolls, repeated four times around vessel. Each
scroll consists of two arms, one beginning at upper margin, other at lower margin. They circle into one another,
sometimes not meeting at center but separated by a gap
(E, F, J, K, M), at other times meeting at opposite sides of
a small circle (D, H, L). This circle may be excised or
cross-hatched or have a cross in it (D). Where the two
scroll arms pass above and below this circle, they are
widened considerably by excising (D, H, L). These swellings may occur even when there is no circle joining the
two scroll arms (A-C, E, I, K). Sometimes the two arms
that hook toward one another are plain single lines
ticked lines (~M), or narrow cross-hatched bands (G, I).
Punctated areas may appear around top of body as in J.
:Red pigment seldom occurs.
CULT Dâ€™B~L/~FFILIATIONS
A Titus Focus type. These vessels were originally included in
Ripley Engraved (Krieger, 1946, Figure 18) but have now
been separated because of the peculiar scroll arms and the
much smaller range of vessel forms. The Wilder type requires more research for more precise distinction from both
Ripley Engraved (Plates 57-59) and Taylor Engraved

MISCELLANEOUS FULTON ASPF_~T UTILITY POTTERY
(Plate 69)
GENERAL NOTES
Plate 69 attempts to provide a bare indication of the variety of
rough utility pottery which is to be found in northeast
Texas in the foci of Fulton Aspect. Many hundreds of
complete vessels and thousands of sherds collected in this
area have not yet been analyzed by type, ,but others are
described above (see: Belcher Ridged, Plate 6; Bullard
Brushed, Plate 9; Cass Appliqued, Plate 11; Clements
Brushed, Plate 12; Harleton Appliqued, Plate 28; Karnack
Brushed-Incised, Plate 38; Killough Pinched, Plate 41;
LaRue Neck Banded, Plate 42; McKinney Plain, Plate 43;
Maydelle Inc~sed, Plate 46; Military Road Inc~sed, Plate 48;
Nash Neck Ba~ded, Plate 50; Pease Brushed-Inc~sed, Plate
53. Some others, such as Cowhide Stamped and~Fb~ter
Trailed-Inc~sed, Plates 13 and 20, often have soot on the
inside, indicating use for cooking, but are too well made
to .be classed as "rough" cooking ware).
The vessels shown are entirely of clay-grit temper, occasionally
~vith bone added, as is the case with all utility of the
~rankston, Titus, Allen, and Bossier Foci, and nearly all
of that of Texarkana, Belcher, and Mid-Ouachita Foci. The
remaining utility ware of the latter loci, and most of that
of McCurtain and Glendora, is tempered with pulverized
shell (see Plate 70, A-G). The techniques of incising,
pinching, fingernail punctations, stick punctations, applique, and brushing are all found in various combinations,
often two or three on the same vessel, so that classification into types is quite arbitrary--much more so than in
the polished and engraved wares--and will generally depend upon whichever technique covers the greater part of
the vessel surface or provides the dominant part of the design.
The associations are as follows: A, B, Frankston Focus; C, N,
Hunt and ~lements Sites, Cass County (see pages 225-227) ;
D-K, Titus Focus; L, M, Texarkana Focus. These specimens do not, however, provide even a rough indication of
the variety of styles to be found in these loci.

UTILITY POTTERY
(~Plate 70)
GEN~ERAL NOTES
Specimens A-G illustrate selected utility vessels from MidOuachita Focus, all shell-tempered except B, G, which are
clay-grit tempered. Shell-tempered vessels are infrequent
in this focus, the greater part of the utility ware consisting
of the clay-tempered type Military Road Incised (Plate
48). These vessels are shown for contrast with those in
Plate 69, which see for remarks on Fulton Aspect utility
pottery in general.
Specimens H-N represent a few selected examples of utility
ware from Haley Focus of Gibson Aspec~ which have not
been formally analyzed by type. No shell-tempered pottery is known in this Aspect, it being entirely tempered
with coarse clay-grit, to which pulverized bone was sometimes added. While specimens H-N show some consistency
in being decorated either with punctates or vertical incised lines, not enough vessels are available for establishing new types. For types now recognized in various loci
of Gibson Aspect, see those described above: Canton Incised, Plate 10; Dunkin Incised, Plate 18; Haley Complicated Incised, Plate 27; Kiam Incised, Plate 40; and the
jars, at least, included in Weches Fingernail Impressed,
Plate 67. On the whole, there is much less variety of decorative technique in Gibson Aspect than in Fulton Aspect;
and there is greater tendency to use only one technique on
each ves~sel, so that they are more easily classified.

PASTE
Temper: Clay-grit, to which white particles
times added.
Texture:

some-

Granular but firm, breaks with sharp edges.

Color: Exteriors gray, yellow, buff, orange, brown, and greenish-gray; considerable fire-mottling. Cores black.
Surface finish:

Exteriors and interiors both poorly smoothed.

Wall thickness:

5 to 10 mm., average 7 mm.

Lip:

Rounded, slightly thickened with strip added to outer

Base:

Convex or slightly flattened; vessels do not stand up

well.
Vessel shape and size: Type name now restricted to a series of
large ollas with globular bodies and small mouths with
vertical rims. Greatest diameter at middle or somewhat
below; there may be a slightly angular turn to the wall at
point of" greatest diameter. The shape of these ollas is the
same as in the decorated types described above, as follows:
Clements Brushed, Plate 12, B; Ripley Engraved, Plate 59,
K, L; Wilder Engraved, Plate 68, K. Complete vessels from
Belcher Site, Louisiana, measure 30 to 40 cm. high and 35
to 40 cm. in maximum diameter. The bodies are usually
deformed in the lower parts, as though the makers were
unable to prevent slumping due to the shape and weight
of the clay before firing.
DECORATION

Treatment: A little incising.
Designs: Bodies completely plain and constitute nearly the
entire vessel surface. A few irregularly incised lines appear on neck of a few specimens. Shades of color produced by fire-mottling attractive and may have been done
intentionally.
CULTURAL AFFILIATIONS
Large plain ollas appear to be restricted to Belcher Focus as a
resident type. The only known exception is a small specimen shown by Harrington (1920, Plate XCI, B) from Site
11 at Ozan in Hempstead County, Arkansas. There must

Texas Archeological Society

373

be an intimate connection with the decorated ollas mentioned above in the Titus Focus and Clements Site, where
there are no plain ollas, so far as known, while conversely,
Belcher Focus components have no known decorated ones.
All of these together constitute a unique vessel form in
Caddoan archeology, and they are not found elsewhere in
the entire Eastern United States. The form is very similar
to a common one in the Puebloan culture of the Southwest
United States, which, together with other ceramic parallels
between Caddoan and Puebloan culture, has been discussed
by Krieger (1946, pp. 235-247 and Plate 32). The mouths
are just large enou~i~ to insert a hand; the ollas may have
been for food storage.
DISTRIBUTION
Known as an established type only at Belcher Site, Caddo
Parish, Louisiana, in Belcher Focus component (two upper
levels).
ESTIMATED AGE
1200-1500 A. D. or part thereof.
RE~ERENCES
First described as "subtype C" of "Type 4, Belcher Plain"
(Webb and Dodd, 1941, p. 101 and ~Plate 17, No. 6). At
that time, "Belcher Plain" was considered to include all
plain vessels and sherds from the upper two levels at
Belcher Site. Later, Webb restricted Belcher Plain to
these ollas (Krieger, 1946, Fig. 18).

in this site, but many of the decorated types (see Plates
14-18, 31, 34, 35, 40, 54, 67) had designs only on the rims
and upper portions. For this reason no body sherds have
been included in Bowles Creek Plain, because any single
sherd might have come from the lower portions of a vessel
that was decorated higher up. Bowles Creek Plain includes
only those sherds large enough to show that the rim or
upper portion of the vessel was completely plain, so that in
all probability the entire vessel was undecorated. These
sherds indicate the same vessel forms found in all the other
Alto ~Focus types, so the type may best be visualized as
consisting of the whole array of forms, of which only an
occasional vessel, perhaps two or three out of a hundred,
simply was left without any kind of decoration.

gallons capacity. Wide shoulder area, body tapered toward
base rather than globular, rim vertical or slightly outcurving.
DECORATION
Treatment:

Neck banding, fingernail punctating.

Designs: Corrugated effect produced on rims by crimping each
coil down on preceding one, at regular intervals, in same
manner as shown for type LaRue Neck Banded (Plate 42).
This technique never shows on ~body below rim zone, although entire vessels of this and other types were made by
coiling and each coil must have been added in the same
mann.er. By not smoothing over these rim coils and crimps,
and by crimping at regular intervals, a distinctly decorative
effect was reached. Bodies were left entirely plain or were
covered with irregularly spaced fingernail punctations or
pinches. These body treatments provide an easy distinction
between Duren Neck Banded and LaRue Neck Banded, the
latter having bodies covered with vertical brushing in every known case; Duren also lacks handles.
CULTI!RAL !kF~ILIATIONS
An Alto Focus type. Undoubtedly the ancestor of LaRue Neck
Banded, a common type of Frankston Focus (Plate 42),
found in the same part of East Texas. The change from
plain or fingernail-punctated bodies in the Duren type to
brushed bodies in the LaRue type is a general one in the
utility pottery types of Alto and Frankston Focus. The
type Nash Neck Banded of Texarkana and McCurtain Focus
(Plate 50) is related to Duren and LaRue in the basic technique of neck decoration, but the vessels are much smaller,
four rim peaks and shell temper are common in it, and the
crimping is notably better done, with thinner coils and
finer indentations.
DISTIRIBUTION
Found mainly at Davis Site, Cherokee County, with a few
sherds in other Alto Focus components. Unknown in Louisiana compo~aents.

H~DY INCISED
GENERAL NOTES
Some Caddoan pottery from Alto Focus was once classified as
"Hardy Incised", a type long known in eastern Louisiana
(Krieger, 1946, Fig. 19). The same Texas vessels were
later included as possible variants of type Dunkin Incised
as defined at the Davis Site by Newell and Krieger (1949,
Figs. 41-43). They are now classified as a separate type,
Kiam Incised (present Plate 40), as originally intended by
Newell.
While there are some similarities in form and decoration between the Louisiana type Hardy Incised (for definition see
Quimby, 1951, pp. 113-114 and Fig. 14), and the Alto Focus
types Davis Incised and Kiam Incised (present Plates 17,
40), there are enough differences in paste, texture, form,
and design to distinguish them. Hardy can be readily
recognized by its exceedingly soft, fine-textured paste,
which contrasts with the thick, coarse, lumpy, and friable
paste of the two Alto Focus types. While Hardy occurs as
bowls and jars alike, with only the rim or upper part decorated with horizontal lines (sometimes with a row of
punctates below the last line), Kiam occurs only in the
form of jars with rims encircled by parallel, horizontal
lines, and bodies plain, covered with vertical incised lines,
or pinched or punctated with fingernails (Plate 40). Davis
Incised occurs in a wider variety of bowl shapes than does
Hardy, and even includes bottles (Plate 17). Further comparisons are needed.

I~EOTA CURVILIN.EAR INCISF-,D
GENERAL

NOTES

This name was improvised for certain vessels from Spiro and
other sites of Spiro Focus in eastern Oklahoma (Krieger,
1946, Fig. 19). The polished-over incised designs on these
vessels are very similar to those of Crockett C~ilincar
Incised of Alto Focus (present Plates 14-16), and while the
vessel shapes are also similar in some respects, the very
common carinated howl form of Alto Focus is missing in
Oklahoma and western Arkansas.
It may be said that many of the vessels once called "Keota
Curvilinear Incised" in Oklahoma and Arkansas actually
belong to the type Crockett Curvilinear Incised, for they
cannot be distinguished from the latter by design layout,
vessel form, paste, or surface finish. On the other hand,
there may be other vessels which only generally resemble
Crockett but possess enough distinctive features to define
another type (or types). This is a matter for future
search. The name Keota no longer has any meaning and
should be dropped.

SMITHPORT PLAIN

GENERAL NOTES
This type was first defined by Webb and Dodd (1941, pp. 103104 and Plate 17, No. 4) in the two lower levels of the
Belcher Site in Caddo Parish, Louisiana. It is now considered a trait of Haley Focus and has been recognized in
collections from the Haley, Crenshaw, East, and other sites
of this focus. It consists primarily of bottles very similar
in shape and size to those included in Haley Engraved
(present Plate 26, .B, C, F), while sherds with similar paste
may indicate other forms. About a dozen of the sherds
originally reported by Webb and Dodd (1941) were coated
with a bright red, soft red film. While the type occurs in
the Red River valley at least as far upstream as the great
bend, it has not been recognized yet in Texas.

WILKINSON
GENERAL

BUIWCTATED

NOTES

This type was first defined by Ford and Willey (1940, pp. 5051 and Fig. 15, D-F) in connection with the Crooks Site in
central Louisiana, where it was believed to represent an
intrusive element from the Caddoan area of northwestern
Louisiana. It consisted of clay-grit tempered sherds on
which were rows of fingernail punctations or pinches.
As the original specimens were body sherds and ~he accompanying rim decoration unknown, the type is no longer
regarded as valid. The same fingernail punctations may
be found on the bodies of utility jars in several Caddoan
types: see Dunktn Incised (Plate 18), Kiam Incised (Plate
40), Weches Fingernail l~npressed (Plate 67), and Du~,en
Neck Banded (not illustrated, but described above). They
also occur on rim or body, or both, of utility vessels in
Fulton Aspect (Plate 69), but less often than in Gibson
Aspect.

COASTAL POTTERY TYPES
GOOSE CREEK PLAIN
(Plate 71)
PASTE
Method of manufacture: Coiled.
Temper: Sand or sand combined with clay-grit; rarely, pulverized bone.
Texture: Fine to coarse, depending on size of either sand or
clay-grit particles. Sandiest sherds feel like sandstone,
particles loose on surface; in others the sand grains are
imbedded in clay.
Color: Gray, brown, and gray-brown, mainly in dark shades
ranging to nearly black; also reddish-brown, buff, tan,
orange-brown, yellow. Much fire-mottling, so that several
shades may occur on same vessel. Cores dark gray and
brown to black.
Surface finish: Poorly smoothed and uneven both inside and
outside, possibly indicating paddle-and-anvil method of
finishing, at least in some cases. In others, marks of scraping and smoothing tools show on surfaces. Occasionally,
interior deeply striated with parallel lines (I) or grid of
crossed lines (H), possibly produced by smoothing interior with coarse grass.
FOI~M
Wall thickness: Range 3 to 10 mm., average about 5 mm.
Lip: Usually a rather sharp edge, but may be flat and flush
with rim or rounded and turned outward slightly
Base: Characterized by a round, thick knob to which vessel
wall was attached, and which projected downward to form
a conical bottom (A). The edges of these knobs, and
sherds broken from them, show coiling technique was
used. Flat or slightly convex bases also known.
Vessel shape and size: General absence of complete vessels,
but largest sherds suggest three forms: (1) deep bowls
with more or less hemispherical bodies; (2) cylindrical
vessels; (3) vessels essentially cylindrical but curving
inward gently between the middle and mouth (Wheat,
1953, Plate 31). The conical, knobbed base may occur on
all three forms, but this is uncertain. The bowls range to
45 cm. in diameter, the cylindrical vessels to 25 cm. or
more in height. Drilled holes sometimes appear just below the lip and may have been for suspension; others
appear in pairs on either side of a crack (B, D) and must
have been used to repair cracked vessels with cords or
thongs.

DECORATION
Lip notching fairly common, as short incisions running at right
angles or diagonally along outer edge, or in diagonals and
crossed diagonals on top of flattened lip. A red wash was

PLATE 71

Texas Archeological Society

380

applied to the exterior in rare cases; in others, the firing
produced a rather bright red.
CULTURAL AFF ~I~LIATIONS
A Galveston Bay Focus type, the undecorated counterpart of
Goose Creek Incised. Both types share occasional striation
of the interior with the Rockport types (Plates 73) of the
central Gulf Coast area in Texas. There appears to be no
specific relationship to the Caddoan ceramic traditions farther inland; such traits as are shared with Caddoan wares
(clay-grit temper, occasional red film) are of more general distribution in the Southeast United States than these
complexes.

DISTRI]3UTION
All around Galveston Bay as well as some distance inland and
westward along coast; extent into Louisiana has not been
investigated.
ESTIMATED AGE
Pre-European, but otherwise difficult to determine. Wheat
(1953, Plate 33, K) illustrates a trade sherd of type TcheSuncte Stamped from Louisiana in an excavated site in the
Addicks Reservoir basin west of Houston; if this dates the
Goose ~reek pottery types, they may have been in existence as early as 500 A. D. The conical bottoms are remindful of certain Woodland potteries of the Eastern
United States which could date before the time of Christ.
On the other hand, this ware may be a survival into late
pre-Columbian times, made by the Attakapan Indian
groups who inhabited this part of Texas.

GOOSE CREEK INCISED
(~Plate 72)
PASTE, FORM
See Goose Creek Plain.
DECORATION
Treatment: Incising, punctating.
Designs: In all known cases, decoration is confined to rim zone.
Most common design consists of from one to six parallel
horizontal lines just below lip, beneath which a single row
of punctates occurs occasionally (F, H, I, K, R, S). Pendant triangles filled with diagonal lines or punctates may
also occur,below the bottom line (B, E, G, 3", M, N). Other
elements include diagonal ladders (A), ticking on border
lines (~), crossed diagonals (,D, P), ticked diagonals between upper and lower border lines (L), and diamonds or

PLATE 72

Texas Archeological Soc. iet]t

382

squares filled with cross-hatching (0, T). The widely
spaced vertical lines on a vessel body (Q) probably represent an intrusive element. The lines and punctates are,
in general, quite finely executed.
CULTURAL AFFILIATIONS
A Galveston Bay Focus type (see Goose Creek Plain for further remarks). The use of simple horizontal lines encircling the vessel rim, sometimes with a row of punctates
below the bottom line, is found in the types Coles Creek
Incised and Hardy Incised in central and eastern Louisiana.
For this reason, Goose Creek Incised (and Goose Creek
Plain) may have existed contemporaneously with the Troyville, Coles Creek, and Plaquemine periods of the lower
Mississipp.i Valley, although the Galveston Bay pottery is
very unhke the latter in most features.
DISTRIBUTION, ESTIMATED AGE
Same as Goose Creek Plain.

ROCKPORT BLACK-ON-GRAY
(Plate 73)
PASTE
Method of manufacture: Probably coiled.
Temper: Most sherds have a fine sandy appearance with no
visible added tempering material.
Texture: Generally fine, compact, homogeneous; hard, does
not crumble or break easily.
Color: Predominantly dark gray and brown; light gray, buff,
reddish-brown, yellowish-brown also occur. Cores dark
brown to black. Areas of soot may darken parts of surface. Some fire-mottling.
Surface finish:
Poorly smoothed, uneven, to fairly well
smoothed. Interiors sometimes deeply striated (Fâ€™, K, P),
perhaps in scraping with coarse grass or twigs.
FORM
Wall thickness: Extreme range 1.5 to 7 mm., 2 to 4 mm. being
common near Gulf shores while farther inland the walls
are thicker.
Lip: Rounded or flat, often notched or crenelated (Potter,
1930, Plates 7, Nos. 5-10 and 9, No. 17).
Base: Little data; some convex, others possibly conical.
Vessel shape and size: Potter (1930, Plates 8, 9) illustrates
bottle necks, hemispherical bowl, and gourd-like ollas;
probably similar bowls are most common shape. Plate 73.
D, S are rim sherds from wide-mouthed j.ars; J is bottle

exterior). Handles very rare on coast, more common farther inland. Holes appear, either for suspension or for repairing cracks.
DECORATION
Treatment: Painting with asphaltum; occasional punctating;
rarely, red wash.
Designs: Narrow squiggles or bands (A, B, E, J, T), usually
running vertically on bowl rims and bottle spouts, sometimes alternated with vertical rows of punctates (Potter,
1930, Plate 8, Nos. 11-15). Also broader meandering or
zigzag bands (C, D, F, G, L, M) and random streaks (~I-I,
R); large dots (V, W) which may be arranged in vertical
rows around upper parts of ollas (Potter, 1930, Plate 9, No.
16). A narrow band may cover lip, extending down sides a
short distance (S), or a wide band may encircle vessel on
inside (N) or outside of rim. Some interiors are almost
covered with asphaltum, probably to waterproof them (U).
Other smears lie alongside of and partly over broken edges
(I, Q), indicating attempts to waterproof cracked vessets.
In rare cases, a red wash covered at least part of the exterior surface before the asphaltum lines were applied, giving a polychrome effect (F, L).
CULTURAL AFFILIATIONS
A Rockport Focus type, closely linked with Rockport Plain and
Rockport Incised, the three types constituting a ware which
contrasts strongly with all other wares in Texas. As yet,
the origin of this ware has not been traced to any particular
source in other regions--that is, to other culture complexes in the Southeast or Southwest United States, or
Middle America. The deeply striated interiors of some
vessels are quite like those of Goose Creek Plain and Goose
Creek Incised (,Plate 71, H, I), but in other respects these
types are quite unlike.
DISTRIBUTION
Central portion of Texas Gulf Coast, particularly around Batfin, Corpus Christi, Aransas, Copano, San Antonio, and
Matagorda Bays, and extending inland as far as Goliad,
where two missions and a presidio were established in the
middle 18th century.
ESTIMATED AGE
From an unknown date prior to 1400.,A. D. until at least as late
as 1750, perhaps after 1800. At Mission Espiritu Santo, established in 1749 at Goliad, Texas, there are not only
sherds of this type which must have been carried inland
from the coastal bays, but a thicker pottery made at the
mission and decorated with asphaltum in exactly the same
manner as on the coast. The ware also agrees closely with
pottery made by the Karankawa in the 19~h century, as
described by Gatschet. Probably several coastal tribes,
such as Mariames, Copano, Cojane, etc., made this pottery
as well as the so-called "Karankawa".

ROCKPORT PLAIN
PASTE, FORM
Same as Rockport Black-on-Gray. The shell temper described
by Potter (1930) for his "Classes I and II" is really pulverized bone, so far as the authors have been able to determine; angular chunks of ~bone appear scattered in some
sherds, but it is neither common nor evenly distributed in
individual sherds.
DECORATION
Aside from some notched and crenelated lips, the vessels are
plain. The type is based only on rim sherds large enough
to indicate that entire vessels were undecorated; the body
sherds alone could not be distinguished from the undecorated parts of Rockport-Black-on-Gray and Rockpor~
cised vessels.
CULTUrRAL AFFILIATIONS
A Rockport Focus type, somewhat si_m,ilar to Goose Creek
Plain of Galveston Bay Focus (Plate ~1), but thinner, with
much finer and more compact paste, harder (with sharper
edges where broken), and vessel forms on the whole probably quite distinct.
DISTRIBUTION, ESTIMATED AGE, REFERENCES
Same as Rockport Black-on-gray.

ROCKPORT IN.CISED
PASTE, FORM
Essentially the same as Rockport Black-on-gray but somewhat
thicker. For remark on "shell temper" reported by Potter, see Rockport Plain.
DECORATION
Treatment: Incising.
Designs: Simple geometric elements in narrow zone around
rim: horizontal or diagonal lines, crossed lines, triangles,
etc. (examples in Potter, 1930, Plate 7, Nos. 1-4). They compare with those of Goose Creek Incised (present Plate 72)
except that punctates were seldom, if ever, used.
CULTURAL AFFILIATIONS
A Rockport Focus type, closely allied to Rockport Black-ongray and Rockport Plain, but much less common than
either of them. Undecorated body sherds cannot be distinguished from those of the other two types in the present
state of analysis. Detailed comparisons have not ,been made
between the design elements of Rockport Incised and Goose
Creek Inc~sed but it appears likely that those of the former
were derived from the latter by a diffusion of ideas along
the coastal plain; neither has any close relative elsewhere,
so far as known.

MISCELLANEOUS
(Plate 74, G, I-J, N)
GENERAL NOâ€™I~ES
A few Central Texas potsherds have been designated "Doss
Red Ware" by Kelley (1947, p. 123), who does not describe
them except as "thin potsherds with sand and bone temper,
and a red washed semi-polished surface". The pottery we
have designated Leon Plain does not have a wash or film,
but some sherds are bright red as a result of firing temperatures. On the other hand, certain sherds which do have
faint remnants of a red wash on a cream or pale yellow
background (G), are not tempered with sand or bone, but
with abundant small particles of a white mineral substance, probably volcanic in origin.
Almost identical
sherds, even including a faint red wash, are found in
the Huastecan archeological area on the east coast of
Mexico, where they belong to Period V (Buena Vista
Period: see Du Solier, Krieger, and Griffin, 1947). Thus,
if the "Doss ,Red Ware" should be proved to be trade ware
from the Huastecan area, a date of about 1000 to 1100 A. D.
would be indicated.

Brushed utility ware occurs in Central Texas, mainly as trade
pottery from Frankston Focus in East Texas. Occasionally,
however, brushed pottery appears to have been made in
the central area. Specimens I, I" are parts of one such
vessel, a jar with high rim brushed vertically, body brushed
horizontally and diagonally, and a row of fingernail puncrates at the rim-body junction. Specimen J is very faintly
brushed. Incised decoration is very rare on pottery apparently made in this area; N is an example which in paste
and temper is similar to Leon Plain.

NORTH-CEâ€™NTRAL TEXAS POTTERY TYPES
NOCONA PLAIN
PASTE
Method of manufacture: Probably coiled but does not break
regularly in horizontal direction.
Temper: Usually abundantly tempered with crushed mussel
shells; in rare cases, no temper visible.
Texture: Fairly compact to crumbly; shell particles occasionally leached out, leaving porous paste.
Color: Mainly shades of brown, gray-brown, reddish-brown,
orange-brown, etc., but ranging from dark cream to nearly
black. Not much fire-mottling; cores about same as surface or darker.
Surface finish: Poorly smoo.thed and uneven, suggesting possibly use of paddle-and-anvi!, but some exterior surfaces
fairly smooth, satiny.
FOP~M
Wall thickness: 4 to 8 mm.
Lip: Usually rounded and flush with rim or turned outward
slightly; may also be a quite sharp edge, and in rare cases,
flat (Krieger, 1946, Fig. 5, shows rim profiles).
Base: Rounded bottoms, merging with side walls and same
thickness.
Vessel shape and size: Almost exclusively jars, so far as can
be determined from sherds; more or less hemispherical
bowls also suggested. Jar rims may meet body at definite
angle or merge gradually; rims 1 to 4 cm. high, bodies unknown; mouth diameters probably more or less equal to
maximum body diameters.
DECORATION
Treatment:
Usually none, but small amount of applique,
punctating, incising may occur.
Designs: A row of small applique nodes may occur around
vessel at rim-body junction; rarely, scattered fingernail
punctates or striations appear on body or rim; in a few
cases, shallow depressions made with a very blunt tool.
CULTURAL A~FFILIATIONS
A Henrietta Focus type, also occurring in Wylie Focus farther
east, but difficult to determine whether made by Wylie
Focus people or obtained by trade (Caddoan pottery from
East Texas also occurs in Wylie Focus, where it is rather
clearly all trade ware). Similar pottery occurs in southcentral Oklahoma in the Bryan Focus (Bell and Baerreis,
1951), where applique nodes and fillets, as well as handles,
are more commonly found.
DISTRIBUTION
North-central Texas, extending from near the junction of Red
River with the Panhandle boundary eastward down the
Red River valley to Fannin and perhaps Lamar County,
and southward into the upper drainage systems of the
Brazos and Trinity Rivers.
ESTIMATED AGE
1200-1500 A. D.

ANTELOPE CREEK FOCUS POTTERY TYPES
BORG~R CORDMAI~KED
(Plates 75, "/6)
PASTE
Method of manufacture:

Undetermined.

Temper: Crushed quartz, sand, mica, and occasionally small
bone chunks; usually two or more of these substances
used in same vessel.
Texture: Usually quite compact and hard, broken edges sharp,
but thicker vessels may be friable to crumbly.
Color: Darker shades of gray and brown most usual, but some
are orange-brown and others nearly black. A light red
wash occasionally occurs on interior. Cores dark gray to
black. Soot and grease stains common.
Surface finish: Interiors poorly to fairly well smoothed but
bumpy; exteriors covered with cordmarking.
FORM
Wall thickness: Extreme range 2 to 12 mm., but many are
quite thin, from 2 to 4 mm., with tendency for vessel to be
thinner toward bottom than at top and in rim zone.
Lip:

Rounded or flat and flush with rim.

Base:

Convex bottoms with no distinguishable base.

Vessel shape and size: Only form yet recognized is that of
jars, but considerable variation in proportions of moutia
and body diameters, and bodies may be from globular
(Plates "/5, A, B, 76, C, D) to rather elongate (Plate 76, B).
Rims generally meet body at definite angle and slope inward or outward slightly, or stand vertical; in some cases,
body and rim merge in gentle curve (Plate 76, A, D) with
mouth considerably smaller in diameter than body. Vessel size is on the whole rather uniform, restored specimens
ranging between 20 and 30 cm. in total height with rims
3 to 6 cm. high; bodies range from 23 to 31 cm. in maximum diameter, mouths ~14 to 22 cm. Lugs and handles
~apparently absent.
D]i~CORATION
Treatment: Cord impressions; rarely, incising and fingernail
punctating.
Designs: Impressions of fine cords cover entire exterior of
vessels, almost always placed vertically on body and rim

alike, but occasionally in grids that tend to cross one another (Plate 75, A, rather definitely, B, C, partially). In
some instances, cordmarking on rim partly smoothed over
and single deeply incised line or ro~v of fingernail punc~
rates encircles vessel at rim-body juncture. Lips may be
deeply notched on outer edge.
CULTUR/kL AFFILIATIONS
An Antelope Creek Focus type, related to Stamper Cordmarked
of Optima Focus in Oklahoma Panhandle (Watson, 1950).
Also bears a general relationship to scores of types of cordmarked pottery in Great Plains and Woodland areas of
United States and Canada. ~,Â¥hile probably more or less
coeval with Upper Republican culture cordmarked wares,
Borger lacks the specialized rim and lip treatments, incising, etc., which distinguish the former.

DIS~IBUTION
Canadian River drainage system in upper Texas Panhandle
and lower plains along eastern side of Panhandle, probably extending into western Oklahoma; known as far east
as Young County on upper Brazos River,
ESTIMATED AGE
First estimated at 1300-1450 A. D. because of association with
Puebloan trade pottery from Ne~v Mexico; nov,, estimated
at 1100 or 1200 to 1450 A. D.

TRANS-PECOS POTTERY TYPES

(NON-PUEBLOAN)
CONCHO$ RED-ON-BROWN
GENER/~L NOTES:
Little data available. Sherds indicate a thick, rather
crudely painted pottery with broad lines drawn in a
thin, dull red paint on a brownish-buff surface. It
has been found in extreme western Texas in the Rio
Grande valley and adjacent parts of Chihuahua. It
was made in late prehistoric and early historic times.

SPEAR POINT TYPES
ALMAGRE POINTS
(Plate 77)
DESCRIPTION
Outline:
Broad triangular to leaf-shaped blade with edges
fairly straight in some cases (J, N, P) but usually convex.
Chipping very crude and one edge may be straighter than
other (E, F, K). Shoulders vary from weak to wide and
right-angular; no good barbs. Stems contracting, sometimes pointed (I, M) and sometimes approaching parallel
edges (L). Bases convex, concave, pointed, but seldom
straight because of crude workmanship. Usually thick and
heavy; might be considered as unfinished examples of
types such as Gary (Plate 94) and Lang$ry (Plate 98) but
distribution distinct from both.
Dimensions: Total length 6 to 10 cm., average 7 or 8 cm. Maximum width 3 to 5 cm.; thickness 0.5 to 1.5 cm. While
thinnest and smallest examples are well within range of
"dart points" as described in other types herein, the largest
and thickest ones appear far too heavy for such function
and would have served better as spear or lance points. If
so, it is interesting to note that there are only t~vo such
"spear" types in Texas, the other being the Pogo points of
northeast Texas (Plate 78).
CULTURAL AFFILIATIONS
In Texas the distribution is about same as Langtry and Shumla
points (Plates 98., 119), characteristic of ,Pecos River Focus
and also occurring as minor types in Falc6n Focus, but
whereas the latter two types do not extend far into northeastern Mexico, the Almagre type continues as far south
as southern Tamaulipas (Information from MacNeish).
An ancient connection with the Gary type of East Texas
seems possible, but if so this basic form was never used
to any extent in the large intervening area of Central
Texas; both Gamj and Almagre. points are exceedingly rare
there and the few known specimens appear to be intrusive
from both east and west, as seen in the grades of flint
used.
DISTRIBUTION
See paragraph above:
ESTIMATED AGE
May have appeared earliest in southern Tamaulipas, some
thousands of years before Christ, and lasted longest in
Pecos River Focus, until perhaps 500 A. D. or later. In
Falc6n Reservoir area, lower Rio Grande, type apparently
associated with middle post-glacial Rosita Terrace, roughly
between 3000 B. C. and time of Christ.

POGO POINTS
(Plate 78)
DESCRIPTION
Outline: Large triangular to leaf-shaped blade with considerable variation in edges from concave to straight and
convex. Shoulders vary from small (B, C) to square (G,
I, K, L) and well barbed (E, H, J). Stem slightly to
strongly contracting in some cases, parallel-edged in others. Base straight to convex.
Dimensions:

Total length varies from about 8 to 15 cm.

Stem

Â¥4 to 1/7 of total length. Maximum width 4 to 6 or 7 cm.,
usually across shoulders but may be farther forward (E).
Pogo points appear much too large for use on atlatl darts,
for in addition to large dimensions they are thick and
heavy; it is supposed they were used on spears orâ€™ lances.
Perhaps more than one type is indicated, for some may be
nothing more than very large Gary points (A-C, K).
CULTURAL AFFILIATIONS
Some found on non-pottery sites and presumed to belcng to
East Texas Aspect of Archaic Stage. Others occur on pottery sites which appear to belong exclusively to one or
another of the Caddoan foci, from which it is suspected that
the type may have been made until historic times, or nearly
so. Many of the specimens are made of novaculite, a material found in western Arkansas and eastern Oklahomai
others are ferruginous sandstone, flint, or chert.
DISâ€™TR ~IBUTION
Occurs sporadically in northeast Texas, never common on any
one site. Also occurs in adjacent parts of Louisiana, Arkansas, and Oklahoma, and perhaps more widely; no distribution study has been made.

ESTI~MATED AGE
Possibly from some time before Christ to early European times.

DART POINT TYPES
ABASOLO POINTS
(Plate 79)
DESCRIPTION
Outline:
Triangular to leaf-shaped blade with straight to
slightly convex edges. Base is weakly convex to well
rounded, almost semicircular, which is chief distinction
from closely related Tortugas points (Plate 120). Blade
often beveled, either along right or left edge of each
face; in some cases the edges are not so much beveled as
steeply chipped on both edges of one or both faces. Base
may be thinned to facilitate hafting.
Dimensions:

Length generally about 4 to 6 cm. but may range

as high as 8 cm. Width generally 2 to 3 cm. but may range
as high as 4.5 or 5 cm. Very similar to Catdn points (Plate
84) but distinctly larger. Also similar to Desmuke points
(Plate.8?) but base rounded rather than having converging
edges.
CULTURAL AFFILIATIONS
One of principal types (with Tortugas points) of Falc6n Focus
in southwest Texas, continuing southward to southern
Tamaulipas and northern and eastern Nuevo Leon in Mexico. Going northward into Texas, it appears in Pecos River
Focus, but only sporadically elsewhere, as in the Aransas
Focus on the central Gulf coast, Ed\vards Plateau Aspect,
and possibly the East Texas Aspect.
DISTRIBUTION
Most common in Rio Grande valley below Laredo and continuing into Tamaulipas, Mexico. Becomes progressively
less frequent eastward along Gulf coast and northward into
Central Texas and Pecos River mouth, but may be exÂ¯ pected to occur occasionally in all :parts of Texas except
extreme north and Panhandle.

AGE
Began between 5000 and 3000 B. C. and survived until perhaps
500 A. D. in most of distribution area, but apparently survived until 18th century along lower Rio Grande. Always
in pre-ceramic cultural association, so far as known.

ANGOSTURA POINTS
(Plate 80)

DESCRIPTION
Outline: Basically a narrow leaf shape with convex edges and
base considerably narrower than in other earl~y, lanceolate
forms. In many cases, perhaps due to excessive grinding
of proximal (lower) edges, there is a distinct inward curve
below the mid-section (B-D, F, H, V, W). In other cases,
there is a very faint shoulder below which the smoothed
stem edges are quite straight as they converge toward the
base (L, O-R, X). The broadest part is usually approximately at mid-section but may be slightly above or below;
rarely, it is well toward the tip (Y, Z) or near the base
(AA). The Angostura type is not known to include beveled edges, but specimens K-O have been included in
Plate 80 to show how closely some beveled specimens resemble the unbeveled ones. As the exact association of
such examples is unknown, it is not known whether they
are contemporaneous with the unbeveled points .or are
later, rechipped, and of a distinct type. The situation is
parallel to that of unbeveled Pla~nview points (Plate I16)
and beveled Meserve points (Plate 104).
Dimensions: Texas specimensâ€™range in length from about 5 to
10.5 cm., in maxlmum width from 1.8 to 4.2 cm., and in
base width from about 1.2 to 1.8 cm. The bases are thus
distinctly narrower than those of pIainvlew points although
th~ midsections are of about equal width if the largest examples (W, X, BB) are omitted.
CULTURAL AF~FILIATIONS
Undefined. In general, such artifacts are early post-glacial,
about same age and association as Plainview, ScottsbluS],
Eden, and Meserve points.

DISTRIBUTION
Great Plains. from Central Texas northward probably into
Canada.
ESTIMATED AGE
6000 to 4000 B. C., perhaps surviving later in Central Texas.
REFERENCES
First described by Hughes (1949) as Long points at the Long
Site in Angostura Reservoir basin in South Dakota. Now
generally referred to as Angostura points. Plate 80 examined by Hughes, who accepts all specimens as of this type
except beveled ones (K-O), and Y. Present description is
for Texas specimens; a complete survey of type throughout Great Plains is needed.

BULVERDE POINTS
(Plate 81 )
DESC~RIPTION
Outline:
Blade usually triangular with straight to slightly
convex edges, but occasionally strongly convex to leafshaped.
Shoulders sometimes squared (I, J, L, N, P,
U, W) but usually have short barbs. In a few cases, barbs
extend nearly to base of stem (S, X, Y), possibly indicating separate type although barbs of all lengths form a
continuous gradation around fairly uniform stem shape.
Stem usually rectangular or slightly contracting (C, F, L,
M) and characterized by wedge shape; that is, from shoulder area, stem is thinned evenly to very sharp edge at
base, with stem edges finely chipped. Base usually straight,
may be very slightly concave or convex.
Dimensions:
Total length ranges from about 4.5 to 9 cm.,
average about 6 cm. Stem usually ~.~ to 1/4 total length.
Stem width fairly uniform at 1.5 to 2 cm.
CU~LTU,RAL AFFILIATIONS
Primarily an Edwards Plateau Aspect type. occurring less
frequently in adjoining pre-ceramic complexes from Pecos
River Focus to East Texas Aspect and Aransas Focus on
coast, Closely related to Carrollton points (Plate 82) but
lacks stem smoothing of latter type. Occurs in association
with pottery in Alto Focus of Gibson Aspect in East Texas.
Also similar to Tray,s points (Plate 121) except for more
prominent shoulders and barbs, and wedge-stem, lacking
in Travis type. When slightly concave bases occur (I, O,
V), Bulverde type
(Plates 113-115).

CA~ROLLTON POINTS
(Plate 82, A-L)
DESCRIPTION
Outline: Triangular blade with prominent shoulders, squared
or barbed; blade edges straight to slightly convex. Stem
roughly rectangular, base straight to slightly convex. Stem
edges, and sometimes base, commonly smoothed.
Dimensions:

Total length ranges from about 3 to 6 cm., but

shortest specimens (A-C) probably reworked after tips
shattered. Stem ~ to nearly Â½ total length. Maximum
width acros~ shoulders 2.5 to 4 cm.
CULTURAL AFFILIATIONS
Reported as major type in Carrollton Focus of Trinity Aspect,
Archaic Stage. Occurs as minor type in East Texas Aspect
of Archaic Stage. Related to Bulverde points of Edwards
Plateau Aspect (Plate 81), but much less variation in
form, especially barbs, workmanship generally crude,
stems not wedge-shaped in longitudinal section, and Bulverde type lacks smoothing of stem edges and base.

DISTRIBUTION
Center of distribution appears to be in Dallas area, near junction of East Fork and Trinity River, with frequency decreasing toward northeast Texas.

CASTROVILLE POINTS
(Plate 83)
DESCRIPTION
Outline: Large triangular blade with edges often quite straight,
but sometimes slightly convex (D, I, J, L, O, S), concave
(B, K, P), or recurred (C, G, O). Shoulders occasionally
small (A, C, E), but strong barbs common. Barbs grade
from long, narrow (D, F, G, H, J) to massive with tips in
line with stem base (L-N, Q-T). In latter cases, artifact
probably blocked out first as large triangle with convex
base, then notches cut inward from base. One barb often
longer than other. Stems very broad and usually expand
with rather straight edges; they may also be nearly parallel-edged (B, D, E, K, P). Bases straight to convex. The
broad stems and general straightness of both stem and
blade edges usually form an easily recognized combination.
Dimensions: Total length about 5 to 9 or 10 cm., average about
7 cm. Width across shoulders or barbs ranges from 3 to 6
cm. Maximum stem width ranges from 2.4 to 3.6 cm. Stem
length usually 1/4 to {~{~ total length.
CULTURAL AFFILIATIONS
A

major type of Edwards Plateau Aspect, Archaic Stage.
Closely associated with Will~ams points (Plate 124) but
distinguished by greater width and angularity of stem, and
larger barbs; also similarities with Lange points (â€™Plate 97).

DISTRIBUTION
Common in Central Texas, decreasing toward North-Central
area and toward central coast.
ESTIMATED AGE
4000 B. C. to 1000 A. D. or greater part thereof.
RI~FERENCES
Kelley, 1947b (not illustrated); Miller and Jelks, 1952, p. 176
and Plate 23, No. 6 (Plate 23, No. 7 would now be classified as a Lange point, however). Bell and Hall, 1953, report this type as "common throughout Oklahoma, especially
in eastern section of state," but the examples they illustrate look like Williams points.

CATAN POINTS
(Plate 84)
DESCRIPTION
Outline:
Same as Abasolo points (Plate 79) and similarly
usually beveled on either right or left edge of both faces,
occasionally on both edges of one or both faces.
Dimensions: Smaller than Abasolo points, ranging from 2 to 4
cm. in length and 1.5 to 2.5 cm. in width. In dimensions
they could be classed as arrow points, but in thickness and
use of bevels they are like other dart points. Between 4
and 4.5 cm. in length they overlap the smallest "Abasolo
points.
CULTURA,L AFFILIATIONS
Linked with Matamoros points (Plate 103) as diagnostic types
of Mier Focus, Axchaic Stage, in Southwest Texas. The
two types are small counterparts of the Abasolo and
Tortugas types, respectively, and where there is control
over their associations, they appear in later periods than
the two larger types. In Tamaulipas and on the Texas
coast, Catdn and Matamoros points occur in association
with pottery whereas their larger coun.terparts are prepottery. AbasoIo and Tortugas points occur far inland in
Texas, but the two smaller types do not, as far as known.
DISTRIBUTION
From southern Tamaulipas to central Gulf coast of Texas, inland over Southwest Texas.

ESTIMATED AGE
May have first appeared about 500 A. D. and (at least in
Brownsville, Rockport, and Mier Foci) survived until the
18th century.

CLOVIS POINTS
(Plate 85)
This description is tentative; an adequate one must be made from
a study of fluted points wherever they occur in North America.
DESCRIPTION
Outline: Usually a narrow leaf shape with broadest part near
mid-section or somewhat farther toward the tip. In rare
cases the broadest part is at or near the base (F), forming
a triangle. The edges are usually convex but may be fairly
straight, especially toward the proximal (lower) end~
where they have been ground smooth. Excessive grinding
at proximal end occasionally produced recurved edges (G,
H, L, O, P). The two lateral projections near the base of
O are unique, and as edges are ground smooth above, belo~v, and over these projections, they must have been chipped that way originally. Compared with Folsom points
(Plate 92), the flutes of Clovis points are usually crudely
made and seldom reach as much as half way from base
toward tip; G is an exception. Sometimes more than a
single blow was needed to remove the flute (D, J, K).
Nearly al! known Clovis points are fluted but most have a
longer or more even-sided flute on one side than the
other. It is possible that some have no flutes, which would
make them very difficult to distinguish from some Plainview points (Plate 116). As on Plainview points, the bases
are always concave and often recurved with the concavity
rounding into the basal corners.
Dimensions: Length varies from about 6 to 14 cm. on specimens from Texas, width about 2 to 4 cm. While there is
no doubt that most Clovis points are considerably larg.er
and heavier than Folsom points, the two types overlap In
size, so that B-E are smaller than specimen M on Plate 92.
However, the thinness of FoIsom points makes them lighter; their flutes extend nearly to the tip in most cases, they
often have a small nipple in the middle of the basal concavity which is never seen in Clovis points, and the distribution and geological association of the two types are
quite distinct.
CULTURAL AFFILIATIONS
These specimens have been isolated finds for the most part.
On the basis of extensive excavations at the Blackwater
Draw Site near Clovis, New Mexico, by the University of
Pennsylvania Museum in the 1930â€™s and the Texas Memoria! Museum in recent years, Sellards (1952) has defined a Llano Complex which is characterized by Clovis
points. It remains to be seen how far beyond the southern Great Plains this complex is applicable. The Llano
Complex belongs to the Paleo-Amerman Stage herein.
DISTRIBUTION
â€™
Borax Lake Site in northern California and Naco Site in southern Arizona across United States to Atlantic seaboard; a
few specimens from Alaska, Durango, Mexico, and Costa
Rica. Examples from most parts of Texas.
ESTIMATED AGE
Somewhat greater than that of Folsorn points, probably at least
10,000 B. C. and perhaps as early as 15,000 B. C. at beginning. Excavated specimens in Great Plains and Arizona
repeatedly associated with extinct mammoths, animals
which did not certainly survive until Folsom times.

"DALLAS PENTAGONAL POINTS"
Crook and Harris (1954a, Plate 1, Nos. 12, 13) illustrate two examples of "Dallas Pentagonal points". An examination of
similar specimens from northeast Texas in the University of
Texas collections raises the question of whether these are sufficiently distinct from Carrollton and Elam points (Plate 82)
to warrant a separate type.
DA~RL POINTS
(Plate 86)
DESCRIPTION
Outline:
Blade usually a long, slender triangle with edges
straight to slightly convex. Shoulders vary from almost
none to slight, angular projections; barbs absent. Blade
commonly beveled, usually on right edge of both faces,
bevel being narrow and very steep. Blade edges sometimes very finely serrated, on beveled as well as unbeveled specimens: Stem edges parallel to flaring and sometimes well smoothed by grinding. Bases usually concave
from slightly to deeply, but may be straight (L, N, O, T,
Y, AA, DD). Stems sometimes beveled as well as blades.
Dimensions: Total length about 2.5 to 7 cm., average about 5
cm. Width 1 to 1.5 cm. Stem varies from nearly !/~ to as
little as 1/6 of total length.
CULTURAL AFFILIATIONS
Believed to have appeared toward end of Edwards Plateau
Aspect, Archaic Stage, and to have continued into Central
Texas Aspect, Neo-American Stage. Closely related to
Yarbrough type (Plate 125), with which there is considerable overlap in features and which occupies a similar
time position in East Texas, continuing from Archaic
Stage into Gibson Aspect of Neo-American Stage. Tendency toward extreme narrowness, concave base, and frequent beveling provide principal contrasts with Yarbrough
type.
DISTRIBUTION
Common in Central and North-Central Texas and westward to
Pecos River mouth.
ESTIMATED AGE
Possibly from about time of Christ to 1000 A. D.

"DENTON NU~-STEMMED POINTS"
Crook and Harris (1954a, Plate 1, Nos. 10, 11) illustrate two examples of "Denton Nub-Stemmed Points". The present authors regard these as falling within the range of Gary points
(Plate 94) and would include them with that type at least
until specific reasons are given for a subdivision.
DESMUKE POINTS
(Plate 87)
DESORIPTION
Outline: Small, shoulderless, roughly lozenge-shaped points.
Blade edges straight to convex; base contracts more or less
to point rather than being convex to semicircular as in
case of Abasolo points (Plate 79). Edges of base tend to
be straight, or one edge fairly straight while other may be
convex; base and blade frequently meet at a distinct angle.
Blades sometimes beveled along either right or left each
of both faces, but not as frequently as in Abasolo type.
Dimensions: Total length 3 to 5 cm., average about 4 cm.
Maximum width 1.5 to 2.5 cm. Cross-section may be thick
and diamond-shaped with ridge on each face.
CULTURAL AFFI.LIATIONS
Archaic Stage in Southwest Texas, probably belonging to
Falc6n or Mier Focus, or both, but most frequent in interior where no complexes have been accurately defined.
Probably related to both Abasolo and Catdn points (Plates
79, 84) but distribution much more limited than that of
either of the other types.
DISTRIBUTION
Apparently most frequent along middle parts of Frio and
Nueces River valleys, decreasing southward toward lower
Rio Grande, and toward coast in Nueces and Kleberg
Counties. Not recognized as yet along rest of Texas coast
or in Central Texas. Many specimens made of a white
quartzite (A-N) found in Duval, McMullen, and probably
other adjacent counties; elsewhere, made of various flints
(O-HH).
ESTIMATED AGE
Not determined.

EDEN POINTS

(Plate 92, P-R)
No satisfactory study of this type has been made, although Krieger
(1947a) and Wormington (1948) have argued for its distinction
from other types of the early post-glacial period. Its name derives from the Eden Valley in southwestern Wy.oming, where
both Eden and Scottsblu]] points were found m association
with extinct bison at the Finley Site (Moss, et al, 1951, describe
the geology of the site and illustrate the artifacts but do not
describe them or use type names).
Generally speaking, the Eden point is a long and very narrow
artifact, beautifully chipped with flake scars in more or less
matching pairs on both faces, meeting along a central ridge
("collateral chipping"). It is usually diamond-shaped in crosssection and has no shoulders. The basal edges are ground and
may be slightly narrower than the blade, due to excessive
grinding. The distribution of this type conforms essentially to
the High Plains, and in Texas it is confined to the Llano Estacado, so far as known. The estimated age is between about
7000 and 4000 B. C. although it may not have lasted the entire
span. Usually found with Scottsbluff type in Plains but not
nearly as widespread as the latter.
EDG]~WOOD POINTS
(â€™Plate 88)
DESCRIPTION
Outline: Short triangular blade with edges sometimes straight,
usually convex. Blade occasionally beveled on right edge
of both faces. Shoulders prominent to well barbed. Stem
edges expand widely with base often as wide as shoulders.
Base may be nearly straight (B, N, T) but is usually concave.
Dimensions: Total length about 3 to 5 cm., average about 4
cm. Maximum width 2 to 3 cm. Stem width usually 1.5 to
2 cm. and stem usually ~ to â€™~z total length.
CULTURAL AFFILIATIONS
Not common in any known complex but occurs with some
consistency in components of East Texas Aspect, Archaic
Stage, and to a lesser extent in Edwards Plateau Aspect.
Edgewood points resemble Ellis points (Plate 89) in size
and proportions, differing mainly in their concave bases.
As the two types appear to have about the same distribution in time and space, it may be argued that they should
be combined into one. Edgewood points also resemble
three of the larger Edwards Plateau Aspect types: Fairland, Fr~o, and Mart~ndale points (Plates 91, 93, 102) in
some respects and some of those on Plate 88 perhaps belong to these types. In general, Edgewood points are
smaller and broader in proportion to length than the above
Central Texas types, and lack basal notching,
DISTRIBUTION
Principally found in northeast Texas, and sporadically from
there toward Central and North-Central Texas, perhaps
also toward coastal plain.
ESTI,MATED AGE
Probably late in Archaic Stage, appearing shortly before or
after time of Christ.
REFERENCES
None.

ELAM POINTS
(Plate 82, M-U)

DESCRIPTION
Outline: Small, stubby blade with edges straight to convex.
Shoulders weakly developed to nearly absent. Stem roughly rectangular with edges parallel or slightly expanded or
contracted, base straight to slightly convex. Stem edges
often smoothed, base less often.
Dimensions: Total length about 2 to 3.6 cm., average 2.5 to 3
cm. Stem usually about half the total length, sometimes a
little more or less. Small size may indicate use as arrow
points, but thickness and workmanship compares with
other dart-point types.
CULTUB~&L AFFILIATIONS
Characteristic of Elam Focus in Archaic Stage, also occurring
as minor type in East Texas Aspect. Some overlapping
with Ellis points (compare T with Plate 89, C, D, H), but
shoulders generally less well developed, stem and blade
more equal in size, stem edges do not expand as much, and
consistently smaller in size range.

DISTRI~I~U.TION
Apparently most common in Dallas area in East Fork and
Trinity River valleys, fading out in northeast Texas, but
not known in any notable numbers anywhere.
ESTIMATED AGE
500 B. C. to 450 A. D. (,Crook and Harris, 1952).
REFERENCES
Crook and Harris, 1952: !954a, p. 11, Plate 6, Nos. 6-12, who
call the type "Elam Stemmed." Probably includes "Orla
Stemmed" of Stephenson (1949b).
ELLIS POINTS
(Plate 89)
DESCRIPTION
Outline: Short triangular blade with edges straight to convex,
occasionally slightly concave (A, G, Y). Shoulders prominent to well barbed. Stem expands toward base but never
as broad as shoulders; stem edges tend to be straighter
than in most types with cut-out corners. Bases straight to
convex.
Dimensions: Total length about 3 to 5 cm. Maximum width
across shoulders about 2 to 3 cm.; smaller specimens (B-E)
may have been re-chipped. Stems equal I/4 to nearly â€™~
of total length and are 1.5 to 2 cm. wide.
CULTbZRAL AFFILIATIONS
Widely distributed in Archaic Stage, more or less throughout
Texas except for Southwest section and probably the upper
Panhandle. Never numerous in ad~,. particular area but
may be of greatest relative frequency in East Texas Aspect.
In same area, type survived into association with pottery
in Alto Focus of Neo-American Stage (Newell and Krieger,
1949, pp. 166-167). Survival into pottery association is
possible but not proved in other areas. Although similar
in size and proportions to Edgewood points (~Plate 88),
Ellis appears to have a much wider distribution and lasted
somewhat later. An extended study would probably show

PLATE 89

422

Texas Archeological Society
this type to be very widespread in the eastern United
States in late Archaic and early Woodland cultural association, like Gary points (Plate 94), but less frequent.

DISTRIBUTION
See paragraph above.
ESTIMATED AGE
Possibly 1000 B. C. or earlier to 500 or 1000 A. D.

and Fig. 45; Bell and Hall, 1953. Specimens illustrated by
Stephenson (1949b, Plate 8, No. 20) appear to be closer
to Palmillas type (Plate 110) than to Ellis.
ENSOR POINTS
(Plate 90)
DESCRIPTION
Outline: Blade triangular and varying considerably in length
and width; edges often quite straight, otherwise slightly
convex, occasionally finely serrated. Shoulders vary from
slight to pronounced; barbs, if present, are short. Stems
very broad across neck, due to notches being shallow, and
bases commonly wider than shoulders so that basal corners are in line with blade edges. Occasionally base is
less wide than shoulders but shallow notches and broad
stem neck suggest Ensor type (Q, T, HH). Bases most
commonly straight but may be concave (G, I, M, R, U, V,
Z, BB, JJ) or convex (J, O, DD, EE).
Dimensions: Total length about 3 to 7 cm., average perhaps
5 cm. Maximum width across base or shoulders from 2 to
3 cm. Stem seldom more than 1 cm. long, therefore from
â€™~{~ to 1/7 of total length.
CULTURAL AFFILIATIONS
Edwards Plateau Aspect, probably relatively late in its total
span and continuing into Central Texas Aspect; also Pecos
River Focus and possibl:~: other cultural units in late Archaic or early Neo-Amerlcan Stage. Overlaps with Marcos
points (Plate 100) but the latter are generally larger, have
much deeper notches which produce narrower stem neck
and base always less wide than blade, and consequently
have longer barbs.
DISTRIBUTION
Occurs most frequently in Central Texas and lower Pecos
River area, decreasing southward toward lower Guadalupe
River and eastward to upper Sabine River.
ESTIMATED AGE
Possibly 1000 or 2000 B. C. to 500 or 1000 A. D.

FAIRLAND POINTS
(Plate 91 )
DESCRIPTION
Outline:
Triangular blade with edges sometimes straight,
usually convex. Shoulders narrow, seldom barbed. Stem
formed by long, shallow notches so that strongly flaring
base usually as wide as, or wider than, shoulders. Base
characterized by wide, deep concavity which produced
very sharp corners; unusually fine edge-chipping makes the
bases thinner and sharper than they appear in the photographs. Blade edges sometimes finely serrated, rarely
beveled.
Dimensions:

Total length about 3.5 to 7 cm., average perhaps

5 cm. Maximum width across shoulders or base about 2
fo 3 cm. Stem 1/5 to nearly ~ of total length.
CULTURAL AFFILIATIONS
Edwards Plateau Aspect, Archaic Stage, but not as common
as several other types. Some resemblance to Darl points
(Plate 86) but Fairtand much wider, stem corners flare
outward more widely with sharper, tips, stem edges not
smoothed nor blade beveled as much as in Darl type. Differs from Edgewood points (Plate 88) in having smaller
shoulders, much longer outward and downward sweeping
notches, and sharper, thinner stem corners.

DISTRtBU~rION
Central Texas.
ESTIMATED AGE
Possibly not as long-lived as more common types of Edwards
Plateau Aspect; say about 1000 B. C. to 500 A. D. or part
thereof.

FOLSOM POINTS
(Plate 92, A-O)
DESCRIPTION
Outline: Usually leaf-shaped with broadest part near middle
or somewhat forward of middle; in some cases it is far
forward, closer to the tip (M); in others the edges are
parallel part of the distance forward (D, E, N). Base
always concave, sometimes very deeply so, with small
nipple or protrusion in center (B, D, E, I, L, M). Channel
or flute removed nearly full length from both faces, making central sections very thin (A-N). In some cases, flute
occurs on one face only. It is now becoming recognized
that some Folsom points are unfluted, being too thin for
this, while the general outline, deep basal concavity, and
nipple occur as on fluted specimens (O). While the central nipple is sometimes called the ?striking platform"
(for removal of the flutes), this function may be disproved by its occurrence on unfluted specimens. The
blade edges are almost always smoothed by grinding from
the base about as far forward as the point of greatest
width.
Dimensions: Length ranges from about 3 to 8 cm., most specimens from Texas and elsewhere being from 3 to 5 cm.
Widths range from 1.6 to 2.8 cm. The largest one shown
cM) is a giant for this type and is larger than some
Iovis points (-Plate 85) ; A and B are also unusually large.
Interestingly, all three of these large examples are from
Uvalde County in the southwestern section of Central
Texas. On the whole, Fo/som points are quite small, a
matter generally obscured by their confusion for many
years with Clovis points. Also, due to their thinness, they
usually weigh much less than Clovis points even when
approaching the latter in size.
CULTURAL ~ILIATIONS
Generally associated with so-called "Folsom culture" although
this complex has never been defined. FoIsom points have
been found in several cases with extinct Pleistocene bison
species, spall scrapers, snub-nosed scrapers, tiny gravers.
and a few other artifacts. When found under controlled
conditions, they seldom occur in the same association :with
the older Clovis points on the one hand, or the later
Scottsblu]], Eden. Plainview, Meserve, and Angostura
points (the so-called "Yuma points") on the other.
DISTRIBUTION
Great Plains from south-central Canada to central Texas,
including eastern and central New Mexico, and extending almost to Gulf coast of Texas. Much more restricted
than that of Clovis points, although due to the fact that
the latter have dften been called "Folsomoid", "Folsomlike", and "Generalized Folsom" points, this important
difference in distribution has usually been obscured in the
literature.
ESTIMATED AGE
Approximately 8000 B. Co, based on a radiocarbon date of
98834---300 years ago, obtained from bison bone in the
Folsom level of the Lubbock, Texas, city reservoir site
(Sellards, 1952). This one date does not reveal the whole
span of time for Folsom artifacts, but these had given way
to other types by approximately 7000 B. C.

FRIO POI.NTS
(Plate 93)
DESCRIPTION
Outline: Triangular blade which is often short and broad,
edges usually straight to convex but also fairly often concave or recurved (D, E, R, W, CC, DD, EE). Shoulders
occasionally weakly developed (A-C, L, T, Z, AA) but
usually strong or with good barbs. Stem formed by corner
notches, often as wide as, or wider than, shoulders. Base
always concave but in many cases recurred due to a deep
U-shaped notch in center (A, B, D, F-L, O-T, V, X, Z, BB,
DD) ; in others, the notch is not prominent but the recurred
basal edge suggests that it was chipped with this principal
in mind (remaining specimens).
Dimensions:

Total length about 3 to 7 cm., average perhaps

5 cm. Maximum width across shoulders or base 2 to 4 cm.
Stem ~,~ to 1/6 of total length.
CULTURAL AFFILIATIONS
Minor type in Edwards Plateau Aspect and Pecos River Focus,
Archaic Stage. The smaller specimens (A-P) resemble
Edgewood points (Plate 88). Some resemblance to Fairland points (Plate 91) but basal corners rounded or squared
rather than sharply pointed, and corner notches of different shape. Also some resemblance to Martindale points
(Plate 102) but lacks the two-curve "fish-tail" basal edge
of the latter.
DISTRIBUTION
General in Central Texas but apparently more common in
western portions and extending to lower Pecos River or
farther. Also in south-central portion.

F_~TIMATED AGE
Possibly 2000 or 3000 B. C. to 500 A. D.

GARY POINTS
(Plate 94)

DESCRIPTION
Outline: Triangular blade with edges usually straight to convex but sometimes concave or recurved (C, F, H, J, U, W,
X). Shoulders may be small but usually flare out widely
almost at right angles; barbs, if present at all, are short
(I). Stems usually contract strongly to pointed or somewhat rounded base but may at times approach being parallel-sided (I).
Dimensions: Total length about 4 to 8 cm., occasionally a little
shorter (C) or longer (S). Maximum width across shoulders 2 to 5 cm. Stems more constant in length than blades,
so that on shorter specimens (A, C-F) stem about ~ total
length, on longer ones â€™~.~ to â€™/4.
CULTURAL AFFILIATIONS
Common in East Texas Aspect, Archaic Stage, surviving into
association with pottery in Alto Focus and possibly other
foci of both Gibson and Fulton Aspects. Neo-American
Stage, in Caddoan area. May have survived almost to
Historic Stage in some localities in Caddoan area (e.g., in
McCurtain Focus). Also occurs very widely in Eastern
United States in Archaic Stage and in early Woodland
period with pottery, even more widely than do Ellis points
(Plate 89). Wells points (Plate 123) resemble Gary but
are narrower in proportion to length, the stems are consistently about ;4 the total length and usually well smoothed, and Wells points are of much more limited distribution,
being virtually confined to East, Central, and the eastern
end of North-Central Texas in our present knowledge.
The smaller Gary points somewhat resemble Langtry points
(Plate 98) and the larger, crudely chipped ones (V-Y)
closely resemble Almagre points (Plate 77), both of which
occur in Pecos River Focus and down Rio Grande ~o FalcSn
area. However, none of the three types (Gary, Langtry,
Almagre) occurs as an established type in the large intervening area of Central Texas to provide an historical connecting link. On the other hand, all three should be on
approximately the same time level in eastern and western
Texas, and they may have been historically connected at
one time, never gaining any favor in the central area
where so many other styles were common.
ESTIMATED AGE (Texas only)
Possibly 2000 B. C. to 1000 A. D. for the most part, then possibly being retained in some foci as late as 1500 or 1600 A.
D. They are consistently collected on the same sites with
Caddoan pottery types, but specific data on association is
lacking except in Alto Focus.

JUNO BROAD BASE POINTS
See Ensor points (Plate 90).
KENT POINTS
(Plate 95)
DESCRIPTION
Outline: Blade crudely triangular, often asymmetrical, edges
usually convex but not in same degree; may be rather
straight (G, K, N, T, V, AA) and in a few cases, concave
(D, L, P): Shoulders weakly developed to right-angular;
barbs (V, AA) uncommon and stronger on one side than
other. Stems more or less parallel-edged, but like blades,
usually poorly chipped and uneven. Bases usually convex,
occasionally straight (P, Q, U, BB). Rarely, blade beveled.
Dimensions: Total length 3.5 to 7 cm., occasionally a little
more or less, average about 4 to 5 cm. Maximum width
across shoulders 1.5 to 3 cm. Stem ~ to 1/5 total length,
1 to 1.5 cm. wide. Due to crude chipping, these specimens
are usually notably thicker than other types. Those from
Central Texas (W, X, BB) are generally larger than those
from coast.
CULTU~RAL AFFILIATIONS
Most common in Aransas Focus, Archaic Stage; infrequent in
Edwards Plateau Aspect and East Texas Aspect. Somewhat resemble Yarbrough points (Plate 125) but more
crudely chipped and asymmetrical, lack stem smoothing,
expanded stem edges, and frequently straight bases of
latter--differences which are more striking on actual specimens than photographs can indicate.
DISTRIBUTION
Central portion of Coastal area~

northeastward to Addicks

Reservoir area west of Houston and into East Texas area;
northward into Central Texas. Frequency decreases going
inland from Coastal area.

ESTIMATED AGE
Probably relatively late in Archaic Stage, in Christian era.

KINNEY POINTS
(Plate 96)
DESCRIPTION
Outline: Triangular to leaf-shaped blade, edges almost straight
in some cases (P, Q, T, V) but usually convex. On longer
and narrower specimens the edges may be almost parallel
for some distance forward from base. In rare cases, lower
edges are smoothed (I, W) and specimen may be confused
with Plainview points (,Plate 116). Bases always concave,
from slightly (J, K, X) to deeply (F, I, P), usually in
single broad arc but occasionally in recurve (I, N, V, Z).
Dimensions:

Length 4.5 to 11 cm., maximum width about 2 to

3.5 cm. However, it is quite possible that longest and
broadest specimens (or even all of them) are knives
rather than projectile points, but there seems to be no
feasible way to distinguish them. It seems possible that
at least some of the "Kinney points" were used as projectile points, particularly those which are of symmetrical
outline with thinned, concave bases (such as F, P-R), and
these grade imperceptibly into larger and heavier specimens which are probably knives (S-AA). It seems better
to illustrate the range than to attempt at this time to decide which should be called knives.
CULTURAL AFFILIATIONS
â€™Minor type in Edwards Plateau Aspect, Aransas Focus, Pecos
River Focus, and FalcSn Focus, all in Archaic Stage. Similar in shape and distribution to Tortugas points (Plate
120) but larger on the whole, unbeveled, and grade from
triangular to leaf-shaped. Also resemble Pandora and
Re]ugio points (Plates 112, 117), but these have straight
and convex bases, respectively, and differ somewhat in
general proportions and distribution.
DISTRIBUTION
Most frequent from central coast inland northwestward toward
Pecos River mouth.
ESTIMATED AGE
Possibly 1000 or 2000 B. C. to 1000 A. D.

LANGE POINTS
(Plate 97)
DESCRIPTION
Outline: Large triangular blade with edges straight to convex, occasionally concave or recurved (B, E, R, U, X).
.Shoulders prominent and often well barbed (C, J, M, S,
U, W, X). Stem edges expand and are often straight, resembling those of Castroville type (Plate 83) but not as
wide.

Base almost always straight but may be slightly

concave or convex.
Dimensions: Total length about 5 to 8.5 cm. (stubby specimens like E-G may have reworked blades). Maximum
width across shoulders 2.7 to 4 cm. Stems 1.7 to 2.5 cm.
wide at base and ~A to 1/5 of total length.
CULTI2RAL AFFILIATIONS
Primarily Edwards Plateau Aspect, extending into East Texas
Aspect, Aransas ~Focus on coast, and toward plains below
Panhandle. Although quite similar to Castrov~lle points
(Plate 83), the stems are generally less wide, the long and
massive barbs which align with the base are absent, the
bases are usually straight rather than convex, the blade
edges are somewhat more variable, and Lange points are
considerably more widespread than Castroville, which so
far as known, are typical only of Edwards Plateau Aspect.
The stems are comparable in shape to those of Marshall
points (Plate 101) but are longer, and the blades lack the
massive roundness of the latter.
DI STRI.BUTION
Most common in Central Texas, extending with decreasing frequency into East Texas, toward the central coast, and
northwestward into the plains.
ESTIMATED AGE
About 4000 B. C. to 1000 A. D. or greater part thereof.
R]gFERENCES
None, unless included in Castroville type by Kelley, Miller and
Jelks. Some of present specbnens may be Cas~rovi~le, particularly B, E, L, M, U.

LANGTRY POINTS
(Plate 98)
DESC~RIPTION
Outline: Triangular blade with edge~ stra!ght to concave 0r
recurved, seldom convex, which ~s umque among Texas
dart-point types.
Usually exceedingly thin and finely
chipped, even the largest ones. Shoulders prominent to
widely outflaring, often uneven (A, E, G, J): barbs may
sweep widely outward (Q, R, V). Stems long, contracting,
at times nearly parallel-edged (B-E, I-K, R, Y) or even
expanding slightly (L, M). Bases are usually concave,
even when stem contracts strongly (A, H, N, S, T, BB),
but may be straight or (rarely) convex. Possibly more
than one type is represented, but features intergrade so
that separation difficult.
Dimensions: Total length about 4 to 7 cm, average about 6
cm. Maximum width across shoulders about 2.2 to 4 cm.
Base .6 to 1.6 cm. wide. Stem often ~ total length but
ranges to ~/4.
CULTURAL AFFILIATIONS
Common type of Pecos River Focus and, with Shumla points
(Plate 119), diagnostic of that focus. Extends down Rio
Grande valley as minor type in FalcSn Focus: occurs
rarely in Edwards Plateau Aspect but uncertain ~vhether
made there or intrusive from Pecos River Focus. Some
larger, thicker, and considerably heavier specimens designated as a "crude variety" of Langtry type have here
been placed in Almagre type (Plate 77), which has distinct distribution. Certain Langtry points with contracting
stem and convex base (F, G) closely resemble some Gary
points (Plate 94) in East Texas, but a firm connecting link
through Central Texas is lacking (see discussion under
Gary points).

DISTRIBUTION
Apparently centered in Pecos River-Rio Grande eonfluence
area, extending over adjacent parts of Trans-Pecos Texas
and northern Coahuila in the general Big Bend Area, and
southeastward down Nueees and Rio Grande valleys about
as far as MeMullen and Starr Counties, respectively. Also
occurs in Tamaulipas panhandle next to Rio Grande valley.
ES"TIMATI~D AGE

LERMA POINTS
(Plate 99)
I~ESCRIPTION
Outline:
Usually long, slender, double-pointed leaf-shaped
blade, although one end may be somewhat more rounded
than pointed (B, D, J, K, P), and a few specimens are
rather broad (A, H, N, P). It is not thought that all are
projectile points, for the broader ones, at least, may be
double-pointed knives. However, for the most part their
thickness and steep edges make them unsuitable for knives
and their symmetry suggests the balance needed for projectile points. They are thickest in the middle and thinned down enough at one end to be halted.
Dimensions:

Length 5.5 to

10 cm., most being 6 or 7 cm.

Maximum width 2 to 3 cm., at middle or close to it.
CULTURAL AFFILIATIONS
Minor type in Edwards Plateau Aspect, Pecos River Focus,
and perhaps Aransas Focus, all of Archaic Stage. Similar
to ReSugio points (Plate 117) when one end tends to be
somewhat rounded; however, they have a distinct distribution in northern ,Mexico as well as Texas.
DISTItIBUTION
Western part of Central Texas to Pecos River mouth, southward to central coast and Southwest Texas, and south of
Rio Grande to southern Tamaulipas.
ESTIMATED AGE
Possibly appeared earliest in southern Tamaulipas, several
thousand years before Christian era: in Texas from well
before time of Christ to somewhat after.

MARCOS POINTS
(Plate I00)
DESCRIPTION
Outline:

Generally broad triangular blade with edges straight,

slightly convex, or gently recurved. Always barbed because deep notches cut into corners at about 45 degree
angle; barb tips frequently in line with base (A, B, H, M,
N, R, S-U). Angle of notches also always makes stem
strongly expanding; bases straight to convex, rarely
slightly concave (K, V), generally not as wide as barbs.
Dimensions:

Total length 4.5 to 9 or 10 cm., average 5 or 6

cm. Maximum width across barbs about 3 to 4.5 cm. Stem
base about 2 to 3 cm. wide and stem rather consistently
about 1 cm. long, thus 1/5 to 1/9 of total length.

CULTURAL AFFILIATIONS
Minor type of Edwards Plateau Aspect and Pecos River Focus,
Archaic Stage. Bears resemblances to Ensor points (Plate
90) but is distinguished by deeper notches and narrower
stem neck in proportion to blade width, and is generally
broader with much longer barbs. Also bears resemblances
to CastrovilIe points (Plate 83) but stems not as broad
across neck and expand more sharply, notches cut inward
from corner rather than upward from base, and massive
squared barbs of latter absent. As with most types, individual specimens are often difficult to assign to one or
another with complete confidence.
DISTRIBUTION
Approximately from lower Pecos River valley across central
Texas to middle Brazos River, and from Possum Kingdom
Reservoir area on upper Brazos southward to central
Coastal area.
ESTIMATED AGE
Possibly 2000 B. C. to 1000 A. D. or greater part thereof.
REFERENCES

None.

MARSHALL POINTS
(Plate 101 )
DESCRIPTION
Outline: Blade varies from triangular to broad oval, edges
from nearly straight to greater part of a semicircle. Shoulders always strongly barbed, the more massive barbs commonly being in line with the base. Notches may have removed most of corner (A-C, E, G, P) but usually were
cut upward into the blade from the base. Stem may be
parallel-sided (A-,H, J, K) or slightly expanded, and is
often quite short in proportion to the massive blade. Base
straight or slightly concave or convex.
Dimensions:

Total length about 5 to 11.5 cm., most between 6

and 8 cm. Maximum width about 3 to 5 Cmo, across barbs
or middle of blade. Stems 1.2 to 2.5 cm. wide and Â¥4 to b~
of total length.
CULTURAL A~ILIATIONS
A common type of Edwards Plateau Aspect. Those with parallel-sided stems and slightly concave bases approach closely
to the Pedernales points with the least concave bases
(Plate 114, H-M) and some of them may actually be
Pedernales points; however, typical Pedernales points have
notably deeper bases than Marshall points (Plates 113-115)o
DISTRIBUTION
Common only in Central Texas; occurs infrequently in NorthCentral Texas.
ESTIMATED AGE
Possibly 3000 or 4000 B. C. to 1000 A. D. or greater part thereof.
REFERENCES
None, except that some such specimens were probably included
in groups called "Smithwick Small Stem" and "Bluffton
Barbed" by Kelley (1947b, p. 124 and Plate 14, B, I).

M/kRTIN, DALE POINTS
(Plate 102)
DESCRIPTION
Outline: Triangular blade with edges sometimes straight, usually convex. Shoulders pronounced to well-barbed, but
barbs seldom reach to base (.P, R, V, Z). Stem varies from
nearly parallel-edged (E, P) to strongly expanding. The
most distinguishing feature of these points is that the
base is formed by two distinct convex curves meeting in a
depression in the center, a "fish-tail" best seen in specimens C, D, I, J, M, Q, S, T, Y, Z-CC. On other specimens
the base appears to be a simple recurve but close examination shows the double-convex "fish-tail". It is assumed
that this form of base was the result of deliberate effort
setting it apart from other bases.
Dimensions:

Total length 3.5 to 7 cm, average 4 to 5 cm.

Maximum width across shoulders 2.5 to 4.5 cm. Stems 2 to
3.5 cm. wide and 1/5 to nearly ~ total length.
CULTURAL AFFILIATIONS
Minor type of Edwards Plateau Aspect, similar to Frio and
Uvalde points (Plates 93, 122). These three types are distinct mainly in the shape of the stem and method of indenting the base, but they also have somewhat different distributions.

DISTRIBUTION
Central Texas only, so far as known.
ESTIaMATED AGE
Possibly 3000 or 4000 B. C. to 1000 A. D. or greater part thereof.
REFERENCES
Miller and Jelks, 1952, p. 176 and Plate 23, No. 9 mention this
type but illustrate what appears to be a Fr~o point. The
same applies to that illustrated by Bell and Hall (1953,
Plate ~). who have wrongly identified this type as common in Oklahoma.

MATAMOROS POINTS
(Plate 103)

DE~CRIFrION
Outline: Same as Tortugas points (Plate 120) and similarly
usually beveled on either right or left edge of both faces,
occasionally on ,both edges of one or both faces.
Dimensions: Smaller than Tortugas points, ranging from 2 to
4 cm. in length and 1.5 to 2.5 cm. in width. In dimensions
these could be classed as arrow points, but in thickness and
use of bevels they are like other dart points. Between 4 and
4.5 cm. in length they overlap the smallest Tortugas points.
CULTURAL ~_FFI, LIATIONS
Linked with Catdn points (Plate 84) as diagnostic types of
Mier Focus, Archaic Stage, in Southwest Texas. The two
types are small counterparts of the Tortugas and Abasolo
types, respectively, and where there is control over their
associations, they appear in later periods than the two
larger types. In Tamaulipas and on the Texas coast, Matamoros and Catdn points occur in association with pottery
whereas their larger counterparts are pre-pottery. Tortugas and Abasolo points occur far inland in Texas, but the
two smaller types do not, as far as known.
DISTRIBUTION
From southern Tamaulipas to central Gulf coast of Texas, inland over Southwest Texas.
ESTIMATED AGE
May have first appeared about 500 A. D. and (at least in
Brownsville, Rockport, and Mier Foci) survived until historic times in the 18th century.

MF~ERVE POINTS
(Plate 104)
DF,SC:RIPTION
Outline: Lower part like Plainview points (Plate 116), upper
part modified by beveling or re-shaping of broken blade.
The lower parts retain the smoothed edges of Pla~nview
points, from which it is probable that some of them actually were Plainview points at one time. The shortest
blades were in most cases obviously given new points
after being broken, in the course of which some were
beveled, usually on the right edge of both faces (A-C, E,
F, K, M, Q, S, AA, BB), but others were plain (D, G, N,
U). Some of the longer ones probably were made with
beveled edges originally (H-J, L, O, P, 1R, T, V-Z). Both
beveled and unbeveled examples sometimes have finely
serrated edges (T-BB). Neither beveling nor serration
occurs on true Plainview points.
Dimensions: Total length about 3 to 8 or 9 cm. Blade much
more variable than stem (smoothed part), which, unless
reduced in length by secondary chipping, is 2 to 3 cm. long.
Maximum width about 2 to 2.7 cm., same as Plainview
points; basal concavity (simple arc or recurve) also like
that of Plainview.
CULTU,RAL AFFILIATIONS
Some are isolated finds, not definitely associated with any
known complexes in Texas; others belong to Edwards
Plateau Aspect, East Texas Aspect, and other Archaic complexes. Some have been collected on pottery sites.
DISTRIBUTION
Virtually entire State but very rare in Trans-Pecos Texas;
Great Plains; Louisiana, Arkansas, Missouri, etc.
ESTIMATED AGE
Probably cover great time span, depending on when original
specimen was picked up and re-worked. In Nebraska
some are as old as Plainview points (Davis, 1953), showing
that principal of beveling was known in Paleo-American
Stage, at least in Nebraska. Beveling was not widespread.
however, until the Archaic Stage, to which most such specimens probably belong.

points" for several years in the Archaic Stage of Missouri. An extended description of Meserve points, by

MONTELL POINTS
(Plate 105)

DESCRIPTION
Outline: Triangular blade with edges sometimes straight but
also commonly convex (G, N, T), concave (A, E, F, K, OQ), or recurred (J, L, W, X). Shoulders sometimes squared but more often have barbs from small to large, sometimes aligned with base (G, J, N, T-X). Stem occasionally
parallel-edged but usually expands and is split in center
with a deep V-shaped notch. The notch may occasionally
be somewhat rounded (Q-S) but this clear bifurcation of
the stem is an easily recognizable feature. The base itself
was almost always strongly convex before the notch was
made.
Dimensions:

Total length about 4 to 10 cm, most being about

6 to 7 cm. Maximum width across shoulders or middle of
blade seldom less than 3 cm. and may range to 5 cm.
Maximum width of stem 2 to 3 cm.; stem length quite
uniform at about 1 cm., thus V4 to 1/10 of total length.
CULTUB,AL A~FFILIATIONS
Occurs in Edwards Plateau Aspect and Pecos River Focus, but
not among most common types of either. Not known as
established type in other complexes.
DISTRIBUTION
Central Texas and westward to Pecos River mouth, possibly
into Big Bend area.
ESTIMATED AGE
Possibly 2000 or 3000 B. C. to 500 or 1000 A. D.
REFERENCES
Kelley, 1947b, p. 124 and Plate 14, F, considers this type diagnostic of a "Uvalde Focus".

MORHISS POINTS
(Plate 106)
DESCRIPTION
Outline: Triangular blade with edges almost always convex
(L has straight edges but may be a Bulverde point).
Shoulders generally small, from hardly visible (C, H) to
right-angular. Barbs, if present, very small (E, L). Stem
parallel-edged with convex base to somewhat contracted
with straight to convex base. In general, stem very broad
and rounded with blade not greatly wider.
Dimensions:

Total length about 5 to 9 cm., average 7 to 8 cm.

Maximum width across shoulders about 2.~ to 4 cm. Maximum stem width about 1.8 to 2.5 cm.; stems ~z.~ to 1/5 of
total length. One of largest and heaviest types classed as
dart points in Texas.
CULTURAL A~FILIATIONS
Minor type in complex not yet well defined, for which Morhiss
Site in Victoria County is principal known component.
This site has numerous chipped-stone artifact types of
both Aransas Focus and Edwards Plateau Aspect, Archaic
Stage, which is expected from its position near the boundary between Central Texas and the Coastal Plain. The
Morh~ss type, however, appears to be a rather local development which is uncommon both toward the open coast
and the interior.

DISTRI~BUTION
See paragraph above.
ESTIMATED AGE
Possibly 2000 B. C. to 1000 A. D.
REFERENCES
None. Similar specimens may be included in "Garcetas Broad
Base" points (Kelley, 1947a, p. 104).

MORRILL POINTS
(Plate 107)
DESCRIPTION
Outline: Long, slender artifacts with triangular blade, edges
straight to slightly convex. Shoulders very weak and in
some cases (N, V, X) virtually absent. Stem usually parallel-edged, occasionally slightly expanded or contracted. Stein
edges often smoothed; base straight, occasionally slightly
concave or convex. Blade edges may be finely serrated
(M, N, V,/kA).
Dimensions:

Total length 4.5 to 8 cm. but shortest specimens

are of crude workmanship (A-I) and of questionable classification. The more definite specimens (J-BB) are rather
uniform in length at 5.5 to 8 cm., with most between 6
and 7 cm. Width across blade of most definite specimens
very uniform at 2 to 2.5 cm. (J-BB, except O). Stems 1.5
to 2 cm. long, ~, to V4 of total length; occasionally nearly

~. (s, v).
CULTURAL AFFILIATIONS
~Minor type of East Texas
linked with Wells points
continuing into pottery
American Stage. Similar

Aspect, Archaic Stage. Closely
(Plate 12-3) in East Texas, bath
association in Alto Focus, Neoto Travis points in Edwards Pla-

teau Aspect (Plate 121) but latter more variable in stem
shape, base, and lack smoothing of stem edges.

DISTRIBUTION
Primarily in central part of East Texas area, possibly occurring
rarely in remainder of East Texas and eastern part of
Central Texas. The crudest points are generally of reddish
chert, difficult to shape, while the best ones are of flint,
so that it is difficult to determine which chert specimens
should be included.
ESTIMATED AGE
Possibly 1000 B. C. to 500 or 1000 A. D.

NOLAN POINTS
(Plate 108)
DESCRIPTION
Outline: Triangular blade of greatly variable length and width,
edges convex or recurved, seldom straight. A slender,
needle-sharp tip often results from convergence of recurved edges (~D, E, G, J, N, R). Shoulders may be almost
absent (E, F, H, K) but usually strong and slant toward
tip; barbs absent. Stem varies from narrow to broad, generally parallel-edged but sometimes expanded or contracted slightly. Bases usually straight but may be convex
and in rare cases slightly concave (E). The type is most
easily recognized by strong, steep bevels on the stem,
usually along the right edge of both faces, occasionally
on left edge. Rarely, blade is beveled too.
Dimensions:

Total length about 4.5 to 13 cm. Maximum width

2 to 4 cm. Stems 1.1 to 3 cm. wide but most between 1.5
and 2 cm. Stem length fairly uniform at about 2 cm. from
base to top of curve into shoulder.
CULTI~RAL AFFILIATIONS
Major type of Edwards Plateau Aspect; minor type in Pecos
River Focus and Aransas Focus, all in Archaic Stage. Possibly survives into association with pottery in Henrietta
Focus and Central Texas Aspect, but if so, such specimens
are very poorly made. Those in Pecos River and Aransas
Foci notably smaller and less well made than in Edwards
Plateau Aspect.
DISTRIBUTION
Throughout Central Texas, extending to upper Brazos River
drainage, lower Pecos River, and central Coastal area.
ESTIMATED AGE
Entire life of Edwards Plateau Aspect, possibly 4000 B. C. to
500 or 1000 A. D.
REFERENCES
Kelley, 1947a, p. 99 and Plate I0, D refers to this type as
"Nolan Beveled Stem" and considers it as the diagnostic
trait of his "Clear Fore Focus" although it occurs throughout the Edwards Plateau Aspect; he includes C. N. Rayâ€™s
"Clear Fork Dart Points 1 and 2" within it. Also Miller
and Jelks, 1952, pp. 1"/5-176; Campbell, 1952, p. 68 and

PAISANâ€™O POINTS
(Plate 109, A-L)
DESCRIPTION
Outline: Little data available; specimens A-L believed to be
characteristic. Blade triangular with convex edges which
are frequently serrated.

Stem

formed

by shallow

side

notches, hence shoulders weak or absent (B, D, G, J, K).
Stem consists of two protrusions flaring outward at about
45 degree angle to nearly downward (D, L). Stem corners
rounded, base concave to deeply indented.
Dimensions:

From data available, length about 3.5 to 6 cm.,

width across shoulders about 1.6 to 2.5 cm. Stem V4 to 1/6
of total length.
CULTURAL AFFILIATIONS
So far, said to be typical only of Chisos Focus in Big Bend
area. As chipped-stone artifacts of any kind are uncommon in this focus, the Paisano type is one of the most
scantily represented in Texas, yet it seems distinctive. In
its shal!ow side notches it somewhat resembles the Ensor
type (Plate 90). The stems somewhat resemble those of
San Patrice points.
DISTRIBUTION
Southern part of Trans-Pecos Texas (Big Bend).
ESTI~MATED AGE
Possibly 800 to 1200 A. D.

PALMILLAS POINTS
(Plate 110)
DESCRIPTION
Outline: Small triangular to leaf-shaped blade, edges straight
to convex, occasionally concave (E) or recurved (U, II,
JJ). Shoulders vary from slight (G, P, Q-S, X, GG) to
well barbed (A, B, T, Y, Z, AA, KK) and various grades
in between. Chief characteristic is small bulbous stem,
with expanded, rounded sides and convex base. Occasionally specimens with straight base probably should be included (W, X, BB).
Dimensions: Total length about 3 to 6 cm.; longer specimens
(FF, II-LL) may belong to Williams type instead (Plate
124). Maximum width across shoulders about 1.7 to 3 cm.
Stems 1 to 2 cm. wide and ~ to 1/6 of total length.
CULTU,RAL AFFILIATIONS
A minor type in most complexes of Archaic Stage in various
parts of Texas. Probably late in this stage, surviving in
some areas into Neo-American Stage. Similar to Williams
points (Plate 124) but smaller and probably later.
DISTRIBUTION
From East Texas across state to Trans-Pecos area, and from
upper Brazos and Trinity valleys to central and eastern
coastal plain. Although very widespread, does not appear
to be common in any particular area.
in Mexico to southern Tamaulipas.

Extends southward

ESTIMATED AGE
Probably within Christian era.

PANDALE POINTS
(Plate 111)
DESCRIPTION
Outline:

Long and slender blade, more often leaf-shaped than

triangular, edges usually strongly convex, occasionally
straight (A) or recurved to long needle-like tip (I, P, Y).
Shoulders poorly developed, often absent. Type most easily
recognized by beveling of blade so strongly that it is more
like a propeller in cross-section than the ordinary edgebevel; that is, the twist begins along the centerline of the
blade rather than near the edge. Stems are also beveled,
but in opposite direction from blade, so that artifact has
peculiar cork-screw twist, the purpose of which is unknown, The photographs fail to show this adequately.
Stems variable, from parallel-edged to somewhat expanded or contracted, and bases straight, concave, or convex.

Dimensions:

Total length about 3.5 to 9 cm., most between 5

and 7 cm. Maximum width across shoulders or middle of
blade about 1.5 to 3 cm. Stems 1 to 1.5 cm. wide and ~ to
1/7 of total length.
CULTURAL AFFILIATIONS
Belongs primarily to Pecos River Focus, extending rarely into
Edwards Plateau Aspect. In general outline of stem and
blade it is similar to Nolan type (Plate 108), but this lacks
beveled blades. In outline it is also somewhat similar to
the Travis type (Plate 121), which lacks the combination
of twisted blade and beveled stem. While the blades of
many types will sometimes be twisted because the original
flint flake was not very well flattened by chipping, Pandale
points were made to twist by chipping them that way.
DISTRIBUTION
Appears centered in Pecos-Rio Grande confluence area, decreasing toward Central Texas.
ESTIMATED AGE
Possibly 2000 B. C. to 700 or 800 A. D.
REFERENCES
Named "Pandale Twisted Blade" by Kelley.

PANDORA POINTS
(Plate 112)
DESCRIPTION
Outline: Triangular to leaf-shaped blade, edges almost straight
in a few cases (U-Y) but usually convex. On longer and
narrower specimens the edges may be almost parallel from
~. to ~ the distance forward. By definition, bases straight
or nearly so, to distinguish from Kinney points (Plate 96)
with concave bases and Re]ugio points (Plate 117) with
strongly convex bases. Rarely, basal edges faintly smoothed.
Dimensions:
Length about 4.5 to 12 cm., maximum width
about 2 to 3 cm. However, it is quite possible that the
longest and broadest specimens (or even all of them) are
knives rather than projectile points, but there appears to
be no definite way of distinguishing them~ It seems possible that at least some of the "Pandora points" were used
as projectile points, particularly those of narrow, symmetrical outline with thinned bases. The gradation into broader specimens which are more likely to be knives (~M, N,
X, Z) is constant and probably individuals will differ in
their opinions as to which should be called projectile points
and which knives.
CULTURAL AFFILI,ATIONS
Uncertain at present, but a minor type, at least, in Edwards
Plateau Aspect and Carrollton Focus of Archaic Stage.

DISTRIBUTION
Most common in portion of Texas where Central and Coastal
areas meet, in Victoria, Refugio, and neighboring counties. Occurs infrequently in Central, North-Central, and
eastern side of Trans-Pecos Texas.
ESTIMATED AGE
Possibly 2000 B. C. to 1000 A. D. but may be older or yohnger.
RF_~FERENCES
Crook and Harris (1954a, Plate 1) refer to similar specimens as
"Wheeler Leaf points".

PEDERNALES POINTS
(Plates 113-115)

DESCRIPTION
Outline: Blade usually triangular but often leaf-shaped (Plates
113, P, R, S; 114, Q, R, S, U, V) and varying greatly in
dimensions and proportions. Edges usually straight or convex, but occasionally concave (Plates 113, D, F, J, L: 115,
A), recurved, or narrowed to a slim, needle-like tip (Plate
113. C, I). Shoulders vary greatly from weak to narrow
and right-angular and through various degrees of barbs
from very small to very large, reaching almost to base
of stem (Plate 115 is arranged to show the longest barbs;
Plate 114, V, has one barb reaching to base, the other
shorter). While blade is highly variable, the type is best
recognized by its more or less rectangular stem with concave to deeply indented, U-shaped, base. The base is often
thinned, either with two or three small longitudinal flakes
removed, or a single large flake, on either or both sides,
so that a stem alone, broken off below the shoulders, may
sometimes be confused with the basal portion of a Plainview point (Plate 116); however, the stems of Pedernales
points are only very rarely smoothed and the difference is
usually apparent to one familiar with both types. The
stems may contract somewhat or bulge outward with convex edges.
Dimensions: Total length varies from about 3 to 13 cm., but
the smallest specimens (Plates 113, A; 114. A-G) probably
have re-chipped blades for the most part, and the largest
(Plate 114, S, V) may never have been trimmed down and
finished properly. Most specimens range between 6 and 9
cm. in length and 3 to 5 cm. in greatest width. Width of
stem ranges from about L5 to 3 cm., and stem length is
fairly uniform at 1.5 to 2 cm. regardless of total length.
CULTURAL AFFILIATIONS
The most common dart-point type of Edwards Plateau Aspect,
Archaic Stage, occurring over a very wide area with the
variations shown in Plates 113-115. A minor type in Pecos
River Focus, with much less variation in size and stem
usually slightly contracted with moderatel.v concave base
(like Plate 114, L). May be confused with Butverde l~oints
(Plate 91) when shoulders are small and base not deeply
concave. Also some confusion with Lange points (Plate 97).
DISTRIBUTION
Very common over all of Central Texas, extending much less
ax~mmonly into the adjacent portitms of Coastal. NorthCentral, and Trans-Pecos Texas. Not found, unless very
rarely and probably intrusively, in East and Southwes~
Texas.
ESTIMATED AGE
Entire span of Edwards Plateau Aspect, possibly 4000 B. C. to
500 or 1000 A. D. Poorly shan~d examples may be found
occasionally in association with pottery complexes at 1000
A o D. or later, but proof of such late occurrence is r~eeded.
REFERENCES
Kelley, 1947a. Plate X, A, and 1947b, Plate 14, A, regards this
type as diagnostic of a "Round Rock Focus" but presents
no statistics to show it is relatively any more common in
this focus than in others of Edwards Plateau Aspect. See
also Miller and Jelks, 1952, ~. 175 and Plate 23, Nos. 3-5;

PLAINVIEW POINTS
(Plate 116)

DESCRIPTION
Outline: Basically lanceolate with edges more or less parallel
for ~ to ~ the distance from base to tip, a form best illustrated by the nine most nearly complete specimens from
the type site at Plainview in the Texas Panhandle
Variations in form consist of slight expansion in the middle (E, K-N, Q, S, T) and a gentle recurve of lower edges
(G, K, L, N, V, BB) which probably is due to excessive
grinding of these edges. Grinding of basal edges almost
always occurs. Flaking scars sometimes run parallel across
faces or are roughly matched in pairs (B, C, I, K, N, R, S,
W-BB) ; usually they are irregular. Bases are always concave in some degree, from shallow (N) to a deep recurve
(D, L).
Dimensions: Length about 4.5 to 8 cm., maximum width about
1.8 to 2.8 cm. Base width almost always between 2 and
2.6 cm., although slightly narrower (A, B, E, H, J) or
broader ones (K, L) occur. Concavity in base 1 to 8 ram.
in depth.
CULTURAL AFFILIATIONS
Found unmixed with other projectile-point types at Plainview
Site, but associated with side and end scrapers, and extinct
species of bison. In the Red Smoke Site, Nebraska, apparently associated with Meserve points (Davis, 1953).
Elsewhere, sometimes found with Sco~tsbIuff, Eden, and
Meserve points, suggesting an early post-glacial age. Complexes for this period have not been defined except for "~he
Llano Complex of Sellards (1952), which as yet contains
no definite Pla~nview points. Many examples come from
sites of the Archaic Stage in Texas, especially Edwards
Plateau Aspect, Carrollton Focus, and East Texas Aspect.
Apparently made for a long time, extending from close of
Folsom time through rest of Paleo-Amer~can Stage and
well into Archaic Stage.
DISâ€™PRIBUTION
Occurs practically throughout Texas although never frequent
in any site or area; same may be said for distribution
throughout Great Plains into south-central Canada. Specimens are known from Alaska and from northeastern Mexico; also from Arizona, Ne~v Mexico, and from such states
as Louisiana, Arkansas, Missouri, and o~hers farther east.
Comparable to distribution of Clovis fluted points (Plate
85), covering the greater part of North America; and shape
is much lik~ that of Clovis points except for absence of
~uting.
ESTIMATED AGE
Possibly 7000 ~B. C. to 2000 B. C. or somewhat later. Re-chipped
examples may be of any age from 7000 B. C. to historic
times.

REFUGIO POINTS
(Plate 117)
DESCRIPTION
Outline:

Long and slender blade, triangular to leaf-shaped;

edges usually convex, occasionally nearly straight (V, W),
and sometimes brought tQ a long, needle-like tip (B, F,
R). On narrowest specimens, edges may be nearly parallel
for some distance (B, E, F, N, Y-AA). By definition, bases
convex to semicircular, to distinguish from Kinney points
(Plate 96) with concave bases, and Pandora points (Plate
112) with straight bases. Most of body usually quite thick
with ridge on both faces (best seen in D, F, G, Z, AA),
but lower 1~, or so is notably thinned down to facilitate
hafting. Thus, although no real shoulders are present,
most of these artifacts have what amounts to a stem section set off from the blade; in this respect they also differ
from Kinney and Pandora points. Black asphaltum stains
sometimes occur on this stem section on specimens near
the coast (J, K), indicating use of asphaltum in cementing haft.
Dimensions: Length about 6 to 10 cm., seldom more or less.
Maximum width 2 to 3 cm. As with Kinney and Pandora
points, it may be argued that some of these specimens are
knives.
CULTURAL AFFILIATIONS
A minor type in various Archaic complexes:

Pecos River Fo-

cus, Carrollton Focus, FalcSn Focus, and Edwards Plateau
Aspect. Probably closely related to Lerma points (Plate
99) as well as Kinney and Pandora.
DISTRIBU~rION
Found widely in central Coastal area, Southwest, Central, and
North-Central areas, and lower Pecos River. Perhaps most
frequent on central coast.
ESTIMATED AGE
Possibly 2000 B. C. to 1000 A. ~D.
REFERENCES
None, except that Crook and Harris (1954a) refer to similar
specimens as "Wheeler Leaf" points.

SANDIA POINTS
Hibben (1941, Plates 10-12) illustrates a few of the specimens obtained from Sandia Cave in north-central New Mexico. These
points are about 5 to 10 cm. or more in length and are characterized by the presence of a single shoulder which slants forward; the opposite edge is a single line or curve from tip to
base, or very slightly indented opposite the one shoulder. Two
types are recognized:

Type 1 has the stem contracted to a

pointed or rounded base; Type 2 has parallel stem edges and a
concave base. On both types the stem edges are usually ground
smooth.
In Sandia Cave these points were found in the same deposit with
many Pleistocene animals now extinct and were below the
posit with Folsom points.

Recently, radiocarbon age determi-

nations of about 19,000 years (17,000 B. C.) have been obtained
on the lower deposit.

If the dates apply to the Sandia points

themselves, they are the oldest dated artifacts in America,
much older than Folsom points. Hibben (1941, p. 31) has stated
that Sandia points "occur sporadically from southeastern Colorado to central Texas," but the present authors are aware of
only a few possible Sandia points in this State, all of them in
private collections from

the High Plains

(Llano Estacado).

Lop-sided specimens of more common Texas types may be
mistaken for Sandia points.

SAN PATRICE POINTS
(Plate 109, M-EE)
DESCRIPTION
Outline:

Triangular blade, often stubby, with edges straight,

convex,

or

concave;

occasionally,

blade

is

leaf-shaped

(AA). Shoulders weak, often absent. Blade sometimea
beveled on right or left edge of both faces (Y) but more
often all four edges appear steep because of removal of
center of stem and blade by thinning or fluting (note
thinned area in drawings S-EE and in P, Q). Stem edges
sometimes cut inward with notches (M, N, Q, W, X, AA,
DD), otherwise parallel or somewhat contracted. Some
stem edges are concave (O,
but since all stems are smoothed by grinding, such concavities appear to be due to excessive grinding in the
same manner as on some Clovis, Folsorr~, Meserve, and
Plainview points (Plates 85, 92, 104, 116). Bases always
concave, often deeply.
Dimensions:

Total length about 2 to 5 cm., average about 3.5

cm. Maximum width across shoulders about 2 to 3.2 cm.
Flutes ~,~ to 2/3 of total length.

CULTURAL AFFILIATIONS
Undefined Archaic complex in northwest Louisiana and East
Texas Aspect, but rare in latter.

Probably some of these

specimens are simply re-chipped Clovis points (Plate
but most appear complete in original form, particularly
those with notched-in stems. Thus an interesting possibility that fluting principle survived much longer in this
area than elsewhere. Some resemblance to Paisano points
(Plate 109, A-L) but these never smoothed or fluted and
there is no known connecting link across the several hundred miles of Central Texas.
DISTRI,BUTION
Northwest Louisiana, northeast Texas, eastern Oklahoma; probably Arkansas.
ESTIMATED AGE
Difficult to estimate other than in Archaic Stage.

SCO~SBLUF[F POINTS
(Plate 118)
DESCRIIYÂ£ION
Outline: Triangular to leaf-shaped blade, edges straight to
convex. The edges are sometimes parallel for at least half
the length of the blade (C, H, J, L-O, R). Shoulders small
but definitely cut inward at right angle to blade, or slanting forward slightly; barbs absent. Stem essentially a
rectangle but edges may expand a little (E-I, K, N, R).
Base usually quite straight but may be very slightly concave (E) or convex (I, K). Stem edges commonly ground
smooth. Blade faces often chipped with parallel scars
running across (B, D, H-J, N-R), or with matched pairs
of scars meeting in a central ridge (C). Whether regularly
or irregularly chipped, ScottsbluJf points ordinarily have a
"fat" feel due to their being a thick oval in crossksection;
a few are thin and flat (D, E).
Dimensions: Tota! length about 5 to 15 cm. Maximum width
usually 2.5 to 3.5 cm.; such narrow specimens as C, G,
very unusual. Stems vary from 2 to 3 cm. in width and
1.2 to 2.5 cm. in length. Stems thus from about 1~I~ to 1/10
or less of total length.
CULTLrRA~ AFFILIATIONS
Like Plainview points, the Scottsbluff t.ype is found ~videly in
the Great Plains region, sometimes m association with extinct species of bison and geological circumstances which
indicate an early post-glacial age. The largest series of
points from individual sites are those from Eden Valley in
western Wyoming (~Moss, et al., 1951) and the Sage Creek
or Hornet Site near Cody, Wyoming (unpublished). Other
such associations occur in Nebraska (Davis, 1953). In Texas
nearly all known specimens are in surface collections, some
primarily of material belonging to the Archaic Stage,
others of isolated nature.
DISTRIBUTION
Found in all parts of Texas except Trans-Pecos and most of
Coastal area, but always infre.quently. Appear to be concentrated in northeast Texas ~n general area of Sulphur
and upper Sabine River systems, where about half the
known specimens in Texas are found. Also occur in northern Louisiana and Arkansas and probably more widely in
eastern United States, as well as throughout the Great
Plains from Texas and New Mexico to south-central
Canada.
ESTIMATED AGE
6000 or 7000 B. C. to 2000 B. C., but difficult to estimate upper
limits until type has been adequately studied in distribution and association.

SHUMLA POINTS
(Plate 119)
DESCRIPTION
Outline: Small triangular blade with edges sometimes convex
but usually straight, concave, or recurved. Almost always
barbed, from short (F, K) to long, sweeping out laterally
(L, M, S, T), or extending into line with stem base (D,
G-J, O-R, U, X-CC). Stem edges more or less parallel,
may expand or contract somewhaL Base usually convex,
but may be straight (C, G, H, L, Q, T) or, rarely concave
(N). ~lade edges frequently serrated (A, M, N, X).
Dimensions:

Total length ranges from about 3 to 9 cm. but

most fall between 4 and 6 cm. Maximum width about 2.5
to 5 cm. but most fall between 3 and 4 cm. Stems fairly
uniform at 1 to 1.5 cm. wide and 1 to 1.5 cm. long; about
~.z~ to 1/6 of total length.
CULTUR4kL AFFILIATIONS
Closely linked with Langtry points (Plate 98) as a major type
of Pecos River Focus. Both types also appear as minor
elements in FalcSn Focus and are rare in Edwards Plateau
Aspect.
DISTRIBUTION
Centered about Pecos-Rio Grande confluence area, becoming
less frequent down Rio Grande and Nueces River in Southwest Texas. May also extend into Big Bend and northern
Coahuila to west of Pecosâ€™River mouth.
ESTIMATED AGE
An unknown time before Christ to 700 or 800 A. D.

TORTUGAS POINTS
(Plate 120)
DESCRIPTION
Outline: Large triangular blade with no stem and edges usually straight to slightly convex; occasionally they may be
slightly concave or recurved (K, T, U). Very frequently
beveled along right edge of both faces; occasionally beveled along left edge or on all four edges (K, M). Bases
straight to concave as a general rule; slight convexity may
be allowed (T) but definite convexity would place similar
specimens in Abasolo type (Plate 79). Thinning of base
common, with short longitudinal flakes removed, sometimes large flakes giving effect like fluting (I)~ F).
Dimensions: Length about 3.5 to 8 cm., maximum width about
2 to 4 cm., but majority of fairly uniform size (like M-O,
Q-Y). Smallest ones overlap in length with Matamoros
points (Plate 103) but are tentatively classed as Tortugas
because of width and weight (A, C, F).
CULTURAL AF~FILIATIONS
Major type, with Abasolo points, of Falcbn Focus, continuing
into Mier Focus along with their two smaller counterparts,
Matamoros and Cat~n points~ Occurs as minor type in
Aransas Focus, Edwards Plateau Aspect, and Pecos River
Focus, all of Archaic Stage. Occurs in association with
pottery in Neo-American Stage only in Alto Focus in East
Texas; however, it occurs only very rarely if at all in the
Archaic Stage of East Texas.
DISTRIBUTION
Widely spread in Coastal, Central, and eastern part of TransPecos Texas, extending to Neches River valley in East
Texas, but common only in Southwest Texas.
ESTIMATED AGE
Possibly 4000 B. C. to 1000 A. D., based partly on terrace associations in lower Rio Grande valley.
REFERENCES
Kelley, 1947a, refers to "Baird Beveled Blade" and "Taylor
Thinned Base" points in connection with the Edwards
Plateau Aspect, while h~ Southwest Texas he coined a
third name, "Tortugas Triangular Blade" (1947a, p. 104).
The present authors have found it impossible to distinguish
between these three groups of triangular, beveled points
in form or distribution, and have therefore grouped them
into a single type. The name Tortugas is used for this type,
since it was coined for Southwest Texas, where this form
is very common and includes all the variations of the
"Baird" and "Taylor" groups found in Central Texas. The
specimens called "Baird ~Beveled Blade" and â€™~raylor Thinned Base" at the Davis Site in East Texas (Newell and
Krieger, 1949, pp. 168-170 and Fig. 59, A-K) should now
be classed as Tortugas points.

TRAVIS POINTS
(Plate 121)
DESCRIPTION
Outline: Slender triangular to leaf-shaped blade, edges straight
to convex, Many specimens have tip slimmed down to
needle-like point (E, F, H, I, AA-CC). Shoulders very
slight and rounded. Stem usually rectangular with parallel
edges, but may expand or contract slightly. Base usually
straight but may be slightly concave or convex.
Dimensions: Total length about 4.5 to 9 cm., average about 7
cm. Maximum width quite uniform at about 2 to 2.5 cm.,
seldom more or less. Stern width about 1.5 to 2 cm. Stem
length fairly uniform at about 1.5 to 2 cm., ~/~: to 1/5 of
total length.
CULTURAL AF~FILIATIONS
A major type of Edwards Plateau Aspect, Archaic Stage. Overlap in shape and other features with several other types of
Edwards Plateau Aspect may cast doubt on validity of
Travis type, but it ~vas felt that in practice it could usually
be distinguished. Some closely resemble Angostura points
(Plate 80) in outline, but stems generally more prominent
and shorter, and lack smoothing. Some overlap with Bulverde points (Plate 81) but lacks barbs and wedging down
of stem to thin basal edge. Specimens with concave bases
(AA-DD) resemble Darl points (Plate 86) but are larger
and lack beveling and stem smoothing. Travis points
closely resemble some Nolan (Plate 108) in outline but
lack beveled stems. They are also narrower and have
much less prominent shoulders and barbs than Lange
points (Plate 97).
DISTRIBUTION
Mainly Central Texas, possibly extending into other sections
less frequently.
ESTIMATED AGE
Full span of Edwards Plateau Aspect, possibly 4000 B. C. to
500 or 1000 A. D.

CULTURAL AFFILIATIONS
A major type of Carrollton Focus, Archaic Stage. Appears
occasionally in East Texas Aspect. Shallow side notches
somewhat resemble those of Ensor points (Plate 90) but
notably longer, and stems more bulbous. Stems resemble
those of Palmillas and Williams points (Plates 111, 124)
but general proportions and workmanship quite distinct,
as well as distribution.
DISTRIBUTION
Apparently most common in Dallas area in valleys of East Fork
and Trinity River, extending into northeast Texas and
southward toward Brazos River.
ESTIMATED AGE
2000 to 1000 B. C. (Crook and Harris, 1952).

UVALDE POINTS
(Plate 122)
DESCRIPTION
Outline: Triangular to leaf-shaped blade, edges straight to
convex, rarely concave (H, N). Shoulders prominent,
rounded, or with good barbs. Stem expands strongly,
sometimes being as wide as shoulders. Bases have deep
U-shaped concavity similar to Pedernales points (Plates
113-115) but stems are much shorter and flare outwar~d
more. Blade edges sometimes serrated (BB).
Dimensions: Total length about 4 to 10 cm., average about 6
cm. Maximum width 2 to 3.5 cm., stems 1.5 to 2 cm. wide
and ~/4 to ~/~ of total length.
CULTURAL AFFILIATIONS
A minor type of Edwards Plateau Aspect, Similar to Fr~o
points (Plate 93) but blades longer and narrower, stems
not as wide or as flaring; the stem tips point downward
rather than outward and the central notch of Frio points
is missing. Also similar to Martindale points (Plate 102)
but tack the two-curve "fish-tail" base of the latter.
Judgment between these three types would be difficult in
some cases, however.
DISTRIBUTION
Primarily Central Texas, extending toward central Coastal
area in lower Guadalupe River valley, and toward Pecos
River-Rio Grande confluence area, where the few specimens may be intrusive from Central Texas.
ESTIMATF~D AGE
Some part of span 4000 B. C. to 1000 A. D. More restricted
distribution may indicate it is not as old as some other
Edwards Plateau types.

CULTURAL AFFILIATIONS
A major type of East Texas Aspect, Archaic Stage, continuing
into association with pottery in Alto Focus and perhaps
other loci of Gibson Aspect, Neo-Arnerican Stage. Some
evidence that it may also survive in some foci of Fulton
Aspect.

Occurs

in

Clam Focus of Trinity Aspect,

and

apparently extends from late Edwards Plateau Aspect into
early Central Texas Aspect in same manner as Darl points.
It is closely related to the Darl type (Plate 86) but lacks
the extreme slenderness of the latter, the shoulders are
more prominent, the base is more consistently straight
(rather than concave), and the blade is less frequently
beveled. In general, the smaller specimens of both types
are easier to distinguish than the larger ones (compare
bottom rows of Plates 86 and 125).

Dimensions: Total length about 2 to 4,5 cm. Maximum width
about 1 to 2 cm. Stems 0.4 to 0.7 cm. wide and length
about same. Stems from â€™~ to 1/6 of total length.
CULTURAL AFFILIATIONS
So far, definitely associated only with Allen Focus of Fulton
Aspect in Historic Stage. Therefore, probably made by
Caddoan tribes of Hasinai branch.
DISTRIBUTION
Central part of East Texas, principally in Cherokee, Anderson,
and Henderson Counties. Found infrequently northward at
least as far as Red River and westward into Central Texas.
ESTIMATED AGE
1600 to 1800 A. D.
REFERENCES
None.
FOYLE FLAKE POINTS
See Perdiz points (Plate 131).
I~RESNO POINTS
(Plate 128, rows C-E)
DESCRII~ION
Outline:
Simple triangles with straight to slightly convex
edges, bases usually straight but may be concave or slig.htly
convex. Usually finely flaked on both faces but occasionally one face is smooth fracture plane of original chip, only
slightly modified if at all. Rarely, edges are finely serrated.
Dimensions: Length about 2 to 3.5 cm., seldom more or less.
Width 1 to 2 cm., occasionally a little more.
CULTURAL AFFILIATIONS
Central Texas Aspect, Bravo Valley Aspect; Galveston Bay,
Rockport, Brownsville, Mier, Henrietta, Wylie, and probably other foci in Neo-American Stage. Occurs at Spanish
Fort and Womack Sites on Red River, which belong to
Historic Stage but also produce some late prehistoric material. Grades into Turney type (Plate 134), which belongs
t6 historic Allen ~ocus in East Texas. Also grades into
Talco type of Ti[us Focus (Plate 133) and Stair type
(Plate 132).
DISTRI~BUTION
Practically statewide, lacking only in easternmost counties next
to Louisiana.
ESTLMATED AGE
Possibly 800 or 900 A. D. to 1600 A. D. or later.

HARRELL POINTS
(Plate 129)

DESCRIPTION
Outline: Triangular points with edges straight to slightly convex. Bases straight to deeply concave. Two small side
notches occur, from I/4 to ~i:z the distance from base toward
tip. Two sub-groups or sub-types may be recognized:
those with a third notch in center of base, whether this is
straight or concave (rows A-C); and those without a base
notch (rows D-F). In Texas, at least, there appears to be
no difference in distribution or time between these two
sub-types, although a wider study in the Plains and Southwest United States may show significant differences.
Dimensions: Length 1.5 to 3.5 cm. Maximum width about
to 2 cm. Notches (both at sides and at base) usually 0.2
to 0.3 cm. deep.
CULTURAL AFFILIATIONS
A major type in Antelope Creek Focus; one of several types in
Henrietta and Wylie Foci.

Occurs widely in Panhandle-

Plains area where no definite complexes have been recognized. Also of general distribution in Great Plains from
northern Texas to Canada, east to Mississippi valley, and
west to Southwest, always associated with agriculture and
pottery-making. In far western states and Northwest, occurs in late horizons without agriculture or pottery.

DISTRIBUTION
See above paragraph. In Texas the type occurs across the
northern parts, extending southward to the upper Brazos
and Trinity River drainages, with occasional specimens
farther south. Unknown in East Texas except for rare,
probably intrusive, specimens.
ESTIMATED AGE
In Texas, perhaps 1100 to 1500 A. D., not known to be associated with historic complexes. Elsewhere, may be considerably older.

HAYES POINTS
(Plate 130, rows A-C)

DESCRIPTION
Outline: Slender triangular blade with edges usually concave
or recurved, occasionally straight, rarely convex. Some
are square-shouldered without real barbs, but others have
barbs sweeping out laterally rather than pointing downward. Sterns are bulb-shaped in some cases, but are often
featured by a diamond shape from which tiny protrusions
emerge on one or more edges. Blade edges sometimes~
finely serrated, and tips may be sharply incut (row B,
second from right; row C, first and fourth from left).
Dimensions: Total length about 3 to 5 cm. Maximum width
about 1.5 to 2 cm. Stems quite uniform in width and
length, 0.5 to 0.8 and 0.6 to 1 cm., respectively. Stems
about 1/4 to 1/6 of total length.
CULTURAL AFFILIATIONS
Characteristic only of Haley Focus in Gibson Aspect, but may
occur as minor type or intrusion in late phases of Alto,
Gahagan, and Spiro Foci. Similar to Alba points (Plate
126) except for stem shape and incut tips, and to Bonham
points (Plate 127) except for stem shape and general proportions.
DISTRIBUTION
Common only in area of great bend of Red River, in adjacent
corners of Texas, Arkansas, Louisiana, and possibly Oklahoma.
ESTIMATED AGE
Same as Haley Focus, possibly 800 to 1200 A. D. or part thereof.
REFERENCES
Newell and Krieger, 1949, p. 162 and Fig. 56, I-L. These authors point out the near-identity of Hayes points and the
common form of the classic Teotihuacan culture in central
.Mexico, the only real difference being that the Mexican
specimens are almost always obsidian rather than flint.
LIVERMORE POINTS
(Plate 130, rows D, E)

DESCRIPTION
Outline: More or less of a cross, due to very slender, incur
blade, widely flarin~ shoulders, and narrow stemÂ° Base
pointed or rounded. Blade edges frequently serrated, often
some teeth considerably longer than others.
Dimensions: Total length about 2.5 to 5 cm. Blade 0.5 to I cm.
wide~ maximum width across flaring shoulders about 1.2 to
3 cmo Stem may be about same width as blade, sometimes
less, sometimes more.
CULTURAL AFFILIATIONS
A ma~o~ type of the Livermore Focus. extending intrusively
into Mesilla Phase of Jornada Branch.
DISTRI~IYrION
Principally in central part of Trans-Pecos Texas.
ESTIMATED AGE
Some part of span 800 to 1200 A. D.

sometimes recurred with constriction near middle. Bases
deeply concave to deeply V-shaped. Commonly very finely
chipped, thin, flat, with edges minutely serrated.
Dimensions: Length about 2 to 5.5 cm. Maximum width quite
uniform at 1 to 1.5 cm. Basal ~concavity 0.3 to 0.7 cm.

CULTURAL

AFFILIATIONS
Common type of Texarkana and Belcher Foci, extending to
easternmost components of Titus Focus, all of Fulton Aspect. Similar to Talco points (Plate 133) except for excessive depth of base and edges usually straight rather than
recurved.

DISTRIBUTION
Northeast corner of Texas and adjacent corners of Louisiana
and Arkansas.

ESTIMATED AGE

19.00 to 1500 A. D. or greater part thereof.

REFERENCES
None.

PERDIZ POINTS
(Plate 131, rows C-E)

DESCRIPTION

Outline: Triangular blade with edges usually quite straight
but sometimes slightly convex or concave. Shoulders sometimes at right angles to stem but usually well barbed. Stem
contracted, often quite sharp at base, but may be somewhat rounded. O~ccasionally, specimen may be worked on
one face only, or mainly on one face. More variation in
size and proporhons than in most arrow-point types in
Texas. Workmanship generally good, sometimes exceedingly fine with minutely serrated blade edges.
Dimensions: Total length about 1.5 to 6 cm,. the longer specimens overlapping several dart point types in length but
much thinner and lighter than specimens classified as dart
points. Max*mum width about 1.2 to 3 cm. Stems 0.5 to 1.5
cm. long, generally Â½ to 1/7 of total length.
CULTURAL AFFILIATIONS
A common type in many Neo-American complexes in Texas,
surh as Bravo Valley and Central Texas Aspects; Henrietta,
Wylie, Frankston, Galveston Bay, and Rockport Foci.
Frankston Focus, at the western limits of the Caddoan area,
is the only focus in the Gibson and Fulton Aspects in which
this type occurs, where it is the only arrow-point type.
DISTRIBUTION
Most of Texas from Rio Grande in extreme west to Neches
River valley on the east; from Red River valley in both
Texas and Oklahoma southward ~to eastern and central
parts of Gulf coast.
ESTIMATED AGE
Formerly regarded as quite late; now estimated at about 1000
to 1500 A. D.

PIEDRAS TRIPLE-NOTCHED POINTS
SAUCIA SPLIT-BASE POINTS
Mentioned by Kelley (1947b, p. 122) as types belonging to Bravo
Valley Aspect in extreme western Texas, also occurring at
Lehmann Rockshelter in Gillespie County, Central Texas.
No descriptions published, both seem similar to Toyah
points (Plate 133).
$CALLORN POINTS
(Plate 132, rows A-C)
DESCRIPTION
Outline: Broad to slender triangular blades with edges straight
to convex, o~casionally concave. Shoulders may be squared
but usually well barbed. Stem formed by notching into
corners at various angles, making it expand from a broad
wedge shape to rounded extremities as wide as the shoulders. Base straight, concave, and convex. Possibly should
be divided into two or more types, but these features of
stem shape and base intergrade in every possible manner
where found in Texas. Blade edges often finely serrated.
Dimensions: Tdtal length about 2Â°5 to 4.5 cm., rarely longer
or shorter. Maximum width at shoulders or base fairly
uniform at 1.5 to 2 cm. Stems â€™~{~ to 1/7 of total length.
CULTURAL AFFILIATIONS
Common in Central Texas Aspect; occurs in Henrietta Focus
and probably Rockport Focus.
DISTRIBUTION
More or less a broad central belt through Texas from Red River
valley to Gulf coast, but absent in East Texas and eastern
and southern extremities of coast. Said to be fairly abundant throughout Oklahoma.
ESTIMATED AGE
Somewhat older than Perd~z points; possibly 700 to 1500 A. D.
REFERENCES
Kelley (1947b, p. 122) mentions "Scallorn Stemmed" type as
diagnost~ of Austin Focus (of Central Texas Aspect) but
provides no description; Krieger, 1946, pp. 97, 115 and Fig.
7, T, U; Miller and Jelks, 1952, pp. 176-177 and Plate 24,
No. 1; Jelks, 1953, Plate 19, O-S; Bell and Hall, 1953, p. 9.
SHAFTER SPLIT-BASE POINTS
A type recognized by Kelley in the Bravo Valley Aspect in extreme
western Texas, which appears very similar to that described
herein as Turney (Plate 134). As the Turney points have
been definitely associated only with the historic Allen Focus in the central part of East Texas. and are not recognized
so far in the area between East and Trans-Pecos Texas,
this similarity needs to be investigated more fully.
STARR POINTS
(Plate 132, rows D, E)
Simple txiangular points with both edges and base concave. Possibly variants of Fresno type (Plate 128) but the basic pattern
of three concave edges has, in general, a more southern distribution in Texas. While Fresno points are found widely ]n
central, northern, and western Texas, Start points are more
common in the coastal portion and in Southwest Texas, especially in Brownsville and Mier Foci. The basal concavity also
is usually considerably deeper than that of Fres~m points. The
time span is probably about the same as Fresno.

TALCO POINTS
(Plate 133, rows A-C)

DESCRIPTION
Outline:
Slender triangular points with edges occasionally
almost straight but usually recurred with constriction ap~
proximately in middle.
Bases almost always concave.
Workmanship extremely fine, blades thin and flat. Edges
commonly minutely serrated, tips often slimmed down to
needle-like point.
Dimensions: Length about 2 to 5.5 cm. Maximum width 1 Io
1.8 cm. Basal concavity 0.1 to 0.4 cm. deep.
CULTURAL AFFILIATIONS
A common type in Titus Focus, Fulton Aspect, large number~
being found in burials. Overlaps somewhat with Maud
points (Plate 131) but bases not so deep and edges much
more consistently recurved; distribution more restricted.
Some overlap also with Turney points (Plate 134).
DISTRIBUTION
Northern part of East Texas, especially in upper drainage systems of Sabine and Sulphur Rivers, extending to Red
:River.
ESTIMATED AGE
1200 to 1500 A. D., possibly continuing with minor changes into
Turney type in early historic times, 1600 to 1700 A. D.
REFERENCES
None.
TOYAH POINTS
(Plate 133, rows D, E)
DESCRIPTION
Outline: Small triangular blades with two side notches anywhere from near base to about middle. Bases originally
straight to concave but strongly modified in most cases
with a large third notch in ~center of base. Blade edges
often strongly serrated and narrowed above notches.
Dimensions: Length about 1.5 to 2.5 cm. Maximum width 1
to 1.5 cm., or slightly more or less.
CULTURAL AFFILIATIONS
Apparently another name for "Piedras Triple-Notched" points,
which Kelley (1947b, p. 122) assigns to Toyah Focus, a division of the Central Texas Aspect which he relates to the
Sumano Indian occupation of west-central and Trans-Pecos
Texas. Similar to Harrell points (Plate 129) but smaller
and more modified in the blade and around corners by
notching, incutting, and serration.
DISTRIBUTION
Parts of Trans-Pecos Texas, possibly extending rarely into Central Texas.
ESTIMATED AGE
Late prehistoric; early historic?
REFERENCES
None published. Considerable confusion as to what features
distinguish Piedras and Toyah points, and how they are
distinguished from "Saucia Split-Base", "Sarago.sa. No.t~ch..edSerrate", and "Frisco Base-Notched", all namea Dy ~elley
but undescribed.

TURNEY POINTS
(Plate 134, row A)
DESCRIPTION
Outline:
Slender triangular blade, edges cut inward just
above base, then straight to tip. Base a broad V rather than
concave, so that basal tips somewhat like barbs rather
than ordinary corners. Very finely !chipped, thin, flat, with
edges serrated in most cases.
Dimensions: Length about 3 to nearly 6 cm., thus longer than
some dart points but much lighter. Maximum width at base
about 1.1 to 1.8 cm. Basal concavity 0.3 to 0.5 cm. deep.
CULTURAL AFFILIATIONS
A diagnostic type of Allen Focus in Fulton Aspect, Historic
Stage, not known to occur elsewhere. The shorter specimens are very similar to Talco points (Plate 133) but are
constricted above base rather than recurved with constriction near middle, and bases more V-shaped. The longer
specimens (four in middle of row A) are clearly distinct
from Talco and other triangular types.
DISTRIBUTION
Central part of Neches River valley, East Texas, principally in
northern Cherokee County.
ESTIMATED AGE
Some part of span 1600 to 1800 A. D.
REFERENCES
None.
YOUNG POINTS
(Plate 134, rows B-D)
DESCRIPTION
Outline: Crudely triangular to leaf-shaped, edges occasionally
almost straight but usually strongly convex and often
asymmetrical. Made from thin, curved flakes with little
modification on either side, usually not enough to flatten
the artifacts. Bases straight to convex, seldom concave,
often crooked.
Dimensions: Length about 2.5 to 4.5 cm, Maximum width 1.5 to
2.5 cm.
CULTURAL AFFILIATIONS
Common in Henrietta Focus, rard in Central Texas Aspect.
DISTRIBUTION
Concentrated in Young County, upper Brazos River valley,
North-C~n~ral Texas, with a few in northern part of Central Texas.
ESTIMATED AGE
1200 to 1500 A. D.
REFERENCES
Described but not named by Krieger, 1946, p. 115 and Fig. 7,

GAR SCALE POINTS
(Plate 134, row E)
These are merely the bony scales of the alligator-gar fish, found
in many archeological sites of the Texas coastal plain and on
lower reaches of rivers entering the Gulf. Due to the shape of
these scales, they could have been hafted to arrow shafts without mooffication. Some, however, have the natural stem slimmed down somewhat, as shown by tiny cutting marks.

GLOSSARY
Abrading stone: A stone, either shaped or unshaped, used
for smoothing other objects by abrasion. Thus, arrow
shafts, knife handles, shell and stone beads, pendants,
etc., may have been ground into shape by rubbing
against a coarse-grained abrader. The tips of bone awls
were commonly sharpened by rubbing in grooves made
in rock slabs or bedrock.
Acculturation: The process of interaction between two or
more cultures by which the .behavior patterns of one
or all of them are modified in a greater degree than in
the case of simple diffusion or borrowing of traits.
Adze: A relatively fiat and thin cutting implement of stone
or shell mounted or hafted at right angles to the handle.
Applique: A technique of pottery decoration in which
pieces or strips of moist clay are pressed on to the
vessel wall before firing, producing a relief ornamentation.
Arrow point: A small, thin, and light point hafted to the
end of an arrow shaft. Although popularly known as
"bird points" there was no particular connection between such arrows and the hunting of birds; they were
also used for all game, large and small, and for warfare.
In general, the weight of such points is only a fraction
of that of dart points although in dimensions there is
considerable overlap.
Arti]act: Any object fashioned through human workmanship. In practice, it is usually confined to objects found
by archeologists.
AtlatI: A word of Aztec origin, commonly used for the
spear-thrower.
Awl: A pointed implement, usually of bone or shell, suitable
for making small holes in skins or for sewing coiled
basketry by penetrating the foundation.

Ax, Axe: A large, thick, bifacially-chipped stone artifact
suitable for chopping. It may vary in shape from oval
to roughly rectangular or triangular and may or may
not have notches chipped into the edges for hatting.
Such objects are sometimes referred to as "heavy
blades". See also celts and grooved axes.
Bi-convex: Any artifact, the faces of which are both convex
in cross-section.
Bi-face tool: Any stone artifact modified on both faces by
chipping.
Bit: The cutting edge of an axe, celt, chisel, or scraper.
Blade: The main body of a knife or projectile point, as distinct from the hatted portion or stem. Old World archeologists generally use the term for long, thin, more
or less parallel-edged spalls or prisms struck from cores;
New World archeologists generally term these "flakes"
or "lamellar fl~es".
Bladelet: A small "blade" in the Old World usage cited
above.
Boatstone: A polished-stone artifact shaped more or less like
a canoe with rounded or squared ends, usually hollowed
out in various ways from the upper or flat side. Probably used as weights tied to underside of atlatls (spearthrowers) to increase centrifugal force through throwing arc; experiments prove that such weights actually
give added force and snap to the throw.
Brushing: A technique of finishing the surface of pottery
vessels by rubbing with grass or perhaps twigs, leaving
the surface covered with striations. As this was usually
done on the exteriors only, the interiors being smoothed,
and the striations sometimes run in crude patterns, it
was probably decorative.
Burnish: To rub a pottery-vessel surface to a high polish
with satiny feel.

Burnt-rock midden: A concentrated refuse deposit consisting largely of broken and discarded chunks of hearthstones (usually limestone), together with soil, ash, animal-bone fragments, artifacts, flint scrap, etc. They are
very common in Central Texas and range in height from
a few inches to 8 feet or more; in extent they may range
from 25 feet across to several acres and are usually
roughly circular or oval in shape except when found
in caves. They have often been referred to as "rock
mounds", but since they are merely unintentional accumulations, are more suitably termed middens.
Cambered rim or lip: A vessel lip with convex outer surface
meeting the inner surface in a ridge or gable.
Campsite: A place occupied for only a short time.
Celt: An ungrooved polished-stone axe. ustmlly round or
oval in cross-section at middle, one end converging to
a bit, the other a blunt poll (petaloid celt). Also refers
to a flatter object with the cutting edge flaring out
wider than the body (spatulate celt). While the term
is often applied to flat, thin, more or less rectangular
polished axes with sharp bits, these are termed adzes
herein.
Checker or checkerboard weave: A technique of weaving
baskets in which the two elements pass one-over and
one-under, producing a checkerboard pattern.
Chopper: A heavy, very crudely chipped stone implement
with a broad, jagged cutting edge at one end. The other
end is usually unchipped and retains the original outer
surface or "crust" of the pebble or flint nodule from
which the chopper was made; this original surface often
fits conveniently into the palm, hence the alternative
terms "fist axe" and "hand axe". The term "axe" in
this connection usually indicates a thinner and bettermade blade at the cutting end; however, all three terms
may be used interchangeably.
Cist: A dug pit which may be oval, circular, or irregular in
shape, and may or may not be lined with plaster or

Texas Archeolog~cal Society

533

stones. Primarily for food storage but sometimes used
secondarily for graves.
Coiled basketry: Basketry in which a round foundation element of grass stems, twigs, or slats (split twigs) is built
up in a continuous spiral. Each circuit is held in place
by passing a looping strand over it and binding it to
the one below in any of several ways.
Coiled pottery: Pottery constructed in much the same way
as coiled basketry, and perhaps invented by simulating
the latter. From a starting core or disk, rolls of clay are
added in a continuous spiral or series of circuits, each
one pressed down and pinched on to the preceding one.
The seams are then smoothed over with a stone tool or a
paddle-and-anvil. If not smoothed over, the pinching of
one coil down on another produces a "corrugated" effect.
Complex: Any group of cultural traits found together so as
to indicate they existed at the same time. Also, groups
of traits pertaining to certain kinds of activity, such as
hunting complex, burial complex, architectural complex, etc.
Cordmarking: A technique of impressing cords into the surface of pottery vessels for decorative effect. The cords
probably were wrapped tightly around wooden paddles
and thus pressed into the clay in groups rather than
singly, although the latter was practiced as well.
Core, core tool: A stone, usually flint or obsidian, from
which flakes have been removed. When the core has
been fashioned into a tool, such as a hand axe, by the
orderly removal of flakes, it becomes a "core tool" or
"core artifact".
Corner-tang: A term applied to knives and drills which
have a "tang" or stem at one corner rather than in the
usual position in the center of the base. The stem may
also be merely off-center enough so that any handle
halted to it would lie at an angle to the medial line of
the artifact. The purpose is unknown but an angular
handle on certain cutting or drilling implements may

f~34

Texas Archeological Society

provide a mechanical advantage over a straight handle
for some functions.
Corrugated pottery: Coiled pottery in which one coil has
been pinched on to the preceding one with regular
crimps, but the seams and crimps have not been
smoothed over in the usual manner, being left as decoration. The entire vessel may be corrugated (as by the
Puebloan Indians), or the body may be smoothed and
only the neck coils left corrugated. The latter technique
is called neck-banding and occurs in the Puebloan, Caddoan, and northern Andean regions.
Dart point: A point attached to the shaft of a "dart" used
with the spear-thrower. Because of the size of these
"darts", from 4~/2 to 6 feet long, and the power of the
throwing stick, these points are considerably heavier
than those for arrows, although no exact criteria have
been established.
Dentate stamping: A decorative technique on pottery, done
by pressing the notched edge of a mussel or sea shell (or
possibly a finely notched wooden or bone implement)
into the still-plastic clay. The fine rows of punctates
thus produced will appear similar in cast. The edge of
the implement may have .been rocked back and forth,
producing a dentated rocker stamping.
Di]]usion: The spread of culture traits through their being
borrowed by one group from another.
Digging Stick: A wooden staff, usually pointed and sometimes fire-hardened, for uprooting plants, bulbs, etc.
Distal: The end farthest away from one, when used in reference to something held in the hand. When used in
reference to parts of bones (especially limb bones), the
distal end is that farthest from the body, as opposed to
the proximal end.
Drill: An implement of chipped stone with a long, slender
shaft suitable for making holes in wood, stone, bone,
leather, etc.

Tezas A~cheolog~c~ Societ~

539

other workshop debris, etc., and may vary in thickness
from a few inches to several feet. See also burnt-rock
midden and shell midden.
Milling stone: A stone slab on which a mano was used to
grind food. In contrast to a metate, the grinding motion
on a milling stone was rotary rather than back-andforth, which produced an oval basin rather than a
trough. Much more widespread in America than the
metate and associated with pre-agricultural people for
several thousand years, then used by some agricultural
people as well. Probably used for grinding nuts, roots,
berries and other wild foods.
Mortar: A deep, cup-shaped vessel of stone or wood in which
seeds, grain, corn, etc., were pulverized with a pestle
used with downward force. Bedrock mortars are those
made in large non-portable boulders or rock outcrops.
Neck-banding: See corrugation.

Negative design: A design in which the background or undecorated area appears to be the chief design element.
Negative painting: A technique of pottery decoration in
which the parts of the desired design are covered with
wax, grease, clay, or other substance, and the rest of
the surface painted. When the covering substance is removed, the design appears in the unpainted areas.
Occipital deformation: A form of head deformation in which
the back of the skull is pressed flat, thus widening it.
May be caused accidentally by pressure from cradleboard to which infantâ€™s head is bound.
Ochre: An earthy, often impure, ore of iron, usually called
hematite when red and limonite when yellow or light
brown. Used by Indians for paint.
Olla: A globular-bodied vessel with a small neck and mouth.
When used for water storage, the small mouth reduces
evaporation.

540

Overhanging lines: Horizontal lines cut into the plastic clay
of a pottery vessel, with the tool held at a downward
angle; the incisions are deepest along their upper sides.
Oxidizing atmosphere: Applies to the firing of pottery in
such a way that air is permitted to circulate around the
vessels. This provides an excess of oxygen and produces shades of red, brown, or yellow pottery, depending in part on the minerals present in the clay, and in
part on the temperatures.
Paddle-and-anvil: A technique of shaping pottery walls by
beating the clay into the desired shape, holding a solid
object (the "anvil") against the inner surface and striking the exterior with a small wooden paddle. Also used
in some areas as a finishing technique to obliterate the
seams of coiled pottery.
Palette: A thin tablet of various shapes, with one or more
shallow basins in which to hold or mix paints.
Paste: The mixture of clay and tempering material with
whi~ch pottery is made.
Patina: A discoloration of stone, obsidian, glass, or metal
as the result of exposure to the elements or to chemical
actions in the surrounding soil. As different materials
patinate at different rates under the same conditions,
and some never patinate under any conditions, the
amount of patination seen on an artifact cannot be
used to measure its age unless the kind of material,
local soil conditions, sub-surface drainage, temperatures,
etc., are all taken into consideration. However, no such
scales have been worked out.
Pecking: A technique of shaping an artifact by removing
tiny bits with a hard, pointed stone directed against it.
The surface will be finely pitted as a result, and may
then sometimes be ground or polished, more or less obliterating the peck-marks.
Pendant: An ornament perforated for suspension so as to
hang lengthwise.

Texas Archeological Society

Percussion chipping:
mering.

541

Chipping or flaking stone by ham-

Pestle: An implement of stone or wood, basically cylindrical
in shape, used to pulverize food matter in a mortar. It
may be tapered, provided with a flanged handle, or
otherwise modified from the cylindrical shape.
Pick: A roughly chipped stone tool brought to a point rather
than to a cutting edge.
Piano-convex: Pertains to an artifact with one face more
or less flat and the other convex, particularly to flint
artifacts on which the original concoidal fracture plane
is left smooth and unworked while the humped or convex face is shaped by chipping.
Pleistocene: The glacial epoch or Ice Age, during which
vast continental glaciers advanced and retreated a number of times. Estimates of its duration range from 500,000 to 1,000,000 years. The last major retreat appears
to have occurred about 11,000 years ago in different
parts of the world.
Polished-stone artifacts: In contrast to ground-stone arti]acts, which become smoothed through use rather than
intent, polished-stone arti$acts are those intentionally
shaped by abrading and polishing their surfaces. In
some cases, these artifacts were first roughly shaped by
percussion or pecking, then finished by abrading.
Polychrome ware: Pottery painted with two or more colors
in addition to the background color. Thus, any combination of three or more colors.
Prayer stick: A piece of wood to which may be tied a variety of other objects such as feathers, string, fur, pieces
of bone, etc. Used in ceremonies by Puebloan Indians
of Southwest; sometimes found archeologically in caves.
Pre,. sure flaking: Removal of flakes by applying pressure
against the face or edge of a stone artifact with a small
flaking tool. This was the usual method of finishing
such objects as projectile points, knives, drills, etc., after

542

Texas Archeolo~cal Society

they had been roughly shaped by percussion chipping.
Pressure permitted more control over direction and
amount of fracturing.
Projectile point: A pointed artifact of stone, shell, bone,
wood, metal, or bony scales of garfish, hafted to the tip
of an arrow, atlatl dart, spear, or lance shaft to facilitate
penetration.
Proximal: The reverse of distal; that is, the end nearest one
when used in reference to something held in the hand.
When used in reference to parts of bones (especially
limb bones), the proximal end is that nearest the body.
Punctates: In pottery decoration this refers to indentations
made in the plastic clay with a sharp stick, the hollow
end of a reed, a blunt tool, or a fingernail. Punctates
may also be made in shell and bone artifacts with a
sharply pointed implement, such as a graver.

Rabbit stick: A flat stick or club, curved or recurved in
various degrees, 60 cm. (2 feet) or more in length, found
widely in dry caves of the Southwest and Mexico, and
still used by Hopi Indians to kill rabbits. Also referred
to as a type of boomerang (non-returning), "fending
stick" (to deflect weapons or spears in warfare), "curved
stick", or "curved club". Commonly has sets of parallel
incised lines running lengthwise but discontinuously on
flat faces.
Rasp, rasping stick: An implement notched along edge or
face which, when rubbed with a stick, produces a harsh
rasping noise. May be made of large animal rib or of
wood.
Recent: Often used to embrace the post-Pleistocene or postglacial period, but not an ideal term because in most
other languages, "recent" and "modern" are equivalent.
Reducing atmosphere: Applies to the firing of pottery in
such a way that air is prevented from circulating around
the vessels. This results in a reduction of oxygen and
tends to produce shades of black and gray pottery. See
oxidizing atmosphere.

Texas Archeological Society

543

I~epousse: A pattern in relief produced by hammering or
pressing the reverse side into a mold.
Rocker stamping: A technique of pottery decoration in
which a sharp-edged or toothed implement is moved
back and forth across the plastic clay, each segment
offset from the preceding one, producing a zig-zag line.
Scraper: A piano-convex artifact, usually of stone, with the
under side unworked and the upper side chipped into
one or more cutting edges. Usually named according to
the position of the cutting edge or bit, such as "side
scraper", "end scraper", or "oval scraper". A scraper
which is very thick near one end may be called "snubnosed" or "duck-billed", while one which has a high
ridge along the centerline may be called "turtle-backed".
Scrapers may also be made of potsherds ground to a
cutting edge.
Shaft smoother: See abrading stone. The shaft smoother is
usually a block of coarse-grained stone with a longitudinal groove suitable for fitting part way around an
arrow~ or atlatl-dart shaft.
Shaft straightener: A stone block shaped like a shaft smoother. Sometimes found in pairs which, if clamped over
an arrow, dart, or spear shaft, could be used to bend the
shaft into a straight line. Also applies to bone artifacts
with a hole through which a shaft could be thrust and
the bone used as a wrench to straighten it.
Shell midden: An accumulation of refuse including a large
amount of discarded sea shells (oyster, clam, conch,
etc.) or fresh-water mussels.
Sherd, potsherd: A fragment of a broken vessel.
Site: Any spot producing evidence of human occupation,
directly or indirectly. Thus isolated graves, pictographs,
bed-rock mortar holes, etc., are evidence of human occupation in the vicinity even when no camp refuse is
found.
Slip: Potterâ€™s clay in a very liquid state, used for giving a
fine-grained surface to the vessel, suitable for polishing.

Texas Archeological Society

544

Spall: See flake.

Spatulate: Spoon-shaped or spade-shaped. Used in reference
to celts which spread laterally toward the cutting end.
Spear point: A heavy projectile point, usually more than 10
cm. (4 inches)
point, although
distinguish the
heavy shafts of

long and usually thicker than a dart
there is no accepted scale by which to
two classes. Presumably hafted to the
spears or lances.

Spear-thrower or atlatl: A flat, thin, wooden implement
usually between 45 and 75 cm. (18 and 30 inches) long
and several centimeters wide, having a handle or finger
holds at one end and a spur at the other. The spur may
be carved from the same piece or may be a pointed
piece of bone or antler attached in any of various ways;
it fits into the butt of the missile to be thrown. The
thrower is used with a wide overhead swing and acts as
an extension of the arm, adding great power to the
thrust. The missiles are commonly called "darts", an
unfortunate term for actually they are raore like light
spears or javelins. The "darts" are very similar to
arrows, but much heavier, being 1.5 to 2 meters (5 to 6.5
feet) long, and two or three times as thick as arrows;
they have attached points and are equipped with feathers to stabilize them in flight. The spear-thrower is now
known in only a few parts of the world but at one time
was probably universal. Archeological data show it to
have been in use for many thousands of years before
the bow-and-arrow was invented.
Spindle whorl: An object, usually of clay, shaped like a
disk or a truncated cone, with a hole through its center.
It is fitted on the shaft of a spindle and acts as a stabilizer to reduce wobble. In American archeology, spindle
whorls occur in some areas which are made from potsherds, drilled through the center and trimmed around
the edges to make round disks.
Spokeshave: A form of scraper, usually piano-convex, with
at least one deeply concave edge of suitable size for
scraping down wooden shafts or handles.

Texas Archeological Society

545

Stamping: A technique of pottery decoration in which the
same object is pressed repeatedly into the plastic clay,
leaving a series of identical impressions.
Step-Jret: A decorative pattern characterized by right-angular lines, bars, or figures, interlocked in various ways
in a continuous belt; particularly, interlocking L-shaped
elements.
Stratigraphy: The arrangement of strata (layers, beds, deposits) as to position and order of deposition. Ordinarily, the bottom stratum in a series is the oldest and
the top stratum the youngest, although special conditions may at times alter or even reverse this order. The
strata may be geological (deposited by natural forces),
cultural (due to human occupation), or both. Stratigraphy is an invaluable aid in detern-iining the relative
age of cultural material.
Temper: An aplastic material added to pottery clay to reduce its stickiness and to allow steam to escape through
the walls when the vessel is fired. If steam cannot escape uniformly, the walls crack or bend. The commonest aplastics in Indian pottery are sand and the
following pulverized materials: hard clay, stone (especially limestone and quartz), shell, bone, volcanic ash,
sherds from other vessels, etc.
Tinkler: A small metal cone, usually brass, for attachment
to clothing, saddles, etc., for ornamentation. A favorite
Indian trade item in historic times.
Trailed lines: Broad, shallow incised lines made with a
round-nosed tool.
Twilling: A technique of basketry plaiting in which a diagonal pattern is achieved in any of several ways: overtwo-and-under-two, over-two-and-under-one, over-threeand-under-one, etc.
Twining: A technique of making basketry in which the weft
elements are applied in pairs over the warps. The two
weft elements are usually passed on each side of a warp,

Texas Archeological Society

546

then given a half twist to cross the next warp in reversed position. Slight variations may be made to produce simple patterns.
Type: A grouping of artifacts or other culture traits (e.g.,
details of house construction, burial method, etc.) which
represents a pattern distinctive from other such patterns. This specific combination of features should .be
of some demonstrable historical significance. That is,
it should be more than a random grouping of things that
look more or less alike, and it should have a particular
meaning in terms of origin, development, function, and
distribution in time and space in contrast to other such
combinations. The criteria by which types are established are variable and discovered by analysis, comparison, and plotting in time and space. Ideally, a type
in archeology should have a meaning comparable to that
of a species in biology.
Typology:
types.

A system of analyzing cultural material into

Uni]ace: An artifact with intentional workmanship on only
one face. See piano-convex.
Village site: A relatively permanent occupational area, in
contrast to a campsite.

Warp: A passive element in weaving and basket-making,
usually of stouter material than the active elements or
weirs. In plaiting, both sets of elements are active and
the warps and wefts indistinguishable.
Wash: A thin or watery coat of color applied to pottery; to
tint lightly and thinly.
Weir: An active element in weaving, as opposed to the
warps or passive elements.
Woo]: A synonym for weir, now generally obsolete.

NEWS NOTES
THE 1953 ANNUAL MEETING
The 24th annual meeting of the Texas Archeological
Society was held on October 31, 1953, at the Museum of
the University of Oklahoma in Norman. A get-together
was held the preceding evening in the Oklahoma Memorial
Union Building. The program was opened with an address
of welcome by Dean L. H. Snyder of the Universityâ€™s Graduate College. The following papers were presented:
"The Central Texas Aspect", Edward B. Jelks, National
Park Service, River Basin Surveys, Austin, Texas.
"The Taovayas (Wichita) Indians in Southwestern History", Elizabeth Ann Harper, University of Oklahoma.
"Excavations at the Kincaid Shelter", Dee Ann Suhm
and Dorothy Garner, University of Texas.
"The Life of Primitive Man as Shown by his Environment", Oren F. Evans, University of Oklahoma.
"Archeology and History of the Falcon Dam Area, Lower
Rio Grande Valley", Alex D. Krieger, University of Texas.
A question and answer period on various archeological
problems was held at the conclusion of the above papers,
and an informal gathering held that evening in the Museum,
where the splendid exhibits on Oklahoma archeology were
enjoyed by all. A field trip to archeological sites west of
Norman was made by some members the following day,
Sunday.
A business meeting was held at 1:30 P. M. on October
31, opened by the President, Dr. Robert E. Bell. The Secretary-Treasurer, Edward B. Jelks, read the minutes of the
previous (1952) meeting, which were approved by voice
vote. The Secretary-Treasurer then initiated new business
by reporting on the fiscal condition of the Society. He reported (1) that membership increased from 177 to 236 during the year; and (2) that the Society had a balance on deposit in the First National Bank of Lubbock of $1,480.38 on
August 31, 1953. Receipts of dues as of October 31 brought
the total assets to about $1,800. The cost of publishing Volume 24 of the Bulletin was estimated at $1,000, which would
leave a surplus of about $800 after all bills ~vere paid.

As no Auditing Committee had been appointed to examine the Societyâ€™s books, it was agreed by voice vote to
accept the financial report published on page 261 of the
Bulletin, Volume 24, 1953.
The Editor of Publications, Alex D. Krieger, reported
that Volume 24 of the Bulletin, with 266 pages, was somewhat smaller than that of 1952 because of the cost of publishing the Index earlier in 1953. Zinc cuts were used for
the first time for photographic reproductions in the 1953
Bulletin, and not only proved to be of excellent quality but
resulted in a considerable saving over copper engravings.
Mr. Krieger then spoke about some time-saving methods in
preparing manuscripts and illustrations before submitting
them to ~he Editor.
R. K. Harris, chairman of the Nominating Committee,
presented a slate of nominees for the various offices. This
was adopted by voice vote in lieu of formal balloting. The
list of new officers appears in the front of this Bulletin.
Billy Hanks of San Angelo was appointed chairman of
a Membership Committee, with a request to develop a plan
for increasing our membership. Wilson W. Crook, Jr., of
Dallas was appointed chairman of the Arrangements Committee, charged with selecting a satisfactory location for the
1954 meeting.
Following a vote of thanks to the University of Oklahoma and to Robert E. Bell for providing such excellent
facilities for this meeting, the formal business was concluded. The President, however, asked for informal reports
on local archeological activities, which were given by the
following persons:
L R.K. Harris, on field projects of the Dallas Archeological Society.
2. V.L. Pritchard, vicinity of Weatherford.
3.

Carl Compton, the Denton Archeological Society.

4.

Albert Field, Lampasas area.

5. Ed Jelks, recent field work and publications by Central Texas Archeological Society in Waco (for Frank Watt).
6. Jack T. Hughes, current projects being carried out
by the Panhandle-Plains Historical Society (Canyon).

A RADIOCARBON DATE ON THE
FALCON FOCUS
Just as this bulletin was going to press, word was received from the Radiocarbon Laboratory of the University
of Michigan that an age determination had been made on
charcoal from an excavation made just above Falc6n Dam
in 1â€™951. This excavation was conducted in Site 78B9-4 by
Donald D. Hartle, then field archeologist for the River Basin
Surveys, Smithsonian Institution, with headquarters in Austin under Robert L. Stephenson. The occupation zone was
buried about 11 feet under the top of the Rosita Terrace
(see pp. 136-141 of this volume). The Rosita Terrace in this
vicinity rises about 44 feet above the normal level of the
Rio Grande and is the middle terrace in the series of three
post-glacial terraces found all along the lower Rio Grande
valley.
The 11 feet of overburden was removed by bulldozer
and the occupation zone excavated by trowel (see Hartle
and Stephenson, "Archeological Excavations at the Falc6n
Reservoir, Starr County, Texas", a mimeographed report of
the Smithsonian Institution, 1951). The calculated age of
this charcoal is 4650 plus or minus 300 years or about 2700
B.C. This date applies to the cycle of valley filling represented by the Rosita Terrace, which continued to rise for at
least 11 feet above the occupation zone before a cycle of
valley erosion began. The associated artifacts are typical of
Falc6n Focus, and the date should fall somewhere in the
middle of the total time span of this focus, for its artifacts
are also found in the higher and oldet- Zapata Terrace, and
on a lower and younger terrace of more recent date about 25
feet high. A preliminary test pit was dug in this site by
Jack T. Hughes and assistants in 1950.

resources.

The

membership generally numbers around 1400.
The Society calendar begins in October with the Annual
Meeting,

an

event

that

has

taken

place

since

1929.

Archeologists, professional and avocational, get together to
share information in research sessions and to hear from
nationally renowned luncheon and banquet speakers. Friday is a
popular evening for the public forum with high profile speakers
and artifact identification. Meetings will be he~d in Lubbock
