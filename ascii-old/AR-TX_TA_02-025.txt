Abstract
Medina Consultants, Inc., San Antonio, Texas contracted with Tierras Antiguas Archaeology to
conduct a cultural resources survey of the footprint and access right-ofway for a proposed
cellular tower in Rockport, Aransas County, Texas. The Federal Communications Commission’s
Nationwide Programmatic Agreement (PA; 47 CFR Part 1) requires that a cultural resources
survey be conducted prior to such an undertaking. No Antiquities Permit was required, but
subsequent review of this archaeological report was provided by the Texas Historical
Commission’s Archeology Division.
Tierras Antiguas conducted the survey on October 30, 2010. A thorough pedestrian survey of the
surface area was concluded before four shovel tests were excavated. No cultural material was
observed either on the surface, or in any of the four shovel tests excavated within the cell tower
footprint and access road right-of-way.
As such, Tierras Antiguas Archaeology recommended that Medina Consulting, Inc. be allowed
to oversee development of the tract as planned. However, Tierras Antiguas further recommended
that if any previously undiscovered cultural resources were encountered during development,
work should immediately be halted in the vicinity until such finds could be examined and
evaluated by Tierras Antiguas, or by any qualified archaeological consultant, and by the Texas
Historical Commission.

Introduction
Medina Consulting, Inc. is the
consulting firm employed to acquire
clearance for the erection of a cellular
tower known as the Redfish Lane Cell
Tower to be constructed in Aransas
County, Texas (Figures 1-3). Medina
contracted with Terras Antiguas
Aechaeological Investigations (TAAI)
to conduct an archaeological
investigation of the proposed tower site.
Although no public funding was
involved in the proposed development
of the property, the Federal
Communications Commission’s
Nationwide Programmatic Agreement
(PA; 47 CFR Part 1) requires that a
cultural resources survey be conducted
prior to such an undertaking.
In October, 2010, TAAI conducted an
on-line review of the Archeological Site
Atlas (Atlas) of the Texas State Historic
Preservation Office (SHPO). The
purpose of this review was to identify
any listed or potential archaeological
resources within the proposed Redfish
Lane Tower Area of Potential Effect
(APE).

County.

In addition, seven aerial photographs
ranging in age from 1954 through 2010
were reviewed, along with five current
on-site photographs, a detailed
architectural engineer’s drawing, a
geological map, and an Aransas County
soils publication with maps of the
proposed project location. The proposed
cell tower site is located in a semiFigure 2. Location of the tower site in central Aransas

has apparently been used primarily for
1

water tank storage, but the sand dunes
and sand deposits that cover the site
have a potential to contain buried and
intact cultural material.
A review of the Atlas indicated that the
tower site had not been subjected to a
cultural resources survey. Although
there was a survey conducted just north
of the tower site, it was done in 1927 by
personnel from the Witte Museum in
San Antonio, under standards that are
not acceptable in accordance with the Figure 3. Location of the Redfish Lane Tower Site.
current Texas Antiquities Code. Even
under those less than stringent standards, five open campsite occupation sites were recorded.
Since then, a few sporadic and small-scale professional surveys conducted within one and onehalf mile of the tower site have documented an additional six sites with pottery, stone tools,
faunal remains, and shell middens. One site also contained square nails, musket balls, and coins
indicating it was occupied during the Civil War and Republic of Texas periods (Atlas 2010).
In sum, the tower site is situated in a portion of Rockport County that is demonstrably rich in
archaeological sites, and it was therefore recommended that an archaeological survey of the
proposed tower footprint and access right-of-way be conducted before construction could begin.

Project Setting
Geology and Soils
The project area where the tower is to be
located is further illustrated in Figures 4 and 5.
Geologically, it is to be situated on barrier
island and beach deposits (Qbb) of fine-grained
sands with a scarcity of oyster shells. In some
areas there may be relict beach ridges, as well
as locally active sand dunes (Barnes 1975)
(Figure 4). Many of the archaeological sites
discovered within one and one-half mile of the
Redfish Lane tower site were located on these

same deposits (Atlas 2010).
project area (Barnes 1982).

As shown in Figure 5, the soil type within the
project area is Falfurrias association fine grained sand (FA). These aeolian (windborn) deposits form dune rises with
backslopes, sideslopes, and footslopes, and
the rises can be 80 inches or higher above the
coastal water table (Web Soil 2010).

Cultural Context and Chronology
Prehistoric Chronology
Paleoindian Period
Generally encompassing the period between 12,000 and 9,000 years ago, some of the earliest
occupants of the Americas inhabited Texas (although earlier sites are now being documented
[e.g. Adovasio 2002). The Paleoindian period began toward the close of the Pleistocene.
Diagnostic artifacts of the early Paleoindian interval include Clovis and Folsom projectile points.
Angostura, Wilson, Golondrina, St. Mary’s Hall, and Barber (among a few others) appear during
the late Paleoindian interval. In Southeast Texas, Patterson (1995:252) notes that “There are
considerable data to indicate that San Patrice and Early Side-Notched were the principal point
types in Southeast Texas during the Early Paleoindian period.”
Small bands of nomadic, big-game hunters followed herds of Late Pleistocene fauna, including
mammoth, mastodons, bison, camel, and horse, across North America (Black 1989). They also
exploited a wide diversity of plants and animals used for subsistence by these early, such as
turtles and tortoises, alligators, mice, badgers, and raccoons (Collins 1995:381; Collins and
Brown 2000). Known Clovis sites include killsites, quarries, caches, open campsites, ritual sites,
and burials (Collins 1995:381–383). The Folsom interval follows Clovis, and Folsom artifacts
are fairly common in Central and South Texas. However, along the Central Texas Coast only
surface artifacts provide evidence of a Paleoindian occupation, with no stratigraphically intact
campsites thus discovered. Ricklis (1997) surmises this is due to rising sea levels that have
inundated Paleoindian sites.

With the possible exception of Berclair Terrace (although not dated; Sellards 1940),
archaeological evidence suggests the decline and extinction of mammoth, mastodon, horse and
camel before 10,000 B.P., and giant bison (Bison antiquus) by 8000 B.P. Human hunters were
forced to concentrate on deer, antelope, and other medium-size or smaller game. Changes in the
subsistence base required technological shifts that mark the beginning of a new cultural period
known as the Archaic.
Early Archaic
According to Ricklis (1997) the Early Archaic period along the Central Texas Coast ranges from
ca. 7500-4200 B.P. (years before present). Lithic reduction, and oyster shell middens with edgeflaked clamshell knives and scrapers are fairly common. Subsistence items likely included not
only oysters, but some fish and mammals. Yet, the Early Archaic period is poorly understood
along the coastal area.
Late Archaic
Although archaeologists working in other regions of Texas recognize a Middle Archaic period,
Ricklis (1997:13) posits that “Currently available information strongly suggests a hiatus, or at
least a significant reduction in shoreline occupation, between ca. 4200 and 3000 B.P.”. This was
likely due to a rapid rise in sea level and a highstand during that timeframe. Thus, the shores of
the Gulf Coast were probably not occupied.
After 3000 B.P. the area was once again occupied with marked intensity. Dart points commonly
found on post-3000 B.P. sites include Kent, Godley, Marcos, Ensor, Matamoras, and Catan.
Shell tools made from venus, oyster, and whelk shells are also common. Pottery also appears at
Late Archaic sites ca. A.D. 500-1050. Dense shell middens along the coast also include the
faunal remains of fish and deer.
Late Prehistoric
The term “Late Prehistoric” is commonly used to designate the period following the Late
Archaic, and along the Central Texas Gulf Coast is generally thought of as spanning the period
3000-420 B.P. (Ricklis 1997). Arrow points, unifacial end scrapers, and drills were designed
beginning with the reduction of blade cores. Pottery with sandy paste and an asphalt coat is
common, as are ceramic pipes and bone and shell ornaments. In the later part of the period
termed the Rockport Phase, Perdiz arrow points and bifacial knives complement sandy paste
pottery called Rockport. During the Rockport Phase sites consist of both large shell middens with
fauna and fish remains along the shorelines, as well as less intensively used sites along upland
areas in the lower reaches of streams where deer and bison were exploited.
Historical Background
Spanish Exploration
Recorded History of the Texas Gulf Coast begins in 1519 when Francisco Garay, the Spanish
governor of Jamaica sent Alonzo Alvarez de Pineda on a mapping expedition of the coast of
“Las Floridas” from Vera Cruz to present-day Pensacola. Garay was interested in establishing
a colony in the New World as near to Hernando Cortez’ armies as possible in order to share in
4

the riches that Cortez had found in Mexico. Also on Garay’s mind was the possibility that he
might discover the fabled Strait of Ainan, which was supposed to be a direct waterway through
the North American Continent to China (Scurlock 1974:17).
Upon de Pineda’s return, Garay sent a group of colonists under the command of Diego de
Camargo to settle near the mouth of the Rio de las Palmas (the Rio Grande). The group set sail
in the summer of 1520, arriving safely at their destination. However, they were met with
resistance by the local natives and left the area in peril of life and limb. They eventually arrived
in Vera Cruz and were permitted to settle with Cortez in (modern-day) Mexico (Scurlock
1974:17).
Garay, not at all pleased with this turn of events, had petitioned the Spanish Crown and received
a grant to colonize in the area from the Rio Papacy (Tampico) to the West Coast of Florida (the
area called Michel). On June 26, 1523, Garay himself sailed away from Jamaica with a flotilla
of 16 ships. His destination was certainly not the West Coast of Florida which was many
hundreds leagues north of Cortez’ fabulous holdings in Mexico. The expedition made straight
for Rio de Las Palmas where Garay sent Gonzalo de Campo on a scouting mission in the area.
After receiving an unfavorable report from Campo the flotilla put to sea again and eventually
arrived at Rio Pañuco. Cortez would have none of this encroachment on his territory and quickly
subdued Garay, effectively putting an end to his search for fame and fortune (Scurlock 1974).
Garay’s ill fortune did nothing to cool the gold fever that was infecting Spain at the time. An
old rival of Cortez was next to try for a share of his New World plunder. On November 17,
1526, Pánfilo de Narváez left Santiago de Cuba with a royal charter to settle a colony at Rio de
las Palmas. The Narváez expedition had worst luck than did that of Garay. After more than two
years of hardship, including landfall in Florida (instead of southern Texas), the survivors were
marooned on the Texas coast in November, 1528. All were either killed by Indians or died,
except for the Treasurer of the expedition, Álvar Núñez Cabeza de Vaca, and three others
(Alonzo Castillo Maldonado, Andrés Dorantes de Carranza, and a Moor named Estevanico).
During their six-year sojourn with the coastal Indians, these six are very likely to have set foot
on Mustang and Padre Islands. Cabeza de Vaca and his companions eventually managed to
escape and made their way across the Southwest to arrive safely at the West Coast settlement of
Culiacan in May of 1536 (Scurlock 1974:16).
The next recorded event within the area is the wreck of the Spanish Plate Fleet on Padre Island
in 1554. At least three ships of this fleet were cast ashore during a Gulf storm. Of the more than
1,000 persons aboard, only a made it to shore, and only two of these lived to tell their story.
The ill-fated group that tried to walk back to Rio Pánuco was decimated by Indians, and Fray
Marcos de Mena was the only survivor. One survivor, Francisco Vasquez, elected to return to
the shipwreck site, where he was rescued by a salvage expedition commanded by Captain Angel
de Villafana (Scurlock 1974).
French and English Encroachment
The French were the next upon the scene when Henri Joutel, chronicler of the expedition of Rene
Robert Cavalier, Sieur de La Salle, records their presence in the latitude of Mustang and Padre
Islands in January 1687 (Writer’s 1950:51). When word of the French incursions into Texas
5

reached Mexico, the Spanish rose to the occasion by sending five expeditions to the region under
the command of Alonso de Leon between 1686 and 1690 in search of the French, with orders
to dispel them. The last of these excursions resulted in the burning of the French Fort Saint
Louis (which was already abandoned), and the establishment of the Spanish Mission of San
Francisco de los Tejas in charge of Fr. Damian Massanet (Weddle 1996).
Still suspicious of intervention by other countries, the Viceroy of Spain set up a watch on the Bar
of San Miguel (probably Mustang Island), and Spanish soldiers patrolled the coastal islands
(Writer’s 1950:52). About the same time, evidence of English encroachment was found when
Antonio Gil y Barbo, a Spanish official in East Texas discovered an abandoned English vessel
with a load of bricks, lumber, and farming implements near the mouth of the Sabine River
(Bolton 1970:425).
In 1766 this same fear of intrusion prompted Governor of Coahuila, Diego Ortíz Parilla to lead
an expedition from San Juan Bautista on the Rio Grande northeast to La Bahia, and then down
the coast to the Rio Grande. Resulting from this mission were the first detailed descriptions of
St. Joseph, Mustang, and Padre Islands, and the naming of Corpus Christi Bay. One writer states
that Parilla’s party surveyed a road down Padre Island from Corpus Christi Pass to Santiago
Point, marking important leagues with metal plates fastened to mahogany driftwood posts.
Offshore, along the coast, Jose de Evia sailed in 1786 on a mapping expedition from Tampico
to modern-day western Florida (Bolton 1970:133). Evidently, since he covered the same
territory, he was refining the de Pineda map of 1519.
Early Settlement and the Civil War
In 1747, the commander of La Bahía Presidio, Joaquin Prudencio de Orobio y Basterra, explored
Corpus Christi Bay. This expedition resulted in the proposed establishment of Mission Nuestra
Señora del Soto near the mouth of the Nueces River. However, the mission was never established
due to poor planning for needed provisions and drought conditions. Beginning in the 1760s,
ranchers venturing northward from the modern-day Tamaulipas, Mexico region began settling
in the Nueces River valley. In spite of the Spanish Crown government’s attempts to establish a
fort at Live Oak Point in the late 1700s, Indian encroachments, and its desolate location from
entrenched Spanish settlements never enabled the planned fort to gain a foothold. About the
same time, the Spanish established a customhouse in Copano Bay named El Copáno, across from
present-day Aransas County.
Comanche and Lipan depredations caused the area to be abandoned by Mexican ranchers in the
early 1800s, but in 1824 treaties were put in place that again allowed ranching to continue. In
1828, the area that is now Aransas County became part of a Spanish government-allotted
empressario grant to James Power and James Hewetson. The agreement was that these two men
would bring both Irish and Mexican settlers into the region.
Settlement continued to thrive in the 1820s. James Power and James Hewetson acted as agents
for many Irish families to settle along the east edge of the Nueces River, and John McMullen and
James McGloin received empressario contracts to settle families along the eastern edge of the
Nueces River in 1828. Henry Kinney established a trading post and fort on Corpus Christi Bay
in 1839.

Following Texas’ independence from Mexico in 1836, the entire area that is now Aransas
County was encompassed by what the newly formed Republic recognized as Refugio County.
Depredations in the immediate area by Comanches, Karankawas, and Mexican bandits in the late
1830s and early 1840s nearly caused the area to be nearly deserted by Anglo-Americans.
It was not until the late 1840s and 1850s under the auspices of Texas statehood and then as the
41st state of the United States that Aransas County began to develop as a populated area. The
construction of the Aransas Railroad Company through the area was a major contributor to the
development that transpired (Long 2008).
Civil War to Present
Most Civil War battles that took place were naval battles off the coast of Aransas County.
However, in 1862 marines from the U.S. destroyed Aransas on St. Joseph’s Island. Subsequent
battles both on and offshore ensued as a result of the Confederacy’s desire to retain hold of the
port areas for smuggling the all-important cotton cash crop through the area. As a result, much
of the Aransas County area was evacuated. Following the War, its prime location to the Gulf of
Mexico provided an impetus for wealthy cattlemen to use Aransas County as a major shipping
point for beef raised in nearby Fulton and Rockport.
Nevertheless, Aransas County remained a county with few residents. Cattle packers built large
wharf pens and shipped huge numbers of beef cattle from the area to New Orleans. The
construction of the San Antonio and Aransas Pass Railroad (later the Texas and New Orleans)
in the 1870s and 1880s to ship beef products through the area furthered the development of
Aransas County. These developments contributed to the populous so that in 1889, a new county
courthouse was constructed, and by 1890 there were 1,824 people living in the county.
Shortly after 1900, entrepreneurs attempted to dig deeper and open ports and piers that could
establish Aransas County as a major Gulf Coast shipping port, but they failed. Instead, major
ports were established from deeper waters at Corpus Christi. Adding to the woes of potential
shipping ports in Aransas County, a typical hurricane landed along the Aransas coast in 1919,
and several others have pounded the area since. Nevertheless, the local economy was boosted
by the exploitation of Gulf Coast shrimp and shipbuilding. The Gulf Intercoastal Waterway now
runs through Aransas Bay and serves as a major shipping magnet for products throughout the
world (Long 2008).
Previous Archaeology
Archaeological sites within the area were first documented by George Martin and Wendell Potter
during their survey of the Texas Gulf Coast in the 1920s and 1930s (Martin 1930, 1931; Potter
1931). Later, the Workers Progress Administration and the University of Texas conducted
archaeological investigations on several sites in the county (Atlas 2010; Ricklis 1997). As of
June 2008, there were 130 archaeological sites and state archaeological landmarks recorded
within Aransas County (Atlas 2010). They include shipwrecks, open campsites, shell middens,
lithic scatters, sites with human remains, an historic fish camp, shellcrete structures, a Civil War
fort (41AS82), Civil War saltworks (41AS95), a customs house with associated post office and
7

stores (41AS109), and the George W. Fulton mansion (41AS79). When this project was
undertaken, there were 11 previously known archaeological sites within 1½ miles (ca. 2,414
meters) of the project area. They are briefly highlighted in Table 1.

Project Goals and Methods
Goals
The project goals focused on archaeological issues that could be addressed by the types of data
obtained through pedestrian survey, along with limited shovel testing. The topics addressed were
site type, distribution, density, size, depth, and stratigraphy. The theoretical framework is
structured around patterns of settlement, mobility, subsistence, and social systems for the South
Texas region.
The goals of the project were to (1) locate and record any cultural artifacts in the project area
using a systematic survey methodology, (2) quantify site size, as well as depth, and stratigraphy,
and (3) place any diagnostic artifacts within the regional time frame.
Methods
Prior to the
archaeological
survey, the area
to be impacted
had been staked
with survey
stakes, thus
c l e a r l y
delineating the
area to be further
d i s tu rbed. In

Archaeology
Figure 6. Aerial photograph showing shovel test locations.
Survey Standards,
a systematic, 100% pedestrian survey of the delineated tract was conducted.
Following the pedestrian survey, four shovel tests were excavated in the area to be impacted
(Figure 6). Shovel tests were dug in 10-cm levels, to 70 cm below the surface, and all sediments
were screened through 1/4-inch wire mesh. In accordance with a designed research plan, all
redundant artifacts recovered from shovel tests were not to be collected, but were to be placed
in the upper 10 cm of the backfilled shovel test.

Results of the Investigations
Surface Examination and Shovel Testing
Our initial observation of the surface of the project area indicated that the surface of the access
road right-of-way area was not only void of vegetation, but also contained a moderate amount
of oyster shells mixed with plastic fragments and some metal fragments; no cultural materials
indicative of either a prehistoric or historic component (e.g., ceramics, chipped stone, bottle
glass, etc.). Our initial impression that this was an area hat had once been the site of a circular
storage tank, that subsequently had been backfilled with intrusive sediments and then bladed was
confirmed by the results of Shovel Tests 1 and 2 (see Figure 6). Both shovel tests revealed that
the oyster shells were a surficial scatter only, and pale brown coarse sand was encountered to a
depth of 70 cmbs, with a strong, pungent odor of petroleum. The southern portion of the site was
covered with dense grasses, but appeared to be very unnaturally mounded and hummocky.
Because of the dense vegetation, surface visibility was extremely poor. However, Shovel Tests
3 and 4 revealed pale brown coarse sand to a depth of approximately 40 cmbs, underlain by pale
brown coarse sand with gray coarse sandy loam mottling to 70 cmbs. No evidence of cultural
material was found in any of the four shovel tests.

Summary, Conclusions, and Recommendations
A 100-percent pedestrian survey of the surface that offered from 0 to 100-percent surface
visibility within the project area was conducted, and four shovel tests excavated to between 70
cm below the surface, but no evidence of neither prehistoric nor historic occupation was found.
Therefore, we recommend that the project should proceed as currently designed by the project
sponsor. The project should be considered as having “no effect” on any properties considered
as eligible for nomination to the National Register of Historic Places or inclusion in the State
Archeological Landmarks Program. As such, the project should proceed without further
archaeological work. However, if any cultural resources are encountered during construction
within the APE, work should immediately be halted in the vicinity until such finds are examined
and evaluated by Tierras Antiguas, or by any qualified archaeological consultant, and by the
Texas Historical Commission.
