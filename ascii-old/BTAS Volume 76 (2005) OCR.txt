Foreword

Volume 56 of this Bulletin was dedicated to
Thomas N. Campbell. Now, in Volume 76, we
again honor Dr. Campbell with a memoriam to
this same scholar who touched many of our lives
and served this Society in many capacities for
many years. I had the privilege to know him during my studies at the University of Texas at Austin and he had considerable influence on my own
research. His door was always open. As Dee Ann
notes in her remembrance, he was an indefatigable researcher and assumed that all others were
the same. When I expressed interest in researching the historic Caddo but confessed that I did not
know French and might therefore have difficulties
with some historic documents, he told me "If I
could teach myself Spanish, I am sure that you
can teach yourself French."
Dr. Campbell worked throughout Texas during
his career, and the topics of his research covered
the breadth of the prehistory and history of the
state. I thus believe that the varied topics in this
volume would be of interest to him. Given his
interest in the historic contact era, he would
certainly be interested in the articles on the Spanish
missions in Victoria and the Presidio San Saba in
Menard, particularly in the way the authors use a
variety of archeological and documentary evidence
to interpret building episodes and techniques. And,
I have no doubt that he would enjoy reading how
Kathleen Gilmore has brought together small
pieces of information to tell us about the people
who came to our shores with La Salle. The
annotated bibliography by Lemee would also
intrigue Dr. Campbell as it excerpts small pieces
of information from a variety of archival
documents and published sources to show
European and Native American activities between
1629 and 1758. When I talked with Dr. Campbell
in his campus office, he maintained a type of
annotated bibliography organized, not by year, but

by the name of each Native American group. Each
time he encountered the name of a group, he would
make a note of the comment, the author, and where
the document or reference could be found and
place it in the file for that group.
The other articles would also, I hope, have
been of interest to him. Campbell's work in the Big
Bend region continues to be a significant contribution, and Sam Cason's article comparing sites in
Presidio and Brewster counties continues to build
on Campbell's work. Martin's work in Cooke and
Grayson counties would have appealed to Campbell.
Like Martin, he often worked in areas of the state
where there had been limited prior work. Bill brings
us up to date with the archeological record and
describes the richness of the historic and prehistoric sites in that part of the state. Certainly
Campbell would have relished the efforts of Alvarez
and Taylor to learn about human behavior using
dental and isotopic data. Since he often used collections made years and decades before him, Campbell
would appreciate Tim Perttula's efforts to publish
about long forgotten excavations at two Caddoan
sites in east Texas. And, last, I think he would have
enjoyed the book reviews. Several of them are quite
long, equating in length to some of the articles.
This is because several of the authors sought to
thoughfully analyze the content and provide their
own thoughts, critiques, and comments on the publications. By so doing, they improve our abilities to
understand a broader context for each book, in much
the same way that Campbell did when you spoke
with him. He could always pull from his vast storehouse of knowledge to help students understand the
broader context and hone their thinking. This ability to share with others his knowledge and to encourage you to explore new ideas was remarkable.
Thus, it is with pleasure that this Bulletin is dedicated to Thomas Nolan Campbell and his contributions to Texas archeology.

to be welcome. I hope that this volume comes
close to their outstanding tenures as Bulletin

ABSTRACT
Archeological excavations at two sites (41VTl0 and 41VT11) of Mission Espiritu Santo de Zuniga yielded
significant data about the architectural layouts of each location. The 1997 and 1998 field schools of the Texas
Archeological Society (TAS) conducted large-scale investigations at these mission sites, thereby helping to
expose considerable architectural features at both sites. Since no maps or information about the arrangement of
the mission buildings or their architectural style have yet been found in historical documents of the Spanish
Colonial era, the archaeological investigations provide the primary source of data concerning the organization
and architectural methods used to construct the rnissions. 1 This article compares and contrasts the two sites,
revealing both similarities and differences in the mission structures and layout. Given that the mission buildings
at 41VT11 are more intact than those uncovered at 41VT10, inferences are made regarding the overall plan and
construction style of the second location of the mission based on observations made at its third location.
Following a brief discussion on the history of Espiritu Santo and the mission system in Spanish Texas, we offer
a sum:mary of each site and a comparison of the two.

HISTORICAL BACKGROUND
Prompted by La Salle's establishment of a
French fort and colony in lands claimed by Spain,
Mission Espiritu Santo de Zuniga was originally
established in 1722 near Matagorda Bay in presentday Jackson County (Chipman 1992). Once discovered by Spanish officials, the site of La Salle's
ruined colony was selected by the Spanish to serve
as the location for a new military fort, known as
Presidio La Bahia. The mission was founded in
association with the Presidio La Bahia and was
initially intended for the conversion of Karankawa
bands (Cocos, Cujanes, Guapites, Carancaguases,
and Copanes) living along the Texas coast between the Nueces and Brazos rivers. In addition,
the mission and presidio complexes were meant to
create a presence in the area in hopes of protecting
Spanish-claimed lands from the encroaching
French. Conditions at the first location of the mission and presidio proved to be harsh and unforgiving (Mounger 1959). Relations with the Karankawa
were less than friendly and missionization (i.e.,
both the process of converting and assimilating

the native population) attempts were hardly successful. As a result, plans were made to move both
the presidio and the mission to a new, more hospitable location inland along the Guadalupe River
(Almazan 1726). The chosen area of the Guadalupe
River valley was inhabited by the Aranama (sometimes called J aranama or Xaraname) and Tamique
Indians, native groups whom the Spanish believed
would more readily accept the Christian faith. Furthermore, the area was believed to be more suitable for habitation with an abundance of local
resources necessary for survival.
The Spanish moved the mission in ca. 1725
from its first location along Garcitas Creek to the
Guadalupe River, to a spot that is today called
Riverside Park within the city of Victoria. Archival and archeological evidence suggests that the
friars moved the mission to this new location before the original presidio was transferred and before they were given official permission to relocate from the original site (Hindes et al.
1999:92).
The second site (41VTl0) of the mission may
have initially served as a visita or interim mission

before the third site (41VTl1) of Mission Espiritu
Santo was established. The third location was
founded sometime in 1726 along the Guadalupe
River in present-day Mission Valley. Although it
is unclear how long the second location of the
mission was occupied, and in what capacity, current research indicates that the Riverside Park location continued to operate while the third location was in use (Hindes et al. 1999). Cultural materials, such as majolica wares produced during
the last half of the 18th century, recovered from
various excavations at the second location and
archival data suggest that the site was occupied
through the first half of the eighteenth century
(Hindes et al. 1999:93). The reason the second
location of the mission may have remained open
could have been because of the large number of
Aranama groups in the area. Possibly, it may have
functioned as an outlier mission that helped to
serve the large number of Indians brought into the
mission system.
The third location of Espfritu Santo, like the
second location, was in the Guadalupe River valley
and operated from 1726 until 1749 after which it
was moved a final time to the San Antonio River in
present-day Goliad, Texas. The fourth location continued to serve primarily as a mission for the
Aranama and to a lesser extent the Tamique, although other groups are noted as having resided at
the site as well (Forrestal 1931 ). The final location
of the mission would remain open until the early
1800s. It was formally secularized in the 1830s and
the mission lands were redistributed, although not
among the native residents (Ramsdell 1938). Many
of the mission Indians had married into the Mexican population. Others joined Father De Leon, their
minister at the mission, at another location on the
San Antonio River where he attempted to train them
as independent farmers (Ramsdell 1938). Still others joined the Tonkawa and other tribes, perhaps in
an effort to return to their traditional ways of life.
All of the various locations of the Espfritu
Santo Mission were administered by priests and
friars of the Franciscan order. The purpose of these
missions, along with the numerous other frontier
missions established in Texas, was to introduce
the Catholic faith to the indigenous population
and to civilize the region (Walter 2000). Ideally, it
was hoped that through the "civilization" of the
Indian population, Spain could convert the mission Indians into loyal subjects of the Spanish
crown. This in turn would help to secure and hold

the lands claimed in northern New Spain. The
missions were to serve not only as Christianizing
institutions but also as schools where neophytes
were trained in agriculture, herding, and various
other skills including blacksmithing and weaving
(Bolton 1915). Theoretically, the missions were
only to last 10 years, after which time, it was
believed, the missionaries would no longer be
needed. Within 10 years time the conversion process was to be complete, and the lands of the
mission were to be divided among the newly converted Indians who would farm and independently
own the land (Habig 1977).
Franciscan missions in eighteenth-century
Texas, although varied, shared similar organization, layout, and management patterns. Initially, the
missions would receive grants to cover the costs of
founding the institutions (Bolton 1960). Friars stationed at each mission were typically given a small
yearly stipend that was frequently used to buy supplies for the mission (Castaneda 1936). Over time
the missions were intended to become self sufficient. Like other missions, Espiritu Santo would
eventually support itself through cattle ranching
(Ramsdell 1949). Ultimately, Espfritu Santo would
become one of the largest cattle ranching operations in Spanish Colonial Texas. Goods were
brought in via mule train and necessary supplies
were oftentimes secured from the older, more-established missions (Bolton 1960). Both the San Antonio and Guerrero missions, for example, were
relied upon to supply the Espfritu Santo missions.
Typically, a.minimum of two priests were stationed at each site, but it was not uncommon for
only one friar to be present at a mission (Bolton
1915). In addition, two to three soldiers and their
families were usually assigned to the mission to
help oversee the instruction of the neophytes and to
provide protection. When possible, Christianized
Indians from other missions were brought to newly
established missions to help with the conversion
process (Chipman 1992; Weber 1992). The missions were meant to serve as the new homes for the
native populations where they were introduced to
Christianity and Spanish culture. The Indians also
provided the much-needed labor force necessary
for the success of the missions (Weddle 1968).
In general, the Spanish missions were placed
close to streams and along high knolls or hills whenever possible (Corbin 1989). It was also important
for the missions to be near Indian camps where
missionaries could easily proselytize the native

Walte1; Hindes, and Boyd-Spanish Mission Architecture 3
populations (Eaton 1989). Other considerations for
site location included a good source of water, arable land for farming and ranching, and available
resources of wood and stone. Once a site was selected, a crude church or chapel was typically the
first structure to be built (Walter 2000). The construction of Texas missions varied depending on
the types of raw materials available at each location, however, all of the first temporary buildings
were of jacal construction. Jacal construction uses
upright poles set into wall trenches and thatched
roofs (Fox 199l:xv). At many early missions, the
initial church was commonly built with less permanent materials such as wattle and daub and later
replaced with stone construction. Once the church
was built other buildings were added including
housing for the friars, a granary, storerooms, workshops, and living quarters for the mission Indians
and the soldiers.
At Espiritu Santo many of the living quarters
may have consisted of small huts or jacales that
were never replaced with stone structures. We suspect this because at the final location of the mission
in Goliad, a number of mission Indian quarters
were described as jacal structures that were made
of brush and plastered with clay and thatched with
grass (Castaneda 1936:180). In general, the mission buildings formed an enclosure around a plaza
or courtyard area where chores were usually carried out. Typically, these mission enclosures would
form a roughly square or quadrangle shape. Storerooms, workshops, and residences commonly lined
the inside of the mission walls. The mission
churches varied in their layout and shape. At the
more established missions in places like San Antonio and Goliad, the churches were either basilican
or cruciform in shape. These larger more enduring
churches usually had roofs formed of low masonry
domes or tunnel vaults. Smaller, less permanent
churches and other minor structures had roofs that
were low-pitched and constructed from timber
(Newcomb 1990:27-28).
Access to the interior area of the mission was
usually limited. Given the location of these sites
along the northern frontier, defense was a principal concern for both the presidios and the missions. Hence, the mission structures were frequently placed close to one another and often enclosed by a compound or palisade wall to provide
protection from outside attacks or raids (a common occurrence at missions and presidios in eighteenth century south Texas).

MISSION LAYOUT AND
ARCHITECTURE AT 41VT10
Site 41VTl0, known as the Tonkawa Bank site,
represents the second location of Mission Espiritu
Santo (Hindes et al. 1999). Attention was first called
to the site in 1922, then privately owned, when
local historian John Jarratt observed cultural remains across the site including stone ruins and part
of a human arm bone (Hindes et al. 1999). In 1930
Jarratt conducted limited test excavations around
the site and recovered majolica, stone tools, nativemade pottery, burned rocks, bone, and metates
(Jarratt 1966b). Subsequent investigations followed
including work by A. M. Woolsey from the University of Texas at Austin in 1932 who only worked
on the prehistoric component of the site. The property was purchased by the city of Victoria in 1940
for the development of Riverside Park and subsequent constmction for the park continued into the
1990s (Boyd 2004). In 1965 Jarratt returned to the
site with a small group of volunteers to excavate
within the remaining stone ruins. In addition to
exposing a number of structures, Jarratt also located three burials believed to be associated with
the mission occupation of the site. In 1978
avocational archeologist E. H. Schmiedlin completed 11 auger tests across the site followed by test
trenching carried out by archeologists from the University of Texas at San Antonio (UTSA). UTSA
archeologists would later return to the site in 1989
to conduct a survey and complete shovel testing in
preparation for a children's playground to be built
to the southeast of the mission ruins (Hindes et al.
1999). Finally, in 1998 the TAS completed extensive excavations of the site focusing on exposing
foundations and other intact features. All of the
previous research at the mission site has contributed to a better understanding of the mission site
and its formal layout.
Site 41 VTlO shares in common many of the
same basic characteristics as other Spanish missions. For example, its physical setting mirrors that
of other Spanish missions. In particular, the site is
located on a high spot near water, in this case a
bluff just above the Guadalupe River. Also important for this location was its proximity to huntergatherer groups such as the Aranama and Tamique
that lived along the Guadalupe River valley (Walter
1997). Establishing a mission near the homelands
of native groups that the friars hoped to proselytize
is another feature that Espiritu Santo shares with

4

Texas Archeological Society

other missions. Furthermore, access to resources such
as wood and stone were undoubtedly considerations
for choosing an appropriate mission location. Based
on the amount of stone construction and evidence
for jacal structures, building materials were readily
available within the vicinity of site 41VTl0. Other
similarities include the type and arrangement of buildings found at the second site of Espiritu Santo which
is discussed in more detail below.
Because the missions at 41 VTIO and 41 VTll
were built within about a year of each other by the
same group of Spaniards, they display some similarities in layout and architecture. The following
discussion seeks to synthesize the currently available archival and archeological data pertaining to
the layout and architectural details for the mission
complex at 41VTl0. Reasonable inferences are then
made regarding the layout and architectural details
for the mission complex at 41VTIO. Ultimately,
the layout and architectural details for 41VTl1 are
examined and then compared and contrasted with
what is known about both missions in order to
make educated guesses about how the mission complex at 41 VTIO was constructed.
In examining the archeological and architectural data for 41VT10, particular emphasis is placed
on assessing the historical accuracy of three recon-

struction sketches of the mission. The primary and
best-known reconstruction sketch is the one produced by artist Tom Jones in the 1970s (Figure 1),
and the original is a large format drawing at the
Office of the Victoria Parks and Recreation Department. Two other smaller (page-sized) drawings were
done by local historian and avocational archeologist Jarratt; one dates to 1965 (Figure 2) and the
other is undated (Figure 3) but presumably was
drawn in the 1960s. Jarratt conducted archeological
investigations on and around site 41 VTIO, which
he called the Toncahua Bank or Bluff site (now
Tonkawa Bank site), in the 1920s and 1930s and
then again in the 1960s after the site area was bulldozed (Hindes et al. 1999:80-83). Jarratt based his
sketch maps on the archeological remains he observed and recorded, and Tom Jones based his drawing on the sketches by Jarratt. It is interesting that
all three drawings, while similar in many respects,
are also quite different.
Mission components defined during the archaeological investigation of site 41 VTIO include:
(a) the stone and cobble footings of a two-room
rectangular structure (the probable church); (b)
rubble or cobble alignments representing walls or
enclosures; (c) postholes which most likely represent a wooden stockade wall and a fence placed

and (g) a cemetery. It should be
noted that due to extensive land
modifications, the archeological
deposits and features at the site
are highly ephemeral making any
interpretations of mission architecture and the layout of the mission
compound difficult.
To date, no Spanish Colonial
documents have been located that
provide maps or architectural descriptions of the mission at
41 VTlO. What is known about the
architecture of the site derives
from twentieth-century eyewitness

As stated above, much of what
is known about 41 VTlO derives
from the work done in the 1960s
by Jarratt, an avocational archeologist. Jarratt saw and studied the
ruins at 41VT10 (Tonkawa Bank)
in the early twentieth century before the site had been greatly impacted by numerous modifications
including bulldozing, "soil burrowing activities" conducted by
the previous landowner Doc Hiller
(Hindes et al. 1999: 80), the construction of baseball fields, a
playground, and buildings including a park maintenance shop and
Jaycee's Hall after the property became part of Victoria's City Park.

mission compound were still visible and identifiable.
Jarratt used first-hand recollections of the site to
help him uncover the archeological manifestations
at the site some 40 years later (Hindes et al. 1999).
In the 1960s, Jarratt excavated and mapped what
remained of the ruins after the City of Victoria
bulldozed about 2 ft off the top of the ridge where
the site is situated in 1958.
The earliest archival source providing architectural information about 41VT10 was in 1883 when
John Linn, who settled in Victoria in 1829, noted
(italics in original):
The Toncahuas ... had a church, which
was erected on what is now known as
"the Toncahua Bank," the foundation of
which is still visible, as it was built of
masonry (Linn 1883:333-334).
Jarratt (1966a:6) maintained that the standing
walls had been 3-ft (0.91 m) high as late as 1922.
He found a two-room stone building partially surrounded by stone walls on the north, east, and south,
as well as other foundations.
By 1965, the stone ruins extended about 15
cm (6 in) below the surface with only a trace of
foundations visible (Jarratt 1966b:7-9). The foundations of the "church" were "made of limestone or
sandstone rock and were two feet in width" (Jarratt
l 966b:7-9). Jarratt reported that a layer of yellow
sand had been placed in a prepared trench meant
for the building's foundations, which was then filled
with river gravel and rock and formed into a solid
mass. The stone ruins measured 12.19 m (40 ft) on
the north side, 12.80 m (42 ft) on the south side and
7.62 m (25 ft) in width. The west end on the south
side had an extension of 2 ft. The main door was in
the west elevation. The building was divided into
two rooms by a partition wall also two ft in width
with a fireplace in the front room. Buttresses were
noted at each corner (Jarratt 1966b:7-9).
The layer of sand was ca. 7.5 cm (3 inches) in
depth and placed directly on the clay subsoil (Jarratt
l 966c:6). Once these foundations reached what
Jarratt (l 966c:6) considered the original ground surface, the sandstone walls began with "some gravel
being used as filling, with the exception of the
comers and where the buttress(es) were located."
The floor was made of a limestone-caliche while
the walls were plastered (Jarratt 1966a:6).
Jarratt also found "the outline traces of other
old foundations" near where he encountered three
burials (Jarratt 1966c:5). Additionally, he found

evidence of a third room attached to the southeast
corner of the two-room structure. He believed this
third room may have served as a kitchen because
Indian pottery, majolica, burned rocks, fragments of
an old iron pot, animal bones, and shells were found
there (Jarratt l 966c:7). To the west of the two-room
structure he found a trace of a rock wall with a lot of
"burned clay and sand, fragments of baked clay,
charcoal. .. Indian pottery ... and some pottery that
had been glazed ... clam and mussel, shell, and flint
chipping" (Jarratt 1966c:8). Mr. Des Hiller, who as
a boy played around the old foundations in the early
1900s, stated that:
the large door to the building [here, Hiller
is referring to the trace of the rock wall
west of the two-room strncture] faced
west or toward the river. . . /and the
walls/ ... were about 5 feet high in places,
and had a lot of Windows or what could
of been windows, they were very small
and looked more like slots left in the wall
for some reason (Jarratt l 966c:6-7).
These openings may possibly have been troneras
(gun ports) commonly found in early structures on
sides of the doors and windows for defensive purposes (Graham 1994:26). Because of the threat of
Indian attack, the earliest structures had few, if any,
windows (Juarez 1976:21).
In 1997 and 1998, the TAS field school investigations confirmed many of Jarratt' s original observations. In 1997, the ruins at site 41 VTlO were
completely covered with topsoil and overgrown with
grass, so that only an occasional stone could be
seen. The following discussion briefly describes
the architectural features encountered during the
fieldwork and how these features relate or do not
relate to the findings of Jarratt' s 1960s excavations.
More importantly, an attempt is made to assess,
through the archeological data, the accuracy of Tom
Jones's mission reconstruction drawing (see Figure
1) in relationship to the mission compound.
Five key areas of the mission compound were
exposed during Jarratt' s excavations at 41VTl0. In
returning to the site, we sought to verify the overall
layout of the features and structures at this second
location of the mission. Thus, we targeted the same
five key areas for investigation. The areas are
designated A to Eon the site plan map (Figure 4),
and a discussion of each area is presented below.
Given that our time was limited, we excavated
backhoe trenches to expeditiously expose a

maximum area. A number of backhoe trenches
(BHTs) were excavated in each area, and many
backhoe trenches revealed evidence of architectural
features that provide clues to the layout of the
mission. Cultural features and BHTs that yielded
data concerning the mission architecture are
discussed below for each site area.
Area A
Area A is located in the northwest part of the
site. Investigations in Area A (see Figure 4) included
the excavation of five backhoe trenches (BHTs 1, 4,
5, 13, and 21). The trenches yielded evidence of a
possible compound stockade enclosure and an
associated jacal structure. Evidence for a stockade
fence that may have enclosed the mission compound
is represented by a series of postholes located in
Trenches 1, 5, and 13 (see Figure 4). In all, 12
postholes were encountered in Area A. The distance

between most of the postholes is approximately 9.5
ft (2.9 m), suggesting that large posts were placed at
this distance with smaller posts filling the spaces
between the larger uprights. A similar pattern of
large and small posts interspersed was noted at
Presidio San Saba (see Walter et al., this volume).
Evidence of the smaller posts would have been
destroyed by bulldozing with only the deeper set
and larger posts leaving any visible remains.
Theoretically, other construction methods for walls
or fences could have been used at the site, however
further excavations are needed to investigate this
possibility. Also of interest is the distance noted
between Postholes 15 and 16 as well as between
Postholes 14 and 15. Because these posts are more
widely spaced than the others (6 meters apart versus
2.75-3 meters for the other posts), they may indicate
the presence of a compound gate in this location.
This is conjectural and is based on limited
information but the distance between these posts is

uncommon for burials to be placed underneath the
floors of churches in Spanish Colonial sites (Hann
and McEwan 1998; Saunders 1993; Tunnell and
Newcomb 1969), so this hypothesis should not be
ruled out. Churches were typically among the first
buildings to be erected at the missions. Occasionally,
less substantial structures were initially built to meet
the immediate needs of the mission only to later be
replaced by larger and typically more-permanent
structures. Markedly, the width of the Feature 15

found in BHTs 7 and 8, as well as an undefined
alignment in BHT 12. The features consist of what
appear to be a series of cobble and rubble wall alignments along with three Spanish Colonial burials.
Feature 15 (Figure 11), in
BHT 7, is a cobble and gravel
alignment that may represent the
footing of an east-west stone wall.
The feature measures 27 .5 inches
(69.8 cm) wide or approximately
0.75 varas. It consists of small to
medium-sized limestone cobbles
and gravels, mortar or plaster
fragments, and some shell. Based
on the location of the burials found
south of the alignment, Feature 15
may represent the remains of a
stone wall placed around a cemetery as noted by Jarratt. Another
possibility is that Area D may be

that Feature 15 represents an early, less substantial,
mission built at site 41VTl0.
Feature 18 (see Figure 4) was also encountered
in BHT 7 and appears to be associated with the
Feature 15 alignment. The feature consists of a
possible wall foundation alignment that was identified in the trench and subsequent hand excavations.
The alignment trends east to west and a second
alignment/wall was encountered that runs northwest at approximately a 45 degree angle. The eastwest alignment is 84 cm (33.3 inches) wide and
contained large stones, gravel, cobbles, mortar and
a small concentration of oyster shells. The width of
this wall, at approximately one vara, is the same
width as the footings documented in the two-room
structure (the church), again supporting the possibility that this area may represent the remains of an
early chapel with burials underneath. Additionally,
two very large limestone cobbles were located in
BHT 14 (see Figure 4) to the west of Feature 18,
and may represent a continuation of the wall to the

wide, contained cobbles, a large mortar fragment,

expanded to the northwest in order to intersect
BHT 16 and to better define the extent of the

was associated with construction of the parking
lot to the east. Feature 17 was in the trench and is
comprised of an alignment of small cobbles and
gravels (Figure 13).
Trench 12 was opened to the east of BHT 7 in
order to determine whether or not the rubble wall
alignment extended to the east. What appeared to be

The presence of several probable wall sections
in Area D remains problematic. They may represent an earlier and independent building construction, a later construction or addition, a later reconstruction episode, part of a transept wall, or a semicircular apse within a possible chapel. Additional
investigations are needed to address the function of
this area. Without further excavations to define the
exact dimensions and layout of the walls, it is impossible to determine whether or not the footings
are supporting a cemetery wall or the walls of an
early church or chapel. If Area D does represent a
church or chapel structure, however, it is likely that
it was in use before the larger church was built and
that the two were not used as churches simultaneously.
Three burials (in a cluster designated as Feature 16) were found in BHT 7 (see Figure 4), and
all were extended and oriented east to west. Notably, Jarratt also found burials in the general
area in 1965. According to Jarratt (1966b:3), three
burials were approximately 18.3 m (60 ft) south of
the stone ruins or 11 m (36 ft) southeast from the
old foundation wall (Jarratt 1966c:5). Trench 7 was
placed about 11 m from the southeast corner of the
stone ruins confirming the presence of burials or a
cemetery in this area. Additional archeological testing of the site, however, is needed to answer two
important questions. First, are additional burials
present at the site and, if so, are they confined to
this specific area? And second, does Area D represent a walled cemetery or possibly a church that
contained interior burials?
AreaE
Area E includes the southern limits of the
mission site (see Figure 4). Given the distance of
Area E from the mission ruins, it is believed that
this area is outside the confines of the mission
compound. Trench 3, a 40-m-long (131.2 ft) trench
was excavated in Area E but did not reveal any
intact deposits. However, a number of Spanish
Colonial artifacts including lead glazed wares and
majolica, as well as daub and bone, were retrieved
from the back dirt. Artifacts including ceramics,
bones, shells, daub, and lithics found during the
excavations and in the backdirt may indicate that
jacal-type living quarters for the mission Indian
population were placed outside the compound walls.
To date, testing in this area has not provided
evidence of the southern compound wall, whether

stone or wooden stockade. Based on the presence
and types of the artifacts found in all prior testing
phases, and the concentration of the artifacts found
in BHT 3, the evidence seems to support the
hypothesis that Area E was an exterior residential
area where mission Indians lived. An alternate, but
less likely, hypothesis is that the materials found in
BHT 3 represent an accumulation of trash along a
southern stockade wall (just inside, outside, or both),
but the direct evidence of the wall has not yet been
found. If this were the case, the mission compound
was quite large, measuring at least 65 m (213 ft)
from north to south.

COMPARING AND CONTRASTING:
ARCHEOLOGICAL DATA AND THE
RECONSTRUCTION SKETCHES
The sketch of the mission at 41VT10 by Jones
(see Figure 1) does share some similarities with
Jarratt's drawings (see Figures 2 and 3) and the
archeological data; however, there are some major
discrepancies. Compound components sketched by
Jones that appear to be supported by the archeological and twentieth-century informants and documents include the church with buttresses and small
windows (or troneras), a palisade wall, and the
placement of burials in the southeastern corner of
the mission complex. Sections of stone walls along
the southern and eastern edge of the compound and
a possible wooden palisade wall along the northern
section of the mission were uncovered during excavations. Jones's sketch, however, shows only stone
walls as opposed to a wooden palisade along the
northern edge.
The southern wall and most of the western wall
are depicted as a wooden palisade. Investigations
to the south and west of the mission ruins during
the TAS field schools were limited. As a result, the
configuration, layout, and construction style of the
western and southern walls of the mission
compound are not known. Sections of a stone
footing were noted to the south of burials in Area
D. The footings run east to west and represent
either the south wall of an enclosed cemetery or
perhaps evidence of an earlier church structure.
Possibly, this east-west wall may form part of the
southern wall of the mission compound. Additional
excavations are needed, however, in order to
support this theory as evidence for posts or other
wall foundations that might be encountered farther

Walter, Hindes, and Boyd-Spanish Mission Architecture

south of the cemetery/possible church wall would
indicate that the area was enclosed within a larger
mission complex and did not form part of the
exterior wall. Nonetheless, both Jarratt and Jones
interpret the burial area as an enclosed camposanto
with its southern wall forming part of the
compound's outer south wall.
Other notable discrepancies between Jones' s
drawing and the archeological data are the placement and dimensions of the church. The sketch
places the front of the mission church flush with
the western palisade wall. This placement of the
structure is purely conjectural and seems unlikely.
Given the defensive nature of these frontier outposts, having easy access to the inside of the compound via the mission church would not have been
prudent. Indeed, most Spanish missions in Texas
were built so that access from the outside was limited. Mission churches were typically surrounded
by walls or their entrances faced the interior of the
plaza with no direct access from outside of the
compound. Interestingly, Jarratt's 1965 reconstruction sketch of the mission shows the church structure to be set back several feet from the western
wall (see Figure 2). This is quite different from
Jones' s reconstruction and probably is a more-accurate depiction of the layout of the mission. Furthermore, if the postholes found in Area A are
indeed pait of the northern wall, they indicate that
the wall extended more than 25 m (82 ft) west of
the ruins. The size of the mission church is also in
question. The horizontal dimensions of the church
appear accurate in Jones's drawing, but the vertical
dimensions seem slightly exaggerated. Using a conservative estimate that the human figures are approximately 1.5 m (5 ft) tall, this would make the
height of the building at least 4.5 m (15 ft) if not
taller. Nevertheless, it should be noted that the friars' quarters at site 41VTl1 may have been as high
as 4 m (13 ft).
Another inaccuracy in the drawing by Jones
may be the homo feature illustrated to the west of
the church entrance. Jarratt first noted the feature
during his 1965 excavations at the site and tentatively interpreted it as an oven. The oven is shown
on Jones's sketch, in association with a thatched
roof structure, to the southwest of the northern wall
in a location that does not match up with Jarratt' s
findings. Furthermore, no direct evidence for an
oven was uncovered during the excavations, but
the presence of large amounts of burned daub does
suggest the presence of ajacal-like structure.

IS

Evidence for a jacal structure, as described by
Jarratt, was found along the northern wall during the
most-recent excavations. This feature may form part
of a series of buildings along the northern wall of the
complex that is depicted in both reconstruction
sketches by Jarratt and Jones. One notable difference
is that Jmntt shows an outline of rock foundations
along the north wall on his 1965 map (see Figure 2),
while Jones depicts a long, thatched roof that may
represent contiguousjacales (see Figure 1).
In his sketch, Jones also depicts two entrances
in the western palisade wall. Unfortunately, the area
to the west of the mission ruins has not been thoroughly explored, therefore the presence and locations of gates in the west wall cannot be confirmed
archeologically. Nonetheless, evidence for a possible gate, admittedly tenuous, was noted along the
proposed northern wall in Area A. While the distance between postholes suggests that a gate may
have present in the northern wall, more substantial
evidence is needed in order to confirm its presence.
Absolutely no archeological evidence has
been found to suggest that a gun platform was in
the northeast corner of the compound (see Figure
1) or that raised guard towers were present in any
of the compound's corners (see Figures I and 3).
Jones' s depiction of these elements is purely
speculative. There is no indication that Jarratt
obtained any archeological evidence that would
support interpretations of a gun platform or guard
towers, and no such evidence was found during
the more-recent investigations (see Hindes et al.
1999; Boyd 2004).
In summary, site 41 VTIO contains the remains
of stone ruins and other features dating to the
Spanish Colonial period. Although a tremendous
amount of modification has taken place over the
site within the last 40 years, the fact that wall
footings, postholes, and other features could be
located during the TAS investigations suggests that
there are probably more structural remains present
even where topsoil removal was most severe. The
dimensions of the compound are unknown. The
west and south walls have not been defined and
other mission components, such as additional
structures and related features, may be revealed
through more-intensive investigations. What can
be said with certainty, however, is that the mission
complex included a two-room structure that appears
to represent the church, both stone and wooden
walls were constructed at the site, jacal-like
structures were present, and a concentration of

burials was located to the southeast of the main
stone ruins. Additional targeted archeological
investigations, starting with remote sensing and
followed by targeted testing of remote sensing
anomalies, are crucial for obtaining a better
understanding of the true layout of the mission
compound at site 41VT10.

MISSION LAYOUT AND
ARCHITECTURE AT 41VT11
The third location of Espiritu Santo, site 41VTl1,
is located in Mission Valley, Texas in Victoria
County and was established in 1726. Prior to the
investigations conducted by the University of Texas
and the Texas Archeological Society, little formal
work was completed at the site although the site had
been subjected to extensive looting. In 1936 an historical marker was erected in order to commemorate
the site. During the 1960's and 1970's avocational
archeologists visited the site to survey and record the
standing ruins (Walter 1997). In the spring of 1995
the Office of the State Archeologist (OSA) conducted limited testing at the site to evaluate its potential for future research. Prompted by their findings, the University of Texas Field School began
excavations at the mission in the summer of 1995.
The most extensive work at the site, however, was
completed when the TAS held two field schools at
the site in 1997 and 1998 (Walter 2000).
Like site 41VTl0 and other Spanish missions,
the third location of Espiritu Santo was built on an
elevated spot, a high knoll, within a short distance
from necessary resources such as water, building
stone, wood, and land for cultivating. Site 41VT1 l
is situated less than a kilometer from the east bank
of the Guadalupe River. In a letter to the Viceroy of
New Spain, Governor Almazan (1726) describes
the new site of the mission as follows:
it has the advantage of being on higher
ground, away from the lagoons and
swamps, has sweet soft water, an abundance of timber for all construction and
at a distance of two leagues, an abundance of good rock for building and there
is the hope of being able to find a quarry
much nearer. .. another creek (west side)
at a distance of three leagues having an
abundance of water and with sufficient
land for an ample mission, and to cultivate for the needs of the Presidio.

The availability of both land and water for raising
livestock and crops was another important criteria
for selecting a mission site (Fox 1991).
To date no references to the layout or general
construction of the third location of Mission Espiritu
Santo have been found in the archival records. What
we know about the architecture and mission's
organization has come almost entirely from the
archeological and architectural research conducted
at the site in the 1990s (Walter 2000). Based on
these recent archeological and architectural
investigations, a total of five stone structures have
been identified at the site as shown in Figure 13.
The buildings include a church (Structure B), the
friars' quarters (Structure A), an open-air chapel
(Structure C), a kitchen or refectory (Structure E),
and a building of unknown function (Structure D).
The recovery of daub from the interior of the
mission compound suggests that jacal-like
structures were also a part of the mission layout
and were probably used for housing mission Indians.
All of the mission components are addressed in the
following discussion.

Structure A
The most intensive architectural investigations
at the mission were carried out in Structure A by
Spanish Colonial architect Jack Eaton (Walter
1997). The following description is a summary of
his findings and the archeological research conducted in the building. Structure A is a free-standing,
one-room building directly south of Structure B
(see Figure 13). The remains of the entire building
(Figure 14) were exposed during the 1997 T AS
excavations, allowing a thorough inspection of the
structural foundation. The walls are of rubble
sandstone construction and may have reached a
height of 4 m (13 ft). The tall, sturdy walls would
have allowed a high ceiling and support for a roof.
Footing trenches for the wall foundations were
exposed during the excavations. The trenches were
excavated 50 cm (19.7 inches) deep into the ground
surface. The footing wall and the above-ground
walls were then built using the same construction
style and are of equal width.
Today the standing ruins measure 80-90 cm
(31.5-35.4 inches) high from the bottom of the
footings (Eaton 1998:25). The dimensions of the
building are 5.40x7.47 m (17.7x24.5 ft) on the
outside, while the interior measures 3.75x5.85 m
(12.3xl9.2 ft). Evidence for plaster was observed

are plastered and painted red (Figure 16). The doorway measures 87
cm (34.2 inches) wide at its opening and splays to a width of 1.6 m
(5.25 ft) toward the interior of the
structure. Splayed doorways allowed doors to be opened wide to
the interior, which was necessary
for a structure with thick walls.
The door could then be bolted
from the inside (Eaton 1998:28).
Although the remaining wall ruins
are too low to indicate the presence of windows, splayed windows were likely to have been
present in one or more of the walls.

(Haggard 1941).
Parts of an intact, interior floor were also uncovered approximately 55 cm (21.7 inches) below
the height of the remaining walls (Figure 15). The

interprets the structure as a residence or office for
the missionaries. The thick walls, secure doorway,
and the house shrine underscore the sturdy nature
of the structure and its use as a personal space.

Figure 16. Painted and plastered domjambs in Structure
A at site 41VT11.

Structure B, located north of Structure A, is a
long linear building (Figure 19) made out of sandstone with three separate rooms (see Figure 13:B 1,
B2, and B3) that may at one time have served as
storage rooms, a granary, or a church. The sturdiness of this building certainly indicates that it was
meant to last and a great deal of effort went into
its construction. Constructing well-built churches
and granaries would have been a priority for the
missionaries. The church, of course, was the most
important building at the mission, while the granary was needed to store food and, therefore, had
to be sturdy and impenetrable to both rodents and
the elements. The entire structure measures just
over 19 m long (62.3 ft) and is more than 6 m
wide (19.7 ft). The walls of the structure range in
thickness from 70-75 cm (27.6-29.5 inches). Although today plaster is only visible in small patches
on the standing walls of Room B 1, most of Structure B's interior was probably covered with plaster especially inside the church. Like the friars'
quarters (Structure A), the interior plaster was
probably painted. Unfortunately the plaster remnants on the walls of Structure B have retained

cm (29.5 inches) from the wall. The niche/shrine
probably held either a cross, crucifix, or statue of
some kind. The altar consists of a smaller, lower
step used for kneeling and an
upper step where a statue or cross
was placed. The steps are constructed of cut and dressed limestone. Limestone is not found in
the immediate area and was probably imported or procured from
another location. The altar is plastered but not painted, although redpainted plaster is noted on the altar where the wall and altar join
(Figure 21). The remains of the
altar measure 57 cm (22.4 inches)
high, 85 cm (33.5 inches) wide,
and extend out 62 cm (24.4 inches)
from the base of the wall.

of Structure B is approximately
30 cm (11.8 inches) below the
modern ground surface. The footings offset the wall by 10 cm (3.9
inches) (John Garner, personal

The above-ground walls of B 1
that are still standing today were
built using lime mortar. This suggests that the foundation of Structure B was laid down first and that
Rooms B2 and B3 were built prior
to the construction of Room B 1.
All of the Structure B walls are of

Structure C
The layout and configuration
of Structure C (see Figure 13),
which adjoins Structure B along its
northern wall, lends additional
support to the theory that Structure
B was used as a church. Structure
C is a long, rectangular building
with a semicircular shape along its
northern end (Figure 21). The
exterior dimensions of Structure C
are 6.lx9.3 m (20.0x30.5 ft), and
its interior measures 4.6x8.0 m

In addition to extensive
looting, a large anaqua tree has
grown up through the center of
the building. As a result, only
limited investigations were carried
out within Structure D. However,
enough of the structure was
exposed to allow the exterior
dimensions of this one-room
building to be estimated as approximately 8.0x6.5 m (26.2x21.3 ft).

Located to the northeast of Structure C is Structure D (see Figure 13). The long axis of Structure D
is oriented east-west and forms the northwest corner of the mission compound. A doorway is present
in the northwest corner of the building (Figure 23).
The entryway is not splayed and its threshold was
uncovered at 46 cm (18.1 inches) below the modern surface. Red painted plaster was observed on
the interior northern wall near the doorjamb. The
doorway was probably meant to allow access only
from inside this building to the outside of the compound rather than serving as a main entrance into

10 m (32.8 ft) of stone materials
have been removed from the
quarry, and scars on the rock faces
indicate that iron tools were most
likely used to remove sandstone
blocks (Jones 1998).
In addition to building stone,
materials for making lime mortar
were also readily available.
Caliche deposits are abundant at
the site, and this material can be
used as clean fill in construction
of flooring and can provide lime
for plaster and mortar. Both lime
and earthen mortar were identified
archeologically, and the discovery
of a lime kiln at the site confirmed

was being reduced to make lime.

mission's existence were much more stable and
allowed the Franciscans to support a larger population (Walter 2000). Plans to build more permanent
stone housing for the neophytes may have been in
the works before they were forced to move the
mission to the San Antonio River in 1749. Prior to
the move, however, it appears that the mission
Indians primarily camped outside the mission complex. It is also plausible that jacal housing may have
been provided inside the mission compound for some
of the more trusted or Christianized Indians, but
evidence for such structures has yet to be found.
While daub was found inside and outside the
mission compound, no clear patterns of jacal
structures were identified in the atcheological
investigations. Nevertheless, jacal structures were
being used at the mission for housing residents
such as the presidial soldiers who were stationed
there (Oberste n.d.). Excavations to the east of the
mission structures yielded evidence for the presence
of a presidio soldier and his wife and perhaps a
family. Large quantities of daub, square nails, and
household items indicate that a structure once stood
in this area. Spanish military and horse-related
equipment was also found in abundance, supporting
the theory that this area was occupied by at least
one presidio soldier.

E has a similar foundation, although excavations
were not extensive enough to expose them.
Conversely, the apse-shaped Structure C was built
directly on the surface with no entrenched
foundation footing. The foundations exposed in
mission buildings A, B, and D were constructed of
sandstone rubble and range in depth from 40 to 90
cm (15.7-35.4 inches) below the modern ground
surface. In general, the foundation footings are
slightly wider than the upper walls they support.
Both earth and lime mortar were also used in the
construction of the foundations.
Evidence for painted plaster was noted on several
of the buildings including A, B, and D. Not surprisingly, most of the plaster was found on the interior
walls. Small amounts of plaster were observed on
the exterior walls of Structure A, and it is likely that
most of the buildings also had plastered outer walls.
Exposure to the elements has undoubtedly disintegrated any exterior plaster that may have once been
present on many of the buildings.
Other than Structure A, no physical evidence
of roofing was found at the site. Given the remote
location of the mission and the abundance of available wood, the buildings were probably covered
with timber and mortar roofs. Although evidence
for intact floors was difficult to detect, exposed
floor remnants are best described as packed caliche
and earth.

SUMMARY OF ARCHITECTURAL
ELEMENTS AT SITE 41VT11
All the stone structures at the mission are constructed from sandstone quarried from a nearby
source. Both earth and lime mortars were used in
the buildings. Locally abundant caliche provided a
good source of lime and was also used in the flooring of several of the buildings. Construction styles
varied slightly between some buildings, but all of
the structures had rubble masonry walls and foundations. Nevertheless, the stones used in some of
the buildings were more-carefully selected and
more-uniformly placed, as noted in Structures A,
B, and D. Both Structures C and E appear to have
been erected quickly and with much less attention
paid to the alignment of the buildings and the integrity of the walls. The only cut stones observed were
used in the construction of the altar found in Structure A. The altar also was the only architectural
element made of non-local limestone.
Footings were exposed in all of the buildings
except for Structures C and E. Presumably Structure

COMPARISON OF MISSION
LAYOUT AND ARCHITECTURE AT
SITES 41VT10 AND 41VT11
Currently what we know about site 41 VTIO is
limited. Excavations have largely concentrated on
the northern and eastern sections of the site. The
reconstruction sketches produced by Jarratt and
Jones, while helpful in some ways, are flawed by a
number of inaccuracies. It appears that Jarratt's
reconstruction sketch from 1965 (see Figure 2) is
the most precise, but many of its details cannot be
corroborated by the archeological evidence. The
exact layout of the mission is not known, and we
have almost no details pertaining to above-ground
wall construction techniques since only subsurface
foundation footings have survived.
Comparisons between the reconstruction
sketches and the archeological data show both
consistencies and inconsistencies. Evidence for
both stone walls and wooden palisade construction

Walter, Hindes, and Boyd-Spanish Mission Architecture 25
was noted archeologically and in the sketches.
Jones's sketch depicts both types of construction,
but the size of the compound and locations of the
actual compound walls are still not known. The
location of the burials, first noted by Jarratt, was
verified by the recent archeological investigations,
and both Jones and Jarratt depict the burials as
being enclosed in a walled cemetery. The recently
uncovered stone foundations located north and
south of the burial area (i.e., Features 15 and 18 in
Area D; see Figure 4) could represent portions of
the cemetery wall, but they could also represent
foundations of an earlier church or chapel.
Evidence ofjacal-type structures was observed by
Jarratt, and this concept was incorporated into
Jones' s reconstruction drawing. Recent archeological investigations also indicate the presence
of possible jacal structures, although the archeological location (Feature 1 in Area A; see Figure
4) does not match the location of the thatched
roofed structures (along the east wall and outside
the compound near the homo) depicted in Jones' s
reconstruction sketch or the location of the "Indian
huts" in the plaza east of the church in Jarratt's
1965 drawing.
Based on the current data, architectural comparisons between site 41 VTlO at Tonkawa Bank
and site 41VTI1 in Mission Valley reveal the two
sites are similar in very general ways. Both have
the common components that one would expect to
find at most Spanish Colonial missions in Texas.
Both have stone structures that appear to be
churches, possibly with attached kitchens. Evidence for plastered walls and hard-packed caliche
flooring also was noted at both sites. Site 41VTl1
had two church locations representing an initial,
more ephemeral building that was later replaced
with a larger, sturdier structure. This may have
been the case at site 41VT10, but the evidence is
not definitive. Burials were found at both of the
missions, although the site 41VT11 burials postdated the Spanish occupation of the mission. The
presence of these burials inside what is believed to
be the church at site 41VTl1 is nonetheless important since it suggests that later residents of the area
were familiar with the practice of burying the dead
under the church floor and that they recognized the
structure as a church. Originally the church at Mission Valley consisted of two rooms (B2 and B3)
and only later was a third room added. Interestingly
the original two-room structure is very close to the
same size as the two-room structure at Tonkawa

Bank. Comparing the exterior dimensions, the site
41VT10 building measures 7.6x12.2 m (25x40 ft)
while the site 41 VTll building is roughly 6.3x13.0
m (2lx43 ft). The orientation of the two buildings
is much different, however. The Mission Valley
church is oriented north-south while the church at
Tonkawa Bank is oriented east-west. If Jarratt's
1965 sketch of the mission buildings is correct, the
L-shaped layout of the structures formed by the
church and the possible kitchen is somewhat similar to the overall L-shape pattern of the structures at
Mission Valley.
At both sites, one vara appears to be the standard width for the mission walls, and sandstone and
lime mortar and plaster were the primary building
materials. Unlike site 41VTI1, site 41 VTIO has no
above-ground ruins so direct archeological evidence
of wall construction is lacking. Construction styles
were probably similar, as noted by local Victoria
resident Herman Fishbeck who viewed both sites
in the mid-twentieth century. Evidence for jacal
structures is present at the mission sites, both inside and outside the compounds. Inside jacales
were probably used as storerooms, temporary housing, and workshops, while jacales located outside
the compound walls were probably houses for mission Indians.
The exact dimensions of the mission compounds are not known for either site 41 VTlO or site
41VT11, so no overall size comparison can be made.
Based on the existing data, however, we know that
the site 41VTl0 mission compound is at least 32x50
m (105x164 ft) and the site 41VT11 compound is
at least 50x53 m (164x174 ft). No evidence for a
compound wall has yet to be found at site 41VT11,
but the configuration of buildings suggests that the
Spaniards were trying to layout out the mission
complex in a square or rectangular shape. The doors
and windows that could be identified at site 41VTI1
all led to the interior of the mission plaza with the
exception of one door that probably opened outward to the exterior of the compound. If the compound wall was a wooden palisade then it is possible that little if any of the walls remain. Defense
was a primary concern so a surrounding wall would
have been a necessity.

CONCLUSIONS
The archeology at both site 41VTIO and site
41VTl1 has been critical for assessing the

26

organization and architectural methods employed
at each site. Although some similarities exist
between the two missions, the limited nature of the
architectural remains at the second location prohibits
more detailed comparisons. Both sites appear to
share common Spanish mission components seen
across the northern frontier of Texas including a
church, jacal living structures/storerooms, hardpacked earthen floors, and the arrangement of
buildings around an interior plaza. Additional
excavations at site 41VTl1 are currently underway
and a primary objective of these investigations is to
delineate additional ruins including temporary
housing for presidio soldiers and evidence of a
palisade wall. Present architectural data from site
41 VTlO is sparse and future investigations are
needed, however, to better define the architectural
ruins at the site.

ABSTRACT
Archeological excavations at the Spanish Colonial presidia of San Saba have focused on exposing original
architecture and recovering material remains from within the fort. A major goal of this research is the delineation
of the presidia ruins. Ultimately, the archaeological work completed here will contribute to a faithful
reconstruction of the site, therefore understanding the layout of the fort and identifying original portions of the
presidia is critical. Through both archaeological and historical research, the architecture of the fort is slowly
revealing itself. The data that has been recovered is providing a picture of how a typical Spanish frontier fort was
constructed and laid out. The following discussion details the architectural elements and layout of the presidia
in hopes of providing a basis for which other presidios can be compared.

INTRODUCTION
Current investigations at the site of Presidio
San Saba (41MN1) in Menard County, Texas represent some of the most extensive work completed
at a Spanish fort in Texas. Research at the site was
prompted by the local community's desire to reconstruct the fort to its former appearance. Consequently, a primary objective of both the archeological and archival research is the definition of the
layout, construction style, and architectural history
of the presidio. Large-scale excavations were carried out at the fort in 2003 and 2004 by the Texas
Archeological Society. In addition, Texas Tech University has held summer field schools at the site
since 2000. These investigations have concentrated
on exposing original construction of the fort and
evidence for daily activities within the compound.
Although work is on-going, the information gathered thus far is revealing important evidence about
the fort's arrangement, its construction, and changes
that were made to the fortress over time. Information about the location of the original wooden palisade is coming to light as well.
Ideally, the research that is completed at Presidio
San Saba will serve as a basis of comparison for other
Spanish presidios in Texas and add to our existing
knowledge about military installations across the
nmthem frontier of New Spain. The following discussion provides an overview of presidio architecture

in New Spain, the history of San Saba, a review of
the historical accounts pertaining to the site, and a
summary of the architectural findings yielded during
the archeological excavations.

PRESIDIO ARCHITECTURE IN
NORTHERN NEW SPAIN
The presidia was much more than
adobe walls in a wilderness; its historical
importance lay of course, in the fact that it
was a handful of humans (with or without
fort) whose frontier emplacement manifested civilization's determination to stay
in this difficult land (Powell 1982: 140).

Spanish presidios have only recently received
attention in mainstream historical archaeology
(Bense 2004). Presidios were found across northern New Spain from the coast of California to
Florida. Spanish Texas alone had more than 10
presidios and 37 missions (Habig 1990). The word
"presidio" derives from the Latin praesidium, meaning a frontier garrison or outpost. The Romans had
such outposts in virtually all parts of their empire,
although interestingly, the term praesidium was
not not used in Spain. Fortifications in Spain
were known variously as castillos (little camps),
fortalezas (fortresses), and fuertes (strong holds)

(Moorhead 1975; Naylor and Polzer 1986; Williams 2004). It was not until after the Reconquista
(the reconquest of Spain from the Moors in 1492)
was complete that the term, "presidia" came into
use in Spain, describing frontier garrisons in Morocco and early military outposts in sixteenth century northern Mexico (Naylor and Polzer 1986;
Powell 1982).
As a colonial institution of Northern New Spain,
the earliest use of the word presidia began during
the Chichimeca War of 1550 to 1590. When silver
was discovered in the Zacatecas region of North
Central Mexico along the Chichimeca frontier in
1546, miners and prospectors from all over Mexico
flocked to the area. As a result, the miners and
prospectors encroached on Chichimeca lands and
eventually a war began. In an effort to protect themselves from attack along the roads to Zacatecan
mines, workers built fortified houses along the
routes called casafuertes (fortified houses) (Naylor
and Polzer 1986; Powell 1982). Many of these early
presidios employed architectural features that continued to be used on Spanish forts throughout northern New Spain for the next 200 years. Basic components of these fortifications included "four walls
enclosing an interior quadrangle with bastions or
battlements at two or more corners," allowing for
"living quarters for the occupants, storage and repair areas, stables, offices, chapel, and an exercise
and parade grounds-all protected within the perimeter of buildings and walls" (Naylor and Polzer
1986:36). The establishment of presidios spread
northward as New. Spain's frontier advanced,
stretching from California in the west to La Florida
in the east. Presidio architecture varied widely, however, and each presidial captain was given the freedom to choose the location and layout of his presidia
(Williams 2004). Nevertheless, there were basically
three distinct architectural types of presidios:
coastal, urban, and interior. Coastal or maritime
presidios were typically more heavily fortified than
interior presidios. Many of the California and
Florida presidios represent examples of coastal forts.
The forts were constructed as either square, diamond, or star-shaped structures with the most
heavily fortified sides facing the coast to protect
from sea attacks (Childers 2004; Early 2004). In
Texas, the Presidio La Bahfa at its original location
at Matagorda Bay is an example of a coastal fort.
Built in 1722 it featured an elaborate star-shaped
design. The fort was oriented to magnetic north and
consisted of a 16 pointed star-shaped wooden pali-

sade wall and several jacal structures (Bruseth et
al. 2004).
Urban presidios were found at the heart of Spanish settlements in northern New Spain. Established
within the vicinity of Spanish towns or communities, these garrisons were usually unfortified and
formed a plaza surrounded by captain's quarters,
barracks, arsenals, and storehouses. A chapel was
typically present either among the presidia buildings or within the immediate vicinity (Moorhead
1975; Early 2004). In Texas, San Antonio de Bejar
represents an urban style presidio. Founded in 1719,
Presidio San Antonio was one of the most important presidios in Texas. It protected the five missions in San Antonio and would eventually serve as
the provincial capital in 1770 (Ivey 2004; Poyo and
Hinojosa 1991).
Interior presidios were much less elaborate than
their coastal counterparts. Coastal presidios were
designed to defend against European land and naval forces. Interior presidios defended against a
new and different enemy: the Native Americans
(Barteet 2000; Moorhead 1975; Williams 2004).
Initially, these presidios were not built within Spanish towns although sometimes towns later grew up
around them. The interior forts were frequently
made of adobe but could also be constructed of
wood, jacal, or stone. The basic shape was similar
to the presidios found along the Chichimeca frontier comprising a square or rectangular shape with
bastions on opposing corners. Many, however, had
no fortifications and were simply an arrangement
of officers' quarters, barracks, store rooms, and a
chapel (Barteet 2000; Moorhead 1975; Williams
2004). Presidio San Saba is one of the many interior forts built on the Spanish frontier in Texas.
Notably, despite their locations, all of the forts included a chapel and captain's quarters.
As presidios increasingly receive more attention from archeologists, maps and descriptions of
Spanish forts created during the colonial era are
helping researchers understand the construction, layout, and use of presidios. Many of the maps and
descriptions of Spanish forts along the northern
frontier were generated during the Marquis de
Rubi's inspection tour of the military installations
of Northern New Spain. Nicolas Lafora, perhaps
the best-known Spanish engineer of the eighteenth
century, accompanied Ru bf and kept a diary of his
journey. Lafora recorded his observations and gave
detailed descriptions of 21 presidios that were visited during the inspection (Jackson and Foster 1995;

Walter, Wolf, and Kimbell-Spanish Colonial Presidio Architecture 31
Moorhead 1975; Williams 2004). However, Lafora
personally mapped the layout of only two presidios,
Guajoquilla and San Saba, and recommended that
each be abandoned (Fireman 1977; Lafora 1768;
Jackson and Foster 1995). Joseph Urrutia, a draftsman and cartographer who accompanied the inspection tour produced maps of all 21 presidios.
Urrutia was also trained as an engineer (Fireman
1977) and was responsible for completing the majority of the measuring and mapping of the sites.
Urrutia was a member of the Royal Regiment of
America and later went on to become Captain-General of the armies of Spain. Lafora' s maps were
probably based on Urrutia' s work (Jackson and Foster 1995; Jackson, 2005).
Following the Rubf expedition, King Charles
III issued the Reglamento of 1772, based in large
part on Rubf' s recommendations (Brinkerhoff and
Faulk 1965; Moorhead 1975; Williams 2004). The
Reglamento made sweeping changes in the locations and design of the frontier
presidios. In part it called for the
creation of a cordon of presidios
stretching from the Gulf of California to the Gulf of Mexico
(Brinkerhoff and Faulk 1965; Williams 2004). Only the presidia of
Santa Fe in present-day New
Mexico would be kept north of this
line. In Texas, Presidio de San Saba
would be abandoned and relocated
near the Rio Grande. The Reglamento also attempted to standardize presidia design. The effectiveness of these presidios has been
debated (Faulk 1969, 1971) but
their role in the settlement of Northern New Spain cannot be denied
(Williams 2004).

it was meant to protect were built along the San
Saba River (Figure 1). Mission San Saba was located on the opposite (south) bank of the river approximately four miles east of the fort (Hindes et
al. 1995). The mission was intended to be one of
several missions that the friars hoped to build for
the Apache. The destruction of the mission site in
March of 1758, some 13 months after it was established, however, put an end to plans to continue
missionary efforts in the area. The Comanche and
their allies carried out the attack in response to the
alliance that the Spanish had made with the Apache,
long-time enemies of the Comanche (see Wade
2003: 187 for a succinct discussion of the anger
caused by the Spanish/Apache alliance).
Despite the attack and closure of the mission,
the presidia remained in operation and continued to
serve as a military installation until 1770 when it
was abandoned (Weddle 1999). The original commander of the fort, Colonel Diego Ortiz de Parilla,

was later replaced by Captain Felipe de Rabago y
Teran in 1760. In an effort to strengthen the fortification, Rabago replaced the original wooden garrison with a stone fort that was completed in 1762.
Rabago maintained command of the presidia for
nine years until he was replaced by Don Manuel
Antonio de Ocain 1769.
Historical records concerning the presidia and
its architectural details are limited to military matters with little information about the civilian population. Based on historical accounts, estimates of its
population range from 300-400 residents (Weddle
1999) including soldiers as well as women and
children. Daily accounts of presidia life are not
available however the isolated location of the fort
along the outer reaches of the frontier and the surrounding hostile environment suggest that life was
not easy for the presidio population. Mule trains
loaded with supplies from San Antonio and N01ihern Mexico and bound for San Saba were frequently
cut off by raids carried out by local native populations. Soldier patrols were also subject to attacks
and the presidio's livestock were easy targets for
raiding. In addition, both malnutrition and the spread
of disease plagued the residents. Not surprisingly,
the garrison attempted to retreat several times to
the nearest Spanish settlement, Mission San
Lorenzo, some 70 miles south of San Saba (Tunnell
and Newcomb 1969). Each time the fort was abandoned, however, the soldiers were reprimanded and
ordered to return to their post.

Although officially closed in 1772 (Weddle
1999), the fort was actually deserted two years earlier. Nonetheless the site continued to be used by
different groups in the following years including
the Spanish, Native Americans, Mexicans, and Texans. Modifications to the presidio were invariably
made until its final demise in the late 19th century
when the newly founded town of Menardville (later
simplified to Menard) mined the site for building
stone. Understanding the architectural history of
the presidio has therefore been a major goal of the
current investigations at the site.

HISTORICAL ACCOUNTS OF
PRESIDIO SAN SABA'S
ARCHITECTURE AND LAYOUT

Information regarding the construction and
layout of the fort comes from both historical accounts
and more recently from the archaeological
investigations. Spanish and later Anglo descriptions
of the site provide a picture of the presidio as it
changed through time (see article by Wolf, this
volume). The following discussion outlines the
architectural history of the site based on historical
documents including first-hand accounts and maps
created of the site dming the Spanish Colonial era
and in later times.
In May of 1757, the original presidio was constructed of a wooden palisade and included numerous temporary buildings of jacaltype construction. The compound
and related structures were built
to accommodate 100 presidial soldiers and their families. In 1758,
300-400 people including 237
women and children were said to
be residing at the compound
(Weddle 1999:64 ). Documents
written immediately after the attack and destruction of the nearby
Mission San Saba describe the
presidia as a wooden stockade
with several interior wooden structures, or jacals, with roofs of straw
or thatch. No plans of the original
wooden fortress have been located
to date although the famous 1760's

Francisco Amangual on his 1808

geologist Frederick Roemer, while
visiting the ruins with Baron von
Meusebach, also described a large
bastion at the northwest corner and
the remains of towers at the three
other corners. Although no original walls are left standing today,

around the northwest bastion than the moat that
was depicted on both of the 1767 maps. The sketch
also illustrates several lines meant to represent foundations. The foundations do not correspond with
the Spanish foundations of the stone fort and may
actually reflect the use of the presidio as a cattle
pen and makeshift residence for the early Anglo
settlers of the 19th century.
In 1905, John Warren Hunter, the newspaper
editor for Menardville, printed a historical pamphlet
including the histories of the presidio and the
adjacent Mission San Saba (Hunter 1905). While
colorful, the histories were only slightly accurate
with a great deal of emphasis placed on the local
legends surrounding the mission and presidio.
Hunter included a plan of the presidio which also
shows four corner bastions, among other physical
descriptions. Sometime later, perhaps in the 1930s,
his grandson Warren Hunter, produced a painting
of the presidio showing large towers at each corner.
Hunter's rendering was clearly influenced by his
grandfather's discussion of the site. The painting

also shows a river-level entrance to the fabled
underground tunnel of local lore.
The general layout of the presidio is well
documented historically. Information regarding the
actual construction methods and techniques of the
fort, however, is lacking. Accounts of the presidio
made during the Spanish occupation of the site and
after it was abandoned provide only a few details
concerning the construction style. Nevertheless
these brief references do offer some insights into
the building methods used to erect the compound.
For example, Urrutia indicated on his map that the
presidio was constructed of small stones and mortar.
Later accounts of the fort's construction note that
many of the walls were joined together by earth but
mortar was observed on at least one of the main
buildings (Mueller 1935). Earth was also used to
build the two parapets near the river and Lafora's
account of the fort mentions that the northwest
bastion was earthen-filled.
The Spanish, German, and Anglo accounts of
the fort represent separate and distinct descriptions.

All of the later documentations of the compound
describe a much different presidio layout than what
was illustrated in 1767. Discrepancies in the descriptions of the fort can be attributed to a number
of factors including rebuilding and renovations to
the fort as well as deterioration of the ruins over
time. Changes may have been made to the existing
stone fort as early as 1769 after Oca officially assumed command of the garrison. Rubi's inspection
of the fort was not favorable and attempts may
have been made to reinforce the fort in response to
his criticisms. Certainly, the construction of new
bastions might have been incorporated into plans to
strengthen the compound. Additional changes or
renovations may have followed when the site was
re-occupied in 1790 by Colonel Juan de Ugalde
(Weddle 1999). Ugalde used the fort as a base
camp for forming his troops in alliance with the
Comanche to punish the Apache.
When the town of Menardville was established
in the late 1800' s, the pillaging of the site for building stone drastically reduced the wall construction,
and by 1895 the walls were below waist high. The

stone entryways of the main gate were in place as
the only apparent architectural landmarks. In 1937
the Texas Centennial Commission completed a reconstruction of the fort that focused on the northwest corner (Figure 7). The reconstruction collapsed
not long after it was built, however, due to poor
quality mmiar and inferior construction methods.
With the exception of the main gate, the reconstruction does not appear to be accurate although
there is limited evidence of what appears to be
Spanish walls at the base of some of the reconstructed walls. Door jambs from the original west
gate were still in place when the reconstruction
began, however the rebuilt northwest bastion and
inte1ior rooms of the northwest corner do not line
up with the original fort based on our excavations.
Excavations in the northwest corner have not exposed any foundations or footings in either the
nmihwest rooms or near the bastion although a
great deal of wall fall was uncovered. Unfortunately, the reconstruction and its subsequent collapse has destroyed or obscured much of the original architecture in this area. Archeological investigations have therefore concentrated on other portions of the site
with greater potential for intact architecture.

rooms could have lined the perimeter walls thus confirming the
observations made by Roemer.

more surprisingly the remains of
several intact posts (Figure 18).
Three meters of trench were uncovered revealing at least four
well-preserved posts. The trench
measured 25-30 cm wide and 7080 cm deep (Figure 19). The trench
narrowed at the bottom and was
filled with sandy loam that was
easily removed. The wooden posts
consisted of two large posts and at
least two smaller posts. One of the

archaeological testing in this area, sections of two
rooms were exposed near the southwest corner and
the southeast corners of the fort (South Wall Rooms
1 and 2 respectively). Excavations were fairly limited in South Wall Room 2 so the exact function of
this structure is not known. Investigations were more
extensive in South Wall Room 1. This building is
the only room excavated to date that may represent
a structure used as something other than a household. Although household-related items were found
inside the room, large quantities of what appears to
be a powdered pre-mix used in construction were
found near the eastern end of the structure (Figure
16). The building may have been used to store
construction materials at one time although additional excavations are needed to verify its usage.
Another goal of the investigations is the definition of the relationship between the first wooden fort
and its later stone replacement. The remote sensing
surveys have generated data that provide some interesting clues to the placement of the original fort.
Sections of a stockade trench were detected by both
the GPR (Osborne 2004) and the magnetometer surveys (Figures 15 and 17). The trench was located in
the area where Lafora indicated the presence of a
wooden stockade on the south side of the fort. An
excavation unit was opened in order to verify the

stakes but have since deteriorated.
The distance between the two large
posts is approximately 120 cm.
Presumably, this pattern of large
stakes evenly placed at regular intervals with smaller posts placed
in between was continuous.
The remote sensing survey also
revealed additional bmied features
that have yet to be velified through
excavation. For example, the magnetometer survey detected another
similar trench feature directly underneath the south stone wall (Jim
Bruseth, personal communication
2004). This feature may represent
an earlier wooden stockade that was
replaced with stone. If the remains
of a wooden stockade are found beneath the stone wall, an argument
can be made that this feature represents the oliginal fort. The GPR
survey also helped delineate the outline of the southern wall. The configuration of both the southwest and
southeast comers closely mirrors the
layout depicted by Lafora (see Figure 15). Perhaps most exciting is
the fact that the foundations of the
southeast comer where the second
miginal bastion was built appear
fairly intact. As previously noted,
historic accounts describe the pres-

the southwest and northeast comers
that did not exist in 1767. The remote sensing survey of the northeast comer, although limited, does
not show extensive archjtectural remains that would indicate the presence of a bastion. The features detected in the southwest comer, while
similar to the layout recorded by
Lafora, do appear to be slightly
larger and may represent the addition of a bastion. Excavations in the
southwest comer have been primarily limited to West Wall Room 1.
Nonetheless, a small area of about
4 x 4 square meters was opened to
the south of the room where a bastion may have been constructed. The

Important features are being revealed through the archeological

unskilled labor. The sophisticated
stone work observed in the door

and possible evidence for another bastion in the southwest corner.
The archeological work at Presidio San Saba is
still on-going and future investigations will focus
on defining the bastion in the southeast corner and
the architectural remains in the southwest comer,
exploring the findings of the remote sensing surveys, and examining additional rooms for evidence
of workshops or storerooms that may have been
used by the Spanish residents. Ideally the information generated by the work that is completed at the
site will serve as a basis of comparison for other
studies of presidio architecture. The ultimate goal
of the excavations, however, is to provide enough
data for a more precise reconstruction of the presidio
and the lifeways of its inhabitants.

A Case Study in Colonial Evolutionary Architecture
Mark R. Wolf with Spanish translations by David R. McDonald

ABSTRACT
A visible landmark on the northern edge of the Texas hill country since its inception, even in its current ruinous
state, the Spanish presidia San Luis de las Amarillas-also known as Presidio de San Saba-was an outpost that was
under almost continuous construction. Originally established in May, 1757 near present day Menard, Texas, as a
crude wooden compound, the presidia was converted over time to a stone structure, the ruins of which can be still
seen today. While this conversion from wood to stone has generally been known, recent translations of key rediscovered transcripts of primary Spanish Colonial documents are revealing a sequence of previously unconsidered
construction techniques and timelines. This new understanding of the construction sequencing will require a reevaluation of data from recent excavations at the presidio, and a re-consideration of future excavation plans.

data for Presidio de San Saba by presenting chronological translations of six key documents after an
overview of the construction sequence as we presently understand it. Suggestions will also be provided for their use in understanding the architectural history of the presidia. The reader must recognize this is a very preliminary report. While the
data presented is quite valuable, it is not presented
as being comprehensive or complete. More archival research is ongoing and another, more complete
report, incorporating corresponding archeological
evidence, is planned for the future.

ARCHITECTURAL HISTORY
For a general overview of the founding, life,
abandonment, and after-life of the presidio please
refer to Robert S. Weddle's (1964) classic, The
San Saba Mission, Spanish Pivot in Texas. This
book gives a masterful portrayal of the extreme
conditions and isolation in which the priests, the
few Indian converts, Spanish soldiers, civilians
and their families existed in the remote San Saba
river valley under extreme and hostile conditions
from 1757-1770. Weddle also provides insight into
the continual use of the presidia up to current

times. With respect to this report, we will review
and expand on what has been previously understood about the architecture of the wooden
presidia, and through its initial conversion from
wooden to stone materials. The timeframe in this
report will focus on events from May, 1757
through November, 1761. This was a very dynamic period in the life of the presidio.
By order of the Viceroy, Marques de las
Amarillas, the construction of the presidia was to
be built of timber as economically as possible
(Weddle 1964: 43). It was a large compound, protecting the largest garrison in Spanish Texas (100
men and their families-approximately 400 people).
The initial presidio was built of wood and consisted of a stockade which surrounded small, mudcovered wooden jacales or huts with straw roofing. The presidia also had gun platforms or bastions constructed for the cannon (Nathan and
Simpson 1959:xvi).
The presidia compound was much larger than
that of the nearby Mission Santa Cruz de San Saba,
which also began construction in May, 1757,
approximately four miles downstream on the
opposite bank of the San Saba River, for the
conversion of the Lipan Apache (Castaneda 1938,
Dunn 1914, Weddle 1964). During the fateful attack
on the mission and subsequent siege of the presidia
from March 16-21, 1758, approximately 300
soldiers and family members, along with horses

and other livestock, were brought into the presidio
for protection (Nathan and Simpson 1959:50, 52).
Brief references were made of reinforcing of the
presidio at this time, but no details were offered
(Nathan and Simpson 1959:48).
Construction of the initial presidio was under
the supervision of Colonel Diego Ortiz Parrilla and
was accomplished through the summer months of
1757. Letters from Parrilla to the Viceroy, Marques
de Amarillas (Gilmore 1967:44-72), were very general in content with respect to the actual construction sites or techniques-Parrilla seems to concentrate most of his writings on more administrative
and political topics. Very few physical references
to the initial presidio are mentioned in documents
found to date, other than usually describing
Parrilla' s reluctance to remain at this exposed site
(Castaneda 1938:398, 399).
Apparently, material improvements to the
presidio were minimal from 1758 through 1760
(Weddle 1964: 150). After command of the presidio
was transferred in October, 1760-from Parrilla to
Captain Phelipe de Rabago y Theran-the presidio
began its transformation from wood to stone construction (Weddle 1964:154-155). Rabago and his
contemporaries have proven to be more descriptive
writers, at least when it comes to describing the
presidio and the material improvements made to it.
Rabago's November 6, 1761 letter, included in this
report (Document 6 below), even has him boasting
to the recently appointed viceroy Marques de Cruillas
that the presidio was beginning to resemble a castle!
No contemporary graphic drawings of the
early wooden presidio have been discovered to
date. There are three known detailed drawings of
the stone presidio-one by Rabago ca. 17631764-apparently a conceptual plan for the stone
conversion (Archivo de San Fernando el Grande,
vol. 18:46, 47), one by Nicolas La Fora (Carlson
1992:49), and another by Joseph Urrutia (Moorhead 1991: 138-139). Both La Fora's and Urrutia's
plan maps were prepared simultaneously in 1767
as documentation for the Rubi expedition, and
both depict the presidio in its nearly complete
form. The La Fora and Urrutia maps have been
long recognized and considered as the final stone
presidio plan. However, excavations in 2003 and
2004 have revealed additional footings for rooms
not previously shown along the southern wall (see
Walter, Wolf and Kimbell, this volume), thus confirming additional construction continued perhaps
until, or even after, its formal abandonment.

Thus, while detailed information of the stone
presidio has been available, primary descriptions of
the wooden compound have been very general and
sketchy in comparison until now. The following
recently translated letters now provide very interesting and startling details regarding the evolution
of the wooden presidio phase.

THE TRANSLATED DOCUMENTS
In a recent attempt to pinpoint the actual location of the wooden presidio, the author, in collaboration with archeologist Dr. Kathleen Gilmore, began a search for primary documents written by
Rabago, Parrilla, or their contemporaries, which
would provide more definitive information on the
location of the wooden presidio. Twentieth century
documents written and drawn by J. J. Callan (1901),
a pioneer Menard County settler, implied the
wooden and stone presidio sites might be in separate locations (for a copy of the 1901 map, see
Walter, Wolf, and Kimbell, this volume). The document search was conducted in preparation for a
planned field survey at the presidio in November,
2004. The survey was conducted by Dr. James
Bruseth and William Pierson (Texas Historical
Commission), Dr. Kathleen Gilmore, Dr. Tamra
Walter (Texas Tech University), Tiffany Osburn
and the author.
Time allotted for document research and translation was extremely limited. However, a swift and
successful search of Spanish Colonial transcripts at
the Center for American History in Austin, Texas
yielded good results. Quality translations and additional research were provided by Spanish Colonial
historian David R. McDonald. These translations
now provide a new understanding of the evolutionary architecture now known to exist at this site. The
documents also reveal much rich detail about the
terrain, environs, and extreme living conditions encountered in the remote northern outposts of Spanish Texas during that time.
The six documents featured here span the time
frame from October, 1760 to November, 1761.
This was a politically pivotal time in the presidio's
history. Colonel Parrilla, after his perceived punitive attack in 1759 of the Taovaya village on the
Red River failed, was relieved of his duty as commander of the presidio (Weddle 1964:137, 138).
He was replaced in October, 1760 by Captain Phelipe
de Rabago y Theran, a previously disgraced

Wolf-Presidio De San Saba 47
officer who actually was the commander of these
troops at the San Xavier mission and presidia
complex prior to Colonel Parrilla' s appointment
(Castaneda 1938, vol. III). In an interesting
agreement between Parrilla and Rabago, Parrilla
continued to administer the presidia while under
the command of Rabago until January 1, 1761, at
which time Rabago then assumed full command
(Castaneda 1939:40). Now, cleared of charges
and re-instated, all eyes were watching Rabago

to see how he would perform. Rabago wasted no
time in establishing himself as Commander
through his large scale material improvements to
the presidia.
The architectural descriptions found in these
documents provide new understandings in the development of the presidio's construction. As such,
please note that, for reference, all pertinent architectural topics in the following letters have been set
in bold type for clarity and emphasis.

Document One
Author's synopsis: When summoned by the Viceroy to testify in Mexico City regarding the ill-fated
1759 punitive campaign against the northern tribes who attacked the presidia and destroyed the mission on
March 16, 1758, Colonel Parrilla called on Captain Manuel Rodriguez to assume command in his absence
(Weddle 1964:150). Since Parrilla never returned to the San Saba valley-being replaced by Phelipe de
Rabago y Theran, Rodriguez found himself in the awkward position of having to officially participate in
the transfer of command of the presidio to Rabago. His certification is part of a lengthy auto in which he
minces few words in describing the conditions under which he has had to endure. Rodriguez provides a
terse description of the poor quality of construction evidenced at the wooden presidia. Rabago then
includes documents of his own, dated October 6th and 11th.
Manuel Rodriguez to the Viceroy: October 6 , 1760, with corresponding documents by Phelipe de
Rabago y Theran, et al, dated October 6 and 11, 1760.
CERTIFICATION I, Manuel Rodriguez, captain for His Majesty of the Royal Presidio San Juan
Bautista del Rio Grande de! Norte and Commandant of this presidia of San Luis de las Amarillas
(which I have been by request of Colonel Don Diego Ortiz Parrilla), say that Don Phelipe de Ravago
y The ran, proprietary captain for His Majesty of this said royal presidia, has released me by means of
the foregoing requisitory order [exhorto ], and I legally certify, to the extent I am permitted, the
following points that are expressed as follows:
That during the time I have commanded this presidia, its complement of regular enlistees
[arreglados 1 has never been complete. But counting the auxiliaries. with the regulars I have
received. the total is more than one hundred.1 These troops and their officers, however, were always
divided between this presidia and that of San Antonio in order to situate it [in coordination with] the
said presidia of San Antonio because of the zeal of the barbarous enemy nations who have attacked
this presidia.
With regard to what he [Rabago] says about the equipment of the soldiers who have been in this
presidia, it is clear [to me after] having seen [the troops] I have dispatched to escort the pack animals
carrying the supplies, that those who have left were equipped in one unit; but with only one horse
[each], and they numbered twenty men, with ten more that were gathered at the [presidia] of San
Antonio for the rearguard of the supply train.
Of the remaining regulars and auxiliaries that have remained in this presidia, most are without
leather-jacket armor [cueras] and many of them are without swords or shields. The mounted guards
are armed with only muskets and munitions.
Regarding horses-how many are being kept at the said site in San Antonio in charge of that
commandante, I cannot say, nor do I know what [horses] they will be able to have. Here, I have
maintained those horses that are sufficient for an infantry on foot. 2
I have never seen the royal soldier record book [filiations], regulations, and superior dispatches
cited in the said requisitory order [exhorto ]. I have requested that Don Miguel Gortari, treasurer of
the said Colonel [Diego Ortiz Parrilla], who is present at this presidia, produce them, but he has
told me they are not in his possession.

48

Texas Archeological Society

Regarding the auxiliaries who remain in this presidia I certify that they have accompanied me in
pe1forming their service on foot and they have complied faithfully in all that has been ordered. As a
result, it is just that they should be conceded licenses [to leave] except for those who truly wish to
remain. The total number of auxiliaries is thirty-two.
Regarding the cannons, I have six in the bastions [baluartes] of this presidio, but I do not know
to whom they belong, nor do I know the existing amount of powder and ball, for it is kept in
possession of the said Don Miguel [de Gortari].
The construction of this presidio is composed of a surrounding stockade in the manner of
chamacueros, 3 as they are called in these lands. It will not last long, since the posts in the ground
will rot and the houses [casitas] will be ruined-as has happened with two of them that have
collapsed. Also, there has never been a stock [cepo] for punishment.
In view of foregoing, Seiior Don Phelipe de Rabago y The ran, to order for your troops to pass in
review and receive and the rest of it, I transfer in the terms that would be most suitable, leaving me free
of this responsibility [so I may] return to my presidia where I may be needed. I leave the present
consideration thus to the service ofHis Majesty in order to provide supplies for his troops, being within
the assumption of the requisitory order [exhorto]. Dated this royal presidia of San Luis de las
Amarillas on October 6, 1760 and for certification, I signed: Manuel Rodriguez.
JUDICIAL PROCEEDING [AUTO] In the said presidia on the sixth of the said month and year,
I Captain Phelipe de Rabago y Theran having seen the foregoing reply and certification made by
Captain Manuel Rodriguez in which he stated that having served at this presidia by request of
Colonel Diego Ortiz Parrilla, but only in the governing of it and nothing else, and that for this
reason he could not transfer the company nor the rest of what is expressed in the requisitory order
[exhorto] that is the principle of these judicial actions and to urge that the said captain be
immediately permitted to leave when he pleases. And when Don Raphael Martinez Pacheco passes
in review of the troops and conducts the rest of the judicial actions with his citation because, as thus
I have been verbally informed by Don Miguel de Gortari, treasurer for the said Colonel, he is the
person whom the Colonel Don Diego Ortiz Parrilla had deputized to make the transfer. For this
judicial proceeding [auto] thus, I provided, ordered and signed before myself as judge receptor, for
lack of a royal public notary, and written on common paper for lack of what should be used. And I
swear to all the foregoing and signed it with the assisting witnesses, Phelipe Rabago de The ran. In
assistance, Lorenzo de Bustamente and Phelipe de Ojugas y Theran in the said presidia.
ANOTHER In this aforesaid presidia on the !Ith day of October and [the same] year, in view that
Don Raphael Martinez Pacheco has arrived at this presidia with the soldiers that were at San
Antonio de Bexar, I the said Captain, Phelipe de Ravago y Theran, should order and I do order that
tomorrow, the 12th, be cited, for him attend as the troops pass in review. In addition, I am
transferring the office of Presidio San Xavier to this one of San Saba, augmenting the military
positions in order to [strengthenJ4 those that are there. And thus I will transfer the royal book of
soldier records. For this judicial proceeding [auto] I have provided, ordered and signed, acting as
my [own] receptor as has been said, to which I swear. Phelipe de Rabago y Theran. In assistance,
Lorenzo de Bustamente; in assistancePhelipe de Ojugas y Theran.
CITATION In the said presidia on the same day, month, and year [October 11, 1760], I, the said
captain, in conformance with what was ordered in the preceding judicial proceeding [auto}, Don
Raphael Martinez Pacheco, whom I know and who personally appeared before me. I informed him
[about the proceedings], and having understood its content, he said the following: that he is ready to
attend to the review on the appointed day; that the royal book of soldier records is not in his
possession nor is it in the office of the presidia being transferred; that one and the other is in the
possession of Colonel Diego Ortiz Parrilla; that the company of this presidia comprises ninety-nine
men-one hundred counting the captain. In addition, he says that he has to receive by transfer, by
order of the said Colonel Diego Ortiz Parilla, four cannons, pertaining to me, that the said captain
brought on my account to Presidio of San Xavier which belong to His Majesty (may God protect
him), and another four cannons, with the powder and ball that may exist, that likewise belongs to His

Wolf-Presidio De San Saba 49
Majesty. The same captain responded and signed with me, along with those in assistance, and I
acted as judge receptor for lack of a public notary as had been noted, to all of which I swear. Phelipe
Rabago y Theran, Raphael Martinez Pacheco. In assistance, Lorenza de Bustamente and Phelipe de
Ojugas y Theran in the said presidia.

Document Two
Author's synopsis: In an interesting document written by an assemblage of military authors regarding
the potential of another attack on the presidio, reference is again made briefly to the palisade construction
of the stockade and houses. This short document reveals the high degree of tension and concern over
further aggression from the northern tribes, still felt almost three years after the mission massacre. It also
infers the poor condition of the wooden presidio at this time. Two signers of this document worth
mentioning are Bernardo de Miranda, discoverer of the still legendary Los Amalgres silver mine, some 80
miles east of the presidio, in 1756 (Castaneda 1938:379-382), and Joseph Antonio Gutierrez, a servant who
survived the attack and destruction of the Mission Santa Cruz de San Saba (Nathan 1959:43).
Declaration by Phelipe de Rabago y Theran, et al. Presidio San Luis de las Amarillas, February 24,
1761.

DECLARATION An Indian woman of the Lipan nation arrived at the royal Presidio de San Luis de
Las Amarillas on February 23, I761 at about noon. She is a fugitive from the Comanche Indians who
held her captive, and she gave the following account: That the said Comanche Indians, Taguayas,
Taguacanes, Quichos, Tancaguas, and Yiojuanes have joined together and are advancing toward
this presidia. For this pwpose they have dispatched spies who are traveling throughout this land,
gathering together the said nations. When the planting is finished [they intend] to unite and to
attack this presidio, bringing hatchets5 to cut the posts [palizada] of the jacales and set fires- all of
which was communicated by words and perceptible signs. Those present were Pedro Hernandez,
Alferez Asencio de! Raso, Sergeant Joseph Antonio Flores, Bernardo de Miranda, Corporal Juan de
Ungria, Joseph Antonio Trujillo, Ignacio Leal, Joseph Antonio Gutierrez, Miguel Gortari and Joseph
Gil, who signed with me (those that were able). Phelipe de Rabago y Theran Proprietary Capitan for
His Majesty (may God protect him) in this said royal presidia before me as judge receptor, assisted by
my witnesses for lack of a public or royal notary and on [common] paper for lack of any that is
stamped - to which 1 swear: Phelipe de Ravago y The ran. In assistance [as witnesses]: Lorenza de
Bustamente and Antonio Melis.

Document Three
Author's synopsis: Written shortly after the above letter, the following certification, by seasoned
officers who had been at the presidio since its inception, appears to have been intended for the new
Viceroy, Marques de Cruillas, as a historical overview of the trials endured in the San Saba valley. Clearly
written to place Captain Rabago in a very favorable view, the letter begins with a recap of the major
participants and events surrounding the destruction of Mission Santa Cruz de San Saba. More interesting
though is the description of the existing presidio construction, including previously unknown details, as
well as the very ambitious expansion and remodeling work planned and initiated by Rabago. Thus, it is
now to be understood there were in fact two distinct wooden presidios-Parrilla's and Rabago's.
Certification by Lieutenant Juan Galvan, et al. to Viceroy Marques de Cruillas. Presidio de San Saba.
February 27, 1761.
CERTIFICATION-Most Excellent Senor
Seiior-Don Juan Galvan, Lieutenenant; Don Asencio del Raso, Alferez6 ; Joseph Antonio Flores
and Pedro Jimenez, sergeants of this royal presidia de San Luis de las Amarillas, present since its

50

Texas Archeological Society
establishment at this San Saba River, certify insofar as the law permits us and no more, in order to
manifest to the most excellent Viceroy, the Governor and Capitan General of this New Spain, that
at the same time this presidia was built a mission was put to the east on the bank of this river. It
had three missionaries 7 from the Apostolic College of Santa Cruz de Queteraro and a lay brother
[who came] with the ardent zeal to congregate in it the Indians of the Lipan [Ypandes 8 ] nation so
they would embrace the faith. During this time there arrived at this presidia some eight hundred
souls of both sexes of the Lipan nation to consult with the reverend fat he rs and they remained in
accord for the time in which they had to come to settle at this site. But they went away because the
reverend Father President Fr. Alonzo Giraldo [Terreros] had not brought the supplies [avio] to
distribute among them, for he had them at the missions of the River of San Antonio, from where he
had to bring it, as was [eventually] done. During this time the mission was assaulted by the
Taguayas, Taguacanes, Yojuanes, Yervipiamos, Mayeyes and other northern nations. They destroyed the mission, burned it, and killed two missionaries and many other persons who were
there. Afterwards no efforts had been made to congregate the said Lipan Indians in mission, but
they continued to come and go to this presidia-and the reverend fathers have been desiring and
hoping for the opportunity to congregate them. When the Captain who now is at this presidia, Don
Phelipe de Rabago y Theran, came from [Presidio] del Sacramento to this one he traveled
through the land to which the Lipan nations had retreated. During this trip he told the Lipans that
he had to come to live with them. From that time he has not stopped persuading them and giving
gifts to secure their reduction and to congregate them in mission, telling them of the great benefit
that they would gain. They responded that they were very afraid of the interior nations already
cited. But he assured them that he would defend them with his soldiers-and if these were not
sufficient he would bring more. [He said that the enemy Indians] would have to kill the said
captain and all the soldiers before he would let them be hurt. Assured by this word the said Lipans
are offering to gather to congregate in mission, which notice the captain has given to the
Reverend Father President of the Missions of San Antonio, Fr. Acisdos9 Valverde. He was very
pleased with this news and said that he will come next April, no matter what hardships are
necessary, because of his ardent zeal for the conversion of these nations.
In addition, we certify that this presidio, since Captain Don Phelipe de Rabago took possession [of this presidio], has been maintained with ninety-nine military positions. That its
occupation in the time of Diego Ortiz de Parilla was in bringing supplies, guarding the horse
herd, and building this presidio with some small houses made of posts [casitas de palizada]
commonly called chamaqueros. 10 And these little houses were all the security, force and
rearguard that Colonel Parrilla left, along with four adobe bastions [baluartes de adobe] which
wzth the rains have been ruined. Today, the efforts of the troops [continue in] escorting
supplies, guarding the horse herds and other expeditions to bring recruits of capable men for
the service, to bring horses and staff the presidio. The rest of the men work at enclosing the
entire presidio with thick, tall posts so that the little houses are within the stockade. 11 They are
building two bastions-one a terraplein 12 with palisades high and thick, the other is roofed and
serves as the major guard [grail guardia] so as to not impede the handling of the cannons. It is
equally palisaded like the other bastion and in the same manner the [stockade] is being put in
circumference of the presidia. Previously, a large distance was cleared so that the vegetation
[monte] will not hinder the cannon fire. Also, the said captain is planning to plow and see if the
lands are suitable for the sowing of corn, wheat, and other crops. But reports have been
received from two Indians about the barbarous Indians who in other occasions have killed and
robbed, as already expressed, saying that they are coming to attack in a greater number and
force [see Document 2 above]. Because of this only one and one-half fanegas 13 of corn was
planted in order to attend to and complete the stockade. The captain bought eight yokes of oxen
in San Antonio with the desire to build the entire presidio with stone, but the severity of winter
did not permit further progress in the material construction of it. And so that this may be known
and manifest where it is needed we state this in this royal Presidio de San Luis de Las Amarillas on
February 27, !761. For those who did not know how to sign their names, Joachim Urandain

Document Fou:r
Author's synopsis: In this letter, Rabago responds to the Viceroy's request for more information on the
material existence of the presidio and its environs. He also takes advantage of the situation and elaborates
on his presidio remodeling plans, describing in detail the actual work currently being accomplished at the
presidio.
Letter-Phelipe de Rabago y Theran to the Marques de Cruillas. Presidio San Luis de las Amarillas.
March 2, 1761.
Most Excellent Senor,
On the day 18th of February, I received the superior order from Your Excellency of the 17th of
November of the past year [of 1760] in which Your Excellency ordered me to give an account of the
location of this presidia, its neighboring Indians, with the clearest report [of] individuals and the
number of troops in the presidia, progress made in the establishment of the presidia and the
missions, in the spiritual conquest of the Indians, and everything else pertaining to the sovereignty of
his Excellency in the state of and number of troops that is involved in its daily operation discipline,
aptitude and functions that it exercises.
The Presidio San Luis de las Amarillas is situated on the north side of the San Saba River. To the
east are extended plains; to the west, an abundance of building stone, woods, pastures, watering
places for cattle and horses, and everything needed for settlements. It is located on the margins of
the provinces of Texas, New Mexico, Nueva Viscaya, Coaguila. Two hundred twenty-five leagues to
the east of this presidia is that of Los Adaes, where the Governor of Texas resides. It is located
seventy leagues northwest of San Antonio de Bexar; from the Presidio San Juan Bautista it is 120
leagues to the north east; the distance from this presidia to the Presidio del Sacramento, also in the
province of Coaguila, is 140 leagues to the south; at the union of the River Concho and that [Rio
Grande] of the North is a presidia whose captain is Don Alonso Victores Rubin de Celis, located 140
leagues to the northwest[sic].
There are 99 troops in this presidia at the time, including four officers. ... Since I arrived at this
presidia, the continuing operation of the troops is for a party to patrol the frontier to the north;
another party cares for the presidia' s small horse herd; another, with an officer, transports supplies
from the missions of the San Antonio River; a lieutenant with six soldiers recruits people capable of
service in the province of Coaguila to replace the auxiliaries that Col. Don Diego Ortiz Parrilla
obtained-who have presented writs [permitting them] to return to their homes. .. Nineteen men do
daily guard duty and they are waiting for transfer [se mantienen estos de planion]. For a month and
a half the remainder are removing the woods that surround this presidio so that the thickness of it
not impede firing of the cannon. And at the same time [they are] strengthening [the presidio] as
much as possible, for [I found its] structure in such miserable condition, as your excellency can
see from the certification that accompanies the diligencias cited, given by the captain of the
Presidio del Rio Grande [Manuel Rodriguez], whose testimony consists of three pages.
For this reason I have built two elevated bastions [baluartes] made of very thick wood. One has
an embankment [terraplen]; the other is roofed with room for many soldiers [capaz para gran
guardia] and operation of three cannons. In the same manner I am equipping and fortifying the
entire presidio with a thick palisade [estacada] that is not less than 8.3 feet in height [3 varas] not
counting 4.3 feet [1.5 varas] fixed in the ground. And the two bastions with six cannons cover the
entire presidio in any direction or purpose that may be needed. However, I need two soldiers skilled
infiring the cannon. Despite efforts it has not been possible to teach them because of their stupidity.
The poverty of these troops, [the fact that] they are running out of offensive and defensive
armaments, horses, and the other necessary items to pe;form their services, does not permit me to do
more than fortify the presidia and maintain this place until my supplier [el habio] arrives from that
city. My agent [apoderado] advised me on January 11, he will leave that city on the 251" of the same
month, bringing everything necessary of clothing, armaments, saddles, saddle bags [cojinillos],
bridles, and everything needed for a well-equipped soldier. For this purpose he advises me that
fourteen families are ready to march from the Sacramento Presidio [Presidio Santa Rosa].

Real Presidio de San Saba, March 2, 1761, Phelipe de Ravago y Theran
[to] Most Excellent Senor [Viceroy] Marques de Cruillas

Document Five
Author's synopsis: In this letter to the Viceroy, Rabago gives a very descriptive account of his exploration
of the lands north and west of the presidia, also documenting rivers and springs which he qualifies as good
locations for new settlements. He begins the letter documenting the completion of the new stockade, an effort
which took over four months.

Letter-Phelipe de Rabago y Theran to the Marques de Cruillas. Presidio San Luis de las Amarillas.
July 12, 1761.
Most Excellent Senor,
Senor,
Having completed the stockade [estacada] of this presidio, about which I have informed Your
Excellency, I also obtained the droves of horses that I had requested to outfit these troops. And I
immediately put them in continuous motion to occupy these frontiers-that is to patrol the countryside to find out if the enemy intends to attack the presidia.
For this purpose I dispatched a lieutenant with forty men to the northwest of this presidia with the
order to reconnoiter the land, the resources it offers, plains, rivers, springs of water, Indian nations
that inhabit it, and their alliances and customs. After an expedition of twenty-four days he returned
and reported that he had discovered five springs of water that form a substantial river. The first
spring joins with the wooded14 spring at a distance of about 73 miles, from this presidia; the second
at about 13 miles; the third and fourth at 2. 6 miles each; and the fifth is a distance of 16 miles from
it origin. 15
All of these springs are sufficient for settlements, with wood and stone for building, plains for
planting, and everything needed for establishing populations. These springs of water form a river that
had been called "Florido, " 16 and it joins with the Colorado. This last has its origin at a distance of
about ten to twelve leagues straight ahead to the Rio Puerco [Pecos]. It comes through a very extended
plain [plan] from the wooded area of the land17 (like the acequia of Istucalco that enters that city) and
runs North to South and joins with the Rio Grande del Norte toward its midpoint. The lieutenant found
its waters to be SO feet in width 18 and 3.7 feet in depth. 19 To the north and south there were plains as far
as the eye could see. To the west ran two sierras in which woods could be discerned. They found two
salt lakes, one on the east side and the other on the west side of the same river.
They also encountered a pueblo of Indians on the march, and when the soldiers discovered them
the Indians fled. The lieutenant arrived at the said pueblo and did not permit any soldier to take the
least thing from them. And a short distance from there, about a league, the lieutenant stopped where
two Indians came showing that they had come to give thanks to him for not having taken anything
from his village. They were very amazed that Spaniards had come to that place, for they had not
known of them except from their relations with the Apaches. When the Spaniards asked why they had
fled, they responded that they had believed them to be Comanches, which a few days earlier had
finished off one of their pueblos. Feaiful of another [attack], most of the people had run away to a
nearby pueblo to warn them so all could retreat to the sierras. But realizing that the Spaniards were
good people, they went to advise their community and they all came to trade with the Spaniards.
After having treated them well and giving them presents that the officers and soldiers brought, the
Indians said goodbye saying that they would return. The troops waited two days at that place. Seeing
they did not come back the lieutenant decided to return to the presidia because these same Indians
had told him that nearby were other nations who were very bad. Nevertheless, he reconnoitered the
main part of the land that he traversed, which showed itself to be [ rich20 ] in minerals. All of which
it had seemed necessary to report to Your Excellency.
Regarding some of the mentioned springs of water, the Apache and Lipan Indians had already
informed me that they were suitable for population. And regarding these Indians, Senor Excellency,
I have come to the opinion that one of the reasons that they would not congregate in a mission is that

they pretend peace at [Presidio] San Antonio de Bexar, Villa de San Fernando, [Presidio] Rio
Grande and then openly go to war, robbing horses, eating the cows, and murdering [without any
retaliation against them .... ]2 1 If these robberies could be prevented, I do not doubt that they would
go into a mission and embrace the Holy Evangelist. I can not correct these abuses, however, for I
lack sufficient authorization, and I have bosses in all those said presidios for its contention [sic].

Document Six
Author's synopsis: Obviously proud of his accomplishments in the major improvements he has made
to the presidia, Rabago now describes his newest construction activity that initiates a new phase in the
permanent existence of the presidio. The creation of a two-story casafuerte, or strong house made of thick
limestone walls, located at the northwest corner of the site, begins the transition of the presidia from a
vulnerable wooden outpost to an impenetrable stone fortress, the ruins of which still exist today. Previous
writings (Castaneda 1939:41, 156, Weddle 1964: 155) alluded Rabago was boasting he had constructed the
entire presidio at this time to resemble a castle. It is clear that in this letter he was referring to the visual
impact of a limestone masonry structure-with a two story element-making its imposing statement in
contrast with the adjacent, more rudimentary wooden palisade. Rabago then lays out his plan to convert the
soldiers' quarters into stone structures-the work to be done by the soldiers on their own time.

November 6, 1761.
Most Excellent Senor,
Senor,
In consideration of the indefensibility of this presidia in case of an attack and the low morale of
the men, I initiated construction of the stockade about which I informed Your Excellency on
another occasion. I have proposed to the soldiers the necessity of a strong-house [casafuerte}, in
which all the men could be gathered and be defended in case it should be necessary. And I began
construction of it, to the men's enthusiasm, without regard to the cost (and it has not been cheap).
At the present it is being completed, and certainly in its fortification-being built with stone- it
resembles a castle and dominates the entire presidia which it can easily defend.
It appears that some Apache chiefs, reassured by the appearance of [the strong house], want to
settle at this river-not withstanding the fear that they always have of the other Indians who are their
enemies. It also appears that these [enemy Indians] have inspected the view of the said [strong]
house-but with contrary effect, because two numerous bands have arrived in this area and they
subsequently left without incident.
After the work is finished, which will be done in this month, I have also proposed to the soldiers
the construction of their houses in the convenient form, which they will be making according to
military duties. And in this manner the [strong}-house has been built; when completed, His
Majesty will have here the strongest presidia known in these lands. As for what is my responsibility, I assuage His Majesty with the large measure I have spent and will yet spend.
Now the Most Excellent Reverend President of the Missions has arrived here from Presidio del
Rio Grande (Fray Diego Jimenez). At his request, I detennined-meanwhile that Apache chiefs have
just arrived- to negotiate their entry into missions [reducci6n] and make a new examination of
irrigable lands, waters, woods, and other necessary resources for a settlement on this river. And
without doubt that all such is found in this interior land and river that offers so many and such
utilities, as you will understand from the judicial proceedings for the Apaches's mission that are to

be conducted. I do not omit to represent to Your Excellency's zeal that within this terrain is the
nearest and most numerous Indian nations who, if missionized, could shape land into a new kingdom
because the many rivers at proportioned distances offer opportunities for settlements that can
develop the great amount of minerals that at each step are encountered.
May our Lord God guard the important life of Your Excellency in the greatest health for the many
years that this kingdom requires royal Presidio of San Saba, November 6, 1761

CONCLUSIONS
The translations presented here, considered
together, represent a body of knowledge previously unconsidered in contemporary histories
(Castaneda 1939; Gilmore 1967; Weddle 1964)
regarding the evolutionary construction of the
presidio. An architectural chronology can now
be created which strongly suggests the post was
in a logical state of continual improvements and
expansion throughout its years of operation. It is
now apparent this work was a systematic progression of construction, not massive undertakings completed in compressed bursts of activity.
Based on these documents, a construction timeline can now begin to be established regarding
the creation of and modifications to what we
now know are two distinct wooden presidios.
See Figure 1 for a conceptual model of the presidio' s phased construction.

Parrilla's Wooden Presidio
Against his better judgment, and pressured by
the Franciscan priests to concede the establishment
of the presidio and mission along the San Saba
River, Colonel Parrilla began construction of the
presidio in early May, 1757. Erected as quickly as
possible, we now know the post consisted of a
crude chamacuero stockade with four adobe bastions. Within the stockade were built small chamacuero houses-very crude forms ofconstruction consisting of vertical posts driven into the ground and
lashed together with leather rawhide binding. The
actual shape of the presidio's footprint has yet to be
determined. Trees were cleared away from the compound, with the trunks and secondary branches serving as structural or stockade construction material.

The roofs of the houses were of straw thatch (Nathan
1959:55, 96).
While it is yet unknown how much additional
construction occurred at the site during Parrilla' s
tenure, there appears to have been minimal maintenance at the post. By October, 1760, the bastions
had basically melted into unusable masses and at
least two of the small houses had collapsed. Clearly,
the Lipan Apache could not have considered this as
an impressive and protective place of refuge, especially after the nearby mission-of similar construction-was so easily destroyed by their enemies.
This level of construction quality, or rather lack
of it, seems to be a pattern with Parrilla. In 1750,
Parrilla was charged with the construction of the
Presidio San Miguel de Horcasitas (Polzer 1997:
382). While larger in scope, the presidio was also
crudely built of both wood and adobe. By 1757, the
presidio was already rapidly deteriorating. The wood
was rotting and the adobe walls were melting away.
Formal inspections and charges were made against
Parrilla, who countered that he had appointed others to perform the actual construction and it was
they who were accountable for the work (Polzer
1997:381-406). The crude workmanship cited is
similar to the descriptions for Presidio de San Saba.
Rabago's Wooden Presidio
When Captain Rabago assumed command, he
made a point to describe the deplorable physical
condition of the presidio. To his credit, he quickly
began an ambitious improvement plan, literally surrounding and replacing Parrilla's presidio stockade
with his own comparatively stout wooden structures. During the winter of 1760-1761, perhaps motivated by fear of another full scale attack by the
Northern tribes, Rabago began a more significant

clearing of the area around the presidia, gathering
thick stout logs of over 13 feet in length. In February, 1761, construction began for the new stockade
which apparently encircled the existing frail presidia
enclosure. Two new large bastions and a large
roofed room were also built to replace the four
melting adobe bastions. This work continued from
February until July, 1761. It is unknown if any of
the original presidia materials were re-used in construction of the new compound. It is also unknown
if the Parrilla-era buildings were removed at this
time. However, the presidia now was much more
secure and defensible.
It should be noted that Rabago planned from
the outset to convert the presidia from wood to
stone construction, as he had purchased eight teams
of oxen in 1760 for the purpose of hauling quarried
stone to the site. However, the very cold winter
weather precluded such an endeavor. When faced
with the possible threat of a Norteno attack as
warned by the Lipan woman, Rabago most likely
felt obligated to strengthen the presidia rapidly and
thus chose to build the stout wooden stockade and
bastions out of necessity. Clearly, this was always
considered an intermediate solution.

Parrilla's time were still in use. This may also imply
the conversion of the wooden stockade into the stone
rooms as delineated on the 1767 maps. The letter also
states the soldiers were obligated to build their own
rooms on their own time (Castaneda 1939:41).

Archeological Considerations
During the recent excavations conducted by
Texas Tech University and TAS from 2000-2004,
various features were revealed which may appear unrelated to the stone presidia construction
(Walter, et. al. 2003:29, 30). These include a subsurface remnant of an intact wooden post-uncovered within the existing presidia plaza (Figure 2), post molds (Figure 3), apparent trenches,
daub stains and a variety of pits and middens in
seemingly unrelated locations. In November,
2004, excavations by Texas Tech University, under the direction of Dr. Tamra Walter, revealed
the southern 'corral' trench-as indicated on the
La Fora and Urrutia maps. The trench, complete
with in situ bases of placed wooden posts, contained Spanish Colonial potsherds within its soil
matrix (Figure 4). It is unknown at this time if

Conversion to Stone
In the late summer or autumn of 1761, Rabago
began his conversion of the presidia into stone.
While the new wooden stockade was a great improvement over the flimsy chamacuero stockade, it
still had defensive limitations since the stockade
was only just over 8 feet high. While defendable by
the troops, it could still be easily scaled in an attack. Based on Rabago's letter of November 6,
17 61, there was concern about the protection of the
garrison should this event occur. Rabago describes
the construction of a large stone 'casafuerte' which
could hold all the troops in defense. His description
of this work seems to match the grouping of the
two-story stone rooms, surrounded by a patio,
shown on LaFora's and Urrutia's 1767 maps and
noted as the officer's quarters. The foundations and
base courses of these very thick and mortared walls
exist today at the site. And their more precise construction, at a different angle from that of the adjacent stone soldiers' quarters, suggests different construction episodes for these rooms.
Rabago continues in his letter to describe future
construction of soldiers' quarters 'in the convenient
form.' This may imply the original small casitas from

Figure 2. View from 2003 of excavation of wooden post
discovered in eastern central plaza area.

Wolf-Presidio De San Saba 57

this trench possibly served as a previous wooden
presidio wall component (Gilmore 1967:17).
Consideration of the now known phases of the
presidio footprint requires a revisit of these features
with respect to their place within the construction
sequence. Additional remote sensing of the presidio
site should reveal the post molds and multiple wall
trenches of varying depths for the original wooden
stockades and chamacuero structures. Careful observations of all excavations within the plaza area
of the stone presidio may reveal subtle construction
data and provide information on the actual
'presidios-within-a-presidio,' thus presenting a
unique opportunity to further understand the rich
history of occupation at the Presidio de San Saba.

ENDNOTES
1. Passage is underlined in the typescript.
2. Rodriguez seems to be referring to soldiers as dragoons, who ride out to a conflict but dismount to fight.
3. Although the word "chamaquero,"or "chamacuero"
was widely used during the 18th and 19th centuries, it
does not appear in any Spanish dictionary, dictionary
of Mexican Spanish, Hispanic encyclopedia, or lexicon. Both the jacal and chamacuero were makeshift
structures used for living or utility purposes, but to
contemporaries there was a clear distinction between
the two. The chamacueros were evidently built with
upright posts that were secured with leather (cuero),
similiar to what John James described in his diary while
in San Antonio in February 1855: "Others [houses]
were built of tree trunks-some of which were irregular and crooked-set in the ground and bound together
at the top with transverse pieces of lumber, outside and
inside, tied with thongs of rawhide, the interstices between the tree trunks filled with lime mortar, the roof
thatched." (Smith 1955).
4. He uses an unknown word here: Sabeer.
5. Text says "hayas," but there is no such noun as haya,
or aya, that fits this context, which calls for some kind of
cutting instrument. Whoever made this transcript probably a misread "hachas" (hatchets, or axes) for hayas.
6. The dictionary defines "Alferez" as an infantry standard bearer. Various documents show that that the position was ranked between lieutenant and sergeant.
7. The text uses the term "religiosos," or religious, meaning members of a religious order.
8. Hence, "Ypandes" is rendered "Lipan."
9. Fr. Asiclos Valverde, according to Fr. Marion Habig
(1976:59).
10. Chamacueros were simple structures built with vertical posts caulked with mud and probably fastened at the
top with rawhide. See description in Footnote 3 above.
11. "Stockade" and "palisade" are used interchangeably
here.
12. The top platform of a rampart for the cannon.
13. Approximately 2.5 acres. One fanega of land is the
area that can be planted with one fanega (1.6 bu.) of
seed, or about 1.6 acres.
14. The word "Para!'' has several meanings that do not
really fit this context-such as scaffoling and the upright
posts on a cart. It can also mean (mar.) launching way.
Rabago may have meant "Parral," which would refer to
vines or grapevines at the spring.
15. Twenty-eight leagues, five leagues, one league, one
league, and six leagues respectively. One league equals
2.63 miles (Johnson, Jelks 1958:416, Gilmore 1967:27).
16. This was the Concho River, according to Weddle
(1964:151).
17. Pelo de la tierra.
18. Eighteen varas in width.

19 One and one-third varas in depth.
20. Typescript says "paino"-there is no such word in
Spanish.

An Inter-Landscape Comparative Analysis in the Southern
Trans-Pecos Region, Texas
Samuel S. Cason

ABSTRACT
This article presents archeological data from Perdiz Creek, collected during the 2000 Texas Archeological
Society field school. Survey and test excavation data from Perdiz Creek are compared to Gilliland Canyon using
a landscape approach, noting differences in feature distributions and environmental contexts. Coarse-grained
observations are used to construct hypotheses concerning mobility patterns in different landscape settings.
Recommendations are made about how similar analyses may contribute to an understanding of prehistoric
behavioral diversity in the southern Trans-Pecos and hunter-gatherer studies in general.

INTRODUCTION
Recent field investigations in the Southern
Trans-Pecos provide archeological data that add to
our growing understanding of behavioral diversity
in the region. Data are presented from small scale
test excavations and survey along Perdiz Creek focusing on high visibility features related to prehistoric subsistence. This information is compared to
that collected at a contrasting study area, Gilliland
Canyon, one with a distinctively different environmental setting. Although subsurface excavations
were undertaken only at Perdiz Creek, the focus of
this investigation is on the distribution of surface
features including hearths and middens. The archeological material observed at each study area is
the result of palimpsest deposits, overlapping occupations and events, and a range of taphonomic processes (Folley 1981). Therefore, the analysis is
based on the overall assemblage of features rather
than on aspects of specific sites, components, or
cultural historical taxonomic units.
Information from Perdiz Creek was collected by
members of the Texas Archeological Society (TAS)
at the organization's annual field school in 2000.
The event was hosted by the Center for Big Bend
Studies (CBBS), headquartered at Sul Ross State
University in Alpine, Texas, and was carried out on
the McGuire Ranch in the Southern Trans-Pecos
region of Texas. The CBBS provided logistical

support and framed the project's research goals and
objectives. TAS also provided logistical support as
well as funding. Robert J. Mallouf, CBBS Director,
and William A. Cloud, CBBS CRM Coordinator,
directed the project.
There is a dearth of information about prehistoric lifeways in the Southern Trans-Pecos region,
particularly of the Marfa Plain where the McGuire
Ranch is situated. As the Marfa Plain is a veritable
blank spot on the map of archeological knowledge
of the region, any information constitutes a significant contribution. Known sites were assessed in
preliminary investigations preceding the field
school, and several were selected for follow-up subsurface test excavations to determine the nature of
archeological deposits and to assess their archeological integrity for future investigations. Investigations indicate that there are distinct differences in
the feature assemblages between the Perdiz Creek
and Gilliland Canyon study areas.
Ethnographic accounts of modern peoples related to mobility and subsistence are used to understand prehistoric behavioral variability in the
Southern Trans-Pecos region. Binford (1980)
makes useful distinctions between logistical and
residential mobility and the factors that condition
these variations. In this model, logistical movements, such as hunting trips and gathering forays to
acquire resources are contrasted against movement
of residential camps and living units. Resource

distributions play a critical role in conditioning a
spectrum of mobility variants. This variability is
best understood when viewed as responses to different environmental conditions, particularly
macro-regional or large-scale ecological settings.
According to this familiar model, one might expect Southern Trans-Pecos mobility behaviors to
trend towards the forager end of the mobility continuum. Relative to Great Plains groups, TransPecos inhabitants would have had relatively more
frequent residential moves, while logistical moves
may have been shorter and more frequent. This is
primarily due to vegetative and trophic environments. The plains environment supports large mammal food resources; these resources are highly mobile making for very patchy and unpredictable resources, suggesting that a logistical strategy of
bringing resources to a central camp through extended logistical forays would be most profitable.
While the Southern Trans-Pecos resources are not
homogeneously distributed on the landscape, resources are more predictable with respect to their
location and seasonality. Accordingly, moving between "patches" of resources would seem a more
viable strategy.
In further contrast, the arid adapted behaviors of
Southern-Trans Pecos inhabitants can be expected to
differ significantly from arboreal or equatorial groups.
It is speculated that Southern Trans-Pecos groups
had a lower rate of residential moves, as they were
somewhat tethered by water sources (see Taylor
[1964, 1966] for a description of tethered nomadism). Trans-Pecos environments are more 'patchy'
than forest or tropical environments, as these high
primary productivity areas are characterized by more
homogeneous distributions of resources (Kelly 1995).
While Southern Trans-Pecos inhabitants appear
to fall towards the forager end of the continuum,
intra-group behavioral variability is an important consideration. Changes and variation of subsistence related mobility are explicit components of Binford's
model and are the focus of this investigation.
Lee (1984) and Yellen's (1976, 1977) accounts
of the Dabe !Kung are instructive in this regard. The
!Kung are similar (though not simply analogous) to
inhabitants of the Southern Trans-Pecos in that they
rely on adaptations to an arid environment. In the
Kalahari, mobility is strongly conditioned by variable
distributions of resources and seasonal availability
of water. Their dry season camps host high visibility
material evidence for both shelter and food
processing. During this portion of the year residential

mobility is extremely low and logistical foraging
mobility is high, as they are extremely tethered by
very localized and limited water sources. Alternately,
during the wet season, residential groups fragment
into smaller group parties, picking up camp and
making more frequent residential moves, traveling
between different resource patches. These wet season
camps, occupied for only a few days, would show
little evidence of habitation.
Binford (1980) notes characteristic archeological signatures for these different mobility strategies. With decreases in residential mobility and
increases in length of logistical movements, he expects higher visibility material remains in residential localities. In a forager context, this can be a
result of redundancy, where localities are used repeatedly from season to season. To simplify this
observation, we can speculate that where residential mobility is lower, logistical forays are more
lengthy; where use of the landscape is more redundant, we can expect higher visibility archeological
remains. This generalization is somewhat intuitive,
in effect saying the longer a group stays in one
place, the more debris they will leave behind. From
this somewhat oversimplified observation it is postulated that between environmentally contrasting,
but similar sized study areas, we can discern differences in mobility patterns and land use.

LANDSCAPE AND. SCALE

This investigation of Perdiz Creek, Gilliland
Canyon, and the Southern Trans-Pecos utilizes the
concept of landscape, adapted from the discipline
of landscape ecology. The methods used in the
current project are not a drastic departure from "site"
based investigations, but the application of the landscape concept is intended to be a tool to define the
scale of investigation not frequently addressed elsewhere in archeological investigations. This concept
of landscape usefully integrates ecological ideas
and places emphasis on the relationship between
resource distributions and human behavior.
Definition of scale has been brought to the
forefront in landscape ecology and the search for
understanding between pattern and process (Butzer
1980; Black et al. 1997:16-17). Levin (1989) notes
that the selection of a proper scale of analysis is
contingent on the pattern that is under investigation. In this sense, one can expect that the processes
needed to explain inter-site patterning would be

Cason-Prehistoric Archeological Investigations at Perdiz Creek 63
different from those needed to explain intra-site
patterns. Similarly, the information needed to understand the mobility strategies employed in a single
drainage basin (Steward 1938) would be different
from that needed to explain mobility strategies employed in different parts of the world (Binford 1980;
Kelley 1995).
A landscape can be somewhat difficult to define, as it has been referred to in many ways in
various disciplines. Farina (1996:2) describes a landscape as "a particular configuration of topography,
vegetation cover, land use and settlement pattern
which delimits some coherence of natural and cultural processes and activities." Forman (1995:13)
provides a more practical definition, describing the
spatial extent of the landscape scale:
A landscape is ... a mosaic where the
mix of local ecosystems or land use is
repeated in similar form over a kilometers wide area where several attributes
tend to be similar and repeated across the
whole area, including geological landforms, soil types, vegetation types, local
faunas, natural disturbance regimes, land
uses, and human aggregation patterns.
Thus a repeated cluster of spatial elements characterizes a landscape.
Forman (1995: 14) further notes some important
attributes of a landscape: "The above-described
concept, now widely used, integrates a focus on:
a) spatial pattern; b) the area viewed in an aerial
photograph or from a high point on the land; and
c) unity provided by repeated pattern." The definitions provided by Forman and Farina suggest
that, regardless of the inherent ambiguity of the
term, some consensus can be reached as to what
defines a landscape.
The landscape defined by Fonnan, and used here,
lies within a hierarchical system of scale, including
in descending magnitude: biosphere (planet), continent, region, landscape, local ecosystem, and site. In
this scheme, the degree and shape of forest canopy
might be used to understand animal behavior at the
site level, while large scale weather patterns might
be needed to understand species distributions at a
regional or continental level.
The Perdiz Creek and Gilliland Canyon study
areas do not in themselves define or fully encompass
landscapes, as their boundaries are defined by
property boundaries and logistical constraints. They
do, however, represent significant samples of

landscape units from which it is possible to project
patterns and processes. While this concept is fraught
with practical difficulties, it serves as a useful
interpretive framework upon which we might build
future investigations and research designs (see Black
etal.1997:16).

PERDIZ CREEK WITHIN
THE SOUTHERN TRANS-PECOS
CHIHUAHUAN DESERT BIOTIC
PROVINCE
The Perdiz Creek study area is located in the
southern Trans-Pecos, a geographical region dominated by the Chihuahuan Desert biotic province
(Brown 1982a). The Chihuahuan Desert is classified as warm-temperate, and is the largest desert
region of North America, covering significant portions of Mexico's northern states, southwestern
Texas, southern New Mexico, and southeastern Arizona. It is characterized as a high desert with elevations between 400 m along the lower Rio Grande
and 2000 m in its southwestern extent.
Temperatures range from exceedingly hot summers (>40 C) to cold winters (<30 C); typically
there are 200-250 frost-free days during the year
between March and the beginning of autumn. Precipitation ranges between 200-300 mrrJyear and
varies greatly over its geographic expanses (Brown
l 982a). The majority of precipitation occurs as intense thunderstorms between May and September;
the most intense storms occur the late summer.
Rainfall usually falls during warm seasonal periods
when evapotranspiration is high and effective precipitation is much lower. Thunderstorm runoff is
quickly channeled by flashfloods, resulting in little
effective moisture.
The Chihuahuan Desert shares a characteristic
with two other North American deserts: a floral
dominance of Larrea tridentada (creosotebush).
This species is typically commingled and shares
dominance with Flourensia splendens (tarbush) and
Acacia neovericosa (whitethorn acacia). Other characteristic floral species are Fouquieria splendens
(ocotillo), Koeberlinia spinosa (allthorn), and a wide
variety of others. Modern boundaries of the
Chihuahuan Desert are a reflection of a relatively
recent encroachment of very xeric conditions into
regions of semidesert grasslands. More than 1000
plant species endemic to this region form a distinctive overall biotic community. The Chihuahuan

64

Texas Archeological Society

Desert is essentially a shrub-dominated biome with
leaf and stem succulents (cacti) assuming a secondary and localized role in plant communities.
Powell (1998:2) notes: "In overall profile the
Trans-Pecos can be pictured as extensive lower
elevation flats, slopes, dunes, basins, hills, ridges
surrounding higher, island like mountains, plateaus, and basins" (Figure 1). The range of mean
annual temperatures, amounts of monthly rainfall,
and vegetation communities further demonstrate
the diversity of these topographic settings. Some
of this environmental diversity is characterized by
biotic subdivisions.
Brown (1982a) recognizes several biomes
(biotic communities) within the Chihuahuan

Desert. Biomes are natural formations within a
biotic province characterized by distinctive
vegetation physiognomy. Biomes are "plant and
animal community responses to integrated
climactic factors, more or less regional in scope"
(Brown 1982a:9). The divisions pertinent to the
present investigation include desert scrub,
semidesert grasslands, interior chaparral, and
the madrean montane forest. Not all of these
biotic communities are fully encompassed by the
Chihuahuan Desert, but all are present and
adjacent within the Southern Trans-Pecos,
forming the mosaic character noted above.
In the southern Trans-Pecos, there is an overall
correlation between lower elevations and Chihua-

huan Desert (desert scrub) flora. Mountain "islands"
are the principle features of macro topographic
relief, and desert flora is present on their lower
slopes to the extent that soils, moisture, and
elevation factors permit. The desert scrub biome
(Brown 1982b), which accounts for much of the
homogeneous appearance of the Chihuahuan Desert
plant assemblage, is subdivided further into three
different communities, based upon: 1) soil
properties, (2) topographic relief, (3) bedrock
substrata, and (4) local climate.
The "plains community" is dominated by three
shrub species: creosotebush, tarbush, and whitethorn
Acacia. This triad is commonly mixed or broken by
stands of Prospis glandulosa var. torreyana (mesquite) and is characterized by expansive outwash
plains, low hills, and valleys. The distribution and
nature of this community type is significant in respect to the presence of mesquite, which has been
documented historically and ethnohistorically as an
important subsistence staple for human populations
(Simpson 1977).
The "succulent scrub community" is found on
slightly higher elevations that display more topographic relief. Plant community associations include
Euphorbia antisyphilitica ( candelilla), Agave
lechugilla (lechugilla), and Ocotillo. The change to
"succulent scrub upland" in the desert scrub biome
occurs at still higher elevations, accompanied by an
increase in leaf succulents that include Agave,
Hechitsa, Yucca, and Dasylirion (sotols). Lechugilla
is often found in dense and nearly impenetrable
stands interspersed with a modest number of woody
shrubs and cacti.
Succulent scrub communities frequently grade
into semidesert grasslands at their upper limit and
co-mingle with summer grasses (Bouteloua),
sparse Pinon, and chaparral. Desert scrub also
comes into contact with madrean evergreen woodland or interior chaparral (see below). The presence of sotol, agave, and yucca in these communities suggest their distribution was an important
factor in prehistoric subsistence. Powell (1998:7)
notes that there is a strong correlation between
bedrock substrate in these areas and the preponderance of yucca and agave. A sotol-lechugil1a
association is common on limestone hills, whereas
a sotol grassland association is more common on
igneous formations.
Brown (l 982a) classifies the semidesert
grassland biome as warm-temperate grassland in
a semiarid environment characterized by drying

wind and frequent droughts. More xeric plant
communities have substantially encroached upon
this biome, and the landscapes hosting these grasslands may have been significantly different in
the recent past. This possibility is a compounding, if not confounding, factor in ecologicalarcheological correlations.
Semidesert grasslands are typically situated at
elevations between desert scrub and mountain evergreens and chaparral. They generally receive between 250 and 450 mm of precipitation per year
where predictable summer rainfalls support perennial bunch grasses, dominated at lower elevations
by Bouteloua gracilis (blue gramma) and Buchloe
dactyloides (buffalo grass).
Dasylirion wheeleri (sotol), Nolina microcarpa
(beargrass) and agaves are present in varying frequencies as are varieties of yucca, mesquite, and a
host of other forbs, succulents, and shrubs. These
species of dry-tropic stem, leaf succulents and
scrub serve to break up expanses of grassland landscape. Tarbush, whitethorn Acacia, Mesquite,
Creosotebush, and cacti are typical Chihuahuan
desert scrub species that are found to invade grasslands in increasing rates.
The "interior chaparral" corresponds to
Powell's (1998) classification of oak-pinyon juniper woodland. Brown (1982a) describes this biome
as a climax community dominated by a pinyonjuniper association with a preponderance of oak
species, predominantly Quercus (live oak). These
oak species host prolific acorns seed crops that
provided a significant subsistence resource to historic and prehistoric populations.
The "madrean evergreen woodland" biome
corresponds to Powell's classification, conifer
forest and is classified as a mild winter- wet
summer woodland. Trees include evergreen oaks
between 6-15 m high and alligator and one-seed
juniper. Quercus grisea (emory oak and gray
oak) are common, alongside Arbutus arizonica
and A. Texana (madrones). At higher elevations,
these species grade into conifers, including ponderosa pine and sparse stands of aspen. This
biome occurs at a similar elevation gradient as
grasslands and its formation may be soil and
moisture dependant. The madrean evergreen
woodland appears savanna-like, and is often
found within or above drier interior chaparral
with a mean annual precipitation range of 200400 mm. These conditions provide optimal habitat for white tail and mule deer.

Texas Archeological Society
Perdiz Creek Study Area Environment

The Perdiz Creek study area lies within the
McGuire Ranch, located south and west of the town
of Marfa, Texas, and is approximately 35 mi (56km)
southwest of Alpine, Texas. The Del Norte Mountains lie 25 mi (40km) to the east; the Chinati Mountains lie 35 miles (56km) to the southwest, and the
Davis Mountains are 30 miles (48km) to the north.
The ranch occupies approximately 60,000 acres that
encompass a variety of topographic and ecological
settings (Figure 2).
The study area is drained by Perdiz Creek,
which runs roughly west to the southeast, joining
Alamito Creek to the south of the study area. The
surrounding uplands are made up of highly eroded

rim rock of igneous rhyolite and basalt, and form
the western counterpart of the linear escarpment
east of Alamito Creek. Small tributaries of Perdiz
Creek produce a complicated erosion pattern, forming what Kelley et al. (1940:82) refer to as a "veritable bad-land." The landscape is highly irregular
compared to the eastern portions of the McGuire
Ranch. To the east of Alamito Creek is an escarpment of basalt that parallels the main drainage. This
escarpment forms a north-northwest to south-southeast trending cliff line.
More xeric desert scrub communities have progressively impinged on the grassland biome, supplanting some admixture of desert scrub plant species. Still, the landscape adjoining Perdiz Creek to
the east hosts a very different semidesert grassland

Perdiz Creek
Study Area

Cason-Prehistoric Archeological Investigations at Perdiz Creek 67
plant assemblage. The predominant biotic community within the Perdiz Creek landscape unit is a
plains community desert scrub dominated by
tarbush, creosote, and acacias. It is possible that
during prehistoric times the amount of topographic
relief and the prevailing soil conditions would have
hosted a similar desert scrub environment. These
factors place the landscape within a fairly diverse
ecological setting situated at the junction of desert
scrub vegetation, a significant riparian corridor
(Alarnito Creek), and an isolated grassland. The
study area is within reach of several key resources:
game populations (pronghorn antelope, white tail
and mule deer, and, possibly, bison) in the grasslands; important water sources, water fowl, and
firewood along the riparian corridor. The diverse
plant resources within the desert scrub environment, particularly mesquite, likely played a major
role in foraging subsistence. Perdiz Creek is a relatively small drainage system compared to the adjacent Alamito Creek drainage. This larger drainage
corridor hosts more substantial alluvial terraces and
undoubtedly contained more predictable water
sources than Perdiz Creek. This last point is important to bear in mind during subsequent discussions
of land use of the Perdiz Creek area, as cultural
activities may have been more intense along
Alamito Creek to the east.

Paleoindian and Early Archaic periods are not well
represented in the study areas, an overview of
these time periods is pertinent to questions and
further research suggestions addressed at the close
of this investigation.
Paleoi:ndian Period (ca. 10,000-6500 B.C.)
Evidence of Paleoindian lifeways in the Southern Trans-Pecos is limited to sporadic surface finds
of Clovis, Folsom, Plainview, and Golodrina projectile point types. Nowhere in the region is there
evidence of long term campsites, large game procurement/processing, or rock shelter habitation.
Synthesizing paleoenvironmental data from pollen
studies, fossil packrat middens, and geomorphology, Mallouf ( 1981) postulates that Late-Pleistocene
environments in the Southern Trans-Pecos were
generally more moist and cooler than at present.
Conifer forests dominated high elevation settings,
and lower elevations were composed of mixed
woodland and scrub environments interspersed with
grasslands. His hypothetical model of Late-Pleistocene I Early-Holocene cultural interactions suggests changing climatic and ecological conditions
may have contributed to a shift to more diversified
Early Archaic subsistence economies by 8500 B.C.
This early change would have been coeval with
Folsom big game hunting lifestyles elsewhere in
North America.

CULTURAL HISTORICAL
CONTEXT

Archaic Period (ca. 6500 B.C.-A.D. 900)

Traditionally, Southern Trans-Pecos archeology
has been investigated and understood in a cultural
historical framework. Since excavations of stratified
cultural deposits have been relatively sparse, the
region's socio-cultural units are best understood in
relation to neighboring regions. Excavations in the
Southern Plains, Central Texas, and the Lower
Pecos River areas have provided relatively detailed
culture-chronological sequences. This is particularly true in the earlier cultural periods, including
the Paleoindian, Early, Middle, and Late Archaic.
The Late Prehistoric period is best represented by
stratified archeological sites in the Southern TransPecos, primarily those sites in rock shelters that
exhibit exceptional preservation, and in village
sites along the Rio Grande corridor. Excellent
overviews of the regional prehistoric cultural
history are found in Suhm et al. (1954) and Mallouf
(1985, 1999). While material representative of the

The Early Archaic (ca. 6500-3000 B.C.) is
poorly understood in the Southern Trans-Pecos due
to limited excavated components dated to this pe1iod. Manifestations of this period are restricted to
surficial finds of diagnostic aitifacts. These include
comer notched and expanding stemmed dart points
such as Baker, Uvalde, Martindale, Early Barbed,
Pandale, Zorra, Bulverde as well as ClemÂ· Fork tools
(Sanchez 1999). A comparison to cultural chronologies in adjoining regions provides the most useful
information about the Early Archaic. Prehistoric cultural units from the Lower Pecos River region are
provided by Weir (1976) and Prewitt (1981) and
include the San Geronimo through Marshall Ford
phases (Mallouf 1985). Diagnostic artifacts in the
Southern Trans-Pecos region suggest some attributes
are shared with these cultural units. Many of these
phases are only loosely defined and their viability as
sociocultural units is debatable (Johnson 1986).

68

Texas Archeological Society

These include Circleville phase (ca. 6550-5050
B.C.), San Geronimo phase (ca. 5050-4050 B.C.),
and Jarrell phase (ca. 4050-3050 B.C.).
Generally, it is suggested that Early Archaic
lifeways reflect a shift from specialized hunting to
a more diversified subsistence strategies. Technological innovations are evidenced by grass lined
pits, sandals, and matting. People of the Early Archaic made use of large earthen ovens with attendant burned rock middens, indicating a growing
reliance on desert succulents such as lechugilla,
sotol, and prickly pear (Mallouf 1985; Sanchez
1999). The lack of data from this period presents a
significant gap in our understanding of regional
prehistory and is considered as a high priority for
future research (Mallouf 1985).
The Middle Archaic (ca. 3000-1000 B.C.) is
better understood through dry cave excavations from
the region during the 1920s, '30s and '40s
(Campbell 1970; Kelley et al. 1940). Diagnostic
projectile points include Langtry, Val Verde,
Perdenales, Shumla (both early and late varieties),
Almagre, Marshall, and Arenosa. Other artifacts
reflecting technological change include increased
numbers of grounds tone and perishables (cordage,
sandals, netting, and others). Increased frequencies
of burned rock features such as hearth fields and
middens indicate a greater reliance on desert succulents (Mallouf 1985; Sanchez 1999).
The earlier portion of the Middle Archaic is
loosely associated with the Langtry-Val Verde complex (Mallouf 1985) and is believed to reflect influence from the Lower Pecos River cultural sphere.
Projectile point styles from the Southern TransPecos are diagnostic of several Lower Pecos River
and Central Texas phases (Prewitt 1981): Clear Fork
phase (ca. 2650-2050 B.C.); Marshall Ford phase
(ca. 2050-1450 B.C.); Round Rock phase (ca.
1450-650 B.C.). While there are some typological
similarities between projectile points of the Southern Trans-Pecos, Central Texas, and the Lower
Pecos River areas, "the typology and chronology of
one region cannot be transferred blindly to another
region" (Hughes 1991: 17). Instead, it is likely that
cultural developments between the three areas differed in significant ways. The number and density
of Middle Archaic sites suggest a substantial increase in local populations and an expansion of
land use strategies and adaptations to more diversified environments (Mallouf 1985).
The Late Archaic period has received slightly
more scrutiny than the earlier Archaic periods.

Kelly, Campbell, and Lehmer defined a Chisos
Focus in the 1940s, defined by substantial ring
middens, distinctive corner notched dart points,
basketry, and a number of other perishable items
found in dry desert caves. Roughly coeval phases
in the Lower Pecos River region include the Uvalde
phase (ca. 300 B.C. to A.D. 200) and the Twin
Sisters phase (ca. A.D. 200-500) (Prewitt 1981).
Data indicate a continued increase in site density and more varied landform use. Campsites became considerably larger and contained increased
numbers of burned rock features. There are sparse
indicators of cultigens in dry caves, but this minimal
evidence does not support an idea that horticulture or
agricultural was well developed. The material culture is more diverse, and perishable items are more
numerous in dry rock shelters. Increased site density
suggests continued population growth and adaptation to a changing environment (Mallouf 1985).
The Late Prehistoric Period
(ca. A.D. 700 -1540)
Compared to earlier periods, the Late Prehistoric has received substantially more scrutiny since
the 1930's. Elsewhere in North America, this period is marked by technological innovations including the bow and arrow, the advent of ceramics, and
the introduction of agriculture.
Archeological investigations have been most
substantive in the southern sector of the region,
mostly along the Rio Grande and its confluence
with the Rio Conchos on the Mexico side of the
river, or the "La Junta de Los Rios." This locality
was described by early Spanish soldiers, explorers, and missionaries during the time of European
contact (Kelley 1986). Kelley's investigations
(Kelly et al. 1940) established some of the Late
Prehistoric Period's earliest cultural constructs, and
many of these constructs apply to the study area
as well. These include the Livermore foci (now
termed phase) and the La Junta and Conception
foci. Local researchers refer to these foci as
"phases," a change from earlier taxonomic classification schemes.
The Livennore phase, dating between A.D. 900
to A.D. 1200 (Kelley 1957) and characterized by a
number of triangular and notched arrow points (including the Livermore style) may extend to southeastern New Mexico and as far south as northern
Coahuila (Mallouf 1999). Origins for the Livermore
phase may have been intrusive movements of Plains

Cason-Prehistoric Archeological Investigations at Perdiz Creek 69
groups (Kelley et al. 1940), or alternately, the phase
may be indigenous in origin (Mallouf 1999).
The Late Prehistoric Period is much better
understood as a result of a series of excavations
and surface recordings in the La Junta district
(Kelley 1957; Kelley et al. 1940; Mallouf 1985,
1999). The earlier La Junta phase, A.D. 12001400, is characterized by distinctive technological
innovations: floodplain agriculture, pit house architecture, and adobe-jacal architecture. Representative sites are located in an area along the
confluence of the Rio Grande and its tributary
drainages. Structural remains include oval and rectangular pit houses that sometimes incorporated
low adobe walls or curbs in room blocks of several houses. Artifacts believed to be associated
with the Concepcion and La Junta phases include
arrow points (Fresno, Perdiz, Toyah) and ceramic
tradewares similar to those found to the northwest
in El Paso and New Mexico. Associated ceramic
styles include El Paso Polychrome, Chupadero
Black on White, and a variety of Chihuahuan
Polychromes (Kelley et al. 1940:34).
Architectural and ceramic styles indicate an
important relationship with Jornada Mogollon cultural spheres during this period. Kelley and Kelley
(1990) suggest intrusive movements into the La
Junta District, while Mallouf ( 1999) points out the
distinct possibility that indigenous peoples adopted
these technologies.
Mallouf (1999) has briefly described the Cielo
complex, that is roughly contemporaneous (A.D.
1300-1700) with the La Junta and Concepcion
phases. The Cielo complex is characterized by
circular stacked stone structures believed to be
wickiup type dwellings. These features are often
found together in village-like complexes found in a
circumscribed area near the La Junta District and to
the northeast (Mallouf 1999, Figure 14). Hearth
remnants and refuse deposits, as well as Perdiz
arrow points, chipped stone tools, and bone tools,
have been found in association with these stone
features. While these sites are near La Junta phase
architectural sites, ceramics are conspicuously
absent from Cielo complex sites. The close
proximity and overlapping dates of the La Junta
phase and Cielo complex suggest a unique
relationship between what appear to be relatively
mobile hunter-gatherer peoples and more sedentary
agricultural peoples. Mallouf ( 1999:73-85) discusses some exciting research questions regarding
the possibility of symbiotic relationships between

groups practicing different but complimentary
subsistence strategies. His hypotheses include: the
Cielo complex and La Junta phases represent ethnically and socially distinct groups in a symbiotic
relationship; or, Cielo complex sites represent
seasonal foraging camps of peoples based in the La
Junta district who practiced agricultural during
portions of the year or when conditions were
conducive.
The Concepcion phase incorporates developments in the La Junta district during European contact. This phase is marked by changes in architectural styles, changes in ceramic types, and other
changes in artifact assemblages (Kelley et al. 1940).
Habitation structures became larger and no longer
incorporated adobe in their construction. While
tradeware ceramics continued in use, Kelley notes
the use of locally produced wares, including Chinati
Plainware and Capote Red-on-Brown.
The Concepcion phase overlaps with the first
appearance Europeans: Nunez Cabeza de Vaca (ca.
1535), Espejo ( ca. 1582), and several subsequent
entradas (Kelley 1952, 1986). The archival records
from these entradas document the presence of indigenous groups, including the "Paturabeyes" and
"Jumanos," establishing a cultural territory in the
general Southern Trans-Pecos and La Junta district.
Mallouf (1999:76) suggests that, given symbiotic
relations between early Cielo complex occupants
and La Junta phase agriculturalists "there exists a
potential ancestral linkage of the Cielo complex to
the Jumano, Cibolo, or Chisos Indians of the 16th
and 17th century Spanish account."

PREVIOUS INVESTIGATIONS
Few archeological investigations have taken
place in the vicinity of the Perdiz Creek project
area, fewer still on the immediate Perdiz Creek
landscape. The only work documented was undertaken by J. Charles Kelley et al. (1940) and C.
Albritton Jr. and Kirk Bryan (1939). These collaborative efforts were part of a joint expedition sponsored by the Peabody Museum of Archeology and
Ethnology, which was organized to investigate archeological sites and associated geologic deposits
in the Big Bend region of Texas. The group visited
a number of sites in the region, conducted small
scale excavations, and made geomorphologic observations of surrounding soil deposits. Soil observations contributed to a geomorphic history of the

70

Texas Archeological Society

area, defining the Neville, early Calamity, and later
Kokemot soil formations (Kelley et al. 1940:48).
Two of the sites investigated by these early
endeavors are located approximately 22 miles south
of the confluence of Perdiz and Alamito Creeks.
The Shiner site (41PS26)is located along Alamito
Creek, where investigators encountered buried
hearths, pit house floors, and artifacts within Calamity and Kokemot formation deposits.
The Shafter site (41PS53) is located in an irrigation ditch adjacent to Alamito Creek. Here, in the
Kokemot formation, investigators recorded exposed
hearth features, charcoal lenses, and artifacts, including El Paso Polychrome ceramic sherds. Several possible house floors were noted among the
exposed cultural debris. Lastly, the group excavated a flexed burial that they suspected was
inhumed beneath a house floor. The cultural material at 41PS53 was attributed to the La Junta phase.
The Jordan Gap 1: 1 site is located on a small
west bank tributary of Alamito Creek approximately
one mile south of its confluence with Perdiz Creek.
In a cutbank, investigators noted four stratified occupations: groundstone in the lower Calamity formation assigned to the Big Bend Cave aspect, and a
hearth, projectile points, and chipped stone in the
upper Kokernot formation assigned to the Late Prehistoric Period.
The Alpine site (7:2S) is located on Perdiz
Creek upstream from its confluence with Alamito
Creek. This site is situated adjacent to the current
project area, below the basalt escarpment. Kelley et
al. (1940) recorded several distinct areas within
this site, each situated on a unique landform. The
team (Kelley et al. 1940:82) reported that, along
the creek:
at various points in the badlands area,
archeological sites erode from alluvium
at various levels, or appear in situ in
vertical arroyo banks. So vast is the
eroded area, so complex the archeological picture, that it is impossible to clearly
reconstruct events at the site. No excavation was attempted.
Immediately south of Perdiz Creek the landforms
are more stable. At various locations south of the
creek, Kelley et al. (1940) noted hearths exposed in
ancillary arroyo cuts, thick layers of fire cracked
stone, ceramic fragments attributed to the Alamito
phase, and brown corrugated ceramic sherds; all
were associated with Kokernot formation soils and

attributed to the Late Prehistoric. The group also
observed a burned and tanged projectile point, a
chipped stone blade, and crude bifacial tools within
the Calamity formation. These artifact types were
unfamiliar to the investigators and were assigned to
an unknown cultural affiliation.

2000 TAS ARCHEOLOGICAL
INVESTIGATIONS
Fieldwork and Methodology
TAS field investigations on the McGuire ranch
are best characterized as reconnaissance and subsurface testing. This is true of both survey and subsurface testing activities. The ranch was portioned into
seven survey areas (areas A-G) that roughly approximate an environmental stratification. Areas A through
D are located in the east and northeast portion of the
ranch and correspond to the semidesert grassland
biome. Areas E and F encompass the east and upper
rim of the basalt escarpment and the floodplain corridor of Alamito Creek, respectively. Area G is comprised almost entirely of the Frenchman Hills landscape and the Perdiz Creek drainage system. The
survey areas were demarcated for general logistical
purposes and do not represent a systematic sample
technique. None of the survey areas were covered in
their entirety but instead were spot-checked in a
reconnaissance fashion.
Crew members conducted a pedestrian survey
spaced at intervals approximately 20 m apart. They
documented resources in personal field notes and
recorded sites on state archeological survey forms.
Most sites were recorded with sketch maps using a
compass and pace technique, and global positioning devises (GPS) were used to record site locations. In all, 9000 acres were surveyed during 10
days of investigation. Due to time constraints, the
portions of the landscapes that were covered vary
greatly in shape and area. Accessibility and/or topographic setting determined survey locations.
The portion of Perdiz Creek in the southwest
portion of the McGuire Ranch is the focus of this
investigation(area G). It encompasses a segment of
Perdiz Creek and a number of smaller tributary
drainages northwest of its confluence with Alamito
Creek. These small drainage patterns are highly
irregular and form a badland-like topography. Area
G encompasses approximately 6,000 acres bounded
by the McGuire Ranch property lines. The steep

Cason-Prehistoric Archeological Investigations at Perdiz Creek 71
escarpment of rhyolite and basalt dominates the
eastern portion of Area G. It runs roughly northwest to southeast and overlooks Alamito Creek and
both its floodplain and te1wces to the east.
Prior to field school investigations, local informants with intimate knowledge of the landscape accompanied CBBS investigators on a preliminary reconnaissance. Archeologists visited
high visibility archeological resources that were
surveyed in a cursory fashion to determine their
potential for further investigation, particularly subsurface testing. Informants shared with CBBS investigators specimens in their own extensive artifact collections gathered from sites. Based on these
data, five sites were selected for further investigation and subsurface testing.
Preliminary field investigations noted a very
high frequency of humanly modified and naturally
occurring specimens of chalcedony on the crests of
landforms near the basalt escarpment. Abundant
debitage made of this material was found at many
of the sites and the intervening landscape. Earlier
visits to this area suggested that the rim escarpment, formed of vesicular basalt, was the source of
this raw material. This prompted an additional survey objective: to identify and document any possible chalcedony quarries.
Pedestrian Survey Results
Survey crews inspected approximately 440
acres of the escarpment landform and examined the
high flats west of the rim, nearly vertical exposures, and the colluvial talus immediately below
the escarpment. They recorded five sites within this
small sample area.
Site 41PS832 is a high density scatter of
debitage found among the widespread scatter of
debitage covering much of the landform. The site
occupies and area roughly 100 m across.
Site 41PS833 is an extension of a diffuse lithic
scatter that covers a large peninsular rim rock projection in the southeastern portion of area G. This
portion of the rim rock escarpment is dominated by
a moderately dense scatter of debitage of locally
available chalcedony. The site area measures approximately 100 m across and is bounded by natural breaks in the rim rock that drop away steeply
towards the Alamito Creek floodplain to the east
and the erosional cut made by Perdiz Creek. A light
density scatter of burned rock was found among the
debitage, but no distinct features were noted. There

is an exposure of banded chalcedony along the steep
escarpment of the basaltic rim rock formation.
Site 41PS834 is likewise an extension of this
ubiquitous scatter of debitage and burned rock that
covers much of the uplands. This location was noted
for the higher density of debitage situated on the
upper edge of an arroyo cut that incises the landform. A single unifacial scraper and projectile point
were mapped and collected from the surface. The
extent of the high density scatter covers an area of
23 x 30 m.
Site 41PS839 is located at the bottom of a
small arroyo cut that incises the eastern boundary
of the rim rock escarpment. Two hearths were noted
along the small drainage within an incipient terrace. Each of these hearths are semi-intact and located in a light to moderate density scatter of burned
rock. An unspecified quantity of groundstone fragments were noted along with debitage and bifacially modified flakes. A finger-like projection of
the rim rock escarpment overlooks the site from the
southwest. Atop this landform is a relatively a high
density scatter of chalcedony debitage.
Site 41PS841 is located at the head of a small
arroyo cut that incises the rim rock escarpment,
overlooking Alamito Creek floodplain to the east.
At the head of the drainage cut, on the upper escarpment, is an exposure of basaltic bedrock.
Ground into this surface is a set of five mortar
holes that vary in dimension from 11-18 cm deep
and 20-34 cm in diameter. Situated among these
mortar holes is a small tinaja depression that holds
water from surface runoff. Investigators found one
ground stone mano, three scrapers, two small dart
points, and two late-stage biface fragments in the
vicinity of the mortar features. An unspecified
amount of debitage was noted as well. A second
tinaja is located approximately 15 m north of the
bedrock mortars. These natural features hold water,
which would have aided in the processing of resources. Approximately 100 m downstream from
the head of the drainage, below the upper escarpment, is an in situ exposure of chalcedony within
the basaltic parent material that shows signs of quarrying. Overall, this site location is advantageous
due to its proximity to numerous resources, including standing water, bedrock for groundstone implements, and chipped stone procurement.
Sites recorded in the course of pedestrian survey
are generally characterized as diffuse lithic scatters
associated with the fairly ubiquitous presence of
chalcedony and rhyolite raw materials. Furthe1more,

survey substantiates that many high visibility
features and sites had been identified by local
informants along the lowlands of Perdiz Creek and
its tributaries.
Subsurface Testing
Five sites in the Perdiz Creek study area were
selected for subsurface testing. Each locality was
surface mapped and tested to assess the nature and
extent of subsurface deposits. Excavations consisted
of lx 1 m test units or smaller subdivisions. Units
were laid out in reference to a site datum on a
magnetic north and east-west grid system established independently at each location. Units were
excavated according to 10 cm arbitrary levels and
screened through 118 inch machine cloth. Artifacts
recovered in the screening process were collected
according to 10 cm levels and assigned a single lot
number. Artifacts discovered in situ were assigned
a separate lot number and plotted on unit plan view
maps. In several instances, soil and feature matrix
samples were collected for future analysis.
Surface artifacts, outside of established excavation units, were treated in a variety of ways.
Unmodified debitage was estimated without quantification or specific provenience, while formal tools
were mapped in place using a theolodite or a total
data station (TDS). Diagnostic projectile points were
given horizontal provenience and assigned individual lot numbers. Beyond this general description of testing methods, each location is discussed
independently below.
The Gallie Site (41PS838)

The Gallie Site is situated on the west bank
terrace of Perdiz Creek. The site area measures
150 m north-south by 75 m east-west. It is a broad
and relatively light density scatter of chipped and
ground stone artifacts among burned rock features
and incipient midden deposits. There are several
exposures of basaltic bedrock along the creek bed
where tinaja depressions have formed; one of these
holds water even during extreme dry seasons.
Cultural material is concentrated on the eastern
part of the terrace where it slopes toward the bend
in Perdiz Creek. This part of the landform receives
over-bank flooding deposits during periodic wet
seasons, and the edges of the landform are subject
to arroyo cutting and high energy erosion. Several
of the burned rock features that are exposed in this

area are probably the result of erosional forces that
partially uncovered these buried deposits.
Eighteen cultural features were encountered on
the surface of the site. Twelve of these were hearths,
70 cm to 3.0 m in diameter. These features were
scattered over the site area with no readily
discernable clustering or intra-site patterning. Four
additional features were burned rock clusters or
concentrations. Two clusters are very suggestive of
dump piles from hide lined boiling basins. A single
incipient midden feature was recorded on the eastern portion of the landform. This feature occupies
an aerial extent of approximately 20 m square, consisting of a high density scatter of burned rock in
the midst of dark, charcoal stained soil. Burned
rock is uniformly distributed within the feature, but
is not so dense as to dominate the soil matrix.
Midden deposits are not substantially mounded
above the surrounding ground surface and its shape
in generally amorphous.
Chipped stone artifacts observed on the landform surface include a variety of small, stemmed
dart point fragments as well as arrow points and
fragments. Unmodified debitage is abundant and
dominated by locally available chalcedonies. Groundstone artifacts include mano and metate fragments.
Seven units (four lx2 m and three lxl m) were
excavated at the Gallie site to investigate the nature
and integrity of subsurface deposits and to determine the morphology of burned rock features. Test
unit 1 was excavated wi.thin a relatively high density surface scatter of burned and fire cracked rock
(FCR). FCR and frequent charcoal flecking is
present to 30 centimeters below surface (cmbs).
Moderate amounts of debitage accompanied this
light, midden-like deposit. A single utilized flake
and a Perdiz arrow point were recovered from the
first 10 cm level of the unit.
Test unit 2 was excavated to a depth of 20
cmbs. Chipped stone debitage decreased in frequency with depth, and charcoal flecks were found
sparsely scattered in the soil and matrix. One biface
fragment was recovered from level 2.
Test unit 3, a 1 x 2 m unit excavated to a 20
cmbs, yielded nine pieces of debitage in the first
level and two pieces in the second level. Test unit 4,
a lxl m unit excavated to 10 cmbs, yielded ten
pieces of debitage and one Livermore arrow point in
the single level excavated. Test unit 5 was placed on
the perimeter of the incipient midden feature. Profile

three levels excavated. Very little burned
rock was noted. Test unit 6, a lxl m unit,
was excavated within Feature 6 (Figure 3).
Excavated to 40 cmbs, the profile revealed
a basin shaped hearth with a moderately
charcoal stained matrix and sparse FCR.
Test Unit 7 (1 x 2m) was excavated
over Feature 8 (F8), a remarkably wellpreserved hearth (Figure 4). This unit was
placed to bisect F8 in order to determine
feature morphology. The hearth proved to
be a slightly basin-shaped depression filled
with numerous basaltic cobbles, tightly
packed in a circle 1. 7 m in diameter. The
profile of the feature indicates it is 15 cm
deep with abundant charcoal chunks (Figure 5). A large fragment of mostly burned
wood was recovered. The matrix surrounding the FCR was collected, as were large
quantities of bulk carbon for radiocarbon
dating. The single submitted radiocarbon
sample (Beta-161391; see Table 1) was

resulting in a highly irregular calibration curve. The hearth basin excavation revealed linear impressions, probably the signs of the
excavation of the depression during hearth construction. These impressions on the base of the feature were noted as "digging stick
marks" and attest to the general
integrity and preservation of the
feature despite its surficial context.

the ground surface. This feature (Hearth 1) was
well intact (Figure 7). FCR was tightly packed
within a 4 m diameter area with a central, highdensity concentration of FCR measuring 1 m
across. All FCR was carefully mapped before removal and the unit was trench excavated across
the feature to obtain a feature profile sketch. Artifacts within the feature consist of 19 pieces of
unmodified debitage. Feature fill samples and matrix were collected, as well as bulk-carbon used to
acquire radiocarbon dates. Several large fragments
of charcoal were noted in the samples that may be
adequate for wood species identification.
A single charcoal sample (Beta-161388) was
submitted for radiocarbon dating and returned with
a date range (calibrated) between AD. 1530-1550
and AD. 1630-1950 (see Table 1). These disparate
ranges are a result of the high variability in atmospheric Cl4 during this time frame. The intercept

cobbles within a matrix of soil that is heavily

multiple concentrations of FCR obscured by loamy
sand overburden. A high-density scatter of artifacts, 15 features, and a large midden deposit were

features consist of discrete burned rock concentrations that represent hearths with various amounts
of disturbance, ranging from mostly displaced to
strongly intact.

On the surface, the midden feature is not
substantially mounded and does not have any visible
central hearth or depression. Burned rock was found
in moderate density and is not tightly packed within
the surrounding charcoal stained matrix. FCR is

distributed in an area that measures approximately
10 m across and is elliptical in shape. The
boundaries of the feature are not well defined, as
lighter densities of burned rock are strewn around

comprised of descriptions of artifacts and features
and their distributions.
At four sites, Windy Springs, Perdiz Creek,
Metate, and Gallie, a total of 20 1 x 1 m units were
excavated. All of these units were placed within
or in the vicinity of substantial subsistence related
features, ranging from incipient midden deposits
to hearth fields or individual hearths. Recovery
included large quantities of burned rock, debitage,
modified debitage, formalized tools including
bifaces and projectile points, groundstone, macro
floral and faunal remains, charcoal samples, feature matrix samples, and some few ceramic sherds.
Most of the artifacts on the surface of the tested
sites were merely noted in a rough inventory. Diagnostic artifacts were assigned surface provenience and collected.

Debitage
The objective of the lithic analysis is to account for frequencies of artifacts and types of
artifact classes within the small excavation
samples. Furthermore, it is used to give an impression of the nature and intensity of activities
preformed at the site area and within the landscape unit, with an emphasis on intensity of use.
It is hypothesized that frequencies suggest some
measure of energy expended at the site location,
intensity of energy expended in stone tool manufacture, and maintenance, as well as activities
carried out with the aid of these tools. The preparation of platforms would intuitively seem to be
a more intensive manufacture technique than
early-stage reduction. It could also be the case

that more specialized subsistence activities are
carried out with more formalized and refined tools.
All chipped stone from excavation units were
closely inspected and categorized according to specific attributes and unit provenience (Andrefsky
1998). All specimens were initially sorted accordirig to whether they exhibited modification in the
form of retouch, as informal tools. The unmodified
specimens were further sorted according to the
amount and portion of the flake represented. These
categories consist of:

Multiple facet: where the platform is
composed of more than one distinct
plane, often where smaller flakes were
removed from the edge of the core or
tool to prepare the platform for a specific
end result.
Ground: where the platform shows signs
of abrading and grinding, often to
strengthen the platform edge for a desired end result; another prepared platform.

Complete flake: a specimen with complete platform, distal termination and lateral edges.

Cortex: where the platform is a cortical
surface, indicating early-stage lithic reduction.

Flake fragment: a specimen with the
distal terminal portion of the flake absent, but with an intact platform.

Crushed: where the platform has been
smashed, often with a highly irregular,
stepped surface.

Chip: a specimen with the proximal portion and platform absent; distal and terminal portion remaining.
Chunk: a specimen with neither terminal nor proximal portion, where the approximate portion represented is extremely difficult to discern, and where
specimens are very angular.

Chipped stone from each level was next
classified as to whether there was any cortex left on
any portion of the specimen (cortex present or cortex
absent). Lastly, each complete flake and flake
fragment, i.e. specimens with an intact platform,
were examined with a 20 x hand lens to determine
the nature of the platform. These specimens were
then classified according to platform type:

Modified debitage was also inspected with a
hand lens, each piece being recorded with a set of
attributes including: portion of flake represented
(fragment, complete, etc.); number of modified
edges; length of modified edge; shape of modified
edges (concave or convex); whether it shows signs
of only modification and/or utilization.
Given the sample population, the percentage of
prepared platforms at all four sites is presented
(Table 3). These numbers are remarkably similar. It
can be postulated that if different activities, or
activities of different intensity, were practiced at
different locations in the Perdiz Creek landscape,
different percentages of prepared platforms would

be apparent in the archeological record. As these
numbers are not drastically different, it is postulated
that there is some uniformity or homogeneity in the
activities performed at these locations.
Figures 14-17 depict the frequencies of
unmodified debitage recovered from each level
of individual subsurface test units. They show
that in most cases artifact frequencies are highest
in the upper deposits of the excavation units,

indicating that these features and cultural
deposits are not deeply buried, and that the upper
ten centimeters are representative of the highest
density of cultural material. This is a useful
observation for future investigations, since it
points out that shallow excavations and testing
can yield useful information.
An exception to this point is the Metate Site,
where the highest average frequencies of artifacts

Cason-Prehistoric Archeological Investigations at Perdiz Creek 85
are found in level 2, 10-20 cmbs. Since this is true
concerning several units across the site area, the
site appears to have a buried cultural deposit.

Modified Debitage
Modified flakes occur in relatively small
numbers (n=40) compared to the amount of unmodified debitage recovered from all of the test
excavations. Very few of these specimens displayed a high degree of modification, such as
extensive retouching where the edge of the flake
has been substantially reduced. The majority of
specimens are fragmentary chips or flake fragments, and most specimens have multiple modified edges, both concave and convex. Material
types are dominated by a locally available red or
brown rhyolite, followed by locally available
chalcedony. Only seven of these 40 specimens
are formed on cherts that are not immediately
available within the study area. This fact suggests that these more 'exotic' materials were conserved for different types of tools, rather than
mere expediency tools like modified flakes. Alternatively, the abundance of locally available
materials may have obviated the need to construct tools from exotic stone.

Projectile Points
A total of 32 projectile points (Tables 5-6, Figures 18-21) were recovered from the ground surface and in subsurface excavations at sites in the
Perdiz Creek project area. These artifacts were anaTable 4. Frequencies of modified debitage

lyzed in the laboratory, where they were recorded
with a number of attributes. They consist of the
shape of stem and blade edges, neck width, base
width, length of blade, width of blade, and metric
weight. Formal typologies were assigned using descriptions from Suhm and Jelks (1962). Nine specimens were recovered from the upper l 0 cm of
excavation units, and two were recovered from 1020 cmbs. The remaining 21 specimens were recorded as surface finds at seven of the sites recorded in the study area. Due to the palimpsest
nature of surface deposits, their behavioral relationship to excavated cultural deposits and features
is very ambiguous.
The projectile point collection consists of 19
dart points, six arrow points, and six specimens that
are too fragmentary to identify with confidence.
Seven dart points have expanding stems, three have
parallel sided stems, three have bulbous stems, three
have contracting stems, and three are too fragmentary to classify the stem side shape. Dart points can
be classified as Palmillas (Figure 18, K; Figure 20,
U and X), Pandale (Figure 20, W), Paisano (Figure
20, V), possibly Almagre (Figure 18, I; Figure 19,
P), and Shumla (Figure 18, H; Figure 19, R).
Arrow points (n = 6) consist of two notched
specimens, one bulbous stem, two expanding
stemmed, and one contracting stem (Figure 18,AG). Specimens assigned to a formal typology include: two Toyah (Figure 18, C and E); three
Livermore (Figure 18, A, B, G); and, one Perdiz
(Figure 18, F).
Ten projectile points were recovered from
excavation units in a subsurface or near surface
context. Eight of these projectile points were found
at the Windy Spring Site. At the latter site, four
projectile points were recovered from a single 1 x 2
m excavation unit (N102/Wl 14). One Toyah arrow
point fragment (see Figure 18, C) was recovered
from level 1 of this unit, 7 cm below the ground
surface. A second projectile point fragment (see
Figure 21, bb) was recovered from level one and is
likely a shoulder fragment of a dart point too
fragmentary to be diagnostic. A third dart point
fragment (Figure 19, N) was recovered from level 1
of this unit; it is an un-typed, expanding stem
specimen. The fourth projectile point fragment
(Figure 18, K) was recovered from screened soil in
level 2. This fragment is the basal portion of a
Palmillas dart point. These specimens were found
within the boundaries of the midden feature in the
center of the site.

Chupadero Black on White pottery occasionally
noted elsewhere along the Rio Grande corridor
(Kelley 1940:34) and was included as an artifact
diagnostic of Kelley's La Junta focus, but recent
instrumental neutron activation analysis has demonstrated that Chupadero Black on While was
manufactured in central New Mexico and traded
widely throughout southern New Mexico, the
Southern Plains of Texas, and Trans-Pecos Texas
(Creel et al. 2002). The single sherd was found
within Test Unit N87/E102 at the Metate Site.
This unit was situated within a dark midden deposit, and the fragment was recovered in level 2,
approximately 10-20 cmbs.

Thirty-three ceramic sherds were recovered in
subsurface testing and surface collections at five
site localities. The ceramic assemblage is divided
into four types based on color, texture, and surface
treatment. Figure 22 displays representative specimens from each type.
Type 1 (n = 3; Figure 22, C) has a smooth and
slightly burnished surface texture, dark brownish red
in color. The interior is a similar color absent the
burnishing. In cross section, the paste is very dark
gray (charcoal colored) with very course temper
that is white in color. A tempering
agent is visible on the interior and
exterior surfaces as well, and there
are exterior markings or patterned
finishings that may be a product
of grass or stick rubbing or roughening. All sherds of this type were
found on the surface of the Windy
Spring Site, within or directly adjacent to the surface expression of
the primary midden.
Type 2 (n = 1; Figure 22, A)
has a grayish, red-brown, smooth
exterior surface. In cross section it
has a similar .color to the exterior
surface, with minor white colored
tempering agent. The burnished
interior surface is very dark gray.
This specimen is unique in that it
has distinctly different exterior and
interior surface coloration and
treatment. Both interior and exterior surfaces evince possible
smoothing with fingers or grasses
as attested by intersecting parallel
smudges. The single fragment representative of this category was
collected from the surface of the
Lost Pottery Site.

grained in texture. The interior

Type 4 (n = 28; Figure 22,B) is the most common ceramic type noted in the study area and has a
mostly grayish red-brown exterior, cross section and
interior color. The paste is mostly course with a few
white colored temper particles. No surface decoration is present, but smiace treatment can be seen in
the form of intersecting smudges possibly from
grasses or fingers. This last type has some minor
variation in color, but are all remarkably similar.
This type has distinct similarities to the cmde Chinati
Ware noted at localities along the Rio Grande corridor (Kelley et al. 1940:34) and was included in
Kelley's Concepcion phase. All sherds of this category were found on the surface of the Lost Pottery
Site within an approximately three m diameter area
and all likely come from the same vessel.

Cultural Features
From a review of the individual feature descriptions above, it is apparent that hearths are not
large or contain substantial quantities of burned
rock (with the exception of Feature 8 at the Gallie
Site). Hearth feature frequency and density is minimal at the Metate and Windy Springs localities,
while most of the hearths recorded are found at the
Perdiz Creek and Gallie sites. The Gallie Site contained 12 hearth features, and the majority, with the
exception of features 6 and 8, are largely disturbed
and do not contain a great number or volume of
stones. Most of these features consist of loose but
discrete clusters of five to 20 pieces of burned rock
that appear to be purely surface manifestations. The
majority of features at the Perdiz Creek location,
with the exception of Hearth Feature 1, are similarly not very substantial.
Many of these features have been significantly
disturbed over time by taphonomic processes such
as erosion and modern landscape modification. It is
plausible to assume that if these features had at one
time contained large quantities and volume of
burned rock, there would have been some evidence
of this in the area immediately surrounding the
hearth remnants. In contrast to comparative study
units, hearth features are relatively few and
unsubstantial in the Perdiz Creek landscape. Several
factors can account for this impression, such as: the
unsystematic sampling method, visibility, or
different food processing activities. These issues
will be visited further in subsequent discussion.
Five midden features were recorded in the
Perdiz Creek survey area. The feature recorded

at the Metate Site is a somewhat diffuse surface
expression with minimal mounding, visible
within an area measuring 10 m across. Its principle characteristics are very dark soil staining
and moderate to high densities of burned rock in
the intervening matrix, and the boundaries of
this feature are vague and amorphous. This same
description applies to the midden recorded and
tested at the Perdiz Creek Site. While neither of
these features is significantly mounded, each has
a substantial subsurface content in the form of
burned rock and heavily charcoal stained soil to
a depth of between 20 to 60 cmbs. Chipped stone
densities in these features are somewhat variable. Two sub-features (Hearth Fl and possible
roasting pit F2) were identified within the midden
deposit at the Metate Site. Two midden features
were identified at the Gallie Site locality, but
neither of these is very substantial in comparison to the midden features at other site localities. Each of these consist of medium to high
density burned rock scatters with minimal charcoal stained soil. Subsurface deposits within the
Gallie Site middens were unsubstantial compared
to other Perdiz Creek midden features.
The Windy Spring Site contains the most discrete midden, but its subsurface extent is limited by
the shallow depth of the deposit to bedrock (-10-20
cmbs). This feature has a somewhat amorphous
perimeter and is roughly 15 m across. While the
soil in the intervening soil matrix is distinctly stained
with charcoal, burned rock is not exceptionally
dense and does not dominate the cultural deposit.
No sub-features were identified within the general
midden deposit.

SUMMARY OF ARTIFACT
ASSOCIATIONS WITH FEATURES
IN SUBSURFACE CONTEXTS
As noted earlier, the majority of excavation
units in the Perdiz Creek study area were situated
within the surface expressions of subsistence related
features, including isolated hearths, burned rock
accumulations, and charcoal stained soil deposits.
Excavated hearths were, for the most part, discrete
and isolated features, with minimal amounts of
associated chipped stone debris. The larger burned
rock accumulations and midden features exhibited
very vague soil stratigraphy, where separate
occupations or events were difficult, if not

Cason-Prehistoric Archeological Investigations at Perdiz Creek 91
impossible, to identify with the extent of subsurface
testing employed during field school investigations.
Other than debitage, artifacts associated with the
larger features (excluding hearths) include modified
and utilized flakes, bifacial chipped stone tools,
projectile points, ceramic sherds, groundstone, and
bone fragments.
Excavation units within the midden feature at
the Windy Springs Site recovered 23 modified flake
specimens as deep as 30cmbs and one mano fragment was recovered from 20 cmbs. Nine bifaces
were recovered from the upper two 10 cm levels,
both early and late-stage reduction specimens. Nine
cores or core fragments were recovered from subsurface deposits within the midden feature. While
several ceramic fragments were noted on the surface of the midden expression, none were found in
a subsurface context. A total of six projectile points
and point fragments were recovered from subsurface contexts. Toyah and Livermore points were
recovered from 0 to 10 cmbs, which support the
Late Prehistoric radiocarbon assay from midden
soils. Three dart point fragments (one Palmillas,
one Shumla, and one unidentified fragment) were
recovered between 3 and 10 cmbs. These Late Archaic specimens are vertically interspersed with the
Late Prehistoric specimens and represent earlier occupation below the Late Prehistoric midden, displaced by activities associated with the feature. It
is, therefore, difficult to detennine whether the other
recovered artifacts, i.e. bifaces, debitage, modified
flakes, are actually associated with the Late Prehistoric midden activities.
Two test units were excavated in the large
midden feature at the Metate site. Two sub-features
were identified within the larger midden deposit,
consisting of a near surface hearth and a large
burned rock concentration that is postulated to be a
central roasting pit feature. No bifaces or modified
flakes were recovered from excavations centered
over the possible roasting pit. Three modified flakes
were recorded in excavations outside of the midden
feature. Four bifaces were recovered from the
general midden matrix in unit N87 /E98, and six
bi faces were recorded in unit N97IE101. Those
units are situated at, respectively, farther distances
from the central roasting pit feature (Unit N87 I
El02). Unmodified debitage occurs in increasing
frequency in excavation units that are farther from
the possible roasting pit feature. These observations
are at least suggestive of some significant intra site
variability, where tool manufacture, maintenance,

and processing activities are arranged around the
central pit feature. While the excavation sample
size is too small to draw meaningful conclusions, it
clearly suggests productive avenues for future
investigations.
No projectile points were found in association
with the Metate Site features. Of note is the single
Chupadero Black on White ceramic sherd recovered from 10-20 cmbs in the test unit centered over
the possible roasting pit (N87/E102). This specimen is a tradeware from central New Mexico. This
single artifact indicates that the groups who used
the Perdiz Creek landscape in their subsistence
rounds had some level of interaction with groups to
the north and northwest, as did the groups in the La
Junta district to the south.
At the Perdiz Creek site, there were no projectile points recovered from subsurface excavations.
Test Unit B was excavated inside the large midden
composed of burned rock and charcoal stained soil.
In this unit two early-stage biface fragments were
recovered in a subsurface context, along with six
modified flakes.
At the Gallie Site, several test units (1, 2, and
5) yielded artifacts other than unmodified chipped
stone. Recovery in Test Unit 1, excavated in an
ephemeral midden deposit, included seven pieces
of unmodified debitage, three cores, one biface,
one Livermore projectile point, and a single mano.
Test Unit 5 was likewise excavated in an ephemeral scatter of charcoal and burned rock. This test
unit recovered three pieces of modified debitage,
three core fragments, two early-stage bifaces, and a
single mano fragment. Test Unit 2 was excavated
in charcoal stained soil. This unit recovered one
core, and one biface fragment. As these test units
were not excavated within a discrete feature, it is
not possible to determine behavioral associations.

PERDIZ CREEK IN OVERVIEW
When the archeological manifestations within
the Perdiz Creek study area are considered in
overview, it is possible to sketch a general
impression of the nature of surface deposits and a
small sample of subsurface deposits. Generally,
within the 6,000-acre sample unit, we see four
locations that host clusters of subsistence related
burned rock features. These take the form of mostly
small, unsubstantial hearths and midden deposits.
Most hearths consist of relatively loose clusters of

92

Texas Archeological Society

burned rock. The midden features (n = five) are
formed of charcoal stained soils with moderate
amounts of burned rock in the intervening soil
matrix. These midden features are considered to
be unsubstantial and incipient, i.e. "just coming
into being, and not fully formed." Radiocarbon
dates (n = six) for the incipient midden features
and hearths all fall within a Late Prehistoric to
Proto-Historic time period (see Table 1).
Chipped stone technologies evident at site locations are not exceptionally diverse, consisting overwhelmingly of unmodified debitage (n = 3,762 from
excavation units), simple modified flakes, few formalized tools, and a small number of projectile points.
Formalized scrapers, spoke shaves, perforators, d1ills,
pecking stones, hammer stones, metates, figurines,
shell, and other decorative items indicative of more
diverse activities are absent from the Perdiz Creek
artifact assemblages in subsurface contexts. Recovered diagnostic artifacts are indicative of Late Archaic and Late Prehistoric use of the sites.
Groundstone specimens, though present, are sparse
(n =four) from excavation units, 10 recorded in field
notes). The specimens are formed mostly of locally
available materials. Bedrock mortars, while present
in the project area (n = eight), are not abundant.
Ceramic sherds (n = 33) are dominated by a single
type (Chinati Plainware), with the exception of a
single decorated Chupadero Black on White specimen, likely traded and imported from neighboring
peoples to the north and northwest. The ceramic
sherd assemblage likely came from a small number
of vessels, indicating that ceramic technologies were
not used heavily within the area or in association
with features recorded in the sample area.
No evidence of structures or habitation was noted
within the Perdiz Creek landscape unit. A single
Cielo complex structure was found adjacent to the
southern boundary of the study area, but no sites
with these characteristic structures were noted in the
survey areas. In general, habitation structures such
as stacked stone wicki-up rings, pit houses, or jacal
structures are not known in the actual project area,
and are not known to occur in any abundance in
nearby areas.

COMPARATIVE STUDY AREAS
AND LANDSCAPE UNITS
Archeological data, information concerning the
material remains of past human behavior, are usefully

considered within a larger context. In the same sense
that a projectile point can offer little information
without provenience, the archeological data of Perdiz
Creek can be better understood when viewed in
relation to comparative observation units. The goal
of this section is to introduce a comparative study
area with a description of the nature of burned rock
features present there, and to compare their
distributions to the evidence previously presented
for Perdiz Creek. Observations at each of these
locations is course-grained, in that reconnaissance
level recording was focused on high visibility
archeological material, mostly surface expressions
of large burned rock features.
In Gilliland Canyon, archeological data were
collected according to different methods, varying
in systematic survey coverage and descriptions.
While this is certainly not an optimal situation for
comparison, the available data are probably representative and serve as an excellent departure point
for understanding behavioral variability between
different landscapes

Comparative Unit Environment:
Gilliland Canyon
The comparative study area is within the Glass
Mountains, approximately 69 km east-northeast of
the Perdiz Creek study area. The Gilliland Canyon
study area, privately owned by Mr. Homer Mills
and Jim and Carol Dakus, is named after the prominent geographical feature in the unit. The study
area is situated in a rugged mountain range formed
mostly of fault blocked limestone deposits. Elevations range between 5,791 and 4,300 feet, and the
research unit is superimposed upon a central drainage, Gilliland Creek, and the linear ridges that flank
its west and east sides. The canyon sides are steep
and the drainage assumes a position in the mountain range making it a somewhat ideal causeway
between the Marathon Basin to the south and the
Toyah Creek drainage basin and grasslands to the
north. A smaller portion of this study area occupies
an ancillary drainage basin, Jail Canyon, immediately adjoining Gilliland Canyon from the west.
The Gilliland Canyon study area lies within a
setting distinctly different than Perdiz Creek, and
can be described as the northeastern boundary of
the Trans-Pecos. Beyond the Glass Mountains, to
the east, are the distinct physiological characteristics of the Stockton Plateau. The Glass Mountains
are also adjacent to the Monahan Sand Dunes to the

Cason-Prehistoric Archeological Investigations at Perdiz Creek 93
north, and the Toyah Creek basin and grasslands to
the east and north. The surrounding plant community contrasts with Perdiz Creek, being dominated
by a madrean woodland and sotol scrub community. While Gilliland Canyon does not have the immediate access to major biomes and ecological settings as does Perdiz Creek, a greater small-scale
diversity of resources are present within the unit.
The steep slopes of the canyon walls host dense
stands of sotol, a resource that has been documented
ethnographically as an important food and fiber
source. The margins of the canyon floor contain
stands of emory and live oaks intermixed with stands
of juniper (Warnock 1946, 1977). All these tree species have reproductive biomass, acorns and berries,
recognized in archeological and ethnographic documentation as important resources (Creel 1994;
Niethammer 1974). Mesquite likewise is a common
food source, but its abundance may be a product of
modern conditions, including range land modification and livestock grazing. Vegetation density is generally higher in the Glass Mountains, with more
above-ground structural biomass, as compared to the
dominance of grasses and subsurface plant components found in the Perdiz Creek setting.
Initial investigations in Gilliland Canyon began
with a 1998 Sul Ross State University archeological
field school, directed by Robert J. Mallouf. Activities focused on the test excavation of a large, partially buried burned rock midden eroding from a
terrace fronting on Jail Canyon, a tributary to
Gilliland Canyon (Mallouf n.d.). In 2000, the Center
for Big Bend Studies conducted a reconnaissance
over approximately 9000 acres of the study area.
Twenty-three sites were recorded by this author, who
visited midden features and recorded site localities
using pedestrian survey techniques. Each of these
sites is centered on high visibility features that typically consist of large, mounded burned rock middens.

Gilliland Canyon Feature
Distributions
A total of 106 hearth features and 29 burned
rock middens were recorded at 23 sites (Table 7).
These features are located mostly on the main stem
terraces of Gilliland Creek and its tributary drainages. Two localities were recorded high above the
drainage floor, one on an elevated bench, and another in a saddle above the main drainage. Hearth
features range from small, loose clusters of a few
stones, to large pavement or mounded style hearths

up to 3 m in diameter. A simple classification of
these hearths consists of small clustered variety
(small hearths) and large substantial features (large
hearths). These two varieties subsume a significant
amount of diversity, but the classification is useful
here for course-grained comparisons. The small
hearth varieties range from tight clusters of five to
40 stones, often significantly displaced and having
vague or amorphous boundaries. The large hearth
varieties are mostly over 1.0 m in diameter, formed
of 50 to 400+ stones, tightly packed, often displaying a pavement or mounded shape, and sometimes
numerous courses deep. These features are often
substantial and well defined, and they occasionally
have intact stained soil and charcoal chunks under
the stones and in the intervening soil. Of the total
number of hearths (n = 106), 68 are small, while 38
are large. Hearths are frequently in close proximity
to burned rock midden features.
The 29 midden features display significant morphological diversity. Four general classifications are
defined here to facilitate course-grained comparisons.
Mounded middens are very high-density clusters of
burned rock, where stones mostly dominate the
feature's matrix deposit. These middens are by definition numerous courses thick and mounded above
the s1mounding landform surface. Within this class
of midden feature are further morphological differences. These features are sometimes domed, round or
oval, displaying a significant degree of symmetry,
while at other times they are irregularly shaped with
stepped levels of mounding, some with a shallow
central depression on the crest of the dome. This last
characteristic is fairly common, where the central
depression is filled with dark, charcoal stained soil
and burned rock relatively lighter in density. The
overall morphology is mounded rather than ring-like.
These mounded middens range in size from 3 to 17 m
in diameter, and are mounded 30-100 cm above the
surrounding surfaces. Eighteen of these features were
recorded in the study area.
The second class of midden feature is termed a
ring midden, denoted for its characteristic ring
shape, mostly a circular, low mound of burned rock
where the central portion is mostly free of stones.
The single ring type midden located in the Gilliland
Canyon study area is a small mound, - 3 m in
diameter, mounded -30 cm above the surrounding
surface. Elsewhere in the Trans-Pecos, these
middens show significant morphological diversity.
The third class of midden feature is a crescent
midden, similar to the ring midden but displaying

only a portion of the perimeter mound of burned
rock. One of these features was recorded in the
Gilliland Canyon study area.
The fourth midden type is termed an incipient
midden which in most cases has very weak or ambiguous morphology. These features are differentiated from the other midden types by their relatively
smaller number and density of stones. These burned
rock features are rarely mounded and are often represented by a high density cluster of FCR on the ground
surface, where soil rather than stone dominates the
smTounding matrix. Often there is some degree of
charcoal staining in the surrounding soils. Nine of
these features were recorded in the study area.
The overall picture that emerges from archeological reconnaissance in the Gilliland Canyon study
area is considerably different from that of Perdiz
Creek. There is a relatively high number of more
robust subsistence related features in the Gilliland
Canyon unit. These are generally more intact and
contain higher amounts of burned rock and charcoal stained soil matrix. While midden features are
quite numerous in this area, hearth features also
occur in higher frequency, and a higher number of
these hearth features are of the large size class.
The formational process of middens in Gilliland
Canyon is still unclear. It has not yet been determined if these large features are the product of
repeated use over several seasons, several generations, or several thousands of years. The degree of
morphological diversity between these middens may
indicate different functions and likely different
methods of processing a variety of resources. Future investigations, with the aid of radiocarbon assays, might determine that morphological variability is a product of changes in food processing methods developed over time, i.e. temporal variability.
While it can be safely assumed that we know very
little concerning how these features relate to changing subsistence strategies, the unique archeological
signature left by the distributions of these features
is a good starting place, especially when compared
between different environments.
COMPARATIVE ANALYSIS
BETWEEN STUDY AREAS

Subsistence Features and Hunter
Gatherer Behavior
The term "burned rock midden" used here encompasses a substantial variety of features.

Archeologically, they are viewed as high density
concentrations of thermally altered stone. They are
typically made up of a course fraction mat1ix, composed of cobbles or small boulders, as well as a fine
fraction matrix, with soil filling the voids between
course fraction elastics. The fine fraction matrix commonly includes varying amounts of carbon, chunks
of charcoal, and ash (Collins 1994). The content of
midden deposits includes artifacts, (chipped and
grounds tone, ceramics), micro and macro floral debris, and micro and macro faunal material.
A burned rock midden (BRM) is here differentiated from other cultural features in a qualitative
and subjective fashion. It is different from a burned
rock scatter in that a midden has more discrete
boundaries, has a much higher frequency and density of thermally altered stone, and has a distinctive
carbon stained fine fraction matrix. BRMs are discerned from stone hearths in their aerial extent,
density of matrix material, and the assumption that
a midden feature represents a higher intensity and
more industrious activity.
Collins (1994) provides a useful overview of
BRMs. A distinction is drawn between the general
class of BRMs, which include the sub-classes of
mounded BRM and annular BRM. The mounded
form is a distinct morphological feature found mostly
in Central Texas, but also in portions of the southern
Trans-Pecos region. Annular middens have their own
characteristic distribution, being much wider over
portions of western Texas, northern Mexico, and
portions of the lower Southwest. Prewitt (1981) notes
a correlation between archeological time frames specific to each midden type. The mounded forms have
been dated to as early as the Middle Archaic of
Texas from 5000-2500 B.P. The annular forms have
a later time distribution, between 2500 B.P. up to the
historic period. While these date ranges provide a
rough framework for the development of midden
features, later observations suggest that these dates
are somewhat in question (Black et al. 1997; Mallouf,
personal communication 2004), where it seems that
the annular forms of burned rock middens may date
between ca. A.D. 800-1200.
The function and acreational history of the
mounded variety of BRMs has been subject to a
high degree of speculation. Explanations include:
1) they are the refuse pile and secondary dump
locations for the byproducts created by other burned
rock features, such as the cleaning out of hearth
basins; 2) they are the result of multiple and overlapping hearth construction in a confined space, so

96

Texas Archeological Society

that burned rock naturally accumulates over time as
consecutive hearths are constructed in the same
location; 3) they are the product of a specific subsistence activity, such as the bulk processing of a
vegetable resource in earth ovens; 4) they are the
product of a specific activity performed repeatedly
in a single location, such as the repeated use of a
mounded BRM for the construction of successive
earth ovens. Morphological studies made through
excavations suggest that several of these explanations may be needed to explain the mounded BRM
phenomenon. In some cases, hearths are discernable
within the midden matrix, while in others slab lined
features are found to be the central sub-feature
within the midden. Creel (1994) notes the correspondence of the mounded BRM variety with contemporary distributions of oak in central Texas,
attributing this correspondence to the processing of
acorns as a major food source. There is a further
correspondence of these features with geologic exposure oflimestone on the Edward's Plateau, and it
is hypothesized that limestone aids the leaching of
tannin from acorns, making them palatable and digestible for humans. The western distribution of
the mounded middens overlaps with eastern distribution of annular middens (their relationship to sotol and agave sp. is discussed below). Prehistoric
distribution of oak, sotol, and agave in this area is
subject to some debate (Creel 1994), making a direct functional relationship between mounded
middens and oak tenuous.
Greer (1964) deals with variations on the annular midden or midden circle, and mescal pits. He
observes that, generally, different forms are found
associated with different geographic and geological
contexts. He distinguishes between midden circles,
which are entirely above ground, and mescal pits,
which have an above-ground burned rock deposit
associated with an excavated, subsurface pit or depression. Type I includes both large, steep walled
middens with pronounced central depressions, and
smaller, slightly mounded variety where the central
depression is filled with an ashy, charcoal stained
soil matrix.
Mescal pits, referred to as earth ovens, are
excavated depressions associated with burned rock
debris, the latter often forming the ring or crescent
midden described by Greer (1964) and others.
Ethnographic accounts describe the use of mescal
pits in the greater Southwest, western Texas, northern
Mexico, and southwestern Arizona (Castetter and
Opler 1936). This technology is applied today in

northern Mexico to prepare sotol bulbs for production
of alcoholic beverages (Niethammer 1974). Greer
(1964) notes a variety of mescal pits ranging from
shallow depressions to steep walled depressions that
are lined with stone slabs. Occasionally, these pits
are found in association with a heavy accumulation
of stone debris, and sometimes none at all.
Greer (1964) provides a useful overview of
ethnographic and ethnohistoric accounts of the use
of earth ovens and mescal pits. It is important to
note that many of these observations are from western Texas, adjoining northern Mexico, New Mexico,
and Arizona. Many groups using this technology,
including Mescalero Apache and Lipan Apache,
are known from ethnohistoric accounts to have inhabited the Trans-Pecos region. These features and
food preparation activities are mentioned in a
plethora of ethnographic accounts, a summary
(based on the information in Greer [ 1964]) of which
is provided below.
The principal resource processed in these accounts is sotol (sp) and maguey (agave). The hearts
of sotol and the tubers of the maguey plant are
gathered en mass by foraging parties that range far
afield, depending on the local abundance of the
resource. Hearts and tubers are brought to a central
location where the earth oven pit is excavated. The
pits, as noted earlier, range in size from a shallow
depression to a pit up to a meter deep and two
meters across. These larger pits undoubtedly involve a great deal of labor. A fire is kindled inside
the pit, then overlain by stones that are heated. This
process alone may take the greater part of a day.
Once the fire has burned down, the tubers and sotol
hearts are arranged in the pit, over the rocks, and
covered completely with soil. The oven is left to sit
and bake for up to two days. The roots and hearts
are then removed and are further processed in the
same location. To make drink, the sotol hearts are
pounded and pulverized in mortars while water is
added, and the liquid is subsequently drained from
the vegetable debris. For foodstuffs, hearts and roots
are ground and pulverized into a flour like substance from which cakes are made.
The overall picture of this process suggests a
very labor-intensive activity, which can take more
than three days to carry out. Furthermore, these
activities resemble a central place model involving:
logistical forays of variable length, performing
simple gathering activities, then congregating at a
central place where resources are processed. The
activities that produced midden features undoubt-

Cason-Prehistoric Archeological Investigations at Perdiz Creek 97
edly varied significantly in the expenditure of time
and energy.
When we consider midden features at Perdiz
Creek, it is apparent that they do not resemble any of
the distinct burned rock midden types described by
Greer (1964 ), as they lack the well defined morphological characteristics, such as mounding, central depressions, crescent, or ring shaped perimeter. Rather,
these features are incipient and not robust. Comparatively, they have a small volume of burned rock and
their morphology is generally weak. Based on background knowledge discussed in previous sections,
several possibilities exist concerning their formational history: 1) these features are the palimpsest
accretion of several hearths that have been deflated
and their matrices commingled; or, 2) midden deposits represent a mass processing event, necessitating energy and activities beyond the scope of typical
hearth construction, possibly the parching of a large
number of mesquite beans, succulent parts, tubers,
or a combination of several of these. The second
hypothesis will be used for comparative processes,
supported by the generally homogeneous matrix deposits and the lack of discrete hearth features found
within the Perdiz Creek midden deposits.
The majority of features recorded in Gilliland
Canyon, though variable, have the overall characteristics of the mounded burned rock middens
described by Greer. However, it is likely that further
investigations and excavations will indicate that
these features are center-focused middens, more
similar to annular or ring middens (Black et al.
1997:284). They have a considerably higher volume
of burned rock in comparison to the Perdiz Creek
features. The formational history behind these
middens is likewise not well understood. Features
may represent a single, very intensive processing
event or closely spaced seasonal events. It is also
possible that the extensive midden deposits are the
product of multi-generational use, massive
accretions of burned rock over an extended time
period. While further investigations are needed to
answer these questions, the single event or closely
spaced event possibility is assumed here, minimally
supported by the strong morphology and structural
integrity of many of these features.
In Perdiz Creek we see relatively few high
visibility features and all are incipient in nature.
When the number of acres surveyed is considered
(9,000 for Perdiz Creek and 6,000 for Gilliland
Canyon), the number of hearth and midden features
(n = 19 and n = 5 respectively) in Perdiz Creek is

significantly less than the number of like features
in Gilliland Canyon (n = 106 and n = 29 respectively). Similarly, the features in Gilliland Canyon
are more substantial and have considerably higher
visibility on the landscape. The middens and the
large hearths in Gilliland Canyon are extremely
suggestive of redundant land use and repeated, centrally focused activities. One plausible explanation
is that mobility patterns in Perdiz Creek, in contrast
to Gilliland Canyon, were of a nature that residential moves were more frequent and logistical forays
were shorter. It follows that in Gilliland Canyon,
residential occupations were longer in duration and
seasonally reoccurring, and logistical forays were
longer. Alternatively, it is possible that the incipient features in the Perdiz Creek study area represent specialized logistical localities, where resources
were processed, then transported to a central, more
long-term residential camp.
It may be useful to speculate that group sizes
differed between landscape units as well, where
foraging parties and residential units in the Perdiz
Creek landscape were smaller to facilitate more
frequent movements, and more dispersed in order
to make more efficient use of the more thinly distributed resources. Given the proximity of these
different landscape units in the Southern TransPecos, it is possible that groups engaging in different subsistence and mobility strategies in different
areas could at some point have been part of larger
sociocultural units. Undoubtedly, different landscapes played different roles in the subsistence strategies of prehistoric peoples in the region. Smaller
groups making use of the Perdiz Creek landscape
could have seasonally merged with one another, or
groups from other areas, to form larger units utilizing the Gilliland Canyon area at some point in their
movements within the region.
It is important to note that both the Perdiz Creek
and Gilliland Canyon study areas have been surface collected extensively in recent times. Collections from both these areas contain a wide variety
of artifacts, including projectile point styles indicating a deep history of land use and occupation.
While small dart points and Late Prehistoric arrow
points dominate the assemblages collected in systematic excavation and site recording, surface collections contain projectile point styles indicative of
late Paleoindian and Early Archaic occupations as
well. Furthermore, surface collections contain a
wide variety of chipped stone tools, including drills,
perforators, formalized scrapers, spoke shaves,

98

Texas Archeological Society

bifaces, a variety of groundstone, and ceramics.
While these artifacts are indicative of diverse activities, it is not possible to associate them directly
with any of the feature assemblages examined in
this investigation.
If we can accept the simplified expectations discussed in the introduction as a working hypothesis,
we can search for forms of supporting evidence,
ideally independent of the distribution of high visibility features in the two study areas. Elaborating on
the mobility hypothesis used here, how might other
aspects of archeological assemblages, on a landscape
level, be expected to vary according to different mobility patterns? This study hypothesizes that localities used for extended periods should produce evidence of a greater diversity of activities, including
tool maintenance, processing of different resources,
methods of storage, and construction of habitation
structures. It is assumed that persistent environmental properties would have conditioned human behavior in similar ways over time. This case may be true
of the Late Prehistoric period encompassed by radiocarbon dates recovered from the features in the Perdiz
Creek study area. Given these suppositions, we
should expect to see some degree of consistency in
human land use in the archeological record of the
Perdiz Creek landscape. Finally, working with the
proposed mobility hypothesis, we should expect that
Perdiz Creek material should reflect a smaller diversity of cumulative activities in comparison to landscapes with higher redundancy use.
Small scale and fine-grained information is likely
the most useful in this regard. Unfortunately, at a
landscape scale sample, this information is available
only for Perdiz Creek. Reviewing the inventory
analysis, it is apparent that there is a seemingly low
diversity of artifact classifications, a low percentage
of prepared platforms, and a small number and variety of groundstone implements. Feature types outside of midden deposits are likewise low in number
and display little variability (though this last observation is based on a purely subjective overall impression). While this appears to weakly support the
mobility hypothesis posited above, comparative
samples of subsurface artifact inventories would be
needed to make more meaningful observations.
A definitive explanation of this postulated behavioral diversity cannot be achieved at this stage,
but it is useful to speculate in order to formulate
future hypotheses. The Dobe !Kung example cited
above is a good modern example of intra-group behavioral diversity, especially with regards to mobil-

ity strategy (Lee 1984, Yellen 1977). There we see
the importance of several key-conditioning properties, namely the seasonal availability of resources.
We could expect that during times and at places
where resources are abundant, plentiful, and predictable, we could expect to find more redundant land
use and centrally focused activities. This is certainly
true of dry season !Kung camps where activities are
tethered to large water holes. A similar scenario could
be expected at wet season camps in the northern
!Kung district. While not as severely tethered to
water resources as during the dry season, mongongo
nut groves present a somewhat predictable and abundant resource, which likely restricts movements
(lower mobility) when compared to dry season foraging trips or hunting expeditions, when resources
are not nearly as abundant or predictable.
This scenario presents one with expectations
for the archeological record in the southern TransPecos. Very generally, we might expect repeated
and redundant land use in landscapes where resources are more predictable and more abundant.
Such a pattern would be a product of longer duration occupation. We could further expect these areas to have a higher diversity of activities and that
the cumulative deposition from these activities will
result in higher visibility archeological remains.
The feature assemblage in the Gilliland Canyon study area has been observed to be more diverse and of greater visibility than the Perdiz Creek
area. Likewise, there is a greater floral diversity in
the Glass Mountain landscape, along with a greater
number of vegetable resources. Succulents, namely
agave and sotol, are more abundant in the Glass
Mountains and are not seasonally dependant in their
harvesting for subsistence uses. In comparison, the
Perdiz Creek study area has a smaller variety of
major vegetable staples. If modern conditions are
analogous to prehistoric conditions, the principle
resources would likely have been mesquite beans
(which are seasonally dependant on their harvest
and yield) and game in the neighboring semidesert
grassland (which comprise highly mobile and less
predictable resources).
Another contributing factor to the dispersal and
concentration of subsistence related activities, particularly processing of resources, could be the "lay
of the land" or the physiographical setting of the
different study areas. Put simply, Gilliland Canyon,
because of its high topographical relief, offers a
smaller space for use in the processing of subsistence staples. Activities would need to be focused

Cason-Prehistoric Archeological Investigations at Perdiz Creek 99
in a smaller area, namely on the narrow and limited
alluvial benches at the base of the steep canyon
walls. In contrast, the Perdiz Creek topography is
marked by less topographic relief, facilitating more
diffuse activities.

CONCLUSIONS AND FURTHER
RESEARCH
Comparing the archeological evidence between
Perdiz Creek and Gilliland Canyon study areas
shows differences in the nature and distribution of
high visibility subsistence related features. This is
most evident in the frequency and distribution of
hearth and midden features. The Perdiz Creek study
area is characterized by few and relatively unsubstantial hearth and midden features. Gilliland Canyon displays a greater frequency and morphological diversity of features, which are notably more
robust and substantial than the Perdiz Creek feature
assemblage. Prior knowledge based on observations of modern hunter-gatherer groups makes it
possible to hypothesize differences in mobility patterns practiced at these different locations. It is
postulated that the more robust features present in
Gilliland Canyon are the result of relatively longer
residential events and a higher redundancy of land
use and resource extraction. Subsistence activities
at Perdiz Creek appear to have been more dispersed,
where movements consisted of farther ranging logistical forays, pursuing less predictable resources.
Tentative explanations for the apparent behavioral
diversity are based on the nature and distiibutions
of resources in each of the different study areas,
principally the abundance, diversity, and predictability of key subsistence staples.
In order to better understand how the Perdiz
Creek and Gilliland Canyon feature assemblages relate to behavioral diversity across the Southern TransPecos region, greater chronometric control and further data sets are needed. These include standardized
data collection of feature assemblages at a larger,
landscape scale, as well as the documentation of
environmental attributes. Furthermore, much can
be learned concerning properties that condition behavioral diversity from modern hunter-gatherer
groups. While the present study begins to address
some issues of behavioral diversity in the Southern
Trans-Pecos, different scales of observation are
needed to improve our understanding of the region,
and human behavior in general.

Survey and test excavations in the Perdiz Creek
study area provided preliminary archeological data
for a landscape in the southern Trans-Pecos that
has not previously been addressed. To date, most
archeological investigations have taken place in the
southern sector, mainly along the Rio Grande corridor, in the La Junta district, in the mountains and
bajadas surrounding Big Bend National Park, in
Green Valley within the central volcanic mountain
ranges of the region, within the Glass Mountains
adjacent to the Stockton Plateau, as well as a smattering of small scale investigations at select localities across the region. Investigations at Perdiz Creek
add to our understanding of archeological variability between different geographical settings in the
Southern Trans-Pecos.
From the sample of features there emerges an
image of the landscape use of the Perdiz Creek
drainage, specifically within a Late Prehistoric
timeframe. Excavations at these locations suggest
that these features are not the product of long term,
repeated use, but rather, the result of single or relatively short-term activities. Clearly, further excavations are needed to make more substantive observations concerning the nature of these features. Small
block excavations could yield morphological data
useful in understanding the formational history of
burned rock and charcoal stained soil accumulations. Further studies may be able to discern morphological diversity between roughly contemporaneous features within the study area.
Further investigations could yield useful comparative information concerning artifact/tool diversity as a measure of the diversity of activities associated with the use of midden features. Excavations
outside of midden features may be more instructive
concerning types of activities associated with the
features themselves. While the sample size is small,
excavations at the Metate Site indicate that, between
the midden feature deposits and surrounding deposits (outside of these features), there are drastic differences in the frequency of artifacts and tools types.
A comparison of the Perdiz Creek and Gilliland
Canyon study areas has demonstrated significant
environmental and archeological variability, with
some important implications concerning behavioral
diversity within the southern Trans-Pecos region.
Considering the minimal amount of chronometric
control, this regional approach appears somewhat
a-temporal in nature. Overall, radiometric dates and
feature morphology address a very broad time period, namely the Late Prehistoric period. Further

100

Texas Archeological Society

questions should address in more detail the relationship between the two study areas.
While the southern Trans-Pecos region is ex pansive, it is likely that a single group could have
practiced a variety of mobility strategies in different environmental contexts. Still, the notion of a
"group" is ambiguous at best. Some similarities in
technological attributes (diagnostic artifacts and feature types) suggest some continuity of landscape
use at the level of the "phase." This is suggested by
the ubiquitous presence of Late Prehistoric Perdiz
and Toyah arrow points found across the region, as
well as a plethora of Late Archaic dart point types.
Common feature types found across the region also
suggest shared technologies. Certainly, a cultural
taxonomic unit such as a phase covers a broad time
period and subsumes smaller "group" units. It is
tempting to envision that a single group included
the Perdiz Creek area in their subsistence rounds,
then perhaps combined with other groups in the
Glass Mountains, changing their mobility strategy
to more efficiently exploit resources in a different
ecological setting.
This is a perplexing proposition. The !Kung
example demonstrates the fluidity of group constituency, from large dry season communities to
smaller family household units in wet season camps.
Even family units can be fluid as relationships
change and are redefined. Furthermore, these relationships seem nearly impossible to identify in the
archeological record.
For these reasons, it is proposed that future investigations include a larger scale approach, a landscape level approach, in investigating the relationships between different environmental settings. What
is needed most is some degree of chronological control in order to identify roughly contempcraneous
mobility strategies. This entails the acquisition of
numerous radiocarbon dates of different types of
features in contrasting landscape settings. In this way
questions would address not how a specific group
utilized different mobility strategies, but rather, what
roles different landscapes played in the overall subsistence system of populations in the Trans-Pecos
region. Thus, investigations could prosper from
macrb geographical inquiry, rather than relying
heavily on cultural taxonomic questions.
Examining the archeological evidence firsthand,
then attempting to explain the behavior that produced that evidence can be considered a kind of
bottom up approach to the explanation of prehistoric behavior. A number of factors make this a

complicated and potentially dubious approach. The
first is that taphonomic processes make archeological remains very difficult to explain and ascribe
behavioral causal agents to observed patterns. In
the case of this comparative analysis, it is not clear
specifically what kind of behavior and post depositional processes produced the features in question.
Second, there is a dangerous risk of circular reasoning where evidence is interpreted in order to support a premature conclusion. A top down approach
would ideally involve the construction of a model
based on prior knowledge, where one generates
expectations of human behavior given certain conditions, then testing how the archeological data supports or refutes those expectations. As this project
is based principally on the presentation of archeological material evidence, collected a priori, a bottom-up approach has served as the principle tool of
data interpretation.
It is tempting to envision the apparent mobility
patterns at Perdiz Creek and Gilliland Canyon superimposed onto a larger scale scheme of the southern Trans-Pecos region. When it becomes possible
to determine the ages of different features, it will be
exciting to compare different landscape patterns,
specifically to the area along the Rio Grande corridor in the vicinity of the La Junta District. In this
region we see different types of features not addressed in Perdiz Creek or Gilliland Canyon due to
their complete absence. These features include semisubterranean pit houses, jacal and adobe structural
remnants, and in the Cielo complex, stacked stone
structural remnants. Many of these features have
associated radiocarbon dates and a wealth of data
concerning associated tool assemblages, many of
which may elucidate changes in mobility strategies
in different landscape settings.
A top down approach in the southern TransPecos, particularly at a landscape scale, would
seek to investigate what environmental properties
may condition mobility strategies of populations
in different environmental contexts. While
variables such as effective temperature and primary
biomass appear to be useful properties in
understanding large scale, inter-group variability,
it is likely that different properties are needed to
explain smaller scale, intra-group behavioral
diversity at the scale of the landscape.
Profitable research could entail an in-depth
survey of ethnographic literature in an effort to
understand how modern intra-group mobility
changes in relation to different environmental

properties. This could be achieved by documenting environmental variables within areas known
ethnographically to host specific kinds of mobility
patterns. Useful properties might include topographic relief, plant community, the structure of
adjoining ecological communities, trophic structures, and proximity to different resources including information and social resources. Conditioning relationships at this scale are poorly understood, and any advances in this area would not
only advance understanding of the southern TransPecos, but human behavior in general.

Remembering Thomas N. Campbell
By Dee Ann Story

There is much to be remembered about Dr.
Thomas Nolan Campbell, who passed away on October 15, 2003 in Austin, at the august age of 95.
His daughter T. J. and numerous friends, many of
whom are former students, survive him. Tom had a
long, very productive career, distinguishing himself as teacher, archeologist, ethnohistorian, editor,
and administrator. He was a finely balanced man
who combined a critical eye, integrity, and high
level of scholarship with modesty, humor, and unselfish regard for the welfare of others.
Tom was born in Munday, Texas, and spent
most of the first two decades of his life in north
Texas. He stood out early, graduating in 1925 as
valedictorian of the town's one high school, an
honor he often humorously dismissed (like others
he was to receive) by pointing out that there had
been only 19 students in his graduating class. After
two years at McMurry College in Abilene, where
he had majored in English and French, Tom depaited for Austin to continue his English studies at
The University of Texas. It is here that he found
anthropology and an institution that would become
his professional home for over 50 years.
Tom's university studies were self-funded and
consequently often interrupted by the need to earn
money. He received a BA degree in anthropology
in 1930, just as the Great Depression deepened
and jobs became extremely difficult to find. Very
short of funds, he returned to north Texas to teach
English, typing, bookkeeping, and even mathematics in high school. His first job took him to Snyder,
Texas, where he was paid in scrip, then on to
Albany where his degree from a respected institution enabled him to earn real money. Finally solvent, Tom came back to UT in 1934 to work on a
master's degree in anthropology. Still he had to
support his studies with a sundry of jobs that included teaching assistant, WPA pot-mender, student
registrar, and guide to a special Texas Centennial
exhibit. He completed his thesis, entitled, "A Study

of Ornamentation in The Pottery of Prehistoric East
Texas, with Special Attention Given to Designs,"
in 1936. That same year he was awarded a tuition
scholarship to Harvard University. Again his studies were interrupted, first by the lingering Depression and the need to return to UT to teach, then by
World War II. Nonetheless, Tom received from
Harvard a second Masters Degree (1940), married
Austinite Lorene Gregg (June 1940), and, following four years (1942-1946) in the Air Corps, earned
a Harvard Ph.D. (1947). Based on mostly investigations carried out by others, his dissertation was a
scholarly synthesis of coastal archeology and its
possible relations to Mexico and the Lower Mississippi Valley. While some individual sections
(namely, reports on the Caplen, Johnson, Kent
Crane, and Live Oak Peninsula sites) were later
published, the bulk of the dissertation, including a
very useful review of previous research, unfortunately stayed buried at Harvard.
In 1947 Tom came back to Austin and the UT
anthropology department, where almost every
weekday until the mid- l 990s he could be found
working in his office. Except in later years when he
would take a brief nap after lunch, his door was
always open and the welcome warm for students,
colleagues, and friends. His routine did not greatly
change after his retirement and appointment as
Professor Emeritus in 1978. He was a workhorse in
the department, serving as chairman between 1947
and 1962 and director of Research in Anthropology
between 1947 and 1966, without relief from
teaching duties. He offered a variety of courses,
and supervised numerous graduate students. I
enjoyed and greatly benefited from the ones I took:
Texas Indians, North American Archeology,
Primitive Arts and Crafts, Advanced Physical
Anthropology, a summer field school (at the Kincaid
site), and two graduate seminars in archeology. He
was a commanding and stimulating presence in the
classroom. He was articulate, up-to-date, and quick

Texas Archeological Society

to add humor to his lectures. Not one to waste
paper, the blank pages of the unclaimed blue books
used in final exams became Tom's favorite writing
pads. He was also well known for using a pencil
until it was so short it could no longer be held.
In addition to his many faceted roles in the
department, Tom found time to be active in a number of professional organizations. He was a charter
member of the Society for American Archaeology
(1939) and the editor of its journal, American Antiquity (1962-66); served as an editorial council
member of the American Anthropological Association (1962-66); was secretary of the Anthropology
Section of the American Association for the Advancement of Science (1941); was vice president
(1952 and 1965) and journal editor (1953-56) for
the Texas Academy of Science; was elected a member of the Sociedad Mexicana de Antropologia
(1963) and the New York Academy of Sciences
(1964); and was made an honorary life member of
the Texas Academy of Science (1957).
Tom joined the Texas Archeological Society
in 1938 and became a fellow in 1962. He served
the Society as a Regional Vice President (194748, 1952-56), Editor (1958-61), Vice-President
(1963) and President (1964) and contributed a
number of articles to the Bulletin. Tom and the
late Curry Holden are the only persons to have
been a member of the Texas Archeological Society for 65 years. Interestingly, Tom had a history
course from Curry Holden at McMurry College.
Then, while working on his doctorate at UT, Curry
hired Tom who was an expert typist (and equally
proficient at shorthand) to type copies of selected
documents in the Texas State Archives. These
clerical skills, which served Tom well on many
occasions, were learned when as a high school
student he received a tuition scholarship to a newly
started Munday business college.
Author of numerous publications, Tom is best
known to many people as a researcher. Other than
work at Awatovi Pueblo in Arizona (1937) and
brief reconnaissances in northeast Mexico (1947)
and western Oklahoma (1975), his field archeological experiences were in Texas. As a student
he worked for J.E. Pearce at a number of central
Texas sites in the early to mid-1930s, then with
Walter Goldschmidt in east Texas (most notably at
the Keith Mound), and in 1938-39 with J. Charles
Kelley and Donald Lehmer on a Harvard funded
milestone study of the archeology of the Big Bend.
After returning to UT in 1947, he undertook several

excavations as field schools. These include the
Mustang Lake shell midden in Calhourn County, a
huge burned rock midden in central Texas (the
McClure Mound) in Williamson County, and the
Kincaid Shelter in Uvalde County. He would also
take students on day field trips, which on one
occasion caught Tom and the students separated
from their vehicle by rapidly raising waters of
Onion Creek near Austin. It was only after a
miserable night in a small rockshelter that they
were able to return to town. Tom's last field projects
were surveys he carried out for the National Park
Service, first (1963) of Padre Island National
Seashore, then (1966-67) of the Big Bend National
Park. Despite the variety of his fieldwork, Tom
never regarded himself as a field archeologist.
Indeed, he seemed more at home in an archive than
an excavation trench. I think this was because he
enjoyed the challenge of making sense out of the
often fragmentary and confusing historic documents. And, he never lost his fondness for literature.
While all of his archeological publications remain as solid, lasting contributions, it is the coast
ones that I believe will be the longest remembered.
Tom always insisted that he became interested in
this region simply because it was being ignored by
other professional archeologists active in Texas at
the time (the late 1940s). This belittles in a characteristic Campbell fashion the rigor and big picture
he brought to coastal archeology in clear and concise writing style. Using primarily the collections
and notes made by others, he greatly refined the
systematics and chronology of the central and lower
coastal zones as well as addressed such issues as
possible Mesoamerican and other cultural contacts
and the relationships between archeological complexes and Native American groups. Appropriately
the Texas Historical Commission in 1998 named
him Archeologist of the Year.
The wide range of his research interest and
publications is awe-inspiring. For example, topics
of his articles include petroglyphs as a measure of
slope stability (with Ben Howard and others, Science 1941); thoughts on the origin of burned rock
middens (with J. Charles Kelley, American Antiquity 1942); the pioneer tree-ring work of Jacob
Kuechler (Tree-Ring Bulletin, 1949); use of medicinal plants by the Choctaw, Chickasaw and Creek
Indians (Journal of the Washington Academy of
Sciences, 1951); origins of the mescal bean cult
(American Anthropologist 1958); the Choctaw
afterworld (Journal of American Folklore, 1959);

Story-Remembering T.N. Campbell
Comanche raiding trails in Trans-Pecos Texas (with
William Fields, West Texas Historical Association
Year Book, 1968); bibliographies of Texas archeology (UT Department of Anthropology, Archeology

(with Glen Evans, Texas Memorial Museum 1970);
paleo-Indian projectile points from the southern
plains (Panhandle-Plains Historical Review
1955)-and many, many more.
From early on, Tom found Native Americans
of special interest, and it is his ethnohistoric research that best speaks to the many successes of his
career. With dogged scholarship and the ability to
remember minute details, he has revolutionized our
thinking about 16th-18th century groups in what is
now northeastern Mexico and southern Texasand, by example, all surrounding areas. He demonstrated the complexities of the early times and
showed how name variants have greatly confused
group identifications. And, with the help of William Newcomb, he established that the Tonkawa
were not native to Texas, and with LeRoy Johnson,
Jr. he recognized a previously undetected Native
American language (Sanan). He especially took
pleasure and pride in working with daughter T.J.
who had majored in Spanish at UT and taught Spanish in the Austin public schools. He valued her
critique of his translations and writing as well as
their occasional collaboration. The enormity of his
ethnohistoric output is astonishing and merits publication as an annotated bibliography. He, for example,
contributed 558 entries pertaining to Indians in the
New Handbook of Texas History (1996).

105

His ethnohistoric legacy extends beyond
publications in the form of students he supervised
or influenced. These most notably are Maitin Salinas
whose master's thesis on the Indians of the Rio
Grande Delta has been published by the UT Press
(1990), and Mariah Wade whose dissertation on the
early Native Americans of the Edwards Plateau is
being published by UT Press in several parts (first
part came out in 2003; others not yet scheduled).
Both of these works set new standards in ethnohistory. In addition, there are many others-such as
Nancy Kenmotsu-who were more indirectly but
still greatly influenced by Tom through visits to his
office and reading his writings.
As I reflect on the over 50 years that had the
pleasure of knowing Tom, I most often recall him
as an exceptionally kind and decent person, an
individual who represented the best of what
academia has to offer. I will always be grateful for
his encouragement and what he taught me in and
out of the classroom. He was very modest and
would no doubt be taken aback by my accolades
no matter how justified they are. I remember him
coming into my office just after he had read the
dedication to him in volume 56 of the T AS Bulletin. He said it made him feel important but that he
would soon recover.

People of La Salle's Last Expedition
Kathleen Gilmore

ABSTRACT
The people of La Salle's last expedition presumably were expecting to be settlers of a colony. Those
hired by La Salle and others at La Rochelle claimed to be skilled in certain trades. Those hiring them
presumably thought that those trades would be useful at a settlement. They were hired for two years. The
volunteers were mostly adventurers, some hoping to make a fortune. There were at least two families, but
probably no more than three or four unmarried women. However, today we know more about their death
than about the people themselves. This article brings together the limited detail about those people. Some
brief biographies are included.

BACKGROUND1
Four ships left La Rochelle, France in the summer of 1684 sailing between the port's massive twin
towers into the Atlantic Ocean and headed toward an
unknown land-the American Gulf Coast. These ships
were loaded with materials for a settlement. Passengers included both volunteers and hired workers.
This was the enterprise of Robert La Salle to claim
the drainage of the. Mississippi Rover for France.
The ships were the Francois, a supply ship
with. a small crew, loaded with food and supplies
for household use, the Aimable, another supply ship
with a larger crew and passengers, the Belle, La
Salle's personal ship, and the Joly, a warship and
an escort to the expedition. King Louis XIV put La
Salle in charge of the expedition including the ships.
However, in doing so, he divided the authority for
the expedition and thereby caused friction between
Captain Beaujeu of the Joly and La Salle.
As the expedition approached the island of
Santo Domingo, the Francois, had fallen behind
the other ships and the Spaniards captured it,
thus depriving the expedition of much needed
supplies. After a three-month stay on the southern
coast of Santo Domingo at Petit Goave, the
expedition headed out for the Gulf Coast of North
America to find the Mississippi River. Sailing
along the coast, and stopping at places for water
and to view the land, La Salle saw nothing
resembling the River.

Farther down the coast they came to an opening in the coast that La Salle decided was the mouth
of the Mississippi River. The opening was very
narrow and the Belle was sent through the passage
first, to be followed by the Aimable. A lot of the
material had been unloaded from the Aimable, to
lessen the ship's draft. However, as the Aimable
approached the inlet to sail through, it came too
close to the shore and was stranded on a sandbar.
Unloading began immediately using long boats that
were not in top-notch shape. The material was piled
on the coast and most of the people of the expedition disembarked there as well.
During a subsequent reconnaissance of the surrounding area, La Salle found what he considered
an ideal site for a settlement (Joutel 1962:58). This
site was about 4 miles up the drainage of Garcitas
Creek that flows into Matagorda Bay. A few houses
were begun, but food had to be rationed because of
the loss of the cargo ships, and life began in a
settled fashion. Fortunately, game was plentiful,
and the poor rations were partially supplemented
but still many of the settlers starved. Disease was
rampant partly because of the poor diet and poor
living conditions-many were dieing every day.
Adding to the colonist's misery was the wreck
of their last ship, the Belle, on the north shore of
present day Matagorda Peninsula. The few survivors
of the wrecked ship finally arrived at the settlement
after some months had passed. The situation was so
bad that La Salle was forced to attempt to get help.

After La Salle had explored the country for
many miles around the settlement, he finally realized the colony was not at the mouth of the Mississippi River. Thus, he decided to go in search of it,
talcing seventeen people with him. Their shoes and
clothing were worn out so they were outfitted with
clothes of the other inhabitants, making shoes of
leather belts, and using the sails salvaged from the
wrecked ships for shirts. It was on this last trip that
La Salle was murdered by his own disgruntled and
angry men. The remaining men he had taken with
him argued and fought among themselves resulting
in most of them killing each other. From there,
Henri Joutel, Abbe Cavelier (La Salle's brother),
Colin Cavelier (La Salle's nephew), Marle, Father
Douay and Tessier, the pilot on the Belle left for
Canada, attempting to return to France. Henri Joutel,
Douay and the Caveliers arrived in France in October 1688. Based on this timing, help could have
reached the settlers by yuletide that year but it did
not come. After that, it was too late. The Karankawa
Indians, probably knowing that La Salle was dead,
made a surprise attack in late 1688, killing all but a
few children who were rescued by the Karankawa
women. In sum, the tradesmen and others who sailed
from La Rochelle with high hopes found their settlement did not meet their dreams. In their expedition,
these people not only lived on the edge, they were
forced over it.

INTRODUCTION
Standing on the bluff on the west side of
Garcitas Creek, Victoria County, Texas, one can
look toward the west and imagine what was happening there in 1685. Those walking around the
site of the French settlement today might be able to
see in their imaginations La Salle, Joutel and others. But who were these others? Who were these
people who sought a new life in this strange and
unknown place? They may have been courageous
people but their hopes and dreams of a new life and
riches must have begun to fade with the disasters
that befell the settlement. Certainly, their dreams
ended in the total devastation of the settlement and
death of most of the settlers.
To find out what might have motivated these
people to choose such a difficult enterprise, I wanted
to know as much as I could about the participants.
The following data are the results of this research. I
found it was impossible to learn something about

each individual and what I did learn was mostly
sketchy, without the kind of detail I would prefer.
Moreover, it is impossible to estimate accurately
the number of people who intended to colonize in
this new, strange world where the expedition had
landed. For example, it is not known how many
sailors of the stranded Aimable and other persons
went back to France with the Joly. Thus, I found it
impossible to estimate the number of expedition
personnel. I found it more feasible to estimate the
number who intended to become settlers of the
colony. To do so, I used a list of people compiled
by De Villiers (1931:161) with modifications that
are now known since he compiled the list, and the
list of those hired by La Salle (De Bry n.d.). Most
of the persons on the latter list were hired for a twoor three-year contract but one could suspect, since
these were trades people, they would also eventually become colonists. La Salle may have hired
other persons who are not known.
The modified list of De Villiers amounts to 51
(Table 1), plus the human remains of a boy found at
the site in 2002 (King Personal Communication),
and those hired by La Salle number 37 plus two
hired by others. Adding these together indicates 91
settlers for the colony. I have not counted ships
crews in this 91, although some of these crew members were forced to stay at the settlement because
of the shipwrecks. Some of them died en route and
others returned to France on the Joly. As a result,
these confusing data add to the problem of having
an accurate estimate of intended settlers. The combination of the two lists mentioned above is the one
I consider as the best estimate of those who intended to stay and colonize.
I recognize this number is somewhat arbitrary.
Very few sailors were counted because the sailors
were probably assigned to their ship. Yet, when the
Belle wrecked, some seamen were probably forced
to stay so a few were counted in the final numbers.
The pilots of the Belle were not counted except
Tessier. Consequently, the number I used includes
the persons who were likely to have intended to
settle at the colony on a permanent basis. Perhaps
more information on this can be found in the future.

of La Rochelle, was located by John de Bry. His
article, entitled "Fleshing out the Cultural History
of la Belle and the La Salle Expedition (1683-1687)"
is unpublished. 2 The present article contains bar
charts of the ages and trades of the men and a
discussion of the group (Table 2). This is intended
to complement de Bry' s research.
The 39 people mentioned in de Bry's article
were tradesmen with skills that would benefit the
colony. These people were hired in La Rochelle but
they had a diversity of nationalities. Ten seamen
are listed which de Bry notes were probably hired
for the Belle since it was the only ship of the expedition whose crew was not filled. Noticeably lacking is a potter since most villages in this time period would have needed that kind of tradesmen.
Only one blacksmith is noted.
La Salle commented that some men were undisciplined and not accustomed to following orders. Perhaps these are the ones, so nearing starvation, that they ate the poisonous fruit, despite warn-

ings, resulting in half of them dieing, according to
La Salle (Margry 1886 Vol. 3:526). No further biographical information on these undisciplined men
is available at present.
Table 2 is a list of the names of the 39 men hired
by La Salle. Tables 3 and 4 are bar charts showing
the numbers by age and by trade, and Table 5 is a list
of the places of origin. The bar chart by age in Table
3 shows the majority was between 20 and 40. The
youngest was 18 and the oldest 65. It is surprising
that a man 65 years old was hired because 300 years
ago few lived to that age, and 65 was considered a
very old age. He must have been an exceptional
person, or thought he had no future, especially if he
was living in poverty. He died aboard the Belle
shortly after the landfall of the fleet in Texas.
The bar chart by trade in Table 4 shows there
were more carpenters and seaman than any other
occupation. Unfortunately, for the settlement, most
of these carpenters appear to have died or were lost
since Joutel (Margry 1886 Vol. 3:527) wrote that

La Salle himself had to lay out the main building as
well as where the mortise.and tenons belonged because there were no master carpenters left and those
carpenters that were left were ignorant persons.
The list of Place of Origin (Table 5) shows most of
those hired were from La Rochelle and the surrounding Saintonge area with one from Germany
and one from Italy.
Biographical Sketches3
The following section contains brief biographical sketches of some of the volunteers of the La Salle
enterprise. They vary in length and detail since data
were not equally available on all these persons.

Henri Joutel
Henri Joutel was born in Rouen, France in
1659 (Allaire 2004a). 4 Weddle (1996 Vol. 3:1008)
writes that before joining the La Salle expedition,

he had been in service of the army for sixteen or
seventeen years. He was a friend of the Cavelier
family and joined the La Salle expedition in 1684.
He was a big man. When the Indians from the
Caddoan settlement on the Red River met his small
party headed to Canada, in a welcoming gesture,
they carried him to the settlement. It took two
Caddo to carry Joutel. Even then his legs were
still touching the ground. He was carrying at the
time, a large cooking pot, a brace of pistols, a
shotgun, and trade materials for the Indians. In his
journal of the entire expedition, he never once
recorded that he was ill nor did he complain of the
physical exertion. Therefore, Joutel was large and
apparently healthy.
Joutel was among the survivors that eventually
returned to Canada after the murder of La Salle. He
arrived in France in October of 1688. His return
was in time to ask for help for the beleaguered
colony, but it did not happen. This was a sad blow
to Joutel since he could not save his friends.

112

He married Madeline Cailou on November 29,
1708. He was asked to return to America with the
expedition of Iberville. He refused, but his journal
of his experiences in the Ill-fated colony and his
journey north toward Canada was used by the expedition (Weddle 1996 Vol. 3:1008).

Ravenel de Sablonniere
This man, age 23 or 24, was on of two sons,

Hierosme de Ravenel, born of Gaston-Jean-Baptiste
de Ravenel, a wealthy nobleman. The two boys
were born in 1660 and 1661. The fact that Joutel
called the Ravenel on the expedition "Marquis"
makes it possible that he was the older of the two
sons, or he may have been the younger and his
older brother deceased. The son with La Salle's
expedition (hereafter called Sablonniere) was
granted a lieutenant's commission in Tonti's group
before leaving France with La Salle in 1684. He
signed, with others, the report of the wreckage of
the Aimable. The original of this document has no
comma after the "Ravenel" making it evident that
Ravenel is part of the name Ravenel de Sablonniere
(Allaire 2004a).
Sablonniere apparently had a very good time in
Petit Goave where the expedition stayed for three
months. He gambled away most of his goods and
contracted a disease (from a woman, doubtless) which
later caused him to walk with such difficulty that he
asked to be relieved of his duties as lieutenant so he
could spend his time with the servants and children
at the settlement. La Salle felt he had no choice but
to relieve his of his duties because he was unable to
perform them (Margry 1886 Vol. 3:544).
Sablonniere wanted to marry one of the servant
girls, but was denied permission by both Joutel and
La Salle. Joutel noted the girl was called "Paris"
because she was from Paris. Sablonniere was killed
by the Karankawas with the others at the settlement
in late 1688.
During archeological excavations at the Fort
St. Louis site, human remains were found near the
largest building built by the French (Personal Observation 2003). These were buried by Alonso De
Leon when he came to the fort in 1689 (Bolton
1963:398-399). The remains are of a boy, a female and a male. The age and height of the male
were difficult to determine because the post-cranial skeleton was incomplete. However, the age
range is between early 20s and 40, and the height
was within a medium range of 5'6" more or less.
The female remains were of a youngish woman.
No other information is available about her. The
remains of the boy were aged about I 0 or younger.
The bones of the male were markedly diseased
with syphilis (King personal communication
2004). Since Sablonniere was also diseased it is
possible these remains are his. Furthermore, one
could suppose, on a romantic level, the female
bones might have been those of Paris, the girl he
wanted to marry.

Gilmore-People of La Salle's Last Expedition 113
Jaques Grollet
Jaques Grollet (variously spelled) was born in
La Rochelle, France. He stated to De Leon, when
captured in 1689, that he was about 28-30 years old
(Canedo 1968:110). He became a companion of
Jean L' Archeveque during their stay with the Cenis
(Caddos) after Joutel and companions had headed
for Canada. While with the Cenis, both Jean and
Jaques were tattooed on their faces. After capture
by the Spaniards, he and L' Archeveque spent some
time in prison in Spain but the two were finally sent
back to Mexico to become members, along with
Pierre Meunier, another member of La Salle's expedition, for colonization of New Mexico when
Vargas, Spanish Governor of New Mexico, made
his second entrada in 1693, after the Pueblo Revolt.
Grollet married Elena Gallegos of Bernalillo,
New Mexico in 1699 (Esquibel and Colligan
2001:67). They had one son named Antonio Gurule.
This son and his wife, Antonia Quintana had nine
children (Sanchez 2004: 1,25). At present, descendants are scattered over western and southern United
States with at least one in the government in Washington, D.C. (Gurule Personal Communication 2002).

Jean L'Archeveque
Jean L' Archeveque (Gilmore 1998:35) was
born in Bayonne, France in 1672, the son of Claude
L' Archeveque and Maria d' Armana. Although he
was born in Bayonne, he was not Basque (West
Personal Communication 2001). In the Paris
Notarial Records of Rouen for 1684, there is an
inventory after death of Etienne L' Archeveque. His
family came from Normandy. Since L' Archeveque
is not an ordinary name, even in France, this person
may have been a relative of Claude, possibly indicating that as a merchant Claude had moved to
Bayonne from the Normandy area.
Joutel noted that L' Archeveque was "taken" in
Petite Goave but this is doubtful because in his
declaration, and later, in his marriage bans, he said
he had come with La Salle and four ships. Also, he
said he came with primo hijo. He likely meant La
Salle but he could have meant Pierre Duhaut who
was Jean's employer. Duhaut and his brother were
from Bayonne (Canedo 1968:107). Jean went on
the last journey of La Salle headed toward Canada
and France. He took part in the ambush that resulted in the murder of La Salle. He seemed to have
regretted the murder of La Salle because he rushed

to tell Joutel of the "terrible event" and warned
Joutel not to resist the men of the mutiny (Margry
1886 Vol. 3:21). At the time of La Salle's murder,
L' Archeveque was 15 years old but seemed considerably older, and the foregoing action indicates he
felt considerable responsibility. The fact that Jean
attributed the murder of La Salle to Liotot instead
of to Duhaut was probably because he was employed by Duhaut and was likely his kinsman. It
could be he was protecting his relative along with
protecting himself.
When the group headed by Joutel and the Abbe
Cavelier, La Salle's brother, started on the journey
to Canada and hopefully on to France, L' Archeveque pleaded sickness and remained with the Cenis
Indians where he lived the life of the Indians for
two years. He allowed himself to be tattooed on his
face. Since Grollet had decided to stay behind also,
he and Jean had become friends.
In 1689, the Jumano Indians, making their annual trading trip in the spring to the Cenis, told the
Cenis of an attack on Ft. St. Louis (Kelley
1952:227). Jean and Grollet decided to visit the
settlement along with Indian companions. They
found the settlement devastated and reported finding 14 bodies, which they buried. They returned to
the Cenis village feeling sad and homesick for any
European contact. Hearing of Spaniards in the area,
L' Archeveque tried to contact them unsuccessfully.
Meanwhile, De Leon had found the French village
in its sad condition. He traveled on to the Cenis
village and there captured both L' Archeveque and
Grollet (Gilmore 1998:42-43).
Jean, along with Grollet and Meunier, were
attached as exiles in the Vargas reentry of New
Mexico in 1693, after the Pueblo Rebellion (Canedo
1968: 110). L' Archeveque and Meunier were to be
soldiers at the fort at Santa Fe, whereas Grollet,
being a seaman, was not attached to the presidio
and instead settled in Bernalillo.
In 1697, Jean married Antonia Gutierrez whom
he had met on the journey to Santa Fe (L' Archeveque 1697). At the muster before entering New
Mexico, she was described as being 16 years of
age, a "tall, broad faced, brown-haired, brown-eyed"
young woman (Twitchell 1914). She had been widowed at the beginning of the trip and doubtless was
befriended by 20 year-old Jean, eventually falling
in love. They had two children. Antonia died about
1700 (Gilmore 1998:35-46).
Jean accompanied the Villasur expedition into
the plains in 1720. There was information that the

114

Texas Archeological Society

Pawnees, with a group of Frenchmen, were ready
to wage war. Unfortunately, the Indians attacked
the New Mexico troops in a surprise move killing
all but a few of the expedition. The dead included
Villasur and L' Archeveque. 5
Throughout his time at the French settlement
Jean seemed to be older than his years would indicate. He was large for his age and was treated as an
adult during most of this time. He also did not
complain of sickness as much as several others had
often done. Perhaps he was in better health. He was
well educated. In 1698 when the French were interviewing the Talon brothers, they were asked about
L' Archeveque and Grollet. Pierre Talon remarked
that "they were grown men who were intelligent,
especially L' Archeveque. They [the Spaniards]
feared that they would bring back to France too
much knowledge of this particular country" (Weddle
1987:247). His handwriting on the note he sent to
the Spaniards was well executed. He must have
sickened at the destruction at the French settlement
and became determined to leave, return to his own
kind regardless of their nationality.
Becoming a success in Santa Fe attests to his
intelligence and assertiveness. He also had a strong
libido. After Antonia died he fathered several "natural," or born out of wedlock children whom he
raised in his household. L' Archeveque has many
descendants who are scattered over the western and
southern United States (West personal communication 2001). 6
Pierre Meunier
Pierre Meunier was born in Paris about 1670.
He never stated his age precisely. His father was
Louis Meunier, Sieur de Preville, treasurer to Louis
XIV, and his mother was Isabel German. It is likely
La Salle was friendly with Meunier' s parents because, according to Pierre, La Salle told Pierre's
father he would treat him like his own son during
the coming adventure.
Apparently, Meunier was on the Belle when a
mutinous group decided to cut a cable. When La
Salle later learned of the plot, he had four put in
chains, Meunier one of them (Margry 1886 vol.
3:530). After the tragic wrecking of the Belle, and
the misfortunes of those on it, the survivors were
finally able to return to the settlement.
Meunier accompanied the group that would
attempt to go to Canada. This group, consisting
of 17 persons from the settlement with La Salle,

was on the way to the Cenis village when
Moranget (La Salle's nephew), Saget (La Salle's
servant), and Nika (a Shawnee Indian) were
killed one night. The next day when La Salle
came to the site Pierre Duhaut shot him in the
head. Meunier was a witness to La Salle's murder and he reported in his declaration that Duhaut
was the actual murderer (Meunier in Foster
1998:Apendix A).
Some authors state that Meunier was left with
the Cenis with Pierre Talon to learn the language.
But, he could have learned the language at a later
date when he was with the Indians for two years. It
was during this time also that Meunier visited the
Cadohadacho village on the Red River with his Indian friends from the Cenis village (Foster l 998:Appendix A). He had allowed himself to be tattooed to
show his friendly intentions toward the Indians.
He and Pierre Talon had become companions and were captured together by De Leon in
1690. When they were found they were apprehensive of what lay ahead. They both gave depositions to De Leon and were taken to Mexico
City, with Francisco Martinez, an interpreter.
There, Meunier gave another deposition, which
seemed to imply that he had been on some exploration trips with La Salle. His observations are
rather well stated with some parts in detail although others were sketchily told.
He accompanied the Teran expedition in 1691
into present day Texas and visited the Cadohadacho
village on the Red River (Teran 1932:60). His statement that he had visited this village with the Cenis
may be why he was left behind to accompany the
expedition when others (Grollet and L' Archeveque)
were went to Spain, as he would have known the
area as well as the language.
Later he met again L' Archeveque and Grollet,
all three being sent in exile to New Mexico with a
group of colonists in 1693 (Twitchell 1914). He
and L' Archeveque were to become soldiers at the
presidio at Santa Fe.
In late December 1699, Pierre married Lucia
Madrid, daughter of Pedro Madrid, a soldier at
the presidio of El Paso del Norte (Meunier 1699).
Meunier may have been transferred to that
presidio. We have no further information about
the couple except one instance in 1700 when
Meunier signed over his power of attorney, as
did others, so the soldiers might get paid
(Esquibel and Colligan 2001 :69). It is a mysterious disappearance for both Pierre and Lucia.

Gilmore-People of La Salle's Last Expedition 115
Searches of the literature have revealed nothing.
However, a group of documents from the church
of Guadalupe now in Juarez, Mexico across the
river from El Paso, may contain information
about them. Some of the documents of this period were placed in an unlocked rectory where
they were available to whomever wanted them.
This story is told by Bud Newman, 1983 "The
Case of the Missing Documents." At present,
some of the documents are being recovered.
It is possible the couple could have returned to
France? It seems unlikely since the three Frenchmen, L' Archeveque, Grollet and Meunier had been
exiled from Europe by the Spanish government.

Colin Crevel De Moranget
Colin Crevel de Moranget, a Lieutenant, was
also La Salle's nephew, the son of La Salle's sister
who married a Crevel. Along with Barbier he was
listed on Tonti's list of those who traveled down
the Mississippi River with La Salle in 1682 (Margry
1888 vol. 1:634). Tonti did not use the "Moranget"
attached to his name, referring to him as simply
"Crevel." Not much is known about him. He was in
the forefront of those La Salle depended on, although Moranget did not always precisely follow
orders. He was on the journey to go to Canada and
France. When the travelers had proceeded not too
far from the Cenis, a hunting group of the travelers
killed some game. La Salle sent Moranget to look
for this group and when he found them, he treated
the men in the group harshly. Resentment had been
building against Moranget and La Salle for some
time. That night Liotot, the surgeon, killed Moranget
and also La Salle's hunter Nika and his valet, Saget.
Moranget did not die instantly but sat up and Marle,
a member of the hunting group, was forced by the
others to shoot him. Presumably, these bodies were
left unburied.

When the depleted group left the Cenis for Canada
and had stopped near the Cadohadacho village, another member of the group (Marle) went for a swim
in the river. Colin Cavelier saw that Marle was
drowning but he was too late to save him.
Colin Cavelier reached France with his cousin
Abbe Cavelier and Joutel. He became a soldier but
died several years afterward (Foster 1998:50n).

Marle
This man's first name was probably Jean-Pierre
according to one of his present day family descendents in La Brie, France (J.P. Marle Personal Communication, 1988). He accompanied the group with
Joutel on the way to Canada. He was present at the
murder of La Salle. After Liotot had attacked
Moranget, Moranget sat up and the group forced
Marle to end Morang et' s life. On the way to Canada
Joutel described Marle as one of the "prime" members of the group (Joutel 1962: 135). Having arrived
on the Red River near the Cadohadacho village,
Marle decided to go for a swim, but unfortunately
he drowned before he could be rescued. He was
buried in a small mound behind the chief's cabin.
The chief's wife placed a basket of corn on the
grave every day.
His remains were found in 1936 by the archeologist, A.T. Jackson (Jackson 1932). At the time
the remains were not considered to be the remains
of a non-Indian, but circumstantial evidence and
skeletal analysis now support the fact that these are
the bones of Jean-Pierre Marle (Gilmore 1996:303).
These bones also indicate he had strong musculature and his hands showed hard work. The remains
indicate a man of about 40 plus years old (King
1996:320). Three musket balls lay in his chest cavity. Of course, it is not known when these shots
were acquired. His present day relatives could supply no information about his life in France prior to
this enterprise.

Colin Cavelier
Colin Cavelier was another nephew of La Salle,
a son of La Salle's brother. Some authors place his
age about 10 whereas others as older, perhaps 17
when the group left on the tiip to Canada and thence
to France. Joutel in some places called him the
young Cavelier to distinguish him from La Salle
and the Abbe Jean Cavelier (Joutel 1962). La Salle
may have taken him on many of his explorations so
he must have been old enough to be self-sufficient.

Anastase Douay
Anastase Douay, a recollet friar, was born,
according to Hennepin (in Weddle 2001: 121) in
Quesnoy, France. He accompanied the La Salle
expedition expecting to become a missionary to the
natives. He witnessed the murder of La Salle and,
after returning to France, wrote about it in an
account of his experiences. He must have forgotten
the last circumstance of La Salle's death, or

116

Texas Archeological Society

imagined so strongly what he might have done, that
he believed it. His account told of the shooting of
La Salle while he stood by, shaking, thinking he
would be the next to be shot. He told of burying La
Salle and erecting a cross over his grave (Delanglez
1938). Others told of stripping La Salle of his
clothes and leaving his body to be ravaged by wild
animals. This latter circumstance is supported by
the fact that later, after the spoils of the murders
were distributed, one person had appropriated La
Salle's jacket and another had his gold coins.
Father Douay accompanied Joutel and the Abbe
Cavelier with a small group headed for Canada and
France, where they arrived in October 1688. He,
along with Pierre and Jean-Baptiste Talon, returned
with Iberville to establish a settlement on the Gulf
Coast now known as Mobile. Further information
about Douay is not known.

Tanneguy Le Gallois De Beaujeu
Tanneguy Le Gallois de Beaujeu was captain
of the warship Joly that escorted La Salle on his
expedition to establish a colony in the "New World."
He was appointed captain to replace Sieur Pingault
(de Bry n.d.:3) shortly before the expedition set
sail. The King placed La Salle in command of the
expedition including its ships, putting Beaujeu under La Salle's command. This rankled Beaujeu because he felt he knew more about sailing that La
Salle, thus causing conflict between the two men
(de Bry n.d.:4). Although this conflict seems to
make it improbable that Beaujeu would place his
pewter plates aboard the Belle. Such plates, however, were recovered aboard the ship in archeological excavations in 1996 and contain a coat of arms
similar to those of the families of Le Gallois de
Beaujeu and Edouard Ier de Beaujeu (Allaire
2004b )7 indicating that the plates did belong to
Beaujeu. It is a mystery how and why his plates had
been placed on the Belle.
The warship Joly commanded by Beaujeu sailed
for France with Aigron, the captain of the Aimable,
Minet the engineer and Esmanville, a priest, plus
and unknown number of sailors from the Aimable
in March 1685 (Joutel 1962:57).

Gabriel Barbier
The following was written by Stephanie Olech
and Gabriel Sheridan (Olech and Sheridan 2002),
descendants of Barbier' s family:

Gabriel Le Minime Barbier was
baptized on September 6, 1656 at Notre
Dane de Montreal in Canada. He was
probably born the day before. His father
was Gilbert Barbier dit Le Minime. His
mother was Catherine De La Vaux. His
parents were married at Notre Dame de
Montreal in 1650. They were both from
Nevers in Northern France. Gilbert
Barbier had arrived in Hochelaga (later
to become Ville Marie, then Montreal) in
1642 with the original 12 colonists to
found the future city. His father was a
Master Carpenter and was in charge of
building all the fortifications and buildings of the new city. They had six children, three boys and three girls ... Most
descendants are from Adrienne Barbier
Trudeau. Later, Gilbert Barbier' s father
became the attorney for Charles Le
Moyne who was the father of Iberville
and Bienville who followed through with
La Salle's plans for French colonies on
the Gulf Coast.
Gabriel, as a voyageur, traveled by canoe with La Salle in 1681-1682 on the
complete discovery of the Mississippi all
the way to the Gulf of Mexico and back
to Montreal. He was with him for the
founding and naming of what is now
Louisiana. In 1683 he accompanied La
Salle back to France to the court of Louis
XIV at the Louvre to convince the king,
as a native born Canadian, [to provide
testimony] of the truth of La Salle's discovery and to lobby for founding a new
colony on the lower Mississippi. In 1684
he left with La Salle, having been made a
Lieutenant, with the four ships that
landed in present day Texas and founded
Fort St. Louis there. He married one of
the few women who also landed in Texas
and thus [his] became the first recorded
marriage of Europeans in what is now
the state of Texas. He called his wife
"Princess" and La Salle named the Princess River after her. Gabriel was left in
charge of the fort while La Salle left with
others to try to get help for the fort. The
reason he was left in charge of women,
his child, the priests and others was that
he had injure his foot on a splinter, which
[would have] slowed down the rest. They
were all massacred by the Karankawa

Gilmore-People of La Salle's Last Expedition 117
Indians during Christmas time in 1688
after La Salle had been assassinated by
other Frenchmen (from a journal of Jou tel
1684-1687).
Gabriel Sheridan, a family descendant, describes the Barbier men as having brown, curly hair
and brown eyes, in height about no more that 5'8".
On the map (Joutel 1962 [1713] frontispiece)
annotated by Joutel there are two branches on
present day Lavaca River. On this map a key has
the following notation:
E. Riviere aux Cannes, ainsi apellie
depuis son embouchure jusqu 'a la
fourche qui la separe en 2-bras don't
celui qui est a droit apeller Mignone,
acause des amours d'un nomme le sr
Barbier Lieutenant, et se separe encore
au dessus en trios autres; celui qui est a
gauche de la premiere fourche s'apelle
Princess acause de la meme raison.
Translation: "River of the Cannes, so
called from the mouth up to the branch
where it separates into 2 branches, which
is cleverly ca:lled R. "Mignone," because
of the loves of Sieur Barbier, Lieutenant,
and it is separated again into three others;
The branch that is at the left of the first
branch is named "Princess" for the same
reason."

These rivers, according to Weddle (1996:36)
are present day Lavaca and Navidad rivers. La Salle,
on his final journey, upon crossing these rivers in
1687, named them "Mignone," meaning "darling"
and "Princess," Barbier's lover's name, in honor of
his friendship of Lt. Barbier.

Father Zenobia Membre
Father Zenobia Membre was born in Baupaume
in the French Netherlands. He entered the monastery in Artois in the province of Saint-Antoine.
With his cousin Fr. Chretien Le Clercq, he was sent
to Canada where he arrived in 1675. Membre accompanied La Salle to Niagra, Mackinac, and Fort
Crevecoeur, the latter in Illinois. Father Zenobia
went with La Salle's excursion down the Mississippi River and back in 1682.
After this, he went with La Salle when La Salle
presented his project of a colony in America to enhance trade and occupy all the lands drained by the

Mississippi. Membre and his cousin, Fr. Le Clerq,
accompanied La Salle's fleet to establish this colony
and missions for the Indians on the Gulf shores. He
was aboard the wreck of the Aimable, barely escaping being drowned. He did not accompany La Salle
and his party when they left the settlement on January 7, 1687 to obtain help for the beleaguered colony,
possibly because sometime before he had been injured by a wounded buffalo. He died with the others
remaining at the settlement near the Christmas season of 1688. He was a well-liked and effective priest
(Cox 1968 [1905]:106 fn.).

Talon Family
The Talon family was one of two families to
accompany the La Salle expedition to the Gulf. The
father was Lucien (born ca. 1643), a native of
Beauvais, and the mother, Isabelle Planteau Talon
(born ca. 1646), a native of Paris (Weddle 1996
Vol. 6: 197). They were probably married in Canada.
They accompanied La Salle's expedition with six
children; Marie-Elizabeth (born 1672) the oldest,
who died probably during the winter of 1685-1686
at the settlement; Marie-Madeleine (born 1673);
Pierre (born 1676); Jean-Baptiste (born 1679);
Lucien, born probably during the voyage from
Canada to France; and Robert (born 1684) during
the voyage to the Gulf. Another boy Eustace Breman
was with the family and was probably a relative.
Lucien the father was a master carpenter. He was
lost on one of La Salle's first exploring trips from
the settlement.
At the time of the massacre late in 1688, Pierre
was with the Indians somewhere in present day east
Texas. The other Talon children and Eustace
Breman were saved from the massacre by the
Karankawa women. Jean-Baptiste's description of
the massacre (Weddle 1987:209) when interviewed
by the Spaniards is the only first hand description
known. Why Eustace Breman was not interviewed
is not known, or Marie-Madeleine for that matter,
but an interview with her was probably because she
was a female.
When at the Karankawa village a group of Indian males gathered around in a bunch seemingly
to molest Marie-Madeleine. The Talon brothers
(Robert, age 4, Lucien, age c. 6, and Jean-Baptiste,
age c. 9) and Eustace Breman formulated a plan to
keep this from happening. Eustace Breman was the
spokesman who confronted the Indians saying if
they harmed Mari-Madeleine, the God of the

118

Texas Archeological Society

Frenchmen would shower His wrath upon them.
This act saved her and the Indians departed.
On one of La Salle's earlier trips, Pierre Talon
had been left with the Cenis Indians to learn their
language. He was taken from the Cenis along with
Pierre Meunier by Alonso De Leon in 1690. The
other Talon children were taken from the Karankawa Indians in 1690 and were sent to Mexico City
where they lived with the Viceroy's family. MarieMadeleine and Robert were sent from Mexico to
Spain with the Viceroy upon his retirement. Pierre,
Jean-Baptiste and Lucien were put into military
service and assigned to a ship, the Santo Cristo,
that was captured by the French about 1698. The
three boys wanted to be taken to Spain but were
sent to France instead. They were again enrolled in
military service, this time for France (Weddle 1997,
Vol.6:197). However, Lucien, being too young for
French military service, was sent as a servant to
Oleron. Nothing more is known about Lucien.
Jean-Baptiste, who gave the only eye witness
account of the massacre at Fort St. Louis, and Pierre,
who was present at the murder of La Salle, were
both finally interrogated by the French in 1698.
It came to the attention of Pierre Le Moyne,
Sieur d'Iberville, that people who had been with La
Salle were in France. He contacted Henri Joutel and
the two Talon brothers, Pierre and Jean-Baptiste. He
was planning, in essence, to carry out La Salle's plan
for a French settlement on the Gulf of Mexico. Joutel
refused the invitation to accompany the expedition.
However, the two brothers joined the second voyage
with Iberville and provided invaluable information
and also their knowledge of the Indian and Spanish
languages. They were assigned to the command of
Louis Juchereau de St. Denis who was the founder
of Nachitoches, Louisiana. In 1701, Pierre and JeanBaptist were reported in prison in Portugal. Nothing
definite is further known about Jean-Baptiste. Ten
years later, Pierre and another brother, Robert Talon,
were with St. Denis on the Rio Grande (Weddle
1996, vol. 6:197).
These two brothers apparently went back to
Louisiana. Weddle notes (1996 vol. 6: 197) that
Pierre probably eventually went back to France and
died there. Robert resided in Mobile where at
present his descendants live, as well as in the state
of Louisiana (Spencer Personal Communication,
2005). Marie-Madeleine returned to Canada where
her son Pierre's marriage is recorded in 1719
(Weddle 1996, vol. 6: 197). He was her only child
(Newfield Personal Communication 2002).

The Other Family
The other family besides the Talon was
composed of a soldier who died fairly early in the
experience, and his wife. There is no specific
record of their name or how many children in the
family, but since this is called a family (Foster
1998: 118) there must have been at least one child.
This was probably a boy about 10 in view of the
following. When De Leon visited the site in 1689,
he found and buried three bodies (Bolton
1963:398). It is probable that animals had disturbed
the remains of all three because they were in
fragmentary condition when discovered and excavated during archeological fieldwork at the site.
The remains were those of a man, a woman and a
child-a boy of about 10 (King personal communication 2004). All the other male children at the
site have been accounted for. The remains of the
boy consisted of only one leg. This was sufficient
to determine sex and age, according to H. Gill
King, a forensic anthropologist. It is curious that
the Karankawa women did not rescue this boy as
they had the other children. Was he hiding with
his mother so well that after the initial massacre
that these three people were found and murdered?
Moreover, the male remains were badly diseased
with syphilis, a man who could hardly walk (See
Sablonniere this article). He may have hidden instead of running for cover. This man, then, was
probably Sablonniere.

The Girls of the Expedition
Joutel notes there were seven females on the
expedition. These were as follows, although they
may not be the seven Joutel referred to: Madame
Talon, Marie-Elizabeth Talon, Marie-Madeleine
Talon, "La Princess," "Paris," the girl from Saint
Jean d'Angely, and a soldier's wife (Foster ed.
1998:118).
Marie-Elizabeth Talon died at the settlement
probably in the winter of 1685-1686. MarieMadeleine Talon was rescued from the massacre of
1688 by the Karankawa women, along with the
other Talon children and Eustace Breman. During
the Talon children's confrontation with the Indians
about to molest Marie-Madeleine, the fact that
Eustace Breman confronted the Indians for the other
Talons suggests that Eustace may have been the
oldest of the male children there. Marie-Madeleine
with others was sent to Mexico City to live in the

Gilmore-People of La Salle's Last Expedition 119
Viceroy's household. She finally moved to France
and then Canada where she man-ied Pierre Simon.
She had a son there who was called Pien-e.
The girl from Saint Jean d' Angely, whose name
is not known, was on the Belle when it was wrecked.
She returned to the settlement with Father
Chefdeville and the others. Presumably she was
killed by the Karankawa in the massacre at the end
of 1688.
"Paris" was an unnamed girl but was from the
city of Paris. She was "young, shapely and not uncomely" (Foster 1998:143). Sablonniere wanted to
man-y her but Joutel refused saying that she was
beneath his station. He even forbade them to speak
to each other (Foster 1998:143). She may have been
part of the reason that Sablonniere resigned his rank
as lieutenant so that he could spend his time with the
women and children at the settlement. She was presumably killed at the massacre.
"La Princess" was the name Barbier gave to
the girl he fell in love with and eventually man-ied.
Joutel (in Foster 1998: 155) said of her: "The proverb is quite true that there is no unbecoming love
even if the object is not charming." A house was
built for the newly married couple. In time, La
Princess had a miscarriage. However, later, she delivered a healthy baby. When La Salle set out on
his final trip to Canada, he named the present day
Lavaca River, the "Princess," and one of its branches
"Mignone" in honor of Barbier' s wife because La
Salle noted.it was.on.these banks that Barbier declared his love of La Princess. Princess and her
baby were first rescued by the Karankawa women
but both were later killed.
The girls and women, in addition to the men,
were taught how to shoot by Joutel. This activity
was in the form of a contest. The girl coming closest
to the mark was given "some other trifle" whereas
the men were awarded some brandy. In addition, if
the girls and women know how to shoot, they could
be assigned to sentry duty (Foster 1998:145). These
contests were to help the inhabitants protect themselves, but unfortunately, these lessons did not help
in the surprise attack by the Indians.

DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS

Looking back over the persons of the settlement, one wonders if the kinds of people had anything to do with the "bad luck" that La Salle had at
the settlement. Unfortunately, historical documents

seldom write of thoughts and dreams. We do know
the people of La Salle's last journey were courageous. They made a long sea voyage across a vast
ocean and expected to settle and colonize a little
known or even explored land. Not only courageous
but all must have had a feeling of adventure. Some
likely had thoughts of immense wealth. Some may
have been in search of religious freedom. Then
what caused these great expectations to end so tragically? Did the personalities and the character of the
people have anything to do with the failure of the
colony? First we will look at the group of tradesman hired by La Salle.
Before sailing, La Salle hired and signed contracts with 39 tradesmen in the Menon legal office
in La Rochelle. After landing and putting the men
to work, La Salle complained they were undisciplined and not accustomed to obeying orders
(Margry 1874-1886 vol. 3:526). Apparently, these
men did not have the sufficient skills required to
benefit the colony. La Salle also noted that half of
them died from eating poisonous fruit after being
warned the fruit was poisonous. The other tradesmen probably died shortly thereafter in view of the
short rations and hard work they were required to
perform.
The fact that these men were undisciplined
points to the errors of La Salle and his poor planning. He was not careful to hire knowledgeable
persons. He also complained when getting ready to
build the principle house at the settlement that the
master carpenters had died or were lost and the
carpenters remaining were lacking in skill.
Excepting those hired by La Salle, most of the
persons at the settlement were of the bourgeoisie
(middle class). One ranking nobleman's father was
a marquis, but this man, Sablonniere, was a wastrel
(see biographical sketch of Sablonniere this article).
He may have been instrumental in the wreck of the
Belle, a hard blow for La Salle and the people.
Other persons or settlers of the colony became
embittered when their dreams of fortunes faded.
This was especially true of the merchants who had
brought many items to trade to the Indians. Pierre
Duhaut, one of the merchants, was further embittered because of the loss of his brother, so much so
that he was willing to murder his leader, La Salle,
the final act of unmitigated bitterness.
The recollet priests who had accompanied the
expedition had expected to eventually become missionaries and convert the Indians to Christianity.
This never occurred and must have been a source

120

Texas Archeological Society

of frustration to them. Abbe Esmanville returned to
France on the Joly having become disenchanted
with La Salle. La Salle ordered Esmanville' s diary
destroyed because it told of La Salle's unjust practices. The priests' frustration seems to be further
indicated by Father Douay's tale of La Salle's murder, falsely saying he buried La Salle and erected a
cross over his grave. The other recollets who were
left by La Salle at the site were killed in the massacre at the end of 1688.
A further indication of the pending lack of success of the colony is the fact that there were only
seven females, listed previously, among the inhabitants. Their small number bodes for lack of success
because offsp1ing are necessary for the perpetuation
of a colonial enterprise. Is it possible La Salle planned
that after success of the settlement he would request
more French women be sent? This same problem
existed later with other beginning French colonies.
For example, it was requested that French women be
sent to New Orleans and other fledgling colonial
settlements, because the anxious Frenchmen were
marrying the Indian women (Rowland and Sanders
1929:207). Moreover, the complaint stated that instead of making French-like women of the Indians,
the Indians were making Indian-like men of the
French. Consequently, the population of the colony
would become not purely French.
In sum, the tragic enterprise of La Salle seems
to have been doomed from its beginning. The personnel of the expedition did not fill the necessary
requirements for a colony to perpetuate itself. La
Salle apparently lacked the ability to hire skilled
tradesmen. He also lacked effective managerial
skills for the colony to survive. Moreover, Joutel
noted that La Salle shared his plans with no one,
nor would La Salle ask for advice, other indications
of an insecure individual.
Nevertheless, part of La Salle's dreams were
realized when a French settlement was established
at present day Mobile, Alabama more than 20 years
after La Salle's unsuccessful attempt. A little later
French settlements were also established at New
Orleans and Nachitoches in present day Louisiana.
The French did not gain La Salle's claim for the
entire drainage of the Mississippi River but did
occupy present day Louisiana and part of the Gulf
Coast, thereby leaving a French imprint and flavor
on the entire area.
Another result of La Salle's efforts was to motivate the Spaniards to colonize Texas, a neglected are.
Therefore, present day Texas, instead of having a long

term influence by the French, was left (especially
south Texas) with an overlay of Spanish influence.

Documenting Archeological Sites in Cooke
and Grayson Counties, Texas
William A. Martin

ABSTRACT
Archeological sites in the Cooke County area have been understudied. At the request of the Cooke County
Historical Commission, archeologists from the Texas Historical Commission undertook an effort to sample
as many of the major drainages and physiographic zones of the county as possible, obtain information on a
variety of sites and document them on State of Texas Archeological Site forms. Twelve sites were recorded
that included occupations from most of the major cultural periods of history and prehistory, illustrating the
rich archeological heritage of the region.

INTRODUCTION
The Cooke County Archeological Project
(CCAP) was undertaken by staff of the Archeology
Division of the Texas Historical Commission (THC)
during the week of November 13-17, 1989, at the
request of Ms. Margaret Parx Hays of the Cooke
County Historical Commission. Ms. Hays was concerned that several important historic and prehistoric
sites were present in the county, but that very few
had been recorded or studied. From the standpoint of
Texas archeology, the area along the Red River in
this part of the state was a virtual terra incognita. At
that time, the only professional reports available on
excavated sites in Cooke County were the Fish Creek
Reservoir (Moss Lake) report by Southern Methodist University (Lonaine 1969) and one of the Lake
Ray Robe1is reports by the University of North Texas
(Prikryl and Yates 1987). Ms. Hays urged the THC
to visit the county and document some of its more
important sites. Ms. Ona B. Reed, a long-time member of the Texas Archeological Stewardship Network, Texas Archeological Society, and at that time,
Chair of the Cooke County Historical Commission,
was also a leading proponent of this project. She
accompanied the survey crews in the field and assisted with site documentation.
The CCAP was not an intensive survey like
those conducted to comply with historic preservation laws, where a large amount of acreage is inspected and shovel tested in an effort to record all

sites within a given project area. It cannot even be
construed as a reconnaissance survey of the county.
More accurately, it was a series of brief visits to
specific sites that were already known to local residents, amateur archeologists, and collectors. The
project's goal was to record these sites on official
state of Texas site forms and briefly assess their
potential importance for future research. Although
some time was spent examining creek bank profiles
to search for buried deposits near some of the sites
that were recorded, the vast majority of the effort
was aimed at delineating site boundaries and depth
of deposit at the sites our informants knew about.
Although the project was of extremely short duration (four days), 12 sites were recorded in different
physiographic zones along the major drainages
within Cooke County and a portion of western
Grayson County.

ENVIRONMENT
The prehistoric use of the landscape was determined in large paii by the physical environment.
Local geology, hydrology, climate, soils, and vegetation worked in combination to provide resources,
such as stone for tools, or habitat for critical food
resources, such as deer, or other game animals.
Tools were designed to hunt and process specific
species of plants and animals, and changes in climate over time changed the availability of these

resources. Moreover many assemblages originally
created for hunting and gathering eventually included tools necessary for agriculture. The characteristics of the various physiographic zones identified in the project area are summarized below.
Geology, Soils, and Vegetation
Cooke County, in the extreme north central
portion of Texas, is bounded by Montague County

to the west, Wise and Denton counties to the south,
Grayson County to the east, and the Red River (and
the State of Oklahoma) to the north (Figure 1). The
landscape varies from sandy hills with oak-savanna
on the east and west, to relatively flat prairie in the
central portion, to low hills and steep wooded breaks
along deeply incised streams and gullies near the
Red River (Figure 2). The county lies within the
transition between the Gulf Coastal Plain physiographic province, which parallels the Gulf of

Mexico, and the Great Plains physiographic
province (Carr 1969). Three geographic zones,
subdivisions of these larger provinces, are present
in the county: the Eastern Cross Timbers, the Grand
Prairie, and the Western Cross Timbers. The
geographic zones largely correlate with the major
geologic formations, which in turn are responsible
for the dramatic shift in soils from sand to clay to
sand again as one moves across the county. The
following discussion summarizes the geology, soils,
and vegetation associated with each of these
geographic zones.

Eastern Cross Timbers
This zone is characterized by extensive gently
sloping to rolling uplands that are moderately dissected. Sloping to rolling sandstone-capped hills
and ridges rise prominently above the surrounding
uplands. The Woodbine formation, consisting of
sandstone, shales, sandy shales and fine-to-coarse
sands underlies this zone (Prikryl 1990:6). Iron oxides of limonite and hematite give the Woodbine its
characteristically reddish-brown color and ironstone
concretions are exposed on the surface of some

upland slopes. Stream valleys are narrow and have
steep gradients.
Much of the rural land is in improved pasture,
native grass pasture, or noncommercial oak forest
vegetation, and is used primarily for grazing beef
cattle. Improved pasture and urban development is
increasing in the Eastern Cross Timbers, especially
to the south of Cooke County. Historically, this
area supported oak savanna vegetation with a tall
grass understory. Little bluestem, purpletop tridens,
indiangrass, switchgrass, big bluestem, post oak,
blackjack oak, elm, coralberry, American beautyberry, bumelia, greenbrier, and elbowbush are some
of the dominant species. Engelmann-daisy, lespedezas, and trailing wildbeans are among the numerous perennial forbs (Soil Survey Staff 1981:61).

Grand Prairie
The Grand Prairie developed on a gently rolling
to hilly, dissected plateau made up of a variety of
limestones, clays, and marls. Stream valleys are
shallow and narrow in their upper reaches but
deepen and broaden near the eastern edge of the
area. A few outliers of the Woodbine formation

126

form knobs along the eastern edge of the Grand
Prairie that stand out as dramatic hills on an
otherwise flat to gently rolling terrain.
Today, most of the land is native rangeland and
improved pasture with beef cattle as the principal
livestock. Some valleys, bottomlands, and the
deeper soils on uplands are still used as cropland,
and native pecan orchards are common along the
floodplains. This area originally supported prairie
vegetation with widely scattered live oak trees. Little
bluestem, indiangrass, big bluestem, and switchgrass are typical species. Little bluestem, sideoats
grama, tall grama, and scattered shrub live oak and
juniper trees characterize the natural vegetation on
the very shallow soils and along escarpments (Soil
Survey Staff 1981:61-62).

dissected, although land in the northern portion of
the county has a higher average slope gradient.
Stream valleys are narrow and have steep gradients.
Today, most of the Western Cross Timbers zone is
comprised of pasture or noncommercial oak forests
that are used for grazing beef cattle. Cropland has
been decreasing for many years in favor of improved
pasture. Historically, this area supported savanna
vegetation with tall grass interspersed among trees
and underbrush. Little bluestem, purpletop tridens,
indiangrass, switchgrass, big bluestem, sand
lovegrass, post oak, blackjack oak, elm, coralberry,
greenbrier, and elbowbush are dominant species.
Engelmann-daisy, Maxmilian sunflower, and trailing
wildbean are among the numerous perennial forbs
(Soil Survey Staff 1981:60-61).

Western Cross Timbers

River Drainages

This zone lies within the Paluxy formation, a
reddish sandstone and shale unit with sandy soils
that support post oak savanna. The Western Cross
Timbers receive about 2.5 inches less rain than the
Eastern Cross Timbers, so although the vegetation
is similar, the woodlands are not as lush. The uplands
are nearly level to rolling and are moderately

Two major drainage basins are present in Cooke
County (see Figure 1). Every stream north of
Gainesville drains into the Red River (Figure 3).
All other drainages flow into the Elm Fork of the
Trinity River. The Red River is part of the Mississippi drainage and is the second longest river in
Texas. It forms the northern boundary of ten Texas

Martin-Documenting Archeological Sites in Cooke and Grayson Counties, Texas 127
counties, and has served as a political boundary
since early historic times. In the 1700s the river
was regarded as the dividing line between France
and Spain. The Red River was formally set forth as
the northern boundary of Texas in the Adams-Onfs
Treaty of 1819. This treaty, ratified by Spain and
the United States in 1821 and by Mexico in 1822,
established the Red River as the southwestern
boundary of Louisiana as far northwest as the 1OOth
meridian (Kleiner 1996:492).
The Red River is impounded by Denison Dam,
northwest of Denison, Texas to create Lake
Texoma. Authorized by the Flood Control Act of
1938, it was built by the U.S. Army Corps of
Engineers and opened in 1944. The lake covers
over 89,000 acres in Texas and Oklahoma including portions of Grayson and Cooke counties,
Texas, and Marshall, Johnson, Bryan, and Love
counties, Oklahoma (Breeding 1996:31). Erosion
along the shoreline has exposed numerous archeological sites, and eight sites were recorded along
the western end of the lake in Grayson County
during the CCAP.
Fish Creek is an important tributary that originates from the confluence of North Fish Creek and
South Fish Creek, which were dammed to form
Moss Lake (formerly Fish Creek Reservoir). It
winds east, then northwest, southeast, and finally
south for a total of three miles to its mouth on the
Red River. It traverses an area of flat to rolling
terrain with deep, fine sandy loam that supports
brush and various grasses.
The headwaters of the Elm. Fork of the Trinity
River originate in Montague County northwest of
Gainesville. Because it is a rather small stream that
far north, residents of Cooke County refer to it as
Elm Creek. The Elm Fork flows to the south-southeast to join the West Fork of the Trinity River just
west of Dallas. The Trinity River proper begins at
the confluence of the West and Elm Forks and
flows from there southeast to the Gulf of Mexico.
Two reservoirs are present along the Elm Fork. The
upper reaches of Lake Ray Roberts lie within the
southeastern corner of Cooke County. The lake was
constructed by the Fmt Worth District of the U.S.
Army Corps of Engineers in the late 1980s, and
covers approximately 30,000 acres in Denton,
Grayson, and Cooke counties. A few miles downstream in Denton County is Lake Lewisville, similar in size to Lake Ray Roberts, which was constructed by the Fort Worth District of the U.S. Army
Corps of Engineers in the 1950s.

CULTURE HISTORY
Over the years, several cultural periods have
been defined for North Central Texas and adjacent
areas in Oklahoma. Early attempts to define cultural chronology prior to the refinement of radiocarbon dating (Krieger 1946; Stephenson 1952;
Suhm et al. 1954) were based on artifacts recovered
from sites that often contained mixed assemblages
from multiple time periods. As additional sites were
investigated and their components dated more precisely through radiocarbon assay, the earlier constructs had to be redefined. As new kinds of information were collected from archeological sites due
to improved field methods (e.g., flotation to recover charred plant materials) and multidisciplinary
studies designed to understand the paleoenvironment and human ecology, further refinements
were made. Using this new information, Lynott
(1977) and Prikryl (1990) developed somewhat
similar chronologies for North Central Texas. For
the purposes of this study, several of the older chronological schemes are addressed, but Prikry l's 1990
chronology appears to be the most up to date and
most useful for the CCAP.
Paleoindian (pre-8500 B.P.)
When distinctive fluted spear points were found
lying in the midst of mammoth ribs along Blackwater Draw near Clovis, New Mexico, in the 1930s,
archeologists proposed that the Clovis culture was
a big-game hunting culture that specialized in hunting large, now-extinct, Pleistocene animals (Willey
1966:38). Since a different form of fluted spear
point was found near Folsom, New Mexico in association with extinct bison, archeologists proposed
that Clovis culture was succeeded by Folsom culture, which also consisted of bands of nomadic biggame hunters. This belief persisted for much of the
201h century as more and more intact sites of this
age were found in association with the bones of
large extinct species in many different parts of North
America. For example, at the Domebo site in Oklahoma, not far to the north of Cooke County, Clovis
points and tools were recovered in association with
the bones of the Imperial mammoth (Gettys
1984:101).
Most of the information on Paleoindian
occupation in the study area is inferred from surface
finds of projectile points. It is rare to find intact
Paleoindian sites, but two North Central Texas sites

128

Texas Archeological Society

have had important impacts on our understanding
of Clovis culture and subsistence and on the
controversy about the earliest human occupation of
the continent.
One of these sites, the Lewisville site (41DN72)
became famous when excavations by the Dallas
Archaeological Society in the 1950s uncovered a
Clovis point and a hearth that yielded a highly
controversial date of 37,000 B.P. (Crook and Harris 1957). This date was controversial because the
generally accepted date-range for the Paleoindian
period elsewhere extends back no more than ca.
13,500 B.P. Thus, the dates from the Lewisville
site either pushed the dates for Clovis back tremendously, or indicated that Pre-Clovis people had used
the hearth. The rising waters of Lake Lewisville
soon inundated the site and further investigations
were not conducted until 1979, when a drought
exposed the site once again. At that point, the
Smithsonian Institution conducted a study at the site
(Stanford 1982), which showed that the anomalously
early radiocarbon age was due to pieces of lignite
(soft coal of great antiquity) that were found to be
included in the hearth. The carbon from the lignite
apparently had skewed the date. Subsequent geomorphic studies along the Trinity River (Ferring
1986) suggest that the features at the Lewisville site
were not in situ because they occurred at elevations
that correspond with the Coppell Alluvium, which is
much too old to contain Clovis materials buried in
situ (Ferring and Yates 1997:5). Thus, although it
figured prominently in the debate between ClovisFirst and Pre-Clovis theories, the LewisviHe site
proved not to be the result of a Pre-Clovis occupation, or even an intact Clovis occupation.
Perhaps the most important North Central Texas
Paleoindian site was discovered in the spillway of
Lake Ray Roberts when erosion exposed a deeply
buried (ca. 35 ft. below surface) Paleoindian camp.
Named the Aubrey site (41DN479), it was comprised of a cluster of features and artifacts forming
separate camp areas around a pond (Ferring 1989,
1990, 1995, 2001). It yielded substantial information in the form of 23 radiocarbon ages in proper
stratigraphic order, with two charcoal specimens
from a hearth dating the Paleoindian occupation at
around 11,500 years ago, and dates from above and
below the occupation level bracketing it between
12,300 and 10,940 years ago (Ferring 2001). The
site provided an exceptional look at fauna utilized
by the Clovis inhabitants. More than 4000 faunal
remains were recovered, and the variety of fauna

was extraordinary. In addition to large game, such
as bison bones found at a butchering station on the
edge of the pond, the remains of turtles, rodents,
rabbits, squirrels, fish, and bird remains were also
identified. In recent years, many archeologists have
come to view the emphasis placed on the big-game
hunting tradition to the exclusion of other subsistence activities as an artificial construct reflecting
the vagaries of preservation at Clovis-age sites rather
than reality. Indirect evidence supporting this idea
includes edge wear on stone tools that appear to
have been produced by plants. For example, at the
Gault site (41BL323) in Bell County, use-wear studies identified a Clovis blade with the highly developed use-wear signature of grass cutting (Inmann
and Hudler 1998). The faunal data from the Aubrey
site offers direct evidence of the wide variety of
animals utilized by these people. As with many
other Clovis sites, lithic materials for tools, such as
Alibates agatized dolomite and Tecovas quartzite,
were procured from a source area a minimum of
200 km from the site. Ferring noted a lack of redundancy among the various camp areas and suggested
that this is evidence for a flexible and generalized
subsistence system among the Clovis inhabitants
(Ferring 2001:243).
Early Archaic (8500-6000 B.P.)
Little is known about the Early Archaic occupation of the study area because no sites with isolable
Early Archaic components have been identified in
North Central Texas (P1ikryl 1990:69), and the situation to the north in Oklahoma is not much better. At
the Gore Pit site in Oklahoma, several charcoal
stained pits were excavated, two of which yielded
three radiocarbon dates associated with the Early
Archaic period (Hughes 1984: 110). However, Prikryl
(1990:69) notes that no diagnostic points were found
in association with the dated features, and the point
types recovered from the site spanned the Paleoindian
through Late Archaic periods. The Ivan Cox Farm
(41C0183), documented later in this report, is a site
that has had multiple occupations and projectile
points garnered from 30 years of surface collection
present a clearer picture of the variety of types present
in Cooke County. There, Ernie Martin has identified
projectile points types ranging from Paleoindian
through Late Prehistoric sites including several Early
and Middle Archaic types.
Prikryl mapped 22 sites in his study area along
the Elm Fork and its tributaries south of Cooke

Martin-Documenting Archeological Sites in Cooke and Grayson Counties, Texas 129
County that yielded Early Archaic projectile points,
but many were from the surfaces of plowed fields
or from sites mixed with later materials. Most of
those sites had already been destroyed by the time
Prikryl conducted his research, and all of the remaining sites had suffered some degree of damage.
Diagnostic projectile points were primarily Angostura and Early Split-stemmed forms. These points
are extremely similar to those found in Central,
South, and East Texas and in Oklahoma, which
indicates a continuation of a hunter-gatherer subsistence pattern with a high degree of residential
mobility (Prikryl 1990:71).
One key difference between the Early Archaic
deposits and those of preceding Paleoindian populations can be seen in the choice of lithic materials
used to manufacture tools. Whereas most of the
materials found at Paleoindian sites are high quality exotic stone, such as Edwards chert, Alibates
agatized dolomite, and Tecovas quartzite, Archaic
deposits yield tools and lithic debris from local
stone sources. In Oklahoma, Ogallala quartzite is
the most common material used during the Archaic period (Hughes 1984:116), and this material
is also commonly found on sites in the Cooke
County vicinity.
Middle Archaic (6000-3500 B.P.)
Even less is known about the Middle Archaic
occupation of the study area than the Early Archaic
occupation. Only 18 sites with Middle Archaic materials were document by Prikryl (1990:73), and all
of them had been destroyed or inundated, so none
have been closely examined. Pollen from bogs in
Oklahoma suggests that warm arid conditions prevailed during the first part of the period, and that
conditions became moister between 5000 and 4000
years ago. The oak-savanna regime of the Cross
Timbers may have formed during this period
(Prikryl 1990: 71).
Projectile points manufactured during this period were quite different from the Early Archaic
points, shifting from split-stemmed forms to basally
notched and stemmed forms. Large dart points with
two deep basal notches have been found from south
Texas into Oklahoma. These dart points types include Andice, Bell, and Calf Creek. The stemmed
points include types such as Carrollton, Morrill, and
Wells. Wells points have a broad distribution like
the basally notched points, whereas Carrollton and
Morrill points are less widespread (Prikryl 1990:71).

It is during the Middle Archaic period when
regional differences among groups are first recognized by differences in artifact assemblages. Several phase names were created to assign a name to
the traits that were recognized and associated with
a specific region at different points in time. For
example, Crook and Harris (1952) defined the Trinity Aspect of the Archaic period for the area in the
Upper Trinity River watershed using data from 28
floodplain and te1Tace sites found near Dallas. The
Trinity Aspect included the Carrollton focus, marking the Middle Archaic, and the Elam focus, which
encompassed the Late Archaic. Tools attributed to
the Carrollton focus in addition to the Carollton
dart point included Waco sinkers (small cobbles
with notches at each end) and very crude large
quartzite bifaces called Carollton axes. Many projectile point types attributed to these foci have also
been found in Oklahoma (Wykoff 1984:143), so
the geographic limits of the Trinity Aspect were
more far reaching than just the Upper Trinity basin.
However, many of the sites used to define the Trinity Aspect contained mixed deposits of artifacts
from different occupations. Prikryl (1990:73) notes
that Waco sinkers found in East Texas predate the
Middle Archaic, whereas Carrollton axes have been
found in Late Archaic contexts at Wister Phase
sites in Oklahoma.

Late Archaic (3500-1250 B.P.)
Somewhat more is known about the Late Archaic occupation of the region than the earlier occupations because many more sites with Late Archaic diagnostic artifacts have been recorded, and
some well-stratified sites have been excavated and
studied in detail. Prikryl's 1990 study included 66
Late Archaic sites, 35 of which had no signs of
earlier occupation. After analyzing the artifacts from
these sties, he concluded that the projectile points
diagnostic of this period are different from those
assigned to the Late Archaic Elam focus by Crook
and Harris (1952). The Gary dart point was shown
to be the most common type. Moreover, some types
assigned to the Middle Archaic Carrollton focus,
such as Trinity and Dallas points, were relatively
common in the Late Archaic deposits. Other Late
Archaic points included Godley, Ellis, Elam,
Edgewood and Yarbrough (Prikryl 1990:74).
Several reasons for the dramatic increase in
sites during the Late Archaic period have been hypothesized. One obvious possibility is an increase

130

Texas Archeological Society

in population during this period, which could have
been spurred by environmental conditions becoming more favorable for animal and plant species
used by humans, or perhaps a change in subsistence
technology that allowed population growth using
the same resources. Perring (1986) conducted a
geomorphic study along the Trinity and identified
the West Fork Soil at several localities. He noted
that it could have formed due to an increasingly
moist climate. This same paleosol was also observed during the excavations at site 41C0141 and
radiocarbon dates from features above and below it
indicate it formed between roughly 1000 and 1900
years ago, during the latter part of the Late Archaic
period (Perring 1987). This lends support to the
hypothesis that favorable environmental conditions
may have spurred population growth. For example,
as moisture increased the woodlands of the Cross
Timbers would have expanded, creating an increase
in mast production for use by both humans and the
game animals they hunted (Prikryl 1990:74).
Prikryl noted three Elm Fork sites excavated at
Lake Ray Roberts that contained Late Archaic deposits unmixed with artifacts from earlier or later
occupations. At 41DN85 two stone-lined hearths
were reported in association with ground and
chipped stone tools and debitage and at 41DN103
an Elam point was found in association with a hearth
(Skinner et al. 1982; Skinner and Baird 1985). Major excavations by Prikryl at 41C0141, in Cooke
County, produced solid data from a stratified alluvial context where a bridge was being built. Charcoal found in hearths yielded radiocarbon dates,
Late Archaic diagnostic tools were found, and faunal remains were identified.
Late Prehistoric I (1250-750 B.P.)
For a variety of reasons, more information is
available on sites dating to the Late Prehistoric
period than for the previous periods. This is due,
in part, to the fact that environmental processes
stimulating decay of bone and admixture of artifacts have had less time to impact these more
recent deposits. More importantly, greater numbers of artifacts and features are present on Late
Prehistoric sites due to major changes in subsistence practices (such as the introduction of agriculture) that allowed, or perhaps required, longer occupations at each site with a corresponding increase in
the deposition of materials. The adoption of ceramic
technology also accounts for an increased number of

items found in midden contexts. For example, the
use and production of ceramic vessels led to the
creation of numerous pottery sherds when vessels
broke, with some tossed aside in middens and others
remaining near their place of use where they broke.
The increase in overall data from these sites, coupled
with a greater degree of regional diversity in artifact
assemblages and decorative patterns among ceramics, led archeologists to create several new focus/
phase names to organize the information. The Woodland and Plains Village periods of Oklahoma roughly
equate temporally with Prikryl's Late Prehistoric I
and II periods. The cultural constructs within these
periods that are most relevant to Cooke County include the Bryan focus and Washita River phase,
defined by Oklahoma archeologists (Bell and
Baerreis 1951 ), and the Henrietta focus, defined by
Texas archeologist, Alex Krieger (1946).
Prikryl (1990:79) noted evidence for a high
degree of cultural continuity between the Late Archaic and Late Prehistoric I periods, as suggested
by the fact that 34 of the 36 sites in his study area
containing Late Prehistoric I components also had
Late Archaic deposits. Evidence for major technological changes during this period includes the presence of expanding-stemmed, square-stemmed, and
comer-notched arrow points on sites, indicating
adoption of the bow and arrow, and the presence of
pottery sherds, indicating the use of ceramics for
cooking and storage. Charred corncobs and cupules
have been recovered from several sites in the region, demonstrating a shift from complete reliance
on hunting and gathering to some degree of reliance on agriculture.
The Late Prehistoric I period is the first in
which houses are identified, probably reflecting
more substantial construction due to the need to
stay in one place while tending crops. Regional
variation in house design is seen with some houses
visible as circular arrangements of postholes, such
as those found along Mountain Creek in Dallas
County at the Cobb-Pool site (Peter and McGregor
1988) and further to the south at the bird Point
Island site along Richland Creek (Bruseth and Martin 1987), or oval arrangements of postholes, as at
the sites dug along Fish Creek (Lorraine 1969), or
as square arrangements of post holes, like those
found at sites dug at Lake Texoma (Bell and
Baerreis 1951).
At Lake Texoma, data from excavations at the
Marrs site (34Br18) and the Flanagan site on the
Oklahoma side of Lake Texoma near the confluence

Martin-Documenting Archeological Sites in Cooke and Grayson Counties, Texas 131
of the Red and Washita Rivers (Bell and Baerreis
1951) were used to define the Bryan focus. Subsequent salvage excavations at the Boat Dock site (Bell
1958), the James site (Ray 1960), and the Buncombe
Creek site (Wykoff 1964) yielded similar assemblages and were also assigned to the Bryan focus.
Bryan focus houses were square, possibly with
rounded comers, and had four center posts, a central
hearth, and an extended entrance way. The Bryan
focus, however, is one of the early attempts to organize the data that needs to be updated. Story (1990)
and McGregor (n.d.) both find many problems with
the Bryan focus. For example, although flexed burials were uncovered at two of the Bryan focus sites,
Story (1990:358) notes that many, if not most, of
these interments are probably related to earlier Archaic or Woodland components. Storey states that
the Bryan focus, "requires major restudy and rethinking" due to the mixture of dart and arrow points
and ceramic types included in the assemblage.
McGregor (n.d.) proposes three temporal
subperiods of the Late Prehistoric period for North
Central Texas that he also applies to the Lake
Texoma area. The two most recent of these
subperiods are represented at four sites: Haley's
Point-Area F (34Mal5) and Treasure Island
(34Mal50) along the Red River at Lake Texoma,
the Dillard site (41C0174) upstream at the
confluence of the Red River and Fish Creek, and
the Currie site (34Gv22) upstream on the Washita
River. Area F at Haley's Point yielded Alba and
Bonham arrow points and five of the six radiocarbon dates from the house structure fall within the
A.D.1200-1300 range. Similarly, at the Currie site
(34Gv22) 54 rectangular-stem arrow points that
could be classified as Alba and Bonham were found,
and a house was uncovered that probably dates
between A.D.1020 and A.D.1310 (Drass 1997:59).
These sites contain components that McGregor assigns to his middle subperiod (ca. A.D.1000-1300),
which roughly corresponds with the latter part of
Prikry1' s Late Prehistoric I period.
Along Fish Creek, the only drainage completely
within the Cooke County project area, some interesting sites have been investigated that appear to
have Late Prehistoric I Period components with
some admixture of Late Prehistoric II materials.
Dessamae Lorraine (1969) from Southern Methodist University investigated these sites prior to the
construction of Fish Creek Reservoir (Moss Lake)
in the mid-1960s. Evidence of five oval to circular
structures were uncovered that Lorraine believed

dated between A.D. 850 and 1000. Substantial
samples of Nocona Plain ceramics and other
Henrietta focus artifacts were also found, but the
late arrow point types Harrell, Washita, and Fresno,
which are commonly associated with the Henrietta
focus, were rare in these assemblages. Instead,
specimens of earlier Eddy arrow points were found
(Prikryl 1990:29). Brack's (2000:196) recent examination of the Fish Creek ceramics indicates that
the Nocona Plain sherds are tempered with a mixture of fossil shell and fresh shell. Interestingly,
Lorraine had uncovered a cache of fossil shell at
site 41C05, and it may have been intended for later
use as ceramic temper.

Late Prehistoric II (750-250 B.P.)
Prikryl (1990:79) obtained a date of 1060Â±50
B.P. at site 41C0141 just above the West Fork
paleosol, which he believes dates the beginning of
a drying trend that continued into the Late Prehistoric II period. A change to a drier climate would
have caused the demarcation line between short
grass prairies to the west and tall grass prairies to
the east (and woodlands in the Cross Timbers and
areas further to the east) to change over time, with
an increase in short grass prairie. Since bison prefer
short grass prairies, they were most likely to be
present in the region during drier periods. Lynott
(1979) conducted an interesting study of bison bone
recovered from sites in North Central Texas in
which he concluded that herds of bison were not
common in the region untilÂ· after A.D. 1200. Further archeological evidence for the presence of bison and changes in subsistence practices during the
Late Prehistoric II period has been found at several
sites in Texas and Oklahoma, including the presence of bison scapula hoes and charred corn. Sites
in the vicinity of Cooke County that date to this
period are similar to Plains Village sites found to
the north, west, and southwest.
The Henrietta focus, which extends over a broad
area along the Salt Fork and Clear Fork of the
Brazos River north to the Red River and east to
Dallas, is the southernmost example of Plains
Village culture. Krieger (1946) defined the Henrietta
focus on the basis of excavations at the Harrell site
at the confluence of the Salt Fork and Clear Fork of
the Brazos River in Young County, Texas. There,
in deep sediments extending down 25 ft., remains
of a prehistoric village and traces of earlier Indian
camps were found. As with the Bryan focus and

132

Texas Archeological Society

other early foci, the definition of the Henrietta focus
included a mix of early and late materials. However,
most of the materials related to a Late Prehistoric II
period village with a distinctive assemblage of shelltempered pottery, basally and side-notched
triangular arrow points (Harrell and Washita points),
bison-scapula hoes, handheld mussel tools,
diamond-shaped beveled knives (also called fourbeveled knives), hide scrapers, and small drills.
The assemblage shares many similarities with Plains
Village Washita River phase assemblages. The
Washita River phase is a northern Plains Village
adaptation with an economy centered on bison
hunting and horticulture along the Washita and
Canadian River valleys in south-central Oklahoma.
Washita River phase assemblages are dated to
broadly A.D. 1200-1500 (Brack 2000:14) and may
date mainly between A.D. 1300-1450 according to
Drass (1997).
Within the Cooke County project area, the
Dillard Site (41C0174) is the best-reported site
with a Late Prehistoric II period component with
Henrietta focus materials (Martin 1994). Recorded
and excavated by Ernie Martin on land owned by
Dutch Dillard and Don Monroe, the site is strategically situated on a ridge overlooking Fish Creek at
the point where it enters the Red River floodplain
(about 1.5 miles downstream from the dam at Moss
Lake). The Dillard Site yielded tremendous data on
a Plains Village occupation that included bellshaped storage pit features and several bone tools,
including bison bone digging tools. Charred corncobs indicate that maize was an important constituent of the diet.
Bone preservation was excellent and 13 burials
were uncovered at the site, including a mass grave
containing five individuals (Martin 1994). Evidence
of copper was detected on one skull fragment, and
an unusual whelk shell gorget in the shape of a
human hand was found in association with Burial 2.
Other than maiine shell beads and the gorget, no
artifacts were clearly associated with the human remains. The shell objects may simply have been attached to the clothing of the deceased as opposed to
formal grave offerings (Martin 1994). The Dillard
site was part of an extensive trade network as evidenced by the wide variety of lithic material coming
from as far away as Arkansas, Central Texas, and
perhaps New Mexico as indicated by an obsidian
Washita point. The copper could come from the far
west or perhaps as far north as the Great Lakes and
the whelk shell gorget came from the Gulf coast.

Large quant1t1es of shell tempered Nocona
Plain pottery were recovered. In addition to
Nocona Plain pottery, Caddoan trade pottery from
the both the Sanders and Titus phases in East
Texas was recovered. Brack (2000: 197) points out
that Ernie Martin found a cluster of fossilized oyster shells at the Dillard site and he believes that
fossil shell was used to temper pottery at that site
as it was just upstream at the Fish Creek sites
excavated in the 1960s.
Although the entire span of site occupation is
estimated to fall between approximately A.D. 1150
and 1350, most of the recovered material dates to
the latter half of this range. Charcoal from a soil
layer separating two superimposed burials yielded
a corrected date of 680Â±110 BP and charcoal near
the bottom of a bell-shaped pit yielded a corrected
date of 622Â±58 BP. Most of the arrow points were
serrated Washita points and Fresno points, and although some Sanders phase ceramics (ca. A.D. 8001200) were noted, most of the ceramics were later
types such as Nocona Plain and Titus phase
Caddoan wares (ca. 1200-1500). The Dillard site
contains a minimally mixed deposit that McGregor
assigns to his late subperiod.
The serrated Washita points appear to be
common in the Red River vicinity, but there are
no precise dates associated with them. McGregor
(n.d.) notes that the Treasure Island site
(34Mal50) downstream from the Cooke County
project area offers a unique opportunity to obtain radiocarbon dates associated with the serrated Washita point type. There, an assemblage
of 22 serrated Washita arrow points came from
the fill of a multiple-burial pit (Baugh et al.
2002). If some of the bone could be submitted
for radiocarbon assay, it may be possible to place
this type in a more precise time frame.
On a final note regarding significant changes
over time, Prikryl documents an interesting trend
with respect to the raw materials selected for the
manufacture of projectile points in his study area.
The use of chert and quartzite exhibit an inverse
relationship over time, with quartzite use increasing
steadily from Paleoindian through the Late Archaic
periods as chert use declined. Then, beginning in
the Late Prehistoric I period, chert again increased
gradually as quartzite use declined by about the
same amount until in the Late Prehistoric II period
the ratio of chert to quartzite in tools was about the
same as that observed for Middle Archaic sites.
(Prikryl 1990:64). The vast majority of quartzite

COOKE COUNTY HISTORY
The Red River was one of the first rivers
encountered by Spanish explorers in Texas. In 1541
Coronado explored the upper reaches of the Prairie
Dog Town Fork of the Red River in Palo Duro and
Tule canyons far to the west of Cooke County. In
1542, Moscoso crossed the Red River in Louisiana
and on into East Texas (Bruseth and Kenmotsu
1993). In 1690 Domingo Teran de los Rfos reached
the Red River at the Caddo Indian settlements near
present Texarkana (Kleiner 1996). However, the first
Europeans known to have visited the Cooke County
vicinity were members of the Pedro Vial expedition
who camped on the banks of the Elm Fork near
present day Gainesville on June 30, 1788 as they
traveled east to Natchitoches (Collins 1981:4).
The first Anglo settlers in the region arrived in
the 1840s, when it was part of the newly created
Peters colony. Settlers were offered 640 acres for
each head of a family with 320 acres for each single
man, plus land for a church in each settlement (Minor 1996a:47). In 1847, Fort Fitzhugh (see 41C04)
was built east of the Elm Fork of the Trinity River
about three miles southeast of Gainesville. The fort
was constructed by a company of Texas Rangers
from McKinney in nearby Collin County. It was
commanded by Colonel William F. Fitzhugh, and
consisted of a small log stockade with a single row
of blockhouses and a stable. The fort served as a
temporary camp from which patrols were sent to
protect settlers from Indian raids. Although the first
settlement in Cooke County grew up around the
fort, the fort was abandoned by 1850 when
Gainesville became the county seat (Minor
1996b:l 101).
In 1850 Gainesville was established on a 40acre tract donated by Mary E. Clark in the county's
approximate geographic center. The town was
named in honor of General Edmund Pendleton
Gaines, a United States general under whom Colonel Fitzhugh had served. The original town consisted of three families living in log houses near the
banks of Elm Creek, but by 1858 Gainesville was
made a stop on the Butterfield Overland Mail.
An important event known as "The Great Hanging" took place during the Civil War in Gainesville,
when forty suspected Unionists were hanged and
two others were shot as they tried to escape. Men

were also killed in neighboring Grayson, Wise, and
Denton counties. Few had actually conspired against
the Confederacy, and many were innocent of the
abolitionist sentiments for which they were tried
(Mccaslin 1996:309).
Cooke and the surrounding counties voted
against secession and a secret fraternal organization, the Union League, was formed in Cooke and
nearby counties (Collins 1981:11). Most men joined
to resist the draft and provide common defense
against Indians and renegades, but rumors began to
circulate of plans for an assault on Gainesville and
Sherman. When General William Hudson ordered
the arrest of all able-bodied men who failed to
report for Confederate military duty, Texas state
troops, led by Colonel. James G. Bourland, arrested
more than 150 men on the morning of October 1,
1862 (Mccaslin 1996:309).
Colonel Bourland and Colonel William C.
Young convened a citizen's court of twelve jurors,
including seven slaveholders (none of the men arrested owned slaves). The jury condemned seven
influential Unionists, but an angry mob took matters
into its own hands and lynched 14 more men before
the jurors recessed. The following week Colonel
Young was assassinated, which prompted a retrial of
the prisoners. Nineteen more men were convicted
and hanged. Elsewhere in North Central Texas, five
men were hung in Sherman, five were hung in
Decatur, and one prisoner was shot in Denton in
response to the supposed Unionist plot.
These events had far reaching effects as articles
from the Texas press were reprinted across the South.
As a result of this negative publicity, an embarrassed
President Jefferson Davis abandoned his demand for
an inquiry into a similar incident involving northern
troops in Palmyra, Missouri. The northern press heralded the story as another example of Rebel barbarism (Mccaslin 1996:310). Perhaps the only remaining physical evidence marking this event is the headstone of Nathaniel W. Clark in the Clark Cemetery
near Wolf Creek (Figure 4).
After the Civil War, Gainesville grew extensively as it became a major supply point for cowboys when the cattle industry expanded. The
Chisholm Trail became the major route out of Texas
for livestock from 1867 to 1884. Joseph G. McCoy,
of Illinois, persuaded Kansas Pacific Railroad officials to lay a siding at the hamlet of Abilene, Kansas, where he built pens and loading facilities. In
1864, Jesse Chisholm began hauling trade goods to
Indian camps about 220 miles south of his post

134

Railway was constructed, making the town a
shipping point for ranchers and farmers (Minor
1996a:47). The high price of cotton allowed
Gainesville to survive the disappearance of the cattle
drives, and the discovery of oil in the mid-1920s
helped the town survived the Great Depression
better than similar communities. In the 1930s,
Gainesville became home to the Gainesville
Community Circus, which eventually gained a
national reputation. Shortly after the United States
entered World War II, Camp Howze was constructed west of town as an infantry-training center.
The influx of approximately 10,000 troops
temporarily doubled the local population. After
World War II Gainesville's population grew
steadily, surpassing 10,000 in the mid-1950s and
14,000 by the late 1980s. In the early 1990s
Gainesville had 600 businesses and a population of
14,587 (Minor 1996a:47).

near modem Wichita. In 1867, the first cattle drive
from Texas to McCoy's facilities discovered
Chisolm's wagon tracks near the North Canadian
River and followed them into Abilene. Eventually,
the entire trail from the Rio Grande to central Kansas was named after Chisolm (Worchester 1996:89).
The cattle did not follow a clearly defined trail
except at river crossings; when dozens of herds
were moving north it was necessary to spread them
out to find grass. After trailing techniques were
perfected, a trail boss, ten cowboys, a cook, and a
horse wrangler could trail 2,500 cattle three months
for sixty to seventy-five cents a head. This was far
cheaper than shipping by rail. Between 1871, when
Abilene ceased to be a cattle market, and 1884 the
trail might end at Ellsworth, Junction City, Newton, Wichita, or Caldwell in southern Kansas. The
Western Trail by way of Fort Griffin and Doan's
Store ended at Dodge City. The Chisholm Trail
was finally closed by barbed wire and an 1885
Kansas quarantine law (Worchester 1996:89).
In 1886, the Santa Fe line reached Gainesville
and in 1887 the Gainesville, Henrietta and Western

As noted in the introduction, this project was
not a traditional archeological survey in the sense
that investigators spent a lot of time searching for
sites. Avocational archeologists led the crew to the
sites and arranged meetings with collectors who
had recovered artifacts from these sites. The project
goals were to record and map as many sites as
possible within the four-day window allotted, to
photograph avocational collections if the artifact
proveniences were known (Figure 5), and to record
any additional sites that might be found in the vicinity of the sites reported by the avocationals.
Methods of examining each site differed depending
on whether or not the landowner granted permission to dig shovel tests and collect artifacts. The
individual site descriptions discuss the methods used
to record each site.
In general, the survey methods included shovel
tests, roughly 30 cm in diameter, excavated in 10cm levels and screened through 1/4-inch mesh, combined with general surface collections of diagnostic
artifacts. All sites were photographed with color
slide film and black and white film, and site sketch
maps were made using the pace and compass technique. All features and diagnostic artifacts were
also photographed. State of Texas site forms were
completed for each site. At the Sivells Bend site
(41C0159), the crew also back filled a large pothole after photographing and drawing the profiles,

to keep it from eroding into a much bigger hole.
Wherever possible, the crew examined cut banks
and similar areas of ground exposure adjacent to
sites to search for features and artifacts eroding out
(Figure 6).

SURVEY RESULTS
The fieldwork progressed as follows. On Tuesday, November 14, Ona B. Reed took the crew to
visit Thurman Ward at his home in Sivells Bend.
He showed us his collection from several sites in
the County, including a well preserved wooden bow
(125 cm long) found in a cave near Lake Texoma.
We took a few photographs of his collection, but
most of the material was unprovenienced. He led us
to the Sivells Bend site (41C0159) and told us as
much about it as he could remember. The entire
crew spent most of the day recording the Sivells
Bend site, which includes the Dillard Cemetery. At
the end of the day, the crew stopped to examine a
hilltop overlooking the river that was reported to
Ernie Martin as the site of either a Spanish outpost

or an 1840s blockhouse. However, only a few pieces
of 20th century milled lumber, a couple of tested
quartzite cobbles and natural blocks of limestone
on a limestone outcrop were found. About 200 m
out into the pasture a masonry cattle trough was
present. We did not record this location as a site.
On Wednesday, November 15, the crew members split into two crews. Wayne Bartholomew
led a crew that visited sites at Lake Texoma that
Ernie Martin knew about, while Bill Martin took a
crew with Ona B. Reed to visit sites in far western
Cooke County. The Texoma crew recorded sites
41C0181 and 41GS114 and examined two areas
of shoreline where sites had been previously noted,
but found only a single quartzite flake along one
stretch of beach. The other crew recorded sites
41C0175 and 41C0177.
On Thursday morning, November 16, Ernie
Martin took the entire crew to the site of Fort
Fitzhugh (41C04). After recording the site, the
Texoma crew returned to Lake Texoma and recorded sites 41GS23, 41GS115, and 41C0182. The
other crew recorded one more site in the Elm Fork
drainage (41CO178) before moving on to sites on

confluence of Redmond Creek and the
Elm Fork. A company of Texas Rangers, whose main foti was at McKinney
in Collin County, used it as a temporary
base for launching patrols to the north
and west. The fort reportedly consisted
of a small log stockade with a single
row of blockhouses and a stable (Minor
1996b: 1101). However, an article in the
Gainesville Daily Register, dated August
29, 1950, states that, "Heavy rocks which
lie in such abundance over the hill which
formed the foundation for the fort, still
suggest the outlines, although many have
been removed and others displaced." According to this article, Fitzhugh was born
in Kentucky in 1818 and moved to Missouri as a child. He fought under General Edmund Pendleton Gaines in the
Florida war (Second Seminole War
1835-1842) and also fought in the Mormon war (1838), that removed Mormons
from the state of Missouri. He came to
Texas in 1845 and established a plantation at McKinney, but left to fight in the
Mexican War ( 1846-1848) before establishing a camp along Elm Creek in 1846
where Fort Fitzhugh was built in 1847.
At that time he held the rank of captain;

The first settlement in Cooke County grew up

Finally, on Friday, November 17, Robert Brooks,

Oklahoma State Archeologist, accompanied the

crew to Ernie Martin's Gainesville office to view

Colonel Fitzhugh who suggested that it be named
his collection. The remainder of the day was spent
Gainesville in honor of General Gaines, whom he

to the Army Library at the Pentagon, the Library of
Congress, the Great Plains Historical Association,
and museums and military historians at various universities trying to find out whether or not the fort
was originally built as a US military fort. She also
attempted to find maps of the fort and records on
the personnel stationed there, although no such
records could be found. She then wrote to Curtis
Tunnell, State Archeologist at the Texas State Building Commission (later subsumed under the Texas
State Historical Survey Committee in 1969, which
ultimately became the Texas Historical Commission in 1973), suggesting that the fort would make
a good State Park. Curtis assigned his assistant,
Harald P. Jensen, to contact Ms. Hays and investigate the site. THC files also contain several letters
from Jensen to the landowners, Ms. Hays, and participants in the excavations.
Fulton Murray, Jr., who owned the site in 1968,
allowed Jensen to conduct archeological excavations in June of 1968. Work was conducted with
some assistance from avocational archeologist R.K.
Harris, and Dessamae Lorraine, the Southern Methodist University (SMU) archeologist who had conducted excavations at sites along Fish Creek prior
to the inundation of Fish Creek Reservoir (Moss
Lake). Local teenage volunteers, including Ernie
Martin, provided the bulk of the labor for these
excavations.
The only written information readily available
regarding the actual excavation is a brief and uninformative site form prepared by Jensen. The site
form lists the area of occupation as 50 square meters
and the condition of the site as "excavated and
refilled." Apparently, these site dimensions refer
only to the portion of the site where two blocks
were excavated, rather than the entire fort area. The
article in the Gainesville Daily Register infers that
the fort was about 40 ft. long and laid out with a
southeast to northwest orientation based on "the
rocks which formed the foundation for the walls."
Jensen described the matrix as black clayey silt and
the artifacts recovered included "ceramics, glass,
metal, bone and a few Indian artifacts."
In 1969, Mr. Murray constructed a home in the
vicinity of the fort, and the entire area that had been
excavated by Jensen was bulldozed. Several artifacts
were collected from the smface by Mr. Murray and
photographs were sent to Jensen to assist in the
preparation of a report on the excavations. Some of
Jensen's 1969 letters indicate that he was in the
process of preparing a report, but no such document

has been found in the THC files. Artifacts from the
excavation are curated at TARL, but it appears that
a report was never produced.
In 1989, Jack Crozier owned the site and he
graciously allowed us to conduct a surface examination along roads, gullies, and other disturbed areas. As previously mentioned, Ernie Martin had
worked on Jensen's crew in 1968 and was able to
point out the exact locations of the two block excavations that had been placed over two separate structures. Block 1 was a rectangle measuring 5 x 2 m.
Four foundation stones from a fireplace uncovered
in excavation unit #13 during the 1968 excavations
were observed along with foundation stones from a
wall adjacent to the fireplace at the southern end of
the block. Three metal arrow points were reportedly recovered from this block in 1968. Block 2
formed an ell, with a 3 x 2 m rectangle that had an
additional 1 x 1 m unit added to one side. There,
two boulders from walls of a separate structure
uncovered in excavation unit #2 were observed.
This description of the second block varies from
a more recent (2003) sketch map prepared by Ernie
Martin (Figure 7), which shows Block II as a larger
block than originally described, consisting of 13
units with foundation stones uncovered in the center of the block. The map also shows the relationship of the excavation units to each other and to the
original and current positions of the marker placed
at the site in 1948, which had been placed directly
over fireplace stones. The map reveals that fireplace stones were uncovered in the southwest corner of the 5 x 2 m Block I, along with the three
metal arrow points arranged in a linear fashion along
what may have been a wall.
The crew conducted a general surface collection and obtained several items that are likely related to the occupation of the fort, including some
refined earthenware and stoneware, and some metal
items. Table 1 lists all of the artifacts collected and
several are illustrated in Figure 8. The ceramics
most likely to have been deposited during the brief
occupation of the fort include four very small sherds
of flow blue china manufactured between 18351900 (Williams 1981:7), and a sherd of transferprinted earthenware with a green floral design on a
white background that appears to be most similar to
patterns manufactured between ca.1815 and 1850,
as identified in Pollan et al. (1996). A smaller piece
of transfer-printed ware with a black vegetative
motif on a light blue to violet background probably
dates to this period, but it is too small to positively

identify. Four badly eroded/burned light green
sherds (three from the same vessel) may be decorated with a hand-painted design, which was common in the 1840s and 50s, but the design is nearly
obliterated due to the bad preservation. Two light
green salt-glazed exterior/plain-glazed interior
stoneware sherds were also collected that appear
typical of specimens manufactured around 1850
(Greer 1981). A sherd of blue shell-edged ware
with a smooth rim was recovered, along with a
small sherd displaying part of a foot ring that may
be from the same vessel, judging from the faint
blue tint in the glaze. However, this smooth-rim
style dates later than the fort occupation, becoming
most common around 1875. Two small whiteware
sherds, a small sherd that was light blue on one side
and white on the other, and a yellow creamware
sherd were also recovered, but these types of ceramics were commonly in use over such a long
period that they cannot be used for precise dating.
Five machine-cut square nails may date to the
fort occupation, but they could also date as recently
as the early 1900s. Two pieces of aqua-colored
bottle glass, probably from patent medicine or

extract bottles, probably postdate the fort occupation
since they were more common in late 19th century.
A few small unidentifiable iron fragments were
found and one linear iron object about the size of a
tableware knife was found, but it cannot be
positively identified. The most unusual item
collected was a rectangular flat piece of iron with
four identical nail or screw holes punched in the
four corners, a large (ca. 3 cm) hole near the middle
of the piece, but offset to one side, and one small
roughly rectangular hole half way between the large
hole and one of the corner holes (see Table 1). This
may be part of a latch for a trunk or a door, but no
positive identification could be made. Obvious later
intrusive artifacts include a fragment of bakelite, a
plastic which was patented in the early 1900s and is
still in use today, and an object that appears to have
been a flat six-pointed star-shaped piece of
aluminum that was bent in half as if to form a
clamp of some type.
We also examined the knoll across the draw
where an 1830s gun barrel was reportedly found
during bulldozing to construct the barn that stands
there today. We did not find any historic material,

are a result of modern metal such as nails and
fence staples and entire fence lines. The 1968
excavation blocks are visible as large black spots
on either side of the series of linear anomalies
that represent T-posts from a new fence. Given
the fact that the original fort area has been
partially excavated and then subsequently
bulldozed, and that the surrounding area has been
an active ranch for many years, it seems unlikely
that very much remains to study archeologically
at this site.

Bulldozing for house and barn constrnction undoubtedly disturbed the site, especially the main
area that was excavated by Jensen, but it seemed
that that some portion of the archeological component might be relatively intact. Based on the surface distribution of artifacts, site size is estimated
to be at least 55 x 15 m (artifacts extended into
areas with poor ground surface visibility). The actual fort location was roughly 100 m west of the
point labeled "Site of Fort Fitzhugh" on the USGS
Woodbine 7 .5' quadrangle.
In August of 2003, at the request of Ona B.
Reed, the THC made a final attempt to better
define Fort Fitzhugh. Using an extremely
sensitive Cesium magnetometer to generate a
map of magnetic anomalies across the site, the
THC hoped to identify walls and other historic
features by their magnetic signatures. Although

The Sivells Bend Site is situated along the
edge of an alluvial terrace composed of sandy
loam overlying sandy clay that lies about 50 feet
above the Red River floodplain. The river once
abutted up against this terrace, but not necessarily
during the period when the site was occupied.
South of the alluvial terrace are hills rising another 150 feet in elevation, forming a series of
breaks dissected by small streams. The site is extremely large, measuring approximately 1250 x
250 m. In 1989, one third of the site was an old
field covered with grasses and weeds, one third
was plowed, and one third was pasture covered
with Coastal Bermuda grass (Figure 9). Thurman
Ward owned the eastern two thirds of the site and
a Mrs. Martin owned the western third planted in
Coastal Bermuda grass.
Mr. Ward led the crew out to this site and
provided as much information as he could
remember about the site, which was considerable,
since he grew up on the site in a house that used to
stand close to the site's center (near the outbuilding
shown on the Marietta West Okla.-Tex. 7.5'
quadrangle). He searched the fields for arrowheads
as a boy in the 1920s and 1930s. He stated that
when the old field had first been plowed, he
observed four or five (or perhaps as many as eight)
possible houses that appeared as dark circular
stains (probable middens) .. He described one of
the houses as a series of circular charcoal stains,
20-30 cm in diameter, arranged in a circular pattern
that was 3-m in diameter or greater. He also
pointed to a rise at the far eastern end of the site
(about 80 m northwest of the possible house
patterns) and said it contained the remains of a
structure. He had recently excavated the center of

Figure 10. The author points out the baked clay and ash lens exposed in the wall of Mr. Ward's excavation.

The North profile was especially interesting.
It revealed the hearth in profile, which appeared

as an 18-cm-thick orange (burned) clay containing two distinct ash lenses at the bottom. Five
relatively large pieces of ashy burned clay, measuring about .3 cm in thickness, were collected
from the North wall. This is also the only profile
that suggests that an earlier building episode occurred, as evidenced by a less distinct clay lens at
a depth of 75 cm below surface. Although this
lens is somewhat ephemeral, its presence suggests
long-term occupation of this area with multiple
building episodes. It appears that this area was
built up through the intentional addition of fill,
rather than by natural means.
The floor of Mr. Ward's excavation measured
approximately 2. 7 m x 1.5 m. Of this, an area measuring 1.5 m x 0.5 m was scraped clean and mapped
in plan view. The plan revealed a possible posthole
near the north wall and, 60 cm to the south, a large
pit feature was exposed. Assuming the feature was
symmetrical, it would have formed an oval measuring about 100 cm NS x 90 cm EW. One light gray
fine quartzite flake was collected from the floor.
After recording observations in the "House Mound"

Area, the crew backfilled the hole to keep it from
eroding into a much bigger hole.
The Plowed Field
The central third of the. Sivells Bend site had
been plowed and recently planted in wheat.
Ground surface visibility was excellent. Some
burned cobbles were observed in plowed field,
along with a light scatter of lithic debris, but no
diagnostic artifacts were found. Mr. Ward indicated that nothing significant had ever been found
in this field.
The Pasture
The western third of the Sivells Bend site, on
the Martin property, was planted in Coastal
Bermuda grass. After securing permission to dig
from Mrs. Martin, we excavated two shovel tests.
No artifacts were recovered from the first test, which
was excavated in the vicinity where Mr. Ward
remembered a burial being uncovered in the 1920s
or 30s. Despite the fact that Mr. Ward remembers
this area as having an artifact concentration equal

144

to that present at the eastern end of the site, only
two flakes were recovered from the plow zone in
the second test, and one burned rock was noted.
The soil was described as a brown sandy loam from
surface to 30 cm overlying a more compact reddish
silty loam from 30-50 cm.

meter high. In 1989, a few crypts remained pretty
much intact, but some exhibited large cracks. Several grave markers include a late-19th century dove
motif, and one relatively modern grave was observed with the name "Allen" inscribed on the headstone. Due to time constraints, the crew was unable
to map the cemetery, although several photographs
were taken.

The Dillard Cemetery
The Dillard Cemetery (not shown on the
Marietta West Okla.-Tex. 7.5' quadrangle) is situated in a roughly rectangular patch of forest in the
far northeastern corner of the Sivells Bend site (it
was not assigned a separate trinomial). It is situated
along the edge of the terrace overlooking the Red
River floodplain to the north and a spring-fed tributary to the east. The spring still flows just to the
south of the cemetery. Dutch Dillard once owned
this property, and Mr. Ward stated that he has always known it as the Dillard Cemetery. The most
noteworthy characteristic of the cemetery is the
presence of masonry crypts made of mortared stone
and mortared brick (Figure 11). These crypts measure about 3 meters long, 1.5 meters wide, and 1

Artifacts from the Sivells Bend Site
Three distinct kinds of pottery were observed
on this site. One type exhibits pores where some
type of calcareous temper has leached out of the
paste (Figurel2b). Only one sherd of this type was
observed. It may have been shell-tempered, but
doesn't quite look like most leached shell tempered
ceramics the author has observed elsewhere. It has
a core and exterior color of light brown (7.5YR6/
4) and an interior color of slightly darker grayish
brown (7.5YR6/2). Then there are a few sherds that
have no easily visible temper, but may contain small
bits of grog. These are characterized by an exterior
color of grayish brown (ranging from 10YR7/4 to

10YR4/2) and a very dark grayish brown (10YR3/
2) interior color. One of these sherds had the
curvature indicative of the neck of a water bottle, or
possibly even that of a pipe bowl. No decorated
sherds were observed.
Finally, numerous shell-tempered sherds were
recovered from shovel test N-1, all of which appear
to be from the same vessel. These sherds exhibit a
high density of crushed shell in- the paste and appear to be typical of the type Nocona Plain (see
Figure 12a). Most were fired in a reducing atmosphere and have a dark gray (1 OYR3/2) interior
color, a very dark gray (10YR3/1) core color and a
dark brown (7.5YR4/4) exterior color. Two appear
to have been oxidized and have a lighter exterior
color (extending half way through the core) of
10YR6/4. They are all extremely friable and
crumble easily when handled. There are several
small sherdlets (sherds measuring less than l cm in

diameter) in the collection that are not included in
the counts presented in Table 2 because most appear to have broken off of the larger sherds in the
bag after the field collection was made.
The fire-cracked rock is comprised mostly of
friable sandstone and quartzite cobbles. The flakes
recovered include a wide variety of cherts and finegrained quartzites, such as Ogallala quartzite, in a
variety of colors. All of these materials would have
been present locally in gravel deposits along the
Red River.
The only identifiable bones recovered were a
small bird bone and a deer tooth found in shovel
test N-1 and a probable bison vertebra found in the
wall of Mr. Ward's excavations. Shovel test N-1
also contained other small unidentifiable bone fragments in an excellent state of preservation. About
half the bone was unburned, and the other half was
charred or calcined.

Summary
This site has outstanding research potential, especially the eastern third in the old field where the
"House Mound" Area occurs. Only a sparse scatter
of burned rock and flakes were found in the central
third (plowed field) along with the remains of the
house in which Mr. Ward grew up along the western edge of this field. Because the western third
was in pasture, the crew was unable to learn much
about it, but Mr. Ward reports that it contains an
artifact concentration similar to that found at the
eastern end of the site.

41C0175, the Grady McElreath Site
Ona B. Reed led us to this site, which is named
for its owner, Mr. Grady McElreath. She had worked
at the site on March 29, 1969 with Jerry Humphries,
a graduate student at SMU who recorded the site
and conducted a surface collection with several
avocational archeologists as part of an archeology
class. She provided a copy of his sketch map and a
site form. Humphries' sketch map and site form list
the site as X41C01, which denotes the old SMU
site recording system. Despite the U.T. site form, it
appears that the site was not recorded with TARL
until after the THC site visit in 1989, since no
trinomial had been assigned and no site was plotted
on T ARL maps in this location.
The site lies approximately 1.2 miles north
northeast of the town of Illinois Bend. Although it
falls within Cooke County, the western edge of
the site appears to be less than 100 m from the
Montague County line. It is situated on a high
terrace overlooking the Red River floodplain about
80-100 feet below. The Red River is about a half
mile north of the site, but the nearest natural water
occurs within an intermittent stream along Southeast side of site. The headwaters of this stream
begin as extremely ephemeral shallow draws
within the plowed field where the site is located.
Southeast of the site area, about 100 m from main
rise, the stream becomes deeply entrenched to a
depth of 15-20 ft. and flows due east out to the
floodplain. Part of the crew walked down into the
steep stream valley looking for cut banks or erosional areas along the steep slope up to the site.
Although some great exposures more than 3 m in
depth were observed extending down to weathered shale bedrock, no cultural materials or midden
stains were observed.

The site area encompasses at least 300 x 200 m,
with the main rise that contains the densest concentration of cultural materials covering an area of about
118 x 208 m. The site had been plowed and planted
in winter wheat, but ground surface visibility was
only fair (estimated at 40-50 percent) because the
lack ofrain created dry, dusty conditions in the sandy
loam. No artifacts were collected from this site.
Artifacts indicative of Late Prehistoric period
occupation (pottery) and probable Archaic period
occupation were found in 1969. It is difficult to
determine period of occupation from Humphries'
site form because it simply lists projectile points
without specifying arrows or darts. However, Ona
B. Reed remembered collecting some arrow points
in 1969, and these are probably the "small projectile points" listed in Table 3. Mr. Ward also knew
of arrow points being found on the site. The 1969
crew collected metate fragments, projectile points
(sometimes listed as large or small, but only one
specified as a dart point), sherds, hammerstones,
scrapers, a knife, and burned bone fragments
(Table 3). The I 989 crew observed burned rocks,
fragments of manos, and lithic debris in a light
scatter about the site. Most lithic debris was a
coarse white quartzite, but some yellow siltstone
or chert from river cobbles was observed along
with some red mottled chert. No pottery or cultural features were observed during the 1989 visit,
but in 1969, Ona B. Reed noted an oval area south
of the main rise that was stained. This stain probably represents a midden or house area. She also
noted a bone concentration between the main rise
and the stained area.
Conditions were so poor during the 1989 visit
that it is difficult to assess the nature of this site.
Reportedly, many people have collected this site
over many years, so the quantity of diagnostic material remaining is undoubtedly diminished. However, the site appears to have some potential for
addressing Archaic and Late Prehistoric occupation, based on the 1969 work.

41C0176, the Warrens Bend Site
This site is situated south of Warrens Bend on
the Red River along an alluvial terrace adjacent to
Blue Hollow, a permanent tributary (Figure 13).
Blue Hollow trends north-south along most of its
course, but used to turn abruptly and run east-west
from this site out to the Red River. However, it
now takes a slight jog to the east and then runs

north-south as a result of channel diversion in the
1920s. After a concrete dam was constructed in the
original channel about 80 m east of the present
diversion channel, the original channel silted in.
The diversion channel was directed north-south
along the property line and it bisects the site. Today
the site lies in fields of silty loam on both sides of
the channel. From the look of the topography and a
midden eroding out of the creek banks, it appears
that some of the best portions of the site were removed when the creek was diverted. In 1989, Don
Monroe owned the eastern half of the site and
Melvin Trammel owned the western half. The southern boundary was not clearly determined, but it is
somewhere in the forest beneath the colluvium along
the base of the hill.
The site extends over an area measuring 250 m
east-west by 140 m north-south. About two thirds
of the site lies to the east of the channel, where two
low rises were observed. The first is a large, low,
nearly circular rise near the site's center (referred
to as the Main Rise) that measures approximately
60 m in diameter. The second is a smaller low rise
measuring 30 m north-south by 40 m east west in
the southeastern corner of the site. This smaller rise
overlooks the confluence of the original channel
with a southeast trending intermittent stream. This
intermittent stream also forms the eastern boundary
of the site.

The depth of deposit is approximately 35-40
cm below surface, based on examination of creek
bank exposures and a pot hunter's holes, as well as
the excavation of three shovel tests. Ground surface visibility was 100 percent in plowed fields and
0 percent in the forest. There were several good
exposures along the creek channel. On the eastern
side of Blue Hollow, two shovel tests were dug and
screened in the wooded area south of the old natural channel, and one shovel test was dug and
screened on a low rise in the old field north of the
old channel. The crew made a non-controlled collection of diagnostic artifacts from the plowed surface of this site west of the diversion channel.
Five pot holes were present in the field on the
west side of the diversion channel and two areas
of excavation into the creek bank on the southern
edge of the site were noted where a midden was
exposed in the cut bank. Some burned rock and
animal bones were observed in the backdirt piles,
but none of the bones appeared to be human. With
the help of the landowner, the author contacted
Jimmy Wingler, the person responsible for the
digging, to inquire about his interest in the site
and request that he not excavate any further. Mr.
Wingler described himself as an amateur archeologist who is interested in archeology, but has no
access to professionals or a local society. This is
an area of the state that could benefit from the

creation of an archeological society if guided by a
professional archeologist.
The midden exposed in the cut bank of the
diversion channel is very dark and clearly visible, extending down 20-30 centimeters below
surface. Shovel testing on the east side of the
diversion channel documented the midden on a
rise in an old field to a depth of only 22 cm
below surface. The midden was not observed in
the two shovel tests dug in the colluvium south
of the natural channel, but the test closest to the
creek appeared to be comprised of recent colluvium. Any cultural features present at this site
should be easy to see during excavation due to
the dark gray midden overlying the natural reddish brown soil. No other cultural features were
observed at the time of our visit, but avocational
archeologists report finding burials at this site.
Occupation of this site appears to be limited to
the Late Prehistoric period.
Two very thick sherds (1.6 cm and 1.1 cm
respectively) were collected from the western portion of the site, along with burned rock, a small
unidentifiable fragment of long bone from a deersized animal, and lithics. Some mussel shell was
observed on the surface. These sherds were not
shell-tempered, but rather grog and bone tempered

(Figure 14). The very faint decoration visible on
the exterior surface appears to be cord-marking,
but it is too faint to positively identify and might be
the result of very light brushing.
41C0177, Dr. Cole's Site
Situated on the south side of North Fish Creek,
this site appears to have great potential for yielding information about Late Prehistoric period
lifeways. Thurman Ward led the way to this site,
stating that materials extended from the creek all
the way back to the hills, covering an area of
about 40 acres. However the densest concentration is estimated at about 100 x 40 m adjacent to
the creek, and this is the area the crew recorded as
the site. Mr. Ward had collected beveled knives
and a piece of obsidian from the rise adjacent to
the creek. Obsidian was also recovered downstream at the Dillard site (41C0174), and it is
likely that the residents of Dr. Cole's site obtained
this material from the Dillard site.
North Fish Creek forms both the northern and
eastern site boundaries. The creek is deeply entrenched and is avulsing southward in the direction
of the site, cutting into the rise containing the densest concentration of material. A steep cut bank with

a 20-25 ft. vertical drop to the creek is present along
the northern edge of this rise. A northward flowing
intermittent stream makes a sharp tum to the east
shortly before it joins North Fish Creek. This stream
marks the eastern edge of the broad area of artifacts
reported by Mr. Ward, and forms the southern boundary of the site as the THC crew recorded it.
Most of the site is in pasture, but a small portion
of the eastern edge extends slightly into riparian
forest. Approximately 80 percent of the site appears
to be intact. Ground surface visibility ranged from
20 to 40 percent in some eroded areas, but was
generally nonexistent due to pasture and forest cover.
Where vegetation was sparse enough, materials were
visible on the surface. The crew spread out and
walked these areas to conduct a surface collection.

Two shovel tests were dug on the main rise and
the matrix was screened through 1/4-inch mesh. The
soil profile consists of brown sandy loam overlying
hard sandy clay. Flakes, bone fragments, and an
animal tooth were collected from shovel tests (Table
6). These shovel tests indicate that the depth of
cultural deposits extend at least 30 cm below surface. In addition, two beveled knife fragments were
collected from the surface (Table 7). One was
clearly of the four-beveled variety, but the other
was broken approximately in half and it was not
possible to determine whether it was a two-beveled
of four-beveled knife.
This may be an important Late Prehistoric site,
based on the materials attributed to it by Thurman
Ward. The beveled knives are most frequently associated with Late Prehistoric Plains Village bison
hunting, and this is the only site visited during this
survey where such implements have been found.
Also, obsidian is not commonly found in this part
of Texas. The site merits further testing.

41C0178, Jack Crozier Site
Jack Crozier, owner of the Fort Fitzhugh site,
also owns this large upland site in the Cross Timbers. Ernie Martin has a surface collection from
visits he has made at various times over the past 20
years. No pottery has ever been found, but Early
Archaic diagnostic artifacts (e.g., a Meserve point

that had been reworked into a scraper) have been
recovered. He led the crew to the site and pointed
out the location where he found the reworked
Meserve point and the general locations of greatest
artifact concentration.
The site lies within the drainage basin of the
Elm Fork of the Trinity River. Wolf Creek is 100 m
east of the site, but a spring-fed, permanent stream
bisects the site into northern and southern halves.
The areas n01ih and south of the spring-fed creek are
in pasture with typical Cross Timbers vegetation,
consisting primarily of oaks, adjacent to the stream.
Ground surface visibility was fair on the north side
of the creek, due to the presence of some erosional
areas, but was very poor on the south side of the
stream where the pasture grasses were much thicker.
The site is estimated to cover an area measuring 200 x 240 m, with the concentration north of
the stream measuring 100 x 200 m, and the concentration south of the stream measuring 100 x 60 m.
Much of the site occurs on a gradual to steep
hillslope. Ernie Martin reports that 90 percent of
the artifacts were found on the slope north of the
stream. The crew observed several flakes of chert
and quartzite and a sandstone nutting stone on the
north side of the stream.
The crew dug two shovel tests on the south
side of the stream where the pasture grasses were
thick. Chert and quartzite flakes were collected from
one shovel test, but the other shovel test was sterile
(Table 8). Shovel testing indicates a depth of deposit of at least 40 cm below surface, with the soil
comprised of sandy loam. Shovel testing ceased at
50 cm due to low recovery, but no change in the
matrix was observed. No surface collection was

conducted at this site. No features were observed,
but Ernie Martin showed us an area where he had
found a human tooth (post-mortem loss) indicating
the presence of at least one human burial.
Approximately 90 percent of the site remains
intact. Although few artifacts were observed during
the crew's visit, the information regarding early
materials and a probable burial indicate that further
testing is warranted.

41C0179, The Beck Site
Claude Beck owned this site in 1989. When he
found projectile points and other artifacts in fill dirt
he purchased from Mr. Beck, Ernie Martin brought
it to Mr. Beck's attention. Ernie examined the grader
cuts and showed Mr. Beck that his fill dirt operation was mining an archeological site. Mr. Beck
stopped the operation once he became aware of the
damage to the site.
The site is situated at the foot of a steep slope
that rises 100 feet above the South Fish Creek
floodplain (Figure 15). The site is located 45 m
south of South Fish Creek to the east of the
confluence of South Fish Creek and Landers
Branch. The northern half of site (north of the
road) had been cleared and had 80 percent ground
surface visibility. The half south of the road was
covered in riparian forest and had no ground surface visibility. Materials are present within the
colluvium covering the gradual slope at base of
hill and extend down the slope and across the road
onto the alluvial floodplain where the fill dirt had
been mined. A dry erosional wash was arbitrarily
selected as the southern boundary of the site, since

occupations in the same area over time. The site
definitely has research potential for Late Prehistoric
settlement studies, and possibly for Archaic
settlement as well.

41C0180, The Barlow Cemetery
This historic cemetery is situated on a high
ridge overlooking the Red River Valley. The site is
listed as the Barlow Cemetery on the USGS
Marysville Tex.-Okla. 7.5' quadrangle. Interments
began in the 1880s and are arranged in regular rows
within a rectangular fenced enclosure along the hilltop. A prehistoric component is also present inside

the cemetery fence that extends outside the fence to
the north. Thurman Ward reported that he found
historic period clay marbles at the site. He has
collected artifacts from the surface over many years.
The crew conducted a random surface collection of prehistoric material, recovering one small
end scraper, one biface fragment, and one small possible spokeshave. The only other artifacts noted were
a few flakes. The site may date to the Late Prehistoric period, based on the presence of the thumbnail
scraper. No prehistoric features were observed.
Cedar Creek, about 200 meters to the west, is
the closest source of water, but the Red River is only
about 400 m to the north, where it turns to the north-

east along a bluffline. The upland vegetation is mostly
native grasses interspersed with some cedars and
oaks. Due to the sparseness of the vegetative cover,
ground surface visibility was around 70 percent.
Site size is roughly 110 by 60 m, including
both the prehistoric component and the historic
cemetery. However, the fence around the cemetery
encloses a roughly 60 x 70 m area, and the prehistoric
material appears to be confined to an area of about
40 x 70 m, mostly north of the cemetery. Although
no shovel tests were dug, the highly eroded nature of
this upland landform suggests that any prehistoric
deposit is very shallow. Several historic graves with
a wide variety of grave markers were present in the
cemetery. However, there was no time to fully
document the cemetery. Aside from a few photographs, the graves were not recorded.
Although it is estimated that up to 80 percent
of the prehistoric component is still intact, further
investigation does not seem warranted. This is a
fairly small, sparse site with limited research potential. The historic cemetery, on the other hand,
should be documented with notes and photographs
for each grave, along with a map.

41C0181
Ernie Martin has conducted surface collections
on this site, and directed the crew to its location.
The site is at least 115 x 50 m in extent, but the
actual size is difficult to estimate because of poor
ground surface exposure. This site lies on a high
terrace about 40 ft. above the Red River, which
forms its northern boundary. Vegetation consists of
post oak, blackjack oak, and native bluestem
grasses. Limestone bedrock can be seen in the lower
part of the cut bank of the Red River underneath
the site deposits. A major spring, called Dripping
Spring, is located about 450 meters due south of the
site. The sp1ing vent forms a drainage that flows
into an unnamed creek that empties into the Red
River about 140 m east of the site.
Surface inspection and shovel testing were conducted. Ground surface visibility was 100 percent
in the dirt road and trails, but was nonexistent elsewhere. Cultural materials were shallowly buried,
except in road cuts. Diagnostic artifacts were collected from the surface and all artifacts from shovel
tests were collected. Ogallala quartzite flakes and
flakes of several colors of chert were observed on
the surface in the road ruts. In all, perhaps 30 pieces
of chipping debris and 12 burned rock fragments

were seen. The cut bank exposures along the edge
of the river were too steep to safely examine.
Six shovel tests were excavated near areas
where denser surface distributions of artifacts were
observed in the road. The matrix consisted of a
brown to dark brown fine sandy loam over a mixed
reddish brown/brown fine sandy silt encountered at
30-40 cm below surface, with the upper unit being
thicker as one moved downslope toward the creek.
Beneath the sandy silt was a red to reddish brown
silty clay at a depth of about 50 cm. The boundary
between the upper sandy loam and the lower silty
clay was diffuse. In one especially deep road rut, a
layer of compacted pebbly silty clay loam was underlain by a yellowish sand at a depth of 75-80 cm
below surface. The few artifacts recovered are listed
in Table 11. The depth of the deposit is approximately 20-50 cm below surface. No cultural features were observed.
The site is located in a favorable setting near a
spring and the river. Unfortunately, hunters and
fishermen utilize this setting quite heavily. Deep
road ruts from their trucks have damaged some of
the deposits, and many people are likely to have
collected artifacts. The Tulsa District should limit
traffic in this area until the site can be evaluated for
National Register of Historic Places eligibility.

4JGS114, The Sheppard Park Site
This site is situated at the very northern tip
of a low projection of land within the Sheppard
Air Force Base. Recreation Area. It is the first
point of land west of the Fobb Bottom State
Hunting Area. This low landform is landscaped
and vegetated primarily in grass. It lies within
the floodpool of Lake Texoma and is occasionally inundated. The site overlooks the confluence
of Briar Creek and the Red River. Briar Creek,
located about 150 to 200 m to the west, flows
northward, while the Red River flows southward
along the eastern side of the site. The confluence
was presumably north or northeast of the site in
what is now Lake Texoma.
Site area is estimated to measure roughly 200
x 250 m. All survey was limited to visual
inspection of the ground surface and cut banks
along the shore. The soil matrix consisted of 1015 cm of fine sandy loam over red compacted
sandy clay. Ground surface visibility was only 0
to 10 percent. The depth of the deposit is undetermined, but is believed to be only 10 to 15 cm below

surface based on depth of presumed culture bearing
strata (fine sandy loam).
A very light scatter of chert debitage and burned
rock occurred along a 100-125 m stretch of shoreline. No diagnostic materials or cultural features
were observed. Artifacts were eroding out of a 2 to 3
m deep cutbank, presumably from the thin 10-15 cm
cap of fine sandy loam that overlies the red compacted sandy clay. One chunk of siltstone with cortex on 100% of the dorsal surface was recovered
from the cut bank at the northwest portion of the
site. Heavy shoreline erosion has removed much of
the deposit. It appears that very little remains intact,
perhaps less than 25 percent.

41GS115
Ernie Martin has found artifacts on the surface of this site, which is located along a periodically inundated low knoll on a point of land approximately 750 m north of the Sheppard Air Force
Base Recreation Area and about 1.125 km west of

the Willis Point, Fobb Bottom State Hunting Area.
The primary concentration of cultural materials is
confined to the south side of this point overlooking
the confluence of an unnamed intermittent stream
and Caitlin Creek. At one time, intermittent drainages were probably located within 50 m of the site.
Vegetation consisted of grass, oaks, pecans, and
various hardwoods. The current site area is estimated to measure only 74 x 27 m. However, site
materials were probably much more extensive prior
to the impoundment of Lake Texoma and some
artifacts may be submerged beneath the lake waters. Some burned rock, a biface fragment, and a
quartzite flake were noted along the northeastern
shore of this particular point of land, suggesting
another site was once located there. Ground surface
visibility was very poor on that portion of the landform due to drifting sands along the shoreline and
cut bank margins. The southwestern shoreline of
this point exhibits cut bank exposures up to 1.7 m
high (Figure 16). The percentage of intact deposits
remaining is unknown.

156

Texas Archeological Society

Figure 16. Inspecting the cut bank at site 41GS115.

Survey included visual inspection of the ground
surface and cut banks along the shore and excavation of 4 shovel tests. Debitage was recovered from
all of the 4 shovel tests (Table 12). The shovel tests
were plotted on a map made with the pace and
compass technique. The soil matrix consisted of
medium fine sandy loam over red compacted sandy
clay. Ground surface visibility varied from poor to
fair, but overall visibility was estimated to be 40 to
50 percent. The depth of the archeological deposit
was not precisely determined, but is restricted to
the sandy loam A horizon ranging from 30 - 60 cm
thick, with an average thickness of about 35 cm
across much of the site.
One feature was recorded, but it is unknown if
it is of cultural or natural origin. Feature 1 was a
circular arrangement of limestone cobbles measuring 33 cm in diameter. Two larger pieces were
lying horizontally on the ground surface, while 13
other pieces formed a circle, with several of these
tilted at about a 55 degree angle. A single small
tertiary flake was found immediately adjacent to
the feature and a second flake was found some 10 ft
away. It was difficult to determine if the rocks were
fire-cracked. The rocks were sitting on, or just

above, the red sandy clay B horizon. Most of the
brown fine sandy loam matrix had been stripped
away by erosion.
In addition to artifacts collected from shovel
tests, surface artifacts that were observed but not
collected included possible burned limestone and
sandstone, 20-30 tertiary Ogallala quartzite flakes,
a few tan and white chert flakes, and a single
biface fragment.

41GS23
The Cocklebur Site
Ken Brown (UT Austin) originally recorded
this site in 1972 during the Texoma Enlargement
Project. Ernie Martin also has conducted surface
collections at this site, which is situated on a periodically flooded point of land on the north side of
Slickum Slough, directly across the slough from a
Texaco oil field. This area is west of the main
channel of the Red River and about four km north
of the Sheppard Air Force Base Recreation Area.
Slickum Slough drains the adjoining upland areas
and empties into present day Lake Texoma adjacent to the site.

Artifacts were observed along a 400 m-long
stretch of shoreline that was about two m wide.
These site dimensions were recorded on the site
form, but obviously the entire extent of the site area
is larger. No cultural features were noted, but chert
and quartzite flakes, crude bifaces, and burned rocks
were observed as a discontinuous scatter of material
along the 400 m of shoreline. Material was exposed
on the beach on both the lake and the slough sides,
in small quantities. Ground surface visibility away
from the beach was 0-10 percent due to grasses and
weedy growth.
Due to time constraints, the site was given only
a cursory examination and no shovel tests were
dug. All observations were based on visual inspection. Materials were not visible on the surface away
from the beach, but are presumed to be buried in
the intact sandy loam A horizon. A low, one-mhigh cut bank parallels the shoreline and it appeared as though site materials were eroding from
within this profile. The depth of sandy loam above
the red sandy clay B horizon was variable, but
could not be precisely determined due to the heavily
eroded nature of the shoreline. The discontinuous
nature of the cultural materials may be a function
of differential erosion and or reflect multiple overlapping or adjacent sites.

41C0182
Dirt Road Site
This is another site Ernie Martin is supposed to
have visited, but his description of the location was
somewhat vague and the site observed by the field
crew was so small that they were not sure if this site
was the same one he had described. It is situated on
an alluvial te1Tace of the Red River only about 50
m east of the main channel. Cultural materials were
observed over a 60 m long exposure in a dirt road
crossing the West Handy Oil and Gas Field.
Ground surface visibility was 100 percent within
the bladed road, but away from the road it was only
0-10 percent due to grasses and scattered oaks and
pecans. The site dimensions were recorded on the
site form as 60 x 10 m (artifacts observed over a 60
m stretch along the road by the width of the road),
but the entire extent of the site is not known. No
cultural features were noted, but burned rock, chert
and quartzite debitage were observed in the road.
The materials appeared to be in situ and not brought
in as road fill. No artifacts were collected.
All observations were based on a very brief
visual inspection, just enough to confirm that a site
was present. The depth of the deposit is unknown,
but since the only disturbance appears to be from

the road, it is estimated that perhaps 75 percent of
the site is intact.

pebbles. Part of the site is in cultivation, part is an
orchard, and the rest is unimproved pasture of Coastal
Bermuda and numerous wild native grasses. Ground
surface visibility is usually around 60-70 percent,
with 100 percent visibility in the cultivated portion.
Several occupations, spanning the Paleoindian
to Late Prehistoric periods, occurred at this site
based on the diagnostic artifacts recovered. Ernie
Martin identified Meserve, Angostura, Dalton, San
Patrice, Scottsbluff, and Calf Creek dart points,
representing the Paleoindian to Early Archaic occupations. Wells, Gary, Yarbrough, Kent, Godley,
Darl, Lange, Marcos, Martindale, Castroville, and
Dallas or Trinity dart points reflect most of the
Archaic period occupations. Only two arrow points
are known from the Cox Site, both of the Bonham
type (Figure 18). Other artifacts present included
metates, nutting stones, gouges (Clear Fork type),
scrapers (both hafted and hand held), and drills. No
beads or pottery have been found at this site. No
cultural features were discernable, but the site is
littered with rocks darkened by burning. These rocks

This is a large productive site that was recorded
by Ernie Martin shortly after the Texas Historical
Commission 1989 fieldwork had been completed. He
mailed the site form and photographs to the author so
they could be added to the report. This is the only site
discussed in this article that was not actually visited
by Texas Historical Commission staff.
Beginning in the 1930s and continuing for more
than 40 years, random surface collections were
conducted at this site. Ivan Cox, Ernie Martin, and
Steve Brammer all have collections that include
projectile points, metates, drills, gouges, scrapers,
bifaces, and nutting stones. Located in southeastern
Cooke County, approximately nine miles southeast
of the city of Gainesville, this site lies along the
east bank of Indian Creek south of Lake Kiowa. It

have been disturbed by cultivation, but there are
probably intact deposits beneath the plow zone and
are most likely undisturbed cultural deposits in the
areas of the site that are not under cultivation.
Artifacts were concentrated along the highest
ridge of the terrace, where an orchard is now located,
extending south to the northernmost part of the peanut field. The Paleoindian points are generally made
from imported or uncommon material, while those
of the Archaic period were manufactured from local
materials. Ernie Martin believes that this site was a
regular stop on the seasonal round beginning late in
the Paleoindian period and lasting up to the beginning of the Late Prehistoric period.

CONCLUSIONS
Prior to this report, the archeology of Cooke
County was known only by the handful of avocational archeologists who collect there. The limited professional excavations at Fish Creek Reservoir (Moss Lake) by Lorraine (1969) provided a

glimpse of the potential the county held, as did
excavations at 41C0141 at Lake Ray Roberts
(Prikryl and Yates 1987). Ernie Martin's excellent
excavations at the Dillard Site (41C0174) provided
a wealth of data for the Late Prehistoric period
along the Fish Creek/Red River area (Martin 1994).
Otherwise, nothing had been published on the archeology of the county. The Cooke County Archeological Project was designed to sample as many
of the major drainages and physiographic zones of
the county as possible in the limited time frame
available to obtain information on a variety of sites
and document them on State of Texas Archeological Site forms.
In four days, 12 sites were sampled and recorded, many of which appear to have good research
potential. The site that appears to offer the greatest
potential is the Sivells Bend site (41C0159). The
quantity of materials recovered from the few shovel
tests dug and the profiles observed in Mr. Ward's
excavation, coupled with reports of midden stains
and house patterns, clearly indicates that a village
was present during the Late Prehistoric period.

160

Texas Archeological Society

Another site with great potential for understanding
the Late Prehistoric period is the Warrens Bend
Site (41C0176), which had a midden clearly visible in the cut bank of Blue Hollow. It is also one of
the most threatened sites in the area, with five potholes on the site proper and two excavations into
the midden along the cut bank. These sites could
reveal information about this time period along this
stretch of the Red River.
Along the Fish Creek drainage, Dr. Cole's
Site (41CO177) is particularly interesting and
appears to retain a good deal of contextual integrity. The fragments of beveled knives found by
the crew, coupled with reports of complete beveled knives and obsidian, indicate further excavations would be informative. The Beck site
(41C0179) has been severely damaged by the
mining of topsoil, but approximately 50 percent
of the site is still intact. The presence of hearth
features suggests that additional excavation
would also be productive.
Within the Elm fork drainage, the Ivan Cox
Farm site (41C0183) appears to have the greatest potential for understanding the Paleoindian
and Archaic period occupations. Although, not
visited by the crew during this project, the quantity of artifacts recovered over the years and the
amount of the site remaining intact, as reported
by Ernie Martin, suggest that this would be a
very productive site for future research. Another
site within the Elm fork drainage that was reported to contain early materials was the Jack
Crozier site (41C0178). Although the crew observed few artifacts, the reported Meserve point
and the presence of a probable burial indicate
that further testing is warranted.
It is difficult to assess the potential of many of
the sites due to lack of data, either due to poor site
conditions at the time of our visit or the brevity of
the site visit as we endeavored to reach all of the
sites reported by avocationals. The Grady McElreath
Site, 41C0175, did not appear to have features or
many artifacts the day the crew visited it, but dry
dusty conditions prevailed. In 1969, promising
stains and bone concentrations were observed, so
the site may have some research potential. With
respect to the sites recorded at Lake Texoma, several
may have potential for additional study, but the
massive erosion from the lake coupled with the
cursory examination of most sites allows only
general recommendations to be made. The Tulsa
District should limit traffic or other disturbances in

the areas of 41C0181, 41C0182, 41GS23, and
41GS115 until the sites can be evaluated for
National Register of Historic Places eligibility.
The prehistoric sites with the least potential for
further study include 41C0180, the Barlow Cemetery, which contains only a prehistoric surface artifact scatter, and 41GS114, The Sheppard Park
Site, which has been almost completely eroded away
by Lake Texoma. Although there is a lot of local
interest in Fort Fitzhugh, 41C04, due to its historical importance to the City of Gainesville, very little
appears to remain intact. Key portions of the site
that were subjected to archeological excavation have
been bulldozed, and other portions have been damaged by house and barn construction. It is possible
that the most informative portion of the site has
been destroyed, but because this is an important
historical site, additional shovel testing should be
conducted to determine if any intact archeological
deposits are left.
On a final note, it seems that this area of the
state would benefit greatly from the creation of a
local archeological society, particularly if guided
by a professional archeologist, such as the Texas
Historical Commission Regional Archeologist for
this region. This project has demonstrated that there
are numerous sites with tremendous potential for
yielding data about a region for which the archeology still remains virtually unknown. Many of the
sites remain fairly well intact, and there are interested avocationals present in the area who simply
need some guidance on the appropriate methods of
site recording and excavation. At present, Cooke
County is not threatened with the kind of development that has destroyed virtually all major sites that
once were present in the Dallas-Forth Worth
metroplex. It may never suffer development on this
scale, but some action should be taken soon to
document and study these sites before any further
development does occur.

Burial Sinkhole (41KM140)
Christine Alvarez

ABSTRACT

The stable carbon isotope analysis of the individuals at the Stiver Ranch burial site suggests they shared
a mixed diet of predominately C3 plants and animals that eat these plants, and lesser amounts of CAM/ C4
plants. Furthermore, the distribution of oC 13 values at 41KM140 indicate a single dietary population among
the mortuary sample interred at the site. Comparison with oC13 values from other Central Texas mortuary
sites reveals dietary trends for hunter-gatherer populations which warrant further stable carbon isotope
research in the Central Texas region.

INTRODUCTION
The field of bioarcheology, or the study of human skeletal remains in an archaeological context,
is of growing importance in archeology today, especially in regards to sites with mortuary components. In addition to information gleaned from burial
goods and mortuary practices, study of the skeletal
remains themselves can provide additional valuable information about a population including demography, health status, diet and adaptive efficiency. For example, bioarcheological analysis was
a key component in the study of a number of wellknown prehistoric burial sites in Texas, including
Bering sinkhole and Seminole sinkhole. With advances in scientific techniques which can draw information from human bone, such as stable carbon
isotope testing, research which focuses on human
skeletal material is increasingly important. Stable
carbon isotope testing is a valuable method in analysis of dietary patterns and is a vital component for a
complete understanding of the lifeways of the burial
sinkhole skeletal population.
With funding provided by the Council of Texas
Archaeologists (CTA), a total of five samples of
human bone from Stiver's Ranch Burial sinkhole
were submitted to Geochron laboratories for stable
isotope testing of carbon in collagen to reconstruct
the possible diet of individuals interred at the
sinkhole. Two additional stable carbon isotope
values were added when the results of radiocarbon

analysis were made available. In this paper I present
the results of stable carbon isotope analyses, compare the results with those of other mortuary sites
in Texas, and examine dietary patterns and hypotheses based on stable carbon isotope values
reported from mortuary sites in Central Texas.

SITE DESCRIPTION AND
METHODS OF EXCAVATION
The Stiver Ranch burial sinkhole (41KM140)
is a prehistoric burial site located on private land in
Kimble County, TX (Figure 1). The excavations at
the burial sinkhole took place over two South Texas
Archaeological Association (ST AA) field schools
in 1999 and 2000, with Dr. Steve Black as Principal Investigator. The investigative strategy for the
site was complete excavation, with some modifications to control for the confined area of the sinkhole. At the start of the excavations in 1999, the
sinkhole was divided into two excavation units,
north and south, or Unit N and Unit S. Levels in
each unit were to measure lOcm in depth, but by
Unit N, level 4, average depth per level had reached
15 cm, a combination of difficult and cramped excavation conditions, rocky matrix, and an eager
field crew. Between the 1999 and 2000 field
schools, excavation during the weekends resulted
in the north and south units being combined into
one center unit where level depth was taken down

mented. Analysis of over 3,500

minimum of eight adult individuals, including one cremation, and two subadult individuals were deposited at the sinkhole. A minimum of eight adult
individuals was determined by

from the Late Archaic throughout the Late
Prehistoric period.

STABLE CARBON ISOTOPES
DA TING METHODS
As at other mortuary sites, understanding the
time period during which the site was utilized is
of primary importance. An accurate site chronology allows the researcher to draw information regarding patterns of use of a site, and in
bioarcheology, trends of change in the population. For example, at Bering sinkhole, discrete
deposits were dated to the Early Archaic through
the Late Prehistoric, and analysis of the skeletal
remains could therefore inform on patterns in
health and diet over most of prehistory. In contrast, all remains from Seminole sink dated to
the Early Archaic period. Unfortunately, the degree of commingling at 41KM140 did not allow
for the precise associations between time period
and burials as was seen at Bering sinkhole and
Seminole sink, however both relative dating and
absolute dating were used in an attempt to refine
the chronology of the site.
Relative dating of 41KM140 using artifact association was of limited reliability due to the commingling of deposits. However, temporally diagnostic artifacts were used when available to give a
broad range of time during which the site was probably used for burial, assuming that projectile points
and other artifacts were interred with individuals as
grave goods. Nine diagnostic projectile points including one Travis/Nolan, six Frio, and two
Edwards indicate that the sinkhole was used during
the Middle Archaic through the Late prehistoric, a
period of use of approximately 4,000 years (Collins
1995). Generally, projectile points from earlier time
periods were recovered from the lower deposits,
and those from the later time periods were recovered from the upper deposits.
With funding provided by the STAA, two
bone samples were selected for absolute dating.
AMS radiocarbon dating of two samples of
human bone from the upper and lower deposits
gave radiocarbon ages of 800Â±40 B.P. and
2130Â±40 B.P. respectively. These dates fall
within the time range suggested using temporally
diagnostic artifacts. Using AMS radiocarbon
dates alone to establish the chronology of the
site confirms that the site was used for burial

The concentration of the elements carbon and
nitrogen are under metabolic control in an animal's
tissues, or collagen. The amount of each element
consumed by an individual is expressed by a ratio
of the amount of each isotope (C 13 for carbon) to
the amount of each element (C 12 for carbon) in the
bone collagen. These ratios are not transferred
exactly from the food to the consumer, but differ
because of fractionation, or the preferred incorporation or exclusion of one isotope or another in a
chemical reaction (Price et al. 1985). Because
lighter isotopes react more quickly in a reaction
than heavier ones, collagen will reflect different
proportions for different isotopes. For example,
carbon values are less negative than the diet food,
while nitrogen values are more positive than the
diet food (by about three parts per thousand).
Knowing the unique properties of carbon and nitrogen, and their use by plants and animals, allows
researchers to correlate the isotopic compositions
of dietary resources with those found in bone collagen (Ambrose 1993).
Carbon can enter a consumer's diet through
three possible sources, depending on the photosynthetic pathway of the plants consumed. C3 plants
utilize a photosynthetic pathway with three carbon
atoms, C4 plants use four atoms, and CAM plants
can utilize both pathways. C4 plants include a variety of grasses and agricultural crops. Their oC 13
values, or the ratio of the carbon isotope 13 to
carbon 12, are less negative than C3 plants, because
they are less depleted in carbon. C3 plants such as
bushes and most trees have more negative values.
Lastly CAM or Crassulacean acid metabolism
plants, such as most cacti, have values similar to C4
plants. Because different foods in an individual's
diet (C 3 plants vs. C4 plants for example) produce
different isotopic signatures, researchers are able to
determine to varying degrees what sort of diet foods
were being utilized by that individual. In addition,
collagen turnover in adult humans is rather slow
and thus the sample values given always show the
accumulation of isotopes over a long period of time,
specifically the diet of an individual over the last
10-30 years of life. Because of this accumulation,
stable carbon isotope ratios are a good indicator of

168

the long-term diet of an individual (Mays 2002,
Bousman and Quigg, n.d.).

ENVIRONMENT AND DIET
A thorough discussion of stable isotope analysis
of carbon and its use in reconstructing the diet of
prehistoric populations has been given thorough
attention elsewhere (Ambrose 1993, Mays 2002,
Pate 1994, Price et al. 1985, Schwarcz and Schoeninger 1991). However, a brief review of some of
the most common dietary resources available in the
Central Texas region is presented. The range of
carbon isotope values (oC 13 ) for these resources is
also indicated.
Plants and animals which may have been utilized as part of the diet in Central Texas include a
variety of C3 plants (mean value of -27 %0) which
are abundant in the Edwards Plateau and neighboring regions. C3 plants include acorns harvested from
live oak and shin oak, sotol, onion, and persimmon.
Edible CAM (Crassulacean Acid Metabolism)
plants in the region, many of which yield oC 13
values in the C4 plant range (mean -12.5%0), include prickly pear and yucca (Huebner 1991). Deer,
which consume a diet of C 3 plants, were also part
of the Central Texas diet, along with a variety of
other animals including bison, rabbits, and turtles
(Baker 1998, Bement 1994).
The abundance of C3 plants and some CAM
plants suggest that hunter gatherers utilizing plant
resources in this region should have an isotopic
signature indicating a diet which includes a mixture
of predominately C3 plants, and lesser amounts of
C4 or CAM plants. The assumed dividing point in
human 8C 13 values for a C3 dominant diet vs. a C4
dominant diet is approximately -14%0 (Huebner
1991). Therefore, values with a negative greater
than -14%0 would suggest a diet similar to Central
Texas mixed C3 and CiCAM diets, and values more
positive than the -14%0 dividing point would reflect
a C/CAM diet similar to those found in the Lower
Pecos region of Texas (Huebner 1991 ).

SAMPLE SUBMISSION
AND RESULTS
Funding provided by the CT A allowed for
only five samples of the entire skeletal assemblage to be submitted for stable carbon isotope

testing. These samples were carefully selected to
avoid including the same individual twice. This
was particularly difficult due to the fragmented
and commingled nature of the sample. To avoid
this problem, three right distal humeri and two right
mandibular bodies were selected. The intention
was to include the highest amount of duplicated
bone elements possible to avoid selecting bones
that belonged to the same individual. Samples were
also selected from both upper and lower deposits
of the sinkhole since these areas contained the
most complete bone fragments.
As previously stated, a minimum number of eight
adult individuals were interred at the sinkhole, and
this was determined after calculating the highest number of duplicated bone elements. The selected
samples represent at least three to five out of eight
adult individuals from the sinkhole. Since three right
humeri cannot possibly belong to the same individual, at least three individuals are represented by
the samples selected. At most, five individuals are
represented by the samples selected, if every bone
selected belongs to a different individual.
Two additional samples, which were from the
upper and lower deposits of the sinkhole respectively, provided both oC 13 values and AMS radiocarbon ages (Table 1). Inclusion of these two
samples added two additional oC 13 values, which
lie within or near the range of values given for the
undated samples. The results show a range of 8C 13
values with a mean of -17.7Â±0.92 %0 (Table 1). The
distribution of values lies close to the sample mean,
with very little deviation. As Bousman and Quigg
(n.d.) note, such a small range, with values which
lie close to the sample mean, suggests that only one
dietary population is represented.

PATTERNS, COMPARISON,
AND DISCUSSION
The values from the Stiver Ranch sinkhole indicate that individuals had a mixed diet of C3 and
C4 plants, with a greater dependence on C3 plants
and probably animals which ate C3 plants such as
deer. Since the mean 8C 13 value (-17.4 %0) for the
41KM140 sample series was more negative than
the dividing point in human 8C 13 values for a C3
dominant diet vs. a C4 dominant diet (-14%0), the
results suggest that the individuals interred at the
Stiver ranch burial sinkhole consumed a diet similar to Central Texas mixed C3and C/CAM diets

Dental Wear and Pathology During the Middle Archaic
on the Texas Gulf Coastal Plain
Matthew S. Taylor

ABSTRACT
The Ernest Witte site (41AU36) is a large multicomponent cemetery located on the Texas Gulf Coastal Plain
in Austin County, Texas. The oldest group of burials from the site, Group 1, date to the Middle Archaic time
period (3500-1500 B.C.). Forty-two adult dentitions with 753 teeth and tooth sockets were selected for a study
of dental pathology. While incidences of caries, enamel hypoplasias, and calculus were low, differential patterns
of dental wear between the sexes resulted in high levels of dental abscesses and antemortem tooth loss. This
differential pattern of wear resulted in poorer dental health for the females of the population. Reasons for the
different patterns of wear include nonmasticatory functions or diet, either of which would suggest that women
and men of the Middle Archaic Texas Gulf Coastal Plain were living and working very differently.

INTRODUCTION
Most bioarcheological or paleopathological research conducted on the skeletal populations from
the Texas Gulf Coastal Plain have been broad-based
studies in the form of master's theses (Comuzzie
1987; Powell 1989; Taylor 2001), dissertations
(Baker 2001; Dockall 1997), or site reports (Malina
and Bramblett 1981; Miller 1991; Powell 1994;
Wesolowsky and Malina 1976). Of the presented or
published research, few reports have been concerned
specifically with the dental anthropology of the region (exceptions include Colby 1997; Comuzzie and
Steele 1988, 1989; Taylor 2002), which is surprising
considering the generally poor state of preservation
of prehistoric skeletal remains in the area (Dockall
1997:51; Steele and Olive 1989; Taylor 2001:51).
Of the studies that have been carried out on the
skeletal remains of Texas Gulf Coastal Plain populations most have been concerned with the Late
Archaic (1500 B.C-A.D. 100) time period. This is
understandable considering that the bulk of the
samples from the region date to this period (Hall
1995a; Patterson 2000). Only two skeletal samples
of significant size predate the Late Archaic and of
these, only the Middle Archaic portion of the Ernest
Witte site is currently available for study (the other
sample, Early Archaic 41VT98, is under study outof-state but is likely to be reburied when it is returned). Some researchers have avoided the Ernest
Witte sample because of its poor preservation

(Dockall 1997:48), but that does not mean that no
worthwhile data can be collected from the remains.
Rather, it should be regarded as an opportunity to
focus on the dental anthropology of an underrepresented population and time period. The purpose of
this report is to examine the dental wear and pathology from the Group 1 burials from the Ernest
Witte site, which represent the only significant skeletal population dating to the Middle Archaic on the
Texas Gulf Coastal Plain.

BACKGROUND
The Ernest Witte site is a multicomponent cemetery located in Austin County, Texas (Figure 1),
approximately 40 kilometers west of Houston (Hall
1981:1). Excavations carried out from 1974-75 revealed four discrete burial groups that ranged in
date from the Middle Archaic (3000-1500 B.C.) to
the Historic (1700+) time periods. The eldest burial
group, Group 1, contained 45 burials. Two burials
were radiocarbon dated to 4560Â±140 and 3480Â±90
B.P. (Hall 1981:49). These dates place the group in
Middle Archaic, according to the chronology devised by Patterson (1995).
The prehistoric peoples of the Texas Gulf
Coastal Plain are believed to have practiced a
conservative hunting and gathering lifestyle during
all phases of occupation (Few 1988; Patterson 1979,
1995; Story 1985). Although there is a passing

Dental calculus was assessed by the method illustrated by Brothwell (1981: 155), and was rated on a
scale of slight, moderate, or severe.

RESULTS
MATERIALS AND METHODS
For this study, only adult dentitions from Group
1 of the Ernest Witte site were selected for analysis.
Adults were defined as individuals with fully
erupted teeth, i.e. all teeth are in occlusion and
dental growth has ceased. Subadults were not included in the study because of their low number
and differential preservation. This resulted in a
sample of 42 individuals with 691 observable teeth
and 62 empty or resorbed (healed or partially healed
due to tooth loss during life) tooth sockets. The
sample is made up of 15 females, 18 males, and 9
of undetermined sex. The average age of females in
the sample was 36.5 years while males averaged 32
years (Taylor, 2001:75).
The 42 individuals represented were assessed
for both sex and age. Sex assessments were based
on the morphological features of the pelvis (Phenice
1969; Bruzek 2002) and the skull (Meindl et al.
1985). Additional sexing techniques consisted of
seriation of specific post-cranial measurements
(Black 1978; Taylor 2001:74).
Assessments of dental remains and the presence
or absence of pathological conditions were made
using macroscopic observations. Pathologies were
assessed on a per tooth basis. Dental wear and first
molar wear angle was scored according to the
method devised by Smith (1984). Wear was
assessed on a 1 to 8 scale (1 = no observable wear
and 8 = total elimination of enamel). Molar wear
angle was measured using a steel protractor with a
locking pivot arm. Intraobserver error was
calculated at <2mm. Periodontal disease, defined
as a loss of alveolar bone (the bone surrounding the
teeth), was measured from the cementa-enamel
junction of the tooth to the remaining bone. Since
there is a range of normal variation in this distance,
only measurements greater than 2mm were
considered pathological (Hillson 1996). Dental
abscesses, enamel hypoplasias, caries, and antemortem tooth loss (AMTL) were assessed following
Buikstra and Ubelaker (1994). AMTL was determined to have occurred before death if the empty

The average dental wear of Group 1 was classified as moderate to severe. This degree of wear
was not significantly different between males and
females. The most heavily worn teeth were the
first molars and incisors. The average wear score
for maxillary first molars of females was 6.25.
Males averaged 6.3. Average scores for first mandibular molars averaged 6.15 for females and 6.2
for males. This trend was observable on both the
mandible and maxilla (Tables 1, 2). Two individuals in the sample displayed lingual tilting of
their right first molars. Additionally, a number of
female individuals in Group 1 displayed a noticeably oblique uneven pattern of wear on their molars, while the males generally did not (Figures 2,
3). Measurements of the wear angle of the first
molars yielded some unexpected results. Overall,
the wear angle of the first right maxillary molars
was 13.30Â°, while the mandible averaged to 9.50Â°.
The average wear angle for females was 19.17Â°
(maxillary) and 12.89Â° (mandibular). For males
the average was 12.42Â° on the maxilla and 7.50Â°
on the mandible (Figure 4).
Periodontal disease, expressed as a loss of alveolar bone, was the most common dental pathology in the sample. A total of 34 of 42 dentitions
(80.9 percent) displayed bone loss greater than 2
mm. The most commonly affected teeth were the
canines, followed by the incisors, premolars, and
molars. On average there was 1.74 mm greater bone
loss on the mandible than the maxilla. There was
no significant difference in frequencies of periodontal disease based on sex.
Of 753 observable teeth and tooth sockets, 59
showed evidence of antemortem loss (bone resorption). In terms of the number of individuals affected,
17 of 42 dentitions (40.5 percent) suffered at one
episode of AMTL. Fifty-two of the 59 (88. l percent)
exfoliated teeth were mandibular, with only 7 lost
from the maxilla. There was also a greater antemortem loss among females. Females lost 50 total teeth,
while males were missing only 9 (Table 3).
The overall rate of enamel hypoplasias was
very low. Only three individuals in the sample dis-

played clear evidence of growth disruption (0.5
percent of all teeth). All instances were observed
on the right canine: 2 mandibular and 1 maxillary.
Zero individuals displayed more than one hypoplasia (Table 3).
Dental caries were associated with 29 teeth in
the sample. These 29 were found on only 12 individuals. Females accounted for 10 of the caries,
while males possessed 16 (see Table 3). The remaining three caries were found on individuals of
undetermined sex. The maxilla had more caries
(n=l 7) than the mandible (n=l2). The most commonly affected teeth were the second and third
molars. Dental calculus was observed on 26 teeth
from 8 individuals. All calculus deposits were
graded as slight in severity. The molars were the
most frequently affected teeth. A total of 16 individuals were afflicted with 33 dental abscesses (5.1
percent of all teeth). Of these, 23 were found on
females and only 8 on males (Table 3).

DISCUSSION
Certain aspects of the dental anthropology of
Ernest Witte Group 1 are worth noting, either because they do not fit with the dental model for
hunter-gatherer health or they differ from results
previously published on similar populations. One
aspect is the extremely low rate of enamel hypoplasias. Generally, hunter-gatherer populations have a
relatively low level of enamel hypoplasias compared to agricultural populations (Goodman 1991;

Lukacs 1989). Yet the frequency observed in Group
l (0.4 percent) is too low to be reasonable. The
most likely explanation of the hyper low frequency
is found in the makeup of the sample. Since the
sample is made up entirely of adults, dental wear
has erased most of the evidence of enamel hypoplasias, producing a deceptively low frequency. Unfortunately, this limits what can be said about nutritional stress in the Middle Archaic. In order to
answer this question, research would have to focus
on non-dental indicators, such as adult stature. Ongoing studies by the author suggest that the Ernest
Witte Group 1 sample was not undersized and were
reasonably well nourished.
Another unusual aspect of the sample is the
manner of dental wear. While the severity of dental
wear was similar for both sexes, the type of wear
differed significantly between males and females.
The first molar wear of females resembled an accentuated reverse Monson's curve (a steep inverted
U). This resulted in oblique angles of wear. The
male's plane of wear was generally flat or resembled
a shallow reverse Monson's curve. Measurements
of the first molar wear angles quantify this finding
and it begs comparison with other similar samples.
Unfortunately, no data for molar wear angle exists for any other population on the Texas Gulf
Coastal Plain. Colby ( 1997) did comment on an oblique molar wear pattern for the Late Archaic/Late
Prehistoric Blue Bayou cemetery, but there was no
measurement of the wear angle. However, this data
can never be collected as the sample was recently
reburied. Other reports on Texas Gulf Coastal Plain

Taylor-Dental Wear and Pathology During the Middle Archaic on the Texas Gulf Coastal Plain 179
cemetery populations have not commented on the
presence or absence of molar wear angle.
Two disorders, dental abscesses and AMTL
are present in relatively high frequencies. Traditionally, AMTL and abscesses have been regarded
as complications arising from dental caries. Given
the low frequency of caries in the sample, this explanation is not satisfactory. A better explanation
for the Group 1 sample is the type and degree of
dental wear. Many abscesses in the sample are the
result of the oblique wear pattern. This pattern exposed the pulp cavity of the tooth to infectious
agents. As a result, these infections had the opportunity to destroy dental and alveolar tissues, resulting in exfoliation of the tooth. This pattern was
more commonly observed in females than males
and correlates with the differing planes of molar
wear. Females in the sample have a greater wear
angle, a greater frequency of dental abscesses, and
have lost many more teeth than males. The oblique
plane of dental wear (an accentuated reverse
Monson's curve) caused a chain of events that
started with exposure of the pulp cavity, infection,
dental abscess, and exfoliation.
It is unclear in the archeological record what
might be responsible for the differing angle of wear
between the sexes. Smith (1984) reported that agriculturalists have a greater angle of wear than huntergatherers. The female sample from Ernest Witte
Group 1 does appear to have an agricultural-like
wear angle. However, there is little archeological
evidence to support the idea of agriculture on the
Texas Gulf Coastal Plain during any prehistoric
era. In the absence of such evidence other explanations must be considered.
The differences in pathologies may be a factor
of age. While the average age of females (36.5
years) was greater than males (32 years), the overall severity of wear was about the same (see Tables
1, 2). Since the pathological conditions are the result of the pattern of wear, rather than its severity,
age is unlikely to have been a mitigating factor.
Wear could also be attributable to a nonmasticatory use of the dentition related to a division of
labor. Females may have been responsible for an
activity that created the oblique wear angle and the
resulting pathologies. A second possibility is that
the angle of dental wear in Group 1 is the result of
differential diets. There are plant foods in the area
(e.g. pecans, acorns) that can be processed to the
point that they would mimic the soft consistency
usually associated with agricultural crops.

If the first scenario is correct, then one can
only speculate on what materials were being chewed
to explain the wear pattern. Since organic matter
(such as plant fibers or skins) rarely, if ever, survives the soil conditions of the Texas Gulf Coastal
Plain, the archeological record is not particularly
helpful in determining what might be responsible.
Even though we do not know what the females
were processing, the patterns of molar wear and
disease would demonstrate that there was a significant division of labor between men and women that
involved nonmasticatory functions.
The second scenario is perhaps more difficult
to imagine, but it does explain the frequency of
tooth loss and disease of the premolars and molars. This hypothesis would assume that there was
a division of food procurement or processing in
the society by sex. Perhaps the women of the society, remaining in base camps to collect pecans and
acorns ate a more heavily processed diet. The men,
possibly hunting and away from these base camps
for extended periods, would have relied on a less
processed diet. This would have resulted in females displaying an agricultural-like dental wear
pattern and males a flatter, more forager-like wear
pattern.
Overall, the females of Group 1 of the Ernest
Witte site suffered poorer dental health than the
males. While there are significant differences in the
frequencies of AMTL and abscesses, other pathologies, such as calculus, enamel hypoplasias, caries,
and alveolar bone loss, do not differentially select
for one sex over another. In general, the pattern of
dental disease fits the expectation for a prehistoric
hunter-gatherer population. But the angle of dental
wear, and the high frequency of pathologies resulting from it, is noteworthy. While a similar pattern
of wear was observed at Blue Bayou (Colby 1997),
it has not been reported in other Late Archaic populations (see Dockall 1997). Continuing research by
the author of Late Archaic samples suggests that
this phenomenon was not widespread on the Texas
Gulf Coastal Plain.

CONCLUSIONS
Examination of the dental remains from Group
1 of the Ernest Witte site demonstrate that the patterns of dental wear and disease during the Middle
Archaic of the Texas Gulf Coastal Plain are complex. While the overall results are indicative of a

180

hunting and gathering lifestyle, certain aspects of
the sample suggest that either nonmasticatory
functions or diet differed between the sexes. This
differential pattern resulted in a divergent molar
wear patterns and a greater frequency of dental
pathology in females.
While Ernest Witte Group 1 represents the only
significant Middle Archaic population on the Texas
Gulf Coast, further dental investigations from later
populations could help to answer the questions
raised by this report. There are sufficient samples
from the Late Archaic that could be studied to determine if the patterns of dental health and disease
observed in Group 1 are confined to the Middle
Archaic or are continuous through time.

Winston's Mound and Shawnee Town
Mound Explorations by the Bureau of Ethnology
Texas,1882-1884
Timothy K. Perttula

ABSTRACT
The Winston's Mound and Shawnee Town sites are Caddo Indian sites in Northeast Texas excavated in the
1880s by Colonel P. Norris of the Division of Mound Exploration at the Bureau of Ethnology. They represent
some of the earliest archeological investigations of Caddo Indian sites, but have been virtually forgotten and
overlooked since. In this paper, I describe the archeological collections from the sites at the National Museum
of Natural History, Smithsonian Instituiton.

INTRODUCTION
The Division of Mound Exploration of the Bureau of Ethnology, Smithsonian Institution, carried
out investigations of mound sites throughout the
eastern United States between July 1882 and June
1890 (Smith 1985:Table 2; Thomas 1894). Sometime between July 1882 and June 1884 1, Colonel
Philetus W. Norris, of Norris, Michigan, conducted
excavations at two Caddo Indian sites in East Texas
as part of the work of the Division of Mound Exploration. Although not the first archeological work
on Caddo Indian sites in Texas-that honor belongs to Edward Palmer in 1879 (Jeter 1990:66)it still represents very early investigations. However, these investigations have been virtually forgotten and overlooked by modern-day Caddo archeologists. The two sites of interest here are
Winston's Mound on the Red River in Bowie
County, Texas, and the Shawnee Town site near
the Sulphur River in Red River County, Texas.
Small collections of recovered archeological
materials from both these sites are in the Smithsonian Institution's National Museum of Natural
History (NMNH) collections. These collections
were examined and photo-documented in August
2005 during a visit to the NMNH with representatives of the Caddo Nation of Oklahoma as part of
the repatriation efforts of the NMNH, Repatriation
Office. The NMNH, Repatriation Office had compiled a list of their collections from sites in Texas,

Oklahoma, Arkansas, and Louisiana that fall within
the known Caddo area (see Rogers and Sabo 2004),
and this list included the collections from the
Winstons' Mound and Shawnee Town sites. They
had accession numbers that indicated the artifacts
had been collected by the Division of Mound Exploration, and many of the larger sherds have
"Norris" written on them in black ink.
To date, no more specific information about
the two sites-or the work that was actually conducted at them by Norris-has been located in the
Smithsonian Institution's or the National Anthropological Archives records. Searching the records
continues. Perhaps the artifact ledgers of the Division of Mound Exploration or the journals and
letters of Colonel Norris will eventually yield specific information on the sites and where they are
located in Bowie and Red River counties, respectively. If so, they hopefully will add a more-detailed context to this early work on Caddo mound
sites in Texas.

WINSTON'S MOUND
In the available NMNH records, this site is
described as being in Bowie County along the Red
River. I suspect that the mound site is probably
in the eastern half of the county since all the
other known mounds in the county are found
along this stretch of the valley. Other important

and investigated Caddo mounds reported from this
area include the Hatchel (41BW3), Horace Cabe
(41BW14), and Eli Moores (41BW2) sites
northwest of Texarkana, Texas.
The NMNH collections from the Winston's
Mound site include primarily ceramic artifacts, but
there are a series of novaculite and chert blades
present (Figure 1) that are probably associated with
the Caddo occupation at Winston's Mound.

Figure 3. Possible Dunkin Incised jar fragment.

Figure 1. Novaculite blades from the Winston's Mound site.

The ceramics from the site are predominantly
shell-tempered Caddo wares. There is, however, a
grog and bone-tempered bowl that had been decorated with faint vertical engraved lines (Figure 2),
and a possible Dunkin Incised jar decorated with
opposed incised lines on the rim. Remnants of small
loop handles are on the rim (Figure 3).

The shell-tempered wares from the Winston's
Mound site include a plain jar base (Figure 4 ), and
a rim sherd from a distinctive short-rimmed Simms

Engraved vessel (Figure 5), probably a deep carinated bowl.
Other shell-tempered sherds have a curvilinear
appliqued decorative element (Figure 6), red-slipped

Avery Engraved bowl sherds (Figure 7a), horizontal
and red-slipped rims (Figure 7 c ), horizontal
engraved and incised rims (Figure 8a, d), a scalloped
rim from a plain carinated bowl (Figure 8e), as well
as rim and body punctated sherds (Figure 7b and
8b ). One small body sherd from a bottle (see Figurer
7d) has a series of engraved concentric circles.
Two of the sherds have been engraved on the
interior of an interior thickened rim (see Figure 8c, f).
The engraved elements consist of small rectilinear
and hatched elements. These are probably from two
different shell-tempered Bowie Engraved carinated
bowls (see Suhm and Jelks 1962: 17 and Plate 9).

In the NMNH records, the Shawnee Town site
was stated to be in Red River County, near the Sulphur River. It is suspected that the Shawnee Town
mound is located in the southeastern part of Red
River County, perhaps near the confluence of
Shawnee Creek and the Sulphur River. No recorded
mounds are currently known in this part of the county.
The Shawnee Town site is not associated with
any occupation by the Shawnee Indian tribe. The
Shawnee moved into Northeast Texas around 1800,
and had settlements in the Sulphur River basin,
including one reported on Shawnee Creek in the
1820s in Red River County (Steely 1982:20).
Shawnee Town is apparently a more recent name
given by Anglo-American settlers to this area of
Red River County.
The materials recovered by Norris from the
Shawnee Town site include ceramic and lithic artifacts. Among the lithics are a large celt fragment
(Figure 9) made of metamorphic rock (probably
collected from Red River gravel sources), a stone
ear spool (Figure 10a), and an otherwise unmodified but perforated stone pebble (Figure lOc). There
is also a fragment of a ceramic spindle whorl or
perforated sherd in the collection from Shawnee
Town (Figure 10b).
Both shell-tempered and grog-tempered pottery is present in the Shawnee Town collection.
Since the use of shell-temper by the Caddo in this
are did not begin until ca. A.D. 1300 or later, this is
good evidence that the main use of the site by
Caddo peoples took place after A.D. 1300.
These collections include a single group of basal
sherds from an undecorated grog-tempered vessel.

jars. Simms Engraved vessels are usually present
on Caddo sites along the Red River beginning after
ca. A.D. 1500, so at least some part of the Shawnee
Town Caddo occupation-as with the Winston's
Mound Caddo occupation-appears to have taken
place around the time of first European contact
with the Caddo in the mid-16th century.

include a complete Simms Engraved carinated bowl
(Figure 11), four rims from Emory PunctatedIncised vessels (Figure 12), and a number of sherds
with appliqued ridges and punctations as decoration
(Figure 13), probably on the body of large cooking

Also recovered by Norris was a small marine
shell pendant (Figure 14). The pendant has a single
drilled suspension hole at one end.

Division of Mound Exploration of the Bureau of
Ethnology, Smithsonian Institution in the early
1880s. Since that time, the excavations by Colonel P. W. Norris at these two Caddo sites have
been forgotten, and the collections have languished at the Smithsonian Institution ever since.
With an opportunity provided by the Caddo Nation of Oklahoma and the National Museum of
Natural History (NMNH), Repatriation Office,
at the Smithsonian, the collection has now been
examined and cursorily studied in an effort to
bring the two Caddo sites to the light of day.
More investigations are warranted to tell the tale
of the two sites, and hopefully information about
the 1880s work at the sites can be found in the
records of the National Anthropological Archives
and the NMNH.
The artifacts recovered by Colonel Norrisespecially the whole ceramic vessels and the vessel
sections-suggest that in his work, he encountered
burials or other unique features containing whole
vessels. Whether these features were in mound deposits or in off-mound cemeteries is not known at
this time. The kinds of artifacts found at the two
sites also indicate that they were occupied primarily after A.D. 1300 by Caddo Indian groups affiliated with other Caddo communities living on the
Red River and the lower Sulphur River valleys.

ACKNOWLEDGMENTS
I appreciate the opportunity provided by Robert
Cast and Bobby Gonzalez of the Caddo Nation of
Oklahoma, and the Repatriation Office at the
Smithsonian Institution, National Museum of
Natural History (especially Dorothy Lippert), to
study the collections from the Winston's Mound

1. Since Colonel P.W. Norris was not appointed until
August 1882 (Thomas 1894: 19), and began his first mound
exploring expedition from Pipestone County, Minnesota,
on August 29, 1882 (Perttula and Price 1984:3), subsequently working in mound in Missouri, Illinois, Kentucky,
Arkansas, and Mississippi until January 1883, it is likely
that he did not come to Texas until later in 1883.

An Annotated Bibliography of Some Documents Concerning
European and Native American Interactions Across
the Spanish Colonial Borderlands and
the Gulf Coast States, 1629-1758
Patricia R. Lemee

This work began as a simple, chronological
list of information gleaned from documents directly related to the compiler's research which
focused originally on the French Canadian Louis
Juchereau de St. Denis and his trade relationship
with Diego Ramon, commandant at San Juan
Bautista, on the Rio Grande. Individuals who nurtured and guided early phases of the research
pointed out the importance of placing these two
men and their activities in context. Thus, the scope
of research changed, and so, too, the list which
has evolved as a chronological annotated bibliography, for wont of a better description, covering
the years 1629-1758.
In no regard is the bibliography definitive;
rather, it incorporates only those sources examined
by the compiler. Annotations similarly are limited
to those portions of documents or quotes within
documents that directly related to the compiler's
research. No attempt was made to correct authors'
misstatements and/or misconceptions expressed in
quoted passages. Thus, the Saenz letter of November 4, 1720 to Valero is quoted without annotation
concerning Paso del Norte having been called the
Rio del Norte. Of interest to the compiler was
Saenz's further comment that the river froze allowing passage across it of sand-weighted carts from
New Mexico. Whether the title is apt, the work has
served as a useful tool and study guide.
Chief among those who "nurtured and guided"
are Nancy Kenmotsu, A. Joachim McGraw, Robert
S. Weddle, and the late James E. Corbin. Helpful,
too, have been Donald Chipman, Light Cummins,
Hiram Gregory, Dayna Bowker Lee, and Jesus
Maria Ramon, the latter graciously having facilitated research in Mexican archives. The various
contributions of these individuals are valued, and
long will be remembered.

Coupled with study of published and unpublished works, archival research has been conducted in Mexico (Guerrero, Mexico City,
Monclova, Monterrey, Parras, and Saltillo); in
Quebec, the Archives Nationales Quebec in SaintFoy, and the Musee de la Civilisation, Quebec
City; in Louisiana, the Cammie G. Henry Research Center at Northwestern State University
of Louisiana, Natchitoches; The Center for Louisiana Studies at The University of Louisiana,
Lafayette; The Historic New Orleans Collections'
Williams Research Center; The New Orleans Public Library, microfilm collection; Hill Memorial
Library's Louisiana and the Lower Mississippi
Collection at Louisiana State University, Baton
Rouge, and, in Texas, The Nettie Lee Benson Latin
American Collection and The Center for American History, University of Texas, Austin; The
Catholic Archives of Texas, Austin, and the Ralph
W. Steen Library, Special Collections, Stephen F.
Austin University, Nacogdoches.
In addition to a standard bibliography, this annotated version includes a "Source" section designed to enhance its "user-friendliness." Included,
too, is a "Quotes/Notes/Questions" section consisting of extracts from sources. Also in the section are
research notes as well as questions rising from information in the sources. For example, concerning
the 1691 entry for Massanet' s diary of the Teran
Expedition, what link exists, if any, between Fr.
Massanet's "Xoloton" (meaning black nuts) and
Frances Karttunen's "Xoloton," the Nahua word
meaning "little page," the term a lady uses to address her grandchild? Hopefully other researchers
will be able to answer this question, as well as
others posed herein.

"In 1629, Father Salas, accompanied by
soldiers, went rnore than 100 leagues
eastward and worked for a time among
this nation" (Jumano ).

[Note: l league=2.6 or 3.0 miles,

Father Salas this time found Jumano 200
leagues southeast of Santa Fe, on the
Nueces River. Bolton writes, the Nueces
"was clearly a branch of the upper
Colorado."
Captains Hernando Martin and Diego del
Castillo with party of soldiers traveled to
Nueces where pearls were found. Went 50
leagues beyond Jumanos and reached
borders of territory of people called "Tejas"
who were ruled by a king.
Intrigued by tales about pearls and Tejas,
the viceroy sent Diego de Guadalajara with
30 soldiers to the place where Martin and
Castillo had gone four years earlier. He
went 30 leagues beyond Jumano, engaged
in battle with Caitaos, took 200 captives and
"rich spoils in the way ofpeltry." Mendoza,

south is Nueva Galicia and its districts, and
on east is the New Kingdom of Leon.
Boundary runs between Saltillo and the villa
of Monterrey, and extends to Coahuila, and
the Rio del N01ie (which the Indians call
Alcachagua). To [the] northeast the
province stretches to such a longitude that
the boundary is considered to extend as far
as the Colbert River. All of these widely
extended domains are inhabited by
innumerable nations. To the north the
province extends as far as the presidia of El
Paso, which is in latitude 32Â°, less one-third
and from there the bounds of New Mexico
bear toward its c~tal, which is Santa Fe.
"Nations which inhabit the country from
Durango to the junction of the Rio de
Conchas and the Rio del Norte (which the
Indians call Alcachagua) that is, as far as
the said junction and on either side of the

"This land is depopulated and despoiled of
almost everything. Mining and farmwork
ceased, principal mining establishments
have been abandoned as well as the
iITigated and the seasonal crops. The cause
is the extreme boldness and daring of the
Indians for they are continually stealing
horses and killing the inhabitants to such a
degree that without an escort and good
guard the few laborers who have remained
are not able to work. Most of the fortunes
have decayed. To this the epidemic which
prevailed last year ( 1682), and part of that,
contributed not a little, for it destroyed more
than a third of the kingdom, the working
people suffering more generally from this
misfortune."
"From Durango to PaITal are two roads.
One by way of Santa Catalina where there is
a presidio of that name. Distance between
these places is 70 leagues and in that region
live part of widely distributed nation of
Tepeguanes who for many years have
maintained strict fidelity and obedience.
Road is only slightly secure because squads
of Tobosos continually spy upon it. The
road by way of Cuencame is safer and
much travelled because 3 presidios are
situated along it."
"Cocoiomes and Tobosos influence
barbarous nations of region, enciting them

Remedy and relief from these constant

some soldiers at presidio to guard it and to
send remainder of presidia! soldiers to
reconnoitre outlying regions with squads of
40 .or 50 with some friendly Indians as

missions near presidios rather than in

Concerning the Cocoiomes-Tobosos, he
opined that "active and bloody war, without
quarter, should be waged against them, for
they have failed time without number in the
obedience which they promised, being
apostates from the Evangelical law, which
they profess. They are the ones who arouse
other nations against the Spanish by
exciting them with the great amount of
booty which they have acquired .... For there
have been left only the bands of El Tecolote,
Lorencillo, Cejablanca [White Eye-Brow],
El Cola de Coyote [Coyote Tail], and
Contrerillas, which at most cannot reach
100 braves (for thus they call the fighting
Indians)."

Jumano at El Paso

El Paso

"Best time to wage war is in the rainy
season, as water is then found everywhere
easily for the soldiers and horses. The worst
and most difficult time is in the dry season
when there is no water except at long
distances."
Juan Sabeata with some of his Jumanos
and allies shows upin El Paso. Expresses
urgency for Spanish help against the
Apaches. Sabeata lived at a place Spaniards
called La Junta at confluence of Conchas
with Rio Grande; had been baptised at
Parral. Some Jumano lived "eastward of
La Junta on the buffalo plains near the
modern Nueces River." Bolton makes it
clear that this river is distinct from Nueces
at San Saba.

Sabeata represents all chiefs of his
"neighborhood" as well as groups to the
east, including the Tejas, to ask for
missionaries and for help against the
Apaches.

Among 30+ tribes about which Sabeata
spoke, he told particularly about "great
kingdom of Tejas," a populous realm some
15 or 20 days eastward of La Junta and
ruled by a powerful king. "As for the chief
who visited Diego del Castillo, who had been
east many years before, he was not the king
of the Tejas, but merely the king's
lieutenant. The Tejas were a settled people,
he said, and raised grain in such
abundance that they even fed it to their
horses. Tejas were neighbors of Gran

Cruzati reached El Paso, Sabeata had been
there, returned to his land which Sabeata
reports is "6 or 8 days from this pueblo
from where he was sent by all the captains
of different nations who have their
territories in direction of the east." Cruzati
ordered Sabeata and his six companions to
appear before him. The interpreter was
Captain Hernando Martin Serrano, a
citizen of these provinces who knows the
Jumano language.
Sabeata says he "lives with many of his
Jumano nation at the junction of the Rio de!
N01ie and the Concho which must be about
eight days' journey from El Paso." Sabeata
and his 6 captains named Juan, Alonso,
Bartolome, Luis, Francisco and Jose [Note:
Christian names suggest baptism] had
come to ask for ministers "to teach the
Indians in their land where 10,000 were
asking for baptism, among them the
Julimes and Jumanos." Indians also hoped
for protection of Spaniards against their
Apache enemies who have a rancheria very
near theirs. Sabeata referred to old
friendship between Jumano and Spaniards
from New Mexico.
From El Paso "to where other Jumano are
is six days' journey; that buffaloes are 3
days' journey from where Sabeata is at
present. River Las Nueces is 3 days' journey
from that place. There are nuts in such
abundance on this river that they constitute
the maintenance of many nations who enjoy
friendship and barter and exchange with
his Jumano. Those groups are: Miembro

There are other, many nations with whom
the Jumanos trade."
Sabeata said that where he now lives (La
Junta) he left two Indians of the Texas
nation awaiting the reply which Sabeata will
carry in order to take the information to

with us only some families. Sabeata, fearful
of his bad work, fled, for he had plotted
withsome nations to kill us, and then found
out we had learned it already from the same

great fidelity. His conduct [was] so bad, he
was perhaps afraid they [the Indians] would
kill him, for he [Sabeata] remained in bad

the means of our holy law to bring

cross fallen from heaven had appeared to
them,_for those heathen saw there was
small intention on the part of the Spanish to

Said Jumanos were especially important
and they always maintained friendship with
the Spanish. At urgent request of said
barbarians the petitioner went down in
company with two religious persons,
travelling barefoot, until they reached the
place called La Junta de los Rios. There
they found two huts erected by the heathen
where religious began to give catechism and
to build four more huts where nine nations
were sheltered. 500 souls baptised.

provinces of New Mexico from age 14 to 54,
and who had asked the viceroy of New
Spain for the governorship of New Mexico,
presenting his papers and certificates of
service from the said age at his own expense
since he always had the means. Governship
was denied and it was given to a person
"entirely incompetent for the business, from
whom there were expected many losses."
Seeing he had not secured the govemship,
General Mendoza presented this second
petition to make an expedition to the lands
in the east and north. He is the only one for
this expedition, and in order to force out the
French (who now may be settled there) for
he is fully experienced in matters of war and
known to be a man of good fortune in it. "I
do not know what will result from this
second memorial, but I believe it will be the
same of the first." The general has desired
to take a ship and place himself at the feet of
the Majesty to inform him concerning all
these kingdoms and provinces, as one who
has explored and penetrated them, but,
finding himself in falling fortunes. ("For in
the loss of New Mexico he lost more than
40,000 pesos, besides the loss by death of
more than 66 persons of his blood.") The
small means he now has have not permitted
him to C<llJY out his wish.

[Note: Interestingly, the Mescales, the
Jumanos and the Apis/Apes later were
between Brazos River and Colorado River at
Rancheria Grande; further, in 1690, a
Mescale "who had been with the Tejas
more than a year, "appeared before Alonso
de Leon in Monclova.]
Massanet writes that "Zacatsol is 20 leagues
beyond Rio Grande which is the river that
comes from the north and is called Rio de!
Norte. From mission of San Salvador to the
said sierra there are 60 leagues, and
Coahuila the same." Distance from Mission
San Salvador (Massanet's mission at
Caldera, Coahuila, Mexico) is 60 leagues,
and from Coahuila the same.
[Note: This confirms Leon's statement that
it is 40 leagues from Coahuila (Monclova)
to Rio Grande and 20 leagues more to
Zacatsol. However, Fr. Larios (in 1675)
says it is 60 leagues from Monclova to Rio
Grande. Either Larios' calculations were
erroneous or possibly he crossed upriver
from Eagle Pass. Larios, the son of a

tribe called (5) Nacachau. Between this tribe
and one of (6) Nazadachotzi which is
located toward the east on the road to the

between the tribes is another called (7)
Cachae. Their boundary begins at the home

"From mission I founded in the Valle de
Santiago, under the name of San Salvador
[near Cerralvo] up to this place all the
Indians speak the same language. From
this place to Los Techas are other
languages. There follow the Indian nations
of Catqueca, Cantona, Emet, Cauas
[Cavas], Zana, Rojo [Tojo], Toaa and
others. The place refened to, on account of
being on the borderline of Indians who,
although they are all friendly and do not
wage war, speak a different language. This
same place ... which they call Xoloton which
means 'black nuts.' These other last-named
nations who are on the road to Los Techas,
call it [Xoloton] Bataconiquiyoqui."
"[W]e encountered an Indian coming on
horseback. Indians said the captains of
Choma, Cibola, Cantona, Cholome, Cat,
Queca and Caynaya nations were coming to
receive us peaceably. Captains appeared, all
on horseback. They had small saddles they
had taken from Apaches in war. They
produced two letters from religious who had
remained "last year" among the Techas, the
letters sent by an Indian who had come
from Los Techas."
They headed to their village on Rio
Guadalupe, travelling northeast through
level country with low hills. Halted on bank
of arroyo that unites with the river;
rancheria was in the woods. Named place
San Gerbasio. In the Indian language it is
called Conaqueyadeta, that is to say, where
the river rises.
"One captain was Juan Sabeata with his
people and nation of the Choma. Choma,
Cibola and Caynaaya lived and have their
lands on the banks of the Rio de! Norte.
They likewise border on the Apache Indians
and have wars with them. The Indians of
the Choma nation are the ones whom in
Parral and New Mexico they call Jumanes.
Every year they come to the head of the Rio
de Guadalupe and sometimes as far as the
Techas. Come to kill buffaloes, and as soon
as cold weather begins, they retire to their
own country."
[Th ]e said Indians [Jumano] every year
enter Pana! and Paso del Nuevo Mexico.

[Guadalupe] was for the buffalo and to
bring the pelts."

Concerning Xoloton, Karttunen writes,
"When we examine the Bancroft Dialogues,
a sixteenth-century Nahuatl text that
exemplifies polite direct address among
people of different age, rank, and sex, we
find that courtesy involves indirection to the
point of actual inversion of stated
relationships." Continuing, "when a lady
speaks to her own grandchild, she refers to
him as xoloton, 'little page'."

An account of the coming of Captain
Mathias Lujan from his alcaldia of
Picuries, Picuries is a pueblo. Some
Indians came to Picuries to trade. Those
Apaches brought news a large number of
Frenchman are coming toward plains of
Cibola; that Apaches are retreating to this
(Picuries) neighborhood on account of
frequent attacks made on them by
Frenchmen.
He orders some of his men to return to
Picuries to interrogate those Apaches who
brought news of Frenchmen.

They told Apaches at Picuries the Spanish
were their friends and Apaches replied they
were very pleased about that. Spaniards
asked about Frenchmen beyond their
territory. Apaches said that seven nations
beyond the region where they live, very far
from these pmis, had informed them that
certain white men came to the bank of the
water and made war on the people of
Quivira and other parts and presently they
go away, and again return and make war
and go away, and that it is very far off, and
they have not seen them, and that they have
this report from other nations hostile to
them, giving to understand that they who
have given them the said information are
their enemies and slaves.
In a council of war in Mexico in January
1696, the fiscal stated that Luis Gramillo,
an Apache, had information that many
Frenchmen were coming toward the Plains
of Cibola. Later, in October, two Apache
chiefs visiting Taos said that 6 tribes on the

"Mountain orientation of most Apachean
groups, including those who ultimately
came to be considered Plains people, is well
documented. Only Kiowa Apache, and
possibly those who became known as the
Lipan, eventually committed themselves
predominantly to the plains. Even so, the
movements of the Lipan in particular were
affected by conflicts with the Comanche
from the l 8'h century onward. Before
suffering a major defeat by Comanche in
1723, they (Lipan) had been living near the
Llaneria Grande north of San Antonio,
Texas."
"Ethnohistory of Lipan is more obscure,
but on basis of linguistic..and other cultural
evidence, there is little doubt that they and
the Jicarilla share a close common heritage.
Historic Lipan and Jicarilla may both
consist of aggregates of various Apachean
groups noted throughout the 17'h&l8th
centuries in the Texas-Oklahoma
Panhandle region."
"Lipan seem to have been in close
association with Jicarilla and both may
represent the coalescence of some of the
earlier Plains and transitional zone Apache
who were noted by chroniclers in the region
of northeastern New Mexico, the TexasOklahoma Panhandle, and the
southwestern Nebraska regions. By the
1700s the Comanche advancing from the
north pushed them into west Texas where
again they established themselves in the
vicinity of mountainous terrain. We can see
reflections of the mobility in scattered
references to the confrontations they had
with the French and their (French) Pawnee

Sauvolle advises Iberville that before his

Mississippi River [Note: at place known
from that time until now as English Tum]
an English corvette of 10 guns commanded
by William Lewis Bond. [Note: Iberville
previously had captured Bond's ship during
battle at Hudson Bay.]
Bond told Bienville that three ships left
London in October 1698 to establish a
settlement on the Mississippi River. One
ship returned to London; two continued in
May 1699 from Carolina where most
passengers had remained [Note: these were
Huguenots.] Bond had "gone looking" for
the Mississippi 30-40 leagues east of where
the relations about Louisiana written by the
Recollet Father and Tonty (sic) had located
it; there he found only poor harbors and a
Spanish post "about 90 leagues west of this
river."
[Note: Concerning the three English ships,
they are believed to have been part of Daniel
Coxe's company, Coxe having then recently
purchased the Carolana patent.]
"They believe, as I do," Iberville writes
about the reported Spanish post, "that is St.
Louis Bay." One English ship had "gone
on, followed coast to the west to explore it as
far as Panuco."

Iberville moves quickly to establish a post on
the Mississippi in order to take possession
of it before the English. Prepared for
journey up the Marne (Red) River near
where the Senis (Hasinai) live. Iberville
"sent M. de St. Denis on with two pirogues
and two bark canoes to take the lead."
He went up Red River near the upper part
of which the Senis [Asinais] live.
In boat with 18 men, 14 left at Bayougoulas.
Men with him are from Illinois and
Tamarouas living on both sides of
Mississippi near mouths of Illinois and
Missouri rivers. French missionary sent
there in 1700.
Iberville wrote, "I have no need to take
naval cadets into the woods, or a good many
of the others, who are not at all suited."
[Note: One of those Iberville believed well
suited, he later demonstrated, was St.
Denis.l
Iberville sent St. Denis on with 2 pirogues
and 2 bark canoes to take the lead and to
hunt if they find game within 15 leagues
from here.

"6 a.m. set out in canoe with 6 men to go to
Taensas and to get everything ready to go
overland to Senis, leaving my brother with
rest of my men at Nadchez (sic) to prepare
meal for the journey, where it is more easily
done than at Taensas."
Interrogated Indians about nations west of
them and along River Marne, questioning
particularly a Ouatchita (sic) Indian who
had been to Caddaquios and to some
Spanish posts. He (Ouatchita) reports roads
as difficult, whole route being overland.
Said he would guide Iberville if he were paid
well.
Iberville writes, "My brother (Bienville) and
the Sieur de St.Denis got ready to set out
with 20 men to go by land to the Senis. I
could not make this journey because of an
aching in the knees, which prevents me
from walkin_&"
Iberville mentions his brother Bienville and
St. Denis had set out for the Red River
exploration with one Shawnee, one
Ouachita who is the _g_uide, and six Taensas.

"With several Cadodaquios at this village
and one Naouadiche and one Nadaco I
have discussed the neighboring areas of this
country. They all tell me that they have been
to a Spanish settlement, which is five-1/2
days by land to the west of this village. They
go and come on horseback. At those
establishments, they say, the Spaniards have
four pieces of cannon. There are a number
of men, women, and children, whites, and
mulattoes and blacks, and they till the soil.
The settlement is close to the village of the
Nouadiches. The Nouadiche who talks to
me says that he lived with them nearly a
year and on several occasions went on
horseback with some Spaniards, who he
tells me are black, apparently Negroes, to
another settlement, which he locates five
days' travel west-northwest of the former
one. At this settlement there were only
Negroes with their families. He reports
them to be rather numerous and leads us to
believe that the Negroes at this settlement did
not welcome any white Spaniard; and when
white ones came, the blacks drove them off
without speaking to them; he had not,
however, seen them fight each other. He
gives the name of this settlement as
Connessi, that is, the Blacks; and the first
one, the Spanish settlement, he calls in their
language Yayecha. He reports that by land
it is three days northwest by west from
Connessi to the Chomans, and that from
the Chomans to the Conoatinos and to three
other nations it is approximately one and
two days' journey. These four nations
make war on the Spaniards and on all the
Indians to the south and southeast and east
of them. According to all Indians of this
village, the River Mame (Red) flows to the
village of the Cadodaquios and divides into
two branches one day's journey above
them: one runs to the northeast and the
other to the west-northwest. Along this
branch are two nations: one is called
Chaquantie, which is four days from the
Cadodaquios; the other is named the
Canchy. These Indians are at peace with the
Canoatinos, who are numerous."

Natchitoches explained that Canneci,
variously spelled in the record, was a Caddo
word which referred to Apaches, although
according to Bienville (above) the word
meant "blacks." It is known that Lipan
slaves in the Natchitoches area later were
described in the historic record as
Canneci/Connessi/Canchy.
The precise meaning of the term remains in

of the term. Future research perhaps will
determine whether the black Spaniards of

"Indians at missions consume all com

Bienville and 20 Canadians, including StDenis, on Red River [Note: river also called

Indians abandoned their villages to build
their huts on platforms. They could not go

St. Denis to return to explore the upper part
of Mame (Red) River. Levasseur was to
accompany him to make maps and take
careful observations of the latitude. Six
others to accompany them. St. Denis to have
"the Spaniard" to see whether he can
discover some mines. They were to try
reaching the Quiouahan who are at war
with the Spaniards. They were to leave the
fort on the Mississippi River at the
beginning of August ( 1700); to take also the
Nadchito (sic) and the Naouadiche (sic) and
to give each of the two a gun and some
ammunition, a cloak, and a shirt. Trade
goods he should take included twenty shirts,
twenty hatchets, eight dozen knives, three
dozen mirrors, a hundred awls, three dozen
chisels, one-half pound of vennillion, one
hundred needles and twenty pounds of glass
beads.

Two points: (1) says two Tejas Indians have

Royal Road (camino real) of the Tejas and

with Frenchmen."
[Note: Some historians have interpreted the
camino real reference to mean "the camino
real to Espiritu Santo." My interpretation is
"on the camino real of the Tejas and (at)
Espiritu Santo." In 1700, Espiritu Santo is
a placename associated not exclusively with
the Texas Gulf CoastJ

Bautista and (b) himself commanded
presidia at San Antonio, Texas. Discussion
about French in East Texas; about "three
crosses" (tres cruses) on Trinity River.
Urrutia related the declaration of one Tejas
who he said "was called Muchacho who
has "mujer de usanza" of his own nation
and who is native of the Province of the
Tejas and of the Asinais nation."
Muchacho reported that 30 Frenchmen
whom he knew to be French from being like
the ones he had seen from Espiritu Santo
Bay, came and on another occasion among
the Tejas in the place which they call Los
Nazones which is between the Caudadachos
and Tejas. He stayed for 1-1/2 yrs. Said
Frenchmen spoke with the captain of
Nazones. Frenchmen wished to proceed to
the Tejas. They told them (the Frenchmen)
the Spaniards were still among the Tejas
and for this reason they did not pass.
Frenchmen gave Indians two muskets and
Indians gave them two horses. French
came to said place on foot, dressed in long
coats of different colors with white hats with
feathers, and their guns and others with
shawl-like peasant caps with which they
covered the face. And he heard said to other
Indians that 50 or 60 leagues beyond the
Caudadachos, Frenchmen had built many
earthen houses on the banks of the river.
And that they come approaching the
Caudadachos and French bring with them
religious who wear habits like these of StFrancis and hoods like Cocurochos and
that said French are coming near to them.
Because they come, inhabiting and making
earthen houses, his uncle, the governor of
the Tejas Indians, sent him on this mission,
in the month when the corn was tall, to ask
for religious that they might come to the
three crosses, 100 leagues beyond their land
which is called the Rio San Marcos where
they wish to come to settle because of the
good lands. The repmi was not received
under oath because the Indian was a
heathen (unbaptised). Fr. San
Buenaventura also asked the viceroy for
suppmi (oxen, axes, food, Tlaxcalteco
Indian families, blue cloth to clothe the
Indians and two loads oftobaco in place of
beads because these do not serve them) of
the Rio Grande mission San Juan Bautista
and Solano. Asked also that Captain
Protector for that region be appointed.

16 families of Tlaxcalteco Indians were sent
from Saltillo to Rio Grande missions.
Repmis he left orders with Sauvole to send
St. Denis, in early August, with 7 men to go
up the Marne (Red) River. States he had
written St. Denis at the Mississippi (Fort de
la Boulaye) that it was important when he
should reach the Thocanhe, a nation 4 days
above the Cadodaquis (sic), to arrange to
have them guide him to the Canoatinos, at
war with the Spaniards. Also, he is to make
an alliance with them and to propose an
alliance or peace with the Cadodaquis, in
order that the French can travel easily to the
Canoatinos without offending the
Cadodaquis. Iberville ordered St. Denis to
purchase Spanish slaves from the
Canoatinos.

called Xijames, belonging to Mission

if they did not, they would steal their women

Ervipiame killed 14 Payaye; made slaves of

Cadillac went to Pensacola to meet with
Governor Salinas Varona (variously
referred to as commandant and governor)
for two reasons: ( 1) to discuss measures
they could take to obtain for him the
assistance he needs, and (2) to get
information from him for explorations and
to organize an exchange of commerce by
sea and by land with New Spain. Result was
to send French vessel Baron de la Fauche
to Vera Cruz, the governor having
chartered it for a return voyage at rate of
4,000 piastres per month and security for
the ship in the name of the Catholic King
with half the cargo (still aboard ship)
having not been unloaded upon arrival
from France.

in lieu of persuing charges against him
(Salinas Varona), he has ordered Salinas
Varona to pay the charter fees from his own
money. Sent 15,940 pesos [Note: This was
presumably to pay the gmTison at

commerce with them (those arriving aboard
the vessel) nor merchandise from what
came in it. Linares mentions his uncertainty

which we believed to be an outlet from the
San Marcos River. With a little wind it had
waves like the sea. The Texas Indians call
the enlargement Sapinay. But going on up
above the said junction we explored Cenito
Colorado which, at Bahia, was always
thought to be on the banks of the Colorado
or Espiritu Santo River. On the plains that
are bounded by the lagoons it would be
possible to locate the settlement; and I judge
that a boat could ascend the river, enter the
lagoon, and explore it to determine upon the
conveniences the various locations may

St. Denis says he is 38 years old when
actually he then was 41. St. Denis says it
has been "17 years less 11 months" since
he left Old France. (Note: it actually was 17
years plus 11 months when St. Denis left
France aboard the Renomee with Iberville.)
St. Denis declared it had been 20 years since
he "set out from New France" [Canada]
and he has not returned to it.

Shelby
1923: 165-183

[Note: The above dates St/ Denis' departure
from Canada as 1697 which corroborates a
later reference to his detainment in France
with those arriving there from
Newfoundland with Iberville's brother
Serigny. St. Denis is listed as one of the
engagees detained in France to sail with
Iberville on his 2nct voyage to Louisiana if
the colony there were deemed sufficiently
successful to merit continuation.]
Also, reference to goods brought: St. Denis
reports there was cloth, lace, brocade, etc.
which he was bringing "for his wife to
wear."
[Note: Manuela still was in Mexico as of
April 1717 and, presumably, still there at
time of St. Denis's September declaration in
Mexico.]
Refers to his "wife and children at Rio del
Norte [San Juan Bautisita.]."
[Note: Thus, Manuela did not leave Mexico
with Ramon expedition of 1716. Further, by
September 1717, the couple had at least 2
children.]
Interesting discussion of Indian groups;
refers to Apache as Padoca.
[Note: French records demonstrate the te1m
Padoca/Padouca first was used by
Frenchmen referring to Apache groups;
later, Frenchmen used the term when
referring instead to Comanches.]
St. Denis mentions a Frenchman who came
to visit him in prison, "Francisco Pudrie,
who was arrested" (released by 18'1 of Sept
1717).

return for San Antonio. Got as far as
Trinity River where he spent 20+ days
because it was flooded. He arrived back in
San Antonio late December and learned in
January that St. Denis had been through
the area and was headed east to Louisiana.

[Note: Alarcon had received no scouting
report about St. Denis when, in fact, the
men most probably were in the same area at
approximately the same time! Most
probably St. Denis was east of the Trinity

The Apache chief says "French have built

as Taos. In these the French live with
Pawnees and Jumanos to whom they have
given long guns which they [the French]
have taught them to shoot. They also carry
some small guns suspended from their
belts. At the time of their battle with the
Apaches, the Apaches told the
French/Pawnee/Jumanos they would advise
their friends, the Spaniards, in order that
they might defend them. The French
responded they were greatly pleased to have
them notify the Spanish and bring them
there, for they are women "crionas" [sic]
these are words, however rude, that the
Indians are accustomed to use to incite ire.]
All enemy were dressed in (torn out??) that
they have done them much damage in
taking away their lands and that each day
they are coming closer. This is the reason
that moved Apaches to come, establishing
themselves on the lower part of the river
[Note: Napastle =Arkansas] to be able to
live in safety from their enemies." Apaches
said French also have "three other
settlements on the other side of the large
river, and that frbm these they bring arms
and the rest of the things they bring to those
which they have recently constructed. They
know this because they were told by some

[Note: Juan Antonio de la Pena's version

Possibly she based her reference to miles in
Buckley's article re: Aguayo expedition. It is
interesting that 30 leagues (using 2.6
miles/league) from San Antonio= 78 miles
= possibly region of Montopolis crossing on

rationale is thus: predicated on online

Quotes/ Notes/ Questions
Survivors took refuge with some Apaches
(no band name given). Spanish survivors
and some Apaches offered services for
retalliation. One Apache said French live in
round houses which hold four persons. On
their roofs were large arquebuses. Apache
women, escaped from the French, reported
these houses.
Saenz defers to veracity and well-known
fidelity of Valverde. Mentions plans
underway by Aguayo in accordance with
royal order that French not penetrate the
territories of this royal domain (mentioning
Texas). Notes Valverde did not mention by
what river the French had made ingress.
Then he provides a long discussion about
possibilities. He says if French come by Rio
de! Norte (Rio Grande) they easily could
penetrate Parral and other presidios to the
destruction of the royal dominion.
Continuing, he says they "follow the Rio de!
Norte to the Paso de! Norte [El Paso] which
they call the Rio de! Norte." He says at this
pass the river freezes so that with sand the
carts which go from New Mexico can cross.
He instructs Aguayo regarding Texas to
make "an offensive and a defensive war in
Texas" for the express purpose of cutting
off the French penetration to New Mexico
by the Mississippi and the Palisada. [Note:
these are two names for one river.}
Mentions French allies are the Pawnee,
Utes, Comanches and Canceres.
This concerns the French penetrating the
region of Julimes and allying them against
Spanish; mentions 45 Spaniards killed in
Villasur expedition massacre. He mentions
the French and Pawnee probably cannot
reach Julimes of the rebellious six nations
situated near junction of the Rio de! Norte
and Sacramento because: (a) it is too far
and (b) there are other tribes, some
antagonistic like the Apaches and others
with neither dependence upon nor alliance
with them, like the Conchos and Zumas. It
appears the French come to river of the
Pawnees by the Missouri. Revolledo says
that Aguayo is to be notified and, if he sees
any Pawnees, to mistrust them as he does
the French, but to find out distance from
Pawnees to the Tejas. Aguayo is to inform
Pawnee of affection for Spanish of Indians
at La Jicarilla.
Martinez criticizes Valverde for not leading
expedition as ordered and for sending
instead Villasur. He has nothing good to
say about the man. He speaks candidly, and
says Villasur was completely inexperienced
in military affairs and the management of
arms. He also identifies the Rio Jesus
Maria as the River of the Pawnee = South
Platte.

La Harpe writes that Bienville received a
letter from Renaud, commandant at

August 15. La Harpe explains Bienville was
concerned Aguayo might overpower
Natchitoches and Bienville would be blamed
because he had not given command of the
post to St. Denis who many people believe
had a great influence of the Indian nations.
Thus, Bienville decided, against his will, to
put St. Denis in command and relieve
Renaud of his duties.
"I always exercised all the care and
vigilance possible to prevent French from
trading in the places that I had reduced.
This, I understand, has been their purpose,
and not settlement, and I earnestly believe
they would have succeeeded had it not been
for the opposition that I offered, in order to
dislodge them. Finding myself in a certain
place and being informed they were 6
leagues away I sent two soldiers with a letter
from the leader of the said French to find
out whether the news I had was correct. It
turned out to be true, but there were only 25
Frenchmen--five men and 20 naked and
barefoot boys, who were lodged in some
huts without any sort of shelter or
protection. They saw in another hut much

Governor Cabello later wrote that scurvy

Missionary assembled Tamique and
Xaranames at new mission site. New
captain (Juan Bustillos), seeing it
impossible to take water from the river to
irrigate the land, moved La Bahia presidio
to the side of the mission. This occurred
between February 1725 (date of Aguayo's
r~01Q. and 1726.
Makes clear Aguayo was governor of two
Spanish provinces: Nuevas Philipinas (later
called Texas) and Coahuila-not then one
province of Coahuila y Tejas. "The viceroy
having accepted it [Aguayo's offer], he
conferred upon him, for this, in my royal
name, the offices of governor and captaingeneral of the said provinces ofNuevas
Filipinas and of Coahuila."
Aguayo established presidios in Texas with
25 men; another among the Adays with 100
men; one on bay of Espiritu Santo. "These
were without expense to my real hacienda.
Sent map and plans and affidavits of having
reestablished the said 6 missions [in Texas],
and of having erected three more besides,
one at La Bahia, and two in San Antonio."
"Berenger, Jean. Naval captain, interred
June 18, 1730."

St. Denis acknowledges Gonzales'

moving the French fort to the Spanish side
of the river) "you have done your duty." St.
Denis says he will continue to build the new

and the French Kanecios. These Apache
Indians are in the eastern part of the

Pichardo says these Indians are those that

"considering that the gravity of the business
admits of no delay, and that there are in the
province of Los Texas the nations of
heathen Indians who are
mentioned ... requesting baptism and to
unite with the body of the church (which is
the principal object that I have ordered to be
attended to and promoted); and that that
country, because of its extent, its
uninhabited state, and its proximity to the
regions where the French have intruded,
deserves greater care and vigilance, to the
end that they [the French] may be prevented
from inciting and winning the idolatrous
Indians to their side."
"Father Fray Mariasno Francisco de los
Dolores y Viana came upon a large
assemblage of various nations-Mayeyes,
Yojuanes, Deadoses, Vi dais, and others"

"The site of their rancheria was 70 leagues
distant from San Antonio, and they had
located it in a valley which was situated
between the two rivers of Las Animas and
San Xavier, at the palce where they unite.
They thereby obtained protection, and had
their families and droves of horses
[cavalladas] safeguarded from the invasions
of the Apaches. They likewise had an
abundance of walnuts, medlars, plums,
grapes and many other fruits; the chase of
the bear, deer, buffaloes, turkeys, and
rabbits lured them; but the strongest
reasons was that that site was at about the
center of all the points where lived their
relatives and allies. For, their nations being
very numerous, it was necssary for them to
divide to enable them to maintain themselves; but in such manner that. if, because
of war with the Apaches, or for some other
reason, they desired to unite, they could
send up smokes as a signal to do so."

as 70 leagues] from San Antonio, situated
in a valley surrounded by the hills of the two
rivers, the Animas and the San Xavier, at
the very place where they joined. This
natural enclosure afforded protection for
their families and stock against the attacks
of the Apaches.At the same time, it provided
them with the abundant supplies of nuts,
medlars, plums, grapes, and many other
frutis, which attracted game: bear, deer,
buffalo, turkey, and rabbit. More important,
it was a converging point for all the pathes

HIGHLIGHTING THE SOCIETY

The Society offers its members and the public many avenues for participating in the archeology of Texas: this Bulletin, the quarterly Newsletter, public lectures at the annual meeting, the
annual meeting, field schools, and more. Highlighting is devoted to showcasing those exciting
avenues to ensure that all members know of, and can take advantage of, other aspects of the
Society. This year we highlight the many members that actively participate in Texas archeology as
members of regional societies. Often, at the request of local landowners, those regional societies
perform archeological work on private land, accurately documenting sites and conducting excavations. Like professionals, these members recognize the need to document those excavations, either
through publication of small monographs, articles in a well-circulated publication, or, in this case,
the Bulletin. As such, these reports are an important part of the archeological record and provide
documentation that can be used by future researchers. Alice Stultz, an active TAS member and an
Archeological Steward for the Texas Historical Commission, here documents the excavations of
the Concho Valley Archeological Society at an archeological site in Concho County.
Readers who are non-members and wish to learn more about the Society or to become

A Prehistoric and Early Settlers' Site (41CC328)
on the Upper Reaches of Brady Creek
Alice Stultz

INTRODUCTION
This project addressed a two-fold interest by the Concho Valley Archeological Society (CVAS) to:
(1) practice "hands-on" archeological methods in the field; and, (2) assist a landowner who desired
information about the many Early Archaic to Late Prehistoric
artifacts on part of her land. As a result of these combined
interests, the CV AS, with the assistance of Dan Potter, Regional Archeologist with the Texas Historical Commission
(THC), undertook test excavation units at site 41 CC328. The
units were located contiguous to a spring on the landowner's
property. The spring is also adjacent to a State Archeological
Landmark (SAL), site 41CC298, which consists of around 45
known and documented mortar holes in bedrock slabs. Site
41CC298 is less than 150 meters away from site 41CC328. A
surface survey of 41 CC328, in the fall of 2004 after the SAL
celebration and dedication, yielded Early Archaic to Late
Prehistoric points (Figure 1) and a large variety of broken
historic glass, metal and pottery. The CV AS did two days of
surface survey and excavated five test units around two historic settler's headquarters' foundations in conjunction with

SITE LOCATION

The site is located near a spring that drains into Brady Creek. It is adjacent to US 83, south of Eden and
north of Menard, Texas. This is an area rich in prehistoric and historic sites. Burnt and fire-cracked rock is
prolific over the entire area. The owner of the site is a member of the second family who occupied and
ranched this land. Although adjacent to site 41 CC298, the SAL with mortar holes, no mortar holes have
been found on site 41 CC328. Due to the current use of the land for sheep and deer hunting, a surface survey
of the site was conducted in autumn, 2004 but the test units were not dug until February, 2005.
At the celebration for the SAL designation and dedication, archeological interest developed in studying
the land adjacent to the mortar hole site. Notes were taken at that time in order to fill out a site form and
obtain the site number and later the test units were placed in locations selected by Dan Potter of the THC,
the author, and the landowner. In February, interference with specific agricultural activities (sheep lambing) and recreational activities (leasing for deer hunting) was not a matter of concern, so the landowner was
pleased to allow the CV AS to undertake the excavations. The test units also gave the CV AS an opportunity
for "hands on" archeological methods in the field that was different from the majority of their work. Prior
to this experience, the CV AS has primarily focused on cavalry posts and camps in West Texas such as
Camp Elizabeth, Grierson Springs, Fort Concho, and Fort Chadbourne.
The original plan was to open up two test units. However, five one by one meter units were laid out with
the transit and GPS designations by Dan Potter with the help of CVAS members (Figure 2). After beginning
work on the site, two of these units
were aborted due to weather and
two other units were laid out.

BACKGROUND
Early recorded history of this
south central portion of land in
Concho County was derived from
the landowner's research. The site
is mainly comprised of two parcels
of land (2027 and 2030) and a portion of another south of Brady
Creek. The original grantee of parcel 2027 (patented on May 25,
1856) was George Friedrich Mueller who bought the land on May
22, 1858. After seven absentee
landowners speculated on this land
on the frontier, M. H. Robinson
sold the land to Charles Edward
and Samuel Waring for $50.00 on
August 3, 1876. Two years later,
Samuel Waring paid $160 to
Charles Edward Waring for the undivided interest of his brother's land
on October 27, 1878.
Parcel 2030 (patented November 25, 1854) was originally
granted to Karl Haas. Four absentee landowners speculated on the
land. On October 5, 1895 the

Waring brothers leased it for $8.00 per year from Wakeman and Tainter, both of New York. Charles E. and
Samuel Waring had actually served as tenants since September 22, 1887. On March 25, 1899 Samuel
Waring purchased the north half from Jesup Wakeman and the south half from Charles M. Tainter. On
August 21, 1907 it was declared a homestead of approximately 200 acres. A homestead in Texas is a legal
instrument to protect a domicile and possessions thereon from creditors and taxing authorities in case of
default of payment. The significance of the instrument in this case establishes the fact that this loc;ation was
the primary headquarters of the Waring family who owned and operated 22 112 contiguous sections of
land. 1 As with these parcels, the Waring brothers acquired the land by purchase.
On March 3, 1873, Gideon Pace patented one league and one labor of land. This land was issued to the
heirs of Gideon Pace on January 25, 187 5 in lieu of lost headright Certificate 102, a certificate that was lost
on the frontier. On February 22, 1875, James, Robert and Demsy Pace and Laura Key lick received the land
from an affidavit of heirship after the death of their father Gideon Pace. On December 15, 1896, a general
warranty deed from Mary C. Paschal, administrix of the estate of I.H. Paschal, deceased, sold the land to
Samuel and Charles E. Waring for $2.00 per acre. The aforementioned Charles Waring, born in Ireland,
never married and died in 1898 in Concho County. His brother, Samuel Waring was born December 14,
1860 in Ireland and died April 10, 1924 in Concho County. He was married July 23, 1891 to Elizabeth
Sarah Molloy.
As the foregoing lays out, the first landowners to actually live and work the ranch were the Waring
brothers. The next landowners were the current landowner's parents, Richard Jesse and Rosa Lapp Jesse.
The existing ranch house, smoke house, laundry house with cistern and garage attached, and outbuildings
were present prior to 1939 when the landowner, Margaret Rose Jesse Loveless, was born. She was the
fourth of four children. She remembers the drought in the 1950s when her father had 300 sheep that he fed
daily augmented with burned prickly pear as feed.
Richard Jesse was aware of and basically protected the mortar holes at site 41CC298. He was also
cognizant of the presence of artifacts on the land where site 41 CC328 is situated, but he left them
undisturbed. Nonetheless, some pilfering from poachers has occurred over the years. Erosion during the
drought of the 1950s revealed surface artifacts and young collectors were allowed on the land by permission
of the landowner. Margaret has a collection of cobalt blue Vicks Vapor Rub jars from many decades,
vanilla extract bottles, French harps, clock pieces, purple glass, square nails, wire, car parts and gun pieces
from the site (Margaret Rose Jesse Loveless, personal communication 2004).

SITE DESCRIPTION
The site is located in the Edwards Plateau physiogeographic region in a live oak savannah. 2 The soil
has a shallow depth to limestone bedrock and is dominated by cobbles. The land in Concho County is
gently undulating with elevations from 1,400 feet near the Colorado River to 2,400 feet in the southwest
part of the county (Clower and Dowell 1990: 1), and average rainfall is around 23 inches. Summers are hot
and winters are fairly warm with rain in early fall and late spring. Snow is rare with 49 degrees being the
average winter daily temperature and 82 degrees the average daily summer temperature. The average
winter lows are in the low 40s but temperatures reach the mid 90s in the summer. Sheep, goats, and beef
cattle are the principle ranching stock with 75 percent of the land used as rangeland. The rest is mainly
cultivated in crops of hay, wheat, and oats, cotton, grain and forage sorghum.
The soils in the immediate area using the SCS Soil Series are NuA, TKC, KtB, Fr, RoA and KXB
(Clower and Dowell 1988:42). The silty clay loam soil is severalJeet thick and slopes gently toward the
spring. Many of the soils at the site are mollisols. In the vicinity of the spring, permeability is slow as is
consistent with a spring bed (Clower and Dowell 1988:53).
The site is located adjacent to the spring that bubbles visibly in the winter months prior to spring
foliage growth. In times of drought, it disappears except for the higher concentration of vegetation in the
area. The site slopes to the spring in a gradual undulating manner with the rockier soil at higher elevations
and with a higher concentration of vegetation at the lower level. Predominantly the vegetation on the site
consists of live oak, mesquite, pecan, buffalo grass, coastal Bermuda, agarita, red grama, Texas grama,

258

heavy tridens, three awns, western ragweed, broomweed, horehound, lotesbush, sideoats grama, Engleman
daisy, tasajilla, and prickly pear.
The major disturbances to the site are the pit areas where soil was removed for the construction of US
83 from Eden to Menard. That highway is just west of the site. The Texas highway department made the
southernmost pit when constructing US 83 in the 1930s. The northernmost pit was made during a US 83
construction improvement project in the 1950s when "shoulders" were added to the highway along with
straightening of the existing curves about a mile south of the site. The landowner mentioned that inside
these pits dirt had been leveled for rain water collection for livestock.
East of these two pits lies the less disturbed area of the site. In this less disturbed area, there are two
approximately five meter long rock foundation walls flush with the ground level. The foundation walls are
on a high point of the site. Brick remnants can be seen to the northwest of the foundation walls. In addition
to the two walls, the surface has revealed an area of high concentration of broken glass, gun parts, china and
pottery (historic), French harp parts, black wind chargers (3/4 inch by three inches long black cylinders that
supplied wind power to the house) and square nails. A water well that was hand dug is situated about 30
meters from each of these two rock protrusions. These walls are too far apart for a single structure.
Moreover, in old photographs, the house is shown in relation to the well, indicating that it was not of a size
to encompass both rock walls.
Fortunately, the site has not been root plowed. Instead, the mesquite trees were killed with coal oil in
the 1940s, thereby protecting the archeological deposits of the site. The ebbing and flowing of the spring
waters and rains have caused some erosional changes to the site. Other impacts to the site stem from
overstocking cattle and sheep and wind erosion during the drought of the 1950s.
The elevation is highest at the caliche pit rim dropping towards the east to springs that bubble up presently
after autumn rains. The landowner noted these are seasonal and appear after fall rains and prior to the
mesquite trees sprouting in the spring. The spring was not visible during the surface survey in the fall of 2004.

DESCRIPTION OF FIELD WORK
A surface survey in the fall of 2004, during the SAL celebration nearby, yielded Early Archaic to Late
Prehistoric points and a large variety of broken historic glass, metal and pottery. At that time the landowner
discussed her interest in learning about the site nearby and asked the CVAS to work on the property at a
later date. February 2005 was agreed upon to avoid lambing and deer leasing activities.
Dan Potter (Figure 3) of THC
met the landowner, author and
some of the members of CVAS on
February 3, 2005. Two datum
rebars were located and set in concrete. One was near an area of
heavy concentration of fire cracked
rock and the other was adjacent to
a well between the spring and the
two rock foundation protrusions.
The well was probably dug between
the 1880s and the 1890s. Elevations and measurements were set at
each of five test units using the transit (see Figure 2). The first test unit
was near the heavy fire cracked
rock area. An Early Archaic Nolan
point was found on the surface
nearby (Turner and Hesterl985:
Figure 3. Dan Potter taking notes during excavations at site 41CC328.
132). The next unit was placed near

Highlighting the Society

259

a probable historic "trash pit" that had long been a source of interest to the landowner. The next two units
were near each of two rock foundation lines that were about 30 meters apart. Their distance from each other
seemed to indicate that they did not belong to a single structure. The fifth unit was on a higher elevated
slope and southwest of the structure foundations but equidistant to the spring approximately 20-30 meters
from the damp ooze of the spring water the day of the study.
In addition to these five units, two other units were opened near a large live oak tree, locally known as
"the hitching post tree." Late Prehistoric Scallorn points (Turner and Hester 1985: 189) and burnt rock were
prolific in this area, and the landowner wanted to see what the group would find in test units in this area as
well. This was also an area equidistant from the spring, similar to the other units.
A crew chief was designated at each unit and only two units were opened at a time. At least 20
members of the CVAS worked on the site during the four days of activity (Figure 4). The units were dug in
10 centimeter levels. Shovels were used to remove the winter forbs and grasses on the surface of each unit.
Each unit was to be dug 10 to 20 centimeters beyond encounters of sterile soil. This was done in all but two
units; it could not be accomplished
in those two units due to time and
weather. The soil was collected in
buckets and screened using one
quarter inch screen over sawhorses. Artifacts were collected on
the screen and put in bags for laboratory cleaning and analysis. Photographs were taken of features
and artifacts were photographed in
the laboratory.
The primary datum was buried with concrete into the ground
at E0422569 N3449367. All measurements were taken from this
datum and with the transit at this
point. Another datum was set north
of the well at the historic foundations. This was also set using NAD

83 and was E0420600 N33449367.

RESULTS
All units were in a semicircle around the spring, northeast of the area with large quantities of burned
rock. Unit N991 E995 was dug to a depth of 58 centimeters. The soil was primarily dark, sandy loam
throughout the unit. The unit's surface elevation was 92.43 meters. In the first eight centimeters there were
a few primary and secondary chert flakes with fire cracked limestone (Table 1). Chert cores and clear bottle
glass were also present. Secondary and finishing flakes were in the top 2-3 centimeters of the level.
However, there was a marked reduction of lithic artifacts in Level 2, and fire cracked rock (FCR) was
absent. In Level 3, FCR was again present as well as a mixture of historic pottery shards, bottle glass, bone,
and chert debitage. In the fourth level, there was evidence of repeated and sustained fires based on the FCR,
lime chalk, non-structural daub in the dark sandy loam matrix. One small semicircular scraper that was
extensively worked was found with 54 pieces of chert debitage and 3 sherds of clear bottle glass. Level 5
yielded large pieces of FCR in dark sandy loam with two bone fragments of a medium size animal, and 32
chert flakes of various sizes. Level 6 was basically sterile except for 10 small pieces of debitage. The unit
was closed and back filled at this point.
Unit N906 E977 was located near the house foundation area. This unit was dug to 55 centimeters from
datum elevation of 99.95 meters. The first level contained mixed historic artifacts with a few prehistoric

artifacts in a dark, sandy loam matrix (Table 2). Artifacts from the level included a wire nail, copper clasp,
iron fitting, 20 sherds of clear bottle glass and two sherds of blue green (Coca Cola) bottle glass, sherds of
porcelain and white glazed earthenware pottery, a high number of pieces of chert debitage, one base of a
broken dart point, a chert drill, and bone. In Level 2 the historical artifacts were absent but, as Table 2
shows, there were significant quantities of debitage, along with 16 bone fragments of various sized animals.
The level also contained two mussel shell fragments, one semicircular chert scraper, and one broken spear
point tip. Level 3 contained an even higher quantity of lithic artifacts in a dark, sandy loam matrix. The
flakes consisted of 13 primary and 80 secondary flakes. Four bone fragments were recovered. In addition to
these, one chert scraper, two point bases, one chert drill or awl, and one sherd of white glazed earthenware
were recovered (Figure 5). Soil in Level 4 changed from dark sandy loam to medium brown sandy loam
with ash, tiny charcoal pieces and few artifacts. One human juvenile bicuspid, one tusk (possibly of boar),
six bone fragments, 36 pieces of debitage and one projectile point perform were recovered. The final level
contained what appeared to be a small hearth in medium brown sandy loam (Feature 1). The matrix of the
feature contained small flecks of ash and charcoal. The charcoal was too small to collect a sample. The
interior of the hearth was approximately 20 centimeters wide. In this level there was one unfinished point of
indeterminate type, one small end scraper, one bone fragment, one mussel shell fragment, and four thinning
flakes. After photos were taken and drawings made the unit was back filled.

Unit N935 E977 was on the south edge of the
presumed house foundation with a surface elevation of 99 .17 meters. This was one of the early
ranch buildings constructed prior to the 1930s. There
is a photo of this house in the 1940s with girls
"kodaking" on a Sunday afternoon (i.e., taking photographs) and the well is visible in the background
(Figure 6). The unit was placed on the presumed
stoop or porch area of the house. Level one was
dug to 15 centimeters. As expected, many of the
artifacts were historic and probably related to the
house. Flat window glass sherds were prominent
(n = 67). Other historic artifacts include a brown
clay marble, a rusted knife blade measuring 16
centimeters long by two centimeters at its widest

of a clear glass bottle with "o" marking on the side,
and two metal nail-like pieces of metal (one possibly a square nail). Prehistoric artifacts include one mussel shell and 20 pieces of debitage. Level 2 had a
damp, dark loamy matrix containing 186 pieces of debitage, two dart fragments with well worked bifacial
edges (possibly Frio or Uvalde [Turner and Hester 1985:100,155]), one large chert core, and one unifacial
flint scraper (Figure 7). Level 3 was a dark sandy loam containing 80 pieces of chert consisting of 20 large
chert flakes and 60 pieces of debitage. Other artifacts include a unifacial scraper, one point base, and one
dart point. The next level was dug to a depth of 45 centimeters and it contained 52 debitage, four bone
fragments and a point base. In level 5, dug to a depth of 55 centimeters, there were 54 small pieces of
debitage with two small shell fragments. The lower eight centimeters of this level were sterile so it was
decided to close this unit and backfill the dirt.

Another unit was opened 40 meters east from N906 E977. It was called "hitching post unit" for
simplicity. Unlike most of the other units, no pottery was recovered from this unit. Moreover, overall
recovery in the hitching post unit was smaller than in the other four units. In Level 1 of this unit the soil was
a dark, sandy loam. The flakes were of various sizes. One flake could be the center portion of a point or
blade. Several metal pieces (including two fence staples, one 12 gauge shotgun shell base, and one piece of
glass with the initials "U.S.") were also recovered. Level 2, dug to a depth of 20 centimeters, had soil that
was the same dark sandy loam but damper than in Level 1. This level contained a higher quantity of chert
than the first level, of which 11 were large chert spalls. A piece of hematite or ferrous sandstone was also

recovered. Level 3 was in the same dark, sandy loam containing several small, decomposed bone fragments,
one fence staple, and 25 pieces of debitage. Level 4 was dug to a depth of 40 centimeters of dark, sandy
loam. In addition to 48 flakes, the level contained three mammal teeth and one point base (Figure 8). The
matrix of Level 5 was a loose sandy, loam containing 82 flakes of various sizes, 29 bone fragments (most
less than 3 centimeters), one large possible bison tooth, one large mussel shell, one lower quarter of a lance
point resembling a Firstview, Midland, Milnesand or Scottsbluff. It has a fine parallel flaking and the "flat
foot" of the Scottsbluff, but the base is more angled to the outside than is normal with Scottsbluff. In
addition, one triangular point (possibly an Early Triangular) that has been pitted and abused from fire
(Figure 9) was recovered. Level 6 was sterile.
The final unit was opened next to the "hitching post unit." That unit was 39 meters east of N906 E977.
It was dug in 10 centimeter units from surface to a depth of only 30 centimeters. It was closed at this point
due to a prediction of rain on the already saturated soil. Level I was freely mixed with historic and lithic
artifacts (Table 5). In addition to flakes, the level had three pieces of wire, two pieces of oxidized iron, one
clothing grommet, two square nails, one white porcelain sherd, four pieces of bone, and one unguent tooth.
Level 2 had similar items but the historic artifacts decreased in proportion to the prehistoric although this

CONCLUSIONS
41CC328 is a site that has been used through the centuries by many people. By using arbitrary and
controlled surface surveys and five test units, we found that the site has a mixture of historic and prehistoric
artifacts, much as we had predicted. Bone, teeth, fire cracked rock, debitage from construction of chert
tools and performs and scrapers were found that would have supported prehistoric activities at the site.
Historically, this spring site was home for early ranching activity in Concho County after 1880. The land at
the site has not been radically disturbed by root plowing, a common practice in this part of Texas that can
severely impact archeological deposits. However, east of the site are two caliche pits made by the highway
department in the 1930s and 1950s for highway improvements.

The soil at the site is predominantly silty clay loam. (Clower and Dowell 1988:51-58). It is dark brown
ranging from 7.5YR 4/2 to 7.5 YR 3/2 and dark brown lOYR 4/2 with a moderately fine granular structure.
On the slopes of the site the soil runs from shallow, calcariferous and rocky to a gradual deeper, silty clay
loam as the ground approaches the spring and boggy area around the spring. These soils are consistent with
primarily live oak, pecan and mesquite trees; grama, Bermuda, bluestem, heavy tridens and buffalo grasses;
and prickly pear, tasajilla, Engleman daisy, agarita, and horehound.
Historically, this region was used in the early statehood of Texas with cavalry posts scattered at
intervals throughout the county. Early ranching began in the late 1880s, and modem ranching of cattle,
sheep and goats continues today. At the site itself, there are two small protruding foundations that appear to
represent structures in close proximity to a hand-dug water well. Window glass and other artifacts from a
unit placed near one of the foundations were consistent with photographs taken around 1940s on the porch
of the ranch house.
There is a large quantity of fire cracked rock throughout the site with an increased concentration
northwest of the spring. The entire site is also littered with lithic material, ranging from cores and preforms
to finely chipped points and debitage. Fire cracked rock is also evident with reddish and black coloration
and sharp edges. The site is represented by artifacts from the Paleo-Indian with the possible Scottsbluff
(7120 B.C. to 6650 B.C.); Martindale (4000 B.C. to 1000 A.D.), Nolan (4000 B.C. to 2500 B.C.), and
possible Early Triangular (3700 B.C. to 3600 B.C); (Turner and Hester 1985:89, 100, 120-121, 126, 132,
139-140, 150-151, 155, 189). Scallorn arrow points associated with the late Prehistoric era (A.D.700 to
1200) were numerous on the surface and in the landowners' collection of the site. A fire pit or hearth
(Feature 1) was noted in one test unit and a soil change believed to be evidence charring was noted in the
unit placed in the area of the concentration of burnt rock. As mentioned, the site is approximately 150
meters from site 41CC298 that contains 45 known mortar holes. Due to their proximity, it is possible that
the some of the occupants of site 41 CC328 also contributed to the construction and use of the mortar holes
at41CC298.

FUTURE OF THE SITE
The owner plans to leave the site as it is and allow no disturbance by current ranch operations. The
hope is for little future disturbance as well. She hopes to one day create a museum of some of the ranch
outbuildings with the items collected from the site to preserve the heritage of the area for future landowners. The family was delightful to work with and have become avid avocational archeologists with education
and preservation being their primary goal. This appears to be a rich site and one which the landowner and
the CV AS may partnership to further explore and educate its members.

This 471-page folio volume is a moreextensively edited and updated sequel to the 1995
edition of the Bulletin of the Texas Archeological
Society. In editor Timothy K. Perttula's words, "Our
primary goal is to record and communicate, in one
accessible source, what has been learned (and what
we still do not know) about all aspects of Texas
archeology from about 1950 to 2000." While many
of the individual chapters are updated versions of the
1995 volume, some are completely new chapters.
The book accomplishes that stated goal, and is
destined to be an essential reference for the foreseeable future. That is not to say that the volume
does not have its problems-it does. In giving the
1950 to 2000 range for an update, we are led to
expect a fuller review of findings during that 50year period since the Handbook of Texas Archeology was published (Suhm, Krieger, and Jelks, 1954),
but in reality, the emphasis is upon what has been
learned since a late 1980s multi-volume overview
funded by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers was
published. That multi-volume set is a limited edition series in the so-called "gray literature" of contract archeology that is not readily accessible to the
public. In fairness to the authors, though, their reliance upon that series varies greatly within the individual chapters.
In keeping with tradition, I will first describe
the contents of this book, and make mostly positive
comments as I go along. The amount of detail I
provide for each chapter varies in relation to how
widely the region is known, and how much new
synthesis is provided. This is minimal in some chapters, and prodigious in others. Then, I will make a
few specific comments about perceived problems
at the end of the review. So, if you want to know
what is in the book, read the first part of the review;
if you want the irritating snippets that irk me, then
read the second part. Better yet, just go ahead and
read both.
Perttula organized the book into six parts
comprised of 13 chapters followed by the references

cited and a page g1vmg information about the
authors. An acknowledgements page following the
table of contents recognizes key individuals and
their contributions to the production of the volume.
Individual chapters end with a short acknowledgements section. Part One is titled "Texas Prehistory"
and contains two chapters. The first chapter is "An
Introduction to Texas Prehistoric Archeology" by
Perttula in which he summarizes the history of
important syntheses of Texas archeology, and accurately states the need for the present volume. The
second half of the introduction describes the organization of the volume. It is organized primarily upon
physiographic regions, and secondarily upon
specific cultural complexes within single or adjacent
regions. This follows traditional treatments of
Texas, for better or for worse. Table 1.1 presents a
very useful summary of chronological schemes for
eleven regions and shows the variability currently
in vogue across the state, while a series of figures
illustrate the archeologic, physiographic, and biotic
regions. Other figures identify important archeological sites during the Paleoindian, Archaic, and
Late Prehistoric periods.
Chapter Two is entitled "Paleoindian Archeology in Texas" and is written by C. Britt Bousman,
Barry W. Baker, and Anne C. Kerr. This comprehensive summary first reviews the history of Early
Man studies in Texas, then embarks upon a detailed
analysis of projectile point forms found within that
period. Statistical analyses are used to suggest a
reclassification of selected lanceolate dart points.
Key Paleoindian sites are reviewed with both descriptions and discussions of geologic stratigraphy.
A section on "Absolute Chronology" follows in
which extremely detailed descriptions are provided
for the Paleoindian date sequence, and which includes tables of radiocarbon date analyses. A section called "Components and Site Distributions"
contains a huge table listing known Paleoindian
sites and their recorded components extracted from
the Texas Archeological Research Laboratory

(TARL) files at The University of Texas at Austin.
A series of maps follows this in which sites with
specific types of projectile points are plotted. A
section on "Subsistence" discusses foodstuffs in a
more comprehensive manner than most of those
normally seen in treatises dealing with Paleoindianage remains. Particularly useful is another large
table listing the primary faunal remains found at
the many Texas Paleoindian sites. A short section
describing the scant human remains known from
this period is followed by another short section,
"Assemblage Comparisons and Lithic Technology."
The tables provide quantitative comparisons of artifact assemblages and comparisons of source materials from which the artifacts are manufactured.
A very short discussion on transitions into the Archaic period ends the chapter.
Part Two, "The Hunter-Gatherers of the Central
and Southern Texas Prairies and Plains," also contains two chapters and is led off by Chapter Three,
"Archeology of Central Texas," prepared by Michael
B. Collins. He states he eschews a synthesis in favor
of a critique of practice, a summation of what we
currently know, and a consideration of ways by
which we can learn more before a succeeding synthesis is written. It is good that he reiterates that, by
whatever names they are called, chronological constructs are essential. This leads into a description of
Central Texas as an archeological area, and about
the chronology that has been constructed as well as
other accomplishments. This is followed by a discussion of the French term "gisement" and its' application to the region. While I bridle at being urged
to use this term, the discussion of deep stratified
sites is very good in light of the excellent chronological charts provided to illustrate the fascinating
time depth and vertical control found in Central
Texas. His preference for the term "interval" for
chronological segments is something that bears serious consideration. The following synthesis is indeed brief considering the vast data available, but
the illustrations of key chronologically sensitive artifacts are parsimoniously chosen to illustrate the
many changes through time evident in this region.
The concluding section challenges practitioners to
look more closely at such things as plant and animal
remains directly instead of using tools as proxies for
infen-ing generalized adaptations.
Chapter Four, "The Prehistory of South
Texas," by Thomas R. Hester defines the highly
variable region succinctly and provides a brief
description of historical biotic changes before

embarking upon a description of "The Nature of
the South Texas Archeological Record" in which
the geomorphic character-and problems-of sites
in the region is summarized. The contrasts with
the Central Texas region helps one understand the
difficulties encountered in teasing out the
geological and cultural history in this area. The
following "Cultural-Historical Framework"
summarizes the chronology and illustrates key
artifacts found in each time period. Hester's use
of the term "horizon" is a bit askew to the
preceding chapter, but if one mentally inserts
"interval" wherever "horizon" is used, it is much
less jarring to the senses. The array of artifacts
illustrated is greater than the previous chapter,
and it is good to see items other than lithics
properly illustrated. The discussions of shell
artifacts, and of the subregion of the Rio Grande
Delta are welcome inclusions.
Part III is titled "Coastal Groups" and contains
two chapters written by Robert A. Ricklis. Chapter
Five, "Prehistoric Occupations of the Central and
Lower Texas Coast: A Regional Overview, "begins
with a review of key site excavations and syntheses
that emphasize the contributions made by T. N.
Campbell, Dee Ann Story, and James E. Corbin."
Ricklis then defines the Central Texas Coast as a
region, and summarizes its physiographic evolution during the late Pleistocene and throughout the
Holocene geological periods. The discussion of
chronology begins with a rejection of the previous
concept of an Aransas focus, phase, or complex
during the Archaic period; he also rejects
Weinstein's more recent proposed series of phases
as inherently flawed due to inadequate definition.
The Late Prehistoric-age Rockport phase is seen as
the archeological correlate of the historic ethnic
group known as Karankawa. A brief discussion of
radiocarbon dating includes Table 5.1 that lists 81
assays thought to be in good cultural and stratigraphic eontexts (62 of these are from Ricklis' own
work) that extend over 7,000 years B.P. (corrected).
The Early Archaic occupations are discussed
relative to shoreline occupations during specific
time intervals as documented by the radiocarbon
dates presented in Table 5.1. This is a very effective manner of presentation, and drives home the
relationship between human occupations on the
coast and global climatic events that control environmental conditions in the region. Figure 5.7
graphically demonstrates the radiocarbon sequence
in relation to sea level rises, stillstands, and

268

Texas Archeological Society

highstands. Examples of stone and shell tools of the
Early Archaic period are well illustrated. The
Middle Archaic coincides with a probable sea level
highstand, and evidence of occupation during this
time is ephemeral. The Late Archaic sees a surge in
shellfish utilization, especially moderate to high
salinity species such as oyster, scallop, sunray
venus, quahog, and lightning whelk. Abundant fish
remains, attested by the numbers of otoliths (literally, ear stones; actually, ear bones) per square
meter, are seen toward the end of the Late Archaic
as illustrated by Figures 5 .11 and 5.12. Diagnostic
stone tools illustrated include a variety of both triangular unstemmed and stemmed dart points, while
shell tools include whelk whorl (outer body) adzes
and hammers as well as whelk columella (central
spiral column) gouges (again, probably adzes).
Some bone tools, including socketed points and
awls or flaking tools, are also illustrated. Basketry
is known through impressions left in burned clay
and in asphaltum lumps and it is during this time
that formal cemeteries become common.
The Late Prehistoric period is divided into an
earlier Initial and a later Final subperiod. The Initial Late Prehistoric is characterized by triangular
arrow points, corner-notched arrow points as well
as plain sandy-past ceramics and, toward the end of
the subperiod, by the locally distinct Rockport ware
ceramics. Subsistence remains are overwhelmingly
dominated by shellfish and fish, which reflect the
natural bounty of the estuarine environment. The
Final subperiod equates with the Toyah phase/horizon/interval of adjacent inland Central Texas. Contracting stem Perdiz type arrow points and lithic
tools associated with bison hunting and processing
are added to the resident coastal tool kit. The
Rockport ceramics become more elaborate in this
subperiod, and bison bones are added to the deer
bones, shellfish, and fish remains that demonstrate
the meat protein diet of the coastal zone residents.
Ricklis follows this by presentation of a model illustrating the long-term human responses to rapid
environmental changes in the Coastal Bend region.
As presented in Figure 5.24, Ricklis has developed
a simple elegant model that illustrates the complexities of life along the coastal zone very effectively. This chapter ends with a brief discussion of
the lower portion of the Texas Coast, including the
Rio Grande Delta. It is unfortunate that this area is
not treated in detail, but in light of Hester's previous chapter, this can be forgiven. It is quite interesting to note, though, that Ricklis finds merit in

the resource zone adaptation models presented by
Tomka and Bousman (1990), and gives a thoughtprovoking discussion of that model, in contrast to
Hester's previous chapter in which the attention is
given to the mechanics of trade between the Rio
Grande Delta peoples and the peoples of the
Huastecan region to the south.
Chapter Six, also written by Ricklis, deals with
"The Archeology of the Native American Occupation of Southeast Texas." A definition of the area of
concern, which bridges four major ecotones in a
cross-hair fashion, concludes with a declaration that
the chapter will focus on selected work that postdates the syntheses and overviews provided by Aten
(1983) and Story (1990). A brief description of the
modern environment segues into a discussion of
paleoenvironmental change that relies heavily upon
geomorphology for a review of long term climate
change and the relationship of Holocene sea level
fluctuation with the evolution of the modern coastal
environment. Figure 6.2 illustrating the currently hypothesized relative sea level is particularly informative, and sets the stage discussing the archeology.
Little is known about the Paleoindian period
along the Texas Gulf coast since most items of that
age have been found either in surface contexts,
eroded contexts (such as McFaddin Beach locality), or in mixed deposits where materials are commingled with those of Archaic age. That Paleoindian
people lived in the region is not disputed; the problem identified is that no one has found a discrete
component of that age to provide reliable information about what the inhabitants were doing (other
than using projectile points such as Clovis, Folsom,
San Patrice, Scottsbluff, and such). His discussion
of the inland Archaic is not much more detailed,
but does include a generalized projectile point sequence for the region (Figure 6.3). Among other
things, I am a bit surprised at the age ascribed to the
Neches River and Trinity dart point types; I should
think their position should be reversed with that of
the Bell/Andice/Calf Creek, but this reflects the
difficulty of producing a Central Texas-type chronology in an area dominated by mixed, bioturbated
sandy deposits. The description of Late Archaic
large cemeteries is concise and accurate. The coastal
Archaic, which begins about 5,000 B.P., is treated
in a bit more detail, and includes (in addition to
shellfish) information about relatively abundant vertebrate fauna! remains which are lacking in the
inland sites. Bone and shell tools, ornaments, and
other items are common relative to the sparse lithics

Reviews 269

that occur in the lithics-poor region. A discussion
called "Holocene Evolution of the coastal Environment and Human Shoreline Occupation during the
Archaic" gives well-reasoned details about the relationships of people, resources, shorelines, and their
complex interactions, and is backed up by excellent
graphics relating radiocarbon dated components to
sea level rises, highstands, and stillstands.
Ricklis treats the Ceramic Period in more detail than the Archaic, and meshes recent work with
a lot of information derived from Aten's work
regarding chronology and diachronic trends on the
upper coast. This is divided into Early Ceramic
and Late Prehistoric periods, and well illustrated
with charts, lithic tool forms, and the myriad variations of ceramic vessel forms and decorative motifs. The Mitchell Ridge Site is used to discuss
"Demographic and Cultural Change during
Protohistoric and Early Historic Times." Included
are illustrations of elaborate bone and shell musical instruments and ornaments as well as lithic
tools. A summary of the Ceramic Period relates
cmTent information to the Mossy Grove Tradition
and includes recent proposed models that describe
settlement and subsistence patterns. The chapter
ends with a summary that suggests key points for
continued regional research, led by suggestions
regarding poor chronological controls in the inland area and learning more about understanding
the radiocarbon calibration needed on estuarine
shell assays, and ending with a plea Jo look east of
the Sabine River to develop understanding of the
relationship with upper coastal people with those
inhabiting what is now southern Lousisiana.
Part IV, titled "The Desert Archeology of Western Texas," again is comprised of two chapters.
Chapter Seven, written by Myles R. Miller and
Nancy A. Kenmotsu, is called "Prehistory of the
Jornada Mogollon and Eastern Trans-Pecos Regions
of West Texas," is one of the longer chapters in the
volume. The reason for the length is quickly explained as they review the previous research and
show that a comprehensive synthesis has not been
forthcoming since the mid-Twentieth century. They
specifically opt to present a dual approach wherein
an overall cultural-historical structure is maintained,
but emphasize trends in "settlement mobility and
landscape use, changes in subsistence economies
as reflected in dependence upon domesticated versus no-domesticated plants and animals, and how
changes in technology, settlement structure, and
social organization reflect the evolution of these

settlement and subsistence systems." That is a tall
order, but one upon which they deliver due in no
small part to their inclusion of considerable illuminating data from the adjacent states of New Mexico
and Chihuahua.
The environment and climate of the region,
which is situated in the basin and range physiographic province, is reviewed first and is followed
by a concise section titled "Status of Archeological
Investigations and Background for Inquiry." Data
on site density and distribution are presented along
with numbers of radiocarbon dates and dated sites
by county, which is paired with a distribution map,
provide background for a traditional cultural historical figure correlating the relative sequences in
the Eastern and Western Trans-Pecos subregions.
Pre-Clovis (or Pre-Projectile Point) evidence is reviewed and shown to be lacking in substance. Detailed data are presented for the Paleoindian Period,
and is divided into discussions of Clovis, Folsom,
and Late Paleoindian manifestations. This is followed by a thorough discussion of the Archaic Period that is packed with references. As with many
areas, the Early Archaic is found to be difficult to
deal with due to a paucity of quality data; much of
the better stratigraphic relationships come from
three rockshelters in New Mexico and one deeply
buried site near Balmorhea. Figure 7 .11 illustrates
projectile point forms for the entire Archaic in the
region, but formal names are not provided even
though several names are used in the text. The
Middle Archaic Period also suffers from a lack of
quality data during the early portions, but open
sites on alluvial fans are shown to have yielded
greater amounts of data for the later part of the
period. In addition to thermal features, small habitation structures are documented at this time, and
radiocarbon support from several sites is illustrated.
The Late Archaic is shown to have experienced a
significant increase in features, numbers of sites,
and an inferred increase in population accompanied
by expansion into a greater range of ecological
zones. The development of horticulture and agriculture during this period is thoroughly discussed,
and includes tabulation of radiocarbon assays performed on corn samples. A range of other economically important plants are identified that show distinct changes in subsistence patterns. An excellent
comparison is made contrasting the emerging dependence upon agriculture in the Western TransPecos versus the continuation of some variation of
hunting and gathering in the Eastern Trans-Pecos.

270

Texas Archeological Society

The Archaic section concludes with a presentation
of general trends during the period. Settlement and
demographic trends are illustrated with a series of
five sets of summed radiocarbon probability samples
and a chart comparing projectile point forms by
distribution and through time. Data is also presented illustrating changes relating to projectile
point form and technology changes; these focus on
haft configurations and blade edge characteristics.
Regional interaction is examined by looking at
quantities and sources of raw materials.
Considerable discussion is presented for the
Formative/Late Prehistoric Period, beginning with
a detailed examination of the internal chronology.
Problems are aired regarding traditional tripartite
terminologies, and how various developments occur at different times, thus crosscutting commonly
used phase names and chronological divisions based
upon architectural styles. Probably more importantly, they point out that increased agricultural
specialization seems to have occurred between about
A.D. 1250 and A.D 1450. Descriptions of architectural forms explores the variations in structural
forms, beginning with rounded semi-subteITanean,
then to single square or rectangular, to multi-feature room blocks, and how these vary through time
and by settlement/subsistence characteristics. The
succeeding discussions on dating the architectural
sequence are effectively illustrated by summed
probability histograms of both radiocarbon and
archeomagnetic assays. Radiocarbon assay results
are used for the La Junta area around Presidio. A
review of variations in settlement layout presents
intriguing changes in intensity of use of certain
areas (and supposedly resource zones). Figure 7.25
is a fascinating radiometric histogram illustrating
the relationships among pithouse floor contexts,
secondary trash deposits, and rock-lined thermal
features. The complex relationships of plazas, villages, and extramural features are also considered.
This segues into settlement pattern and land uses
that presents the Fort Bliss segment of the Tularosa
Basin in New Mexico as a model. Once again,
summed radiocarbon probability histograms are
used effectively to illustrate changes in land use
patterns (Figure 7 .28). The following discussion of
Formative Period subsistence patterns focuses on
the variability between domestic and non-domestic
food plants since faunal resource data are scarce.
Technological patterns during this period include a
discussion of thermal and storage features whose
trends are effectively illustrated through summed

radiocarbon probability histograms. The essentials
of ground stone are followed by a similar treatment
of ceramics (this is not a guide to ceramics identification), and brief mention is made of variations in
aITow point styles.
The next section discusses the general Late
Prehistoric developments in the Eastern TransPecos, which saw relatively little work between
1940 and about 1980. Essentially, the Archaic
lifeways continued in this region, but sites like Wind
Canyon are used to show regional interaction between the agriculturalists and non-agriculturalists.
The pithouse villages near La Junta are described,
as are the circular stone structures ascribed to the
Cielo Complex. The section concludes with mention of various aITow point styles and their utility in
examining extra-regional interactions. The chapter
concludes with a section dealing with the PostPueblo through Early Spanish Colonial Period. The
near-abandonment of the El Paso region is contrasted with the rectangular multi-room structures
near La Junta and the circular Cielo Complex structures that occur near and to the east of La Junta.
While the structures near La Junta can be linked to
the historically identified Patarabueyes, the Cielo
Complex circular structures are not conclusively
associated with the Jumano, nor have structures
related to the historically known Manso and Suma
been conclusively identified in the Lower Valley
area of El Paso. Establishment of missions in the
A.D. l.600s and the relocation of groups subsequent to the Pueblo Revolt of 1680 are described,
and a detailed review of faunal, floral, and stmctural remains from this period end the section. A
short Summary ends the chapter with a reminder
that the Jornada Mogollon and Eastern Trans-Pecos
should not be overlooked as a fertile place to examine numerous aspects of prehistory and history that
are essential to understanding what is happening in
adjacent regions.
Chapter Eight, by Solveig A. Turpin, is entitled
"The Lower Pecos River Region of Texas and
Northern Mexico." She describes the area centered
on the confluence of the Pecos River with the Rio
Grande as the smallest of the defined archeological
regions, and attributes the definition to its
association with the extent of distinctive rock art
found in the rugged canyons. A reiteration of the
strong ties between hunter-gatherer adaptations and
environmental factors leads into a brief review of
the regional Holocene climatic conditions. Regional
variability in dependable water sources, and the

Reviews 271

paucity of quality data in the southern half of the
region (northern Coahuila), still allows the
conclusion that the region as a whole shared a single
belief system as expressed in the rock art. A review
of other geologic factors affecting the archeological
record is followed by mention of known historic
changes in geomorphology and biota, ending with
the observation that the composition of extant flora
and fauna are the product of modern livestock
husbandry. A basic history of archeological research
includes reference to over 300 radiocarbon assays
from the area, and the current chronological
framework is illustrated (Figure 8.1 ). The introductory section ends with a description of two competing models interpreting the prehistoric adaptations in the region.
The remainder of this chapter reviews the chronological sequence in descending order of Period
and Subperiod, beginning with the Paleoindian that
is divided into three subperiods. The inclusion of
the pre-12,000 B.P. Aurora Subperiod based upon
two sites may prove controversial, but the remains
at Bonfire Shelter and Cueva Quebrada cannot be
totally ignored at the behest of the Clovis first theorists. The Bonfire Subperiod is based on Bone Bed
2 at Bonfire Shelter where extinct bison are found
to have been killed with a variety of projectile point
styles, including Folsom and Plainview, during a
mesic climatic period. Late Paleoindian is included
within the Oriente Subperiod where broad resource
procurement strategies are reflected. Notably, the
earliest known fiber or textile industry appears during this time. The Archaic is divided into the obligatory early, middle, and late, with subperiods assigned to these broad subdivisions. Entrenchment
of the local adaptation is seen in the Early Archaic,
a period during which drought and erosion were
experienced in the region. The presence-and useof rockshelters as habitation sites preserved human
waste in the semi-arid desert environment in a way
that is only dreamed of in other regions. Thus,
features such as latrines and artifacts of wood, fiber, and bone provide detailed information not available in adjacent areas. Changes in the fiber industry, projectile points and other tools, and mortuary
practices are reviewed through the succeeding
subperiods of the Archaic. Notable is the abrupt
appearance ofL.ower Pecos River style polychrome
rock paintings beginning at the outset of the San
Felipe Subperiod about 4100 B.P. Several things
cause Turpin to argue for increasing regionalization
of the people during the Early and Middle Archaic.

She postulates increased population stressed by
limiting ecological factors, and presents two competing models to explain responses that might ex plain the appearance of rock art as a communication
device that relieves social tension and competition.
Abrupt changes are noted in the Late Archaic
beginning with the Cibola Subperiod when bison
reappeared in the region during a mesic climatic
interval. Tools and rock art styles (the Red Linear
style) leads to a suggestion of an influx of new
people, but whether they replaced the previous
residents or coexisted with them is left open to
further examination. A return to drier conditions
in the Flanders and Blue Hills Subperiods are again
associated with changes in tool and rock art styles.
Once again, regional intensification is suggested
to correlate with broad resource procurement, diversified diet, and mobility within the environment. The Late Prehistoric sees the introduction
of the bow and arrow during the Flecha Subperiod,
and the appearance of Red Monochrome sty le rock
art. Notably, ring middens seem to consistently
yield radiocarbon dates of this subperiod even
though much older projectile point styles are also
associated with these food processing facilities. A
case is also made for foreign incursion based on
mortuary customs as well as clothing and adornment styles displayed in the rock art. The Infierno
Phase ends the prehistoric discussion. It is characterized by stone circles representing pole anchors(?) w;ed for shelters such as wikiups or possibly small tipis. The tool kit is characterized by
flake blade projectile points, steeply beveled end
scrapers, and ceramics. Turpin suggests these are
intrusive peoples, possibly representing a prehistoric expression of the historically described annual hunting trips to the mouth of the Pecos River
by people from northern Mexico. While the widespread Toyah phase/horizon/tradition to the north
and east is mentioned as a partial correlate, no
comparisons are made with the similar age Cielo
Complex to the west.
The Historic Period briefly describes the Plains
Biographic style of rock art and Spanish accounts
of the region. Mention is made of the construction
of the southern transcontinental railroad in the early
1880s and the subsequent opening of the region to
Anglo-American settlement and the beginning of
the ranching industry. Historic Period archeology
describes the minimal investigations made to date
of both Native American and non-native sites and
objects. Turpin ends the chapter with a concise

272

summary that ties the dynamics of the region into a
coherent whole.
Part IV is entitled "The Hunters and Farmers
of the High Plains and Canyonlands" and contains
three chapters. Eileen Johnson and Vance T.
Holliday wrote Chapter Nine, "Archeology and Late
Quaternary Environments of the Southern High
Plains." The opening remarks of this chapter makes
it clear that the authors are focused on the
Paleoindian Period, and that data from a half-dozen
sites (most especially, Lubbock Lake), will dominate their discussions. They provide a concise description of the Southern High Plains setting before
embarking on a description of the "Cultural and
Environmental Chronology." They recognize five
general time periods for the region, including
Paleoindian, Archaic, Ceramic, Protohistoric, and
Historic. The section on the Paleoindian Period is a
comprehensive summary of a great quantity of data
amassed from the region, including the adjacent
eastern New Mexico portions. Descriptions of the
paleoenvironmental record are woven into the cultural discussions, beginning with Clovis. Primary
sites are used to illustrate both the environment and
the cultural adaptations through each of the succeeding subperiods, including Folsom and Late
Paleoindian. Explicit radiocarbon dates are interspersed liberally in the text. Illustrations of stratigraphic columns are supplemented by photos of
various types of projectile points showing variations through time. It is evident that a lot of thought
and care went into the preparation of this excellent
summary of an extensive subject.
The Archaic Period describes the regional
drying trend that was accompanied by localized
desiccation and aeolian deposition subsequent to
the more mesic environment enjoyed during
Paleoindian times. Precious little is know about the
Early Archaic of this region, and even less is known
about the Middle Archaic, a time that coincides
with the Altithermal when conditions were hot, dry,
and dusty to the point that massive aeolian
deposition occurred. The Late Archaic is somewhat
better known; climatic conditions eased during this
period, and greater amounts of surface water and
vegetation made the region more inhabitable. A
few bison kill sites are known in addition to more
traditional habitation sites during this period, and
the scanty data are supplemented with references to
the Lake Alan Henry investigations just off the
edge of the High Plains and downstream from
Lubbock Lake. The Ceramic Period is described as

beginning about 2000 B.P., and climatic conditions
are thought to have fluctuated between mesic
periods and episodic droughts (a pattern that
continues today). They divide the period into an
earlier part that is viewed as a transition from the
Late Archaic. Radiocarbon dates associated with
early style arrow points (such as Deadman's) show
an overlap with late style dart points and radiocarbon
dates excavated from bison kill sites. The later part
is seen as a mixed assemblage of Puebloan (or
Jornada Mogollon) tradeware and Plains lithic tool
types. While several sites are mentioned where data
on this subperiod are reported, no interpretations
are offered. The Protohistoric Period is predominantly associated with the Garza arrow point type,
and a series of sites with materials of this age are
mentioned. Most appear to be open camps, but at
least one bison kill site in New Mexico appears to
date to this period. A description of the Historic
Period includes the scant information on Native
American sites, and mentions the Plains Biographic
style rock art at Lake Alan Henry. Discussion of
European incursions and settlement includes the
pastores as well as ranchers, traders, buffalo
hunters, and the military. The few excavated
historic sites are briefly discussed. The chapter
ends with a Summary Discussion that succinctly
wraps it up. While the length of regional
occupation is stressed, it is still clear that more is
known about the very early and the late than is
known about what is in between.
Chapter Ten, entitled "The Palo Duro Complex: Redefining the Early Ceramic Period in the
Caprock Canyonlands" is written by Douglas K.
Boyd. Based on the work Boyd conducted at Lake
Alan Henry from 1987 to 1993, this chapter differs
from previous ones in that it looks at a specific
cultural unit in detail as opposed to summarizing a
region through time. The introductory comments
review the Woodland tradition on the Southern
Plains to the north and east, and the Formative
stage Jornada Mogollon to the west and southwest
as a way to establish six specific goals for the
chapter. These include defining an ecological subregion, summarizing culture history and paleoclimatic conditions, identifying surrounding cultural
units, identifying Palo Duro sites, reevaluating the
Palo Duro Complex in light of recent data, and,
finally, to speculate on interactions between Palo
Duro people and the people of the surrounding cultures. In my opinion, Boyd succeeds admirably in
achieving his goals.

Reviews 273
The first section describes the Caprock
Canyonlands in terms of the subregions' environmental diversity, paleoenvironments, and cultural
history. Essentially, the region is defined as a northsouth oriented irregularly shaped area that takes in
the eastern edge of the Llano Estacado (Caprock)
and the adjacent eroded canyonlands extending from
the south side of the Canadian River southward to
the upper Colorado River basin. This is described
as a resource rich zone that would have been critical in terms of subsistence and settlement, one that
could have been used as a home base from which to
exploit seasonal resources on the adjacent Southern
High Plains to the west, or the Rolling (or Lower)
Plains to the east. A map showing the boundaries of
the subregion in relation to the other major regional
physiography is accompanied by an illustration of
middle to late Holocene climatic conditions charted
against bison exploitation, cultural periods, and cultural complexes. The following section, called "Regional Cultural Complexes and Phases during the
Late Prehistoric I Period, "succinctly summarizes
the adjacent cultural complexes" accompanied by a
map (Figure 10.3) that illustrates their ranges. This
leads into a subsection that describes in detail known
archeological remains attributable to the Palo Duro
Complex (again, accompanied by a table listing the
sites with references, and keyed to a map). Table
10.2 summarizes extant radiocarbon assay results
that are attributed to the Palo Duro Complex. Residential basecamps are then described, including detailed data from the Kent Creek and Sam Wahl
sites that are illustrated with site plans, floor plans,
and photos of features such as a house and storage
pits. Changes in artifacts and features through time
within the Palo Duro Complex are used to suggest
that site function and subsistence activities may
have changed dramatically at these sites around
A.D. 1100. A different set of sites comprised of
twelve campsites and four rockshelters are described
in the next subsection. Interestingly, Boyd stresses
that what he calls campsites were (for the most
part) excavated before Jornada Mogollon style
pithouses were identified in this area, and that the
absence of such structural evidence may be attributed to sampling deficiencies or simply failure to
look for houses. This section concludes with a review of human burials that may be associated with
the Palo Duro Complex.
The next section is titled "Redefinition of the
Palo Duro Complex. This very detailed section,
accompanied by charts, tables, and artifact

illustrations, starts with chronology, then goes into
subsistence and site function. This is approached
through examination of the various classes of
artifacts (lithic, bone, ceramic), their relative
percentages, and even size comparisons among
classes such as grinding stones. The Jornada
Mogollon ceramics are shown to be of several types,
and petrographic data indicate a variety of nonlocal origins. In the "Features" subsection, variability in this category is illustrated in tabular format, as is architectural variability of the three
excavated houses. Faunal and floral remains are discussed at some length, and include tabular data
presentations. Five major interpretations of the
biotic data suggest that bison were not a significant
food source, that the primary food sources were
plants, that a wide range of plant foods were used,
that (despite the fact that direct evidence is lacking)
horticulture may have been practiced, and, finally,
that variations noted suggest differences in site
function. This is followed by a subsection on
"Seasonality, Residential Mobility, and Settlement
Patterns" that attempts to reconstruct these patterns
using the limited data at hand. A discussion of the
"Geographic Range and Intercultural Relationships"
is somewhat extensive, but succeeds in placing the
Palo Duro Complex in perspective to the defined
cultural units that surround it. A key recognition in
this discussion is the extent to which the Palo Duro
Complex appears to have been influenced by the
Jornado Mogollon. Interestingly, this subsection
concludes with an observation that it is possible
that the Palo Duro Complex, along with the probably
related Blow Out Mountain Phase, is the antecedent
of the widespread Toyah phase/horizon/tradition of
Central Texas This chapter ends with a short
"Summary and Conclusions" section that succinctly
captures the essence of the Palo Duro Complex.
Robert L. Brooks wrote Chapter Eleven, entitled "From Stone Slab Architecture to Abandonment: A Revisionist View of the Antelope Creek
Phase." Brooks explicitly sets out in an "attempt to
interpret the archeological record based on what we
currently know of the material record of Antelope
Creek." He opens with a general overview of this
farming-based phase that dates from about A.D.
1200 to A.D. 1500, listing many of the key sites,
and incorporating the notion of a physiographic
circumscription that played an important role in
establishing permeable boundaries for this cultural
expression limited to the Texas and Oklahoma panhandles. Importantly, the boundaries of Antelope

274

Texas Archeological Society

Creek contain the primary outcrops of a key regional lithic resource-Alibates agatized dolomite.
Previous investigations over the past one hundred
years are then described in detail, setting up a review of the cultural taxonomy that concludes with
a summary of Lintz' confusing 1986 varianUphase
definition. Adjacent cultural expressions are briefly
described. The next section reviews data regarding
the origins of the Antelope Creek phase, concluding that there are no clear antecedents for this unique
culture of Southwestern-influenced architecture
mixed with Plains Woodland derived material culture. A section on biological characteristics reviews
the physical anthropology of human remains associated with Antelope Creek phase sites. There appears to be an interesting variation in the diet between female and male members of the group. A
section on chronology reviews radiocarbon and
archeomagnetic assays, and ceramic tradeware dating. He suggests the assays indicate the phase actually ended at about A.D. 1450, consistent with significant changes in agricultural economies elsewhere in the American Southwest.
A section on "Settlement and Architecture" condenses a tremendous amount of information on
variations of the typical slab-lined semi-subterranean house architecture and storage features. Preferred settlement locations are also described. This
section ends with a discussion of the social structure implications derived from analysis of the architectural remains. "Subsistence" is the next topic,
and includes descriptions of a variety of cultigens,
wild plant foods, and an array of animals, including
bison, that played significant roles in this culture.
Comments regarding the specific type of agriculture employed are well chosen. The section of
"Technology" summarizes the stone, bone, and ceramic assemblages. Interestingly, Brooks specifies
that the bone tool assemblage is the most distinctive to Antelope Creek phase, and includes an array
of hoes, knives, digging sticks, hide grainers, awls,
needles, wedges, and such. "Trade and Warfare"
are examined in the next section. It appears that
trade was heavily oriented to the Puebloan cultures,
with little interaction with Caddoan people to the
east. Warfare is described as being oriented toward
defense of territory and competition for resources
rather than other reasons postulated by various folks
over the years. A discussion of mortality during
this phase follows, and details of variations in interment are reviewed. He concludes that there is
very little differentiation of status in the manner of

burial, but that where grave goods are present, they
are of overwhelming Southwestern origin. The final section on "Abandonment" describes the sudden disappearance of the Antelope Creek phase
people between A.D. 1450 and A.D. 1500. Various
reasons for this are explored, and basically is correlated with similar events across the Southwest. The
question of where these people went is left unresolved, but their material culture is too different
from that of the Jumanos, Querechos, Teyas, and
other groups to suggest a transformation into any of
those groups encountered by early European explorers in the region. This chapter concludes with a
brief summary that lists three suggestions for future
study of the Antelope Creek phase: refine data
recovery techniques, systematic examination of human biology, and renewal of academic interest in
the study of this culture.
Part IV is entitled "Hunter-Gatherer and
Farming Groups in the Post Oak Savanna, Tallgrass
Prairies, and Pineywoods of Eastern and Northern
Texas," and consists of two chapters. Chapter 12,
by Ross C. Fields, is titled "The Archeology of the
Post Oak Savanna of East-Central Texas." While
five large project areas (3 reservoirs and 2 lignite
mines) intensively investigated since about 1980
are noted as the primary sources of data for this
chapter, in reality, it is based heavily upon Fields'
work at two of those projects, Cooper Lake and
Jewett Mine. The introductory section describes
the north-south trending Post Oak Savanna,
including physiography, biota, and climate. He
narrowly defines the area of concern, and explicitly
excludes adjacent cultural or natural areas such as
the Caddoan heartland, the Blackland Prairies, and
the Eastern Cross Timbers; also excluded is
consideration of Historic Period Native American
occupations (Nortefio phase). A histogram of
uncalibrated radiocarbon assays illustrated in Figure
12.2 clearly shows that the vast majority of available
dates are less than 5000 years old. Thus the
chronology is divided into only three periods for
purposes of this chapter. The first is the "Pre-Late
Archaic Period" that first summarizes the skimpy
data for this period. Cooper Lake is described first,
and is largely based on limited investigations of the
Finley Fan site. A similar situation is described for
the Jewett Mine and adjacent Lake Limestone area
where only a couple of sites are comfortably dated
to this period despite the fact that a number of
artifacts (primarily projectile points, several of
which are illustrated) are know to be older than

Reviews 275
Late Archaic. Site functions in both areas are
suggested to be residential base camps.
Substantially greater amounts of data are available for the Late Archaic and Woodland periods.
A plethora of stone artifacts are listed for the Cooper Lake area during this period, many of which
are other than projectile points. Plant and animal
remains are not preserved in the Late Archaic so
interpretations are necessarily based upon the stone
tools and heated cobble features. However, at some
of the Woodland sites, sparse plant remains suggest squash, acorns, hickory and pecan nuts, plums,
and tubers were part of the diet, but definitive
evidence of horticulture remains elusive, as does
the identification of houses even though isolated
post molds are identified. Meager faunal remains
indicate a broad range of animals, from mussels
and turtles to deer and bison, were procured. These
materials are interpreted to indicate decreased
group mobility, but still do not suggest fully sedentary occupations. At Jewett Mine, there is a
similar range of stone tools, but the sandy soils do
not preserve bone and botanical remains are sparse,
being mostly limited to burned nutshells (hickory
and walnut). Sandy paste ceramics are present, as
are a few sherds of a locally made thin-walled
clay paste ceramics. These data are interpreted to
represent seasonal foraging.
The Late Prehistoric period is described in
greater detail due to greater numbers of sites, better
preservation of faunal and floral materials, and a
broader range of stone artifacts and ceramics. At
Cooper Lake, architectural features such as houses
and drying racks are indicated by post molds, while
pit features contain consolidated trash. Fields
describes a variety of bone, stone and shell tools,
and a great range of ceramics demonstrating various
vessel forms and decorative motifs Tropical
cultigens are present along with a long inventory of
native plants that were used as food. Similarly, a
range of animals were trapped and hunted for food
as well as bone and presumably hide resources. A
well-reasoned case is made for virtual abandonment
of the Cooper Lake area by about A.D. 1500. At
Jewett Mine, similar stone tools and heated cobble
features are reported, although the ceramics differ
somewhat during the early portion of the period.
During the later portion, sherds with apparent
Caddoan motifs appear. Limited data on faunal and
floral remains suggest that horticulture was not
adopted in this area. Changes in settlement strategies
from the early to late Late Prehistoric are suggested,

as is a shift from a forager system to more
logistically organized system.
The following section deals with data trends in
time and space. Various technological trends are examined, including different stone tool categories, ceramics, and cooking methods. Interestingly enough,
differing technological trajectories are identified and
illustrated between the northern and southern portions of the study area. Subsistence trends are harder
to follow simply because of the paucity of remains
p1ior to the Late Prehistoric. Greater detail is presented in the discussion of site functions, settlement
strategies, and use intensity, and differences are inferred again on a north-south basis. The following
discussion on "Sociocultural Interaction" uses scarce
exotic items, projectile points styles, and ceramics to
examine this difficult topic. Once again, very different patterns are described for the northern Cooper
Lake area compared to the southern Jewett Mine
area. The final section in this chapter is a summary
that very elegantly presents the conclusions drawn
from the review of this subregion.
Chapter Thirteen, written by Timothy K.
Perttula, is entitled "The Prehistoric and Caddoan
Archeology of the Northeastern Texas Pineywoods." As with three of the previous chapters, this
one is focused upon a single cultural group, albeit a
broad one, that occupied the Pineywoods of northeast Texas and beyond. A description of the natural
setting is illustrated with a physiographic map showing the area inhabited by the Caddo people, and
major subdivisions relevant to the text. This is followed by a review of majm: investigations in the
Texas segment of the Caddoan region. The next
section deals with the archeological record, and
begins with a summary treatment of the Paleoindian
and Archaic periods. Fortunately, Perttula does not
let state boundaries constrain him, and includes
relevant data from the adjacent states of Arkansas,
Louisiana, and Oklahoma where needed to provide
appropriate perspective on materials in Texas. Of
particular interest is the suggestion that the region
was somewhat drier between 8000 B.P and 4000
B.P, and saw a reduction in overall biomass concomitant with an expansion of the prairies. He goes
on to review the Late Archaic settlement patterns
that pretty much agree with the data reviewed earlier by Fields. A summary of the Woodland period
occupations examines the influence thought to have
derived from the Lower Mississippi Valley cultures. Whether ceramic styles were copied, or
whether exchange of goods was involved is a

276

Texas Archeological Society

subject not resolved. Comparisons and contrasts
with the Mossy Grove tradition to the south are
also made. Consideration is given to the proposition that horticulture was introduced during the
Woodland period, and settlement patterns are reviewed to contrast these with the continuation of
seasonally scheduled resource procurement in many
parts of the area. Burial mounds and exotic trade
goods found in discontinuous parts of the region
suggest that more complex social organization developed rapidly. A discussion of mortuary practices concludes this subsection.
An exhaustive review of the late Formative,
and Early and Middle Caddoan periods is amply
illustrated with charts of radiocarbon assays, cemeteries, house patterns, village structure, and various artifacts. Without repeating all the details here,
suffice it to say that Perttula does an admirable job
of condensing a tremendous amount of information
to describe the rich material culture of the Caddo
during these periods. This is followed by a section
that goes into greater depth about the character of
prehistoric Caddoan ceramics. Vessel form, paste,
temper, and decorative motifs are succinctly presented, again with ample illustrations and even a
chart illustrating a principal components analysis
of the chemistry of Caddoan ceramics. This relatively new approach shows relationships between
composition and specific stream drainages that allow greater examination of actual movement of
vessels as opposed to transfer of design information. This is even more important in light of recent
advances in detecting fine-scale changes in style
through time that can be refined to a few decades
duration. The Late Caddoan period is then reviewed,
and the spatial relationship of the various phases
during this period are clearly illustrated in Figure
13.26. Variations between permanent settlements
with mounds and cemeteries, dispersed hamlets,
and isolated farmsteads are compared among several of the phases, as are cemetery practices.
The Titus phase is selected for extended treatment in a discussion of its temporal position, its
boundaries, and its people. This phase is thought to
represent the remains of several Caddoan groups
who lived between the Sabine and Sulphur rivers
from around A.D. 1430 to A.D. 1680. Residential
areas, mounds and community centers, cemeteries,
ceramics, and tropical cultigens are all described in
detail, and are accompanied by precise maps and
illustrations that convey the essence of the text.
Included is a description of the significant quanti-

ties of non-local artifacts that attest to the wealth
and extent of trade during this time. A section titled
"The Demise of the Titus Phase" recounts recent
data that ties the disappearance of these Caddoan
people with Spanish entradas, specifically the De
Soto/Moscoso expedition of A.D. 1542-1543. A
short "Concluding Remarks" ends the chapter with
a statement regarding the unprecedented loss of
Caddoan cemeteries to commercial looters, and the
need for archeologists and surviving Caddo people
to work in concert to stem the losses and to preserve their rich heritage.
Now, I will turn my attention to specific comments on this volume. Although it is an edited
volume, the individual chapter authors were given
wide reign for their contributions. This leads to
annoying inconsistencies, especially in the presentation of dates. Some folks use B.P. dates, some use
B.C./A.D., some use both, some use the latest corrections and calibrations, and some use uncorrected
dates. Frankly, this gives me headaches trying to
correlate data between chapters, and in an edited
volume, I would expect that a standard would be
set so that there is at least minimal consistency in
chronometric values. The worst problem with this
volume, though, is the "References Cited." Whoever designed this critical part of the book failed
miserably because it is nearly impossible to find a
specific reference. Admittedly, it runs 60 pages long,
and if it were properly designed and formatted, it
probably would be 85 or.90 pages long. However,
the time wasted trying to verify citations far outweighs the nominal costs that would be added to do
the job right.
While they may be minor to some folks, small
slips become very annoying in quantity. For example, in Figure 1.5 on page 11, Bonfire Shelter is
omitted from the important Archaic sites despite
the fact that Bone Bed 3 is the only Late Archaic
bison jump in the region, yet in Figure 1.8 on page
13 the site is listed as an important Late Prehistoric
site when there are no Late Prehistoric remains
present there! Similarly, on page 39, Bonfire Shelter is described as being located on "Mile Creek;"
there is no such drainage! There is a Mile Canyon
through wh1ch Eagle NesfCreek flows, and Bonfire Shelter is located near the head of Mile Canyon. Additionally, on page 210 the Wind Canyon
site on Eagle Mountain is misidentified as the "Wind
Mountain" site. Never heard of it!
Some topics are practically ignored, such as
rock art. Only in the Chapter 8 dealing with the

Reviews 277
Lower Pecos River region is rock art treated as an
integral part of the archeological record. While admittedly it is poorly known, rock art is not mentioned as part of the record for the Central Texas
region in Chapter 3. There is a vast amount of rock
art in the Jornada Mogollon and Eastern TransPecos (Chapter 7), but it is mentioned only in passing. No mention at all is made in Chapter 9 of the
extensive Plains Biographic style rock art present
around the Southern High Plains. In Chapter 7
(which I consider a superior chapter), the survey
and data recovery work done in the upper potions
of Sanderson Canyon are omitted from the Eastern
Trans-Pecos discussion even though the earlier testing of rockshelters in nearby Roark Canyon were
included. In Chapter 9, there is great emphasis on
geomorphic interpretations relating to the Southern
High Plains, yet the apparent Altithermal age scouring of the canyons adjacent to the Caprock documented at Lake Alan Henry is not mentioned.
Some of the typological assignments are problematical. For example, the Thrall points described
in Chapter 2 are within the expectable variability of
the previously defined Victoria type, and even
though the chronological placement of the latter is
still in question, I do not think the hairsplitting
separation by Bousman, Baker and Kerr is justified. In Chapter 12 it is bothersome that Fields uses
the name Neches River for a dart point style I
originally named the Oletha variant of Neches River,
and subsequently elevated the variant to the status
of a type when it became apparent they were disparate in both age and distribution. Indeed it is very
unfortunate that a popular type guidebook also failed

to see that difference and is now using illustrations
of Oletha points and calling them Neches River.
There are strengths and weaknesses in all the
chapters, and even though I made copious notes
about both, it is time to move along without going
into too many nit-picking details. I think I have given
the reader a good sense of what is in this extremely
important compilation that provides up-to-date information on Texas archeology as of about A.D.
1998-2000. Not all of the state was covered, and
each author (or authors) wrote about what they knew
best-their own research. In some cases this came out
well, and in others it resulted in lapses that are bothersome since relevant data was apparently not consulted or was simply ignored. While it is important
that each author's perspective be presented, is it very
troublesome, for example, that Ricklis pretty much
wrote off the inland portion of Southeast Texas in an
otherwise well written Chapter 6 because he has
done no work there and can not bring himself to rely
upon other researchers for appropriate reference data.
This is also the case in Chapter 9 where Johnson and
Holliday seem to be oblivious to considerable research in the Southern High Plains that does not deal
with the Lubbock Lake site.
This is an essential reference book summarizing many of the varied aspects of Texas archeology, and it should be added to any serious research
library. It is not a handbook for the identification of
artifacts, yet it has ample illustrations of many artifacts. If you tn1ly want to learn about the rich cultural history of Texas during the 12,000 or so years
before Europeans arrived in the Americas, you need
to read this book.

Sea of Mud, The Retreat of the Mexican Army After San Jacinto, An Archaeological Investigation, by
Gregg J. Dimmick. The Texas Historical Association, Austin. 2004, xviii + 362 pp.

Reviewed by Anne A. Fox

This book will be enjoyed by both archeologists
and historians, particularly those who have
conducted excavations at military sites or who have
researched and written about Texas history. It would
be hard to say whether the archeology or the history
has been more extensively explored by the author.
While the history gets more emphasis, the author's
familiarity with the archeological investigations
carried out in the area of the Mexican Army's retreat
at San Jacinto fills in many details of that aspect of
the project.
A reader may at first question whether the archeology mentioned can be truly called "an archeological investigation." However, two reports published by the Houston Archaeological Society confirm that the recovery of the numerous military
artifacts was accomplished in a professional manner, despite the fact that it was done throughout
such a large area and by the use of metal detectors.
The area was meticulously mapped and the location of each artifact recovered was recorded with a
GPS reading. The artifacts were carefully cleaned
and photographically recorded. Jack Jackson's excellent maps help the reader to follow the movements of the army throughout the adventure. Clear
photographs of the artifacts recovered are included
throughout the book. These are all identified and
often described and analyzed in some detail, which
will be most helpful to those of us who can make
good use of the information.
The first five chapters deal primarily with the
immediate days after the defeat of General Santa
Anna at San Jacinto on April 21, 1836, and the
confusion and reorganization of the Mexican
troops who did not participate in that battle, under
the command of General Vicente Filisola. The
author worked extensively with Texas historians
who have specialized in this time period, obtaining
from them all sorts of references to create a picture
of the events as they took place. The inclusion of
pages of quotations from military reports,
correspondence, and officers' later memoirs paints

a detailed picture of events and also of the
personalities of the generals involved.
Chapters 6 through 10 deal with the actual march
of the Mexican anny in their attempt to find a way to
cross the Colorado River in order to regroup and
challenge the Texas Army. Here, again, the text relies on numerous quotations from correspondence
between the generals. As the army marched westward and crossed the San Bernard River, General
Filisola's account of the crossing paints a picture of
the horrible problems to come. The sky opened and
completely flooded the river valley just as the last
troops crossed, and the troops spent the night squatting "with the water reaching their backsides." The
total flooding of the valley caused the army to decide
to go north in order to find a safe crossing of the
Colorado River. Before long, the troops were up to
their waists in mud, and the artillery, and the other
heavy equipment, were bogged down. The descriptions of what the army went through in their desperate attempts to move mules, wagons and equipment
continue for 52 pages.
At this point the archeology enters into the
discussion, and reference is made to two archeological reports by the Houston Archaeological Society that actually describe the work done at various sites along the path of the retreat. Anyone
who is particularly interested in the archeological
aspect of the project really should obtain and read
these reports. [Hudgins and Dimmick. A Campsite
of the Retreating Mexican Army, April, 1836,

1998 and Hudgins, Kreler, and Dimmick. Tracking the Mexican Army through the Mar De Lodo
(Sea of Mud), April 29-May 9, 1836. Report No.
14, 2000].
Chapter 11 reports the arrival of 300 members
of the Texas Army who caught up with the rear of
the Mexican troops on May 1st. They were surprised
to find the enemy's camp deserted and littered with
equipment, guns, and lances that had been hastily
discarded a well as mules left mired in the mud.

Chapters 12 and 13 relate the final arrival of
the Mexican army at the Atascosito Crossing, its
total disorganization at that point, and General
Filisola' s decision to retreat to Mexico. Dimmick' s
Conclusion in Chapter 14 summarizes the difficulty of General Filisola in deciding first to retreat across the Colorado, and then later to retreat all the way home to Mexico. Appendices
include an officer's diary, a deposition of Col.
Jose de la Pena and tables showing the strength
and condition of the Mexican Army on May 9,

1836, and on May 14, 1836.
This interesting and useful book is recommended to anyone interested in Texas history, in
military artifacts of the 1836 time period, and in
what can be learned through meticulous archival
research and archeology accomplished with metal

We Came Naked and Barefoot the Journey of Cabeza de Vaca Across North America, by Alex D.
Krieger, edited by Margery H. Krieger. University of Texas Press, 2002. xvii+ 318 pages.

Alex Kreiger' s book, analyzing the route taken
by Alvar Nunez Cabeza de Vaca, Andres Dorantes
de Carranza, Alonso del Castillo Maldonado, and
Estevan, is a wonderful and remarkable book! The
book began in 1955 as Kreiger' s dissertation presented to the faculty at the Universidad Nacional de
Mexico. After retiring from teaching at the University of Washington in 1979, Kreiger returned to the
effort, translating Spanish documents relating to
the incredible journey that lasted 14 months and
covered (depending on how one interprets the route)
between 2,300 and 2,640 miles "naked and barefoot." While he never completed the book, his wife
did so posthumously at the urging of Dee Ann
Story. Tom Hester, editor of the Texas Archeology
and Ethnohistory Series at the University of Texas
Press, knew this was an important publication and
was pleased to include it in that Series. In his
Afterword (pages 149-153), Hester notes that this
is the authoritative route of the journey and most of
the other published routes are either slightly or
grossly inaccurate. Hester expresses the hope that
"Kreiger's volume will help peel away some of
the mystery of Cabeza de Vaca and formalize a
reasoned and rational view of his journey and interactions with native peoples" (page 149). I certainly hope he is correct because misinterpreted
routes showing the men meandering through the
Texas Panhandle continue to be found in the literature and create havoc with ethnohistoric interpretations (cf. Hickerson, N.P., The Jumanos Hunters and Traders of the South Plains, University of
Texas Press, 1994).
The volume begins with a Foreword by Tom
Hester, followed by a Preface by Margery Krieger
detailing her and her husband's efforts to publish
the account. Then Krieger offers an Introduction
that provides the context for the reader, including
a detailed analysis of previous interpretations of
the route of Cabeza de Vaca and his colleagues. It
is in this introduction that the reader begins to
recognize Krieger's intimate and vast knowledge

of the geography, flora, fauna, and geology of
Texas and northern Mexico along with a thorough
understanding of the region's archeological and
ethnohistorical records. He quietly and calmly
discusses other routes, noting what he agrees with
and authoritatively dismissing those that simply
fly in the face of fact. Hallenbeck, whose 1940 publication on the route takes the four men through
the Texas Panhandle, particularly troubled him:
"Hallenbeck had the advantage of the efforts of all
his predecessors to trace the route of the journey,
but he does not seem to have benefited from it"
(page 17). Krieger's analysis of these

interpretations, and Hester's comments on more
recent interpretations, are important. Each will help
us understand better the peoples who occupied the
land that Cabeza de Vaca traversed. For example, if
you assume that Hallenbeck and others are correct,
then the remarks about linguistic boundaries or about
enemies and friends will be attributed to groups in
the Panhandle not groups in northern Mexico.
Part II of the book is Krieger's analysis of the
journey and his interpretation of the route, beginnina

badly on the Texas Gulf Coast. His analysis is
based on the joint report given by the four survivors to the government shortly after their arrival in
Mexico. The report does not exist intact but rather
was paraphrased by the Spanish historian Gonzalo
Fernando de Oviedo y Valdez in his Historia general y natural de las Jndias (Royal Academy of
History, Madrid, 1851-1855 [original published in
1547]). In addition to this report, Krieger used
Cabeza de Vaca' s own account of the journey,
Relacion de los naufragios, written around 1537.
Krieger was clearly charmed by the latter: "The
document is not only a compelling story of a remarkable adventure but is also the first ethnography of native peoples of North America. It contains
unique information on customs and beliefs of many
Indian peoples over a vast area of the southern
United States and northern and western Mexico"
(page 5). Appendices I and II are translated versions of these .two accounts, and they give the reader
an opportunity to inspect and evaluate Krieger's
analysis and interpretation.
Krieger's route interpretations demonstrate that
his was no armchair analysis. Rather, he had been
there and he considered the route from the perspective of men who were traveling by foot. Thus, shortly
after the men crossed the Rio Grande, he discounts
other interpretations of the passage by Cabeza de
Vaca that the men began to see mountains (pages
58-59). Previous researchers of the route have stated
that the mountains mentioned were the Panorames.
Kreiger, considering the problem from the perspective of men on foot, states (page 59):
There are, in fact, two mountain ranges
almost exactly the right distance from
the Gulf of Mexico. The small Sierra de
Panorames in northern Tamaulipas was

regarded by Coopwood as the range
mentioned by Cabeza de Vaca. However,
the Panorames are a good 60 miles south
of the Rio Grande and are only 1,000 feet
in elevation. One must be within 15 miles
of them to see them at all. The second
range is the much higher and broader
Sierra de Cerralvos, also in Tamaulipas.
The Cerralvo range attains an elevation
of 4,800 feet and can be seen from thirty
or 40 miles away.
Readers will find similar thoughtful remarks
about the cultural implications of the statements in
the document. Thus, he (page 56) states that just
south of the Rio Grande "it is worth noting that the
travelers came to a settlement of more than one
hundred dwellings-which seems very large for
hunter-gatherers such as these and surely was the
largest the survivors had yet encountered. Hov.:ever, archeological surveys in the Falcon Reservoir
basin revealed evidence of settlements of this or
greater size, another point in favor of locating the
river crossing in this area."
Although I thoroughly enjoyed the read and
loved all parts of the book, I was disappointed in two
aspects of the publication. The first is that none ~f
the references cited in Hester's Foreword or his
Afterword were in the References Cited section of
the book. This is a significant editorial error by the
University of Texas Press. If they go to a second
edition or printing of the book, and I hope that they
do, they need to correct the oversight. The second is
that although there are four maps showing his route,
the maps do not show all groups encountered nor all
geographic features mentioned by Krieger in the text.
Thus, there are times that one has to resort to other
maps to follow Krieger's rationale for the route taken.
That said, I highly recommend the book to
others. It is very worthwhile. The careful analysis
and interpretation of the route and the discussion of
the people encountered by the four travelers is fascinating. You will learn much about the small scale
societies that occupied this vast region by reading
it. Mrs. Krieger modestly states at the end of her
Preface, "I hope that others will take pleasure in
this marvelous story of four remarkable men" (page
xvii). I certainly took pleasure in this marvelous
story and I know that many others will too.

Most state archeological societies conduct summer field schools and/or training sessions that allow their members to participate in the various tasks
associated with archeological research. These
schools are conducted with the best of archeological intentions. More often than not, however, the
data collected during such field schools sit dormant
for years and years, generally forgotten and neglected while the original project directors move on
to other areas of interest or to unrelated work required by their full-time jobs. This is unfortunate,
as the field-school data usually were collected in a
highly detailed manner by extremely careful individuals. To resurrect such long-forgotten excavations, to analyze and interpret their data, and to
make that information available to the archeological community is an extremely difficult, yet highly
important, exercise.
Lawrence Aten and Charles Bollich are to be
commended for doing exactly that, plus much,
much more. Their report on the Gaulding site
(41JF27), published jointly by the Texas Archeological Research Laboratory (Studies in Archeology No. 40) and the Texas Archeological Society
(Special Publication No. 4), examines and analyzes data collected during the fourth summer field
school of the Texas Archeological Society (TAS).
This field school occurred between June 12 and
19, 1965, and was attended by approximately 60
individuals under the supervision of Dessamae
Lorrain, Burney McClurkan, and Doris Olds. One
of the current authors (Bollich) participated as a
T AS member. It marked the first time in over 30
years that a "shell-bearing" site had been excavated on the upper Texas coast.
In addition to the data acquired during the T AS
field school, Aten and Bollich incorporate information obtained nine years later by small-scale excavations directed by Bollich for the Beaumont Art

Museum (now the Art Museum of Southeast Texas)
as a means to illustrate to young people the importance of such sites. Later, in 1995 and 1996, the
authors revisited the locale to acquire soil borings
and column samples for fine screening and additional radiocarbon dating. To this day, Gaulding
remains one of only a handful of sites in the Sabine
Lake area that has ever received proper archeological attention. For that reason, the site's story is an
extremely important one.
The Gaulding site itself is a moderate-size shell
midden, or "shell-bearing" site as the authors prefer to call it, located along the northern edge of
Taylor Bayou about 20 km west of Sabine Lake. It
consists mainly of the brackish-water clam Rangia
cuneata, although some oysters ( Crassostrea
virginica) also are present. At the time of the field
school, the site measured approximately 100 m long
by a maximum of 30 m wide and reached a height
of about 1 m above the water in Taylor Bayou. This
bayou is one of the main water courses within the
so-called Taylor Bayou drainage basin. As such, it
is part of a network of channels that drain most of
the Pleistocene-age Beaumont formation in the area
south of the city of Beaumont. The bayou eventually passes through several kilometers of fringing
Holocene marsh and then empties into the southwestern corner of Sabine Lake. Thus, aboriginal
inhabitants residing at Gaulding had access to woodlands and prairies of the adjacent Beaumont formation, nearby coastal marshes, the waters of Sabine
Lake, and, slightly farther away, beaches along the
Gulf coast.
Aten and Bollich begin their examination of
the Gaulding site by briefly discussing previous
archeological research within the Sabine Lake
region, particularly that area within the Taylor
Bayou drainage basin. Since both the 1965 field
school and the 1974 Art Museum excavations were

designed to teach archeology, neither was guided
by a specific series of research questions. Thus,
Aten and Bollich next provide a modern set of
research topics around which they direct most of
their subsequent analyses and interpretations: (1)
chronology, (2) site types and regional settlement
pattern, (3) geoarcheology and site formation, (4)
paleoecology, (5) subsistence and seasonal
movements, (6) territoriality, (7) technology, and
(8) mortuary practices. These topics then are
followed by descriptions of the 1965, 1974, and
1995-96 field investigations.
One of the more interesting chapters is devoted
to a study of site formation. It is in this part of the
report that one learns the nature of the site's stratigraphy (defined by a sequence of 10 "layers"), probable cultural components, and the ages of these
components. The latter were defined on the basis of
seven radiocarbon dates and diagnostic ceramic artifacts, and were grouped into stratigraphic analysis
units (AUs) that represent "three distinctive and
well-dated periods of archeological accumulation"
(p. 23). The deepest and earliest of these AUs,
identified as the Lower AU, fell within the early
Late Archaic period and dated roughly to between
4000 and 3700 cal years B.P. It was marked by
varying strata (Layers 2 through 5) that included,
from bottom to top, whole Rangia shells within a
dense clay matrix, whole Rangia shells with very
little soil matrix, and both whole and fragmented
Rangia shells with. little associated matrix. The second, or Middle, AU dated to the middle Late Archaic period between ca. 3000 and 2700 cal years
B.P. It included Layers 6 through 9 and these were
represented by whole and fragmented Rangia shells
in a moderate clay matrix, whole shells in a layer
with little matrix, and fragmented Rangia shells
also with little matrix. The Upper AU (represented
by Layer 10) dated from sometime during the first
millennium B.C. to ca. A.D. 1300. Unlike the previous AUs, it included sparsely scattered Rangia
shells in a relatively thick layer of rich organic
humus. The authors argue that these layers represent a common sequence of aggradation at shellbearing sites along the upper Texas coast: lower
and upper deposits of shell that contain a significant amount of soil matrix and an intervening deposit of shell with little to no soil matrix.
To examine the validity of this sequence further,
the authors subjected a series of soil samples retrieved during the 1995-96 fieldwork from Layers 2
through 10 to detailed grain-size and compositional

analyses. They also obtained undisturbed core
samples from each layer and these were impregnated with epoxy glue for use both as a permanent
record of site stratigraphy and as hardened deposits
that could be thin sectioned and examined microscopically. Generally, these studies supported the
three-part sequence of site formation. Importantly,
they also yielded information for each layer on the
burned/unburned ratio of Rangia shells, the ratio of
tight to left Rangia valves, the sizes of Rangia
shells (which can be related directly to the ages of
the clams harvested), the presence or absence of
iron concretions, the types and quantities of terrestrial snails, and the quantity of oysters. The latter
was found to be most important, as it was reasoned
that oysters only could have resulted either from an
influx of marine water into the middle reaches of
the Taylor Bayou basin or by travel downstream by
the site's inhabitants to collect the shellfish in Sabine
Lake, a distance of ca. 25 km.
After examining all of the evidence, Aten and
Bollich provide a summary of the site formational
processes that created the Gaulding shell deposits.
They concluded that the initial shell layer (Layer 2)
was an accumulation of shells redeposited atop the
upper part of the Beaumont formation (Layer 1).
These shells apparently had been displacement from
a nearby habitation area. Due to its secondary nature, this deposit had a high degree of soil matrix
relative to the amount of Rangia shells present. It
also lacked much evidence of vertebrate faunal remains and artifacts. The next sequence of deposits
(Layers 3 through 9) resulted from activities that
took place directly atop the site. Included were
cooking, clam opening, and clam discard. A few
associated artifacts and vertebrate faunal remains
were present, as well. In contrast, little to no matrix
was present. The final deposit (Layer 10) consisted
almost entirely of natural sediment with very little
shell. It did, however, contain most of the recovered artifacts (in this instance, aboriginal ceramics)
plus fairly well-preserved vertebrate faunal remains,
particularly very tiny bones from numerous small
animals. Also associated was a single burial pit that
descended downward from Layer 10.
A substantial chapter devoted to the technology of the site's inhabitants provides a wealth of
information on the various artifacts retrieved from
Gaulding. Since aboriginal ceramics from the Upper AU of Layer 10 comprise the bulk of the artifacts collected, most of the chapter is devoted to
their analysis. This showed that ceramic-producing

284

Texas Archeological Society

peoples restricted their activities to the northeastern
end of the site (as determined by the distribution of
sherds at the locale) and that at least two separate
occupations once occurred during the accumulation
of Layer 10: ( 1) an early ceramic occupation dating
from ca. 2200 to 1900 B.P., or roughly equivalent
in time to the late Tchula period in the lower Mississippi River valley (LMV) and the Clear Lake
period in the Galveston Bay (GB) area; and (2) a
later occupation dating from only 600 to 800 B.P.,
and equal to the early Mississippi period (LMV)
and the late Round Lake period (GB).
Aten and Bollich sort the Gaulding ceramics
into the type-variety system of ceramic classification, a system originally employed on the upper
Texas coast in Aten's (1983) masterful synthesis of
the region. One minor change is evident between
the two publications: the old type Mandeville Plain
has been subsumed under Tchefuncte Plain, thereby
making it a variety of Tchefuncte Plain (i.e.,
Tchefuncte Plain, var. Mandeville). This is something long advocated by the present reviewer (see
Weinstein and Rivet 1978). Other typological
changes suggested elsewhere (Weinstein et al. 1988;
Weinstein 1991) have not been followed, but reasons for such are clearly provided and the authors
note that such modifications might be worth pursuing in the future. Regardless, Aten and Bollich conducted a grain-size analysis of several of the types
and varieties found at Gaulding and compared the
results to similar studies of local sediments from
different environments (as reported in several soils
surveys and geological studies of the region). Of
paiticular interest is the discovery that O'Neal Plain,
var. Conway seems to have been tempered with
sand collected from local riverine point-bar deposits, while vessels of Tchefuncte Plain, Baytown
Plain, var. Phoenix Lake, and San Jacinto Incised,
var. Spindletop were fashioned from clays commonly found in a marsh setting.
The discussion of lithic remains is somewhat
less detailed than that of the ceramics, but still
provides useful archeological data. Two unidentified dart points (one similar to the Kent type) came
from the Lower AU, while two Gary dart points,
another unidentified dart similar Â·to a Kent, one
Perdiz aiTOw point, and one unidentified arrow point
came from the Upper AU. Perhaps most interesting
was a metate fragment from the Upper AU. It apparently had been fashioned and used as a metate
elsewhere, broken, and then one of the broken fragments brought to Gaulding where it possibly served

as a weight or leather-working tool. Rounding out
the list of noteworthy artifacts are two socketed
bone points, a deer ulna awl, perforated Rangia
valves, and a possible unfinished conch columella
bead. These are items commonly found on shellbearing sites along the upper Texas coast.
Another section of the report examines subsistence data from the site (mainly as it relates to the
shellfish and vertebrate faunal remains recovered),
the lone burial unearthed in the Upper AU, seasonality, and regional settlement patterns. Of special
interest to this reviewer was the possibility raised
by the authors that not all of the shellfish remains
represented individuals consumed by the people
who collected them. Rather, some of the Rangia
clams could have been used as bait to help catch
garfish, alligators, or other carnivorous fish and
aquatic reptiles (i.e., snapping turtles). This brings
to mind a symposium at the 1987 Southeastern
Archaeological Conference in which arguments
were offered both for and against the prehistoric
use of Rangia meat as chum to attract shrimp for
subsequent capture in nets or weirs. Although several people presented papers during the symposium,
this reviewer is aware of only one that eventually
was published (Brown 1988).
Since Rangia were present throughout the stratigraphic sequence at Gaulding, but in differing quantities per layer, Aten and Bollich also looked at the
"long-term presence of the Rangia cuneata clam in
the Taylor Bayou drainage basin" (p. 65). By comparing logs from engineering borings from locations within the basin (obtained originally by the
Galveston District of the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers) with radiocarbon dates from Gaulding and
other archeological sites and geological deposits in
the area, the authors were able to determine that the
period of maximum Rangia occurrence coincided
with the Lower and Middle AUs at Gaulding, ca.
4000 to 2000 B.P. Subsequent to that time, clams
became scarce within the basin. Oysters also were
most pronounced in the Lower AU. The authors
argue that these periods of heightened shellfish accumulation may have occurred as Rangia larvae
were swept upstream from the marshes along the
lower reaches of the bayou, probably due to storm
surge, and then settled to form local non-reproducing populations that would survive for no more
than 10 years. Another surge episode then would be
required before Rangia could establish a new population in the waters near the site. Given the quantities of shellfish at Gaulding, such episodes must

Reviews 285
have been fairly frequent during the early to middle
Late Archaic period.
Almost 2,600 identifiable vertebrate bones were
recovered at Gaulding. Unfortunately, the vast majority of these remains (n= 1, 706) came from the
Upper AU of Layer 10. Only 84 specimens came
from the Middle AU of Layers 6 through 9, while
43 bones were retrieved in the Lower AU of Layers
2 through 5. Aten and Bollich argue that this discrepancy is not due to unequal preservation, as
typical shell-bearing sites provide an environment
conducive to bone preservation and the Gaulding
bones from the Middle and Lower AUs were in
good condition. Rather, they suggest that the dichotomy in the amount of bones between the Upper
AU and the Middle and Lower AUs reflects real
differences in faunal exploitation and/or availability through time. Overall, the authors see a major
shift in subsistence patterns from the early Late
Archaic period, during which terrestiial and avian
vertebrates were utilized, to the Late Prehistoric,
ceramic-producing people, who mainly relied on
aquatic and terrestrial vertebrates.
Discussion of the lone burial uncovered at
Gaulding is interesting, not so much for the information on the individual interred at the locale (an
adult female, ca. 30 to 40 years of age, without
accompanying grave goods), but for the summary
of other aboriginal burials found at sites in the
Sabine Lake area. This information is particularly
important as it brings to light unpublished data on
about 27 individuals, their burial orientation, and
their associated grave goods.
Perhaps the most interesting chapter, at least in
the eyes of this reviewer, is entitled "Paleoenvironment." Within it, the authors synthesize data on the
region's paleoclimate and paleogeography. Interpretations related to the former are drawn heavily
from analyses by Kenneth M. Brown and Richard
W. Fullington of the terrestrial snails found at the
site in 1965 and 1995-96, respectively, and included
in two appendices to the report. Basically, they
show that the lower portion of the Lower AU (early
Late Archaic period) may have occurred during a
waning dry period (the last of the Altithermal?)
with dry summers and cold winters. this was followed by the onset of a warmer, wetter period associated with the upper part of the Lower AU. Such
conditions then lasted through the Middle AU (with
minor fluctuations), eventually reaching modern climatic conditions by the upper portion of the Upper
AU (Late Prehistoric period).

Discussions on the region's paleogeography are
mainly related to a model of sea-level fluctuation
proposed by several Florida geologists, principally
William F. Tanner (1991, 1992, 1993; Tanner et al.
1989) and Frank W. Stapor and his colleagues (Stapor
and Tanner 1977; Stapor et al. 1991). These individuals produced a sea-level curve for southwest
Florida that has been modified slightly by archeologists working in that area (Walker et al. 1994,
1995). When Aten and Bollich compared the periods
of site occupation at Gaulding to the modified curve,
they found that all major occupations occurred during
times of higher sea level. For instance, the occupation
related to the Lower AU could be tied to a period of
elevated sea level identified as "Tanner A." That of
the Middle AU could be matched with another rise
labeled "Tanner C." And the final occupation of
the Upper AU equated with the Lacosta rise of
southwest Florida.
Importantly, Aten and Bollich argue that it was
during these periods of higher-than-normal sea level
that storm surges would have been more likely to
have swept Rangia larvae into the lower and middle
reaches of the Taylor Bayou basin, thus allowing
for Rangia beds to develop in the site vicinity, as
discussed above. During those intervening periods,
when sea level was lower than normal, Rangia
would not have been swept into the site area, no
shellfish beds would have formed, and the middle
to lower parts of the basin (including the Gaulding
location) would not have been at.tractive to aboriginal settlement. Not coincidentally, these intervening periods correspond quite well with those hiatuses in occupation noted at Gaulding. The authors
suggest further that this model should be testable in
other areas of the Texas coast-a line of investigation that several archeologists working in Texas
have started to address (i.e., Prewitt and Paine 1988;
Ricklis and Cox 1991; Ricklis 1993, 1995; Ricklis
and Blum 1997; Ricklis and Albert 1998; Weinstein
2002; Ricklis and Weinstein 2005).
Overall, Aten and Bollich have admirably fulfilled the wishes of any archeologist wishing to
learn from long-dormant data acquired at a site
excavated by a society field school years and years
ago. The report is replete with detailed analyses,
modern research topics and interpretations, and an
excellent set of appendices to help suppo1t the entire story. The Gaulding site report is a must read
for anyone working on shell-bearing sites, not only
along the Texas coast but elsewhere across the Gulf
of Mexico.

Archeology & History at Fort Anahuac: Results of the 2003 Season Excavations in Chambers County,
Texas, by Rachael Feit and John W. Clark with contributions by Jonathan Jarvis and Mason Miller.

Built by the Mexican government at the urging
of General Manuel de Mier y Teran, Fort Anahuac
was one of a series of forts proposed to regain
control of the Texas frontier that was being ovenun
by legal and illegal Anglo settlement. A key site in
the events of the early 1830s that eventually led to
the Texas Revolution, the fort and its first commander, Juan Davis Bradburn, became a lightning
rod for complaints by the Anglo colonists against
the Mexican government. The arrival of Bradburn
and his small garrison was not taken as good news
by the colonists who had previously been exempt
from taxation and until then had seen almost no
interference from the Mexican government. Angered by his protection of escaped slaves from Louisiana, William Travis feuded with Bradburn and
threatened to attack the fort. Bradburn eventually
resigned under pressure and the fort was abandoned
in 1832. By 1835, the new Mexican government
under Santa Anna had refurbished and re-occupied
the fort only to be once again dislodged by a small
band of Texicans under Travis.
Despite its critical role in fomenting the 1836
revolution, Fort Anahuac has remained largely unknown outside of Chambers County. Picked over
for salvageable materials by local residents, the old
fort fell into disrepair and was eventually bulldozed
by the county to create the park that now contains
the ruins. In the report of the second phase of Hicks
& Company archeological and historical studies
sponsored by Chambers County with funds from
the Texas Preservation Trust Fund, Feit and Clark
present the results of their investigations and a summary of previous work. Following a magnetometer
survey by the Texas Historical Commission in 2001
and preliminary test investigations by Hicks & Company in 2002, the Hicks & Company team proceeded to strip 1940s fill from the top of the fort
area with a Gradall and excavate a series of units
around historic features during the 2003 investigations. Unlike the earlier season in which Hicks &
Company investigators found few artifacts, the 2003

season revealed not only five new historic features,
in addition to the four that had been discovered in
the previous season, but a number of period artifacts associated with several of the features and
with the remnants of occupation surfaces of the era.
The report includes a detailed description of the
features and the recovered artifacts, with a well
written account of the historical events that brought
the fort into the political forefront in 1830s Texas.
Their conclusions and a tentative reconstruction are
presented in the final chapters of the report.
As described in the methodology section, the
research design for the 2003 season primarily featured questions about the extent, alignment, function, and construction technology within areas or
features defined in previous investigations. In most
of these areas, the Gradall was used to strip relatively deep layers of recent fill so that the units
could focus directly on the features of interest. Previous excavations had established that these overlying deposits .contained no intact remains. Deposits from the excavation units were screened except
in those cases where it was determined that the fills
were culturally sterile. In the end, all but two of the
proposed research questions were addressed; the
two that were not, including trenching under the
park road and along the bluff area, were dropped
for practical considerations.
Overall, the report is a well written and valuable contribution not only to our knowledge of the
fort but to the Mexican period in Texas. The descriptions of the excavations and the features are
clear and the interpretations are credible. While the
results to date still do not give us a complete picture of the fort and its ancillary structures, the layout of known walls, buildings, and other features
provides an excellent window onto the design of
the fort and its construction technology. The projected layout corrects several misconceptions held
by previous researchers whose investigations had
attempted to characterize the fort based on very
limited information.

Feit and Clark's investigations clearly show the
double wall configuration that probably surrounded
the entire fort. The discovery of internal dividing
walls suggests that the area between the double walls
was carved up into rooms whose roofs provided a
walkway along the top of the wall behind the parapet, a common design in presidios and frontier forts.
Curiously, the exterior defensive wall is not perfectly parallel to the interior one. Although possibly
an indicator that the two walls were not contemporaneous, it is more likely a sign of the limited resources for the initial construction. Nonetheless, the
main walls have substantial foundations that are integrated into an overall defensive configuration that
included bastions on at least two of the wall comers.
The discovery of two associated brick-walled
outbuildings also provides information on the organization of the outpost. Feit and Clark suggest that
neither was a defensive structure based on the relatively slender walls. No function could be identified for the smaller of the two, but they suggest an
administrative function, perhaps as part of the customs house operation, for the larger.
Among the most interesting remains were a series of subterranean canals or drains that underlie
several of the walls and buildings. While all Spanish
forts may not have had such features, they are not
uncommon in eighteenth- and nineteenth-century fortified sites, and must have been vital to drain this
extremely wet area along the banks of upper
Galveston Bay. Feit and Clark's suggestion that the
drains were added after the initial construction appears reasonable, especially with respect to the manner in which they cut through the main fort walls,
although the fact that these features ran at an angle to
interior buildings might seem to suggest that the
buildings were added after the drains. In any case,
even if the drains were built after the initial construction, their presence confirms that the fort was rather
more than a hastily thrown up construction.
Local researchers have reported that a tunnel
was present at the fort, possibly an emergency escape route. Tunnels have been reported at a wide
range of fortified sites and, in fact, at a host of
historic and prehistoric sites of all types throughout
the Americas. While the remains of such tunnels
have actually been identified at a small handful of
sites, their presence has been difficult to identify at
many more. These tunnels have eluded magnetometers, ground-penetrating radar, backhoe trenching,
and hand excavation units, and may in many cases
have been little more than folk tales. Although the

possibility of a tunnel cannot be ruled out at Fort
Anahuac, Bradburn seems to have had little enough
time and money to build the fort, much less a tunnel,
and there seems to be little indication that his initial
expectations were that he would face the determined
resistance that he ultimately did. Thus, it may not be
so surprising that the Hicks & Company team did
not encounter a tunnel, although it is not impossible
that the subterranean drains may well have been
mistaken for tunnels at some point in the past.
The Hicks & Company report presents the basic data on the excavations and the recovered remains in a well organized and eminently readable
fashion. The master list of strata is a particularly
welcome addition to the interpretation. The report
is well illustrated with photos and drawings of excavation units, features, and artifacts. A few of the
field photos should probably have been shaded
while some of the stylized drawings are a bit too
busy and somewhat difficult to interpret. Likewise,
the choices of scale for some of the artifact photos
seem odd. Although it makes sense to present artifacts grouped by material type, it might have been
more useful to enlarge the metal button and gunflint,
for example, rather than the somewhat ordinary
sherds. All in all, however, the copious illustrations
are an essential part of the description of this site.
In general, Feit and Clark's report is a fine addition to the corpus of literature on early Texas historical archeology as well as an important resource for
those who are interested in the evolution of fortifications in the New World. The minor quibbles with
graphics and the occasional editorial and spelling errors take nothing away from the valuable contributions of this work. The study serves more than adequately to update the progress of investigations that
will hopefully be augmented by further seasons of
work. With respect to this, one of their most important
conclusions is that more is left to be studied, and
given the seminal importance of this fort in the history
of Texas, one hopes that such future seasons will be
possible. Although it is a shame that the fort was
allowed to fall into disrepair and was ultimately damaged by the political entity that should have been
protecting it, the current efforts of Chambers County
to determine what is left and ultimately protect or
even perhaps partially reconstruct portions of the fort
should be commended and supported. And the determined efforts of the investigators, working with what
many had probably regarded as an almost completely
destroyed site, have brought light and perhaps new
recognition to a critical era in the history of Texas.

Reviewed by Rachel Feit

Archeologists engaged in cultural resource
management know too well the frustration of trying
to understand a single site in isolation. Too often
the sites we examine through compliance archeology are just pieces of a story. They are portions of
sites, fragments of communities, or incomplete parts
of cultural systems that happen to fall within proposed rights of way or on the edge of property
boundaries. As fragments, these sites have little
research value. Rarely, do CRM archeologists have
an opportunity to examine sites holistically, as part
of a larger network. Under Four Flags: History
and Archeology of North Loop One by John W.
Clark is a report that does just that. In it Clark
synthesizes the results of archeological investigations for seven nineteenth and early twentieth century sites, and the historical research on many more
within the Waters Park and Duval communities of
northern Travis County.
Working for TxDOT in the 1980s, archeologists
undertook this project as part of the compliance
effort for the construction of North Loop One (aka
North Mopac) in Travis County, Texas. With the
construction of North Loop One, TxDOT archeologists were lucky enough to have an entire
community-stretching from US 183 to Parmer
Lane-to investigate archeologically. When the
project began in the early 1980s, John Clark
insightfully perceived that the archeological remains
of homes, businesses, roads, and dams within the
path of the then un-built North Mopac were part of
a system that developed and functioned organically
during the nineteenth and twentieth centuries. The
research value of each site was not necessarily
intrinsic but measurable only through a wide-angled
lens that could account for the entire complex.
Applying a theoretical template not unlike the
political ecology model proposed by Thomas
Sheridan, Clark examines the sites within the path
of North Loop One not only as cultural-ecological
systems but also as political-economic units. The
people and personalities associated with them were

part of a community that labored together, traded,
intermarried, and socialized with one another. The
specific developmental trajectory of this community
was influenced not only by these social relationships
but also by a unique set of ecological and
environmental factors. At the time TxDOT began
this study, these ideas had not yet been articulated
in one theoretical framework, and consequently
Clark's approach was (and still is) quite visionary.
In the opening chapters of the report, Clark
introduces the project and its context. The natural
environment, he argues, was critical to the pattern
of initial development within the North Loop One
area, which straddles the edge of the Balcones Escarpment. Early settlement and agriculture developed on the Big Prairie side of the escarpment,
while use of the upthrust side of the escarpment

focused on exploitation of cedar and grasslands for
grazing. Roads evolved mainly on the edge of this
geologic dividing line and fonned the main communication arteries linking the early households in the area.
Maps of site distributions in the report clearly demonstrate the linear placement of these historic sites along
the Upper Georgetown and Stringtown Roads.
Once rail transportation was introduced to central Texas, however, rail stops became a major economic catalyst. A rail stop located on the Upper Georgetown Road near Walnut Creek created a small economic boom for one landowner, Silas Summers, who
sold the land that eventually developed into the Waters Park Community in the 1880s. Located along a
large meander of Walnut Creek, at the edge of the
Balcones Escarpment, Waters Park became an attractive weekend picnic destination once the Austin
Northwest Railroad built a stop there. Amenities that
were built to accommodate weekend tourism included
a gazebo, a baseball diamond, a dam over the creek,
and Andrew Peyton's Tavern.
Clark traces the history of this area and its development through detailed use of archives, local genealogies, land use histories, maps, aerial photos and oral
interviews. The project was an enormous undertaking. The report examines and reports on over 20
historic archeological sites, as well as several prehistoric sites. Seven historic sites were specifically targeted for archeological investigation for this project.
These include the Wallace Site (41TV291), first occupied by the Rogers family prior to 1880, a railroad
section house (41TV632), the Summers/Colvin
House (41TV633), the Andrew Peyton Tavern
(41TV634), the Water Park Dump (41TV635), and
the Upper Georgetown Road (41TV637). The total
effort required hundreds of test units, and analysis of
over 100,000 artifacts. Clark's "Results of Investigations" section provides concise summaries of the
work conducted at each site and the artifacts that
were found. The report will undoubtedly become an
invaluable reference tool for anyone conducting historical archeological investigations of nineteenth and
early twentieth century communities in Texas (be
sure to request Appendices 14-23 on CD-ROM containing artifact inventories).
With the report's comprehensive site data and
relatively robust philosophical underpinnings, the

final synthesis of the project, then, is somewhat
unsatisfying. Published almost six years after Clark
had actually retired from TxDOT, Clark himself
admits that his original manuscript was heavily edited after his retirement. Whether some of those
deletions occmred in the synthesis or not, I believe
that the final "Summary" chapter could have been
much more developed.
In terms of artifact analysis, Clark modeled his
own analytical categories on South's in order to
compare basic functional categories between similar historical sites in the southeast. But South's
categories themselves are extremely general and
useful for only basic comparisons. Moreover, most
of South's work was conducted on Colonial and
Plantation sites of the east coast, which are hardly
comparable to late nineteenth century frontier settlement sites in central Texas.
Much more could have been made of land use
patterns and artifact comparisons between sites actually investigated for this project. For instance, the
summary section of the report describes the breakdown of animal bones found at each of the sites
investigated. Virtually all of the sites investigated
for this project exhibited the same general consumption patterns, with beef and rabbit predominating, followed by pig then chickens, sheep, and
goats. However at one site, the Summers/Colvin
site, chicken was clearly the most common animal
remain. Nothing is made of this significant discrepancy, which could be a major indicator of socioeconomic status or cultural preferences, and Clark
states in the conclusion that class and cultural differentiation among sites was not possible from artifact content.
But this seems to be an endemic problem in
most CRM reports (including, no doubt, my own)
on Texas archeology. That is, we offer much data,
but much too little synthesis and interpretation.
What does artifact, feature and land use patterning
actually tell us about how people lived, and how
does it compare with other sites of similar and
divergent contexts. If we are to make our reports
meaningful, as no doubt we desire, we must take
that critical leap from assembling data to writing
history. Under Four Flags heads down that path,
but stops short of the end point.

Donny Hamilton's book on the archeology of
the Rustler Hills-a chain of hills running northsouth through eastern Culberson County-concentrates on findings from Granado Cave (41CU8).
Previous archeological excavations within the study
area were primarily conducted during the 1930s
(Sayles 1935, 1941; Jackson 1934a, 1934b, 1937),
concentrating on deposits in some of the larger
caves. While a few more recent efforts have supplemented those investigations (Tanner 1949; Skinner
1978; Ward 1992), the area has remained poorly
known archeologically. Accordingly, Hamilton's
publication on his findings from Granado Cave from
testing conducted in 1976 and an 11 day investigation in 1978 is a welcome addition to the archeological record of the region.
Hamilton begins with a well-written and informative environmental background chapter in which
he presents the Rustler Hills as a desolate area on
the margins of more habitable and hospitable regions. Recent and historic analyses of spring and
well water in the area are presented (pgs. 8-11) to
emphasize the poor quality of this critical resource.
Using this data, Hamilton suggests water during
prehistory was similarly unpalatable and, as such, a
marginal resource. He draws on several lines of
evidence, most importantly the widespread occurrence of gypsum. While he makes a fairly convincing case, the reader should be cautioned that water
quality may have been affected in historic times by
groundwater depletion and water in prehistoric times
may or may not mirror historic quality.
The archeological background chapter (Chapter 3) clears up some confusion in the literature
over past research in the Rustler Hills. Hamilton
succinctly presents past efforts at sinkhole/cave sites
in the area (Caldwell Shelter No. 1, Caldwell Shelter No. 2, McAlpin Cave No. 1, McAlpin Cave No.
2, Shelby Brooks Cave, and ELCOR Cave) while
indicating that little work has been done on open
sites in the vicinity. In fact, Table 3 .1 indicates
there are only two such sites (41CU3 and 41CU260)

recorded in the Rustler Hills. The lack of recently
investigated open sites in the area is a problem
when considering some of the conclusions in the
final chapter.
Chapter 4 contains a description of Granado
Cave, an introductory section providing information on how eight of 10 burials were discovered,
methodological approaches from testing and final
excavation, and findings from the investigations.
This chapter is presented in an orderly and comprehensible manner, and is well illustrated with photographs and drafted figures.
Ten human burials from Granado Cave are presented in Chapter 5, eight of which were uncovered
by Mr. Frank Granado, the person who discovered
the cave. Mr. Granado is commended for sharing
information from his efforts and graciously providing the materials for documentation, but it must be
recognized that the bulk of grave goods were unearthed during his uncontrolled efforts. Human
burial data in private collections or unearthed in
uncontrolled manners, such as these, are often documented by archeologists (e.g., Comuzzieet al. 1986;
Mallouf 1987; Word and Fox 1975; Parker 1982).
Since burials contain important component-specific
information, such documentation is clearly needed.
Nonetheless, this is an imperfect context. Despite
this drawback, this chapter presents details of the
burials, artifacts reported to be in association, and
skeletal data. Hamilton discusses problems with
several of the burials, which is often related to the
lack of solid context. Regardless, the Granado Cave
burials contained a wealth of perishable items that
are fully described in subsequent chapters.
Chapters 6 (Cordage and Cotton), 7 (Basketry),
8 (Matting, Bags, and Sandals), and 9 (Wood Artifacts) provide detailed descriptions of the perishable materials. Be assured, there are plenty of interesting artifact photographs and descriptions in these
chapters. The presence of cotton is used to suggest
a trade network existed with villages to the west.
Hamilton states (pg. 89) that "radiocarbon dates

from the associations containing cotton are the earliest dates for cotton in Texas." Other unique and
important artifacts presented in these chapters include a deep parching tray (mud-coated basket) and
other coiled baskets with mud-coated and charred
interior surfaces, several tumpline carrying or burden baskets (presented as "Rustler Hills Kiahil.s"),
distinctive plaited and twined mats, twined rabbit
robes, twined grass bags, woven fishtail sandals, a
notched rhythm stick and sounding stick, rabbit
sticks, arrow fragments, and a notched arrow
foreshaft. Hamilton argues (pg. 126) that several of
these items are unlike any others in the region or
greater Southwest, and "indicate that the people
who inhabited this area were a small group of conservative hunters and gatherers who concentrated
on subsisting in a harsh, unforgiving environment."
To his credit, Hamilton conducted a bit of experimental archeology by constructing a tumpline
basket like the ones recovered with the burials.
Although one illustration (Fig. 7.8) is provided to
show the exterior surface of the weaver's knot, the
description of this step-by-step process would be a
little easier to visualize if additional schematic illustrations had been provided.
Chapter 10 presents pottery from the site and
other nearby sites, all attributed to trade from cultures in adjacent areas: the Casas Grandes area of
Chihuahua, agricultural villages around El Paso,
and Puebloan groups in the regions of the Seven
Rivers and the middle Rio. Grande. Only a single
"killed" Mata Red-on-Brown Textured jar and 21
sherds from other vessels were recovered from
Granado Cave. Pieces of the jar, a minor type at
Casa Grandes (Di Peso et al. 1974), had been
found by Mr. Granado around Burials 2 and 3,
with additional sherds recovered by Hamilton. A
photo (Fig. 10.1) shows the reconstructed vessel.
However, a drawing (Fig. 10.2) better illustrates
the design elements. Hamilton's accompanying description is thorough, and discusses difficulties in
typing the jar as well as chronological considerations. He ultimately assigns the jar to Burial 2;
however, this association cannot be confidently
demonstrated due to removal of both burials by Mr.
Granado. In Table 10.1 Hamilton provides quantified data on ceramics recovered from sites in the
Rustler Hills, illustrating the relative scarcity of
pottery in the area and the types present. The table
would be easier to read if the three areas the ceramics originated from (South Central New Mexico, El
Paso and Mimbres Area, and Northern Chihuahua)

were highlighted, bolded or indented in some manner. As presented, the areas, types, and subtotals
are all in the same column making it hard to distinguish the separations.
Chapter 11, written by John E. Dockall and
Harry J. Shafer, details recovered lithic artifacts.
This analysis is presented in a comprehensive and
understandable manner, indicating most of the tools
at the site were expediently manufactured. The authors use past use-wear studies from Hinds Cave
(Shafer and Holloway 1979) and other considerations to classify seven specimens as "Chert Agave/
Sotol Knives." This formal name contrasts to the
informal appearance of the implements (see Figure
11.3). Since utilized edges of six of these (one was
not measured) contained somewhat disparate splineplane angles-27, <30, 32, 39, 45, and 60.5 degrees-some of these tools were likely used for
additional or other purposes. Five arrow points were
recovered and the authors state (pg. 192) that "the
only arrow points found in Granado Cave that can
be dated by radiocarbon association are illustrated
in Figure 11.7 (b, d, e)." However, the caption for
(b) states that it was found on the surface. Another
problem with this discussion is that the specimens
illustrated as (a), (c), and (e) are said to be probable
variants of Livermore with Mallouf (1987:9, Figure 6) cited. Checking the reference, only (e) appears to be similar to the illustrated points from the
cairn at Burnt Springs, but is typologically unassignable due to breakage. Furthermore, Mallouf,
who is currently working with the Livermore Cache
(Janes 1930) and a number of other Livermore phase
sites, indicates that stem configurations [expanding] of specimens (a) and (c) do not conform well
to the Livermore type (Robert J. Mallouf, personal
communication 2005). One other typological assessment is questionable. The specimen illustrated
in Figure 11. 7i is said (pg. 194) to resemble "a
Palmillas dart point in its moderate shoulders, expanding stem, and its convex base." The illustration indicates the stem is parallel-sided, a form not
usually attributable to the Palmillas type (Suhm, et
al. 1954:462; Turner and Hester 1993: 167).
A few other comments on this chapter are offered. The authors divide bifaces into Stage I and
Stage II categories (pg. 194), but do not give a
reference even though several different biface classifications have been developed. In the discussion
under the heading of Dorsal Variation (pgs 200201), there is a pronounced editorial error. The
opening paragraph is repeated almost verbatim in

294

Texas Archeological Society

the middle of the following paragraph, the only
difference being a percentage; 20/377 presented as
51.3% initially, then conectly as 5.31 % in the second version. While the percentage is ultimately corrected, it is somewhat surprising that such an enor
occurs in a book of a major press. Another apparent
editorial decision that is questionable occurs in Figure 11.9, a bar graph showing the size grade of
debitage as broken down by material type. Both
black and white bars are used for two separate size
classifications (white-0-10 mm and 10-20 mm;
black--40-50 mm and 60-70 mm) making portions of the graph difficult to comprehend.
Chapter 12 (Miscellaneous Artifacts) presents
some of the more interesting specimens recovered
from Granado Cave. These are divided into the
following categories: Ceremonial Items, Bone
Tools, Beads, Feathers, and Desiccated Fruit. The
ceremonial items, all recovered from burials, are of
special interest since they are rarely seen. There are
excellent descriptions and photographs of these
specimens, which consist of an unusual limonite
cone, clay balls, a rattlesnake-rattler rattle, deerhoof tinklers, a bird-head skin, and tanned skins.
The limonite cone and bird-head skin are both described as one-of-a-kind aitifacts, which seems substantiated given their descriptions and step-by-step
accounts of how they were made. All in all this
chapter provides some fascinating information.
Chapter 13, by Cristi Assad Hunter, contains
data on 2,938 vertebrate faunal remains. This chapter is straightforward, with the findings illustrated
in four easy to read tables. One of the tables (Table
13.4) lists faunal remains from select Granado Cave
coprolites. The predominance of cottontail and jackrabbit bones in the overall collection is supported
with similar data from the coprolites. Additionally,
through her analysis, Hunter indicates (pg. 234)
"that small animals were eaten either whole or in
part, with the bones being chewed and swallowed
along with the soft tissue." Further faunal data is
presented in an appendix written by Hunter and
David L. Carlson, which provides information on
how two species of cottontail found in Culberson
County were differentiated. Since this data is applicable in other areas, it should prove useful to the
larger archeological community.
Chapter 14, written by Hamilton and John R.
Bratten, provides pollen data recovered from coprolites in both Granado Cave and Caldwell Shelter
No. 1. There is a great deal of interesting data in
this chapter indicating (pgs. 254-257) ingestion of

grasses, Mormon tea, desert hackbeny, mesquite,
cactus, and a few other plants. They also offer that
several of these may have been ingested to combat
dianhea since a majority of the coprolite samples
were paddylike. Here again data are suggestive of
poor water in the area, although in this case it is
prehistoric data. The authors establish an "economic
pollen spectrum" for the Rustler Hills and compare
this with similar data obtained from Hinds Cave
(Lower Pecos) and Frightful Cave (Chihuahua,
Mexico). They state (pg. 258) "An economic pollen spectrum ... is a pollen signature of a particular
culture inhabiting a particular region, based on the
plants that were being intentionally ingested during
a particular time range." The problem I see with
this definition is that it is extremely difficult to
positively identify "a particular culture" at any site
based on a coprolite. Even if Hamilton's premise is
correct that a single "culture" is represented at
Granado Cave, there is the possibility that other
cultural groups traveling through the area may have
"deposited" some of the coprolites. The comparison with Hinds Cave and Frightful Cave provide
some interesting data, but since the time periods
represented by these three data sets span different
portions of the past the results do not allow for
substantive interpretation. Changes through time at
a given site or comparison of sites in different regions at the same point in time would be much
more useful.
Radiocarbon dating is presented in Chapter 15,
although much of this data is discussed previously.
Stuiver and Reimer (1993) are cited for the calibration program used throughout. However, presentation of the data is somewhat unique. For example, a
sample of human skin from Burial 1 (Tx-3093) was
reported (pg. 54) as yielding a date of "A.D. 310
(403) 496," while a piece of human skin from Burial
2 (Tx-2823) is reported (pg. 57) as yielding a date
of "A.D. 409 (-446-) 615." The figure in parentheses is apparently a "most likely" date, but the dashes
in the latter example are particularly puzzling.
Eleven of the 20 dates are reported with the dashes,
and this should be explained for the reader.
An additional problem with the dating, primarily discussed in Chapter 5, is that Hamilton accepts one date for three of the burials (Burials 2, 4,
and 5) while disregarding other date(s) from the
same interment. On page 263 he states, "Dates on
skin, both rabbit and human, were found to be consistently older than any accompanying material. As
such, these radiocarbon dates are best disregarded."

Reviews 295

This would seem to explain his accepted dates for
Burials 2 and 4; however, he disregards a date
from a sedge mat in Burial 5 while accepting a
date from cordage. One would presume this was
because it fit his model better, but all he offered
(pg. 65) was that "The grass mat date of A.D.
993-115 is deemed to be the most reliable in this
instance." He apparently meant to say that the
cordage date was acceptable. As far as "disregarding" radiocarbon dates from human skin, right
after cautioning about the reliability of such material, Hamilton states (pg. 263), "If the date of the
sedge mat from Burial 5 (TX-3096) of A.D. 191
and possibly the human skin date from Burial 1
(Tx-3093) of A.D. 403 are also taken to be valid,
then this range extends to A.D. 190/400 to A.D.
1430." Despite the above criticism, Hamilton is
commended for dating and reporting so many
samples from a single site in the region.
Despite the positive points of the book presented above, this author cannot agree with many
of the conclusions in the final chapter. Especially
troubling is the new phase proposed for the Rustler
Hills, termed the Castile phase. While Hamilton is
applauded for his review of guidelines for defining
archeological phases as proposed by Willey and
Phillips (1958:22-29) and his discussion of
Johnson's (1987) critique of past phase designations in Texas, he (pg. 274) summarily casts those
cautions aside and proposes that the "Castile phase"
be used to designate the cultures of the Rustler
Hills for the period A.D. 200-1450.
Hamilton brings several separate lines of evidence forward in this discussion. Using Newcomb
(1961) and Hickerson (1994) among others, he offers the possibility that early inhabitants of the west,
or perhaps entire continent, were Hokan speakers,
later split by invading groups of Uto-Aztekan- and
Athapaskan-speaking people. In this model, the
Hokan speakers, represented in Historic times by
the Coahuiltecans of South Texas and groups on
the Pacific coast, were pushed into unoccupied,
marginal environments in late prehistoric times by
the other groups. Here the poor quality of the water
is cited in suggesting the Rustler Hills to be such a
place. Furthermore, Hamilton provides past skeletal classificatory nomenclature (Otomid) to suggest similarities between a nearby burial most likely
from Paleoindian times (Midland Man), and those
from the Rustler Hills and the Oso site in South

Texas, the latter "assumed to be representative of a
Coahuiltecan skeletal form (pg. 269)." Hamilton then
states (pg. 269), "The time period involved, the
amount of occupational debris, the number of burials, and the marked similarities in the material culture found in the Rustler Hills indicate that the caves
were occupied by a relatively small group of individuals who were probably related." After questioning Sayles' (1935) assignment of findings in the
Rustler Hills to the Hueco phase, and Lehmer' s
(1948) placement of the Hueco phase as the earliest
of the Jornada Branch, Hamilton provides a critique
of this somewhat controversial phase, defined well
before the advent of radiocarbon dating and other
modern analytical techniques. He concludes that a
Hueco period of an unknown time span be assigned
to the region encompassed by southern New Mexico
and the northern half of the Trans-Pecos.
While Hamilton is commended for his suggested refinement of the Hueco phase, his Castile
phase is problematic, at least in this author's mind.
The duration of this phase is rather long, a span of
1,250 years (A.D. 200-1450) in which a single
culture is said to exist in the Rustler Hills and Great
Gypsum Plain-and Hamilton says it could have
started even earlier and extended later in time (pg.
274). Also troubling is the lack of open sites in the
model that would, if present, provide a more holistic understanding of use of the environment. Furthermore, the lack of extensive excavation at
Granado Cave, and the factthat most of the burials
and grave goods were recovered by Mr. Granadowithout proper archeological methods, techniques,
and documentation-relegate the phase to one that
needs serious investigation and refinement. To
Hamilton's credit, he does state (pg. 276) that the
phase "can be more clearly delineated with subsequent excavations." I would argue there needs to be
a great deal more excavation data, from both within
sinkholes of the area and open sites that are not
directly adjacent to sinkholes to make this a welldefined phase.
In closing, thanks are extended to Hamilton
and the other authors of the Granado Cave report
for following through with publication of the data
despite a lengthy delay. The report offers a great
deal of data that will be useful in understanding
cultures of the area and greater region. Of particular value are the descriptions, photographs, and schematic drawings of the perishable artifacts.

A Pest in the Land: New World Epidemics in a Global Perspective, by Suzanne Austin Alchon.
University of New Mexico Press, Albuquerque, 2003. ix+ 214 pp.

Reviewed by Waldo Troell

Pest in the Land takes on a common theme,
and one of interest to archeologists here in Texas:
the spread and outcome of European disease on
Native American populations. Suzanne Austin
Alchon presents a slimly held theory: that virgin
soil epidemics (diseases new to a land or region),
such as small pox, measles, and the plague were no
more devastating to American populations than they
were when the same diseases arrived in Europe,
Asia, and Africa. This perspective contradicts the
common perception that scholars today associate
the decline of Native American populations after
the introduction of these Old World diseases. Instead, Alchon presents the view that the great loss
of population and failure of Native Americans to
recover and reestablish their political and economic
control was caused by European colonialism, which
created practices of continental warfare, abusive
labor conditions, slavery, and forced, violent migrations. She posits that these practices undermined
the social, political, and economic structures, resulting in the downfall of the Native groups.
The author presents data to support l:ler
assumption that neither colonialism nor epidemic
disease exclusively caused the decline in Native
American populations. Instead, she attempts to
integrate both views as the cause of the population
loss. In Chapter 1 Alchon gives examples from the
historic record in which human response to illnesssuch as divine causality, isolation of the sick, flight
of the healthy, healing prayers and rituals-is the
same throughout the Old World, in both Europe
and the Middle East. She also points out that leaders'
reactions to frequent epidemics affected rates of
mortality. For instance, in Europe the elites devised
control methods that limited the impact on the
population, while the Middle East did not. In
contrast, she asserts that the Middle Eastern belief
that disease was God's will resulted in greater
devastation because they failed to install controls to
limit the spread of those diseases. Her documentation for these differences often consisted of

extensive anecdotes from historic documents. While
I appreciated the anecdotes, the sheer volume of
these accounts sometimes made them too much to
grasp and they seemed repetitive.
In Chapter 2, the author describes the major
issues in the disease environments in the Americas
versus disease environments in the Old World.
Examples include lack of crowded infective type
diseases or domesticated animals. A discussion of
extant disease in the New World and warfare
patterns of groups encountered in the New World
follows, and together these indicate the prehistoric
New World was not a paradise. Unfortunately, this
discussion was not as helpful as I had hoped because

Bulletin of the Texas Archeological Society 76 (2005)

Texas Archeological Society

Alchon does not define the medical terms she
employs; instead she assumes the reader is
acquainted with them.
Alchon used Chapter 3 to compare and contrast virgin soil epidemic outbreaks in the New and
Old Worlds. Similar to the information already presented, she includes multiple historic accounts to
describe epidemics introduced into and spread
through Native Americans populations, and she provides the resulting mortality rates to reflect similarities in population migrations, mortality rates,
and military actions. Then, Alchon presents the
major difference: time. In the New World, introduction of so many virgin soil epidemics occurred
at one time, whereas in the Old World populations
usually had a few generations to recover between
epidemic occurrences. In her opinion, it was this
quick, expansive devastation that was the key to
Native populations' inability to regain their populations or power structures.
In Chapter 4, the author explains the four colonial systems affecting Native Americans and the
way these different approaches influenced native
groups' survival. This description was well researched and quite helpful. In fact, I had not seen as
detailed a description of how colonial systems affected native populations elsewhere. Here, Alchon
reiterates that Native Americans did not have a
reduced immunity to virgin soil epidemics compared to people in the Old World, but rather were at
a disadvantage because these diseases were released

on the New World over such a short time. When
coupled with the harsh and many times devastating
policies of the colonial powers, the Native Americans could not reorganize.
In this slim volume, Alchon effectively weaves
together two competing views of Native American
decline, providing a richer and more accurate view
of the complex nature of cultures clashing and its
impact on the New World populations. And, she
does it effectively because she provides so many
examples from the historical record, both Old and
New World. On the other hand, such heavy reliance
on those accounts limited the book's scope. No
discussion of possible environmental factors, like
the severe drought during the 1500s, was included.
This failure disappointed me. Although exclusion
of other contributing factors does not directly
undermine her argument, their omission does. It
makes the reader wonder if she ever considered
those contributing factors or if she simply is unaware
of them. Also, Alchon uses what I would consider
to be controversial archeological dates for the
introduction of people to the New World that are
not well accepted by the archeological community.
Again, while this does not strictly affect her
argument, it does raise the question of the accuracy
of other information in the book. In summary, I
found the book to be informative; however, I would
have liked a more conservative timeline and more
inclusive treatment of potential causes of Native
American population decline in the New World.

Gulf Coast Archeology: The Southeastern United States and '-'"-''1'1."Â·" edited by Nancy Marie White.
University Press of Florida, Gainesville, 2005. xvi+ 416 pp.

Reviewed by Scott Pletka

The edited volume Gulf Coast Archaeology:
The Southeastern United States and Mexico concerns the relationship between the prehistoric cultures of these regions. As the title implies, the scope
of this book is broad. It not only discusses the
archeology of the Southeastern United States, Texas,
and Mexico but covers many time periods and types
of material culture. According to the introductory
chapter-penned by editor White-the book is intended primarily for scholars of the Gulf Coast,
encouraging them to consider anew possible regional connections. White also expresses hope that
the book may also prove interesting to scholars of
long-distance interaction. The book does contain
many worthwhile chapters. As a whole, however,
this volume is unlikely to satisfy either audience.
The volume originated from a symposium held
at the annual meetings of the Society for American
Archaeology. As this origin implies, the book's
chapters vary greatly in their adherence to the stated
topic and in their approach to that topic. White's
introductory and concluding chapters strive mightily to integrate the material found in the rest of .the
book, with some success. Some contributions breezily assert that various similarities in material culture between the Southeast and Mexico provide
evidence for some sort of ties between the peoples
of these regions, leaving it to future research to
work out the details. Other chapters delve into the
details of local adaptations, providing the reader
with the opportunity to engage in the comparative
work. Few chapters, however, tackle head-on the
meaning and significance of the putative ties between the Southeast and Mexico.
The chapters which focus on Mexico exemplify this diversity. The contributions by Wilkerson,
Cabrera, and Ocana all point to various material
culture similarities between Mexico and the Southeast. Daneels and colleagues postulate that some
Middle and Late Classic Period groups in Veracruz
grew crops like cotton for use in long-distance exchange. Pool documents variability in the scale of

organization among Olmec societies, drawing parallels to similar variability among Mississippian
groups. Clark and Knoll chart the appearance and
spread of maize, manioc, mounds, and ceramics
around North and South America. They conclude
that the movement of goods, ideas, and peoples has
a deep but complicated history. Colonization does
not seem to have been a particularly important
mechanism by which goods and ideas diffused.
Two chapters concentrate on the Southeast but
that is about all they have in common. Widmer
discusses the environmental conditions which engendered complex social organization around the
Gulf Coast. Kehoe, in contrast, details additional

Bulletin of the Texas Archeological Society 76 (2005)

similarities in material culture between the Southeast and Mexico, arguing that Mississippian societies shared symbols of power with Mesoamerica.
The contributions from Texas distinguish themselves in a number of ways. These chapters make
accessible data collected from a number of cultural
resource management projects. They are among the
best-written chapters. And they seem to have a sometimes tenuous connection to the rest of the volume.
The archeological record of coastal Texas is
generally quite different from the record of neighboring regions. The effort made by the book to
grapple with the distinctiveness of Texas is one of
its most laudable features. Although Texan groups
did maintain ties to Southeastern and Mexican cultures, the extent of those ties appears limited compared to the relationships said to exist between the
Southeast and Mexico. The apparent lack of interaction with Texas may nevertheless provide useful
clues for understanding the interaction occurring
elsewhere. One of the four Texas-themed chapters
discusses this issue extensively.
Chapters by Ricklis and Weinstein, Gadus, and
Kibler deal much more thoroughly with details of
coastal hunter-gatherer subsistence and mobility in
Texas. A second chapter by Kibler, however, directly addresses the circumstances that limited inter-regional interaction through Texas. Poor environmental conditions along the south Texas coast
inhibited the transmission of people, goods, and
ideas through this area, so Southeastern and Mexican groups presumably took alternate routes by sea
to maintain whatever relationships they had.
Despite the diversity of these chapters, some
themes do emerge. Features of the Gulf, such as

favorable ocean currents and the ubiquity of
navigable rivers which drain into it, promoted interregional trade and other kinds of long-distance
relationships. Many authors see stable sea levels and
favorable environmental conditions as a key to
explaining the emergence of sedentary and complex
societies around the Gulf. Estuaries and lagoons
provided abundant resources for hunter-gathererfishers while rivers supported ample fertile lands for
farmers. These groups developed inter-regional ties
which may have been important for the emergence
of social inequality and hierarchical organization.
Elites in both the Southeast and Mesoamerica built
similar types of monuments, which may have
originated in eastern North America. These groups
may have shared symbols and an underlying ideology
that supported their status.
The book may best serve as a source of inspiration for scholars interested in the topic of prehistoric Gulf Coast connections. It raises many issues,
resolving few. How can the observed similarities
be explained? What is the history of contacts among
regions? Why are specific elements of material culture adopted in a particular time and place? Readers sympathetic to the idea that contact between the
Southeast and Mexico fostered significant social
developments may be disappointed that the book
generally does not explore detailed hypotheses regarding the origins and mechanisms of this contact.
Readers unsympathetic to this idea will likely remain unconvinced, since the evidence marshaled in
its favor is often dispensed in a cursory fashion.
Those readers simply interested in that blank spot
on the map of Gulf Coast archaeology where Texas
lies will be most likely to find some new insights.

Rock Art of the Lower Pecos, by Carolyn E. Boyd. Texas A&M University Press, College Station. 2003,
xii + 139 pages.

Reviewed by Nancy A. Kenmotsu

If you enjoyed the Texas Archeological
Society's field school at Amistad National Recreation Area, if you have an interest in rock art or the
prehistory of the Lower Pecos, or if you are simply
interested in the Middle Archaic or hunter-gatherer
archeology, then Carolyn Boyd's book is for you.
A professional artist who then earned her doctorate
in anthropology, Boyd brings a unique perspective
to the world class rock art of the Lower Pecos
region, a perspective that allowed her to move beyond sketching, documenting, and photographing
individual elements within the large painted panels
on shelter walls in the Lower Pecos region. This
perspective is presented in Chapter One "The Work
of Art." Here she asks the reader to consider the
content behind any work of art, including rock art
that is thousands of years old. She correctly notes
that "archaeological research has focused on the
more material aspects of life, avoiding the areas of
human cognition or symbolic structures" (page 3),
particularly in the United States. She admonishes
us to lose our reluctance to consider symbolic features, saying "In non-Western societies ... art objects are often considered essential and powerful
instruments-not passive props but active participants in the sociocultural system within which they
were produced" (page 3). She feels strongly that the
rock art of the Lower Pecos was an active participant
in the local sociocultural system. She began working
in that region by first drawing individual elements,
but she quickly "recognized that the placement of
imagery on the shelter walls was not random but
patterned" (page 27). This book is about her unraveling and interpretating the patterns in five panels from
Rattlesnake Canyon (41VV180), White Shaman
(41VV124), Panther Cave (41VV83), Mystic Shelter (41VV612), and Cedar Springs (41VV696). From
these panels, she argues that:

The art and artists were active agents in
creating, maintaining, reproducing, and
challenging existing social relations and

religious identities. The rock art preformed work-it was a powerful form of
technology used to ensure the continuation of self and society in the lower Pecos
region four thousand years ago (page 5,
emphasis in the original).
She goes on to describe the five panels and
detail motifs that are sets of inter-related elements
that are repeated. Some are repeated within the same
site; others are found at several or all five sites.
Motif A, found in all five panels as well as
elsewhere in the region, is described in Chapter
four and consists of a crenelated arch, an opening
in the center of the arch, and a skeletonized anthropomorphic figure located above, behind, or below the arch. The anthropomorph is either surrounded by a particular animal (panther or deer)

Bulletin of the Texas Archeological Society 76 (2005)

302

Texas Archeological Society

or has animal attributes, such as horns, on its body.
Having identified this motif and its patterns across
the sites, Boyd searched the ethnographic literature
to find parallel arches that represent part of that
society's symbolic belief system. Using examples
from the Aztec, Huichol, Yaqui, and Hopi, she finds
that the literature "revealed striking similarities"
between iconography in each of those societies and
that of the Lower Pecos motif (page 54). Because
of the striking similarities (and they truly are striking), she suggests that the broad meanings of the
iconography in those societies may be applied to
better understand the motifs in the Lower Pecos.
Specifically, she suggests that the arches are "analogous to the serpent as the barrier or gateway through
which the shaman must pass on his or her journey
to the otherworld" (page 55). The opening in the
arch is the passageway itself, while the shaman is
the anthropomorph. Skeletonizing the anthropomorph (where the anthropomorphic figure has a
series of lines across its body) is interpreted to
mean the shaman is experiencing "a ritual death in
order to be reborn into the spiritual realm" (page
55). Finally, the animals and animal attributes represent the shaman's assistant.
To strengthen her interpretations, Boyd turns
to cognitive neuroscience and studies of hallucinatory imagery. Some of this literature is from studies
of shamans who were asked to draw or describe the
images they saw while under the influence of one
or another hallucinogens. Other literature comes
from medical studies of migraine hallucinations.
Because arches, zigzag lines, arid other patterns are
commonly reported in these studies, Boyd uses these
studies to support her analogies.
Chapter five looks at Motifs B and C in ways
similar to the discussion of Motif A in Chapter
four. Since these two motifs are interpreted to be
associated with the use, during the Middle Archaic, of psychotropic plants by shamans, the chapter is an important one for researchers in the Lower
Pecos. I will not, however, offer details of her
analysis and interpretation, but encourage readers
to explore it personally.
In her final chapter, she returns to the theme
that rock art is not decorative or non-utilitarian.
Rather it represents iconography of symbols
important to the society that created it. It "worked"
(page 106) within the Lower Pecos to communicate
relationships between animals, the local ecology,
and the social environment. "[R]ock art was a
vehicle through which important information and

instruction could be disseminated to the community
without threatening autonomy" that was important
to hunter-gatherers (page 107).
The volume is well written, well researched
and, in general, quite powerful. However, some
aspects of the book are problematic for me. First, as
one of those conservative, materialistic archeologists, while I agree with her that art can be an active
participant in a sociocultural system, the extent to
which she takes this is a stretch. I can go part way
with her, but her ethnographic analogies, while powerful, are from relatively recent and/or modern
groups. CanÂ·ying these analogies back 4,000 years
makes me want more demonstrable evidence in the
material remains. And, I hope that future researchers in the Lower Pecos region try to look for evidence to support (or not) her interpretations, a hope
that she also expresses in her final chapter. Certainly, she challenges us to reanalyze and look at
the evidence in new ways. Also in her favor, she
notes the geographic variations in some of the patterns-feather hipclusters in the rock art around
Seminole Canyon versus rabbit-eared anthropomorphs west of the Pecos. Is this evidence for territorial markers? As she concludes, the evidence is too
limited to answer that question yet. This and other
patterns need more empirical evidence, not just from
rock art studies, but also from excavations. Thus,
while her work is provocative, I find myself still
doing some fence-sitting but very intrigued.
Another minor problem is that she fails to mention the rampant looting that has occurred in the
Lower Pecos region. While this was certainly not
her thesis or purpose, I spent a number of years
doing intermittent field work in the shelters of the
Lower Pecos and they have been savaged by individuals looking for artifacts, including taking pieces
of rock art panels home to sit on their mantels. Any
book on the region, particularly one that is dedicated to the region's world class rock art has, in my
opinion, a duty to point out to all readers the irresponsible treatment the shelters have received over
the past few decades. Finally, she fails to mention
the efforts of the Texas Historical Commission in
the Lower Pecos. Given that this agency lead an
effort to install an archeologist at the National Recreation Area and to revive interest in the region and
protection for the sites, they deserved some mention, however slight.
These issues notwithstanding, the book is worth
obtaining for your library. It is extremely well
illustrated, both with black and white photographs

Reviews 303

and with Boyd's beautiful colored renderings of the
five rock art panels. For those who have seen the
remarkable rock art of the region, that makes the
book an excellent addition to your libraries. And,
regardless of whether you do or do not agree with

her interpretations, it is a very thoughtful and serious
attempt to use the rock art to better understand the
peoples who occupied the region 4,000 years ago.
For this alone, I urge all members of the Society to
read the book.

From a Watery Grave: The Discovery and Excavation of La Salle's Shipwreck, La Belle, by James E.
Bruseth and Toni S. Turner. Texas A&M University Press, College Station, 2005, xiii + 139 pp.,
plates, maps, figures.

Reviewed by Mary Jo Galindo

This publication covers one of the most
remarkable undertakings in twentieth-century
archeology in Texas. From its inception, the
project-to locate, excavate, and preserve La
Belle-is marked by firsts. Whether you consider
the private sector fundraising, the multi-million
dollar coffer dam, or the sheer number of amazing
artifacts recovered by the project, the excavation of
La Belle is one for the U.S. history books.
The story appropriately begins in 1686 as the
La Belle lay anchored in Matagorda Bay. Bruseth
and Turner's narrative relies on the Journal of
Henri Joutel 1684-1687, Robert Weddle's Wreck
of the Belle and Wilderness Manhunt: The Spanish Search for La Salle, and the surviving pages
from La Belle's log archived in Seville, among
other historical documents.
Sidebars highlight important concepts and provide footnoted sources that facilitate further research. The narrative is carefully footnoted throughout. Notes appear in a separate appendix, which
both promotes a seamless read and cause the interested scholar to continually flip to the back of the
book instead of to the end of each chapter. I dealt
with this annoyance, as ever, by keeping my current page of notes bookmarked.
Despite this wealth of citations, the narrative
makes some unsubstantiated assertions, particularly
regarding the stranded French crew's alcohol consumption, for example, that left this reader wondering how such statements could be based on anything
but stereotypical supposition and bias. In general,
however, I found the narrative to be quite effective
at offering plausible, fact-based, historical recreations
of pivotal, as well as mundane, moments.
The Spanish began searching for Robert
Cavelier, Sieur de La Salle about a year before the
La Belle was shipwrecked, thanks to Denis Thomas, who abandoned the voyage in Haiti. He evaded
the dangers of the Gulf of Mexico to sail with
pirates. Their ship was soon captured by the Spanish and, in an attempt to save his life, he insisted he

was not a pirate and confessed his knowledge of La
Salle's plans. He told them La Salle was bound for
the mouth of the Mississippi River to create a settlement that would support the exploration of the Spanish silver mines to the west.
The revelation prompted the Spanish to send
a total of eleven expeditions by land and sea to
search for the would-be invaders. The impact of
the news would last for decades and would
influence future Spanish colonization efforts such
as Nuevo Santander along the lower Rio Grande
valley in the mid-eighteenth century. Jumano,
Cfbolo, and Karankawa Indians also fueled Spanish fears with reports of contact with French
traders and French inquiries about Spanish silver
mines. Representatives of these three Indian
groups were also instrumental in recovering and
preserving the pages of La Belle's log from Fort

St. Louis that were eventually placed in the
archives of Seville.
Chapter 2 summarizes La Salle's motivation,
experiences, and talents that led him to undertake
his ill-fated voyage. We are reminded of La Salle's
impressive accomplishments prior to his mistaken
landing in Matagorda Bay. He discovered the mouth
of the Mississippi River at the Gulf of Mexico and
claimed possession of one-third of the North American continent for France. In Chapter 4 we learn that
Louis XIV diverted La Salle to the Gulf of Mexico
from his originally planned northerly route to
Canada and then down the Mississippi River. This
change was not without consequences. La Salle had
been warned by experienced sailors about the strong
easterly currents that carried ships towards the Bahamian Channel as they traversed the Gulf of
Mexico, and he also had to contend with inaccurate
seventeen-century navigational aids. Thus, when
land was sighted, La Salle wrongly concluded they
were east of the Mississippi River and pointed his
ships into the sunset.
Chapter 3 fast-forwards to the 1970s when
Southern Methodist University archeologist Kathleen
Gilmore focused on the Keenan site in Victoria
County. Her ceramic analysis provided the first conclusive evidence supporting this as the location of La
Salle's Fort St. Louis. Having found the fort, Gilmore
knew La Belle had to be close by. She consulted
historical maps and gleaned whatever locational data
they offered. Geomorphologist Robert Morton of the
University of Texas then went to work modeling
shoreline changes since 1686 and defined high probability areas for a magnetometer survey in search of
La Belle and her sister ship l'Aimable. Barto Arnold
undertook a magnetometer and helicopter survey
based on these data, but did not meet with success in
1978. He was, however, involved in the second successful attempt in 1995, using a transportation enhancement grant to do so.
In the interim years, a dearth of public funding
for the project prompted efforts to secure private
funding from several foundations and a federal highway initiative through the Texas Department of
Transportation to spend tax dollars on promoting
attractions that can be viewed by the traveling public. Thus, with a melange of private and public
monies, was born one of the most significant examples of Heritage Tourism in the state. It would
be years before a string of museums along the Texas
Gulf Coast would rise to house the magnificent La
Belle artifacts, but by July 1995 a 17-year search

culminated in conclusive evidence in the form of a
French-inscribed cannon, whose manufacturing date
was consistent with La Salle's voyage.
Chapter 4 takes the reader from the initial formation of the research design and recovery strategy
through the excavations inside the coffer dam and
down to the removal of the final hull timbers. Total
recovery of La Belle was decided upon despite the
high costs because it would be impossible to protect the remains of the shipwreck in the future were
it only partially excavated. Construction of the
multi-million dollar coffer dam provided dry conditions by which to excavate and undoubtedly allowed the archeologists to maximize their study
and collection of the remarkably well-preserved ship
and cargo.
Operating the coffer dam cost $100,000 per
month. The challenges of securing private funds to
continue the project at critical stages was aided by
the tremendous public interest in the recovery effort. The expense of the coffer dam is justified by
the project's significant contribution to our understanding of Texas colonial history. Because of the
fine efforts of all who conceived of the plan, sweated
in the dirt, or contributed monetarily to its success,
the recovery of La Belle and her cargo represents a
milestone in U.S. archeology.
Chapter 5 is an in-depth look at the beautiful
vessel that was La Belle. By deciding to disassemble the hull, archeologists revealed that the ship
was actually a kit, designed to be carried as Trans
Atlantic cargo and assembled upon reaching North
America. Disassembly offered incredible insights
into seventeen-century ship building practices. Construction techniques and details revealed La Belle
as a unique example of the merging of two styles of
shipbuilding (Mediterranean and Atlantic) during
the time of a royal effort to modernize the French
Navy's shipbuilding practices.
Analysis of the type and age at harvest of the
trees used to hewn La Belle's hull timbers produced surprising results. It turns out that many of
the large timbers were recycled. Nearly all were
harvested 20 years before the ship was constructed.
Some were cut more than 200 years prior to construction. Of the samples that could be analyzed
dendrochronologically, a majority of the trees providing timbers were 100 years old at harvest. The
youngest was 60 years old when pressed into service as a part of La Belle's hull.
Chapter 6 is the heart of this publication perhaps
in large part because of the remarkable preservation

and array of artifacts recovered. If you want to cut
right to the chase, skip to the artifact photos which
begin on page 83. I jest, though, because without
the rest of the book's chapters, you'd be missing
the rich context that helps interpret these artifacts.
It is amazing that in so many categories, the La
Belle artifacts represent the most abundant, best
preserved in its class, and, in some cases, a unique
specimen that was previously unknown. Reading
the artifact descriptions, I could not help but
appreciate how La Belle's cargo will influence the

course of numerous theses and dissertations for
decades to come. Indeed, at Texas A&M there are
already several students engaged in preserving and
studying La Belle artifacts. The responsibilities of
caring for La Belle's cargo have influenced the
standards for curation facilities throughout Texas
in a manner similar to how the desire in the 1970s
to protect shipwrecks led to the establishment of
the Antiquities Code of Texas. In any event, the
book is a good read, and worth having in your
personal library.
