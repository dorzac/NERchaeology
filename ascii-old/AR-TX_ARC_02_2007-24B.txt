ABSTRACT

In late April and May of 2007, AR Consultants, Inc. monitored a pipeline
route constructed by the North Texas Municipal Water District through
site 41ZN8 which is on Sabine River Authority land leased by the Texas
Parks and Wildlife Department. The pipeline right-of-way was previously
pedestrian surveyed with three shovel tests for cultural resources but none
were found. AR Consultants, Inc. knew that site 41VN8 was present and
particular attention was paid to the area. However, flakes were spotted on
the ground surface north of the pipeline route but within the right-of-way
during a biological survey of the land owned by the Sabine River
Authority after the route had been cleared for pipeline construction. After
consultations between the Texas Parks and Wildlife Department, the
Sabine River Authority, the North Texas Municipal Water District, Freese
and Nichols, Inc. which is doing the environmental permitting for the
NTMWD, and the Archeology Division of the Texas Historical
Commission, it was decided that the most reliable manner to determine if
cultural features were present was to monitor further clearing of the
southern portion of the site area as well as monitor the excavation of the
proposed pipeline route. AR Consultants, Inc. monitored further clearing
of the pipeline route for vehicle access and construction of approximately
400 m of the pipeline route during late April and late May 2007. Only four
flakes and a manuport were found which also may have been found by the
TPWD. No buried cultural deposits or features or burials were uncovered
during trenching. Based upon the above, site 41VN8 probably consists of
scattered lithic areas and does not extend south of the pipeline route.

INTRODUCTION
The North Texas Municipal Water District (NTMWD) is constructing the Lake Tawakoni
Water Pipeline which will transport water from Lake Tawakoni in northeastern Van
Zandt County westerly through Hunt, Kaufman and Rockwall Counties, Texas. In 2006,
AR Consultants, Inc. conducted an intensive pedestrian archaeological survey of the
pipeline route and recommended that clearance be given for the project to proceed (Todd
2006). The Archeology Division of the Texas Historical Commission concurred. AR
Consultants, Inc. recognized that site 41VN8 was present slightly west of CR 3827 and
on Sabine River Authority land in Van Zandt County, Texas. The proposed pipeline route
crosses the southern portion of the site as mapped on the Texas Archeological Sites Atlas
(Figure 1). No cultural materials were seen on the ground surface or uncovered in three
shovel tests. However, the Texas Parks and Wildlife Department has leased the land from
the Sabine River Authority and flakes were found within the right-of-way during a
biological survey north of the pipeline route but within the pipeline right-of-way after the
land hand been cleared.
After consultations between the Texas Parks and Wildlife Department (TPWD), the
Sabine River Authority (SRA), the North Texas Municipal Water District (NTMWD),
Freese and Nichols, Inc. (F&N), which is doing the environmental permitting for the
NTMWD, and the Archeology Division of the Texas Historical Commission (THC), it
was decided that the most comprehensive manner to determine if a buried cultural deposit
was present was to monitor further clearing of the southern portion of the site area as well
as monitor the excavation of the proposed pipeline route. AR Consultants, Inc. was
contracted to perform the monitoring of the land clearing and pipeline route excavation
and did so in late April and May of 2007.
Site 41VN8 is a surface site containing chert spalls, core fragments, flakes and lithic
debris (Johnson 1957:11: Texas Archeological Sites Atlas 2007). Artifacts were found
eroding out of erosional cuts in the east slope of a low hill west of Duck Creek. The site
reportedly covers from five to ten acres. Based upon the absence of diagnostic artifacts,
Johnson recommended that the site did not warrant further investigations.
The study area is located within the Edge Soil Association which consists of nearly level
to strongly sloping upland loams (Stringer 1998:General Soils Map, 7-8). Specific soils in
the study area consist of Edge fine sandy loam with 5 to 12 percent slopes and LufkinRader complex with 0 to 1 percent slopes (Stringer 1998:Sheet 1). The B horizon for the
Rader series, which has the deepest subsoil, is listed as 24 inches (60 cm) below the
ground surface (Stringer 1988:75).
Since the Sabine River Authority owns the land and since it and the NTMWD and TWPD
are political subdivision of the State of Texas, Texas Antiquities Permit Number 4502
was issued for the archaeological survey. The purpose of the monitoring was to determine
if buried cultural materials were present.

This report was written in accordance with the report guidelines adopted by the
Archeology Division of the Texas Historical Commission and developed by the Council
of Texas Archeologists (ND). The report continues with the methodology used followed
by the chapter which describes the monitoring of the further clearing and excavation of
the pipeline. The conclusions follow and the references cited page ends the report.

MONITORING METHODOLOGY
AR Consultants, Inc. was asked to provide an archaeological monitor to be present when
the land was leveled for an access road across site 41VN8 and the construction of the
pipeline occurred across the site and AR Consultants, Inc. complied with the request. The
pipeline is 48 inches in diameter and is to be buried approximately 10 feet beneath the
ground. The further clearing of the right-of-way for vehicular access was monitored for
approximately 400 m east-west, the width of the Sabine River Authority land, and from
12 to 25 m north-south. During this phase, the archaeologist continually walked behind
the bulldozer.
During the excavation of the pipeline route which was from west to east, the
archaeologist inspected the trench walls and floor from the surface. The back dirt piles
were examined for cultural materials by walking around them whenever possible and
sifting the soil by hand. A daily log was kept of the clearing and excavation activities and
photographs were taken. Occasionally, a soil profile was made and the soil colors were
recorded using the Munsell Soil book. Based upon the description of the site and the
previous survey in the area, no cultural features or burials were expected.

RESULTS
An archaeologist from AR Consultants, Inc. was at site 41VN8 at 7:30 AM on April 26,
2007 to examine the cleared right-of-way (ROW) across site 41VN8. The ROW was
examined visually by walking at least 8 east-west oriented transects and several transects
north-south. Four flakes and a quartzite manuport (Figure 2) were found on the disturbed
ground surface. The lithic debris consisted of a red quartzite primary and interior flake, a
white chert interior flake and a gray chert primary flake. The red quartzite cobble
manuport was probably too small to have been used as a core. It had no battering marks.
The artifacts were sketched in the field and were not collected because they were not
diagnostic. The location of the small lithic scatter is shown on Figure 1. Todd McMakin,
archeologist for the Texas Parks and Wildlife Department found the six flakes
approximately 20 west of CR 2837 (McMakin 2007). They probably had been washed
away by the rain when the author visited the site.
After the cleared pipeline ROW was examined, the archaeologist then visually inspected
the cleared powerline access road north of the pipeline ROW. No cultural materials were
seen on the ground surface. At approximately 9:15 AM, Mr. Donald Hubbard of Rice
Inspection, Inc. and Mr. Jason Jensen of Garney Construction arrived at the site and
walked the ROW with the author. After the ROW was walked, Mr. Pedro Escobar of
Garney Construction began to level the land within the ROW so that it would be
accessible for trucks (Figure 3).

The archaeologist continually walked behind the bulldozer but no indications of buried
cultural features or burials were uncovered and no artifacts were encountered. After the
land was leveled, two trees were removed and the archaeologist monitored this process.
No cultural materials were seen.
Monitoring was done on May 21 through the 23, 2007m and began at the western
boundary of the Sabine River Authority land and proceeded east. Soil profile I was done
at this point. All soil colors are from the Munsell color chart and, once used, the soil
colors are not used again. The upper two zones of the Soil profile I are shown in Figure 4.

In the general vicinity of the where the artifacts were found, the soil profile was similar to
that of Soil profile III except that the brown very fine sandy loam was approximately 40
cm thick.
The monitoring was terminated when the pipeline route encountered the western edge of
CR 2837. This area along the road was previously disturbed from telephone cable
installation.

CONCLUSIONS
The purpose of this archaeological investigation was to determine if a buried cultural
deposit was present waithing the pipeline route as it crosses site 41VN8. None was
present. Based upon the artifact scatter that was found, site 41VN8 may be lithic
reduction area that was periodically occupied prehistorically. If there is a site core, it is
further north.
