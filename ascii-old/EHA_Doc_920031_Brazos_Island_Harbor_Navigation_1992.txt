ABSTRACT
During August and September 1991, Espey, Huston & Associates, Inc. (EH&A) completed
fieldwork under Delivery Order No. 0001, Contract DACW64-91-D-0004 for the Galveston District
Corps of Engineers (COE). The project involved archaeological investigations of previously
located magnetic anomalies within the Brownsville Entrance Channel, remote sensing survey of
Back Bay at the west end of the south jetty and investigations of selected remote-sensing targets
within Back Bay. This project was a follow-up to previous investigations conducted by EH&A
under COE Contract No. DACW64-89-D-0002, Delivery Order numbers 0007 (EH&A 1990) and
0010 (Hoyt cl al. 1991). The work was conducted under Texas Antiquities Permit No. 1044.
Back Bay is localed within the boundaries of Brazos Santiago Depot National Register Property
(41CF4), important for its role as the major port on the South Texas coast until after the Civil
War. As a result of this project, a railroad discovered buried under sediments within Back Bay has
tentatively been dated to 1864, based on archival evidence correlated with the archaeological
record. Pilings discovered within the northwest comer of the bay seem to correlate with the
historical position of the Government Wharf, built between 1868 and 1871. Observations of
environmental conditions combined with archaeological investigations within Back Bay suggests that
no further extant historical resources will be found within the bay. Two other archaeological sites
were recorded. Site 41 CF132 is a shipwreck located at the outer end of the south jetty, indicated
by steel hull plates wedged into the jetty rocks. The date of this wreck is undetermined.
Sile 41 CFR133 is a wooden-hulled wreck buried under the beach just south of the south jetty,
indicated by a keel fragment with attached timbers and fasteners observed by representatives of
the Texas Antiquities Committee in 1977 and recorded at this time based on the TAC field notes.

I. INTRODUCTION

On September 17, 1991, Espey, Huston & Associates, Inc. (EH&A) completed
fieldwork under Delivery Order No. 0001, Contract DACW 64-91-D-0004 for the Galveston
District Corps of Engineers (COE). This project, titled Underwater Investigations: Brazos Island
Harbor Navigation Project, Cameron County, Texas, involved archaeological investigations of
previously located magnetic anomalies within the Brownsville Entrance Channel, electronic survey
of Back Bay at the west end of the south jetty and investigations of selected remote-sensing targets
within Back Bay (Figure 1). The work was conducted under Texas Antiquities Permit No. 1044.
BACKGROUND
This project was a follow-up to previous investigations conducted by EH&A under
COE Contract No. DACW64-89-D-0002, Delivery Order numbers 0007 and 0010.
In 1989, prior to continued maintenance dredging by the COE, EH&A was contracted,
under Delivery Order No.0007, to conduct an electronic remote-sensing survey of 6.4 km section
of the Brownsville Entrance Channel and Brownsville Ship Channel, including the area adjacent
Brazos Santiago Depot (EH&A 1990). During the survey, a total of seventy-eight magnetic
anomalies were recorded. Sixteen of those were recommended for archaeological investigation and
seven of the sixteen anomalies were investigated by EH&A archaeological divers immediately
subsequent to the completion of the remote-sensing survey. None of the investigated anomalies
were determined to be generated by historically significant objects. One anomaly, designated
Anomaly R, was investigated due to its proximity to Brazos Santiago Depot, a National Register
site (41CF4). The source of this anomaly, was not positively identified at the time, although early
twentieth-century artifacts were found at the anomaly location.

In light of the COE's continuing interest in protecting historic resources in the area,
EH&A conducted additional archaeological testing, under Delivery Order No. 0010, in waters of
the Brownsville Ship Channel, Brownsville Entrance Channel and the adjacent Back Bay during
the fall of 1990 (Hoyt et al. 1991 ). A total of sixteen magnetic anomalies, all recorded under
Delivery Order No. 0007, were investigated by divers. None were determined to be historically
significant with the possible exception of Anomaly R, recorded in 1989. Back Bay, which lies
within the boundaries of the Brazos Santiago Depot National Register property (41CF4), was
evaluated for its potential to contain archaeological features. EH&A archaeologists diving in Back
Bay located a previously unrecorded railroad and wharf pilings, both believed to date lo the
mid-1800s. Archival research revealed unpublished historic maps and letters pertaining to Brazos
Santiago at the National Archives and the National Ocean Service Hydrographic Archives.
Selected historic maps were digitized on a CAD system and registered with a modern map of
Brazos Island to produce a set of historic shoreline overlays. Based on the data collected during
this project, a complete remote-sensing survey of Back Bay was recommended.
PRESENT PROJECT
The fieldwork was divided into seven tasks.

II: MARINE ENVIRONMENT
CLIMATE
The climate of the region is subtropical and semi-arid. Based on data collected during
the period 1951-1980, the annual average temperature at Brownsville is 73.6°F. Mean monthly
temperatures vary from 60.3°F in January to 84.1°F in July and August. Temperatures during midwinter normally vary from the low 50s at night to the high 60s during the afternoon. Mid-summer
temperatures normally range from the mid-70s at night to the low 90s during the afternoon (U.S.
Department of Commerce (USDC) 1966).
Rainfall is generally light, with September and October being the only months
averaging as much as 8 centimeters (cm). Much of the precipitation which does occur falls from
convective showers. Potentially heavy, short-duration rains due to thundershowers occur most
frequently from May through October. Heavy rains may also be associated with squall lines
preceding cold fronts during spring or fall months. Rains of longer duration are normally the
result of warm or stationary-frontal activity during the colder months, or are associated with
tropical weather systems during summer or fall (USDC 1966).
REGIONAL GEOLOGIC SETTING
The project area is located within the Texas Coastal Zone, a region characterized by
a continuous series of regional marine embayments separated from the Gulf of Mexico by a system
of barrier islands and barrier peninsulas. These land and water features along the coastline result
from several active, natural geologic processes including longshore drift, beach wash, wind deflation
and deposition, tidal currents, wind-generated waves and currents, delta outbuilding, and river
point-bar and flood deposition. The Texas Coastal Zone is entirely underlain by sedimentary
deposits that originated in ancient, but similar, coastal systems (Brown et al. 1980).
The geologic materials exposed in the Texas Coastal Zone are Quaternary age
sediments consisting of sand, silt, clay, mud, and shell. The youngest Quaternary plain was
deposited during the Holocene Epoch and occurs peripherally to the Gulf of Mexico, only a few
meters above mean sea level. This surface is composed of deltaic and coastal interdeltaic plains.
The latter consist of barrier islands, beach ridges, tidal deltas, bays, lagoons, very shallow neritic
zones offshore, bay and coastal mud flats, and marshes. These interdeltaic plains merge with
narrow alluvial floodplains of the river systems. These floodplains extend inland and occupy
relatively narrow valleys of the rivers. They rise gradually in elevation at rates of less than
0.4 meter (m) per statute mile and are topographically the lowest portions of the Quaternary
plains. Seaward, the youngest plain merges with the continental shelf (Bernard and LcBlanc 1965).
Bay-Estuary-Lagoon System
The Texas coast is characterized by an extensive network of shallow-water bays,
lagoons, and estuaries. These features are relatively low-energy environments protected on the
seaward side by the barrier island system. Water exchange between the bays, estuaries, or bayous
and the Gulf is limited to tidal passes through the barrier islands, and washovers along the island'
system breached during storms (Brown et al. 1980).

ESPEY, HUSTON & ASSOCIATES, INC.

The bay-estuary-lagoon system was formed during the Holocene when the rising sea
level flooded river valleys and delta plains, and offshore shoals coalesced to form the barrier
islands. The South Bay area developed upon the subsiding Rio Grande delta plain. The barrier
island system and the bay-estuary-lagoon system in the region have both shifted progressively
landward, transgressing the relict delta (Morton and Pieper 1975).
Brazos Santiago Pass is a natural outlet for the waters of Laguna Madre, a narrow
lagoon between the mainland of Texas and the barrier islands which parallel much of the coast.
The waters within the lagoon are quite shallow, usually less than 2 m in depth. Outside the pass,
sediment-laden longshore currents combine with the tidal flow into and out of Laguna Madre to
create shifting sandbars. The speed of the tidal flow through the pass is often rapid due to the
volume of water being exchanged between the Gulf of Mexico and Laguna Madre.
Bottom sediments within and adjacent the ship channel are characterized by a thin
layer of sandy silt, usually less than 30 cm, overlaying dense clay. Outside the jetties, the bottom
is covered by a layer of shifting sand several meters thick (Arnold 1978). The sand overlays the
clay substrate typical of the Texas coast.
Winds and Currents
The prevailing wind along this area of the coast of Texas is southerly to southeasterly
with an average velocity of nearly 20 kilometers per hour (kph) (EH&A 1988). A secondary north
wind can develop, generally in association with a winter storm, which is much stronger than the
prevailing southerly winds but short-lived, usually lasting only a few days. These northers are polar
air masses passing down over Canada and the U.S. with wind velocities of 25 to 80 kph (Hayes
1965). The winds form these northers generate wind tides which can inundate the bay sides of
barrier islands and create high-velocity, sediment-laden currents through tidal passes such as Brazos
Santiago.
In addition to the northers, tropical cyclones of varying intensity are common to the
Texas coast. Between 1829 and 1980, the Brownsville area was impacted by at least 29 hurricanes:
9/1829, 8/1831, 9/1834, 9/1835, 9/1837, 1938/ 1840, 8/1844, 10/1848, 1857, 1866, 10/1867, 1872,
8/1880, 10/1880, 9/1885, 9/1886, 9/1887, 6/1902, 8/1909, 9/1910, 10/1912, 8/1916, 9/1919, 7/1933,
8/1933, 8/1945, 9/1967, and 1980.

Similar to the winds, the waters along the coast are dominated by a northerly flowing
current, part of the Loop Current which enters the Gulf of Mexico through the Yucatan Straits
( Curray 1960).

III. HISTORICAL BACKGROUND
HISTORY OF BRAZOS SANTIAGO
This history of Brazos Santiago has been largely adapted from a previous EH&A
publication (Hoyt et al. 1991); however, a substantial amount of new thought and a fair amount
of new research has gone into its preparation. This is especially true regarding the Civil War
period and details concerning the nineteenth-century Brazos Island railroads. The text makes
numerous references to historic letters published previously in Appendix A of Hoyt et al. (1991).
Reproduction of those letters here would make this report unnecessarily lengthy. The original
letters reside in the National Archives in Washington, D.C. The full archival reference to any
particular letter can be found in Appendix A of Hoyt ct al. (1991 ). Photocopies of each letter are
on file at EH&A in Austin, Texas.

Brazos Santiago Pass was first documented by the Spaniard, Alonso Alvarez de Pineda,
in 1519 (Alperin 1977:137). Pineda had been sent on an expedition by Francisco de Garay,
Governor of Jamaica and a companion of Columbus on his second voyage to America. Pineda's
expedition, consisting of four ships, set out to explore and map the lands bordering the Gulf of
Mexico. Some researchers credit him with naming the pass, Brazos de San Iago, meaning the
Arms of Saint James (McKenna 1956:5), although Alperin (1977:137) credits a later explorer,
Diego de Camargo. In either event, the name is one of the few in the area given by the earliest
Spanish explorers to remain virtually unchanged.
Pineda continued southward from Brazos Island and spent 40 days at the mouth of
a large river which he called Rio de las Palmas. Upon Pineda's advice, Garay decided to begin
colonization of the territory at the mouth of this river in 1520. Whether or not this was the Rio
Grande is disputed by historians. Several Spanish maps of the period indicate that the Rio de las
Palmas may have been located south of the Rio Grande. Garay sent Diego de Camargo to the
mouth of the Rio de las Palmas to build a permanent settlement; however, this attempt met with
disaster when the Spanish angered Indians in the area.
Cortez apparently learned of Camargo's settlement when Camargo fled to Vera Cruz.
He referred to the river in a letter to the King of Spain, dated 26 September 1526. "I have a
goodly number of people ready to go to settle at the Rio de las Palmas. I have been informed that
it is good land and that there is a port" (Ferguson 1976:14; Webb 1952:1:274). Cortez never
pursued an exploration of the area, although several others made unsuccessful attempts until about
1535. Political in-fighting, combined with Indian attacks, curtailed further Spanish colonization
efforts in the area for more than 200 years (Zavaleta 1986:131).
Between 1535 and 1746, the lack of established Spanish settlements in the vicinity of
the south Texas coast encouraged French and Anglo interest in the area (Zavaleta 1986:132). The
Spanish, while not maintaining a permanent presence on this part of the coast, nevertheless sought
to ensure that others did not successfully challenge their sovereignty.
Rumors of a Dutch presence at the mouth of the Rio Grande prompted a Spanish
military expedition to the area in 1638 (Stambaugh and Stambaugh 1954:21 and Ruecking 1955:55,
both cited in Gearhart and Moore 1987:II:9). In 1685, Alonso de Leon led another expedition

13473/920031

ESPEY, HUSTON & ASSOCIATES, INC.

through present-day Cameron County in search of the French fort, Fort Saint Louis, located near
Lavaca Bay (Stambaugh and Stambaugh 1954:23 and Webb 1952:I:483, both cited in Gearhart and
Moore 1987:II-9; Banks 1983:11).
The Spanish crown eventually turned its attention to the area it had neglected while
living off the riches of its colonies to the south. On 3 September 1746 the King of Spain,
prompted by renewed fears of intrusion by French colonists from Louisiana and murmurs of Indian
uprisings, appointed Jose de Escandon to undertake the colonization of Nuevo Santander, which
included the Lower Rio Grande Valley (Pierce 1917:17).
In 1747, the newly appointed lieutenant of the viceroy of Seno Mexicano departed on
a survey expedition that would lead him to the Rio Grande. Information gathered from both his
own exploration and that of several other parties under his direction provided for the first
successful colonization in that part of New Spain (Pierce 1917:17).

Escandon left Queretaro (1,050 km south of Brownsville) on 16 November 1748 with.
755 soldiers and 2,515 colonists destined for the northern frontier (Pierce 1917:17). Within eight
years he had established more than 20 towns and 15 missions. The nature and intent of
Escandon's colonization efforts contrasted sharply with the classic Spanish settlement pattern of
mission and fortress. He insisted that the soldiers who accompanied him lay aside their arms, once
the initial safety of the community had been secured, and tum their attention to farming and
ranching (Zavaleta 1986:132).
The northernmost settlements established by Escandon, including Camargo, Dolores,
Mier, Laredo, Revilla and Reynosa (Zavaleta 1986:132), were situated along the Rio Grande.
None of his settlements were located near the modem Texas coast. The closest was Nuestra
Senora de Guadalupe de Reynos (modem Reynosa), located on the south bank of the Rio Grande
about 130 km from its mouth.
Escandon considered the coastal plain to be unsuitable for human habitation. He
believed the delta area was malarial and that settlements situated farther up the river, where the
climate was drier, were healthier. Nevertheless, as early as 1765, a tiny congregation from the
ranches of Reynosa and Camargo had established a village of semi-permanent dwellings closer to
the mouth of the Rio Grande.
First called San Juan de los Esteros Hcrmosos (Saint John of the Beautiful Lakes),
the cluster of lean-tos and jacales (mud and thatch huts) was renamed when missionaries arrived
in 1797 to formalize the community into a mission. The village was then called Congregacion de
Nuestra Senora de! Refugio de Jos Esteros (Congregation of our Lady of Refuge of the Lakes),
and shortened to Refugio (Zavaleta 1986:134). It again would be renamed as Matamoros with the
Mexican War of Independence, to commemorate the martyred priest, Mariano Matamoros (Pierce
1917:20). Despite Escandon's early reservations, other communities sprang up on or near the coast
during this same period.

The Earliest Port at Brazos Santiago
InA Brief History of the Lower Rio Grande Valley, Pierce (1917:143) stated that as early
as 1788 a village was in existence at Brazos de Santiago. The nearby village of Fronton (modem
Port Isabel) had been established during the 1770s (Webb 1952:II:388, cited in Gearhart and
Moore 1987:11:11). Apparently, both Fronton and Brazos Santiago served primarily as summer
resorts prior to 1800. Although Pierce did not state the source of his information, this is the
earliest reference known to the authors for any type of settlement at Brazos Santiago. The date
of earliest settlement on Brazos Island may be problematic; however, one can presume that vessel
traffic in Brazos Santiago Harbor must have increased with the establishment of Fronton on
Laguna Madre in the 1770s, even if this traffic amounted only to fishing vessels.

Brazos Santiago Pass is the only natural deep-water pass allowing ocean-going ships
access to the interior of the south Texas mainland {Clark 1971). The mouth of the Rio Grande
historically was extremely shallow, with shifting sand bars and poor anchorage, but the harbor at
Brazos Santiago, only 12 km north of the mouth, offered convenient anchorage to ocean-going
vessels. Prior to Mexican independence in 1821, however, the pass and harbor of Brazos Santiago
saw only a small amount of shipping.
The harbor was first opened to foreign trade in 1823 when ranchero Martin de Leon
brought luxury merchandise from New Orleans to Brazos Santiago (Alperin 1977:139). In that
same year, the town of Matamoros was granted status as a port of entry by the Mexican
government. With the establishment of a sea port at Brazos Santiago and a port of entry in the
same year at Matamoros on the Rio Grande, a commercial bond was forged between the two
points.
Ships carrying dry goods unloaded their cargo at the wharves of Brazos Santiago where
it was then transported overland to Matamoros. The goods destined for foreign ports were loaded
onto oxcarts or mules in Matamoros for the return trip to Brazos (Alperin 1977:139; Ferguson
1976:35). Brazos Santiago quickly became the principal Mexican port north of Vera Cruz, with
Matamoros serving as the center of commerce.
By 1836, Matamoros had become a thriving center of commerce and boasted an
international community with a number of merchants from France and New England (Ferguson
1976:35). Municipal court records at that time reveal an influx of "foreign" names heretofore
unknown in the predominantly Spanish outposts (Canseco 1981:21). One of those foreigners,
Captain Henry Austin, a cousin of Stephen F. Austin, saw a commercial opportunity in
streamlining the delivery process of goods from Brazos Santiago to Matamoros.
In 1829 Austin brought his steamship Ariel up the Rio Grande to Matamoros. He
planned to carry cargoes, deposited by ocean-going vessels at Brazos Santiago, by steamboat to
Matamoros and other towns along the river, eliminating the arduous and time-consuming overland
conveyance of merchandise from Brazos Island. Austin's steamship hauled merchandise regularly
between Matamoros and Camargo and ventured as far up the river as Mier and Revilla (Horgan
1984:481; Webb 1952:1:67). By 1831, however, he abandoned the project and removed his boat
to the Braws River.

Despite Austin's failure, others later improved upon the scheme and created a very
lucrative riverboat enterprise. Charles Stillman, who later financed Richard King and Mifflin
Kenedy's riverboat company, had already established a mercantile business in Matamoros by
February 1828, a year prior to Austin's experiments with steamboat navigation on the river. It is
not unreasonable to suggest that he may have been inspired by Austin's efforts. "Foreign"
businessmen like Stillman, Kenedy and King would soon play important roles in the economic
development of the Lower Rio Grande Valley.
Apprehension of the growing Anglo-American population of Texas led to the
institution of stricter laws for the Texans in the early 1830s. The Mexican General at Matamoros
recommended sending more ethnic (Mexican) colonists into Texas and increasing the number of
Mexican troops in the area in an attempt to establish a larger Mexican presence (Zavaleta
1986:136). Such recommendations did little except to anger the Texans, and the new laws aimed
at restricting Texan commerce and abolishing slavery were seen by the North Americans as direct
attacks on their livelihoods. It should have come as no surprise when the Texans declared their
independence and went to war against Mexico in 1832.
For the most part, the Texans' fight for independence did not greatly affect life in the
Lower Rio Grande, but several naval encounters of note occurred at Brazos Santiago. In 1835,
an American schooner, Invincible, was confronted by a Mexican sloop-of-war, General Bravo, and
resulted in the death of an American officer. Two years later, a small battle ensued between an
American man-of-war and the Bravo over the detention of two American schooners in Brazos
Santiago harbor (Pierce 1917:22-23). The result of the skirmishes was a demand by Mexico that
ships flying American flags in Texan waters be detained. It was a harbinger of future tensions
between the two nations once Texas gained its independence.
During the spring of 1837, a Texan named Reuben Potter spent from two to three
weeks on Brazos Island. Potter had been a resident of Matamoros for several years prior to that
time. He presumably moved there during the 1820s when immigrants were pouring into Texas.
In 1850 he made a sworn statement to the U.S. government describing the Mexican facilities on
the island during his stay there (quoted in Hoyt et al. 1991:Appendix A, Letter 15).
From Potter's statements it can be concluded that there was a Mexican village on the
north end of Brazos Island in 1837, at the same location as the later U.S. military depot during and
following the U.S. War with Mexico. With the likely exception of brief interruptions due to
hurricanes, it seems likely that Brazos Island was inhabited continuously from 1788 through 1837
when Potter visited the site. Pierce (1917:143) reported a resort village there as early as 1788.
Brazos Santiago was used as a port by at least 1823, when Matamoros became an official port of
entry. From 1829 to 1831, Austin's steamboat Ariel was transhipping merchandise through the
harbor at Brazos Santiago for delivery to and from points along the Rio Grande.
During the "latter portion" of Potter's residence in Matamoros, "the landing of Brazo
de Santiago at the northern end of Brazos Island was a Mexican Military Post." During the
summer of 1836, while Santa Anna was fighting in Texas, the Mexicans built a gun battery at this
post. "The battery was planted on the northern or terminating point of the sand hills which was
then near the Brazo Inlet, and commanded the entrance to the harbor, as well as the village ... The
work consisted of a timber platform on which several guns were mounted with a magazine

contiguous." Potter was of the opinion that this was "intended for a permanent military post when
it was constructed" (Hoyt et al. 1991:Appendix A, Letter 15).
Potter also reported that a "Revenue Station, connected with the Customs House of
Matamoros, had been kept up at Brazo de Santiago and buildings there were at different times
occupied for Revenue purposes ... " The revenue station at Brazos Island was apparently destroyed
by a hurricane in October 1837, only months after Potter's visit to the island (Coast Depot and
Shipping Port 1850:7). Potter did not mention this storm but stated that the military post was
destroyed by "inundation" in 1844. Following the August 1844 hurricane, the Mexican government
ordered its officers to Point Isabel, and Brazos was abandoned (Coast Depot and Shipping Port
1850:7).

In the years between the Texan War oflndependence and the Mexican War, attention
came to be focused on the area between the Nueces River and the Rio Grande. The leaders of
the Republic of Texas sent Texas regulars, militia and the Texas Rangers into the territory below
the Nueces, in part to establish a "buffer zone" between Mexico and the settlers in central Texas
(Zavaleta 1986:138), but also to secure the harbor at Point Isabel (McKenna 1956:10). The
Mexican Government, although it had never acknowledged Texan independence, hoped at least
to establish a boundary at the Nueces River (Zavaleta 1986:138). The southern boundary of Texas
continued to be a point of contention throughout the years of the Republic and was not resolved
until the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo ended the Mexican War (Pierce 1917:155).

Many leaders of the new Republic felt that Texas' best interest would be best served
by petitioning the United States for annexation, and they actively sought that end. When
annexation was effected in December 1845, the Mexican government repudiated the act and
returned the passport to the American charge deaffaires. In fact, Mexico never acknowledged
Texan independence and insisted that the area between the Rio Grande and the Nueces River still
·
remained part of Nuevo Santander (Pierce 1917:22).
In anticipation of hostilities on the Rio Grande, President James Polk ordered
General Zachary Taylor and U.S. troops to Corpus Christi Bay in 1845 (Zavaleta 1986:138).
Mexico broke off diplomatic relations with the United States in January 1846. After six months
at Corpus Christi, General Taylor received a War Department Dispatch on 4 February 1846 which
said, in part, that the general 'ought to take up a position on or near the Rio Grande as soon as
possible" (Nichols 1963:42).

'

Taylor was glad to leave Kinney's Ranch at Corpus Christi, his troops having become
complacent and less than disciplined. He set out on the 180-mile (290-km) journey south on 8
March 1846 with 3,554 men, heading toward his new base at Point Isabel (Nichols 1963:44). Taylor
had chosen Point Isabel for a number of reasons: 1) the nearby port at Brazos Santiago would
facilitate transportation of supplies; 2) it offered a protected site inside of Padre Island; and 3) the
harbor was only nine miles (14.5 km) above the mouth of the Rio Grande. A contemporary source
described the decision and Point Isabel: "Point Isabel, an insignificant post, with a few mean
houses, had been selected as a depot for military stores, being the nearest port to Matamoras [sic]
on the north" (Fry 1848:88).

13473/92003 l

On 24 March 1846, 18 miles (29 km) north of Matamoros, Taylor and his cavalry
broke off from the main army to meet the cutter Woodbury and other boats enroute to Brazos
Santiago with his supplies and munitions. General Worth and the infantry continued toward
Matamoros (Banks 1983:14; Pierce 1917:26-27). As Taylor approached the point, he was met by
a delegation of Mexican citizens who petitioned him not to proceed. During the meeting, flames
and smoke were seen rising from the village of Fronton at Point Isabel.
Taylor immediately broke off the discussion and rushed to Fronton, where fleeing
Mexican residents had set fire to the customs house and other buildings (Nichols 1963:49). Taylor
recalled the event in his first letter from Point Isabel dated 25 March 1846. He said that while he
was reading the letter of protest from the Fronton deputation, "...it was discovered that the village
of Frontone [sic] had been set on fire and abandoned. I viewed this as a direct act of war" (Fry
1848:102). It is noteworthy that the letter's inside address read, for the first time, "Headquarters,
Army of Occupation." Taylor named his encampment at Point Isabel "Fort Polk" after the U.S.
President.
The war with Mexico lasted from March 1846 until February 1848. Both Point Isabel
and Brazos Santiago were utilized by General Taylor and his troops during the war. Fort Polk was
dependent upon the harbor at Brazos Santiago Pass for delivery of supplies. Supplies destined for
Fort Polk first entered the harbor at Brazos Santiago where they were transferred to shallow-draft
vessels and lightered to Point Isabel or to the Rio Grande. The bar outside of Brazos Santiago
Pass would admit vessels drawing up to 7-ln. ft (2.3 m) of water; however, vessels drawing more
than 3-ln. ft (1.1 m) could not reach Point Isabel across the Laguna Madre. The bar across the
mouth of the Rio Grande was generally 4 ft (1.2 m) deep or less.
Taylor was forced to build most of the structures required for war. Existing Mexican
structures were utilized when possible, although the burning of Fronton and the destruction of
buildings on Brazos Island by an 1844 hurricane left little to work with. Thomas Thorpe, one of
Taylor's officers, described the Mexican village of Fronton (Point Isabel) as "composed of grassthatched cottages, made of reeds, or spars of wrecked vessels..." (quoted in Banks 1983:14-15).
Presumably the pre-1844 village at Brazos Santiago had been of similar construction.
Immediately upon the arrival of the detachments of the U.S. troops,
Point Isabel became a place of great business. The few Mexican huts
that were left standing after the fire, were at once occupied; and then
commenced the erection of a variety of rude sheds and dwellings, for the
accomodation (sic] of the "military stores" and the property of the sutlers
who followed the army. The harbor [at Brazos Santiago] was filled with
vessels laden with the stores of the army, and of every possible size, that
could enter it. .. (Thomas Thorpe quoted in Banks 1983:14-15).
Soon after his arrival, Taylor established a supply depot at Brazos Santiago replete with a
"quartermaster's office and store room, a large dwelling, with four rooms and kitchen, small
dwelling with two rooms and kitchen, and stables with ten stalls and four store rooms" (Crimmins
1950:204).

Once work began on the supply depot and base of operations, Taylor left Point Isabel
garrisoned with 450 men, met up with General Worth, and continued toward the Rio Grande. The
army arrived on March 28th at a place across the river from Matamoros and set up camp (Pierce
1917:27; Banks 1983:15). Army Engineer Mansfield immediately began to survey the field, and on
April 4th, construction of a fort began (Nichols 1%3:58). Originally called Fort Taylor, it was later
named Fort Brown in honor of Major Jacob Brown who lost his life defending the position.
As negotiations with Mexico grew more heated, other temporary camps were

established along the Rio Grande between Fort Brown and the mouth of the river (Champion,
n.d.). One of these was Camp Belknap, named for Colonel William Belknap, who first hoisted the
American flag at Fort Brown and later led his brigade in the charge against the Mexican army at
Resaca de la Palma (Webb 1952:1:140). Camp Belknap was located on Loma de la Estrella
between Fort Brown and the mouth of the Rio Grande. When intelligence reached Taylor on
April 19th that two vessels were spotted off the mouth of the Rio Grande, he established another
camp at that entry point to discourage use of the river and to assist in its blockade (Fry 1848:88;
Emory 1857:59).
The supply depot at Brazos Santiago played a crucial role during the Mexican War.
Major Thomas Eastland, Quartermaster for the U.S. Army at Brazos Santiago from 24 March 1847
until 31 October 1848, described U.S. military operations on Brazos Island for that period in great
detail in a summary report to the Quartermaster General, dated 3 February 1849. Several
descriptive excerpts from his report are reproduced below.

This Depot was the great channel through which passed the troops and
supplies for the Army operating on the upper line and from which was
embarked the returning Army, munitions of war, etc. The accumulation
of property [at the depot], therefore, was immense, and its protection a
matter of serious and anxious consideration. My predecessor [Captain
J.M. Still] had commenced erecting suitable warehouses, and I deemed
it my duty to continue until all the stores (subject to injury from
exposure) were safely sheltered. ...houses were built capable of holding
all the stores then exposed on the beach (under cloth covers) or to
arrive. ...Suitable buildings were also erected for officers and soldiers
quarters, mechanics, and others in Government service, and for work
shops, etc.
For giving greater facility to receiving and shipping property, etc. and to
save demurrage ... it became necessary to construct wharves, this was done
in a very cheap manner, by using old vessels, no longer fit for service.
As many as seven vessels could be accomadated [sic] at the same time.

a

JI

lS

A cheap breastwork (of Palmetto logs) was made along the beach in
front of the Public property, which had a good effect in protecting the
shore from the wash of the sea.
The frequent occasion to repair vessels, and the great expense of sending
them abroad for that purpose, made it necessary to establish a ship yard.

12

ESPEY, HUSTON & ASSOCIATES, INC.

A set of ways were built, and all the appertenances [sic.] necessary for
repairing vessels were procured, this was likewise done at the Mouth of
the Rio Grande, there also, were established a machine shop and
foundry, thus giving the means of making almost every repair required
by either steam or sail vessels ...
...Steam vessels were kept at Brazos for towing over the bar and at no
time (unless during very bad weather) was public business suspended for
want of means... Within the time I had charge of this Depot 1155
vessels (brigs, barks, schooners, etc.) were towed in and out of the
harbor... [an average of 2 operations (1 arrival) every day for the 586
days he was in charge].
Among other of my receipts and issues of public property may be named
560,786 bushels oats, 115,940 bushels com, 5,311,714 pounds hay, 86,658
barrels stone coal...
An abundant supply of good water was obtained from the Rio Grande

by the returning wagon trains ...
The business of the Depot at Point Isabel (also under my supervision)
though inconsiderable, was satisfactorily conducted [Major Thomas
Eastland; quoted in Hoyt et al. 1991:Appendix A, Letter 9].
Lt. Webster's 1847 map of Brazos Island (Figure 2) illustrates a half-dozen buildings
clustered at the northwest comer of the island. A wagon road, not visible on this greatly reduced
reproduction, followed the beach to a bridge across Boca Chica, then continued along the beach
to the river. Eastland mentioned the bridge and the mode of transportation between Brazos
Santiago and the mouth of the Rio Grande. A second wagon road led from the Rio Grande depot,
along the north bank of the river, toward Camp Belknap, and then to Matamoros. Webster's map
does not indicate the locations or numbers of wharves built from scuttled vessels, although these
were likely adjacent the buildings.

The shipyard and marine ways do not appear to have been built on Brazos Island until
after Eastland took over as Quartermaster in 1847. The previous Quartermaster, Captain J.M.
Still, apparently lacked these facilities in November of 1846 when he suggested sending the lighter
Monmouth to New Orleans for repairs to her boiler and superstructure (Hoyt et al. 1991:Appendix
A, Letter 2). Still indicated in this same letter that the "General Hospital, clothing and ordnance
depots" were located at Point Isabel rather than on Brazos Island.
As suggested by Eastland's report above, "the accumulation of property ...was
immense." The large quantity of stores deposited at Brazos Santiago included clothing, food, and
ammunition for the soldiers on the northern front of the war, draft animals and wagons for
transporting these supplies to the front, and forage for hundreds upon hundreds of horses and
mules. The distribution of these supplies was accomplished both by lightering cargo from Brazos
Santiago to Point Isabel and to the Rio Grande mouth and by wagon train from all three points.
Captain Still reported on the transportation means available at Brazos Island in a letter to the

184 7 MAP OF BRAZOS ISLAND
AND LOWER RIO GRANDE

ESPEY, HUSTON & ASSOCIATES, INC.

Quartermaster General dated 4 November 1846. The following excerpts from Still's letter convey
the size of this undertaking.
On the 2nd ultimo, I sent to Camargo 125 · Five Mule teams and
wagons. Since which I have sent there 508 wagons and have now on
hand [at Brazos Santiago] about 1242 mostly 4 Horse wagons.
The mules I now have on hand are very small and inferior having been
left after selecting several hundreds to put to wagons out of about 1000.
As soon as I receive those that Col. Hunt is now sending me, I shall
mingle them with those I have and push them forward with wagons. All
the serviceable horses which I have received have been forwarded to the
army. I have now on hand, including what is afloat, 15,683 bushels com,
79,000 bushels oats, and 176,000 lbs hay [Captain J.M. Still 1846; quoted
in Hoyt et al. 1991:Appendix A, Letter l ].
In this same letter, Still listed 22 vessels, including one storeship (the storeship Ursula was not
afloat), that were "on hand". This number included eight steamers, 10 schooners, two sloops and
one bark. All except the storeship were employed for lightering supplies between Brazos Santiago
and either Point Isabel or the mouth of the Rio Grande.

Following the Battle of Resaca de la Palma on 9 May 1846, the front line of the war
moved south into Mexico where the remainder of the war was fought. Having secured the lower
Rio Grande with troops stationed along its northern bank, Taylor directed Major John Saunders,
an army engineer, to obtain steamboats and pilots so that troops and supplies could be ferried to
his next base at Camargo, in preparation for his advance on Monterrey (Vezzetti 1986:77).
Saunders chose Captain Mifflin Kenedy, an experienced riverboat pilot, to head the
operation. Kenedy hired Captain Richard King to assist him. When General Taylor gathered his
forces to pursue the Mexican army into the interior, he and his staff were transported up the Rio
Grande from Fort Brown to Camargo on the steamboat Corvette (Pipkin 1940:81 ). As far as is
known, this was the beginning of continuous steam navigation on the lower Rio Grande and the
first since Henry Austin gave up his similar venture in 1831.
The Post-Mexican War Period
Following the war, the U.S. Army maintained its depot at Brazos Santiago. Soon after
hostilities ended, the army dispersed unnecessary stores, equipment and buildings to other posts.
Major Eastland, Quartem1aster at Brazos Island, reported on 1 September 1848 that he was
"sending to Fort Brown ail the Ware Houses that can be spared and selling off the small houses
at fair prices" (quoted in Hoyt et al. 1991:Appendix A, Letter 6). Several buildings, however,
remained in use at the Brazos Island depot following the war.
On 19 September 1848, a gale struck Brazos Island. In his 24 September 1848 report
of this event, Eastland mentioned several structures remaining on the island.

During the gale the water rose about 13 inches over the land
immediately in front of the wharves, surrounding all the public buildings
and extending back to the sand hills, but no damage (worth mentioning)
was sustained ...
On the sand hills (where the Barracks are situated) there was perfect
safety, even if the water had risen 15 feet. They are about half a mile
from the public landing ... [Thomas Eastland 1848; quoted in Hoyt et al.
1991: Appendix A, Letter 7].
By 8 November 1848, removal of buildings from Brazos Island was still progressing.
Major W.W. Chapman, the new Assistant Quartermaster at Brazos Santiago, reported then that
the marine ways were present and operational (two vessels were under repair at that time). Of
buildings at Brazos Santiago, he reported:
I have nearly removed the quarters and barracks from Mr. Dobbin's land.
The quarters I have sent to Point Isabel for the commanding officer; the
barracks will be sent to Clay Davis' Landing. In the course of ten days
all the Quartermaster's and Commissary stores will be removed into the
large storehouse, and all the buildings removed from that portion of Mr.
Dobbin's land which he requested in his letter to the Hon. Secretary of
War; dated August 1, 1848. That portion of the wharf required by him
is also ready to be turned over to him or his agent ...

...The Norther last Saturday re-opened Boca Chica. It was very severe
and carried away one wharf, and injured all [wharves] more or less.
Some 300 sacks of oats were carried away from one of the platforms
during the gale. The water came up around the Store houses and office
[W.W. Chapman 1848; quoted in Hoyt et al. 1991: Appendix A, Letter

In February 1849, Eastland reported, "Since the War, many of these houses [quarters, work shops,
etc.] have been removed to Fort Brown, leaving however, quite a sufficient number for all
purposes, under the peace establishment, should it be retained as a Depot" (Hoyt et al. 1991:
Appendix A, Letter 9).

Following Eastland's report in February 1849, there seems to have been no further
mention of removing buildings from Brazos Island, although buildings continued to be lost or worn
'dOW!i due to storm damage. Major Chapman reported one such storm in his letter of 28 May

!r,

... a violent storm prevailed here yesterday which caused considerable
damage to public and private property. The fence around the Depot and
the stable were blown down. The "Monmouth" dragged her anchors and
went ashore, but was got off without any damage. Every private vessel
in the harbor went ashore, except a Mexican schooner which sank at her
anchors in 20 or 30 feet of water. ..

...Several private dwellings were blown down. About one half of the
bridge over Boca Chica was carried away. As the expense of repairing
it will be considerable...! would respectfully recommend that the bridge
be taken up and the Palmetto logs sent to Point Isabel [W.W. Chapman
1849; quoted in Hoyt et al. 1991:Appendix: A, Letter 11].
The population of the island, as judged by the number of government employees, appears to have
stabilized by at least the latter part of 1849. In October 1849, the Quartermaster's Department
employed 86 persons, including 23 ship carpenters, 10 carpenters and 5 blacksmiths. By September
of the following year, there were still 60 government employees on Brazos Island. The number
of ship carpenters (20) remained relatively high in late . 1850; however, only three regular
carpenters were employed, indicating that new construction, at least by the U.S. government, had
likely ceased (Hoyt et al. 1991:Appendix: A, Letters 12, 13 and 14).
The post-war decline of Brazos Santiago is also suggested by the deterioration of
government wharf facilities there. Whereas there were multiple wharves reported in the fall of
1848 (Hoyt et al. 1991:Appendix A, Letter 8), Major Chapman stated on 18 May 1850 that his only
wharf boat had "gone to pieces during the recent severe Northers" (Hoyt et al. 1991:Appendix A,
Letter 16). This of course does not exclude the possibility that private wharves were being
maintained, but Chapman made no mention of this. In the same letter, he proposed to scuttle the
hulk of the propeller Colonel Slevens as a new "wharf or rather pier head...The position in which
I wish to place her will greatly protect the depot from the action of the water, and particularly the
coal pile, during Northers."
Just as the Brazos Santiago depot appeared likely to waste away, the economy of the
lower Rio Grande Valley came to its rescue. The war had stabilized the U.S. border at the Rio
Grande and resulted in a permanent American domination on the north side of the river. This
was an attractive market for entrepreneurs who promised to change the focus of economic
endeavor throughout the valley.
The steamboat firm of M. Kenedy and Co. was formed in 1850 and had a virtual
monopoly for the next 20 years on trade between Brazos Santiago and Rio Grande towns such as
Matamoros and Brownsville. Captains Mifflin Kenedy and Richard King, with the financial backing
of longtime local merchant Charles Stillman, purchased the army's sternwheel steamboats after the
war to outfit their venture.
The establishment of political stability in the region also happened to coincide with
the California gold rush. Point Isabel and Brownsville, and undoubtedly Brazos Santiago, grew
busy outfitting men who were headed west along the Rio Grande to seek their fortunes in the gold
fields (McKenna 1956:14). Colonel John S. "Rip" Ford wrote in 1859 that merchandise coming
through Brazos Santiago and on up the Rio Grande amounted to as much as ten million dollars
a year. He added that Morgan Line steamships were at anchor at the Brazos wharf every eight or
ten days and that King and Kenedy had a fleet of steamboats running between Brownsville and
Brazos Santiago (Ford 1963:269).
The following circa 1852 description of Brownsville and Matamoros somewhat
captured the mood of the dawning prosperity:

Gamblers and saloonkeepers from the States swarmed up from Point
Isabel and opened their ships to a rush of custom. Dance halls equipped
with musicians and girls and upstairs rooms, found a large trade ...Sutlers
came with stores of goods, to be sold at sky-high prices ...shipments of ice
arrived, and whiskey juleps could be had at the bars (from Horgan
1984:702-703).

In response to the increased trade and traffic at Brazos Santiago, Congress authorized
an appropriation of $15,000 in 1850 for "a lighthouse and beacon light" to be constructed on the
site of what had been Fort Polk (McKenna 1956:14; Lindsay 1975). The Point Isabel lighthouse
(Light No. 364 of the 9th Lighthouse District) was built in 1852 as a 57-ft brick tower, painted
white. It was refitted in 1857 with a single fixed beacon, flashing at one-minute intervals and
visible for 16 nautical miles.

Another lighthouse was built on the southeast comer of Padre Island in the same year.
The Padre Island Beacon (Light No. 363 of the 9th District) was a fixed light atop a 35-ft wooden
tower and was visible for 10 nautical miles. The light was refitted in 1854 but was still in place in
1858. A lighthouse had also been authorized for the mouth of the Rio Grande by 1858 (U.S.
Light-House Board 1858).
Prelinlinary permission was granted to the Light-House Board in 1859 to place a
beacon atop the cupola of the Quartermaster's warehouse at Brazos Santiago. This permission
apparently was rescinded by General Twiggs of the Department of Texas, fearing that access to the
beacon by means of an outside stairway would render the stores insecure (Hoyt et al. 1991:
Appendix A, Letter 29). The first Brazos Island beacon known to the authors did not appear on
maps until at least 1867, although research has not confirmed the date of its construction. That
beacon had been abandoned by 1879, when an iron tower and beacon was erected slightly offshore
from the southwest comer of Padre Island (Hoyt et al. 1991:25; Pierce 1917:143).
A military presence was maintained at Brazos Santiago Depot throughout the 1850s.
However, Fort Polk was abandoned in 1850 and a number of its buildings moved to other, nearby
forts (Banks 1983:23). Several military inspections and government surveys of Brazos Island and
its harbor were conducted during this period, presumably in response to economic growth in the
region and to the increasing importance of Brazos Santiago. One such survey was made by
Lieutenant George McClellan, U.S. Army Engineer, during the winter of 1852-53. McClellan's
report, dated 18 April 1853, characterized the Brazos Santiago bar as "probably the roughest on
the coast of Texas." Regarding all of the Texas coast harbor bars, he says:

:w

They are all of a quicksand formation, hard as rock to the touch of the
sounding pole, but acted upon with extraordinary facility by the water.

On some of them, especially the Brazos Santiago Bar, it is impossible to
maintain buoys for any length of time in the same position, their anchors
soon working their way through the sand, & dragging them down.

It is difficult to imagine anything more changeable than are all these
bars. The channels over them are, literally, constantly shifting, & cannot

be depended on from day to day [McClellan 1853; quoted in Hoyt et al.
1991: Appendix A, Letter 19].
McClellan advised against any attempt to improve the bar at Brazos Santiago, believing that any
such improvement would be very temporary (Hoyt et al. 199l:Appendix A, Letter 21).
Another inspection of Brazos Island was performed in compliance with the Treaty of
Guadalupe Hidalgo, in which the United States agreed to maintain border posts to help prevent
marauding Indians from invading Mexico (Crimmins 1948:54). W.G. Freeman's 1853 inspection
report shows that he did not actually visit Brazos Santiago Depot:
Captain Van Vliet at Fort Brown, told me there was nothing to be seen
there except the buildings, and I obtained from him all the information
concerning it that will probably be deemed essential.
The depot, a rough sketch (See Map [whereabouts unknown]) of which
and of the adjacent country accompanies this report, is on the island of
Brazos Santiago, nine miles from the mouth of the Rio Grande and
thirty miles in an easterly direction, from Fort Brown. It is approached
by the channel around the north end of the island, which at full tides has
a depth of eight feet. Vessels drawing 7 1/2 feet can cross the bar at
certain stages of water, but none of more than 6 1/2 feet draft should be
freighted by the government. The mail is received semi-monthly by
steamer from New Orleans. Fort Brown and Ringgold Barracks are the
only [military] posts that receive supplies through the Brazos. The stores
are transported by contract--a steamer running from the depot to Fort
Brown, in connection with one from that post to Ringgold Barracks.
This contract was entered into by Bvt. Maj. Chapman, Asst.
Quartermaster, with M. Kennedy [sic] & Co., for two years from
February 10, 1852 [see also Hoyt et al. 1991: Appendix A, Letter 22].
The rates paid (which will be given hereafter [see Hoyt et al. 1991:
Appendix A, Letter 23]) seem to me high, but they were doubtless the
most advantageous that could be obtained at the time.
Three citizens are employed, a clerk at $75 per month, a boatman at $30,
and a labourer to take care of horses, assist with boats, etc., at $15. The
Government does not own the land on which the depot stands. A guard
of one corporal and two privates is detached from Fort Brown for the
protection of the depot buildings [quoted in Crimmins 1948:100-101].
The point made by Freeman, that the government did not own the depot land, is a
minor one that seems to have been referred to as early as November 1848 by Major Chapman
(Hoyt et al. 199l:Appendix A, Letter 8). Chapman referred several times to a Mr. Dobbins who
claimed title to the depot property. Two years later, the case of ownership went to District Court
in Cameron County.

In November of 1851, Leonard Dobbin had filed suit against the U.S., claiming title
to depot property. At the same time a William Patterson had filed an intervention against both
the government and Leonard Dobbin. The attorneys representing both private parties dropped
their cases without taking the issue to trial, and the issue of ownership seemed to be resolved in
favor of ilie U.S. government (Hoyt et al. 1991:Appendix A, Letters 17 and 18). Although another
claimant to the land may have come forward by 1853, it would appear that Freeman was in error.

One year after Freeman's second-hand report regarding Brazos Santiago, the U.S.
Coast Survey mapped the topography of Brazos Island in detail. The original of this 1854 map was
photographed by EH&A at the National Ocean Service's hydrographic archives in Maryland. The
Brazos Island portion is reproduced in Figure 3. At least 50 structures are indicated on Brazos
Island, in addition to six on Clark Island and iliree on Padre Island. The number of structures on
Brazos Island may have been considerably higher at the end of the war, considering that a number
were removed to Point Isabel and to Fort Brown.
Two wharves show clearly at the northwest corner of Brazos Island (Figure 3). The
configuration of the westernmost wharf indicates that it may be a wharfboat connected to the island
by a pier. If true, this may be the position of the Colonel Stevens which Major Chapman had
proposed to scuttle adjacent the depot as a wharfboat "pier head" in 1850 (Hoyt et al. 1991:
Appendix A, Letter 16). A letter dated 18 November 1854 from Captain Stewart Van Vliet at Fort
Brown described the destruction of a wharf at Brazos Santiago Depot.
·
Ten days ago [November 8th] a heavy N.E. gale carried away nearly all
the piles which supported the wharf and it is now necessary that it should
be entirely rebuilt. From the fact that wooden piles cannot be driven in
the quick sand of the Brazos, I would recommend that the iron screw
pile should be used instead unless the expense should forbid it...
The water has encroached upon one of the storehouses and a row of
piles will have to be run in front of it to prevent its being overthrown
[sic?]. These however can be of wood and worked in by hand [Van Vliet
1854; quoted in Hoyt et al. 1991: Appendix A, Letter 24; see also Letter

25].
From subsequent descriptions (below), it would appear that the wharf carried away
in November 1854 was the westernmost of the wharves illustrated by the U.S. Coast Survey in that
same year (Figure 3). This wharf had not been replaced as of 24 January 1855. Van Vliet
reported in a letter of that date:
I have received through Col. AC. Myers AQ.M. your [Major General
T.S. Jesup's, U.S. Quartermaster General] instructions with regard to the
wharf at this place. There can be obtained here an abundance of
Palmetto logs for its repair but I most respectfully suggest that iron piles
would be superior in every respect...Before commencing these repairs I
have thought it proper to state the objections to the wooden piles &
suggest a substitute ...

Should I be relieved from duty here before commencing this work which
I presume will be the case .. .I can turn over whatever instructions you
may send me to my successor (Van Vliet 1855; quoted in Hoyt et al.
1991:Appendix A, Letter 26).
It seems unlikely, given the instructions of the U.S. Quartermaster General, implied in Van Vliet's
January 1855 letter, that the wharf was rebuilt using anything but locally available Palmetto logs
for pilings.

A faint line extending southeastward from the wharf area in Figure 3, and then
westward to the shore of Brazos Island, is believed to be a fence surrounding the government
depot. All structures located outside of this fenced area, constituting the majority of buildings on
the island, are presumed to have been privately owned.
In 1856, Colonel Joseph Mansfield visited Brazos Santiago Depot. His inspection
report included a sketch of the buildings enclosed within the fenced depot compound (Figure 4).
Mansfield wrote:

The Depot of Brazos Santiago is a good one and accessible to vessels
from all parts of the U. States, being at the entrance to the bay at Point
Isabell [sic], and nine miles along shore from the mouth of the Rio
Grande; and steamers pass out of that river and take in their loads for
the supply of the posts on that river without difficulty. It is 35 miles by
land from fort [sic] Brown. This depot is indispensable and in connexion
[sic] with that at Indianola will answer all the demands of the Service
[quoted in Crimmins 1939:130].
The exact date of the Figure ·AA sketch is unknown; however, given that Mansfield conducted his
visit in 1856, and knowing that a "new wharf' was constructed at the depot some time after January
1855, suggests a date no earlier than February 1855. A comparison of figures 3 and 4 confirms the
location of the fenced government depot area in Figure 3 and identifies the western wharf in
Figure 3 as the one destroyed by a gale on 8 November 1854.
In March 1857, the Assistant Quartermaster at Fort Brown submitted a requisition for

materials needed to make repairs at Brazos Santiago Depot. This requisition (Hoyt et al. 1991:
Appendix A, Letter 28) provides many specific construction details regarding the government
buildings illustrated at the depot in figures 3 and 4. Among the buildings identified in the
requisition are: a stable, measuring 75 x 35 ft; a two-story building used for office and store rooms,
measuring 70 x 30 ft; a storehouse, measuring 120 x 70 ft; a set of quarters having four rooms; and
a platform and small storehouses in front of the large storehouse. The quarters were surrounded
by a 7-ft high, 480-ft-long fence (see faint inner depot fence in Figure 3). The perimeter of the
depot was marked by a 10-ft-high, 1500-ft-long fence. All of the depot buildings and fences were
whitewashed with lime; the window shutters, etc. on the quarters were to be painted "Paris green";
and the doors and shutters on the storehouses, office and boats were to be painted "Chrome
green".

Apparently, there was some discussion at this time between the U.S. Quartermaster
General and Colonel AS. Johnston, commanding the Department of Texas, "as to the importance,
at present, of Brasos [sic] Santiago for a depot..." (Hoyt et al. 1991:Appendix A, Letter 27).
Colonel Johnston had, therefore, deferred the decision regarding the above requisition to Major
General Jesup, U.S. Quartermaster General. The repairs presumably were made and the buildings
given a fresh coat of paint, as the depot remained under Government operation until at least 1860.
In February 1859 the U.S. Army posts at Fort Brown, Ringgold Barracks and Fort
Mcintosh were abandoned. Government property stored at those places was transferred to the
Quartermaster's warehouse at Brazos Santiago for storage (Hoyt et al. 1991:Appendix A, Letter
29). This fact gave a renewed importance to the depot; however, this was only a temporary state
of affairs. On 22 April 1860, a new requisition was submitted for funds to repair the public
buildings and fences at Brazos Santiago (Hoyt et al. 1991:Appendix A, Letter 32). In the letter
accompanying his requisition, Lieutenant AC. Gillem wrote:

... it will be observed that the greater part of the estimate is for enclosing
the grounds with a good fence. ... should Brazos ever be required as a
large Depot it would be true economy to enclose the ground as marked
in the plan, as there is a person signing himself 'John V. Singer, agent
for Johana [sic] Shaw' who lays claim to the entire island, Depot
included, and should the fence not be made I think it more than
probable that he or some person holding under him will endeavor to
build so near the Depot buildings as to make it necessary either to rent
from them or enter a suit to remove them, which in either case cost
much more than the $490.90 required. Whilst I was at the Brazos,
Singer or some person acting for him surveyed the island, Government
property included" [AC. Gillem 1860; quoted in Hoyt et al. 1991:
Appendix A, Letter 32].
That Singer and his associates were indeed planning major development of both Brazos and Padre
islands is attested by his advertisements in local newspapers (see Hoyt et al. 1991:Appendix A,
Letters 30 and 31 ).
Upon receiving the latest requisition for repairs to Brazos Santiago Depot, the Chief
Quartermaster for the Department of Texas, Major D.H. Vinton, replied on May 18th:
Before any action can be taken in respect to your suggestions I desire
that you will report without delay whether the improvements in question
are absolutely necessary ... or is it not better to dispense with the
depot...altogether [D.H. Vinton 1860; quoted in Hoyt et al. 1991:
Appendix A, Letter 33].
Gillem replied from Fort Brown on May 28th:
... The method of transportation by wagons would be supposing a good
wharf at Brazos... I have been told that at times the Boca Chica is so
shallow as to admit of wagons passing it [there was no bridge at the

13473/920031

ESPEY, HUSTON & ASSOCIATES, INC.

time]. I have crossed it three times and after careful examination have
never found it to be less than 7 feet deep... When there was a wharf at
Brazos, vessels ... sometimes landed such stores at Brazos as were not
liable to injury from becoming wet, lumber for instance. The insurance
offices will not insure property to be landed at Brazos en route for this
place because Brazos Island is subject to over flow and much property
has thus been lost ... I am convinced that the occupation of Brazos as a
Depot is not at all necessary, believing the present method of
transporting stores more economical than by landing them at Brazos and
transporting them thence to this place by wagons (Alvan C. Gillem 1860;
quoted in Hoyt et al. 1991:Appendix A, Letter 34).
It is apparent from Gillem's reply that there was no wharf, or at least no serviceable wharf, at
Brazos Santiago Depot in May 1860. This suggests that no wharves had been built since 1855, the
approximate date of the 'new wharf' shown in Figure 4. Also there was no bridge over Boca Chica
proper in May of 1860, although there was a bridge in disrepair over 'a small bayou or laguna"
about "two hundred and fifty yards on this side [toward Brownsville] of the Boca Chica.'

The Civil War
Prior to the outbreak of the Civil War, the citizens of Cameron County voted, along
with the majority of Texans, to secede from the Union and join the Confederacy. On 22 February
1861, E.B. Nichols, Commissioner for Texas, arrived at Fort Brown to request of the commander
in charge, Captain B.H. Hill, that those of his command not willing to join the Confederate cause
should leave the fort and the state immediately, surrendering their equipment and supplies. The
orders applied to all United States troops in Texas.
Captain Hill at first seemed determined to fight, but upon orders from General David
E. Twigg, he yielded his troops. He refused, however, to deliver the supplies and ordnance, some
of which were burned at Brazos Santiago (Pierce 1917:39; Ford 1963:319-320). All the Texan
border garrisons below El Paso were evacuated by M. Kenedy & Co. steamboats on the Rio
Grande (Ford 1963:319), and Major Fitz John Porter, Assistant Adjutant General, sailed from New
York on the steamer Daniel Webster to collect the U.S. troops at Brazos Santiago (Pierce 1917:39).
By 20 March 1861, all the Federal troops and officers were withdrawn from Brazos
Santiago. Texas Volunteers immediately manned the abandoned posts along the Rio Grande and
at Brazos Santiago with Colonel P.N. Luckett and Colonel John S. 'Rip' Ford commanding until
the arrival of General H.P. Bee on 29 January 1863 (Pierce 1917:41; Ford 1963:319).
Fort Polk had been abandoned soon after the Mexican War, but Fort Brown,
temporarily vacated in the late 1850s, had been re-garrisoned in 1859. The U.S. supply depot on
Brazos Island had been in continual use since Taylor established it in 1846, with the possible
exception of a brief period following May 1860. When the Federal troops withdrew from the
island, 1500 Texas Volunteers immediately took their place at Brazos Santiago Depot (Ford
1963:319).

ESPEY, HUSTON & ASSOCIATES, INC.

The Confederates controlled the strategic economic and military centers of the Rio
Grande and the southern Gulf Coast, including Brazos Island, with little interference until late in
1863. This situation changed on 1 November 1863 when Union forces under the command of
Major General Nathaniel P. Banks anchored off the bar at Brazos Santiago. The next day, his
6,998 men came ashore on the island and marched south across Boca Chica toward Brownsville
(Pierce 1917:42-43; Banks 1983:30).
The Confederates evacuated the island without a contest prior to the Union landing.
Colonel "Rip" Ford justified the Confederate retreat in a report to Texas Governor Clark.
It was the opinion of all that Brazos Santiago is not defensible, that the
post should be abandoned for the present, and that we concentrate and
make a stand at this point (Fort Brown]. Captain [Stephen] Powers, who
was here on business, left at midnight, accompanied by Mr. Lawton of
the Engineer Department. To the captain was assigned the task of
superintending the withdrawal of men, ordnance, and supplies of every
kind from Brazos Island, and their transportation to this post by
steamboats and waggons [sic].

It may not be amiss to say, that there is no water on Brazos Island, save
beach water of an unhealthy character--there are no rations--it is
isolated ... There are no guns of long range on the island. A war vessel
could shell a force out of Brazos Island without ever coming within reach
of any gun we have there. One revenue cutter could make the place
utterly useless to us (Ford 1963:326-327; quoted in Banks 1983:30).

The Union landing scene was depicted in Harper's Weekly magazine (Figure 5) on 28
November 1863 along with the following description of Brazos Island, submitted by the New York
Herald's eyewitness war correspondent.
Brazos, as well as all the islands along the Texan Coast, is a sandy desert.
One house (deserted) stands to our right, and a mile or so farther
toward the interior are two lighthouses, one on each side.

The foundation of the buildings used by General Taylor for stores can
yet be seen; but no other vestige remains [Harper's Weekly, 28 November
1863].
A Union map of Brazos Island (Figure 6), drawn sometime between 2 November and 31
December 1863, agrees well with the Harper's Weekly description. The map shows two "houses,"
a "chimney" at the "original site of U.S. Gov't work shops," and a "new fort." The new fort is
believed to be of Union origin, although the Confederates may have started these works.

The 19th Iowa Infantry was among the first Union regiments to set foot on Brazos
Island. One soldier of this regiment, Benjamin Mcintyre, kept a detailed diary of his nine-month
stay in the lower Rio Grande Valley. Mcintyre arrived on Brazos Island on 2 November 1863, two
months before General Herron's arrival, and left via the same route on 4 August 1864. Mcintyre's
description of Brazos Island upon his arrival is remarkably similar to that of the New York Herald
correspondent.
Brazos as well as the islands along the Texan Coast is a sandy desert, a
house or two standing deserted. A mile or two interior are two
lighthouses 1 -- charred ruins of three dwellings show plainly they have
been burned but a few days -- nothing but the chimneys remain standing.
The foundation of the buildings used by Gen. Taylor for stores can yet
be seen2 but no other vestige remains [Mcintyre 1959:250].
It seems that the New York Herald correspondent plagiarized Mcintyre's diary, making a few
minor changes based upon his own observations. Mcintyre later hinted that he knew the Herald
correspondent. Perturbed about the 13th Maine Volunteers' entry into Brownsville ahead of the
19th Iowa Infantry, Mcintyre commented, "I only hope the correspondent of the NY Herald is with
them and he may write back something flattering to Yankee troops" (Mcintyre 1959:255).

Mcintyre and the 19th Iowa Infantry marched to Brownsville by way of Boca Chica
where they camped for a few days. Their path from Brazos Santiago to Boca Chica, described
below, follows the same route soon after taken by Herron's railroad.
In leaving the landing place we followed the sandy beach several miles ...
The beach from the constant beating of the surf is smooth and hard and
a horse in passing over it would scarce mark it with a footprint. At Boca
Chica a pontoon bridge has been put in operation. It is composed of
two long huge india rubber bladders on which cross timbers are placed
for a foundation on which the bridge is made and is capable of carrying
an immense load ... (Mcintyre 1959:253-254).
When word of the Union landing on Brazos Island reached the Confederates in
Brownsville on November 2nd, General Bee made hasty preparations to evacuate Fort Brown. On
the afternoon of November 3rd, Bee ordered all government buildings to be burned along with
more than 200 bales of unshipped cotton. He then marched his army north to Santa Gertrudis
(Kingsville). The fire quickly spread and destroyed an entire city block before reaching a
warehouse holding 8,000 pounds of gunpowder. The explosion shook the area, adding to the chaos

Mcintyre presumably was referring to the Point Isabel and Padre Island lights, both built in 1852.
The earliest lighthouse known by the authors on Brazos Island appears on a map dating from 23 January
1866. That light was located near the beach, however, rather than on the "interior" of the island.
2The foundations observed by Mcintyre and others may indeed have dated from the 1840s; however,
the U.S. government maintained a continuous presence on the island from 1846 up to the beginning of
the Civil War.

marched into Brownsville three days later, they found Fort Brown destroyed and part of the town
heavily damaged (Banks 1983:34).

General Herron took command of the Union forces at Brownsville on 3 January 1864
and remained in this capacity until 12 July 1864. During the period of his stay, Herron was
responsible for building the first railroad in the lower Rio Grande Valley. Tom Lea, in his history
The King Ranch, stated that General Herron, while stationed at Brownsville, was "... busy mostly
with building a narrow gauge railroad bed and laying rails from the dock at Brazos Santiago to
White Ranch on the river, hoping to ease the thorny problem of transport for supplying his
garrison... " (Lea 1957:226). A portion of Herron's railroad is believed to have been recently
discovered on Brazos Island by EH&A archaeologists; therefore, considerable space is given to
describing Herron's stay in the valley.

On January 15th, Herron remarked about the "new fort" on Brazos Island in a letter
to Brigadier General Charles P. Stone. "The work on Brazos I have not yet seen, but understand
that it is a strong work, facing the sea, and mounting two heavy guns" (U.S. Secretary of War,
Series I, 46(2):85).

In late January, Herron wrote another letter to Stone, making specific
recommendations regarding Brazos Island and Point Isabel:

After three weeks' trial, I am satisfied that our line of communication via
Point Isabel is not the correct one under existing circumstances ...

What I propose to do is to build a wharf at Brazos Island and establish
the depots there, bridge Boca Chica, and transport all supplies by wagons
along the beach to the mouth of the Rio Grande, and shipping there on
river boats for Brownsville. It is 9 miles from the wharf at Brazos Island
to the mouth of the river, the road along the beach hard and in fine
condition. For a few days each month this road may be impassable, but
I propose to construct another road inside of the sand hills that will be
protected in all weather. By this route we shall have but 9 miles of land
transportation and can unload much more rapidly than by the present
way [U.S. Secretary of War, Series I, 34(2):166-167; quoted in Banks
1983:232].
n's proposal was approved on February 2nd. On this same day Mcintyre reported, "Quite
_mber of the Pioneer Corps have left [Brownsville] for Point Isabel [sic.?; they may have been
g for Brazos Island] for the purpose of erecting government warehouses" (1959:299).
On the evening of February 9th, Major General E.O.C. Ord, commanding the 13th
,,Corps, arrived at Brownsville for a review of Herron's troops scheduled for the following
Intyre 1959:302). Following his inspection tour in Brownsville, Ord visited Brazos Santiago
days. While Ord was on Brazos Island, he and Herron exchanged several letters (see
;i·etary of War, Series I, 34(2):295-298, 309-310 and 402-403).

Herron wrote to Ord3 on 11 February 1864, that the only good harbor for 241 km
on either side of the Rio Grande was that at Brazos Island. He discussed the system of ferrying
goods from Brazos to Point Isabel and then overland to Brownsville.
This will soon be changed and a new rouie opened along Brazos Island,
crossing Boca Chica, thence to the mouth of the river, where goods will
be reshipped on steamboats for Brownsville. The new route will have
many advantages over the old, in being entirely safe from guerrilla
parties and reducing land travel from 30 miles to 9 (U.S. Secretary of
War, Series I, 34(2):296-297].
In this same letter, Herron stated that two regiments of colored troops were stationed at Point
Isabel and on Brazos Island, totalling 632 Negro soldiers.
During the month of February 1864, Lt. Colonel Arthur F. Wrotnouski mapped the
"Environs of Brazos Island" (Figure 7) showing camps of the 16th Infantry, Corps d'Afrique and
the 1st Regiment of Engineers, Corps d'Afrique. Wrotnouski's map also showed Herron's newly
completed wharf and storehouse. The post headquarters shown may have utilized one of the
"houses" present when Union troops first landed (Figure 6).
Notably, there is no railroad indicated on Wrotnouski's map, suggesting that the work
had not commenced. Wrotnouski probably helped supervise its construction, since by June 30th
he was commanding the 95th U.S. Infantry on Brazos Island, one of Colonel Hodge's colored
brigades 4 •
By March of 1864, some additional progress had apparently been made to the "works"
on Brazos Island, specifically at Boca Chica. Mcintyre stated on March 3rd that "Maj. Gen.
Herron is off on a tour of inspection of government works at Boca Chica and Point Isabel"
(1959:309). The nature of these works was not specified by Mcintyre. It is possible that work had
begun on Herron's railroad by this date. It is more likely, however, that Herron was inspecting
a small fortification constructed on the south end of Brazos Island for the defense of Boca Chica.
On 4 April 1864, Major General McClemand, commander of the U.S. 13th Army in
Texas, reviewed the Union troops in Brownsville (Mcintyre 1959:322), staying until April 7th.
McClemand's visit included an inspection of Brazos Island. On April 11th, McClemand wrote
from Pass Cavallo, Texas to Lt. Colonel Richard B. Irwin, Assistant Adjutant General, Department
of the Gulf:
Colonel Hodge is now throwing a bridge across Boca Chica which, when
completed, will much facilitate communication between the island and

colored brigades as of 30 June 1864.

Brownsville. The projected railroad between the island and Hall's ranch,
on the Rio Grande, would still more facilitate it, and I think should be
early completed [U.S. Secretary of War, Series I, 34(2):130].
It is unclear from McClernand's letter whether Herron's railroad was under
McClernand's letter sounds like a
consideration or whether construction had begun.
recommendation for building the "projected" railroad. On April 15th, Herron left Brownsville for
"the Point" 5 and was believed bound for New Orleans (Mcintyre 1959:329). The timing of
Herron's trip suggests he may have gone to champion the cause of his railroad.

On May 25th Mcintyre wrote in his diary, 'The Telegraph line from the Point 6 to this
place [Fort Brown] is now complete. The RR commenced some months ago is still progressing"
(Mcintyre 1959:342). From Mcintyre's statement, it is certain that the railroad was under
construction by the end of May, although it remains uncertain as to when construction began.
Construction of buildings and/or defensive works on Brazos Island apparently
continued through the month of June. Before the Union troops evacuated Pass Cavallo, Texas on
June 15th, Colonel George Bailey "... shipped most of the valuable lumber, by request of MajorGeneral Herron, to Brazos, and a condensing apparatus ... " (U.S. Secretary of War, Series I; George
Bailey writing to Major George B. Drake from Kennersville, La., June 22, 1864; complete
reference unknown).
General Herron left Fort Brown on July 14th along with most of the Union troops.
Mcintyre wrote in his diary on that day, "I understand a fort is to be made at Brazos where a
certain portion of our troops will remain after the evacuation of Brownsville" (Mcintyre 1959:372).
On 28 July 1864, the remaining Union forces, including Mcintyre, abandoned Fort
Brown and marched toward Brazos Island. Mcintyre camped at White Ranch, the southern
terminus of Herron's railroad, from July 29th through August 2nd. During his stay there, he made
no comments about the railroad. From Mcintyre's observations, one might gather that the Union
troops left little behind that would be useful to the Confederates:
I know not from what this place derives its name - if however a little
white house the size of a hen coop is a white house and patches of
cactus and chapperal (sic.] on a barren sandy plain is a ranch this place
must be rightly named (Mcintyre 1959:380].

Mcintyre departed White Ranch on August 3rd.

Mcintyre wrote on 28 June 1864, ''The telegraph leading to Brazos was cut last night" (1959:361).
Either there were separate telegraph lines leading to Point Isabel and to Brazos Santiago, or Mcintyre
referred to Brazos Santiago as "the Point."

Left White Ranch about 11 a.m. today and after a ten mile march
bivouaced [sic.] on almost the same spot [Brazos Santiago] on which we
landed nine months ago. Our march today was over a vast pampas of
Sand with but an occasional clump of chapperal [sic.] of cactus or a
stately palm tree to break the dull sameness of the scene except where
the narrow Rio Grande was confined in its narrow bed at its mouth ...
Opposite Bagdad on the Texas side was Clarksville a small place of no
importance. The buildings have been for the most part taken down and
removed to Brazos - A railroad leading from Brazos and completed for
several miles - the iron laid the entire length of the Island. The Boca
Chica had been bridged by means of piling placed across the channel and
filled between with sand, forming a solid conexion [sic] of the Island with
the mainland thus saving time and expense of men, pontoon bridges or
boats ... The east [sic., north] end of the [Brazos] Island is pretty well
covered with houses for government use and presents quite a citylike
appearance & is a busy mart. I saw here for the first time a Steam
condenser [from Pass Cavallo] which transforms salt water into fresh and
it is a very good article [Mcintyre 1959:386].
Colonel John "Rip" Ford of the Confederate army described Brazos Island after Union
troops had abandoned Fort Brown:
The Federals had works at the end of Brazos Island next to the Rio
Grande. During their occupation of the Brownsville area they had
transported some large pieces of artillery from Fort Brown to the island.
They had erected a railroad from the island to the White House, or
White Ranch as some chose to call it. The cars had ceased to run when
we reached Fort Brown. A bridge had been built over the Boca Chica,
but had been washed away. Just outside the Boca Chica, on the Gulf
side, was a sand bar which at ordinary tide was fordable. It was
immediately under the guns of the fort 7 and therefore passage over it
to the island was rather perilous. The larger fort was not far from the
port, and could be reached by artillery from the blockader [Ford
1963:368; quoted in Banks 1983:35].
Ford reported the railroad bridge across Boca Chica as "washed away;" however, the
"ng excerpt, from a post-war letter by Charles A Whitney & Co., suggests that it was
tionallydestroyed during the withdrawal of Union troops from Brownsville to Brazos Santiago.

entioned this fort again later in the year: "A little after the middle of November, 1864, an
'.'de to attack a fort situated at the end of Brazos Island, where the Boca Chica leaves the
co. It had been ascertained by the Confederates that it required a full hour for troops to
·near the port to the small fort. By crossing the Boca Chica from the main land side, some
the fort, and attacking that work from the island side, or in the rear, it was the opinion it
ce~ before it could be reached by reinforcements" (Ford's typescript memoirs, Vol. VI:1118;
History Center, Austin).

... during the recent war...the Boca Chica was closed by a dam thrown
across same by the United States troops, for use as a bridge, and which
they afterwards destroyed to prevent an attack from the Confederates
[Charles A Whitney & Co., 14 Oct. 1868; quoted in Hoyt et al. 1991:
Appendix A, Letter 47].
Mcintyre did not mention that the bridge had been destroyed when he crossed Boca
Chica on August 3rd. The bridge presumably was not destroyed until sometime after the 3rd,
when the last Union troops had crossed to the island. Once the Union had evacuated Brownsville,
there was no strategic value in maintaining a railroad, or bridge, that led in that direction. The
bridge witnessed by Ford and Mcintyre and the "dam" used as a bridge by Union troops and then
destroyed must be one and the same.
It is unclear when or ifHerron's railroad became operational. The historian Tom Lea
wrote: "After rolling up its unused railroad and stacking its rails, a reduced Union garrison, no
longer commanded by Herron, dug in at Brazos Island .. ." (Lea 1957:230). Lea did not cite his
source.

While it is possible that the rails were taken up and stacked, as Lea suggested, it is
certain that the rails were in place north of Boca Chica when the final Union troops left the
mainland in early August. Mcintyre described 'A railroad leading from Brazos and completed for
several miles - the iron laid the entire length of the Island" (1959:386).
"Rip" Ford, who no doubt was well-informed regarding enemy activities on the lower
Rio Grande, stated specifically that the Union "... had erected a railroad from the island to the
White House, or White Ranch... The cars had ceased to run when we reached Fort Brown" (Ford
1963:368; quoted in Banks 1983:35). Ford's wording implies that cars had been running between
Brazos Island and White Ranch. If this is true, there must have been a steam locomotive and a
few rail cars operating on the island prior to the Union evacuation in July of 1864. Presumably,
the railroad would have been used to transport artillery and other heavy items from Fort Brown
to Brazos Santiago during the Union withdrawal.
Mcintyre marched to Boca Chica from Clarksville, presumably traveling along the
beach. If so, he may not have known whether the railroad continued to White Ranch. Still, he
camped at White Ranch for five nights without so much as mentioning a railroad. Perhaps the
rails between White Ranch and Boca Chica had been removed to Brazos Island, after the Union
withdrawal began on July 14th. This would keep the rails from falling into Confederate hands,
while possibly giving Mcintyre the impression that the railroad had not been completed.
When Fort Brown was evacuated, 1500 Union troops were stationed at Brazos
Santiago under the command of Colonel H.M. Day (Banks 1983:34-35). Day had replaced Justin
Hodge sometime after June 30th. Mcintyre had departed Brazos Santiago by steamer on August
4th.

Captain P.C. Hains, Acting Chief Engineer, Department of the Gulf, explained the requirements
for this fort in a letter to Brigadier General R. Delafield, Chief Engineer of the U.S. Army.
I am instructed ... to have constructed on Brazos Island Texas a field
work capable of garrisoning about fifteen hundred (1500) men. The plan
of the work as enclosed will develop about (1000) one thousand yards of
interior crest and will require much lumber in the construction, on
account of the peculiar character of the soil, or rather sand, for the
island is only a sand bar in reality. The accompanying diagram is a cross

On October 15th work was reported as "begun but no report has been received yet
as to the progress made" (quoted in Hoyt et al. 1991:Appendix A, Letter 36). On December 2nd,
Brigadier General William A Pile commented on the situation at Brazos Santiago in a letter to

Hains' estimate of two months to complete the Brazos Island fortification proved to
be insufficient. Nevertheless, by the end of December 1864, much of the work had been
completed. Hains ordered a map of Brazos Island to be drawn in January 1865 (Figure 8). In his
January 20th report of operations for December 1864 he stated:

constructed in Redoubt B in rear of the left flank is 13' long, 8 wide &

magazine is constructed of Rail Road ties 8" in thickness, the side walls
& roof are calked [sic.] & covered with over one foot· of clay well
rammed & six feet of sand on top. The end opposite the parapet is
protected by seven feet of sand revetted with sand bags. The parade of
Redoubt B is raised 18' above the levee outside, & the ground under the
magazine 4' more in order to secure it from moisture. The covering of
the magazine will answer for a traverse for the guns on the left face, &
shoulder angle. One ventilator has been completed, another begun. The
magazine at the channel battery is 18' long, 9' wide, & 6' high. This may
need considerable repair as the sand covering has nearly all blown away
[P.C. Hains, 20 Jan. 1865; quoted in Hoyt et al. 1991:Appendix A, Letter
37].

.. ""'

It is implied by Hains that the railroad ties used to build Redoubt B were locally available. It must
be presumed that these ties were borrowed from Herron's railroad, which was rendered inoperable
by destruction of the Boca Chica bridge in July. This scenario is consistent with the evidence, or
rather lack of evidence, associated with the Back Bay railroad. Divers found only one cross tie and
one isolated railroad spike in Back Bay.

Herron's railroad had a short life. It was built in the spring of 1864, was put out of
commission in July, and was being robbed of its cross ties by October. The route followed by
Herron's railroad is unknown, as it apparently was never mapped. The 1865 map illustrated in
Figure 8 was surveyed approximately six months after the bridge was destroyed at Boca Chica and
within about three months of the removal of the cross-ties for building Redoubt B. It is possible
that some or all of the rails remained in place, minus their ties, when the map was made. Even
so, if the railroad was not in use (it went nowhere and had no cross-ties) and if there were no
plans to rebuild it 10, there is no reason to expect that someone would map its location.
The map in Figure 8 shows several other new features on Brazos Island in addition
to the fortification. The wharf, Commissary store house "C.S. Buildings", and two houses appear
to have remained from early 1864 (Figure B), while nineteen new structures were added between
February 1864 and January 1865. The identities and dimensions of most buildings were described
in detail by Colonel R.B. Jones, commanding Brazos Santiago at the end of February 1865.
Although a tent camp is shown, it would appear from Jones letter, following, that General Pile got
his wish for better buildings.

ti'Sheridan did not come to Brazos Island with that idea for another six months.

is in pretty good repair. Both new and old can furnish fresh water for
5,000 or 6,000 troops. The old wharf is in good repair, with a wrecked
schooner for wharf boat. A new wood and coal wharf is nearly complete.
Twenty-two wagons in good repair; spades, shovels, etc., by the quantity,
and plenty of clothing, camp and garrison equipage for the troops on the
island. Two large flatboats, twelve yawls, and a small schooner, used as
a pilot boat, constitute our water transportation on the bay. We have
twenty-odd bales of cotton to be sent to Treasury Department as soon
as collected. The main fortification at this place is in progress of
completion, mounting at this time --- guns of heavy caliber. An earthwork and fortification are almost complete at Boca Chica Pass, with
curtains and traverses for riflemen. Four companies guard the pass.
The damming of the pass has not yet been commenced. Finally, the
force here can defend the island from any reasonable or probable
assault, and four times our number could not dislodge us ...A post garden
has been established with promise of success. The area cultivated is
about four acres. All quiet here as usual.
I have the honor to be, sir, respectfully, your obedient servant, R.B.
Jones, Colonel, Commanding [U.S. Secretary of War, Series I,
48(1):1005-1006].
At least one building, probably the structure(s) indicated on the waterfront, must have housed the
steam condensers for distilling drinking water. Notably, Jones made no 'mention of either a
locomotive or railroad cars or rails. Given the detail of his letter, it seems likely that such items
either had been shipped away, were never there, or, in the case of the rails, were not considered
a concern.

The Post-Civil War Period
Although the Civil War ended officially on April 10, 1865, with the surrender of Lee
at Appomattox, the last battle of the war was fount on May 12 and 13, 1865. The Battle of Palmito
Hill, won by Confederate troops, took place some 10 miles southwest of Brazos Santiago Depot
along the north bank of the Rio Grande (Lamont 1896:265-269).
Upon the heels of the Civil War, the U.S. Government continued to maintain a depot
at Brazos Santiago. Fearing that a coalition between Confederates and French Imperialists in
Mexico would re-kindle hostilities, General Grant ordered Philip Sheridan to the lower Rio
Grande Valley in June of 1865 to maintain order (Pierce 1917:6-0; Pipkin 1940:113). Sheridan
arrived at Brazos Island on 23 June 1865 with a contingency of 25,000 troops.
Figure 8 shows the island approximately five months prior to Sheridan's arrival. There
were at least 17 buildings on its northern end, another five at the hospital site on Dyer's Island,
and at least one wharf. By the time Sheridan landed, Herron's railroad had been out of service
for a full year. The railroad ties had been removed for use in Redoubt B nine months earlier.
Brazos Island was to become the transhipment point for quartermaster stores in support of
Sheridan's occupying force, and Sheridan quickly set about expanding facilities on the island.
Finding it difficult to cross the shallow bar at the mouth of the Rio Grande, Sheridan
proposed to rebuild the railroad from the north end of Brazos Island, crossing Boca Chica and on
to White Ranch on the Rio Grande (Pipkin 1940:114). In a letter written on 5 August 1865 to
Chief of Staff J.A Rawlins, Sheridan implied that the rails from Herron's railroad were reused,
but that cross-ties were needed:
I directed the railroad from Brazos in the direction of Boca Chica to the
Rio Grande, at White's Ranch, to be builded [sic] when I first came to
this command. This involved only the expense of cross-ties, as we have
everything else. The contract for these ties has been disapproved on the
strength of an order obtained from the Secretary of War for the
continuance of this road to Brownsville from White's Ranch. The short
road from Brazos for which these ties were gotten out and delivered long
ago is so necessary, that it seems like a want of reflection or a suggestion
on the part of some old man who was in the Mexican War when we got
along without it. The sooner these people die off the better it will be for
the public economy [U.S. Secretary of War, Series I, 48(2):1165 11 ].
Sheridan's railroad may have been completed by the fall of 1865, as the ties seem to have been
delivered prior to 5 August.

White Ranch12 (Figure 9). Figure 9 shows at least 70 distinct buildings on the north end of the
island and another 50 smaller symbols which may also represent structures. The hospital had been
moved to the north end of the island by this time. Figure 9 shows 12 large buildings, believed to
be barracks, as well as a tent camp. Four wharves were located along the north shore of the
island13 • A rail spur clearly is shown extending along the full length of one wharf at the
northwest comer of the island. This map also shows the earliest known beacon on Brazos Island.
In the spring of 1867, topographic and hydrographic surveys (Figure 10) showed at
least 69 buildings on the north end of Brazos Island, including troop barracks, apparently reduced
in number since 1866, and a hospital complex. The arrangement of buildings is similar to that in
Figure D, although there appear to be significantly fewer buildings and the tent camp is no longer
present.

There are at least four wharves shown in Figure 10. The two easternmost of these
were newly constructed since January of 1866 (compare with Figure 9). The easternmost wharf
is believed to have been constructed by April 10th, 1866 to replace the "old forage wharf."
I have the honor to inform you of the completion of a new & excellent
wharf at this place. It is 130 feet long by 75 feet broad, located just west
of the old forage wharf, with which it connects, giving a bonus [?] front
of 150 feet ... The piling is all of cypress lumber ... being a surplus of that
received for the Rail Road Bridge at Boca Chica... This wharf is
extended far enough into the channel to prevent the sand washing in &
filling it up as it did the old one [W.H.D. Cochrane, 10 April 1866;
quoted in Hoyt et al. 199l:Appendix A, Letter 38].

Figure 10 indicates a structure on the beach immediately adjacent the east side of the easternmost
wharf. Cochrane's description above suggests that structure to be the "old forage wharf' which was
· replaced in April of 1866 because it had filled in with sand between its pilings.
The westernmost wharf in Figure 10 has a shipwreck indicated at its end. This wharf
appears to be of the wharfboat type and appears in the same position as the 1866 railroad wharf.
Another shipwreck symbol is shown adjacent the shoreline to the east of this wharf. This may
represent a fifth wharf, also of the wharfboat type. It is located in the same approximate position
as the third wharf from the west in 1866 (Figure 9).
By all indications, commerce through Brazos Santiago Harbor was booming in the
spring of 1867. Sheridan's railroad had been operational for up to one and a half years by this

time. This was considered a U.S. military railroad, but it presumably also carried private freights.
The railroad shortened freight time to Brownsville by eliminating the need for steam lighters
between Brazos Santiago and the mouth of the Rio Grande. One could anticipate that such an
arrangement would be very advantageous to both the military and to merchants. King, Kenedy &
Co., owners of the steam lighters, may have been less enthusiastic, however, due to the probable
decline in their lighterage income.

King and Kenedy had perhaps anticipated that the railroad would be rebuilt to White
Ranch. On 10 May 1865, slightly over a month prior to Sheridan's arrival, they had purchased
White Ranch from the estate of James Walworth (Supplemental Records of Real Estate, Cameron
County, Book A, pp. 180-181; cited by Lea 1957:249). When the government decided to sell the
railroad in the summer of 1866 (Hoyt et al. 1991:Appendix A, Letter 49), Kenedy and King offered
to buy it for $60,000 (Lea 1957:248). They were outbid, however, by a group of New York
investors, represented by J.R. West and Richard Cheney, who offered $108,000. Tom Lea claims
that West and Cheney let ownership revert to the U.S. Government when they discovered that
Kenedy and King, the owners of White Ranch whom they had outbid, controlled the railroad's
access to the Rio Grande ("Indebted Railroads," Records of the Office of the Quartermaster General,
Pkg. No. 13, R.G. 92, National Archives; cited by Lea 1957:249)."
During the summer of 1867, the U.S. Government was planning the construction of
additional troop barracks and officers' quarters on the island. Detailed plans for these structures
were drawn (plans on file at the National Archives, Washington, D.C.; R.G. 92, Entry 225, Boxes
102-103) and were submitted with specifications and estimates of materials on 11July1867 (Hoyt
et al. 1991:Appendix A, letters 40-42). Two officers' quarters were planned, each a one and a halfstory, wood-frame building on a brick foundation. Each of these buildings required 17,000 bricks
for the foundation and chimney, combined. Each was to have its own inside kitchen facility with
a water cistern out back. Interestingly enough, these two buildings were to be anchored to the
island using iron screw anchors .
One two-story barrack was also planned, measuring 163 x 24 ft and built on brick
piers. The barrack was to be wood-framed with a large open porch, also supported by brick piers,
running the full length of both sides. An estimate of 13,000 bricks was made for building 85 piers
and a central chimney for this barrack. No evidence has been found to indicate whether these
three structures were built, nor where on the island they were intended to be placed.
Growth on Brazos Island following the Civil War suggested that a bright economic
future was in store. The railroad had been privatized and certain businessmen hoped to extend
the tracks from White Ranch to Brownsville. The military seemed to be building a "permanent"
post on the island. The brief period since Sheridan's arrival in June of 1865 was perhaps the peak
of commercial activity on Brazos Island. Then:
On the 7 Oct. 1867 a hurricane destroyed ... every building at Brazos
Santiago. ... from the nature of the soil (sand) the [rail] road was
completely washed away in sections, and the buildings or sheds in which

the locomotive and other property was then stored were destroyed
[Charles H. Tompkins 1868; quoted in Hoyt et al. 1991:Appendix A,
Letter 45].
The railroad was in terrible condition following the hurricane.
Brownsville newspaper described the damage:

An article in a

They say there is not one rail on top of another if there ever was. The
track made tracks but cannot now be tracked out by the best dog tracker
to be found... The ties and rails and cars are said to be about equally
divided between the Rio Grande, Brazos Bay, and Clark's Island (Daily
Ranchero, 17 November 1867).
The railroad was a total loss. The Government advertised it for sale, apparently for
salvage, in December 1867. The highest bid was $5,000 from King, Kenedy & Co. Having only
recently sold the railroad for $108,000, the Quartermaster's Department was not anxious to accept
such a low bid. Charles Tompkins, Chief Quartermaster of the Fifth Military District in New
Orleans, finally convinced General D.H. Rucker, the Acting Quartermaster General, that the
railroad was only suitable as iron stock and that, in his opinion, it was only worth $2,400, about half
what King, Kenedy & Co. had offered (Hoyt et al. 1991:Appendix A, Letter 44).
General Rucker directed Tompkins to accept the offer of $5,000 in March of 1868,
upon which King, Kenedy & Co. withdrew their offer. The railroad was immediately put up for
sale again, but the highest bid was now only $2,400, precisely what Tompkins had estimated as its
value. The names of the bidders are unknown; however, the high (or perhaps only) bidder seems
to have had inside information regarding the minimum acceptable offer. Perhaps sensing this,
General Rucker ordered, on 18 April 1868, that the "iron of the road", the locomotive, and all
moveable property be collected and stored until such time as a fair price could be obtained.
Tompkins responded on 26 April that he would comply with these orders "at once", but under
continued protest that the labor of gathering up the rails would "cost more than the entire stock
is worth." It is obvious from Tompkin's letters that he wanted the railroad sold at any price (Hoyt
et al. 1991:Appendix A, letters 43-45).
The Brazos Island railroad was finally sold, by 10 September 1868, to the Indianola
Railroad Company for $20,000 (Hoyt et al. 1991:Appendix A, Letter 46). By this date the
headquarters of the Fifth Military District had been moved from New Orleans to Austin and
General Tompkins was no longer Chief Quartermaster of the District. Presumably, though, he had
followed Rucker's orders and had gathered the "iron of the road." This could explain the
considerably higher purchase price of $20,000, since the Indianola Railroad Company could ship
the stock from Brazos Island without paying to have it gathered up and transported to a wharf at
Brazos Santiago.
Despite the extensive damage to Brazos Santiago dealt by the 1867 hurricane, the
harbor was still a necessity to merchants in Matamoros and Brownsville. By April 1868, plans had
been drawn up for a new government wharf and warehouse (see Hoyt et al. 1991:figurcs 16-18).
These structures were presumably built soon after April. The "Government Wharf' remained in
use through the early 1870s.

Prior to the change in the Fifth Military District, General Tompkins had directed that
a dam be constructed across Boca Chica. Charles Whitney, the New Orleans agent for the Morgan
Steamship Line, wrote the Quartermaster General on 14 October 1868 to congratulate him on the
success of this project, but also to encourage him to protect the flanks of the dam from erosion.

A week ago there was scarcely (5) five feet depth of water on the
bar ...The first Norther of the season came, and in 48 hours the stormy
entrance currents ... have increased the depth to (10) ten feet which is
quite 2 feet more than our steamers have found for a number of years.
In fact, such depth has never been known on Brazos bar, except during
the recent war when the Boca Chica was closed by a dam thrown across
same by the United States troops, for use as a bridge, and which they
afterwards destroyed ... [C.A. Whitney 1868; quoted in Hoyt et al. 1991:
Appendix A, Letter 47].

This is the first known engineering effort designed for the purpose of improving Brazos Santiago
harbor. Although initially encouraging, the dam failed to maintain an increased channel depth over
the bar. Boca Chica remained completely closed in 1871 with no effect on the bar (Hoyt et al.
1991: Appendix A, Letter 52).
In August 1870, Simon Celaya of Brownsville secured a charter for the Rio Grande
Railroad proposed between Point Isabel and Brownsville. There was a great interest on the part
of this railroad company and of the residents of Point Isabel to see the harbor at Brazos Santiago
improved. In January 1871, Lt. H.M. Adams, Corps of Engineers, was ordered to survey the
harbor and pass at Brazos Santiago 'for the purpose of collecting all information needed to form
plans & estimates for such work of improvement...' (Hoyt et al. 199l:Appendix A, Letter 51).
Adams had completed his survey by February 25th.

During his stay at Brazos Island, Adams inquired with the U.S. Customs Collector at
Point Isabel regarding import and export statistics. Foreign and 'bonded goods" traded through
Brazos Santiago during the year 1869-1870 totalled $4,293,457, with $2,624,794 worth of that being
exports. The primary trade merchandise included: 'Hides, wood [or wool?], [illegible], goat skins,
coffee, sugar, [illegible] cocoa, dry goods, machinery, tobacco, wines, liquors, etc." (Hoyt et al. 1991:
Appendix A, Letter 53). During 1869, 102 vessels (foreign and licensed tonnage only) entered
Brazos Santiago Harbor, totalling 42,110 tons and having crews totalling 1,963 sailors. During
1870, these numbers dropped slightly to 86 vessels, totalling 40,176 tons and 1,495 crew (Appendix
A, Letter 52).

The result of Adams' survey was a recommendation that any harbor improvements
would be very expensive and very temporary. He estimated the cost for a single concrete jetty at
$774,630, but believed this expense was not justified given the expected results (Hoyt et al. 1991:
Appendix A, Letter 52).

Adams' 1871 hydrographic survey map of the harbor pass and bar (Figure 11) shows
the location of the Government Wharf. At that time, it was one of two wharves on Brazos Island,
although the other was an "old wharf' that was out of service. The old wharf may have been one
of two built between January 1866 and the spring of 1867 (Figure 10; two easternmost wharves).
On 14 August 1871, King, Kenedy & Company proposed to rent the Government
Wharf and warehouse at Brazos Santiago for the sum of $1,000 per year (Hoyt et al. 1991:
Appendix A, Letter 55). King and Kenedy had held a virtual monopoly on transhipment of
merchandise from Brazos Santiago up the Rio Grande to Brownsville or across the Laguna Madre
to Point Isabe~ but they were not the only persons to utilize the Government Wharf. Their
proposal resulted in a tremendous outcry. Complaints were received by the government from
several companies, including Charles T. & N. Chester, Manufactures, Importers and Dealers in
Telegraph and Electrical Instruments and Supplies, New York (Hoyt et al 1991:Appendix A,
Letter 56); Woodhouse, Southmayd & Rudd of New York; and the Rio Grande Rail Road
Company.
H.E. Woodhouse complained that neither King, Kenedy & Co. nor Morgan Line
steamships were charged any wharfage by the government, whereas his own steamships were
charged fifty cents per ton for wheeling coal from his nearby coal house across the Government
Wharf to steamships of his line. To be fair, he thought the wharfage should be standardized and
that if the wharf was to be leased, this process should be opened to public bidding (Hoyt et al.
1991:Appendix A, Letter 57).
Simon Celaya, President of the Rio Grande Rail Road Company, was concerned that
King and Kenedy would close the use of the Government Wharf to his company in a ploy to
prevent the railroad from being completed. Celaya wrote on 1 November 1871:
I beg respectfully to present a few remarks against the acceptance of
such an offer [to rent the wharf], as being... calculated to promote a
monopoly which has smothered the advancement of this frontier and
which expects to destroy the prospects and delay the construction of the
railroad which I represent.
We are now actively engaged in constructing the railroad from Point
Isabel to Brownsville...
We will need this wharf, the only one at Brazos, in the construction of
our road, in the landing of supplies, material, etc... To place it in the
hands of those who could and would exclude us from the use of it, would
be showing a partiality which, I know, is foreign to the intention of the
government [Celaya 1871; quoted in Hoyt et al. 199l:Appendix A, Letter
58].
The wharf apparently was never leased, for no further mention of the incident is known.
In the fall of 1875, a full-rigged brig of 350-400 tons, Rene des Mer, sank in the pass
at Brazos Santiago after striking an old anchor. Futile attempts were made to raise the vessel.

By November 29th of the following year, the wreck was becoming an obstruction to navigation in
the harbor.
She is lying on the east side of the middle ground almost abreast the old
Gov. wharf. The channel to the new wharf is filling up by the gradual
extension of the point of the spit from the wreck to the shore, making
a shoal and sharp turn in the channel dangerous in flood tide or heavy
weather. I have tried to blow her up but there is no one here who can
work under water [Charles Whitney & Co. 1876; quoted in Hoyt et al.
1991: Appendix A, Letter 59].
In February 1877, the U.S. Army Engineers were considering means and expenses to
remove the wreck. Captain James Gregory inspected the vessel and reported on the need for a
government action to remove this and other harbor obstructions at Brazos Santiago.

... her hull is filled with sand... She lies between the anchorage inside the
bar and the [new] wharf at Brazos Santiago and about 350 yards distant
from the wharf. On a line from the wreck towards Point Isabel a middle
ground of sand has been formed since the wreck has been where she is,
which for 200 or 300 yards is nearly dry at low water. This was formerly
all good water. ..It will be necessary to blow her to pieces with explosives
and to remove the fragments piecemeal. There are besides in the harbor
several iron obstructions, 15 old anchors and shafts of steamers, some of
which were lost, others being purposely deposited during the
war ... Captain Baker pointed out to me their approximate locations, and
states that there are five or six of them [J.F. Gregory 1877; Hoyt et al.
1991: Appendix A, Letter 60].
A contract for removal of the Rene des Mer was issued to the New Orleans Wrecking
Company in the amount of $6,000. The work was performed in December 1878. The work was
inspected by H.S. Douglas of the Army Engineers in New Orleans. Douglas stated that "to the best
of my belief, Greenleaf Andrews, president of New Orleans Wrecking Company, has fulfilled his
contract..." (U.S. House of Representatives 1879). Apparently, however, he only removed the
upper portions of the hull, as it was hit by a dredge in 1927 and dynamited again (Alperin
1977:142).
The Rio Grande Railroad between Point Isabel and Brownsville began operation in
1871, despite the efforts of Kenedy and King to prevent competition with their Rio Grande
steamboats. The railroad depended upon the harbor at Brazos Santiago for all of its freight. In
retrospect, the continued operation of the harbor may likewise have been dependent upon the
success of the Rio Grande Railroad.

EH&A's archaeological investigations indicate that some of these may have been railroad iron
scattered by the 1867 hurricane.

By the 1870s, the U.S. Army Engineers had experimented with various harbor
improvements around the country, with mixed success. The great expense of building jetties and
dredging channels, however, meant a fierce competition for federal funds between various ports.
Congress and the Army Engineers required sufficient economic justification before spending
money. The existence of the Rio Grande Railroad apparently justified Federal expenditures for
harbor improvements at Brazos Santiago.
The River and Harbors Act of 1881 outlined a plan for the construction of parallel
jetties to protect the pass at Brazos Santiago, creating the basis for a deep-water port. Preparatory
hydrographic survey work was conducted in 1881 by the U.S. Coast and Geodetic Survey. U.S.
Army Engineers also conducted field investigations in 1881 to determine the best location for the
jetties.
Major S.M. Mansfield submitted several tracings (of a pre-1881 map base), showing
proposed jetty locations, to the Army Engineers' Department at Galveston on 28 June 1881 (copies
of two Mansfield tracings are on file at EH&A). The jetties planned by Mansfield in 1881 were
oriented in a northeast-southwest direction and would have allowed a northeasterly swell to directly
enter the mouth of the jetties. Presumably, it was planned that the currents set up by this swell
during the winter months would keep the entrance channel across the bar scoured to a favorable
depth.
The next year the jetty plan was revised. The Army Engineers conducted their own
hydrographic survey, completed between 11 and 19 March 1882. Mansfield submitted the results
of that survey, along with a revised plan of the Brazos Island jetties (copy on file at EH&A), in
his Annual Report to the Engineers Department on 30 June 1882. Funding had already been
allocated by Congress to build the jetties, and work was begun quickly on the south jetty.

The jetty was completed in 1883, and in late June 1884, Mansfield had another
hydrographic survey conducted of the entrance channel and pass, presumably to assess the effects
of the new jetty. The map produced from that survey shows the solid line of the completed jetty
extending into the Gulf (copy on file at EH&A). Interestingly enough, the 1884 shoreline from
Mansfield's second survey showed that a massive sand spit had accumulated in the channel on the
north end of Brazos Island between 1882 and 1884. Funding was halted on the jetty project after
completion of the south jetty (Alperin 1977:140). It was probably no coincidence that the Mexican
National Railroad had bypassed the Lower Rio Grande Valley in the previous year.
Cancellation of the planned north jetty turned out to be rather fortuitous for
Congress. The south jetty, completed in 1884, was struck by a major hurricane in 1886. In July
and August 1887, Major O.H. Ernst of the U.S. Corps of Engineers directed that another
hydrographic survey be conducted in Brazos Harbor. The results showed that the new south jetty
had "practically disappeared" (U.S. House of Representatives 1895:1819).
Ernst's 1887 survey map (Figure 12) illustrated several interesting features on Brazos
Island, besides the location of the 1884 jetty. For example, three "old wharves" had become
landlocked due to the shoreline changes since 1882. Other features include: a marine ways, the
1880 Life Saving Station, and an unidentified shipwreck. The ship appears to have grounded on
a remnant of the 1884 sand spit caused by the jetty.

Ernst also prepared comparative hydro graphic charts in 1887 showing bathymetry and
shorelines for five different years: 1867, 1871, 16 1882, 1884 and 1887. This was extremely helpful
to EH&A when attempting to register historic maps with one another in the absence of fixed
landmarks on the islands. Copies of Ernst's comparative charts are on file at EH&A

All in all, the 1884 jetty on Brazos Island was a miserable failure which no doubt
contributed to the demise of Brazos Santiago's importance as a harbor. Not only did the jetty wash
away in the first hurricane, but its brief presence seemed to have significantly altered the shoreline,
thereby landlocking the wharves.
The fate of Brazos Santiago Harbor was sealed as a result of competition with
railroads. Ironically, the harbor depended on the Rio Grande Railroad, between Point Isabel and
Brownsville, for its continued strategic value as a port. Even more ironically, Mifflin Kenedy and
Richard King, whose steamboat business on the Rio Grande depended upon Brazos Harbor,
worked diligently to prevent the success of the Rio Grande Railroad.
King and Kenedy, failing in their efforts to prevent the Rio Grande Railroad from
entering into Brownsville, re-established a Fast Freight service from Brazos Santiago to
Brownsville, by way of the Rio Grande, to compete with the railroad. Claiming that railroad rates
were excessive, they deployed their Fast Freight service in an early-day price war to undermine the
effectiveness of the Rio Grande Railroad .

...

·.

The Rio Grande Railroad had been ill-fated from the beginning. Storms in 1873 and
1874 caused serious damage. In 1876, Kenedy, King and Uriah Lott financed a new railroad, the
Corpus Christi, San Diego and Rio Grande narrow-gauge, from Corpus Christi to Laredo (Pierce
1917:150). This new railroad bypassed Brownsville altogether, and the new Corpus Christi-Laredo
route could out-compete the Brazos Harbor-Point Isabel-Brownsville route for trading with Mexico.
Another railroad, however, would mark the demise of the big merchants in Brownsville, as well
as the demise of Brazos Santiago as a major port. In 1882, the Mexican National Railroad was
completed, running from Corpus Christi to Laredo and on into Monterrey. It bypassed
Brownsville, and indeed all of Cameron County, cutting it out of the northern Mexican trade
(Ferguson 1976:208).
The final death knell for Brazos Santiago Harbor was the hurricane of 1886. The
same storm that had demolished the 1884 jetty on Brazos Island caused extensive damage to the
Rio Grande Railroad. So much storm damage was incurred that the railroad was taken out of
commission and placed into receivership (Reed 1941:467). 17 Although the little railroad was later
rebuilt, Brazos Island played a comparatively minor role in commerce after 1886.

~Copies of the original 1871 hydrographic survey indicate that Ernst incorrectly registered this
reline when producing his series of shoreline overlays in 1887. This discrepancy was not discovered
. after the publication of Hoyt et al. 1991; however, illustrations in the current report reflect the
d location.
7
l 1'erguson (1976:208) stated that the hurricane which did $100,000 damage to the Rio Grande
·oad occurred in 1888.

Following the failure of the 1884 jetty and the Rio Grande Railroad, the deep-water
project at Brazos Santiago remained at a virtual standstill for 20 years. The prosperous era of the
steamboat was gone, and the newer and larger ocean-going ships bypassed Brazos Santiago for
improved ports at Galveston (Alperin 1977:43). During the last quarter of the century, only lightdraft vessels from Galveston and New Orleans visited the little port.
The cessation of waterborne trade was compounded by the establishment of railroad
connections that excluded the Lower Rio Grande Valley from new trade routes. The entire valley
went into decline with the diminished trade and economic activity (Lea 1957:536-541). The
completion of the St. Louis, Brownsville and Mexican {StLB&M) Railroad in 1904 finally brought
economic life back to the valley by connecting Brownsville to northern cities and the interior of
Mexico. At the same time, renewed enthusiasm arose for a deep-water port.
In 1905, it was discovered that funds remained from the 1881 jetty appropriations, the
project having been halted in 1884 without construction of the proposed north jetty. The COE
used this money to dredge a channel from Brazos Santiago Pass across Laguna Madre to Point
Isabel. The project included a turning basin at the Point Isabel railroad wharf, which eliminated
both the need for lightering and the need for wharves at Brazos Island.
The channel to Point Isabel was 70 ft wide and 10 ft deep and accommodated light
steamers capable of crossing the bar at Brazos Santiago (Alperin 1977:140). There were business
interests in Brownsville, however, who were opposed to plans for a deep-water port at Point Isabel,
fearing that it might divert capital from their new railroad. Others were skeptical of the plan's
feasibility. Frank Pierce's account of port activities at the time is tinged with doubt.
This fund was resurrected, the amount, $58,000 was promptly thrown
into the pockets of the dredge company which, in turn, excavated $58,000
of dirt and dumped it at other places in the bay from where it soon
found its way back to its original bed. As an additional stimulus to direct
the dirt back to its home, the Luzon (a steam lighter) was permitted to
sink at the end of the little wharf, to form a nucleus for a bar from
whence the channel might fill [Pierce 1917;127].
As a result of those actions, Pierce stated, "Brazos de Santiago bar and the once-busy little towns
within three miles of it, are now deserted" (Pierce 1917:127).

The sunken Luzon came to rest crosswise in the harbor so that it prevented freight
transfers and rendered the turning basin useless. Brazos Santiago Pass wa5 effectively put out of
commission by this event, since freight could not be moved between the harbor and Brownsville.
The sinking was an alleged act of sabotage by railroad interests to impair harbor operations or
eliminate its usefulness altogether. If it was, in fact, an intentional wreck, its goal was certainly
accomplished (Alperin 1977:141; Pierce 1917:127). The 1905 excavation of the channel had been
a wasted effort.
Coincidental with the 1905 dredging, King Ranch interests helped spur the completion
of the StLB&M Railway through Brownsville, bypassing Point Isabel. Many of those who
supported the StLB&M felt that a deep-water port would interfere with the success of the newly

completed railroad. The established port plan, at that time, involved dredging a channel from the
end of the narrow-gauge railroad at Point Isabel, through Brazos Santiago Pass into the Gulf
(Ferguson 1976:247). Supporters of the new StLB&M made short work of that idea, however.
They gained control of the little Rio Grande Railroad and promptly abandoned it to deteriorate
beyond repair (Alperin 1977:141).
Despite both the Luzon fiasco and the demise of the Rio Grande Railroad, the
concept of a deep-water port for the Lower Rio Grande Valley retained its supporters. The
individual credited with sustaining the idea is Oimmodore Louis Oibolini. Oibolini came to
Brownsville in 1907 and became a tireless supporter of a deep-water harbor (Pierce 1917:124).
He made a practice of recording and compiling technical data for the purpose of convincing the
COE and government officials that deep water was a practical endeavor and essential to the
economic growth of the area (Ferguson 1976:236).
The completion of the StLB&M Railroad, combined with the elimination of any rail
competition from Point Isabel, gave Brownsville economic dominion in the area. Oil-bearing ships
from Tampico, forced to bypass Brazos Santiago, landed at Aransas Pass where the oil was then
shipped by rail to Brownsville at considerable cost to consumers and at considerable profit to those
who manipulated the situation (Alperin 1977:141).

Although competition with the railroads severely curtailed the use of Brazos Santiago
Harbor, at least one wharf and presumably a warehouse or two remained in use on the island until
about 1910. A Life Saving Station was near the former Brazos Lighthouse on the Gulf side of
Brazos Island in 1880. Repeated storm damage to the Life Saving Station finally forced its removal
to the bay side of the island in 1908 (Pierce 1917:140). The later location is illustrated in a map
of Brazos Santiago Pass dating from 1910 (Figure 13). Several structures, including the crew
quarters, a boat house and a wharf were associated with the station. A detailed plan of the Life
Saving Station complex, dating from 1909, was discovered at the National Archives (Figure 14).
One interesting feature of this plan is the precise location of an abandoned wharf. The Life Saving
Station illustrated in Figure 13 was totally destroyed by a hurricane on 16 October 1912. A
detailed account of this event and the associated destruction was published in the Annual Report
of the U.S. Life Saving Service for 1913. "The rebuilding of the station was undertaken without
delay and the work speedily concluded .. ." (U.S. Treasury Department 1913:20-21).

The first solid effort to bring deep water to the Brownsville vicinity occurred in 1911
with the formation of the Brownsville Waterways Association. Louis Oibolini was a member of
the Board of Directors. Another proponent of the deep-water port was David O'Brien, an
Irishman, who succeeded in purchasing the abandoned Rio Grande Railroad in anticipation of
transporting cargo discharged at the proposed Brazos Santiago harbor.
An alternative was
advanced by B.G. Stegman, who proposed the construction of a ship channel extending from
Brazos Santiago Pass to Brownsville where it would terminate at a port. His 1912 survey
'essentially followed the line of the present channel, but his plan was not given full consideration
at the time (Ferguson 1976:249).
In 1917 the COE surveyed and mapped Brazos Santiago in anticipation of the project.
e District Engineer asked Mr. Oibolini to what extent the valley communities would assist in
nding the project. There were no wharves indicated on Brazos Island at that time. Delegates

from every town in the valley met to discuss that issue in the summer of 1918. Among the
improvements recommended by the COE was a turning basin/anchorage area, 1,000 x 2,000 ft and
25 ft deep, in the pass adjacent Brazos Island. No written evidence has been found to suggest this
was ever created; however, the presence of deep water in the pass, far south of the modern
channel design limits, indicates that a similar basin may have been dredged at a later date (U.S.
House of Representatives 1919).
In 1919, interested parties again appealed to the federal government for harbor
improvements. Congress approved a five-year experimental project to dredge a 5.5- x 122-m
channel through the pass, contingent upon local investment in the construction of a 5- x 30.5-m
channel from just inside the pass to the turning basin at Point Isabel. The local interests were also
required to maintain their part of the channel, to rebuild the Rio Grande Railroad to standard
gauge, and to furnish suitable terminal facilities (Rivers and Harbors Act 1919:3).

Dredging began inside the harbor first in 1923, and later outside. The outer bar at
Brazos Santiago posed many problems for engineers, just as it had for sea-going vessels for
hundreds of years.
The more abrupt slope of the sea bottom and the greater proximity of
deep water caused considerable difficulties. At one time, a dredge that
had worked its way in through the pass had to turn around and re-dredge
its way out (Alperin 1977:141).
Under the 1919 project, "two short stone dikes were completed [in the pass] in June
1927, and some dredging was done between them. However as the channel shoaled in, the
dredging was stopped in January 1928..." (U.S. House of Representatives 1939).
In 1928, the Brownsville Navigation District was formed. In that year, too, the
government appropriated $2.7 million for the harbor project, but it wasn't until authorization by
the Rivers and Harbors Act of 1930 th;it the current BSC was finally begun, some 50 years after
the initial plans were laid (Berry 1988:2).
In January 1935, two 1,500-m jetties extending into the Gulf of Mexico, were
completed at a cost of $2.6 million, with the 27-km Brownsville Ship Channel dredged to a depth
of 7.6 m and width of 30.5 m at the bottom, widening to 76.2 m at the water line. The channel
extended from Brazos Santiago Pass to the turning basin, which was 305 m wide and also dredged
to a depth of 7.6 m. A local newspaper account stated that the dirt taken from the channel was
enough to cover 40 city blocks to the height of Brownsville's tallest building, the El Jardin Hotel
(Berry 1988:2; Reed 1941:762). An historian writing five years after the opening of the channel
had a more pragmatic, if less imaginative, description:
The turning basin itself is 5 miles below the city of Brownsville. It is
served by the Port Isabel & Rio Grande Railway. It has two regular
coastwise steamship lines. Foreign trade consists of citrus fruits and
vegetables, cotton, and petroleum from the Rio Grande Valley [Reed
1941:763).

With the completion of the channel, attention was turned to the construction of
support facilities near Brownsville. Work began on wharves, docks and warehouses in the spring
of 1935. The two docks and two warehouses that were completed with the channel were built at
a cost of $600,000 (Berry 1988:3). The long-awaited port was finally opened officially on 16 May
1936. Subsequent amendments to the Brazos Isabel Harbor project allowed for improvements over
the years and the channel was deepened by degrees until it reached its current depth of 11 m. The
Water Resources Bill of 1986 authorized further dredging to a depth of 12.8 m contingent upon
a re-evaluation of a COE study and, of course, further funding (Berry 1988:3).
Although Commodore Cobolini did not live to see the channel and port completed,
his tireless efforts to bring deepwater to the Lower Rio Grande Valley earned him the local
sobriquet, "Father of Deep Water" (Ferguson 1976:237).

IV. RESEARCH DESIGN
PREVIOUS INVESTIGATIONS
Brazos Santiago Harbor and the adjacent Brazos Santiago Depot site (41CF4) have
been the subject of numerous historical and archaeological investigations. The story of Brazos
Santiago was perhaps first documented as history by Pierce (1917) in A History of the Lower Rio
Grande Valley. At that time, the heyday of Brazos Santiago was nearly 50 years in the past,
although the site had been occupied nearly continuously up to at least 1913.
In 1933, sixteen years after Pierce's history was published, the site of Brazos Santiago
Depot was exposed by a hurricane. Tent pegs, believed to date from the Civil War encampments,
were found embedded in the hard clay after the hurricane winds and flood tides removed the loose
sand overburden (Champion 1938). A local informant, Mr. Keith Hoyt of Mission, Texas, who has
visited Brazos Island annually since the 1930s, recalled his childhood memories of the 1933
hurricane to one of the authors in 1987 (Hoyt, personal communication 1987).

According to Hoyt, the tides associated with the 1933 storm completely inundated
Brazos Island and the mouth of the Rio Grande. He recalled driving out from Brownsville with
his parents following the hurricane and standing at the eastern end of Loma de los Ebanitos, 5.3
miles (8.5 km) inland from the coast. Hoyt said all land east of that point was inundated. He
described the scene at Brazos Santiago Depot when the flood waters receded as one of bricks
scattered everywhere. Local residents reportedly removed thousands of bricks from the site at that
time.
Brazos Santiago was 'rediscovered' by archaeologists and historians in 1967 when the
site was again exposed by a hurricane, Hurricane Beulah. Archaeologists from the Texas Historical
Commission (THC) designated the site as 41CF4. The THC surveyed and mapped many exposed
features at 41CF4, including tent pegs, barrels, trenches, pilings, and bricks. The resulting map
of archaeological features (Corbin and Webb 1967) is on file at the THC. The features mapped
by Corbin and Webb have been registered to a modem map of the island (Figure 15) through the
locations of pilings from the 1930s jetty railroad which were included on their map. The THC's
mapping effort was concentrated in an area southwest of Back Bay but northeast of the jetty
railroad. Corbin and Webb's original map assigns a unique number to each feature; however,
EH&A's efforts to locate the field notes corresponding to their map, either at the Texas Historical
Commission or from Corbin directly (Corbin 1992), have been unsuccessful.
The preservation of perishable items and structural remains at the site was considered
exceptional. Tunnell and Jensen (1971) described the site condition following the storm:
Here before us were thousands of supply wagon tracks, many with the
draft horse and oxen hoofprints in between them. 1 Neat rows of tent
pegs and the wooden bases of flagpoles and large buildings abounded.

The wooden foundation to the first lighthouse built in the Port Isabel
area [sic2] and hundreds of other architectural features lay exposed and
as fresh as the day they were built.
Artifacts of every description were so profuse that it was literally
impossible to carry more than a small portion back to Austin for study
and preservation. Most noticeable among the artifacts are the large
numbers of well-preserved perishable items -- boots, shoes, rubberized
ponchos, wood, and cloth which, after 120 years of being submerged in
saltwater, look almost new after preservation.
Artifacts recovered by the THC included clothing, leather boots, shoes, muskets,
bayonets, and shot, as well as numerous ceramic, glass, bone and metal artifacts. Figure 15 shows
the major collection areas from the THC's 1967 effort. Note that one collection area extended
into Back Bay. Surface collection was possible in Back Bay because of an extraordinarily low tide
(Corbin 1983).
In 1973, a cultural resources survey was conducted by Hall and Grombacher (1974)
along the Brownsville Ship Channel, which was to be widened and deepened as part of the Brazos
Island Harbor Waterway Project. Several sites were recorded and tested along the ship channel;
however, subsurface testing at Brazos Santiago Depot recovered no artifacts.

The Texas Antiquities Committee {TAC) conducted an extensive program of
magnetometer survey and anomaly testing along the coast of Padre Island in 1974, 1975 and 1977
{Arnold 1976, 1978). The survey extended some 80 km along the Gulf Coast, from the Rio
Grande on the south to 18 km north of Mansfield Pass, crossing the Brownsville Entrance Channel
outside of the jetties. Arnold considered the area around Brazos Santiago Pass to be of special
interest due to the long history of maritime activity at this location. He also hoped to collect
further data on magnetic anomalies located during an earlier magnetometer survey of the Brazos
Santiago Pass area conducted by the TAC (Hays and Herrin 1970). No historical resources were
confirmed in the channel by either survey.

In June of 1980, Brazos Santiago was struck by another major storm. Hurricane Allen
removed sand overburden from much of Site 41CF4. Responding to reports of looting on the site,
the THC and the Texas Parks and Wildlife Department mapped newly exposed surface features
and collected artifacts. An analysis of the ceramics collected by the THC in 1967 and 1980 formed
the basis of Bank's (1983) M.A thesis. According to Banks (1983), most of the artifacts collected
after Hurricane Allen were . from an area west of the jetty railroad pilings {Figure 15).
Unfortunately, the map produced during that expedition was lost (THC 1986).

The earliest lighthouses known for the vicinity of Port Isabel are the current Port Isabel lighthouse
(Light No. 364 of the 9th Lighthouse District) and a beacon located on the southeast corner of Padre
Island (Light No. 363 of the 9th Lighthouse District), both built in 1852. The first known Brazos Island
beacon was located near the beach, due east of the depot, well outside of the area mapped by Corbin and
Webb in 1967. It appears on maps by 1866, although research has not confirmed the date of its
construction.

The Brownsville Navigation District contracted with EH&A in 1980 to conduct
archaeological investigations along the Brownsville Ship Channel, including portions of northern
Brazos Island and Clark's Island (EH&A 1981). One aspect of that project included conducting
marine and terrestrial magnetometer surveys at Brazos Santiago. Both surveys were conducted
between December 1980 and February 1981. Much of the area exposed by Hurricane Allen was
already covered by sand, but historical artifacts were still visible.
Portions of EH&A's 1980-81 marine survey in the vicinity of Brazos Island have since
been resurveyed (EH&A 1990). Their terrestrial survey, however, covered a large portion of the
historic Brazos Santiago Depot which has not otherwise been addressed by archaeological
investigations. The terrestrial magnetometer survey covered a rectangular area extending 400 m
inland from the channel shore along the west side of Back Bay.
The survey results were published as four separate map sheets (EH&A 1981:Figures
1-7 through 1-9; also reproduced in Gearhart and Moore 1987:Appendix A, Figures 12-15), showing
the locations of all magnetic anomalies of 10 gammas or greater. A total of 866 anomalies were
recorded within the survey area. Though none of the anomalies were tested, the author concluded
that "large amounts of cultural material are present on the site of Brazos Santiago Depot" (EH&A
1981). Figure 15 shows the approximate locations of the original four map sheets with respect to
the modem land surface.
Another aspect of EH&A's (1981) study included the production of several map
overlays showing the positions of historic features relative to the modem shoreline. Those overlays
(EH&A 1981: figures 1-4a through 1-4j), which were produced using manual drafting techniques,
agree reasonably well with revised overlays produced by computer-assisted drafting (CAD)
techniques for this report.3
Brazos Santiago Depot was nominated to the National Register of Historic Places
(NRHP) by the THC in 1971. The nomination was based primarily on investigations by the THC
in 1967. National Register Nomination Form continuation sheets were submitted to the National
Park Service by the THC in 1986. These updated forms included information from Banks' (1983)
thesis and from the archaeological field work accomplished between 1967 and 1981. Brazos
Santiago Depot was officially entered into the NRHP on 14 March 1986. The official boundary
of the Brazos Santiago Depot National Register District is illustrated on Figure 15.
In 1986, EH&A assessed potential impacts to Brazos Santiago Depot which might
result from a proposed residential/commercial development on the Rio Grande and Brazos Island
by Playa del Rio, Inc. of Brownsville, Texas. As part of that project, EH&A conducted an
archaeological reconnaissance survey and reviewed previous investigations conducted at Brazos
Santiago Depot (Gearhart and Moore 1987). The primary site impacts anticipated as a result of
the proposed development were related to a proposed marina just west of Back Bay. The

All of the overlays presented in Hoyt et al. (1991) have been revised for this report, based upon
further analyses of historic topographic survey charts. The overlays presented in EH&A's 1981 report
were not used during any step of EH&A's CAD analyses.

reconnaissance survey could not delineate site boundaries due to the sand overburden. To the date
of this writing, no permits have been issued for construction of the proposed marina.
In 1989, the Galveston District of the COE, in keeping with their mandate to assess
the potential impacts of COE undertakings on cultural resources, requested EH&A to conduct a
remote-sensing survey of the Brownsville Entrance Channel and the Brownsville Ship Channel
between COE stations 9+000 and -12+000, a distance of 6.4 km (EH&A 1990). Accordingly,
EH&Acarried out a multi-instrument electronic survey, using side-scan sonar, sub-bottom profiler,
recording fathometer and magnetometer.
A total of 78 magnetic anomalies were recorded by EH&A (1990). Sixteen of those
were recommended for archaeological investigation. Six of these anomalies, located along the
Brownsville Ship Channel, were investigated by EH&A archaeological divers immediately
subsequent to the completion of the survey. None of the investigated anomalies were determined
to be generated by archaeologically significant objects. One other anomaly, located along the
Brownsville Entrance Channel near Brazos Island, was also investigated due to the character of
its magnetic signature and its proximity to Brazos Santiago Depot. The source of the latter
anomaly, Anomaly R, was not positively identified, although early twentieth-century artifacts were
found at the anomaly location.
During the fall of 1990, EH&A conducted additional archaeological testing in waters
of the Brownsville Ship Channel, Brownsville Entrance Channel, and the adjacent Back Bay (Hoyt
et al. 1991). This work was requested by the COE, reflecting their continuing concern over this
historically significant area. A total of 16 previously recorded magnetic anomalies were
investigated by divers. Back Bay, which lies within the boundaries of the Brazos Santiago Depot
National Register property, was evaluated for its potential to contain archaeological features.
EH&A archaeologists diving in Back Bay located a previously unrecorded railroad, believed to date
from 1864, and a grid of submerged pilings, believed to be the remains of a wharf built in 1868.
A substantial number of unpublished historic maps and letters pertaining to Brazos Santiago were
copied by EH&A at the National Archives and at the National Ocean Service Hydrographic
Archives as part of that project. Sixty letters were transcribed and incorporated into an appendix
to EH&A's report (Hoyt et al. 1991). Selected historic maps were digitized on a CAD system and
registered with a modem map of Brazos Island to produce a set of historic shoreline overlays.

RESEARCH GOALS
As defined by the Scope of Work, the research goals for this project were as follows:

13473/920031

1.

Continue investigations of Anomaly X. near the outer end of the south jetty.
This anomaly was recorded and investigated briefly during the earlier EH&A
projects discussed in the previous section of the chapter.

2.

Continue investigations of anomalies T and V along the south side of the
existing channel and of the scarp between the existing channel and Back Bay
in the vicinity of these anomalies. These anomalies and the scarp were
recorded and investigated briefly during the earlier projects referenced above.

3.

Conduct a controlled remote-sensing survey within Back Bay.

4.

Test Anomaly R for a cultural component earlier than the 1930s component
previously recorded. Anomaly R was recorded and investigated briefly during
the earlier projects referenced above.

5.

Bay. This railroad was recorded and investigated briefly during the project
under Delivery Order No. 0010 referenced above.

7.

Examine Back Bay for the presence of historical features and clues to the
formative processes which created the bay.

FIELD PROCEDURES
Although the specifics of the remote-sensing survey design varied between survey
areas, i.e. Back Bay and Anomaly X, some equipment and procedures used were common to each
area. These common factors are described immediately below. Also discussed are general
underwater investigation equipment and techniques employed during the project, as well as survey
procedures and/or equipment specific to each unique survey area.
General Remote Sensing Survey Procedures
Electronic equipment used over the course of the project included the following:
1.
a Geometrics Model G-866 proton precession magnetometer with marine
tow sensor
2.
an EG&G Model 260 image correcting side-scan sonar with dualfrequency 100/500 kilohertz (kHz) towfish
3.
a Datasonics CHIRP sub-bottom profiler system with color chart printer
and digital tape (DAT) recorder
4.
a Raytheon Model 719 recording fathometer
5.
a Geometrics Model G-856ax Memory Magnetometer as a base station
magnetometer
6.
a Lasertrak laser-based positioning system
7.
a Hewlett Packard (HP) 9816 computer system
8.
a CompuAdd 386SX laptop computer
Positioning and bathymetric data collection were provided by Chris Ransome of Chris
Ransome and Associates (CRA) of Houston, Texas. The CHIRP sub-bottom profiling system was
operated by Don Crowell of Datasonics, Inc., Cataumet, Mass. The magnetometers are owned by
EH&A and operated by EH&A personnel.
Continuous positioning of the survey vessel was maintained by CRA's Lasertrak
positioning system in conjunction with the HP computer running CRA's proprietary navigation

software. The tripod-mounted I..asertrak was established over a fixed datum on shore with known
coordinates and backsighted on a second fixed datum to establish true north. The fixed datum
used for I..asertrak positions, in each case a brass cap concreted into a jetty capstone, was chosen
based on proximity to the survey area and an unobstructed line-of-sight throughout survey area.
The I..asertrak operator, sighting through a small telescope mounted on the
instrument, manually tracked a survey prism mounted on the vessel. A laser beam emitted by the
instrument is reflected by the prism on the boat and used by the instrument to calculate the
distance from the instrument to the prism. The I..asertrak then transmitted this range reading,
along with a simultaneous azimuth reading, to the vessel via a small transmitter. This data was
received on the vessel and electronically transferred to the HP computer. The computer also
received data from the fathometer. As the position data was received, the navigation software
converted the range/azimuth data from the I..asertrak to a rectangular coordinate position for the
survey prism on the boat. All positions used during this project were based on the Texas State
Plane Coordinate System, South Zone. The position, updated each second during the survey, was
recorded in an ASCII file on floppy disc along with the concurrent bathymetric reading and the
time.
The computer guided the helmsman by displaying the proposed survey track on a
video monitor along with the actual track and position of the boat in relation to the proposed
track. The helmsman then adjusted the vessel heading either to port or starboard to correct any
deviation from the proposed survey track.
The software also sent position marks to the side-scan sonar. These appeared as
timed event marks on the strip chart, and were used for later coordination of targets on the chart
with the position of the survey vessel.
The G-866 magnetometer was operated independently from the other electronics (i.e.,
the magnetometer had no electrical or mechanical connection to other equipment) to minimize
noise generated by that equipment. The magnetometer was powered by two 12-volt (V) deep-cycle
marine batteries connected in series to provide 24 V. The marine sensor was trailed off the stern
of the vessel the minimum distance necessary to eliminate any magnetic influence from the boat
or its engines. As discussed below, that distance varied with the survey area.
The marine magnetometer was set for a one-second sample rate. The internal strip
chart was operated in the "narrow" format, which prints the time and magnetic value in addition
to the graph of the varying magnetic values. The dual range strip chart was set on the 50/500
setting. The time and corresponding magnetic value were transferred simultaneously to the laptop
computer connected directly to the magnetometer via the RS232 interface ports of each machine.
Data input to the computer was through EG&G Geometrics' MAGPAC software, which
continuously stores the information on floppy disc.
Diurnal variation in the local magnetic field was recorded on an EG&G Geometrics
G-856 magnetometer operating in AUTO (base station) mode. The G-856 was placed among
isolated dunes north of the north jetty with the sensor elevated approximately 1 m above the
ground atop an aluminum rod. The G-856 was set to sample the magnetic environment at 30-

13473!920031

second intervals. Occasional spikes in the base station data, generated by vehicles passing near the
dunes, were later edited out of the files.
The side-scan sonar transducer was suspended just below the keel of the survey vessel
approximately amidships off the port side. The speed log, used by the side-scan sonar to
automatically correct the scale of the sonar strip chart for variation in vessel speed, was also
streamed off the port side of the vessel. Throughout the survey, the vessel was operated on the
75 m range setting at a frequency of 500 kHz. Data from the sonar was printed on the integral
strip chart, which was annotated automatically via a timed signal (event mark) sent from the HP
computer. In this way, the side-scan data was correlated with the vessel's position by comparing
the navigational fix at any given time with the timed event marks appearing on the side-scan strip
charts.
The CHIRP sub-bottom profiler's transponder, which weighs over 300 lbs, was
suspended off the port side of the vessel within 1 m of the water's surface. Data collected by the
profiler was recorded digitally on DAT tapes. Simultaneously, a color strip chart was printed on
an ink-jet printer. This strip chart was manually annotated for correlation to vessel position along
any given survey track.
The transducer for the Raytheon fathometer was mounted in a well in the hull of the
survey vessel almost directly below the mount for the survey prism. The fathometer was calibrated
to record the actual depth below the water's surface rather than the depth below the transducer.
Water depths measured by the fathometer at one-second intervals were sent via a connecting cable
to the HP computer for correlation with navigational flXes and storage on floppy disc.
Vessel speed during the survey was maintained at approximately 4-4.5 knots. Set on
a one-second sample interval, the magnetometer recorded a reading approximately every 2 to 2.5 m
along each survey track.
General Target Investigation Procedures
Any remote-sensing target designated for examination was first relocated and its
position marked. Target relocation was based on positions measured from the magnetic contour
maps or calculated from strip-chart printouts. These positions were converted to polar coordinates
from a known survey datum on shore. A theodolite and Electronic Distance Meter (EDM) were
then positioned over the shore datum and a survey prism was mounted on a small boat to reflect
the infrared beam of the EDM. The EDM was operated in the TRACK mode to give a constantly
adjusted distance readout as the boat with the prism moved away from or toward the EDM. To
establish the position of any given target, the theodolite was set on the appropriate polar angle
from the shore datum to the target, thus establishing a line across the target along which the boat
could be guided by radioed course correction from the theodolite/EDM operator. When the EDM
indicated that the boat was the required distance from the survey instrument, a buoy was dropped
to mark the location of the target. Several passes were often made to refine the accuracy of the
buoy location.
The initial investigation of any submerged target detected by a remote-sensing device
is a visual examination by archaeological divers. As visibility in the local waters was very limited,

13473!920031

66

ESPEY, HUSTON & ASSOCIATES, INC.

the visual examination occasionally became a tactile examination. Divers first conducted a circle
search around the expected location of the target by tethering a 10 m line to a center pivot, usually
a heavy weight or screw anchor, and swam ever-expanding circles around center point, searching
by eye and touch. Often several circle searches were conducted in the vicinity of the target during
the attempt to find some surface expression of the target. If the target lay exposed on the bottom,
identification was relatively simple although not guaranteed; some objects are not identifiable even
if removed from the water and cleaned.

If the target was buried under bottom sediments, a number of approaches were used
to locate and examine it. A metal detector rigged for underwater use was employed in some cases
to pinpoint the location of metal objects. At other times, the sensor from the magnetometer was
maneuvered around the bottom to locate a buried metal object. A third approach, sometimes used
in combination with the metal detector or magnetometer, involved probing into the sediments to
locate the target or magnetic anomaly source. The probe was either a simple metal rod or a water
probe constructed of PVC pipe attached by a fire hose to a water pump on the surface. The water
probe was more efficient than a metal rod, since it allowed probing to greater depths through all
sediment types.
Once an object was located below the sediment, an attempt was made to remove the
loose sand overburden long enough to examine the object either visually or by touch. Excavation
of the overburden was accomplished by blowing the sand away with a high-powered water jet, by
sucking the sand away with a water induction dredge, or by using a propwash deflector on the dive
vessel to clear sand from the area. The main vessel used for support of underwater investigations
during this project was the Anomaly, chartered from the TAC, which has a large diameter
propwash deflector mounted on the stern (Figure 16).
Anomaly X Survey Procedures
Anomaly X (Figure 17) was originally recorded during EH&A's controlled magnetic
survey in 1989 (EH&A 1990). The goal of the current inquiry was to investigate Anomaly X to
establish its relationship, if any, with a vessel known to have wrecked in the vicinity in the
nineteenth century, the Congo, and to establish if the wreckage in this area, located by divers
during the initial investigation of the Anomaly X, extended into the dredged channel. As both subbottom and side-scan sonar data had previously been gathered in the vicinity of Anomaly X, only
the magnetometer was employed here during this project. Although not required to do so by the
Scope of Work, the Principal Investigator had hoped to use the CHIRP sub-bottom profiler system
at Anomaly X, but a delay in shipping made the equipment unavailable during the initial days of
the project.
Historical research conducted during preparation of the report on EH&A's 1990
archaeological investigations in the area (Hoyt et al. 1991) revealed a nineteenth century map
showing the wreck of a vessel, identified as the Congo, just offshore of the north end of Brazos
Island. A computer overlay map was generated using this map and the modern USGS topographic
map. The overlay map placed the Congo between the jetties and south of the channel. During
the proposal stage of this project, Anomaly X and the Congo were thought to be spatially distinct,
' with the Congo situated somewhat further west in the channel. Originally, two survey blocks were
proposed, each covering an area some 300 m long (east/west) and 200 m wide, over the location

of Anomaly X and the location of the Congo. However, further comparison of the overlay map
and the magnetic contour map produced from the initial survey of the area (EH&A 1990,
Figure 12; Hoyt et al. 1991, Figure 6) revealed that the two were in very close proximity. With this
revelation, a single survey block was determined adequate to cover the area of interest. The
mapped relationship of the Congo and Anomaly X is discussed in greater detail and illustrated in
Chapter V of this report.
The rectangular survey block defined for the Anomaly X/Congo area was 200 m
north/south by 300 m east/west centered on State Plane coordinates E 2,444,800, N 147,200
(Figure 18). Survey track spacing of the original survey in 1989 was 18 m with the magnetometer
set for a sample interval of one second. The current survey design called for a track spacing of
8 m if wind and sea conditions permitted. In the event, a track spacing of 9 m was used, providing
a total of 22 survey tracks running parallel to the long axis of the survey area (east/west). The
lines were numbered consecutively, with number 00 being the northernmost line and 21 the
southernmost line. The last line actually intersected the jetty and could not be run full length.
The Lasertrak positioning system was used during the survey following the general
procedures described above. The Lasertrak was mounted over COE datum 2+000 on the north
jetty at State Plane coordinates E 1,442,044.7, N 147,927.3 and backsighted on COE datum 1 +531.8
at coordinates E 2,441,600.98, N 148,066.14.
The vessel used during the Anomaly X survey was CRA's 6.7-m fiberglass Bayliner,
the Hydrohawk, powered by a gasoline engine with inboard/outdrive. The survey prism was
mounted atop the cabin well forward of amidships. The magnetometer sensor was towed well
astern of the transom to minimize interference from the boat. The distance from the prism to the
center of the magnetometer sensor was 30.4 m. This distance, known as offset or layback, was
later used to calculate a corrected position for the sensor as compared to the prism on the boat's
cabin.
Back Bay Survey Procedures
Although the waters of Back Bay were briefly investigated by divers and a coarse
magnetometer and fathometer survey was conducted during EH&A's 1990 project (Hoyt et al.
1991), a detailed, controlled, multi-component remote-sensing survey was felt necessary to further
define the potential for extant historic resources within the bay. To this end, the survey design
included the CHIRP sub-bottom profiler, the Raytheon fathometer, the Geometrics magnetometer
and the EG&G side-scan sonar, all coordinated by the Lastertrak and its associated computer
hardware/software positioning and navigation system.
The Back Bay survey area was defined by two points forming an east/west baseline,
from which all survey tracks were run due south (Figure 19). The baseline was nearly parallel to
the centerline of the ship channel but lay just outside to the south of the channel's design limits.
The survey baseline was defined at the west end by State Plane coordinates E 2,439,500, N 147,000
and at its east end by coordinates E 2,442,000, N 147,000. The southern end of the bay is at a
northing coordinate of approximately 145,300. The resulting survey block formed a roughly
triangular area bound by the south jetty to the east, the sandy beach to the west and the deep
water of the channel to the north.

MAGNETOMETER SENSOR TRACKS,
BACK BAY SURVEY AREA

ESPEY, HUSTON & ASSOCIATES, INC.

The proposed survey transects within Back Bay were spaced 7.6 m (25 ft) apart along
the east/west baseline. These tracks were numbered consecutively from west to east starting at line
00 and ending at line 99. Survey track length varied considerably, being quite short near the ends
of the baseline and longer near the center where they penetrated deeper into the bay. All tracks
were run from north to south to provide ample maneuvering room for the survey vessel to get on
line before crossing the baseline into the survey area. The magnetometer sensor was towed 22.4 m
behind the boat to minimize interference; total sensor offset from the prism was 25.65 m. The
layback of the sensor and the necessity of towing into the shore meant that a zone of shallow water
adjacent the shore could not be surveyed, as the boat had to abort each track before running onto
the beach or jetty. This procedure left the magnetometer sensor still well away from shore at the
end of each track. The unsurveyed zone was narrower near the northwestern and northeastern
edges of the bay, where the boat could make a more gradual tum to parallel the shore or jetty, and
widest at the southern tip of the bay, where the boat had to tum sharply or even reverse to exit
the shoal waters.
During the survey of Back Bay, the Lasertrak was stationed over COE datum 1 +000
on the north jetty at State Plane coordinates E 2,441,136.26, N 148,324.69 and backsighted on COE
datum 1 +531.8 at coordinates E 2,441,600.98, N 148,066.14.
The initial vessel used during the survey of Back Bay was CRA's Hydrohawk with only
the CHIRP sub-bottom profiler, the fathometer, and the magnetometer onboard. The CHIRP
system is newly developed and had not been previously used by EH&A The unexpected bulk of
the CHIRP sensor made a reduction in onboard equipment necessary. Therefore, the side-scan
sonar was initially omitted to reduce crowding on the boat, with the intention of operating the sidescan sonar after the sub-bottom survey was complete. After two days of survey in Back Bay,
engine trouble on the Hydrohawk forced a shift of the remote sensing equipment to the other
project vessel, the Anomaly, chartered from the TAC. To expedite the sub-bottom survey, only
the CHIRP system was mobilized aboard the Anomaly. The expense of leasing the CHIRP, more
than twice the daily rate of other sub-bottom profilers, limited the time available and thus the
coverage. Only alternate transects within the survey area were covered (Figure 20), effectively
producing a transect spacing of 15.24 m (50 ft). Two additional, unscheduled transects were run,
both parallel to the ship channel along the north edge of Back Bay. These two transects were
labelled Ll, running from west to east, and Ll, running from east to west.
After completing the sub-bottom profiler survey aboard the Anomaly, demobilizing
the CHIRP system and getting it and its operator on the road, the EG&G 260 side-scan sonar was
mobilized on the same vessel. The side-scan sonar was operated on only every fourth track within
the survey area (Figure 21 ), starting with line 20, as the 75-m operational range provided sufficient
overlap between transects to image the entire bay bottom. In addition, three unscheduled tracks
were run with the side-scan sonar: two lines parallel to the channel along the north side of Back
Bay starting as far west as Anomaly R and extending as far east as Anomaly X, and one line
starting in the northwest comer of the bay, running down into the bay and back out at the
northeast comer of the bay.
The magnetometer and bathymetric surveys were not completed until the Hydrohawk
returned after engine repairs, some ten days after completing the side-scan sonar survey. Both the
magnetometer and fathometer were operated on all survey tracks starting at track 12 (Figures 19

and 22). Tracks with numbers lower than 12 were not run due to the extreme shoal water and
submerged obstacles in the area.

In addition to the marine swvey, a small terrestrial magnetometer survey was
conducted on the western beach of Back Bay in order to further define a series of anomalies under
the bay which appeared to extend under the shore. For this survey, a baseline was established on
the beach approximately parallel to the shoreline (Figure 19). The baseline was 175 m (575 ft)
long. The southeast end of this baseline was at State Plane coordinates E 2,439,777.2, N 146,108.9.
The northeast end was at E 2,439,365.6, N 146,509.4. Survey tracks were spaced every 7.6 m (25
ft) along this baseline, creating 24 tracks. Using a hand compass, the tracks were aligned due east
(magnetic), toward the bay. The angle of the tracks with the baseline created a distance between
tracks of 4.5 m (15 ft). The baseline was extended 30 m (100 ft) toward the northwest and an
additional four tracks were laid out along this extension, parallel to the original tracks and at the
same spacing. These four tracks extended both east and west of the baseline extension.
Only the Geometrics G-856 magnetometer was used during this survey. Diurnal
corrections were determined unnecessary as the survey was conducted within a two-hour period.
The magnetic environment was recorded while carrying the magnetometer in a chest mount with
the sensor on an aluminum staff. The magnetometer operator, beginning on the baseline, paced .
off 7.6-m segments along each track and activated the magnetometer at the end of each segment
to record the magnetic reading. On those tracks extending eastward from the baseline, the
magnetometer operator continued along the track into the bay waters until the water was too deep
to wade. This procedure meant that some tracks were longer than others, depending on the de pth
of the water along the track. The data collected from this shore survey was later combined with
the Back Bay survey data to produce an overall magnetic contour map.
Historic Shipwreck Investigation (Back Bay Wreck)
The overlay of a map dated to 1867 and a modem USGS quad placed a shipwreck in
the extreme northwest comer of what is now Back Bay. For the purpose of this study, this wreck
is referred to as the Back Bay Wreck. This area was determined to be in the surf line along the
Back Bay beach, an area known from previous investigations to be magnetically 'active'. To test
this area for buried remains of a shipwreck, the water probe, described above, was used
(Figure 23). The probe in this instance was a PVC pipe 3 m long and 2.54 cm in diameter. A line
was established in the edge of the surf by placing two vertical pipes in the beach, approximately
5 m from each other and extending several feet in the air, to serve as range poles. The probe
operator could follow a straight line as he advanced along the beach by keeping the two range
poles perfectly aligned, one behind the other, in his line of sight.
Approximately every 1 to 1.5 m along the beach, the probe was inserted into the sand
to its full 3 m length, and often further, by pushing part of the attached hose into the hole behind
the probe. This probe line continued to the northwest along the beach, across the stone dike and
into the shallow waters along the south side of the channel, a total distance of approximately
158 m. A second line of probes was completed in the same manner approximately 10 m to the
west and parallel to the first. At a later date, a third line of probes was completed beginning some
15 m east of the original line and diverging slightly toward the east at the northern end. A fourth

line was completed parallel and 10 m east of the third line. The results of this investigation are
discussed in Chapter V. The positions of the probe lines are illustrated in Figure 35.
Anomalies T and V Investigations
Anomalies T and V (Figure 24) were initially located during the first EH&A magnetic
survey of the Brownsville Entrance Channel (EH&A 1990) and further investigated during the
subsequent project (Hoyt et al. 1991 ). After processing the magnetometer data collected during
this project, a preliminary magnetic contour map of the Back Bay, including the vicinity of
anomalies T and V, was produced in the field. By comparing this map with the side-scan
stripcharts, dive locations were selected for further investigations of these anomalies. the
anomalies were relocated by dropping a buoy at the appropriate State Plane coordinates and
verifying the location with a magnetometer.
As these anomalies lie in deep water where strong currents often flow, visibility was
restricted and diving was limited. The divers conducted circle searches in the vicinity, examined
objects found exposed on the bottom, and employed both the water probe and the water induction
dredge to probe below the sediments. The results of these efforts are discussed in Chapter V.

Anomaly R Procedures
Anomaly R (Figure 25) was originally recorded during EH&A's 1989 magnetometer
survey (EH&A 1990) and further investigated during the 1990 project (Hoyt et al. 1991).
Magnetometer survey of Anomaly R was not required under the COE Scope of Work for this
project. The earlier investigations showed that the area was associated with the wharf at the
beginning of a railroad built in the 1930s during construction of the south jetty. In an attempt to
determine if an earlier cultural component could be positively identified for the location, five test
excavations were made among the submerged pilings which remain at this location. Four of these
test excavations were made using the propwash deflector on theAnomaly, and the fifth excavation,
actually a trench some 10 m long and 1 m wide, was made using the water induction dredge. See
Chapter V for the results of these investigations.
Scarp Investigation Procedures
The scarp between Back Bay and the deep waters of the ship channel is nearly vertical
at the eastern end of the bay and flattens out toward the west end. Divers worked in pairs, drifting
with the current, to examine the shoulder, face and toe of the scarp by vision and touch. The
divers, attached by a 2-m tether at the wrist, worked during an incoming tide and the concurrent
incoming current. This timing was an intentional safety factor, allowing any divers caught in strong
tidal currents, which occur often in the channel, to be carried inland rather than out between the
jetties. Starting toward the eastern end of the scarp, the divers swam the scarp, zig-zagging up and
down its face, looking for artifacts protruding from or laying at the toe of the scarp, and feeling
for evidence of sand lenses which might be eroding out of the clay of the scarp face, a possible
indicator of subsidence in Back Bay. The results of this investigation are discussed in Chapter V.

Data Processing and Analysis
Remote sensing data collected from the various electronic equipment in the field
requires certain manipulation and analysis to create a useful end product. To produce a magnetic
contour map of the Back Bay and Anomaly X survey areas, several processing steps were
necessary.
The raw magnetometer data collected by the G-866 magnetometer and stored on
floppy disc was first corrected for diurnal variations based on the data collected by the G-856 base
station magnetometer. Since the base station magnetometer is stationary, any magnetic variation
in its collected data is attributed to natural events such as long-term diurnal variation or short-term
solar flares. The raw marine data must be corrected to account for this natural variation. In order
to do this, the internal clocks of both magnetometers must be synchronized prior to the survey.
Since the raw data were collected at 1-second intervals and the base station data were collected
at 30-second intervals, base station values for the intervening seconds must be interpolated prior
to correction. Once a magnetic value is calculated for each second, the appropriate mathematics
for diurnally correcting the raw data can be carried out. EH&A uses a computer program written
in-house to perform the correction.
Another EH&A computer program performs several functions necessary for
magnetometer data analysis. This program merges the position data, recorded by CRA and stored
on a separate disc, with the diurnally corrected magnetometer data. Merging is a simple procedure
based on comparison of the time of each magnetometer reading on a given survey track with the
time of each recorded vessel position on that same track. When times match, the magnetometer
and position data are combined and stored in a new file. Matching by time requires that the
internal clocks of the magnetometer and the navigation system be synchronized prior to the
beginning of the survey.
The newly created file, which also contains the bathymetric data for each position as
recorded by CRA, is then manipulated to correct for the offset of the magnetometer sensor from
the boat (actually from the point where the survey prism is mounted to the boat). This correction
is accomplished using the vessel heading and the sensor offset distance and direction from the
position of the prism to calculate the actual position for the magnetometer sensor at any given
second. Two disc files are created at this stage, one containing only the corrected magnetometer
sensor coordinates and the diurnally corrected magnetic reading for those coordinates. The second
file contains the original vessel coordinates and the water depth at that location. Each of these
files is in an ASCII format containing three columns, referred to as the mag position file and the
depth position file.
Contouring of both the bathymetric and magnetometer data was done using
SURFER•, terrain modelling software developed by Golden Software, Inc. of Golden, Colorado.
Due to the large amount of magnetic data collected and the internal limits of SURFER, only every
other track of magnetic data was contoured in the field. After returning to the office, the updated
Version 4 of SURFER, which accepted the entire data set, was purchased. The contour maps of
the magnetic and bathymetric data collected during this project and illustrated in this report, were
produced by first contouring the data in SURFER. The contoured data was then transferred to

13473/920031

another software package, Microstation" PC, a powerful CAD program, for incorporation with
maps produced from previous reports, and final production of the illustrations for this report.
Strip charts for the CHIRP sub-bottom profiler and the side-scan sonar were visually
examined for targets. Much of the CHIRP data printed in the field was unacceptable. As the data
was recorded digitally, however, it can be post-processed to produce cleaner printouts. With that
intention, the digital tapes with the CHIRP data were retained at the end of the survey by
Datasonics' CHIRP operator and taken to their offices in Cataumet, Mass. for post-processing.
As of this writing, only two of the four DAT tapes containing CHIRP data have been postprocessed, about half of the data, and Datasonics personnel report that the other two tapes may
be unreadable. No change in the status of the matter is expected.

V. RESULTS
The following discussion of the results of archaeological investigations is not arranged
strictly by the task breakdown specified in the Scope of Work. Where tasks were closely linked
or had common goals, particularly the various tasks involving Back Bay, they are discussed as a
group rather than individually.
INVESTIGATIONS OF ANOMALY X
Anomaly X was originally recorded during an earlier magnetometer survey conducted by EH&A
(1990). Archaeological divers subsequently investigated the location and identified the source of
the anomaly as a group of five metal plates lodged between the granite capstones at the east end
of the south jetty (Hoyt et al. 1991). These plates, each approximately 3 m long, were wedged
vertically among the rocks. The position of the plates exposes them to the rapid channel currents
which have eroded them until they are paper-thin in places. They appeared to be hull plates but
positively identifiable characteristics were absent.
During the preparation of the technical report on EH&A's 1990 examination of the
source of Anomaly X, archival research conducted at various National Archive locations in and
around Washington, D.C. brought to light an 1881 map, titled "Coast of Texas off Padre Island",
bearing the location of a wreck identified as the Congo. From a preliminary assessment, this wreck
appeared to be in the vicinity of Anomaly X. The original map was housed at the National Ocean
Service Hydrographic Archive in Rockville, Maryland, which does not have facilities for
photocopying these large format maps. EH&A's archival researcher received permission to
photograph the documents, however. The map was photographed in sections due to limitations
of the photographic equipment available.
The main section of the 1881 map shows bathymetric data for the approach to the
pass. An inset in the corner of the map contains bathymetric data for the channel and the
anchorage area inside the pass. The shoreline used as a base for the main section of the 1881
map, however, was copied from an earlier map of 1867. The original 1867 map (Figure 10) was
also located in the archives and was computer digitized to produce an overlay map of the 1867
shoreline with the modern shoreline (Appendix A). When the 1881 map was computer digitized
to place the position of the Congo on a modern map, the 1867 shoreline was used for alignment.
During this process, the Congo was mistakenly attributed to the 1867 map rather than the 1881
map which used the 1867 shoreline. However, the position of the Congo was determined to be
close enough to Anomaly X that both could be covered with a single survey block.
After completion of the magnetic survey, a new magnetic contour map (Figure 26)
was produced in the field to guide further investigations. This 1991 magnetic contour map shows
far greater detail than the 1989 map (Figure 17) due to the closer survey track spacing (9 m vs.
18 m) and finer contour intervals (5 gammas vs. 10 gammas). Based on this new map, three
locations were chosen for investigation: one at a magnetic peak toward the center of the channel
(Figure 26, Point Xl ), a second among a series of peaks near the outer end of the jetty (Figure 26,
Point X2) and a third amidst the highest concentration of magnetic contour lines (Figure 26,
Point X3). The State Plane coordinates for these points were measured on the magnetic contour

map and they were relocated on the water using a theodolite/EDM set over survey datum 3+500
on the south jetty.
Over the course of the field project, several attempts were made to dive on the three
designated locations for Anomaly X. The environmental conditions at the end of the south jetty,
however, combine to create an area of rough seas even during generally calm weather. The
combination of east or southeast winds, north flowing longshore currents, swells rolling in from
the east, and rapid tidal currents between the jetties produces dangerous diving conditions. All
attempts to dive on locations X2 and X3 were thwarted by the sea conditions.
The heavy seas just inside the outer end of the south jetty attenuate rapidly as one
moves away from the jetty, making diving less hazardous and thus allowing archaeologists to
examine location Xl. The archaeological divers employed both visual and mechanical methods.
Initially, circle searches were conducted in the vicinity of the buoyed point. Visibility was relatively
good for this area, approximately 1 m, allowing the divers to see the bottom. Divers located a
granite block approximately 1.3 m square and over a meter tall, probably a remnant of jetty
construction. A manila hawser, approximately 10 centimeters (cm) in diameter and several meters
long, lay on the bottom loosely encircling the granite block. A steel cable, approximately 1 inch
in diameter and of unknown length, also was imbedded in the bottom.
A water probe was used to determine the nature and depth of the deposits at this
location. The bottom was determined to be dense clay with imbedded shell. The water probe,
normally a very effective instrument for penetrating bottom sediments, was unable to penetrate
more than 1 m into the dense clay. No obstructions indicating possible cultural resources were
encountered. The water depth at this location was approximately 16.7 m near the time of low tide.
The design depth of the channel is 13.7 m below mean low water (MLW). Taking into account
the inaccuracies of the fathometers worn by divers and the tidal variation, the bottom of the
channel appears to be at or below the design depth of the channel. No appreciable loose
sediments overlay the basal clay. From the evidence gathered during the dives at this point, the
magnetic peak which appears at location Xl results from the steel cable on the bottom and not
from any exposed or buried cultural resources.
No evidence of the Congo or any other culturally significant historic wreck was found
within the design limits of the channel. The steel plates among the jetty stones remain undated.
During analysis of the data upon return to the field in preparation for this report, a
second hydrographic map, titled "Brazos Harbor, Texas', which is a copy of the original inset on
the 1881 map discussed above, was examined more closely. This map, as with the inset, does not
have the shorelines of either Brazos or South Padre islands but does show the Brazos Harbor Light
and the Life Saving Station. By aligning this map with the same features on other maps, a new
position for the Congo was established. This new position was thought to be more precise than
the original, based primarily on the scale of the map inset which allows for greater accuracy. In
addition, the alignment of the 1867 map with the modem shoreline was adjusted (see the
discussion below) based on a re-examination of our original assumption regarding alignment points.
The combination of realigning the 1867 shoreline, which was the base for the 1881 map, and
replotting the position of the Congo from the more accurate 1881 inset map, moved the estimated

1347319'7...()()31

86

position of the wreck from the proximity of Anomaly X to beneath the beach on the south side
of the south jetty (Figure 27).
The two latest editions of the USGS quad map for this area (Port Isabel, Texas; USGS
7.5' Series, 1955, photorevised 1983 and photorevised 1970) indicate a wreck just inside the outer
end of the south jetty at the location of Anomaly X. The wreck was probably on the original 1955
edition as it is not indicated as a photorevision on the 1970 edition. Whether or not this wreck
location dates back to the 1881 map showing the wreck of the Congo is problematic but doubtful
as maps subsequent to that of 1881 (e.g. 1882, 1884, 1887 (Figure 12) and 1910 (Figure 13)) do
not show the wreck. The 1882 map indicates a jetty constructed near the estimated location of the
Congo in the 1881 map, yet does not note a wreck in the vicinity. In sum, the wreck indicated on
the modem quad map is not considered to be the wreck of the Congo. A local dive store operator
familiar with wrecks in the area was questioned about the jetty wreck but was unaware of its
existence. He stated that he does not dive at this location due to the hazards of rough seas and
constant boat traffic.
Archival research on the Congo was conducted in Brownsville, at the Oliveria
Memorial Library on the campus of Texas Southmost University. At the suggestion of the archival
librarian, the records of the Consular correspondence were examined as well as microfilms of the
Daily Ranchero, a Matamoros newspaper. At the time, the wreck was still mistakenly attributed
to the 1867 map rather than 1881. Therefore, archival sources were only examined up to 1868.
No mention of a vessel named Congo was encountered. During preparation of this report, archival
research was conducted at the TAC office, and at the University of Texas library system,
particularly the Barker Texas History Center. A discussion of the possible identity of the Congo
based on that research follows in the general discussion of wharfs, wrecks and railroads.
INVESTIGATIONS OF BACK BAY
Remote Sensing Survey Results
Magnetometer Survey
The magnetic data gathered during the remote sensing survey is illustrated in
Figure 28 as a contour map with a 5 gamma contour interval. The magnetic picture of the bay is
dominated by the linear path of the buried railroad running from the southeast comer to the
northwest comer. At the northwest comer, the dense magnetic anomalies extend onto the beach,
where the shore survey was conducted, and directly to the north toward the channel. Other dense
anomalies can be seen in the vicinity of anomalies T and V. A number of dense but spatially
smaller anomalies are scattered about the main body of the bay.
An unusual linear anomaly extends from the vicinity of Anomaly T to the eastern side
of the survey block. Comparison with the bathymetric map of the bay produced from the field data
(Figure 29) shows that this anomaly corresponds with the scarp separating Back Bay from the
deeper waters of the channel. This linear anomaly is generated by the physical variation of the
landforrn.

DEPTHS ADJUSTED TO MEAN LOW WATER (MLW)

BACK BAY BATHYMETRY

The lack of magnetic contours adjacent the shore and jetty results from the inability
to pass through the shallow waters with the survey vessel. Also, the beach line varies along the
southwestern shore of the Bay; the beach shown was measured during the latter part of 1990 and
may have migrated somewhat by the time of this survey in August 1991.
Side-scan Sonar Survey
The side-scan sonar was of limited use within Back Bay as nearly all potential targets
which are large enough for the sonar to resolve, even at the 500 kHz frequency, are buried in the
loose sand covering the bottom of the bay. No magnetic anomalies within the bay could definitely
be associated with side-scan sonar targets.
The side-scan strip charts in the areas where objects are known to be exposed, such
as the submerged wharf pilings in the northwest comer of the bay (generally referred to as the
"piling grid"), are indeterminate for the most part, as images are indistinct. The best image of the
piling grid is illustrated in Figure 30. This strip chart is the entirety of survey track 24. On the
starboard side, near the middle of the track, is a dense area of small black spots. The spots do not
appear as orderly as the pilings of the old wharf are known to be, but the approximate location and
areal coverage are correct for the piling grid. At one comer of the grid is a round object
approximately 1 m in diameter with a dark line extending from the object toward the southwest
for about 7.5 m. This object is believed to be an old, crushed buoy with part of its anchor chain
still attached. This buoy was observed by divers in approximately the same juxtaposition with the
piling grid as the round object in the strip chart. Barely visible on the strip chart, at the
westernmost comer of the piling grid, is a linear object about 8 m long which may be one of the
railroad rails known to be in this comer of the piling grid.
At the start of the track 24 strip chart, at least one target, and possibly several smaller
targets, can be seen on the port side. This target is in the vicinity of Anomaly T and discussed in
the appropriate section below.
Sub-bottom Profiler Survey
Although the CHIRP sub-bottom profiler by Datasonics, Inc., has only recently been
developed beyond the prototype stage, it was used for this survey based on a recommendation from
an archaeologist who used the prototype system very successfully in similar shallow water
conditions. Based on that reference and technical information supplied by the manufacturer, the
Principal Investigator on this project hoped to be able to discern buried objects as small as the
railroad rails previously located under the Back Bay sediments.
In operation, the output from the CHIRP system proved to be less useful than
anticipated. The CHIRP system has three forms of output: the sub-bottom profile is shown
directly on a built-in, color video monitor, the image on the video screen is printed on a color
paint-jet printer and the digitized profile information is recorded on a magnetic (DAT) tape. No
identifiable targets are visible within the sediments on the profile printouts. Some possible sonic
shadows (a linear blank space on the printout extending downward from an object in the sediments
blocking the sonar waves) can be seen but none can positively be associated with the image of an

object in the sediments which might cause a shadow. Close examination of survey tracks known
to cross existing railroad rails has failed to produce a positive indication of those tracks (Figure 31 ).
When operating properly, The CHIRP system did clearly show the sedimentary
layering under the bay. Few of the track printouts made in the field, however, were clear enough
to see the layering. To improve the printouts, the four DAT tapes on which the field data were
recorded were taken to the Datasonics office for post-processing. The final images produced
during this procedure are much clearer than the original images and the sedimentary layering is
obvious.
Based on the sedimentary layering in the sub-bottom profiles, the formation of Back
Bay seems more likely due to erosion than subsidence. The layers all appear to be level and
parallel under the bay. If the bay were formed by subsidence caused by erosion of sand lenses
from between clay layers, one would expect to see evidence of sedimentary layers collapsing onto
each other. Such evidence is lacking in these printouts.
Experience on this and previous projects in the area has shown that a strong current
travels around the perimeter of the bay. The direction of the current appears to change with the
direction of tidal flow between the jetties. This current would be a powerful erosional force within
the bay. Massive objects such as railroad rails could be expected to settle directly down into the
sediments. Smaller objects, however, might easily be scattered by the current as it scours away the
shore. An aerial photograph taken in 1939 (Hoyt et al. 1991:Figure 47) shows that Back Bay was
fully formed by that time, less than five years after jetty completion. It seems likely that the bay
formed as it has due to the shape of the jetty, which curves sharply inshore at its inner end, and
the presence of the stone dike, apparently built prior to the jetty, at the northwest corner of the
bay. A similar bay exists at the inner end of the north jetty. As the authors are neither
geomorphologists nor engineers, the above discussion is simply speculation based on field
observations and limited remote sensing data.
Bathymetric Survey
The survey within the bay and extending into the adjacent channel area confirmed the
conclusions drawn from the rough survey conducted by EH&A in 1990 (Hoyt et al. 1991). The
bathymetric map (Figure 29), plotted with a 1-ft contour interval, clearly shows the nearly vertical
scarp along the north side of the bay. Within the main body of the bay, the depth is relatively
constant, with a gradual slope up toward shore. The depths have been adjusted to MLW,
producing a minimum depth in the northwest corner of the bay of + 2 ft MLW. A low ridge is
visible extending from northeast to southwest near the center of the bay with a corresponding
shallow depression along the south side of the ridge. As with the magnetic contour map, missing
data along the shore and in the northwest corner of the bay is due to the inability to traverse this
area with the boat for fear of grounding or striking a submerged object.
The bathymetric survey of Back Bay is very accurate for the purpose intended, which
was to provide a general idea of the bottom contours at the time of the survey. However, the data
collected should not be considered accurate to the highest geophysical survey standards primarily
because, as a time saving measure, the fathometer was calibrated only once each day rather than
several times per day as might be required on a more rigorous bathymetric survey. In addition,

changes in water depth can be expected from normal erosion and sedimentation processes active
in the Bay since the time of the survey.
Submerged Railroad Investigations
During the fall of 1990, EH&A archaeologists discovered a set of railroad tracks
buried in the sediments of Back Bay at the north end of Brazos Island. Nearly 549 m (1800 ft) of
track has been discovered thus far. The track has been traced by divers for most of the distance
across Back Bay. The various archaeological test locations along the railroad, along with others
in and near Back Bay, are illustrated in Figure 32 and listed in Table 1. Sections that have not yet
been investigated by divers have, for the most part, been mapped by a magnetometer survey. The
magnetic contour map, with a contour interval of 20 gamma to provide clarity over the 5 gamma
contour interval of Figure 28, is also included on Figure 32; this demonstrates the relationship
between test locations, objects discovered and the magnetic environment.
The buried railroad track enters Back Bay from beneath the south jetty along the
southeastern side of the bay. How far the track extends beneath the island east of the jetty has
yet to be determined. The track curves gradually to the northwest as it crosses the bay. Near the
western margin of the bay it seems to branch in two directions. One branch of the track
terminates beneath the beach along the bay's west side. A second branch continues to the
northwest comer of Back Bay toward a stone dike. The dike, probably constructed along the north
shore of Brazos Island in 1927 (Alperin 1977:141), now extends into Back Bay. The end of the
rails in the direction of the dike has not been verified.
Most of the iron rails found in Back Bay remain in an upright position and are evenly
spaced, as if still operational despite the fact that they have settled from 2 to 3.0 m below sea level.
Nearly all of the rails remain fastened to neighboring rails, forming a continuous line of track.
Curiously, EH&A archaeologists have located only one crosstie and one railroad spike1 during two
seasons of fieldwork despite extensive diving and excavations along the track. From the absence
of both spikes and ties, the crossties appear to have been intentionally removed from beneath the
rails prior to inundation of the track.

General Diver Investigations
Based on the remote sensing survey data and features or areas of interest previously
located within Back Bay, several diver investigations and test excavations were made at selected
spots. These locations, identified in Figure 32 and Table 1, are discussed in this section.
Piling Grid
This regularly spaced grid of pilings (Figure 15) was originally discovered in the
northwest comer of Back Bay during EH&A's 1990 project (Hoyt et al. 1991 ). These pilings

Additional spikes were assumed present in the extant crosstie, although this was not verified.

apparently represent the remains of a wharf built along an old shoreline. In the report on the
earlier project, the following description of this feature was given.
These pilings formed a grid some 35 m long by 10 m wide with
approximately 2 m between pilings. The long axis of the grid is
northeast. Water depth over the pilings varies from just over 1 m at the
southwest end to 3-4 m at the northeast end. The pilings protrude from
the bottom sediment less than 0.5 m at the shallow end but as much as
1 m toward the northern comer. The pilings themselves are badly
degraded... Magnetic anomalies detected in the vicinity of the pilings are
probably associated with the modem debris, such as steel cable, observed
among and near the pilings (Hoyt et al. 1991:103).
Further investigation of these pilings was determined necessary to try to establish their
temporal provenience. To this end, several dives were expended on the grid during the current
project. Visual examinations among the pilings revealed a multitude of small metallic concretions,
old bricks, modem bottles, fishing lines and miscellaneous modem trash. Two railroad rails were
observed laying among the pilings (Figure 32, items 15 and 16).
Using the water induction dredge and the water jet probe, sediments around the base
of the pilings were tested. The loose sand typical of the bay bottom proved to be less than 10 cm
deep among the pilings. The dense clay underlaying the sand proved to be sterile in the test
locations. A single glass bottle (Figure 33A) was collected from the tests at the northeast end of
the grid. This bottle is molded, light green glass with a pronounced shoulder, thick neck and an
applied lip. Research to date has not located a dateable parallel to this bottle although the
diagnostic characteristics listed below indicate a probable date between 1850 and 1870.
Bottle Form: straight sided, sloping shoulders, long neck
Dimensions: height, 27.1 cc; height to top of shoulder (base of neck)
19.7 cm; base diameter, 7.6 cm
Color: bottle green
Base: post bottom mold. no pontil
Lip Finish: laid on ring
Method of manufacture: two part mold indicated by 2 vertical seams
(obliterated at the neck) • bubbles, blemishes and unevenness may
indicate blown molding
Markings: Embossed 'F on base
Date range: 1850s-1870s
Basis of dating:
1)
Two part mold is post 1810 (Toulouse 1969).
2)
Ricketts 3 piece mold/lettered base introduced 1821 (McKearen and
Wilson 1978:188,219)
3)
Two piece mold with post base pre-1858 (Toulouse 1969:530,582)
4)
Non-pontil holding devices, such as snap case, introduced post-1850
(Spellman 1983:10-11), McKearen and Wilson 1978:216) - empontilling
obsolete by 1870 (Toulouse 1969)

Seams around neck oblitereated by finishing tool - first U.S. patented
finishing tool by Stone in 1856 although imported finishing tools were in
use prior to this time (Toulouse 1%9) - finishing tools were used in the
U.S. between 1840 and 1870.
Laid-on rough, irregularly-shaped neck rings date to 1830-1870. During
the 1840-1870s, rough crude rings were common, a result of using the
furnace opening to provide heat for applying glass bead. Insufficient
heat caused the bottle to soften (Toulouse 1%9:534). After 1880,
roughly applied collar finishes disappeared with the introduction of
improved lipping tools and use of the 'glory hole', a special furnace for
reheating bottles during finishing
Embossed base marking were common at Fort Union during the period
1863-1891 (Wilson 1981:113; Toulouse 1%8a:137, 1968b:204)

This piling grid appears to be a catch basin for modem trash. Except for occasional
historic bricks typical of the Brazos Santiago Depot area and the two railroad rails, virtually all of
the identifiable objects seen among the pilings were modem. Fishing boats carrying large groups
of tourists were observed anchoring in the vicinity of the pilings on a daily basis. Fish hooks and
monofilament line were common within the grid. Undoubtedly, many bottles and other debris have
been thrown overboard in this vicinity over the years. As stated in EH&A's earlier reports on
previous investigations in this vicinity, Back Bay has traditionally been used as a dumping ground
for local commercial boats. Much of the discarded debris appears to have come to rest among
these pilings.
Based on the field data and historic overlay maps produced for this report, these
pilings most likely represent the Government Wharf, visible in Figure 11. This wharf, built in
1868, is discussed in the section on Wharfs, Wrecks and Railroads below.
Magnetic Anomaly Testing
Several locations were chosen for testing based on the preliminary magnetic contour
map produced in the field at the completion of the survey. These locations are identified in Table
1 and indicated in Figure 32. At almost every location, the source of the anomaly was determined
to be railroad rail. The major exception to this was a set of three objects found buried in the sand
at location 17. Excavation with the water induction dredge located a large pry bar, a small boat
davit and a metal rod laying among a scatter of five red and tan bricks typical of the Brazos
Santiago Depot area. Figure 34 show the objects arranged as they were found in the sediments.
None of these items were laying on the clay substrate below the sand, but were suspended
approximately 0.5 m down in the sand layer. The depth of the sand at this location is
undetermined.

K.

The date of these objects is problematic. The pry bar is typical of those used to
manipulate rails during railroad construction or repair and thus may be contemporary with the
buried railroad near which it lies. However, pry bars of this type are still common today and are
put to multiple uses requiring a stout lever. The Principal Investigator has seen nearly identical
pry bars recovered from shipwrecks as far away as Bermuda.

appearance. Relating this information to archaeological observations has been a slow and
painstaking process, one that is far from finished. Nevertheless, in the following pages the authors
attempt to correlate archaeological discoveries with historic features on Brazos Island.
The locations of buried and submerged historic features are known from archival
cartographic sources. The identity of many charted historic features has been surmised from
written historic documents. Many historic maps of Brazos Island were collected from the National
Archives and analyzed by Hoyt et al. (1991). Selected maps were digitized and overlaid to scale
on a modern map of Brazos Island. The registration of these overlays, relative both to one
another and to the modern world, has been re-assessed and improved since the publication of Hoyt
et al. (1991). A corrected map with five historic shoreline overlays is illustrated as Figure 36 and
individual overlays of eleven historic shorelines are presented in Appendix A.
The former position of most historic structures can be located approximately on
Brazos Island based upon the overlays illustrated in Figure 36 and Appendix A. The accuracy of
these positions can only be assessed, however, by correlating archaeological finds with these
historic features. In attempting this task, the authors have chosen to focus on large historic
structures, namely wharves, shipwrecks and railroads. A major reason for this choice is, of course,
because the remains of one wharf and part of at least one railroad have already been discovered.
Beyond this fact, however, it is apparent that such features are less easily destroyed than are
buildings, and they may be more easily recognized by remote sensing techniques.

The following pages contain a summary of current knowledge regarding historic
wharves, shipwrecks and railroads on Brazos Island excluding the railroad built in the 1930s for
construction of the south jetty. Figure 37 illustrates the approximate locations of these features
as known from maps and surmised from written documents. In order to simplify the illustration,
each historic feature on Figure 37 has been assigned a unique alphanumeric identifier consisting
of the letter "H" for "Historic" followed by an Arabic numeral (i.e., "HZ"). The same identifiers
appear in the text when referring to features in Figure 37 and Table 2. In cases where an historic
feature is believed to be represented in multiple cartographic sources, the feature's location from
each source has been plotted in Figure 37 and indicated using a unique lower-case letter following
the normal identifier. For example, H4a and H4b are believed to represent the same wharf but
are known from two different maps.
Archaeological features (including selected magnetic anomalies) and the modern
shoreline appear in the background of Figure 37. Archaeological features recorded by Corbin and
Webb (1967) are denoted by Arabic numerals preceded by the letter "F." These arc the original
designations used by Corbin and Webb, although their field notes identifying those features have
not been located either at the Texas Historical Commission or with Corbin (1992). Magnetic
anomalies of 50 gammas or larger, recorded by EH&A (1981) during a survey on the shore of
Back Bay, are indicated in Figure 37 by an "X" symbol. Magnetic anomalies recorded during the
present project for both the Back Bay and Anomaly X survey areas arc illustrated and discussed
elsewhere in this report.

archaeological features, excavations and probes recorded during EH&A's most recent field season
are indicated in Figure 37 and identified in Table 2.
Wharves
Analysis of historic maps indicates the approximate locations of at least fourteen
unique wharves and one marine ways on the north end of Brazos Island between 1854 and 1910.
Many more than fourteen wharves, and at least one other marine ways, may have existed,
beginning as early as 1823 when Matamoros became an official port of entry with Brazos Santiago
as its harbor. Nevertheless, only those wharves which appear on historic maps have been included
in Figure 37. The approximate locations of earlier wharves, for example those known from written
sources to have existed during the war with Mexico, can be surmised from the location of the U.S.
Government Depot (Figure 3).
1823 The harbor was first opened to foreign trade in 1823 when ranchero Martin de
Leon brought luxury merchandise from New Orleans to Brazos Santiago
(Alperin 1977:139). In that same year, the town of Matamoros was granted
status as a port of entry by the Mexican government. With the establishment
of a sea port at Brazos Santiago and a port of entry in the same year at
Matamoros on the Rio Grande, ships carrying dry goods unloaded their cargo
at the wharves of Brazos Santiago.
1847 Major Thomas Eastland, Quartermaster for the U.S. Army at Brazos Santiago
from 24 March 1847 until 31 October 1848, summarized his stay at Brazos
Santiago in an 1849 letter:
.. .it became necessary to construct wharves, this was done
in a very cheap manner, by using old vessels, no longer fit
for service. As many as seven vessels could be accomodated
[sic] at the same time... The frequent occasion to repair
vessels, and the great expense of sending them abroad for
that purpose, made it necessary to establish a ship yard. A
set of ways were built, and all the appertenances [sic]
necessary for repairing vessels were procured (Major
Thomas Eastland; quoted in Hoyt et al. 1991:Appendix A,
Letter 9).
Webster's 1847 (Figure 2) map does not indicate the locations or numbers of wharves
built from scuttled vessels, although these were likely adjacent the buildings. The shipyard and
marine ways do not appear to have been built on Brazos Island until after Eastland look over as
Quartermaster in 1847.
1848 On 19 September 1848, a gale struck Brazos Island. In his 24 September 1848
report Eastland wrote, "During the gale the water rose about 13 inches over the
land immediately in front of the wharves, surrounding all the public buildings ... "

134731'J2003l

109

1848 On 8November1848, Major W.W. Chapman, the new Assistant Quartermaster
at Brazos Santiago, reported that the marine ways were present and operational
(two vessels were under repair at that time). Also he was ready to turn over
"That portion of the wharf required by [Mr. Dobbins]" as requested in his letter
of August 1, 1848. "... The Norther last Saturday... carried away one wharf, and
injured all [wharves] more or less."
1850 Major Chapman stated on 18 May 1850 that his only wharf boat had "gone to
pieces during the recent severe Northers" (Hoyt et al. 1991: Appendix A. Letter
16). In the same letter, he proposed to scuttle the hulk of the Colonel Stevens
as a new "wharf or rather pier head ... The position in which [wish to place her
will greatly protect the depot from the action of the water, and particularly the
coal pile, during Northers."
1854 Two wharves (HI and H2) show clearly at the northwest corner of Brazos
Island (Figure 3). The configuration of the westernmost wharf (Hl) indicates
that it may have been a wharfboat connected to the island by a pier. This may
be the position of the Colonel Stevens which Major Chapman had proposed to
scuttle adjacent the depot as a wharfuoat "pier head" in 1850 (Hoyt ct al. 1991:
Appendix A. Letter 16).
A letter dated 18 November 1854 from Captain Stewart Van Vliet at Fort Brown
described the destruction of a wharf (Hl) on Brazos Island:
Ten days ago [November 8th) a heavy N.E. gale carried away nearly all
the piles which supported the wharf and it is now necessary that it should
be entirely rebuilt ... (Van Vliet 1854; quoted in Hoyt ct al. 1991:
Appendix A. Letter 24; see also Letter 25).
This wharf had not been replaced as of 24 January 1855. Van Vliet reported in a
letter of that date:
I have received through Col. A.C. Myers A.Q.M. your instructions with
regard to the wharf at this place. There can be obtained here an
abundance of Palmetto logs for its repair but I most respectfully suggest
that iron piles would be superior in every respect...Beforc commencing
these repairs I have thought it proper to state the objections to the
wooden piles & suggest a substitute... (Van Vliet 1855; quoted in Hoyt
et al. 1991: Appendix A. Letter 26).
Given the instructions of the U.S. Quartermaster General, implied in Van Vliet's
January 1855 letter, the wharf was probably rebuilt using locally available Palmetto logs for pilings.
1856 In 1856, Colonel Joseph Mansfield visited Brazos Santiago Depot. His
inspection report included a sketch of the buildings enclosed within the fenced
depot compound (Figure 4). Figure_4 also shows a "new wharf" (H3) west of
an "old wharf" (H2). The sketch was drawn in 1856, thus the "new wharl" in

!3473/'J 20031

110

Figure 4 must have replaced the western wharf (Hl) of Figure 3, which was
destroyed by a gale on 8 November 1854.
1859 'Rip' Ford wrote in 1859 that Morgan Line steamships were at anchor at the
Brazos wharf every eight or ten days.
1860 A letter from AC. Gillem indicates that there was no serviceable wharf at
Brazos Santiago Depot in May 1860. This suggests that no wharves had been
built since 1855, the approximate date of the 'new wharf' (H3) shown in
Figure 4.
When there was a wharf at Brazos, vessels ... sometimes landed such
stores at Brazos as were not liable to injury from becoming wet, lumber
for instance (Alvan C. Gillem 1860; quoted in Hoyt et al. 1991: Appendix
A, Letter 34).
1864 Shortly after General Herron arrived on Brazos Isl;ind he wrote:
What I propose to do is to build a wharf at Brazos Island
and establish the depots there ... (Herron, January 1864;
U.S. Secretary of War, Series I, 34(2):166-167).
During the month of February 1864, Lt. Colonel Arthur F. Wrotnouski mapped the 'Environs of
Brazos Island" (Figure 7) showing Herron's newly completed wharf (H4a).
1865 The January 1865 map in Figure 8 appears to show the same wharf (H4b) as
indicated in February 1864 (Figure 7).
1865 In February of this year, R.B. Jones wrote from Brazos Island:
The old wharf [H4b?] is in good repair, with a wrecked
schooner for wharf boat. A new wood and coal wharf is
nearly complete (R.B. Jones, 28 February 1865; U.S.
Secretary of War, Series I, 48(1):1005-1006).
1866 A map dated 23 January 1866 (Figure 9) shows four wharves (H4c, H5a, H6
and H7a) located along the north shore of the island. A rail spur is clearly
shown extending along the full length of the westernmost wharf (H4c). The "T"
configuration of this wharf, combined with information from an 1867 map,
suggests that this wharf is the 'old wharf... with a wrecked schooner for wharf
boat' referred to in Jones' 1865 letter. The easternmost wharf (H7a) in
Figure 9 is believed to be the 'old forage wharf' referred to in a letter dated
10 April 1866 (Hoyt et al. 1991: Appendix A, Letter 38 - see quote below).
One of the two central wharves (H5a or H6) would likely be the "new wood
and coal wharf' completed shortly after 28 February 1865 (sec quote from
Jones' letter above).

1S67 At least four wharves (H4d, H5b, HS and H9) appear in Figure 10, the 1S67
map. The two easternmost of these were newly constructed since January of
1S66 (compare with Figure 9). The easternmost wharf (HS) is believed to have
been constructed by April 10th, 1866 to replace the "old forage wharf' (H7a).
I have the honor to inform you of the completion of a new
& excellent wharf [HS?] at this place. It is 130 feet long by
75 feet broad, located just west of the old forage wharf, with
which it connects, giving a bonus [?] front of 150 feet... The
piling is all of cypress lumber ... being a surplus of that
received for the Rail Road Bridge at Boca Chica... This
wharf is extended far enough into the channel to prevent
the sand washing in & filling it up as it did the old one
(W.H.D. Cochrane, 10 April 1866; quoted in Hoyt ct al.
1991: Appendix A, Letter 3S).

:i ~ .'· .·.

Figure 10 indicates a structure on the beach (H7b) immediately adjacent the cast side
of the easternmost wharf (HS). Cochrane's description above suggests that the structure was the
"old forage wharf' which was replaced in April of 1866 because it had filled in with sand between
its pilings. The westernmost wharf (H4d) in Figure 10 has a shipwreck symbol (Hl 7) indicated at
its end. This wharf appears to have been of the wharfboat type and appears in the same position
as the 1S66 railroad wharf (H4c) (Figure 9).
Slightly east of the wharfboat is a small wharf symbol (H5b) presumed to represent
one of the two central wharves indicated for 1866 in Figure 9. A second shipwreck symbol (HlS)
is shown in Figure 10 adjacent the shoreline near the center of the waterfront area. This may
represent a fifth wharf in 1S67, also of the wharfboat type. This wreck is referred to in this report
as the Back Bay wreck.
1868 By April 1868, plans had been drawn up for a new government wharf and
warehouse (see Hoyt et al. 1991: figures 16-lS). These structures were
presumably built soon after April. The "Government Wharf' remained in use
through the early 1S70s.
1S71 Adams' 1S71 hydrographic survey map of the harbor pass and bar (Figure 11)
shows the location of the 1868 Government Wharf (HlOa). In 1S71 it was one
of two wharves on Brazos Island, although the other (Hl l) was an "old wharf'
that was out of service. The old wharf is believed to have been built shortly
after the October 1S67 hurricane.
The Government Wharf is located in the immediate v1cm1ty of wharf remains
discovered by EH&A in Back Bay (Hoyt ct al. 1991: 103). A set of 1S68 plans for the Government
Wharf were discovered by EH&A in the National Archives and arc illustrated in Figure 3S.
Although the size of the proposed wharf is greater than that recorded for the submerged piling grid
(Figure 37), the discrepancy could easily be accounted for by the loss of pilings through erosion.
Or, perhaps the wharf as built was smaller than the original plan specified. Whatever the case, the

close correlation between the position and orientation of the piling grid and the mapped location
of the Government Wharf indicates that they are probably the same structure.
1876 The wreck of the Rene des Mer occurred in 1875. Descriptions of removal
efforts made passing reference to wharves:
...She is lying on the east side of the middle ground almost
abreast the old Gov. wharf. The channel to the new wharf
is filling up by the gradual extension of the point of the spit
from the wreck to the shore ... (Charles Whitney & Co., 29
November 1876; quoted in Hoyt et al. 1991: Appendix A,
Letter 59).
1877 In February 1877, Captain James Gregory inspected the wreck and reported:
...She lies between the anchorage inside the bar and the
wharf at Brazos Santiago and about 350 yards distant from
the wharf (J.F. Gregory 1877; Hoyt et al. 1991: Appendix A,
Letter 60).
1887 Ernst's 1887 survey map (Figure 12) illustrated three "old wharves" landlocked
by shoreline changes. The easternmost of these wharves (HlOb) is believed to
be the "old Government Wharf" (HlOa). The westernmost wharf (Hl2a) in
Figure 12 is believed to be the "new wharf" mentioned in 1876 and 1877 in
reference to the Rene des Mer. The central wharf (H13), located much closer
to the 1887 shoreline than the other two, may have been constructed between
1882 and 1884 when construction of the original south jetty was causing the
shoreline to accrete rapidly in that area. Figure 12 also shows the location of
a marine ways (Hl4) and an unidentified shipwreck (H20). Refer to the
discussion of the investigation of anomalies T and V in chapters IV and VI of
this report regarding shipwreck H20.
1909 Maps of the Brazos Island Life Saving Station, dating from 1909 and 1910
(figures 13 and 14), indicate a Life Saving Service wharf (HIS) on the far
northwest corner of the island and a landlocked "old wharf" (Hl2b) believed to
correspond with the westernmost 'old wharf" (Hl2a) shown as landlocked on
Ernst's 1887 map (Figure 12).
Wrecks
A large number of historic watercraft have been lost or purposely scuttled at Brazos
Santiago Harbor. Many of these arc known from written references, while many more arc known
from wreck symbols on historic charts of the island and harbor. Appendix B lists 138 vessels
reported as lost in the southern Laguna Madre, including bay and Gulf of Mexico waters in and
near Brazos Santiago Harbor and Point Isabel.

13473/92003 l

114

The much shortened list below includes only those vessels believed lo be lost opposite
the historic Brazos Island waterfront or in the area known as the "south breakers," historically
located on the northeast corner of Brazos Island in the vicinity of the modern south jetty. Most
vessels listed in Appendix B as lost "at" or "in Brazos Santiago Pass" are not discussed below.
Unless the authors have discovered previously unpublished information about a vessel, it is not
included. An exception to this rule was made, however, in the case of vessels lost in the south
breakers, since EH&A conducted a magnetometer survey over a portion of that area during the
most recent field season.
Greenwood, steamboat (date unknown):
The Greenwood was listed as lost in the south breakers of Brazos Santiago Pass (TAC,
No. 730).
Storeship Ursula, U.S. Brig (1846):
From a letter dated 4 November 1846:
Store Ship U.S. Brig "Ursula" --- Store Ship has not been afloat since
before being purchased and requires repairs (Captain J.M. Still 1846;
quoted in Hoyt ct al. 1991: Appendix A, Letter 1).
Marine ways were not constructed on Brazos Island until at least 1847. It is likely
that the brig Ursula was not repaired but became one of several wharfboats during the
war with Mexico.
1847-1848 wharfboats:
Major Thomas Eastland, Quartermaster for the U.S. Army at Brazos Santiago from
24 March 1847 until 31 October 1848, wrote of several wharfboats constructed during his stay at
Brazos Santiago:
.. .it became necessary to construct wharves, this was done in a very cheap
manner, by using old vessels, no longer fit for service. As many as seven
vessels could be accomodatcd [sicJ at the same time ... (Eastland 1849;
quoted in Hoyt ct al. 1991: Appendix A, Letter 9).
The numbers and locations of wharfboats during this period arc unknown, although
Eastland states that ' ... seven vessels could be accommodated at the same time ... " As few as two
wharfboals might be required for seven steamers to dock simultaneously, since each could point
its bow into the wharf. Remains of these scuttled wharfboals arc most likely located along the
depot waterfront as indicated in an 1854 topographic survey of Brazos Island (Figure 3), an area
now under dry land. Possible identities of these vessels, in addition to the Ursula, can be guessed
at from an 1846 letter by J.M. Still:
... for the transportation of supplies to the rivcr...thc "Mcntoria" is the
only boat I have of the proper model and draft, but she is so deficient in

13473/920031

115

strength that I cannot send her over the bars unless it is quite smooth.
... I am now obliged to use the fleet of small vessels mentioned in my
report of yesterday, the "Mentoria" when the weather will permit and
nearly all the time the "Cincinnati", "Stevens", and "Thomson". ...The
"Augusta" is getting old in service and I apprehend will not last long
(Still; quoted in Hoyt et al. 1991: Appendix A. Letter 2).
A.B. Cooley (1848):

This schooner was lost in the south breakers at Brazos Santiago Pass (TAC, No. 664) .
Pre-1850 wharfboat:
Major Chapman stated on 18 May 1850 that his only wharlboat had "gone to pieces
during the recent severe Northers" (Hoyt et al. 1991: Appendix A. Letter 16). This wharlboat
would presumably have been located adjacent the depot at the northwest corner of the island.
Colonel Stevens, screw steamer (1850):

Two wharves show clearly at the northwest corner of Brazos Island in an 1854 map
(Figure 3). The "T" configuration of the westernmost wharf indicates that it may be a wharlboat
(H16) connected to the island by a pier. This may be the "hulk of the propeller Colonel Stevens"
which Major Chapman proposed to scuttle adjacent the depot as a wharlboat "pier head" in 1850
to replace the one which had gone to pieces (Hoyt ct al. 1991: Appendix A. Letter 16).
1865 wharfboat:
"The old wharf is in good repair, with a wrecked schooner for wharf boat" (R.B. Jones
letter, dated 28 February 1865; U.S. Secretary of War, Series I, 48(1):1005-1006). This schooner
must have been placed at the end of the only wharf shown on a January 1865 map (Figure 8). This
may be the same as the wharlboat (H17) indicated at the end of the railroad wharf in 1867
(Figure 10).
1867 wharlboats:
The westernmost wharf in Figure 10 has a shipwreck indicated at its end. This wharf
appears to be of the wharlboat type and appears in the same approximate position as the 1866
railroad wharf (H4c). Another shipwreck symbol is shown adjacent the shoreline to the cast of
this wharf (H18).
Edith Brown (1867):

A total loss in the "south breakers" on 30 November 1867. The Edith Brown
attempted to cross the Brazos bar with a load of lumber from Pensacola (Daily Ra11cJ1ero, l
December 1867).

13473/920031

116

Rene des Mer (1875):
In the fall of 1875, a full-rigged brig of 350-400 tons, Rene des Mer, sank in the pass
at Brazos Santiago after striking an old anchor. Futile attempts were made to raise the vessel.
By November 29th of the following year, the wreck was becoming an obstruction to navigation in
the harbor.
She is lying on the east side of the middle ground almost abreast the old
Gov. wharf. The channel to the new wharf is filling up by the gradual
extension of the point of the spit from the wreck to the shore (Charles
Whitney & Co. 1876; quoted in Hoyt et al. 1991: Appendix A, Letter 59).
She lies between the anchorage inside the bar and the wharf at Brazos
Santiago and about 350 yards distant from the wharf. On a line from the
wreck towards Point Isabel a middle ground of sand has been formed
since the wreck has been where she is, which for 200 or 300 yards is
nearly dry at low water. This was formerly all good water...lt will be
necessary to blow her to pieces with explosives and to remove the
fragments piecemeal (J.F. Gregory 1877; Hoyt et al. 1991: Appendix A,
Letter 60).
A contract for removal of the Rene des Mer was issued to the New Orleans Wrecking
Company in the amount of $6,000. The work was performed in December 1878. The work was
inspected by H.S. Douglas of the Army Engineers in New Orleans. Douglas stated that "to the best
of my belief, Greenleaf Andrews, president of New Orleans Wrecking Company, has fulfilled his
contract. . ." (U.S. House of Representatives 1879). Apparently, however, Andrews had only
removed the upper portions of the hull, as it was hit by a dredge in 1927 and dynamited again
(Alperin 1977:142).
Congo (H19); also (?) Congo State (1881):
A.A. Champion's wreck list describes the Congo State as a French bark which wrecked
in the south breakers in 1881 (TAC, No. 702). A Congo was also indicated in that area on an 1881
hydrographic survey chart by Lt. V. Sebree, U.S.N. Lloyd's Registry of Foreign Shipping was
consulted for the period 1880 to 1900 in an attempt to identify this vessel. Several Congas existed
during the period researched. Only two of these were listed as having French registry. Two others
were listed as wrecked; however, both were Norwegian and both were lost in the 1890s.
One possible identity of the Brazos Island Congo is an iron screw brig of 1,283 gross
tons, measuring 216.2 ft in length, 30.2 ft in beam and 23.0 ft deep. This brig was built in Glasgow
in 1869 and was listed under Scottish registry through 1881, belonging to the British & African
Steam Navigation Company (Official No. 60414). It was the only Congo listed by Lloyd's in 1881.
In the 1882 and 1883 editions of Lloyd's, this same Congo was listed under French registry. After
1883, this vessel was not listed in Lloyd's. No mention was made of its final disposition.

I3473f)20031

117

Another possible identity of the Brazos Island Congo is an iron screw bark of 3,897
gross tons, measuring 394.6 ft long, 39.7 ft wide and 32.8 ft deep. This bark was built in Marseilles
in 1878 and was listed under French registry through at least the 1899-1900 edition of Lloyd's.

If either one of the above vessels is the same Congo mapped by the Navy
Hydrographic Office in 1881, it would seem that the vessel was refloated. Of course, alternative
explanations exist. The Glasgow-built screw brig might have been a total loss on Brazos Island in
1881, but its loss not reported to Lloyd's until after the 1883 edition was published. It is also quite
possible that the Congo wrecked on Brazos Island was never listed in Lloyd's.
In 1977, during a magnetometer survey of waters along the lower Texas coast,
representatives of the TAC investigated remains of a shipwreck uncovered by locals during an
effort to salvage a stranded vessel on the beach just south of the south jetty (Arnold 1992). A
wooden hull fragment, tentatively identified as part of a keel with attached timbers and fasteners,
was recorded. The location of this fragment was approximately where the revised position of the
Congo now appears and may be related to that wreck. The TAC did not record the timber as a
site in 1977 but requested that EH&A do so in light of the current evidence regarding the Congo.
Accordingly, EH&A officially recorded the site based on the TAC field notes from 1977, and it was
assigned the state trinomial 41CF133.
1887 wreck:
Ernst's 1887 survey map (Figure 12) indicates the location of an unidentified
shipwreck (H20). The ship appears to have grounded on a remnant of the sand spit caused by the
1884 jetty. Once believed by the authors to be the Rene des Mer, this wreck was mapped 12 years
after the Rene des Mer sank and 7 1/2 years after her hull was dynamited and certified as removed.
This wreck appears in the vicinity of anomalies T and Von the magnetic contour maps of the area
(figures 24 and 28). See the discussion of the investigations of anomalies T and V in chapters IV
and VI of this report.
1910 wreck:
An unidentified wreck (H21) is indicated on a 1910 map of Brazos Island (Figure 13).
The vessel wrecked in about 8 ft (2.4 m) of water, but is now charted in about 3 ft (1.0 m) of water
near the modern shoreline. The indicated position of wreck H21 is outside of all archaeological
survey areas previously investigated and thus is not covered by existing magnetic contour maps.
Railroads
The initial assumption regarding track buried under Back Bay was that it formed part
of General Philip Sheridan's military railroad built in 1865 (figures 9, 10 and 37). If so, the
location might allow one to pinpoint other historic features, such as buildings, wharves and
shipwrecks, on or beneath the modern land surface. Analysis of historic maps (sec Hoyt ct al.
1991), however, revealed that the location and orientation of the Back Bay track docs not
correspond to that of Sheridan's railroad.

I3473J920031

118

The authors have considered two alternative explanations for the Back Bay railroad
tracks: 1) either they are unmapped sidings associated with Sheridan's 1865 railroad, or 2) they
are part of an earlier Brazos Island railroad, constructed in 1864 under the orders of General
Francis J. Herron. The authors believe that the second option is more likely. Both possibilities
are critically examined below. For a detailed historical account of these two railroads, refer to
Chapter III of this report.
Hcrron's railroad docs not appear on any known maps. Consequently, its route is
unknown. Colonel John "Rip" Ford stated that Herron's railroad connected White Ranch with
Brazos Santiago, the same general route followed by Sheridan's railroad. Sheridan implied in a
letter dated 5 August 1865 that the rails from Herron's railroad were reused. "I directed the
railroad from Brazos ... to be builded... This involved only the expense of cross-tics, as we have
everything else" (U.S. Secretary of War, Series I, 48(2):1165; emphasis by the authors). It is
presumed, then, that Sheridan's railroad, or at least most of it, was constructed on Hcrron's
rail bed.
Several pieces of evidence suggest that the Back Bay railroad is not an unmapped
siding from Sheridan's railroad. For example, why would Sheridan have a siding built that led far
eastward of any known buildings and far from any wharves (compare figures 9, 10 and 37)? Only
two maps are known which show the route of Sheridan's railroad, one dating from early 1866
(Figure 9) and the other dating from the spring of 1867 (Figure 10). Both maps agree concerning
the route of the railroad at the depot, yet neither map shows a siding which could be mistaken for
the Back Bay railroad. No building alignments in either 1866 or 1867 followed the route of the
Back Bay railroad, as they did Sheridan's railroad. In fact, both maps indicate buildings which
would have stood directly on top of the Back Bay railroad had it been in operation at the time.
The fact that only one crosstie and one isolated railroad spike have been found in
assoc1at1on with the Back Bay rails suggests that the spikes and crossties were intentionally
removed. Three independent historic references imply that the crossties were removed from
Herron's railroad (see Chapter III). These tics were then used to construct Redoubt B (figures
8, 9, 10 and 37) during the fall of 1864.
The tracks of Sheridan's railroad were reportedly scattered across Brazos Island by
the October 1867 hurricane.
They say there is not one rail on top of another if there ever was. The
track made tracks but cannot now be tracked out by the best dog tracker
to be found.
The ties and rails and cars are said to be about equally divided between
the Rio Grande, Brazos Bay and Clark's Island. (Daily Ranchero, Nov. 17
1867)
EH&A divers have recorded several loose rails scattered near the ship channel north
of Back Bay (Figure 32: locations 10, 15, 16, 25, 35 and 36; sec also Table !). The wide
distribution of these rails is consistent with historic accounts of the railroad's destruction.

l3473tJ2003 l

119

Following the hurricane, the rails were ordered gathered up. Obviously, rails which had washed
into the channel would not have been collected.
The railroad was eventually sold to the Indianola Railroad Company. There is no
record that a railroad was ever again operated on Brazos Island, so it is presumed that the rails
were shipped away for use in another part of Texas. Again, archaeological evidence is consistent
with the historic accounts. Additional rails were located in the adjacent Gulf waters during
archaeological investigations conducted by the Texas Historical Commission (Arnold 1978).
EH&A's (1981) terrestrial magnetometer survey included the area of Sheridan's railroad, yet the
results (Figure 37) did not indicate any anomaly patterns that could be mistaken for a continuous
line of rails. If the iron of Sheridan's railroad was gathered up, sold and shipped off of the island,
it seems unlikely that the parties involved would have ignored 549 m of track. Possibly the Back
Bay track, missing its crossties for three years prior to 1867, had settled into the sand deeply
enough to protect it from the hurricane and to preclude its being gathered up and sold.
The probable route of Herron's railroad is indicated in Figure 37. The location of the
sand dunes shown in Figure 37 is the same as when Herron's railroad was built in 1864 (sec figures
7 and 8). The dunes allowed only two paths for a railroad leading between the Boca Chica beach
road and the depot waterfront. One path, chosen by Sheridan, led inland from the beach on the
south side of the dunes (Figure 37). The other path, presumably chosen by Herron, followed the
beach farther north, then led around the north side of the dunes toward the wharf area. The Back
Bay track leads away from the historic waterfront area in a line that, if continued to the beach
(Figure 37), would skirt the north side of the dune area as it existed in 1864.
Other Structures
The Coast Survey map of Brazos Island from 1867 (Figure 10) clearly shows
perpendicular rows of buildings with labels for 'barracks' and 'hospital'. To examine the
correlation between the locations of these structures and both the magnetic data and previous
archaeological investigations in Back Bay, the structures have been placed on figures 37 and 39.
Figure 37 is the correlation of archaeological features. The structures without alpha-numeric labels
are from the 1867 map. Figure 39 correlates the 1867 structures with the magnetic data collected
during this project.
The railroad which passes through Back Bay clearly passes at an angle through the
rows of barracks buildings, appearing to pass beneath several of the indicated structures. The exact
correspondence of these building and the railroad in time and space is uncertain, but the authors
feel that the graphic representation presented here is reasonably correct spatially and that the
argument presented above regarding the railroad places it chronologically two or three years prior
to the structures.
Several test excavations were made along the railroad and thus in the vicinity of the
1867 barracks buildings. No indications of extant building remains were located in any of those
locations. Isolated, random brick scatters were the only indications of possible structures observed.
The position of the hospital on the 1867 map lies more toward the northccntral part
of the bay, close to the scarp separating the shallow bay waters from the deeper waters of the

channel. Neither visual examination of the bay bottom nor remote sensing data indicate structures
in this area. The magnetic data in Figure 39 shows no correspondence between estimated building
locations and magnetic anomalies. As with a shipwreck, any building remains, even if collapsed
and badly deteriorated can be expected to generate a magnetic disturbance from the hardware used
in construction of the building. Similarly, the sub-bottom profiler did not indicated the presence
of objects which might be interpreted as building remains, including foundations.
The most likely area within the bay for preservation of structures is the northwest corner near the
stone dike. Two structures are indicated in this area, one just in the waters of the bay and one
under the beach. The probe lines placed by EH&A to locate the wreck in this area passed through
the indicated positions of both of these buildings. No evidence of structures was found.

The authors feel that the presence of building remains within the waters of Back Bay
which might retain significant provenience is highly doubtful due to two major factors: the
hurricane of October 1867 and later storms prior to formation of the bay in the 1930s and the
erosional processes which formed and maintain the bay.

INVESTIGATIONS OF ANOMALIES T AND V AND THE SCARP
Anomalies T and V (figures 24 and 28) were recorded during the initial survey of the
channel (EH&A 1990) and investigated by divers during the subsequent project (Hoyt et al. 1991).
The 1991 magnetic contour map (Figure 28) shows far greater detail than the 1989 map
(Figure 24) due to the closer survey tract spacing (7.6 m vs. 18 m) and finer contour intervals
(5 gammas vs. 10 gammas). The sources of both anomalies were determined to be railroad rails
laying on the bottom along with other debris typical of the Brazos Santiago Depot area (i.e. red
bricks, buff bricks, miscellaneous small concretions and occasional wooden timbers). These objects
were thought at the time to have fallen from the shallow waters of Back Bay into the deeper
waters of the channel. Preliminary bathymetric readings recorded in 1990, however, indicated that
the southern slope of the channel was well south of the design limits of the channel and further
removed from anomalies T and V than originally suspected. This slope, referred to in this report
as the scarp, appeared from the rough preliminary depth data to be nearly vertical for most of its
length across the north side of Back Bay. One aspect of the Back Bay remote sensing survey,
discussed above, was to further delineate this scarp.
In the preparation of the report on the 1990 work (Hoyt et al. 1991), an overlay of
an 1887 map (Figure 12) and the modern shoreline was drawn. This map indicated a shipwreck
in the approximate vicinity of anomalies T and V (H20 in Figure 37). Based on this new
information, further investigation of anomalies T and V was necessary to determine if the rails
generating these anomalies might overlay the remains of a historic vessel. As part of this task, the
scarp was investigated for indications of artifacts on or protruding from the slope and for evidence
of the processes which caused the Back Bay to form.
Figure 28, based on the new survey data, illustrates the nature and extent of anomalies
T and V in much greater detail than the original survey (Figure 24). In addition, the side-scan
sonar detected a random scatter of linear objects laying on the bottom of the channel in the vicinity

13473/920031

122

of anomalies T and V (figures 30 and 40). Based on these two sources of information, dive
locations were chosen for further investigation.
Diving on anomalies T and V reinforced the earlier conclusion reported from EH&A's
1990 project (Hoyt et al. 1991). The water depth is approximately 12 to 13 m. The debris at these
locations is scattered on the surface of the clay substrate with only a thin layer (20-30 cm) of silly
sand overburden. Scattered railroad rails are found over a wide area. In determining the
possibility that a vessel lay buried under this area, divers used the water jet probe. Penetration
into the dense clay by the probe was limited to less than 1 m.
Artifacts observed on Anomaly T included a single brass spike and a ceramic jar
(Figure 41). The brass spike, approximately 20 cm long, was an isolated find, not in close
proximity with the timbers or other artifacts. It was located during a circle search of the bottom
and shows none of the usual ravages of submergence over time. The spike was clean of
concretions or marine growth, and virtually free of cupric corrosion products typical of brass
submerged for a long period in salt water. Barto Arnold III of the TAC reports that brass artifacts
observed by him in similar environments on the Texas coast are generally in comparable condition
(Arnold 1992). Although this spike may be from a shipwreck, its presence at this location docs
not appear to indicate a wreck at this location.
The ceramic jar is a stoneware vessel broken at the shoulder. A handle is still present
near the neck. The vessel is 8.1 cm in diameter at the base and approximately 23 cm tall at the
break. Wall thickness at the broken shoulder is 0.3 cm. The paste is cream colored and the glaze,
present on the exterior only, is light brown. The glaze is missing over most of one side of the jar,
probably due to scouring while submerged.
Divers on Anomaly V observed a jumbled group of timbers scattered across the
bottom. These timbers, apparently the side-scan targets which appear in Figure 39, were
approximately 10 cm square in cross section and of various lengths, generally 3 to 5 m. They were
quite solid, not showing the characteristic softness and marine borer damage typical of wood
submerged for long periods. A hole approximately 1.5 cm in diameter was found in the surface
of one timber with what appeared to be the broken end of a lrunnel visible 1 cm deep in the hole.
The limber with the lrunnel joined the midsection of another limber at an angle of about 30°. The
type of join was not discernable.
In the authors' opinion, these timbers are not typical of a shipwreck: they appear lo
be scattered randomly rather than organized; no hull, cabin or deck planks arc associated with
them; they do not bear the curvature of hull frames; and they arc very light for the hull or cabin
of any substantial vessel. These limbers are more typical of a building frame. Examination of
Figure 37 indicates several wharves also in this vicinity: H7a from 1866; H7b, HS and H9 from
1867; and HU from 1871. However, no pilings indicative of wharf supports were found in the
area. Therefore, the timbers are not believed to be associated with wharf decks. Considering their
lack of deterioration and overburden, these timbers could easily be from a frame structure
destroyed by a more recent hurricane, with the debris blown or washed into the channel. After
approximately six hours of diving investigations of this area, the Principal Investigator of this
project docs not consider these timbers to be historically significant.

The loose rails scattered about the vicinity may well be from Sheridan's railroad,
destroyed by the hurricane in 1867. The extent of the hurricane damage is described in a
contemporary account quoted in the general discussion of wharfs, wrecks and railroads above.

,q·,

In addition to testing the anomaly locations, divers examined the scarp to the south
of the anomalies which marks the transition from the shallow water of Back Bay to deep water
adjacent the channel. This scarp runs nearly parallel to the channel centerline across the entire
north side of Back Bay. The scarp was examined for evidence of historic debris, either from a
shipwreck or from the Brazos Santiago Depot, which might be falling down the slope from above
or protruding from the exposed slope. The scarp was also examined for clues to the
geomorphological processes involved in the development of Back Bay, i.e., whether erosion or
subsidence was the main cause of inundation and the resulting effect on historical resources now
within the bay.
'

Approximately 45 m south from the center of Anomaly V, the scarp is a well defined,
nearly vertical face approximately 5 m high. In the vicinity of Anomaly T, however, the scarp has
become a gentle slope (about 12: 1) into the bottom of the channel. Anomaly T is on the slope
near its foot. The foot of the slope is at the south edge of the channel design limits. The scarp
investigations near the northwest corner of Back Bay included the area of Anomaly T.
No artifacts were encountered along the scarp until the divers were approximately 60
m west of Anomaly V, a point approximately 60 m from the eastern end of the scarp. At that
point the divers began encountering artifacts along the bottom of the slope, including the area of
Anomaly T. Those artifacts were typical of Brazos Santiago Depot and the shallow waters of Back
Bay: bricks, railroad rails and miscellaneous concretions. Divers also examined the area from the
eastern end of the scarp to the vicinity of Anomaly R. Again, artifacts observed were typical of
the area. Two unidentified concretions were raised from the bottom for identification. One of
these proved to be a clutch plate from a transmission and the other was a metal hatch cover,
relatively modern although heavily concreted, with the rubber gasket still intact.
The face of the scarp was examined for evidence of the formation processes which
created Back Bay, specifically the presence of sand lenses which may be eroding out of the clay
substrate and causing the ground to subside. No evidence of such sand lenses was found, although
it must be stressed that the visibility was often very poor, and tactile methods are of limited success
when wearing gloves necessary to protect the diver's hands.
INVESTIGATION OF ANOMALY R
Anomaly R (Figure 25) was recorded during the 1989 survey of the ship channel
(EH&A 1990). No further magnetometer survey has been conducted in the vicinity. Diver
investigations on the 1989 and 1990 projects (Hoyt ct al. 1991) demonstrated that the anomaly was
generated by cable and other modern trash in the vicinity of the wharf end of the jetty construction
railroad built in the early 1930s. Since that time, the wharf end of the railroad has been referred
to generically as Anomaly R. This area and the results of the 1990 investigation were described
in detail in the 1991 report.

13473{920031

126

By examination of existing pilings onshore, and comparison of a modem
aerial photograph with an aerial photograph taken in 1939, the area of
Anomaly R has been determined to be the collapsed extension of the
railroad built in the 1930s for construction of the jetties. The pilings
which supported the railroad on a pier in the water have decayed and
collapsed. Most of the collapsed pilings are gone, probably removed by
currents, but the buried portion of each piling is present, sometimes
extending 0.5 m above the bottom. Some collapsed pilings are present,
lying separately or in small piles, especially near the outer end of the
pier. A number of items observed scattered among the pilings could
generate a magnetic signature. Primary among these items were twisted
coils of steel cable, probably associated with past dredging episodes as
large dredge disposal areas are located just onshore from this location.
Several vintage soft-drink bottles from the era of jetty construction or
later were observed and four were collected for examination... In
addition, one molded, brown glass bottle with a turned lip was located
and recovered... The brown glass bottle appears to be of an earlier
vintage than the other bottles, possibly dating to the period between 1880
and 1920...and is not stable, i.e., the glass begins to devitrify immediately
if allowed to dry. The northernmost extent of the pilings was determined
to be approximately 60 m south of the southern edge of the channel...
(Hoyt et al. 1991:75)
Due to the presence of the brown glass bottle, further examinations of Anomaly R
were determined necessary to assess the probability of an earlier cultural component predating the
1930s railroad. To this end, a number of test excavations were made among the pilings using the
propwash deflector on the dive boat and the water induction dredge. These test locations are
plotted on Figure 42 and identified in Table 1. All tests were excavated down to or into the dense
clay substrate. No evidence of artifacts predating the 1930s railroad was located. Again, the most
common artifacts were vintage soda bottles. All artifacts were returned to the test excavations for
reburial.
Without exception, the historic overlay maps (Appendix A} place Anomaly R well off
the northern shore of Brazos Island. This was true until at least 1910, the date of the last overlay
map. At some point, very possibly after construction of the jetties and dredging of the channel
with its associated onshore dredge disposal, the north shore accreted further north toward the
channel. Prior to that, the area of Anomaly R was well offshore, in the general area indicated as
an anchorage on historic maps. Artifacts located in the vicinity of Anomaly R which predate the
jetty construction railroad are therefore likely to be associated with anchored vessels or vessels in
transit.

VI. CONCLUSIONS
ANOMALY X (41CF132)
The primary source of Anomaly X is a group of large steel plates wedged among the
jetty rocks near the outer end of the south jetty. The northernmost minor lobe of the anomaly,
which extends into the southern edge of the channel, appears to be generated by a section of cable
laying on the bottom in the vicinity of an isolated jetty capstone. Bottom sediments in this area
are dense clay, with no evidence of buried historic resources.
The steel hulled vessel which wrecked here has not been identified. However, the
position of the plates indicates that it probably wrecked after the jetties were constructed in the
early 1930s. A wreck symbol appears at this location on the latest USGS quad map (Port Isabel,
Texas; USGS 7.5' Series, 1955, photorevised 1983). The vessel apparently wrecked prior to 1970,
as it does not appear as a photorevision on the earlier edition of the 1955 map photrevised in
1970. Either the wreck dates prior to 1955, when the map was produced, or it first appeared on
a photorevision between 1955 and 1970. At least three vessels listed in the TAC wreck files as lost
in this area between 1935, when the jetties were completed, and 1%5 could qualify as this wreck:
the Palmetto, 1954 (TAC #35); the Amiga Mia, 1954 (TAC #125); and the Cavalier, 1965 (TAC
#169. Several other vessels with more vague descriptions may qualify as well. Oddly enough, no
wrecks appear on the list for this area between 1933 and 1953, suggesting that the wreck did not
occur before 1953.
A major portion of this wreck may be beyond the outer end of the jetty. A large
anomaly was noted well outside of the survey area during EH&A's 1989 survey (EH&A 1990).
Historical significance for the wreck at Anomaly X has not been established or even
indicated. At the request of the TAC, however, the wreck has been designated an archaeological
site, 41CF132. Archaeological clearance for future channel maintenance or improvements is
recommended.
The wreck of the Congo which appears on a map of1881 may be the Congo State,
TAC wreck list #702. Attempts to track down the Congo in archival records were not definitive.
The revised historic overlay maps, however, now place the wreck of the Congo, as represented on
the 1881 map, under the beach south of the south jetty. No evidence of the vessel was found in
the channel, particularly in the vicinity of Anomaly X. As the current best estimation of the
position of the Congo places it outside of the jetties, it should not be impacted by future channel
maintenance or improvements.
As discussed previously, the TAC recorded evidence of a shipwreck under beach sands
just south of the south jetty in 1977. The wreck was uncovered by locals during an effort to
salvage a stranded vessel on the beach just south of the south jetty (Arnold 1992). A wooden hull
fragment, tentatively identified as part of a keel with attached timbers and fasteners, was recorded.
The location of this fragment was approximately where the revised position of the Congo now
appears and may be related to that wreck. The TAC did not record the timber as a site in 1977
but requested that EH&A do so in light of the current evidence regarding the Congo. Accordingly,

13473,.,20031

129

ESPEY, HUSTON & ASSOCIATES, INC.

EH&A officially recorded the site based on the TAC field notes from 1977, and it was assigned
the state trinomial 41CF133.
ANOMALYR
Continued investigations in the vicinity of Anomaly R suggest no distinct cultural
component prior to the construction of the jetty railroad in the early 1930s. Historically, the area
was well offshore into Laguna Madre from the active depot on Braws Island. Artifacts in this area
predating 1930 are likely from boats swinging at anchor or in transit.
ANOMALIES T AND V
The sources of both of these anomalies, as determined in earlier projects, are
scattered railroad rails. These rails are probably the scattered remains of General Philip Sheridan's
military railroad built in 1865 and largely destroyed by a hurricane in 1867, although they may also
be from the 1930s jetty construction railroad.
The Ernst map of 1887 (Figure 12) indicates an unidentified shipwreck in the
approximate location of anomalies T and V (wreck H20 in Figure 37). Close examination of the
map indicates that the wreck either grounded on a sand spit created by currents from the 1884 jetty
or, possibly, the occurrence of the wreck contributed to the creation of the sand spit. Testing to
determine if buried wreck remains might be in the area, as indicated by an 1887 overlay map,
demonstrated that the bottom sediments consist of a few centimeters of sand and silt overlaying
a dense clay stratum. The clay is so dense as to preclude penetration by a water jet probe deeper
than 1 m. No wreck remains were identified in the vicinity.
Scattered timbers located in the vicinity of Anomaly V are believed to be modem,
probably storm-deposited. Isolated historic artifacts in the area of both T and V, e.g., bricks,
ceramics and a brass spike, are likewise believed to be redeposited materials from Brazos Santiago
Depot, either moved by wind and current or deposited as the old shoreline has eroded away.
Although anomalies T and V are well outside of the current design limits of the
Channel, they are in deep water in an area that appears to have been dredged in the past. These
artifacts may be from the historic depot, but their provenience is considered lost and their
historical significance thus reduced significantly. No further archaeological investigation is
recommended on anomalies T and V.
BACK BAY
Two key issues have motivated the investigations of Back Bay: 1) the potential for
preservation of historical resources under the Back Bay waters, and 2) the past and future impacts
on those resources, if any. Brazos Santiago Depot, Site 41CF4, is listed on the National Register
of Historic Places (NRHP). The boundary of the National Register property, plotted on Figure 15
from the boundary coordinates given in the NRHP nomination form, includes all of Back Bay.
This being the case, an understanding of the two issues addressed above is vital to management
of the National Register property.

13473!920031

ESPEY, HUSTON & ASSOCIATES, INC.

Regarding the potential for the preservation of historic resources within the bay, the
investigations by EH&A have shown that resources do exist and are preserved to varying degrees.
The railroad buried under the bay, consisting of articulated rails lacking crossties, is an example
of a well-preserved resource. Archival evidence presented in this report indicates that the rails
probably were part of a short-lived railroad constructed in 1864 from which the ties were removed
and used to build military fortifications. The Back Bay railroad appears to be approximately in its
original position based on the fact that the rails are still parallel and mostly upright over most of
its length across the bottom of the bay. The grid of wharf pilings in the northwest corner of the
bay, probably the remains of the Government Wharf built in 1868, are another example of a
preserved historic structure. The authors feel that the preservation of these two structures in any
semblance of their original form is unusual if not unique within the bay, and that such a degree
of preservation is due to the nature of the structures and their locations within the bay.
Interpretation of available evidence regarding the formation of Back Bay supports a
hypothesis of erosional forces at work as opposed to subsidence caused by deflation of sandy strata
beneath the floor of the bay. The current known to exist around the perimeter of the bay is
believed to have eroded the original shoreline after the south jetty was completed. The bay follows
exactly the line of the jetty as it curves to the south. If subsidence were the dominate process, the
jetty would also subside. The northwest corner of the bay is protected by the stone dike,
preventing the bay from becoming much larger.
The railroad is preserved by its mass. Its sheer weight and length have allowed it to
settle into the bottom sediments with little distortion from erosional forces. Less massive objects
or structures, such as a building supported on brick piers (bricks were specified in building plans
located in the archives) which survived the decades at hurricanes and lesser storms prior to the
formation of the bay, would not be able to withstand the erosional forces. Any wooden structure
would collapse and the bricks would be scattered. In fact, scattered bricks dating to the latter half
of the nineteenth century have been observed throughout the study area. As no structures have
survived on land, they cannot be expected to do so underwater where they are subjected to
additional destructive forces.
Even wharves built on driven pilings would not normally prevail in an erosional
environment. Removal of tlie sediments from around the pilings would eventually work them
loose and would also expose them to marine boring organisms which can rapidly destroy wooden
structures. As with the railroad, the old wharf in the northwest corner of the bay is probably
unusual in its preservation, a fact which can be attributed to its protected location. The stone dike
offers limited protection from the scouring current in the bay by diverting that current. Based on
observation of the height of the tops of the in situ pilings at this location, the Principal Investigator
believes that they originally were completely buried in protective sediment. In spite of protection
from the stone dike, this sediment has gradually eroded away, exposing the pilings to a destructive
environment.

Without an extreme mass or other protection from the current, structures within the
bay probably would not survive. The Principal Investigator believes that the probability of finding
relatively intact resources within the unprotected waters of the bay is low. Many individual artifacts
are present, but they are without provenience and have therefore lost much of their archaeological
significance. The current within the bay flows in a circular pattern, entering one end of the bay,

13473/920031

131

ESPEY, HUSTON & ASSOCIATES, INC.

passing along the shore, and exiting at the other end. The direction of travel appears to vary with
the direction of tidal flow. This current was observed to be quite strong during this and previous
EH&A projects in the area. The scouring effect of the current has produced a channel around the
edge of the bay which is slightly deeper than the center of the bay (Figure 29). The bay may have
been formed by the migration of this current southward into the island after construction of the
south jetty. Because of this current and the overall depth of the bay -- generally 3 to 4 m,
indicating the amount of erosion which has occurred -- no extant historical features, including
cisterns or trash pits, are expected to exist within the main body of Back Bay other than the
railroad, which is protected by its articulated mass .

.' ~ i

The section of the bay where significant resources might be found is the extreme
northwest comer, south of the stone dike. This area is relatively protected from any strong
current, which is either diverted around the stone dike or passes over it, creating an area of slack
water along the bottom. Divers investigating this area noted little sandy sediment present above
the clay in the immediate vicinity of the dike, but within a few meters of the dike the sand layer
was well over 1 m deep. Tracing of the railroad rails in this area was difficult because of the depth
at which they were buried in the sand. This is also the area with the most concentrated magnetic
activity. All of the historic shorelines in Figure 36, from 1854 to 1882, cross the modem shoreline
right at this comer of the bay. Having observed the environment of Back Bay for over two months
and examining the historic data available, the authors believe that if additional significant historic
resources exist in the bay, they are most likely located in the northwest comer.
Regarding past and future impacts on the historic resources of Back Bay as part of
the Braws Santiago Depot National Register property, one cannot deny that past activities, ranging
from jetty construction to channel dredging, have had a direct, adverse impact on historical
resources in the area. However, once the jetties were completed and Back Bay formed, which
occurred more than fifty years ago, the damage to any historic resources in the open part of the
bay probably was essentially complete. Other impacts, such as boats anchoring in the bay over the
last fifty years, have been far less significant.
Indirect impacts have resulted from channel dredging, causing erosion of slopes into
the channel, and ship traffic, which causes strong currents and damaging wave fronts. Future
maintenance dredging or widening of the channel will continue to have some indirect impact on
the bay.
Other than the railroad, which is protected from indirect impacts by its mass,
significant historical resources within the bay, are expected to be limited primarily to the northwest
comer of the bay. In this area, they are protected by the stone dike. To minimize direct and
indirect impacts to this area, the stone dike must be maintained in its present location, and
consideration should be given to improving the dike, particularly if the channel is widened in this
vicinity.
ARTIFACT CURATION
Artifacts and remote sensing records collected during this investigation will be curated
at the Texas Archaeological Research Laboratory, Austin, Texas.
