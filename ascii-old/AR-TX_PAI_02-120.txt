ABSTRACT

From November 1996 10 fanuary 1997, personnel from Prewill and Associates, Inc., conduc1cd a survey
for cultur:tl resources 31 Red RhÂ·cr Anny Depol (RRAD) and Lone Siar Army Ammunition Planl (LSAAP) in Bowie
County, Texas. under Delivery Order 0007 ofCon1rnc1 DACA63-95-D-005 I with the U.S. Anny Corps of Engineers,
Fon Wonh Dislrict. The survey entailed 100 perccnl pedestrian coverage of 1,794 hec1ares (4,433 acres) within nine
survey areas, accompanied by historic archival research. Forly-lwo archeologicnl sites were recorded or rcevnlun1cd,
7 at RRAD and 35 al LSAAP. Six of these have only prehis1oric components, 34 have only historic components, and
2 have both prehistoric and historic components.
One prchis1oric sile al RRAD (41 BW622) was recommended as being potenlially eligible for Iisling in the
Na1ional Regis1cr of Historic Places. 11 was recommended tha1 the olher 6 silcs at RRAD be considered ineligible
for National Regis1er listing. Nine of the si1es al LSAAP were considered 10 be potentially eligible for listing in the
National Register. Two nre prehis1oric siles (4 1BW619 and 4 IBW624). Six ::trc fannste::tds assoeia1ed with EuroAmerican landowners during the mid to late nineteenth and early 1wcn1ieth cen1uries (4 IBW334, 4 IBW338,
41BW340, 41BW365, 41BW381, and 4 IBW618). The final Sile (4 IBW616) is the only known historic cemetery
assoeia1ed with African-American landowners. The remaining 25 si1es nt LSAAP were considered ineligible for
National Register \isling. As noled in Appendiit B, lhe Texas Historical Commission did nol concur with 1he
recommendations for six si1cs (41BW622al RRAD and 41BW365, 41BW381, 41BW616,4LBW618, and 4IBW619
al LSAAP).
The project also involved an effon 10 re-locate and mark 52 previously recorded siles thal nrc outside the
survey areas but within areas !hat are scheduled for timbering in the nenr future. This was intended 10 help prevent
disturbance of these sites, which have been recommended as being polcntially National Regis1er eligible or of
unknown eligibility. Seven of these appear to have been so disturbed !hat lhcy are assessed here as ineligible for
listing; lhe assessments for lhe olher 45 sites remain unchanged.

ACKNOWLEDGMENTS
Recognition and thanks are due to the individuals whose efforts brought th_is ~roject t~ a successful
conclusion. Stephen P. Austin of the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, Fort Worth District, provided excellent
coordination throughout the project. Mike Lockard, BRAC Coordinator for RRAD, and Terry Ruth, Forester at
RRAD/LSAAP, provided coordination with other facility managers and with plant security. Mr. Lockard's assistance
wilh on-the-ground logistics and information on the characteristics of the survey at RRAD was invaluable to the field
crew. He also assisted by making his office and files available to the historian, while providing her with introductions
to other employees who helped locate essential maps and property inventories.
Tasks assigned to the historian were facilitated by numerous individuals and organizations who offered
access to research materials without which the project could not have been completed. June E. Lindsey of Stewart
Title of Texarkana guided the historian in the use of the company's records. Jamie Simmons, curator at the
Texarkana Historical Museum (Texarkana Museums System), opened files and made suggestions about helpful
secondary sources. Staff at the Texarkana Public Library made their excellent local history collection available, while
those at Texarkana College assisted the historian in using local newspapers on microfilm. Jonathan Jay Jones Jr.,
owner of the Jonathan Jay Jones Funeral Home, generously attempted to locate individuals who had been associated
with Piney Grove Cemetery. Finally, Effie Langford McDermot, great-great-granddaughter of Willis W. Langford,
who was buried at 4 IBW365, graciously shared information she had collected about her ancestor and his family.
Research about the history of land use at Red River Army Depot and Lone Star Army Ammunition Plant
would not have been possible without the assistance of the staffs of the General Land Office archives and the
ge~ealo~ section of the Te~as ~tate ~ibrary and ~chives. Similarly, staff at the Center for American History, The
University of Texas at Austin, did their usual fine JOb of making assorted primary documents and second
materials available.

INTRODUCTION AND ENVIRONMENTAL
BACKGROUND

1
This report describes the results of a cultural resources survey of nine timber harvest areas encompassing 1,794 hectares (4,433 acres) with in the Red River
Anny Depot (RRAD) and Lone Star Army Ammunition Plant (LSAAP) located in Bowie County, Texas
(Figure I). This survey was undertaken in late 1996 to
early 1997 by Prewitt and Associates, Inc., under Delivery Order 0007 of Contract No. DACA63-95-D-005 l
with the U. S. Anny Corps of Engineers, Fort Worth
DistricL The project was conducted as part of RRAD/
LSAAP's planning and management responsibilities
under Section 110 (16 U.S.C. Â§ 470h-2) of the National
Historic Preservatio11Act (NHPA) as Amended Through
1992 (16 U.S.C. 470 et seq), specifically 16 U.S.C. Â§
470h-2(a)(2) of the Act. The planning survey of the nine
proposed timber harvesting areas and its results will
support the actual undertaking (timbering) and will be
subject to coordination between RRAD/LSAAP and the
Texas State Historic Preservation Officer as an undertaking (36 C.F.R. Â§ Â§ 800.2 through 800.5) per Section
106 (16 U.S.C. Â§ 470Â£) of the Act.
All previously known and unknown prehistoric and
historic cultural resources witJ1in the survey areas were
identified and/or reevaluated, and a preliminary assessment of their eligibility for listing in the National Register of Historic Places was made (antecedent to the
determinations of the agency). This was carried out by
a 100 percent pedestrian survey with shovel testing and
extensive archival investigations. Another task added
after the project began involved re-locating and marking 52 previously recorded arcbeological sites that had
been assessed as potentially eligible for National Register listing and that are in areas on RRAD/LSAAP that
will be timbered in the near future. Five previously unrecorded cultural resources, including 3 prehistoric sites
and 2 historic sites, were identified at RRAD. In addition, I previously recorded historic site and I historic/
prehistoric site were reevaluated and 34 sites were relocated and marked. At LSAAP, 8 new historic sites
and 3 new prehistoric sites were identified, while 23
historic and I historic/prehistoric sites were reevaluated and 18 sites were re-locatrd and marked.

This report presents environmental and cultural
background information and describes the methods used
in the survey following this introduction and in Chapters 2 and 3. The survey results are presented for each
installation separately in Cbapter4 (RRAD) and Chapter 5 (LSAAP). Descriptions of the survey areas associated with each installation are presented at the beginning of each results chapter, followed by new site descriptions, reevaluated site descriptions, a short summary concerning the re-located sites, and descriptions
of nonsite localities encountered. Finally, Chapter 6
summarizes tJ1e survey results by presenting the assessments and recommendations for all new and reevaluated sites.
The Red River Array Depot and the Lone Star Array
Ammunition Plant are contiguous facilities located in
east-central Bowie County, Texas, with the easternmost
boundary approxima1ely 9 miles west of the City of
Texarkana. Together the installations cover 34,626 acres
on the upland divide between the Red River to the north
and the Sulphur River to the south. The environmental
characteristics of this divide are discussed below.

GEOLOGY AND GEOMORPHOLOGY
The project area is within the northern edge of the
Gulf Coastal Plain physiographic province, which is
comprised ofrelatively young geological formations that
crop out in belts running parallel to the Gulf of Mexico
(Fenneman 1938; Sellards et al. 1966). Geological formations that occur within RRAD/LSAAP consist of silly
and sandy clays of the Wilcox and Midway Groups,
which are early Eocene in age (Bureau of Economic
Geology 1966). The Wilcox, the younger of the two, is
found in lhe southern and southeastern parts of the installations, while the Midway Group forms I.he uplands
in the northern part. Holocene or recent alluvium occurs within the floodplains of some of the creeks that
drain the southern half of the installations (Bureau of
Economic Geology 1966). Though the area of RRAD/
LSAAP can be charac1erized as gently rolling uplands,
some differences in landforms do occur. The eastern

and southern parls arc heavily dissected. Streams lhnt
cross this p:irt arc deeply incised, and floodplains associated with lhc larger streams are narrow. TI1c streams
and their Lributarics have fanned elongated inlcrfluvial
ridges, some of which arc composed of a series of
rounded knolls. Elevations in this dissected upland range
from 450 to 270 ft above mean sea level (amsl). In contrast, in the north and northwestern parts of RRAD/
LSAAP the land has Jillie relief and stream valleys arc
shallow. Elevations in this part oflhe uplands range from
390 to 330 fl amsl.
The flat expanses in the north and nonhwesl, as
well as some of the wider interfluvial ridges in the southern and eastern parts of the installations, arc oflcn covered by low rounded mounds not more than a meter
high. These mounds, which have been called pimple,
prairie, or mi ma mounds, are common geomorphological features, the origins of which have been debated.
They have been atLributcd to rodent burrowing (Cox
and Gakahu 1986). coppice dune formation (Holliday

composed of seven main series. These nrc divided into
mapping units such as the Sawyer-Eylnu-Woodtcll unit,
the Ruslon-McKnmic unit, and the Annona-Alsua unit
(Fox 1980).
At the southwestern corner of RRAD and in northeastern and eastern parts of LSAAP near Big Creek,
Rock Creek, Aiken Creek, and the headwaters of Jones
Creek, the soils have been mapped mainly as the SawycrEylau-Wood tell unit. These consist of well-drained to
moderately well drained to very slowly permeable loamy
soils (Pox 1980:5- 7). The Sawyer and Eylau soil series
arc found on the upland stream divides, while Woodtell
soils are associated with ridgetops and sideslopcs. The
Sawyer soils also contain small mounds. All three series have a surface layer that varies from dark grayish
brown to brownish silt loam or very fine sandy loam.
This surface layer can be 15 to 30 cm thick. Subsoils
can extend to al least 130-200 cm, with textures being
generally clayey and colors including yellowish brown,
brown, strong brown, gray, and red. These soils are well
suited lo paslurc and woodlands and are moderately well
suited to crops.
Jn the southeastern corner of RRAD near Elliotl
Creek Reservoir and in the southwestern part ofLSAAP,
the main soils have been mapped as Ruston-McKamie.
These loamy soils are also well drained to moderately
well drained Lo very slowly permeable. Fox (1980:7)
notes that the Ruston and McKamic series are typically
found high on alluvial terraces. 111c Ruston series, which
arc gently sloping 10 sloping, have a 13-cm-thick surface layer ofstrong brown fine sandy loam, below which
is about 40 cm of yellowish red fine sandy loam changing to a subsoil of red sandy clay loam wruch can extend to at least 200 cm. The McKamic series are generally strongly sloping with a surface layer of ca. 33 cm
of brownish loam. Subsoils at least 150 cm deep consist of red clay lo red sandy clay loam. All of these are
well suited to pasture and moderately well suited to
woodlands and crops (Fox 1980:8).
In the northwestern part ofRRAD across the headwaters of Big Creek, Rock Creek, and Caney Creek,
the mnin soils are mapped as the poorly drained Annona
and Alsua series (Fox 1980:9-10). Bolh are gently sloping to nearly level. The Annona soils have a surface
layer of 5 cm of dark brown loam over 30 cm of dark
brown lonm mauled with dark yellowish brown and
yellowish brown. The subsoil to nt least 200 cm is a
clay moulcd with red, browi1, and gray. The Alsua series has n I5-cm-thick surface layer of dark grayish
brown loam wilh a grayish brown to gray clay subsoil
that extends to at least 200 cm. These are moderately
well suited to pnsturc, woodlands, and croplands.

HYDROLOGY
The upland divide between the Red and Sulphur
Rivers within RRAD/LSAAP is dissected by low-order
intermittent and perennial streams. These streams transport run-off generated by an average annual rainfall of
44 inches (Fox 1980). The streams that llow to the
Sulphur River and drain the southern half of the installations arc Big Creek, Rock Creek, Caney Creek, Nculcs
Creek, the East Fork of Elli oil Creek, and Aiken Creek.
The southern streams arc perennial, carrying water
throughout the year. The substantial now of some of
these streams is demonstra1cd by the presence of Caney
Creek and Elliott Creek Reservoirs, which cover over
400 acres within the southern half of RRAD. In contrast, the streams in the northern half of the installations- Barkman Creek, Panther Creek, and Jones
Creek-arc intcnnillcnl and arc headwaters of tributaries to the Red River.

minor soils within the oreas described above. One example of a minor soil associated with the main series is
Woodtcll gravelly sandy foam. This soil can be found
on ridge tops witliin tl1e area of the Ruston-McKamfo
unit. The surfoce layer oftllis Woodtell soil, which consists of 30 cm of brownish gravelly sandy foam, was
often removed in historic times to obtain gravels (Fox
1980:34). These gravels arc likely associated with the
lag gravel deposits identified for Bowie County as a
lithic resource possibly utilized by prehistoric peoples
(Cliff 1994; Cliff, Hunt et al. 1996; Peler and Cliff
1990a). Other frequenlly occurring minor soils are
Sardis silt loam and Thensas fine sandy loam. Both of
these are dark brown bouomland soils and are frequently
flooded.
CLIMATE

The climate of Bowie County is affected by tropical air from the Gulf of Mexico, which makes for hot
humid summers and conlinentaJ cold blasts generating
short cool winters (Fox I 980). The average daily minimum temperature in the winter is 34Â° F, while the daily
maximum in the summer is 93Â° F. Extremes have been
recorded as -5Â° F and 108Â° F (Fox 1980). The growing
season extends from March to November, when the average daily temperature exceeds 50" F. The majority of
the yearly rainfall (23 inches, 52 percent) occurs between April and September. Fox (1980) reports that
snowfall is rare, with measurable snow seen in only 25
percent of the recorded winters. Thunderstorms occur
on about 50 days each year and are most common in
tlle spring. Severe storms and tornadoes also occur but
are sporadic and of short duration.
Climate has an impact on modern Jifeways in tlle
region, for instance by affecting agricultural and induslriaI practices. Past climatic conditions also had a bearing on prehistoric lifeways by affecting tlle availability
of resources. However, a reconstruction of past climatic

FLORA AND FAUNA

The modem forests tllat occur at RRAD/LSAAP
may be considered part of tlle Post Oak Savannah of
East Texas (Correll and Johnston 1979:3--{i). Found
within Lhis region is a mixture of pines and oaks with
pines occurring on tlle higher elevations and oaks and
other hardwoods predominating along streams and
within tlle bottomlands (Peter and C(jff 1990a:9-17).
Small sections of tall-grass prairie occur along with an
understory that is often composed of tall grasses. Common trees include loblolly, slash, and shortlcaf pines
along witll water oak, white oak, southern red oak,
swee1gum, blackgum, and eastern red cedar (Fox 1980).
Oilier trees tllat have occurred and/or slill occur within

panicum, beaked panicum, Indiangross, uniola, longleaf
uniola, purpletop, threeawn, sedge, and plumegrass (Fox
1980:9 1-95). Other shrubs and viney plants that make
up the unde.rstory are farkJeberry, green brier, American
beautyberry, hawthorn, sumac, honeysuckle, southern
wax myrtle, and tree huckleberry (Heartfield and Dieste
I 984b:2-5). Certain understory plants produced fruits
that were likely utilized by historic as well as prehistoric residents at RRADILSAAP. Some of these fruitbearing trees, shrubs, a nd vines are persimmon,
plum, cherry, blackberry, dewberry, wild strawberry,
and wild grape (Heartfield und Dieste I 984b:2-5
through 2-6).
The rich vegetal environment described above also
provides for a variety of fauna. Fifty species of mammals are reported lo occur in the region around RRAD/
LSAAP (Palmer 1954). Some of the species that would
have been important food resources include black bear,
white-tailed deer, squirrel, raccoon, beaver, opossum,
and possibly bison. The central route for North Ameri-

can migratory birds also passes within the vicinity of
RRAD/LSAAP. Thus, waterfowl would have been in
abundant supply during certain seasons. On a more regular basis, wild turkeys and pigeons could have provided
an ample food resource (Martin et al. 1951 : l07-l I I).
Raptors and songbirds are also common in the area.
Though these birds were probably not used for food,
they may have been collected by prehistoric peoples
for ceremonial purposes. Turtles and fishes would likely
have provided another abundant food resource in the
southern half of the facility where the larger streams
occur. Turtles known to have been collected for food
include the common snapping turtle, alligator snapping
turtle, painted turtle, and box turtle (Blair 1950:99-100).
Fish include catfish, gar, crappie, sunfish, bass, freshwater drum, buffalo, shad, sucker, carp, bow fin, shiner,
white bass, and pickerel (McCune 1971). Except for
bison and black bear, many of the animals named here
are still present within RRAD/LSAAP. White-tailed
deer, squirrel, and turkey are regularly hunted by local
people today.

ARCHEOLOGICAL AND IDSTORICAL
BACKGROUND

2
This cbapter summarizes tbe previous archeologica\ and historical investigations at Red River Army
Depot (RRAD) and tbe Lone Star Army Ammunition
Plant (LSAAP) and presents background information
on the prehistory and history of the area. The first section provides an overview of tbe sequence of past investigations. This is followed by a Native American
cultural history section and an overview of the area's
history to provide regional contexts for evaluation of
the sites.

that few sites had been recorded at the time the studies
were undertaken, effort was mainly directed at projecting where sites might occur. These backgrounds also
included proposed research directions for future investigations.
For prehistoric sites, a regional research perspective was drawn from the Texas State Heritage Conservation Plan (Brown et al. 1982) and the Arkansas State
Plan (Davis I982). Concern was expressed for exploring utilization of Lhe installations during Lhe Paleoindian
and Archaic periods, while infonnation relevant to understanding Lhe inter- and intraregional relationships that
led to sociopolitical development and the adoption of
horticulture during the Woodland period was also considered important. Also of concern was how Caddoan
settlement patterns evolved and how they would be expressed at the facilities. Lastly, an understanding of use
of the area during the Protohistoric period was thought
to be important given the proximity of a possible French
trading post to the installations.
The overviews for Lhe historic period began with
European exploration and early settlement ( 1542-1719),
and described Lhe expeditions of Hernando de Soto
(actually under the command of Luis de Moscoso de
Alvarado by 1542), Rene Robert Cavelier, Sieur de la
Salle and Henri de Tonti in 1683 (Tonti actually did not
visit Lhe region until 1689, and La Salle apparently did
not reach the area in bis 1687 voyage), Domingo Teran
de los Rios in 1691, and Jean Baptiste Benard de la
Harpe ( 1719), the last of which the authors believed
traversed the western portion ofLSAAP (Heartfield and
Dieste I 984a:2-23 through 2- 25). The plans discussed
early-nineteenth-century colonization activities under
the direction of Arthur G. Wavell, who secured a contract lo locate 500 families in northeast Texas. By 1830,
registration in Wavell's Colony consisted of 625 people,
including a number in the vicinity ofLSAAP and RRAD,
and in 1840, the Congress of Lhe Republic of Texas
created Bowie County.
Heartfield and Diestc briefly summarized the process by which selllers mnde claims and received patenL~
for land in Texas after 1844. They a.ssumed that all

PREVIOUS INVESTIGATIONS
1980 Survey
Archeological investigations began at RRAD/
LSAAP in I 980 with a survey of the cultural resources
that could be affected by the construction of a proposed
Southwestern Electric Company (SWEPCO) transmission line (Espey, Huston and Associates, Inc, 1980).
The transmission line right-of-way, which was 3.5 miles
long and 150 ft wide, crossed the southeastern corners
of both installations, encompassing approximately 26
hectares (64 acres). Four historic sites considered to
represent farmsteads and one cemetery were recorded.
These sites appeared to date from the late nineteenth
century to the early twentieth century.

1984 Overviews and Management Plans
Four years later, archeological overviews and management plans were developed for both facilities
(Heartfield and Dieste 1984a, 1984b). These studies
were part of a larger project undertaken for Lhe U.S.
Army Materiel Development and Readiness Command
(DARCOM), currently the U.S. Army Materiel Command (AMC), by Lhe National Park Service for all 72
active AMC installations. TI1ese studies provided information on Lhe natural history, prehistory, and history
oflhe facilities. Based on this background information,
the documents presented plans to manage known sites
and those sites likely to occur on the installations. Given

trihes and Euro-Americans into the area in response to
changes in Spanish colonization policy.
In discussing the Exploration and Colonization
period, Peter and Cliff (I 990a) noted that European and
Euro-American activities in northeastern Texas began
with penetration of the area in the middle sixteenth
century by survivors of the De Soto entrada, and they
emphasized trade and other relations that developed
between Europeans and resident Native American populations, an example of which was the trading post built
by Benard de la Harpe among the Nasoni in 1719. They
also pointed to conflicts that developed during the late
eighteenth century as immigrant Indian and EuroArnerican populations quickly outnumbered the original Caddoan inhabitants.
A period of what Peter and Cliff (1990a) designated Initial Settlement and Growth ( 1804-1860) was
facilitated by the 1803 Louisiana Purchase, when the
Unjted States began to encourage settlement in the region along the Red River. After 1818, settlement pushed
into prairies adjacent to river tributaries and along
Trarnmel's Trace, which ran from Arkansas southwest
through an area adjacent 10 the south edge of LSAAP
before continuing on to Nacogdoches. Formal attempts
to locate settlers in northeast Texas began in 1826, when
General Arthur Goodall Wavell was given a contract
by the State of Coahuila and Texas to settle 500 families south of the Red River. Several individuals Listed
on Wavell's Register received patents 10 land in RRAD
and LSAAP, and a number of them (Collin Akin and
George, Charles, and Jonathan Collum) established
plantations in the area. Another early settler whose home
was located on present-day RRAD was Hardin R. Runnels, a state representative ( 1847- 1855), lieutenant governor (1855), and governor (1857-1859) (Harper
l 996b:715).
Bowie County was established in 1840, and Boston
(now designated Old Boston) served as the county seat
from 1841 to the mid 1880s. Until 1876, Boston also
served as a commercial center for a population that Peter
and Cliff (I 990a:36-37) described as "small individual
fanners existing on a grain and livestock economy."
They were "basically subsistence farmers" who had been
joined in the 1830s by "an influx of planters and slaveholders primarily of southern origin" wbo brought
numerous slaves with them. Until the Civil War, cotton
was an important crop and was shipped by wagon to
Jefferson, the closest cotton market.
A third period entitled Civil War and Aftermath,
1860-1880, consisted of participation by local citizens
in a wartime economy and in armed conflict outside of
Bowie County. Significant change occurred after the
war as the plantation system broke down and tenant and

1988-1989 Survey
From 1988 to 1993, Geo-Mari ne completed a series
of cultural resources surveys. l11e first, undertaken from
December 1988 through J:mu:iry 1989, covered 3,318
hectares (8,200 acres) across both installations (Peter
and Cliff l 990a). l11is survey set the stage for all later
work on prehistoric sites by using an ecological
approach with an emphasis on exploring settlementsubsistence patterns though time. This was done with
recognition ofRRAD/LSAAP as a segment of a regional
settlement-subsistence system that encompassed both
the Red River drainage to the north and the Sulphur
River drainage to the south. Therefore, site context, function, and chronological placement could be determined
best on a regional scale (Peter and Cliff 1990a:41). In
this way, the investigators provided a basis for assessing sites for National Register eligibility. A total of 100
sites were recorded during this survey, consisting of27
prehistoric sites, 55 historic sites, and 18 prehistoric/
historic sites. Most of the prehistoric sites were located
in the Sulphur Ri ver drainage, and it appeared that there
was a Link between site occurrence and vegetation, soil
type, and proximity to permanent water (Peter and Cliff
1990a:28 l-287).
Archival research fo llowed recommendations
made by Heartfield and Dieste in 1984 and resulted in
the identification of 468 potential historic sites based
on maps and other documents, selection of a representative sample of the sites for detalled archjval research,
preliminary assessment of sites for National Register
eljgibility, and formu lation ofrecommended treatments
for sites judged to be of unknown eligibility. Archival
research consisted of deed/title research using records
available at the Bowie County Courthouse, examination of census records and tax rolls, and informant interviews.
As a result of their research efforts, the authors presented an expa nded background (Peter and Cliff
I 990a:34-36) that was organized into four periods:
Exploration and Colonization; Initial Settlement and
Growth, 1804-1860; Civil War and Aftermath, 18601880; and Commercialization, 1880-1940. They summari zed scholarship about the Kadohadacho Confederacy, which "apparently controlled the entire Texas
portion of the Great Bend region," and discussed the
Little Ri ver and Chakanina phases, the associated ceramic assemblages, and impacts of European-introduced
diseases on Caddoan groups. They described abandonment of the Great Bend region by the Kadnhadacho prior
to 1790, and the movement of immigrant U.S. Indian

sharecropping systems developed. Facilitated by railroad construciion, immigrncion greatly increased. However, the authors conlended that "most fanns in Dowie
County were operated by tenants or sharecroppers" by
1900 (Pecer and Cliff I 990a:39).
A final period consisced of Commercialization,
1880-1940, as railroads expanded and lumbering became an important industry. Until midcentury, lumber,
cotton, beef and dairy cattle, and crops such as wheat,
soybeans, milo, com, and rice played major economic
roles (Peter and Cliff 1990a:39).
Investigations of 73 historic sites at the installations (Peter and Cliff 1990a:288-294) led researchers
to conclude that initial settlement concentrated in three
areas, each with distinctive attributes attractive to early
setllers. The western section (Thompson, Ball, and Si the
Surveys) included parts of Rice's Prairie and lay within
the Big Creek drainage system (Figure 2). The southeastern section was proximate to Trammel 's Trace. The
third section, in the west-central portion of the project
area (Akin, Harper, TilJer, Collom, Lewis, and Paxton
Surveys), included surveys !hat fronted on !he Red River
and lay only partially in the installations. The river and
Dayton's Road, which ran east-west through the southern portions of these surveys, would have been powerful auractions to prospective settlers.
In general, early sites were located along the Old
Boston to Texarkana Road, which ran east-west through
the central portion of Red River Army Depot and Lone
Star Army Ammunition Plant, and along Dayton's Road
to the north. They also were located in uplands adjacent to water sources. These three factors-proximity
to roads, uplands, and water-led Warren Hooks to establish a plantation in the region north of the project
area.
Early speculation appears to have played a role in
the patenting, if not the settlement, of some tracts in the
survey area. Indeed, wilh the exception of the George
W. Tiller Survey, which was occupied by the Tiiier family by J838, the project area was less desirable than
other parts of central Bowie County, and few settlers
Jived there. Peter and Cliff (I 990a:290-29 I) also concluded that the profile of the lypical resident by I 850
was that of a "small landowner who used slave or employee labor to some degree." Furthennore, they maintained that this pattern continued into the 1860s, with
settlement clustering along roads that connected direc!ly
with Boston and farmers who raised couon, corn, and
sweet and Irish potatoes.
The end of the Civil War was accompanied by on
end of slavery, which "was not widely used within !he
project area .. ."(Peter and Cliff 1990a:291). They
also believed that slavery was "not so deeply established
10

in the area ... that a new economy and land-use strategy could not quickly evolve to take lhe place of the
old structure, and even take advantage of the new situation-that of lhe landless Freedmen." Some land was
sold 10 African-Americans by lhe 1870s; more property was sold to speculators (Peter and Cliff I 990a:292).
While the Bowie County population decreased
slightly between I 860 and I 870, ii more than doubled
during the next decade. Railroad construction brought
new settlers and stimulated expansion of the lumber
industry and of cotton cultivation. In addition, AfricanAmericans purchased land in the project area and established farmsteads. Wilh increased population, residents
established schools and churches, and occasionally the
population was sufficiently great to justify lhe presence
of general stores (Peter and Cliff I 990a:292-293).
The rate of immigration to Bowie County slowed
after 1880, but population increased at a rate of
ca 25 percent per decade until 1930, nonetheless. Peter
and Cliff (1990a:293) maintained that this increase in
population was paralleled by a "gradual decrease in the
sizes of the tracts owned in !he RRAD/LSAAP project
area." Owners of large tracts rented them to sharecroppers or ocher tenants, and 1hey negotiated timber and
oil leases with operators. However, the small landowner
was prominent in the area by J 900, with farms of less
than JOO acres becoming increasingly common. The
authors postulated that African-Americans tended to
own smaller tracts than Euro-Americans and to display
greater longevity of occupation (Peter and Cliff
1990a:293-294). Euro-Americans who owned moreextensive fannsteads were more likely to keep their land.
However, the authors believed that by ca. 1920-1935,
occupants were leaving the area.
1989 Survey
From September to November of 1989, GeoMarine conducted a survey focusing on historic resources at LSAAP (Peter and Cliff l 990b). The purpose of this survey was to locate all historic sites with
subterranean features, such as cisterns or wells, in previously unsurveyed areas of the facility as part of an
environmental investigation of hazardous waste conlamination. Historical records were used to indicate the
locations of ca. I 00 possible historic housesites. These
possible sites were then spot-checked. Eight hectares
(20 acres) of proposed timber harvesl areas were subjected to pedestrian survey for every site short of 1he
I 00 that was not localed (Peter and Cliff I 990b:25). In
all, 77 sites were recorded, consisting of 6 I historic, I2
prehistoric, and 4 prehistoric/historic sices. As with the
1988- 1989 survey, assessments of prehistoric sites were

populated by subsistence farmers who "did not rely
heavily on slave labor" (Peter and Cliff 1990b:21), although they also noted the high percentages of slaves
in the county in 1850 nod 1860 (Peter and Cliff
1990b:22). The authors also mninmined that the "landless Freedmen," who were numerous after the Civil War,
were "without the resources to purchase their own land"
and "necessarily became share-tenant and sharecroppi ng farmers working for tl1e speculators." Nonetheless,
some African-Americans acquired land, and theirnuinbers "increased steadily into the 20th century. ..."
199G-1991 Cultural Resources
Managem ent Pl an
The dat.a generated by all of the surveys to that point
were summarized and used by Geo-Marine to develop
a Cultural Resource Management Plan (CRMP) for both
RRAD and LSAAP (Pe1er et al. 1991). The goal of this
CRMP was to provide for the "successful integration
of cuhural resource management with nlission managemenl so tha1 mission goals may be obtained wi thout
unnecessary delay and that significant cultural resources
may be preserved for future generations" (Peter et al.
.1991 :U: I). To achieve this goal, the CRMP provided
mstruc ll on on what constituted a significant cultural
~esource, al~n.g with a resource protection plan spellmg out explicit resource avoidance or mitigation procedures (Peter el al. 199J :fV-I through TV-25, VI-1
through VI-25).

menl. In addition. some evidence was collected that
suggested that 1he presence of high-quality lilhic re.
sources affected the utilization o f some peripheral drainages (Cliff and Peter 1994:225).
Tue organization of the historic o verview presented
in thi s report (Cliff and Peter 1994:32- 36) was modified from earlier reports so that the years from 1542 to
present were organized into five subdivis ions: European
Exploration an cl Coloniza1ion ( 1542-1 803), Initial
North American Sculcment and Growth (1804-1860),
Civil War and Aftermath (J 860-1870), lnitial Commercialization (I 870-1920), and Depression and Recovery ( I 920-present). Some addition al contextual information was provided for the Civil War period. However, the outl1ors made few other changes to the overviews presc111ed in earlier publications. They analyzed
all recorded historic sites and provided complete or nearcomplete title information for about half of them. Apparently, no relevant census or tax research was done,
resulting in limited substantive data from which to draw
meaningful conclusions or on wh ich to base m odifications to the previous historic overviews.
1992Survey
In 1992,a IOJ-hectare(250acres)survey was completed in the northwestern comer of LSAAP ( Hunt
1992). No new sites were found. Given the location o f
~e.survey area in the uplands adjacent to the drainage
dw1.de ~d ~e results of the previous surveys, the Jack
of sites m this area is not surprising.
1993 Survey
One year later in 1993, Geo-Marine completed a
survey of 1,342 hectares (3,3 17 acres) spread across
both ~ and LS'."-~ (Cliff, Hunt et al. 1996). A

diverse loot nssemblnges contain ing relali ve ly large
proportions of expcdicnl tools, limited tool cu ration and
recycling compared to lhe Paleoindian period, reasonably dislinclive regional artifact styles, nnd the appearance of ccmclcries. From these observations, she goes
on to suggest lhal Archaic period adaptations involved
the seasonal foraging and hunting of a wide variety of
resources, with plant foods attaining grealer importance;
exploitation patterns that were more inlensive and more
focused geogrnphically than we re patterns of
Paleoindian land use; better-defined and less-extensive
group territories; decreased residential mobility and
hence less direct access to nonlocal ma terials; and more
involvement in trade relationships as a means of solving economic and social problems. While Archaic artifacts are common in the region, excavated sites that are
predominantly Archaic in age or where Archaic components can be isolated from later components are rare.
Some of the excavated Archaic sites in the region include Jake Martin in Upshur County (Davis and Davis
1960), Yarbrough in Van Zandt Counly (Johnson 1962),
Finley Fan in Hopkins County (Gadus et al. 1992),
Tankersley Creek in Titus County (Young 1981), and
41BW422 in Bowie County (Tucker 1994).
Finley Fan and 4IB W422 may be most similar to
the sites that are likely to occur within RRAD/LSAAP,
as both are situated along tributary streams of major
drainages. Recent research at these sites supports some
of the pauerns outlined above. For instance, lithic artifacts recovered from 41BWl22 indicate an emphasis
on the use of Red River gravels and lag gravels available in the immediate site vicinity (Tucker 1994:6). This
selection of gravels fits the pattern of locally focused
resource utilizalion which may be related to decreased
residential mobility. A similar pattern occurs on the
upper Sulphur River at the Finley Fan site. Again, use
of local lithic materials is almost exclusive, suggesting
that this Archaic group did not range widely (Gadus et
al. 1992:79-84). The Finley Fan site also is characterized by a low nrtifnct density with a relatively large proportion of expedient tools, lack of diversity in feature
types, and small occupational loci (Gadus et nl.
1992:77). TI1esc characteristics point to repeated but
short-term occupations by small groups.
TI1e Woodland period (200 B.C.-A.D. 800) covers
lheca. 1,000-year span that was marked by a conlinued

NATIVE AMERICAN

CULTURE HISTORY
Occupation of the area surrounding RRAD/LSAAP
during the Paleoindian period ( 10,000-{)00Q e.c.) is
demonstrated by the frequent, if not abundant, occurrence of projectile points such as Clovis, Dalton, San
Patrice, Scousbluff and other dislinctive 1ools such as
Albany scrapers, Red River knives, and Dalton adzes
(SlOl)' 1990: 177) at sites such as Jake Martin in Upshur
County (Davis and Davis 1960) and Forrest Murphey
in Marion County (Story 1990: 180). Paleoindian points
have also been reported from the Red River drainage
and Wright Patman Lake in the immediate vicinity of
RRAD/LSAAP (Story 1990: 191-207), and a Plainview
point, a less easily recognizable Paleoindian point type,
was recovered from the test excavalions at 41BW182
at RRAD itself (Cliff and Peter 1988:48). Often, lhe
Paleoindian materials occur as single artifacts or are
from mixed contexts. Still, from the few more extensive deposits such as those sites named above, some
general observations about Jifeways for this period can
be made.
Story (1990:177; Story et al. 1990:425-426) observes that Paleoindian sites typically contain limited
amounts of refuse and that lhe assemblages are marked
by the following: high selectivity in tool types with carefully fashioned bifaces and unifaces being especially
common; extensive curation, refurbishing, and recycling
of tools; frequent use of high-quality, often nonlocal,
lithic materials; a near absence of tools and facilities
indicative of plant processing; and broad distributions
of particular artifact styles. Based on 1hese characteristics, she speculales that Paleoindian adaptations in northeaslern Texas involved high residential mobility and
large territories, short-li ved occupations by small groups
at individual sites, low population densities and hence
l.ittle competition for resources, a generalized subsistence strategy focusing on hunling rather than plant collecting, and fluidity in group composition and movement as a means of avoiding or resolving economic or
social problems.
The remains of occupations by Archaic groups
(6000-200 e.c.), especially late Archaic peoples, are
abundant in northeastern Texas, allhough a complete
sequence of artifact styles and assemblages has yet to
be developed. Accord ing to Story (1990:2 13; Story c t
al. 1990:426), Archaic period sites arc characterized
by greater quantities of refuse, lhe appearance of tools
and facilities suggestive of plant processing, tools that

As for em lier time periods, rcla1ivcly liulc is known
about lntc Caddoan use of the lower Sulphur River baÂ·
sin south of the project area. Two of the three cxcaÂ·
vatcd sites at Wright Patman Lake contained late
Caddoan components, however, nnd both appear 10 repÂ·
resent small fanmteads or hamlets (Jelks 1961:36, 65).
Based on proximity to the Great Bend of the Red River,
it seems likely that this area was occupied by sedentary
agriculturalists during this interval. This is supported
by the data from 41 MX5, a small, late Caddoan hamlet
in Morris County which contained evidence of perhaps
two domiciliary structures associated with burials and
which yielded small quantities of maize and squash
(Brewington et al. 1995). Recent work at the White Oak
Creek Mitigation Area in Bowie, Cass, and Morris
Counties (Cliff 1994: 197; Cliff and Hunt 1995: 145, 206)
has identified a few sites with late Caddoan components
(e.g., 41CS151 and 41CS1551156), but these do not
seem to represent intensive occupations, and most may
reflect use for procurement/processing purposes rather
than domiciliary activities.
Caddoan lifeways were profoundly affected by
European contact. Contact began for the Caddoan area
with the coming of the De Soto entrada in 1542, though
European diseases spreading through the Native ArneriÂ·
can populations may have affected the Caddo by the
early 1500s (Perttula 1992: 19). Gradually, the pressures
of population decline from disease and raiding by other
displaced native groups caused a breakdown in tradiÂ·
tional boundaries. Between 1700 and 1800, Caddoan
groups were on the move, seeking alliances with other
surviving Caddo. Peruula (1992: 155) states that sites
from this time period are generally small farmsteads
and hamlets, sometimes associated with a household
cemetery. These farmstead sites comprised dispersed
communities (Pertlula 1992: 155-160). Such groups of
sites from this period in the Great Bend include the Spirit
Grove locality in the south, includLng Cedar Grove,
Friday, Shaw-Russell, McClure, Battle, Rube, Russell,
and Lester Bend (Schambach et al. 1982; Trubowitz
1984), with Crenshaw in the north (Gregory 1973). On
the Red River in northern Bowie County, 1hc Hatchel,
Mitchell, and Moores sites, along with the Roseborough
Lake site, have historic components (Gilmore 1986;
Wedel 197&). These sites probably represent the upper

Nusuni village visilcd by La Harpe and others in the
late 1600s and early 1700s (Wedel 1978).
The Roseborough Lake silc is also thought to have
been 1hc location of a trading post established by Alexi~
Grappe in ca. 1731- 1733 (Gilmore 1986: 13-1 4). Along
wiU1 native-made ceramics and lithics, lhc site produced
a variety of European goods including gun parts, axes,
knives, ceramics, and glass beads. The post continued
as a French garrison until Louisiana was ceded to Spain
in 1763, and then it continued only as trading house
until 177& (Miroir ct al. 1975: 162-163).
Hisloric silcs on the lower Sulphur River in northÂ·
cast Cass County include the Allanta State Park site
(Harris cl al. 1980:231-239), the Clements site (Dickson
1941: 117-132; Lewis 1987), and the Hunt site (Jackson
n.d.). Based on the ceramics and trade goods recovered, the sites are thought to have been occupied before
the mid-eighteenth century (Perttula 1992: 171-172),
and they may have been associated with the Nasoni
Caddo, who controlled a portage on the Caddo Trace
connecting the northern Caddoan groups with the southern Caddoan groups of east Texas.
By 1790, the various Caddoan groups that had lived
in the Great Bend region had abandoned the area after
severe raids by the Osage. They moved south to join
with groups living near Caddo Lake. Eventually, presÂ·
sure from continued American expansion pushed the
Caddo groups and remnants of Shawnee, Delaware,
Quapaw, Cherokee, Choctaw, Biloxi, and AlabamaÂ·
Coushalla deeper into Texas (Winfrey and Day
1995:14-16). Competition for limited resources between these groups and continued conflict with settlers
led to the removal of most groups from Texas to the
Indian Territory in southeastern Oklahoma in 1859. By
1890, the remaining Caddo living in the Indian Territory numbered just 539 individuals (Wooten 1986:756).

HISTORICAL BACKGROUND
The historic sites investigated during this project
range in age from the 1850s to World War II. Their
addition to previous inventories makes it possible to
contribute to and, in certain areas, modify the historic
settlement overview provided in Cliff and Peter
(1994:32-36, 225-231 ). Sufficient sites were recorded
in 1997 10 effectively utilize census and ad valorem tax
records on a facility-wide basis between 1850 and 1870.
However, only a handful of historic sites were recorded
on RRAD, and those are distributed over a broad area.
The great majorily of sites recorded are located in
LSAAP in the Memphis, El Paso, and Pacific Railroad
Company, David Jarrell, and J. W. Lane Surveys, the
southern portion of 1he Mary Burnsides Survey, and the

Boston, which remained an economic center unt il co â¢
struction of the rai lroad in 1876 and the county ~
unti l the mid 1880s (not 1846). Census records, fore~.
ample, suggest that population was concentrated in the
Boston [Old Boston) area in the William F. Thompson
and J. Ball Surveys. James Estil had modest improvements in the Thompson Survey and probably was representative of the yeoman farmer pallern described by
Cliff and Peter. However. a major plantation was I~
cated in the area as well. Owned by J. and J. R. Moss,
who also owned land in the A. J. Titus and T. F. Titus
Surveys, the plantation operation was a substantial one,
as evidenced by Moss's 57 slaves. Boston itself was
described by one observer as the "nucleus toward which
flowed the mass of drift-wood from the outJying districts...."During the Civil War, it had a population of
300-400, "a wide trade territory," and "an extensive
business in all lines.. .. " Residents at that time included
individuals whose names eventually became linked with
the development of agriculture and land in the project
area, including W. E. Massenberg, John H. Smithers,
and B. T. Estes (Watlington 1920:46, 49).
What Cliff and Peter defined as the west-central
ponion of the study area actually appears to have been
two sections, only one of which lay within the presentday boundaries of the RRAD and LSAAP. The bulk of
this west-central portion was comprised of large tracts
that lay between the north edge of the two facilities along
Dayton's Road and the Red River to the north. Initial
orientation of these tracts probably was to the Red River,
with a later shift south to Dayton's Road . Owners included Catherine Collom, L. M. Rice, Charles Lewis,
and the partnership of Rice and Mason, who operated
major plantations that were only coincidentally linked
with the project area. Within the facilities themselves.
development in the central portion by 1850 appears to
have occurred in the Tiller Survey, where Susan Tiller
operated a modest-sized plantation which she worked
with five slaves. Use of the Harper Survey may have
been less intense, with local property owner Hiram
R unnels's improvements being located outside the
project area on the 0. S. Osgood Survey.
A third , loosely organized area was located in the
eastern and southeastern portions of the two facilities
by 1850, a fact that contradicts Cliff and Peter's
( 1994:228) conclusions that settlement in this area w:is
associated predominantly with the Old Boston-ArkanslS
Road and th at there was no evidence that the arl!a of
Trammel 's Trace was attracting setllemcnt at that time.
Rather, census and ad valorcm tax records indic:ue the

nonhwestcm portion of the Nancy Dycus Survey. As o
result. conclusions concerning population, settlement,
and ethnic patterns hetween 1880 and World War II arc
restricted to LSAAP.
CliIT and Peter ( 1994:32-34, 225) characterized
the years up to 1870 in the vicinity orRRAD and LSAAP
as ones of slow population growth that began along the
Red Ri,Â·er and later spread into the prairies along river
tributaries and early roads such as Trammel's Trace (at
the southeastern edge of LSAAP) and Dayton's Road
(which bordered the two faci lities on the norlh). 111ey
identified the county seal of Boston as an imporlant
commercial and political center until 1846, when they
believed that the seal was moved from Boston lo a new
location Lo the north, an event that they concluded resulted in the construction of a new road throug h the
center of the future RRAD and a shirt in settlement (Cliff
and Peter 1994:230). Earliest selllers in the area were
characterized as being subsistence farmers, for the most
pan, who lived on small holdings and whose economy
was based on grain and livestock production. Commercial production of cotton began in the 1830s and was
accompanied by the introduction of increasing numbers
of slaves, who comprised more than half the total population of Bowie County in 1850 and 1860. The Civil
War was not a source of disruption in the county, but
the 1860s were not a decade of growth and development either. Indeed, Cliff and Peter ( 1994:225-226)
characterized the 1860s as being years of "settlement
stability" during which "Bowie County as a whole saw
a reduction in population of about 7 percenL ..." In
RRAD and LSAAP, settlement appeared to be concentrated in three areas, defined by the authors as a "western section," which included Rice's Prairie and the Big
Creek drainage (the J. Ball, Francis Sythe, and William
F. Thompson Surveys); a "west central portion" that
included surveys bounded by the Red Riveron the north
and Dayton's Road on the south (the Collin M. Akin,
J. Paxton, Charles Collom, Jonathan Collom, George
Collom, Charles Lewis, James Harper, and George W.
Tiller Surveys); and a "southeast comer" that was in
close proximity to Trammel'sTrace (the Nancy Dycus,
J. W. F. Elliott, and Jonathan S. Herring Surveys). The
authors suggested that the Red River, Dayton's Road,
and Trammel's Trace were "importan t links for the
cotton-growing p lantation economy; while secondary
roads, such as the Old Boston-[ Arkansas] Road and the
Boston to Ingersoll (Redwater) Road were more important for the yeoman-farming economy" (Cliff and
Pe1er 1994 :227).
Research cond ucted in 1997 based on census, nd
valorem tax, and other pri mary reco rds suggests that,

David Jarrett had 40 cattle; the Elliott Survey. where
J. W. Lupton raised horses and cattle; the Shocklee Sur,Â·ey. where David Jarrett owned land and Samuel
McAdams probably lived with three slaves; the Herring
Survey. where J. Maddin operated a modest plantation
with two sla\'es; and the Hamilton Sur\'ey. location of
Edwin Carrol's modest improvements.
By 1860, the pattern of the previous decade had
intensified and improvements had been constructed on
more surveys in the project area. The continuin2 imponance of Boston as a commercial and politicalcenter was paralleled and fueled by the presence of nearby
plantations owned by R. N. Woodward and A. G.
Hoskins on the Thompson Survey, and the sizeable plantation operated by Dr. Isaac M. Ball, who owned 21
slaves. Adjoining to the east, E. C. Turner kept 20 slaves
and substantial numbers of livestock on the Sythe and
Recd Surveys, the latter of which also was the location
of improvements owned by John Sharp, George
McCollom, and Council Miller. John Tiii owned 150
acres to the north, where he lived on the Akin Survey
(Texas. Comptroller of Public Accounts 1860; U.S.
Bureau of the Census 1860b).
The middle part of the two facilities, lying in the
Harper, Tiller, Lindsay, and McAdams Surveys, was
home to the modest improvements of Benjamin
Blanchard (Harper Survey); C. E. McCulohum, who
owned 12 slaves (Harper Survey); A. L. Hulms, who
owned 13 slaves (Harper and Tiiler Surveys); John
Lamly, who had modest improvements on the Tiiler
Survey; Bethany Webb, who had a small plantation of
320 acres and 4 slaves on the McAdams Survey; and
Rohen Crossland, who had improved acreage in the
Lindsay Survey. The eastern third of the facilities remained the home of David Jarrett (Jarrett Survey) and
Joanna McAdams (Shocklee Survey). New residents
included A. R. Moores, who had immigrated to Bowie
County with his parents in 1840 and established a plantation in the Lane Survey after 1850, when he owned
13 slaves, horses, and cattle. His neighbor was L.[?] C.
Elliott, who owned 5 slaves. To the southwest of Moores
and Elliott, on the Shocklec Survey, Joanna McAdams
had been joined by JamesG. Holloway, who also owned
land in the Moore Survey and had 17 slaves. On the
Herring Survey to the south, Patrick Creud owned improved acreage, as did John Dunaway. S. D. Elliott had
filed on the area's first preemption claim where he raised
horses and cattle (Texas. Comptroller of Public Accounts I 860; U.S. Bureau of the Census 1860b).
Heads of family who can be identified in census
and tax records as living in the area of the RRAD and
LSAAP in J 860 ranged in age from 24 to 55, with the

:\\'cragc age being 38. They were born in Alabama.
Georgia. Kentucky. Louisiana. North Carolina. South
Carolina. Tennessee. and Virginia, while their spouses
were from Georgia. Kentucky. North nnd South Carolina, and Tennessee. Moores had arrived in the Bowie
County area hy 1840 and McAdams hy 1843. but the
other famil ies had immigrated between 1853 and 1859.
Many of the families were wealthy. their social status
being identi ficd by a census taker who described many
of the females as "lady." However. the nrca also was
home to numerous individuals who were listed on the
census but owned no property. Among these were the
G. H. McAdams family (G. H. McAdams probably being the son of Joanna McAdams but living near her in a
separate household), M. Blanchard from Florida,
William Hammutt from Georgia, and H. J. Williams of
Tennessee.
According to Cliff and Peter ( 1994:230), rural
growth in the study area resumed during the 1870s, with
notable growth occurring in the south-central and southeastern ponions of LSAAP and along Rock Creek on
RRAD. They speculated that the growth may have reflected n regional reorientation brought on by the construction of a railroad line, the founding of Texarkana
in 1874, and the development of the lumber industry.
Notable settlement during this decade identified in
LSAAP in 1997 included a site associated with the John
and Elizabeth King family in the Mary Burnsides Survey (41BW361 ). The Kings were present in the county
by 1865 and acquired a large portion of the Burnsides
Survey in 1871. There, they established a center of settlement on the Boston lo Arkansas Road that flourished
with the creation of a post office despite their loss of
much of the land by 1880. By the 1880s, the Kings had
been joined by the Willis W. Langford and John King
Van Pell fami lies at 4 IBW465, a second generation of
the David Jarrell family on the Jarrell Survey, and D. S.
Cantrell al 4 I BW34 l . The Kingsville post office continued to function in a community that was largely white
but which included some African-Americans. Portions
of the I 880 census that embraced the areas around the
four sites recorded in 1997 listed approximately 38
households and 196 individuals. or these, approximately
24 were African-Americans, most of whom lived in one
specific area. All heads or households listed their OCCUÂ·
pations as fnnners regardless of ethnic affiliation, and
they ranged in age from 46 to 54.
By 1900, ownership and settlement in LSAAP had
expanded. Selllement of specific sites recorded in 1997
enumcrnted new occupations by Payton Payton at
41 BW379, Eli Boone at 41 BW38 I , H. C. Presley al
41 BW334, and Dnvis Jnckson 111 41 BW332; and continued occupution by the David Jarrell family in the
17

Red Ril'er Am1y Depot and lone Star Anny Ammunition P/0111
Jarrett Sur\'ey (possibly at 4 IBW6 I 8) and D.S. Cantrell
at 4 lBW34 l. Census records indicate that families in
the area of these recorded sites totaled approximately
79, embracing approximately 400 individuals. Of these,
86 percent were Euro-American and 14 percent were
African-American. Unlike the commu nity demographics from 1880, when the African-American families
lived in close proximity to one another, demographics
at the turn of the century indica ted that AfricanAmerican families were more evenly distributed
throughout the larger community, so that neighbors often were members of different races. This pattern on
LSAAP varies from that described in Cliff and Peter
(1994:36) who noted that "[African-Americans] often
settled in dispersed rural communities separate from
those of their white neighbors." Sign ificantly, the majority of heads of households in the area owned their
farms (54 percent), a statistic that was skewed by the
greater proportion of whites vs. blacks that owned farms
(80 percent vs. 44 percent). The pattern of ownership
reflected in the 1900 census for the LSAAP area differed from that described for northeast Texas by Cliff
and Peter ( 1994:35), who stated that much productive
land was held by absentee landlords who used AfricanAmerican or poor Euro-American sharecroppers or tenants to replace the pre-1866 plantation system: " ... by
the beginning of the twentieth century, the bulk of the
rural farms in Northeast Texas were operated by sharecroppers or tenants."
By 1910, recorded households in the central portion of LSAAP included those of Walter H. Nelson at
41BW177, John E. Rounsavall at 41BW332, Harry E.
Presley at 41 BW334, Jack Starkes (poss ibly at
41BW335), Eli Boone at 4IBW381, Will F. Harvey at
41BW367, Payton Payton at 41BW379, and James
Kenne~ _an d John King at 41BW340. Approximately
60 families were located in the vicinity ofSection 27 of
the Memphis, El Paso, and Pacific Railroad Company
Survey, the northeast comer of the Nancy Dycus Survey, and the J. W. Lane Survey. An additional 20 fami-

18

lies were located in the portion of the Burnsides Survey
north of the Jarrett Survey. Interestingly, the proportion
of African-Americans and/or mulattos in the area had
increased from 14 percent in 1900 to almost 20 percent
in 1910. H owever, in a reversal of the relatively in tegrated situation that appeared to exist in 1900, the great
majority of African -Ameri cans Lived in close proximity to one another, a large communjty of them concentrating in the southeast com er ofLSAAP. This concentration may have reflected an involvement in lhe major
lu mber mill a l Redwater that was described by Cliff and
Peter (1994:36).
The I920census indicates that settlement remained
intensive in the Burnsides; Dycus; Memphis, E l Paso,
and Pacific Railroad Company; and Lane Surveys until
at least that date. Families present with whom si tes were
identified in 1997 included those of James Kenney at
4 1B W 340, James F. Witme r at 41BW361 and
4 1BW362, Avery C. Breed at 41BW363, Thomas C.
White at 4IBW387, Lonnie H . Harvey at 4 IBW366,
Albert E. Dedmon at 4 IBW367, Tildy Payton at
41BW379,Levi Booneat4IBW38I, Walter H . Ne lson
at 41BWI 77, Byron Brewer [also spelled Browe r] at
41BW332, and H. E. Presley at 4 IBW334. Many of
these families reflected a second-generation occupation
of land that bad belonged to their parents, or settlement
on new property near tracts that their parents had settled
earlier. However, Cliff and Peter (I 994:36) pointed
~ut that this trend of growth and long-tenn occupaLi o n subsequently cha nged in much of northeast
Texas, where the rural population between ca. 1920
and 1935 "see.ms to have generally declined . . . "

1870) may be associated with surface water (Peter et
al. 1991:IV-17). [n general, likely areas for historic sites
were identified using archival information such as deed
records, property maps, and two early USGS 15-minute
quadrangles (New Boston, fieldwork in 1906; and
Texarkana, fieldwork in 1904) to pinpoint old roads and
suggest possible structure locations. Most of the historic
sites in Survey Arca 4 at LSAAP had been previously
recorded usihg this search melhod (Peter and Cl iff
1990b:25). The likely areas for historic sites defined in
this way were explored using the same transect spacing
and shovel-testing intensity as were areas considered Lo
have some potential for prehistoric sites. However, as
it turned our.. shovel tests were not critical to historic
site discovery, as crew members usually sponed domestic plants, surface features, or artifact scatters before
shovel tests were dug.
Areas where sites were considered most likely were
covered using pedestrian transects s paced al 20-m
intervals with an average of one shovel test for every 3
acres. These shovel tests were placed judgmentally on
landforms identified as likely to contain sites. Low
probability areas had transect spacing of25-30 m with
one shovel test for every 4 to 6 acres. Transect spacing
was altered al times lo avoid obstructfons such as
flooded or clear-cut areas. In order Lo make probability
designations more meaningful, large s urvey areas were
divided into subareas. A subarea was a division of a
sur vey area based on man-made and/or natu ral
boundaries. Subareas were labeled with the survey area
number followed by a letter designation. Shovel tests
within an area and/or subarea were numbered sequentially, as were temporary s ite designations and locality
designations.
A total of 1,385 shovel tests were excavated to
locate new prehistoric and historic sites, and another
96 shovel tests were excavated to explore new sites once
they were discovered. On average, 6 shovel tests were
excavated at each newly recorded site (n 15). Also,
77 shovel tests were excavated al the sites that were
reevaluated. Dimensions for both on-site and off-site
shovel tests were 30 x 30 cm with an average depth of

The objectives of the survey of the nine timber
harvest areas within Lhe Red River Anny Depot and the
Lone Star Army Ammunition Plant were to identify
both historic and prehistoric cultural resources and
provide initial assessments of these resources in terms
of !heir eligibility for listing in the National Register of
Historic Places. These objectives were met by 100
percent pedestrian coverage of each area and archival
research. Two additional tasks were completed during
the survey. First, 26 previously recorded sites within'
the nine survey areas were visited to obtain information
on their current condition and to reevaluate their
National Register eligibility. Secondly, an attempt was
made to re-locate and mark 52 previously recorded sites
outside of the nine survey areas. This was done to ensure
that they will be protected from disturbance during
upcoming timber-harvesting activities.
S URVEY METHODS
Full coverage of each of the nine survey areas was
achieved by walking transects across each area and
excavating shovel tests on landforms likely to contain
arcbeological sites. Transect spacing and the number
of shovel tests excavated per area depended partly on
the area size and the presence or absence of landforms
shown by previous surveys to be relati vely common
locations for prehistoric sites (recognizing that prehistoric sites are not al all common across large parts of
the installations). Such landforms include terrace edges
and upland edges close to either perennial or intermittent
streams; the use of these characteristics to determine
where to focus survey efforts follows the recommendations presented in a cullural resource management plan
developed for the installations (Peter el al. 1991 :IV17). These recommendations were derived from early
survey work al RRAD/LSAAP (Peter and Cliff 1990a)
and were used in subsequent surveys (Cliff, Hunt cl al.
1996:38; Cliff and Peter 1994:38).
High probability areas for historic sites are not as
read ily linked to landform characteristics, although it
has been suggested that early sites (predating 1860-

f
A prehistoric site was defined by the recovery o
one or more artifacts from two or more n~arby shovel
tests, by more than two artifacts from a smgle shovel
test, or by one artifact from a single shovel test al?ng
with either surface or subsurface evidence of possible
features (e.g., burned rocks). A historic site was defined
by surface or subsurface artifacts and/or features that
could be related to an old house site. Locations of
cultural materials that did not fit these site criteria were
designated as localities. Localities were nu~b~red
sequentially by survey area, and a short descnptJon,
sometimes accompanied by photographs or a sketch
map, was made by crew leaders.
Newly discovered sites were recorded on
temporary site forms and given temporary numbers
keyed to the areas in which they were discovered.
The temporary forms were then transferred to the
State of Texas computerized site file (TexSite), at
which time trinomials were assigned. A compassand-pace map showing shovel test locations, surface
features, a site datum, and site dimensions was drawn
for each new site. The site datum was a site-central
tree that was blazed with red paint circles and the
temporary site number. In addition, site perimeters
and features were flagged. This marking was done
to facilitate re-location by the installation foresters
for avoidance purposes. As specified in the scopeof-work, all previously recorded sites within the
survey areas were revisited (irrespective of previous
re~~~~endations concernini National Register
ehg1b1hty). The present condition of the sites was
noted, and shovel tests were excavated if the sites
had ~ot been so tested previously and if it appeared
that tnlact deposits might be present. Original site
maps were adjusted to reflect the present conditions

discovered feat~res. Site datums were reflagged and

two years were targete db y this project. These consisted
of26 prehistoric sitesâ¢. 22 ~istoric sites, and 4 sites With
both prehistoric and htstonc components. The majority
of the sites (n = 34, 65 percent) are located on RRAD
while 18 (35 percei:it) are located on LSAAP. This task
was added after the project began to compensate for a
reduction in the number of acres to be covered in the
timber sal~ survey areas. This reduction resulted from
three factors: ( l) some of the estimates of survey area
size in the scope of work were too high; (2) pan of
Survey Area 5 adjacent to the RRAD demolition area
could not be covered due to safety concerns; and (3)
part of Survey Area I at RRAD could not be covered
because it is in a clear-cut area that is too overgrown to
be transected.
Sites were verified using information from TARL
site files, published site reports, and the RRAD/LSAAP
contour maps (1 inch= 400 ft). Published information
on most of the targeted sites appears in four reports
produced by Geo-Marine, Inc. (Cliff, Hunt et al. 1996;
Cliff and Peter 1994; Peter and Cliff 1990a, 1990b).
The reported locations of the sites were confmned by
shovel testing if the site datum could not be found.
Shovel testing procedures followed those reported
above. However, only enough shovel tests were dug to
confirm the site location. Once the site location was
confirmed, the site datum was reflagged or reestablished
and the site perimeter based on the results of the original
survey was marked. Site datums were reestablished by
circling a tree with red paint and painting the last three
digits of the trinomial on that tree. The location of~e

the foresters. It was hoped that the blazes would belll~rek

recorded in a catnlog by provenience. Site and survey
area photographs were processed by labeling all

and a descrip tion of the slide; 35-mm negatives were
also labeled with site and catalog numbers and then
placed in an envelope contain ing a typed description
a nd co ntac t pr int. Th ese proce du res are i n
accorda nce with th ose req uired by the Te xas
A rcheo logical Researc h L ab or a tor y at The
Uni versity of Texas at Austin, where the materials
are curated. T he mate ri als recovere d in clud e
prehistoric lithic tools and debitage, un modified
rocks, charcoal, prehistoric ceramics, and historic
artifacts of glass, metal, and ceramics. The methods
used to analyze these materials are presen ted below.
Lithic materials recovered from prehistoric sites
include chipped stone artifacts, other worked stone
artifacts, and unmodified rocks. The u nmodi fied
rocks were identified by ma terial type, counted, and
weighed, while the chipped stones and other worked
stone artifacts were described furt her by both metric
and nonmetric attr ibutes. The purpose of this analysis
was to provide an accu rate descri ption of these
materials for use as evidence toward determining site
type and/or age.
The attri butes used to describe other wo rked
s tone artifacts include length, width, thickness, and
weight. Also the presence and location of evidence
o f working, such as po lis hing, faceting, and
striations, were noted. For the few chipped stone
tools recovered, metric measures were expanded to
include overall length, blade length, base length,
width, neck width, and thickness. Addi tionally,
nonmet ric att ributes such as blade, base, and
shoulder form, along with the raw m aterial, were
noted.
The debitage sample, though the largest chipped
stone category, is comparatively small per individual
site. Thus, both edge-modified flakes and unmodified
fl akes are included in each debitage description and
the num ber of flake edges exhibiting modification
is noted. Debitage attri butes consist o f fla ke
completeness, maximum dime nsion, dorsal cortex
percentage, chunk cortex presence/absence, number
of platform facets, platfo rm gri ndi ng presence/

ARCHIVAL RESEARCH MET HODS
Thirty-six sites n l RRAD nnd LSA AP were
arehiv:1lly rcscan:hcd for this project. First, u legal
nhstract wns completed for the property on which
each s it e was located . T hen gencn log ic nl,
socioecono m ic, :rn d o th er i nfo rm nt ion wns
researched ubout the individuals nnd families who
mny have been associated with each site based on
the legal nbstrncts.
Progress on the fi rst step was hampered initially
by the foci that mos t pre-1890 legal recor.ds for
Bowie County had been destroyed in a fire. The
historian sought 10 circumvent this problem by using
General Land Office records in Austin and abstract
books at the Stewart Title of Texarkana Company.
This company, whose activities predated the fire,
holds volumes that made it possible to assemble data
about owners of property within the project areas
and the passing of that property through deeds,
inheritance, and the resolution of court cases. Many
sites are located on small tracts tha t, before 1890,
had been parts of much larger tracts. Still, the abstract
records, together with old records refi led after the
nineteenth-century fire, made p oss ibl e the
reconstruction of an accurate or at least plausible
chain-of-title for each historic site.
Completion of an abstract for each site was
fo llowed by attempts to obta in a death date fo r each
individual involved in ownership of the property.
Acquisition of death dates then was fo llowed by a
search of local newspapers for information abou t
owners and their family histories. These data were
supplemented by intensive use of census and ad
valorem tax reco rds. As owner-occupancy was
verified, it became possible to identify the portions
of the Bowie County censuses that reco rded
occupancy of the area being surveyed, allowi ng for
a community-wide picture of owners and renters
between 1870 and 1920 rather than jus t a siteÂ·
specific record. Census and ad valorem tax records
also allowed for the verification or fine-tuning of
the previously assembled chains of ti tle based on
abstract records. All conclusions were gauged against
artifact and site descri ptions as well as archeologydri ve n estimates of site age and chro nology.

absence, and platfom1 cortex presence/absence. Flake
type was recorded using the categories complete,
proximal, chip. and chunk. Chips lack a. platf~rm and
chunks are angular shatter. Maximum d1mens1on was
recorded in 0.5-cm increments using a concentric-ring
scale. Dorsal cortex was recorded for all debitage except
chunks in four percentage increments (0, 1-50, 51-99,
and JOO percent). while chunk cortex was recorded as
present or absent. Platform cortex on complete and proximal flakes was considered separate from dorsal cortex
and was recorded as present or absent. Platform grinding
was recorded as present when the edge formed by the
intersection of the flake dorsal surface and the platform
was visually confirmed as rounded under low magnification. The count of strikjng platform facets also was
done under low-power magnification. Facets that could
be attributed to platform crushing during flake removal
were not counted. Lastly, raw material type was noted
for all debitage and color was noted for chert specimens.
The purpose of the analysis of prehistoric ceramics
was to provide a physical description of the small
collection. Descriptive attributes used include vessel
part, decoration, temper type and paste nonplastic
inclusions, sherd color, surface finish , sherd size,
thlckness, and hardness. Sherds classified by vessel part
consist of rims and body sherds. Bases are not
represented in the sample. Rims were further described
by their orientation and lip form. Decoration consists
of a simple description of technique such as fingernail
or stick punctations and incising or engraving with
allention to elements such as fields or rows of
punctations and number and orientation of lines. Due
to the small size of the decorated sherds, motif could
not be addressed.
Temper is defined for this analysis as intentional
addition of materials to the clay while nonplastic
inclusions may be natural clay constituents.
Identification of both was accomplished under lOx
magnification on a fresh break. Temper types identified
are grog, .gr~g/bone, shell/voids, and no visible temper.
Non~lastJcs mclude fine sand and iron concretions. Fine
sand IS defined here as Y:r? mm on the Wentworth scale.

Like the. prern.stori~ art~fact analysis, the purpose
of the analysis ofrustonc artifacts was to provide some
indication of period of occupation and site type.
Consequently, artifacts were first sorted by provenieoc.e
and material type (ceramic, glass, metal, etc). Then they
were sorted by functional classifications (such as
window glass, container glass, tin can, etc.). AU artifacts
were identified to the greatest degree possible basedoo
diagnostic attributes, particularly marks or temporally
sensitive shapes, characteristics, or method of
manufacture. All items were counted within the same
provenience and functional category. When possible, a
date or date range was assigned_
The sites within the RRAD/LSAAP survey areas
tend to be moderate or small, with limited assemblages
of materials (sometimes nondiagnost.ic) mostly dating
to the late nineteenth century or twentieth century.

RESULTS OF INVESTIGATIONS AT THE
RED RIVER ARMY DEPOT

4
The survey of seven limber sale areas located within
the Red River Anny Depot resul ted in the identification
or two previously unrecorded historic sites (4 1BW609
and 4 IB W620) and three prehistoric sites (41 BW62I,
4 1BW622, and 41BW623). Also, two previously
recorded sites (41BW2I7 and41BW293) were reevaluated and 16 localities were idenli lied. This chapter
contains a description of each survey area with a listing
of the new or reevaluated sites and localities. Following
the descriptions of the survey areas are detailed descriptions of the new sites and the reevaluated previously
recorded sites. In addition to the survey work, 34 sites
outside of the survey areas were re-located. Re-location
was undertaken to mark sites so that they can be avoided
during timber harvesting activities. A list of the sites
looked for and the current condition of those found is
presented along with an explanation of the re-location
process. The chapter concludes with descriptions of the
isolated artifacts or features that were design:ited as
localities.

The seven survey areas located across RRAD vary
in size and environmental characteristics. This section
provides information on the topography, soils, and
vegetation of each area and notes disturbances. All of
these characteristics affect the preservation and potential
occurrence of archeological sites. A projection of a
survey area's potential to contain prehistoric archcological sites was made based on these char:icteristics,
and this projection was used to determine transect
spacing and shovel-testing intensity.

its size, it was divided into Subareas IA, IB, IC, and
ID (Figure 3). These subareas range from 28 to 53
hectares (69 to 130 acres) in size. Subareas IA, IB,
and IC were considered to have a low potential for
landforms likely to contain prehistoric sites, while
Subarea 1D was judged to have a higher potential (Table
I). Seventy-four shovel tests were excavated in Survey
Area I, and three localities (IB-1 , IC- I, and ID- I) were
recorded. No archeological sites were identified.
Survey Area I is in an upland setting that slopes
gently to the southeast with elevations ranging from 370
to 330 ft arnsl. Vegetation consists of planted pines with
some clear-cut areas in the western section and mixed
hardwoods in the eastern arm and stem of the "T." The
vegetation in two clear-cut areas in Subarea IA and IB
(totaling 36 hectares, or 89 acres) is so dense that these
t:racts could not be transected by pedestrian survey; an
additional 5 hectares, or 13 acres, in Subarea IC could
not be covered due to standing water. Three unnamed
tributaries ofBig Creek flow southward through the area.
The soils associated with the stream valleys consist of
Annona loam and Sardis silt loam, which are poorly
drained and frequently flooded (Fox 1980). Surrounding
upland soils are Annona loam, Asula loam, and Sawyer
silt loam, which range from poorly drained to
moderately well drained (Fox 1980).
Disturbances to Survey Area I are ma inly
associated with the clear-cutting and replanting of trees.
Other impacts may have occurred from facility activities
that adjoin the area. For instance, a World War ll training
facility now used as a storage area abuts the northern
edge of the eastern arm of the ''T," and a was te deposal
area abuts the northern edge of the western arm.

2E (Figure 4). These subareas range in size from 30 to
57 hectares (75 lo 141 acres), with most having a low
potential for landforms likely to contain prehistoric sites
(see Table 1). A total of 138 shovel tests was excavated.
These tests helped to identify five localities (2A-1, 2A2, 2C- l, 20 -2, and 20-3) and one historic site
(41BW609).
Survey Area 2 is an upland area with an elevation
range of390 to 350 ft amsl; pimple mounds are common.
Vegetation consists mainly of mixed hardwoods,
although a patch of planted pines with a dense understory
occurs in the northeast corner of the area. This dense
undcrstory consists of immature pines, blackberries, and
greenbriers. Ground surface visibility is generally poor
because of the thick leaf litter in the hardwood forest or
the dense undergrowth associated with the pines. No

major tributaries cross the area. Rather, the area is
situated at the headwaters of Rock Creek and Can~Y
Creek, which fl ow south to the Sulphur River. Thcsm~
associated with the area consist of moderately we

Survey Arca 8 is composed of several ridges that
arc dissected by Elliott Creek and some of its tributaries. The elevations of these ridges range from 350 to
300 ft ams!. Vegetation consists of mixed hardwoods
and pines with a moderate understory. Soils are a patchwork of loams, sandy loams, and gravelly sandy loams.
The ridgetops west of the creek are composed of
Woodtell gravelly sandy loam, while a band of Sardis
silt loam comprises the slopes west of the main creek
channel (Fox 1980). Pimple mounds are common in this
area. As one moves away from the creek, other soils
occur such as Annona loam, McKamie loam, and Eylau
very fine sandy loam. This survey area is now maintained for timber harvesting and hunting. Past disturbances appear to be associated with timber harvesting
and probable gravel borrowing. These activities have

until April 17, 1902. On that date, they conveyed the
south 157.5 acres encompassing 41BW609 and presentday Tracts Nos. 534, 535, and 536 to their daughter,
Susan A. Sealy, and the north J57.5 acres encompassing

1942, Sealy lost the property to the U.S. government
through a declaration of taking (Deed Record 192: 135137).

RECORDED SITES
41BW609

Site Setti11g
Site 41BW609 is a historic site located near the
northwest comer of Survey Area 2, Subarea 2C (see
Figure 4). The site is positioned at 390 to 380 ft amsl
on soils of Annona loam (Fox 1980). Mixed hardwoods
comprise the dense canopy, with a moderately open
understory of young oaks, elms, backberries, blackberries, and greenbriers. Ornamental plants were not
noted. Surface visibility is poor due to the thick leaf
litter.
Site History

Site Description
The most prominent feature at 4 lBW609 is a brick
cistern. The cistern is bell-shaped and its lip extends
ca. 90 cm above the ground surface. The outer surface
and lip are coated with cement inscribed with the name
"B. 0. John ... "and the dale "Oct. 30, 1939."
Unfortunately, deed records do not show a B. 0. John
or B. 0. Johnson as having been a property owner at
the site or in the vicinity, and no one by either name was
listed in Bowie County in 1920. Associated with the
cistern is a low mound of gray clay. This mound extends
southeast from the cistern for 7 m and may represent
the backdirt from cistern construction (Figure 8). A
scatter of loose bricks, probably construction debris,
was found al the far end of this mound.
Other features consist of two concentrations of
historic artifacts and an abandoned two-track road. The
concentrations of surface artifacts are 20 and 50 m
northeast of the cistern. The concentration farthest from
the cistern consists of an enamel coffeepot and pail, a
5-gallon bucket, a large crockery rim fragment, and
several KC Baking Powder cans. The concentration near
the cistern includes a shovel blade, an enamel bowl,
and several paint cans. The old two-track road is 40 m
west of the cistern. Though hard to discern today, this
track is visible on the soils map aerial photograph, as is
a smaU clearing that may be the site location (Fox 1980).
Seven shovel tests were placed between the cistern
and the road, near the surface artifact concentrations,
and southeast of the cistern. However, all shovel tests
were sterile. Soils in the shovel tests consisted of30 cm
of yellowish brown sandy loam over reddish brown
clayey sand. A site area of 6,400 m2 was calculated based
on the distribution of the features.
Ground disturbance characterized by a series of ruts
and mounds was observed between the cistern and the

Site 41BW609 appears to be located on Tract No.
534 in the northern portion of the Collin M. Akin Survey
(Figure 7). According to Akin's testimony before the
Board of Land Commissioners for Red River County,
he had immigrated to Texas in November 1827. The
Board later acknowledged that Akin was entitled to
receive a league and a labor. On January 30, 1839, the
1,968 acres on which 4 lBW609 eventually was located
were surveyed. Five years later, the survey was patented
to Akin (Texas. General Land Office 1844).
Akin was a small-scale slave owner who held a total
of 2,700 acres in the 1840s. Ad valorem tax records
and a title abstract indicate that he acquired other tracts
after 1844 and kept the survey containing Tract No. 534
intact until May 1846, at which point be sold 640 acres
to L. M. Rice and J. D. Mason for $320.00. Rice then
quitclaimed bis interest Lo Mason on March 21, 1859,
and Mason sold the 640 acres to B. T. Estes two years
later.
Estes, a district judge and founder of the Texarkana
National Bank (Chandler and Howe 1939:280; Harper
1996a:898), sold an interest in the property to I. ?:JÂ·
Ball, with whom he apparently speculated in Bowie
County rural properties. The two men held the land in
the Akin Survey until February ll, 1889, when they
sold approximately 315 .5 acres to Abraham Reed
(1842-1906) for $295.75 (Deed Record 3:343 1; Irby

road. This ground disturbance may have occurred
during the removal of site structures after the land
was acquired by the U.S. government, or it may have
resulted from more recent t imber harvest in g
activities.

Artifact Ruo1Â·ery
No art ifac ts were recovered from shovel tests,
and none of the artifacts in the surface concentrations
were collected, as they are not particularly diagnostic.

Summary
The presence of a cistern and trash scallers at
41 BW609 indicates that the site was the location of
a residence. Deed records show that the first definite
occupation of the property containing the site was
by Abe Reed and his wife in 1889. Tbe last owner of
the land was Addie F. Sealy, who acquired it in 1936
and held it until 1941. There is no record of B. 0.
John o r B. 0. Johnson as a property owner. The
presence of the inscribed name on the cistern with
the date of 1939 may suggest that the site was occupied by a tenant at this late date. Archeologically,
aside from the cistern and the two surface artifact
scallers, the lack of other features and intact
subsurface deposits suggests that the research
potential of the site is limited. It is recommended
that it be considered ineligible for National Register
listing (see Chapter 6).
41BW620

Sile Setting
Site 4 IBW620, the Till Cemetery, is located at
the northeast end of Survey Area 5 in Subarea SC
(see Figure 5). The cemetery is situated on a pimple
mound at 310 fl amsl overlooking a tributary of
Caney Creek. The cemetery is located in a cleari ng
within a mixed hardwood and pine fores1. The
clearing is grass covered, though it also contains a
stand of small oaks and two juniper trees. Soils at
the site are mapped as Sawyer silt loam (Fox 1980).

Ad valorem rax records indicate that Jonarha
Till occupied his 150 acres during the early 1860:
and thal the property was assessed to G. W. 1ill later
in that decade and to Mrs. Elizabeth Till in the 1870s.
According to an affidavit filed as the res uh of a trespass to rry tir le suit in I 924 (Disrrict Court Case
15776), the Till heirs sold the 150 acres to Henry
Mahone in about 1882. Mahone. whose wife was an
heir of Collin Akin, also acquired a 160-acre tract
south of the 150-acre tract, and this is where he and
his fami ly made their home (Deed Record I 19:3 13).
Henry Mahone, born in Texas in 1858 (Irby
1957- 1958:137), or August 1859 to parents who
were natives of Alabama, was married to Martha
Kelly Mahone, born in Texas in October 1862 10
parenls from Kentucky. The Maho nes married in
about J880 and had nine children: Abe (born January
1881 ), Mary (born March 1883), John (born
September I 885), Janie (born November 1888),
Josic (born March 1890), Spencer (born February
1894), M innie (born November 1896), Ellis M. (born
ca. 1901), and Bessie N. (born ca. 1906).
Henry and Martha Mahone held the 1wo large
tracts of land- the 160 acres on which they made
their home and the 150 acres to the north on which
rhe Till Cemetery was located-from ca. 1882 until
1925. At that time, they sold the 150-acrc Till
Cemcrery tract and 51.46 acres adjoining to the south
to their son, E[llis) M. Mahone (Deed Record
119:313). Ellis Mahone and his wife, Bennie Faye,
owned !he 150-acre tract and 5 1.46 acres south of
the tract and north of the Old Boston and Texarkana
Road until April 27, 1942. On that date, they sold
both parcels to the U.S. government for $8,260.00
(Deed Record 192: 108).

I
I

Site 4 1BW620 is the burial
location for members of at least three
generations of the Till fam ily. The
individual first identified with the
property on which the cemetery is
located is Jonathan Till. Till's wife
was Elizabeth Till, who was born in
Kentucky in about 1835 and
probably is the Mary E. Till buried
in the Till Cemetery. Their chjldreo
were Rjchard (born ca. 1854 in Texas
and probably father of the John N.
Till buried in the Till Cemetery),
Emma (born ca. 1857 in Texas).
Almeda I.[?] (born ca. 1858 in
Texas), and John M. (born ca. 1862
in Texas and probably the third
individuaJ buried in the cemetery).
It is possible that the fourth burial,
identified by an unmarked fieldstone,
is that of John Till , husband of
Elizabeth. Currently, Till Cemetery
is being managed by RRAD as a
result of an instaJlation management
decision. IL is considered ineligible
for National Register listing (see

7/BW

Site 41BW621 is a prehistoric
lithic scatter located on a series of
pimple mounds on the terrace edge
overlooking the east bank of Elliott Creek in Survey
Area 8, Subarea 8A (see Figure 6). The elevation of the
site area is 310 fl ams!, with the mounds standing an
additional 0.5 to 1.0 m above the surrounding surface.
Soils within the site area are mapped as Sardis sill loam
(Fox 1980). This soil was observed as 63-84 cm of
yellowish brown silly loam over a yellow sandy clay.
However, al least one shovel test was taken to a depth
of 125 cm without encountering this sandy clay.
Vegetation consists of a moderately dense canopy of
mixed hardwoods and pines with a fai rly open
unders1ory of young trees, greenbriers, grasses, and
forbs. Surface visibility is poor due to thick leaf Liller.

Disturbances appear to be few, with bioturbation

may be the presence of a historic ceramic sherd

sherd which could date anywhere from the midnineteenth century lo the mid-twentieth century. Since
no other historic artifacts or features were found at the
site or in the vicinity, this single shcrd is considered to
be an isola1ed find and nol representative of a historic
component. 11is possible that this historic artifact arrived
at the site through overbank flooding of Elliott Creek
and then worked its way downward through
bioturbation. Bioturba1ion also may have affected the
vertical distribution of prehistoric artifacts.

Site S etting

Site 4 1BW622 is a prehistoric lithic scatter located
on a dissected terrace adjacent to the north bank of
Elliott Creek in Survey Area 8, Subarea 8A (see Figure
6). The elevation of 4IBW622 is 310 ft ams!. Soils
within the site area are mapped as Sardis silt loam (Fox
1980); this soil was observed as 60-120 cm of yellowish
brown silty loam over mottled orange and yellow clay
loam. Vegetation consists of a thick canopy of mixed
hardwoods and pines with a moderately open understory
of young trees, greenbriers, grasses, and forbs (Figure

Artifact Recovery

Site 4 1BW622 was .discovered by shovel tests
placed along survey transects. Fifteen tests were dug 10
depths of 60-120 cm (Figure 12). Seven shovel tests
(54, 69, 70, 76, 77, 107, and 109) produced cultural
materials. Artifacts were recovered in these tests al
0-100 cm below the surface (two items from 0-20cm
in Shovel Tests 77 and l 07; nine items from20-40cm
in Shovel Tests 54, 69, 70, and 76; four items from

The prehistoric artifacts recovered include six
pieces of debitage and a core fragment. The core
fragment is quartzite and displays two bidirectional flake
scars. The diameter of this core is 3.5 cm. The debitage
consists of four complete flakes, one proximal flake
fragment, and one chip. These specimens range from
1:5 t.o 4.0 cm in maximum dimension and are evenly
~1stnbuted between the raw material types chert, quartzite, and chalcedony. The chert colors represented in this
small sample are grayish brown and red. Four flakes
have 1-49 percent dorsal cortex, while one has 50-99
percent cortex and one has I00 percent cortex. Dorsal
Oake scar counts reflect lhc cortex amounts with multiple
scars (2-6) on five flakes. Four flakes retain striking
platforms, and two of these have cortex present. Three
of the platforms have single facets and none arc ground.

Artifact Recovery

Anifacts recovered from the shovel tests include 1
hammerstone, 1 uniface, I pebble core fragment, 19
pieces of debitage, and 3 pieces of fire-cracked rock.
The hammerstone is a small quartzite pebble
(43.9 x 36.3 x 21.4 mm) with extensive battering around
the central margins (Figure l 3a). This type of battering
may suggest that the stone was also used as an anvil.
The uniface was fashioned from a large flake of
chalcedony; it measures 57.7 x 38.6 x 17.3 mm (Figure
I 3b). The functional category of this uniface is
indeterminate, although some polish is present on the
dorsal surface of both the proximal and distal ends. The
core fragment was part of a quartzite pebble; it has six
bidirectional nake scars and is 5.0 cm in dfameter. The
three pieces offire-cracked rock have a combined weight
of76.9 g.
The debitage consists of 13 complete nakes 2
proximal fragments, 3 chips, and I chunk. All ~re
between 1.0 and 3.0 cm in maximum dimension. Though
no nakes are 100 percent corticate, half have some
cortex and there is cortex on the single chunk in lh
sam~le. Still, thre~ or more dorsal nake scars occur o~
10 pieces of debnage. Pifteen nakes retain Slrik'1
platf~rms, none of which have cortex; only 4 are groun";

The presence of a lithic pebble core
and hammerstone suggest that
primary reduction of local gravels
took place at the site. This may be
reflected in the debitage sample by
the fact that 55 percent of the flakes
display some cortex. In addition, the
presence of flakes with multiple
striki ng platforms suggests that laie
stage reduction, possibly linked to
tool refurbishing, occurred.
Summary

Site 41BW622 is a moderate-density prehistoric
lithic scatter. However, unlike 41BW62 l, this site has a
greater horizontal extent and produced a wider range
of artifacts including a pebble core, a hammerstone, a
unifacial tool, and fire-cracked rocks. This diversity of
artifacts and larger site extent may suggest a greater
intensity ofuse. Unfortunately, no temporally diagnostic
artifacts were recovered. Because the site appears to
have sufficient remains to contribute important
information on topics such as settlement strategics,
it is recommended that it be considered potentially
eligible for listing in the National Register (see Chapter
6).

Site History

the:

Site 41BW2I7 is located in the northwestern
ponion ofTr:ict No. 593, a parcel totaling ca. 227 acres
in the H. R. Runnels, Collin M. Akin, and John A. Recd
Surveys (see Figure 7). The portion of the l:rncl on which
41BW2I7 is located is comprised of en. 25 acres in the
Runnels Survey.
General Land Office records indiC.'.lte that the State
of Texas passed a joint resolution on March 20, 1848,
to allow for the relief of E. B. Cogswell (also spelled
Crosswell) by providing for a survey of 640 acres. On
April 18, 1848, Cogswell, then a resident of Harris
County. sold his land claim 10 Hardin R. Runnels for
$200.00. Runnels had the land surveyed in Bowie
County on October 12, 1853, and he received a patent
on February II, 1854 (Texas. General Land Office
1854).
Runnels held the land intact until November 1861,
when he sold the south 320 acres to W. 1. Murphy for
$800.00. Within 15 years, Murphy had sold the land to
W. A. Payne, who then sold it to W. D. Busick.
Subsequent owners were J. M. Murphy and Murphy's
wife, Martha.
On April 3, 1878, J. M. and Martha Murphy sold
the south half of the 640-acre Runnel s Survey to Mrs.
Lou Ball, wife of doctor, land investor, and Old Boston
resident I. M. Ball (Chandler and Howe I 939:293;
Jennings and Varner 1976:25). After little more than a
year, the Balls sold the 320 acres in two parcels, the
200 acres on which 41BW2I7 is loC.'.lted going to 1. F.
Courtney on December 31, 1879. According to n note
in the Declaration of Taking, the parcel on which
41BW217 is located was "apparently" in the nonhcasl
comer of a 200-acre tract conveyed by I. M. Ball to
J.M. (sic] . Abstract records show the grantee to have
been J. F. Courtney and the date to have been 1879.
However, no such conveyance was recorded in 1854.
By 1881, Ilic 200 acres were valued at $800.00, and
Counney owned I mule or horse, 20 cattle, and 20 hogs.
J. F. Court.ney died in 1899 (Irby 1958-1959: 119),
and by I 9 I 7 the land had become pan of the estate of
Ben Counney and, later, his widow, E. D. Their heirs,
1. C. Courtney et al. then separated out the 25 acres on
which 4 IB W2 17 is located and sold them on January 22,
1917, to C. E. Briggs (Deed Record 109:2). Briggs. in
turn, conveyed the land to Abe M. Mahone for $300.00
in cash and notes on April 20, 1917 (Deed Record
I08:325). Mahone. most of whose land was located to
the cast in the Collin M. Akin Survey, kept lhe property
until ca. 1942. when he sold it to the Uni ted States govcmmcnt (Deed Record 188:595-600).
Artifact analysis by Peter and Cliff (1990a:l67,

Current Condition
The plotting for 41BW2I7 on the Corps of
Engineers contour map shows the site on the northwest
side of the road/perimeter fence o(the Special Weapons
Workshop Area. As such, tl1e site would be inside Survey
Arca 7. Yet, Peternnd Cliff ( I 990a: 170) show the site
to be on the southeast side of the fence outside the area.
Six shovel tests were placed along lhe northwest side
of the fence in an nltcmpt lo determfoe whether the site
actually extends into Survey Arca 7 (Figure 15); no work
was done southeast of the fence in the area reported as
the site location by Peter and Cliff (1990a:170). This
shovel testing recovered one lithic flake from Shovel
Test 11 at 0-20 cm, but no historic materials were
encountered. The recovery of the flake indicates that
the prehistoric component of 4 1BW217 docs extend
across the fence, while also confirming the ephemeral
nature of that component. Based on this ndditionnl
shovel testing information, site size can be amended to
50 m north-south by SO m cast-we.st, or 3, I00 m2â¢ The
site's original National Register assessment as ineligible
remains unchanged (see Chapter 6).
41BW293

Location and Previous Investigations
Site 41 BW293 is located outside the south-cenual
edge of Survey Arca 6 (sec Figure 5). The site was
originally recorded as the location of a farmstead, which
appeared on the 1906 USGS map. Surface indications
consisted of a scatter of historic refuse, several waterÂ·
filled depressions, and pan of a disturbed brick cistern
(Peter nnd Cliff 1990a:246-247). Five shovel tests
produced only one wire nail. Site disturbance and low
artifact density were the rationale for considering the
site ineligible for the National Regist.er.

Sile History
Site 41BW293 is located on Tract No. 589, 3
105.15-acre parcel of land in the Collin M. Akin Survey
(see Figure 7). The history of the propeny on which the
site is located is the same as that for 4 1BW609 until the
mid 1840s, when Akin began to sell some of his !:ind.
He apparently rclAincd ownership of n ponion of.the
grant, however, for by the 1890s, his heirs had inhented

the assets of his estate, which included land in the Akin
Survey.
Between 1897 and 1898, six of those heirs deeded
their interest in the real estate assets of the Collin M.
Akin Sr. estate to a seventh, R. J. Akin (Deed Record
20:222- 223; Deed Record 27:317-319). R. J. Akin then
began to sell parcels out of the Akin Survey, conveying
the 130 acres (present-day Tracts Nos. 589 and 590) on
which 41 BW293 is located to F. M. Anderson for $65.00
on June 2, 1902 (Deed Record 32:552). Anderson held
the property for 16 months before selling it to J. D.
Ellidge for $300.00 (Deed Record 37: 12). The Ellidges,
in turn, sold the land to W. A. Bradshaw on May 2,
1904, and he held the property until November 16, 1917.
At that point, Bradshaw sold the ca. l 05 acres comprising Tract No. 589 (on which 41 BW293 is located) to
41

W. H. Webster for $500.00 (Deed
Record 78:605). The Websters were
the last private owners before Tract
No. 589 was acquired by the U.S.
govern me nt on March 26, 1942
(Deed Record 190:241 ).
Deed records and Peter and
Cliff's ( l 990a:246) estimate of a
turn-of-the-century occupation date
suggest that 4JBW293 may have
been the location of improvements
constructed by F. M . and S. P.
Anderson, who purchased the
property for $65.00 in June 1902 and
sold it for $300.00 in October 1903.
Subsequent owners who may have
occupied lhe site include J. D. and
Molly Ellidge (1903-1904), W. A.
and Lizzie Bradshaw (1904-1917),
and W. H. and Jennie Webster
(1917-1942).

Current Condition

The 1996- 1997 survey crew
noted a previously un reported,
intact, bell-shaped brick cistern near
a facility road approximately 150 m
northeast oflhe reported location of
41BW293. Because of their proximity, the decision was made to include
the additional cistern and associated
artifacts with 41 BW293. This
addition increases the site size to
60 m norlh-south by 200 m eastwest, or 9,400 m2.
Seven shovel tests we r e
placed near the cistern; only one, placed on a low
mound 8 m west of the cistern, produced historic
artifacts (Figure 16). Artifacts recovered at 0-60 cm
include one milk glass bowl rim, one window glass
fragment, two wire nails, and two pieces of ferrous
metal. These artifacts fit with a twentieth-century
occupation, perhaps as late as the 1930s, and may
re late lo an occupation by W. H. and Jennie Webster,
the last landowners.
Inspection of the low mound and the soils within
the positive shovel test detenni ned that lhe mound is
likely a bulldozer push pile. Thus, it appears that no
other shovel tests around lhe cistern produced artifacts
because the area has been scraped and the soil pushed
into this pile. Because of this apparent disturbance and
the late occupation date, the original assessment of

RE-LOCATED SITES OUTSIDE
THE SURVEY AREAS
An anempt was made to verify the location of 34
previously recorded sites outside the survey areas. These
sites were originally thought to have good research
potential and were recommended for funher work so

arscn:il bound:i.ry. Since these areas arc likely to be timbered in the next two yenrs, the perimeter of each site
found was blnzcd and the survey dntum was rcflagged
or reestablished.
Table 2 lists the sites targeted for re-location along
with infom1ation on the components present, original
report references. and the current condition of the sites.
Twenty-three of the sites have only prehistoric
components, 8 have only historic components, and 3
have both historic and prehistoric components. Three
of the prehistoric sites-41BW2I6, 4 IBW26S, and
4 lB\V308-were not found. Site4 I BW216, which was
reported as being cleared of trees by the original survey,
is now within an area of impenetrable second-growth
ground cover. Sites 41 BW26S and 41 BW308 were
originally reported as sites with low artifact densities.
Though the re-location crews believed they were in the
right area based on the site descriptions, site datums
were not found, nor did shovel testing verify the
locations. Site datums were found on less than half(44

percent) of the sites investigated. Generally, it was easier
to find datums at historic sites because they were usually
placed next to an obvious feature such as a cistern.
Eleven of the IS sites (73 percent) at which datums were
not re-located are prehistoric sites recorded before 1990.
Of the sites that were fou nd (n = 31),2 1 (68 percent)
are considered intact , 8 (26 percent) arc slightly
disturbed, I (3 percent) is disturbed, and site disturbance
could not be determined at I due to thick ground cover.
Slight disturbance is defined as instances were only
superficial dis turbance of the upper sediments has
occurred from erosion or timber-harvesting activities.
Slight disturbance should not greatly affect future
assessments. At 4 IBW45 I , noted as disturbed, the
effects of extensive bulldozing are evident. This historic
site with a cistern was found with bulldozer push piles
affecting at least 40 percent of its area. These bulldozer
piles were not noted when the site was recorded
originally (Cliff and Peter 1994:86-88). Because of this
disturbance. it appears that 41 BW45 l is no longer

on the surface consist of 50- and 30-gallon oil drums,
5-gallon paint cans. and a few glass jars with screw-on

Locality 2AÂ· I is a historic trash scatter located at
350 ft amsI nt 1he southeast comer of Subarca 2A just
cast of a stream that forms the upper reaches of Rock
Creek. The scatter covers a 20-x-30-m area. Six shovel
tests were placed in the scatter, and lhree more were
placed on surrounding pimple mounds. Only one shovel
1est in the scatter produced historic materials, at 0-20 cm
below 1hc surface. Except for a modern septic tank
associa1ed with RRAD facilities in the area, no features
or domes tic vegetation were observed.
Artifacts observed in the surface scatter include
bricks, galvanized buckets, cans, sheet metal, water
glasses, snuff bottles and other assorted bottles, canning
jars, crockery, whiteware, and barbed wire. Several items
were collected from the surface: one brick fragment;
five whiteware sherds, some of which are repousse
molded and gilded with a fl oral design or decorated
with n polychrome floral decal; one whole clear glass
machine-made bottle with one recessed panel and a
threaded finish; two brown snuff bottles which were
machine made in a four-part mold; one milk glass
canning jar lid; and one fragment of a large aqua glass
linament bottle with a recessed panel embossed with
" ... URST-McNESS Co./FREEPORT, ILL." The
linament bottle likely contained "Pain Oil" made by
Furst-McNess Co. The bottle was manufactured by the
Illinois Glass Co. of Alton, Illinois, between 1916 and
1929 (Fike 1987:60).
Artifacts from the positive shovel test include seven
whiteware rim sherds with polychrome floral decal
decorations, six undecorated whiteware body sherds,
one clear glass molded tableware sherd, nine tin can
fragments, and one black rubber fragment ofunknowo
fu nction. Artifacts from both the surface and the shovel
test suggest that the scatter dates to the late nineteenth
or early twentieth century, ca. 1890 to 1930. The UTM
coordinates are N370 I060/E375 125.

Locality lC-1
Locafoy I C-1 is located in the nort h-central part
of Survey Area I on 1he floodplain of an intermittent
tributary of Big Creek. II consists of a dump of cans
which range in size from soup cans to coffee cans. The
soup cans are double-seam type, postÂ· 1900 (Rock
I981: 17). Though the concentration is partially buried
beneath heavy leaf liner, it appears 10 cover an area of
5 x 5 m. This can dump may have resulted from activities
associated with an old World War II training facility
that abuts the northern boundary of Subarea IC. That
facility is no longer operational; many of the buildings
are gone, and it is presently used as a storage area. The
UTM coordinates for this locality are N3702080/
E372500.
Locality lD-1
Locality I D-1 is located in the south-central part
of Subarea ID. The locality consists of a group of
straight-sided circular holes in an open oak woodland.
These holes are 5-6 m in diameter and 0.5-J .0 m in
depth. Some of the holes have small central islands.
These holes occur in groups of two to three with some
overlapping. Inspection of the locality did not yield any
evidence of what caused lhe holes. For instance, there
are no indica1ions of heavy machinery operation in the
area, such as churning of 1he forest floor, and there arc
no backdirt piles. A few :ll1ifacts observed on the surface
in the area included two recent soda bot1lcs, a piece of
sheet metal, and a me1al banding strap. Also, an 8-oz.

Locality 2A-2
Locality 2A-2 was designated because n single chert
fragment with conchoidal fracture scars was recovered
from a depth of 65 cm in a shovel test on a low pimple
mound. One other shovel test was placed in the vicinity,
hut no other cultural materials were recovered. 'The

in the extreme southeastern corner of Subnrca 2A. Tiic
UTM coordinates arc N3700940/E375 I 80.
Locality 2C-1
Locality 2C- 1 is located on a small pimple mound
in a mixed hardwood forest along the western boundary
of Subarca 2C. Shovel Test 4 on the pimple mound
produced one lithic flake at Q-IOcm below the surface.
Another shovel test was placed on the mound after the
discovery and two more were placed on surrounding
pimple mounds, but no additional materials were
recovered. The average depth of the shovel tests was
60 cm. The UTM coordinates for this locality are
N3701700/E375320.
Locality 20-2
Locality 20-2 is on a low pimple mound located in
the central part of Subarea 20 . This mound produced a
single corticate flake from Shovel Test 29 al 0-20 cm;
the shovel test was excavated lo a depth of 60 cm without
encountering additional materials. Two other shovel
tests in the general area also failed to produce cultural
materials. The UTM coordinates for this locality are
N3701160/E375720.

of n facility road in a dense pine forest in the center of
Survey Arca 6. Two of the piers nrc square :md one is
circular in shape. None of the 1hree nppcars to be in

piers without result. It is possible that 1hcsc piers were
dumped in their present location as no other indication
of structures or related features is present. The UTM
coordinates arc N3699045/E375820.
Locality 7A-1

A brick fragment and a wire nail were recovered
from Q-20 cm in Shovel Test 12, located in the southcenlral part of Subarea 7 A. The brick fragment is of
the soft mud sand-struck type, which can date from
the late nineteenth to mid twentieth centuries (Gurcke
1987: 105). Two additional shovel tests were
excavated in the vicinity, but nei ther produced
additional artifacts. The UTM coordinates are
N3697945/E374 I 85.
Locality SA-3
This locality was designated because two quanzite
nakes were recovered from Shovel Test 82: one at 2040 cm and one at 40--60 cm. The locality is on top of a
small interfluve that projects eastward into the floodplain
of Elliott Creek. Four additional shovel tests were placed
in the vicinity without result. The UTM coordinates are
N3696545/E38 1120.

Locality 20-3 was identifi ed in the southwest
corner of Subarea 20 at the intersection of a northsouth facility road and a transmission line. The
locality consists of what appear to be two man-made
mounds positioned on either side of the transmission
line. The mound south of the transmission line is
roughly circular and approximately 6 m high and 20
m in diameter. The mound to the north is linear in
shape and approximately twice the diameter of the
southern mound. Two shovel tests were placed on
the southern mound. Both showed that the mound is
composed of gray, yellow, and red silly clay. At the
base of the shovel tests, 73-80 cm below the surface,
dark reddish brown silly clay with ironstone concretions was encountered. No cultural materials were
recovered from these tests or noted on the surface.
It is likely that these mounds resulted from the
cons truction of RRAO facilities. The UTM
coordinates arc N370 I OOO/E375280.

Locality SA-4
Locality 8A-4 consists of one chert flake recovered
from 4{}-60 cm below the surface in Shovel Test 86.
This shovel test was located on top of a small interfluve
that overlooks the western bank of E lliott Creek. Four
additional shovel tests excavated in the vicinity failed
to produce prehistoric artifacts. The locality is 125 m
south of Locality 8A-3. However, shovel tests dug
between the localities failed to provide a connection
between the two internuves. The UTM coordinates are
N3696440/E38 t 060.
Locality 88 -1
This locality consists of a chert flake and a quartzi te
nake from 20-40 cm in Shovel Test 1. This locality is
positioned at the south end of Subnrca 8B on a low rise
overlooking Elliott Creek Reservoir. Four additional
shovel tests we re excavated on the rise, but artifacts
were not encountered. The UTM coordinates for the
locality are N3696085/E382240.

ca. 50 food cans, I brick. and 6 clear glass bottles. Three
of the bonles appear to be ketchup bottles, and one is a
Dr. Pepper soda bottle. One shovel test near the scauer
was sterile. The scatter is located along the southeastern
boundary of the subarea near a gully that nows into
Elliott Creek Reservoir. The UTM coordinates for the
scatter are N3696360/E382320.

Locality 10

Locality 10 is not associa1ed with a particular survey
area; it was found during the re-location of previously
recorded sites outside the 1997 survey areas. It is
approximately 250 m e.ast of prehistoric site 41 BW562,
which was re-located by this survey. This locality was
designated because the distal portion of an unidentifiable
dan point was recovered from a shovel test at G-10 cm
below the ground surface. The shovel test was on the

RESULTS OF INVESTIGATIONS AT THE LONE STAR
ARMY AMMUNITION PLANT

5
The survey of two timber sale areas at the Lone
Star Army Amm uni tion Plant resulted in the
identification of eight previously unrecorded historic
sites (4 1BW610, 41BW61 l, 41BW612, 41BW613,
41BW614, 41BW616, 41BW617, and 41BW618) and
three prehistoric sites (4 1BW615, 41BW6 19, and
41BW624). In addition, 24 previously recorded sites
were reevaluated, and 16 localities were identified. This
chapter contains a description of each survey area with
a listing of the new or reevaluated sites and localities.
Following the descriptions of the survey areas are
detailed descriptions of the new sites and the reevaluated
previously recorded sites. In addition, 18 sites outside
the two survey areas were re-located so that they could
be marked for avoidance during timber harvesting. A
discussion of the process of site re-location is presented
along with a Ust of the sites looked for and the current
condition of those found. The chapter concludes with a
description of the localities, which are composed of
isolated artifacts or features.

SURVEY AREA DESCRIPTIONS
The two survey areas located al LSAAP vary
greatly in size and to some extent environmental
characteristics. This section provides information on the
topography, soils, and vegetation of each area, with
distur-bances to each area also noted. All of these
characteristics affect the preservation and potential
occurrence of archeo-logical sites. A projection of a
sur vey area's potential to contain prehistoric
archeological sites was made based on these
characteristics, and Lhis projection was used to detennine
transect spacing and shovel-testing intensity.

Fourth Street, a main facility road.1Wo subareas ofsimilar size (3A and 3B) were defined above and below a
storage facility located in the middle ofthc area (Figure
18). Subarea 3B was considered to have a higher
potential for landforms likely to contain prehistoric sites
than Subarea 3A (Table 3). Though 57 shovel tests were
excavated, only one prehistoric locality (3B-1) was
identified.
Survey Area 3 is part of the uplands with little relief,
and elevations range only from 380 to 375 ft amsl.
However, pimple mounds are present throughout the
area. Vegetation consists mainly of mixed hardwoods
with patches of planted pines. Generally, the understory Â·
is open, but dense tangles of blackberries, green briers,
hackberries, and trumpet vines occur along streams. The
area is drained by two intermittent streams that form
partofthe headwaters of Jones Creek and Panther Creek.
Both screams flow north to the Red River. The soils
associated with the area consist of moderately well
drained Sawyer silt loam (Fox 1980).
Disturbances to Survey Area 3 are mainly
associated with railroad and road construction, as these
features crosscut and bound the area. Also, the intermittent streams have been channelized, a process that
has stripped away the upper soils along the stream edges.

Survey Area 4
Survey Area 4 was the largest survey area at 1,002
hectares (2,477 acres). The area abuts the plant boundary
fence on the north, a transmission line on the south, and
Central Avenue on the west (see Figure 1). The north
half surrounds seven manufacturing facilities, while a
munitions storage area and demolition field occur in
the south half. The large size of the area necessitated
the definition of 20 subareas designated A through T
(Figure 19). The size of these subareas varied from 12
to 164 hectares (30 to 405 acres). The subareas were
defi ned by differences in their probability of having
landforms likely to contain prehisto ric sites. Seven
subareas were designated as having a high probability
and the remainder had a low probability (see Table 3).

Survey Area 3
Survey Area 3, which consists of7 l hectares (176
acres), is located in the northwest comer of the Lone
Star Anny Ammunition Plant (see Figure I ). The
n~nhern edge is the plant boundary fence at U.S.
Highway 82, while the southern boundary is formed by

Shovel tests excavated in the area totaled 959. New sites
recorded include prehistoric sites 4JBW615, 41BW619,
and 41BW624, as well as historic sites 4JBW610,
4JBW611, 4JBW612, 41BW613, 41BW614,
4JBW616, 41BW617, and 41BW618. In addition, all
of the sites that were revisited by the survey were located
in Survey Area 4. These revisited sites (n = 24) include
41BWI77, 4IBW332, 41BW333, 41BW334, 41BW335,

4H-2, 4H-3, 4H-4, 4H-5, 41-1, 41-3, 4J-l, 4J-3, 4M-2,
and 40-1.
Most of the revisited sites in Survey Area 4 are
historic sites recorded in 1989 by Geo-Marine based
on the map research done by Heartfield and Dieste in
1984 (Peter and Cliff I990b). This previous work was
targeted at identifying historic sites containing wells or
cisterns that might have been used for the disposal of
hazardous materials during the earlier years of the
operation of LSAAP. As such, the 1989 project did ~ot
entail systematic survey, and it did not involve recording

of many prehistoric sites. IL was for these reasons that
the area was included in the scope-of-work for this
project.
The uplands that form Survey Alea 4 are dissected
by numerous streams that form the headwaters of Aiken
Creek. Elliott Creek, and Jones Creek. Aiken and Elliott
Creeks flow south to the Sulphur River while Jones
Creek flows north to the Red River. Thus, the divide
between the two drainage systems occurs in !lie northern
part of the area. Maximum elevations vary from 380 ft
in the north to 364 ft amsl in the south. Vegetation
consists mainly of planted pines with patches of mixed
hardwoods. The understory in these woodlands is
moderate to extremely dense. Tangles of blackberries,
greenbriers, and immature pine trees often made
surveying difficult. Major soil types consist of Annona
loam, Sawyer silt loam, and McKamie loam extending
from north to south (Fox 1980). Pimple mound fields
are common within these soil types. Moving 10 the
southeast corner of the survey area, the land becomes a
patchwork of sandier soils. These soils include Rosalie
loamy fine sand, Woodtell gravelly sandy loam, Eylau
very fine sandy loam, and Ruston fine sandy loam (Fox
1980). The Woodtell gravelly sandy loam may have been
a source of lithic raw materials for prehistoric people

.=

living in the area and was often mined for its gravels in
modem times (Fox 1980:34).
Disturbances 10 Survey Area 4 are obviously associated with plant facility construction and maintenance,
though management of the woodlands for timber has
also had an impact in the form of the construction of
firebreaks, skidder paths, and debranching areas.
Streams near facilities have often been channelized,
likely altering their topography. Most devastating to
many previously recorded historic sites was the
hazardous waste management procedure of bulldozing
the immediate area surrounding possibly contaminated
cisterns.

Mnson on June 20, 1853.
Rice, who with Mason purchased a number of
holdings in the present-day vicinity of the Red River
and Lone Star facilities (see also 41BW609), quitclaimed his interest in the Smithers Survey on January
23, 1854, to Washington West, who immigrated to Texas
from Shannonville, Tennessee with his wife, Mary B.
(Willaucr) West and sons, George Washington, Ike, and
Sol, who became legendary Texas cattlemen (House
1996:888). Mason retained his interest until
December 14, 1871, when he sold it to B. T. Estes.
Estes then conveyed a half interest in the 640-acre
Smithers Survey to his partner I. M. Ball on January 22,
1873.
A legal abstract of the Smithers Survey suggests
that Smithers's heirs believed that they held title to the
property long after Jonath.an Smithers had conveyed his
grant to Rice and Mason: on May 19, 1888, W. J.
Smithers leased the land to J. M. McGill. In addition,
Washington West's widow, Mary B. West, and his heirs
were parties to a lawsuit involving W. J. Smithers et al.
in 1891 (Deed Record 10:5).
Eventually, the West family deeded all their interest
in the Smithers Survey to D. T. Leary, a local Bowie
County businessman, who platted the Leary townsite
on the property and then conveyed the survey to his
wife, Ellie N. Leary, in 1895 (Deed Record 38:201202). Ellie N. Leary died on October 25, 1921, and the
portion of the Smithers Survey not previously sold was
acquired through inheritance by Annie Patterson on
September 2, 1941 (Deed Record 188: 133). The owner
of the 108.30 acres in the western portion of the Smithers
Survey on December 17, 1941 , when the U.S. government acquired it through a declaration of taking, was
Byron Barkman of Texarkana, Texas (Deed Record
181 :322-334).

Site Description
Figure 20. View of the eastern portion of 41BW6I0 showing
the large oak tree marking the eastern edge of !he site in the
ceniral background.

Site 41BW610 is defined by a circular depression
2 m in diameter and domestic vegetation consisting of
tJ1e stand of yuccas. The depression may be the remains
of a filled cistern. This type of feature associated with
domestic vegetation and large oak trees has been
observed at other historic sites al LSAAP. Five shovel
tests were placed at the site, but none produced cultural
materials. Surface artifacts were not encountered. Site
size based on the position of the feature and domestic
vegetation is 900 m2 (Figure 22). Disturbance to the
site may have resulted from clearing for the northern
perimeter fence at LSAAP. This clearing abuts the north
end of the site approximately 4 m north of the stand of
yuccas.

Site History
Site41BW610 is located on Tract No. 8, a 108.3acre parcel of land in the western portion of!he John H.
Smithers Abstract 533 (Figure 21 ). Smithers was granted
a certificate on December 19, 1839, by the Board of
Land Commissioners for Red River County, and 640
acres were surveyed on April 23, 1840. Twelve years
later, Smithers patented the land (Texas. General Land
Office 1852). which he sold 10 L. M. Rice and J. D.

Arca 4 within the central part of
Subarca 4A. T he s ite is situated at
the north edge of an upland ridge at
350 ft amsl overlooking the valley
of an unnamed tributt'lry of Jones
Creek (see Figure 19). The area
supports a canopy of pines, oaks, and

Site 41 BW6 I I was first identified by a few bricks
on the surface between a dense stand of crepe myrtles
10 the north and yuccas to the south (Figure 23). The ca.
six brick fragments, one of which is impressed with
"... XA ... " as in "TEXAS," occur in two concenlrations ca. IO m apart. Six shovel tests were excavated
near and around the brick scatter. Only Shovel Test 33,
located 20 m southeast of the brick scatter, produced
artifacts, at 0-20 cm below the surface. The domestic

Disturbance to the site appears to be extensive.
Bulldozer push piles are present at the east edge of the
site along a two-lrack road that is now used by hunters.
It also appears that debris has been pushed downslope
along the west edge of the site, and apparent skid trails
cross the site. Both timber-harvesting activities and the
removal of structures after the U.S. government's
acquisition of the land in 1941 are likely causes of this

41BW612

Site Setting
Site 4IBW6 12 is a historic house site located at
!lie southeastern e nd of Subarea 4G between a manufacturing facili ty and Lincoln Avenue, a main road at
the plant (see Figure 19). Site elevation is 360 ft ams)
on the top of an upland ridge that projects southeast
toward a tributary of Aiken Creek. Vegetation consists
of a relati vely open pine and hardwood forest with a
moderate understory of small pines, green briers, grasses,
and Forbs. A line of large oaks marks an old fence line,
and a bed of irises occurs between the old fence line
and Lincoln Avenue. Soils at the site are Sawyer silt
loam and were observed as 25-50+ cm of grayish brown
silt loam over reddish brown clay witll gravels. Several
pimple mounds, a feature common to areas associated
with Sawyer silt loam, occur at tile edges of the site.

Artifacts Recovered
Site History
The materials recovered from Shovel Test 33
consist of one aqua container glass sberd embossed with
the letter " .. . S" and one clear glass container sherd.
Both are unidentifiable, but it is possible that the aqua
glass sherd is from a canning jar. A date and manufacturer cannot be confidently assigned to the marked
brick fragment recovered from the surface scatter.
However, the "A" in the " . .. XA . .. " is slightly smaller
and underlined. Generally, this small collection of items
is reminiscent of early-twentieth-century materials. Â·

Summary
Site 41BW6 l I is likely an early-twentieth-century
site that is marked by a brick scatter a nd domestic
vegetation. For the duration of its history, the tract on
which the site is located was a highly valued parcel of
land that was owned by a series of speculators and nonresident landowners and used by them for intensive
farmi ng. A map prepared by the U.S. government fieldman depicts several impro vements on the tract and
numerous old fields. Since none of the owners is known

54

Site 41BW612 is located in Tract No. 83, a 24.7acre parcel of land in the eastern portion of the Mary
Burnsides Survey (see Figure 21 ). The legal history of
the tract on which 41BW612 is located is the same as
that for 4IBW390 until 1894, when Sarah A. (Mrs.
William E.) Massenberg received approximately 1,000
acres of the Burnsides Survey.
On March 20, 1905, Sarah Massenberg sold 85
acres to G. W. Bayless who, in tum, executed a deed
for the east 24.7 acres of the 85-acre tract to W. H. Bell,
who had paid part of the total purchase price. Four years
later, Bell received clear Lille to the tract (Deed Record
62:441), which he kept until April 22, 1912, when he
sold it to Seth Logan for $300.00 (Deed Record 61 :253).
After 19 12, tl1e property turned over rapidly, being sold
to 0. V. Hibbs in January 1913 (Deed Record 65:498),
and to William J. Cleveland, whose family owned
property in the Burnsides S urvey to the south and
southwest, in June 1913.
Sometime between 1913 and 19 16, tile 24.7-acre
tract passed to Cleveland's son, G. C. Cleveland, who

Artifact R ecovery

Site Setting
The artifacts recovered cons ist of two ceramic
sherds and o ne metal fe nce staple. One sherd is an
undecorated soft-paste porcelai n body sherd, probably
from a flat vessel such as a plate. The other is an undecorated stoneware body sherd with Bristol glaze on the
interior and exterior. 'This second sherd is likely from a
large utilitarian hollow vessel. None of these artifacts
are tightly diagnostic materials. However, the ceramics
suggest an early-twentieth-centu ry date for the site.

Site 41BW613 was the location of 1he Mo unt
Vernon Baptist church. 'This site is at the northwest
comer of the intersection of Old Boston Road and a
north-south plant road near the center of Survey Area
4, Subarea 4H (see Figure 19). It is situated at 360 ft
amsl on an upland edge overlooking an intermittent
stream that forms part of lhe headwaters of Aiken Creek.
Soils at the site are associaled with Sawyer silt loam
and were observed as 30 cm of light brown s ilty loam
over brown silly clay loam. Pimple mounds are common
across the site. Oaks, hickories, elms, and pines comprise
the tree canop y, while oaks, elms, sumacs, a nd
greenbriers form a modera1ely dense understory. A few
scattered iris plants and large oak trees are also present.

Summary
Artifacts observed, along with deed and census
records, suggest lhat 41BW612 may have been
improved and occupied by W. H. Bel 1between ca. 1905
and 19 12. Subsequently, it may have been occupied or
used by Seth Logan, 0 . V. Hibbs, Alex E. and Elizabeth
Presley (whose grandchildren were living with them in
1920 and who were the legal owners of the 24.7-acre
tract), or Ernest Mcf aul. The possible filled cistern and
a patch of irises may indicate the house location. This

Summary
A church may not leave :in extensive :ircheological
signature if the structure was removed, as is likely the
case when the U.S. government acquired the land. Given
that extensive gTOund disturbance has also occurred, it
is not surprising that little in the way of features or
artifacts was found at 41BW613. It is also questionable
as to whether the artifacts that were found reflect church
activities or are related to LSAAP operations. The site
is at a crossroads where casual trash disposal could
easily account for such items. The most telli ng remains
that a historic structure was located at this site are the
scattered irises and the large old oak trees. However,
the extent of disturbance a.nd the limited artifact recovery
suggest that the site has limited research potential. It is
recommended that it be considered ineligible for
National Register listing (see Chapter 6).
41BW614
Site Setting

Site 4JBW614 is located in the eastern part of
Survey Area 4, Subarea 41(see Figure 19). The site sits
on the southeastern slope of an upland ridge at
365 ft amsl. This upland ridge is the divide between two
tributaries of Aiken Creek. Soils at the site are mapped
as Annona Loam (Fox 1980). A light gray sandy loam
to a yellowish brown sandy loam were encountered to a
depth of 60+ cm. These soils became saturated at 30 cm
below the surface. Vegetation consists of a canopy of
mixed hardwoods and pines with a moderately dense
understory of young deciduous trees and pines. A heavy
leaf litter causes surface visibility to be poor.

this orientation, the fla nge on one rim of the pipe
becomes the lip of the cistern. The pipe extends ca. I m
above the ground surface. On one side of the pipe a
visible maker's mark reads "W. S. Dickey Texarkana."
Polk's Texarkana City Directory includes listings for
W. S. Dickey Clay Manufacturing Company after 1924
and throughout the 1930s and 1940s.
The water-filled depression is 2.5 m north of the
pipe cistern (Figure 28). The depression is 3 m in
diameter. Four pieces of cut lumber project out of the
southwest edge of the depression. At lenst one of these
pieces has a cross piece nltached with wi re nails. The
configuration of this lumber suggests that a structure
many have surrounded the depression at one time. It is
possible that the depression is nn old cistern that was
replaced by the cermnic pipe.

Site History
For a history of the property on which 41BW614 is
located, see the site history for41BW366. Sit.e 41BW614
probably is associated with the activities of the families
who occupied 41BW366 between 1923 and 1941.

Site Descriptio11
Site 41 BW614 is marked by rwo surface features,
a cistern and a water-filled depression. Though six
shovel tests were excavated in the vicinity of these
features, no artifacts were encountered. Site size, based
on the extent of the features, is projected to be I 00 m2â¢

additional shovel tests, ranging in depth from 50 to

discovered; these negative tests suggest that the site is
confined to the single mound. At present, disturbances
to the site appear to be minimal. However, its position
adjacent to the cutbank of the stream suggests that the
threat of erosion is immediate.

a house location. It is possible that these cisterns were
used for watering livestock and may be associated with
the dwelling at 4 IBW366, which is located on the same
land tract south of 4JBW61 4 along Old Boston Road.
Because of the li mited remains and uncertain
associations, the research potential of 41BW6J4 is
limited. It is recommended that it be considered
ineligible for National Register listing (see Chapter 6).

Twelve pieces of debitage, two pieces of heat
shatter, and a tested quanzite cobble were recovered
from Shovel Tests 67 and 68. The heat shatter is
composed of potlid fragments that have a combined
weight of< 1.0 g. The tested cobble has been angularly
fractured by heat, but two flake scars are evident The
weight of the cobble is 256.5 g.
The debitage is composed of seven quartzite flakes
and live fine-grained chen flakes. One chert fl ake and
one quartzite flake appear to have been utilized. Chert
colors include yellow (n = I), grayish brown (n 1),
and red (n =3). Flake types represented in this sample
consist ofseven complete flakes, one proximal fragment,
two chips, and two chunks. The specimens range in size
from 0.5 to 7.0 cm, but the majority (n =11) are 3.0cm
or less in maximum dimension. Only three flakes display
50 percent or more dorsal cortex, while bolh chunks
have cortex. The relative lack of dorsal cortex is
mirrored by the fact that six fl akes have two or more
dors::il scars. Platform preparation does not appear
common, as only two flakes have multiple platform
fnce ts nnd three hnve evidence of grinding. Also,
platfonn cortex is present on three specimens.

one of the Payton's grandsons, Nero Payton (born
May 10, 1911 ; died April 25, 1945; son of Cupid
Payton) was buried in the cemetery, there is no visible
marker. Indeed, the size of the Payton and related
families suggests that there may be numerous unmarked
graves at the Piney Grove Cemetery.

Summary

Â°

The limited spatial extent :md the small number.of
anifacts recovered from 41OW6I5 suggest that tl~c site
saw shon-tcrm occupation(s) and may have funcuoned
as a special-purpose camp. TI1e litl1ic artifact sai;nple,
though too small from which to draw confident
conclusions, does show that local quartzite gravels were
utilized :ind that tool manufacturing likely occurred al
the site and was probably accompanied by some tool
refurbishment. Though no features were encountered,
the presence of fire-altered stone (i.e., potlidded litl1ic
debris) may be an indication that campfires were
constructed. Based on its low density of artifacts and
small size, 41BW615 appears to be too ephemeral to
yield important data. Hence, it is recommended that it
be considered ineligible for National Register listing
(see Chapter 6).

Site Setting

Site 4IBW616 is the Piney Grove Cemetery. The
cemetery is located in the central part of Survey Area 4,
on the south edge of Subarea 41 (see Figure 19). It is
positioned at 380 ft ams) on the east lobe ofa nonhwardprojecting upland ridge that overlooks the upper reaches
of a tributary of Aiken Creek. Soils are mapped as
McKamie loam (Fox 1980). The vegetation in the area
surrounding the site consists of a mixed hardwood and
pine forest. but the cemetery itself has been cleared of
vegetation, with only a few hardwood trees left standing.
At the time the site was recorded, the leaf litter was
extremely thick and may have obscured some surface
features .

Site Description

The Piney Grove Cemetery bas been marked and
fenced by the faci lities managers at LSAAP. The sile
fence marks a square that covers 3,600 m2â¢ However,
the interments noted appear to be clustered in the
northwest comer of the fenced area. In this comer, there
appear to be two groups of burial markers and one grave

Site H i3tory

The history of 4IBW616, which comprises all
of Tract No. 171 in the Mary Burnsides Survey (see
Figure 21), is the same as that of 4 IBW379 until 1913,
when Payton Payton died, leaving property in the
Burnsides and Memphis, El Paso, and Pacific Railroad
Company Surveys, Section 27. Shortly thereafter, his
heirs began to sell portions of the property, and on July
26, 1924, they conveyed 31 acres out of the nonhwest
portion of a l 03.5-acre tract in the Payton Payton estate
to ~ane Coulter [also spelled Colter]. The conveyance,
which was made by Payton's widow, Matilda, and her
seven children and their spouses, reserved a !-acre tract

41BW617
Site Setting

Site 41BW617, marked as the
Langford Cemetery, is located in the
east-central part of Survey Area 4, at
tlle northeast corner of Subarea 41 (see Figure I9). The
site silS on a knoll al 360 ft ams!. A mixed hardwood

December 2, 1826, married Lenetta Langford and bad
a son, C. E., and immigrated to Bowie County, Texas,
by way of St. Clair County, Alabama, and Tippah
County, Mississippi. Langford died of unknown causes
on January 1, 1873, and was buried at41BW617. Fora

on the Langford headstone also faces cast. Disturbances
to the site are minimal. However, Lhe large pine tree
immediately adjacent to the g rave is likely a source of
bioturbation.

Sile Description
Site 4 1BW6l8 consists of the re mains of a structure
and associated features that cover an area of 2,500 m2.
The structure is marked by two brick concentrations
that appear to be a p air of hearth founda tions and
chimney falls. These brick concentrations are ca. I 0 m
apart on an east-west line (Figure 33). Bricks at the base
of these concentrations are in situ and form square
foundations. Many of the loose bricks a rc discolored
on one side, suggesting the differential exposure to heat
that would be expected of bricks in a hearth/chimney.
Several large sandstone rocks were also observed in the
area between the brick concentrations, and two stacks
of sandstone rocks (three rocks high) were found on
either side of the westernmost brick concentration. The
positions of the rock s tacks and sing le rocks suggest
th at they may have been used as pier stones. Scattered
across the area with the brick concentrations and rocks
are numerous pieces of corrugated metal which are likely
the remains of roofing material. The configuration of
the brick concentrations and the possible pier s tones
suggests that the structure may have been a two-pen
dogtrot house with a hearth for each pen.
Centered between and immediately south of th.e two
brick concentrations is a brick cistern. The cistern would
have been 2 .5 to 3 m south of the structure. It is bell
shaped and projects 1 m above the ground surface
(Figure 34). Another feature observed is a rectangular
depression measuring 3.0 x 1.5 m. The depression is
15 m southeast of the c istern. Scattered at and 10 m to
the west of the depression are a number of artifacts,
including two metal washtubs, four brown glass jars,
two Mason jars, a can, and a few brick fragments. Shovel
Test 14 was placed near the center of this scatter, and
cultural m aterials were recovered from 0-10 cm below
the surface. Approximately 45 m northwest of the cistern
is a smal I scatter of corrugated me tal in an area o f thick
vines. This small metal scatter may mark the location
of an outbuilding. However, Shovel Test 11 placed near
this scatter did not produce c ul tural materials. In all,
seven shovel tests were excavated at the site; Shovel
Test 14 was th e o nly one t hat prod uced c ultural
materials.
Disturbances to the site appear to be minimal. So
much structural debris remains that the building(s) were
likely not subject to the same remo val process that
occurred at other historic sites after the U.S. government
acquired LSAAP.

Summary
Site 4 JBW6 l 7, the Langford Cemetery, contains
one intennent dating to the late 1800s. The site is in
good condition as it is m arked, fenced, and maintained
by LSAAP. It does not appear to be eligible for National
Register listing (sec Chapter 6).

41BW618
Site Setting
Site 4IBW6 18 is the remains of a historic house
site located in the south-central part of Survey Area 4,
in Subarea 4L (see Figure 19). The site is 120 m south
of the boundary fence for the ammunition storage
facility. It s its at 360 ft amsl on the south slope of a
broad upland ridge that forms the divide between
intermittent s treams forming the headwaters of Elliott
Creek. Soils on the ridge consist o f Sawyer silt loam
(Fox 1980) and were observed as 40 cm of dark brown
to brown s ilty loam over reddish brown silty clay loam.
Vegetation in the area is composed of a mixed hardwood
forest with an open to moderate ly dense understory of
young trees a nd deciduous shrubs and vines. Grasses
and leaf litte r obscure the ground surface.

Site History
The legal history of4 1BW61 8, which is located in
the southeast comer of the David Jarrett Survey on Tract
No. 102(see Figure 2 1), is the same as that of 41BW338
between 1843 and 19 13. At that time, lot 4 of the
subdivision of the David Jarrett Survey was allotted to
Emma Jarrett. Emma [Emmarelta H.] held the tract after
she married William Hilsy Lynch on March 6, 1918,
until December 194 1, when the U .S . government took
it (Deed Record 183:527-533; M arri age Record
I 0:53 1). A governme nt inventory made on October 5,
1941, certified that three buildings were located o n the
tract: one 20-x-50-ft hewn log and box house with a
20-x-24-ft e ll; one 16-x-20-ft boxed barn; and o ne
8-x-16-ft boxed garage. The buildings and census
records suggest that this s ite probably was the location of
a house occupied by an unidentified member o f the Jarrett
family prior to 19 18, and that it may have been occupied
by W. H . and Emma Jarrett Lynch after that date.

reflecling a late-nineteenth- and early-twentieth-century
occu pation by Euro-American lando wners. It is
recommended that this site be considered potentially
eligi ble for National Register listing (see Chapter 6).
41BW619

Site Setting
Site 41BW6 I9 is a prehistoric lithic scatter located
in the south end of Survey Arca 4 , in Subarea 4S (see
Figore 19). IL is positioned al 310 ft ams! on a small
terrace proj ecti on located on the wes t s ide of a
southward-flowing unnamed tributary of Elliott Creek.
A marshy area of the creek's floodplain is situated 150 m
north of the site, and a power line maintenance road
clips the southern end. Vegetation is composed of a
mixed hardwood and pine forest with an open understory
of assorted shrubs and forbs. Soils are associated with
Woodtcll gravelly sandy loam and were observed as
6~0 cm of yellowish brown gravelly sandy loam over
reddish brown sandy clay.

Sile Description
Site 41BW619 was discovered through shovel
testing. Teo shovel tests were excavated on the terrace
projection to depths of 60-80 cm, and Shovel Tests 32,
33, 34, 36, 39, and 4 1 produced cultural materials
(Figure 35). These materials were restricted to the upper
40 cm within the shovel tests, with four teslS producing
six items from 0-20 cm and five tests producing nine
items from 20-40 cm. The distribution of the positive
shovel tests suggeslS a site area covering l ,000 m1.

Figure 34. Northwest view of the cistern at 418W618.

I0 cm of Shovel Test 14. These include one piece of
window glass, six container glass sherds, and one
undecorated white ware body sherd. The container glass
sherds consist of two clear bottle fragments with
recessed panels, one clear container sherd with a molded
machine-manufactured seam, two aqua glass sherds, and
one brown glass snuff botlle fragment. The whiteware
body sherd most likely came from the bottom of a plate.
None of these artifaclS is particul arly diagnostic, but
they suggest that the site may date anywhere from the
late nineteenth cenLUry to the 1920s.

Artifact Recovery
Eleven pieces of debitage and four heat spalls were
recovered. The heat spalls are small potlid fragments
that together weigh <1.0 g. 111e debitage consists of
three complete flakes, three proximal fragments, three
chips, and two chunks. The material types represented
are six fine-grained chert and five quartzite pieces, with
chert colors including three yellowish brown pieces and
one each of grayish brown, black, and red. The
maximum dimension of the debi rage ranges from 0.5 to
3.0 cm, with lhe majoriry (n = 7) between 1.0 and 2.0 cm.
Dorsal cortex percentage is low, with only two flakes
displaying 100 percenl cortex; dorsnl scnr counts are
high, with five flakes having two or more scars. Platform

Summary
Site 41BW618 is likely the remains of the Jarrell
house site and may have been occupied from as early as
the 1880s until it was acquired by the U.S. government
in 1941. Three sLrUctures were reported at the time ii
was acquired. Features still present at the site, such as
the cistern and two hearth s/chimney falls, mark I.h e
position of the main house, which was a hewn log and
box structure. Surface and subsurface artifacts are

S11mmary
Site 4 IBW6 l 9 is a moderate-density prehistoric
litltle scaner that probably represents a short-tenn camp
associated with the utilization of local upland gravels.
The debitage recovered, though a small sample, suggests
that late stage reduction or tool refurbishing may have
occurred at the site due to the low dorsal cortex percentages, flakes with numerous dorsal scars, and the
presence offlakes with multiple striking platforms. No
temporally diagnostic artifacts were recovered, however,
preventing an assessment of the age of the site. Because
the site appears to have sufficient artifacts to contribute
to an understanding of the use of local gravels, it is
recommended that it be considered potentially eligible
for National Register listing (see Chapter 6).
41BW624
Site Setting
Site 4 1BW624 located in Survey Area 4 at the
southeast comer of Subarea 4C (see Figure 19). The
southeast corner of Subarea 4C is defined by the
intersection of Taylor Avenue and Sixth Street. The site
.is on the upland edge overlooking a gully that forms
part of the headwaters of the East Fork of Elli on Creek.
Elevation at the site is 375 fl ams!. Soils are associated
with Sawyer silt loam (Fox 1980). These soils were
described by the survey crew as 36-80 cm of yellow
sandy loam over yellowish brown sandy clay. Vegetation
consists of a moderately dense canopy of mixed hardwoods and pines with a moderate understory of young
trees and vines. Surface visibility is poor due to heavy
leaf Ii tier.

Avenue. Seven shovel tests placed across the road to
defi ne the extent of 41BW341, a previously recorded
historic site, indicate that 41 BW624 does not extend
beyond Taylor Avenue. However, the construction of
this road likely disturbed the edge of the site.

Artifact Recovery
Recovery from shovel tests at 4IBW624 consists
of a nutting stone, a quartzite hammerstone, a chert
hammers tone, five pieces ( 4 17 .5 g) of fire-cracked
quartzite rock, an unmodified ironstone slab (846.0g),
and an unmodified quartzite cobble (884.0 g). The
nutting stone is a tabular piece of iron-rich sandstone
that has large central pits on two opposite sides (Figure
37). It measures 98.2 x 66.5 x 49.4 mm and the pits are
25.5 and 27.8 mm in diameter. The quartzite hammerstone displays banering at both ends and along one side.
Its measurements are 63.9 x 37.3 x 29.1 mm. The chert
hammerstone is also battered at both ends; the battering
consists of multiple step fractures with a few flake removals (Figure 38). It measures 120.0 x 69.0 x 57.9 mm.

Summary
Sile 41BW624 appears to be a small specialpurpose prehistoric camp. The only artifacts it produced
are tools that most likely relate to plant processing. This
type of special-purpose site is not typical of the small
prehistoric camps identified at LSAAP or RRAD by
this survey. Unfortunately, no temporally diagnostic
artifacts were recovered. Site 4 IBW624 may be
important if it can provide information on a littledocumented site type that characterizes how the uplands
were used by native peoples. It is recommended that it
be considered po1entially eligible for National Register
listing (see Chapter 6).

Site Descriptio11

DESCRIPTIONS OF PREVI OUSLY
RECORDED SITES

Six shovel tests were excavated at 4 IBW624 to
depths of 40-80 cm. Shovel Tests 42 and 44 produced
cultural materials, including a nutting stone, a harnmerstone, a battered cobble, and five pieces of fire-cracked
rock. All of these cultural materials came from a depth
of20-40 cm. Interestingly, no debitage was recovered.
However, two large unmodified rocks came from Shovel
Test 42 at 0-40 cm. Rocks or pebbles were not present
in any of the other shovel tests, which suggests that these
two rocks may be manuports.
Site size was calculated at 1,800 m2 based on the
extent of positive shovel tests (Figure 36). This site
dimension places the east edge of the site at Taylor

A part of the task of surveying timber sale areas
involved updati ng information on previously recorded
sites within the survey area boundaries. Such an update
could include information on site condition, additional
shovel testing, and/or feature identification. Tuenty-four
sites were updated and arc reevaluated here. The main
component of all of these siles is historic, though one
sile is reported to also have an ephemeral prehistoric
component. All of lhe si1es are located in or adjacent to

n?rthwestem portion o f the Nancy Dycus Survey (see
Figure 21). Dycus (al so spelled Dicus) swore that she
had arrived in Red River County in 1834, and in 1838,
she received a certificate entitling her to a league and a
labor. On April 17, 1838, the land was surveyed, and
11 months Later, Dycus and her new husband, John
Wright, assigned all their rights to the field notes to
Edward H. Tarrant, a chief j ustice of Red River County,
for $600.00 (Texas. General Land Office 1872).
On April 21, 1846, Tarrant sold 1,500 acres,
including the future location of 4 IBW1 77, to Jonathan
H. Raines for $300.00. The following year, Raines made
a gift deed for the property to Harriett Raines, who held
the tract until July 18, 1856, when she quitclaimed 839
acres to Joseph C. Moore. By the late 1860s, Moore
had declared bankruptcy and assigned the 839 acres out
of the Dycus Survey to Nicholas J. Moore. In 1869,
Moore deeded the same property to R. W. Campbell o f
Fannin County, who owned it for 14 years.
On June 18, 1883, Campbell sold the 839 acres to
John M. McGill for $1,600.00 in cash and notes. McGill
then subdivided the land into lots, designating the 120

Two years later, Lewis sold 50 acres in the eastern half
of lot I to Walter R. Nelson for $200.00 (Deed Record

Nelson, a native of Ohio who was born in about
1862 and had immigrated to Texas by 1893, was married
to Mary H. Nelson (born ca. 1876 in Arkansas), with
whom he had six children, all born in Texas: Pearl (born
ca. 1894), Mary R. (born ca. 1896), George L. (born
ca. 1898), Gus M. (born ca. 1904), Ollie M. (born ca.

history indic:ues that the Nelson family occupied the
area from 1893 10 1941 when the U.S. government
acquired the land. The Nelsons made substantial
improvements to lhc land, which included a dwelling
and barn. However, remains of such featu res were
not found by this or the previous survey. Given that
the site may have been destroyed, it is recommended
that it be considered ineligible for National Register
listing (see Chapter 6).
41BW332
Location and Previous Investigations

Site 41 BW332 is localed at the intersection of West
Rock Road and Cone Trail, near the eastern edge of the
demolition area. lbis places the site in the west-central
panofSubarea4Q (see Figure 19). lbis site was defined
as multicomponent since IO prehistoric artifacts and 30
historic artifacts were recovered from shovel tests (Peter
and Cliff 1990b:62-65). These artifacts were recovered
from 0-20 cm in 8 of 11 shovel tests. An additional 47
historic artifacts were recovered from the surface of
West Rock Road, which crosses the southern edge of
the site. Prehistoric artifacts consisted of 9 pieces of
lilhic debitage and l unifacial 1001. The historic artifacts
consisted of ceramic sherds, bottle glass, window glass,
cut nails, and fragments of plastic and metal (Peter and
Cliff l 990b:65). The prehistoric artifacts could not be
used to determine a date of occupation, while the historic
artifacts suggested an occupation ranging from 1869 to
1932 (Peter and Cliff 1990b:66). However, because of
the impacts to the site from road maintenance activities
and logging practices, as well as the low density of the
prehistoric materials, the site was recommended as
ineligible for National Register listing.
Site History

Site 41BW332 is located on Tract No. 208, a
66-acre parcel of land in the northwest comer of the
Nancy Dycus Survey (see Figure 21). The legal
history of Tract No. 208 is identical to that of Tract
No. 209 as described for 41BWl77 until July 5,
1897, when F. B. and Mary Lewis sold the 66 acres
that comprised the west end of the lot to H. E. Presley
(Deed Record 81 :348). Presley held the land for one
year and then sold it to Janie M. McGill, who lived
in Caddo Parish, Louisiana (Deed Record 20:554555). McGill owned the 66 acres for only three
months before selling the land to J. D. Jackson on
November 18, 1898 (Deed Record 36:226).

Jackson held the 66-acre tract until July 13, 190!
apparently occupying very modest improvements
raising a few livestock. He then conveyed the property
to J. E. Rounsavall for $20.00 and the assumption of
four promissory notes worth $200.00 (Deed Record
36:228). It was Rounsavall and his family who made
more-significant improvements to the land, raising cattle
and hogs and farming.
By 1910, the Rounsavall family consisted of John
Ennick RounsavaU (born ca. 1859 in Louisiana), his
wife, Eliza (born ca. 1872 in Arkansas and sister of Jack
Storcks associated with 41 BW335), and their five Texasborn children: James I. (born ca. 1893), MinnieO. (born
ca. 1895), Exie C. (born ca. 1900), Mary M. (born ca.
1903), and Margaret E. (born ca. 1907) (Texarkana
Gar.ette, November 23, 1927:2; U.S. Bureau of the
Census 1910). They owned other improved land in the
Watson Survey outside the present-day boundaries of
the Lone Star facility, but they appear lo have been living
on the Dycus Survey since they were enumerated in 1910
immediately after the Walter H. Nelson family, who were
living at 41BW177.
John Ennick Rounsavall died on May 30, 1918.
His widow declared an estate valued at $1,200.00 that
consisted of 66 acres in the Dycus Survey and 160 acres
in the Jackson Survey; notes and cash; and livestock,
including 19 head of cattle, 2 mules, and II bogs
(Probate Minutes 9:535, 542). Five months later, Eliz.a
Rounsavall sold the 66 acres in the Dycus Survey to M.
B. Brewer for $937.60 (Deed Record 83:39), a price
that suggested that this tract comprised the bulk of the
estate. Brewer was the owner when the government IOOk
the property in December 1941 for a compensation of
$885.00 (Deed Record 181:334-345).
Deed, tax, and census records, together with
artifacts noted at the site, suggest that 41BW332 was
occupied by the F. B. "Pete" Lewis Family, who
owned the property from January l, 1891, to July 5,
1897, during which time they operated a modest farm
with a few head of cattle. This fami ly included F. B.
(born July 1849 in Tennessee); his wife, Mary S.
(born March 1846 in Texas); and six Texas-born
children: F. B., Jr. (born December 1877), William
A. (born November 1879), Nettie D. (born August
1881), Vitus S. (born March 1885), Mattie (born
March 1885), and Unus (born July 1889) (U.S.
Bureau of the Census 1900). The site also appears
to have been occupied by the J. D. Jackson family
from November 1898 to July 190 I, and it may have
been occupied by the John E. Rounsavall family from
July 190 1 until October 1918, although it is possible
that the Rounsavalls chose to build a new residence
on the same tract of land at 41BW333.

Location and Previous Investigations
Site 4 IBW333 is located at the northwest corner
of a north-south fire lane and West Rock Road al the
cast edge of Subarea 4Q, ca. 450 m east of 4 JBW332
(sec Fi!!ure 19). The site was reported as consisting of a
surfac;scalier of historic artifacts, a well/cistern, and a
brick concentration. These historic artifacts and features
covered an area of at least 1,600 m2 (Peter and Cliff
l 990b:66--69). Artifacis recovered included botlle glass,
ironstone ceramic sherds, and a pocket watch part. These
artifacts were thought to be suggestive of an occupation
starting around 1875 and continuing until the site was
acquired by the U.S. government in 1941. The well/
cistern was described as a 6-inch-diameter pipe within
a 30-inch-diarnetercement slab. The brick concentration
positioned to the east of the cistern was described as
3 m long and 1.0-1.5 m wide. No shovel testing was
done since there was a chance that this cistern/well was
contaminated. Without shovel testing to help determine
site extent or disturbance, the site was considered to be
of unknown National Register eligibility.

41BW334

Location and Previous /11vestigations
Site41BW334 is a historic site located in the southeast comer of Subarea 4Q (see Figure 19). It is on an
upland ridge west of the intersection of a fire Jane and
the SWEPCO powerline. When first recorded in 1989
a well/cistern, a brick concentration , and a smali
concrete foundation were identified. Two shovel tests
were excavated near the foundat ion and the well/cistern.
These tests produced domestic refuse suggesting that
the occupation of the site began ca. 1874 and continued
until 194 1 when the site was acquired by the U.S.
government. Further investigations were recommended
for assessment purposes (Peter and Cliff 1990b:69-7 l).

Site History
For the legal history of Tract No. 208 on which
4JBW333 is located, see 41BW332.

Site History
Site 41BW334 is located on Tract No. 186, a 20acre parcel of land in the northwest corner of the Nancy
Dycus Survey (see Figure 21). The legal history of Tract
No. 186 is identical to those of Tracts Nos. 208 and
209 as described in the hi stories of 4JBW177.
4IBW332, and 418333, until 1891. At that point,
McGill sold the 120-acre lot 1 on which 41B\Vtn,
41BW332, and 41BW333 are located and kept the 120acre lot 2 on which 41BW334 is located.
.
Three years later, on November 27, 1894, McGi 11
sold lot 2 to John Cullen for $480.00 (Deed Reco~
14:567- 568). Cullen held the property for one year~n
then sold it to J. E. Presley for $1.00 and the ~sump:
of Cullen's debt to McGill (Deed Record 93.337). E.
tract became the location of the home of the HarTY
Presley fami ly, which consisted in 19~ of Presley~=:
November 1855 in Mississippi); his wife, Sarah E.

Current Condition
When 41BW333 was visited in 1997, it was found
to be disturbed. A 25-x-30-m bulldozed area in the
center of the site was noted, and the well/cistern location
was determined lo be buried under a bulldozer push
pile (Figure 41). From inspection of the islands around
trees in the bulldozed area, it appeared that at least 20 cm
of topsoil had been removed. Loose machine-made
bricks were noted in approximately the location at which
they were originally reported, as bulldozing had also
affected the brick concentration. Eight shovel tests were
placed around the edges of the disturbed area; three of
these recovered historic artifacts from 0-20 cm. Two
sherds of clear container glass, one body sherd of an

and dates from 191 5 to 1940(Steinbomer1982). These
artifacts suggest that the occupation of the site could
have begun in the early l 900s, but there is a dominant
Depression-era compo ne nt.
Site area based o n the extent of the features and
positive shovel tests can be calculated at 3,800 m2. While
impacts have occurred from the building of the
SWEPCO power line, the site has not been extensively
bul Idozed. It is estimated that at least 80 percent of the
site remains intact. This appears to be a relatively intact
example of a small Euro-American farmstead dating
mostly to the early twentieth century. It is recommended
that it be considered potentially e ligible for listing in
the National Register (see Chapter 6).

Gazette. August 13, 1954); and e ight c hildre n, all born

(born January 1893); William H., or "Billie" (born April
1895); Alexander (born February 1897); and Mattie
(born February 1900). By 1910, some of the chi ldren
had moved out of the household, but a ninth child, Ruth,
had been born in about 1906, and two grandchildren,
James E. and William H. McFall [McFaul], had moved

m.

H. E. Presley d ied on January 9, 1933, and the
family farm passed to his widow and surviving children.
They decided to subdivide the 120-acre tract into six
20-acre parcels, which were surveyed on February 5,
1940. Lot 6, which was the location of 41 BW334, was
deeded on March 3 1, 1941, to Olivie Presley Brower
(Deed Record 182:288). While Deed Record 182 spells
the name "Brower" and states that Olivie was the wife
of "M. B. Brower," the correct spelling of the name
probably is "M. B. Brewer," the same individual who
acquired the adj oining Tract N o. 208 from Eliza
Rounsavall in 1918 (Deed Record 83:39). O livie
immediately sold lot 6 to her brother, W. H. Presley
(Deed Record 182:289). Presley, who served as a county
commissioner from 1940 to 1942 and as county treasurer
from 1958 to 1968 (Jennings and Varner 1976:30, 31),
was the owner when the property was taken by the U.S.
government on N ovember 17, 1942 (Deed Record
183:484). Thus, 41BW334 appears lo have been the
location of the Harry E. Presley farmstead, which was
occupied by the family between ca. 1895 and the 1930s
with the exception of approximately one year (ca. 1898),
when Presley was a resident of Anderson County (Deed
Record 20:348). The farmstead was owned by one of
the Presleys's descenda nts until the early 1940s.

41BW335
Location and Previous Investigations
S ite 41BW335 is located a t the southern tip of
S ubarea 4P (see Figure 19). The site area consists of a
strip of land on a rise that is at the intersection of two
fire lanes encircling the demo lition area. When the site
was recorded in 1989, it was found to be heavily
disturbed by bulldozing that was probably associated
with improvements to and maintenance of the fire lanes.
One large rock was noted which cou Id have been a pier

Cliff l 990b:71). Thirty-three artifacts were recovered
from the firebreak s urface in five of the eight shovel
tests. These artifacts consisted of his toric domestic
refuse suggesting a beginning occupation date in the
1870s (Peter and Cliff 1990b:71). H owever, because
of the extensive disturbance, the site was recommended
as ineligible for listing in the National Register.

Current Condition
Whe n the s ite was reexamined in 1997, all three
features were found to be in good condition. Nine shovel
tests were excavated, and five of these produced c ultural
materials. All of the positive shovel tests were located
north and west of the well/cistern and small foundation
(Figure 42). Recovery from the shovel tests consisted
of one large whiteware plate sherd with floral decal
decoration that is partially worn off; one whiteware
saucer rim with repousse-molded decoration; fou r
undecorated whiteware sherds; o ne stoneware body
sherd with Bristol-glazed exterior and Albany-type slipglazed interior; two sherds of clear container glass; two

in 1840. Charles Moores settled en. 2 miles northeast
ofRedwater (Jennings 1961: 126. 137), a short distance
south of the present-day Lone Star facility. His son. A.
R. Moores, settled on the Lane Sur vey where he
established a plantation and probably lived with bis
family at 41 BW38 I.
A. R. Moores sold lnnd out o f the eastern portion
of the Lane Survey following his bankruptcy in the
J 860s. However, he anti his wife, Pauline, kept the
balance or the propcrty, nnd the land in the vicinity of

owned by John W. Lane until his widow deeded a portion
of the survey to A. R. Moores in 1853.
Anderson Rochelle Moores was born in South
Carolina in about 1823 to Charles and Mary Harrison
~oores. In 1837, Charles and his five oldest sons
(including A. R. ) scouted the area of present-day Bowie
County. Then, after leaving two sons to clear land,
Moores returned to his home in North Carolina and
collected the rest of the family. A. R. Moores recorded
the details of their trip, which ended in northeas t Texas

41BW335 and 41D\V322 was referred to as the
"Homes1cad Tuct of .. . Pauline Moores" (Deed Recortl
48:6). Following Pauline's death, the property was
divided into six subtracts, which were deeded to her
children. Her daughter, Pauline, received lot 4 (the
apparent location of 41BW335), while her da~ghter,
Adelia, received lot 5 (the apparent location of
41BW322).
By 1902, lot 4 had passed from Pauline Moores to
her sister, Mattie Moores Miller of Montgomery County.
Then, between November 22, 1902, and January 16,
1904, Miller and her sister, Adelia W. Moores Dunn,
sold a 117-acre tract to Jack Starcks (also spelled
Starkes). Described as the Paulina [sic] Moores tract
that consisted of 53.5 acres (lot 4 and the location of
41 BW335) and an adjoining 63.5-acre tract that
followed the boundary lines of Tract 5, the property
sold for a total of $ J,051.20 (Deed Record 48:6, 7).
Starcks was the owner of the land in December 1941,
when it was taken by the U.S. government (Deed Recqrd
181 :322-334).
Tract No. 136, which comprised part of the A. R.
and Pauline Moores property and was referred to as the
Pauline Moores homestead tract, is the location of two
recorded historic sites. A comparison of artifacts from
41BW335 and 41BW322, as reported in Peter and Cliff
(1990b:41-42, 71, 74) suggests that 41BW322 is the
location of the earlier site and, therefore, probably
represents the Moores's plantation home. Site 41BW335
appears to be the later site, having a suggested
occupation postdating 1874. If the site was, in fact,
occupied during the late nineteenth century, it probably
was the location of a secondary improvement on the
Moores property. The 1904 USGS map depicting a
structure in the area of 41 BW335 further suggests that
the site may have been the location of improvements
constructed and occupied by Jack Starcks or his
employees between 1902 and 1942.

Cu"ent Condition
A visit to 4 IBW335 in 1997 found the site in the
same condition as originally recorded. Though under a
stand of large oak trees, the site surface undulates with
bulldozer push piles. The single possible pier stone was
found near the site datum, which itself showed signs of
recent disturbance, as its metal cap was partially
removed and unreadable (Feature 43). No shovel tests
were excavated, but the surface of the firebreak was
reexamined for materials. Only one small stoneware
sherd with Bristol glaze on the interior/exterior and a
cobalt blue stripe on the exterior was found. This lack
of material in the firebreak may suggest further site

degradation as the previous survey reported that
Â· d o f the arllÂ· facts recovered ca appro~Â·
irnately one-thir

the firebreak surface. Clearly, the disturba

41DW336

Locatio11 and Previous I11vestigations
Site 4JBW336 is a house site located just outside
the eastern edge of Subarea 4T (see Figure 19). The
site is situated east of the SWEPCO power line, north
of Sedge Lane, and west of Bob Lane Cemetery (this
cemetery is misplotted on the 1970 and 1975 photorevised Leary, Texas, USGS quadrangle). Though it
appears to be mainly outside the survey area on the
Corps of Engineers contour map, the site was updated
because of the vagaries of the southern boundary on the
ground.
The site was originally recorded as consisting of
surface artifact scatters, a possible cistern, and a metal
pipe projecting from the ground surface. The cistern
was marked by a concrete slab with a pipe encased in a
concrete column. The pipe/column were not in situ, but
they lay on top of the slab (Peter and Cliff 1990b:7475). No shovel tests were dug, but eight artifacts were
collected from Sedge Lane. These consisted ofdomestic
refuse that suggested an age of 1880 to 1954 for the
assemblage (Peter and Cliff 1990b:74). The 1904 USGS
map for the area indicated that one building stood in
the vicinity of 41 BW336, while the 1941 U.S. governÂ·
ment inventory of the site recorded two houses, two
barns, and four other miscellaneous structures (Peter
and Cliff 1990b:74). The site did not appear seriously
impacted in 1989, and further investigations were
recommended to assess National Register eligibility
once it was determined that the site was not
contaminated.

Site History
Site 41 BW336 is located on the southern edge of
Tract No. 133, a 73.47-acre parcel in the J. W. Lane
Survey (see Figure 21 ). The history of the property on
which lhesite is located is the same as that for4IBW33~
and 41IlW38 I until the death of Pauline Moores ~n
the subdivision of her estate in 1874. At that point,

a map of the partitioned property was done under th~
direction of J. B. Mc\Vhorter, J. G. Holloway, a~
Stephen White, no copy has survived in the ~owre
County deed or district court records. The l~at1o~s of
lot I and the adjoining lots 2 and 3 were 1~entrfied
through deeds for those and adjoining properues.
Shortly after the partition and division, Mary
Moores Dunn, a resident of Little River, Arkansas, sold
lot 1 to her minor sister, Adelia W. Moores, for$ I 00.00
(Deed Record 21: 186). Adelia married Robert M. Dunn,
and by March 1889, when she sold the land Lo Jonathan
M. McGill for $275.00, she was living in Springfield,
Missouri (Deed Record 21: 192). Immediately, on March
25, McGill sold lot 1 to Eli Boone together with lot 3 to
the north for $268.32 (Deed Record 21: 190). At the
time, Boone probably was living at 41BW381 on Tract
No. 249, which he had purchased from W. H. H. Moores
in 1881.ByJuly 13, 1889,Boonealsohadacquiredlot
2 out of the Moores estate (Deed Record 21:185, 188)
so that he owned much of the east end of the Lane Survey
between 41BW336 and 41BW381.
Boone owned the property until September 8, 1923,
when he and his wife, Nannie, deeded the 40-acre tract
on which 41BW336 is located to their son, Eli Boone
Jr. (Deed Record 105:431). On October 19, 1931, Eli
Boone Jr., purchased ca. 23 acres to the north of the 40acre tract, creating a parcel of 73.47 acres (Tract No.
J 33) that was taken by the U.S. government on February
11, 1942 (Deed Record 190:12).
Artifacts and deed records suggest that 4 IBW336
may have been the location of the Adelia W. Moores
Dunn and Robert M. Dunn house after 1874. The
property was owned by Eli Boone, who probably lived
at 41 BW381, between 1889 and 1923, when he deeded
it to his son, Eli Boone Jr. It is likely that 41BW336
also was the location of the Eli Boone Jr. farmstead and
was improved by him between 1923 and 1942.

Location and Previous In vestigations
Site 41BW338 is a historic site located at the soulJi.
central edge of Subarea 40 (see Figure 19). Part or the
site projects into the first fire lane that surrounds the
demolition area. The site was originally identified as
covering an area of 6,750 m2 â¢ Ten sbovel tests produced
62 historic artifacts and a brick feature. An additional
32 artifacts were recovered from tbe surface of the
firebreak. Artifacts consisted of bottle glass, whiteware,
ironstone, handmade bricks, mortar, window glass, and
items such as suspender parts and a shoe eyelet. These
artifacts suggested a dale range from 1840 to 1990(Peter
and Cliff l990b:80). The brick feature appeared to be
composed of intact laid bricks beneath the plow zone
of the fire lane. The presence of this feature was used to
argue that, while most of the site is within the fire lane,
disturbance was not great (Peter and Cliff 1990b:82).
Additional work was recommended for National
Register assessment.

located on Tract No. 129 in the Julia Davis Headright

District Court issued a headright certificate to David
Jarrett, entitling him to 1,280 acres. On December 27,
1847, 640 acres were surveyed for Jarrett, chain carriers
being A. R. Moores (see 41 BW335) and David Elli[o]tt,
whose property was located a short distance south and
southeast of the Jarrett Survey outside the present-day
boundaries of the Lone Star Army Ammunition Plant
(fexas. General Land Office 1856).Jarrettwas listed in
the 1850 census as a 56-year-old native of Virginia who
served as Bowie County sheriff from 1849 to 1853
(Jennings and Varner 1976:31 ). His household consisted
of his wife, Betsey E. (a 40-year old native of North
D.rolina) and three Tennessee-born children: David (17
years old), Minerva ( 15 years old), and Martha ( 13 ye.ars
old).
Jarrett received a patent for his 640-acre survey on
June 24, 1856 (Texas. General Land Office 1856), and
he acquired other property in the P. S. G:i.rrison and
William Burnsides Surveys. By 1866, however, be

apparently had died, and his widow conveyed the Jarrett
Survey to their son, David M. Jarrett, on August 29,
1866 (Deed Record 15:381). During the 1870s, Jarrett
paid taxes on his father's survey, which appears to have
been improved, as well as on 782 unimproved or
modestly improved acres in the Lewis T. King Survey.
Al that time, neighbors living three households away
were members of the John King family, whose home
was on the Mary Burnsides Survey to the north at
41BW36 1. In 1880, he appears to have been living on
the survey with his family, which included his 36-yearold Texas-born wife, Elizabeth J.; 4-year-old son. David;
2-year-old daughter, Lizzie; and a female infant later
named Rachel. By 1900, the family had grown to include
Emma (born 1883) and John D. (born 1885).
David M . Jarrett died sometime after 1903, and
his children sued to partition the estate, which consisted
of the 640-acre Jarrett Survey and 157.5 acres in the
Mary Burnsides Survey to the east. On November 18,

was considered ineligible for inclusion in the Natio~~
Register of Historic Places (Peter and Cliff I990b:86).

1915. commissioners di\'idcd the Jarrell Survey into four
I 6<Nicre parcels. each of which was valued at S 1.600.00
(District Court Case No. 12267) (Figure 45). Lot 3 was
located in the southwest quadrant. and ii was set aside
to Liz.z.ie [Elizabeth McCall] Jarrell, who deeded the
parcel to her siblings on May 19, 1917 (Deed Record
76:615). These grandchildren of the original grantee
subsequently owned lot 3 in common until December
194 1. when it was taken by the U.S. government (Deed
Record 18 1:322-334).

CurrenJ Condition
When visited in 1997, the emphasis of additional
work at 4 1BW338 was on determining the nature of the
brick feature and determining its integrity. The original
s ite datum '"'as located and used to determine the general
location of the brick feature. Since the feature was
estimated as being at least 2 m long, four shovel tests
were placed across a 5-x- 10-m area in the feature's
vicinity (Figure 46). While all of these tests produced
brick fragments and other artifacts, no laid bricks were
encountered. The majority of these artifacts came from
the upper 20 cm of the shovel tests, though several brick
fragments were recovered to 40 cm below the surface.
The recovery of fragmented bricks suggests that
continued maintenance of the firebreak may have
adversely affected the feature. Given the estimated size
of the feature, it could be the very bottom of a hearth/
chimney marking a structure location.
Recovery from the four shovel tests consisted of
16 brick fragments, 1 undecorated whiteware sherd, l
brown container glass sherd, l clear glass bottle neck
fragment exhibiting a screw top and mold marks from
machine manufacture, and l window glass sherd. These
artifacts do not contradict the dates estimated for the
originaJ assemblage, though they probably would fit best
with the period just before the land was acquired by the
U.S. government in I 941.
This additional work suggests that it is likely that
the half of the site in the fire lane was the location of a
structure, possibly the location of a Jarrell family house.
G iven the original a rtifact recovery and the later
materials obtained by this survey, it seems likely that
multiple occupations took place. Nonetheless, because
of the possibility that this is one of the earliest fannsteads
in the area a nd may have some intact deposits, it is
recommended that it be considered potentially eligible
for listing in the National Register (see Chapter 6).

Site History
The history of the land on which 41BW339 is
located is the same as that of 4 IBW361 until 1859, wben
the assets of the Mary Burnsides estate were partitioned.
David Jarrett received 500 acres, which he deeded to
his wife, Betsy, on June 8, 1863. Subsequent owners
included C. L. Taylor and W. J. Bethard (1887), who
sold the 31.8 acres on which 41BW339 is located to
D. S. Cantrell for $85.00 on August 31, 1887. Cantttll
already owned the 200 acres immediately 10 the nonh,
where be appears to have made his borne at 41 BW3~ I.
After 1887, the legal history of the 31.8-acre tract was
the same as that for the 200-acre tract on which
4 IBW34 l is located.
The appearance of structures on the 31.8-acre tract
only on maps postdating 1904 suggests that41BW339
may have been the location of a tenant house owned by
the Cantrell family (ca. 19 10-1917) or a farmstead
occupied by property o wners R. A. and Mattie H. H3ll
(1917-1928) and/or D .S. and Naomi Heard (1928194 1).

listing (Peter and Cliff l 990b:88).

The legal history of the propeny
in which 41 BW340 is located is the
same as that for 4 IBW36 I between
1843 (when the heirs of Mary
Burnsides, deceased, were found to
be eligible to receive a certificate for
a league and a labor from the Republic of Texas) and
1876. In that year, John and Virginia King, who
identified themselves as the stepfather and mother of
James Kenney, gave Kenney 140 acres northwest of their
200-acre homestead tract (Deed Record 20:206-207).
Kenney's property was a rectangular parcel that
comprised present-day Tract No. 27 (see Figure 21).
The dates of artifacts located at 41BW340 by Peter and
Cliff (1990b:86, 88) suggested that Kenney occupied
the property soon after 1876. However, that occupation
may have been sporadic, since the 1880 census showed
Kenney living with the Kings.
Kenney married in about 1904, and by 1910 he
and his wife, Minnie, had a I-year-old son named James.
Four years later, Kenney gave his property to Minnie
(Deed Record 67:588), and they continued to live the~
until at least 1920, when Kenney described his
profession as apiarist (beekeeper) and Minnie worked
as the postmistress in Nash. Minnie kept the property
until after her husband's death on March 30, 1922, and
then moved to Choctaw County, Oklahoma, where she
was living in December 1941 when she sold the propertY
to the U.S. government (Deed Record J86: 128).

parts of the site that correspond to scatters mapped by
the original survey. One additional shovel test was
placed in the vicinity of the possible cistern/well, but
no artifacts were recovered.
The identification of the two additional features
does not substantially alter the original survey findings.
Rather, the type of well/cistern found confirms the late
date of the occupation, and the additional negative
shovel test con firm s the scarcity of artifacts.
Disturbances to the site, as also noted by the original
survey, consist of erosion along the small western
drainage and surface disturbance from logging activities.
Because of the disturbance and the late occupation, the
original assessment of ineligibility for National Register
listing is appropriate (see Chapter 6).

Location and Previous Investigations
Site 41BW34.0 is located in the central part of
Subarea 4H (see Figure 19). The site is positioned on a

so, two sandstone rocks or possible pier stones and a
l-x-2-m rectangular depression noted by the original
survey were identified (Figure 48). Approximately 20 m
farther east is a surface scatter of artifacts containing a
washtub, a coffeepot, an enameled bowl, and sheet
metal. On the site's western side, Lwo other depressions
were discovered. These depressions are 2 min diameter
and have an earthen berm around their edge. These three
depressions may represent filled cisterns or pri vies. No
additional shovel tests were excavated, but an amended
site map showing the position of the features in relation
to the original 11 shovel tests was drawn. Identification
of additional features, along with the fact that the
condition of the site has not changed in recent years
strengthen the original assessment that the site may be
a relatively intact example of a Euro-American small
farmstead dating to the Jnte nineteenth and early

which Peter and Cliff (l990b:86, 88) suggested was
occupied by that date. Kenney appears to have used the
site following his marriage in about 1904, and he was
living there with his extended family in 1911. A 1911
deed indicates that Kenney's farm was occupied by an
African-American, Richard Petaway, in 1911 (Deed
Record 59:584-585), but it is not known if Petaway
occupied the Kenney house or another improvement on
the.tract. The Kenneys apparently Jived at 41BW340
u~til James Kenney's death in 1922, after which his
widow moved to Oklahoma.

Site History
The history of the property on which 41B W34 l is
located is the same as that for 41BW361 until 1871,
" 'hen Vuginia A. King purchased 1,503 acres out of
the Mary Burnsides Survey. On August 15, 1872,
Virginia and her husband, John, sold 200 acres out of
the Burnsides Survey to D.S. Cantrell, recently arrived
in Texas from Cherokee County, Georgia (Texarkana
Gazette, November 24, 1939). The tract lay north of
the property owned by David Jarrett in the Burnsides
Survey and measured 1,063.5 varas on a side (Deed
Record 42:478).
D.S. Cantrell ( 1829-1915) (Irby 1958-1959: 11 8)
apparently lived on the 200-acre tract. He appeared last
on the Bowie County census in 1900, when he was listed
as a native of Georgia who bad been born in December
1829.Hiswife, N. P. Cantrell, was born in March 1851
in Louisiana, and there were no children living with
them.
Cantrell died in 1915, and the property, together
with an additional 31.8-acre tract on which 41BW339
is located, was sold by his heirs to R. A. and Mattie H.
Hall in December (Deed Record 79:298-299). The
Halls mortgaged the property in 1922 and then were
unable to pay the debt. A trustee sold the property on
July 3, 1928, to W. M. Walker (Deed Record 128:507),
who sold it in December to D. S. and Naomi Heard
(Deed Record 129:220). The Heards owned the property
when it was taken by the U.S. government as Tract No.
26 in December 1941 (Deed Record 183:527-528, 533)
(see Figure 21 ).
Site 41BW341 is located on land that was owned
by D.S. Cantrell by 1872. Because it was the only land
Cantrell owned until August 1887, when he bought 3 1.8
acres adjoining on the south (the location of 41 BW339),
it appears likely that 41BW34 l was the location of the
D.S. and N. P. Cantrell farmstead between 1872 and
ca. 1900. lt also seems likely that the site was used by his
heirs after that date and by subsequent owners until at
least the 1920s. A lack of structures in the area on a 1942
map suggests that the site was abandoned between the
l920s and the time the government acquired it in 194 l.

original survey. Some new disturbance in the fonn of
construction activities related to a water line that crosses
just south of the site also appears to have taken place.
Disturbance has left the soulh half denuded of vegetation
except for sparse grass cover and two large oak trees
(Figure 49). The surface of part of the south half is
covered with pea gravels which suggests that the site
may have been used as stockpile area for gravels utilized
in construction activities. The north half of the site
supports a cover of second-growth hardwoods and pine
forest. Within the tree line, the surface undulates with
bulldozer push piles. Two shovel tests were placed
beyond or north of the bulldozer piles to determine if
any of the site remains intact. However, neither shovel
test produced cultural materials. Since the extensive
damage to 41BW341 was confumed, Lhe assessment of
National Register ineligibility made by the original
survey must stand (see Chapter 6).
41BW346

Loca!Um and Previous Investigations
Site 4 1BW346 is located near the nor thern
boundary of LSAAP at the northeast comer of Su barea
4B (see Figure 19). The site was originally marked by a
brick cistern and several bulldozer push piles. A small
sample of domestic artifacts (n = 9) was recovered from
the surface near the bulldozer piles. These artifacts
suggested that the occupation of the site began after
1860. Also, three structures appear at the site on the
1942 aerial survey. No shovel tests were excavated
because of the possibility of ground contamination
through the cistern, but the investigators found that the
site was so extensively disturbed they were able to make
an assessment of National Register ineligibility without
shovel testing (Peter and Cliff 1990b: 103-105).

Site H istory
Site 41 BW346 is located on Tract No. 59, a 109.03acre parcel out of the John H . Smithers Survey (see
Figure 21). T he history of the property on w hich
41BW346 is located is the same as that for 41 BW610
between 1839 and 1913, when the owner was Mrs. Ellen
N. Leary. At that point, Leary was selling off tracts of
various sizes, including a 130.85-acre tract she conveyed
to W. G. Crawford (Deed Record 65:499-500). O ne
year later, Crawford sold 20 acres to Mrs. Murk Wheeler.
This property (present-day 41BW346) was located
south of 20 acres that adjoined the railroad right-ofway (Tract No. 58), and the price was $400.00 (Deed
Record 7 1:408-409).

The specific 20-acre t ract on which the s ite is
located did no t exis t prior lo 1914 , and it was
integrated into a larger 110.85-acre tract by 1919.
This creation of a relatively small parcel suggests
that the improvements inventoried there in 1941 may
have been cons truc ted and occupied by Mark
Wheeler a nd his wife, Dudley, and/or by D. A . and
Angie White during the World War I era. Use after
that period probably was by tenants.

Current ConditioTJ
When 41BW346 was revisited in 1996, it was in a
state simjlar to that described by the original survey.
Three bulldozer push piles were noted around the brick
cistern, which sat flush with the ground surface (Figure
50). Brick fragments and wruteware sherds were noted
on top of the push piles. The surface for approximately
20 m south oftbe push piles and cistern appeared runed,
possibly by the passage of heavy machinery. North of
the cistern, evidence of bulldozer activity extends for
at least another 60 m out into an open area that was
likely the location of an early LSAAP water treatment
facility. Because of the extensive disturbance, no shovel
testing was deemed necessary and the original site
assessment of National Register ineligibility is still
applicable (see Chapter 6).

41BW347
Location and Previous In vestigations
Site 4IBW347 is located along the northern
boundary ofLSAAP in the northeast comer of Subarea
4A (see Figure 19). This site is approximately 380 m
west of 4IBW610. IL was identified in the field by a
surface scatter of artifacts along the north boundary
fence, a concentration of concrete chunks witrun the
tree line, and the recovery of artifacts from three of six
shovel tests. Thirty-three artifacts were collected, and
some of these suggested a post-1880 occupation.
However, no structures appear at the site on the 1904
USGS quadrangle or the 1942 aerial survey. The lack
of structures on both the quadrangle and aerial survey
suggests that the site was occupied after J904 and that
occupation ended before 1942.
Disturbances 10 the site consisted of construction
of the north boundary road that crosses the site from
east to west and ground disturbance possibly from timber
harvesting. Due to the distu rbance, Jack of features, late
occupation, and the limited artifact recovery, the site
was recommended as ineligible for National Register
listing (Peter and Cliff I 990b: 105-107).

Site History
Site 41 BW347 is located on Tract No. 7, a 31.27ac re parcel out of the Mary Burnsides Survey (see
Figure 2 l ). The rustory of the land on which 4 1BW347
is located is the same as that for 4JBW36 1 until 1859,
when the heirs of Mary Burnsides, deceased, partitioned
the assets of her estate. A. R. Moores received 1.406
acres on September 27. J859, but declared bankruptcy
soon after. Through a third party, Moores sold I, 180
acres of the Burnsides S urvey to E. G. [also appears as
E .J.] Runnels on Novembcr 24, 1868, and lhis property
remained in Runnels's estate following his death.
In January 1877, the Bowie County probate court
partitioned Runnels's land among ms minor children:
Edmond S., S. C.[?], Pauline, and Lillian Runnels.
LilHan Runnels apparently received 400 acres wruch
sbe deeded to her sister, PauHne Runnels Willis (Deed
Record 17:286). On February 5, 1901, Pauline and her
husband sold 200 acres 10 J. D. Teague of Pulaski
County, Arkansas (Deed Record 46:35), who sold the
small tract on which 41BW347 is located to Paul Butler
for $75.00 (Deed Record 36:221). Butler the n held lhe
property for approx.imately five months before selling
it 10 Henry Brewer for $100.00 o n February 13, 1903
(Deed Record 22:525).
The Brewers owned '.fract No. 7 until 1906 (Deed
Record 46: 183). The subseque nt owner, Louise
Swindell, owned the tract from November 1906 until
the early J940s, when she sold it to the U.S. government
on January 27, 1942 (Deed Record 186:247).
The lack of any struc ture in the vicinity of
41BW347 prior to 1904 and the absence of improvements in 1941 suggest that the site was the location of
buildings constructed by property owner Loui se
Swindell. Ad valorem tax records ind icate that the
Swindell family owned large amounts of property in
Texarkana, where Louise Swindell made her home. It
seems Jjkely, therefore, that 41BW347 was the location
of a tenant house or a secondary residence for Swindell.

Current CondiJion
When visited in 1996, 4 1BW347 appeared to be
in similar condition to that reported by the original
survey. However, some additional disturbance to the
southern half of the s ite was no ted; a 1.5-x- l .5-m
depression occurs southwest of the pile of broken
concrete s labs (Figure 51 ). This new disturbance and
those described by the original s urvey impact slig htly
more than half of the s ile. TI1e disturbance, the apparent
lack of fcalurcs, a nd the late occupation as verified by
the site history limit the site's research potential and

However, the investigators reported
that the site area had been cleared
of vegetation, and seven ceramic
sherds were recovered from the
surface. These sherds indicated that
the site could have been occupied
from 1875 to 1927 (Peter and Cliff
1990b:l44). Due to the possibility
of an early occupation and the fact
that disturbance appeared minimal,
the site was recommended as having
good research polentiaJ. Further
work was recommended t o
determine the site's eligibility for
inclusion in the National Register of
Historic Places.

Shigley of Jasper County, M1ssoun (1909-1911). Who
lost the property when he failed to pay a note <Deed
Record 27:373; Deed Record 52:265; Deed Record
56:513; Deed Record 59:584-585). Subsequently. I.be
200-acre King homestead and 309 acres located
approximately one-quarter mile north of that tract were
sold to William J. Cleveland of Osce(o ]la, Missouri, on
October 3, 1911 (Deed Record 59:584-585).
The Clevelands never occupied the property and,
instead, gave it to their two children, Charles G. (listed
in some documents as G. C. Cleveland) and Lewis c.,
who also lived in Missouri (Deed Record 62:203). These
two individuals and their families then moved 10 Bowie
County and decided to partition the 200-acre tract among
themselves and their parents, William J. and Martha J.
Cleveland, in 1914. The 86 acres on which 41BW361
is located were conveyed to Lewis C. and Beulah
Cleveland, who held them for three years before selling
the tract to James Witmer (Deed Record 78:589).
On August 11, 192 1, Witmer sold the 86-acrc Ir.let
to George A. Beckham for $3,000.00 (Deed Record
I 00:203). Subsequent owners included Mrs. Samuel 0.
Furgason [Fergason I of Pennsylvania ( 1933) and Mrs.
Furgason 's son, Albert Witmer, who owned the propeny
until 1942, when he sold it 10 the U.S. government (Deed
Record 146: 199. 201; Deed Record 186: 166).
Site 41 DW36 I appears to have been the homestead
of Virginia and John King from 187 1 10 1898. Thcrcufter, the site oppenrs to hove been occupied sporadÂ·
icully, with occupants after 1900 probably including
D. M. nnd M. A. Smith ( 1898-1902), W. G. and l\I. E.

Louisiana, where he settled in Wynne Parish and formed.
At the beginning of the Civil War, he became a member
of the governor's staff with a rank of colonel and raised
the first company organized in his parish. In about 1863,
the Kings moved to Bowie County (Chandler and Howe
1939:364; Irby 1958-1959:223; Wallington 1920:2930).
Between 1871 and 1873, Virginia and John King
sold off a few small parcels ofland and established their
200-acre homestead on property encompassed within
present-day Tracts Nos. 84 and 85. Then, on September
I, 1873, they mortgaged most of their property to
William E. Massenberg, withholding only their
homestead tract and approximately 300 acres they had
sold already to various buyers (Deed Record 10:408410). The deed in which the Kings conveyance was
made included a reference to several mills and to engines
and other machinery. Peter and Cliff ( l 990b: 144)
assumed that these improvements were located on the
Kingsâ¢ 200-acre homestead tract. In fact, they were
located on the tract of land they mortgaged to
Massenberg, property they had purchased from
H. R. Runnels (Deed Record 10:4~10). The Kfogs
eventually failed to pay the promissory note, and 1he
mortgaged land was knocked off to William J. Moss at
a public auction at the Bowie County courthouse (Deed
Record I 0:404-410). As a result, tl1e Kings were left
with their 200-acre homestead.
By 1880, the King household consisted of John, a
54-year-old farmer born in North Carolina; Virginia
(Shipp) King, his 42-year-old wife born in Louisiana;
and eight children. The children were J. K. (age 24)
and [John J.] (age 17), both born in Louisiana; and M.
D. (age 15), [Frank A.] (age 12), W. P. (age 10), E. L.
(age 8), A. A. (age 5), and D. R. (age I), all born in
TexÂ·as. Several of the children would become prominent
citizens in the county. John J. King was admitted 10 the
bar on January JO, 1886, after which he was elected
successively county attorney, representative to the Texas
House, and county judge. He later served as a director
of the Texarkana National Bank, Texarkana and Fort
Smith Rail way Company, Port Arthur Canal and Dock
Company, and East Texas Iron Company (Chandler and
Howe 1939:326-328; Irby 1958-1959:223-224). Frank
A. King served as county clerk, county auditor, clerk of
the U.S. District Court, U.S. Deputy Clerk, and U.S.
Commissioner (Chandler and Howe 1939:364). Edward
Lucian King served as deputy county clerk and president
of City Nation:il Bank of Texarkana and Guaranly State
Bank. Eventually, he became an independent oil operator
(Chandler and Howe 1939:3 17).
TI1e Kings appear to have lived ot the homestead

Nevertheless. the site has been so badly disturbed that
its research potential appears compromised, and it must
be assessed as ineligible for National Register Listing
(sec Chapter 6).
41BW363

Location and Previous Investigations
Site 41 BW363 is located along Salt Road at the
northeast corner of Subarea 41 (see Figure 19). The
si te is 125 m southwest of the Langford Cemetery.
When originally recorded, only a cistern and one
embossed Coke bottle fragment were noted (Peter
and Cliff I990b: 148). The cistern was described as
made of concrete, approximately 3 m in diameter,
and filled with rubble and humus. No shovel testing
was done because of the possibility of contamination.
However, a site area of 600 m2 was estimated (Peter
and Cliff 1990b: l48-149). Because a late initial
occupation date (post-1904) was suggested by the
tract records and earl y maps, the research potential
of the site was considered low and the site was
considered ineligible for National Register listing
(Peter and Cliff J990b: J50).

locntcd (Deed Record 71 :44-45).
GÂ· c. nnd Maggie Cleveland kept their 51 Â·5Â·acre
tract in the northeast comer of l~c 200-acre John and
Virginia King homestead tract until October 1917, When
they sold it 10 A. C. Drccd for $ 1,750.00 (Deed Record
78:627). By 1920.. ~very Breed, n 36-~cnr-old narive
of Arkansas, was living ~t 41 B.W363 with his 28-year.
old wife, Angie (from M 1ssoun), and three children, all
born in Texas: 4-ycnr-old Hennon [sic], 2-ycar-oJd
Daisy, and 9-month-old Mabel. Presumably, the Breeds
occupied their 51.5-ncre farm until November 1941
when it was acquired by the United States govemmeo;
(Deed Record 186:30).
Site 4JBW363 is located on property that was
owned by G. C. Cleveland; ad valorem tax rolls for 1916
indicate that the tract may have been improved at that
point. From ca. 1917 to 194 1, the tract was occupied
by the Avery Breed fami ly. While the 1920 census
demonstrates that the Breeds had numerous neighbors
who rented property adjacent to theirs, the U.S.
government inventory of Traci No. 84 does not indicate
the presence of more than one house in 1941. The 1942
topographic map, on the other hand, indicates the
presence of three structures on the tract (Peter and Cliff
l990b:l51). As a resull, ii seems highly likely !hat
4lBW363 is one component of a single ClevelandBreed farmstead, of which 41BW364 is another
component. The presence of glass and brick
fragments at 41 B W364 argues for the identification
of this as the locati on of the dwelling and of
4 IBW~63 as the location of the barn, smokehouse,
poultry house, or shed enumerated in the 1941
federal inventory, or perhaps the dwelling of a tenant
or sq ualter.

Curre11t Co11dition
The reported location of 41BW363 was visited and
explored in 1997; however, no cistern could be found.
A scatter of several oil barrels, brick fragments, sheec
metal, concrete, and asphalt fragments was noted on
the east side of Snit Road in the vicinity of the site, bur
these materials appeared 10 be recent. Six shovel tests
were placed on both sides of the road in the reported
site location (Figure 54). None of these tests produced
cultural materials. It is likely that the cistern originnll)'
reported as filled has been obliterated. The scatter of
recent mntcrinls may indicate that continued acrivities
i~ the area have ndverscly impacted an extreme!~
diffuse site. Consequently, the research value 0
4 I 13W363 is li mited, und th e si te's original
assessment of National Register ineligibi lity must
srand (see Chapter 6).

Site History
The legal history of the property on which
4JBW363 is located is the same as that for 41BW36l
between 1843 (when the heirs of Mary Burnsides,
deceased, were found to be eligible to receive a

At thar point, G. C. (Charles G.) Cleveland received

( 1989). The risk of contamination precluded the
excavation of shovel tests. Extensive sca11ers of
glass, bricks, and metal were noted on the surfo~e,
but no diagnostic materials were collected. A size
estimate for the site based on the surface anifaclS
was given as 5,950 ml. Since no artifacts were
recovered the history of 1he site was used to suggesl
a late oc c upa1i on postdating 1904. This late
occupation, coupled with disturbance mentioned by
the recorders, led them 10 assess the site as ine igi'b)e
.
for inclusion in the National Resister of Historic
Places (Peter and Cliff 1990b: 153).

Location and Previous Investigations
Site 41 BW364 is located soulh of 41BW363 along
the west side of Salt Road in the nor1heast corner of
Subarea 4J (see Figure I9). The only feature originally
recorded at 41 DW364 was a cistern that was described
as a ceramic pipe associalcd wi1h numerous concrete
fragmenls (Pcler and Cliff 1990b: 150). This fea1ure was
considered a cistern because it appeared to be in the
right location of one reported by Dames and Moore

survey. The 1941 U.S. government inventory also lists
two log dwellings on the property. Because log dwellings could indicate an occupDlion significantly earlier
than the pre-1904 occupation indicated by early maps
of the area, the investigators thought the site had possibly
significant research potential (Peter and C liff I 990b:
155).

For a history of the property on which 41 BW364
is located and for conclus io n s regarding the
identification of the site, sec 41 BW363.

Current Co11ditio11
When recently visited , 4IBW364 was found to
have been bulldozed. A 20-m-wide bulldozer swath runs
west from the road and opens into a 2 ,200-m1 bulldozed
area encircled by push piles. Within this bulldozed area
are a possible well and a possible cistern (Figure 55).
The well is approximately 45 m from the road. It consists
of a ceramic pipe sticking out of a shallow depression.
Around the depression is a soil benn that may be a
remnant of the original topsoil. A shovel test was placed
in this berm but no artifacts were recovered. The possible
cistern, a depression with bricks and a n adjacent
concrete slab, is 30 m from Salt Road within the
bulldozed area. The surface of the area was covered
with glass, whiteware, crockery, ceramic tiles, drainpipe,
brick fragments, and concrete. However, no materials
were coUected because diagnostic artifacts were not
observed. To determine if the site remained intact, two
shovel tests were placed south and west of the bulldozer
piles. No cultural materials were recovered from these
tests. Clearly, the research potential of 41BW364 has
been thoroughly compromjsed, and the site must be
assessed as ineligjble for National Register listing (see
Chapter 6).

Site History
The history of 4 IBW365, which is located in the
extreme north end of the 50-acre Tract No. 172 (see
Figure 21), is the same as that of 4lBW361 between
1843 (when the heirs of Mary Burnsides, deceased, were
found to be eligible to receive a certificate for a league
and a labor of land from the Republic of Texas) and
1872, when 1,503 acres were deeded to Virginja A.
King. Approximately one year later, on November 23,
1872, the Kings sold 100 acres to an individual called,
variously, Willis W. Langford, W. M. Langford, William
A. Langford, and Willis W. Langford. The acreage
included all of present-day Tracts Nos. 69, 82, and 172
(Deed Record 3: 189- 190; Deed Record 181 :457-460).
Langford was born on December2, 1826, in South
Carolina. He was married Lbere, then emigrated to
St. Clair County, Alabama, where he had a son in about
1859, and to Tippah County, Mississippi, by 1870. He
was in Bowie County by early 1872; there he bought
his 100-acre farm from the Kings. His tenure was shortlived, however, for he died on January 1, 1873, a scant
five weeks after his purchase. He left a widow, Lenetta
(also spelled Lennelta and Lunelly) and a son and
daughter who continued to live at 4 IBW365 and farm.
Sometime before 1880, Lenetta Langford married
John King Van Pelt, who was in Bowie County by at
least 1878, when he and his wife sold a p iece of land
(Deed Record 10:386). Van Pelt, his daughter, Lorena
(born ca. 1868 in Tennessee), Lenelta F., and her son
and daughter, C. E. Langford and Erner, formed a new
household. The fam ily lived at 4 IBW365 and then sold
it in a series of transactions between 1905 and 1906 to
Carey E. Brooks (Deed Record 37:267; Deed Record
41 :503; Deed Record 44:3 1). According to a greatgreat-granddaughter ofLenetta and Willis W. Langford,
the Van Pelts eventually moved 10 Tennessee, where
they lived in Nashville and Memphis. Van Pelt was an
inventor who received several patents, including one
for a double-action fire-suppression water device
(McDermoll 1997).
111e Brooks fam ily owned the IOO-acre tract as a
group until February 7, 1917, when A. S. Brooks and
Emma Brooks Wendler and her husband, Edmund C.
Wendler of Little Rock, Arkansas, sold their interest in

41BW365

Locatwn and Previous Investigations
Site 41BW365 is located 100 m east of Salt Road
and 20 m nonh of Old Boston Road in the nonheast
comer of Subarea 41 (see Figure 19). The site was
originally defined as a probable homestead marked by
a well/cistern, a large depression, and a surface artifact
scatter. The well/cistern was described as a 6-inch
ceramic pipe protruding 50 cm from the ground surface,
V.:hile the depression was reported as 2.5-3.0 m in
dtameter and 1.5 m deep (Peter and Cliff J990b: 153).
Surface artifacts were noted as consisting of tin cans, a
washtub, glass bottJes, and a large stoneware crock
fragment. None of these were collected and no shovel
tests were excavated.
Though complete title research was not done for
the site at the time it was recorded, the investigators
noted that a single structure appears on the 1904 USGS
quadrangle and two structures appear on the 1942 aerial

farmstead dating to the late nineteenth and early
twentieth centuries suggests that it may yield important
information. It is recommended that it be considered
potentially eligible for listing in the National Register
(see Chapter 6).

adtTUmstrator's deed for 281 acres to real estate investors
B. G. Estes and W. H. Tilson for a consideration of
$ 9.0.48. Legal abstracts do not record a conveyance of
his interest in the 281 acres from Estes to Tilson, nor do
they record a conveyance from W. H. Tilson, but by
1898, at least a portion of the property was owned by
M. D. Tilson. At that point, Tilson sold the 50 acres on
which 41BW366 is located to T. I. Patching (Deed
Record 20:582).
T. I. Patching was listed in the ad valorem tax
records of Bowie County as a nonresident owner of
property, and there is no indication that he lived on Tract
No. 80. He apparenlly sold the tract to D. W. Moore of
Miller County, Arkansas, sometime after 1900, and
Moore then conveyed the tract to Mrs. M. E. Moore on
November 5, 1907 (Deed Record 46: 138). Three years
later, Mrs. Moore sold the 50 acres to W. C. Garrett for
$100.00 and four promissory notes valued at $75.00
apiece (Deed Record 60:90).
W. C. Garrett and his wife, M. I., did not appear in
eitherthe 1910 or 1920 federal census for Bowie County,
but they were listed as resident owners on the Memphis,
El Paso, and Pacific Railroad Survey in 1911and19131918 (Texas. Comptroller of Public Accounts 19101918). Their sale of the property to L. H. Harvey for
$2,000.00 (Deed Record 81 :399) suggests that they
constructed improvements there between December
1910 and September 19 18. It is possible that the
buildings described in the government's inventory
constituted the Garrett farmstead. Structures Listed were
a 30-x-30-ft frame dwelling, a 20-x-20-ft boxed barn, a
JO-x-16-ft frame poultry house, and an 8-x-16-ft poultry
house. The square dimensions of the dwelling suggest
a pyramidal-roofed configuration, which wa.s an
architectural style common to the 1910-1925 penod.

41BW366
Location and Previous Investigations

Site 41BW366 is located on the north side of Old
Boston Road near the intersection of Rock Road in the
southwest comer of Subarea 41 (see Figure 19). The
site was recorded in 1989 as being marked by ornamental plants and a contamination warning sign at the
road, a cistern, and several artifact scatters, one of which
was composed of brick and concrete. The cistern,
capped with a metal plate at the time it was recorded,
was described as 90 cm in diameter, 75 cm taU, and of
cement construction. Next to the cistern was the scatter
of brick and concrete. Fifty meters to the north and 60
mto the west of the cistern, metal artifacts were recorded
on the surface. Based on the extent of the features and
the meta\ artifacts, the site area was calculated as 10,350
ml (Peter and Cliff 1990b: J55-156). However, because
of the contamination, no shovel tests were excavated,
and since no diagnostic artifacts were seen on the
surface, no collections were made. Though the site was
thought lo have some research potential, assessment was
deferred

Texas CaÂ· 19 '
Jn March J923, the Harveys sold their fam1 to J.E.
d Etta Hudgins for $1,500.00 (Deed Record 104:390).
~hn E. Hudgins (born in Texas on Octob~r 30, 1882)
and his wife Mary E. [Etta Vernon) (born m Alabama
February 5, J887) had appeared on the 1920 Bowie
~unty census. Their children at that point were all
Texas natives: Stella (born ca. 1907), Carlos (born ca.
J908), Etama (born ca. 1909), Mark (born ca. 19 11 ),
Opal (born ca. 1914), and Grauer[?] ~born ca. 1920).
Tue Hudginses owned Tract No. 80 until November 14,
J936, when they sold it to their son-in-law Carl Goree
(married to Estella Hudgins), who worked in the late
1930s as foreman for the Twin City Lumber and Shingle
Company in Texarkana (Deed Record 157:125; R. L.
Polk & Co. 1938:150). The Gorees conveyed the 50
acres to the U.S. government for $1,250.00 on December 30, 1941 (Deed Record 186:152).
Peter and Cliff's (l 990b: 155) description of
41BW366 states that structures in the site area appeared
on the 1904 USGS quadrangle map, while artifacts noted
in 1997 point to an occupation dating to the late nineteenth century. Deed and tax records suggest that any
structures on the site prior to 1910 would have been
associated with a tenant occupation. The configuration
of the house located on the site in the early 1940s points
to a redevelopment and improvement of the site by the
W. C. and M. I. Garrett family.
Site 41BW366 probably was occupied by tenants
employed by B. G. Estes and W. H. Tilson and by T. I.
Patching between 1875 and ca. 1900. After 1910, it
appears to have been occupied by the W. C. and M. I.
Garrett family (1910-1918), the Lonnie H. and Laura
E. Harvey family (1918-1923), the J. E. and Etta
Hudgins family (1923-1936), and the Carl and Estella
Goree family (1936-1941).

Current Condition
When the survey crew visited 41BW366 in 1997,
they found that it had been bulldozed. The cistern is
still intact, as are the contamination sign and ornamental
plants at the edge of the road (Figure 57). However, a
2.000-m1 area has been bulldozed around the cistern,
and push piles are obvious at the edges of the area. No
shovel tests were excavated because of the contamination warning, but the bulldozing had exposed and
scau~red numerous artifacts, allowing a grab sample of
~ossible diagnostic artifacts to be made. These artifacts
In~lude one whiteware cup rim with teal transfer print
Wit~ a foliage pattern (late style, ca. I 870s- l 890s), one
Whiteware plate rim with molding and partially fugitive
polychrome decal, one undecorated whiteware sherd,

one stoneware bowl sherd with Bristol-glaze interior
and exterior with molded and cobalt decoration on the
exterior, one stoneware crock base with Bristol glaze
on the interior and exterior, one clear glass container
sherd, one brown glass container sherd, one aqua glass
container sherd, and one window glass sherd. Also
recovered was an aqua glass panel bottle sherd with the
embossed label " ... IN-ON ... ,"which is a household
oil under the brand name "3-IN-ONE OIL CO." This
type of bottle dates to 1885-1890 (Wilson 1981 :94).
All of this material fits into a date range of ca. J870s1890s, and this range fits with the tenant occupation of
the site as described in the site history.
Though only part of the site was damaged by the
bulldozing, the area damaged was most likely the
location of the house given the presence of the cistern
and extensive artifact scatter. Archeologically, the
features and artifacts surrounding the house would
provide the best data concerning the site's occupations.
Unfortunately, these materials have been dis turbed.
Thus, the research potential for 41BW366 bas been
compromised, and the site must be considered ineligible
for listing in the National Register of Historic Places
(see Chapter 6).
41BW367

LocaJion and Previous Investigations
Site 41BW367 is located on the north side of Old
Boston Road at the southeastern edge of Subarea 41
(see Figure 19). Presently, the site overlooks a LSAAP
solid waste disposal area. When originally recorded,
41BW367 was considered a homestead location because
structures appear on the 1904 USGS quadrangle and
the limited archival research done indicated a pre-1904
occupation (Peter and Cliff 1990b: 157). The site was
marked by a capped brick cistern, scattered artifacts,
bulldozer push piles, and vehicle ruts. The disturbance
was attributed to activities associated with the nearby
waste disposal area. Because of the possibility of
contamination, no shovel testing was done; a surface
collection was not made since no diagnostic artifacts
were observed. Site size was estimated at 1,575 ml
(Peter and Cliff l 990b: 157). The site was assessed as
ineligible for listing in the National Register of Historic
Places because of the extensive disturbance.

Site History

41 BW367 is located (see Figure 21) is the same as that
of 41BW366, having been owned by H. A. Johnson,

Estes (who also appears as B. F. Estes) and W. H. Tilson
(1875-1893). In December 1893, Estes and Tilson sold
I00 acres in the nonheast comer of Section 27 to Albert
and Susan McClenan for $250.00. The McClenans, who
were not enumerated as citizens of Bowie County in
the 1900 U.S. census, sold their land on January 5, 1907,
to Louis Heilbron for $250.00 (Deed Record 45:444).
Five months later, Heilbron sold the land to A. W. Staiti,
and Staiti conveyed the property to Mary J. Miller on

the same day (Deed Record 49:381; Deed Record
41:317).
Miller and her husband, T. J., held the 100 acres
for approximately a year and a half, after which they
sold it to W. F. Harvey (Deed Record 44:638). By 1910.

(b<>m ca. I908), and James (born ca. 19 10). 111ey appear
have made substantial improvements to their 100
10
acres, because the price increased from $500.00 in 1908,
when the Harveys bought the property, to $3,250.00 in
1917, when they sold itto R. L. and Ruth Ellison (Deed
Record 81 :422). The Harveys may have constructed the
five strUctureS inventoried by the government in the early
1940s: one 28-x-30-ft frame dwelling, one 18-x-30-ft
boxed barn, one 8-x-30-ft boxed corn shed, one
16-x-24-fl boxed garage, and one 12-x-14-ft boxed
smokehouse.
The Ellisons held the property for a year and then
sold it to A. P. Dedmon (also spelled Dedman) on
November 19, 1918 (Deed Record 81:448). Ownership
between 1918 and 1925 is not clear, because there
appears to have been no sale of the I 00-acre tract
recorded during that period. By 1925, however, the
property was owned by Ben Collins, who sold the east
50 acres of the 100-acre tract to J. N. Pierce for
$1,250.00 (Deed Record 121:442).
The Pierces were the owners
between 1925 and December 31,
1941, when they sold the property
to the government for $1,550.00
(Deed Record 186:159). T heir
family consisted of Jasper (born ca.
1876 in Tennessee), Lola (born ca.
1883 in Tennessee), and, by 1920,
six children born in Texas: Virginia
(ca. 1901), Danie (ca. 1908), Nettie
(ca. 1911), Amos (ca. 1915), Luella
(ca. 1917), and Ruby (ca. 1919).
Deed records indicate that
41BW367 was the location of the
Will F. and Florence D. Harvey
family farmstead between 1908 and
1917, and theJ. N. andLolaE. Pierce
family farmstead between 1925 and
1941. While a descrip tion of
41BW367 (Peter and Cliff 1990b:
157) states that structures on the site
appeared on a 1904 USGS
quadrangle map, deed and census
records suggest that any structures on
the site prior to ca. 1908 would have
been associated with a te nant
LE G E N
occupation.

Current CondiJwn
In 1996, 4 1BW367 was found
to be extensively bulldozed. The
cistern is still intact, but an area of

O

1.400 m1 around the feature has been scraped to the
subsoil. Large push piles and dead trees occur at the
edges of the disturbed area (Figure 58). Due to the extent
of the disturbance, no shovel tests were excavated. Some
artifacts such as white-ware sherds, clear container glass,
window pane fragments, and brick fragments were
observed on the surface of the disturbed area. However,
since no diagnostic materials were found, a collection
was not made. Because of the distu rbance, the original
site assessment of National Register ineligibility is
unchanged (see Chapter 6).

A structure wns indicated at the site on the 19 .
aerial survey map and on the government land acquisition records (Peter and Cliff 1990b: 187-189). However, no structure appeared on the earlier 1904 USGS
quadrangle of the area. Original fieldwork found the
site 10 be marked only by a scalier of artifacts in the
roads and a large oak tree al the intersection. No features
were observed. Six shovel tests were excavated on top
of a small rise along Dust Lane, with most placed just
north of where the surface scalier began to taper off.
One of the shovel tests produced two wire nails at
0-20 cm. However, 34 artifacts were collected from
the intersection of the roads. These artifacts included
bottle glass, whiteware, plain light-blue-tinted
whiteware, and light-blue-tinled whiteware with floral
decal. The materials were reported as indicating an
assemblage date range of 1886-1973 (Peter and Cliff
l 990b: I 89).
Disturbance to the site was reported to be extensive.
It was thought that logging and the construction of Dust
Lane may have destroyed most of the site. Because of
the extensive disturbance and the late occupation date,
the site was considered to be ineligible for listing in the
National Register of Historic Places.

August 6, 1913, when he died intestate, leaving as

chjldren, Jane and Betsc~), and Sivie [Sibby]
Record 11 4:3; Probate ~mutes 8:458, 459, 509). The
Payton heirs held a portion of the land until July 26
1924, when 1hey sold two tracts to Dan Robinson, th~
first being J 6.5 acres out of the southwest corner of
Section 27 of the Memphis, El Paso, and Pacific
Railroad Company Survey and the second being
described as 8.5 acres out of a 103.5-acre [sic) tract in
the Burnsides Survey, part of the Payton Payton esiate
(Deed Record 114:37). Robinson's property then passed
to Kate Robinson, who was the owner in 1942 when the
8.5 acres were taken by the U.S. government.
The range of dates for artifacts recorded in Peter
and Cliff (I 990b: 188) suggests that 4 IBW379 was the
loca-tion of the Payton Payton homestead and probably
was occupied by the fami ly from ca. l 886 to 1924. The
property then may have been occupied by tenants of
Dan and/or Kate Robinson, who lived in Redwater south
of the Lone Star facility.

Current Condition

Lillie has changed at 4JBW379 since it was
originally recorded. The large oak tree is still present
and was used as a site datum since the original dalum
could not be re-located. Tite site, as defined by the 1989
surface collection and the single positive shovel test,
covers 4,000 m2 â¢ Titis area was confirmed by artifacts
noted in the roads, but since no diagnostic artifacts were
observed, no collection was made. The site area adjacent
to the roads is hummocky in appearance with abundant
dead fall and thick shrubs. These characteristics fit well
with the original report of disturbance by logging and
the construction of Dust Lane. Two additional shovel
tests were excavated near a snuff bolllc found in the
heavy underbrush in the hope of finding intact cultural
deposits (Figure 59). However, neither shovel te~t
produced materials. Given the disturbed nature of this
site, the original assessment of National Register
ineligibility appears to be appropriate (see Chapter 6).

Sile History

Site 41 BW379 is located in the southern port.ion
of Traci No. 204, an 8.5-acre parcel (sec Figure 21).
The legal history of the land on which 41BW379 is
located is the same as that for 41B W361 until
September I, 1873, when John and Virginia A. King
sold 1,503 acres (less land they had sold already) to W.
E. Massenberg (also spelled Massenburg], trustee for
W. J. Moss, for $2,862.50. Massenberg then conveyed
the land to Moss on February 5, 1874, and Moss kept
the property until July 23, 1880, when he sold 113.5
acres to J. H. Cornelius.
On October 26, 1882, Cornelius quitclaimed his
interest in the 11 3.5 acres back to Moss, who then sold
it to Payton Payton (also spelled Peyton Peyton] on
March 4, 1886, for $575.00. Payton, an AfricanAmerican farmer who was born in San Augustine, Texas,
in May 1840, was married to Matilda Payton in about
1867. By 1900, they had had 13 children, of whom JO
were living. With them at 41BW379 were Nero (born
May 1868), Betsey (born September 1882), Sivie [also
spelled Sibbie] (born July 1884), and Louis (born
November 1886).

demolition area at the southwestern tip of Subarea 4Q
(see Figure 19). Though no features were found when
41BW381 was first recorded, five of nine shovel tests
produced an artifact each from 0-10 cm; an additional 95
artifacts were recovered from the power line access road
that crosses the site (Peter and Cliff 1990b:l92). These
artifacts consisted mainly of bottle glass along with a fair
sample of ceramics, inc luding ironstone, whlteware,
stoneware, porcelain, flow blue, and imitation flow blue.
These artifacts were seen as representing an assemblage
date range of 1870-1945 (Peter and Cliff 1990b: 192195). The recorders indicated that the site was disturbed
by power line construction , but the extent o f the
disturbance was unclear. Therefore, they recommended
further investigation before a National Register assessment
could be made.

Site History
Site 41 BW38 I is located o n Trac t No. 249 in the

norlhcast corner of the John W. Lane
Survey (see Figure 2 1). Lane swore

N ovember 27, 1836, and was a
married man entitled to 1,280 acres.

held the 120-ac r e tract until
February 17, 1873, when he sold it to W. H. H . Moores
for $300.00 (Deed Record 9:492).
On January 2 1, 188 1, Moores sold Eli Boone 75
acres in the northeast comer of the Lane Survey for
$225.00 (Deed Record 2 1: 183), a parcel that included
present-day Tracts Nos. 131 and 249. The 1880 census
suggests that Boone was living in the general vicinity
of the Lane Survey by at least 1880, when he was listed
as a 33-year-old laborer from Georgia who was single
and living in the Henderson household next door to
W. H. H. Moores.
Boone married in about 1886, and by 1900, be and
his wife, Nannie (both in Texas in August 1864) had s ix
children, fi ve of whom were living: Sallie (born June
1886), Nana (?) (born December 1892), Eli (born
August 1894), John H. (born July 1897), a nd Jessie
(born July 1899). By 1910, they had two more children:
Bessie (born ca. 1902) and Gus F. (born ca 1909).
It is not known how long Eli and Nannie lived on

one of them was filed with the state. Howe\'cr, the family
subdi\'ided what they called the Eli Boone estate nnd
then sold 32.25 acres designated as Traci No. I in the
northeast comer of the Lane Survey 10 Gus F. Boone on
February 15. 1931 (Deed Record 138:264). Gus then
held the property until September 1942, when it was
taken by the U.S. government (Deed Record 189:430434).
Peter and Cliff ( 1990b: 195, 197) concluded that
41BW381 may ha\'e been occupied ca. 1870-1945, and
that the owners of the properly on which the site is
located were W. M. Campbell, W. H. H. Moores, and
Eli Boone and his descendants. The authors also
concluded that the site probably was occupied by a
tenant.
A more-recent review of census and tax records
indicates that Eli Boone was, indeed, living in the
vicinity of the Lane Survey by at least 1880, when the
census listed him as part of a household near that of W.
H. H. Moores, then living on the E.T. Jackson Survey
immediately southeast of the Lane Survey. By 1881,
Boone had bought the northeast 75 acres of the Lane
Survey from Moores and had constructed improvements
there. While it is not known how long the Boone family
occupied the 75-acre tract on which 4lBW381 is the
only recorded site, they continued to use it even after
acquiring other land. As a result, 41 BNW38 l is believed
to have been the former location of the Eli Boone
farmstead after 1880.

C1Jrre11t Condition
Two features were identified in the power line
access road when 41BW38 I was revisited (Figure 60).
One feature, a possible cistern, was first noted as a hole
in the ground which, on inspection, appeared to be a
metal-lined shaft with a metal cap buried 10 cm below
the surface. This possible cistern had become visible as
its cap had become compromised by rust and partially
caved-in. A second feature, a concentration of bricks,
is located ca. 12 m northeast of the cistern along the
access road. This concentration is approximately 5 m
in diameter, with two-thirds of that extent in the high
weeds along the north side of the road. The brick
concentration could be the remains of a hearth/chimney
base and may indicate a structure location. Both features
were mapped in relation to the original site datum set in
1989. The features fall within the site area of 6,800 ml
as defmed by the five original positive shovel tests.
Numerous artifacts such as glass and ceramic sherds
are still present in the road between the cistern and the
brick concentration, and one piece of white ware with a
flow blue decoration was collected as possibly diag-

nos tic. Enough of the decoration is not present t

41BW387

Location and Previo11s lllvestigations
Site 41BW387 is located along the west-central
edge of Subaren 41 (sec Figure 19). The site is
immediately southwest of a manufacturing facility
located on the east side of Lincoln Avenue. Site
41BW387 was originally noted in the field as a surface
scatter of metal and glass. Six shovel tests were placed
across the area, and three of these yielded three artifacts
at 0-10 cm (Peter and Cliff 1990b:212). The artifacts
consisted of a wire nail and two ceramic tiles. These
artifacts suggested a tentative date range of 1880-1940.
Disturbance to the site was considered high. Vehicle
ruts, spoil piles, and especially large ditches to the
immediate west of the site were noted. Because of the
limited artifact recovery, the disturbance, and the
probable late date of occupation, the site was considered
ineligible for listing in the National Register ofHistoric
Places (Peter and Cliff 1990b:212).

Site History
Site 41BW387 is located on Tract No. 77. a 75acre parcel in the southwestern portion of the Nath~i~I
D. Ellis Survey (see Figure 21 ). Ellis, a native ofVtrg1rua
who arrived in Texas in February 1833, appeared before
the Board of Land Commissioners of Red River County
in 1838, where his application for a league and a labor
was supported by the oaths of Collin McKinney and.an
individual named Rice. In 1841 , Eilis's right to receiv~
the land was confinned by the District Court of Re
River, and four labors were surveyed for him on May
20. 1844. The Commissioner of the General Land office
issued a patent on November 12, 1849 (Carpenter
1969: 199-200; Texas. General Land Office 1849).

Railroad line along Lhe west boundary of Lhe Eilts Survey
before turning easl and following Lhe south boundary
line of the survey.
.
Norwood owned the land in the Ellis Survey until
February 7 1901 when he deeded it to his daughter,
Ellie N. Le~y (D~ed Record 28:629), who was married
to investor Dan T. Leary. Mrs. Leary then held the
property until October 29, 1919, when she sold it .to
T. C. Whitefor$1,020.00 (Deed Record 89:115). White
and his wife, Mary, kept a portion of the tract, selling
off small parcels within it after 1919.
Sometime before 1941, lhc balance of the Whites's
property passed to their daughter, Ruth, who was born
in Texas in about 1916. Ruth had married J. S. Edwards
(see 41BW388), and it was Edwards who owned Tract
No. 77 on which 41BW387 and 4lBW388 are located
when the U.S. government took it in July 1941 (Deed
Record 181:457-458; Deed Record 190:377).
According to Peter and Cliff (l990b:212), artifacts
from 4lBW387 suggest that the site may have been
occupied as early as 1880, but they also observed that
no structures appeared in the vicinity on the 1904 USGS
map. If this analysis is correct, the site could have been
the location of a tenant house owned by Ellie N. Leary.
More likely, the first occupants of the site were members
of the White family, who moved there ca. 1919. The
family consisted of Thomas C. White (born ca. 1878 in
Texas), his wife, Mary (born ca. 1884 in Arkansas), and
their three Texas-born children: Gurthie (born ca. 1906),
Troy (born ca. 1913), and Ruthie (born in 19 15).
According to government documents, a residence and
other structure were located at the site in 1941, suggesting its continued use after the property passed to the
Whites' daughter, Ruth White Edwards, and son-in-law,
J. S. Edwards.

41BW388
Location and Previous In vestigations
Site 41BW388 is located along the westÂ·central
edge of Subarea 41 approximately 125 m south of
4JBW387 (see Figure 19). The site is situated on the
southeast comer at the intersection of two fire lanes,
one of which runs north from Old Boston Road while
the other runs east from Lincoln Avenue.
Site 41BW388 was originally defined by the
remains of fence lines, surface artifacts, and three
positive shovel tests. Seven shovel tests were excavated
in the immediate vicinity of the site; the three positive
tests were on the southeast corner in the midst of the
surface artifact scatter (Peter and Cliff l 990b:212-215).
Artifacts recovered included bottle glass, whiteware,
stoneware, copper wire, wire nails, window glass, and
metal. These artifacts were reported as having an
assemblage date range of 1887-1990 (Peter and Cliff
1990b:215). Because of the relatively late occupation,
limited artifact recovery, and disturbance, the site was
recommended to be ineligible for National Register
listing.

Site History
For a history of the property on which 41BW388
is located between 1833 and 1938, see 41BW387. On
March 22, 1938, T. C. and Mary White, who own~~
190 acres in the southwestern portion of the NathanJe
D. Ellis Survey, sold 25 acres in the southwest corn~
of the land to their son-in-law, J. S. Edwards. for SI (X).
(Dee~ Record 173:254). The Edwardses subsequen~~
acquired ca. 50 acres from the Whites and owned
1
two parcels until 1941 when they were taken as 1~'
â¢
81
4) No. 77 by the U.S. government (Deed Record l :
458) (sec Figure 2 1).

Current Co11diJion
Site 4 1BW387 was found in much the same state
as it was when recorded in 1989. The site datum was
located, as were two surface artifact scatters (Figure 61 ).
The western scaller consists of sheet metal, and the
southern scauer is composed of a Mason jar, a baking
powder can, and container glass. These scatters define
a.site area of 1,900 m2 , which is similar to the original
Sile area when recalculated for an elliptical boundary.

Current Condition
The condition of 41 BW388
appears to have deteriorated since it
was originally recorded. For
instance. few artifacts were noted in
surface scatters at the site, and no
artifacts were observed in the fire
lanes. The site datum also was not
found. suggesting that grading of the
fire lanes may be a continuing
disturbance to the site (Figure 62).
Because of this disturbance, the
original assessment of National

have occurred before 1904 since a structure does not
appear at the site on the 1904 USGS quadrangle.
Because of the late occupation date, the research potential of this site was considered limited and the site was
recommended as ineligible for National Register listing.

41BW390

Location and Previous Investigations
Site 4 I BW390 is located along Central Boulevard
in the nonh half of Subarea 4C (see Figure 19). The site
was originally reported as covering 1,750 m2 and as
being marked by a large depression that could be a filled
cistern. The site map constructed at the time also
indicates the presence of scattered surface artifacts and
a large oak tree positioned in the center of the site (Peter
and Cliff I 990b:221-220). Disturbances were recorded
as moderate with vehicle ruts and spoil piles evident.
Two shovel tests were excavated in relatively undisturbed areas and together produced 11 artifacts from
0-20 cm below the surface. The artifacts included bottle
glass, I piece of stoneware, wire, and wire nails. These
artifacts are reponed as representing a date range of

verified by such means as shovel testing or feature
identification. Jn all , 12 (67 percent) of the original site
datums were found. This high identification rate can be
attributed to the fact that most of the sites have historic
components with datums plac~d near visible surface
features or are recently recorded prehistoric sites with
their original flagging still intact.
Of those sites that were found, six (35 percent)
arc intact with no visib le disturbance, five (29
percent) arc slightly disturbed, and six (35 percent)
arc di sturbed. Slight disturbance is defined as
instances where only superficial disturbance of the
upper sediments has occurred from erosion or timberharvcsting activities. Slight disturbance should not
greatly affect futu re assessments of a site. Sites noted
as disturbed generally suffer from the effects of
ex tens ive bu lld ozing . The six disturbed sites
(41BW327, 41BW352, 41BW370, 41BW371,
4 1BW383, and 4JBW427) probably shou ld no
longer be considered potentially eligible for the
National Register.

Locality 4E-1
Locality 4E-I is located in the east-central part of
Subarea 4E, approximately 30 m from Fillmore Avenue.
The locality consists of a single chert flake recovered
from 10-20 cm in a shovel test on a pimple mound.
Three additional shovel tests were placed in the area
surrounding the positive test, but no additional cultural
materials were fou nd. The UTM coordinates for this
locality are N3701485/E386760.
Locality 4F-2
Locality 4F-2 is in the east-central part of Subarea
4F. This locality was defined by the recovery of a single
wire nail from 20-40 cm in Shovel Test 53. This test
was located in an area with several large oaks on the
edge of a gully. At approximately 125 m southwest of
the positive shovel test, the gully has been dammed to
form a stock tank. Five additional shovel tests were
placed between Shovel Test 53 and the stock tank
without encountering other cultural materials. StiJJ, the
tank and the nail attest to the utilization of the area for
ranching and fanni ng by premilitary landowners. Tue
UTM coordinates for this locality are N3701845/

Locality 4G-2

Locality 4G-2 was designated when a Gary dart
point was recovered at 20-30 cm in Shovel Test 32.
This shovel test was located on a pimple mound at the
southeastern edge of Subarea 4G. Two additional shovel
tests were placed on the mound, but neither produced
any more cultural materials. Three shovel tests were
placed on other pimple mounds within 30-50 m of the
single productive shovel test without finding artifacts.
The Gary point was finely fashioned from gray and
brown mottled chert (Figure 64). The edges are slightly
serrated and the blade is beveled, suggesting that it bas
been resharpened. It measures 56.6 mm in overall length,
16.2 mm in haft length, 23.5 mm in blade width,

south-eastern corner of Subarea 4H. The southern scatter
consists of enameled metal items including a coffeepot
and wash basins, while the northern scatter contains
mattress springs and car parts. Several shovel tests
excavated near the scatters failed to produce any
subsurface materials. The UTM coordinates for the
locality arc N3699965/E387040.

or Subarea 4H ca. 30 m south of Old Boston Road
suggested a possible location of a house site. However,
three additional shovel tests were dug in the area
surrounding Shovel Test 13 without further recovery,
and there arc no indications of surface features or
domestic vegetation. The UTM coordinates for the
locality are N3700065/E386800.
Locality 48-3

Locality 4H-3, positioned in the south-central part
or Subarea 4H, is 80 m north of Old Boston Road and
120 m east of 41 BW339. The locality consists of a
scatter of historic refuse consisting of the top half of a
double boiler and an enameled pan with handle. Shovel
tests placed in the area failed to produce additional
cultural materials, nor was any domestic vegetation
noted. However, 40 m west or the scatter a 1-m-diarneter
ceramic pipe was found projecting from the ground
(Figure 65). This pipe may mark a well or cistern. Since
they are in close proJtimity, this locality may be
associated with the historic occupation at 41BW339,
though the locality itself likely does not represent a
house site. The UTM coordinates for the locality are
N3700040/E386500.
Locality 48-4

Locality 4H-4 is an old roadbed that runs parallel
to the present Red Lane. Red Lane is a north-soutl1 track
that crosses the central part of Subarea 4H. A northsoulh row of large oak trees separates the new road from
the old. The roads come together at their southern ends
before intersecting Old Boston Road. A scalier of metal
buckets was noted in the borrow ditch of the old road at

the road, no other cultural materials were encountered.
The UTM coordinates for the locality are N3700260/
E386445.
Locality 4H-5
This locality is in the central part of Subarea 4H
approximately 300 m west of Red Lane. It consists of
two enameled pot fragments near a stand of large oak
and hickory trees. Shovel tests placed in the area did
not produce additional cultural materials. The UT.M
coordinates for the locality are N3700200/E386265.
Locality 41-1
Locality 41-1 is a line of large boulders (some of
which are more than a meter in diameter) that appears
to be oriented along a dilapidated barbed wire fence
line. Pieces of wi re are still visible in oak trees along
the line of boulders. The fence line and boulders extend
north-sou th for approximately 200 m with the north end
terminating at a tributary of Aiken Creek. However, the
maj ority of the boulders, and most of the larger ones,
are concentrated in a 20-m section at the south end of
the fence line (Figure 66). The UTM coordinates are
N3700540/E389200.
Locality 41-3
Locality 41-3 is in the northwest comer of Subarea
41, along the southwestern boundary of a manufac turing
facility. The locality is a historic artifact scatter that
116

consis ts o f several galvanized
buckets, large stoneware sherds
fragments of enameled pans, pipes'
and machinery parts. These item~
were observed over an area measuring 15 x 20 m. Several items were
collected from the surface, as it was
thought that they might be diagnostic.
One of the surface collection items
is a large solarized glass bottle/jar
base. It has an Owens suction scar
lbat indicates that it postdates 1904.
The scar partially obscures the
embossed words "Figaro Chemical/
Dallas Texas." Also recovered from
the surface was a partial aqua glass
bottle base with evidence of two
recessed panels and an Owens
suction scar. In addition, there is a
faint embossed maker's mark of an
"0 " within a square, which is the mark used by the
Owens Bottle Co. between 1911 and 1929 (Toulouse
1971 :393).
Four shovel tests were placed across the area, and
only one produced cultural materials, at 0-20 cm below
the surface. Items from the shovel test include: one
whiteware cup rim with a light blue floral transfer print,
one Bristol-glazed stoneware body sberd, one whole
opaque white (milk glass) canning jar lid liner with the
embossed label "Boyd's Genuine Porcelain lined
cap-2-," three clear glass container sherds, two
brown glass container sherds, one whole zinc screw-on
canning jar lid, and one cast iron stove leg. The materials
recovered from the site and observed on the surface
indicate that the locality is a refuse deposit dating to the
tum of the century and the early twentieth century. The
UTM coordinates are N3700725/E388420.

Locality 4J-1
This locality is located in the north-central part
of Subarea 41 j ust south of Old Boston Road. II
consists of a small scatter of historic refuse whjch,
like many other scatte rs identified at LSAAP,
includes two g alvanized buckets and a metal

ASSESSMENTS AND RECOMMENDATIONS

6
Cultural resources are eligible for listing in the
National Register of Historic Places, and thus worthy
of avoidance, protection, or mitigation through data
recovery, if they are significant in American history,
architecture, engineering, or c ulture (National Park
Service 199 1:2). Significant properties are those that
possess integrity oflocation, design, setting; materials,
workmanship, feeling, and association, and:
A. that are associated with events that have
made a significant contribution to the
broad pattern of our history; or

B. that are associated wi th the lives of
persons significant in our past; or
C. that
embody
the
distinctive
charac teristics of a type, period, or
method of construction, or that represent
the works of a master, or that possess high
artistic values, or that represent a
significant and distinguishable entity
whose components may lack individual
distinction; or
D. that have yielded or may be likely to
yield information important in prehistory
or history [National Park Service
1991:2].
Based on the above criteria, 10 of the 42 sites (24
percent) in the nine survey areas are recommended as
being potentially eligible for National Register listing
(T~ble 5); as indicated in Appendix B, the Texas Histoncal Commission does not concur with the recommendations for six of these (4 1BW365, 41BW381,
4 1BW616, 41BW618, 41 BW6 19, and 41BW622). Five
of these are newly recorded prehistoric (41BW61 9,
4 1BW622, and 41BW624) or historic (4 1BW616 and
4
~BW618) sites, while five are previously recorded
~istoric sites (41BW334, 41BW338, 41BW340,
I BW365, and 41 BW38 l ). The remaining 32 sites are

considered ineligible for National Register listing. In
addition, the 30 localities that were identified are considered ineligible. While reviewing the National Register assessments of the 52 sites targeted for re-location
and marking was not part of the scope of this project, 7 \
of these sites (41BW451 at RRA D and 41BW327,
41BW352, 41BW370, 41BW37 1, 41BW383. and
41 BW427 at LSAAP) have been so disturbed that they
no longer retain sufficient integrity to be considered
potentially eligible for the National Register; the recommendations for the other 45 sites targeted for re-location remain the same as when they were originally
recorded. Detailed assessments and recommendations
for the new and reevaluated prehistoric and historic sites
are presented below.

PREHISTORIC SITES
Newly recorded sites 41BW615, 4 1BW6 19,
41BW621, 41BW622, 41BW623, and 41BW624 and
the prehistoric components at reevaluated sites
41BW217 and 41BW332 are assessed here by the application of Criterion D, which requires that sites be
capable of yielding information important to the understanding of prehistory. Multiple research themes have
been introduced by previous researchers as a context
for assessing prehistoric sites at RRAD/LSAAP (e.g.,
Cliff, Hunt et al. 1996: 17 1- 180; Cliff and Peter 1994:
209- 225). These research themes were derived from a
project-specific research design developed for the installations (Peter ct al. 1991) and a planning document
developed for Northeast Texas by the Texas Historical
Commission (Kenmotsu and Pertlula 1993). Pulling
from these sources and from the results of the previous
surveys, two research themes are presented here as providing the most profitable context for assessing National
Register eligibility. These themes are settlement and
subsistence strategies and intra- and interregional exchange and interaction.
Settlement and subsistence strategies deal with how
and why prehistoric populations distributed themselves
across 1he landscape, how prehistoric groups made a

living, and how these two factors were related. This
theme can be applied to ques tions concerni ng differences in settlement and subsistence through time, focusing on changes in settlement permanence, land use,
int.ensity of occupation, and how strategies of resource
utilization changed as populati ons grew and mobility
decreased. The theme of intra- 3nd interregional ex-

change nnd in teraction focuses on how different groups
dealt wilh neighboring groups, how those patterns of
inleraction changed or remained the same through time,
and what influences those patterns had on social, economic, and political patterns. These themes can be used
to develop questions concerning prehistoric occupations
at RRADILSAAP. For instance, the position of the sites

120

Chapter 6: Assessments and Recommendations

the position of the sites on the upland divide between
the Red River and Sulphur River drainages places them
adjacent to the resource-rich bottomlands associated
with bolh valleys. Consequently, what resources did the
uplands have to offer that would make them attractive
for occupation? Were the uplands used to the same
extent as the major river valleys? Were the uplands
occupied pem1anenlly or was the area used seasonally?
How did these patterns of use change though time? Did
the groups utilizing the uplands have contact with other
groups within the surrounding river valleys? Was one
or the other of the major river valleys the focus of this
interaction? Some infmmation regarding these questions
has been already been generated by the previous surveys
at RRAD/LSAAP.
Patterns related to settlement and subsistence
which can address some of the questions posed above'.
have been identified by four previous surveys at RRAD/
1
LSAAP (Cliff, Hunt et al. 1996; Cliff and Peter 1994;
Peter and Cliff I990a, J990b). A total of 120 prehistoric
sites have been identified by these surveys. However,
the majority (n 99, 83 percent) remain unknown as to
the date of their occupation because most were
characterized by the recovery of sparse nondiagnostic
litbic artifacts. The remaining 21 sites produced
ceramics and/or diagnostic lithic artifacts that suggest
the presence of components from the Archaic through
Caddoan periods. These components consist of seven
Archaic/late Archaic, three late Archaic/Woodland, one
Woodland, nine Woodland/Caddoan, and one Caddoan.
No,Paleoindian or early Archajc components were
identified, which is not surprising given the sparse
populations projected for those periods and the fact that
destructive natural processes have had more time to
affect such sites. It js also interesting to note the
multicomponent nature of most sites from the late
Archaic through the Woodland and into the Caddoan
period, as well as the lack of late Caddoan components.
These data suggest that sites can produce important
information concerning who used the uplands and when.
Information on what the uplands may have offered
prehistoric populations is suggested by the landform,
soil, and vegetation associations of the sites. Based on
the results of the 1989-1990 and 1990 surveys, the
majority of the sites were located on upland slopes or
level uplands, while few sites were recorded in or near
the bottomlands (Cliff and Peter 1994:222). These select
landfonns are often associated with well-drained sand
or sill loam soils. Cliff and Peter (1994:224) state that
these soils arc highly productive and would have
provided ample floral and fauna! resources for the
Native American occupants. This contention is also
supponed by the fact that most of the sites recorded lo

=

121

date
. are w1Â·thÂ·in lhe upland oak-pine forests, while few
sites arc found in association with prairies or bouomland
hardwoods (Pelcr and Cliff l 990a:288; Cliff and Peter
1?94:224). Cliff and Peter (1994:225) suggest that,
given the rustoric economic importance of nut resources
to Native American peoples, this association is not
surprising. They explain the lack of sites in the
bottomlands, which also would have supported nut- and
fruit-bearing Lrees, as possibly being related to the
limited extent of the bottomlands. Thus, the bottomJand
resources would have been easily accessed from sites
positioned on nearby well-drained upland landfonns,
which were less susceptible lo flooding.
Site type deterrrunations have also been attempted
with some results. Site characteristics such as size,
density of artifacts, and complexity of artifact assemblages have been used lo define primary campsites (base
camps) and logistical camps (seasonal camps) (Cliff and
Peter 1994:216). Primary campsites, representing long
intensive occupations with continued reoccupaLjon,
would be characterized by a large site area with rugh
artifact density and a wide range of artifact types. A
logistical camp, possibly representing short-tenn use,
would have low artifact densities and limited artifact
types. Within the combined sile sample from the 1990
and 1993 surveys, logistical camps represent 70 percent
of the siles recorded. Unfortunately, few could be dated
because their low artifact densities made recovery of
diagnostic materials unlikely. However, of the five
primary campsites Cliff and Peter (1994:2 16) identified
from the 1990 survey, all except one of unknown age
have Archruc or Woodland components, and one site
also has a questionable Caddoan component. Since no
positively identified Caddoan components were classed
as primary campsites, Cliff and Peter suggest that
occupation and/or utilization of 1he uplands may have
become less intensive during the later time periods.
Adding in the 1993 survey results, this pattern becomes
less clear (Cliff, Hunt et al. 1996: 177- 178). Caddoan
components at primary campsites or reoccupied sites
are just as frequent as are early components. Still, the
sample of datable components from both surveys is
small, and additional investigations would be necessary
to make more confident statements.
Most of the sites recorded by the four most recent
surveys are localed south of the upland divide wi1run
tl1e five major drainages thal flow 10 the Sulphur River.
This pauem wn~ suggesled by the results of the 1988J 989 survey and wns confirmed hy the 1990 and 1993
surveys (Cliff, Hunt ct 111. 1996:179; Cliff and Peter
1994:216; Peter nnd Cliff 1990a:281-285). Funher,
Cliff, Hunl et nl. ( 1996: 179) reported that 66.4 percent
of all the prehistoric sites recorded at RRAD/LSAAP

Red River Am1y Depot and Lone Star Anny A11111111nitio11 Plant
are within the Caney Creek and Elliott Creek drainnges.
Cliff, Hunt et al. (l 996: 179- 180) suggested that the
clustering of sites may be related to the availability of
lithic raw materials in these two drainages. This reliance
on locally available lithic materials may imply a
generally local resource focus.
What is known about the prehistoric sites recorded
by the previous surveys at RRAD/LSAAP provides
tantalizing clues about the infonnation they may contain.
Still, large information gaps concerning the dating of
components, site function, length of occupation, site
structure, and tool kit composition remain. The kinds
of sites that could address these information gaps are
those that have datable and isolable components with
interpretable artifact samples and associated features.
Well-preserved floral and faunal samples would also
provide important information, although they probably
are not present at most sites. As of yet, no known site
on either RRAD or LSAAP has been shown to have
these kinds of data. The previous surveys recognized
that, aside from those sites that could be readily assessed
as ineligible because they are ephemeral or disturbed,
further work was needed at many sites to accurately
determine if they do contain the kinds of data outlined
here.
Three of the new prehistoric sites-41BW615,
41BW621, 41BW623--can be assessed as ineligible
because of their ephemeral natu re and/or lack of
integrity. These sites have artifact densities that fall
substantially below 10/m3 ; 4 1BW623 has a density of
0.8/m', while 41BW6 15 and 4 1BW621 have densities
of 5.6/ml and 2.9/m3. Sites 41BW615 and 41BW623
are also relatively small (at 160 m1 and 400 m 1 ,
respectively) and both show signs of disturbance from
erosion. As for the reevaluated prehistoric sites
(41BW217 and 41BW332), their original assessment
of ineligibility is not altered here because no substantially different infonnation was generated by the additional shovel testing.
Three of the newly recorded prehistoric sites4lBW6l9, 41BW622, and 41BW624-are recommended as being potentially eligible for listing in the
National Register of Historic Places. Site 41BW619,
located on the upper reaches of an unnamed tributary
of Ellioll Creek, has a moderate artifact density (9.7Im')
and size (1,000 m1 ). The site produced only debitage,
but it is within reach of gravel outcrops upslope to the
immediate north and west of the site. As such, the site
may represent a camp associated with the utilization of
these local gravels.
Site 4 IBW622, positioned adjacent to E lliott
Creek, has the highest artifact density (29.25/ml) and
greatest extent (10,600 m1 ) of the six newly recorded

prehistoric sites. It nlso produced a vnriety of artifact
types s uch as a unifacial tool, a hammerstone, a pebble
core, and fire-cracked rocks. The presence of firecracked rocks suggests that hearth features mny be
present. Also, the re is som e indication from the
distribution of artifacts within the shovel tests that at
least two occupations may be represented. The variety
of artifacts al the site, the possibility of features and
multiple occupations, and the site's large size suggest
that 41BW622 could represent a base camp.
Finally, 41BW624, located away from the major
drainages, may be m ost interesting for what it lacks, as
well as for the kinds of artifacts it produced. The site
has a low artifact density (2.7/m1), and it is of only
moderate size (1,800 m1 ) . It produced a variety of
artifacts including a hammerstone, nutting stone,
battered cobble, manuports, and foe-cracked rocks. Yet,
no lithic debitage was recovered. While this Jack of
debitage may be a sampling error, one can probably
consider debitage scarce at 4 lB W624 given its
ubiquitous nature at other sites. This scarcity of debitage
and the kinds of the tools recovered suggest that
41BW624 may be a s pecial-purpose camp that
functioned in the extraction and processing of vegetal
resources.
A recommendation of potential eligibility for listing
in the National Register of Historic P laces for
4 1BW61 5, 4 1BW622, and 41BW624 recognizes that
these sites may produce d ata important to the
understanding of settlement, subsistence, and inter- or
intraregional interaction during prehistory. These sites
merit formal testing to allow a further assessment of
their capacity to yield such data Information on the
isolability of components, site age, the presence or
absence of features, the range of artifacts present, and
the presence or absence of fauna] and macrobotanical
remains are the primary kinds of information needed
for such an assessment.

HISTORIC SITES
Ten new and 26 reevaluated h istoric sites are
assessed here by the application of National Register
Criteria A, B , and D, and National Register Criteria
Consideration D. The application of these criteria
assesses the relation of these sites to broad patterns of
history, their association with significant individuals,
and their ability to yield archeologieal infonnation
important in history. Contextual integrity is extremely
important in these assessments, as many sites have been
badly d isturbed by bulldozing during the construction
of installation facilities or by ongoing projects since the
land was acquired by the U.S. government. Thus, sites

41BW387,41BW388,41BW390,41BW609,41BW610,
41BW61 l, and 41BW613. Four other historic sites41BW612, 41BW614, 41BW617, and 41BW620-are
considered ineligible for reasons other than Jack Â·of
integrity. Site 4 1BW612 has evidence of possible
features, but so few artifacts were recovered from shovel
tests that it appears to have a limited potential to yield
important infonnation. Site 4 lB W6 l 4 appears ineligible
because it consists of two isolated features, apparently
without associated artifacts, and may be related to
livestock watering rather than domestic activities. Site
41BW617, a cemetery containing a single grave,
appears to be ineligible because the individual buried
there (Willis Langford) is not of transcendent importance
and because the cemetery is not especially old, does
not have distinctive design features, and is not associated
with important historic events. Similarly, the Till
Cemetery (41BW620), while used as early as 1882, does
not date to the community's original, pre-Civil War,
period of settlement (National Park Service 1991 :2, 35).
Sites considered potentially eligible are 4IBW334,
41BW338,41BW340,41BW365,41BW381,41BW612,
41BW616, and 41BW618.
In tenns of Criteria A and B, the potentially eligible
sites can be grouped under the broad pattern of history
that deals with the development of a late-nineteenth and
early-twentieth-century farming community in the region
and the prominent individuals associated with that
community. This community included Euro-American
and African-American small landowners, tenant farmers,
and a few large landowners. The community had its
inception in the mid-nineteenth century and was a focus
of economic and social activity in the region before that
focus shifted to Texarkana. The Old Boston Road, the
main thoroughfare between the town of Boston and
southwestern Arkansas, winds its way through the
southern half of RRAD/LSAAP and appears to have
been al the center of this community. Many of the
historic sites occur along this road or on nearby land,
suggesting that lhe residents interacted closely. The
community had a post office, stores, churches, and
cemeteries and was localed along lhe part of Old Boston
Road lhat passes through Survey Area 4 at LSAAP.

Some of. the residents of this community also were
~ngaged i_n county a~d state activities as well as having
ml terests m economic and industrial development and
t 1e advancement of technology.

In all, 17 historic sites in Survey Area 4 are adjacent
or cl~s~ ~o Old Boston Road, and another 14 sites are in
the v1~m1~. Tho~gh most arc disturbed, 6 sites may have
sufficient mtegnty to provide important information on
material culture and lifcways during the middle to late
nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. All 6 sites
(41BW334, 41BW338, 41BW340, 41BW365, 41BW381,
and 4IBW618) are the farmsteads of Euro-American
small landowners, with some perhaps having seen tenant
occupations late in their histories. Missing from the
sample of sites with integrity are house sites associated
with Euro-American large landowners and farmsteads
associated with African-Americans. Notable examples
of these two kinds of sites at LSAAP include 41BW322
(possibly the Moores plantation house, located outside
the area surveyed during this project) and 4 lBW379
(the Payton Payton farmstead, located within Survey
Area 4 but extensively disturbed).
The earliest of these six farmsteads may be
41BW338, which could have been occupied by David
Jarrett as early as 1843 and probably was used by his
descendants through the early twentieth century. Jarrett
was a locally prominent individual, serving as the Bowie
County sheriff from 1849 to 1853. Site 41BW338,
though partially disturbed, may contain a subsurface
brick feature and produced some early artifacts
suggesting a mid-nineteenth-century occupation. It is
recommended that it be considered potentially eligible
for the National Register under Criteria A, B, and D.
Four of the farmsteads appear to have been
occupied initially in the 1870s-1880s. One is considered
potentially eligible for the National Register under
Criteria A, B, and D. Site 41BW365 is the LangfordVan Pelt farmstead (1872-ca. 1900, with occupations
by subsequent owners probably extending to 1941).
Willis W. Langford bought l 00 acres in 1872. Sometime
before 1880, Langford's widow, Lenetta, married John
King Van Pelt. Van Pelt was an inventor whose several
registered patents could have had their inception at this
site. Site 4 LBW365 is marked by features (i.e., a well/
cistern and a large depression) and a surface artifact
scatter, and it is one of the few historic sites at LSAAP
that shows no evidence of bulldozing.
The other three sites dating to the 1870s-1880s
(4IBW340, 4 1BW381, and 41BW618) appear not to
have been associated with prominent persons, and they
are considered potentially eligible for National Register
listing under Criteria A and D. Site 4LBW340 is the
Kenney fannstead, possibly occupied between 1876 and
123

Red Rfrrr A1111y /)cpot and Ltmc Steir J\n11y /\1111111111itio11 l'la11t
1922. fames Kenney wa:; the son of Virginia King and
stepsnn of John King. who deeded the fam1stc:ul to
Kenney out of their original homestead tract. The site
contains several features (i.e., pier stones and three
depressions that could be fi lled cisterns or privies). as
well as a surface scatter of artifacts and moderate
densities of subsurface artifacts. Site 41 BW38 I is a
fannstcad associated with the Eli Boone family as early
as the 1880s. ll1c identified features consist of a possible
cistern and a possible hearth/chimney base, and the site
contains both surface and subsurface arti facts. Site
41BW6 I8 was associated w ith second- or th irdgeneration members of the Jarrett family. It contains
two hearth/chimney foun dations, a cistern, pier stones,
a rectangular depression, and surface and subsurface
artifacts, and it is one of the best-preserved historic sites
at LSAAP.
The final farmstead (41BW334) appears lo have
been occupied initially around the tum of the century;
it is considered potentially eligible for the National
Register under Criteria A and D. Site 41BW334 was
associated with the Harry E. Presley family and was
probably the location of their farmstead between 1895
and the 1930s. It contains features (i.e., a well/cistern,
brick concentration, and a small concrete foundation)
and subsurface artifacts.
TI1e final site discussed here is a cemetery. Site
41BW6 l 6, the Piney Grove Cemetery, also located near
the Old Boston Road, is assessed here as potentially
eligible for listing in the National Register because "it
embodies the folkways, burial customs, or artistic
traditions of an ethnic or cultural group whose impact
on the community or region was significant but is not
well documen ted in other resources" (Potter and Boland
1992: I 7). Indeed, this cemetery is the most visible
evidence of an African-American presence on LSAAP,
thus fulfilling the requirements of Criteria Consideration

D.
The seven sites listed above (and 4 LBW6 17 and
41BW620, which are not National Register-eligible but
are cemeteries) should be protected from disturbance,
and it is recommended that the six fannstead sites be
subjected to formal testing to allow a fuller assessment
of their importance. Formal testing should address the
issues of integrity, age, the kinds and numbers of features
present, and the nature of the artifact assemblages. In
addition, a historic context exploring the development
of the agricultural community along the Old Boston

Road during the last half of the nineteenth cent
ury and
the first four <lccades of the twe ntieth century should be
developed.

SUMMARY
Forty-two archeological sites were recorded

Depot and 35 ut the Lone Star Army Ammunition Pl Y
an1.
. .
Six of these have on Iy pre htslonc components, 34 have
only historic components, and 2 have both prehistoric
and hi s to ri c components. O ne site at RRAD i
considered to be potentially eligible for listing on th~
National Register of Historic Places. It is a prehistoric
site (4 1BW622) that may be able to contribute important
information concerning settlement strategies and other
topics. It is recommended that the other 6 sites at RRAD
be considered ineligible for National Register listing.
Nine of the sites at LSAAP are considered to be
potentially eligible for listing in the National Register
of Historic Places. Two of these are prehistoric sites
(4 1BW619 and 41 BW624) that may have the capacity
to yield data important for understanding Native American use of the uplands between the Red and Sulphur
River valleys. Six are farmsteads associated with EuroAmerican landowners during the middle to late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries (41BW334,
41BW338, 41BW340, 41BW365, 41BW381 , and
41BW6 l 8). They may be able to yield important data
abou t the development of the agricultural community
centered along the Old Boston Road. The final site
(4 1BW616) is the only known historic cemetery to be
associated w ith the African-American landowners who
were an important part of the community during the late
nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. The remaining 26 sites at LSAAP are considered ineligible for
National Register listing.
This project also involved an effort to re-locate and
mark 52 previously recorded sites that are outside the
s urvey areas but within areas that are scheduled for timbering in the near future. This was intended to help prevent disturbance of these sites which are potentially
National Register eligible or ~f unknown eligibility.
Seven of these (4 1BW451 at RRAD and 41BW327.
41BW352, 41 BW370, 4 1BW371, 41BW383. an:
4 1BW427 at LSAAP) appear to have been sodisturbe
. Â· Â· the
that they are assessed here as ineligible for I1sung.
assessments for the other 45 sites remain unchanged.

Dear Mr. Prewitt:
We are have received a letter from the Texas Historical Commission dated
March 20, 1998, (Enclosure), regarding their review of the referenced report. This
report was produced by your office in partial fulfillment of Delivery Order 0011
of Contract Number DACA63-95-D-0051 for an archeological survey of
approximately 4,433 acres on Red River Army Depot and Lone Star Anny
Ammunition Plant (RRAD/LSAAP) lands.
The Texas Historical Commission (THC) has commented that they are in
disagreement with some of your recommendations for National Register of
Historic Places (NRHP) eligibility, specifically the recommendations of eligibility
for archeological sites 4 1BW365, 38 1, 616, 618 , 619, and 622. In consultation
with the staff at RRAD/LSAAP we are in agreement with the review and
comments provided by the THC, particularly with the NRHP ineligibility of the
cemetery site, 41BW616, per our previous comments. The THC has concurred
with your suggestion ofNRHP eligibility for archeological sites 4 lBW334, 338,
340, and 624, and we are in agreement with that recommendation.
This correspondence serves as your notice to proceed with the production of
the final deliverables for this project. Correct the recommendations and
conclusions as found in the report to reflect the above comments. We look
forward to receiving the final fifty (50) documents with the accompanying

(2)

of work for this deliverable to detennine any additional requirements.

Re:

Draft Report: Archeologica/ Survey of 1,794 Hectares at the Red River Army Depot n11d
Lone Star Army Ammunition Plant, Bowie County, Texas.

(COE-FWD, F2, F16)
Dear Mr. Ensch:
Thank you for allowing us to review the above-referenced draft archeological survey report. In
general, we find the report to be well written. We concur with most of the conclusions presented
by the authors w ith respect to the potential National Register eligibility of the si tes recorded,
but disagree with the authors recommendations in six instances.
Specifically, we do not believe that sites 41BW622, 616, 618, 619, 365, or 381 have the
potential to shed light on matters important to prehistory or history. In the case of the cemetery
at site 41BW616, we do not believe that the fact that it is associated with a particular ethnic
group makes the cemetery any more significant than the other, similar cemeteries recorded.
Therefore, we consider these sites to be ineligible for inclusion in the National Register of
Historic Places.
Â·
We do concur with the remainder of the authors eligibility recommendations. Specifically, we
concur that the following sites should be protected from disturbance or be tested to complete
their evaluation: 41BW334, 338, 340, an d 624. We also concur that the following sites are too
dish.trbed, or contain too little data, to contribute information important to history or
prehistory: 41BW217, 293, 609, 620, 621, 623, 177, 332, 333, 335, 336, 339, 341, 346, 347, 361,
362, 363, 364, 366, 367, 379, 387, 388, 390, 610, 611, 612, 613, 614, 615, and 617.
If we may be of further assistance, please contact Bill Martin at 512/463-5867.

Sincerely,
