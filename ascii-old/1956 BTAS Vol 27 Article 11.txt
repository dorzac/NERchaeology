1. All volumes of this Bulletin now cost $5.00 each, except Volume

25, which costs $7.50. Prices include postage. Volumes 1 to 21 had
previously sold for $3.00 each.
2. Any m ember who obtains three new members in one year will
receive, as a gift, a volume of the Bulletin which is to be chosen
by the Secretary-Treasurer. Another volume will be given for
every three additional new members.
3. In addition to Active Memberships (which include library subscriptions), the Society now offers Contributing Annual Member-·
ships at $25.00 and Life Memberships at $100.00.

1Jinr.rwnr1l
The society was organized and chartered in
pursuit of a literary and scientific undertaking;
for the study of the history, pre-history and the
major artifacts of man and the fossils representing the past floras and faunas of Texas; for the
encouragement of the proper collection and preservation of such artifacts and fossils in museums
and their study and classification and the publication of the results of the researches incident
thereto.
The

BuLLETIN

is published annually for dis-

tribution to members of the society.

AN ARTIFACT FROM THE HIGH TERRACE
OF RED RIVER
ADOLPH HENRY WITTE

The writer has long :been interested in the archeological
problems of the Upper Red River drainage area. From time
to time gravel and sand quarries have been visited. Vertebrate fossils have been noted and archeological items sear~h­
ed for. Frank Morris has watched several quarries and assisted in Jefferson County, Oklahoma.
Following a brief description of Upper Red River geology,
the artifact shown in Plate 27 will be described.
Red River is one of 't he major streams of Texas and Oklahoma, with a drainage area in Texas alone of over 30,000
square miles. The river is formed in the southeastern corner
of the Texas Panhandle by the union of several headwater
streams. Prairie Dog Town Fork, considered the main one,
rises in the western part of Deaf Smith County, where an
elevation of 4,000 feet above sea level is found, but the watershed extends farther west into New Mexico. Pa.Io Duro
Canyon was formed by this stream in its descent from the
Texas High Plains.
Recent, Cenozoic, and Late Paleozoic geologkal formations are exposed along Upper Red River valley. In t'he
vi·c inity of Spanish Fort in Montague County, sands of
Trinity age appear, and limestones of the Lower Cretaceous
cap the escarpments. Cherts of Pennsylvanian age are exposed along the Spanish Fort high.
In keeping with Texas rivers in general, stream deposits
are found along Red River at various elevations above the
floodplain. Erosion apparently has removed most of the
oldest and highest terrace material. Thin stratified gravel
beds, ca~pping the hills, are common along tihe valley edges.
In northern Clay County and about 20 miles upstream
from Terral, Oklahoma, a specta,c ular series of uneroded
terraces can be observed. Follow the Byers, Texas, highway in the direction of Waurika, Oklahoma. Here on the

An Artifact From the High Terrace of Red River

213

south side of Red River three stream terraces descend like
steps to the present floodplain. The upper terrace is 0.9
mile in width; the middle is by far the widest, 2.6 miles;
and tlhe lower one is 0.4 mile in width. Next is the floodplain, almost a mile in width. 'I'he sand-choked fill of this
inner valley extends to an unknown depth below the present
channel. This series of perfect terraces correlates very
closely with similar deposits in the vicinity of Terral,
Oklahoma, and elsewhere within Red River valley.
Thick aeolian deposits are wideSipread along Red River.
Dune fields, miles back from the river, are well anchored
by timber. Where cultivation has been attempted these
dormant dunes actually do not remain inactive long. East
of Terral, the lower, middle, and high terrace benches are
obscured by extensive dune topography.
As the need has arisen, gravel and sand quarries have
been opened and exploited in a considerable number of
places in the valley. Vertebrate fos,s ils of Pleistocene age
have been reported and the writer has investigated the
following: mammoth remains from the middle terrace at
Doan's Crossing in Wilbarger County, Texas; complete
lower jaw bones of a mammoth from the middle terrace
near Burkiburnett, Texas; mammoth molars f:mm the upper
terrace near Charlie, Texas; and a pair of large tusks from
the Douthitt ranch in Clay County, Texas. The last-mentioned site is in a high spot overlooking the Red River
valley and appears to be a remnant of the high terrace.
Large scraps of mammoth bone and complete teeth of fossil
horse have come from a pit near the Irving High School in
Jefferson County, Oklahoma.
THE TERRAL A:RTIFACT
Four miles east of Terral, Oklahoma, gravel deposits on
the L. C. McGinnis ranch have recently been exploited. A
small, well-intrenched stream cuts across the north rim of
the valley and descends to Red River, 3 miles away. In the
late 1860's and after, this spring-fed creek was a well known
watering and camping stop on the Chisholm Trail. On the

east side of this stream, stratified gravels have been quarried for a distance of % mile or more. The gravels rest on
beds of Permian sandstone and are covered by a sandy
stratum of soil that averages up to 6 feet in thickness. The
gravel beds also vary in thickness. To utilize the gravel,
the usual procedure is to strip the sandy overburden with
power machinery. The gravel is then loaded into dump
trucks by power lift.
On about January 15, 1956, C. C. Veal and Frank Morris,
both of Ryan, Oklahoma, were loading gravel in the McGinnis pit. Mr. Veal observed an unusual stone in the bottom of the excavation, in direct contact with the Permian
sandstone. He drew Mr. Morris' attention to the find. Veal
presented the artifact to Morris, and later it passed to the
writer.
From Morris we have the following data: The overburden
of soil removed from this spot was estimated at not less than
6 feet thick. The gravel stratum was also estimated at approximately 6 feet in thickness. Thus a total of 12 feet of
gravel and sand was deposited over the artifact.
The artifact (Plate 27, A, B) is double-grooved and of
light brown quartzite. 'I1his is a common artifact material
all over North Texas. This unusual stone is flattish, irregular, roughly oval in outline, and its dimensions are 2V2
by 3 inches. The shaping was done by pecking, a common
technique of prehistoric Indians for fashioning celts, boatstones, mauls, netsinkers, etc. The use of this particular
object, however, is unknown.
CONCLUSIONS
The McGinnis gravel pit definitely seems to be a remnant of the high terrace system of Red River. Until good
vertebrate fossil materials are discovered in the deposit, age
determination will have to wait. Interested archeologists
are urged to visit the site and observe the geological section
exposed in the cut banks.
