Archeological Investigations at the Lang Pasture Site (41AN38) in the Upper Neches River Basin of East Texas
Texas Department of Transportation

ABSTRACT AND MANAGEMENT SUMMARY
Archeological testing at the Lang Pasture
site (41AN38) and nearby Site 41AN159,
was carried out in 2004 by a team of
archeologists from Coastal Environments,
Inc. and Archeological & Environmental
Consultants, LLC, working under Texas
Antiquities Permit No. 3333. Based on
these efforts, it was determined that the
Lang Pasture site had considerable research
potential, as it contained remains of
prehistoric Caddo domestic habitation and
associated burial features. 41AN159 was
found to have been seriously disturbed by
historic agricultural activities, and to thus
have no significant research potential. Data
recovery investigations were recommended
for the Lang Pasture Site in anticipation of
planned widening of State Highway 155,
within the right-of-way of which a
significant portion of the site was located.
The data recovery work sponsored by the
Texas Department of Transportation and
completed in 2006 by a team from Coastal
Environments, Inc. and Archeological &
Environmental Consultants, LLC at the
Lang Pasture site (41AN38) was carried out
under Texas Antiquities Permit No. 4040.
This work obtained a wealth of new
archeological,
bioarchaeological,
and
paleoenvironmental information about the
lives and practices of prehistoric ancestors
of the Caddo Indian peoples. This multi­
disciplinary work has cast a new light on the
character and pace of native history of the
Caddo in the East Texas region.
The data recovery investigations have been
particularly important in advancing the field
of Caddo archeology in several different
respects: (1) work completed in 14th to early
15th century A.D. domestic habitation
contexts resulted in the identification of a
well-defined series of features from
prehistoric Caddo houses, specialized
structures (i.e., granaries or ramadas/arbors),
and ancillary outdoor activity areas, such

Technical Report No. 174202

that the character of a rural domestic Caddo
household in much of East Texas (or at least
the Neches-Angelina River basins) has come
into better focus; (2) the exposure and
excavation of a Caddo family cemetery—
and the attempt to determine the regional
context for changes in Caddo diet and
health—has contributed to an understanding
of the bioarcheological character of the
Caddo people in the upper Neches River
basin that is unparalleled anywhere in the
larger Caddo archeological area. The
bioarcheological information on diet, health,
and pathologies obtained during the course
of the Lang Pasture site work provides a
sweeping view of more than 800 years of
Caddo life that will be relevant to
understanding different Caddo peoples and
groups in other parts of the Caddo world; (3)
the Lang Pasture archeological and
bioarcheological investigations were done in
consultation with the Caddo Nation of
Oklahoma. That consultation has allowed
the Caddo peoples to keep abreast of the
bioarcheological approach and findings, and
to provide their perspectives on the meaning
of the findings from these investigations.
This is a first for the field of Caddo
archeology, and it is a step in the right
direction of making room for the Caddo
peoples to be full partners in future Caddo
archeological
and
bioarcheological
investigations in their traditional homelands.
Robert Cast and Bobby Gonzalez of the
Caddo Nation have offered their impressions
of this work and of the overall project, and
these are included in the final chapter of this
report; and (4) finally, the identification of
the family cemetery at the Lang Pasture
site—as well as the associated funerary
offerings placed in each of the graves—
allowed for the regional consideration of
Caddo mortuary practices based on a study
of a number of upper Neches River basin
Caddo cemeteries. Additionally, the study of
the style, manufacture, and function of

i

Abstract and Management Summary

mortuary ceramic vessels in the region
permitted the first examination of issues of
style and stylistic change, social identity,
and changes in culinary traditions as
possible manifestations of changes in
ceramic practice that occurred among Caddo
groups living in the upper Neches River
valley of East Texas between the 14th to 17th
centuries A.D. The mortuary ceramics from
upper Neches River basin Caddo sites
illustrate broad continuities in ceramic
practice, particularly in terms of vessel
decoration and vessel form, but also
demonstrate patterns in technical choices
that are very different than what is
documented in domestic Caddo ceramic
assemblages of the same age and made by
the same social group of potters. The
ceramic-practice data from both domestic
and mortuary contexts has been employed to
posit the existence of a distinctive upper
Neches
Caddo
ceramic
tradition.

A report on archeological testing at nearby
Site 41AN159 is included as an appendix to
this report. The senior author of this report,
Jon C. Lohse, served as Project
Archeologist, and Robert Ricklis and
Timothy Perttula were Co-Principal
Investigators.
The non-mortuary portion of the collection
from 41AN38, as well as artifacts recovered
during testing at nearby 41AN159, along
with associated field and laboratory records,
are permanently curated at the Texas
Archeological Research Laboratory, The
University of Texas at Austin. Human
remains from burials, and associated
funerary offerings, are being repatriated to
the Caddo Nation of Oklahoma (Binger,
Oklahoma).

ACKNOWLEDGMENTS
The data recovery work at the Lang Pasture
site was carried out by Coastal
Environments, Inc (CEI) under a contract
with
the
Texas
Department
of
Transportation (TxDOT). Archeological &
Environmental Consultants, LLC (AEC)
teamed with CEI as a subcontractor, and
played a crucial role in both the field work
and subsequent analyses. The CEI team was
under the overall supervision of David
Kelley, and the field work was directed by
Jennifer Kelly. CEI field crew members
were Bruce M. Albert, Lindsay Flood, and
David Teague. Timothy K. Perttula led the
AEC team, and Bo Nelson, Mark Walters,
Anthony Clay Newton, and Chris Kugler of
AEC participated in the field work. Phil
Dering and Diane Wilson provided their
expertise in the analysis of the plant remains
and human remains recovered from the Lang
Pasture site. Laboratory work was carried
out at CEI’s Corpus Christi office by
Jennifer Kelly and Madeleine-Sophie
Ricklis. Laura Nightengale and Dr. Darrell
Creel at Texas Archeological Research
Laboratory, The University of Texas at
Austin, went out of their way to facilitate
our analysis of vessel, vessel sherd, and pipe
sherds in their collection from upper Neches
River basin Caddo sites. They made office
space available to us for collectiondocumentation efforts, and office space to
Diane Wilson for her analysis of the remains
from Lang Pasture as well as a suite of
Caddo sites in the upper Neches in their
burial collections.
Dr. James Abbott, Dr, Scott Pletka, Dr.
Nancy Kenmotsu,, Dr. Lain Ellis, Dr. Owen
Lindauer, Waldo Troell, Dennis Price, and
Jay Tullos (Tyler District) served as liaisons

between TxDOT and the archeological
contractors throughout the duration of the
project, and their role as facilitators is much
appreciated. Dr. Abbott also coordinated
with TRC in providing draft chapters of the
report for editing and formatting, and in
making the collections from t\he site
available for TRC’s use in addressing
several questions that arose in our readings
of the draft chapters, and for making a
number of additional artifact photographs
for inclusion in the text.
The Caddo Nation of Oklahoma, as the
descendants of the people who lived at the
Lang Pasture site and in the surrounding
region of East Texas, were involved in this
project from the beginning. Representatives
of the Cultural Preservation Department at
the Nation, Robert Cast and Bobby
Gonzalez, have contributed a set of
comments on their impressions of the
project for the Caddo Nation that are
included in the final chapter of this report.
Their participation and input is very much
valued and appreciated. We also want to
thank them for their consultation efforts
regarding the excavation and treatment of
the burial features from the site.

CHAPTER 1
1INTRODUCTION
Timothy K. Perttula and David B. Kelley
This report summarizes the archeological
findings from 2006 data recovery excavations
at the Lang Pasture (41AN38) site along the
State Highway (SH) 155 right-of-way in
Anderson County, Texas (Figure 1-1). This
work
was
performed
by
Coastal
Environments, Inc. and Archeological &
Environmental Consultants, LLC, under
contract to the Texas Department of
Transportation (TxDOT). David B. Kelley
(Coastal Environments, Inc.) served as
Principle Investigator during the data recovery
work. TxDOT proposes to expand SH 155
from two to four lanes, and this expansion will
destroy that portion of the Lang Pasture site
that exists in the right-of-way.

Nation of
Oklahoma, headquartered at
Binger, Oklahoma.

The data recovery excavations were extensive,
and resulted in the discovery and
documentation
of
numerous
features,
including habitation deposits, and burial
features in a small cemetery, from prehistoric
Caddo occupations preserved in the right-of­
way (Figures 1-2 and 1-3). The site itself is
much larger than the existing right-of-way (cf.
Perttula et al. 2007), and it is clear that the
Lang Pasture site has a spatially substantial
prehistoric Caddo habitation area. The
excavations also documented Archaic and
Woodland period archeological remains here.

State Highway 155 consists of four lanes from
the City of Tyler, south to the Henderson
County Line and from FM 2267 to the City of
Palestine. This project will aid in moving
traffic more safely from FM 19 in Frankston
through FM 2267 in Pert. State Highway 155
has been completed to widen from a two-lane
to a four-lane from the Henderson County
Line to FM 19.

The non-mortuary artifacts and ecofacts from
the Lang Pasture site and 41AN159 are
curated at the Texas Archeological Research
Laboratory, The University of Texas at
Austin. Mortuary material (human remains
and
associated/unassociated
funerary
offerings) are to be repatriated to the Caddo

THE HIGHWAY MODIFICATION
PROJECT

This highway modification project is located
in northeastern Anderson County, south of
Frankston to Pert. The project limits are from
FM 19 in Frankston to FM 2267 in Pert. The
project area is nine miles in length. The
highway improvements will follow the
existing alignment.
The project will
reconstruct the existing two-lane roadway
without shoulders as a four-lane divided road
highway with a depressed median.

The typical proposed SH section is to consist
of four travel lanes with a depressed median.
The four travel lanes will be 12 feet each with
two inside shoulders four feet each and two
outside shoulders 10 feet each.
The
crossovers will each be 40 feet wide and the
depressed median will be 76 feet wide. At
each crossover there will be a left turn lane
that will be 12 feet in width. A total of
149.729 acres of right-of-way were purchased
from the mid- to late 1970s through 1981.

development of this four-lane divided highway
will impact 164.22 acres.
Previous Investigations at 41AN38
The Lang Pasture site was originally recorded
by TXDOT archeologists in 1983 during
shovel testing of the SH 155 right-of-way
(Campbell 2003:53). The site covered an
upland ridge and toe slope about 200 m from
Caney Branch, a small tributary to Caddo
Creek, itself a tributary to the Neches River.
The Neches River lies ca. 8 km to the east of
the site.
Hicks & Company, Inc. archeologists returned
to the site during more comprehensive survey

Technical Report No. 174202

investigations of the SH 155 right-of-way in
early 2003, and excavated eight shovel tests
along the right-of-way, documenting that the
Lang Pasture archeological deposits covered
ca. 800 m2 on the western side of SH 155
(Campbell 2003:Figure 6.16). These shovel
tests contained Caddo ceramic sherds, lithic
debris, and a piece of fire-cracked rock. A
possible post hole feature, with flecks or
charcoal and oxidized soil, was identified
between 47-53 cm bs in one of the shovel tests
(Campbell 2003:56 and Figure 6.17).
Campbell (2003:57) concluded that the Lang
Pasture site was a prehistoric Caddo habitation
site with the “potential to contain significant
intact subsurface deposits within the right of
way.”

Excavations.

Furthermore,
Campbell
(2003:57)
recommended that the site be evaluated
through test excavations to determine if it
contains significant archeological deposits that
would warrant inclusion in the National
Register of Historic Places.
In January and February 2004, Coastal
Environments, Inc. returned to the Lang
Pasture site to complete archeological test
excavations since TxDOT had determined that
it could not avoid or protect the site within the
SH 155 expanded right-of-way. During that
work, an additional 20 shovel tests were
excavated at the site, along with 14 m2 of

Technical Report No. 174202

hand-excavated units, and four small scrape
areas were excavated using a box blade
mounted on a tractor (Figure 1-4, see Lohse
2004:Figure 2.7).
Intact prehistoric Caddo archeological
deposits about 30 cm in average thickness
(Lohse 2004:25) were recognized over a ca.
400 m2 area of the existing SH 155 right-of­
way. There were moderate densities of
ceramic sherds (36 per m2) and lithic debris
(35 per m2), with lesser amounts of chipped
and ground stone tools (0.7 per m2, primarily
consisting of arrow point fragments) and clay
pipe sherds (0.2 per m2).

These deposits included several post hole and
pit features in a hand-excavated block in one
part of the site that appeared to be related to at
least one Caddo structure (Lohse 2004:Table
3.2). Although the pattern of post holes did not
show a clear outline in the small block
excavation, the association of post and small
pit features, as well as the highest densities of
artifacts on the site, suggest that the post and
pit features are part of a domestic structure in
this area. A single extended burial with
associated funerary objects was found about
25 m from the concentration of post holes and
pits.
The domestic habitation features were
generally exposed between ca. 30-50 cm bs,
and were marked by darker sediments (with
charcoal flecking) that contrasted with the
yellowish-brown E-horizon sediments into
which they had been dug. Charred plant
remains were preserved (i.e., mainly wood
charcoal and hickory nutshell, but other plant
taxa as well), but animal bone was absent
(Lohse 2004:61).
The one Caddo burial was that of an adult (sex
or age undetermined, as the human remains
had not been studied by a bioarcheologist at
that time) in supine position with the head at
the eastern end of the grave, facing west.
According to Lohse (2004:22): “[b]one
preservation was very poor, and only certain
elements remained. These included pieces of
long bones, patella fragments, and cranial
material.” Associated funerary objects
included seven ceramic vessels (Lohse
2004:Figures 3.16 to 3.22) and an elbow pipe.
Three of the vessels were decorated: a Poynor
Engraved carinated bowl, a Maydelle Incised
jar, and a red-slipped carinated bowl. The
Poynor Engraved and Maydelle Incised
vessels are commonly recovered on Frankston
phase sites, and Poynor Engraved is the
principal fine ware found on Late Caddo (ca.
A.D. 1400 and after) sites in the upper Neches
River basin (see Anderson et al. 1974;
Gilmore 1983). The other four vessels were
plain, among them a small bottle, a bowl with
a thickened and scalloped rim/lip, and two

Technical Report No. 174202

carinated bowls. The pipe had an L-shaped
angle between the bowl and the stem (Lohse
2004:Figure 3.23), a form more often seen in
ca. A.D. 1350-1450 Caddo sites in the region
(see Rogers and Perttula 2004) than the typical
V-shaped elbow pipes found in post-A.D.
1450 Frankston phase sites.
One radiocarbon sample was obtained on
charred hickory nutshells from a pit feature
(Feature 2). It returned a 2-sigma calibrated
age range of A.D. 1030-1290 (Lohse 2004:
Table 3.9). A second radiocarbon date was
also obtained on a charred organic residue
sample from the exterior surface of the
Maydelle Incised jar in the burial feature. This
sample yielded a 2-sigma calibrated age range
of AD 780-1000 (UGA 14841). Finally, a
modern calibrated age (A.D. 1650-1960) was
obtained on a sample of wood charcoal from
Feature 1 (a post hole), and the wood charcoal
in the radiocarbon sample appears to have
been intrusive into the post hole. Since none of
the dates overlapped at 2 sigma, one
possibility suggested by the radiocarbon
samples was that the Lang Pasture site was
occupied on more than one occasion by Caddo
peoples, first in the Formative Caddo period
(ca. A.D. 800-1000), then in the Early Caddo
period (ca. A.D. 1000-1200) and the initial
part of the Middle Caddo period (ca. A.D.
1200-1400), and then perhaps sometime after
A.D. 1650. This scenario now seems unlikely
(see Chapter 5, discussion of C14 dates),
although the radiocarbon dates (except the one
dating to modern times) cannot be excluded
out of hand, particularly given the abysmal
state of radiocarbon dating of prehistoric
Caddo sites in the upper Neches River basin,
but their interpretation must be based on the
range of diagnostic artifacts (primarily
decorated ceramic sherds and vessels)
considered to be associated with the feature
being dated.
A column of Oxidizable Carbon Ratio (OCR)
dates was also obtained from the block of
hand-excavated units (N179 E200, west wall)
in the domestic area of the site. The OCR
dates on pedogenic events in the column
suggested that the Caddo occupation at the

7

Chapter 1: Introduction

Lang Pasture site began as early as ca. A.D.
1300-1336 and ended ca. A.D. 1365-1400.
Within that span of time, the occupation may
have lasted as little as 30 years to as much as
100 years. The OCR dates are several hundred
years later than two of the calibrated
radiocarbon dates from the Lang Pasture site,
and it was considered possible that they
related not to the age of the Caddo occupation,
but to a time of pedogenic instability post­
dating the occupation itself.
Finally, the initial analysis of the decorated
ceramic sherds, the elbow pipe, and the
vessels from the burial at the Lang Pasture site
suggested that the Caddo occupation took
place during the earlier part of the Frankston
phase, probably between ca. A.D. 1400-1450.
The “ceramics from habitation and mortuary
contexts are from a single prehistoric Caddo
component” (Perttula 2004a:42). These
conclusions were based on the vessel seriation
proposed by Kleinschmidt (1982) for Late
Caddo cemeteries and habitation sites in the
upper Neches River valley, the distinctive and
temporally significant shape of the elbow pipe
(Perttula 2004a:44), and the provisional
seriation of decorated sherd assemblages from
nearby Lake Palestine Caddo sites, which
were acknowledged by Anderson et al. (1974;
see also Gilmore 1983) to have been occupied
during the Frankston phase (Perttula
2004a:Table 3.8).
Ricklis and Perttula (2004:61) concluded that
“an intact Caddo component containing
abundant artifacts and intact features is
traversed by the highway ROW at 41AN38.”
They also noted that the existence of
contemporaneous domestic and mortuary
areas (as assessed from decorated ceramic
similarities between the two) indicated that the
site retains evidence of the “synchronic use of
intra-site space,” meaning that archeological
information on prehistoric Caddo household
and community planning should be preserved
at the site. Finally, because the site contains
lithic and ceramic artifacts from what
appeared from all the available evidence to be
a single, isolable component, there is a “high
potential for investigating aspects of

8

technology and style that are directly relevant
to important research questions such as
cultural chronology (e.g., ceramic stylistic
change through time) and the technoeconomic dimensions of activities that were
carried out at a prehistoric Caddo settlement”
(Ricklis and Perttula 2004:62). Because of
these characteristics, as well as its contextual
integrity, the Lang Pasture site (41AN38) was
considered eligible for inclusion in the NRHP
under criterion D, and it also warranted
designation as a State Archeological
Landmark. Ricklis and Perttula (2004:62) also
recommended that “full data recovery efforts
be carried out at the site, unless avoidance is
possible during planned road construction.”

CONTENTS OF THE REPORT

Following this introductory chapter, Chapter 2
presents a summary of the environmental
setting—both modern and Holocene—for the
broader East Texas area as well as the upper
Neches River basin. Chapter 3 is a summary
of the Native American culture history in these
same regional and basin-specific locales
within East Texas. Chapter 4 is the final
version of the data recovery research design
developed and implemented for the work at
the Lang Pasture site.
Chapter 5 includes two main parts: (a) a
discussion of the stratigraphy of the
archeological deposits at the Lang Pasture site,
and (b) a detailed discussion of the character
of the domestic and burial features uncovered
during the data recovery excavations. This
chapter also contains a section that considers
the results of the radiocarbon analysis of
charred plant remain samples from domestic
feature contexts as well as radiocarbon dates
on preserved human remains from several of
the burial features. A more detailed
consideration of the Caddo burial features is
also presented in Chapter 11, as part of a
specific consideration of the character of
Upper Neches River basin Caddo mortuary
practices for the period between ca. A.D.
1300-1700.

Chapter 6 presents the detailed analysis of the
recovered ceramic artifacts from the Lang
Pasture site, including thousands of plain and
decorated sherds from utility ware and fine
ware vessels found in domestic contexts, as
well as a few pipe sherds and other
miscellaneous clay artifacts, along with the
ceramic vessels placed as funerary offerings in
the excavated burial features at the site. To
better understand the spatial, social, and
temporal context of the domestic and mortuary
ceramics from the Lang Pasture site, this
chapter also discusses and compares the kinds
of ceramics found in other generally
contemporaneous Caddo sites in the Upper
Neches River Basin, and defines a basinspecific pottery tradition.
The lithic artifacts from the Lang Pasture site
excavations are discussed in Chapter 7. The
focus of the lithic analysis is the diagnostic
artifacts found in the data recovery work—
especially the arrow points and dart points of
different types—to characterize the temporal,
functional, and technological characteristics of
the tool assemblages, as well as the analysis of
the lithic debitage from selected cultural
features.
Chapter 8 begins with the presentation of the
results of the analysis of the preserved plant
remains from cultural features at the Lang
Pasture site, these remains having primarily
been obtained through the flotation of feature
fill. The plant remains are dominated by
hickory nutshells, maize, and oak and pine
wood charcoal; the ubiquity of maize suggests
it was an important crop. The second part of
Chapter 8 discusses our current understanding
of the nature of prehistoric Caddo agriculture
in East Texas, and compares paleobotanical
findings from Woodland and prehistoric
Caddo sites in the region to the paleobotanical
assemblage from the Lang Pasture site.
The analysis of the poorly-preserved animal
bones from the Lang Pasture site data recovery
excavations are summarized in Chapter 9.
They provide only limited insights into Caddo
subsistence during the occupation, other than
that various mammals, especially white-tailed

Technical Report No. 174202

deer, were procured by Caddo hunters to
supplement the diet.
Diane E. Wilson summarizes the results of the
analysis of human remains from the burial
features at the Lang Pasture site in Chapter 10,
focusing on determinations of the age and sex
of the deceased individuals, skeletal
pathologies and evidence of infections,
evidence of nutritional stress, and the presence
and frequency of caries. Also discussed are the
results of stable carbon and nitrogen isotope
analysis of these burial features and the
implications
of
these
analyses
for
determinations of the Caddo diet at the time
the Lang Pasture site was occupied. This
information is enhanced by a broader
comparative discussion of the analysis of
human remains from a sample of Early Caddo
to Historic Caddo burial features in the Upper
Neches River Basin.
In Chapter 11, Timothy K. Perttula
summarizes the salient characteristics of
Caddo mortuary practices at the Lang Pasture
site. He also discusses available information
from other Caddo burials in the Upper Neches
region in order to place the Lang Pasture
findings within the regional context of Caddo
mortuary practices.
The concluding chapter (Chapter 12)
synthesizes
the
archeological
and
paleoenvironmental findings from the various
analyses that have been completed as part of
the study of the Lang Pasture site, particularly
in light of the research issues and problems
posed in the research design. This chapter also
includes a section by representatives of the
Caddo Nation of Oklahoma that provides their
perspective on the analyses of the human
remains from Caddo burials at the site.
There are also a number of appendices that
accompany the technical report. Appendix A,
by Bruce M. Albert, presents the palynological
and paleoenvironmental findings from three
cores taken along Caddo Creek in the vicinity
of the Lang Pasture site. Appendix B (Mark

CHAPTER 2
1ENVIRONMENTAL SETTING
Timothy K. Perttula
The Lang Pasture site (41AN38) is located in
the Pineywoods of East Texas, in the West
Gulf Coastal Plain, and in the Neches River
basin. It is situated on an upland ridge and toe
slope (ca. 390 feet amsl) about 200 m
northwest of Caney Branch. At the time of the
archeological data recovery investigations the
site area was primarily grass-covered, with
several small trees along the SH 155 right-of­
way fence (see Figure 1-3).
Within the broad region of the state that
encompasses East Texas, there are three main
biotic communities or physiographic zones:
the Oak Woods and Prairies or Post Oak
Savanna, the Blackland Prairie, and the
Pineywoods (Diamond et al. 1987; Schmidly
2002) or the Southeastern Deciduous and
Evergreen Forest (see Brown et al. 1998)
(Figure 2-1). The site is within the boundaries
of the modern Pineywoods, with the
easternmost extent of the Post Oak Savanna
cutting across the middle of Anderson County,
Texas, as well as the headwater areas of the
Neches River itself (see Figure 2-1), about 15
miles (25 km) from the site. The Blackland
Prairie is approximately 30-50 miles (48-80
km) west of the Lang Pasture site, well within
reach of Caddo hunters over a 2-3 day trek.
The Pineywoods cover large parts of East
Texas (Figure 2-1), have medium-tall to tall
broadleaf deciduous forests in more mesic
habitats, and shortleaf and loblolly pines are
common on upland fine sandy loam soils with

Technical Report No. 174202

adequate moisture. Small areas of tall grass
prairie may be present in both communities
throughout the region (e.g., Jordan
1981:Figure 4.1), and this may be particularly
the case in more xeric sandy lands.
Bottomland communities along the major river
and creek drainages contain a diverse
hardwood and swamp forest (including
cypress, tupelo, and sweet gum), with natural
levees and alluvial terraces, point bar deposits,
old stream channels, oxbow lakes, and
backwater swamps. A less diverse bottomland
hardwood community is present along the
smaller creeks and their tributaries. The Red,
Sulphur, Big Cypress, Sabine, Neches,
Angelina, and Trinity rivers flow east and
southeast through the Pineywoods (see Figure
2-1), but only the Angelina River and its
tributaries originate in the Pineywoods.
The Post Oak Savanna or Oak Woods and
Prairies is a narrow (60-80 km) southwestnortheast trending woodland belt that marks
an ecotone or natural transition zone between
the more xeric Blackland Prairie to the west
and the more mesic Pineywoods to the east
(see Figure 2-1). The Red, Sulphur, Big
Cypress, Sabine, Neches, and Trinity rivers
cut through the Post Oak Savanna, with the
Big Cypress and Neches stream basins
originating in this physiographic zone. The
woodlands in the Post Oak Savanna consist of
medium-tall to tall broadleaf deciduous
forests, including several species of oak, as
well as hickory and pecan.

Texas Department of Transportation

The Blackland Prairie is a zone of tall grass
prairie, with little bluestem and Indiangrass,
along with a riparian deciduous forest of oak,
hickory, and other tree species, along major
streams (such as the Trinity and Sulphur
rivers) and their tributaries. The headwaters of
the Sulphur, Sabine, and Trinity rivers
originate in the Blackland Prairie (see Figure
2-1).
The climate of the East Texas region is humid,
with a mean annual precipitation in modern
times of at least 100-125 cm across the region
as a whole; according to Coffee (1975:89),
mean precipitation in Anderson County in
modern times is ca. 102 cm a year. Periods of
maximum rainfall occur in the spring and fall
seasons. The growing season in Anderson
County is about 260 days, with the last freeze
occurring in March and the first freeze in late
November. Droughts are also not uncommon
in the modern era, and dendrochronological
analyses of tree rings for the last 1000 years
suggest there were numerous wet and dry
spells during that time (Stahle and Cleaveland
1994, 1995), including several lengthy
droughts.

oaks (post oak, red oak, blackjack oak,
bluejack oak, and chinquapin oak) and
hickory. Abundant nut mast would have been
available in these upland habitats on an annual
basis. On landforms with deep and welldrained loamy fine sand, such as more mesic
lower valley slopes, toe slopes, and elevated
alluvial landforms, the vegetational overstory
in mid-19th century times across the region
had red oak and post oak trees, along with
other hardwoods that tolerate periodic
flooding.
2.1

GEOLOGIC SETTING AND SOILS

East Texas is part of the Gulf Coastal Plain
physiographic province. The province is
comprised of Mesozoic and Cenozoic
sediments that filled the East Texas basin with
sediments of marine, delta, and river origins,
including sandstone and mudstone, along a
receding coastline. These deposits dip and
become progressively younger towards the
present Texas coastline.

Based on mid-19th century General Land
Office records from various parts of East
Texas, in the uplands in both the Pineywoods
and Post Oak Savannah, especially in settings
with very deep and well-drained sandy soils,
the overstory consisted of a mixture of pine
and oaks, including blue oak, blackjack oak,
post oak, and red oak. Some portion of these
landform-soils settings (probably with deep
sandy sediments) in the Pineywoods probably
also had pure stands of pine. In the eastern and
southern parts of the region, much of the
steeply sloping uplands in the Pineywoods had
pines or pine-oak overstories, as would
southern and steeper upland slopes. However,
northern and more gently sloping valley
landforms appear to have been dominated by
oaks.

Principal geologic formations from north to
south in East Texas include the Austin, Eagle
Ford, Woodbine, Navaroo, and Taylor groups
(Cretaceous period); Wilcox and Midway
groups (Paleocene period); Jackson and
Claiborne groups (Eocene period); the
Catahoula Formation (Oligocene period);
Fleming and Oakville formations (Miocene
period); and the Willis Formation (Pliocene
period). All the major streams and most of
their principal tributaries have Quaternary
alluvium (Bureau of Economic Geology
1992). The Eocene Queen City Sand, Sparta
Sand, and Weches formations (Bureau of
Economic Geology 1965) form the underlying
bedrock materials in the vicinity of the Lang
Pasture site). The Queen City Sand has thick
fine-grained quartz sand, beds of clay, lenses
of glauconite, and beds and concretions of
clay and ironstone (i.e., hematite and
ferruginous sandstone).

In upland settings with thinner sandy
sediments that are not as well-drained, the
overstory in both the Post Oak Savannah and
Pineywoods probably consisted of a variety of

These geologic formations in the Gulf Coastal
Plain are poor in lithic raw materials (Banks
1990:Figure 2.1). Only the Pisgah Ridge chert

glass in the Manning Formation (part of the
Jackson group of Eocene age), and various
cherts and quartzites in the Catahoula
Formation are in “geological formations that
contain in situ rocks suitable for the
manufacture of stone tools” (Banks 1990:49).
There are also upland stream gravels (or
Uvalde gravels) that are cobble to pebblesized that are relatively widely-spread in parts
of East Texas, especially in the Trinity and
Sulphur River basins (Banks 1990:56-57), and
to a limited extent in the Neches River basin
(see Anderson et al. 1974). However, high
quality and large knappable cobbles of chert,
novaculite, and quartzite are present in the
Red River gravels in the northeastern part of
East Texas, and these are derived from chertbearing formations in the Ouachita Mountains
of southeastern Oklahoma (Banks 1990:
Figure 1.20).
The diverse geological setting of East Texas is
matched by the diversity in soils found in the
region. Blackland Prairie clay soils are
confined to the Cretaceous Navarro, Taylor,
Austin, Eagle Ford, and Woodbine groups,
with their limestone and marl bedrocks. The
sandstones and mudstones that characterize
the Paleocene, Eocene, Oligocene, Miocene,
and Pliocene groups and associated formations
have led to the development of sandy and
sandy loam sediments (sometimes of
considerable thickness) across the remainder
of the region—including in uplands, alluvial
landforms, and floodplains—in the Post Oak
Savanna and Pineywoods. These sandy soils
are generally acidic in nature, and bone and
shell tend not to be well-preserved on
archeological sites in these regions; bone and
shell are poorly preserved at the Lang Pasture
site.
Erosion due to intensive cultivation practices
over the last 150 years in the Blackland Prairie
has led to the aggradation of black clay soils in
the floodplains of the Sulphur and Sabine
rivers, but otherwise sandy and sandy loam
deposits (including natural levees and point
bars) are characteristic of other East Texas
river and creek floodplains; back swamp areas
on the larger streams tend to have fine clay

14

sediments. Timber harvesting in the
Pineywoods and Post Oak Savannah over the
same time period has led to significant erosion
across much of the uplands, and the colluvial
deposition of sandy sediments along lower
upland slopes and in alluvial settings. Less
eroded areas in the uplands (depending upon
the parent material) may have sand deposits
more than 1-2 m in thickness.
The Caney Branch and Caddo Creek valleys
are moderately dissected, with 100-150 feet of
relief from the creek floodplain to the crest of
their sandy, gravelly, and/or rocky upland
landforms. The Caney Branch valley has a
narrow floodplain with alluvial deposits, but
the floodplain widens at its confluence with
Caddo Creek, a few miles to the northeast.
The broader floodplain of this Neches River
tributary also has a few small knolls or natural
rises in the floodplain. Water is also available
in several springs in the vicinity of the Lang
Pasture site.
Soils along the Caney Branch and Caddo
Creek valleys include fine sandy loam and
clayey soils along the floodplain and fine
sandy loam and loamy fine sandy loams in the
uplands (Coffee 1975). The area is part of the
sandy and loamy soils of the Fuquay-KirvinDarco association, which formed in the
interbedded sands and clays of the Queen City
Sand, and under a pine-hardwood forest.
The soils at the Lang Pasture site are classified
as Fuquay loamy fine sand, 3-8% slope. A
typical pedon of this soil is a ca. 76 cm thick
loamy fine sand A-horizon overlying a ca. 160
cm thick B-horizon sandy clay loam with
plinthite inclusions. The C-horizon includes
zones of sandy clay loam and clay (Coffee
1975:18-19). It is likely a desirable soil for
agricultural purposes, having deep sediments
that are easy to work with simple nonmechanized tools.
In general, other upland soils formed under a
pine-hardwood forest along Caney Branch and
Caddo Creek consist of fine sandy loam and
loamy fine sand sediments of varying
thickness (due in part to modern erosion, but

ranging from ca. 20 cm to more than 1 m in
thickness) overlying a red clay subsoil. These
range in slope from 0-20%. These upland soils
include the Darco-Kirvin-Tenaha soils, Elrose
fine sandy loam, 1-3% series, the Kirvin-Sacul
association, LaRue loamy fine sand, 1-3%,
Pelham loamy fine sand (formed under a
hardwood forest, probably post oak flats, see
Coffee 1975:33), Trawick fine sandy loam, 2­
8% and 8-20% slope, and Trawick-Bub soils.
In the floodplain of both Caney Branch and
Caddo Creek, the principal alluvial soil series
are Hannahatchee fine sandy loam, Thenas
fine sandy loam, and Robinsonville fine sandy
loam (Coffee 1975). In narrower floodplain
areas along tributary streams, these alluvial
soils are subject to occasional or frequent
overflows from flooding. The poorly drained
Nahatche clay loam occurs along the larger
Caddo Creek, but not along Caney Branch.
Several of the soils in the vicinity of the Lang
Pasture site likely had some potential for
prehistoric Caddo agricultural purposes,
although it is difficult to gauge which soils
these might have been because of the absence
of proxy measures of soil quality and
productivity for Caddo farmers as opposed to
modern intensive agriculturists (see discussion
in Rogers and Perttula 2004:9-10). As an
indication of the potential for soils for
prehistoric agricultural pursuits, the following
soils in the vicinity of the Lang Pasture appear
to be amenable for the cultivation of maize,
based on modern assessments of their
suitability for cultivation and their known
productivity in terms of corn production
(Coffee 1975:48-49 and Table 2): Fuquay
loamy fine sand; Darco fine sand; Elrose fine
sandy loam; LaRue loamy fine sand; and
Trawick fine sandy loam. Large tracts of land
to the immediate south and west of the Lang
Pasture site, on the west side of Caney Branch,
are mapped as having several of these soils,
especially the Fuquay, Elrose, LaRue, and
Trawick soil series (Coffee 1975: Sheet 11),
and Caddo fields may have been located there
during the Frankston phase occupation. The
fine sandy loam floodplain soils east of the
site may also have had agricultural fields, as

Technical Report No. 174202

they could be readily worked with hand tools,
and they are rich in organics. However, they
would have been subject to flooding during
the winter and early spring, limiting the
planting of crops, especially the first corn crop
(e.g., Swanton 1942:129).
2.2

HOLOCENE ENVIRONMENTAL
CHANGE

The climate in East Texas has changed
dramatically over time, which has affected the
biodiversity and carrying capacity of the
region. This in turn likely influenced the
adaptations of Native American groups that
lived in this broad region, especially as they
became more dependent upon cultivated plants
in what is a risky and occasionally droughtprone environment. A review of the
paleoenvironmental record is appropriate to
provide the context for the discussion of the
culture history of Native Americans that
follows in Chapter 3.
Pollen data from Ferndale Bog (Holloway
1994) in the Ouachita Mountains of
southeastern Oklahoma, and from several bogs
in Central Texas (Bousman 1998), indicate
that the Late Pleistocene climate (ca. 11,000­
14,000 years ago) was cool and dry, and
probably supported a grassland steppe. By
11,000 years ago, as the climate became
warmer and wetter, oak woodlands or oak
savanna habitats would likely have been
present throughout much of eastern Texas
(and north into Oklahoma). These woodlands
were maintained for several thousand years:
perhaps until 7500 years ago, although
Bousman (1998:Figure 4) notes a period of
open, grassland vegetation in Central Texas
between 9500-8750 B.P. The Ferndale Bog
pollen diagram (see Ferring 1994:Figure 4.5)
also points to a more open and grassy setting,
based on decreasing oak pollen and a lower
pollen influx between ca. 8000-9200 years
ago. Whether such a setting characterized East
Texas at that time is not known.
Between ca. 7500-5000/4500 years ago, the
Middle Holocene climate was quite warm and
dry, and Ferring (1995:24) suggests this was a

15

Chapter 2: Environmental Setting

period of significant reduction in available
biomass for Native American hunter-gatherers
in the region. In the Ferndale Bog area of
southeastern Oklahoma, the vegetation was an
oak-hickory-pine woodland, while farther to
the south and west in Central Texas,
grasslands were dominant. Bousman’s
(1998:210) palynological analyses led him to
conclude that the grass cover was greatest—
and the climate the driest—between 5500­
4500 B.P., while Ferring (1995:24) places the
very dry and warm episode between ca. 6500­
5000 B.P.
The Late Holocene period after ca. 4500 years
ago appears to have been one of fluctuating
climates—moist or dry cycles—that were
generally wetter than during the preceding
Middle Holocene period, and more like
modern climatic conditions. Ferring and Yates
(1996:Figure 7.5) propose that there were
wetter years between ca. 5000-2000 B.P. and
after 1000 B.P., with a drier cycle between
1000-2000 years ago when grassier conditions
prevailed. With these climatic and rainfall
conditions, oak-hickory-pine woodlands were
probably the principal vegetation in upland
habitats in much of the East Texas lands (as
they are today), with a well-developed riverine
forest in the floodplain settings.
Supporting the drier and warmer cycle in the
middle portion of the Late Holocene, the
Ferndale Bog pollen record indicates that the
peak in pine pollen was between ca. 800-1800
B.P. (Holloway 1994:Table I.2), while
Bousman (1998:207) notes one grass spike or
peak in the Weakly Bog in Central Texas that
dates about 1500-1600 years, with another
between 400-500 B.P. Stable carbon and
oxygen isotopes from mussel shells along
Denton Creek in North Texas, however, point
to a warm/dry peak at ca. 2850 B.P., and then
again after 1500 B.P. (Brown 1998:164).
Stable carbon isotope values from humate
samples in the Cooper Lake area of the upper
Sulphur River basin in Northeast Texas have
C4-enriched peaks (i.e., higher C4 grasses in
the biomass) around 2000 B.P. and 4000 B.P.
(see Perttula 1999:Figure 2-4).

16

For the last 1000 years or more,
dendrochronological records (from cypress
trees and logs) are the most accurate and
temporally sensitive data available on Late
Holocene environmental change (e.g., Stahle
1996).
Fortunately, recent dendro­
chronological research in Texas, Arkansas,
and Louisiana, as well as the Southeast and
Midwest U.S., by Stahle and Cleaveland
(1988, 1992, 1993, 1994, 1995) and Benson et
al. (2007) has compiled significant new
information on subtle but changing climatic
and rainfall conditions and trends for the
general Trans-Mississippi South region, of
which East Texas is a part (see Schambach
2002:Figure 5.1).
Droughts are not uncommon in the region in
modern times, and dendrochronological
analysis suggests there were numerous wet
and dry spells between ca. A.D. 1000-1700,
just as there were between 5000-1000 years
ago. Some of the worse droughts may have
occurred around A.D. 1555, 1570, 1595, and
1670, and the period between A.D. 1549-1577
had been suggested to have had the worse
droughts in the past 450 years (Stahle et al.
1985), at least in parts of the mid-continent.
Another severe droughty period appears to
have taken place between about A.D. 1440­
1475.
More detailed dendrochronological analyses
from bald cypress tree-ring chronologies on
spring rainfall between A.D. 1002-1988 from
Big Cypress State Park in northwestern
Louisiana indicate the wettest years were
between A.D. 1053-1057, 1168-1176, 1178­
1180, 1265-1268, 1323-1328, 1553-1555,
1584-1586, 1718-1719, 1797-1800, 1810­
1812, and 1866-1873; the very wettest years in
prehistoric times were about a decade from
1168-1176 and 1178-1180. These years would
likely have been optimal growing years for
prehistoric and early historic Caddo
agricultural groups, assuming a correlation
between crop production and spring
precipitation values (cf. Anderson et al.
1995:265). The wetter rainfall conditions
would also likely have led to an increase in the
extent of swamp and wetland habitats in the

Technical Report No. 174202

Archeological Investigations at the Lang Pasture Site (41AN38) in the Upper Neches River Basin of East Texas
Texas Department of Transportation

major stream basins, and a concomitant
expansion in the carrying capacity of
woodland plants and animals in the area. In
historic times—after ca. A.D. 1650—the
wettest intervals occurred between 1797-1815
and 1866-1876.
Conversely, the driest years in prehistoric and
early historic times in East Texas—between
A.D. 1014-1016, 1215-1217, 1444-1447,
1455-1460, 1529-1533, 1653-1655, 1697­
1699, 1841-1846, and 1855-1860—may well
have led to stressed food supplies, as well as
the ability of Caddo groups to produce
sufficient food reserves from the cultivation of
tropical cultigens, and the success of any
maize harvests during these extended periods.
The drier periods did not influence the
character of Caddo settlement systems, which
remained dispersed throughout the prehistoric
and early historic periods, but it did influence
their distribution across the landscape, as
Caddo agricultural populations began to
concentrate in the Pineywoods and along
certain major streams (i.e., the Red, the lower
Sulphur, the middle Sabine, and certain parts
of the the Neches-Angelina river basins).
The very dry years between A.D. 1444 and
1460 correlate well with the grass spike/drier
episode noted by Bousman (1998) from the
Weakly Bog pollen record. These more
significant droughts probably also affected the
constancy of flow in the numerous upland
springs in the area, as well as the volume of
flow in the major and minor stream basins.
This in turn would have influenced the relative

Technical Report No. 174202

quantity of animal and plant foods in
floodplain and upland forested habitats. The
very droughty years between 1841-1846
correlate closely with the final abandonment
of East Texas by the Caddo. Stahle and
Cleaveland’s (1988) drought reconstruction
for North Texas indicates that three of the
driest years between 1698-1980 occurred in
1855, 1857, 1859, and 1855 was the driest
year in that 282 year record.
For the period of wet and dry spells from ca.
A.D. 1000-1650, the wetter years (>1400
standard ring width indices [sri]) were more
than two times as frequent as the driest and
droughty (<560 sri) years (see Perttula
1999:Figure 2-5). After ca. A.D. 1430, the
wetter years occurred less often, some 55
percent less between A.D. 1600-1700 than in
the ca. A.D. 1200-1400 period. In historic
times, the two wettest but also equitable
intervals were between 1792-1826 and 1861­
1890, with the wetter years eight times more
common than the very dry and droughty years.
Conversely, in the period between 1827-1861,
the very dry and droughty years outnumbered
the very wet years by a ratio of 9:1. These
very different paleoenvironmental conditions
over long periods of time may have played an
important role in East Texas in human
adaptations. These conditions may also have
influenced changes to the landscape brought
about by significant erosion (and the
transportation of sandy sediments), stream
down-cutting, and the formation, preservation,
or degradation of landforms that contain, or
once contained, traces of human occupation.

3SUMMARY OF EAST TEXAS NATIVE AMERICAN CULTURE HISTORY
Timothy K. Perttula
This chapter considers the diverse character of
the prehistoric and Caddo archeological record
in East Texas, particularly from the Red River
south to the confluence of the Neches and
Angelina rivers. First, we discuss the history
of archeological research in East Texas, then
review what is known about the prehistory and
early history of east Texas, beginning with the
Paleoindian period. A principal focus of the
summary of Native American culture history
is the post-ca. A.D. 850 Caddo settlement of
East Texas, in particular the ca. post-A.D.
1300-1450 Middle to Late Caddo settlement
of the Neches River basin, since the principal
occupation of the Lang Pasture site took place
during this temporal interval.
3.1

HISTORY OF RESEARCH

Archeological research in Northeast Texas has
a lengthy history that has been thoroughly
discussed by several authors, particularly
Story (1990), Thurmond (1990), Guy (1990),
and Perttula (1992). Substantial archeological
investigations began with the Philadelphia
Academy of Natural Sciences expedition in
1912 along the Red River—mostly in
northwestern Louisiana and southwestern
Arkansas (Schambach 1983; Kelley 1997)—
but Clarence B. Moore (1912) did record
several important Caddo mound sites, and
conducted
excavations
at
the
Moore/Higginbotham site (3MI3/30), located
a few miles east of the Texas state line (Kelley
and Coxe 1998; Weinstein et al. 2003).
Much of our knowledge of the prehistoric use
of the region is primarily based on the 1930s
excavations by The University of Texas at
Austin of aboriginal sites and cemeteries (e.g.,
Pearce 1932; Jackson 1933, 1934) throughout

Technical Report No. 174202

the region, very notably in the upper Neches
River basin (Figure 3-1), and then extensive
late 1930s-early 1940s Works Progress
Administration investigations at the George C.
Davis, Hatchel, Mitchell, and Yarbrough sites
(Guy 1990; see also Newell and Krieger 1949;
Johnson 1962; Creel 1996) in Cherokee,
Bowie, and Van Zandt counties, respectively.
Since then, most of the information about the
Paleoindian, Archaic, Woodland, and Caddoan
archeological record in East Texas comes
from a disparate range of privately-funded
archeological
research,
including:
(1)
avocational archeological investigations and
Texas Archeological Society field schools (see
Corbin and Hart 1998; Jelks 1967;
Middlebrook 1994, 1997; Perttula et al. 2001;
Turner and Smith 2003), and (2) University of
Texas at Austin (Fields 1979; Story 1981,
1982, 1995, 1997) and Stephen F. Austin State
University field schools in archeology (see
Corbin and Hart 1998). There has also been
extensive professional archeological work in a
number of state and federally-funded or
permitted reservoirs in the Sabine, Sulphur,
Neches, Angelina, and Big Cypress drainage
basins (see Anderson et al. 1974; Bruseth and
Perttula 1981; Duffield 1963; Fields et al.
1997; Jelks 1965; Jensen 1968; McClurkan et
al. 1966; Thurmond 1990; Woodall 1969),
archeological survey investigations on the
National Forests in East Texas (see Sherman
et al. 1999), as well as in considerable
archeological work in large surface lignite
mines (e.g., Galan et al. 1997; Kotter et al.
1993; Perttula et al. 1998; Rogers et al. 2001;
Rogers and Perttula 2004), and on TxDOT­
sponsored archeological projects (see Cliff and
Perttula 2002; Cliff et al. 2004; Lohse 2005;
Ricklis, ed., 2004; Rogers et al. 2003). Ahr

3.1.1

Paleoindian and Archaic
Periods

For the period prior to about 7000-8000 years
before the present (B.P.), extended perhaps to
as long as ca. 13,000 years B.P. (Waters and
Stafford 2007), the East Texas archeological
record primarily consists of surficial, mixed,
or isolated finds of diagnostic projectile points
(cf. Bousman et al. 2004; Johnson 1989; Story
1990), based on comparisons with well-dated
and stratified sites to the east and west of the
region (see Anderson et al. 1996:15). At the
Forrest Murphey site (41MR62), for example,
Clovis, Plainview, Dalton, and other
lanceolate projectile point forms and tools
were found in several discrete concentrations
on a high terrace above Big Cypress Creek;
faunal remains from extinct elephants were
also recovered in apparent association (Story
1990), which is rather rare. The Delta Bone
Quarry 5 (41DT86) on the North Sulphur river
had a buried hearth and an antler tool
(Slaughter and Hoover 1965), and charcoal
from the hearth has calibrated intercepts
ranging between 10,560-10,794 years B.P.
(Bousman et al. 2004:Table 2.1), broadly
contemporaneous with Folsom and Dalton
complexes in the region.
Undoubtedly other discrete archeological
components are present in the region, such as
the buried Finley Fan site occupied as early as
6400 years B.P. (Gadus et al. 1992) and the
spatially discrete Late Paleoindian John Pearce
site in the Red River basin in northwestern
Louisiana (Webb et al. 1971), but they have
proven to be quite difficult to define and
recognize. For example, a provocative but
poorly known Paleoindian site has been
reported by avocational archeologists in deep
sand deposits on the Neches River where it
had been exposed by Lake Palestine shoreline
erosion. Thirty-five Paleoindian lanceolates,
primarily Dalton and Scottsbluff forms,
projectile point preforms, drills, scrapers, and
channel flakes have been found there, with
most of the tools manufactured on cherts from
the Edwards Plateau of Central Texas and
Ouachita Mountains cherts and quartzites
(Perttula 1989). The site also contains a

Technical Report No. 174202

Folsom, two channel flakes, and a Folsom
preform of Alibates agatized dolomite. In
another case, McCrocklin (1994 personal
communication) has documented Dalton and
early side-notched (Big Sandy?) points,
knives, scrapers, bone tools (antler flakers),
and cut bone (some fossilized) from blue clay
deposits buried in a Red River gravel bar north
of Shreveport, Louisiana. An extensive buried
Early to Middle Archaic settlement is present
at the Conly site along Loggy Bayou in the
Red River basin in northwestern Louisiana
(Girard 2000).
Paleoindian materials have been recovered at a
number of archeological sites in the Post Oak
Savanna and Pineywoods of East Texas
(Bousman et al. 2004:Table 2.2 and Figures
2.45, 2.46e, h-i). The early Paleoindian (ca.
13,000-10,500 years B.P., based on calibrated
dates and age estimates) archeological
materials include Clovis and Folsom fluted
lanceolate points, commonly manufactured on
high-quality non-local lithic raw materials,
along with scraping tools (Story 1990:Table
44). According to Bever and Meltzer
(2007:Table 1), only one Clovis point has
been documented from Anderson County,
Texas, but overall, the density of Clovis points
and sites is high in East Texas (Bever and
Meltzer 2007:74, 77).
Unfluted lanceolates—usually resharpened
and beveled—dominate the Late Paleoindian
period (ca. 10,500-9500 years B.P.) material
culture record in the region, including Dalton
(Johnson 1989:Figure 7; Wyckoff and Bartlett
1995), San Patrice, and Scottsbluff points
which concentrate in Northeast Texas and
locales to the east (e.g., Saunders and Allen
1997:Figure 2), as well as early side-notched
points and Albany beveled bifaces or knives
(see Webb et al. 1971; Johnson 1989:Figure
13), Quince-style scrapers, end and side
scrapers, denticulates, burins, and bifacial
adzes. San Patrice projectile points and
associated tools are typically manufactured on
local raw materials (Saunders and Allen
1997:3; Webb et al. 1971). One unrecorded
Paleoindian and Early Archaic site in Gregg
County, Texas, contains an abundance of large

21

Chapter 3: Summary of East Texas Native American Culture History

early side-notched points made from
novaculite, along with a Dalton point of
Ouachita Mountains chert and a single San
Patrice lanceolate on a local raw material
(Perttula 2004b:Figure 13.4).
The distributions of Paleoindian artifacts
within the region suggest that these early
occupations were principally situated within
the valleys of major stream basins (see
Thurmond 1990:Table 53 and 54; Anderson
1996a), as well as resource-rich areas like the
Ouachita Mountains escarpment (Anderson
1996b:Figure 3.2). It appears that Paleoindian
foraging groups occupied small camps and
had an unspecialized hunting tool kit.
Anderson (1996b) postulated that the initial
and most intensive Paleoindian settlement of
the Southeast (which would include East
Texas) took place in the resource-rich valleys
of the Mississippi River and its principal
tributaries. From there, Paleoindian groups
settled throughout the wooded Southeast and
East, with concentrations at 250-400 km
intervals, indicating the scale of movement of
these highly mobile foragers. The relatively
sparse Paleoindian archeological record, in
conjunction with the dispersion of artifacts on
many landforms and different settings within
the region, seems to indicate that the
Paleoindian groups were very mobile hunters
and gatherers rather than specialized hunters
of extinct megafaunal species (Fields and
Tomka 1993:82). Johnson (1989) also
suggests that some of the Paleoindian
archeological remains
(Plainview and
Scottsbluff projectile points, and Cody knives)
from the region are a result of Plains Late
Paleoindian (ca. 10,000-9,000 years B.P.)
groups that moved into parts of East Texas,
during periods when grassland habitat spread
eastward, to exploit the plains resources (such
as bison) found there.
Archeological data from the Yarbrough site
(41VN6) on the upper Sabine River were
employed by Johnson (1962) to first bring
chronological and cultural order to the diverse
Archaic (ca. 9500 to 2500 years B.P.)
archeological record found in Northeast

22

Texas. Of particular import were Johnson's
(1962:208) temporal divisions of the Archaic
based on projectile point sequences, and the
introduction of plain ceramics at the end of the
Archaic. Story (1990:Figure 32) and
Thurmond (1990:Table 8) provide the most
current (although still poorly dated with
supporting radiocarbon assays) chronological
classifications of Archaic-age dart points, with
straight and expanding stem forms
characteristic of the Early and Middle Archaic
periods and the contracting stem darts
particularly diagnostic of the Late Archaic
(and much of the Woodland period as well).
Recent paleoenvironmental research (see
Chapter 2) suggests that much of the Archaic
period, particularly the period between ca.
8000-4000 years B.P., was drier than today,
with apparent reductions in biomass as well as
the local expansion of prairie habitats along
the western margins of the region.
Nevertheless, drier conditions and changing
vegetation conditions “clearly did not preclude
occupations” (Ferring 1995:33) during these
periods. While the archeological data are still
rather limited, it appears that group mobility
remained high for these hunting-gathering
foragers (who utilized hardwood nuts, deer,
shellfish, turtles, and small mammals) during
the Early Archaic (ca. 9500-8000 years B.P.),
and group territories were large and poorly
defined, with most sites conforming to what
Thurmond (1990:41) called "heavy" and
"limited-use" areas; that is, repeated and
recurrent occupations by small groups.
Anderson (1996a) suggests that such Archaic
groups had highly mobile foraging adaptations
along the Red River, the central Sabine River,
and in interior uplands away from major
drainages, with expedient lithic technologies.
Most sites of this age were briefly used,
although this may be a product of differential
site preservation, but tended to concentrate in
the larger drainages within the region.
By the Middle Archaic period (ca. 8000-5000
years B.P.), fairly substantial and extensive
occupations are recognized within the major
basins in the region, with a rather limited use
of smaller tributaries and headwater areas.

Components of this period are open camps
dominated by hunting tools (including the
distinctive blade notched Evans point) and
generalized cutting/scraping tools, debris,
ground stone tools, and cores.
Burned rock features (possible hearths, ovens,
and cooking pits?) and burned rock
concentrations are present in dated Middle
Archaic contexts at a few sites in the Sulphur
River drainage (see Gadus et al. 1992; Cliff et
al. 1996), suggesting that an important activity
was the cooking and processing of plant foods,
but mainly by small groups for short-term use
(Fields et al. 1997:90). A single burned rock
feature at the Unionville site (41CS151) has a
calibrated date of 4040-4161 B.C. (Cliff et al.
1996). Lithic raw material data from a
possible Middle Archaic assemblage at Lake
Fork Reservoir in the upper Sabine River
basin indicates that the exchange of non-local
materials (particularly finished tools) was
common place (Perttula 1984), although
"patterns in raw material use were not uniform
across Northeast Texas" (Fields and Tomka
1993:92), and in general, the use of non-local
raw materials was not common. At Cooper
Lake in Archaic contexts, the non-local lithics
that are present primarily originated to the
north in the Red River basin (Fields et al.
1997). Mound complexes of Middle Archaic
age in northern Louisiana at this time also
suggest the development of more complex
hunter-gatherer societies in the TransMississippi South (see Saunders et al. 1997;
Saunders and Allen 1997).
Late Archaic sites (ca. 5000-2500 years B.P.)
are widely distributed in the Pineywoods and
Post Oak Savanna, occurring along the major
streams, near springs, on spring-fed branches,
upland ridges, and on tributary drainages of all
sizes. In fact, the distribution of Late Archaic
sites suggests these groups moderately to
extensively ranged over and exploited almost
every part of the region, and in particular,
Anderson (1996a) notes major concentrations
of Late Archaic sites along the Red and Little
Rivers in southwest Arkansas and northwest
Louisiana, as well as in the Ouachita
Mountains. Aboriginal populations continued

Technical Report No. 174202

a generalized foraging adaptation, combined
with apparent population growth. There are
only a few well-dated Late Archaic period
components known in the region, however.
Some Late Archaic occupations in riverine
settings contain earthen middens (e.g., the
Yarbrough site along the Sabine River), but
generally, sites of this age contain burned rock
features and/or concentrations of burned
rocks, as well as small pits. The Late Archaic
occupation in Area C at the Unionville site
(41CS151) had a buried anthrosol or
occupational surface that had been darkened
or stained by cultural activities, while within
the anthrosol were two clusters of burned rock
features (Cliff et al. 1996). Large pits and rock
hearths in a Late Archaic component at the
Herman Bellew site (41RK222) have
calibrated dates that range from 380-1590
B.C. (Rogers et al. 2001). At the Mockingbird
site (41TT550) in the Big Cypress Creek
drainage, the Late Archaic component (dated
between 2360-2780 years B.P.) contained
scattered burned rocks and low amounts of
stone tools and projectile points, suggesting it
was used only as a temporary encampment or
“limited use” area. Many other Late Archaic
sites or components are known where burned
rocks from hearth construction and use was
relatively abundant, along with projectile
points, bifacial and flake tools, and flake
debris. In cases where there was an extensive
use of burned rock features, this suggests that
the cooking and bulk processing of plant foods
in ovens and pits was important to some Late
Archaic populations in the region.
These settlement data are compatible with
higher population densities, limited group
mobility but a wide dispersion of camp and
foraging areas, the possible establishment of
definable territorial ranges, and a welldeveloped foraging economy based on the
hunting and gathering of local food resources.
No paleobotanical evidence is available that
indicates the Late Archaic populations here
cultivated native plant species (i.e., such as
sumpweed, sunflower, and chenopod), as was
the case by the first millennium B.C. in many
parts of Eastern North America (Fritz

23

Chapter 3: Summary of East Texas Native American Culture History

1994:25-27). Nutshells and a few fragments of
prairie turnip (Psoralea sp.) are documented in
Late Archaic components at the Unionville
site (Cliff et al. 1996) along the lower Sulphur
River, and at Cooper Reservoir sites (Fields et
al. 1997). The high use of local lithic raw
materials during the Late Archaic speaks to a
more confined inter-regional interaction at this
time (Fields and Tomka 1993; Perttula and
Bruseth 1995). By contrast, in the Mississippi
River basin of northern Louisiana, Late
Archaic sites are marked by extensive
quantities of non-local lithic raw materials,
particularly novaculite and Ozark cherts
(Saunders and Allen 1997:19).
3.1.2

Woodland Period

The Woodland period (ca. 2500 to ca. 1150­
1100 years B.P.) in much of the region,
particularly from the Sabine and Sulphur
rivers to the Red River, may be recognized
primarily by plain and relatively thick ceramic
bowls and "flowerpot" shaped jars, doublebitted axe heads, the smaller and thinner Gary
projectile points, and later in the period by
corner-notched arrow points (Schambach
1998, 2001; Thurmond 1990). North of the
Sulphur River and in contiguous areas in
southwestern
Arkansas,
northwestern
Louisiana, and southeastern Oklahoma, such
Woodland cultures have been called Fourche
Maline by Schambach (1998, 2001).
In several instances, Lower Mississippi Valley
(LMV) related ceramics (such as Tchefuncte
Stamped, Churupa Incised, Marksville Incised,
Chevalier Stamped, and Marksville Stamped)
occur with some frequency in earlier and later
Woodland
period
components
(Story
1990:246; Rogers et al. 2001). These ceramics
may be trade items that evidence contact and
interaction between Trans-Mississippi South
Native Americans and groups in the LMV, or
were ceramics whose stylistic decorative
attributes were borrowed by local potters (see
Schambach 1982, 1998; Perttula and Bruseth
1995).
At Woodland period sites along the Red River
in southwestern Arkansas and Northeast

24

Texas, ceramics used for cooking and food
serving are abundant, and comprise a
significant proportion of the artifact
assemblages, while in many other Woodland
period sites in much of Northeast Texas
(particularly between the Sulphur and Sabine
rivers, but also characteristic of Woodland
period sites in the Neches/Angelina river
basins), the use of ceramics was not as
prevalent. This suggests regional differences
in Woodland period food processing (i.e.,
boiling of foods in vessels to make them
palatable and a change from stone to wooden
food preparation tools) and dietary habits (i.e.,
an increased consumption of carbohydraterich foods, possibly including some amounts
of maize). It is probable that there were also
differences in sedentism between Woodland
populations across the region, based on strong
correlations between sedentism and pottery
making.
Later LMV Coles Creek period ceramics (and
expanding stem arrow points similar to the
Colbert and Friley types) are present in
notable quantities in several sites along the
Sabine River and the Red River, particularly at
James Pace in a context dated between ca.
1300-1000 years B.P. (Girard 1994), and at
the generally contemporaneous Ray site
(41LR135) (Bruseth 1998). Similar ceramics
occur in stratified contexts at the Crenshaw
(3MI6) and Mounds Plantation (16CD12) sites
in burial mound features (Schambach 1997;
Webb and McKinney 1975), and this is also
the period when larger villages and multiple
mound centers begin to be constructed on the
major streams (e.g., the Red and Sabine rivers)
in the Trans-Mississippi South.
To the south of the Sabine River, but
concentrated in the Neches-Angelina and
Attoyac drainage basins, Woodland period
sites contain plain sandy paste ceramics
(Goose Creek Plain, var. unspecified) of the
Mossy Grove tradition (Story 1990:Figure 39;
Ricklis 2004:Figure 6.7) as well as decorated
ceramics with LMV affiliations. Woodland
period components account for at least 25-50
percent of the known prehistoric archeological
sites in the Angelina-Neches confluence area

Technical Report No. 174202

Archeological Investigations at the Lang Pasture Site (41AN38) in the Upper Neches River Basin of East Texas
Texas Department of Transportation

and points west (Martin et al. 1995:Table 2;
Perttula et al. 1993), and represent the
campsites and habitation locales of seasonal
foraging-gathering and hunting adaptations.
Aboriginal pottery was adopted and used by
Mossy Grove groups for the cooking and
processing of plant and animal foods by about
2000 years B.P., and by 1250-1350 years B.P.,
if not earlier, the Mossy Grove populations
were using a variety of stemmed arrow points
for hunting.
Changes in the density and placement of
Woodland period sites across the landscape—
particularly focusing on sandy interfluves—
led Corbin (1998:114-115) to suggest that
horticulture may have been introduced in the
Neches-Angelina river basins during the
Woodland period. Another alternative posited
by Corbin (1998:115) to account for the
number and distribution of Woodland period
sites in that part of East Texas may “have been
tied to...moving closer to a significant plant
food source (i.e., plants that were restricted to
valley margins and/or the floodplain) whose
use was facilitated by processing via cooking
in ceramic vessels.” Settlement data from the
McGee Bend area at the confluence of the
Angelina and Attoyac rivers indicates that
middens and occupational components are
present in Woodland period contexts that
range from 0.5-8 acres in size (Duffield 1963;
Jelks 1965).
Woodland period groups were still primarily
hunter-gatherers who lived in increasingly
larger groups and resided for longer periods of
time at certain sites. The fact that some of
these latter sites have relatively substantial
midden deposits (particularly along the Red
River and in the upper Sulphur River basin,
see Schambach 1982; Fields et al. 1997), and
some evidence for structures (probably daubed
pole and thatch structures), suggest more
intensive occupations and a decreased
residential mobility, and higher population
densities, but the degree of permanence is still
less than that seen in the subsequent long-term
Caddo settlement of East Texas (Perttula et al.
1993:99). Schambach (1983:5) suggests that
Woodland (or Fourche Maline) period

Technical Report No. 174202

settlements along the Great Bend of the Red
River included “small to medium sized
villages of from 1 to 4 ha.”
On the basis of the available paleobotanical
information, Woodland period groups may
have cultivated squash (see McGregor 1997),
and used native seeds and tubers/roots, as well
as a variety of woodland and aquatic animal
resources, particularly white-tailed deer. At
the Resch site, the rather extensive midden
deposits contained only burned rock features
(probably used for the cooking and baking of
plant foods) and dense quantities of charred
nutshells and poorly preserved animal bones
(Webb et al. 1969). The presence of chipped
stone axes and hoe-shaped tools in Woodland
occupations suggests that some horticultural
practices (perhaps the use of colonizing weedy
annuals) and forest clearance may have begun.
Stable isotope analyses of human remains of
some 25+ Late Archaic, Fourche Maline, and
Formative Caddo-Early Caddo period samples
indicate that maize was not a major part of the
diet of Woodland period groups (see Rose et
al. 1998). The examination of skeletal
pathologies in Woodland period contexts from
the Red River area and East Texas indicates
low levels of infection, but high levels of
degenerative diseases relative to subsequent
Caddo populations (Rose et al. 1998:Table 6­
4). These data further support the idea that
Woodland period populations were primarily
hunter-gatherers with a nutritionally adequate
diet, who probably lived across the region in
relatively low population densities, but whose
life style was characterized by chronic stress
(on the joints) and heavy work loads (Rose et
al. 1998:121). Maize is also poorly
represented in the archeological record before
ca. 1250-1050 years B.P.
In much of East Texas, Woodland period sites
are not very common, perhaps because most
of the area was not heavily settled during this
time (e.g., Story 1990:310). One of the few
well-studied Woodland period components in
the Sabine River drainage is at the Herman
Bellew site (41RK222), where the component
dates between ca. 2450-1265 years B.P.
(Rogers et al. 2001), and had rock

25

Chapter 3: Summary of East Texas Native American Culture History

concentrations as well as small and large pits,
contracting stemmed dart points, and a small
amount of mainly plain ceramics as well as
LMV ceramic sherds. By contrast, settlements
of this period are common throughout the
Sulphur (see Fields et al. 1997) and NechesAngelina river basins (Corbin 1998).
No Woodland period burial mounds have been
documented north of the Sabine River in the
Pineywoods and Post Oak Savanna, although
they have been found in bluff top and alluvial
valley settings on the Red River in
northwestern Louisiana and southwestern
Arkansas (Schambach 1982, 1997; Webb
1984), and on the Angelina, Neches, and
Sabine rivers in deep East Texas (Story
1990:310; see also Jelks 1965 and Jensen
1968). Associated with the construction and
use of mounds in the Woodland period was
the procurement and dispersal of costly nonlocal raw materials and artifacts, including
cherts, copper, and LMV ceramic vessels that
were included as grave goods or caches in the
burial mounds.
The two or three mounds at James Pace
(16DS268) on the Sabine River did not,
however, apparently serve as platforms for
burials or structures, or as caps for these
features, and their functional significance is
undetermined
(Girard
1994:15).
The
appearance of burial mounds (and mounds
covering crematoria) in the broader region
does suggest that more complexly organized
local groups did develop during the Woodland
period in these localities (cf. Schambach 1996,
1997).
In non-mound contexts, there is also evidence
of mortuary or ritual practices in the
Woodland period. The Hurricane Hill site on
the South Sulphur river contained a small
cemetery on a prominent hill that dates
between cal A.D. 59-449 (Perttula 1999), and
the Mahaffey site on the Kiamichi River in
southeastern Oklahoma also had a large
cemetery with flexed and semi-flexed burials
without grave goods (Perino and Bennett
1978). Later Woodland period cemeteries with
9-21+ burials—dating after ca. 1450-1750

26

years B.P.—have also been identified at sites
such as Snipes (41CP8; Jelks 1961) in the
lower Sulphur River basin, and several sites in
southwestern Arkansas (Schambach 1982).
These later shallow extended burials contained
an occasional whole vessel, boat stone, celt, or
chipped biface. The vessels include flower-pot
shaped Williams Plain and Coles Creek
Incised types (see Jelks 1961:Plate 4). The
Crenshaw site also had many late Woodland
period extended burials in village midden
contexts (the large village is estimated to
cover 8 ha), and these also contained ceramic
vessels as funerary objects (Schambach
1982:152).
Comparable burial cremation practices at the
Hurricane Hill site in the upper Sulphur River
basin and the contemporaneous Johnny Ford
site (3LA5), an early Fourche Maline village
(ca. 2150-1650 years B.P.) in the Great Bend
area of the Red River valley, suggests the
existence of similar belief systems among
aboriginal Woodland period groups in the Red
and Sulphur river basins. Schambach
(1996:36) describes the burials at Johnny Ford
as occurring in a “cremation cemetery,” and
he further suggests that everyone in the village
may have been cremated (adults and children
were also cremated at Hurricane Hill), using
bluff edge crematoria at mound sites
(Schambach 1997:57).
The identification of formally bounded
cemeteries at a number of Woodland period
habitation sites in the Trans-Mississippi South
(see Rose et al. 1999) is consistent with the
existence and settlement of distinctive social
groups (based on kinship and/or residence) of
affiliated individuals at sites and various
locales during that time. It appears that
children and adults were buried together in
these cemeteries, suggesting that these
Woodland populations had an egalitarian
social organization within local settlements
and communities. At its broadest scope, the
establishment of cemeteries clearly correlates
with an increasing sedentism in the western
Gulf Coastal Plain of East Texas after ca. 2150
years B.P.

Formative-Early-and
Middle Caddo Periods

There is an abundance of archeological
information available on the Formative (ca.
1150-950 years B.P.), Early (ca. 950-750
years B.P.), and Middle (ca. 750-550 years
B.P.) Caddo period occupations of the
Pineywoods and Post Oak Savanna of East
Texas. First, Caddo archeological sites of
these ages are quite common, and about 80
percent of the +500 radiocarbon dates
available from Northeast Texas archeological
sites pertain to occupations at prehistoric and
protohistoric Caddo sites. The largest number
of dates fall in the Middle Caddo period,
followed by the Early Caddo period. Using
calibrated ages and age mid-points of 1-sigma
calibrated age ranges, the largest number of
Caddo radiocarbon dates fall within the AD
1201-1300 interval (or 749-650 years B.P.)
(Perttula 1998). While the number of dates in
this period is probably inflated to some degree
by the extensive series of dates from the
George C. Davis site (see Story 1997, 2000), it
does appear to be the case that Middle Caddo
period occupations are rather commonplace
throughout much of East Texas (Middlebrook
and Perttula 1997), supporting the broad
findings of the radiocarbon dates from the
region.
Caddo sites of Formative to Middle Caddo
period age are situated primarily on elevated
landforms (alluvial terraces and rises, natural
levees, and upland edges) adjacent to the
major streams, as well as along minor
tributaries and spring-fed branches. Proximity
to arable sandy loam soils were preferred for
settlement locations, presumably because of
good drainage for habitation, and for
cultivation purposes. The majority of these
Caddo sites are permanent settlements with
evidence of the structures, including posts,
pits, and features marking their residency,
along with cemeteries and graves where the
dead were buried; the middens where the
animal and plant food refuse was discarded
amidst broken stone tools and pottery vessels;
and the material remains of tools and ceramics
used in the procurement and processing of the

Technical Report No. 174202

bountiful resources of the region. They
represent the settlements of
Caddo
communities and sociopolitical entities, and
the civic-ceremonial centers that were their
focus (Perttula 1993:125).
The distribution of Caddo settlements across
the landscape suggests that all habitats were
used to some extent, either intensively as
locations for the sedentary communities and
farmsteads (that may have been occupied for
single or multiple generations), or periodically
by groups in logistical camps where specific
natural resources could be procured by the
Caddo in bulk. Along the Red River, and
probably on the other large streams or rivers in
the region, a particular focus of settlement was
along natural levees in recently abandoned
meander belts, and these habitats “served as an
ideal context for a dispersed community” in a
major floodplain landscape (Girard 1997:156).
The most common types of Caddo settlements
in the region during these periods of time
appear to be small year-round hamlets and
farmsteads with circular to rectangular
structures (Bruseth 1998; Bruseth and Perttula
1981; Cliff 1997; Middlebrook 1994, 1997;
Rogers and Perttula 2004; Thurmond 1990).
These settlements sometimes occur in
association with small household cemeteries
(see Goldschmidt 1935; Middlebrook and
Perttula 1997), and occasionally with a larger
cemetery (> 10 burials).
Larger communities (covering more than 10
acres) have also been recognized that occur in
association with mound centers (such as the
large settlements at George C. Davis
[41CE19], Hale [41TT12], Boxed Springs
[41UR30], and Hudnall-Pirtle [41RK4; see
Bruseth 1991; Bruseth and Perttula 2006]).
These mound centers have extensive
habitation areas, plazas, and spatially
restricted temple and burial mound locales.
Shaft burials of high status individuals have
been documented in mound contexts at the
George C. Davis site (Story 1997, 1998, 2000)
and a few other mound centers (such as
Washington Square [41NA49)], Boxed
Springs, and Sanders [41LR2]; see Corbin and

27

Chapter 3: Summary of East Texas Native American Culture History

Hart 1998; Hamilton 1997), and they also
occur in non-mound contexts at several sites
along the Red River during Formative Caddo
period times (see Bruseth 1998).
Certainly the most thoroughly studied
Formative and Early Caddo period site in the
region is the George C. Davis site, a large
village and mound center on the Neches River,
downstream from the Lang Pasture site project
area. Recent remote sensing investigations
indicate that there are more than 100 structures
in the village areas around the three mounds
on site (Creel et al. 2005). Calibrated
radiocarbon dates from village contexts
establish that the site was occupied beginning
by the mid-ninth century A.D., and then was
continuously settled to the end of the 13th
century A.D. (Story 2000). A large number of
structures were built on, and adjacent to,
Mound A, and the extensive structure
rebuilding there indicates the area was
preferred for settlement by the Caddo.
Calibrated dates from a few contexts suggest
that the site was inhabited to some degree as
late as ca. 600 years B.P. (see Story 1997).
There were three mounds at the Davis site,
including Mound A (a flat-topped platform),
Mound C (burial mound) built over a large
pre-mound burial pit in the latter part of the
Formative Caddo period and containing an
estimated 25-30 elite burial pits, and Mound B
(a second flat-topped platform) constructed
about 750 years B.P. or slightly earlier (Story
1997, 1998).
One of the more significant Caddo sites
investigated recently in the Pineywoods, the
Oak Hill Village (41RK214), estimated to date
between ca. 500-800 years B.P., has at least 42
circular and rectangular structures. Some of
the structures had been rebuilt and some
overlapped earlier structures, particularly at
the northwestern end of the ridge and plaza,
and they were arranged over the 3.5 acre
village in a circular pattern around a central
plaza area (Rogers and Perttula 2004; Perttula
and Rogers 2007). Several small structures on
the eastern side of the plaza have been
identified as possible granaries for the storage
of harvested corn. A small mound (covering a

28

burned circular structure) is at the north end of
the site, and several midden deposits have
been identified that appear to be associated
with individual structures. Two large circular
structures have extended entranceways that
pointed towards the plaza, and their special
form and orientation suggests they are
probably public buildings used by the Oak Hill
Village community for special purposes.
Ceramic analyses and radiocarbon dating
indicate these structures were built after ca.
600 years B.P. during the extensive Late
Village (Rogers and Perttula 2004).
Another important Middle Caddo period site is
Tyson (41SY92) in the Attoyac River basin,
dating between cal A.D. 1336-1490. This
settlement contains evidence for structures and
cooking and storage pit features, has extensive
midden deposits and well-preserved plant and
animal remains, and a small cemetery of
children. Middlebrook (1994, 1997) suggests
that the Tyson site represents the residence of
a caddi or chiefly elite.
One of the calibrated dates from the Tyson site
was on mussel shell included as grave goods
with Feature 14, the burial of a 3- to 4-yr-old
child accompanied by many grave goods
(Middlebrook 1994:16). Among the burial
offerings were eight ceramic vessels near the
head and feet of the child, two large paired
deer antlers over the child’s head (perhaps as
part of a head dress), carved shell inlays near
the head, two carved bone ear spools, 32
Olivella shell beads, three columnella beads
from a necklace, a turtle rattle, a cache of
mussel shell, smoothed stones, two pitted
stones, a cache of six deer ulna awls and two
beaver teeth, and a cache of lithic pebble
cores, flakes, preforms, and a notched shell
point (Middlebrook 1994:16).
These Formative-Middle Caddo groups seem
to have been horticulturists, cultivating maize
and squash, along with several kinds of native
seeds (Perttula and Bruseth 1983), gathered
nuts and tubers/storage roots, and were
proficient hunters of deer, fish, and many
other animal species. The available
paleobotanical and bioarcheological evidence

Technical Report No. 174202

Archeological Investigations at the Lang Pasture Site (41AN38) in the Upper Neches River Basin of East Texas
Texas Department of Transportation

(including stable carbon isotopes on human
remains) from East Texas (and elsewhere in
the Caddoan area, including the upper Neches
River basin; see Rose et al. 1998) does not
indicate, however, that Caddo groups became
dependent upon maize and other domesticated
crops until after about 650 years B.P.; by ca.
500 years B.P., maize likely comprised more
than 50 percent of the diet (see Burnett 1990;
Perttula 1996; Rose et al. 1998). Certain
prehistoric groups that lived in the Trinity
River basin in north central and east central
Texas (outside of East Texas) and interacted
with the Caddo living in the upper Neches
River basin, also cultivated plants, but these
plants appear “to have been incorporated into
an existing subsistence system at a
supplemental level . . . growing of
crops…simply offered another source of
foodstuffs” (Gadus et al. 2002:141).
Both temple and burial mounds were built by
these Pineywoods Caddo groups. The larger
sites are important civic-ceremonial centers
containing multiple mounds and associated
villages, and these generally date after ca.
1050 years B.P.. The multiple mound centers
are rather evenly spaced along the Red River,
Sabine River, and Big Cypress Bayou, and
those that are contemporaneous may represent
hierarchical systems of an "integrated . . .
regional network of interaction and
redistribution" (Thurmond 1990:234). The
Jamestown (eight mounds and village), Boxed
Springs (four mounds, village, and large
cemetery), and Hudnall-Pirtle (eight mounds
and 60 acre village) multiple mound centers
appear to represent the apex of postulated
local Early-Middle Caddoan networks in the
Sabine River basin. The McKenzie (41WD55)
site in the middle Sabine River drainage has a
single sub-structural mound that dates between
cal A.D. 1298-1470 (see Granberry 1995), and
there are contemporaneous mounds covering
structures with extended entranceways at the
Redwine (41SM193) and Bryan Hardy
(41SM55) sites (see Walters et al. 1998;
Walters and Haskins 2000). The Middle
Caddo occupation at Redwine also included an
extensive midden deposit, hearth and pit

Technical Report No. 174202

features and a small cemetery with extended
supine burials.
The distribution, number, and spacing of
mound centers, particularly the sites with
multiple mounds, in East Texas and adjoining
parts of southwestern Arkansas and
northwestern Louisiana clearly indicates that
the Caddo peoples who built and used these
mounds were integrated into societies of
considerable socio-political complexity. The
premier mound centers in the NechesAngelina river basins include George C. Davis
and Washington Square (Story 1997; Corbin
and Hart 1998). The Washington Square
mound complex is well-dated, with pooled
radiocarbon dates on charcoal, hardwood
nutshells, and charred corn range between cal
AD 1268 and 1302 (Corbin and Hart 1998:74
and Table 4); the overall range of the
calibrated dates from the site suggest it was
occupied by the Caddo between ca. 700-500
years B.P. Extensive excavations documented
a circular structure under Mound 1/2, an
assortment of pits and post holes in nonmound contexts, and several large burial pits
in a mortuary mound (the Reavely-House
Mound). No clear evidence for on-site
permanent Caddo habitation was identified at
Washington Square, although an interesting
assortment of large sherd-filled pits
(representing many vessels) were encountered
in one area between Mound 1/2 and the
mortuary mound (see Corbin and Hart
1998:Figure 14). These may represent deposits
from public feasting activities led by the
Caddo elite (e.g., Scott and Jackson 1998) that
used the Washington Square mound site as a
ceremonial center in the 13th and 14th
centuries A.D.
The radiocarbon dating of the Washington
Square and George C. Davis sites hints at the
possibility that the Washington Square Mound
center began to flourish about the time (after
ca. 700 years B.P.) the George C. Davis site
was diminishing in power and social authority.
This suggests that the Caddo community that
built and used the Washington Square Mound
site—more advantageously located eastward
at the nexus of north-south (later to be known

29

Chapter 3: Summary of East Texas Native American Culture History

as the Caddo trace) and east-west (later known
as the Camino Real) aboriginal trails—
achieved pre-eminence at the expense of the
long-lasting polity on the Neches River. The
George C. Davis site was abandoned by the
early 14th century A.D.
The Formative, Early, and Middle Caddo
period groups possessed a rich material
culture. Well-made, corner-notched, and
rectangular-stemmed arrow points were
common, along with siltstone and greenstone
celts, perforators and borers, large Gahagan
bifaces, and a variety of more expedient stone
tools (unifacial flake scraping and cutting
implements). Long-stemmed Red River
(Hoffman 1967) and cigar-shaped ceramic
pipes were made by the Caddo at this time, as
were ceramic ear spools and figurines (see
Newell and Krieger 1949).
The most distinctive material culture item of
the Caddo groups living in East Texas were
the ceramics they made for cooking, storage,
and serving needs. The styles and forms of
ceramics found on sites in the region hint at
the variety, temporal span, and geographic
extent of a number of prehistoric Caddo
groups spread across the landscape. The
diversity in decoration and shape in Caddo
ceramics is substantial, both in the utility ware
jars and bowls, as well as in the fine ware
bottles, carinated bowls, and compound
vessels. A diverse and distinctive ceramic
assemblage characterizes the Caddo ceramics
from the region. Ceramics are quite common
in domestic contexts on habitation sites across
the region and also occur as grave goods in
mortuary contexts.
The Caddo made ceramics in a wide variety of
vessel shapes, and with an abundance of wellcrafted and executed body and rim designs and
surface treatments. There is an impressive
diversity of vessel forms among the Caddo
fine wares. This includes carinated bowls,
deep compound bowls, double and triple
vessels (joined bowls and bottles [Suhm and
Jelks 1962:Plates 38k, 51e, 59d]), bottles,
ollas, zoomorphic and anthropomorphic effigy
bowls and bottles, ladles, platters, peaked jars,

30

gourd and box-shaped bowls, and chalices.
From the archeological contexts in which
Caddo ceramics have been found, as well as
inferences about their manufacture and use, it
is evident that ceramics were important to the
prehistoric Caddo in: the cooking and serving
of foods and beverages, in the storage of
foodstuffs, as personal possessions, as
beautiful works of art and craftsmanship (i.e.,
some vessels were clearly made to never be
used in domestic contexts), and as social
identifiers; that is, certain shared and
distinctive stylistic motifs and decorative
patterns marked closely related communities
and constituent groups.
The Caddo made both fine wares (with very
finely crushed temper), bottles and many
bowls, and utility wares (some of the simple
bowls, as well as the jars that were made in a
variety of sizes). Almost without exception,
Caddo ceramics were tempered with grog
(crushed sherds) or bone, although burned and
crushed shells were used as temper after ca.
650 years B.P. among most of the Red River
Caddo groups and on later Caddo sites in the
lower and upper Sulphur River basin; grogtempered pottery was the norm throughout the
upper Neches River basin, especially during
the Late and Historic Caddo periods (Perttula
2007). After adding the temper to the clay, the
kneaded clay was formed into clay coils that
were added to flat disk bases to form the
vessel, and the coils were apparently smoothed
with a round river pebble to create the finished
vessel form. Decorations and slips were added
before, as well as after, baking in an open fire,
and commonly the vessels were then
burnished and polished; red ochre and white
kaolinite clay pigments were often added to or
painted on to the decorations on bottles and
carinated bowls. These kinds of ceramics were
designed to serve different purposes within
Caddo communities and family groups—from
that of a cooking pot to the mortuary function
of a ceremonial beaker—and this is reflected
in differences in paste, surface treatment,
firing methods, decoration, and vessel form
between the two wares.

Other types of ceramic artifacts manufactured
by prehistoric Caddo groups include ceramic
ear spools and disks, figurines, and a variety
of pipe forms (Jackson 1933:71). The earliest
types of Caddo clay pipes were plain, tubular
and cigar-shaped forms, followed by the longstem "Red River" pipes (Hoffman 1967) with
burnished and polished stems and bowls;
rectangular platform pipes and some elbow
pipe forms have also been recovered in Caddo
sites dating before 750 years B.P. (see Bruseth
and Perttula 1981; Rogers and Perttula
2004:Figure 120). The later Caddo pipe forms
in Northeast Texas are biconical and elbow
pipe forms with small bowls (< 25 mm) and
small stem diameters (< 25 mm) (see Jackson
1933:Plates 16-18).
3.1.4

The Late Caddo Period

Late Caddo period settlements in much of the
Pineywoods and Post Oak Savanna of East
Texas have been termed rural Caddo
community systems (Perttula 1992:96)
because they were distributed along secondary
streams, were widely dispersed, and because
they consisted primarily of functionally
comparable farmsteads and hamlets. Similar
kinds of rural communities occur throughout
much of the Caddoan area (Story 1982, 1990;
Jeter et al. 1989).
Only a small number of Late Caddo period
mounds are known in the region, ranging from
one to four small mounds per site, and they are
unlike the types of mound complexes typically
constructed in the major river valleys at this
time (Story 1990). Pineywoods mounds were
substructural mounds; no pyramidal platform
or burial mounds are known for this time
period. Substructural mounds are generally
restricted to mounds that cap a burned circular
structure that was constructed on the ground
surface or in a small, shallow pit. In at least
two instances, the mounds contained sequent
structures, but the "structures originated at
higher levels in the mound[s] due to
occupational accumulations of soil and ash,
and not the result of any deliberate capping"
(Thurmond 1990:168).

Technical Report No. 174202

The larger Caddo "towns" were distributed
along the major stream valleys, such as the
Red, Ouachita, and Little rivers. These
communities were hierarchically arranged
with: civic-ceremonial centers (those with
platform and burial mounds), associated
"towns" of linear but dispersed farmstead
compounds with several structures, bark- or
brush-covered shelters and storage platforms
(Schambach 1983:7-8), hamlets, farmsteads,
and specialized processing and/or procurement
locales (such as salt-making sites, see Early
1993).
The later Caddo fine wares are stylistically
diverse, and there are very specific differences
in vessel shapes, designs, and decorative
attributes between Caddo ceramics in
individual drainages, or even within specific
smaller segments of river and creek basins
(e.g., Thurmond 1990; Perttula et al. 1998).
This diversity can be reasonably interpreted to
be representative of specific Caddo social
groups. In historic Caddo times, ceramic
vessel forms and decorations are considerably
more homogeneous across much of the
Caddoan area, suggesting extensive intra­
regional contact between contemporaneous
Caddo groups (Perttula 1992:154 and Table
14).
In the upper Neches River basin, Late
Caddoan period archeological sites have been
included in the Frankston phase culturaltaxonomic unit. Frankston phase Caddo sites
are clearly ancestral to the Allen phase, an
historic Caddo cultural-taxonomic unit, and
sites of the Allen phase have been definitively
associated with one or more of the nine or
more East Texas Hasinai Caddo ethnically and
linguistically affiliated groups (cf. Rogers and
Sabo 2004; Swanton 1942).
Frankston Phase
The Frankston phase is comprised of
farmsteads, hamlets, and small villages in the
Neches and Angelina river basins that date
from ca. 300-550 years B.P. Only a single
Frankston phase mound is known, the A.C.
Saunders site (41AN19; see Jackson 1936;

31

Chapter 3: Summary of East Texas Native American Culture History

Kleinschmidt 1982) near the Neches River,
and only a few miles upstream along the river
from the Lang Pasture site. This small mound
(2.2 m in height and 26 x 33 m in length and
width) had thick ash beds and fill zones, and
probably represents a Caddo fire temple used
by the social and political elite of one
Frankston phase “affiliated groups” (Story and
Creel 1982:36 and Figure 8). South of the
mound a short distance was a large midden
deposit that capped an important (public?)
circular structure, based on its impressive size
(14 x 13 m) and several large interior hearths.
The structure was built and dismantled in the
16th century (e.g., Kleinschmidt 1982:240
seriation of Frankston phase ceramics), then
capped by the midden deposits (Kleinschmidt
1982:46). The midden deposits contained an
abundance of Caddo artifacts from apparent
residential settlement, including an estimated
1291 ceramic vessel sections (dominated by
Poynor Engraved bowls, Bullard Brushed and
Maydelle Incised jars, and LaRue Neck
Banded jars), elbow pipes, Perdiz arrow
points, stone drills, mussel shell digging tools,
an assortment of bone tools (awls, needles,
and beamers), and shell columnella beads.
Other Frankston phase sites are represented by
small residential settlements in dispersed
agricultural communities, with small family
and/or community cemeteries not used for
long periods of time (see Anderson 1972;
Anderson et al. 1974; Johnson 1961; Shafer
1981). Anderson (1972:163) notes that the
concentration of Frankston phase sites in one
section of the upper Neches River basin
comprise “base settlement clusters [with
middens, burials, and structures, likely
representing permanent settlements] on
streamside flats with fertile soils in
the...uplands. Other site types include
scattered sherds, gathering stations in which
pitted stones are found with a few sherds, and
small campsites.” The Omer and Otis Hood
cemetery with 20 burials (Kleinschmidt 1982)
is one of the larger known Frankston phase
cemeteries. Many others have less than 10
individuals (Kleinschmidt 1982:214), laid out
individually in extended supine position, with
a variety of grave goods (principally ceramic

32

vessels). In at least one instance, a Frankston
phase cemetery in the upper Neches River
basin in Smith County, Texas, contains the
burial of socially elite individuals in a family
and/or village cemetery context. This
particular burial was in a 12 foot wide pit, and
had three individuals. Among the funerary
objects placed with the multiple burial were 21
pottery vessels, a ground stone celt, and a
large chipped biface (Jowell knife); baskets or
matting were apparently also present in the
grave (Anderson 1972:139-140).
3.1.5

Historic Caddo

New assessments of the route of the de SotoMoscoso 1542-1543 entrada through East
Texas (Bruseth 1992; Hudson 1997;
Kenmotsu et al. 1993; Schambach 1989;
Thurmond 1990) indicate that the Spanish
entrada encountered several different groups
of Caddo peoples from the Red River south to
the Nacogdoches area, although the exact
route remains to be determined. Hudson
(1997:Map 8) suggests that once the entrada
entered Texas—probably in the vicinity of
Texarkana—that the Spaniards and their
Caddo guides were traveling along a definite
aboriginal trail that extended from the Red
River southwest into East Texas. The Caddo
guides did what they could to delude the
Spaniards, leading them away from the trails
and known villages, and the guides paid for
these acts when Moscoso discovered he was
being misled (Hudson 1997:368).
From Nondacao in the Sabine River basin,
which was a prosperous Caddo community
where “one could find plenty of corn”
(Hudson 1997:365), Moscoso and his men
visited Soacatino, possibly in the upper
Neches River basin, where corn was scarce,
before reaching Guasco on the Neches River,
probably near the Caddo trail crossing (now
known as the Camino Real) by the George C.
Davis site. The Caddo people in Guasco had
plenty of corn as well as turquoise and shawls
of cotton obtained in trade with Southwestern
groups. Hearing of reports by the Caddo of
other Spaniards in the area, the entrada moved
south or southeast to the Caddo provinces of

Technical Report No. 174202

Archeological Investigations at the Lang Pasture Site (41AN38) in the Upper Neches River Basin of East Texas
Texas Department of Transportation

Naquiscoza
and
Nazacahoz.
Hudson
(1997:369-370) and Kenmotsu et al.
(1993:Illustration 24 and 25) both agree that
these Caddo provinces were in the Angelina
River basin in the vicinity of the modern
community of Nacogdoches. The entrada
penetrated no farther south or east, but did
move west to the River of Daycao, probably
the modern Brazos River (Hudson 1997:Map
8).
It is possible that European diseases were
introduced to the Caddo groups living in the
East Texas Pineywoods by members of the de
Soto-Moscoso entrada (Perttula 1992:27-28),
but there is no evidence of this currently
available
in
the
archeological
or
bioarcheological records to substantiate this
hypothesis. While it is suspected that the
abandonment of certain parts of the
Pineywoods in the early to late 17th century as
seen in the archeological record may be a
product of population loss, much more
archeological investigations at well-dated sites
is warranted to substantiate disease as the
primary contributing factor. However, by the
late 17th century, Caddo groups in East Texas
had been exposed to European epidemic
diseases (Derrick and Wilson 2001; Ewers
1973; Perttula 1992, 1996), which led
eventually to substantial depopulation
(probably 75-90 percent or more) among these
Pineywoods groups by the early part of the
19th century.
In historic times, the archeology of the East
Texas Caddo groups living south and west of
the Sabine River is associated with the Allen
phase, dated from ca. 150-300 years B.P. or
later: “The Allen phase is believed to have
developed out of the Frankston phase, and
more importantly, to have shared the same
form of organization, kinds of inter-group
interaction, and settlement patterns” (Story
and Creel 1982:34). The groups who, during
the Allen phase. occupied the Neches and
Angelina river basins were direct ancestors of
the Hasinai tribes who were living in or near
the Spanish missions established in the region
between ca. 1691-1772, and they continued to
maintain residence there until the 1830s.

Technical Report No. 174202

Story and Creel (1982:32) suggest that the
Frankston and Allen phase populations were
organized in a “weakly hierarchical structure”
analogous to the Hasinai confederacy (see
Swanton 1942). Allen phase components are
found in the Neches and Angelina river basins
in Cherokee, Anderson, Houston, Rusk, and
Nacogdoches counties (see Cole 1975;
Kenmotsu 1992; Perttula and Nelson 2006,
2007; Story 1982, 1995), and usually contain
small amounts of European trade goods found
in village and burial contexts. Caddo domestic
remains at these settlements included a variety
of decorated and plain ceramic fine wares
(principally Patton Engraved) and utility
wares, usually bone-tempered and with
brushed vessel bodies, triangular and stemmed
arrow points, elbow pipes (plain and
decorated), ground stone tools, and bone tools.
These Caddo groups were successful
agriculturists.
Excavations at the Deshazo site (41NA13), the
best studied Allen phase settlement (Story
1982, 1995), indicates it was a small
centralized hamlet of an affiliated group with a
series of circular structures and an associated
household or family cemetery. Most sites were
apparently occupied for only short periods of
time, perhaps an average of 20 to 40 years,
based on an analysis of structure rebuilding
episodes at the Deshazo site (Good 1982:67­
69).
While a single farmstead may have only
included one or two structures, Caddo
communities were apparently composed of
many farmsteads spread out over a
considerable distance. In 1687, in the
community of Nabedache Caddo (one of the
Hasinai groups) on San Pedro Creek in
Houston County, Henri Joutel noted:
we took the path to the village where
the Indians conducted us to the chief’s
hut which was a long league’s
distance from the entrance to the
village. On the way, we passed several
huts that were grouped in hamlets;
there were seven or eight of them,
each with twelve to fifteen huts

33

Chapter 3: Summary of East Texas Native American Culture History

together with space between each
other and fields around the huts
(Foster 1998:206).
Morfi (1935:87) further commented (based on
earlier missionary reports) that in 1716, the
Nacogdoche Indians were “divided into 22
rancherias...which spread for a distance of 10
leagues from South to North.”
Individual Hasinai Caddo families lived in
their farmsteads, several of which have been
archeologically investigated in Nacogdoches
County (Story 1982, 1995; Kenmotsu 1992),
and a number of farmsteads were organized
into rancherias spread out over about 15 to 30
leagues (about 40 to 80 miles). Each rancheria
was separated from the others by unoccupied
lands (see Foster 1998:208) and hunting
territory.

34

There are other clusters of historic Caddo
archeological sites in East Texas. Among
these are a series of probable early 18th
century Nasoni Caddo sites on the lower
Sulphur River (Dickinson 1941; Harris et al.
1980; Lewis 1987), along a known trade
portage. Late 18th to early 19th century Nadaco
or Anadarko Caddo sites have been reported
along the Sabine River in the Potters Creek
area, along trail crossings of this stream (Jones
1968; Clark and Ivey 1974). Along the Red
River in Bowie County, there are
archeological remains of Nasoni Caddo and
other Kadohadacho tribes that lived in the area
until the late 1780s (Miroir et al. 1973;
Gilmore 1986; Wedel 1978); the French built
a trading post in the early 18th century at the
main
Nasoni
village,
probably
the
Roseborough Lake site (41BW5). In the upper
Sabine River basin and the Tyler District, the
Gilbert and Pearson sites (Duffield and Jelks
1961; Jelks 1967) were occupied primarily in
the mid- to late 18th centuries, apparently by
Caddo groups that were heavily involved in
the fur trade (Perttula 1992:173, 256).

and Bruce M. Albert
4.1

INTRODUCTION

The primary focus of the research is on
prehistoric Caddo households and settlement
systems in this part of the upper Neches River
basin. This is based on (1) the kinds of
archeological deposits that the site contained;
and (2) important research issues for
prehistoric Caddo sites in this part of East
Texas (see Kenmotsu and Perttula 1993:121­
146) that are relevant for the Lang Pasture site
(41AN38) investigations. This research design
was written prior to initiation of data recovery
work at the site, and was intemded to serve as
a guide for that work.
4.2

LOCAL CADDO RESEARCH
CONTEXT

The Lang Pasture site is situated in a part of
the upper Neches River valley that is known
as one of the principal areas settled by
prehistoric and historic Caddo groups that are
identified archeologically as the Frankston (ca.
A.D. 1400-1650) and Allen (ca. A.D. 1650­
1750) phases (see Story and Creel 1982:29-32;
Kleinschmidt
1982).
Earlier
Caddo
occupations are not as well known in this area,
but small habitation sites predating A.D. 1400
have been identified by Anderson et al. (1974)
and Kleinschmidt (1982). The 2004 testing
work at the Lang Pasture site suggested to us
that the site was occupied during the early part
of the Frankston phase (Lohse 2004:42-44),
perhaps from ca. A.D. 1400-1450, although
the chronological context of the Caddo
occupation needed better resolution.

Technical Report No. 174202

Much of the previous archeological work on
Caddo sites on the upper Neches was done in
the 1930s and focused almost exclusively on
the excavation of cemeteries (see Guy
1990:Table 3; see also Campbell 1936; Cole
1975). One such nearby cemetery in the Caney
Branch Creek valley is the Mrs. J. M. Cook
site (41AN1) (see Figure 3-1), although there
are a number of important known Caddo
cemetery and habitation sites that we think are
generally contemporaneous with the Lang
Pasture site in this part of the upper Neches
River valley.
The present site is located on an upland toe
slope overlooking the Caney Branch Creek
valley. Caney Branch Creek is a small
tributary to the Neches River, and joins with it
about 10 km downstream from the site (see
Figure 3-1). Major excavations were also
conducted in the early 1930s at the A. C.
Saunders (41AN19) mound center (Jackson
1936; Kleinschmidt 1982) (see Figure 3-1)—
built and used during much of the Frankston
phase according to Kleinschmidt (1982)—but
there was a dearth of work done in habitation
deposits (other than occasionally trenching a
trash midden deposit). Story (2000:13) has
noted that “none of the [Frankston phase]
sites…has been extensively investigated nor
well dated and much of the information comes
from excavations made in the early and middle
1930s.”
In more recent times, archeological work in
this part of the upper Neches River basin has
taken place at or near Lake Palestine, a few
miles to the north of the Lang Pasture site,
where a number of primarily Late Caddo

35

Chapter 4: Research Design

Frankston phase sites have been investigated
(Anderson et al. 1974; Cliff et al. 2004;
Gilmore 1983; Shafer 1981) (see Figure 3-1).
Here too, however, the work was not
specifically directed towards identifying and
studying habitation features or the layout of
Caddo settlements/households, and it was
primarily successful only in the identification
of trash midden deposits and their contents, or
in salvaging the contents of a disturbed Late
Caddo burial (i.e., Shafer 1981).
On Caddo habitation sites, “most excavations
have been too limited to permit accurate
characterization of the settlement size and
structure, and sometimes even its history of
use” (Story 1990:334). While there have been
more extensive archeological investigations of
Caddo habitation sites more recently in some
parts of northeastern Texas (but not including
the upper Neches River basin), the fact
remains that our understanding of the basic
character of prehistoric and early historic
Caddo
households,
settlements,
and
communities is still poor. This is as true for
Caddo habitation sites in the upper part of the
Neches River basin as it is in any part of
northeastern Texas, and points out where the
basic importance of the investigations at the
Lang Pasture site lay.
4.3

RESEARCH ISSUES

The development of the research issues
guiding the Lang Pasture site archeological
data recovery was shaped by several factors.
First was a preliminary set of issues identified
by Ricklis and Perttula (2004:62-63) in the
interim report on the test excavations. These
focused on intra-site planning and use of
activity spaces; the range of non-structural
features (including the placement of human
burials at the site), and chronology (including
establishing the duration of occupation and the
age range of the prehistoric Caddo
component). We also took into consideration
comments and suggestions offered by TxDOT
during their review of the interim report.
Another important factor was the results of the
data recovery excavations, summarized in an
interim report submitted to TxDOT (Kelley et

36

al. 2004). Finally, we incorporated relevant
parts of the broad research problems framed
by Kenmotsu and Perttula (1993:136-141) in
the Historic Context “The Development of
Agriculture in Northeast Texas before A.D.
1600” for the Northeast Texas archeological
region preservation plan.
4.4

CULTURAL CHRONOLOGY

A few radiocarbon and Oxidizable Carbon
Ratio (OCR) dates had already been obtained
from the site, but the results were
contradictory with each other, as well as with
the independent chronological estimates
obtained from the examination of the
decorated ceramic sherds, vessels, and pipes.
We hoped to clarify this situation during the
data recovery excavations by using multiple
dating techniques on samples from carefully
selected contexts.
The general research question concerned
establishing the age of the occupations at the
site. To answer this question we proposed to
submit samples of ceramics and charred plant
remains from undisturbed feature contexts for
radiocarbon (charred plant remains and
ceramics),
and
thermoluminescence
(ceramics) dating. Up to 60 samples were to
be submitted for radiocarbon dating analysis.
In most cases these were to be composed of
either charred hickory nutshells or charred
corn cupules from the flotation of feature fill
at Lang Pasture. Depending upon the context
of recovery and the inferred association, 5-10
of the radiocarbon samples could be directly
on sherds themselves.
Based on the initial analyses of the ceramics
and lithics there were suggestions of time
depth within the Caddo occupation in both
data sets, and in the case of the ceramics the
temporal differences seemed to correlate with
the two house structures identified in the rightof-way. By carefully selecting radiocarbon
and thermoluminescence samples from
features associated with these structures we
hoped to be able to determine their age and to
address the question of the duration of the
Caddo occupation of the site. This intensive

Technical Report No. 174202

Archeological Investigations at the Lang Pasture Site (41AN38) in the Upper Neches River Basin of East Texas
Texas Department of Transportation

dating effort could contribute to a better
understanding of the cultural chronology of
the local region. This is because few sites have
any number of absolute dates or have been
thoroughly investigated (see Kleinschmidt
1982; Story 1990, 2000; Story and Creel
1982).
In the absence or near absence of datable
charred organic materials from certain
contexts at the Lang Pasture site, the
thermoluminescence (TL) dating of ceramic
sherds is important in establishing the absolute
age of the Caddo occupation or occupations at
the site. In order to insure that TL dates were
obtained on diagnostic ceramic sherds, the
samples we proposed for TL dating were all
decorated sherds. Decorated sherds are the
most temporally diagnostic because they can
be associated with specific styles of ceramic
vessel decoration that are known or suspected
to
have
both
chronological
and
social/community significance.
The samples we proposed for TL dating
analysis consist of 23 sherds, including five
engraved fine wares and 18 sherds from
decorated utility wares. The relative
proportion of fine wares to utility wares in the
TL sample was 22% and 78%, respectively,
virtually identical to the proportions of such
wares (23% and 77%, respectively) in the
larger decorated sherd assemblage from Lang
Pasture (Kelley et al. 2006: Table 3-2).
Consequently, there would be no obvious
selection biases in the TL sample proposed for
TL dating from the Lang Pasture site, as no
one ware was favored in the selection sample
over another; the consequences of employing
TL dating on both high and low-fired ceramics
are unknown at this point (James Feathers,
personal communication, 2010).
The sherd samples we proposed for TL dating
are listed below (Table 4-1). The kinds of
decorated sherds represented in the proposed

Technical Report No. 174202

TL sample were consistent with the range of
decorative methods and elements found in the
over 2400 decorated sherds examined for the
preparation of the Lang Pasture site interim
report.
Because the majority of the proposed TL
sample available from the Lang Pasture site
investigations came from archeological
deposits associated with Structure 2 in the
southern part of the block excavations (n=19),
compared to only four TL samples from the
Structure 1 area, the TL dating of sherds
would not be sufficient by itself to establish
the age of features and archeological deposits
across the entirety of the block excavations.
Fortunately there were available dateable
materials from features in both the northern
and southern parts of the Lang Pasture site
block excavation to provide an independent
means of chronological information on the age
of the prehistoric Caddo occupation, and we
could also rely on the diagnostic decorated
ceramic vessel sherds from 21 different
features (Kelley et al. 2006:Table 3-3) to link
TL dates on similar styles of decorated sherds
as well as radiocarbon dates from some of
these features containing more than 300
diagnostic decorated vessel sherds.
As a further aid to establishing the age of the
deposits at the Lang Pasture site, we proposed
to submit samples of sediment from the site
for Optically Stimulated Luminescence (OSL)
dating. This dating technique is applicable to
quartz and feldspar-rich sediments that are
otherwise often not dateable.
Like
thermoluminescence it involves exposing a
sample to light or heat and measuring the
amount of light emitted, which is proportional
to the total amount of radiation that had
accumulated since the sample was last
exposed to heat.
An age can then be
calculated by dividing the total accumulated
dose by an estimated annual dose. Analyses
can be run on multiple or single quartz grains.

We proposed to submit 27 samples from the
Lang Pasture site for single grain OSL
analysis by the Sheffield Centre for
International Drylands Research at the
University of Sheffield, England.
The
samples were collected at 5 cm intervals from
two columns. One of the columns was located
at N197.5 E198 near the northernmost
structure identified at the site. The other
column was located in the burial area at
N215.5 E198. By dating closely spaced
samples from these two areas of the site it
might be possible to determine if the
sediments in both areas were deposited at the
time of the prehistoric Caddo occupation,
helping to determine if the Caddo structural

38

remains
and
burial
features
are
contemporaneous. The results of the single
grain OSL dating, particularly if the dates
were anomalously old or young or did not
occur in stratigraphic sequence, should also
allow an assessment of the extent of any
natural disturbance (i.e., bioturbation) of the
archeological deposits at the site. These
results in turn might have implications for the
research potential of certain archeological
materials not recovered from feature contexts
at the site, particularly considerations of the
horizontal and vertical patterning of materials
in the prehistoric Caddo component at the
Lang Pasture site.

CADDO SETTLEMENT SYSTEMS
AND HOUSEHOLDS

In a comprehensive review of prehistoric and
historic Caddo archeology in 1990, Dee Ann
Story
(1990:336)
noted,
“the
most
fundamental building blocks of the Caddoan
settlement system—the household and
community—are poorly understood.” She
attributed this to the limited scale of most
excavations of Caddo habitation sites (Story
1990:334).
Our research attempted to address two
questions: what was the internal organization
of the Caddo settlement at the Lang Pasture
site, and how did it differ from that of other
settlements in this region or other parts of the
Caddoan Area? The first question was
examined
by
developing
functional
interpretations of the features identified based
on morphology, artifact content, and
ethnohistoric and historic information
available on Hasinai Caddo groups living in
the Neches River basin in the seventeenth and
eighteenth centuries (see Foster 1998;
Swanton 1942). If the chronometric and
artifact data indicated that there was
measurable time depth within the Caddo
occupation, then we would also search for
indications of change through time in the
organization of the settlement.

All that work was done in the 1930s. More
recently, but still more than 30 years ago,
excavations at a number of Late Caddo
Frankston phase habitation sites at Lake
Palestine (the Debro, William Sherman, Forest
Drive, Halbert, Woldert, Ferguson, and
Tomato Patch sites) focused on the
excavations of midden deposits (Anderson et
al. 1974), but unfortunately that research effort
was based on the incorrect impression that
midden deposits at these sites represented the
remains of structures, when in fact the midden
deposits were concentrated areas of trash and
domestic refuse (see Jackson 1933a).
Consequently, no substantive information was
obtained from the Lake Palestine sites on
structures or the kinds of activities that may
have taken place outside of and around the
structures themselves.

In order to address the second question, the
data from the Lang Pasture site were
compared to that from other sites in the upper
Neches River basin and elsewhere in the
Caddoan archeological area. Our efforts in
this regard were enhanced by the examination
of available settlement-level information from
contemporaneous sites in the Texas
Archeological Research Laboratory files (see
Figure 3-1), along with excavated Frankston
phase and earlier Caddo sites at or near Lake
Palestine (Anderson et al. 1974).

The 1930s excavations by the University of
Texas—while
focusing
on
Caddo
cemeteries—often did note the location and
general size of habitation deposits and/or
midden deposits found on these same sites
relative to cemetery settings. Middens tended
to range between 25-600 m2 in size,
suggesting considerable variation in the length
and intensity of the Caddo occupations, as
well as the size of the various settlements.
Excavations at the midden at the Emma
Owens site (41AN21) encountered a large and
deep pit (more than 1 m in diameter and
depth) along the edge of the midden (Cole
1975) that on first glance sounds very much
like several of the large pit features at the
Lang Pasture site. We can only speculate
about the settlement organizational meaning of
these midden deposits since none were
systematically or carefully excavated, if they
were examined at all. Presently, other than at
the Lang Pasture site, we do not know the
spatial
relationship
between
domestic
structures, middens, and cemeteries on upper
Neches River basin Caddo sites.

Archeological investigations in the past in the
upper Neches River basin have focused on the
identification and excavation of Caddo burial
sites and cemeteries (Jackson 1931, 1933a;
Pearce and Woolsey 1935; Woolsey 1935a-n).

The somewhat sketchy information from the
University of Texas work at least provides an
indication that prehistoric Caddo cemeteries in
the upper Neches River basin occur in
association with habitation deposits, although

Technical Report No. 174202

39

Chapter 4: Research Design

they might be separated by several hundred
meters from each other. In most cases where
information is available from the 1930s
investigations, cemetery areas tend to be
situated between a water source and the
habitation areas, as at Lang Pasture. Their
direction from the habitation areas runs the
gamut from north to south and east to west,
but habitation areas tend to be located north of
cemeteries on Allen phase sites (Cole 1975),
while earlier Frankston phase habitation areas
were established south, southwest, and west of
cemeteries, again as at Lang Pasture, although
this is not always the case (cf. Shafer 1981).
This geographic landscape patterning in the
placement of cemetery and habitation areas
may have significance to the prehistoric
Caddo communities living in the upper
Neches River basin with respect to their
cosmology, mortuary ritual and its symbolic
meaning, and Caddo views on directionality,
life, and death (Kay and Sabo 2006:32-33).
It is very difficult, consequently, to compare
the organization of the prehistoric Caddo
settlement at the Lang Pasture site (i.e.,
circular structures, ramadas or work platforms
outside structures, large pits, cemetery, and
midden
deposits)
with
generally
contemporaneous Caddo sites in the upper
Neches River basin because habitation
deposits have never been the focus of previous
investigations, or if they were, the excavation
effort was misguided (cf. Anderson et al.
1974). The only documented Caddo structure
in the upper Neches River basin is a 14 m
diameter circular structure at the A.C.
Saunders site (41AN19), but its large size and
location under a deliberately constructed
mound (albeit constructed with midden
deposits) indicates it was not a domestic
habitation structure like Structures 1 and 2 at
Lang Pasture. Recent remote sensing work
carried out at the A. C. Saunders site by the
Texas Archeological Research Laboratory,
The University of Texas at Austin may contain
relevant archeological information on
settlement organization around the mounds at
this site, although this information has not
been published to date.

40

For this reason we turned our attention to
related (culturally, but not necessarily
temporally) Caddo sites in the NechesAngelina River basin to determine how the
site organization of the Lang Pasture site (or at
least that part of the site within the boundaries
of the SH 155 right-of-way) compared with
other generally contemporaneous East Texas
Caddo groups. Specifically, the welldocumented plan of circular structures (some
overlapping and repeatedly rebuilt), open
plaza area, and communal midden at the
Deshazo site (41NA27) is relevant (Story and
Creel 1982), as are structural features and
village planning data from the Late Village at
the Oak Hill Village site in Rusk County,
Texas (Perttula and Rogers 2007), where
occupation ended at ca. A.D. 1450. The spatial
layout and relationship of structures, middens,
and cemeteries—as well as outdoor working
areas—are known from recent archeological
and remote sensing work at Lake Naconiche in
the Attoyac Bayou basin on three sites
(41NA231, 41NA235, and 41NA242) that
were occupied during the fourteenth and
fifteenth centuries (Perttula [ed.] 2008a).
4.6

SUBSISTENCE SYSTEMS

The sample of macrobotanical remains
recovered during the data recovery
excavations at the Lang Pasture site was
relatively small, but the material recovered in
flotation samples from features appeared to be
well preserved and could therefore provide
important data on Caddoan plant utilization in
this region. The research questions that could
be addressed were, how important was plant
food production in the Caddo subsistence
strategy at Lang Pasture, and how did this
strategy compare to that of contemporary sites
in this region or other regions? The ubiquity
and density of plant remains in feature
flotation samples provided one measure of
plant food utilization. Features were selected
for analysis on the basis of a range of factors,
including the presence of charred plant
material in the flotation sample, the volume of
the feature and flotation sample, and the
presence of diagnostic artifacts or dateable
material from the feature. A list of samples

Technical Report No. 174202

Archeological Investigations at the Lang Pasture Site (41AN38) in the Upper Neches River Basin of East Texas
Texas Department of Transportation

proposed for analysis is presented in Table 4­
2.
In order to address the second question the
data on subsistence from the Lang Pasture site
were compared to that from previously
excavated Caddo sites in this region or other
parts of the Caddoan area. Presently there are
limited data on floral remains from late Caddo
sites in the upper Neches River basin, other
than the recovery of some incidental charcoal
and nutshells. One notable exception is site
41CE354 (Perttula and Nelson 2007), located
a few miles northeast of Lang Pasture on Flat
Creek, a tributary to the Neches River.

Its
well-preserved
floral
assemblage,
recovered in flotation and fine-screen samples,
included maize, beans, hickory nuts, black
walnut, goosefoot/pigweed seeds, and legume
seeds (Perttula and Nelson 2007). This Caddo
habitation site dates after ca. A.D. 1650. By
this time, the Caddo peoples living in the
upper Neches River basin depended upon
cultivated plants in their diet, but also
supplemented that diet with hardwood mast
and wild seeds. How much earlier such a
subsistence strategy had evolved among the
Caddo can be addressed with recovered plant
remains from the Lang Pasture site and stable
carbon isotope analyses from the Lang Pasture
and other nearby Caddo cemetery sites.

Other possibilities for comparative data for the
plant remains from the Lang Pasture site
include several Late Caddo Titus phase
assemblages in the Cypress Creek basin
recently summarized by Dering (2005), and
the Middle Caddo Oak Hill Village
assemblage also analyzed by Dering (2004).
The samples of vertebrate and invertebrate
faunal remains recovered in the data recovery
excavations were small and poorly preserved.
They were of limited use for addressing
questions of faunal exploitation at the site.
4.7

LOCAL AND EXTRA-LOCAL
TRADE AND EXCHANGE

Our research attempted to address two related
questions concerning trade during the Caddo
occupation at the Lang Pasture site: What
goods were obtained through trade, and how
was trade organized? The first question was
examined through a combination of
instrumental neutron activation analysis
(INAA) of Caddo ceramics at Lang Pasture,
and identification and quantification of nonlocal lithic raw materials and other exotic
goods that may be preserved. The latter
analysis focused on temporally diagnostic
artifacts or samples of debitage from features
that could be associated with the Caddo
occupation through the presence of diagnostic
artifacts or radiometric dates.
INAA studies of Caddo sherds from
temporally reliable archeological contexts
throughout northeastern Texas, have provided
useful information on assessing the
compositional diversity of different ceramic
assemblages, determining if compositional
groups are associated with specific vessel
forms and decorative elements, and
establishing if the ceramic compositional
variation at sites changed over time, and thus
reflect differing ceramic resource exploitation
strategies or vessel movement patterns (Neff
and Glascock 2000; Descantes et al. 2003;
Perttula 2002). At least 10 ceramic chemical
groups have recently (as of 2007) been defined
through INAA from more than 100 sites
throughout East Texas and surrounding parts

42

of the Caddoan archeological area, including
the Smith chemical group in the upper Neches
and Angelina River basins (i.e., parts of
Anderson, Cherokee, and Smith counties).
If the instrumental neutron activation analysis
(INAA) of ceramic vessel sherds from the
Lang Pasture site and other generally
contemporaneous prehistoric Caddo sites in
the upper Neches River basin were successful
in identifying distinct chemical composition
groups in ceramic vessel sherds selected for
analysis, then we would have for the first time
a quantifiable measure of the amount of nonlocal ceramic vessels (and some indication of
their manufacturing source area) that occur in
Frankston phase Caddo sites in this part of
East Texas. We recognized that the INAA
study of upper Neches River Caddo ceramic
vessel sherds was a pilot effort because no
INAA has been conducted on any upper
Neches River basin Caddo sites (although
more than 900 sherds have been subjected to
INAA in East Texas since the mid-1990s), but
INAA results obtained to date (cf. Perttula
2002:Figure 5.2) have successfully identified
several distinct Caddo ceramic chemical
groups in the region. The differences in the
geographic distribution of these Caddo
ceramic chemical groups—combined with
stylistic analyses of the decorated Caddo
vessel sherds subjected to INAA—have
permitted
the
identification
of
the
compositional nature of locally made vs. nonlocally made ceramic wares. The Lang Pasture
INAA analyses would extend those findings to
the upper Neches River basin for the first time.
In selecting 50 sherds from the Lang Pasture
site for INAA, several considerations were
paramount: (1) that the sherd was large
enough to identify decorative elements on
them, whether they were fine wares (i.e.,
engraved and red-slipped vessel sherds) or
utility wares (i.e., wet-paste decorated sherds
and plain ware rims); (2) that both fine wares,
utility wares, and plain wares were sampled
for INAA so we will be able to assess the
amounts of possible non-local ceramic vessel
sherds among each of the three ceramic wares
at the site; and (3) the sherds selected for

Technical Report No. 174202

Texas Department of Transportation

INAA come from the areas of Structures 1 and
2 and the various pit features outside of the
structures.
We also selected sherds for INAA in
proportion to the frequency of decorated

sherds across the northern and southern parts
of the sites (and presumably associated with
Structures 1 and 2), the frequency of decorated
sherds from features, and the frequency of
plain rim sherds. A list of sherds proposed for
INAA is presented in Table 4-3.

We also wanted to be able to compare the
chemical compositional group profiles
between the Structure 1 and Structure 2
ceramic vessel sherds. Thus, of the proposed
INAA sample of decorated ceramic sherds not
from features (n=44 sherds), 23 of them were
from Structure 1 (N190-196 E198-199) and
spatially archeological deposits around it,
while the remaining 21 INAA sherds are from
Structure 2 (N175-184 E198-200) and
spatially associated archeological deposits.

understanding the occurrence of INAAdefined and chemically distinct ceramic wares
at the Lang Pasture site, we submitted another
50 sherds for INAA from nearby and generally
contemporaneous
(based
on
earlier
examinations of TARL records on known sites
and associated ceramic vessel and vessel sherd
collections) Caddo sites in the upper Neches
River basin (see Figure 3-1). There are 10 sites
in the TARL collections that have decorated
sherd collections from domestic contexts on
ca. A.D. 1400 and later Caddo sites in the
general area of the Lang Pasture site (41AN1,

44

41AN2, 41AN8, 41AN14, 41AN23, 41AN32,
41CE3, 41CE4, 41CE8, and 41CE17). It is
from that sample of more than 530 decorated
sherds from these 10 sites that we selected
additional INAA samples to develop a broader
regional chemical profile of Caddo ceramic
vessel sherds found in habitation contexts.
To help in developing the selection of
additional INAA samples for this project from
sites in the TARL collection, it was necessary
to physically examine the sherd collections
(albeit quickly) to make sure that suitable
samples of decorated Caddo vessel sherds
actually existed from these nearby sites. We
were interested in examining the chemical
composition of both fine wares and the range
of utility wares known to be present on ca.
A.D. 1400 Caddo sites in the upper Neches
River basin to provide a window on the extent
and direction of exchange that may have
existed at that time, so we focused on
assembling a proposed INAA sample from the
TARL collections that have both engraved
fine wares as well as incised, brushed,
pinched, tool punctated, brushed-punctated,

Technical Report No. 174202

Archeological Investigations at the Lang Pasture Site (41AN38) in the Upper Neches River Basin of East Texas
Texas Department of Transportation

brushed-appliqued,
brushed-incised,
and
neckbanded utility wares. The same kinds of
stylistically diverse fine wares and utility
wares are present at 41AN38, and were
selected for INAA.
We proposed to do INAA on decorated sherds
(both fine wares, n=20, and utility wares,
n=30) from nine of the 10 TARL sites listed
above, and we excluded 41AN2 because it did
not have suitably large or stylistically
diagnostic decorated sherds in the small
collection available at TARL. The list of 50
decorated sherds submitted for INAA from
TARL sites is provided in Table 4-4.
The second question—concerning how the
trade was organized—was addressed through
the use of models derived from ethnohistoric
information on trade among the Caddo and
ethnographic data on exchange in primitive
societies.
Specifically we attempted to
distinguish between reciprocal exchange and
redistribution by examining the types of goods
being exchanged and their distribution within
the site. Ethnographic data summarized by
Pires-Ferreira and Flannery (1976) suggest
that under conditions of reciprocity there is
considerable variability in the distribution of
non-local utilitarian commodities, such as
lithic raw materials, between households.
However, if the exchange is being controlled
by a chiefly authority, there should be more
uniformity in the distribution of utilitarian
commodities, but marked variability in the
distribution of non-utilitarian or exotic goods.
The data from the features associated with the
two households at the Lang Pasture site would

Technical Report No. 174202

be compared to the expectations derived from
these models.
4.8

MATERIAL CULTURE OF THE
FRANKSTON PHASE CADDO
PEOPLES

The available data from what are identified as
Frankston phase occupations in the upper
Neches River basin suggest that there was
considerable variability in the ceramic
assemblages in this region. The causes of this
diversity, whether temporal, cultural, or
functional, are not presently clear, and this
constituted one of the research questions that
we proposed to address using the artifact data
from the Lang Pasture site. In order to
examine this question a series of comparisons
were made with archeological data from other
prehistoric Caddo occupations in the region
that
are
thought
to
be
generally
contemporaneous with the Lang Pasture
occupation(s). Temporal control was provided
by using the available chronometric and
stratigraphic information to order the
assemblages. Functional variability was
limited by only comparing domestic
assemblages with other domestic assemblages
and mortuary assemblages with other
mortuary assemblages. Since the Lang Pasture
site has both kinds of assemblages, this
allowed a broader examination of the material
culture in use by the Caddo residents of the
site. Finally, contemporary assemblages
(established through independent measures)
from different localities within the region were
compared with one another to determine if
intra-regional cultural differences are a
significant factor in explaining the diversity.

Archeological Investigations at the Lang Pasture Site (41AN38) in the Upper Neches River Basin of East Texas
Texas Department of Transportation

The ceramic sherds, lithic tools, lithic debris,
and other domestic artifacts in the Late Caddo
component could contribute new and
important archeological information on the
stylistic, technological, and functional
character of an artifact assemblage on a
prehistoric Caddo residential settlement
(Kenmotsu and Perttula 1993:SU 8,
Technological Change and SU 9, Material
Culture). So too could the funerary objects
placed as offerings with the burials of Caddo
adults and children. These remains were the
means by which plant and animal resources
were procured, processed, cooked, and stored,
and as an integrated assemblage express the
underlying nature of Caddo adaptations to the
prehistoric environments of the upper Neches
River basin. From these sorts of data, answers
were sought in the analysis about how the
Caddo peoples at the Lang Pasture site
processed and cooked wild and domesticated
plant foods and an assortment of animal foods,
and how the ceramic vessels were actually
used. Furthermore, the funerary offerings
represent, in a symbolic and material sense,
the items used by that individual in life, as
well as goods needed to accompany the
deceased on their journey to the other world.
The distinctive ceramics here, with many
brushed sherds from apparent cooking vessels,
also share stylistic similarities with other
prehistoric Caddo settlements in northeastern
Texas (as do the arrow points), all dating after
ca. A.D. 1200. In combination with INAA
analysis of clay pastes, the detailed
examination of ceramic decorative motifs and
vessel forms (cf. Kleinschmidt 1982:97-192)
could shed considerable light on the nature of
interaction with contemporaneous Caddo
groups in the local and broader region,
because it is quite probable that variations in
vessel forms and design combinations “are
evident within drainage segments and likely
represent maps of distinct sociopolitical
groups” (Early 2000:127). We are looking for
temporal and spatial patterning in the kinds
and frequencies of vessel forms and
decorations in the local area.

Technical Report No. 174202

Ceramics were the most abundant kind of
artifact recovered during the archeological
investigations at the Lang Pasture site, and our
study of the material culture of Frankston
phase Caddo peoples focused on this class of
manufactured goods. The analysis of the
ceramic artifacts, as well as our efforts to
place the Caddo occupations at the Lang
Pasture site in time as well as space (i.e., its
relationship to other sites in the local
community and to other communities),
profited by specific stylistic and technological
comparisons (i.e., decorative elements and
motifs, use of certain kinds of tempering
agents, methods of firing, etc.) that were made
with Late Caddo sherd and vessel assemblages
at Lake Palestine and other local upper Neches
River basin sites (see Figure 3-1 and
Kleinschmidt 1982:213-228).
These comparisons of the composition of
upper Neches River basin Caddo decorated
sherd assemblages—and the temporal
orderings and cultural affiliations they
imply—are based on the percentage of
brushed sherds in the decorated sherd sample,
the percentage of bone temper in the
assemblages, the percentage of wet-paste
decorations other than brushing (i.e., incised,
punctated, appliqued, neck-banded, etc.), the
plain/decorated sherd ratio (P/DR), and the
brushed sherd/wet paste decorated sherd ratio
(Table 4-5). From these comparisons, five
different groups of assemblages were defined
in a seriation of the Lake Palestine sites. These
groups seem to reflect temporal changes due
to the high frequency of Late Caddo Frankston
phase decorated types, such as Poynor
Engraved, Maydelle Incised, Bullard Brushed,
Hume Engraved, and engraved effigy vessels,
that are found in the Groups I-III sites—which
includes the Lang Pasture site—and the
occurrence of Early and Middle Caddo types
such as Canton Incised, Dunkin Incised, Holly
Fine Engraved, and Pennington PunctatedIncised in the Group IV and V Lake Palestine
sites (see Anderson et al. 1974; Gilmore
1983); no Sanders phase pottery types (i.e.,
Sanders Engraved, Monkstown Fingernail
Impressed, Maxey Noded Redware) were
recovered in the Lake Palestine sites.

Furthermore, it has been shown in several
other ceramic studies in northeastern Texas
that the proportion of brushed sherds in
decorated
sherd
assemblages
steadily
increases through time, beginning after ca.
A.D. 1250 (and after the principal Early
Caddo occupation at the George C. Davis
site), and by the late seventeenth and
eighteenth centuries Caddo sites are known in
the Neches and Angelina river basins
(including Deshazo) where brushed sherds
account for 50-90 percent of the decorated
pottery.
If the sherd assemblage data from the Lake
Palestine
sites
have
chronological
significance, and we suspect they do, then it is
possible to seriate the decorated ceramic sherd
assemblage from areas within the Lang
Pasture site, and we can then independently
establish their chronology and intra-site
temporal relationships through radiocarbon
and TL dating. Furthermore, Kleinschmidt’s

48

(1982:Table 19) seriation of Frankston and
Allen phase vessel assemblages from mortuary
contexts can be refined and reworked using
the vessels from mortuary contexts at the Lang
Pasture site if we are able to establish through
absolute dating the age of the burials at the
site. This particular seriation, with three
temporal groupings of Frankston phase sites
with burials, is based on differences in (a) the
proportions of Poynor Engraved varieties,
Patton Engraved, engraved effigy vessels,
Maydelle Incised, La Rue Neck Banded, and
Bullard Brushed, (b) differences in the relative
frequencies of common vessel forms in
Poynor and Patton Engraved vessels
(Kleinschmidt 1982:Figure 24), as well as (c)
the occurrence of European trade goods.
The Lang Pasture ceramics were made by
prehistoric Caddo peoples that lived in
communities in this part of the upper Neches
River basin that shared a common tradition or
practice of ceramic manufacture, use, and

decorative styles. To understand the place of
the Lang Pasture Caddo settlement in the local
community, as well as the scope of the local
community (i.e., constituent and affiliated
groups), an aspect of our proposed study of the
ceramics from the site included detailed
comparisons (cf. Campbell 1936; Cole 1975;
Kleinschmidt 1982) of decorative motifs and
vessel forms in the collections of fine wares
and utility wares from other nearby and
broadly contemporaneous Caddo sites in the
upper Neches River basin (see Figure 3-1).
The sites shown in Figure 3-1 are those that
have collections of whole vessels from
mortuary contexts as well as quantities of
decorated sherds from midden contexts. The
collections at TARL that will be most relevant
for mortuary comparisons of material culture
include Mrs. J. M. Cook (41AN1, 35 vessels);
J. M. Cook (41AN2, 17 vessels); E. W. Henry
(41CE17, 31 vessels); R. J. Fair (41CE25, 27
vessels); Mrs. J. W. Blackburn (41CE4, 25
vessels), Fred McKee (41AN32, 21 vessels),
and Omer and Otis Hood site (41CE14, 119
vessels). TARL collections of sherds from
Caddo middens in the local area include the E.
W. Henry (41CE17), R. J. Fair (41CE25), J.
M. Snow (41CE8), Mrs. J. W. Blackburn
(41CE4), Solon Stanley (41CE3), Fred McKee
(41AN32), Omer and Otis Hood (41CE14),
Stephens Farm (41AN16), and Isabel-Gene
Donnell (41AN14) sites.
As part of documenting the material culture of
the Caddo inhabitants living at the Lang
Pasture site, and characterizing the diversity in
domestic and mortuary ceramic assemblages
in existence around ca. A.D. 1400-1450, the
following tasks were proposed for completion:

Recordation form will be completed
for each vessel; an example of the
form is included below. This will
include Vessels 1-7 (Feature 8);
Vessel 1-2 (Feature 76B; Vessel 1,
Feature 76C; Vessel 1, Feature 76D;
Vessel 1-2 (Feature 88); Vessel 1-2
(Feature 91); Vessel 1-2 (Feature 92);
Vessel 1-9 (Feature 93); and Vessel 1­
5 (Feature 94). The vessel recordation
form includes attributes that address
the
morphological,
techno­
logical/functional,
and
stylistic
character of the prehistoric Caddo
pottery vessels from the Lang Pasture
burials. This information can be
readily compared to other Caddo
pottery vessel assemblages from sites
in the upper Neches River basin as
well as Caddo pottery vessel
assemblages analyzed by Prewitt &
Associates, the Caddo Nation of
Oklahoma, and Archeological &
Environmental Consultants, LLC from
contemporaneous Caddo sites in other
parts of East Texas.

2. Photographic images of each of
the vessels would be obtained as part
of the comparative analysis of upper
Neches River basin Caddo ceramic
vessel assemblages. Images of the
elbow pipes from burials at the Lang
Pasture site would also be obtained
during the analysis effort to be able to
make stylistic and morphological
comparisons between clay pipes found
on contemporaneous Caddo sites in
the upper Neches River basin.

for another 284 vessels from 25
generally contemporaneous Caddo
sites in the upper Neches River
basin (Table 4-7). These would
provide comparative information
for use in the analysis of the Lang
Pasture site vessels and the
detailed analysis completed on
284 other vessels at TARL. For
further comparative studies of
prehistoric Caddo vessels and
decorative styles in the upper
Neches River basin, we also drew
upon the previous analyses of
whole vessels completed by T. N.
Campbell in 1936 (n=311 vessels
from seven sites in Anderson and
Cherokee counties) and Ulrich
Kleinschmidt’s 1982 analysis of
561 whole vessels from sites in
Anderson, Cherokee, Henderson,
and Smith counties in the upper
Neches
River
basin.

Frankston phase material culture
employing ceramic wares was to
examine decorated sherd collections
from TARL. These collections came
from 10 sites in Anderson and
Cherokee counties in the upper
Neches River basin, near to the Lang
Pasture site (Table 4-8). These sherds
are from habitation deposits rather
than from mortuary contexts, thereby
facilitating comparisons with the more
than 2300 decorated sherds from
habitation deposits at Lang Pasture.
Generally these sites are believed to
be contemporaneous with the Lang
Pasture site because they contain
(from an examination of TARL site
records) brushed sherds and Poynor
Engraved sherds; both kinds of
decorated pottery that are well
represented in the decorated ceramic
vessel sherds from the Lang Pasture
site. A total of 539 sherds and 10
decorated pipes/pipe sherds were
proposed for comparative analysis as
part of this effort.

Archeological Investigations at the Lang Pasture Site (41AN38) in the Upper Neches River Basin of East Texas
Texas Department of Transportation

The analysis consisted of sorting decorated
rim and body sherds by decorative technique
(i.e., brushing, incising, engraving) and
decorative element (i.e., cross-hatched incised;
negative engraved ovals; horizontal brushing
on the rim) (see Chapter 6, this volume), and
making sketches of distinctive decorative
motifs for detailed comparisons. Also noted in
the analysis of these sherds from domestic
Caddo contexts were the number of decorated
sherds tempered with bone, as the use of bone
in the upper Neches River basin may have
both temporal and social group significance.
The goal was to determine which sites—or
groups of Caddo sites—had the highest degree
of sharing of material culture (particularly
decorative motifs and certain distinctive vessel
shapes) with the Lang Pasture site. The extent
of sharing of material culture would provide a
measure of local social/kinship ties and the
intensity of social group interactions.
The chipped stone tools, the ground stone
tools, and the lithic debris recovered at the
Lang Pasture site represent the discarded
remains of tool manufacture, maintenance, and
use activities, but whether they are the product
of one or multiple Caddo occupations was not
clear. The clustering (or absence of clustering)
of the radiocarbon and TL dating of features
and ceramic sherds in archeological deposits
was used to establish if there was a single
Caddo component present at the Lang Pasture
site. If the absolute dates indicated that there
were multiple Caddo components, an effort
would be made to sort the diagnostic lithic
artifacts into different assemblages for
comparison of tool use and raw material use.
The samples of tools and debris appear to be
small, but this seems to be a typical situation
in northeastern Texas Late Caddo residential
settlements, where Caddo groups apparently
relied heavily on wooden and bone tools for
many activities. Other contributing factors that
may account for the low density of lithic
artifacts include the limited amount of
naturally occurring knappable stone in this
part of the upper Neches River basin, and the
technological organization of the Caddo

Technical Report No. 174202

peoples living at the site (i.e., the production
of arrow points and flake tools). The sample
sizes of tools and debris should allow ready
inter-site comparisons between Lang Pasture
and other contemporaneous sites in the kinds
of tools made and used during the Late Caddo
occupation, particularly the proportions of
expedient vs. formal tools (cf. Tomka 2001).
Furthermore, the lithic debris sample should
be sufficient to characterize the manufacturing
and tool refurbishing/maintenance activities
that occurred there, as well as establish
differences in the relative proportions of local
vs. non-local lithic raw materials in the tools
and debris in this component.
4.9

THE HEALTH AND DIET OF THE
CADDO AT THE LANG PASTURE
SITE

The physical anthropological study of the
skeletal remains from the burials recovered
during the test excavations and data recovery
at the Lang Pasture site focused on the non­
invasive identification of skeletal pathologies,
degenerative diseases and infections, and
evidence of nutritional stress in children and
adults, along with the presence and frequency
of caries. This research attempted to address a
variety of questions about the Caddo group
living at the Lang Pasture site, including: (a)
was their diet nutritionally adequate, (b) what
were local and regional population densities at
the time, and how common were infectious
diseases, (c) how heavy were their work loads,
and (d) whether there were episodes of chronic
stress that can be related to work load and
lifestyle (see Rose et al. 1998:121).
Given the possible Late Caddo age (ca. A.D.
1400-1450) of burials from the Lang Pasture
site, it is significant that infectious disease
rates in the Caddo archeological area appear to
have increased after ca. A.D. 1200 in most
regions then remained relatively stable
through the seventeenth century. In Caddo
populations along the Red and Ouachita rivers
where intensive maize-based agricultural
economies had developed, a significant
increase in infections occurred only after A.D.
1400 (Perttula 1996:321). This apparent

53

Chapter 4: Research Design

association
between
intensive
maize
consumption and infectious disease rates is
likely a product of higher population densities
in these agricultural economies (Rose et al.
1998). If such an association should be present
in a burial population at Lang Pasture in Late
Caddo times, this would constitute compelling
evidence (together with other archeological
evidence) for the development of agricultural
economies in this part of northeastern Texas.

preserved, she suggested two bio-cultural
factors that contrast with other Caddo data on
health and diet. She noted a low rate of
infection in contrast to Wilson's (1998)
findings for the Caddo archeological area as a
whole. Of the four adults in Burnett's (1990)
synthesis from the Neches River basin, none
exhibited adult stress in the form of
osteoarthritis. Information on childhood stress
was absent.

With the study of the human remains from the
Lang Pasture site burials, we can also examine
demography, nutrition, and stress in
conjunction with the archeological study of
subsistence, settlement, and social status
patterns evidenced at the site. Specifically, we
proposed to evaluate the hypothesis that the
population from the Lang Pasture site had a
diet with a relatively low dependency on
maize and that they also had a low rate of
infectious disease. Very little is known about
the bioculture of the Frankston phase Caddo
peoples. Without access to local and regional
information on Caddo health and diet,
attempts
to
properly
interpret
the
bioarcheological information from Lang
Pasture would be hindered.

In contrast to the Caddo archeological area as
a whole, Burnett (1990) also suggested a lack
of dependence by the Caddo on maize in the
Neches River basin, despite its presence in
archeological features. Stable isotope data
would help elucidate this inconsistency and
we proposed that this should be performed on
any additional human remains in burials
encountered at the Lang Pasture site as well as
other related sites in the upper Neches River
basin.

The Neches River drainage basin represents
the westernmost part of the prehistoric Caddo
traditional homeland in Texas. This region
appears to be biologically and environmentally
distinct. It lies mostly in what Burnett (1990)
refers to as the Pine Forest. Non-metric data
on teeth do suggest that the southern Caddo
form a distinct and homogenous biological
population (Lee 1999).
What is most apparent about the Neches River
basin in general, and the Frankston phase in
particular, is that it is poorly documented from
a bioarcheological perspective. The bestknown site in the region is the Early Caddo
period George C. Davis site (41CE19), located
some miles downstream on the Neches River
from Lang Pasture, a mound center with a
village area and numerous poorly preserved
burials. In Burnett's (1990) synthesis of the
region, although small in the number of
burials known and studied, and also poorly

54

We proposed to develop a bioarcheological
understanding of the prehistoric Caddo human
remains from the Lang Pasture site. We used a
population approach that incorporated an array
of skeletal evidence into a regional
archeological framework to better understand
how the human remains from the burials at
Lang Pasture can contribute to our
understanding of the Frankston phase and
prehistoric Caddo culture at its southern
periphery. First, the human remains recovered
from the Lang Pasture site were analyzed in
accordance with bioarcheological standards
(cf. Buikstra and Ubelaker 1994) that allow
for comparison with other sets of Caddo
burials and human remains. Second, regional
comparisons of the skeletal materials from
other nearby Caddo sites of various ages with
those from Lang Pasture maximized the
interpretive potential of the burials from this
site by creating a broad set of information
comprising materials from sites within the
Neches River basin, and specifically from
Frankston phase sites as well as earlier and
later Caddo groups historically related to
them. And third, by looking at the health and
diet of the Frankston phase Caddo peoples
specifically, and placing the findings from

Technical Report No. 174202

Archeological Investigations at the Lang Pasture Site (41AN38) in the Upper Neches River Basin of East Texas
Texas Department of Transportation

Lang Pasture in its regional context, both
geographic and temporal means for studying
the bio-cultural processes of Caddo diet and
health at the Lang Pasture site were possible.
We had four specific goals for the
bioarcheological analysis of the human
remains from burials at the Lang Pasture site.
They included: (1) identifying the human
remains at the site. These data would be
collected and recorded on standardized data
sheets (see Buikstra and Ubelaker 1994); (2)
evaluating and synthesizing comparable
information
from
other
broadly
contemporaneous Caddo sites in the region.
To maximize the amount of information
available about the health and diet of the
Caddo peoples that lived at the Lang Pasture
site, its context needed to be determined in
relation to other Frankston phase and Neches
River Caddo sites. Accepted standardized
analysis criteria were applied to human
remains not yet published and housed at the
Texas Archeological Research Laboratory
(TARL); (3) testing Burnett's (1990) assertions
that the Neches River Caddo had little
infectious disease and ate less maize than
other Caddo populations; and (4) summarizing
our findings in the final published report on
the data recovery investigations at the Lang
Pasture site.
The first objective of the study of human
skeletal remains from the Lang Pasture site
was to provide comparable information for
researchers and the Caddo Nation of
Oklahoma to utilize for other studies or other
purposes.
One
problem
with
past
bioarcheological reports on the prehistoric
Caddo people is the lack of comparability of
collected information sets. For this reason,
since
the
mid-1990s
bioarcheological
information has been collected in a uniform
manner so as to allow comparison with other
sites. The remains recovered were examined
following modern, standard osteological
techniques outlined in Buikstra and Ubelaker
(1994). The information gained from the
burial(s)
was
recorded
on standard
osteological data forms developed to facilitate
site collection comparison. The data reported

Technical Report No. 174202

on these forms provided the information used
for analyses of this material in the second and
third objectives listed earlier in this section.
The second objective was to overcome the
difficulty created by the small number of
burials represented at the Lang Pasture site by
incorporating the new information from it with
skeletal materials from 12 Caddo sites
representing approximately 46 individuals
housed at TARL (Table 4-9). Although the
general age of these burial samples was
known, we also selected five samples for
radiocarbon dating to further refine the
temporal context of these Caddo burials
relative to the probable Frankston phase
Caddo occupation at Lang Pasture. Together,
this information provided a context for the
bio-culture of the Lang Pasture site in terms of
other Frankston phase sites and earlier and
later Neches River basin Caddo sites. Without
this broader synthesis, the information
obtained from the study of the Lang Pasture
burials and human remains would be difficult
to use for meaningful interpretations about the
Caddo people's health, nutrition, and
demographics. Bioarcheological information
previously
collected
using
standard
methodologies outlined above was used in this
analysis. When such data was not available,
we proposed to gather new information about
the human remains in the TARL collections.
The third objective would be accomplished by
using published information from Angelina
and Sabine River basin Caddo populations (cf.
Burnett 1990; Lee 1999) to compare distinct
populations in these areas with the Neches
River Caddo. The analysis of new information
on Neches River basin skeletal remains, and
the synthesis of published information, would
address issues concerning the state of
preservation of the remains, the demographic
structure of the population, the body size and
sexual dimorphism of the prehistoric Caddo
population that resided in the Neches River
drainage, an evaluation of the population's diet
and health, and an assessment of their
biological affinity to other populations within
the southern Caddo area of Texas.

Establishing an inventory of the individuals in
both the site and regional assemblages of
Caddo burials and human remains was a
prerequisite to osteological analysis. It served
as a description of the remains that were
present and was useful in the assessment of
their
preservation;
mortuary
patterns;
bioturbation
and
other
postmortem
disturbances; excavation conditions and
techniques; and soil conditions. Part of the
inventory process was the investigation of
taphonomy because it was essential to
understand the processes of destruction and
dispersal of bones, as well as an assessment of
the role of humans as agents causing the
modification, destruction, and dispersal of
human skeletal remains at archeological sites.
Demographic analysis looks at the sex and age
profile of a population and is useful in
determining their overall fitness and
adaptation to specific environments as well as
cultural patterns of gendered behaviors.
Stature and robusticity are known to be under
genetic control to some degree; but it is also
known that stature and body size are strongly
influenced by the quantity and quality of a
particular diet as well as the health of the
56

individual. The collection of non-metric data
on teeth and bone would aid reconstruction of
genetic relationships within the region and
allow comparisons with other locations
outside the Neches river basin (e.g., Lee
1999).
In addition to studying the subsistence
strategies of the Caddo peoples that lived at
the Lang Pasture site from preserved animal
and plant remains, in certain circumstances,
stable carbon and nitrogen isotope analyses of
human remains were requested to more
accurately determine the dietary composition
of the prehistoric Caddo groups living at Lang
Pasture. Such analyses would be able to
establish whether they had non-maize
consuming diets, diets with low levels of
maize consumption, or they had diets where
maize was the principal source of
carbohydrates and protein (see discussion by
Hart 1999:169). They would also help to
establish when cultigens were adopted, or at
least were intensively used, as well as the rate
of adoption of maize agriculture in the region
(see Perttula 2005:Figure 11-20). Radiocarbon
dates directly on maize samples from
northeastern Texas Caddo sites are dated as

Technical Report No. 174202

Archeological Investigations at the Lang Pasture Site (41AN38) in the Upper Neches River Basin of East Texas
Texas Department of Transportation

early as A.D. 783-1021 (Rogers and Perttula
2004:Table 95), but most of the samples date
after A.D. 1200. Two Late Caddo sites near
Lake Palestine have calibrated 2 sigma age
ranges on maize samples of A.D. 1390-1480
(41HE139) and A.D. 1440-1640 (41HE343)
(Cliff et al. 2004: Tables 14 and 19).
The diet of any population is a reflection of
cultural and natural environments. A maizeintensive diet is one aspect of Caddo diets that
was not seen among their hunter-gatherer
predecessors. As a hallmark of Caddo culture,
it was important to detail the relative
contribution of maize to the diet of Frankston
phase individuals that lived at the Lang
Pasture site. It was also important to test
Burnett's (1990) finding of a low maize diet in
the upper Neches River basin. To assess diet,
most bioarcheological studies focus on dental
remains and/or stable isotope analysis.
Cariogenesis, dental attrition, antemortem
tooth loss, and abscessing primarily reflect
diet and food processing strategies.
Throughout the Americas increased reliance
on maize has been correlated with increased
dental caries. Stable isotope analysis has long
been used to examine trophic levels of
organisms and specific dietary contributions
from maize, legumes, and proteins. Combined
with dental evidence, stable isotope analysis
can flesh out significant parts of the Frankston
phase diet not reflected in teeth alone. This
study proposed to perform stable isotope
analysis on individuals of the known Caddo
archeological burial population available for
study at TARL (see Table 4-9), thus making it
possible to determine if maize was equally
important in the southern Caddo diet as it was
in the diets of other Caddo populations.
Paleopathology examines the rate of infectious
disease, trauma, congenital disorders, and
childhood and adult stress in a population. We
examined the human remains for evidence of
infectious disease, which is often an indicator
of population aggregation. Trauma can be the
result of violence or accident. Childhood
mortality and physiological stress is often used
as an indicator of a culture's overall adaptive
success. We considered each of these factors

Technical Report No. 174202

to assess the overall health of the Lang Pasture
population in comparison to other Caddo
groups that were living in the Neches River
basin at about the same time.
In summary, the proposed bioarcheological
analyses would establish the basis for
interpretation of the Lang Pasture site human
remains that would be critical to an overall
understanding of the prehistoric Caddo
occupation of the site. The study was a threepart
process:
information
collection,
evaluation and synthesis, and comparison. The
preservation of information for future
researchers and the Caddo Nation of
Oklahoma required the collection of
bioarcheological data in accordance with
established standards (Buikstra and Ubelaker
1994). To enhance the information that could
be collected from the small number of burials
at Lang Pasture, regional information on
Caddo populations from the Neches River
drainage basin was key to properly
interpreting the cultural and archeological
significance of the Lang Pasture human
remains. This information was then compared
geographically and temporally with other
Caddo sites in the region to understand how
the Lang Pasture site fit into its regional
context. This study would test the hypothesis
that the Caddo population from the site had a
diet with a relatively low dependency on
maize and had a low rate of infectious disease.
4.10

FRANKSTON PHASE MORTUARY
PRACTICES

The mortuary features from the Lang Pasture
site had the potential to contribute important
information on the social differences that
existed among this prehistoric Caddo
population. The specific research question to
be addressed was whether the burials from the
site provided evidence of social differences
that may have existed within or between sites
in the region. The examination of the
complexity of mortuary behaviors (i.e., the
energy invested in the mortuary rituals, the
amounts of grave goods placed with the dead,
the kinds of grave goods placed with the dead,
and the locale where the dead were buried)

57

Chapter 4: Research Design

can contribute new information on the
mortuary treatment of Caddo agricultural
communities in Late Caddo times. This
examination would be made even stronger by
turning our attention to the size and
organization
of
other
generally
contemporaneous Caddo cemeteries in the
upper Neches River basin (see Story and Creel
1982:33), and building on the basic
conclusions
from
current
mortuary
information that Caddo groups here lived in
“habitation sites [that] were usually not
occupied for long periods of time…the
population associated with any one settlement
was relatively small…and most statuses were
not ranked” (Story and Creel 1982:33).
One topic to be examined concerned whether
individual interments could be associated with
specific households at the Lang Pasture site.
This would be done by determining the
placement of the individuals relative to
households, or by establishing through
radiocarbon and TL dating a specific
chronological relationship. The kinds of
funerary objects associated with the interments
and the energy invested in burial (i.e., shaft
tombs versus individual extended grave pits)
would provide the information to examine the
organization of the cemetery by status or rank.
So too would the sex and age of the
individuals, and the boundaries and orientation
of formal cemetery areas, provide information
on Caddo burial practices.
Mortuary data from prehistoric Caddo sites in
the upper Neches River basin is relatively
abundant and competently documented, and
well suited for comparative analyses with the
burials from the small cemetery at the Lang
Pasture site. The vast majority of the available
mortuary data derives from University of
Texas excavations in the 1930s (Jackson 1931,
1933b; Pearce and Woolsey 1935; Woolsey

58

1935a-n; see also Cole 1975:337-357;
Kleinschmidt 1982). More limited Caddo
mortuary data are available from the Attaway
site (41HE114; Shafer 1981) and Vanderpool
(41SM77).
These mortuary data are sufficient to
determine the following: (1) the location of
cemeteries within sites and in relationship to
habitation areas and sources of water; (2) the
age of many of the burials, and perhaps the
sex as well (employing the results of the
present analysis of human remains in the
TARL collections from the upper Neches
River basin); (3) the kind and quantity of
grave goods placed in most of the burials,
including information on the placement of any
goods of non-local origin; and (4) the
orientation and internal arrangement of burials
within cemeteries. From these data, combined
with comparable mortuary data obtained from
the analysis of the Lang Pasture site burials,
we hoped to be able to evaluate the hypothesis
posed by Story and Creel (1982:33) that upper
Neches River basin Caddo populations living
in this area around and after ca. A.D. 1400 did
not have a social hierarchical character, when
contemporaneous Caddo groups to the north
(among Titus and McCurtain phase groups) or
east (Texarkana and Belcher phase Caddo
groups living on the Red River) did.
There were 31 roughly contemporaneous
prehistoric Caddo cemeteries in the upper
Neches River basin that were the focus of our
investigation of the character of Caddo
mortuary
practices
(Table
4-10).
Documentation on these cemeteries was
available in the records at TARL as well as
Cole (1975), Kleinschmidt (1982), and Shafer
(1981).

From this information, we could examine the
question of whether there was a social
hierarchical character to the households within
the settlement and the larger community, by
comparisons with other Late Caddo family
cemeteries with similar information in the
upper Neches River basin (see Cole 1975;
Kleinschmidt 1982; Shafer 1981; Story and
Creel 1982, and reports on file at TARL
written in the 1930s), as well as with elite

Technical Report No. 174202

burials in Caddo mound centers (i.e., the
George C. Davis site, see Story 2000) or lesser
centers. The detailed examination of ceramic
styles and engraved rim motifs on the vessels
placed as funerary objects would also provide
information to establish if the social
affiliations of the household(s) at the site
related to geographically distinct sociopolitical groups.

PALEOENVIRONMENTAL
CONDITIONS AND HUMAN
ADAPTATION

A final research issue concerned the character
of the environment in the vicinity of the Lang
Pasture site at the time of the Caddo
occupation and the human impact on that
environment due to forest clearance, burning,
and the planting of agricultural fields. The
question to be addressed is, to what extent did
the Caddo population of the Lang Pasture site
and the surrounding region affect the
vegetation patterns? Did the agricultural
practices of the Caddo degrade the local and
regional environmental setting?
Palynological analysis of sediment cores can
provide information on the makeup of the
local vegetation, and in conjunction with
radiocarbon dating, can be used to assess
change in vegetation patterns through time.
This would provide a baseline of
paleoenvironmental
data
for
better
understanding Caddo subsistence strategies
and dietary patterns reconstructed from other
data, and it could serve as a measure of the
impact of the Caddo on their environment.

Current models of Caddo settlement systems
in the upper Neches River basin suggest that
most of the population was dispersed in small
farmsteads or hamlets. If that interpretation is
correct, then Caddo impact on the vegetation
in the vicinity of these settlements and the
cumulative impact of the regional population
may have been very limited. The proposed
pollen analyses would evaluate this question
by comparing percentages of arboreal and
ruderal or weed pollen levels before and
during the Caddo occupation of the Lang
Pasture site.
Three vibracores were collected during the
archeological fieldwork: Cores 1 and 3 was
from Caddo Creek about 1.6 km north of the
site and Core 2 came from a spring-fed
drainage adjacent to the site. We proposed to
analyze 42 pollen samples from the three
cores, focusing on the period prior to and
during the Caddo occupation (Table 4-11).
We also proposed to submit 14 radiocarbon
samples for analysis.
These would be
submitted in a phased approach, with an initial
group of seven followed later by a second
group whose location would depend on the
results of the first group (Table 4-12).

FIELD METHODS

The hand excavations at 41AN38 were to
consist of contiguous sets of 1 x 1 m units in a
large block excavation approximately 160
square meters in size. The block excavations
would be of an appropriate size in the
remaining undisturbed parts of the site in the
SH 155 right-of-way to insure sufficient
horizontal and vertical coverage of the core of
the site to uncover features and associated
artifact concentrations, and to obtain
representative samples of the artifact classes
and plant and animal remains known to be
present.
The block and units were to be laid out to be
oriented to grid north (see Lohse 2004:Figure
3.24), paralleling the SH 155 right-of-way
fence, and the units will be excavated with flat
shovels and trowels using a combination of
natural and arbitrary 10 cm levels within
sediment zones (if such are readily
recognizable). The levels would conform to
the slope of the modern ground surface and
conform to the sediment zones recognized in
the deposits. The sediment matrix will be
screened through 1/4-inch hardware cloth to
recover buried archeological materials,
including macro-plant remains. Using balks,
the units were to be excavated in sequence to
consistent depths through the sediment zones,
or to the bottom of sediment zones, to broadly
expose any artifact concentrations and features
that may be present at the same depths. Only
after the units in the block were brought to
similar depths, and unit/block floors troweled
and artifacts/features mapped, would the units
again be excavated to the next level or
sediment contact zone.
The units were to be assigned unique numbers
in consecutive order by block and site, and
information on their artifact content, the
densities of gravels and natural concretions,
the sediments, modern and cultural
disturbances, and the location (and top and/or
bottom
elevations)
of
any
artifact
concentrations will be noted on unit level
forms for each level in the 1 x 1 m units. The

Technical Report No. 174202

floor of each unit in the blocks were to be
cleaned and troweled at the base of each level
to determine if cultural disturbances are
present, and also to map modern disturbances
and/or any in situ artifacts. The handexcavated units in the block were to be
excavated to approximately 40 cm bs by
shovel and trowel, and then screened through
1/4-inch wire mesh, then shovel skimmed to at
least 50 cm bs. At these depths, sufficient
color and textural contrasts existed in the
sediments to ensure recognition of features in
plan view. Below this depth (see Table 3), the
artifact densities were so low (less than 12
percent of the sherds, 20 percent of the lithic
debris, and 10 percent of the lithic tools) that it
would not be practical to recover them in a
controlled manner. Moreover, these artifacts
likely had been displaced by bioturbation and
other disturbance processes, thus no longer
having any contextual integrity.
Fine-screen samples (1/32-inch hardware
cloth) could be obtained in 40 x 40 cm
columns in selected 1 x 1 m units (and
selected 5 or 10 cm levels within those units)
only if midden deposits with concentrations of
artifacts, fauna, and plant remains were
identified in the excavations. These would be
employed to more systematically retrieve
micro-artifactual remains such as charred
hickory nutshells, burned clay and daub, pipe
sherds, as well as smaller faunal elements.
Plan views were to be drawn at the bottom of
each arbitrary level, and concentrations of
artifacts, features, or disturbances were to be
plotted by depth and plan when they were
encountered. Profile views were to be drawn
of at least one wall of the block units at the
conclusion of the excavations. The profiles
would be drawn to delineate different soil
zones in the sediments, and would accompany
descriptions obtained on the character of the
sediments (i.e., texture, color, inclusions,
disturbances) in the profiles. The zones were
considered to be any regular or irregular layer
of sediments that can be characterized as
distinct from surrounding sediments by some
particular property or content (such as texture,
compactness, color, etc.). Additional profiles

61

Chapter 4: Research Design

would be obtained from the standing balks and
outer block walls. Soil samples from sediment
zones would be obtained for more detailed
analysis of particle size, organic matter, and
organic carbon from each zone.
When features were identified in the hand
excavations, they would be carefully troweled
to accurately define them in plan or profile
views, and for mapping purposes. After each
feature was drawn and assigned a unique
number (beginning with Fea. 12, since Fea. 1­
11 have already been assigned by Lohse
[2004] in the test excavations) and recorded on
a Feature Record form, its depth below surface
was to be established, and the surrounding
sediments and possible feature fill described.
The feature would be cross-sectioned along
north-south or east-west axes to determine if
the stain or disturbance was of cultural origin
rather than a root, tree stump, or a modern
disturbance. If the profile indicated that the
stain or disturbance was of apparent cultural
origin (i.e., the stain has a rounded or flat
bottom with regularly defined walls; the stain
contains midden deposits, charcoal or bone
flecking, etc.), the profile of the feature would
be drawn, and then the cultural fill would be
removed from the feature for flotation analysis
and/or fine-screening (depending upon the
volume of the feature). In most cases,
approximately 50 percent of the feature matrix
was to be screened through 1/16-inch fine
screen, with the remaining fill saved for
flotation processing, or for other special
samples.
As mentioned above, special
samples were to include bulk sediments for
flotation and fine screening, and smaller
samples of feature sediments were to be
employed for phytolith analyses (if warranted
by enhanced preservation conditions of
specific features), or for the collection of
charcoal or other organic materials for macrobotanical
identifications
and
possible
radiocarbon dating. If charred plant remains
were visible during feature excavation,
samples for radiocarbon analysis were to be
taken from the feature fill at that time, and if
there were distinct zones of fill, or
concentrations of carbon-rich sediments in the

62

feature, then separate samples for radiocarbon
dating or other analyses would be obtained.
With respect to field methods in the two heavy
machine-scraped areas, the scraping was to
remove the sandy sediments in 2-3 cm thick
levels until just above the clay B-horizon, or
until possible features or stains were exposed.
These excavations were to be continually
monitored by a team of two archeologists,
who periodically would use a flat shovel and
trowel to examine possible stains, soil
discolorations, and cultural disturbances that
were exposed during the initial scraping.
These possible cultural features were to be
marked with a pin flag for further
investigations, at which point the heavy
machinery would be moved over to continue
scraping an adjacent area until it was at the
same depth, or slightly lower, to maintain a
generally flat surface across the entire scraped
area. When the general depth at which
possible cultural features were present was
established, the blade on the heavy machinery
will be slowly lowered to the scraped area,
then drawn back across the excavations,
removing about 1 cm of soil at a time, to
create a cleaned and flat excavation surface
that could be quickly shoveled and troweled in
the final identification of features.
The investigated areas were to be cleaned with
a flat shovel and trowel at least twice under
different visibility conditions to ensure that
possible feature stains were confidently
identified.
Cross-sections of the soil
discolorations were to be employed to
determine if the stain was of natural or cultural
origin. Cultural features identified in the heavy
machinery scraping work would be assigned a
unique number and recorded on a Feature
Record Form, and then mapped using a Total
Data Station or other mapping equipment. The
recording, profiling, sampling, and excavation
of these features was to proceed in the same
manner as described above for the features
encountered in the 1 x 1 m block units.

LABORATORY METHODS AND
ANALYSIS

The recovered archeological materials were to
be initially processed in a field laboratory
established near the project area. These
materials were to be washed, dried, and
catalogued by provenience, and the matrix
from selected feature samples would either be
fine-screened or subjected to flotation at the
field laboratory to recover micro-botanical and
faunal remains.
The initial sorting of
materials into broad classes of artifacts (i.e.,
ceramics, lithics, bone, charred plant remains,
etc.) was also to be accomplished in the field
laboratory, while the detailed analysis of the
ceramics and lithic artifacts was to be
conducted in the offices of Coastal
Environments, Inc., or Archeological &
Environmental Consultants, LLC. Faunal,
paleobotanical, and physical anthropological
analyses were to be completed by Coastal
Environments, Inc., and project consultants.
Based on artifact densities from the 1 x 1 m
units in the test excavations at 41AN38, and
the size of the proposed data recovery effort,
the following artifact sample size from the
1/4-inch matrix was expected from the block
excavation work: approximately 5100
potsherds, 34 ceramic pipe sherds, 80 chipped
and ground stone tools, and 5000 pieces of
lithic debris. Almost 33 percent of the sherds
would be decorated (based on the plain to
decorated ratio of 1.98 from the test
excavations), suggesting that about 1700
decorated sherds would be recovered from the
block units, not including ones found in
features. The sample of decorated and plain
sherds would be large enough to obtain a
representative sample of the kinds and
varieties of decorated and plain vessel sherds
in a Late Caddo ceramic assemblage in the
upper Neches River basin, and also sufficient
to obtain a reliable plain-to-decorated sherd
ratio for comparison with other nearby
prehistoric Caddo sites, (see Table 1).
The ceramic analysis from 41AN38 was to be
conducted by Dr. Perttula and was to
emphasize the acquisition of information on

Technical Report No. 174202

the stylistic and technological character of the
prehistoric Caddo ceramic assemblage. The
principal research issues included first refining
the age and intra-site chronological
relationships of the ceramics at the site,
followed by establishing the occupational
history of the site as reconstructed from
ceramic stylistic analyses (particularly
decorative elements and motifs), and
determining structure-feature relationships
through time. These same stylistic analyses
were to be employed to answer broader
questions of the social and cultural affiliation
of the Late Caddo groups in the upper Neches
River basin, through stylistic and vessel
morphological comparisons with collections
from other broadly contemporaneous Caddo
sites in the local area (see Figure 1). These
include TARL collections of sherds and whole
vessels (see Campbell 1936) from the bestknown Caddo sites in the local area, building
on the comparative analyses already
completed by Campbell (1936), Gilmore
(1983), and Kleinschmidt (1982): the Mrs. J.
M. Cook (41AN1), J. M. Cook Farm
(41AN2), Fred McKee (41AN32), Mrs. J. W.
Blackburn (41CE4), J. M. Snow (41CE8),
Omer and Otis Hood (41CE14), E. W. Henry
(41CE17), and R. J. Fair (41CE25) sites, and
whole vessels from 41SM77 in the Buddy
Calvin Jones collection (see Figure 1). We
were also concerned with determining the
character and frequency of the utility ware
vessel forms in any prehistoric Caddo
households and components at the site, and
how their composition at the assemblage level
may be related to (and influenced by) the
postulated
intensification
of
maize
consumption by Late Caddo groups in
northeastern Texas (see Study Unit 9 in
Kenmotsu and Perttula 1993:140).
The stylistic analysis of the 41AN38 ceramics
was to focus on the definition of recognizable
decorative elements in the fine wares (i.e., the
engraved and red-slipped vessels, including
carinated bowls and bottles) and utility wares
(i.e., the coarse-paste decorated vessels),
usually cooking or storage jars and simple
bowls. These wares are known to have been
made and used differently, based on

63

Chapter 4: Research Design

functional, technological, and stylistic
analyses on numerous Caddo sherd
assemblages in the region. The ceramic
analysis was to be completed in conjunction
with formal and technological analyses of any
vessels and vessel sections (from macroscopic
analyses of sherd cross-sections), as well as a
sample of the plain rim sherds and decorated
sherds, emphasizing paste characteristics, nonplastic inclusions, surface treatments, and
firing environments of the decorated and plain
sherd assemblages.
The analysis of the lithic artifacts was to focus
on the identification of the range of chipped
and ground stone tools in the lithic
assemblage, with two purposes: (1) to
characterize
stylistic,
functional,
and
morphological attributes of the tools for
documenting local and regional affiliations of
the Caddo populations living at the site; and
(2) to determine intra-site differences in tool
use and discard, particularly activities that
may have occurred inside of house structures
as opposed to tool use in extra-mural work
areas. Of particular importance would be the
compositional recognition of the frequency of
formal vs. expedient tools, the abundance of
cores and bifacial tools, heavy woodworking
tools (i.e., celts and chipped axes) or other
ground stone tools, and the kinds of knapping
debris, as these attributes will help
characterize
the
lithic
technological
organization of the sedentary Caddo groups
living at 41AN38.

We would also attempt to enlist the volunteer
assistance of local avocational archeologists
who may know of lithic raw material sources
in this part of Anderson County. Also useful
would be any tested cobbles and cores with
substantial amounts of cortex remaining on
them that might be in the lithic assemblage, as
it was likely (taken in conjunction with
measurements of cobble or pebble size and
information from known source areas) that
these chipped lithics were probably gathered
and initially reduced from local or regional
sources (i.e., within 50 km of the sites).
Previous investigations of northeastern Texas
Caddo sites have demonstrated long-term
trends in the procurement and use of local vs.
non-local raw materials (including Red River
gravel sources well to the north and Edwards
Formation chert more than 100 km to the
west), but our understanding of lithic raw
material use in ca. A.D. 1400-1450 Caddo
contexts remains poorly developed in the
upper Neches River basin. Based on
comparisons with the occurrence of non-local
ceramics in other northeastern Texas
archeological contexts, one possibility to be
investigated with the 41AN38 lithic
assemblage was that the use of non-local
lithics was substantial in Caddo times (as
assessed in the tools and the debris from tool
manufacture), as Caddo groups preferred finegrained cryptocrystalline materials (especially
chert and novaculite) for the manufacture of
arrow points and a variety of flake tools.

Another area of analytical importance was the
identification of lithic raw material use in the
tools and debris from the site. While it would
not be possible to carry out surveys to
determine the kinds of lithic raw materials
available in local, district, and regional
sources in the upper Neches River basin, we
did plan on collecting samples of knappable
raw material from any gravel exposures or
outcrops in the vicinity of 41AN38.

5STRATIGRAPHY, FEATURES, AND RADIOCARBON DATES
Timothy K. Perttula

5.1

STRATIGRAPHY

The stratigraphy of the archeological deposits
at the Lang Pasture site (41AN38) is quite
straightforward, although because of their
loamy fine sand texture, they are bioturbated
(in some cases severely) by insects, roots, and
burrowing animals. The sediments represent a
moderately developed soil (e.g., Holliday
2004:27) formed under forest conditions
(Vogel 2002:Figure 1, bottom).
Four primary sediment zones, with clear
boundaries between zones (cf. Vogel 2002:25)
are defined within the block and scrape
excavations (Figures 5-1 and 5-2):
Zone I, an Ap or plow zone horizon.
Where this zone is present across the
block, which is in most of the
excavated area, it is a dark yellowishbrown (10YR4/4) loamy fine sand that
is between 13-20 cm in thickness;
Zone II, an A-horizon that is ca. 20-25
cm in thickness. It is also a dark
yellowish-brown
(10YR3/4
to
10YR4/6) loamy fine sand with
charcoal flecks and small amounts of
concretions and gravels; many of the
cultural features documented at the
Lang Pasture site were first detected
in this zone;
Zone III is a yellowish-red (5YR5/8)
to yellowish-brown (10YR5/8) loamy
fine sand E-horizon, with charcoal
flecks; small gravels and concretions
are

Technical Report No. 174202

more abundant than in Zone II,
including hematite and limonite
concretions. On the crest of the upland
landform, Zone III is ca. 45 cm thick;
and
Zone IV is a B-horizon sandy clay of
strong brown (7.5YR4/6), yellowishred (5YR5/8), or red (2.5YR4/6)
color. On the crest of the landform,
the top of the B-horizon is not
exposed until ca. 75 to 82 cm bs; in
some cases in the block excavations,
the B-horizon is not reached until
more than 90 cm bs (i.e., N179 E200,
N190 E198, and N193 E198). Off the
crest of the landform—at the northern
and southern ends of the block and
scrape excavations—the top of the Bhorizon clay is much shallower (20
cm bs in Scrape D, 32 cm bs in Scrape
A, and 49 cm in Scrape E), with a
redder and more oxidized color,
indicating the existence of a strongly
developed soil along the landform
margins (e.g., Holliday 2004:27). At
the far northern end of the excavations
(N214 E198), the B-horizon clay is
intermixed with a ferruginous
sandstone-rich gravel deposit.
Also recognized in one part of the block
excavations—namely between N190.2 E198
and N196 E198—is a spatially discrete
sediment zone that has been designated as
Zone IIA (Figure 5-3).

This zone abruptly merges with the dark
yellowish-brown loamy fine sand deposits that
characterize Zone II, except they are dark
brown (10YR3/3) in color, with some charcoal
flecking presumably because of an increased
organic content from prehistoric habitation
activities; the zone thickens from south to
north, from 20 to 31 cm in thickness. As the
spatial distribution of Zone IIA appears to
coincide rather precisely with the location of
Structure 1, a 14th to 15th century A.D. Caddo
house, it is likely an anthrosol as defined by
Holliday (2004:26-27). That is, it is the result
of physical and chemical changes or
alterations caused by human activity.
OSL dates from two columns in the northern
part of the site (see Bateman, Appendix 2, this
volume) may suggest that the sandy loam
sediments on the upland landform were slowly
aggrading—probably by aeolian deposition
given the unlikelihood that floods along the
nearby Caney Branch Creek could have
deposited any alluvium on this landform.
An alternate explanation is that the OSL dates,
although in stratigraphic order by depth, are
more likely to be the product of bioturbation
processes throughout the course of the
Holocene (James Abott, 2010 personal
communication), from what was essentially a
stable surface long before the principal Caddo
occupation took place at the Lang Pasture site.
The earliest OSL dates of 6390 + 320 B.P
(4440 B.C.) and 7980 + 410 B.P. (6030 B.C.)
from loamy fine sand deposits above the Bhorizon clay could indicate that the loamy fine
sand sediments began to accumulate in the
Middle Archaic period, a notably drier
climatic interval in the region (see Chapter 2,
this volume), or represent biosedimentation of
old sand deposits across the site at those
depths. On the crest of the upland landform
(OSL column N197.5 E198), sediments may
have been accumulated to a thickness of 65
cm by about 1000 years ago, or were already
in place long before any prehistoric
occupation. A second OSL column at N215.5
E198, along the northern slopes of the

Technical Report No. 174202

landform, documents about 55 cm of loamy
fine sand sediments that may have
accumulated until ca. 920 years ago, if not
more recently, although the possibility
remains that the OSL dates simply reflect
bioturbation of sediments that have no
archeological relevance. In general, the upland
landform, however, was apparently a stable
surface well before the time of the principal
prehistoric Caddo occupation of the Lang
Pasture site, which appears to have begun in
the mid-14th century A.D. and lasted until the
mid-15th century.

LANG PASTURE (41AN38)
FEATURES

Timothy K. Perttula and Bo Nelson
5.2.1

Introduction

Including the features identified and/or
investigated in the test excavations (n=12) at
the Lang Pasture site (41AN38) (see Lohse
2004), a total of 97 cultural features were
excavated in the TXDOT right-of-way at the
site during the course of both test excavations
and the data recovery work (Figure 5-4). They
include post holes (n=65), pits of various sizes
and probable functions (n=21), an outdoor
hearth (n=1), a fire-cracked rock concentration
(n=1), and a number of prehistoric Caddo
Indian burial features (n=9) (Table 5-1).
The cultural features at the Lang Pasture site
are not randomly distributed across the rightof-way—as will be discussed in more detail
below. Rather, they are concentrated in four
different parts of the block excavations. These
include the areas in and near the two structures
(Structures 1 and 2), marking the walls of the
structures as well as outdoor activity areas, a
cluster of three pits and one burial (Feature 8)
north of Structure 1, and a group of five
burials at the far northern end of the site.

Zone II and Zone IIA Sediments.

Most of the features were detected either near
the base of the Zone II deposits, or at the Zone
II-Zone III contact (see above). The lighter
yellow and brown color of the Zone III
sediments provided an excellent soil contrast
by which to detect darker post holes and pits
that originated near the modern ground
surface, but penetrated into Zone III and, in
some cases, also penetrated the Zone IV Bhorizon clay deposits.
5.2.2

Domestic Features

Domestic features documented at the Lang
Pasture site include features associated with at
least one prehistoric Caddo domestic
settlement or household area. These features
include post holes, small and large pits,
smudge pits, an outdoor hearth, and a
concentration of fire-cracked rock. Most of the

68

features contain some refuse, primarily
ceramic sherds, lithic debris, charred plant
remains and charcoal, as well as burned and
unburned animal bone (Table 5-2), but by far
the largest amounts of discarded artifacts are
in several large pits (Fea. 76, 76A, and 79)
north and northeast of Structure 1, as well as a
pit feature (Feature 36) associated with (or
situated under?) a ramada/elevated platform
by Structure 1, and an outdoor hearth (Feature
25) just north of the ramada/elevated platform.
Post holes and smudge pits tend not to have
many artifacts in their feature fills, only
charcoal-staining that allowed them to be
recognized in plan and cross-section profile
views during the excavations.
The spatial arrangements of the various
features can be seen in the fold-out map,
Figure 5-4.

5.2.3

Post Holes

There are a total of 17 post holes associated
with the construction of Structure 1 (Figures
5-5 and 5-6; Table 5-3); these probably
represent slightly less than half of all the wall
posts that were used to construct this 6.8-m­
diameter circular structure, with the remainder
to be found on private property across the
ROW fence. The exterior wall arc is welldefined across its northern and eastern halves,
but became much more nebulous along the
southern part of the arc; Feature 67 and
Feature 73 may represent roof support posts
(Figure 5-6). Despite protests of poor exposure
and sandy soil conditions that limit the
identifiability of post hole stains, this is a
common archeological phenomena on Caddo
sites where prehistoric structures were built on
sandy landforms, and there is little midden
deposition on the site, and thus post hole stains
do not strongly contrast with the background
soil matrix.

72

Most of the post holes in Structure 1 are
circular in shape, with gently sloping sides and
rounded bottoms (Figure 5-7), although two
(Features 48 and 55) had flat bottoms (Figure
5-8), as if the posts placed in them had
squared-off ends. It is probably likely that a
number of the posts had deliberately charred
ends, so as to forestall as much as possible the
degradation of the ends of the posts from
rotting. No paleobotanical samples from the
Structure 1 post holes were analyzed, but
based on the results of paleobotanical analyses
from Structure 2 and other contexts at the
site—as well as other Caddo sites with pole
structures (see Rogers and Perttula 2004;
Perttula and Sherman 2008)—both pine and
oak wood were used for wall posts.

*probably a tap root, and not included in the discussion that follows

The Structure 1 post holes have a mean
diameter of 18.47 + 1.97 cm (Coefficient of
Variation1 [CV]=10.66), and a range of 14­
22 cm (see Table 5-3). The posts themselves
were probably about 10 cm in diameter. The
mean bottom depth of the Structure 1 post
holes was 57.3 + 6.7 cm (CV=11.69]; they
were not set in holes dug into the underlying
B-horizon clay, but only in holes that
reached into the E-horizon sediments. The
CV values in the size and depth of the post
holes from Structure 1 indicate that this
structure had the least variability in post
hole size or in the depth to which they were
set. Other than the post holes from the
Structure 3 ramada, the post holes from
Structure 1 were set the shallowest of the
clusters of post holes associated with

Structure 2 or the post holes found outside
of, but in proximity to, Structures 1 and 2.
Only limited amounts of artifacts ended up
in the Structure 1 post holes, including
lithics (n=23), ceramic sherds (n=3), animal
bone (n=10), and charred plant remains
(n=102, plus 16.7 g of charred remains from
Feature 48) (Table 5-2). The low density of
artifacts indicates that no artifacts were
deliberately set in the post holes before the
structure was erected, and this low density
also suggests that little trash or midden soils
were allowed to accumulate on the floor of
Structure 1, where they could more easily
become incorporated into post hole fill. Both
Structure 2 and Structure 3 post holes had
significantly higher densities of artifacts in
their fill (see below).

1

The Coefficient of Variation is determined
by dividing the sample standard deviation by
the sample mean, and multiplying the result
by 100.

Figure 5-7. Profiles of Select Structure 1 Post Holes.

Figure 5-8. Feature 48, a Post Hole, in Plan and Profile, Looking West.

Thirteen post holes are part of the
construction of Structure 2 (Table 5-4 and
Figures 5-9 and 5-10). Only about one-third
of this structure is represented in the TxDOT
block excavations, based on its estimated
diameter of 9.0 m.

Technical Report No. 174202

The Structure 2 posts were widely set (see
Figure 5-9), much more so than with the
construction of Structure 1, except in two
instances (Features 1/5 and Features 32/33)
where post holes were very close to one
another. These latter double set of posts
likely represent replacement posts from
instances of wall repair where one post had

79

Chapter 5: Stratigraphy, Features, and Radiocarbon Dates

rotted at the ground surface and needed to be
replaced. There are no obvious roof supports
in the exposed portion of the structure.
The posts were also on average larger in
Structure 2 than they were in Structure 1,
which seems consistent with the overall
differences in size of the two structures (i.e.,
Structure 2 is 32% larger in diameter than
Structure 1, and presumably needed larger
poles to form the taller peaked roof). The
Structure 2 post holes are 22.53 + 4.88 cm in
diameter (CV=21.66), with a range of 12-35
cm. The wide range in post hole diameter
size, based on the CV value, is notable,
suggesting little selectivity in choosing poles
of certain diameters for structure
construction. The Structure 2 post holes are
set deeper in the ground than were the post
holes from Structure 1, with a mean bottom
depth of 67.6 + 12.4 cm (CV=18.34). Again,

the CV value for the post holes in Structure
2 is considerable, pointing to the somewhat
haphazard construction efforts (i.e., posts of
widely-ranging size put in holes with widely
ranging depths) seemingly put into the
erection of Structure 2
Lithic artifacts (n=64) and animal bone
(n=65) were relatively common inclusions
in the fill of the Structure 2 post holes, along
with ceramic sherds (n=13) and charred
plant remains (n=68) (see Table 5-2).
Including only the post holes that contain
artifacts, the density of incidental artifacts is
almost three times as high in Structure 2
(mean=26.3) as it is in Structure 1
(mean=9.9). The artifact density in Structure
3 is intermediate, with a mean value per post
hole of 16.6.

Chapter 5: Stratigraphy, Features, and Radiocarbon Dates

Figure 5-10. Profiles of Select Structure 2 Post Holes.

Fifteen post holes form a ca. 2 x 4 m rectangle
about 1-3 m east-northeast of Structure 1 (see
Figure 5-6 above). These posts, some of which
are fairly shallow (Table 5-5), are presumed to
represent the construction of a ramada or
elevated work platform in the vicinity of the
Structure 1 domestic residence, and placed
squarely amidst outdoor work activities
signaled by high densities of ceramic sherds in
the same area as well as various outdoor
features, including a hearth (Feature 25), a
cooking pit (Feature 36), and smudge pits.
The post holes in the Structure 3 ramada have
gently tapering sides and both rounded and flat
bottoms (Figure 5-11). Flat-bottomed posts
comprise 33% of the post holes in this
structure, compared to only 12% in Structure 1
and 15% in Structure 2. T he Structure 3 post
holes are smaller than those associated with
either Structure 1 or 2, with a mean diameter
of 17.6 + 3.76 cm (CV=21.36), with a range of
10-23 cm. The posts were also generally set
shallowly in the ground, with a mean bottom
depth of 54.8 + 9.39 cm (CV=17.13). The two
deepest posts (Features 72 and 77) are along
the eastern wall of Structure 3, and the Feature
78 post may mark one of the corners of the
platform. Feature 89, also atypically deeply
set, may mark the southwestern corner of the
elevated platform.

82

Five of the post holes associated with
Structure 3 (see Table 5-5) apparently cut
through and postdate a large cooking pit
(Feature 36) and an outdoor hearth (Feature
25) (Figures 5-12 and 5-13). The four that
protrude into Feature 36 are relatively small in
size and shallowly set, more so than many of
the other Structure 3 post holes, but
nevertheless the intersection of post holes
through Feature 36 indicates that the ramada
or outdoor work elevated platform postdates at
least the use of this cooking pit in the outdoor
activity area associated with Structure 1.
Although the Feature 74 post hole was not
exposed until near the bottom of the Feature
25 hearth (see discussion below), it must have
bisected the hearth from top to bottom, as it
cut through a pocket of ash at the very top of
the hearth deposits. Therefore, the Feature 74
post hole postdates the earlier outdoor hearth
situated along the northern edge of the
Structure 3 ramada.
Other ramadas or work platforms have been
identified on prehistoric Caddo sites along the
Red River in southwestern Arkansas and
northwestern Louisiana (Kelley 1997: Figure
20; Trubowitz 1984:91-92), and at two
contemporaneous Caddo sites (41NA231 and
41TT653) in East Texas (Perttula ed., 2008a;
Perttula and Sherman 2008). These tend to be

Technical Report No. 174202

Archeological Investigations at the Lang Pasture Site (41AN38) in the Upper Neches River Basin of East Texas

about 3 m on a side and roughly square in
shape, and are situated amidst outdoor work
areas and areas of midden deposits. At the
McLelland site (Kelley 1997:32) the ramada
had larger post holes (ca. 25 cm in diameter)
at its corners, but this was not the case at the

Tallow Grove site (41NA231). Most of the
post holes in the ramada at Tallow Grove
ranged from 18-22 cm in diameter,
comparable to those from Structure 3 at the
Lang Pasture site.

A number of other post holes (n = 18) were
identified and excavated from other contexts
at the Lang Pasture site (Table 5-6). These
include nine outside of, but in proximity to,
Structure 2, among them several in an outdoor
activity area 1-3 m north of Structure 2
(Figures 5-14 and 5-15). These form no
coherent patterns, but may represent evidence
for the construction and use of racks, screens,
or wood supports to suspend cooking vessels
above cooking fires.

5.2.4

The post holes in extra-mural settings are
basically the same size as the posts used in the
construction of both Structures 1 and 2, and
most have gently sloping sides and rounded
bottoms (Figure 5-15). It is interesting to note
that the post holes found outside Structure 1,
at 19.0 + 4.8 cm (CV=25.26) in mean diameter
and with a mean bottom depth of 58.5 + 9.0
cm (CV=15.38), are approximately the same
size and depth as those post holes associated
with Structure 1, while those found in extra­
mural contexts outside Structure 2 have
comparable post hole sizes (23.6 + 3.29 cm,
CV=13.94) and depths (64.1 + 13.83 cm,
CV=21.58) as do Structure 2. The deliberate
selection of larger poles associated with
Structure 2 and its surrounding outdoor
activity areas raises the possibility that timbers
available for construction at the time of the
Structure 2 occupation were naturally larger,
and that by the time of the Structure 1
occupation (which presumably came slightly
later), the larger timber had been culled, at
least to the extent where it affected timber
selection choices in the construction of
Structure 1 and its associated Structure 3.

The larger and deeper pits (i.e., Features 20,
29, 76A, and 79) were probably used for the
storage of plant foods because of their
considerable apparent volume and the nature
of their fills. When they were no longer
suitable as storage facilities, they were
abandoned and filled in with sediments and
discarded trash. Feature 76, the largest pit (see
Table 5-7), is a special case among the Lang
Pasture site pit features, in that while it was
certainly large enough to store considerable
amounts of plant foods, its primary use
appears to have been for the emplacement of a
series of burials rather than food storage. The
larger pits typically have a dark brown fill, but
with little evidence of stratification, discrete
fill zones, or oxidized/fired areas, negating
their use as earth ovens. Two of the pits—
Features 76A and Feature 79—are more than
large enough to have held 25 or more bushels
(ca. 600 kg) of plant foods. If that plant food
was maize, that would be sufficient to meet
the caloric needs for a year of a single nuclear
family where maize comprised more than 55%
of the diet (Schroeder 1999: Table 5).

Technical Report No. 174202

Small and Large Pits

There are 18 small and large pits at the Lang
Pasture site (Table 5-7). Only three of the pits
are within the two structures: Features 2 and
29 in Structure 2 and Feature 37 in Structure
1. The others are in two outdoor activity area
clusters, one north and northeast of Structure 1
and the other, but smaller, pit cluster about 11
m north of Structure 1 and west of the Feature
8 burial.

Such large pits were probably used for only a
few years. Wall slumping and erosion would
have been a problem
in storage pit
maintenance in the sandy soils at the Lang
Pasture site, as would the deterioration and
continual replacement of grass or canecovered walls and floors of the pits since none
were lined with clay. When a storage pit was
abandoned, a new storage pit was likely dug
nearby.

Technical Report No. 174202

The smaller pits (less than ca. 80 cm in
diameter and relatively shallow in depth)
could have held between ca. 1-6 bushels of
plant foods. It is doubtful these pits were used
for any large scale storage of plant foods,
except perhaps for those at the larger end of
the volume scale (i.e., Feature 37) that could
have held 75 kg of food stuffs. The primary
function of these smaller pits is uncertain.

evidence of in situ heating, such as oxidized

from use as a cooking pit, but the matrix of

Feature 2 (0.037 m3 in estimated volume,
enough to hold one bushel of food stuffs) is an
oval-shaped pit with rounded sides and a
rounded bottom (Figures 5-18). Its matrix is a
very dark grayish-brown (10YR 3/2) sandy
loam. The fill also contained small pieces of
burned bone and charcoal.
Feature 9 was a poorly defined stain at least 20
x 40 cm in size that was identified during the
test excavations at the Lang Pasture site (see
Lohse 2004:Table 3.2). It had a brown (7.5YR
4/3) sandy loam fill, but no charcoal or bone
flecks or other artifacts were noted to occur in
association with it. Further excavations in the
2006 block around the 2004 test units did not
encounter the other edges of this nebulous pit,
and it may simply represent a lightly stained
patch of soil in an outdoor activity area east of
Structure 2, rather than a discrete and
deliberately excavated pit feature.

Technical Report No. 174202

Feature 20 is a moderate-sized pit (0.203 m3, a
volume large enough to hold 5.8 bushels of
maize) about 3 m east of Structure 1 (Figure 5­
19). The pit contained a modicum of artifacts
and food refuse (see Table 5-2). The fill of the
pit was a dark brown (10YR 3/3) loamy fine
sand with charcoal flecking, particularly near
the center of the feature in profile.
Feature 29 is a large pit situated within
Structure 2, near the northern post hole wall
arc. It is exposed in profile along the western
edge of the block and TxDOT right-of-way,
and thus its total shape and size is unknown;
the exposed portion in the block suggests it is
ca. 104 cm in diameter. The pit appears to be
circular and basin-shaped, with sloping sides
and a gently rounded base (Figure 5-20); a
considerable quantity of charred plant remains
were recovered from the feature fill (see Table
5-2).

If the estimate of this feature’s diameter is
reasonably accurate, Feature 29 had a volume
of 0.281 m3, sufficient to hold approximately 8
bushels of plant foods. This pit may have been
a supplemental storage feature (since it could
only have provided about 35% of a nuclear

family’s annual supply of maize), one placed
within the walls of a structure to protect
certain plant foods that might otherwise be
damaged or destroyed if they had been placed
in more vulnerable and accessible outdoor
storage facilities.

Feature 36 is probably an outdoor cooking pit.
It is oval-shaped, with a flat bottom and gently
sloping side walls (Figures 5-21 and 5-22b).
Pit fill consisted of a dark brown (10YR 3/3)
to very dark brown (10YR 2/2) loamy fine
sand with charcoal flecking along the margins
of the pit, with a concentrated area of black
(10YR 2/1) charcoal-stained fill in the central

92

part of the pit. A cluster of sherds from a
broken plain vessel were found at the top of
these feature deposits (Figure 5-22a). Other
remains recovered in the pit fill included other
sherds, lithics, charred plant remains, animal
bone, and a few fragments of mussel shell (see
Table 5-2).

Upon the removal of these organicallyenriched feature sediments, a large area (52 x
44 cm) of dark red (2.5YR 3/6) oxidized
sediments were exposed at 35 cm bs (Figure
5-23a). The black charcoal-stained fill within
Feature 36 surrounded and filled this oxidized
basin, and had obviously been raked out of the
cooking basin during its use. Four post holes
(Features 18, 19, 42, and 43) from the
Structure 3 ramada were exposed where they
had cut through Feature 36, including cutting
through and postdating the oxidized basin
(Figure 5-23b).
Feature 37 (0.109 m3 in volume, and therefore
able to hold ca. 3 bushels of plant foods) is a
moderately-sized pit within the Structure 1
walls. The pit is basin-shaped, with gently
sloping sides and a relatively flat bottom
(Figures 5-24 and 5-25a-b), with dark
yellowish-brown (10YR 3/6) loamy fine sand

fill. A range of artifacts had been discarded in
the pit (see Table 5-2), including deer teeth.
Feature 40 is a small basin-shaped pit (ca.
0.017 m3) in the outdoor activity area north of
Structure 2. It has sloping sides and a rounded
bottom, with a dark yellowish-brown (10YR
3/4) loamy fine sand fill. The feature fill
contained only a few lithic artifacts and pieces
of wood charcoal (see Table 5-2).
Feature 45 is another small basin-shaped pit
(0.013 m3). It is situated amidst the post hole
stains associated with the Structure 3 ramada,
northeast of Structure 1 (see Figure 5-4). The
pit had a dark brown (10YR 3/3) loamy fine
sand fill, with visible charcoal and bone
flecks; flotation samples recovered a few
pieces of lithic debris from the feature fill (see
Table 5-2).

Another small pit in the area of the Structure 3
ramada is Feature 57 (Figure 5-26). Its
estimated volume is 0.023 m3, not large
enough to hold even a bushel of plant foods.
The pit is circular in shape, but conical in
profile, with relatively straight sides and a
gently rounded bottom. Feature fill is a dark
brown (10YR 3/3) loamy fine sand, with
charcoal flecking. It had a small assortment of
ceramic and lithic artifacts, charred plant
remains, and animal bone in its fill (see Table
5-2).
Feature 76 is by far the largest and most
complex pit feature exposed at the Lang
Pasture site. This pit feature—and its sub-pit
features 76A, 76B, 76C, and 76D—are
situated about 5 m northeast of Structure 1,

Technical Report No. 174202

and just northeast of the Structure 3 ramada
and its associated outdoor activity area.
The pit measures approximately 3.6 m northsouth by 2.1 m east-west (Figures 5-27 and 5­
28), and is somewhat oblong in shape. The pit,
marked primarily by dark brown (10YR 3/3)
charcoal-flecked
sediments
but
with
significant pockets of dark yellowish-brown
(10YR 3/4 and 10YR 4/6) and strong brown
(7.5YR 4/6) fill (especially near the base of
the pit), was first well-defined at 40 cm bs (but
was noted at 30 cm bs in several plan
views)—near the contact of Zones II and III—
and extended to 135 cm bs (Figure 5-29; see
also Figure 5-28). The pit cut at least 60 cm
into the red clay B-horizon (see Figure 5-29).

Chapter 5: Stratigraphy, Features, and Radiocarbon Dates

After the Feature 76 pit was excavated and
used presumably for storage purposes, it was
abandoned. At the point of abandonment, and
before the pit had seen the accumulation of

sediments/trash in it, the burial of a child or
juvenile (Feature 76D was excavated into the
central part of the floor of the pit (Figure 5­
27).

Chapter 5: Stratigraphy, Features, and Radiocarbon Dates

Sometime later (perhaps only a matter of a
few days), some sediments had begun to
accumulate in the bottom of the pit (Zone 2E
in Figure 5-29), at which point a large ceramic
sherd deposit (Zones 2C and 2D) and
additional sediments were dumped in the pit,
immediately above the Feature 76D burial.
Following this, two extended adult burials
(Features 76B and 76C) were laid side by side
in the floor of Feature 76, with the Feature
76B burial placed to be almost directly above
that of the earlier Feature 76D burial (see
Figure 5-25); this implies that little time
separated the three burials.
A post hole (Feature 83) at the western end of
Feature 76B may represent a burial marker
post placed by the Caddo. The Feature 76C
burial was then nestled into the southern part
of Feature 76, with its head at the eastern end
of the burial pit. After these mortuary events
had been concluded, the pit was filled up.
Finally, at an unknown interval after the
mortuary episodes, when the Feature 76 pit
was full of sediments to ground level, another
pit feature (Feature 76A) was excavated into
the larger pit, extending to the approximate
base of the older pit, and having cut through
the earlier Feature 76C burial (see Figures 5­
27 and 5-29).
The estimated volume of Feature 76 is 7.18
m2, large enough to hold more than 200
bushels (4670 kg) of plant foods. If maize
kernels were held in Feature 76, the volume
would be sufficient to meet the dietary
requirements of 8-9 families for a year,
suggesting that it may have been a shared
multi-household storage feature. This also
suggests that the Lang Pasture site was
occupied by multiple Caddo households, the
majority of which remain uninvestigated on
private property outside the TxDOT ROW.
The pit had steep and straight walls on one
side, where the later Feature 76A pit had been
cut into it (Figure 5-30a-b), but otherwise its
walls are gently sloping, with a relatively flat

100

bottom. Large quantities of artifacts were
found in the feature fill, especially ceramic
sherds, lithics (including several arrow points),
wood charcoal and nutshells, and animal bone
(see Table 5-2).
The Feature 76A pit has a very dark grayishbrown (10YR 3/2) loamy fine sand fill, with
patches of very dark brown (10YR 2/2)
sediments pieces of charcoal, and charcoal
flecks. The obvious charcoal staining of
Feature 76A clearly contrasts in plan and
profile to the earlier and older Feature 76 pit
feature into which it had been dug by the
Caddo (Figure 5-31a-b).
Feature 76A has an estimated volume of 1.01
m3. The pit feature could have held
approximately 28 bushels (660 kg) of plant
foods, sufficient to hold a year’s worth of
maize for a single household. This feature may
have replaced one of the other probable
storage pits in use at the site, as underground
storage pits were sequentially used and
abandoned. New pits used for storage were
dug by the Caddo occupants when the old pits
were no longer usable—either because they
were unable to successfully preserve foods
buried in the pits or they were too much
trouble to maintain. Excavations of the pit
recovered an assortment of fragmentary
ceramic and lithic artifacts, charred plant
remains, and animal bones, indicative of trash
disposal once its probable storage function had
ceased.
Feature 79 is one of the larger and deeper pit
features identified and excavated at the Lang
Pasture site. It is located about 2 m directly
north of the northern wall of Structure 1, and
is probably the principal storage feature that
was used by the Caddo household that lived
there. The pit would have held at least an
estimated 26 bushels (600 kg) of plant foods,
more than sufficient to feed a family of five
for one year if maize contributed 55-60% of
their total diet.

This pit feature had gently sloping sides and a
rounded bottom (Figures 5-32 and 5-33a-b).
Its fill ranged from a very dark brown (10YR
2/2) to a dark brown (10YR 3/3) loamy fine
sand, with charcoal flecking. Significant
amounts of trash—including ceramic and
lithic artifacts, charred plant remains
(including nutshells), animal bone, and firecracked rock—were recovered from the
feature fill (see Table 5-2).
Feature 81 is a circular pit (0.049 m3 in
estimated volume, ca. 1.4 bushels) about 4 m
north of Structure 1, in an area with no other
features or pits. In profile, it has relatively
straight and deep sides and a flat bottom
(Figure 5-34). The charcoal-stained feature fill
contained a few ceramic sherds and pieces of
lithic debris as well as moderate amounts of
charred plant remains and animal bones (see
Table 5-2).
Feature 82, a medium-sized pit (ca. 0.134 m in
estimated volume, and thus able to hold ca. 3.8
bushels or 90 kg of plant foods if it were used
for storage) about 1 m north of Structure 1—

and just south of Feature 79. The pit has a flat
bottom and gently sloping side walls (Figure
5-35). It has a mottled dark yellowish-brown
(10YR 3/6) loamy fine sand fill, with lithic
debris and small amounts of charred plant
remains and animal bones (see Table 5-2),
probably discarded as trash by the Structure 1
inhabitants.
Feature 84 is another pit just north of Structure
1. It is basin-shaped, with sloping sides and a
rounded bottom, with an estimated volume of
ca. 0.037 m3. It has a dark brown (10YR 3/3)
loamy fine sand fill, with charcoal flecks.
Flotation samples of the pit fill recovered
ceramic sherds, lithic artifacts, a few animal
bones, and 20 g of charred plant remains (see
Table 5-2).
Feature 85 is one of three pits (the others are
Features 86 and 87) found in a cluster west of
the Feature 8 burial, and 10+ m north of
Structure 1.

Feature 85 (Figures 5-36 and 5-37) is 65 x 60
cm in size, with an estimated volume of 0.066
m3, or large enough to have held ca. 2 bushels
of food stuffs. The pit has sloping sides and a
rounded bottom (see Figure 5-36), with a dark
brown (10YR 3/3) loamy fine sand fill with
charcoal flecking. Only small amounts of
ceramics, lithics, charred plant remains, or
animal bones were recovered from the
flotation of the feature fill (see Table 5-2).
Feature 86 is virtually the same size as Fea.
85, but it was excavated much deeper (to 86
cm bs), and consequently has a larger
estimated volume: 0.165 m3 or large enough to
hold ca. 4.7 bushels (ca. 110 kg) of plant
foods. The pit is roughly circular, with
sloping sides and a rounded bottom (Figure 5­
38). The feature fill is a brown (10YR 5/3)
loamy fine sand with visible pieces of charcoal
and charcoal flecking. Large amounts of wood
charcoal (170 g) were recovered in the
flotation of the fill of Feature 86, along with a
few pieces of animal bone and lithic artifacts.
Feature 87 is a slightly larger oval-shaped pit
feature about 1 m northeast of Feature 86. Its
volume is estimated at ca. 0.071 m3, only large
enough to hold about 50 kg of plant food
stuffs. The pit has gently sloping side walls
and a rounded bottom (Figure 5-39), with
brown (10YR 5/3) loamy fine sand fill. Its
artifact content is minimal (see Table 5-2),
suggesting only incidental materials ended up
in the pit as it was filled and abandoned.
5.2.5

Smudge Pits

Smudge pits are small (ca. 20-30 cm in
diameter) pit features with distinctive
organically-enriched and charcoal-stained

Technical Report No. 174202

sediment fills. Charred corn cobs are often
found in smudge pits as well as other organic
materials (i.e., pine cones, sweet gum balls,
etc.), and it seems likely that they were used as
fuels, probably to produce large amounts of
smoke to keep the insects away, or for
smoking hides (cf. Binford 1967). Trinkley
(1995:126) notes that in such pits, “the
material was burned in an oxygen-starved
environment. As a result, the materials were
uniformly carbonized rather than reduced to
ash.” Smoking fires such as these smudge pits
would have helped to keep mosquitoes and
gnats away while the Caddo were working
outside in areas where foods were being
heated and cooked.
A total of four smudge pits are present at the
Lang Pasture site (Table 5-8), two in the
ramada area by Structure 1 (Fea. 21 and Fea.
38), another in the outdoor work/activity area
by Structure 2 (Fea. 41), and the third (Fea.
80) north of Fea. 76.
Features 21 and 41 had dark brown (7.5YR
3/3 and 10YR 3/2) charcoal-stained fills, while
Feature 38 had a black (10YR 2/1) charcoalstained fill; corn cob fragments were
recovered from Features 41 and 80. These pits
are roughly circular to oval in shape (Figures
5-40a, 5-41, and 5-42) with shallow sloping
and rounded sides (Figures 5-39b and 5-40).
5.2.6

Outdoor Hearth

The one outdoor hearth (Feature 25) is
northeast of Structure 1 and near the
ramada/elevated work platform (Structure 3).
A 2-sigma calibrated radiocarbon date on
charred materials in Feature 25 has an age
range of AD 1290-1420.

The hearth covers a 70 x 133 cm area of ash,
oxidized soil, and dark brown sediments; it
extends from 20-41 cm bs (Figures 5-43 and
5-44). In profile, the hearth is basin-shaped,
with sloping sides and a fairly flat bottom.
When the hearth was first exposed, it was
marked by dark brown charcoal-stained
sediments and two concentrated pockets of ash
(Figure 5-43a), suggesting that the feature had
held a high-intensity fire, probably used for
outdoor cooking, as there would have been a
“constant flow of oxygen to fuel the flames”
(Shafer 2003:37). Once the contents of the
hearth had been removed, it was apparent that
the hearth basin had been exposed to intense
heat because the surface of the basin had been
oxidized to a dark red color (2.5YR 3/6).
Near the center of the exposed basin at 35 cm
bs, was a large black (10YR 2/2) stain, ca. 35
cm in diameter at exposure (see Figures 5-44
and 5-45b), that resolved itself into a post hole
(Feature 74) that reached to 64 cm bs (see
Table 5-5). This post hole apparently postdates
the active use of Feature 25, as it would make
no practical sense to have a wood post situated
inside a hearth that held a high-intensity fire;
when the post was dug, it apparently cut
through the upper ash deposits, leaving two
remaining ash pockets.
There were considerable quantities of animal
bone, charred plant remains, lithics, and some
mussel shell fragments in the fill of Feature 25
(see Table 5-2). These remains must have
been discarded in the hearth during periods of
active use in outdoor activities associated with
the Structure 1 household occupation.
5.2.7

Fire-Cracked Rock
Concentration

Structure 2 in an apparently associated
outdoor work/activity area. The concentration
of rocks (Figures 5-46 and 5-47) covered a 40
x 25 cm oval-shaped area, with top elevations
ranging between 16-23 cm bs and bottom
elevations of 25-31 cm bs. There was no
evidence of a pit, but the overlapping nature of
the rocks and the differences in their top and
basal elevations suggest these rocks had
become fire-cracked in situ, probably in an
instance of hot rock cooking of plant or animal
foods.
This is the only feature from the Lang Pasture
site that contains fire-cracked rock (n=17
pieces) (see Table 5-2). Other artifacts found
in association with the fire-cracked rock
include a few pieces of lithic debris and wood
charcoal from flotation sediments collected
around the rocks themselves.
5.2.8

Fire-Cracked Rock
Distribution

Although only one fire-cracked rock (FCR)
feature (Feature 35) was defined during the
data recovery excavations at the Lang Pasture
site, pieces of FCR were widely distributed
across the site (Figure 5-48). There are six
notable concentrations of FCR in the block: a
small area south of Structure 2; two FCR
clusters in and immediately adjacent to
Structure 2; a fourth cluster associated with
Feature 35 in an outdoor activity work area
north of Structure 2; a fifth cluster just east of
Structure 1; and a final cluster of FCR from
Feature 76, north of the Structure 3 ramada
and associated outdoor activity area. Very few
pieces of FCR were found within the
boundaries of Structure 1 or Structure 3.

The one fire-cracked rock concentration
(Feature 35) was exposed northeast of

Chapter 5: Stratigraphy, Features, and Radiocarbon Dates

The spatial distribution of FCR suggests that
occasional hot rock cooking activities during
the prehistoric Caddo occupation at the Lang
Pasture site took place primarily in outdoor
activity areas in proximity to the three
structures. Not all of the FCR found at the
Lang Pasture site—perhaps not even half—is
a product of Caddo cooking activities because
hot rock cooking had primarily been replaced
by the extensive use of ceramic vessels for
cooking, as the vertical distribution of FCR in
the clusters just outside Structures 1 and 2
extend below the depths of the Caddo
ceramics found in the same areas (cf. Lohse
2004:Table 3.3). Thus, it is likely that much of
the FCR is from various prehistoric
occupations (dating from ca. 1200-3000 cal.
years B.P.) that predate the principal Caddo
occupation at Lang Pasture.
Interpretation of the Domestic Features
The analysis of the kind and distribution of
features within the TXDOT right-of-way at
the Lang Pasture site indicates that there are
portions of two prehistoric Caddo structures
within it, with some portion of the structures
extending west onto private property (where
they were not investigated). There are no
obvious entrances visible along the post hole
wall arcs, but the one structure excavated at
the A. C. Saunders site (41AN19) has an
entrance along its east side (Kleinschmidt
1982). There is also a well-preserved midden
deposit on private property, about 10 m from
the right-of-way fence (Perttula et al. 2007).
The spatial proximity of the two domestic
Caddo structures and the midden deposit
suggests that these features are part of a
household compound, much like those
identified at the late 17th-early 18th century
A.D. Deshazo site (Good 1982; Story 1982),
the 14th and 15th century A.D. compounds at
the Tallow Grove and Beech Ridge sites
(Perttula 2008a, ed.), all in the Angelina River
basin in East Texas, and the various historic
Caddo compounds on farmsteads documented
from the 1691 Teran de los Rios map of a
Nasoni Caddo village on the Red River
(Swanton 1942:Plate 1), the 1867 Reagle

116

drawing of Caddo George Washington’s
compound (Journal sketch on file, Western
History Collections, University of Oklahoma
Libraries), and 1868-1872 Soule photographs
of Long Hat’s camp (or compound) (Swanton
1942:Plate 14). That is, individual structures
were grouped together into a small compound
arrayed around an open courtyard, with
outdoor activity areas and ancillary facilities
(i.e., ramadas, granaries, or other sorts of
elevated platforms) and shared trash/midden
disposal
areas
(Figure
5-49).
The
documentation of several large pits north of
Structure 1 that may have served as
underground storage facilities suggests that
above-ground granaries were not at use at the
Lang Pasture site during the prehistoric Caddo
occupation. Although the full extent of the
Lang Pasture site is not known, it is likely that
there are several other domestic household
compounds on the private property portion of
the site.
The two domestic structures appear to be
circular, Structure 1 (between N190-196 and
E198-199.5) is an estimated 6.8 m in diameter,
with relatively closely-spaced wall post holes.
There are post holes inside the wall arc
(Features 66, 57, 73) that may be roof or wall
support post holes, and there is also one pit
feature (Feature 37). The second structure
(Structure 2) is less well-defined, with widelyspaced post holes comprising the wall arc. It
extends from N175-184 and E198-200, and
has an estimated diameter of ca. 9 m. There
are two pits (Feature 2 and Feature 29) that
may be associated with the use of the
structure.
There appear to be at least one small arbor or
ramada (i.e., elevated work platform) defined
by a number of post holes, with associated
outdoor working/cooking areas, situated to the
east and northeast of the two house structures.
The first and better defined arbor or ramada
(Structure 3, at N194-197 E200-202) by
Structure 1 is about 2 x 4 m in size, and there
are pits and smudge pits (Features 20 and 36)
and a hearth (Feature 25) under and adjacent
to it.

Also to the east of this cluster of features is
Feature 76, a very large pit feature that also
contained three separate burials (Features
76B-D, with four vessels between them, see
discussion below). The second outdoor
work/activity area, also possibly with an arbor
or ramada and other extramural facilities,
although the pattern of post holes is far from
clear, is at N184 to N186 and E198 to E200,
just outside Structure 2. This outdoor activity
areas has an associated fire-cracked rock
concentration (Feature 35) as well as a few
post holes and small pit features probably used
for cooking.

Spatial Patterns in Domestic Features and
Material Culture Remains
The spatial patterning of artifacts at the Lang
Pasture site provide insights into how different
parts of the site may have been used by its
Caddo occupants as well as insights in to how
Caddo households (structures, courtyards,
activity areas, and trash disposal) in the upper
Neches River basin of East Texas were
spatially organized and arranged. The intra­
site spatial data on artifacts and features from
the Lang Pasture site, even though they
represent only a 40 x 5-6 m slice across one
habitation area, are the first such spatial data
obtained on what surely are the range of

117

Chapter 5: Stratigraphy, Features, and Radiocarbon Dates

discrete prehistoric Caddo households in this
region.
Ceramics
The distribution of each kind of ceramic vessel
sherd—including decorated sherds, plain body
and base sherds, and plain rim sherds—at the
Lang Pasture site provides compelling spatial
data on the importance of outdoor activity
areas for the Caddo households uncovered
during the excavations. Most ceramic vessels
were apparently broken and discarded in the
two outdoor activity areas north and northeast
of Structure 1 and north and east of Structure 2
(Figures 5-50-5-52), including being discarded
in several large pit features (Features 76 and
79). Certainly the highest density of sherd
discard took place around Structure 1.
In the case of Structure 1, only low densities
of sherds are found within its walls, consisting
primarily of plain sherds. This suggests that

118

the structure floor was swept to gather up
broken vessels and vessel fragments that had
been previously broken and stored under beds
or on storage platforms, possibly because of
vessel re-use needs (cf. Arthur 2006:102).
These were then stored or dumped in a broad
scatter north and east of Structure 1, including
the Structure 3 ramada. Decorated sherds were
more abundant within the walls of Structure 2
than was the case for the Structure 1 deposits
(see Figure 5-50), but this was not the case for
either plain sherds or plain rims. The higher
densities of decorated sherds in Structure 1
suggest that decorated vessels or re-used
vessel sections may have been in use by its
Caddo occupants longer in Structure 2 than in
Structure 1, or that the intensity of outdoor
activity use and sherd discard was less around
Structure 2 (perhaps because the occupation
was of a shorter duration) than was the case in
the northern part of the site. There, outdoor
activity areas and features were substantial—
including several large pits—are well-defined.

Pipes
In addition to the ceramic pipes recovered
from two burial features (Features 8 and 93)
and in the Scrape E work, ceramic pipe sherds
are also found in domestic contexts at the
Lang Pasture site. Of the 28 pipe sherds
(Figure 5-53), only four were recovered within
the two domestic structures, with the
remainder being widely distributed to the
north and northeast of Structure 1 and north
and east of Structure 2. The occupants of both
structures apparently had and frequently used
ceramic pipes.
These sherds from broken pipes ended up
being discarded in outdoor activity areas
associated with both structures. This is likely
because most smoking activities took place
outdoors during the course of daily activities
outside the houses, whereas the houses were
used mainly for sleeping and the storage of
foodstuffs and certain domestic material
goods.
Burial Features
To the north of Structure 1, and separated
from that structure by at least 10-17 m, are a
series of Caddo Indian burials (Features 8, 88,

122

91, 92, 93, and 94) from an associated family
household cemetery. These six burials, each of
which contained either one or two individuals
(Feature 93), had ceramic vessel (n=27) and
elbow pipes (n=2) as associated funerary
offerings. The mean number of funerary
offerings from these six burials is 4.83
(ranging from 2-10 items) A second set of
burials (Features 76B, 76C, and 76D) were
placed in Feature 76, a large pit feature, to the
east of Structure 1. These burials had four
ceramic vessels as the sole funerary offerings,
with a mean of only 1.33 funerary offerings
per individual (Table 5-9).
In each of the burials at the Lang Pasture site,
the deceased Caddo individual was laid out in
an extended supine position on the floor of the
burial pit, with funerary offerings placed on
either one or both sides of the body, but also
resting of the burial pit floor. The three burials
placed in Feature 76 were oriented northwestsoutheast (see Table 5-9), with the head of the
individual at the southeastern end of the burial
pit, and facing to the northwest. The other
burials are all laid out in an east-west position,
in two north-south rows, with the head of the
deceased at the eastern end of the burial pit,
and thus facing to the west (Figure 5-54).

Feature 8
This Caddo burial was exposed and excavated
during the 2004 testing at the Lang Pasture
site (see Lohse 2004:22-25). The Feature 8
burial pit is about 8-9 m north of the suite of
Feature 76 burials, 12 m north of Structure 1,
and ca. 6-7 m south of the other burials in the
family household cemetery. The burial had
been previously disturbed by installation of a
telephone line that cut across the burial pit just
below the skull (Figure 5-55b).
The individual was laid out in an extended
supine position in a burial pit that was eastwest in orientation (see Figure 5-55a-c). The
head was at the eastern end of the pit and
faced west, towards the setting sun, and also
the direction in which the soul traveled to the
Caddi-Ayo (Swanton 1942:205, 210). This
east-west orientation in the body is a typical
burial practice of upper Neches River basin
Caddo peoples (see Chapter 11, this volume).
A number of funerary offerings were placed in
the Feature 8 burial pit, including seven
ceramic vessels and an elbow pipe. The elbow
pipe was placed along the right side of the
body, near the upper right leg (see Figure 5­
55d). The seven vessels included four
carinated bowls (Vessels 1-3 and 5), a bowl
(Vessel 4), a jar (Vessel 6), and a bottle
(Vessel 7). The carinated bowls were placed
on both sides of the body, above the waist, and
one vessel (Poynor Engraved, Vessel 3) was
apparently set atop the body. The one bowl
was by the right arm, the jar by the lower left
leg, and the bottle was placed by the upper left
arm (see Figure 5-55d).
It is a welldocumented prehistoric mortuary practice
among the East Texas Caddo that the water
bottles placed in burials are near the head of
the grave (cf. Gonzalez 2005:58).
One distinctive feature of the Feature 8 burial
pit is a compact area of the burial pit floor at
the foot of the grave (see Figure 5-55d). This
compact area exhibited signs of oxidation and
charcoal flecking, likely because a fire had

126

been placed at the foot of the grave. Gonzalez
(2005:59) indicates that for the Caddo “[i]n
the old days, when a person died, a fire was lit
at the foot of the grave…From the time of
death until the person is laid to rest in the
grave the fire stays lit for six days until food is
taken to the grave.”
Feature 76B, 76C, and 76D
The Feature 76B burial, like Feature 76C, was
placed in an extended position inside the
Feature 76 (see Figure 5-29) basin. The floor
of the burial pit was approximately 44 cm
above the Feature 76D burial pit as well as the
original bottom of the Feature 76 basin.
Feature 76B was interred in a pit directly
above Feature 76D and directly above a
discrete sherd deposit (Zones 2C and 2D in
Figure 5-28) that covered Feature 76D and
provided a platform for the Feature 76B
burial.
Based on the size of the burial pit, the Feature
76B interment was thought to be that of a
Caddo adult. Subsequent analyses by Wilson
(see Chapter 10) indicate it was that of a 6-10
year old child. The head was placed at the
southeastern part of the burial pit, and would
have been facing northwest (Figure 5-56). The
Feature 76B skull rests almost directly above
the skull area of Feature 76D, compelling
evidence—along with the other spatial
relationships mentioned above—that these two
burial features are intimately related, probably
because both individuals were from the same
family and likely also because both the
interments were not separated by much time or
many years.
A deeply-set post hole (Feature 83) at the
western end of the burial pit (see Figure 5-26)
may have been intended to serve as a post
marker for this burial.
Two ceramic vessels were placed in the
Feature 76B burial pit as funerary offerings,
along with the tip of an arrow point. All three
offerings were laid just south of the head,
above the shoulders.

Chapter 5: Stratigraphy, Features, and Radiocarbon Dates

The vessels include a Poynor Plain globular
carinated bowl (Vessel 1) and a unique
engraved-rocker-stamped seed jar or neckless
bottle (Vessel 2, see Chapter 6, this volume).
The arrow point lay between the two vessels.
The Feature 76C burial pit was excavated to
the immediate south of Feature 76B (see
Figure 5-27). The Feature 76C pit was
approximately the same size and same
orientation as Feature 76B (see Table 5-9),
and it is probable that these two burials, both
children (Feature 76C was approximately 8
years old at death), were placed in the larger
Feature 76 basin at the same time. Much of
Feature 76C was disturbed by the Caddo
during their subsequent excavation of the
Feature 76A storage pit, which cut through the
mid-section of this burial pit. What remains
indicates that the deceased was laid on its back
in an extended supine position, with the head
at the southeastern edge of the burial pit,
facing to the northwest.
A single funerary offering was placed in the
Feature 76C burial pit. This was a plain, but
fragmentary, ceramic bowl nestled to the left
of the head, apparently at or immediately
above the shoulder area; the two vessels in
Feature 76B were placed in that burial pit in
the same relationship to the body.
The first burial in the large Feature 76 pit was
Feature 76D, which was dug into the floor of
the pit feature (Figure 5-57). In the absence of
any appreciable bone fragments, the small size
of the burial pit (see Table 5-9) suggests that
this too was the interment of a Caddo child or
juvenile. Wilson’s analyses suggest the
individual was between 3-12 years of age at
death. Associated funerary offerings include a
plain bowl (Vessel 1) with a scalloped lip (see
Chapter 6, this volume), placed near what
would have been the head of the deceased, and
a ground stone tool (see Chapter 7, this
volume) near the right side of the body near its
midsection (see Figure 5-57).

128

The burial pit itself was a dark red (2.5YR
3/6) sandy clay mottled with strong brown
(7.5YR 5/8) sandy clay. It was not clearly
recognized as a burial pit until Vessel 1 was
discovered (its top was at 132 cm bs) while
cleaning the bottom of Feature 76.
Feature 88
Feature 88 is the easternmost of the group of
five burials at the northern end of the Lang
Pasture site (see Figure 5-54). Like Feature 91,
the burial pit was quite shallow (see Table 5­
9).
spatially associated burials are laid out in an
east-west orientation (see Table 5-9), with the
head of the deceased at the eastern end of the
burial pit, facing west. Although the Feature
88 burial pit only held one adult individual
(Figure 5-58), it is the largest of the burial pits
in the cemetery, even larger than the Feature
93 burial pit, into which two adults were laid
to rest
The Feature 88 burial pit was also disturbed
by the installation of a phone line; the phone
line cut across the mid-section of the body
(see Figure 5-58a) and bisected one of the
ceramic vessel funerary offerings.
Two ceramic vessels were placed in the burial
pit with the deceased, a compound vessel or a
wide-mouthed bottle with suspension holes
(Vessel 1) at and above the right side of the
head, and a plain carinated bowl (Vessel 2)
along the left side of the body by the waist
(see Figure 5-58a). There is no evidence of a
fire having been lit in this grave.
Feature 91
Feature 91 was only shallowly excavated by
the Caddo when they interred a deceased adult
individual in this burial pit. The tops of the
two ceramic vessels placed in the grave
(Figure 5-59a-b) were encountered between 7­
10 cm bs.

Technical Report No. 174202

Archeological Investigations at the Lang Pasture Site (41AN38) in the Upper Neches River Basin of East Texas
Texas Department of Transportation

The eastern end of Feature 91 was destroyed
by a utility line/phone line trench (see Figure
5-59a-b), removing any remnants of the skull
or upper body of the deceased, as well as any
funerary offerings that may have been placed
by or above the head. There were no preserved
human remains in the burial pit fill other than
a single tooth. The two recovered funerary
offerings include a Poynor Engraved
compound bowl (Vessel 1) along what would
have been the leg area along the right side of
the body, and a Poynor Engraved carinated
bowl near the waist area, but on the left side of
the body (see Figure 5-59a).
Feature 92
Feature 92 is the northernmost burial in the
western row of burials that includes Features
92, 93, and 94 (see Figure 5-54). These
western burials were placed in deeper burial
pits than Features 88 and 91 in the eastern row

Technical Report No. 174202

of burials (see Table 5-9). Funerary offerings
in general—or at least those that were not
perishable—were generally more abundant in
the western row of burials than in those in the
eastern burial row.
This burial pit was bisected by a second phone
line (Figure 5-60a-b), and the extreme western
or foot portion of the burial pit extends onto
private property. Skeletal remains of the
Caddo adult placed in this burial pit are poorly
preserved, consisting only of the skull and
parts of the arms and legs (see Figure 5-60a).
Two funerary offerings were placed with the
deceased in Feature 92, both ceramic vessels.
The first (Vessel 1) is a small plain bowl by
the upper left leg, and the other is a
rectangular-shaped plain bowl (Vessel 2)
along what would have been the left knee area
(see Figure 5-60a).

Feature 93 is the most distinctive of the burial
features at the Lang Pasture site. First, the fill
of the burial pit is a red to reddish-yellow
sandy clay mixed with a very gravelly red
sandy loam. This particular clay and gravel
deposit is not widely distributed on the site.
The other distinctive aspect of the burial
feature is the fact that it had two deceased
adult individuals placed in it (Figure 5-61). A
phone line cuts across the western end of the
burial pit.
These individuals (A on the north side of the
burial pit, and B on the south side) were
placed side by side, about 50 cm apart, with
their heads resting near the eastern end of the
burial pit (see Figure 5-63). Preserved skeletal
materials included the skulls and the left and
right femurs of both burials. There is a darker
soil stain associated with Individual A,
perhaps the product of decaying organic
materials laid on and around the body’s mid­
section (see Figure 5-60d).

Both individuals had associated funerary
offerings. Individual A had four vessels
(Vessels 1, 2, 3/4A, and 4B, see Chapter 6,
this volume), while Individual B had five
vessels placed with it (Vessels 5-9), along
with an elbow pipe resting by the right upper
leg. In the case of Individual A, one large
vessel (a plain bowl, Vessel 4B) was placed
above the head, another large vessel (Vessel
3/4A, a Poynor Engraved compound bowl
whose fragments were dispersed and
intermixed with Vessel 4B) by the right
shoulder, and two other vessels (Vessels 1 and
2) near the left leg (see Figure 5-61). These
are, respectively, a plain bowl and a small
Poynor Engraved carinated bowl. In the case
of Individual B, the elbow pipe and a small
Poynor Engraved bowl (Vessel 5) were resting
along the right leg. Four other vessels (Vessels
6-9) were set a short distance from the left leg,
all in a row, and reaching up to the left
shoulder area (see Figure 5-60 a, d).

From west to east these funerary vessels
include a plain carinated bowl (Vessel 6), a
plain bottle (Vessel 7), another plain carinated
bowl (Vessel 8), and a medium-sized
Maydelle Incised jar (Vessel 9).

radiocarbon dates have been obtained from
burials at five other upper Neches River

(41AN21), Fred McKee (41AN32), Pierce
Freeman (41AN34), Solon Stanley (41CE3),
and A. H. Reagor (41CE15) (Table 5-11).

Feature 94
The last of the prehistoric Caddo burials at the
Lang Pasture site is in a pit sandwiched
between Feature 92 to the north and Feature
93 to the south (see Figure 5-54). There were
no preserved human remains in the burial pit,
but there were five ceramic vessel funerary
offerings (Figures 5-62a-b and 5-63).

The funerary offerings were apparently placed
along the lower body of the deceased, perhaps
along the right leg. In this same area was a 48
x 38 cm brown (10YR 4/3) and very dark
brown (10YR 2/2) charcoal-flecked soil stain
that is likely the remnants of a small fire that
had been placed on the floor of the burial pit.
Vessel 1 (a small plain bowl) rested amidst
this stained area, and Vessel 2 (a Poynor Plain
globular carinated bowl) had been placed a
short distance to the west of Vessel 1 and the
charcoal-flecked soil stain. The other three
vessels (Vessels 3-5) are in a cluster closer to
the foot of the grave. These vessels include a
small Killough Pinched bowl (Vessel 3), a
small plain carinated bowl (Vessel 4), and a
small plain bowl (Vessel 5).

These 34 radiocarbon dates from the Lang
Pasture site and nearby prehistoric Caddo
cemetery sites in the upper Neches River basin
constitute the largest assemblage of
radiocarbon dates ever obtained from this
region (see Perttula 1998; Story 1990). Taken
together with the very large assemblage of
radiocarbon dates (n=130) from the George C.
Davis site (41CE19), downstream in the

138

middle Neches River basin, they provide the
only comprehensive set of calibrated
radiocarbon dates from an area that heretofore
has had only limited and not necessarily very
successful radiocarbon dating.

The significance of the 34 radiocarbon dates is
two-fold. First, the first 29 calibrated
radiocarbon dates (see Table 5-10) help in
unraveling and establishing the occupational
history of the Lang Pasture site and its various
domestic and burial features, when taken
together with feature stratigraphic and spatial
relationships and associated diagnostic
artifacts recovered in these features. Second,
the radiocarbon dates on Caddo burials from
the Lang Pasture site (n = 6) and other upper
Neches River basin sites (n=5) demarcate the
principal temporal period(s) in which large
numbers of Caddo cemeteries were established
and used in the region, and generally lend
corroboration to the current chronological
ordering of Caddo burials based on ceramic
vessel offerings (cf. Kleinschmidt 1982;
Perttula 2007b) placed with the burials.
The Samples
All 34 radiocarbon samples—whether wood
charcoal, charred hickory (Carya sp.) nutshell,
maize, or human remains—were submitted to
Beta Analytic, Inc. for analysis (see Appendix
B). The results of the analyses by Beta
Analytic, Inc. include the measured

Technical Report No. 174202

radiocarbon age of the dated material (in years
B.P.); the 13C/12C ratio used to correct the
measured radiocarbon age because of the
isotopic fractionation of that material; the
resulting conventional radiocarbon age (in
years B.P.); and the calibrated age range and
calibrated intercepts (following Reimer et al.
2004; Talma and Vogel 1993) of the dated
material. The calibrated age ranges are
determined at 1 sigma (66% probability) and 2
sigma (95% probability), and presented as
years B.C. or A.D. (see Tables 5-10 and 5-11).
Lang Pasture Site
Arranged in chronological order (Figure 5-64),
the 29 calibrated radiocarbon dates from the
Lang Pasture site (see Table 5-10) suggest that
the site was occupied from as early as about
1000 B.C. (2 sigma calibrated age range of
1040-840 BC) to as late as the mid-17th
century (AD 1650), but that occupation was
certainly not continuous. Based strictly on the
calibrated radiocarbon age ranges, the first but
intermittent occupational episode at the site
took place between 1040-840 BC (Feature 82),
followed by a 910 year period of abandonment
(840 BC to AD 70), after which it was

139

Chapter 5: Stratigraphy, Features, and Radiocarbon Dates

occupied and used a second time from AD 70­
330 (Feature 86). The site was again
abandoned between AD 330-570 (a 240 year
period), followed by a more sustained but still
relatively ephemeral use of the site in the 3rd
occupational episode from AD 570-1030 (1st
Radiocarbon Group, Features 16, 29, 30, 79,
and 86).1 A third temporal break in the
radiocarbon series between AD 1030-1260
(with the exception of an anomalous
radiocarbon date from Feature 76A)2 indicates
another period of site abandonment. A 2nd

Radiocarbon Group of dates from features and
burials (Features 8, 20, 25, 36, 37, 41, 45, 76,
76C, 79, 84, 85, and 93) from AD 1260-1470
(at 2 sigma) pertain to the principal prehistoric
Caddo occupation of the Lang Pasture site
during a 4th occupational episode. This
occupational episode is represented by
Structures 1, 2, and 3, most of the post holes
and pit features, and the vast majority of the
recovered decorated and plain ceramics
distributed within and between these structures
and associated features.

Figure 5-63. Plots of 2 Sigma Calibrated Radiocarbon Age Ranges for the 29 Samples from
the Lang Pasture Site (black bars) and Five Samples from Other Upper Neches River Basin
Caddo Sites (red bars).

There are four calibrated radiocarbon dates
from Lang Pasture features (the 3rd
Radiocarbon Group: Feature 20, 76, 88, and
92)3 that suggest the site was also used
sometime after AD 1450. However, given that
140

three of these dates (Feature 76, 88, and 92)
have age ranges that reach to AD 1950 and
modern times (and hence have been
contaminated
by
modern
radiocarbon
materials), with intercepts of AD 1770, 1780,

Technical Report No. 174202

Archeological Investigations at the Lang Pasture Site (41AN38) in the Upper Neches River Basin of East Texas
Texas Department of Transportation

1800, 1940, and 1950 (Feature 76), among
others, lends little if any confidence in any
assertion that the Lang Pasture site was used
by the Caddo after the 15th century. Thus, the
3rd Radiocarbon Group from the Lang Pasture
site (see Figure 5-64) is not thought to
represent a coherent group of dates from a 5th
and final occupational episode. Instead, it is
much more likely—as well as consistent with
the number and internal consistency of dates
from the 4th occupational episode)—that the
Lang Pasture was abandoned in the latter part
of the 15th century, certainly by ca. AD 1470.
The 2nd Radiocarbon Group
The results of the radiocarbon dating from the
Lang Pasture site, although not without its
problems (see End Notes 1-3) and its
inconsistencies, suggest with some confidence
that the principal occupation of the site took
place during an occupational episode that took
place (at 2 sigma, with a 95% probability)
sometime between AD 1260-1470 (see Figure
5-64 and Table 5-10). An examination of the
results of the calibrated radiocarbon dates in
the 2nd Radiocarbon Group on maize from
nine different contexts in this component
(maize within Structure 1, Feature 20, Feature
36, Feature 41, Feature 45, Feature 76, Feature
79, Feature 84, and Feature 85) narrows the
likely period of the principal domestic
occupation of the site by the Caddo to an 80
year interval between ca. AD 1320-1400, prior
to the estimated beginning of the Frankston
phase.
The mean calibrated age range of the nine
aforementioned 1 sigma maize dates from the
Lang Pasture site is AD 1335-1386. The mean
calibrated age range of the 2 sigma maize
dates is AD 1323-1404; the mean calibrated
intercept age for the maize dates is AD 1358.
If averaging the age ranges of the calibrated
maize dates is a reasonable way to proceed—
and it is thought to be a reasonable approach
because the same kind of plant material is
being dated in each case and the dates are also
temporally consistent—then the principal
domestic occupation at the Lang Pasture site
was by Caddo peoples from the first quarter of

Technical Report No. 174202

the 14th century A.D. to the first few years of
the 15th century A.D.
Calibrated Dates on Lang Pasture Site
Caddo Burials
Six of the Caddo burials from the Lang
Pasture site have calibrated radiocarbon dates
(Features 8, 76B, 76C, 88, and 92, and Burial
2 in Feature 93) (see Table 5-10). The
calibrated age ranges for these burials as a
group are ambiguous, to say the least. Two of
the calibrated dates—from Feature 88 and
Feature 92—are rejected out of hand because
the age ranges extend to modern times,
indicating contamination with materials with
modern carbon content, with calibrated
intercepts ranging almost impossibly from AD
1650, 1670, 1770, 1800, 1940, and 1950. As
the Caddo abandoned the upper Neches River
basin by the middle of the 18th century, and
none of the decorated vessels found with these
two burials (see Chapter 6, this volume) have
the kinds of decorative styles documented on
vessels from post-AD 1650 contexts (see
Kleinschmidt 1982; Perttula 2007b), the dates
are clearly too young and of no real assistance
in establishing the age range of the mortuary
features at the Lang Pasture site.
Another mortuary feature (Feature 76B) has a
2 sigma calibrated age range on a small
sample of human remains of AD 710-960 (see
Table 5-10). This calibrated age range appears
to be at least 400-700 years too old given the
apparent age of the pit feature (AD 1300­
1430) within which it was emplaced, as well
as given the age of the adjacent Feature 76C
(AD 1290-1420) burial, since both Feature
76B and 76C appear to have been interred at
approximately the same time (see Figures 5-27
and 5-29) within the partially filled Feature 76
basin. Another cause for concern about the
accuracy of the Feature 76B calibrated date is
the placement of a Poynor Plain vessel, a
likely Frankston phase ceramic vessel form, as
a funerary offering with this burial feature.
With the discarding of the unreliable and
apparently inaccurate calibrated radiocarbon
dates from Features 76B, 88, and 92, we are

141

Chapter 5: Stratigraphy, Features, and Radiocarbon Dates

left with 2 sigma calibrated radiocarbon dates
from Feature 8 (AD 1410-1470, with an
intercept of AD 1440), Feature 76C (AD
1290-1420, with intercepts of AD 1320, 1350,
and 1390), and Feature 93, Burial 2 (AD
1310-1440, with an intercept of AD 1410).
These burials have similar C13/C12 ratios (­
15.6 o/oo to -17.6 o/oo) (see Table 5-10).
Given the mean calibrated age range (at 2
sigma) of AD 1323-1404 for the principal
domestic occupation at the Lang Pasture site
(see above), and the AD 1290-1420 and AD
1310-1440 age ranges for Features 76C and
93, it appears to be the case that the majority,
if not all, of the burials at the site were interred
by Caddo peoples during the course of the
settlement there. Burial 8, which was by itself
(see Figure 5-4) and separated from the
Feature 76 burial cluster and the northern
burial cluster (Features 88, 91-94), may have
been interred shortly after the domestic
occupation at the Lang Pasture site had ended,
or at least had ended in the portion of the
domestic farmstead compound investigated in
the TxDOT right-of-way. The site as a whole
likely continued to be occupied for some years
after the first quarter of the 15th century A.D.
(see Perttula et al. 2007).
Other Upper Neches River Basin Sites
Based on the associated ceramic vessels found
with Caddo burials at the Emma Owens
(41AN21), Fred McKee (41AN32), Pierce
Freeman (41AN34), Solon Stanley (41CE3),
and A. H. Reagor (41CE15) sites, these burials
were thought to date to either Frankston (ca.
A.D. 1400-1650) or Allen phase (ca. A.D.
1650-1800) times (cf. Kleinschmidt 1982;
Perttula 2007b). In fact, Kleinschmidt’s (1982:
Table 19) seriation of mortuary components in
the upper Neches River basin indicated that
the Emma Owens site cemetery dated to the
Allen phase, the cemeteries at the Fred
McKee, Pierce Freeman, and A. H. Reagor
dated to the Frankston 3 sub-phase (ca. A.D.
1570-1650), and the Solon Stanley cemetery
was a Frankston 1 sub-phase (ca. A.D. 1400­
1480) component. Only the Solon Stanley
cemetery was thought to be generally

142

contemporaneous
with
the
principal
prehistoric Caddo occupation at the Lang
Pasture site.
The Emma Owens calibrated radiocarbon age
range on burial G from the site (see Cole
1975:120-129) is the youngest of the five
assays in this group of other upper Neches
River basin sites. It has a calibrated intercept
of AD 1640, and a 2 sigma age range of AD
1470-1660 (see Table 5-11 and Figure 5-64).
These results suggest that this burial was
interred in the middle of the 17th century, near
or at the estimated beginning of the Allen
phase.
The discrepancy between the calibrated age
ranges of the Emma Owens assay and the
ceramic seriation estimates for the age of
Allen phase components are attributed to the
difficulty in precisely and accurately dating
archeological occupations that fall after AD
1500 because of rapid changes in atmospheric
14
C levels after this time (Stuiver 1993:67-68).
Because the period after AD 1500 is
characterized by extreme and short-term
atmospheric radiocarbon fluctuations, there
are numerous “wiggles” or inversions in
current calibration curves. These “wiggles” on
the calibration curve create increasingly
imprecise calendrical age ranges for dates that
fall between AD 1500 and AD 1940, as does
the one radiocarbon date from the Emma
Owens site. The chronological resolution of
the Caddo occupation at the Emma Owens site
(based as it is on one calibrated radiocarbon
date) is consequently not likely to be
particularly precise. This is because of the
number of calibration curve intercepts that can
occur in post-AD 1500 assays as a result of
these “wiggles,” and the broader calibrated
age ranges around those intercepts that are
also characteristic of this part of the
calibration curve (Miller 1996:50 and Figure
II.13). As Miller (1996:54) has indicated, most
calibrated dates that fall after 350 years B.P.
(AD 1600) will “span the entire period”
between AD 1600 and the present.
The mean age range at 1 sigma for the
calibrated radiocarbon dates from the

Technical Report No. 174202

Archeological Investigations at the Lang Pasture Site (41AN38) in the Upper Neches River Basin of East Texas
Texas Department of Transportation

Frankston 3 sub-phase burials is AD 1500­
1598 and the mean age range is AD 1470­
1620 at 2 sigma; the mean calibrated intercept
is AD 1560. These calibrated dates do overlap
with the estimated age of Frankston 3 subphase components in the upper Neches River
basin, and moreover, these mean calibrated
dates and intercepts indicate that the burials
from the Fred McKee, Pierce Freeman, and A.
H. Reagor sites are approximately 40 to 80
years older than the Emma Owens Allen phase
burial.
The final calibrated radiocarbon date—from
the Solon Stanley site—is temporally
anomalous and at least 250 years too old given
its Frankston 1 sub-phase age based on
associated funerary offerings from the burials
(see Kleinschmidt 1982; Woolsey 1935a). The
13C/12C stable carbon isotope ratio from the
human remains from this site (-19.9 o/oo,
indicating a low consumption of maize) is also
anomalous if this is purely a Frankston phase
cemetery, because the 13C/12C ratios from the
other upper Neches River Caddo sites range
between -12.0 o/oo and -14.9 o/oo (see Table
5-11). These isotope values are consistent with
a maize-rich diet (an estimated 47-69%
percent of the diet would have come from
maize or other C4 plants). The Solon Stanley
site 13C/12C ratio is also higher than that
detected with any of the Lang Pasture site
burials (see Table 5-10), as those values range
from -15.6 o/oo to -19.6 o/oo.
There is no question that the associated
ceramic vessels, arrow points (two Perdiz
points) and pipes collected from the Solon
Stanley site are from Frankston phase burials,
but there is a question about the date on the
human remains themselves, since the human
remains from the four burials (AK-1 to AK-4)
have been commingled at the Texas
Archeological Research Laboratory (Diane
Wilson, personal communication, 2008).
Because of previous disturbances from earlier
looting activities before the University of
Texas work at the site in November 1935, only
one of the burials at the Solon Stanley
cemetery still had in situ funerary offerings
(burial AK-2), and only two burials (AK-1 and

Technical Report No. 174202

AK-2) had much in the way of preserved
human remains. Burial AK-2 was one of three
(AK-2 to AK-4) that was oriented east-west,
with the head to the east, a typical Frankston
phase burial orientation (see Chapter 11, this
volume). Burial AK-1 had no remaining
funerary offerings but there were recovered
human remains. This burial was unusual if it is
a Frankston phase burial, however, in that its
orientation was northeast-southwest, with the
head to the northeast; this burial orientation
direction may represent a chronologically
earlier but still rarely used Caddo burial
practice, a suggestion that could be verified if
it could be established with certainty that the
cal AD 1030-1230 radiocarbon age obtained
from the human remains at the Solon Stanley
site came from burial AK-1 instead of the
three more obvious Frankston phase burials.
Unfortunately, this does not appear to be
feasible with the available information at the
Texas Archeological Research Laboratory,
including Woolsey’s (1935a) sketchy report.
Thus, all that can be concluded about the
Solon Stanley site calibrated radiocarbon age
on the human remains was that some use of
the site for burial interment was made by the
Caddo between AD 1030-1230, and that at
that time, maize was not the principal food
resource in one upper Neches River basin
Caddo individual’s diet.
End Notes
1. There are conflicting radiocarbon age
ranges from both Feature 79 and Feature 86
(see Table 5-10). Those from Feature 79 are
separated by more than 600 years, but its
contents (including more than 140 Caddo
sherds and one Perdiz arrow point) indicates
that the later of the two dates (AD 1260-1390,
2 sigma) is most likely the accurate age range.
In the case of Feature 86, the 2 sigma
calibrated age ranges (AD 70-330 and AD
680-890) are between 560-610 years apart. Its
archeological content (Table 5-2) is of no
particular use in evaluating its most likely age,
other than to conclude that Feature 86 predates
the principal Caddo occupation of the Lang
Pasture site.

143

Chapter 5: Stratigraphy, Features, and Radiocarbon Dates

2. The AD 1050-1260 calibrated age range for
charred plant remains from Feature 76A
appears to be inaccurate. First, the best two
calibrated radiocarbon dates from Feature
76—into which Feature 76A intrudes (see
above)—have age ranges of AD 1300-1430.
Since Feature 76A intrudes into Feature 76, it
must have been dug by the Caddo sometime
after AD 1300-1430. The AD 1050-1260 date
on charred materials from Feature 76A, if
accepted at face value, would imply that the
Feature 76A pit was dug prior to Feature 76,
which is an impossibility, since the excavation
of the larger Feature 76 pit would have
destroyed Feature 76A. The plan maps and
profiles of the Feature 76 pit complex (see
Figures 5-30 and 5-31) clearly indicate that
Feature 76A postdates the excavation of
Feature 76, but probably not by many years. It
is likely that the charred materials submitted
for dating from Feature 76A represent a
combination of plant remains that derived
from the 3rd and 4th occupational episodes at
the Lang Pasture site.

3. There are two conflicting radiocarbon dates
from Feature 20, one falling in the 2nd
Radiocarbon Group (AD 1290-1420, 2 sigma,
with calibrated intercepts of AD 1320, 1350,
and 1390) and the other falling in the 3rd
Radiocarbon Group (AD 1450-1650, 2 sigma,
with intercepts of AD 1500, 1600, and 1610)
(see Table 5-10). The source of the 200+ year
discrepancy between the two dates is not
known. Similarly, Feature 76 has three
calibrated radiocarbon dates, two with
identical age ranges (AD 1300-1430, 2 sigma,
with AD 1400 intercepts) and a third that
ranges from AD 1650-1950 (2 sigma, with
intercepts of AD 1670, 1780, 1800, and 1950).
The fact that this third calibrated date extends
into modern times indicates that the dated
material was either contaminated in some
unknown respect before it was submitted to
Beta Analytic, Inc. or was comprised
primarily of modern charred plant remains. In
either event, this third calibrated date from
Feature 76 is unreliable and archeologically
unrealistic.

CHAPTER 6
6THE CERAMIC ARTIFACTS FROM THE LANG PASTURE SITE (41AN38) AND
THE PLACE OF THE SITE WITHIN AN UPPER NECHES RIVER BASIN CADDO
CERAMIC TRADITION
Timothy K. Perttula

6.1

INTRODUCTION

The analysis of the recovered ceramic sherds,
vessels, and pipes from the Lang Pasture site
(41AN38), as well as other generally
contemporaneous prehistoric Caddo sites in
the upper Neches River basin, emphasizes the
acquisition of information on the stylistic and
technological character of the prehistoric
Caddo ceramic assemblage. Chronology,
social relationships, culinary traditions, the
context of ceramic manufacture and
production, and exchange/interaction between
Caddo groups are each to be addressed in this
chapter employing the abundant ceramic
vessel sherds and sherds recovered from the
Lang pasture site during 2006 excavations,
with the goal of assessing the place of the
Caddo pottery made and used at the Lang
Pasture site within the context of upper
Neches River basin ceramic traditions and
practices.
Certainly a principal research issue includes
first refining or bracketing the age and intra­
site chronological relationships of the
ceramics at the site, starting from the available
radiocarbon (Ch. 5, this volume) and TL dates
(Appendix C, this volume) from features, and
investigating differences and similarities in
ceramic
decoration
and
manufacture.
Attributes of the ceramics are then employed
to establish the occupational history of the site
as reconstructed from ceramic stylistic
analyses (particularly variation in decorative
elements and motifs in both the utility ware
and fine ware), and then determining structure
and feature relationships through time by

Technical Report No. 174202

defining distinct ceramic assemblages from
the southern and northern parts of the Lang
Pasture site.
These same stylistic analyses are employed to
answer broader questions of the social and
cultural affiliation of the post-A.D. 1300
Caddo groups in the upper Neches River basin
and the place of the Lang Pasture site within
this community of Caddo people, through
stylistic
and
vessel
morphological
comparisons with collections from other
broadly contemporaneous Caddo sites in the
local area. These include Texas Archeological
Research Laboratory (TARL) collections of
sherds and whole vessels from the best known
Caddo sites in the local area, building on the
comparative analyses already completed by
Campbell (1936), Gilmore (1983), and
Kleinschmidt (1982): the Mrs. J. M. Cook
(41AN1), J. M. Cook Farm (41AN2), Fred
McKee (41AN32), Mrs. J. W. Blackburn
(41CE4), Omer and Otis Hood (41CE14), E.
W. Henry (41CE17), and R. J. Fair (41CE25)
sites, and whole vessels from the Vanderpool
site (41SM77) in the Buddy Calvin Jones
collection (Figure 6-1). We are also concerned
with determining the character and frequency
of the utility ware vessel forms in any
prehistoric Caddo households and components
at the site, and how their composition at the
assemblage level may be related to (and
influenced by) the postulated intensification of
maize consumption by Late Caddo groups in
northeastern Texas (see SU 9 in Kenmotsu and
Perttula 1993:140), as well as differences in
culinary and plant food storage traditions.

145

Chapter 6: Ceramic Artifacts from the Lang Pasture Site (41AN38) and the Place of the Site Within an Upper
Neches River Basin Caddo Ceramic Tradtion

The stylistic analysis of the Lang Pasture site
ceramics will focus on the definition of
recognizable decorative elements in the fine
wares (i.e., the engraved and red-slipped
vessels, including carinated bowls and bottles)
and utility wares (i.e., the coarse-paste
decorated vessels), usually cooking or storage
jars and simple bowls. These wares are known
to have been made and used differently, based
on functional, technological, and stylistic
analyses on numerous Caddo sherd
assemblages in the broader East Texas region,
with uses ranging from food service, cooking
of food stuffs, as containers for liquids, and
for plant food/seed crop storage. The ceramic
analysis will be completed in conjunction with
formal and technological analyses of vessels
and vessel sections (from macroscopic
analyses of sherd cross-sections), from the
detailed analysis of more than 750 plain and
decorated sherds (see Appendix F.1 and F.2),
as well as a sample of the plain rim sherds
(n=41), emphasizing paste characteristics,
non-plastic inclusions, surface treatments, and
firing environments of the decorated and plain
sherd assemblages. The whole vessels from
the Lang Pasture site are examined in similar
detail, as are the whole vessels from the
mortuary assemblages mentioned above
(Appendix F.3 and F.4).
6.2

ORGANIZATION OF THE
CHAPTER

In this chapter, I will begin with the analysis
of the decorated and plain vessel sherds
recovered from the Lang Pasture site, leading
to a detailed presentation of the fine wares and
utility wares in the assemblage as well as the
definition of distinct southern and northern
ceramic assemblages at the site. These
assemblages apparently represent the remains
from sequent Caddo occupations between ca.
A.D. 1320-1400 (see Chapter 5, this volume).
The rim and lip form of the plain rim sherds,
as well as the decorated rim sherds, are then
discussed, along with a consideration of
orifice diameter differences in the vessels
from domestic contexts at the site.

146

Next, I consider important technological
attributes of the domestic ceramics, including
the use of different tempers, the character of
the vessel sherd paste, and firing conditions.
These analyses will demonstrate the essential
continuity in ceramic manufacture and
practice during the course of the Caddo
occupation at the Lang Pasture site.
Other ceramic artifacts have been recovered
from the Lang Pasture site, including clay
elbow pipes from both domestic and mortuary
contexts, ornaments, and a possible ear spool.
These are also discussed in this chapter, as are
the different decorative and temporal styles of
clay elbow pipes now documented in the
upper Neches River basin.
Due to their great length, Tables 6-1 and 6-17
can be found on the compact disk that is
inserted in a sleeve in the back cover of this
report.
They comprise Appendix G.
Additional tabulations of raw ceramic data are
also found on the same disk, as are the tables
in Appendix F.
Whole vessels placed in graves as funerary
offerings are also discussed in Chapter 6,
including the vessels from the burials at the
Lang Pasture site. The focus is on the (a)
shape, size, temper, firing, and decoration of
these vessels, which come from a number of
nearby cemeteries; (b) the recognition and
definition of new Caddo pottery types and
varieties in the upper Neches River basin; (c)
stylistic and technological changes in the
vessels for the period from ca. A.D. 1300­
1650; and (d) comparisons among other
Caddo traditions in the kinds and proportions
of ceramic vessels placed as mortuary goods
with the deceased.
I conclude the chapter with a synthesis of the
domestic and mortuary ceramic assemblages
from the Lang Pasture site, along with a
consideration of the place of this Caddo
occupation in the ceramic tradition of practice
documented for 14th to mid-17th century
Caddo groups living in the upper Neches
River basin.

throughout the upper Neches River basin are
also reviewed in the synthesis to provide a

assemblages.
6.3

METHODS OF ANALYSIS OF THE
VESSEL SHERDS

Detailed analysis of the decorated and plain
ceramic sherds from the Lang Pasture site
(Appendix F.1 and F.2) is based on differences
in temper, type of sherd (i.e., rim, body, or
base), rim and lip form (cf. Brown
1996:Figure 2-12), decoration (if present),
surface treatment (smoothing, burnishing, or
polishing; see Rice 1987), and firing
conditions (cf. Teltser 1993). Sherd crosssections were inspected macroscopically and
with a 10X hand lens to determine the
character of the paste and its inclusions.
Determining the firing conditions is based on
the identification of the firing core in the sherd
cross-sections and the identification of
oxidation patterns as defined in Teltser
(1993:535-536 and Figure 2a-h; see also
Perttula 2005, ed.).
More specifically, the following attributes
were employed in the analysis of the ceramics
from the Lang Pasture site: (a) temper, the
deliberate and indeterminate materials found
in the paste (Rice 1987:411), including a
variety of tempers (grog or crushed sherds,
burned bone, and hematite) and “particulate
matters of some size;” (b) although most of
the sherds are small and thus from
indeterminate vessel forms, where sherds were
large enough, vessel form categories that
could be identified include open containers
(bowls and carinated bowls) and restricted
containers, including jars and bottles. Other
form attributes include rim profile (outflaring
or everted, direct or vertical, and inverted) and
lip profile (rounded, flat, or folded to the
exterior, among others). Observations on
ceramic
sherd
cross-sections
permit

148

consideration of oxidation patterns (Teltser
1993:Figure 2), namely the conditions under
which a vessel was fired and then cooled after
firing. Finally, wall thickness was recorded in
millimeters (mm), using a vernier caliper,
along the mid-section of the sherd.
With respect to interior and exterior surface
treatment on the sherds, the primary methods
of finishing the surface of Caddo vessels
includes smoothing, burnishing, and polishing,
although a few sherds may still have scraping
marks from initial surface treatment work by
the potter. Brushing, a popular method of
roughening the surface of Middle, Late, and
Historic Caddo cooking jars in the
Neches/Angelina river basins with stiff
bundles of grasses, is considered a decorative
treatment here rather than solely a functional
surface treatment (cf. Rice 1987:138). A
roughened and brushed pot would certainly
have been easier to pick up and carry than
would an unroughened or smoothed vessel,
but because the brushing was applied to be an
integral part of the decoration of both rim and
body vessel surface, I de-emphasize it as a
surface treatment. Smoothing creates “a finer
and more regular surface…[and] has a matte
rather than a lustrous surface” (Rice
1987:138). Burnishing creates an irregular
lustrous finish marked by parallel facets left
by the burnishing tool (perhaps a smoothed
pebble or bone). A polished surface treatment
is marked by a uniform and highly lustrous
surface finish, done when the vessel is dry, but
without “the pronounced parallel facets
produced by burnishing leather-hard clay”
(Rice 1987:138).
The application of a hematite-rich clay slip,
black after firing in a reducing environment, is
another form of surface treatment noted in this
assemblage, although it is very rare. The clay
slip was typically applied to the vessel exterior
or both surfaces, and then was burnished or
polished after it was leather-hard or dry; when
the vessel was fired, it created a thin red slip.
In other instances, a kaolin-rich clay (i.e.,
white pigment) or a hematite-rich clay (i.e.,

Technical Report No. 174202

Archeological Investigations at the Lang Pasture Site (41AN38) in the Upper Neches River Basin of East Texas
Texas Department of Transportation

red pigment) was applied as a pigment to
engraved ceramic vessels.

was considered a sherdlet) from areas with
specific intrasite provenience contexts.

Decorative techniques present in the Lang
Pasture site ceramic sherd collections include
engraving, incising, punctation, brushing,
pinching, appliqué, and neck banding, and on
certain sherds, combinations of decorative
techniques (i.e., brushed-incised and brushed­
appliqued, or incised-punctated sherds)
created the decorative elements and motifs.
Engraving was done with a sharp tool when
the vessel was either leather-hard or after it
was fired, while the other decorative
techniques were executed with tools or fingers
(incising, punctations, and pinching with wood
or bone sticks or dowels), by adding strips of
clay to the wet body (appliqué), using frayed
sticks or grass stems (brushing) across the
vessel surface, or corrugating vessel coils
when the vessel was wet or still plastic to
create a series of neck bands. Excising is
considered a form of engraved decoration,
where the clay is deliberately and closely
marked/scraped and carved away with a sharp
tool, usually to create triangular elements or
crescent-shaped elements separating or
defining scrolls.

Ceramic style elements defined and
recognized on sherds and vessels from the
Lang Pasture site simply represent one
classification of different ways of decorating a
vessel by the prehistoric Caddo peoples, and
there is general consensus that shared styles
are “the result of direct cultural transmission
once chance similarity in a context of limited
possibilities is excluded” (Dunnell 1978:199).
If the decorative elements are truly stylistic in
character, they allow the measurement of time
as well as interaction between different but
contemporaneous groups of people (Lyman et
al. 1997:10), along with an assessment of a
potter’s place within a larger tradition of
ceramic practice. Because the lion’s share of
the ceramics are sherds rather than vessels or
sherd vessel groupings, the most accessible
stylistic information from the Lang Pasture
site are the rim and body decorations (often
different on the same vessel), even though
differences in Caddo vessel forms through
time appear to be stylistic as well. According
to Sadie Bedoka, a Caddo-Delaware woman
interviewed by historians employed by the
Works Progress Administration in the 1930s,
“each [Caddo] clan had its own shape to make
its pottery. One clan never thought of making
anything the same pattern of another clan. You
could tell who made the pottery by the shape”
(La Vere 1998:92).

6.4

DECORATED SHERDS

There are 22 different decorative methods
identified in the Lang Pasture site ceramics,
including appliquéd (alone and in combination
with brushed and incised elements), brushed,
brushed-incised, brushed-punctated, brushed­
incised-punctated, engraved (from bowls,
carinated bowls, and bottles), engravedbrushed, engraved-punctated, engraved-lip
notched, incised incised-punctated, lip
notched, neck banded, punctated (including
tool, cane, fingernail, or combinations),
pinched, pinched-punctated, and red-slipped.
Within these general decorative methods, a
number of specific ceramic decorative
elements are defined that represent distinct
kinds
of
decorations
or
decorative
combinations. These decorative elements,
discussed and tabulated in more detail below,
are based only on sherds larger than 1.5 cm in
length and width (any sherd smaller than that

Technical Report No. 174202

I am interested, however, in determining not
only the broad trends in changing ceramic
styles, but also in exploring more-fine-tuned
synchronic and diachronic differences in
stylistic composition and diversity between the
northern and southern areas at the Lang
Pasture site. This dictates a more detailed
consideration of ceramic stylistic variability
and diversity, focusing on decorative elements
(also termed modes). These represent distinct
designs or design combinations (i.e., the
breakdown of individual decorations within an
overall design, as in a hatched triangle, circle,
or tick marks) that can be identified on sherds
and vessel sections (even if it is only a portion
of the element), generally comparable to what

149

Chapter 6: Ceramic Artifacts from the Lang Pasture Site (41AN38) and the Place of the Site Within an Upper
Neches River Basin Caddo Ceramic Tradtion

Schambach et al. (n.d.) term a “recurrent
feature of decoration” within each of the major
decorative methods (e.g., incising, punctating,
engraving, etc.) present in a Caddo ceramic
assemblage. The design elements are defined
at different levels of association, depending
upon variations in the designs (e.g., the
number and spacing of engraved lines on a
rim), the location of the decoration (e.g., on
the rim, body, on the vessel interior, etc.), and
the method of decoration (e.g., horizontal vs.
vertical brushing).

Approximately 12% of the decorated sherds
are from feature contexts—particularly from
Feature 76 (see Table 6-2)—while the
remainder are from habitation deposits in and
around the two domestic structures and
associated extra-mural activity areas situated
in the vicinity of the two structures (see
Chapter 5, this volume). The majority of the
decorated and plain sherds at the Lang Pasture
site are from outdoor contexts, where it is
likely most cooking and food serving activities
took place, as well as trash discard activities.

There are a total of 2588 decorated rim and
body sherds from the Lang Pasture site,
including the decorated sherds from the 2004
test excavations (see Table 6-1, on CD in back
cover).

Archeological Investigations at the Lang Pasture Site (41AN38) in the Upper Neches River Basin of East Texas
Texas Department of Transportation

In addition to the decorated sherds, there are
4,254 plain sherds from the Lang Pasture site,
including 442 plain sherds recovered during
the 2004 test excavations (Perttula 2004:Table
3.6); these plain sherds from the test
excavations were not reanalyzed for this
project. Among these many plain sherds are
144 plain rims from numerous plain vessels
recovered in the data recovery excavations, as
well as 240 base sherds and 3428 plain body
sherds from the same excavations.
In general terms, the decorated sherds from
domestic contexts at the Lang Pasture site are
dominated by utility wares. For the site as a
whole, this includes almost 79% of the
decorated sherds from non-feature domestic
contexts (see Table 6-1) and 70.6% of the
decorated sherds from features (see Table 6­
2); these percentages differ by northern and
southern site areas. These sherds are from
vessels used for cooking, storage, and
probably other culinary activities; they tend to
have a coarse paste, thick body walls, have
smoothed interior surfaces, and are decorated
with wet-paste designs (i.e., decorations were
made with tools and fingers prior to the vessel
being fired, when the vessel had a wet exterior
surface). Fine wares are engraved and redslipped vessels that were used for food service
and to hold liquids, as well as for other
purposes (effigy vessels). They tend to have
fine pastes, with finely crushed tempers, are
frequently burnished on interior and/or
exterior vessel surfaces (except the bottles,
which were burnished on exterior surfaces
only), and have relatively thin body walls
compared to the utility wares. There are other
differences between these two classes of
decorated pottery, and these will be discussed
below where appropriate.
The plain/decorated sherd ratio (P/DR) of the
Lang Pasture ceramic assemblage as a whole
is 1.65. Since the P/DR ratio appears to be
temporally sensitive (see discussion in Chapter
4, this volume; see also Table 4-5), the initial
impression of the P/DR value for the Lang
Pasture site suggests that the Caddo
occupation there took place early in the
Frankston phase (i.e., Group III on Table 4-5),

Technical Report No. 174202

about the same time as, or slightly earlier than,
the Caddo settlement at the Tomato Patch site
(41HE185) at Lake Palestine (cf. Anderson et
al. 1974).
As will become apparent in the discussion of
the character of the decorated sherds from the
Lang Pasture site, the overall P/DR value is
misleading because there are considerable
differences from the southern to the northern
end of the site in the kinds and proportions of
decorated sherds, as well as in the relative
frequency of plain ware vessels (and in the
overall number of plain sherds). This has led
to the scrutiny of the intra-site spatial
character of the decorated sherd assemblage
from Lang Pasture, and the definition of two
different but culturally related ceramic
assemblages, one of which is thought to be
temporally sequent from the other.
6.5

ASSEMBLAGE DEFINITION AT
THE LANG PASTURE SITE
BASED ON DECORATED SHERD
CHARACTERISTICS

As alluded to in the previous sections of this
chapter, the decorated sherds from the Lang
Pasture site appear to derive from two
different but related assemblages, a southern
(between N170 and N188) and a northern
(between N189-209) component/area. In most
measures—kinds and proportions of decorated
sherds, including utility wares; differences in
decorative elements; rim and lip form;
frequency of plain vessels; temper use; and
firing conditions—these two areas represent
temporally
and
spatially
distinctive
assemblages of Caddo utility and fine ware
ceramic vessel sherds that span the period
roughly from ca. A.D. 1320-1400, and perhaps
slightly later in time (see discussion of the
radiocarbon dates in Chapter 5, this volume).
This section of Chapter 6 details the
similarities and differences between the two
assemblages, which appear to be part of the
same regional ceramic tradition, investigates
the likely temporal character of these
differences (based in large measure on
comparisons with other upper Neches River
basin sites and the seriation of ceramic sherds

sherds, and can readily be associated with the
northern area simply by propinquity. These
differences in the proportions of brushed
utility wares were the first and principal basis
for dividing the decorated ceramics from the
Lang Pasture site in spatial terms.

The relative proportions of brushed utility
ware sherds at the Lang Pasture site are the
first clear measure of decorative differences in
the ceramics from one end of the site to the
other. Brushed sherds comprise no less than
44.7% and no more than 70.5% of all the
decorated sherds from all units between N170
and N188, at the southern end of the site (see
Table 6-1); [interestingly, brushed pottery
recovered from a midden (center point
estimated at ca. N189 E184) deposit on private
property at the site comprises 76% of the
decorated sherds, suggesting the midden
accumulated at the end of the southern
ceramic component/area occupation (see
Perttula et al. 2007)]. Conversely, in none of
the units north of N188 do brushed utility
ware sherds amount to more than 38.2% of all
the decorated sherds in each unit, and north of
N193 (and in units with more than 20
decorated sherds), brushed sherds occur in
proportions that range between 12.5-28.3%
(see Table 6-1). Features in the northern area
also have relatively low percentages of
brushed utility ware sherds (see Table 6-2),
amounting to 13.2% of all the decorated

There are other differences in the decorative
style of utility ware and fine ware sherds from
the two site areas, and these will be explored
in more detail below, as will apparent
technological differences in use of temper,
pastes, and firing conditions. Here, I
summarize the main characteristics of the two
different ceramic assemblages (Figure 6-2).
First, fine wares, especially engraved bottles,
are 70% more common in the northern site
component/area than they are in the southern
area (Table 6-3). Lip notched, engraved-lip
notched, and red-slipped fine ware sherds,
although rare overall, are a distinctive feature
of the northern area fine ware assemblage.
Utility wares in the northern ceramic
component/area are dominated equally by
sherds from incised vessels (23.6%), punctated
vessel sherds (17.8%), especially tool and
fingernail punctates, brushed sherds (19.1%),
and vessel sherds with incised-punctated
decorations (7.8%) (see Table 6-3). Sherds
with pinching decorations appear to be more

With the increasing frequency of brushed
utility wares in the southern ceramic
component/area, brushed vessel sherds
comprise 53.8% of all the decorated sherds
here (an 180% increase from the northern
ceramic component/area). This one change in
the manufacture and use of one kind of utility
ware led to considerable reductions in
previously important kinds of decorated utility
wares, and a different character to the overall

Technical Report No. 174202

utility ware assemblage with time: incised
(12.9%, a 45% reduction), incised-punctated
(3.0%, a 62% reduction), and punctated (9.5%,
a 47% reduction) (see Table 6-3). In the
northern ceramic component/area, the incised,
punctated, and incised-punctated vessel sherds
account for 49.2% of all the decorated sherds,
whereas
in
the
southern
ceramic
component/area, that percentage has decreased
to only 25.4%.

155

Chapter 6: Ceramic Artifacts from the Lang Pasture Site (41AN38) and the Place of the Site Within an Upper
Neches River Basin Caddo Ceramic Tradtion

In addition to these substantial differences in
the two areas of the site in both the fine wares
and the character of the utility wares used and
discarded there, other differences are readily
detected in the two assemblages. Plain wares
and plain sherds are more abundant in the
northern area, both in terms of the overall
proportion of plain sherds in each of the
assemblages as well as in comparisons of the
ratio of plain to decorated rim sherds (Table 6­
4). There are simply more plain ware vessels
in the northern site area than there are in the
southern site area, particularly as measured by
the relative proportion of plain rims to
decorated rims. The differences in the P/DR
ratios between the two areas (1.28 versus 1.99,
see Table 6-4) also corroborate the increased
importance of the manufacture, use, and
discard of plain ware vessels in the northern
part of the site.
From these general comparisons of the
compositional differences of the ceramic
assemblages from the southern and northern
areas of the Lang Pasture site, I turn to a
consideration of the decorative elements
present in the utility wares and fine wares
from both areas. As will become apparent,
while there are significant differences in the
proportions of certain kinds of utility wares
and fine wares within the boundaries of the
site area investigated during the data recovery
excavations, generally speaking, the wares in
both areas share many similar decorative
elements and motifs, and in a number of cases,
these elements and motifs occur in roughly
similar proportions. This suggests that they are
part of the same ceramic tradition, and that
they are not separated much in time.

Age of the Ceramic Components at the
Lang Pasture Site
Our evaluation of the age of the ceramic
component s at the Lang Pasture site is based
on several criteria: (a) the age range of
calibrated radiocarbon dates from various
contexts; (b) the thermoluminescence (TL)
dates obtained on a sample of fine ware and
utility ware sherds from both site areas (see
James Feathers, Appendix D, this volume),
and (c) the general understanding of the age
ranges of selected kinds and relative
proportions of decorated sherds (especially
brushed pottery and varieties of Poynor
Engraved) and defined pottery types—as well
as the L-shaped elbow pipes—found at Lang
Pasture and other prehistoric Caddo ceramic
assemblages in the upper Neches River basin.
The radiocarbon dating from the Lang Pasture
site suggests that the principal occupation of
the site took place (at 2 sigma, calibrated, with
a 95% probability) sometime between AD
1260-1470. An examination of the results of
the calibrated radiocarbon dates on maize
from nine different contexts in this component
narrows the likely period of the principal
domestic occupation of the site by the Caddo
to an 80 year interval between ca. AD 1320­
1400, prior to the estimated beginning of the
Frankston phase. The mean calibrated age
range of the nine aforementioned 1 sigma
maize dates from the Lang Pasture site is AD
1335-1386. The mean calibrated age range of
the 2 sigma maize dates is AD 1323-1404; the
mean calibrated intercept age for the maize
dates is AD 1358. In summary, then, the
calibrated radiocarbon dates indicate that the
principal domestic occupation at the Lang
Pasture site was by Caddo peoples from the
first quarter of the 14th century A.D. to the first
few years of the 15th century A.D.

Given the mean calibrated age range (at 2
sigma) of AD 1323-1404 for the principal
domestic occupation at the Lang Pasture site,
and the AD 1290-1420 and AD 1310-1440 age
ranges for two of the burial features at the site
(Features 76C and 93), it appears that the
majority, if not all, of the burials at the site
were interred by Caddo peoples during the
course of the settlement there. Burial 8, with a
2 sigma calibrated age range of AD 1410­
1470, may have been interred shortly after the
domestic occupation at the Lang Pasture site
ended, or at least had ended in the portion of
the
domestic
farmstead
compound
investigated in the TxDOT right-of-way.
Based on the proportions of decorated sherds
from a midden deposit on private property, the
Lang Pasture site as a whole likely continued
to be occupied for some years after the first
quarter of the 15th century A.D. (see Perttula et
al. 2007).
The TL or luminescence dating of ceramics
(see Feathers 1997, 2000, 2003) has been
applied with some considerable success in a
variety of settings—and on different ceramic
wares—in North America (Lipo et al. 2005;
Dykeman et al. 2002), but since the days of
Alpha Analytic (a subsidiary of Beta Analytic)
in the early to mid-1980s, there have been no
TL dating of Caddo ceramic wares in East
Texas. Given the abundance of ceramics of
several different kinds and styles at the Lang

Technical Report No. 174202

Pasture site, the TL dating of decorated sherds
recovered in situ at the site was also explored
since it is a method “that dates the
manufacture and use of…ceramic objects
[that] provide a closer relationship between
the target event [when a site is occupied] and
the dated event [the age determined by the
luminescence on a sherd]. Luminescence is
particularly well suited for the dating of
ceramics since the method measures the time
elapsed since vessels were last heated, usually
corresponding to manufacture or use” (Lipo et
al. 2005:535).
The results of the TL or luminescence dating
of 21 decorated sherds (five fine ware sherds
and 16 utility ware sherds)1 are presented in
Appendix C, Table C-6, by James K. Feathers,
along with a discussion of the method and
procedures followed in obtaining these dates.
Due to the vagaries of sampling during the
excavations, the requirement by TxDOT that
both utility wares and fine wares be sampled
in the proportions documented at the Lang
Pasture site (see discussion in Chapter 4, this
volume), and the necessity that sherds to be
submitted for TL dating should be at least 3
cm in diameter and 5 mm in thickness
(Dykeman et al. 2002:164), 17 of the sherds
submitted for TL dating are from the southern
ceramic component/area (N170-188), and the
other four are from the northern ceramic
component/area (N189-209); it is unfortunate

157

Chapter 6: Ceramic Artifacts from the Lang Pasture Site (41AN38) and the Place of the Site Within an Upper
Neches River Basin Caddo Ceramic Tradtion

that additional TL samples were not obtained
from the northern area, as it has proven
difficult to assess the accuracy of the few TL
dates from this part of the site.

luminescence dates is needed to
generate the temporal distribution of
each assemblage (Lipo et al.
2005:538).

In the discussion of these 21 TL dates, I
exclude four dates (UW1700, UW1703,
UW1713, and UW 1719) from further
consideration because of their excessively
high percentage error (13.4-22.1%). This
leaves three TL dates from the northern site
area and 14 from the southern ceramic
component/area. Percentage errors are
calculated by “dividing the one sigma error
range by the midpoint age of the range” (Lipo
et al. 2005:536). Percentage errors of 10% or
less are optimal (Feathers 1997:51; Dykeman
et al. 2002:154), and in the case of the Lang
Pasture site, the percentage errors for the
remaining 17 TL dates ranges from 3.8-11.4%.
Table 6-5 lists these 17 TL dates.

That being said, and factoring in the
significant age ranges from both areas, it
seems unlikely that the three TL dates from
the northern site area do constitute a
reasonable sample with which to estimate the
age of the ceramics from this part of the Lang
Pasture site. As discussed below, however, the
14 TL samples from the southern site area
appear tp comprise an adequate TL
assemblage for evaluating the temporal
distribution of the decorated ceramics.

It is apparent from an inspection of Table 6-5
that the TL dates from both ceramic
component/areas have a very wide temporal
range at 1 sigma, even though the range of TL
dates overlap at this sigma: A.D. 1098-1541
from the northern area and A.D. 964-1604
from the southern area. However, given that
the “date” of a ceramic assemblage
consists of the sum of deposition
events that resulted in the aggregation
of sherds into the assemblage.
Assemblages, like individual objects,
have a temporal range as well as a
mean date that is determined by the
rate
of
individual
object
deposition…The luminescence dating
of a single sherd in a ceramic
assemblage, therefore, will not
necessarily produce an accurate
estimate for the assemblage deposition
event any more than a single 14C
date. Consequently, a large number of

158

Averaging the three TL dates from the
northern site area produces a mean TL date of
A.D. 1299 + 45 (A.D. 1254-1344). The mean
TL date from the southern site area is A.D.
1377 + 46 (A.D. 1331-1423). Both mean TL
age ranges overlap with the calibrated
radiocarbon dates. Furthermore, the mean
dates from both areas overlap between A.D.
1331-1344, which also falls within the
estimated age range of the principal Caddo
component (A.D. 1320-1400) as determined
from the analysis of calibrated radiocarbon
dates (coming mainly from the northern site
area) from the Lang Pasture site. These mean
TL dates also indicate that the ceramics from
the northern ceramic component/area are
older than those from the southern ceramic
component/area, but not significantly older.
What about the TL ages of the different
ceramic wares from the Lang Pasture site?
Perhaps they can provide insights into
establishing the overall age of the
assemblages, as“one kind of sherd may often
serve as a proxy for the set, and by dating that
kind of sherd one is in effect dating the set”
(Lipo et al. 2005:539).

The dated incised utility wares from both site
areas (see Table 6-5) have a mean TL date of
A.D. 1224 + 53. This is unreasonably early
given the overall character of the TL dates
from the two ceramic components, unless the
incised wares as a group are part of an
unrecognized ceramic assemblage, which is
unlikely given the kinds and numbers of
decorated incised sherds in both assemblages
(see below). The mean TL dates for the
engraved sherds from the southern area (the
one Poynor Engraved sherd from the northern
site area has an improbable TL date of A.D.
1145) is A.D. 1419 + 34 (see Table 6-5). The
brushed sherds from the southern area have a
mean TL date of A.D. 1440 + 47; the one TL
date from the northern area is A.D. 1519 + 22.
The one punctated sherd from the southern
area has a TL date of A.D. 1474 + 37.

Technical Report No. 174202

There is good concordance, then, in the single
and mean TL dates from the brushed,
engraved, and punctated sherds from the
southern part of the Lang Pasture site, as they
overlap at 1 sigma. Combining these three
classes of pottery as a means to estimate the
temporal distribution of the ceramics from this
area, at least, the mean TL date is A.D. 1444 +
39 (A.D. 1405-1483). This suggests that the
southern ceramic component/area at the Lang
Pasture site dates to the early or sub-phase 1 of
the Frankston phase, and probably postdates
the Caddo occupation in the northern part of
the site (if relying on the calibrated
radiocarbon dates) by as little as a generation
(or even overlapping by a few years) to as
much as 4-5 generations, depending upon the
beginning and ending points of either the
radiocarbon or TL dates.

159

Chapter 6: Ceramic Artifacts from the Lang Pasture Site (41AN38) and the Place of the Site Within an Upper
Neches River Basin Caddo Ceramic Tradtion

There are a few radiocarbon dates from other
upper Neches River basin sites that put these
temporal estimates from the Lang Pasture site
in context, including dates recently obtained
on Caddo burials at the Emma Owens
(41AN21), Fred McKee (41AN32), Pierce
Freeman (41AN34), and A. H. Reagor
(41CE15) sites (see Chapter 5, this volume); a
stratified series of dates from a midden deposit
at the ALCOA #1 site (41AN87, see Perttula
2009); and dates on maize from 41HE139 and
41HE343 near Lake Palestine (Cliff et al.
2004). Based on the recovered ceramics, these
sites date to either Frankston (ca. A.D. 1400­
1650) or Allen phase (ca. A.D. 1650-1800)
times (cf. Kleinschmidt 1982; Perttula 2007b).
The Emma Owens site calibrated radiocarbon
age range is the youngest of the assays in this
group of upper Neches River basin sites: it has
a calibrated intercept of AD 1640, and a 2
sigma age range of AD 1470-1660. This burial
was interred in the middle of the 17th century,
near or at the estimated beginning of the Allen
phase; the ceramics and pipes from the site
indicate it does date to the post-A.D. 1650
Allen phase (see Cole 1975). The mean age
range at 1 sigma for the calibrated radiocarbon
dates from the Frankston 3 (or late Frankston
phase) sub-phase burials at the Fred McKee,
Pierce Freeman, and A. H. Reagor sites is AD
1500-1598 and the mean age range is AD
1470-1620 at 2 sigma; the mean calibrated
intercept is AD 1560. These calibrated dates
do overlap with the estimated age of Frankston
3 sub-phase components (ca. A.D. 1570-1650)
in the upper Neches River basin, and
moreover, these mean calibrated dates and
intercepts indicate that the burials from the
Fred McKee, Pierce Freeman, and A. H.
Reagor sites are approximately 40 to 80 years
older than the Emma Owens Allen phase
burial.
Calibrated dates from the ALCOA #1 midden
date to the 15th century (Perttula 2009), and
have intercepts from samples at the bottom to
top in the deposit that range from AD 1407,
AD 1426, and AD 1470. This is perhaps
currently the best dated Frankston phase
domestic habitation component in the upper

160

Neches River basin: the ceramics found here
include several varieties of Poynor Engraved
and large numbers of brushed utility wares
(70% of the decorated sherds in a sample of
more than 400 decorated sherds) (Perttula
2009). Two sigma calibrated age ranges from
Frankston phase components at 41HE139 and
41HE343 are A.D. 1320-1480 from the former
(and a ceramic assemblage with 17.5%
brushed sherds among the decorated wares,
comparable
to
the
northern
ceramic/component area at the Lang Pasture
site; Cliff et al. 2004), and AD 1440-1640 for
the latter site. The last piece of the
chronological puzzle is the L-shaped elbow
pipes from two of the burial features at the
Lang Pasture site. This distinctive form of
elbow pipe appears to be the earliest of the
elbow pipe forms in East Texas, including the
upper Neches River basin (see below). Rogers
and Perttula (2004) documented this form of
elbow pipe from Late Village contexts at the
Oak Hill Village site (41RK214), estimated to
date from ca. A.D. 1350-1450, when later
decorated elbow pipe forms began to be
manufactured in the upper Neches.
In summary, taking all these disparate dates
together, we can speak with confidence that
Frankston phase sites—and thus the associated
Frankston phase ceramics, dominated by
Poynor Engraved and much brushed pottery—
date after ca. A.D. 1400. Furthermore, the
considerable amounts of brushed utility wares
from the southern ceramic component/area,
the occurrence of several varieties of Poynor
Engraved (see below), and the mean TL dates
on engraved, brushed, and punctated ceramics
that range from AD 1405-1483, indicate that
the southern ceramic component/area dates to
the early part of the Frankston phase, namely
sub-phase 1 (cf. Kleinschmidt 1982). The Lshaped elbow pipes as well as the lower
frequency of brushed wares in the northern
ceramic component/area—as with the
ceramics from the White Mule site (41HE166)
at Lake Palestine (18.5%, see Anderson et al.
1974) and 41HE139—but many of the same
kinds of engraved fine wares and engraved
fine ware decorative elements between the
southern and northern areas, are consistent

Technical Report No. 174202

Archeological Investigations at the Lang Pasture Site (41AN38) in the Upper Neches River Basin of East Texas
Texas Department of Transportation

with a Caddo occupation that predates ca.
A.D. 1400, but not by many years. The
calibrated radiocarbon dates from features in
the northern area suggest that this Caddo
occupation may only be a few generations
older in time, and may even have slightly
overlapped in time with the occupation in the
southern
ceramic
component/area.
Nevertheless, I suggest that the Caddo
occupation at the Lang Pasture site, or at least
that part in the TxDOT right-of-way, began in
the early-mid-14th century in the northern part
of the site, and ended by the last quarter of the
15th century in the southern part of the site.
Decorated Utility Wares
There are over 2000 utility ware pottery sherds
from the southern and northern ceramic
component/areas at the Lang Pasture site,

including 215 rims (Table 6-6). On the basis
solely of the rims, which provide a broader
view of the range in decorative styles used on
utility wares,2 vessels with incised decorative
elements are the most common form of utility
ware in both areas, comprising 55% of the
rims in the northern area and 38.7% of the
southern area utility ware rims. In both areas,
incised rims account for between 22-24% of
all the incised sherds, suggesting vessels were
probably decorated in a similar fashion on rim
and body in both ceramic components/areas.
Decorated vessels with tool punctated,
incised-punctated, and brushed rims—in that
order—are also common in the northern area,
accounting for 17.9%, 15%, and 7.1%,
respectively of the rims. Between 14-20% of
the tool punctated and incised-punctated
sherds in the northern area are rims, compared
to only 4% of the brushed sherds.

southern area and 40% in the northern area)
(Figure 6-4a), but horizontal, diagonal, and
overlapping (only in the northern area)
brushed rims are also present in both areas in
similar relative proportions.

In the southern area, jars with brushed rims are
particularly abundant (25.3%), even though
only 3% of the brushed sherds are rims, which
is one of the distinctive features of the
southern area ceramic assemblage. This is
followed by vessels with tool punctated
(14.7%), brushed-punctated (6.7%), and
incised-punctated (5.3%) rim decorations (see
Table 6-6). In these categories of decorative
method, between 11-28% of all of the sherds
are rims. The proportions of rims among these
particular utility wares are not much different
between the northern and southern areas (11­
20%), except for the brushed-punctated
sherds. In this decorative method, only 4% of
the brushed-punctated sherds in the northern
area are rims, compared to 28% of these
sherds from the southern area.

Occasionally, the bodies of brushed jars have
opposed (see Figure 6-4e) or overlapping
brushed marks (see Figure 6-3b) instead of
vertical/parallel brushing (see Table 6-7).
These together comprise 11.4% of the brushed
sherds in the southern area and only a very
slightly higher 13.6% of the northern area
brushed sherds.
Overall, brushed vessels in both areas of the
Lang Pasture site were decorated in a similar
manner on both the rim and vessel body. The
only significant difference in the brushed
sherds from the southern and northern areas is
the absolute proportions of brushed sherds in
the utility wares: 26.2% in the northern area
and 64.1% in the southern area. Clearly, the
period after ca. A.D. 1320-1400 and in much
of the 15th century A.D. is one where Caddo
potters in the upper Neches River basin began
to manufacture considerable numbers of
brushed jars and jars with brushed vessel
bodies.

Brushed
The brushed sherds from the Lang Pasture site
are dominated by body sherds with parallel
brushing marks (Table 6-7 and Figure 6-3a, c);
although the orientation of these sherds is
unknown, it is likely that the brushing was
oriented vertically on the body of cooking and
storage jars. Rims in both areas tend to have
vertical brushing on them (58% in the

fingernail punctated elements are particularly
common in the northern area; the only sherd
with large circular punctations is also from
this area.

Brushed-Punctated
Brushed-punctated decorations on utility ware
sherds are rare at the Lang Pasture site in both
areas (Table 6-8), accounting for only 1.8% of
the utility wares in the southern area and 2.6%
of the northern area utility wares (see Table 6­
6). These are likely from Bullard

Other
differences
between
the
two
assemblages in the kinds of brushed-punctated
decorations can be discerned. First, vertical
brushed sherds with tool punctates either
through the brushing or above the brushing
(i.e., a row of punctates at the rim-body
juncture) are more abundant in the southern
area, as are sherds with overlapping brushed
marks and tool punctates pushed through the
brushing (see Table 6-8).

Brushed jars (see Suhm and Jelks 1962:21 and
Plate 11a-c, e-f). By far the most common
decorative elements are body sherds with
parallel brushing marks and at least one row of
tool or fingernail punctates pushed through the
brushing marks (Figure 6-5f). Brushed and

Archeological Investigations at the Lang Pasture Site (41AN38) in the Upper Neches River Basin of East Texas
Texas Department of Transportation

Horizontal brushed sherds with tool punctated
elements are much more common in the
southern area (27.8%) than they are in the
northern area (3.8%). Punctates on these
sherds tend to be in rows under the lip, along
the mid-point of the rim, and then at the rimbody juncture (see also Figure 6-7a, below),
but most commonly pushed through the
brushing.

The
parallel
brushed-parallel
incised
decorative element on vessel bodies is most
common at Lang Pasture in both site areas
(see Table 6-9). Diagonal, overlapping, and
vertical brushed-incised decorative elements
on rims/body sherds are more abundant in the
southern area (14.3%) than they are in the
northern area (6.3%).
Brushed-Incised-Punctated

Brushed-Incised
Brushed-incised sherds represent another rare
form of decoration on the Lang Pasture site
utility wares (Table 6-9). These sherds account
for 2.7% of the southern area utility wares and
1.6% of the northern area utility wares (see
Table 6-6). Both Maydelle Incised and Bullard
Brushed vessels have brushed and/or incised
bodies, particularly Maydelle Incised jars (see
Suhm and Jelks 1962:103 and Plate 52a, f-g).

Both of the brushed-incised-punctated sherds
are from the northern area at the Lang Pasture
site. They have parallel brushing marks
adjoining a straight incised zone filled with
tool punctates. These sherds are likely from
Maydelle Incised jars that have vertical
brushing on the body and incised triangles or
opposed diagonal lines with tool punctations
filling the triangles or areas between the
incised lines (cf. Suhm and Jelks 1962:103
and Plate 52e-f).

Brushed-Appliqued
Two body sherds from different vessels from
the southern area have brushed-appliqued
decorations. These consist of sherds with
parallel (probably vertical or horizontal) and
parallel-opposed brushing marks framing
either an appliqued fillet (see Figure 6-5e) or
an appliqued ridge. These appliqued
fillets/ridges likely ran vertically on the vessel
body, creating a series of panels filled with
brushing.
Incised-Punctated
A number of utility ware vessels from the
Lang Pasture site have incised-punctated
decorative elements (Table 6-10). The
majority of the incised-punctated decorative
elements have straight or geometric incised
lines framing punctated zones or rows of
punctates (Figure 6-6a-b, see also Figure 6­
5e), particularly notable being the creation of
sets of incised triangles filled with tool,
fingernail, or cane punctations (Figures 6-7c, h
and 6-8a, j).
Tool punctated elements were
primarily used in the incised-punctated

166

designs in the utility wares in both areas,
accounting for 89.2% of the incised-punctated
sherds in the southern area and 92.7% of the
northern area incised-punctated sherds (see
Table 6-10). Cane punctated elements were
decidedly secondary (5.4-10.8% by area), and
only 1.9% of the incised-punctated sherds
from the northern area have fingernail
punctates.
Focusing on the incised-punctated rims, all
four from the southern area have incised
triangles filled with either tool (see Figure 6­
7h) or cane punctates (see Table 6-10).
However, only 62% of the northern area
incised-punctated rims (see Figure 6-8a) have
this distinctive Maydelle Incised rim
decoration. Body and rim sherds with incised
triangular elements filled with punctations
comprise between 27-33.9% in the two areas,
being more common in the northern area (see
Figures 6-7c and 6-8j).
Other rims from the northern area have
curvilinear incised zones filled with tool
punctates (19%) or incised semi-circles filled

Technical Report No. 174202

Archeological Investigations at the Lang Pasture Site (41AN38) in the Upper Neches River Basin of East Texas

parallel/straight incised lines framing rows or
zones of punctations. Incised panels filled with
punctations represent 2.7-12.2% of the
incised-punctated sherds, being particularly
abundant in the northern area (see Figure 6­
8e). Finally, between 1.9-8.1% of the incised­
punctated sherds (more from the southern
area) from the Lang Pasture site have incised
decorative elements situated above a row or
zone of tool punctations; the tool punctated
rows were likely situated at the rim-body
juncture, with either opposed or diagonal
incised lines on the rim of utility ware vessels.

with tool punctates (19%) (see Figure 6-8b, i).
In general, circular, curvilinear, or semi­
circular incised elements filled with punctates
are slightly more popular in the northern area
(15.1%) than they are in the southern area
(10.8%) (see Figure 6-7e).
Additional decorative elements identified in
the incised-punctated sherds include those rim
and body sherds with horizontal incised lines
framing tool punctated rows or zones (1.8­
5.4% of the incised-punctated sherds, being
most common in the northern area) (see Table
6-10).

Tool Punctated
Tool punctations were regularly employed as
part of several different decorative elements in
the Lang Pasture utility wares (Table 6-11),
particularly in the northern site where
punctated sherds amount to 18.8% of all the
utility wares (see Table 6-6). Most of these
consist of rows of tool punctations of various
sizes and shapes, either placed in a single row
under the lip (see Figure 6-5b), at various
places in several rows on the rim (Figure 6-9c
and Figure 6-10a), as well as apparently
sometimes covering much of the vessel body
(Figure 6-10b-d).

170

Suhm and Jelks (1962:157 and Plate 79) note
the considerable diversity in the decoration of
utility wares in East Texas Caddo sites,
although punctated utility ware in the upper
Neches River basin has only the most basic
decorative elements (Suhm and Jelks
1962:Plate 79a-b).
In the two site areas at the Lang Pasture site,
there are few differences in tool punctated
decorative elements, as between 73.1%
(northern area) and 82.6% (southern area) of
the punctated sherds have at least one row, and
sometimes many rows, of tool punctates on
the rim

5b) or on the lip itself are restricted to the
southern area. Vertical rows of punctates are
restricted to rims from the northern area,
while diagonal and linear punctated elements
occur in comparable frequencies (4.4%
versus 5.6%) in both site areas (see Table 6­
11) (see Figure 6-9c).

Tool-Fingernail Punctated

Tool-Punctated-Pinched

The cane punctated sherds from both areas
are from vessels covered with rows of cane
punctations, with the rows not necessarily
confined to the rim. In the southern area, the
one cane punctated rim is from a jar with rim
peaks.

One body sherd from a Killough Pinched jar
in the northern area has tool punctated rows
divided by at least one vertical pinched row.
The pinching and punctated elements probably
covered the entire vessel surface.

172

One body sherd from the northern area is from
a vessel decorated with both tool and
fingernail punctations. In this case, the tool
punctations were placed in a single row along
the rim-body juncture of a cooking jar, while
the body of the vessel was covered with rows
of fingernail punctations.

Fingernail Punctated
Given the virtual absence of rims with
fingernail punctations (see Table 6-11), it is
likely that fingernail punctated decorative
elements were most often placed on the body
of utility ware vessels (see Figure 6-10b, d),
rather than on the rim and body as with tool
punctated decorative elements. Fingernail
punctated sherds are more abundant in the

northern site area utility wares (6.5%) than
they are in the later southern area (1.8%) (see
Table 6-6).
In most cases from both site, fingernail
punctates were placed in straight rows across
the exterior surface of utility ware vessels
(Figure 6-11b).

Figure 6-12d), sets of horizontal lines (2.8­
3.1%), and vertical lines and panels (2.1­
3.8%) (see Table 6-12 and Figure 6-7d).

The vast majority of the incised sherds from
both areas at the Lang Pasture site have
straight line and/or geometric decorative
elements (Table 6-12), with little stylistic
difference among the incised utility wares
between them. Other than single straight or
parallel incised lines, the most frequent incised
decorative elements include sets of opposed
incised lines (Figure 6-12b; see also Figure 6­

Incised utility ware sherds with either
curvilinear or circular decorative elements
comprise only 1.8-2.8% of this class of pottery
in the Lang Pasture ceramic assemblage (see
Table 6-12). The most notable incised pottery
from the site are a few sherds from both site
areas (1.2% in the northern area and 3.1% in
the southern area) that have Poynor Engraved
hatched triangle decorative elements (see

There is one example from the southern area
where the decorative element is opposed rows
of fingernail punctates (see Table 6-11).
Randomly

punctated decorative elements are found only
on punctated utility wares from the northern

below) that were executed with incised lines
(see Figure 6-7f and Figure 6-8g). One rim
from the northern area has a horizontal incised
line under the lip and a panel filled with cross­
hatched incised lines (see Figures 6-6c and 6­
8c).
Appliquéd
Sherds from vessels with appliquéd elements
are rare in both the southern and northern
ceramic component/areas. In the southern
area, four body sherds document the use of
appliqued ridges (n=3) or straight appliqued
fillets (n=1) as panel dividers on jars. Two of
the three appliqued sherds in the northern area
also have ridges, not fillets, and a third sherd
is a rim from a jar with small nodes at the lip.

perhaps from Killough Pinched jars with
pedestal bases (see Suhm and Jelks 1962:Plate
46a-c).
Neck Banded
The few neck banded sherds are from La Rue
Neck Banded vessels (see Suhm and Jelks
1962:93 and Plate 47). These have horizontal
rows on the rim of crimped coils. In the
southern area, one of the neck banded rims has
a row of tool punctations under the lip and
above the first coil, while another has been
lightly brushed between the crimped coils.
One of the two neck banded rims from the
northern area has a row of tool punctates
pushed through one of the crimped coils.
Decorated Fine Wares

Incised-Appliquéd
A single body sherd (or a sherd from the lower
part of the rim) from the northern area has an
opposed line incised element on one side of an
appliquéd node or short appliqued ridge. This
particular sherd is likely from an undefined
variety of Maydelle Incised, where two or four
appliqued node or ridge elements were added
to the rim to separate panels of opposed
incised lines.
Pinched
These pinched rim and body sherds are from
Killough Pinched jars (Suhm and Jelks
1962:91 and Plate 46). Most of the pinched
sherds have rows of pinching, probably
vertically oriented, although horizontal
pinched vessels are known (see Suhm and
Jelks 1962:Plate 46g). Two of the pinched
sherds from the northern area have circular or
curvilinear pinched rows, probably part of
concentric pinched circle decorative elements,

Technical Report No. 174202

Fine ware sherds from the southern and
northern ceramic component/areas total 566
sherds, including 100 rims (Table 6-13). The
rims are from carinated bowls and bowls that
are decorated almost exclusively along a rim
panel, or in the case of the lip notched rims, on
the lip itself. All of the fine ware rims from
the southern area are engraved, with the
northern area fine wares having rims from
vessels with engraved-punctated, engraved-lip
notched, lip notched, and red-slipped
decorations. Engraved-brushed sherds from
carinated bowls—with an engraved decoration
on the rim panel and brushing on the vessel
body—are restricted to the southern area fine
wares, while the fine wares with lip notching
are found only in the northern site area (see
Table 6-13). Engraved bottle sherds are more
than twice as common in the northern area
fine wares by comparison with the decorated
fine wares from the southern part of the site.

Engraved Sherds
The engraved fine wares from bowls and
carinated bowls from the Lang Pasture site
include 94 rim sherds and 300 body sherds
(see Table 6-13). The fine wares have the most
diverse range of decorative elements, with
geometric designs, the use of panels and
zones, hatched triangular and circular
elements, opposed lines, curvilinear lines, and
ovals—as well as combinations of various
elements (Table 6-14)—found primarily on
the rim panel of bowls and carinated bowls; in
this case, body sherds simply represent the
lowermost part of a rim panel, with the lip
missing (Figure 6-13b, d-h, j-t and Figure 6­
14a-k, o-s, u-v). A number of these decorative
elements feature the use of red or white clay
pigments (see discussion below) that had been
rubbed in the engraved lines, or in one

Technical Report No. 174202

instance also smeared across the vessel
surface.
The northern area engraved carinated bowl
and bowl sherds have six principal sets of
decorative elements (Table 6-14). These are
(1) sets of parallel lines, either closely or
widely-spaced, (2) sets of opposed lines (see
Figure 6-14f), (3) sets of curvilinear lines, (4)
panels that run in various directions that are
filled with straight engraved lines (see Figures
6-3d, 6-4d, and 6-9b; see also Figure 6-16c) as
well as hatched (see Figure 6-14g, i-j, r) and
cross-hatched lines (see Figure 6-14s, u), (5)
horizontal lines and hatched triangles (Figure
6-15a-c, see also Figure 6-14b-c, v), and (6)
hatched elements, principally triangles (see
Figure 6-9d), but also including circles and
ladders.

**one sherd with engraved line on vessel interior surface

The triangles occur in sets, with different size,
and they are presumably pendant from either
horizontal, diagonal, or curvilinear lines on
rim panels.

Horizontal and circular elements (see Figure
6-14k), and engraved circles are also present
in the fine wares, but account for only 1.2% of
the decorated sherds in this part of the site.

The frequency of the horizontal engraved line
element (5.5%) simply is an indication that the
carinated bowls and bowls had panels of
decoration delimited by horizontal lines that
encircled the vessel along the rim. It is
possible that some of these horizontal
engraved sherds are from effigy vessels, but
no effigy heads or tabtails were recovered in
the northern area sherds.

Excluding the parallel and horizontal line
decorative elements—which presumably
framed the rimpanel or are from Hood
Engraved effigy vessels--the engraved fine
wares in the southern area are dominated by
horizontal lines and hatched triangles (see
Figures 6-5c and 6-13e-f, l), and hatched
triangles (see Figure 6-4b). Other important
elements include sets of curvilinear lines,
likely part of oval motifs (Figure 6-13g),
opposed lines, and horizontal lines in
combination with other geometric elements
(i.e., diagonal, vertical, and cross-hatched
lines, see Figure 6-13h, p, r) (see Table 6-14).

Other engraved decorative elements from the
northern area feature broader zones filled with
hatching, cross-hatching (see Figure 6-14p), or
excising, sets of horizontal and curvilinear
lines, also probably part of large ovals or
circular motifs on rim panels, and ovals (see
Figure 6-14d), including small nested ovals
(see Figure 6-14i), and large triangular nested
ovals
(see
Figure
6-14o).

As with the engraved fine wares from the
northern area, other decorative elements in the
fine wares include panels (see Figure 6-13d,
k), zones (see Figure 6-13r), horizontalcircular/semi-circular (see Figure 6-13j),
horizontal-curvilinear,
occasionally
with
appended hatched triangles (see Figure 6-13t),
and ovals. In some cases, the ovals are formed
by the use of other elements, typically hatched
triangles, thus forming negative ovals (see
Figure 6-13b, o) that are part of a larger rim
panel motif. Engraved panels and zones are
more common elements in the northern area
(12.7%) when compared to the southern area
(6.3%), while conversely engraved elements
with circles, semi-circles, horizontal and
curvilinear lines, and ovals are better
represented in the southern area (10.7%) than
they are in the northern area (7.1%).
Decorative elements in these engraved fine
wares that are unique to the southern area are
cross-hatched lines and vertical lines (see
Table 6-14). However, these only represent
1.8% of the engraved carinated bowl and bowl
sherds. The vertical lines likely represent rim
panel dividers on Poynor Engraved, var.

184

Blackburn
vessels.
The
cross-hatched
engraved vessel sherd is from a typologically
unidentified vessel.
In most particulars, these sets of decorative
elements in the engraved fine ware carinated
bowls and bowls from the northern and
southern areas are found on Poynor Engraved
vessels in the upper Neches River basin (see
Suhm and Jelks 1962:Plate 62a-j), many with
hatched triangles of various sizes appended to
larger motifs on rim panels. In many cases, the
engraved lines are relatively fine and narrow,
but “poorly executed, with little contrast
between surface colors and the cores exposed
by engraving” (Suhm and Jelks 1962:123).
The decorations on these engraved vessels
feature—either in a singular fashion or in
combination—triangular, oval, or circular
motifs on rim panels filled in with closely to
widely-spaced hatching or cross-hatched lines,
usually with appended hatched triangles. The
engraved sherds with oval elements on the rim
are most likely from Poynor Engraved, var.
Cook vessels (see below), and those with
geometric lines and geometric lines with
appended hatched triangles are from Poynor

Technical Report No. 174202

Archeological Investigations at the Lang Pasture Site (41AN38) in the Upper Neches River Basin of East Texas
Texas Department of Transportation

Engraved, var. Blackburn vessels, or any
number of unspecified varieties of Poynor
Engraved, of which I have identified 22 from
the study of whole vessels in the region (see
below) and a further five local varieties at the
Lang Pasture site (see below).
Larger hatched triangle elements below the lip
on one sherd from the southern area indicate it
is probably from a Hume Engraved bowl (see
Suhm and Jelks 1962:83). The size and
hatching on these triangles is comparable to
the hatched triangles noted on cylindrical
Hume Engraved bottles (see Suhm and Jelks
1962:Plate 42b-c) rather than to the larger and
repeatedly hatched triangular elements on
carinated bowls and bowls in the assemblage.
Eight sherds from the northern (n=3, 1.3%)
and southern (n=5, 3.2%) areas have straight,
parallel, curvilinear, or opposed engraved lines
with small triangular tick marks (see Figure 6­
13m, s and Figure 6-14q). These are from
several different varieties of Patton Engraved
(see below; see also Suhm and Jelks
1962:Plate 59), including Patton Engraved,
var. Allen and var. Patton. Patton Engraved is
the dominant Allen phase (post-A.D. 1650)
fine ware in the upper Neches River basin, but
is also found in low amounts in ca. A.D. 1560­
1650 Frankston phase sites (see below). As
such, these few sherds, along with Patton
Engraved sherds from the Lang Pasture
midden (see Perttula et al. 2007), constitute
evidence for limited use of this part of the site
well after the end of the principal prehistoric
Caddo occupation in the TxDOT right-of-way
area.

Technical Report No. 174202

Engraved Bottle Sherds
As mentioned above, engraved bottle sherds
are very common in the northern part of the
Lang Pasture site, where they account for 30%
of all the fine wares (see Table 6-6). By
contrast, only 13.8% of the fine ware sherds
from the southern area are from bottles. Red
clay pigments were frequently rubbed in the
engraved lines of the bottles, particularly in
the northern site area.
Although difficult to characterize by style or
motifs, the same range of engraved decorative
elements (although in different proportions by
site area) are found on both the carinated
bowls/bowls and the bottles (Table 6-15, see
Table 6-13). Most likely, many of these bottle
sherds are from globular Poynor Engraved
bottles (see Suhm and Jelks 1962:Plate 63g-j)
rather than the elongated bottle form (see
Suhm and Jelks 1962:Plate 63a-f), as long
vertical decorative motifs as occur on these
elongated forms (as they do on Hume
Engraved bottles) were not clearly identified
in the Lang Pasture bottle sherds. In many
cases, particularly bottle sherds with
curvilinear lines, parallel lines, diagonal lines,
or opposed lines, they cannot be typologically
classified.
On post-ca. A.D. 1300 bottles in the upper
Neches River basin, the decorative elements
and motifs are commonly oriented vertically
to follow the shape of the bottle, except on
globular bottles—where the designs are
oriented horizontally to fit the broader bottle
body—and the designs are in consequence
unconstrained because they did not need to be
confined to a rim panel as is the case with the
engraved carinated bowls and bowls.

*includes at least one sherd with red pigment in the engraved lines

Common engraved elements on the bottles
from the Lang Pasture site include sets of
curvilinear lines, hatched triangles, ovals,
hatched circles, hatched zones, circles and
semi-circles, and opposed lines (Figure 6-16a­
b, see also Figure 6-12c, Figure 6-13c, i, q,
and Figure 6-14l-m). These are also popular
decorative elements on the carinated bowls
and bowls (see Table 6-14).
Engraved bottle sherds from the two site areas
are distinct from one another with respect to
the proportions of different decorative
elements (see Table 6-15), although virtually
each engraved bottle decorative element is
represented in both site areas. That they share
many decorative elements, but in slightly
different proportions, presumably represents
evidence of subtle stylistic changes over time
effected by Caddo potters in how bottles were
to be decorated, as well as engraved bottle
styles preferred by the Lang Pasture

Technical Report No. 174202

community. It is a fact that curvilinear
engraved elements (see Figure 6-13i, q, Figure
6-14m, and Figure 6-16b) are the most
common decorative element among the
engraved bottle sherds in both site areas, but
this particular decorative element is better
represented in the northern, and earlier, area
decorated bottles (see Table 6-14).
In the northern area, in addition to curvilinear
engraved lines as the dominant decorative
element, other important engraved elements
include hatched triangles (see Figure 6-16a)
pendant from other sets of engraved lines, and
sets of opposed engraved lines (see Figure 6­
14l); all three elements are more abundant in
the northern area bottles than they are in the
southern area engraved bottle sherds. These
three categories of engraving comprise 73% of
the decorative elements on the northern area
bottle sherds (see Table 6-14). The one
engraved bottle decoration that appears

187

Chapter 6: Ceramic Artifacts from the Lang Pasture Site (41AN38) and the Place of the Site Within an Upper
Neches River Basin Caddo Ceramic Tradtion

confined to the northern area is circles and
semi-circles, with the exception of one large
circle filled with a checkerboard zone of
hatched squares from the southern area (see
Figure 6-13c).

Two bottle sherds—one from each site area—
have triangular tick marks on either straight or
opposed engraved lines. These are from
Poynor Engraved bottles (see Suhm and Jelks
1962:Plate 63g).

Southern area engraved bottle sherds have
four principal decorative elements: sets of
curvilinear lines (25.9%); hatched zones
(18.5%) or panels (3.7%), zones or panels
being separated depending upon the width and
separation of the engraved area from other
decorative elements on the bottle; triangular
elements, usually hatched (14.8%); and ovals
(11.1%, see Figure 6-13i). Diagonal engraved
lines on bottles (7.4%) are also more common
on the southern area bottles.

Engraved-Brushed
All three of the engraved-brushed sherds are
from the southern area of the Lang Pasture site
(see Table 6-13). All three are from carinated
bowls, with horizontal brushing on the vessel
body and either horizontal (n=2) or horizontaldiagonal (n=1) engraved lines on the rim
panel.

Engraved-Punctated

Engraved-Lip Notched

Engraved-punctated sherds account for 1.0­
2.1% of the engraved fine wares from the
southern and northern parts of the Lang
Pasture site (see Table 6-13). These sherds are
from several varieties of Poynor Engraved
(see Suhm and Jelks 1962:Plate 62g, i) where
punctated zones are seen, including Poynor
Engraved, var. Blackburn, var. Cook, and var.
Lang (see below).

One rim from the northern area has diagonal
engraved lines on the rim panel, and a regular
series of notches along the lip itself. A red
clay pigment has been rubbed in the engraved
decorative element. As will be seen in the
discussion of the whole vessels from a series
of upper Neches River basin Caddo sites, lip
notching was a relatively common lip
embellishment on engraved carinated bowls
(see below).

In the southern area, one engraved-punctated
sherd has a curvilinear zone filled with small
circular punctates (see Figure 6-13a) while the
other has an engraved lines framing a zone
filled with small circular punctates. One sherd
from the northern area has the same decorative
element.
Two other engraved-punctated sherds from the
northern area are from Poynor Engraved
bottles. The first has parallel engraved lines
framing a zone of small triangular-shaped
punctations (see Figure 6-16d), while the
second has an engraved circle filled with tool
punctations.
Other northern area engraved-punctated sherds
are from carinated bowls. The one rim has
horizontal engraved lines, hatched triangular
elements, and a circle filled with small circular
punctates (see Figure 6-14t), while a second
sherd has both the horizontal engraved lines
and hatched triangular elements of the rim, as
well as diagonal engraved lines creating a
panel with a punctate-filled semi-circle (see
Figure 6-14n). Another carinated bowl sherd
has a design comprised of a hatched engraved
panel, and a set of closely-spaced curvilinear
lines within the panel that encircle a small
punctate-filled circle element (see Suhm and
Jelks 1962:Plate 62i). One sherd simply has
engraved panels, one of which is filled with
small circular punctates.
The last engraved-punctated sherd is a rim
from the northern area with opposed diagonal
or triangular elements on the rim. These lines
have triangular tick or punctated marks on
them.

Technical Report No. 174202

Lip Notched
Two rims from the northern site area have
regularly spaced notches cut into the vessel lip
(see Table 6-13 and Figure 6-11c). These may
be from plain bowls or carinated bowls, or
from the upper part of the rim panel of
engraved vessels.
Red-Slipped
The red-slipped sherds from the southern area
are from bottles with an exterior red slip
(n=2), from bowls or carinated bowls with an
interior and exterior red slip (n=2), or are from
bowls (n=2) with only a red slip on the interior
vessel surface. Two red-slipped bottle sherds
are among the red-slipped sherds from the
northern site area, including one that has an
interior red-slip on the upper part of the bottle
neck. Six other sherds, including one rim, are
from carinated bowls with both an interior and
exterior red slip. Four other sherds from this
area, probably from bowls, are slipped on
either the interior (n=3) or exterior (n=1)
vessel surfaces.
Use of Pigments
Both white (Hah ki yo in the Caddo language)
kaolin clay and a red (Hatinu in Caddo)
hematite-rich clay were used as pigments that
were rubbed in the engraved decorations of a
number of fine-ware vessels. Red pigments
were clearly preferred by the Caddo potters at
the Lang Pasture site, particularly as a
decorative embellishment on fine ware bottles
(Table 6-16), but the pigment was also used on

189

Chapter 6: Ceramic Artifacts from the Lang Pasture Site (41AN38) and the Place of the Site Within an Upper
Neches River Basin Caddo Ceramic Tradtion

an occasional bowl or carinated bowl; in the
whole vessels (see below), a red clay pigment
was a common feature on Hood Engraved
effigy bowls. The white kaolin clay pigment
was present on only two engraved sherds from
the southern ceramic component/area. In the
upper Neches River basin, the white clay
pigment was noted primarily on post-A.D.
1650 Patton Engraved vessels (see Campbell
1936).
Pigments were used somewhat more
commonly on the engraved fine wares from
the northern area (10.6% of all the engraved
sherds) at the Lang Pasture site.
Approximately 5.8% of the engraved sherds
from the southern ceramic component/area
have pigments rubbed in the lines of the
design.
According to Bobby Gonzalez of the Caddo
Nation of Oklahoma (April 2008 personal
communication), “the red pigment means life
and is very sacred among the Caddo. The red
pigment is now used on peyote staffs, and
during ritual ceremonies and prayer meetings,
the red pigment is painted on and in the ears as
well as on the top of the head in the middle of
a man’s hair line, running from front to back;

the women and men paint themselves in the
morning when the sun comes up.” Vessels or
vessel sherds found in domestic contexts with
a red pigment likely are from vessels that
symbolize life and its sacredness to the
Caddo.
The Caddo “also use the red pigment when
someone dies. If the deceased is a man we
paint them in the middle hair line and on the
face on each side of the eyes; if the deceased
is a woman, another Caddo woman would
paint her under the eyes.” It is possible that the
red pigment seen on vessels placed in Caddo
burials in the upper Neches River basin may
have been added to the vessels shortly before
they were placed in the grave with the
deceased. “The white clay is also very sacred
to the Caddo and was used for altars during
Caddo peyote meetings. The white clay is
used by the Caddo in doctoring people with
cuts, burns, stomach problems, and other
reasons” (Bobby Gonzalez, April 2008
personal communication). Even today, Caddo
home places in Oklahoma have white and red
clay altars, and some families still use these
colors.

PLAIN SHERDS

Detailed comparisons of the plain sherds from
the Lang Pasture site are based on the analysis
of temper, paste, firing conditions (Teltser
1993; Perttula 2005, ed.), surface treatment,
and body wall thickness for a sample of 385
body sherds and 41 plain rim sherds from the
data recovery work all areas of the site
(Appendix F.2). A total of 4254 plain sherds
have been recovered from the Lang Pasture
site. This includes 442 plain sherds from the
test excavations (see Perttula 2004:Table 3.6),
which are not further considered here and have
not been subjected to any detailed analyses,
and 3,812 plain sherds from the data recovery
(see Table 6-17, on CD in back cover). The
sample of plain sherds selected for detailed
analysis comprises approximately 11.2% of all
the plain sherds in the assemblage recovered
in the data recovery work (n=3812). Plain
sherd
cross-sections
were
inspected
macroscopically and with a 10X hand lens to
determine the character of the paste and its
inclusions. Determining the firing conditions,
temper, vessel wall thickness, and surface
treatment followed the same procedures
discussed above for the decorated rim and
body sherds.
By area, there are 1293 plain sherds from the
southern ceramic component/area, including
only 11 (0.8%) from features. By contrast,
plain vessel sherds from features in the
northern ceramic component area comprise
24.9% of all the plain sherds (n=2,516) from
this part of the site, and 98.3% of the plain

Technical Report No. 174202

sherds from all the features. As previously
mentioned, one of the distinguishing attributes
of the ceramic assemblage from the northern
ceramic component/area in contrast with the
southern ceramic component/area is the
abundance of plain wares. This is apparent in
the fact that 70.9% of all the plain rims from
the Lang Pasture site are from the northern
area.
Plain Rim Sherds
There are a total of 144 plain rims from
undecorated vessels in the Lang Pasture site
ceramic assemblage, including the sherds
submitted for instrumental neutron activation
analysis. Most of them are from the northern
ceramic assemblage, particularly from several
pit features in this part of the site. Rims from
the plain vessels are characterized by the form
of the rim and lip, the temper, firing
conditions, surface treatment, thickness (in
mm), and orifice diameter (in cm), if they had
sufficient curvature (Table 6-18).
Selected plain ware rims are illustrated in
Figure 6-17. The majority of the plain ware
vessels are from simple bowls or carinated
bowls, a few with rim peaks, as well as plain
bottles (or at least plain bottle necks).

Orifice Diameters of Decorated and Plain
Vessel Rim Sherds
In cases where rim curvatures were sufficient,
it was possible to measure the orifice diameter
(OD) of a number of plain and decorated rim
sherds from both the southern (n=31) and
northern (n=71) ceramic components/areas at
the Lang Pasture site. Measured rims ranged in
OD from 5-34 cm (Table 6-19). The orifice
diameters of these vessels, used for cooking,
food service, and the storage of food stuffs and
liquids, provide some indication of the scale of
food preparation and food serving in the two
different areas of the site. That the vessels
from the Lang Pasture site are all hollow
wares (i.e., jars, bowls, and carinated bowls),
it seems likely that the Caddo diet was based
almost entirely on liquid-based foods cooked
in jars, including stews, corn and bean dishes,
and gruels.

Technical Report No. 174202

These measurable rims are readily divisible
into five size groups: very small (probably
bottles), 5-8 cm OD; small, 9-14 cm OD;
medium, 15-20 cm OD; large, 21-26 cm OD;
and very large, 27-34 cm OD. As discussed
below, the vessels used in domestic contexts at
the Lang Pasture site are generally much
larger than those placed in the burials with the
deceased. The mortuary vessels are no larger
than 20 cm in OD (and no larger than 2 liters
in volume), and may have been chosen
because only one to a few servings of food
were necessary on the deceased’s journey to
the House of the Dead (see Chapter 11, this
volume), even though the journey was
supposed to last for six days.
In the southern ceramic component/area, plain
vessels occur only in the small, medium, and
large categories, suggesting that much of the
food service was designed for individual or

197

Chapter 6: Ceramic Artifacts from the Lang Pasture Site (41AN38) and the Place of the Site Within an
Upper Neches River Basin Caddo Ceramic Tradtion

small group servings, and thus likely carried
out within small social groups, presumably
households. All five vessel size groups are
represented in the plain ware rims from the
northern ceramic component/area. Plain wares
in the southern area are predominantly small
to medium-sized (89%), as they are in the
northern area (61%), but large and very large
plain wares account for 25% of the rims in the
northern area but only 11% in the southern
area. It is clear that the full complement of
plain wares used by the Lang Pasture Caddo
groups are found only in the northern ceramic
component/area, and that larger groups or
several households were also meant to be
served. The large and very large plain bowls
could have held between 2-4 liters of food,
probably representing at least 4-8 individual
servings (cf. Voss 2008:246), while the
smaller plain wares may have held only
between 0.5-2 liters of food and thus less than
four individual servings. Such servings could
have included such foods as corn and atole
tamales or beans, corn, and pinole (Chapa
1997:149-150).
In both areas, utility wares used for cooking
and storage have the same range in size, with
small, medium, large, and very large sizes (see
Table 6-19), but medium-sized utility vessels
are more common (43%) in the northern area
than they are in the southern area (25%); small
utility ware vessels, conversely, are more
common in the southern area (50%; compared
to
37%
in
the
northern
ceramic
component/area). Large and very large utility

198

ware vessels (with capacities of greater than 4
liters; the actual quantities of food prepared in
these vessels would be slightly less, as such
vessels would not have been filled to the rim
during use) are equally represented in both
areas (20-25%), but most of the very large
utility ware vessels are found in the northern
site area. In general, the same range in orifice
diameters of the utility wares suggest the same
range by site area in the quantities of food
prepared and food stuffs stored.
The size of these cooking vessels suggest that
they were designed to prepare multiple
servings of food, perhaps as many as 10
individual servings, depending upon the size
of the plain and decorated serving vessels.
Fine ware vessels range from small to very
large in both the southern and northern
ceramic component/areas (see Table 6-19), but
there are significant differences in size group
proportions. Small and medium-sized vessels
(less than 2 liters in volume) comprise 50% of
the measured rims from the southern area, but
89% of the fine wares in the northern ceramic
component/area. In the southern area, 67% of
the very large vessels (ca. 4-6 liters) are fine
wares, compared to 25% in the northern area.
Most of the fine ware serving vessels were
designed for more than 2-4 individual servings
of food, suggesting that they were designed for
use in household contexts, especially in the
northern site area. The large and very large
serving vessel fine wares would have been
used to serve multiple individuals, likely more
than 10 individual servings.

PL=Plain; UW=Utility ware; FW=fine ware;
*includes one Goose Creek Plain, var. unspecified bowl sherd.

Overall, when combined, the size of plain,
utility ware, and fine ware vessels from the
southern and northern ceramic component/
areas is not significantly different (Figure 6-18
and Table 6-20). Caddo potters living in both
areas produced vessels of comparable sizes
and size proportions, even though there were
different preferences (i.e., different food

Technical Report No. 174202

preparation and food serving needs) for
vessels of varying sizes from area to area
among the three wares.
Given the presumption that the northern
ceramic component/area is slightly older than
the southern ceramic component/area, there
are several notable trends in the vessel rim

199

Chapter 6: Ceramic Artifacts from the Lang Pasture Site (41AN38) and the Place of the Site Within an
Upper Neches River Basin Caddo Ceramic Tradtion

orifice diameter data. First, very small to
medium-sized vessels are proportionally more
abundant in the older, northern component,
although small vessels become more
commonly used later in time at the expense of
medium-sized vessels. Very small vessels
(bottles)—all plain wares—are restricted to
the northern area (see Table 6-20). These data
suggest that the Caddo living in the northern
area made pottery designed for use in cooking
and food serving in small social groups,
perhaps individual households, and only
occasionally were foods prepared and served
for larger (i.e., more than 10 individuals)
groups of people. Later in time, larger vessels
used for food service (fine wares), cooking
(utility wares), and storage (utility wares) were
more frequently produced and used at the
Lang Pasture site. In the southern area of the
site, then, the ceramics produced and used by
the Caddo were apparently made with the
presumption that food preparation and serving
needs extended to both household and suprahousehold contexts.
6.7

RIM AND LIP FORMS FOR
DECORATED AND PLAIN
VESSELS

The ceramic vessels made and used at the
Lang Pasture site have a wide variety of rim
and lip forms. Whether by area or by ceramic
ware, direct rims (i.e., rims with a vertical or
straight orientation) are the most common
form, followed by vessels with everted
profiles, with only a few having inverted (i.e.

200

rims with an inward-slanting profile) rims
(Table 6-21). A number of rims are beveled on
the interior surface of the vessel. The lips on
these vessels are most frequently rounded
when viewed in profile, but many also have
flat lips. Other distinctive lip forms include
those where the lip itself has been folded
either towards the exterior of the vessel or
towards its interior, and several others have
tapered, expanded, or scalloped/interior
thickened lip forms. Lastly, six of the 441
analyzed rims (1.4%) have prominent rim
peaks.
The rim and lip form data summarized in
Table 6-21 from both the southern and
northern ceramic component/areas indicate
that the same range of forms were used by
potters in both areas. These were forms that
were obviously considered appropriate to the
kinds of vessels being made and used in each
areas, and comparisons between the two areas
in rim and lip form suggest that there were
differences in rim and lip form preferences,
and thus presumably, differences in the kinds
and proportions of vessels used through time
at the Lang Pasture site.
Plain ware rims are more abundant in the
northern area (36.3%) than in the southern
area (26.3%), utility ware vessels are equally
represented in both areas (45% and 47.3%,
respectively), and fine ware rims are much
more common in the southern area (28.8%)
compared to the northern area (16.4%).

These rim/lip form differences may be
summarized as follows for the form of the rim.
First, plain ware vessels strongly tend to have
direct rims, regardless of the area, but there is
a wider range of rim forms in the plain ware
vessels from the northern site area (Table 6­
22), suggesting a wider range in plain ware
vessel forms in earlier contexts; second, utility
ware vessels have a mix of both direct and
everted rims from jars, and everted rim jars are
more common in the later southern area; and
third, direct rims were preferred on the fine
ware vessels, with inverted rim fine ware
vessels being made and used only in the
southern area.
Overall, everted rim vessels comprise 10­
10.6% of the vessel rims from both areas.
Inverted rim vessels—bowls and certain
carinated bowl forms—only account for 1.4%
of the vessel rims in the northern part of the
site, but 5.6% of the vessel rims in the
southern ceramic component/area.
Lip forms are equally as diverse by area.
Across the wares, flat lips are more prevalent
in the northern area, while rounded lips are
more common in the southern ceramic
component area (see Table 6-22), especially
among the utility wares. Exterior folded lips
occur in comparable amounts (10-10.3%) in
both areas, and are a particularly notable form
of lip treatment on plain wares (both areas)
and utility wares (northern area).
Interior beveled lips are present in both areas,
but were apparently were commonly used on

Technical Report No. 174202

vessels (especially fine wares and plain wares)
in the northern area. Vessels with rim peaks,
although not common in either area, are more
frequent in the southern area (on both utility
ware and fine ware vessels), while being
restricted to two plain ware vessels in the
northern area of the Lang Pasture site (see
Table 6-22).
6.8

USE OF TEMPERS

The Caddo potters that made the pottery
vessels that were used and eventually
discarded at the Lang Pasture site
overwhelmingly preferred to add grog (or
crushed sherds) to the vessel paste (Table 6­
23). It was the principal and sole temper added
to between 53-61.5% of the sherds examined
in detail from the site, regardless of the site
area.
Other important tempers include crushed
hematite/ferruginous sandstone fragments and
crushed and burned animal bone (Table 6-23).
However, these tempers were rarely used by
themselves, but were added to the paste of
vessels that already had grog temper. By ware,
only between 2.5-11% of the sherds from the
southern and northern site areas did not have
grog temper. A few sherds have an abundance
of charred plant remains and charcoal pieces
as aplastics in the paste; these probably
represent pieces of charred materials that were
in the clay when it was collected, and were
never winnowed or cleaned from the clay
when it was being worked, or oxidized during
firing.

Texas Department of Transportation

The high frequency of grog tempering in the
ceramic assemblages, and in each ware,
represents a specific attempt on the part of
Caddo potters to slow the oxidation process of
the ceramic vessels during firing. This would
have created darker-colored vessels in a
reducing firing environment (or lighter tan,
orange, and brown colors in oxidizing
environments), while allowing them to be
fired longer, and producing a harder ceramic
vessel (Rice 1987:354; Teltser 1993:532, 540).
Since grog has expansion coefficients
comparable to the coefficients of the clay
paste most commonly seen in Caddo pottery
vessels—especially with the finely crushed
grog pieces as seen in the fine wares—this
would have contributed further to the ability of
fired vessels to withstand heat-related stresses,
as well as increasing their flexural strength
(Rice 1987:362).

pieces would have aided a vessel’s ability to
withstand thermal shock.

Hematite may have been added to the paste of
certain vessels strictly as a matter of personal
choice by individual Caddo potters, but it may
have served a useful purpose nonetheless. That
is, like feldspar (often also found in
microscopic quantities in the paste of Caddo
vessels, see Perttula 2000), the occurrence of
crushed grains of hematite in the paste would
have enhanced a vessel’s ability to melt and
fuse the paste constituents during firing, thus
resulting in a dense, hard body, and a reduced
vessel porosity (Rice 1987:96). Similarly, the
addition of a coarse temper like hematite

Grog temper was most abundantly used in the
utility wares in both site areas, especially in
the southern site area. Conversely, bone
tempered ceramics are most common in the
plain wares, and least preferred for the
manufacture of fine ware vessels, although the
differences in proportion are slight. Crushed
pieces of hematite are particularly abundant in
the utility wares from the southern area as well
as in the fine wares from the northern site area
(Table 6-24).

Crushed and burned bone may have been
added to a vessel’s paste for the same reason:
namely that crushed and burned bone produces
with little effort an angular particle shape
whose coarseness and size gave vessels
tempered with it the ability to withstand
thermal shock (e.g., Whittlesey 2004:287).
Are there any significant differences in the use
of temper between the two site areas? The
differences, by area and by ceramic ware, are
very subtle (Table 6-24). However, the temper
data strongly supports the notion that the
predominant practice of Caddo potters at the
Lang Pasture site was making grog-tempered
plain ware, utility ware, and fine ware pottery
in both areas and through time.

Finally, vessel sherds with charred organics
are confined almost completely to the plain
wares and fine wares, suggesting these wares
may not have been as well-fired, or fired for a
suitable duration to combust any organics in
the paste, as were the utility wares from the
two site areas.
6.9

PASTE

The majority of the vessel sherds from the
Lang Pasture site have a clayey to silty paste.
Clays used for vessel manufacture were
probably gathered from nearby alluvial
settings, perhaps along Caddo Creek, but
certainly within a short (1-7 km away, at most)
distance from the settlement (Arnold
2000:343; Arthur 2006:52), at least as based
on recent ethnoarcheological research, so that
an inordinate amount of time and energy was
not expended by potters in hauling clay back
to the site. Arthur (2006:52) points out that
potters are likely to select lower quality clays
for vessel manufacture than high quality clays
if the latter are farther away. To date, the
INAA of sherds and clays from East Texas
sites and clay sample locales have been unable
to pinpoint the locations of clays used for
Caddo vessel manufacture.
I assume that the pottery found at the Lang
Pasture site—at least the vessel sherds from
domestic contexts—was very likely to have
been made on site by potters that lived there;
this assumption may well be totally incorrect
if and when additional chemical analyses of
vessel pastes and local clay sources can be
conducted, but available chemical analyses of
vessel sherds only suggests that the sherds
from Lang Pasture (and other sites in the
vicinity) were made from local upper Neches
River basin clays (see Appendix D; see also
Ferguson 2007; Ferguson et al. 2008).
Depending upon the area of the site and the

206

type of ware, about 18.4-33.6% percent of the
vessel sherds examined in detail have a sandy
paste, suggesting that a naturally sandy clay
was occasionally selected by Caddo potters for
use in making particular kinds of vessels.
The highest frequency of sandy paste sherds
are found in the plain wares from the southern
ceramic component/area (Table 6-25), but a
sandy clay was also commonly used among
the fine wares in both areas. Uniformly, sandy
paste clays were not regularly used in the
manufacture of utility ware vessels. Overall,
however, sandy clays were more frequently
selected for vessel manufacture, regardless of
the ware, by Caddo potters whose products
ended up discarded in the southern ceramic
component/area.
Approximately 7.8% of the plain and
decorated sherds analyzed in detail from the
Lang Pasture site (see Appendix F.1 and F.2,
this volume) are identified as coming from
“pinkware” vessels; interestingly, none of the
mortuary vessels from the site are pinkware.
These pinkware are sherds with a distinctive
red (10R 5/8) paste after firing. These vessels
were made with a clay with a moderate to high
iron content (cf. Cordell 2001:17). Although
the source of this clay is not known, I suspect
it derives locally from iron-rich Weches
Formation outcrops in the southwestern part of
Smith County, the northwestern part of
Cherokee County, and northeastern Anderson
County (see Bureau of Economic Geology
1965).
The pinkware sherds are present in roughly
similar amounts in both the southern (n=30
sherds) and northern (n=39 sherds) ends of the
Lang Pasture site. They are particularly
common among the sherds found in the
Feature 76 and Feature 79 fill.

Pinkware vessels and vessel sherds have been
documented in a number of post-A.D. 1400
Caddo ceramic assemblages in the upper
Neches River basin (Figure 6-19), as well as a
few sites downstream in the middle Neches
River basin. In the latter area, this includes a
few sherds from the R. F. Wallace site
(41CE20) and 41CE47 (Shawn Marceaux,
March 2008 personal communication); these
may be from vessels made in the upper Neches
River basin. In the upper Neches River basin
itself, pinkware is present in the sherd
assemblages from the Isibel-Gene Donnell site
(41AN14, 8% of the sherds), the Solon
Stanley site (41CE3, 8.3%), and the J. W.
Blackburn (41CE4, 1.4%) sites (see Figure 6­
19).
A number of pinkware vessels have also been
identified from prehistoric cemeteries in the
upper Neches River basin. Approximately
11.2% of the 277 vessels analyzed in detail
(see below and Appendix F.4) from the Mrs. J.
M. Cook (41AN1), Mr. J. M. Cook (41AN2),
Fred McKee (41AN32), J. W. Blackburn
(41CE4), Omer and Otis Hood (41Ce14), E.
W. Henry (41CE17), and R. J. Fair (41CE25)
sites have the distinctive iron-rich pinkware
paste. This iron-rich clay was used to
manufacture both utility ware (i.e., Bullard
Brushed, Killough Pinched) and fine ware
vessels (Hood Engraved effigy vessels, Hume
Engraved, Poynor Engraved), as well as plain
bottles and carinated bowls.

Technical Report No. 174202

The highest proportion of pinkware vessels
have been documented at the Fred McKee and
J. W. Blackburn sites (Table 6-26), in contexts
dating between ca. A.D. 1480-1650 (Frankston
phase, subphases 2 and 3). These sites—
perhaps closer to the ultimate source of the
iron-rich clay—are 4-20 km east of the Lang
Pasture site (see Figure 6-19).
6.10

FIRING CONDITIONS

The Lang Pasture vessel sherds are from
vessels fired in a variety of different ways
(Table 6-27), presumably reflecting personal
preferences in firing, the desired vessel color,
the kind of clays that were used, and the
functional and technological requirements of
the kinds of vessel forms that were being
manufactured at the site. Vessels were fired in
an open fire, with the vessels either set atop
the fire or nestled in the coals and ash.
Most of the sherds at the Lang Pasture site are
from vessels that were fired in a low oxygen
or reducing environment, this being
particularly the case for all three wares (73.3­
85.9%)
in
the
northern
ceramic
component/area. A particular firing method
was to fire a vessel in a low oxygen
environment, but then pull it from the fire to
cool in the open air (see Table 6-27). This left
either one or both vessel surfaces a lighter
reddish-brown to brown
oxidized color,
probably a preferred color for plain wares and
fine wares, along with occasional vessels that

Technical Report No. 174202

Archeological Investigations at the Lang Pasture Site (41AN38) in the Upper Neches River Basin of East Texas

were fired to a gray, black, or dark grayishbrown color. Reduced fired sherds are much
less common, however, in the sherds from the
southern ceramic component/area, especially
among the utility wares in this area (see Table
6-27). Conversely, sherds from the southern
site area are more likely to be from vessels
fired in an oxidizing or incompletely oxidizing
environments, again most notably among the
utility wares (39.8%), and less so among the
fine wares and plain wares.
In general, there are significant differences in
how utility ware, plain ware, and fine ware
vessels were fired. Fine ware and plain wares

were better made and better fired (at least in
terms of regulating the firing temperature),
and they were probably fired longer in a low
oxygen environment than the utility wares.
The Caddo potters exerted more control over
the end product of fine ware and plain ware
vessel manufacture than they did with the
utility wares, primarily to produce a harder
ceramic. Firing conditions tend to be more
heterogeneous among the utility wares
(including the incompletely oxidized vessel
sherds), likely the product of the multi­
purpose nature of these vessel forms, as they
were used for cooking pots and storage
containers.

*following Teltser (1993) and Perttula (2005, ed.)

As long as the porosity of the utility wares was
not excessive, and there was a good balance
between clay plasticity and temper
constituents, they did not need to be fired for
as long a time as the harder fine wares to be
quite serviceable vessels without being subject
to diminished strength from cumulative
thermal fatigue as well as cracks and fractures.
A number of sherds among the plain wares
and utility wares in both ceramic components
have a distinctive core, with a dark
exterior/light exterior cross-section or lighter
cores than their surfaces (I-L on Table 6-27).
Aten and Bollich (2002:54-55) suggest that
vessels with this kind of firing may have been
placed in a fire with the “orifice [of the vessel]
facing into the fire.” Furthermore, the sherds
with cores lighter than the surfaces may have
come from vessels where “after extended
firing that burned off all organics, the fire may
have been smothered to cause reduction and
darkening
of
the
exterior
surface.”

210

Plain Sandy Paste Ceramic Sherds
A total of 11 plain sherds (10 body and one
rim) from the Lang Pasture site are from
Goose Creek Plain, var. unspecified (see Aten
1983; Story 1990a) vessels (Table 6-28). This
plain and untempered sandy paste ware is
found in East Texas (i.e., south and west of the
Sabine River, but concentrated in the middle
Neches and Angelina river basins, well
downstream and southeast from Lang Pasture)
Woodland period or Mossy Grove Culture
archeological sites that were occupied from ca.
2400-1200 B.P. The recovery of a few sherds
of this ware at Lang Pasture is additional
evidence (beyond dart points, see Chapter 7,
this volume) that the site was occupied to a
limited extent during this period.
Approximately 64% of the Goose Creek Plain,
var. unspecified sherds from the site are from
the northern part of the excavation block (see
Table 6-28). Perhaps the transitory Woodland
period use of the site was concentrated in this
area of the landform.

PIPE SHERDS

Ceramic pipes and pipe sherds are common
artifacts found in upper Neches River basin
Caddo sites, especially those sites occupied
after ca. A.D. 1400 (Gilmore 1974; Jackson
1933, 1936; Kleinschmidt 1982). The Lang
Pasture site is no exception in that ceramic
pipes and pipe sherds are relatively abundant
in both domestic and mortuary archeological
deposits. The abundance of clay pipes in
midden and habitation contexts clearly puts to
rest to the assertion by Schambach et al.
(1982:121) that “normal farmsteads exhibit an
absence of pipes or pipe fragments,” and that
“pipes denote religious ceremonial activity.”
Rather, the prevalence of clay pipes in both
domestic and mortuary contexts throughout
the upper Neches River basin indicate that the
ritual activities associated with pipe
smoking—and the smoking of tobacco (see
Rafferty and Mann 2005; Winter 2000)—were
actually part of daily life and the every-day
ceremonies that the Caddo carried out in
interacting with the spirits and souls around
them. Pipes were probably smoked on a daily
basis by adult members of farmsteads and
communities—mainly adult males, but not
always (see Chapter 11, this volume)—and
when the pipes broke, they were discarded in
nearby middens. Pipes were made locally for
daily use, and for use in mortuary rituals.

Technical Report No. 174202

A total of two whole pipes and 33 pipe sherds
have been recovered from the Lang Pasture
site (Table 6-29). The whole pipes are from
burials, while the sherds are from broken pipes
that were presumably discarded during the
period of habitation. All the pipes and pipe
sherds are from elbow pipes, a style of
ceramic pipe manufacture that began to be
popular after ca. A.D. 1350 in East Texas and
elsewhere in the Caddo area (see Hoffman
1967: Rogers and Perttula 2004), but are
virtually the exclusive form of clay pipe made
by the Caddo from the 15th century A.D. on.
The Feature 8 elbow pipe (Figure 6-20a) is
plain and tempered with finely crushed bone;
the exterior surface retains evidence of
burnishing. The pipe has a L-shaped angle
between the bowl and the stem, which appears
to be the earliest form of elbow pipe in the
upper Neches River basin (see below). The
pipe bowl is 2.8 mm thick; bowl height is 32.8
mm; exterior bowl orifice diameter is 27.2
mm; maximum stem length is 39.9 mm;
exterior stem diameter is 14.2 mm; and the
stem thickness is 3.1 mm.
The Feature 93 elbow pipe (see Figure 6-20b),
although fragmentary, is also L-shaped and
plain. The bowl is complete, and
approximately 50% of the stem remains; the
other half of the stem must have broken off
before being placed in the grave. The pipe was
tempered with finely crushed grog. The

211

Chapter 6: Ceramic Artifacts from the Lang Pasture Site (41AN38) and the Place of the Site Within an
Upper Neches River Basin Caddo Ceramic Tradtion

exterior surface was well smoothed. There is a
thick organic residue inside the bowl.
The bowl on this pipe stands 38.2 mm in
height (slightly larger than the Fea. 8 pipe),
and had an orifice diameter of 26.0 mm at the
rim and 20.0 mm at the juncture with the stem.
The bowl and stem are both 3.8 mm thick. The
stem orifice diameter ranges from 15.1-16.0
mm from the rim to the juncture with the
bowl.

The 33 elbow pipe sherds from the domestic
areas are from at least 10 different pipes,
based on differences in temper, paste,
decoration, and bowl/stem orifice diameter. In
the southern part of the site (N170-188), the
21 pipe sherds include 13 bowl pieces (Figure
6-21d, g), one stem/bowl fragment (Figure 6­
21b), and seven pipe stems (Figure 6-21a, c, e,
f). Four of these had a finely crushed bone
temper (19%), six others had grog temper
(29%), and the others had no obvious temper
inclusions.

One plain pipe bowl rim had the distinctive
pinkware paste previously noted in a number
of the vessel sherds from the site (see above).
Bowl orifice diameters on the pipes ranged
from 3-6 cm. One of the southern area pipes is
a fragment from a plain L-shaped elbow pipe
form. Four bowls and stems from different
pipes have horizontal engraved lines on them
(and one has a white kaolin clay pigment
rubbed in the engraved lines), and one of these
(from Scrape E) also had three horizontal
engraved lines on the basal portion of the bowl
(Figure 6-22b).

and above at least two horizontal engraved
lines (see Figure 6-21f).

These are Variety B elbow pipe forms in the
upper Neches River basin (Figure 6-23).
Another stem rim, from a grog-tempered
elbow pipe, is decorated with punctated and
engraved lines. The design includes a single
row of horizontal punctations below the rim

These northern site elbow pipes are both plain
(probably Var. A L-shaped forms) and
engraved. The engraved pipes include one
stem with horizontal engraved lines on it (a
Var. B form, see Figure 6-23) and a second

There are 12 elbow pipe sherds in the northern
part (N189-209) of the site, including one pipe
stem from Feature 76. These sherds include
four bowl pieces and eight stem sherds. Unlike
the elbow pipes from the southern part of the
site, 67% of these other pipe sherds are grogtempered (compared to 29% from the southern
site area), and one another has a hematite
temper; the remainder have no obvious
temper.

stem with horizontal and opposed lines (Var.
C.).
An examination of the clay elbow pipes from
mortuary contexts in the upper Neches River
basin (see Chapter 11), from cemeteries of
known age, indicates the following stylistic
and morphological trends (see Figure 6-23):
 the earliest elbow pipes (Var. A)
are plain L-shaped forms;
 flaring bowl forms are stylistically
sequent, with distal stem knobs; these
pipes (Var. B) have three engraved or
deep incised lines on the stem and
short lines on the lower bowl; some
examples have pedestal bases (Figure
6-24a);
 Var. C pipes have engraved/
incised lines on the stem, and lines on
the pipe that extend along the entirety
of the stem and basal portions of the
bowl (Figure 6-24b-c);
 In Var. D pipes, the parallel
engraved or incised lines extending
along the stem and the lower body are
replaced by long rows of small
punctations (see Figure 6-23);
 Var. E elbow pipes are the first
forms that are completely covered
with decoration, in this case
curvilinear incised lines; and lastly
 cross-hatched
pipes (Var. F).

elbow

At the Lang Pasture site, Var. A-C elbow pipe
forms are present. The pipes from mortuary
contexts are Var. A forms, while all the three
forms are present in domestic contexts. In
other upper Neches River basin sites of known
age (i.e., dating to the Frankston phase,
subphase 1-3, and the Allen phase), Var. A
pipes are restricted to pre-A.D. 1480
components. Var. B pipes are present in ca.
A.D. 1400-1560 cemeteries such as Pierce
Freeman (41AN34), Mrs. J. W. Blackburn
(41CE4), Omer and Otis Hood (41CE14),
cemetery #1, and John Bragg (41CE23), as
well as ceremonial contexts at the A. C.
Saunders site (41AN19), while Var. C pipes
occur from ca. A.D. 1400-1650. Var. D-F are
all apparently post-A.D. 1560 elbow pipe
forms as they are present only in Frankston
phase, subphase 3, and Allen phase burials at
Emma Owens (41AN21), the Fred McKee
(41AN32, four examples), E. W. Hackney
(41CE6), and Jim P. Allen (41CE12)
cemeteries.
Although not present at the Lang pasture site,
there are other elbow pipes in the upper
Neches River basin that have a variety of
incised-punctated
decorations
(Jackson
1933:75, 78; Gilmore 1974:Table 68;
Kleinschmidt 1982). Jackson (1933:75) refers
to these as Neches pipes, usually with rows of
punctations on the stem, heel, and bowl (see
Figure 6-23d; see also Jackson 1936:Plate 28),
and rows of raised bands, forming a collar at
the stem (Shafer 1981:Figure 9e). These
appear to be elbow pipe forms that date from
post-A.D. 1480 times, which is corroborated
by their absence at the Lang Pasture site.

OTHER CERAMIC OBJECTS
FROM THE LANG PASTURE SITE
(41AN38)

There are only a few other ceramic artifacts in
the collections from the Lang Pasture site. All
are from the northern part of the site (Table 6­
30).
The first of these is a 13.5 mm wide and thick
grog-tempered clay coil or vessel leg/foot
support (see Table 6-29), such as are seen on
various upper Neches River basin vessels

Technical Report No. 174202

(among them Killough Pinched jars, see
below). The fragment is 23.8 mm in length.
There are also three pieces of burned clay
(lacking impressions of plant remains,
branches, or sticks) from Features 25, 76, and
79. Two of the pieces are small, but the larger
piece from Feature 76 is 43 x 29.8 x 16.5 mm
in length, width, and thickness, and may have
come from a baked griddle piece or some
other culinary facility; this particular piece is
grog-tempered. The overall and virtually
complete absence of daub and burned clay

217

Chapter 6: Ceramic Artifacts from the Lang Pasture Site (41AN38) and the Place of the Site Within an
Upper Neches River Basin Caddo Ceramic Tradtion

from the Lang Pasture site is notable, and
strongly indicates that the structures here were
not daub-covered. It is also doubtful that the
prehistoric Caddo structures were burned
down, which would have increased the
likelihood that daub pieces would be
preserved. Without burning or exposure to
heat, any clay-covered and thatched walls of
Caddo structures (i.e., wattle and daubcovered) would have gradually melted away,
leaving little to no evidence for the use of clay
and thatching to cover the house walls or roof.
It is also possible that Caddo structures in this
area did not generally have a wattle and daub
covering, and this seems the most reasonable
explanation for the general dearth of daub and
burned clay at the Lang Pasture site. Fray
Casanas in 1691 had noted that “all the
[Caddo] tribes towards the north and east [of
the Hasinai] live in pueblos. They plant in the
same way as the Asinai [Hasinai]. Some have
settlements better organized than others, such
as the Cadaudachos [Kadohadacho or
Cadohadacho], Nasitox [Natchitoches], and
others whose houses are located close together
and are well plastered” (Hatcher 1927c:287;
Swanton 1942:251; brackets added). Large
amounts of daub from wall plastered houses
on prehistoric and early historic Caddo sites in

northeastern Texas tend to be found in parts of
the Sabine, Big Cypress, Sulphur River, and
Red River basins, but very rarely in sites south
of the Sabine River basin. This dichotomy
implies differences across the landscape in the
construction of houses by the Caddo, as well
as their use and eventual abandonment (i.e.,
deliberate burning of structures). The Lang
Pasture Caddo houses tended not to be both
wattle and daub-covered.
Two clay spindle whorls (Figure 6-25) were
recovered from Feature 76. Spindle whorls are
disk-shaped sherds (usually base sherds or
thick body sherds) that have a central
perforation or hole drilled in them; the central
perforations on the two specimens from the
site are 10.7-13.0 mm in diameter. The spindle
whorl would have been affixed on a spindle to
help maintain its rotary motion during
spinning activities. The presence of two
spindle whorls at the Lang Pasture site
suggests that Caddo women were processing
fibers to produce textiles (cf. Alt 1999) there
from the 14th to the 15th centuries A.D.
Materials that could have been used include
animal hair and various vegetable fibers,
among them hemp, slippery elm, mulberry,
milkweed, and nettle, as well as the bark of
trees.

Another clay artifacts (N198 E201) is
laminated in cross-section, and has no temper,
but is rounded in cross-section (6.5 mm in
thickness), and smoothed on its exterior
surface. The rounded cross-section suggests
that this may be part of a clay plug or vessel
stopper, or less likely, a fragment of a ceramic
ear spool.
The final miscellaneous clay artifact (N192
E202, level 5) is an oval-shaped pendant 29.0
mm in length and 16.0 mm in width (Figure 6­
26). The pendant has a 2.0 mm suspension
hole at the narrower end. The pendant was
made with a sandy clay, but no obvious
temper was added to the paste. One side of the
pendant has a fire cloud that must have been
produced during the firing of this clay
ornament.

METHODS OF STUDY OF UPPER
NECHES RIVER BASIN CADDO
VESSELS

Because of the number of ceramic vessels in
the collections from the Lang Pasture site as
well as in generally contemporaneous
prehistoric Caddo sites in the upper Neches
River basin in the TARL collections that we
proposed to study for comparative purposes,
we established a documentation protocol to
assist in the study of each of the vessels from
the different sites. Each of the ceramic vessels
in the collections is described and analyzed
utilizing a consistent set of morphological,
functional, and stylistic attributes modeled
after the presentations in Cast et al. (2006);
Gadus and Fields (1996); Gonzalez et al.
(2005), Perttula et al. (1998, 2008), and
Perttula (2005, ed.). The purpose of the
documentation is to thoroughly characterize
the character of each of the ceramic vessels in
the different upper Neches River basin Caddo
collections. Appendix F.3 and F.4 provide the

219

Chapter 6: Ceramic Artifacts from the Lang Pasture Site (41AN38) and the Place of the Site Within an
Upper Neches River Basin Caddo Ceramic Tradtion

completed vessel recordation forms (Figure 6­
27) from the Lang Pasture site and seven other
prehistoric Caddo sites in the basin, as well as
accompanying
vessel
photographic
illustrations.
The following attributes were employed in the
ceramic vessel study:
Non-plastics:
Deliberate
and
indeterminate materials in the paste
(Rice 1987:411), including a variety
of tempers (grog or crushed sherds,
bone, hematite, shell, quartz sands,
etc.) and “particulate matter of some
size.” The grog, bone, and hematite
non-plastics appear to have been
deliberately added to the paste as
tempers. The bone used for temper
had been burned and calcined, then
crushed, before it was added to the
paste.

Vessel Form: The principal vessel
form
categories
include
open
containers (bowls, carinated bowls,
and compound bowls) and restricted
containers, including jars and bottles
(Figure 6-27 a-j)) of several shapes
and sizes. As restricted containers, jars
allow access by hand, but bottles do
not (Brown 1996:335). Another
important vessel form, at least in
burial contexts, is the effigy bowl
(Figure 6-27 k) with a modeled head
(usually a bird or duck head) and a tab
tail. Occasionally, an effigy vessel
will have a broader tab tail that
supported a anthropomorphic or
zoomorphic tail rider (see Suhm and
Jelks 1962:Plate 24k).

e, inverted rim carinated bowl; g, everted rim jar; h, cylindrical jar; I, globular bottle; j,
simple bowl; k, effigy bowl.

Additional form attributes that were recorded
on each of the vessels (depending upon their
completeness) include the rim profile
(outflaring or everted, vertical or standing, and
inverted), lip profile (rolled to the exterior,
rounded, flat, or thinned), and base shape (flat
or rounded).
Core Colors: Observations on
ceramic cross-section colors permit
consideration of oxidation patterns
(Teltser 1993:Figure 2A-H; Perttula
2005, ed.), and thus the conditions
under which the vessel was fired and
then cooled after firing. Comments are
included for these attributes on the

Technical Report No. 174202

presence and location of fire-clouding,
sooting or smudging from cooking use
(Skibo 1992), and the preservation and
location of charred organic remains.
Wall Thickness: Thickness was
recorded in millimeters, using a
vernier caliper, at the lip, along the
rim, at several points along the body,
and at the base when possible (only
for the vessels that were not
complete).
Interior and Exterior Surface
Treatment: The primary methods of
finishing the surface of the vessel

221

Chapter 6: Ceramic Artifacts from the Lang Pasture Site (41AN38) and the Place of the Site Within an
Upper Neches River Basin Caddo Ceramic Tradtion

include smoothing, burnishing, and
polishing (Rice 1987:138). Brushing
is a popular method of roughening the
surface (particularly the body) of large
and small Middle (ca. A.D. 1200­
1400) and Late Caddo (ca. A.D. 1400­
1680) period cooking jars, but is here
considered a decorative treatment
rather than solely a functional surface
treatment (cf. Rice 1987:138),
although not all Caddo ceramic
analysts treat brushing as a decorative
treatment (cf. Gadus et al. 2006:31).
In certain fine ware vessels, brushed
bodies accompanied engraved rim
panels. Smoothing creates “a finer and
more regular surface…[and] has a
matte rather than a lustrous finish”
(Rice 1987:138). Burnishing, on the
other hand, creates an irregular
lustrous finish marked by parallel
facets left by the burnishing tool
(perhaps a pebble or bone). A polished
surface treatment is marked by a
uniform and highly lustrous surface
finish, done when the vessel is dry,
but without “the pronounced parallel
facets produced by burnishing leatherhard clay” (Rice 1987:138).
The application of a hematite-rich clay slip
(Ferring and Perttula 1987), either red or black
after firing in an oxidizing or reducing (i.e.,
low-oxygen) environment, is another form of
surface treatment noted in these vessel
assemblages, albeit very rarely. The clay slip
is more frequently applied on the vessel
exterior than on the interior surface, and then
was either burnished or polished after it was
leather-hard or dry.
Height and Orifice Diameter: These
attributes, measured in centimeters,
were recorded with a ruler.
Diameter at Bottom of Rim and
Base Diameter: Also recorded in
millimeters using a ruler, these
attributes permit characterization of

222

the overall contour and shape of the
vessel.
Volume: Vessel volume in liters was
determined by filling (to within 1 mm
of the lip) the vessel with lentil seeds,
then dumping the lentil seeds in
containers of known volume. In
estimating the volume of vessels with
holes, the vessel was first filled with a
cloth that conformed to vessel
contours, then the lentil seeds were
poured into the depression in the cloth
to within 1 mm of the top of the lip.
Then they were dumped into
containers of known volume. In cases
where the vessels were not (or could
not)
be
reconstructed,
but
measurements of height and orifice
diameter were be obtained, volumes
were estimated by comparison with
known vessel volumes of specific
forms (i.e., carinated bowl, jar, bottle,
compound bowl, and bowl) in other
documented
Caddo
vessel
assemblages.
Decoration: Decorative techniques
present in the vessel collections from
sites in the upper Neches River Basin
of East Texas include engraving and
excising,
incising,
punctating,
pinching, lip notching, brushing, neck
banding, and appliquéing, and on
certain vessels, combinations of
decorative techniques (i.e., brushed­
punctated) created the decorative
elements and motifs. Engraving and
lip notching was done with a sharp
tool when the vessel was either
leather-hard, or after it was fired,
while the other decorative techniques
were executed with tools (incising and
punctation), by adding strips of clay to
the wet body (appliqué), by crimping
the coils (neck banding), using frayed
sticks or grass stems (brushing)
dragged across the body surface, or
fingernails
(certain
forms
of
punctations and pinching), when the

Technical Report No. 174202

Archeological Investigations at the Lang Pasture Site (41AN38) in the Upper Neches River Basin of East Texas
Texas Department of Transportation

vessel was wet or still plastic.
Excising is considered a form of
engraved decoration, where the clay is
deliberately
and
closely
marked/scraped and carved away with
a sharp tool, usually to create
triangular elements (the pendant
triangle or small tick marks) or
crescent-shaped elements that separate
or serve to define scrolls (Suhm and
Jelks 1962:Plate 64a–b, f).
Another form of vessel decoration is
the use of red (hematite or ochre) or
white (kaolin) clay pigments that have
been smeared or rubbed into the
engraved lines of certain vessels.
Type: The kinds of named ceramic
types in the Lang Pasture and TARL
collections from the upper Neches
River basin follow the work of Suhm
and Jelks (1962) and Kleinschmidt
(1982), as well as the new types and
varieties defined herein (see below).
In the sections that follow, I first discuss the
character of the vessels found in mortuary
contexts at the Lang Pasture site as well as the
mortuary vessels from seven nearby and
culturally
affiliated
prehistoric
Caddo
cemeteries (see Figure 6-1). Then I use this
vessel data to make comparisons of the kinds
of decorative motifs and elements found on
the different kinds of vessel forms, followed
by assemblage-level considerations of vessel
form, vessel size, use of temper, and firing
conditions, as well as the use of pigments.
Lastly, I employ the data from Lang Pasture,
the aforementioned seven mortuary sites,
along with other upper Neches River basin
sites, to examine temporal and spatial trends in
Late Caddo and Historic Caddo fine ware
pottery types and varieties in the Upper
Neches, building on the temporal seriation of
vessels and the definition of sub-phases 1-3 by
Kleinschmidt (1982) and Perttula (2007b).
Here, I also discuss the defined varieties of
Poynor Engraved, Hume Engraved, and Patton
Engraved—the main fine ware vessels made in

Technical Report No. 174202

the region—as well as provide details on the
several new pottery types recognized in the
vessel analysis (Fair Plain, Hood Engraved,
Hood Plain, Hume Plain, Poynor Plain, and
Poynor Brushed).

A total of 31 vessels or partial vessel sections
were among the funerary offerings placed with
the Caddo burials at the Lang Pasture site (see
Chapters 5 and 11, this volume; see also
Appendix F.3). This includes 10 carinated
bowls, 11 bowls, three compound bowls
(apparently a rare vessel form in the upper
Neches), three jars, and four bottles. One of
the more distinctive features of the mortuary
vessels from the site is the high frequency of
plain vessels (61%).
Three of the 10 carinated bowls are engraved
(Figure 6-28e) with distinctive local varieties
of Poynor Engraved: local variety 1, 3, and 4
(Figure 6-29a, c-d). These have rim panels
with triangular, semi-circular, and circular
decorative elements, sometimes hatched, but
in the case of the opposed triangles in local
variety 1 (see Figures 6-28e and 6-29a), the
three corners of the triangular elements are
hatched. Local varieties 1 and 4 match the
unnamed but lettered regional varieties F and
K, respectively (see below) of Poynor
Engraved.
One other carinated bowl is red-slipped. The
other six are plain: one of the plain carinated
bowls has a series of rim peaks as a lip
embellishment, and another plain carinated
bowl from the site is lip notched (see Figure 6­
28b).
One of the three compound bowls is plain
(Figure 6-30b). The second, a Poynor
Engraved, local variety 2 compound bowl, has
stacked engraved triangles and centrally
placed circles or sun symbols (see Figure 6­
29b). The third compound bowl is also
engraved (Figure 6-30a)—a local variety 5 of

223

Chapter 6: Ceramic Artifacts from the Lang Pasture Site (41AN38) and the Place of the Site Within an
Upper Neches River Basin Caddo Ceramic Tradtion

Poynor Engraved—with semi-circles and
hatched triangles in a rim panel divided by
vertical and diagonal engraved lines (see
Figure 6-29e). Local varieties 2 and 5 of
Poynor Engraved are apparently quite rare at
other upper Neches River basin Caddo sites, as
only a single example of either has been
identified from the region, that being a local
variety 2 vessel found at a Frankston phase
sub-phase 1 site (Rose Daniels, 41AN23).
Two of the 11 bowls from the Lang Pasture
site are decorated. These include a Poynor

224

Engraved, local variety 1 or regional var. F
(nested ovals and triangles divided by diagonal
cross-hatched ladders, see below) bowl with
rim peaks (Figure 6-31c) and a Killough
Pinched bowl with scalloped lips. The plain
bowls include simple bowls (Figure 6-30a-b)
and a triangular-shaped bowl (Figure 6-31d).
A number of these plain bowls have either
scalloped lips (33%) or rim peaks (22%).
There are no effigy vessels in this mortuary
vessel assemblage.

There are two plain bottles in the Lang Pasture
mortuary vessel assemblage, both with
relatively long necks and globular bodies
(Figure 6-32a-b); the absence of the distinctive
short-necked Hume Engraved and Hume Plain
bottles (see below), which are a common
feature in post-A.D. 1400 mortuary vessel
assemblages in the upper Neches, is notable.
One of the bottles has a carinated body form
(Figure 6-32b).
Two of the jars are Maydelle Incised vessels
(Figure 6-33a). One of these has a cross­
hatched incised motif, while the other has
incised triangles filled with tool punctates. The
third jar is plain.
Certainly the most unique vessels from the
Lang Pasture site are two engraved vessels

Technical Report No. 174202

with suspension holes. The vessel forms
themselves—a neckless bottle or seed jar
(Figure 6-34a) and a wide-necked bottle or
compound vessel (Figure 6-34b)—are
unparalleled in other mortuary vessel
assemblages from the upper Neches River
basin.
The neckless bottle is decorated with a series
of diagonal panels decorated with engraved or
rocker-stamped elements. The rim has a single
row of rocker stamping (see Figure 6­
34a).From top to bottom on the vessel, the
diagonal panels begin with a zone of cross­
hatched engraved pendant triangles inside the
panel, followed by a rocker-stamped panel
with cross-hatched engraved pendant triangles
(14 and 18, respectively) on the outside of the
panel. The third diagonal panel is filled with

227

Chapter 6: Ceramic Artifacts from the Lang Pasture Site (41AN38) and the Place of the Site Within an
Upper Neches River Basin Caddo Ceramic Tradtion

rocker stamps (forming triangular areas within
the panel) and very small tick-like rocker
stamping on either side of the panel. This is
followed by a fourth panel that is just like the
second in having rocker stamping within the
panel (forming triangular areas) and cross­
hatched engraved pendant triangles on the
outside of the panel. The last panel is
comprised of two diagonal rows of cross­
hatched engraved pendant triangles (13 and
15, respectively), with a row of smaller rocker
stamps inside the panel itself.
This
engraved-rocker
stamped
vessel
resembles the Garland Engraved type as
described by Early (1993:90) in having the
roughened rocker-stamped zones and the
cross-hatched background or fill elements.

Early (2006 personal communication)
indicates that vessels with this shape and
decoration may date to ca. A.D. 1400, if not
earlier, and are very common in the Hot
Spring County, Arkansas area in the Ouachita
River valley. This suggests that Vessel 2 from
Feature 76B is a trade ware from a
southwestern Arkansas Caddo group.
The neck of the wide-necked bottle or
compound vessel is decorated with horizontal
and diagonal hatched engraved zones or
narrow panels repeated three times around the
neck (see Figure 6-34b). The body has
interlocking horizontal scrolls repeated six
times around the vessel, as in the Poynor
Engraved, var. B examples from the upper
Neches River basin (see below).

VESSELS FROM SELECTED
UPPER NECHES RIVER BASIN
CADDO SITES

Mrs. J. M. Cook (41AN1)
Another distinctive feature of the mortuary
vessels from the Lang Pasture site is their
generally small size. Only two of the vessels
(6.5%) have volumes greater than 2 liters (a
large bowl and a compound bowl) (Figure 6­
35). Differences in orifice diameter and
volumes of the vessel forms in the burials
indicate that two different sizes of bottles were
in use, as well as a number of small bowls and
carinated bowls, several medium-sized
carinated and compound bowls, and mediumsized jars. None of these vessels were clearly
intended to be used for communal purposes,
but were instead designed to hold only a few
servings of food for the deceased to use on
their journey to the House of the Dead.

Technical Report No. 174202

The Mrs. J. M. Cook Site was excavated in
1931 by a UT crew (Jackson 1931). All six
burials found at this sub-phase 2 Frankston
phase (ca. A.D. 1480-1560) cemetery had
associated vessels as funerary offerings. A
total of 33 vessels are in the TARL collections
from the site. They include 11 carinated
bowls, one compound bowl, nine jars, eight
bowls, and four bottles.
The 11 carinated bowls are all of the Poynor
Engraved type, even though there are inverted
rim forms (Figure 6-36a), direct rim forms
(Figure 6-36b), and globular carinated bowls
(Figure 6-36c). Recognized varieties include
Poynor Engraved, var. Cook (n=4), Poynor
Engraved, var. Hood

(n=2, including one with brushing on its

(n=3), and Poynor Engraved, var. Lang (n=1,
with brushing on the body). The last engraved
carinated bowl is a Poynor Engraved, var. R
vessel, with concentric semi-circles on the rim
panel (see below). The one compound bowl—
with two distinct panels—has a var. Lang
motif on the lower body panel (see Figure 6­
36d). The upper rim panel is plain.
Only one of the bowls in the mortuary
assemblage is plain, and this particular vessel
has lip tabs. A second bowl is a Killough
Pinched rattle bowl with pinching rows
covering the entirety of the vessel and the four
large rattle nodes (Figure 6-37d). The other
bowls have engraved designs.

230

Three of the engraved bowls from the Mrs. J.
M. Cook site are Hood Engraved effigy bowls,
including one each of var. Cook, var. Hood
(see Figure 6-37b), and var. Allen (see Figure
6-37c) with its zoomorphic tail rider. Two
other bowls have Poynor Engraved designs:
Poynor Engraved, var. Hood and Poynor
Engraved, regional variety Q (hatched nested
triangles, see below). The one remaining bowl
is a simple bowl with cross-hatched vertical
panels and pendant triangles (see Figure 6­
37a). Kleinschmidt (1982) includes this design
as Motif 4 for Hume Engraved, although the
same elements occur on several different but
unnamed varieties of Poynor Engraved
recognized in the upper Neches River basin.

There are three different bottle forms in the
Mrs. J. M. Cook mortuary vessels: (a) a single
example of a form with globular body and a
short but wide neck (Figure 6-38a), (b) a bottle
form (n=2) with an elongated body and a short
neck (Figure 6-38b), and (c) one bottle with an
elongated neck and a squat body (Figure 638c). The globular-bodied bottle, Hume
Engraved, var. unspecified, has vertical
engraved panels on the body, and the body-

Technical Report No. 174202

neck juncture is encircled with a row of large
hatched pendant triangles (Figure 6-38a). The
Fair Engraved bottle with the Fair Plain shape
(see Figure 6-38c) has large hatched triangles
on the bottle neck (Figure 6-38c). The two
other Hume Engraved bottles include one with
cross-hatched vertical panels and hatched
pendant triangles (Figure 6-38b) and another
with broad closely-spaced horizontal engraved
lines on the short neck, and the body is plain.

Two of the nine jars, both with lug handles,
are plain. Another two are Bullard Brushed
jars (Figure 6-39b), one has a neck banded rim
and a vertically brushed body (La Rue Neck
Banded), and there is an interesting Maydelle
Incised jar with a cross-hatched incised rim
design (Figure 6-39a). In addition, there are a
series of appliqued nodes under the lip and the
vessel body is covered with large tool
punctations.
The remaining jars (n=3) are Killough Pinched
(see Figure 6-38c). These have vertical
pinched rows on the rim and pinched
concentric circles and spirals covering the
vessel body. Two have pinched strap handles
and the other has pinched lug handles. The
Killough Pinched jars with strap handles also
have a substantial pedestal base with four legs;
the pedestal base itself is undecorated, but the
legs have vertical rows of pinching (see Figure
6-38c).
The full range of vessel sizes and shapes occur
in the mortuary vessel assemblage from the
Mrs. J. M. Cook site. This includes one size of
bottle, a number of medium-sized jars, and
small to large bowls (Figure 6-40).

(1.5-3 liters), and one very large carinated
bowl (>4 liters). The number of large carinated
bowls suggests that communal food service
may have been a common part of the burial
rituals at the Mrs. J. M. Cook site.
J. M. Cook (41AN2)
Carinated bowls are well represented in the 17
mortuary vessels from the J. M. Cook site
(Jackson 1931); they account for 64.7% of the
vessels. There are also three bowls, two
bottles, and a jar in the collection. Vessel and
motif seriations (Kleinschmidt 1982; Perttula
2007b, see also below) indicate that this
cemetery dates to sub-phase 3 of the Frankston
phase.
Only a single plain vessel is amongst the
globular and vertical-rimmed carinated bowls
from the site. The others are engraved,
including Poynor Engraved, var. Freeman
(n=5, Figure 6-40b-c); Poynor Engraved, var.
Cook (n=2, Figure 6-41a), both with brushed
bodies; regional Poynor Engraved, var. T
(n=1, diagonal engraved with small pendant
triangles), and one vessel that has elements of
both var. E (scroll and circle) and var. N (oval
and diamond motif).

Carinated bowls range from small in size (<1
liter), to medium-sized (1-1.5 liters), large

body. Both bottles have elongated bottles and
short necks. One is engraved (Hume

There is a wide range in vessel sizes in the J.
M. Cook mortuary vessels. A number of the
carinated bowls are large (2-4 liters) to very
large (6 liters) in volume (Figure 6-42),
suggesting some communal use of these
serving vessels was intended, but there are
also miniature, small, and medium-sized
carinated bowls in the assemblage. There is
one size of bottle placed in the graves as well
as one medium-sized class of bowls (Figure 6­
42).

Poynor Engraved vessels from the Fred
McKee site include the defined varieties:
Poynor Engraved, var. Blackburn (n=2),
Poynor Engraved, var. Cook (n=1, Figure 6­
43b), Poynor Engraved, var. Freeman (n=3,
Figure 6-43c), and Poynor Engraved, var.
Hood (n=2, Figure 6-43d). Other regional
varieties in the engraved carinated bowls are
Poynor Engraved, var. E (n=2, scroll and
circle, Figure 6-43a), var. N (n=1, hooked arm
and ovals), and var. P (n=1, hooked arm
motif).

Fred McKee (41AN32)
Four prehistoric Caddo burials have been
excavated at the Fred McKee site (Woolsey
1935l), another sub-phase 3 Frankston phase
cemetery in the upper Neches. The sample of
vessels includes 15 carinated bowls, two
bowls, three bottles, and three jars.
Two of the carinated bowls are globular
Poynor Plain vessels, while the other 13 (both
globular and inverted rim forms) have
engraved decorations; three of the engraved
vessels are also brushed on the body. The

238

One of the two bowls from the Fred McKee
site is a Hood Engraved, var. unspecified
effigy bowl missing its head and tabtails (see
Figure 6-43e). The other is a Poynor, var.
Hood bowl with small loop handles.
There are two different forms of bottles in the
mortuary assemblage. One form, otherwise
plain, has a distinct collar at the neck-body
juncture, a globular body, and a broad neck
(Figure 6-44b). The second form (Hume
Engraved, var. unspecified) has an elongated
body and a short neck (Figure 6-44a).

Two of the jars have tool punctated rim areas
and vertically brushed bodies (Figure 6-45a­
b). Suhm and Jelks (1962:157 and Plate 79a-b)
have previously referred to these particular
kinds of decorated vessels as “miscellaneous
Caddoan utility pottery.” The third vessel is a
Bullard Brushed jar.
A number of the Fred McKee mortuary
vessels are large (3-6 liters in volume) or very
large in size, especially a number of carinated
bowls and a single jar (Figure 6-46). There are
also bottles of two different sizes, small and
large bowls, medium-sized jars, and small and
miniature carinated bowls.
J. W. Blackburn (41CE4)
The J. W. Blackburn site had six burials in a
small cemetery (Woolsey 1935b). The 24
vessels documented during the course of these
ceramic analyses include 13 carinated bowls,

Technical Report No. 174202

seven bottles, one bowl, and three jars.
Kleinschmidt (1982) considers the cemetery to
have been used during sub-phase 2 of the
Frankston phase.
Only one of the carinated bowls from the J. W.
Blackburn site may be plain, but the rim is
missing. The others have engraved motifs on
rim panels of inverted and globular carinated
bowls (Figure 6-46). Four of these vessels
have brushed decorations on vessels, and two
of these also have lip notching.
Vessels of the Poynor Engraved, var.
Blackburn variety (n=4, see Figure 6-47b-c)
are the most common at the site, followed by
Poynor Engraved, var. Cook (n=2, one of
which is brushed on the body) and Poynor
Engraved, var. Hood (n=3). All three of the
var. Hood vessels have brushed bodies and
two are lip notched (see Figure 6-47a). There
are also two var. C Poynor vessels (continuous

241

Chapter 6: Ceramic Artifacts from the Lang Pasture Site (41AN38) and the Place of the Site Within an

rows of hatched triangles), and one Poynor
Engraved, var. D vessel (vertical cross­
hatched panels) with lip tabs and a brushed
body (see Figure 6-47d). Suhm and Jelks
(1962:Plate 42f) previously classified this as a
Hume Engraved vessel, but the vessel form is
decidedly not an elongated short-necked
bottle—which I prefer to use as the
prototypical form for both Hume Engraved
and Hume Plain vessels—and cross-hatched
ladders and panels are a common element in
three other Poynor Engraved local varieties
(var. F, G, and M, see below).
The one bowl in the J. W. Blackburn vessel
assemblage is a Hood Engraved, var. Hood
effigy bowl. On this vessel, the bird effigy
head is facing inwards towards the other side

of the vessel. House (2003:54) suggests that
this is a stylized “ventral (belly-upward)”
portrayal of the bird.
All of the bottles from the J. W. Blackburn site
are elongated bottles with short necks (Figure
6-48a-d). Two are Hume Plain bottles Figure
6-48d), while the other five are Hume
Engraved, var. unspecified. Four have vertical
engraved elements (panels and ladders) that
run down the elongated body (Figure 6-48a-b),
while the fifth has two horizontal engraved
lines below the neck, with a series of 28
hatched triangles pendant from the lowermost
horizontal line (Figure 6-48c).

The three jars are all Killough Pinched
vessels with everted rims (Figure 6-49, a-b).
These vessels have pinched rows and/or
circular pinching decorative elements
covering the entire surface of each jar; each
jar also has two opposing strap handles. Two
of the three Killough Pinched jars have
distinctive pedestal or ring bases. Anderson
et al. (1974:Figure 3) suggests these
distinctive vessels were used to hold body
paint or incense, but there is no evidence of
such use preserved in these Killough
Pinched jars, or similar jars from other upper
Neches River basin mortuary vessels.
Based on orifice diameter and volume
measurements, there are five different sizes
of carinated bowls in the J. W. Blackburn
mortuary vessels (Figure 6-50), ranging
from miniatures to very large vessels more
than 5 liters in volume. There is a single
large bowl and three miniature jars, as well
as two sizes of bottles (see Figure 6-50).
Omer and Otis Hood (41CE14),
Cemeteries #1 and #2
There are two Frankston phase cemeteries
on the Omer and Otis Hood site (Woolsey
1935m). Cemetery #1 had 23 burials (18 of
which were dug by a UT crew), and dates to
sub-phase 2 of the Frankston phase
(Kleinschmidt 1982). Cemetery #2, an
earlier sub-phase 1 burial ground, had only
three burials, two excavated by Woolsey and
crew. Between the two cemeteries there are
118 vessels in the TARL collections
available for analysis, 106 vessels from
Cemetery #1 and 12 vessels from Cemetery
#2.
The Cemetery #1 vessels include 55
carinated bowls, one compound bowl, 25
bottles, 15 jars, and 10 bowls. Within each
of these vessel classes, there are several

246

forms, particularly in the carinated bowls
(globular-shaped, inverted rim, direct rim)
and bottles (short neck/elongated body,
carinated body, beaker-shaped, globularshaped body and a long neck, and widemouth neckless).
Only one of the carinated bowls is plain, and
two (cf. Poynor Brushed) are brushed on the
vessel body and the rim is plain. The
remainder of the carinated bowls have
engraved motifs on rim panels. Ten (19%)
of the engraved carinated bowls have lip
notching (Figure 6-50a, d), two others have
rim peaks, and six (11.5%) have engraved
rim panels and brushed vessel bodies.
In terms of shape, more than half of the
carinated bowls (n=28) from Cemetery #1
are globular-shaped (see Figure 6-51e-f, h).
Another 38% have inverted rims (see Figure
6-51c-d), while a few others have either
direct or slightly everted rim forms (see
Figure 6-51a-b).
All the engraved carinated bowls are
classified as Poynor Engraved. The
following defined varieties of Poynor
Engraved are recognized in the Cemetery #1
vessels: var. Hood (n=23, 1 with a pedestal
base, 3 lip notched, 2 with a brushed body,
and 1 with rim peaks (see Figure 6-51c-d, gh), var. Lang (n=6, 1 lip notched), var.
Blackburn (n=6, see Figure 6-51e-f), var.
Cook (n=11, 6 lip notched, 1 with a crimped
lip, 3 brushed on the vessel body, and 1 with
rim peaks, see Figure 6-51a), one that has
both var. Cook (ovals) and var. Blackburn
(rectangular panels) elements. Regional
varieties of Poynor Engraved in the
cemetery vessels include var. E (n=2, 1
brushed on the body, scroll and circle, see
Figure 6-51b), var. F (n=1, nested ovals and
diagonal cross-hatched panels), and var. J
(n=1, rectangular panel and nested circle).

There are seven effigy bowls in Cemetery
#1, all with engraved decorations. The Hood
Engraved, var. Hood effigy bowls (n=3)
have broad horizontal engraved lines on the
rim (Figure 6-52b), while the Hood
Engraved, var. Cook effigy bowl (n=1,
Figure 6-52a) has horizontal engraved lines
and, under the effigy head and tab tail
attachments, hatched pendant triangles.
Three others are classified as Hood
Engraved, var. unspecified because the
appendages have been broken off.
The other bowls include two plain vessels
(one a deep bowl and the other with an
everted rim), and a brushed bowl with a
direct rim.
Five of the bottles are plain. They have

The two beaker-shaped Poynor Engraved
bottles (see Figure 6-53a) includes one with
a short neck and engraved panels on the
body filled with var. Blackburn panels, and
another with circular elements inside
vertical panels. Other Poynor Engraved
bottles (n=14) primarily have elongated
bodies and short necks (n=9; one has a
notched lip), but bottles with wide mouths
(n=1, see Figure 6-53d), carinated bodies
(n=1), and globular bodies (n=3, see Figure
6-53f-g) are also present in the mortuary
assemblage. These vessels are decorated
with a diversity of engraved motifs and
elements, including:


negative ovals and circles (n=1),

 sets of horizontal lines on the
bottle body (n=1),


a var. Hood motif (n=3),

 var. K (n=2, semi-circles and

another (var. unspecified) has vertical
hatched panels and lines on the body. The
third has horizontal engraved licks and
pendant hatched triangles on the neck,
similar to Hume Engraved, var. Allen,
except that this variety as defined from the
Jim P. Allen site (41CE12) is more
commonly a bowl form rather than a shortnecked bottle. The one remaining bottle is a
short-necked form with a series of closelyspaced horizontal lines on the neck, and is
probably also a variety of Hume Engraved.

There are both direct (Figure 6-54a-b, d) and
everted rim (Figure 6-54c, e-f) jar forms in
the mortuary vessel assemblage from
Cemetery #1. The everted rim vessels tend
to have either two strap handles or loop
handles. Strap handles were either left plain
or have short horizontal incised lines on
them.
In terms of decorations on the jars, none are
plain. Six have punctated designs (see
Figure 6-53b, e), either rows of punctations
on the rim, or punctated rows on the rim and
in concentric arcs covering the vessel body.
One jar has punctations on the rim and
appliqued triangular elements filled with
punctations on the upper vessel body; this
vessel has incised strap handles.

There is one Bullard Brushed jar in the
collection (see Figure 6-54d), three
Maydelle Incised vessels, including one with
a vertically brushed body and strap handles
(see Figure 6-54a, c), and another probable
Maydelle Incised jar (also with strap
handles) that has vertical incised lines on the
rim and a brushed body. There are also three
Killough Pinched jars (see Figure 6-54f),
one with strap handles and a pedestal base
and another with U-shaped loop handles.
These vessels have vertical pinched rows on
the rim and concentric pinched rows and
hooked arm elements on the body.
The 12 vessels from Cemetery #2 at the
Omer and Otis Hood site include seven
carinated bowls, one bowl, two bottles, and
two jars. Only one of the carinated bowls is
undecorated, while the others, including
both inverted rim and globular forms (Figure
6-55a-c), are Poynor Engraved. Varieties
represented include var. Cook (n=3, Figure
6-55a-b), including one with sets of lip
nodes (Figure 6-55b) and another with rim

peaks, var. Hood (n=1), var. B (n=1), and
var. F (n=1, Figure 6-55c).
The single bowl from this cemetery is a
Killough Pinched rattle bowl (see Figure 6­
55e). The vessel is completely covered with
pinched rows, as are the four large appliqued
nodes or rattles.
The bottle forms from Cemetery #2 have
relatively long necks and globular bottles;
one of these has a collar at the junction of
the bottle neck and body. Both bottles have
Poynor Engraved decorations, including
regional var. E (scroll and circle motif) and
var. P (hooked arm or scroll motif) (see
below).
One of the large everted rim jars from this
cemetery has vertical pinching on the rim, a
horizontal pinched row at the rim-body
juncture, and vertical brushing on the body
(see Figure 6-55f). The other has deep
pinching on the rim—simulating neck
banding—and a brushed body; this may be a
local example of a La Rue Neck Banded jar.

There is a wide range and diversity in vessel
sizes in the two cemeteries at the Omer and
Otis Hood site (Figure 6-56). It has the only
extra large (>8 liters) carinated bowl in the
suite of upper Neches River mortuary vessel
assemblages, a number of very large and
large carinated bowls (1.5-6 liters) and jars
(2.-3.5 liters), and several large bowls. There
are also bottles of two sizes, miniature,
small, and medium-sized carinated bowls,
jars of smaller sizes, as well as small to
medium-sized bowls with volumes ranging
from 0.1-0.8 liters (Figure 6-56).
E. W. Henry (41CE17)
Excavations by Woolsey (1935k) recovered
a number of vessels from 11 Frankston
phase, sub-phase 1 burials in the E. W.
Henry cemetery. We were able to locate and
document a total of 35 vessels from
mortuary contexts. The 35 vessels include
20 carinated bowls, seven bowls, four
bottles, and four jars.
Six of the 20 carinated bowls are plain
(30%). Three of these are globular and

(cf. Suhm and Jelks 1962:123 and Plate 62b,

The remainder are engraved, with an
impressive number of different regional
varieties of Poynor Engraved being
represented, as well as a possible Hood
Engraved vessel (but lacking the effigy
head/tab tail) with broad horizontal
engraved lines around the rim. The Poynor
Engraved varieties include a globular

Three of the four bottles from the E. W.
Henry site are Poynor Engraved vessels
have neck/body collars (Figure 6-58a, c),
substantial necks, and globular bodies. The
other is an engraved carinated bottle form
(Figure 6-58b). Identifiable motifs on the
Poynor Engraved bottles include var. E
(circle and central cross) and var. K (semi­
circles and nested ovals) (see below). The
carinated bottle, probably also a Poynor
Engraved bottle, has a hooked arm or scroll
motif (similar to Poynor Engraved, var. P),
but with multiple hooked arms covering the
vessel body (Figure 6-58b).

Two of the medium-sized jars are brushed
on the rim and body, and are Bullard

The mortuary vessels from the E. W. Henry
site are almost all small to medium-sized
(less than 20 cm in orifice diameter and less
than 2 liters in volume), with only one large
jar (3 liters in volume) (Figure 6-60). There
is one bottle size, small and medium-sized
jars, miniature bowls and carinated bowls
(possibly placed in the graves of infants and
children), and small to medium-sized bowls

and carinated bowls. The overall small size
of the vessels suggest they were intended for
individual use over the course of several
days to hold and serve foods.
R. J. Fair (41CE25)
Twenty-seven vessels were recovered from
nine of 10 burials excavated at the R. J. Fair
site cemetery (Woolsey 1935i). The R. J.
Fair site is a sub-phase 3 (ca. A.D. 1560­
1650) Frankston phase cemetery (see
Kleinschmidt 1982; Perttula 2007b).
The 27 vessels are dominated by carinated
bowls (n=16, 59%), globular and direct rim
forms, and bottles (n=10, 37%). There is a
single plain jar.
One of the carinated bowls has a plain rim
and a brushed body (Figure 6-61b). The

Technical Report No. 174202

others all have engraved designs consistent
with defined and regional varieties of either
Poynor Engraved (n=12) or Patton Engraved
(n=3). The Poynor Engraved defined
varieties from the site include var. Hood
(n=6, Figure 6-61d-e), var. Blackburn (n=1),
and var. Freeman (n=3, Figure 6-61c); one
of these vessels has small loop handles. One
var. E (scroll and circle) Poynor Engraved
vessel (with lip notching and brushing on
the body) is also present (Figure 6-61a),
along with a small vessel with handles and a
pedestal base. This particular vessel has only
horizontal engraved lines on the rim—an
atypical Poynor Engraved decorative
element—but a hooked arm and spiral
engraved motif (cf. Poynor Engraved, var.
Freeman, see Figure 6-64i, below) on the
vessel body.

The three Patton Engraved vessels include
two Patton Engraved, var. Fair carinated
bowls (one with loop handles), as well as a
Patton Engraved, var. Allen carinated bowl.
The frequency of Patton Engraved among
the engraved fine wares (20%) suggest the
Caddo cemetery was used near the end of
the Frankston phase. In post-A.D. 1650

262

Allen phase cemeteries in the upper Neches,
Patton Engraved vessels comprise almost
70% of the engraved carinated bowls
(Perttula 2007b:Table 1).
The bottles from the R. J. Fair site are a
diverse lot. Two are plain Fair Plain bottles
with squat globular bodies and elongated

necks (Figure 6-62a), five are Hume
Engraved, var. unspecified bottles with
elongated bodies and a short neck (Figure 6­
62c-d) and the sixth is a Hume Engraved
globular bottle with a short horizontal
engraved neck and a row of hatched pendant
triangles at the neck-body juncture (Figure
6-62b). One other bottle is an elongated
form with a vertically oriented Poynor
Engraved, var. Cook motif on the body. The
last bottle is a cut-down body, with a hooked
arm scroll, reminiscent of Poynor Engraved,
var. N and var. P occasionally seen on
engraved carinated bowls.
The R. J. Fair vessels, except for the bottles,
are uniformly small in size (<1.5 liters)
(Figure 6-63), and suitable for a few
individual servings. The carinated bowls
occur only in miniature, small, and medium
sizes. The bottles range from 0.6-1.1 liters in
volume.
Comparison of Decorative Motifs and
Elements in the Fine Wares
With the exception of two red-slipped
vessels (see Appendix F.5), the fine wares in
the vessel collections analyzed in detail (see
Appendix F.3 and F.4) from the upper
Neches River basin are engraved. The
principal engraved fine wares include
Poynor Engraved, Hume Engraved, Hood
Engraved, and Patton Engraved. Hood
Engraved is newly defined herein, while the
others were first defined by Suhm and
Krieger (1954:306, 336, 342).

Technical Report No. 174202

On the basis of distinct differences in the
style of engraved motifs on each of these
fine ware types—differences that are now
known to have temporal significance (see
below, and probably also have social
significance, but this has not been
established)—I have defined a series of
varieties for each of these types. As with the
Caddo ceramic typology in general use,
varieties are established following the
concepts of Phillips (1958, 1970:24-27; see
also discussion of the type-variety system by
Read [2007:88-92]) as employed with lower
Mississippi Valley ceramics (see Schambach
and Miller 1984:112).
Poynor Engraved is by far the most common
fine ware type in the upper Neches River
basin. Its most distinctive and unifying
characteristic, at least in the case of the
defined varieties to be discussed in a
moment, is the use of rim panels on
carinated bowls—or a rim panel decoration
turned vertically on bottles (Suhm and Jelks
1954:344; see also Campbell 1936)—that
have distinctive dividers, creating central
rectangular, oval, negative oval, and semi­
circular elements. In some cases, there are
additional decorative elements within the
area created by the dividers, including
hatched triangles (so common in the
engraved sherds from the Lang Pasture site),
pendant triangles, circles, punctate-filled
circles, or circles with spurs or ticks.

Figure 6-63. Orifice Diameter and Volume of Different Vessel Forms at the R. J. Fair Site.

Poynor Engraved, var. Blackburn has
rectangular panels (Figure 6-64a). In some
instances, the panels are embellished with
hatched triangles at the top and bottom of
each panel (Figure 6-64b), or also have
small punctate-filled circles within the
rectangular panels (Figure 6-64b’). Similar
punctate-filled circles are also seen in
Poynor Engraved, var. Lang vessels (Figure
6-64g), but they occur always within semi­
circles. Motifs 13, 14, and 18 for Poynor
Engraved
(PO)
in
Kleinschmidt
(1982:Figure 19) are consistent with Poynor,

Technical Report No. 174202

var. Blackburn as defined here, as is Var. A
in Shafer (1968).
The principal stylistic feature of Poynor
Engraved, var. Cook is that it has panels
filled with ovals defined by sets of
vertically-arcing engraved lines (see Figure
6-64c). Sometimes the ovals have hatched
triangle attachments at the top and bottoms
of the panel (see Figure 6-64d). Shafer
(1968) called this Var. C in his early study
of Poynor Engraved, and Motifs 12 and 17

265

Chapter 6: Ceramic Artifacts from the Lang Pasture Site (41AN38) and the Place of the Site Within an
Upper Neches River Basin Caddo Ceramic Tradtion

in Kleinschmidt (1982:Figure 19) represent
clear examples of this variety.
Poynor Engraved, var. Hood, is the
quintessential and most common Poynor
Engraved variety in the upper Neches. It has
rim panels divided by sets of hour glassshaped dividers filled with closely-spaced
hatched or cross-hatched engraved lines.
These hour glass-shaped dividers create a
series of negative ovals within the rim panel
(see Figure 6-63e). Shafer (19968)
combined what I have called Poynor
Engraved, var. Cook and var. Hood within
his Var. C; Motifs 1, 2, and 21 of Poynor
Engraved
(PO,
see
Kleinschmidt
1982:Figure 19) are comparable motifs
within this variety.
With Poynor Engraved, var. Lang, the key
and defining part of the motif is the small
central circle within a series of semi-circles
on the rim panel see (Figure 6-64f-g). The
small central circle may have spurs or be
filled with small punctates. The larger semi­
circles typically have hatched triangle
elements at the top and bottom of the semi­
circles. Figure 6-63g’ may be another
example of var. Lang, in that it has a series
of repeating semi-circles, attached hatched
triangles, and a central element within the
larger semi-circle. In this case, however, the
central element is not a small circle, but the
beginning of a small hooked arm scroll; this
particular element is also seen in other less
common varieties of Poynor Engraved
recognized within the region. Shafer’s
(1968) Var. B is the same as Poynor
Engraved, var. Lang, as are Motifs 4, 27,
and 28 (PO) in Kleinschmidt (1982:Figure
19).
The last defined variety of Poynor Engraved
is var. Freeman (see Figure 6-64h-i). This
variety has hour glass-shaped panel dividers
and hatched/excised pendant triangles at the
top and bottom of each panel. Some
examples of this variety have hooked arm
scrolls and concentric circles on the vessel
body (see Figure 6-64i), which presages the

266

use of similar motifs in Patton Engraved,
var. Freeman, except there the scrolls and
concentric circles and rim panels have small
triangular tick marks (see below). Shafer
(1968) included vessels with these rim
motifs in his Var. A, but in our sorting, we
restricted var. Freeman to vessels that had
hour glass-shaped dividers rather than
rectangular panels (as with var. Blackburn)
and also had pendant triangles on the rim
panel. Kleinschmidt (1982:Figure 20)
includes vessels with this engraved rim style
in his PP category of Poynor Engraved,
vessels with features of both Poynor
Engraved and Patton Engraved. PP Motifs
5, 6, and 11 compare favorably to Poynor
Engraved, var. Freeman as defined here.
As has been mentioned before, Poynor
Engraved is the most common and
widespread of the engraved fine wares in the
upper Neches River basin. The five defined
varieties are found at most of the sites in the
vessel database (see Appendix F.5), as well
as in sherd assemblages from domestic and
mound components (see below; Anderson et
al. 1974; Kleinschmidt 1982; Perttula 2009;
Perttula and Middlebrook 2009). Poynor
Engraved, var. Hood is the most widespread
of the defined varieties, followed by Poynor
Engraved,
var.
Blackburn.
Poynor
Engraved, var. Lang is the least widespread
of the defined varieties. It is noteworthy that
none of the five defined Poynor Engraved
varieties occur in the mortuary assemblage
from the Lang Pasture site, and they are not
readily identified in the southern and
northern area fine ware sherds, although a
few probable Poynor Engraved, var.
Blackburn and var. Cook sherds were
discerned in the southern area (see above).
Two other distinguishing characteristics of
the decorative elements on Poynor Engraved
carinated bowls from the upper Neches are
the frequency of brushed bodies on these
vessels as well as the use of lip notching, in
both sub-phase 2 and sub-phase 3 Frankston
phase mortuary contexts. In the sample of
vessels from Lang Pasture, none of the
engraved carinated bowls have these

Texas Department of Transportation

attributes. These attributes are similarly
absent from sub-phase 1 Frankston phase
mortuary carinated bowls (n=27). By
contrast, brushed Poynor Engraved carinated
bowls comprise 15-19% of these vessels,
respectively, in the later sub-phases. Lip

notched vessels are particularly abundant in
ca. A.D. 1480-1560 contexts (15%), but less
so between ca. A.D. 1560-1650 (2.4%) in
the upper Neches.

As the rim motifs on engraved carinated
bowls and compound bowls were being
reviewed and quantified from the Lang
Pasture site, and by other sites in the upper
Neches River basin (which unfortunately

Technical Report No. 174202

Kleinschmidt [1982] never did with the
numerous [n=97] rim motifs he illustrated
for both the PO and PP categories of Poynor
Engraved), less common rim motifs present
at only a few sites (and thus their spatial

distribution was poorly known) were also
defined, referred to here as regional Var. AT (Figure 6-65) of Poynor Engraved. These
varieties feature a diverse range and
combination of stylistic elements, principal
among them nested triangles, nested ovals,
and nested circles; scrolls of various sorts;
hatched pendant, stacked, and nested
triangles; cross-hatched ladders and panels;
hooked arms; concentric ovals; and sets of
diagonal lines with small pendant triangles.
The most common regional varieties of
Poynor Engraved are var. F (nested
ovals/triangles and diagonal cross-hatched
ladders, also local variety 1 at the Lang
Pasture site), var. E (scroll and circle), and
var. B (interlocking scrolls) (see Figure 6­
65. Var. F vessels have also been reported
from sites in the upper Sabine River that
date to the 14th century, including 41WD518
and the Carlisle site (41WD46, see Perttula
et al. 1993), indicating a wider and perhaps
earlier distribution to some of these more
unique Poynor Engraved styles.3 The other
regional varieties are represented by vessels
from no more than 1-5 sites.
Of significance in this discussion is that
57.2% of the Poynor Engraved vessels at the
Lang Pasture site can be assigned to one of
these regional varieties; the other 42.8% are
specific local varieties of Poynor Engraved
seen only at Lang Pasture and one or two
other sites in the region. In the broader
upper Neches River basin mortuary vessel
assemblages, these numerous regional
varieties—probably representing the product
of the work of specific artisans (cf. Read
2007:91)—are most abundant in pre-A.D.
1480 or Frankston phase sub-phase 1
contexts (61.1%), with a significant drop off
in ca. A.D. 1480-1560 (11.7%) and ca. A.D.
1560-1650 (19.9%) mortuary contexts. This
suggests that prior to A.D. 1480, and

268

reaching back into the early to mid-14th
century A.D. when the Lang Pasture site
was occupied and distinctive fine ware
styles were beginning to be created, the
favoring of stylistic innovations and the
individual work of specific artisans, were
what led to the wide diversity in Poynor
Engraved rim motif styles at that time.
Innovations and unique artistic expressions
began to diminish in favor of stylistic
conformity around a certain few rim panel
motifs. Although specific archeological and
chemical compositional data are not
currently available to address the issue, I
suspect that after ca. A.D. 1480, specific
distinct styles/varieties of Poynor Engraved
were not made in each Caddo settlement or
community, but instead each style was made
by a certain number of artisans living in
specific parts of the upper Neches River
basin, and the products were then traded and
exchanged
throughout
the
region.
Examining the near-identical manufacture
and decorative style of many of these
Poynor Engraved vessels (see Appendix
F.4), it is hard to escape the conclusion that
a number of them may have been made by
the same potter. Either that, or there was a
near perfect transmission of information
between potters in different communities
about certain Poynor Engraved vessel form
and decorative styles, which seems
improbable given the likelihood of copying
errors if many individuals were making
these kinds of pottery (cf. Eerkens and Lip
2005, 2007).
There are several defined varieties of Patton
Engraved and Hume Engraved (Figure 6­
66); none occur at the Lang Pasture site.
Seriation analysis of mortuary vessels (see
below) suggest that neither pottery type
began to be made until after ca. A.D. 1480
(in the case of Hume Engraved) or after ca.
A.D. 1560 (in the case of Patton Engraved).

on several Poynor Engraved regional
varieties (see Figure 6-65); (c) broad
horizontal lines on the rim and semi-circular

circle elements on the vessel body (Patton
Engraved, var. Freeman, Shafer’s [1968]
Patton Engraved, Var. A, although he also
includes Poynor Engraved, var. Freeman
vessels within this variety of Patton
Engraved).
Hume Engraved vessels are distinctive
elongated bottles with short necks (see
Figure 6-27a-b). The engraved decorations
are a series of vertical panels (usually four)
that run from the base of the bottle neck to
near the base of the vessel (see Figure 6-66e,
g). These panels are commonly filled with
cross-hatched lines, but there are examples

Technical Report No. 174202

Archeological Investigations at the Lang Pasture Site (41AN38) in the Upper Neches River Basin of East Texas
Texas Department of Transportation

where the panels are filled with diagonal or
horizontal hatched lines, or some
combination of cross-hatched and hatched
panels (see Suhm and Krieger 1954:306).
Hume Engraved, var. Hume (see Figure 6­
66e) has sets of cross-hatched vertical
panels. Another variety, still unnamed, but
present in some numbers at the Jim P. Allen
site (41CE12), has cross-hatched vertical
panels with a row of hatched pendant
triangles along a single horizontal engraved
line at the body-neck juncture (see Figure 6­
66g). A slightly different version of this
stylistic motif has been documented at the
Mrs. J. M. Cook site (41AN1), where in
addition to the cross-hatched vertical panels
and the hatched pendant triangles along the
body-neck juncture, there are additional
hatched pendant triangles on the vertical
panels themselves. Another unspecified
Hume Engraved variety includes two
elongated bottles at the J. W. Blackburn site
(41CE4) with horizontal engraved lines at
the body-neck juncture along with a
downward-pointing row of small pendant
triangles; there are no vertical panels on
these bottles. Lastly, this same motif of
horizontal lines and pendant triangles
(hatched in this case)—but no vertical
panels—occurs on several bowls from
41SM77 and the Richard Patton site
(41AN26): I have dubbed this Hume
Engraved, var. Allen (see Figure 6-66f).
Hood Engraved effigy vessels are
concentrated in post-A.D. 1400 Caddo sites
in several parts of the upper Neches River
basin (Figure 6-67); no effigy vessels are
present at the Lang Pasture site. Seriation
analysis suggests that effigy vessels began to
be made ca. A.D. 1400, they were most
popular as mortuary offerings between ca.
A.D. 1400-1480, and then they continued to
be made and used through the Allen phase.
The three varieties, with Hood Engraved,

Technical Report No. 174202

var. Hood being the most common effigy
vessel style, defined here include:


Hood Engraved, var. Hood: this
variety has an effigy head
(usually a bird or duck) and
tabtails, and broad horizontal
engraved lines (usually three
lines) on the rim;



Hood Engraved, var. Cook:
these vessels have both an
effigy head and tabtails, but in
addition to a set of broad
horizontal engraved lines, there
are also hatched pendant
triangle engraved elements;



Hood Engraved, var. Allen: this
variety has an effigy head, tab
tails, and a zoomorphic or
anthropomorphic tail rider; the
bowl rim has broad horizontal
engraved lines. Similar kinds of
shell-tempered tail-rider effigies
are found in Late Mississippian
sites in the St. Francis and
Memphis areas of the lower
Mississippi valley (LMV);
Phillips et al. (1951:169)
suggested that this effigy vessel
form was diffused to the Caddo
area from the LMV, but this
now seems unlikely.

Hood Engraved, var. Hood vessels are
widely distributed in this region, occurring
in burial and domestic contexts at a number
of sites. Hood Engraved, var. Allen effigy
vessels, however, are more concentrated in
late Frankston and Allen phase settlements
and cemeteries in the Caddo and Flat Creek
areas and in the Neches River valley itself
(see Figure 6-67)

This latter area probably marks part, if not
all, of the territory of a group of early
historic Caddo peoples that were living here
into the early part of the 18th century.

were interred also had a relatively low
percentage of brushed pottery in domestic
contexts.

Decorative Elements in the Utility Wares

Comparison of Vessel Form, Size,
Temper, and Firing Conditions

Utility ware vessels are not particularly
common mortuary offerings, as engraved
fine wares were clearly preferred as grave
accompaniments by the Caddo living in the
upper Neches River basin. At the Lang
Pasture site, only 9.7% of the funerary
vessels were utility wares (see Appendix
F.5). In the ceramic vessel data base for the
region, numbering 601 vessels (see
Appendix F.5), decorated utility wares
account for only 14.8% of the mortuary
vessels. Despite the limited number of utility
wares (n=38) in the sample of vessels
subjected to detailed analysis (see Appendix
F.4), the diversity in decorative methods is
considerable.
At the Lang Pasture site, the utility wares
from mortuary contexts include one
Killough Pinched bowl and two Maydelle
Incised jars (see above). In the other upper
Neches River basin sites, Killough Pinched
jars are present only in sub-phase 2
Frankston phase contexts at the Mrs. J. M.
Cook, J. W. Blackburn, and Omer and Otis
Hood sites. Maydelle Incised vess
els
are predominant in ca. A.D. 1400-1480
contexts (42.9% of the utility wares),
diminishing in later burials. What stands out
among the utility wares in the apparently
later Frankston phase burials in the upper
Neches is the frequency of vessels with
brushed decorations: 36.8% of all the utility
ware vessels (not including two Maydelle
Incised vessels with brushed vessel bodies)
in burials are brushed, either on the body
(with neck banded, punctated, pinched, or
incised-punctated decorations on the rim,
n=6 vessels) or brushed on both the rim and
body (n=8). None of the Lang Pasture
burials have brushed utility wares, and the

Comparisons between the mortuary vessel
assemblages from a number of upper Neches
River basin cemetery sites illustrate two
notable things: (1) the mortuary vessels from
the 14th century to early 15th century A.D.
Lang Pasture site are distinctive from the
other cemeteries with respect to the relative
proportions of the vessel forms that are
represented, as well as their size ranges, the
tempers that were added to the clay paste,
and how the vessels were fired; and (2) the
vessels from post-A.D. 1400 Frankston
phase sites in the vicinity of Lang Pasture
(see Figure 6-1) are more similar to each
other than any one assemblage of mortuary
vessels are to the Lang Pasture vessel
assemblage.
These
differences
are
apparently manifestations of important
technological changes in the manufacture of
Caddo mortuary vessels that occurred
around the beginning of the 15th century.
For the purposes of comparison, the vessels
from upper Neches cemeteries fall into five
basic vessel forms, and with a number of
distinctive sub-forms (see Figure 6-26). In
the Lang Pasture vessel assemblage, bowls
are the most common form (Table 6-31),

followed by carinated bowls. In later
sub-phase 1 to sub-phase 3 assemblages,
carinated bowls are by far the most
abundant mortuary offering, accounting for
48.5-62.7% of all the vessels; this relative
proportion peaks during the late Frankston
phase (Table 6-31), and likely continues in
the Allen phase given the common
occurrence of Patton Engraved carinated
bowls in graves (see Kleinschmidt 1982;
Perttula 2007b).

Bowls are really only abundant at the Lang
Pasture site and the E. W. Henry site, a subphase 1 Frankston phase cemetery; their
proportions decrease through the span of the
Frankston phase. Short-necked Hume
Engraved, Hume Plain, and Poynor
Engraved forms and Fair Plain are more
common bottle forms from ca. A.D. 1480
on; no short-necked bottles were recovered
in the Lang Pasture cemetery. Bottles in
general increase in frequency as mortuary
offerings after ca. A.D. 1480 as well (see
Table 6-31).
Utility ware jars are not particularly
common in any of these upper Neches
Caddo cemeteries, except perhaps in subphase 2 times (ca. A.D. 1480-1560).
Compound bowls are a distinctive vessel
offering at the Lang Pasture site (see Table
6-31), while otherwise rarely seen in the
upper Neches.

274

Mortuary vessels in upper Neches River
Caddo sites were made in a wide variety of
sizes. Surely these vessels held liquids and
foodstuffs for the deceased to use on the
journey to the House of Death. In most
cases, the vessels included with the deceased
by his living relatives easily would have
held multiple servings of food and liquids
(perhaps enough to last for the 6 day
journey, see Chapter 11, this volume).
Nevertheless, the very large size of some of
the carinated bowls (food serving vessels)
from the Omer and Otis Hood, J. M. Cook,
J. W. Blackburn, and Fred McKee sites—all
post-A.D. 1480 Caddo cemeteries—which
would have been well-suited for communal
food serving, suggests that the vessels may
have been intended by the Caddo to serve
multiple purposes in mortuary rituals. These
could have included use of the vessels in
grave-side rituals and daily food offerings
by the relatives of the deceased, after which
they were placed in the graves as final
accompaniment once the “Sixth Day Feast”

Technical Report No. 174202

Archeological Investigations at the Lang Pasture Site (41AN38) in the Upper Neches River Basin of East Texas
Texas Department of Transportation

had been concluded (see Gonzalez et al.
2005:57-58). These grave-side practices and
changes in mortuary rituals seem to have
begun around ca. A.D. 1480. Pre-A.D. 1480
cemeteries in the upper Neches, including
Lang Pasture and E. W. Henry, typically
have only a range of small to medium-sized
vessels (see Figures 6-34 and 6-59),
probably destined for individual use.
Carinated bowls fall into miniature, small to
medium-sized, large to very large, and extra
large sizes (Figure 6-68a), based on
overlapping measurements of orifice
diameter and estimated volume. The Lang
Pasture carinated bowls are small and
medium-sized only.
Bowls may be divided into two groups, a
small size (<12 cm in orifice diameter and
<1 liter in volume) and a medium to large
size (see Figure 6-68b). The Lang Pasture
bowls from the burials fall in both size
categories.
Lang Pasture jars are small to medium-sized
(see Figure 6-68c). In other upper Neches
River basin mortuary vessel assemblages,
there are also miniature jars (at the J. W.
Blackburn and E. W. Henry sites), large jars
(at the Omer and Otis Hood, E. W. Henry,
and Fred McKee sites), and very large jars at
the Omer and Otis Hood site (see Figure 6­
68c).

Technical Report No. 174202

Large amounts of food stuffs, enough for at
least 10 servings, could have been held in
these vessels.
Bottles in these Caddo sites tend to have
minimal differences in volume, ranging
from 0.2-1.2 liters (see Figure 6-68d).
However, with the appearance of elongated
body/short-necked Hume Engraved and
Hume Plain vessels in post-A.D. 1480
contexts, the volume of bottles to hold
liquids increased substantially. This trend
for increased vessel size and volume after
ca. A.D. 1480 is in step with volume size
trends seen in the carinated bowls and jars.
As with upper Neches River basin Caddo
ceramics in general, the mortuary vessels
from the region were predominantly
tempered with grog, regardless of the
Frankston phase sub-phase to which the
vessels can be assigned. Grog is commonly
the sole tempering inclusion, but more often
than not, was the principal temper in
conjunction with smaller amounts of
crushed and burned bone and crushed and
angular hematite/ferruginous sandstone
pieces (Table 6-32). Less than 7% of the
vessels from any of the sites—with the
exception of the Lang Pasture site—are
tempered solely with aplastics other than
grog.

The lowest frequency of grog temper
(73.4%) in upper Neches River basin
mortuary vessel assemblages is the group of
vessels from the Lang Pasture site. In the
other sites, which all postdate A.D. 1400,
grog is found in 93.7-100% of the vessels,
affirming the predominant practice of
employing grog or crushed sherds/fired clay
in the manufacture of pottery vessels.
The use of bone temper is very common at
the Lang Pasture site (see Table 6-32),
matched only by the vessels at the J. W.
Blackburn (41CE4) and R. J. Fair (41CE25)
sites. Both of these sites date to post-A.D.
1480-1560 contexts, and thus it is apparent
that bone temper was a popular temper
inclusion used throughout the Frankston
phase for vessels placed in burials. Overall,
the frequency of bone-tempered pottery in
the mortuary vessels ranges from 11.7­
52.2%. By comparison, sherds from
domestic contexts at a number of these sites
(see below), including the Lang Pasture site,
are much less likely to have been tempered

Technical Report No. 174202

with bone. For instance, at Lang Pasture,
between 8.9-20.5% of the sherds by site area
were tempered with bone, less than half the
amount identified in the mortuary vessels.
Sherd samples from other upper Neches
River sites (see below) tend to have less than
5%
bone-tempered
sherds
in
the
assemblages, irrespective of their ages.
Because of these dramatic temper
differences in domestic vs. mortuary
ceramics, vessels placed in mortuary
contexts may thus have been made by
individual potters solely to accompany the
deceased rather than to conform to domestic
preferences.
These same differences are apparent in the
use of hematite temper in the mortuary
vessels. Except for the Lang Pasture site, no
less than 33% of the vessels (from the Mrs.
J. M. Cook site, 41AN1) from any one
cemetery—and as much as 86.9% of the
vessels (from the Fred McKee site,
41AN32)—had hematite inclusions in the
paste (see Table 6-32). The sites with the

277

Chapter 6: Ceramic Artifacts from the Lang Pasture Site (41AN38) and the Place of the Site Within an
Upper Neches River Basin Caddo Ceramic Tradtion

highest proportion of ceramics with hematite
tempering are post-A.D. 1480 Caddo
cemeteries. The lowest frequencies are in
vessels from pre-A.D. 1480 sub-phase 1
Frankston phase cemeteries (see Table 6­
32).
These figures for hematite-tempered pottery
represent very substantial use of hematite in
upper Neches River Caddo mortuary
ceramic contexts, this temper being much
less common in domestic vessel sherds
where detailed temper analysis has been
completed (Shawn Marceaux, March 2008
personal communication). At the Lang
Pasture site, however, the use of hematite in
vessel sherds from domestic contexts (17.8­
31.4%) is comparable to that seen in the
mortuary vessels; the Henry Lake
(41CE324) ceramic sherds from domestic
contexts include 22% with hematite temper
(see Perttula and Middlebrook 2009).
No more than 22% of the vessels from any
of the upper Neches River ceramic mortuary
assemblages were made using a sandy paste
(see Table 6-32). At the Lang Pasture site,
between 23-29% of the sherds from
domestic contexts came from vessels with a
sandy paste (see Table 6-25), compared to
only 6.7% of the mortuary vessels. Solely on
this basis, non-sandy clays were preferred
for mortuary vessel manufacture, again
highlighting the possibility that mortuary
vessels were made in a distinctly different
technological manner (or by a different
potter than the ones that made vessels for
domestic consumption) than vessels that
were designed to be used by Caddo families
for domestic activities.
The mortuary vessels from the Lang Pasture
site were fired almost exclusively in a low
oxygen or reducing environment (Table 6­
33). This was also the case with the sherds

278

from vessels used and discarded in domestic
contexts at the site (see Table 6-27). Not so
with the post-A.D. 1400 Frankston phase
mortuary ceramics.
After ca. A.D. 1400, mortuary ceramics
were very commonly fired in a high oxygen
environment, or were incompletely oxidized.
By site, these two methods of firing
comprise between 46.7-84.6% of all the
vessels in the post-A.D. 1400 detailed
analysis sample (see Table 6-33), very much
different than the Lang Pasture vessels.
As a consequence of differences in firing,
many of the vessels found in Caddo
mortuary contexts have a reddish to reddishbrown color because of high oxygen firing,
rather than the darker gray, grayish-brown,
or black colors that would have resulted
from firing in a reducing environment.
However, firing vessels in a reducing
environment, but cooling them in the open
air—as was done earlier at the Lang Pasture
site—would have had a similar effect, at
least in terms of the color of the fired pots,
since the open air cooling would leave a thin
oxidized interior and/or exterior surface.
Technologically, if the goal was to produce
a vessel of a certain color and durability, it
made more sense to fire the pot red-hot in an
oxidizing fire, as the Frankston phase Caddo
potters did, and thus be able to see when a
pottery vessel was done and could be
removed from that fire, then it was to gauge
the right time to remove a pot from a firing
when it was smothered in a bed of coals and
ashes. This technological change or firing
preference appears to have become part of
the upper Neches River ceramic tradition—
at least with respect to the manufacture of
mortuary vessels—after ca. A.D. 1480 to
A.D. 1560, during sub-phases 2 and 3 of the
Frankston phase.

Use of Pigments on Vessels
Of the group of eight sites with vessels
discussed above, the lowest percentage of
mortuary fine ware vessels with pigment
include the J. M. Cook (5.9% of the vessels
have pigment rubbed into the engraved
lines), Lang Pasture (6.5%), and Omer and
Otis Hood, cemetery #2 (8.3%), sites.
Conversely, the highest use of pigment on
mortuary vessels is apparent at the E. W.
Henry (28.6%), Fred McKee (21.7%), and J.
W. Blackburn (20.8%) sites. Pigments were
used on carinated bowls, bowls, effigy
bowls, and bottles, with the highest
frequency of pigment use documented
among the bottles from all the sites (29.5%)
as well as the carinated bowls (18.9%). The
percentage of fine ware vessels with
pigment in mortuary contexts from the Lang
Pasture site (6.5%) is little different—at
5.8%-10.6% by area—than that documented
in vessel sherds found in the southern and
northern site area domestic contexts (see
Table 6-16). This suggests that vessels
embellished with a clay pigment (in this
case, almost invariably a red clay pigment)
were used with the same regularity in both
domestic and mortuary contexts.
Both red and white clay pigments were used
on the upper Neches mortuary vessels. Red
pigments were exclusively used on a few
bowls and effigy bowls (9.3% of these

Technical Report No. 174202

vessels had a pigment), and almost
exclusively on bottles (89% of the bottles
had a red pigment in the engraved lines).
Among the carinated bowls, almost 27% had
a white clay pigment (with the remainder
having a red pigment), particularly the
carinated bowls from post-ca. A.D. 1560
Frankston phase cemeteries at the Fred
McKee (50%) and R. J. Fair (100%) sites.
There is a temporal trend in the use by the
Caddo of clay pigments on mortuary vessels
(Table 6-34), even though the proportion of
pigment use remains very consistent (16.4­
16.7%) from the early (sub-phase 1) to the
late (sub-phase 3) Frankston phase. Red clay
pigment was almost exclusively preferred on
mortuary vessels up to ca. A.D. 1560 (ca.
92.5% of the vessels have a red clay
pigment), but began to be supplanted by a
white clay pigment after that time. In subphase 2 contexts, 11% of the vessels have a
white clay pigment, and this increases to
63.6% in sub-phase 3 times. Six of the seven
vessels in sub-phase 3 contexts with white
clay pigment are carinated bowls; 67% of
the three vessels in sub-phase 2 burials are
on carinated bowls.
This alternating preference for either red or
white clay pigments has a resonance that
extends beyond simple differences in
pigment choice. Lankford (1992) discusses
the importance of the use of these two colors

279

Chapter 6: Ceramic Artifacts from the Lang Pasture Site (41AN38) and the Place of the Site Within an
Upper Neches River Basin Caddo Ceramic Tradtion

in social, political, and cosmological
dualisms or divisions in Southeastern North
American societies, and it is likely that
similar dualisms characterized prehistoric
Caddo groups living in the upper Neches. In
the context of the use of different colors of
pigments in mortuary rituals, Lankford’s
(1992:76-77) suggestion that the two colors
symbolize the Lower world of change (red)
and the Upper world of order (white) seems
apt. It is probable as a means by which to
explain the symbolic meaning and use of
different pigments on mortuary vessels that
cosmological and world views of the Caddo
peoples living in the upper Neches began to
change after ca. A.D. 1480 (in sub-phase 2),
but came to dominate beliefs and mortuary

ritual usage after ca. A.D. 1560 and
continuing into the Allen phase (i.e., when
Patton Engraved vessels have pigments
rubbed in the design, it is almost always
white4).
Trends and Varieties in Late Caddo and
Historic Caddo Fine Ware Pottery Types
in the Upper Neches River Basin
One of the goals of recent archeological
research in the upper Neches River valley in
East Texas is to better understand the
temporal and stylistic character of the postA.D. 1400/1450 Frankston and Allen phase
Caddo ceramic assemblages found in this
area.

From this will hopefully arise a better
understanding of the settlement history of
Caddo peoples living here, and illuminate
the affiliation and occupational history of
the Caddo groups that settled the Lang
Pasture site.
This research has involved, as discussed
above, a detailed examination of 277 vessels
from burials on seven sites in the collections
at the Texas Archeological Research
Laboratory (TARL) and 31 vessels from
burials at the Lang Pasture site (Perttula et
al. 2007), as well as a review of other vessel
data (n=323 vessels) from several other sites
and diverse collections, both at TARL, in
private collections, and in archeological
excavations
(see
Campbell
1936;

280

Kleinschmidt 1982; Perttula 2006; Shafer
1981). In total, including the vessels from
the Lang Pasture site, I have compiled a data
base of 630 vessels from 35 different sites in
Anderson, Cherokee, Henderson, and Smith
counties, Texas (Table 6-35, see also
Appendix F.5).
The basic composition of these Caddo vessel
assemblage from upper Neches River burial
sites includes fine wares (73.3%), decorated
utility wares (14.9%), and a significant
proportion of plain ware vessels (11.8%)
(see Table 6-35). As previously mentioned,
the Lang Pasture mortuary vessels are
dominated by plain wares (61.3%), with a
much lower proportion of engraved or red-

Archeological Investigations at the Lang Pasture Site (41AN38) in the Upper Neches River Basin of East Texas

slipped fine wares (25.8%) placed as
funerary offerings in the graves.
The principal fine wares in all these
cemeteries are Poynor Engraved bowls and
carinated bowls (n=229, 49.6% of the fine
wares), followed by Poynor Engraved
bottles of various forms (n=42, 9.1%),
Patton Engraved (n=63, 13.4%), Hood
Engraved (n=56, 12.1%) effigy ware
vessels, and Hume Engraved bottles (n=54,
11.7%). Among the utility wares, the major
types include Bullard Brushed (n=21),
Killough Pinched (n=20), Maydelle Incised
(n=11), punctated jars (n=9), and brushed­
punctated jars (n=8). Most of the plain
wares are simple bowls (n=29), carinated
bowls (n=23), and several forms of bottles
(n=16). At the Lang Pasture site, the
identified types in the mortuary vessel
assemblage include Poynor Engraved (n=7)
carinated bowls, compound bowls, and a
bottle, Maydelle Incised (n=2), and Killough
Pinched (n=1), indicating a broad stylistic
affiliation and temporal congruity between
this cemetery and other excavated Caddo
cemeteries in the upper Neches.
For this part of the chapter, I have focused in
detail on the fine wares from the ceramic
vessel data base, primarily because they are
ubiquitous on upper Neches River Caddo
sites (they account for 73% of all the whole
vessels in the burials) and because the
stylistic diversity in the fine wares is
amenable to a more refined consideration of
stylistic and temporal changes in these
ceramic assemblages, and the chronological
and cultural place of the Lang Pasture site.
This pursuit includes the recognition of
distinct stylistic motifs and elements in the
fine wares; the identification of varieties of
the fine ware types, especially Poynor
Engraved, that have spatial distributions and
an adequate site representation (see Figures
6-63 and 6-64); and now the examination of
the temporal implications of these varieties.
Previous vessel and sherd seriation analyses
(Shafer 1968; Kleinschmidt 1982; Perttula
2007b) have already established that Patton

Technical Report No. 174202

Engraved is the youngest of the fine ware
types in the upper Neches River, with Hume
Engraved, Hood Engraved, and Poynor
Engraved having begun to be made around
ca. A.D. 1400 or so. Hume Engraved is most
common apparently in post-A.D. 1650 Allen
phase contexts, while Poynor Engraved is
primarily a Frankston phase (ca. A.D. 1400­
1650) type, with a stylistic tradition that
extends back some amount of time before
A.D. 1400 (as at the Lang Pasture site and
other sites in the upper Neches) and is also
found on Caddo sites in the upper Neches
that date after ca. A.D. 1650.
Kleinschmidt (1982) reviewed sherd and
vessel collections from a number of
Frankston phase (ca. A.D. 1400-1650) and
Allen phase (ca. A.D. 1650-1800+) sites in
the upper Neches River basin (Anderson,
Cherokee, Henderson, and Smith counties)
and developed a ceramic frequency seriation
(see O’Brien and Lyman 1999) of those sites
more than 25 years ago (Kleinschmidt 1982:
Table 19). That seriation is still useful today,
or at least I find it so, because it does seem
to provide a good broad measure of the
temporal changes in the kinds of decorated
ceramic vessels used by these Caddo
peoples (or at least used in mortuary rituals),
as well as a good measure of the direction of
changes in ceramic decorative styles.
To review Kleinschmidt’s (1982) work, I
first focus on temporal changes in the
engraved fine ware vessels as seen in that
seriation. The fine wares in question are
Poynor Engraved (PO), Patton Engraved,
Hume Engraved, and a variety of Poynor
Engraved (PP) that shared stylistic elements
with Patton Engraved vessels (Kleinschmidt
1982:Figures 19 and 20). In broad strokes,
Kleinschmidt (1982) recognized three subphases of the Frankston phase, beginning
with sub-phase 1 at ca. A.D. 1400 and
ending with sub-phase 3, followed by the
Allen phase (Table 6-36). In the earliest part
of the Frankston phase, Poynor Engraved
(PO variety) is the exclusive fine ware
ceramic. Through time, the PP variety of

281

Chapter 6: Ceramic Artifacts from the Lang Pasture Site (41AN38) and the Place of the Site Within an
Upper Neches River Basin Caddo Ceramic Tradtion

Poynor Engraved, Patton Engraved, and
Hume Engraved make their appearance and
become more popular, at the expense of the
PO variety of Poynor Engraved.

During the later Allen phase, both varieties
of Poynor Engraved account for only 27.7%
of the vessels in the seriation. There is a
dramatic increase in the popularity of Patton
Engraved fine wares—59%--almost a three­
fold increase from sub-phase 3 times.
Kleinschmidt’s seriation further indicates
that Hume Engraved vessels also appear to
become more common from the time of the
Frankston phase to the post-A.D. 1650 Allen
phase (see Table 6-36).

By the end of the Frankston phase (sub­
phase 3), the PO variety of Poynor Engraved
only accounts for 46% of the engraved fine
wares, with considerable numbers of Poynor
Engraved (PP variety), Patton Engraved, and
Hume Engraved vessels (see Table 6-36).
Nevertheless, during all three sub-phases of
the Frankston phase, Poynor Engraved
vessels account for between 70.2-100% of
the total number of sub-phase vessels.

It is possible to refine the seriation proposed
by Kleinschmidt (1982) by focusing in detail
on the variation in the style of the engraved
rim motifs on the many Poynor Engraved
vessels found in the upper Neches, as it is
likely that many engraved styles were used
by only a few potters in the community
and/or were preferred decorations for only a
short period of time. Although I have
recognized at least 30 Poynor Engraved
bowl and carinated bowl rim stylistic
motifs—including several from the Lang
Pasture site that may be amongst the earliest

Technical Report No. 174202

motifs seen on this fine ware—five new
varieties represent more than 73% of the
Poynor Engraved vessels in the upper
Neches River basin. These include varieties
Blackburn, Cook, Freeman, Hood, and Lang
(see Figure 6-64); var. Hood is the most
common (see Figure 6-63e) in the upper
Neches River vessel sample, accounting for
29.3% of the Poynor Engraved vessels. Next
is Poynor Engraved, var. Cook (15.7%) and
var. Blackburn (12.6%), then var. Freeman
(9.1%) and var. Lang (6.6%) (see Figure 6­
64).

Chapter 6: Ceramic Artifacts from the Lang Pasture Site (41AN38) and the Place of the Site Within an
Upper Neches River Basin Caddo Ceramic Tradtion

Some progress has been made in discerning
temporal changes in the fine ware varieties
beyond the basic distinction between the
earlier Poynor Engraved varieties and the
later Patton Engraved varieties. The
frequency seriation (see Dunnell 1970:308­
310; O’Brien and Lyman 1999:109-132;
Lyman and O’Brien 2006)
of the
proportions of the different engraved fine
ware types and varieties in upper Neches
River basin Caddo cemeteries is an
appropriate method for inferring the cultural
relationship between sites and specific
ceramic types and varieties found on those
sites because they meet the following
conditions necessary for the successful
application of the frequency seriation
method: “all the groups included in a
seriation
must
be
of
comparable
duration…all the groups in a seriation must
belong to the same cultural tradition…[and]
all groups in a seriation must come from the
same local area” (Dunnell 1970:312-313).
Each of these sites and cemeteries were used
for short periods of time, based on the
number of interments; a number of stylistic,
functional, and technological attributes of
the fine wares, utility wares, and plain wares
indicate that they are from the same Caddo
cultural tradition; and all of the sites
considered here occur in a ca. 1700 km2
area around the Lang Pasture site (see
Figure 6-67).
Our findings are that, firstly, based on a
frequency seriation of different decorative
motifs on Poynor Engraved vessels from the
seven cemeteries discussed above, the
earliest sub-phase 1 varieties are var. Cook,
var. Blackburn, and var. Hood, as well as
regional varieties A-B, F, I-L, and S (Table
6-37). Most of these regional varieties are

284

found only in sub-phase 1 contexts. None of
the defined varieties of Poynor Engraved are
present at the Lang Pasture site, but regional
varieties B, F, and K are, but in higher
proportions at the latter site (Table 6-37).
These differing proportions, and the absence
of the defined varieties, suggest two things:
(a) that the Lang Pasture cemetery—or at
least some portion of it—predates the onset
of sub-phase 1 of the Frankston phase, and
(b) that a number of more stylistically
unique varieties of Poynor Engraved had
begun to be made in the upper Neches (as
well as in the upper Sabine) sometime prior
to ca. A. D. 1400.
Secondly, two of these early varieties of
Poynor Engraved (var. F and J) continued to
be made in sub-phase 2 times, but in lesser
amounts than previously (see Table 6-37).
Instead, a number of other regional varieties
of Poynor Engraved make their appearance
in sub-phase 2 burials, namely var. C-E, Q,
and R (see Table 6-37). Four of these
regional stylistic varieties of Poynor
Engraved were made only in sub-phase 2,
but var. E became more common in later
sub-phase 3 burials. Among the defined
varieties of Poynor Engraved, a new variety
(var. Lang) makes its first appearance in
sub-phase 2 burials; this variety, however,
was popular only during sub-phase 2. Var.
Hood, Cook, and Blackburn of Poynor
Engraved comprise 75.8% of the sub-phase
2 Poynor Engraved vessels (but only 38.9%
of the sub-phase 1 Poynor Engraved
vessels),
each
variety
increasing
monotonically in proportion from sub-phase
1 to sub-phase 2 times, and then decreasing
in frequency (43.4%) in sub-phase 3 burials
(see Table 6-37).

Thirdly, Poynor Engraved, var. Freeman
appears to be the latest variety of the Poynor
Engraved type, as it makes its appearance in
sub-phase 3 of the Frankston phase, where it
is the dominant defined variety (see Table 6­
37). Regional varieties N, P, and T are also
present only in sub-phase 3 burials, where
they account for 10% of the Poynor
Engraved mortuary vessels. This variety of
Poynor appears to have developed from the
earlier (but still in use in sub-phase 3 times)
Poynor Engraved, var. Hood, because they
both have hour glass-shaped panel dividers
(see Figure 6-63e, h)—none of the other
varieties do. What separates var. Hood from
var. Freeman are the pendant triangles on
the upper and lower parts of the engraved
rim panel of the latter.
Lastly, and importantly, in the case of
Poynor Engraved, var. Freeman, the simple
stylistic decision to add concentric circles
and hooked arm elements on the body (see
Figure 6-63i) of carinated bowls on this
variety, and then the addition of ticked
marks to concentric circles on the vessel
body (see Figure 6-65c), suggests a clear
and not temporally lengthy stylistic link
between Poynor Engraved, var. Freeman
and Patton Engraved, var. Freeman, and an
obvious stylistic and cultural connection
between Caddo peoples that archeologists
call the Frankston and Allen phases.
This stylistic relationship of concentric
circle and hooked arm elements on vessel
bodies, embellished by the later addition of
ticks on those elements, further suggests that
Patton Engraved, var. Freeman is the
earliest of the defined Patton Engraved
varieties. This variety of Patton Engraved is
the dominant one (39.3%) at the Richard
Patton site (41AN26), along with var.
Patton (28.6%), var. Fair (14.3%), and var.
Allen (14.3%). Based on lower proportions
of var. Freeman and var. Patton at the Jim
Allen site (41CE12), but higher proportions
of var. Allen (41.2%) and several still
unspecified varieties, it is suspected that var.

286

Allen is a later (and perhaps the latest?)
Patton Engraved variety.
Hood Engraved, var. Hood and var. Cook
are the earlier effigy forms in the upper
Neches (see Table 6-37). Hood Engraved,
var. Allen is found in association with Patton
Engraved, and is apparently an Allen phase
diagnostic, although one burial at the
Frankston phase sub-phase 2 Mrs. J. M.
Cook site had one of these vessels. This
effigy vessel form includes zoomorphic or
anthropomorphic tail riders. The other
varieties of Hood Engraved have effigy
heads and tab tails—as well as horizontal
engraved lines as the main rim/body
decoration, with var. Cook also having
engraved pendant triangle elements—and
are found in Frankston phase temporal
contexts.
Hume Engraved, var. Allen and var. Hume
are found primarily in Allen phase contexts
or later (i.e., dating after ca. A.D. 1480)
Frankston phase contexts. Hume Engraved
bottles are absent from sub-phase 1 burials
in the upper Neches (see Table 6-37); no
Hume Engraved vessels were in any of the
Lang Pasture burials.

INTRA-REGIONAL
COMPARISONS

Sherd Assemblages
Although there are problems with the
presentation of the decorated sherds from
the Caddo sites and midden deposits
excavated at Lake Palestine (Anderson et al.
1974)—as I will discuss momentarily—the
sherd assemblages from these sites are
substantial.
They do provide useful
information on the character of the
decorated vessels found on domestic Caddo
sites in the upper Neches River basin, on
sites not far from the Lang Pasture site (see
Figure 6-1), and they also comprise
foundational sherd data bases anchoring one
proposed seriation of Caddo decorated sherd

Technical Report No. 174202

Archeological Investigations at the Lang Pasture Site (41AN38) in the Upper Neches River Basin of East Texas
Texas Department of Transportation

assemblages in the region (see Table 4-5,
and discussion below).
The decorated sherd data from the Lake
Palestine sites cannot be directly or
uniformly compared to the information
presented here from the Lang Pasture site, as
well as that presented from selected sites in
the collections at TARL. They cannot be
compared directly because of the following
problems (see Anderson et al. 1974:10): (1)
many
different
decorative
methods
represented in the sherds (i.e., incised­
punctated, incised, punctated, appliqued,
etc.) from these sites were combined into a
single
category
labeled
“wet-paste”
decoration; thus it is impossible to compare
the proportions of each of the different
decorative methods recognized at the Lang
Pasture site to these sites; (2) brushed body
sherds were kept separate from brushed
rims, the latter included in tabulations for
“wet-paste” sherds; (3) only [finger]nail
punctated sherds are explicitly quantified in
the Lake Palestine report; there is no
mention of either tool or cane punctated
sherds,
although
such
sherds
are
occasionally illustrated in the report; (4)
Anderson et al. (1974) employ an “Other”
category to deal with miscellaneous
decorated sherds as well as smaller sherds
lacking decoration, but no details are
presented on what kinds of decorated sherds
are included in this category; and (5) the use
of bone temper is not consistently specified
in Anderson et al. (1974), and in the case of
several sites, the percentage of sherds that
are bone-tempered cannot be determined.
Nevertheless, the Lake Palestine ceramic
assemblages, and those from nearby sites
that have been recently analyzed (41CE324,
see Perttula and Middlebrook 2009; and
41HE337 in the upper Caddo Creek basin,
Bill Young, April 2008, personal
communication), especially those that date
to Frankston phase times, share several
characteristics that make clear the character
of an upper Neches River basin Caddo
ceramic tradition that was in existence from

Technical Report No. 174202

ca. A.D. 1400 (if not earlier) to the late 17th
century (if not later). The decorated and
plain sherd assemblages from the following
Lake Palestine sites—Tomato Patch
(41HE185), Ferguson (41AN67), Woldert
(41HE80), Halbert (41AN70), Forest Drive
(41HE184), Debro (41CE86), and William
Sherman (41CE30)—are (1) almost
exclusively grog-tempered; bone-tempered
pottery comprises less than 3% of the
sherds, where that information is available;
(2) brushed utility ware pottery dominates
the decorated sherd assemblages, accounting
for between 49-80% of all the decorated
pottery (Figure 6-68 and Table 6-38); (3)
fine ware vessel sherds account for less than
10% of the decorated sherds; (4) wet paste
decorations on sherds are also more
abundant than fine wares, accounting for
between 10.3-42% of the decorated sherds,
by site; (5) fingernail punctated sherds are
rare (less than 3%) at each site; and (6) plain
to decorated sherd ratios (P/DR) range from
only 0.14-1.50, with most of the sites having
P/DR values less than 0.72. This indicates
that Lake Palestine Caddo sites did not have
many plain ware vessels.
Generally
speaking, the lower the P/DR value, the
higher the proportion of brushed sherds in
the Lake Palestine ceramic assemblages.
The engraved fine wares are Poynor
Engraved and Hood Engraved.
The majority of the Lake Palestine
Frankston phase ceramic assemblages
enumerated in Table 6-38 compare
favorably to the southern area at the Lang
Pasture site, particularly in the proportion of
brushed sherds, “wet paste” sherds, and the
relatively low frequency of engraved fine
wares (see Figure 6-68). Punctated sherds
(but including tool, cane, and fingernail) are
more abundant at Lang Pasture in this
component, but this comparison is equivocal
because of the quantification problems
already mentioned for the Lake Palestine
ceramic assemblages. In any event, it is not
untenable to suggest on the basis of the
proportions of decorated sherds that the
southern ceramic component/area at the

287

Chapter 6: Ceramic Artifacts from the Lang Pasture Site (41AN38) and the Place of the Site Within an
Upper Neches River Basin Caddo Ceramic Tradtion

Lang Pasture site is part of the same ca.
A.D. 1400+ Caddo ceramic tradition in this
part of the upper Neches River basin. Of the
different sites at Lake Palestine, the earliest
Frankston phase Tomato Patch ceramic
assemblage most closely resembles the
southern ceramic component/area at the
Lang Pasture site.
The northern ceramic component/area at the
Lang Pasture site stands apart from the Lake
Palestine sites in several basic respects (see
Figure 6-69). These include a much lower
relative frequency of brushed utility wares,
considerably more engraved fine wares, and
higher proportions of punctated utility
wares.
It is hard not to draw the
conclusion—principally because of the
lower frequency of brushed wares as well as
the just reviewed stylistic character of the
mortuary vessel assemblage—that the
northern ceramic component/area at the

Lang Pasture site is part of a Caddo
occupation that predates the Frankston phase
sites listed in Table 6-38 from Lake
Palestine as well as the southern ceramic
component/area. In several respects, the
northern ceramic component/area at the
Lang Pasture site resembles the ceramic
assemblage from the White Mule site
(41HE166) at Lake Palestine (Anderson et
al. 1974:55-57, 59) as well as 41HE139 near
Lake Palestine (Cliff et al. 2004). This
occupation is dominated by wet-paste
decorations on utility wares (63.6%, see
Table 6-38), rather than brushed utility
wares― as is also the case in the northern
ceramic component/area (53% wet paste vs.
20% brushed)— engraved fine wares are
well represented (15%), and fingernail
punctated decorated sherds are also
comparatively abundant at both White Mule
(3%) and Lang Pasture (4.7%).

What is also interesting about the White
Mule occupation is that Poynor Engraved
sherds are relatively abundant, at least based
on selected sherd illustrations (Anderson et
al. 1974:Figure 24a-d, f-i, l); the report
mentions that only five Poynor Engraved
sherds were identified in the assemblage
(Anderson et al. 1974:56), but it was the
most common identified fine ware at the
site, as it is in the northern ceramic
component/area at the Lang Pasture site.
Other identified types include Maydelle
Incised, Bullard Brushed, and Killough
Pinched; these same types are present in the
northern ceramic component/area.
Basic analyses of ceramic styles/decorative
elements and technology (i.e., the use of
grog and bone-tempered pottery vessels)
were also completed on available sherd
assemblages at TARL from domestic
habitation contexts at other prehistoric
Caddo sites near to the Lang Pasture site
(see Figure 6-1), including Mrs. J. M. Cook
(41AN1), J. M. Cook Farm (41AN2), L.
Cecil (41AN8), Isibel-Gene Donnell

(41AN14), Rose Daniels (41AN23), Fred
McKee (41AN32), Solon Stanley (41CE3),
J. W. Blackburn (41CE4), J. M. Snow
(41CE8), and E. W. Henry (41CE17). These
assemblages are rather small, as they were
obtained from only limited investigations by
The University of Texas at Austin (UT)
during their more concerted work at Caddo
cemetery sites; in each instance, habitation
debris was noted in general proximity to
these cemeteries, and limited excavations as
well as surface collections of sherds were
conducted by the UT crews. Despite the
small size of the decorated sherd samples
from individual sites, in aggregate the
decorated sherd assemblages from these
sites clearly demonstrate that they are part of
a distinctive upper Neches River Caddo
ceramic tradition dominated by the use of
grog (i.e., crushed sherds) temper, brushed
utility ware vessels as well as other kinds of
decorated utility wares, and an assortment of
engraved fine ware sherds, mainly from
Poynor Engraved carinated bowls (cf. Suhm
and Jelks 1962) (Table 6-39).

Archeological Investigations at the Lang Pasture Site (41AN38) in the Upper Neches River Basin of East Texas
Texas Department of Transportation

These sites, as well as the Lang Pasture site,
are all south of a possible second and
contemporaneous upper Neches River
ceramic tradition identified by Woodall
(1972) from sites in the upper part of Lake
Palestine, in Smith County (north of
41SM79 and 41SM93 on Figure 6-1).
That several of the sites were occupied after
ca. A.D. 1650 (or perhaps after ca. A.D.
1560, the onset of sub-phase 3 of the
Frankston phase, see Table 6-37) is apparent
by the occurrence of Patton Engraved vessel
sherds, but the analysis of the vessels from
the upper Neches discussed above makes it
clear that the style of Patton Engraved
evolved from a later variety of Poynor
Engraved. Thus, these later sites are still part
of the same Caddo ceramic tradition, one
that lasted in the upper Neches River basin
until sometime in the 18th century A.D.,
when Caddo groups abandoned the area.
Mrs. J. M. Cook (41AN1)
There are 68 decorated sherds in the
collections from the Mrs. J. M. Cook site, a
probable Frankston phase sub-phase 2
Caddo component (at least based on the
material goods recovered in the cemetery
excavations). Utility wares comprise 60.3%
of the sample, with the fine wares
accounting for the remainder (39.7%),
among them a duck head effigy from a Hood
Engraved effigy vessel.
Brushed (n=8, 11.8%), brushed-incised
(n=3, 4.4%), and brushed-punctated (n=11,
16.2%) sherds from Bullard Brushed jars are
well-represented in the utility wares. Rims
have vertical and horizontal brushing marks,
while body sherds have both vertical and
opposed brushing. Tool or cane punctates
were pushed through the brushing marks on
brushed-punctated examples from the site.
The remainder of the utility wares include
La Rue Neck Banded sherds (n=6, 8.8%),
four body sherds (5.9%) with random tool
punctations, two (2.9%) Killough Pinched
body sherds, and seven (10.3%) Maydelle

Technical Report No. 174202

Incised body sherds, three with cross­
hatched incised lines.
The duck head effigy appendage from the
Mrs. J. M. Cook site is decorated with rows
of small tool punctates. The other fine ware
sherds (seven rims and 19 body sherds) have
engraved designs, and are likely all from
Poynor Engraved or Hood Engraved vessels.
Three rims are from Poynor Engraved, var.
Freeman carinated bowls (a sub-phase 3
diagnostic), three others have opposed
engraved lines (probably from Poynor
Engraved varieties with triangle, nested
triangle, or continuous scroll decorative
elements), and the remaining rim has
concentric lines (an element noted on
several Poynor Engraved varieties) divided
by a crudely engraved hatched panel.
The engraved body sherds have hatched
triangles (n=8), concentric lines (n=6), or
sets of parallel lines (n=5). One of these has
tick marks on one of the engraved lines.
J. M. Cook (41AN2)
Both utility wares (n=23, 56.1%) and fine
wares (n=18, 43.9%) are well-represented in
the decorated sherds from the J. M. Cook
site. Vessels recovered from the cemetery at
this site suggests it dates to the latter part of
the Frankston phase (sub-phase 3, dating
after ca. A.D. 1560).
The most common utility ware in the sherd
assemblage is La Rue Neck Banded (n=7,
17.1%), and there are also six body sherds
(14.6%) with fingernail or tool punctates.
Seven (17.1%) Maydelle Incised rim and
body sherds have either parallel or opposed
incised lines on them, including one that
may have a hatched panel decorative
element. Another rim has a zone of tool
punctates between horizontal incised lines
that encircle the upper part of the vessel.
Only two of the utility wares are brushed
(4.9%), and both are rims from Bullard
Brushed jars with horizontal brushing

291

Chapter 6: Ceramic Artifacts from the Lang Pasture Site (41AN38) and the Place of the Site Within an
Upper Neches River Basin Caddo Ceramic Tradtion

marks; one of these also has an appliqued
node on the rim.
Both Poynor Engraved (n=1, 2.4%), Patton
Engraved (n=10, 24.4%), and Hood
Engraved (n=1) sherds have been identified
in the J. M. Cook fine wares. The Poynor
Engraved rim is a var. Freeman carinated
bowl, while the probable Hood Engraved
sherd is a rim with a single horizontal line
present under the lip. The Patton Engraved
sherds have straight or horizontal lines with
tick marks on them (Patton Engraved, var.
Allen); two of the larger rim sherds are from
carinated bowls with brushed bodies, a later
Frankston and Allen phase decorative
feature in the upper Neches. The remaining
fine wares are comprised of six body sherds
with either parallel (n=5, 12.2%) or opposed
(n=1, 2.4%) lines.
L. Cecil Site (41AN8)
The L. Cecil site decorated sherd collection
includes 108 utility ware and fine ware
sherds. Less than 3% are tempered with
bone. The principal kinds of decorated
sherds are brushed (n=67, 62%) body and
rim sherds, Patton Engraved (n=19, 17.6%)
rim and body sherds, and Poynor Engraved
(n=7, 6.5%) rim and body sherds. The
predominance of Patton Engraved in the
assemblage suggests this site was occupied
primarily after ca. A.D. 1650.
The brushed utility wares from the site have
horizontal and diagonal brushing on the rim
of everted and direct rimmed Bullard
Brushed jars, as well as vertical, diagonal,
overlapping, and opposed brushing on the
vessel body. Two other body sherds have a
parallel brushed-incised decoration. The
remainder of the utility wares (n=11, 10.2%)
include two rims with diagonal rows of
fingernail punctates, a rim with a row of tool
punctates below the lip and above a zone of
horizontal brushing, a diagonal incised rim,
a La Rue Neck Banded rim, and a Maydelle
Incised rim with opposed incised lines and
tool punctated-filled triangular incised

292

zones. There are five utility ware body
sherds: two parallel brushed sherds with a
row of tool punctations pushed through the
brushing, a Killough Pinched piece, another
sherd (probably from a Maydelle Incised jar)
with closely-spaced parallel incised lines,
and a cross-hatched incised Maydelle
Incised body sherd.
Among the fine wares, the Patton Engraved
sherds have horizontal rows of engraved
lines embellished with small triangular tick
marks, probably from Patton Engraved, var.
Allen vessels. The Poynor Engraved vessel
sherds include two rims with engraved ovals
and small hatched triangular elements, either
from Poynor Engraved, var. Cook or var.
Lang, four other sherds from carinated
bowls with negative ovals (Poynor
Engraved, var. Hood), and a carinated bowl
sherd with broadly spaced horizontal and
curvilinear lines; this particular vessel has
been brushed on the vessel body. Two other
engraved body sherds have either a single
straight line or broadly-spaced curvilinear
lines (on a carinated bowl).
Isibel-Gene Donnell (41AN14)
There are 12 decorated sherds in the small
collection from the Isibel-Gene Donnell site.
Ten (83%) are from utility ware vessels,
among them are eight with brushing on the
body, one Killough Pinched rim, and a
cross-hatched incised Maydelle Incised body
sherd; there also is a portion of a brushed
vessel from Burial AG-1 (see Woolsey
1935n) in the sherd collection.
The engraved fine ware sherds from the site
are probably both from Poynor Engraved
vessels. The first is a portion of a carinated
bowl with negative engraved ovals (Poynor
Engraved, var. Hood); the body of the vessel
has opposed brushing. The second, an
engraved body sherd, has concentric lines,
probably part of a Poynor Engraved, var.
Cook or var. Lang vessel with ovals on rim
panels defined by closely-spaced sets of
concentric lines. These varieties suggest that

Technical Report No. 174202

Archeological Investigations at the Lang Pasture Site (41AN38) in the Upper Neches River Basin of East Texas
Texas Department of Transportation

the Isibel-Gene Donnell site was occupied in
sub-phase 2 Frankston phase times.
Rose Daniels Farm (41AN23)
The 35 decorated sherds from the Rose
Daniels Farm site include utility wares
(n=17, 49%) and fine wares (n=18, 51%).
The utility wares are dominated by brushed
body sherds (n=16), and there is one
Killough Pinched body sherd. The fine
wares are from Poynor Engraved vessels.
Two rims have triangular elements on them,
the first with a row of small hatched pendant
oval-shaped triangles below the lip, the
second a carinated bowl with large hatched
nested triangles on the rim panel; several
early or sub-phase 1varieties of Poynor
Engraved (i.e., var. A, var. F, and var. M)
have the engraved nested triangle element
(see Figure 6-64). Three other sherds have
negative engraved ovals (Poynor Engraved,
var. Hood), and these also are brushed on
the vessel body. Nine others have a hatched
triangle element, a common motif in several
Poynor Engraved varieties, and the most
common engraved decorative element in
both the southern and northern areas at the
Lang Pasture site. The remaining four
engraved body sherds have single or
multiple straight or parallel lines on them.
Fred McKee site (41AN32)
None of the 52 decorated sherds from the
Fred McKee site, a sub-phase 3 Frankston
phase site based on the apparent age of the
cemetery
there,
are
bone-tempered.
Decorated utility wares include brushed rim
and body sherds (n=27, 52%) from Bullard
Brushed vessels, and one body sherd (1.9%)
has vertical brushing marks with a vertical
row of tool punctates pushed through the
brushing. Other utility wares include a
punctated rim (1.9%) with a lug handle and
a body sherd with opposed incised lines
(1.9%).
The fine wares include 13 body sherds and
nine rims (42%). Six of the rims have sets of

Technical Report No. 174202

horizontal engraved lines, several with red
pigment rubbed in the lines, and these are
likely from Hood Engraved, var. unspecified
effigy vessels. Two others have either
concentric circles (Poynor Engraved, var.
Cook) or negative ovals (Poynor Engraved,
var. Hood). Another rim from a carinated
bowl has cross-hatched vertical panels,
probably from a Hume Engraved, var. Hume
vessel. Five of the body sherds have Poynor
Engraved concentric circle elements, while
eight others have sets of parallel engraved
lines. The absence of Poynor Engraved, var.
Freeman sherds in this domestic collection
suggests that the occupation here may have
predated sub-phase 3 because this particular
variety is the most common Poynor
Engraved variety in that sub-phase, and in
mortuary contexts at least, is found only
during sub-phase 3 times (see Table 6-37).
There are three plains rims in the collection,
one from a bowl with an exterior folded lip,
another from a jar with a lug handle, and the
third plain rim from an effigy vessel. This
rim still has a bird effigy head appended to
the rim.
Solon Stanley site (41CE3)
The 60 grog-tempered decorated sherds
from the Solon Stanley site (with a cemetery
that was apparently established prior to ca.
A.D. 1480) are dominated by brushed utility
wares (n=45, 75%). Other utility wares from
domestic contexts here include brushed­
punctated (n=4, 6.7%), brushed-incised
(n=1, 1.7%), and neck banded (n=4, 6.7%)
sherds. In the case of the brushed-punctated
sherds, three are decorated with a row of
tool punctates (at the rim-body juncture)
above vertical brushed jar bodies; another
cooking jar sherd has a row of tool punctates
pushed through the brushing. The brushedincised body sherd has parallel brushing
marks overlain by broad opposed incised
lines. The La Rue Neck Banded sherds are
from jars with everted rims. The few fine
wares (n=6, 10%) include rim and body

Upper Neches River Basin Caddo Ceramic Tradtion

sherds with horizontal engraved lines, and
are likely from Hood Engraved vessels.
J. W. Blackburn (41CE4)
The grog- and grog-hematite-tempered
decorated sherds (n=75) from the J. W.
Blackburn site, a subphase 2 Frankston
phase component (at least based on the
mortuary occupation), are dominated by
brushed body sherds (81.3%). Another
brushed body sherd has a row of tool
punctates above a zone of horizontal
brushing on the vessel body. The other
utility ware sherds from the J. W. Blackburn
site are two La Rue Neck Banded jar rims.
The fine wares represented in the decorated
sherds include one rim with horizontal
engraved lines, probably from a Hood
Engraved effigy vessel, a Poynor Engraved
rim with hatched triangles, probably part of
an oval or circular motif, and a third rim
with a row of engraved triangles below the
lip; the triangles have a red pigment rubbed
in the engraved lines. There are also two
Patton Engraved rims, indicating some use
of the site by the Caddo after ca. A.D. 1560.
Engraved body sherds have parallel lines
(n=2) as well as four others from Poynor
Engraved vessels. These have either
concentric circles or hatched triangle
elements.
J. M. Snow (41CE8)
The J. M. Snow site apparently was
occupied late in the Frankston phase and/or
early in the Allen phase, given the frequency
of Patton Engraved fine ware vessel sherds
and Poynor Engraved, var. Freeman vessel
sherds in the assemblage of 75 decorated
sherds. A most unusual feature of the
decorated sherd assemblage from the site—
albeit perhaps affected by the relatively
small size of the sample—is the relative
rarity of brushed sherds among the utility
wares.

294

The utility wares from the J. M. Snow site
include thick-walled, large La Rue Neck
Banded jar rim sherds (n=14, 18.7%) and 12
(16%) brushed-punctated Bullard Brushed
jar sherds. These have either vertical or
horizontal brushing on the rim and body,
with at least one row of tool punctates either
above or through the brushing. Two other
Maydelle Incised rim and body sherds
(2.7%) have incised triangles filled with tool
punctations, while eight additional Maydelle
Incised sherds have either diagonal,
opposed,
or
cross-hatched
incised
decorations on the rim of large jars. Two
body sherds (2.7%) have rows of tool
punctations, and there are also three (4%)
Killough Pinched jar sherds, two with a
heavy bone temper.
The fine wares are rather equally divided
between Patton Engraved (n=17, 22.7%) and
Poynor Engraved (n=11, 14.7%) types. The
Patton Engraved sherds (11 rims and six
body sherds) have horizontal rows of small
tick marks or small hatched pendant
triangles; one has brushing on the body of a
carinated bowl. The Poynor Engraved rims
(n=4) are from Poynor Engraved, var.
Freeman vessels. The body sherds include
seven with concentric circles, possibly from
Poynor Engraved, var. Cook or var. Hood
vessels. The other engraved sherds (n=6,
8%), all body sherds, include a rim with
cross-hatched lines (and a white kaolin clay
pigment rubbed in the lines), four body
sherds with parallel lines, and another body
sherd with a cross-hatched engraved ladder
or panel.
E. W. Henry site (41CE17)
Only three decorated sherds (grog-hematite­
tempered) are in the TARL collection from
the E. W. Henry site. The cemetery at the
site dates to the early part of the Frankston
phase (pre-A.D. 1480), but the habitation
area appears to have been occupied
sometime after ca. A.D. 1650.

Two of the decorated sherds are from Patton
Engraved bowls, including a rim with a row
of tick marks under the lip and a second rim
(from a Patton Engraved, var. Allen vessel)
with five horizontal engraved lines on it,
each with downward-pointing triangular tick
marks. The one utility ware sherd from a
Maydelle Incised jar has opposed incised
triangles around the rim, and each triangular
area is filled with rows of tool punctations.
INAA Results
The results of the INAA results on sherds
from the Lang Pasture site and other sites in
the upper Neches River basin are presented
in detail in Ferguson et al. (Appendix D). As
they point out in the concluding section of
their contribution, the entire Caddo INAA
data base (almost 1000 sherds and a few
clay samples) is in the process of re-analysis
(see Ferguson 2007; Ferguson et al. 2008).
This is being accomplished by changing the
scale of analysis (i.e., defining smaller
regions within East Texas) and employing
K-means
analysis
and
Mahalanobis
distances to refine chemical groups within
each smaller region.
That reanalysis (including 147 sherd
samples from 15 different sites in Region 8
in East Texas, which includes the Lang
Pasture site samples and the other sampled
sites in the upper Neches River basin, see
Ferguson 2007:Figure 1) indicates that
approximately 75% of the analyzed sherds
in this region are assigned to a core chemical
composition group that clearly represents
sherds from vessels made with local but
widely available alluvial clays, with the
remainder in either two smaller groups
(Group 1, 4.8%, and Group 2, 8.2%), also
apparently
from
vessels
of
local
manufacture using chemically distinct and
geographically isolated clays within the
region, or are currently unassigned to a
chemical group (n=17, 11.6%) (Ferguson

Technical Report No. 174202

2007:Table 5 and Figure 3). This reanalysis
has led to a drastic reduction in the
percentage of chemically unassigned sherds
from this part of East Texas, from over 80%
(see Appendix D) to less than 12%.
Of the unassigned sherds in the upper
Neches River basin, three are from the Lang
Pasture site (all from utility wares); four are
from the J. M. Snow site (brushed utility
wares, a Poynor Engraved vessel, and
another fine ware with a cross-hatched
engraved ladder or panel); one (a brushed­
punctated sherd) is from the Fred McKee
site; three (all brushed sherds, including one
pinkware) are from the Solon Stanley site;
and two (a brushed sherd and a Poynor
Engraved sherd) are from the samples
submitted from the J. W. Blackburn site.
Notably, these chemically unassigned sherds
are from a localized area east and northeast
of the Lang Pasture site, principally on the
east side of the Neches River (Figure 6-70).
This sort of distribution suggests (1) that a
currently poorly documented clay source
(possibly a bedrock clay) was used by
certain Caddo potters on the east side of the
Neches River, 4-20 km from Lang Pasture,

and (2) that the unassigned utility wares
sherds from the Lang Pasture site may
have been made by Caddo potters living
primarily on the other side of the river, who
traded or exchanged pottery vessels with the
Caddo groups living at the Lang Pasture
site.6 The regional analysis of the chemical
compositional make-up of Caddo pottery
has the potential to help with the
reconstruction of “how people created,
modified, or moved items within a particular
landscape” (Kantner 2008:54). It is likely
that the vast majority of the Caddo pottery
made in the upper Neches River basin was
produced at the household or community
level, and then distributed and used locally,
with an unknown quantity of that pottery
being made for trade or exchange with
neighbors, both near and far-flung.5

However, the INAA database available at
present for the upper Neches River basin is
not sufficiently robust, because of the
apparent chemical homogeneity in locally
abundant clays and the still limited number
of sites with INAA sherd or clay samples, to
establish with certainly the source of clays
used by Caddo potters or to link those clays
with tempered Caddo pottery vessels and
vessel sherds of known styles and temporal
ranges. Continued INAA analyses from a
range of sites—and on both utility wares and
fine wares—will be important in
establishing production locales and their
spatial scope, as well as delimiting both the
kinds of pottery made in each production
locale and the extent to which they made
have been traded and exchanged amongst
neighboring Caddo groups.
Given that quartz sands are a primary
constituent of the paste of Caddo pottery
from the upper Neches River basin,
analytical methods need to be developed and
implemented here (following the lead of the
important studies that have defined sand
composition zones in Hohokam sites in
Arizona, cf. Abbott 2003; Harry 2004)
through sampling of sands in local clays to
identify sand composition zones and sourcespecific pottery types. These analytical
methods would include INAA, laser
ablation-inductively coupled plasma-mass
spectrometry (see Speakman et al. 2007),
petrographic analysis of sherd pastes, and
electron microprobe analysis of clay and
temper types in samples of sherds from
well-dated Caddo sites in the region.

CONCLUSIONS: UPPER
NECHES RIVER BASIN CADDO
POTTERY TRADITIONS AND
PRACTICES

At the onset of this analysis of the Caddo
ceramic vessel sherds, vessels, and pipes
recovered in the data recovery excavations
from the Lang Pasture site, the expectation
was that these items of material culture were
the product of “a single Caddo occupation;

Technical Report No. 174202

that component must not have lasted more
than 20-40 years” (Perttula 2004:33). I also
speculated, based on the kinds of decorated
ceramic sherds and vessels found there
during the testing, along with the recovery
of a distinctive L-shaped elbow pipe, that
“the Caddo occupation may have taken
place in the latter part of the 14th century and
the early part of the 15th century, on the cusp
of what was to become the Late Caddo
Frankston phase (ca. A.D. 1400-1650) in
this part of the upper Neches River valley”
(Perttula 2004:30).
Has this narrative of the ceramic and
occupational history of the Lang Pasture site
changed, now that there has been continued
analysis of new ceramic materials from both
domestic household and mortuary contexts,
and this analysis has been supplemented
with a detailed investigation of vessel
assemblages from a number of other upper
Neches River? In simple terms: yes and no.
In answering this question in the context of
summarizing and synthesizing the results of
the Lang Pasture ceramic analysis, I am put
in mind of a quote from Prudence Rice, a
well-known archeological ceramicist. Rice
(1996:191) has noted that:
Pottery is a complicated and
multifaceted technology, whether
past or present, and efforts to
oversimplify this complexity and
reduce it to a few meager
dimensions of variability are a
disservice to the field as a whole.
“Doing” ceramic analysis has
always required of its practioners an
enormous tolerance of ambiguity
because there is as yet no unifying
theory and there are no easy
answers. For most of us, that is what
keeps it interesting.
This concluding section of Chapter 6 keeps
in mind the ambiguity and lack of easy
answers.

Chapter 6: Ceramic Artifacts from the Lang Pasture Site (41AN38) and the Place of the Site Within an
Upper Neches River Basin Caddo Ceramic Tradtion

The detailed consideration of the style of the
decorated fine wares and utility wares
recovered at the Lang Pasture site, in
conjunction
with
technological
considerations of temper selection, pastes,
and means of vessel firing in the different
ceramic wares, and a suite of radiocarbon
and TL dates (with their own ambiguities)
suggests that the prehistoric Caddo
occupation at the site began in the first
quarter of the 14th century A.D. and ended in
the early part of the 15th century. Some of
the burials found at the site in a small
cemetery were associated with the domestic
occupation, while others may be slightly
younger in age (and perhaps associated with
continued occupation from areas of the site
outside of the TxDOT right-of-way, see
Perttula et al. 2007), but still having been
interred by the first half of the 15th century.
Thus, on chronological grounds, the
conclusions reached on the basis of the
analysis of the ceramics found during test
excavations are supported, but with a new
sense of intra-site spatial and temporal
complexity not previously recognized. One
new finding is that there are some
substantial intra-site differences in the
character of the domestic ceramics,
particularly in the proportion of brushed
utility wares and plain wares found either in
the southern (N170-188) and northern
(N189-209) parts of the site. These
differences appear to be at least partially
grounded in chronological changes in site
use from north to south, but in the overall
context of the stylistic and technological
character of the ceramic assemblage, also
reflect the fact that over a short period of
time there were significant changes in the
proportion of the three wares and in how
they were decorated. These changes are
embedded in Caddo ceramic assemblages
that otherwise share many stylistic and
technological practices. These similarities
within the southern and northern
assemblages at the Lang Pasture site—in
conjunction with the associated mortuary
vessels—are closely mirrored by the

298

findings from the examination of sherds and
vessels from other upper Neches River basin
Caddo sites, and led to the formal
recognition of a temporally distinctive and
spatially coherent Caddo ceramic tradition
in this part of East Texas (Figure 6-71).
The temporal framework of this prehistoric
Caddo ceramic tradition comes from the
seriation of engraved fine ware vessels from
mortuary contexts (Kleinschmidt 1982;
Perttula 2007b), a more detailed seriation of
specific Poynor Engraved rim motifs (see
Table 6-37) from a large sample of burial
vessels, and extensive radiocarbon and TL
dating from the Lang Pasture site and
selected other Caddo sites in the upper
Neches River basin. This framework
includes a ca. A.D. 1320-1400 component at
the Lang Pasture site, sub-phase 1 (ca. A.D.
1400-1480), sub-phase 2 (ca. A.D. 1480­
1560), and sub-phase 3 (ca. A.D. 1560­
1650) of the Frankston phase, and the postA.D. 1650 Allen phase. The ceramic
tradition probably lasted through the 18th
century, but its ending point in the upper
Neches River basin has not been established.
The spatial context for this Late Caddo
ceramic tradition is a ca. 6600 km2 area of
the upper Neches (see Figure 6-70), of
which the best-studied part is a 1700 km2
area centered on the Lang Pasture site (see
Figure 6-1), a number of small to mediumsized cemeteries, and domestic ceramic
assemblages primarily from the Lake
Palestine area (cf. Anderson et al. 1974;
Kleinschmidt
1982;
Perttula
and
Middlebrook 2009).
This broader upper Neches area is west of a
second and broadly contemporaneous Late
Caddo ceramic tradition in the Neches,
Angelina, and Attoyac river basins that is
dominated by bone-tempered brushed
pottery and a different suite of engraved fine
wares (see Jelks 1965; Story 1982;
Middlebrook 1994; Fields 1995).

Ceramic Practice
By ceramic practice, I mean the decorative,
technological, and formal attributes of
sherds and whole vessels that were chosen
and practiced by a potter or group of potters
when they made pottery vessels within a
distinctive social community or network of
socially related individuals (see Eckert
2008:2-3, 10-13). These practices as a whole
form the “technical choices [that are]
selected in a rich context of tradition, value,
alternatives, and compromises” (Rice
1996:140). As Stark (2006:22) puts it,
“people reproduce their cultural and social
positions through daily practice, that daily
practice is structured by basic organizational
principles,” and that daily practice is
expressed through tendencies and trends
(habitus) “that develop as a practical
solution to a particular demand within the
framework of certain environmental and
cultural conditions” (Eckert 2008:10).
These choices and tendencies exhibited in
the manufacture and decoration of ceramics
by potters indicate that the consideration of
ceramic practice is an ideal medium for the
study of technical systems (the tools and
technical capabilities), social interaction,
style, and social identity, as well as the
dissemination of relevant behaviors between
individuals (Chilton 1999:2; van der Leeuw
2002:241; Rogers and Ehrlich 2008). Thus,
the particulars of ceramic practice and
technical choice that can be identified in a
temporally (and socially) related group of
aboriginal Caddo sites are a means to
recognize socially defined groups that
closely interacted, transmitted “knowledge
among individuals creating pottery”
(McClure 2007:486) as a means of social
learning, and this knowledge of manufacture
and decoration choices was inherited by
other descendant potters in that group. In
this context, then, ceramic practices shared
or not shared by potters (women in the
community) reflect the learning of their craft
from other women in the community, and
that “patterns in local pottery styles, both

300

technological and decorative, result from
potters
making
different
decisions
throughout the production process but using
a similar set of tools and techniques
available to other potters within an area”
(Eckert 2008:2).
In what follows, I first summarize the key
choices and trends in the character of the
domestic ceramics from the Lang Pasture
site, followed by the mortuary ceramics
from this site. Next, I examine issues of
style and social identity and changes in
culinary traditions as possible manifestations
of changes in ceramic practice that occurred
in the upper Neches. The mortuary ceramics
from other upper Neches River basin Caddo
sites illustrate broad continuities in ceramic
practice, particularly in terms of vessel
decoration and vessel form, but also
demonstrate patterns in technical choices
that are very different than what is
documented in domestic Caddo ceramic
assemblages of the same age and made by
the same social group of potters. Finally, I
employ the disparate and variable ceramic
practice data (i.e., decorative, technological,
and formal) discussed at length throughout
this chapter—from both domestic and
mortuary contexts—to posit the existence of,
and sketch the character of, distinctive upper
Neches Caddo ceramic tradition.
Domestic Character of the Lang Pasture
Caddo Ceramics
The Caddo ceramics found in domestic,
household, contexts at the Lang Pasture site
include fine wares (engraved and slipped
carinated bowls, bowls, and bottles used for
food serving and to hold liquids), utility
wares (brushed and wet-paste decorated jars
and an occasional bowl used primarily for
cooking, but also for storage), and plain
wares, including bowls and bottles. There
are technological and stylistic differences
between the wares, as discussed above, and
the Caddo potters that made these vessels
clearly had a considerable range in choices
and practices in how they were made and

Technical Report No. 174202

Archeological Investigations at the Lang Pasture Site (41AN38) in the Upper Neches River Basin of East Texas
Texas Department of Transportation

decorated (cf. van der Leeuw 2002:241-243;
Stark 2006:24), although the range of
differences were overall rather minor in
technical practices, except in the case of
certain decorative and stylistic elements.
The ubiquity of these wares in every part of
the site indicate that they were available to
all the Caddo that lived there, and that there
was no restricted access to the use of fine
wares. These same wares are also found in
the mortuary vessel assemblage at the Lang
Pasture site, but in very different
proportions, with an increased emphasis on
fine wares as one of the principal funerary
offerings (see Chapter 11, this volume).
Ceramic ethnoarcheological studies (Stark
2003:202-204) over the years have
demonstrated that there is a consistent logic
and sequence to the production of low-fired
hand-made earthenware vessels such as
those made and/or used domestically by
Caddo peoples at the Lang Pasture site.
These steps include, from first to last: (a)
procurement of materials such as the clay
and temper, as well as fuel; (b) preparation
of materials, including the crushing,
cleaning, size sorting, or mixing of clays and
tempers to prepare the paste; (c)
construction of the vessel, beginning with
the base, and then building the walls, along
with finishing treatments, among them
smoothing and burnishing; (d) decoration of
the vessel (at least wet-paste utility wares);
(e) drying and firing; and (f) post-firing
treatments, which in the case of the Lang
Pasture fine wares also includes the
engraving of certain fine ware vessels, as
well as surface burnishing (Stark 1999:Table
3.1; see also Arthur 2006:29-54; Deal
1998:37-51; Tschopik 1941:17-41).
Ceramic Production
Raw Material
Clays used for vessel manufacture at the
Lang Pasture site were likely gathered from
nearby alluvial settings, as suggested by
instrumental neutron activation analysis,

Technical Report No. 174202

particularly the more easily processed
alluvial clay bodies along Caddo Creek, but
certainly within a short (1-7 km away, at
most) distance from the settlement.
Depending upon the area of the site and the
type of ware, about 18.4-33.6% percent of
the vessel sherds have a fine sandy paste,
suggesting that a naturally sandy clay was
occasionally selected by Caddo potters for
use in making particular kinds of vessels,
those in which a sandy paste facilitated
resistance to thermal shock or mechanical
breakage. The presence of sand in the clay
paste may, in fact, indicate preferential use
of alluvial clays by local potters (at least
during the 14th century), rather than the
harder-to-process bedrock clay.
Approximately 8% of the plain and
decorated sherds from domestic contexts at
the Lang Pasture site came from “pinkware”
vessels. These are sherds with a distinctive
red paste after firing. These vessels were
made with a different and second kind of
clay with a moderate-to-high iron content,
probably deriving locally from iron-rich
Weches Formation outcrops in the
southwestern part of Smith County, the
northwestern part of Cherokee County, and
northeastern Anderson County, 4-20 km
from Lang Pasture.
Temper
Grog, crushed and burned bone, and crushed
hematite are the significant tempers used in
the locally produced ceramics at the Lang
Pasture site. The differences, by area and by
ceramic ware, are very subtle in terms of
temper use. However, the temper data
strongly supports the notion that the
predominant practice of Caddo potters at the
site, as at other upper Neches River Caddo
sites (see Figure 6-70), was in making grogtempered plain ware, utility ware, and fine
ware pottery in both areas and through time.
It would have been important that sources of
grog temper would have been abundant at
the site, at least after the first few vessels
were broken there, as would the fact that

301

Chapter 6: Ceramic Artifacts from the Lang Pasture Site (41AN38) and the Place of the Site Within an
Upper Neches River Basin Caddo Ceramic Tradtion

including grog in the paste (especially finely
crushed pieces) would have helped
minimize the likelihood of vessel failure
form either mechanical and thermal stress
(Steponaitis 1984:94-95, 111). Caddo
potters would have discovered the
advantages of grog-tempered pastes through
trial and error, experience, and learned
cultural traditions.

unfortunate because information of this sort
has strong implications for contemporary
research in Southwestern archaeology…For
example, reconstructing the organization of
a prehistoric settlement necessitates that the
presence or absence of different activities be
demonstrated as conclusively as possible.”
The situation is no better in the Caddo area
of East Texas.

Gamble (2007:198) has suggested that the
addition of grog temper to pottery clay
reflects more than simply a functional
choice for potters. Instead, he interprets the
temper choice as ‘the inclusion of the
ancestors in the next generation of pots.”
Thus, following this interpretation of temper
use, every grog-tempered pot made by a
Caddo potter can be construed as a link in an
evolving ceramic tradition and a continued
reinforcement of social identity.

Sullivan (1988) has suggested several
possible correlates of ceramic production
that may be present and identifiable in the
archeological record, including manos and
metates for processing clay and temper;
various types of scrapers (stone, bone, and
sherd) for scraping and thinning vessel
walls; recycled sherds for use as temper or
molds; and fire-cracked rock. Production
facilities may include basins and hearths.
“The most convincing evidence of on-site
ceramic production consists of artifacts
frequently
associated
with
ceramic
manufacture that are found clustered around
pottery-making and pottery-firing facilities”
(Sullivan 1988:24). Features found at the
Lang Pasture site include shallow pit basins
and other small features that could have
been used in processing materials or in
making pots; hearths are also present.
Unfortunately, there is nothing associated
with any of the pit features or hearths at the
Lang Pasture site that suggest their use in
ceramic production. The Lang Pasture site
ceramic assemblage also contains very little
in the way of waste byproducts from
ceramic manufacture, such as coil
fragments, lumps and balls of clay, clay
scraping tools, or stone polishers. The site
assemblage has no sherds identified as
wasters—pottery damaged during firing
(Rye 1981:147). However, wasters may be
rare, depending upon the frequency of
production, quantities of vessels produced,
manufacturing techniques, raw materials,
and tempering practices. Waster sherds may
also have been used in later firings to protect
newly made vessels; sherds used in this
manner may not be physically altered to any
noticeable degree (Stark 1985:175). Broken

Methods of Manufacture
The principal technique used in the
manufacture of Lang Pasture and other
upper Neches River basin ceramics was the
building of vessels using coils, beginning at
the flat base and working up the vessel
body. Using the coiling method, coils of
clay, in the form of ropes, rolls, or fillets,
were built up to create the desired size and
height of the vessel. Coiling is a technique
especially suited to the construction of large,
sturdy vessels, such as storage jars (Rice
1987:128), but in the case of the upper
Neches Caddo potters, coiling of plastic
clays led to the manufacture of a wide
variety of vessel forms.
Production Areas
Production areas are notoriously difficult to
discern archeologically (Rice 1987:181).
Even in the American Southwest, where
preservation of the archeological record is
unequalled, Sullivan (1988:23) observed
that “hardly any evidence has been
recovered regarding the locations where
vessels were made and fired…This is

302

Technical Report No. 174202

Archeological Investigations at the Lang Pasture Site (41AN38) in the Upper Neches River Basin of East Texas
Texas Department of Transportation

pottery vessels in Caddo ceramic
assemblages were also readily recycled as
grog temper, thus further removing any
direct evidence of pottery manufacturing
failures.
The location of productions areas speaks to
the organization of ceramic production.
Sullivan (1988:23) notes that “identification
of ceramic production loci is crucial for
evaluating current models about the
complexity of prehistoric Southwestern
societies…It has been commonly assumed,
for instance, that ceramic manufacture was
primarily
a
household
activity…An
alternative view suggests that ceramics were
made at a few regional centers.” While it
seems reasonable to believe that ceramic
production in the upper Neches River
occurred at the individual household level,
considering the diversity in vessel forms,
sizes, and decorative choices that seem to be
apparent even within the southern and
northern areas at the Lang Pasture site, it is
unknown if this is in fact the case, or if there
were more specialized facilities or
production locales within the basin itself.
Only continued chemical compositional
analyses of upper Neches River ceramics
and the fine-scale study of vessel forms and
distinctive decorative motifs (especially in
the mortuary wares) will be able to
determine the existence of local vs. regional
scales of production of certain kinds of
vessels
The sample of rim sherds from the

the broken remnants from separate vessels,
suggests that there may have been thousands
of vessels used by the Caddo during their
occupation here, given the apparent size of
the site relative to the proportion that was
excavated. With a duration of occupation
that lasted at least 80 years—but with an
unknown number of households—the
number of vessels used by each household

Vessel Form and Function
The Caddo pottery from domestic contexts
at the Lang Pasture site—based on the
number of rims from the three different
pottery wares found there—is dominated by
decorated utility wares, typically jars used
for cooking and/or storage activities, and
plain wares, generally simple bowls used for
food serving along with the fine wares.
Overall, almost 48% of the rims (n=456) are
from utility wares, another 31% are plain
wares, and the remaining 22% are fine
wares: carinated bowls, bottles, and some
bowl forms. Plain ware rims are more
abundant in the northern area (34%) than in
the southern area (25%); utility ware vessels
are equally represented in both areas (46%
and 48%, respectively); and fine ware rims
are much more common in the southern area
(29%) compared to the northern area (17%).
For the site as a whole, the utility wares
include almost 79% of all the decorated
sherds from non-feature domestic contexts
(see Table 6-1) and 70.6% of the decorated
sherds from features.
The rim and lip form data from both the
southern and northern ceramic component/
areas indicate that the same range of forms
were used by potters in both areas.:
carinated bowls, bottles, bowls, and jars
These were forms that were obviously
considered appropriate by the Caddo to the
kinds of vessels being made and used in
each areas. The particular shape and form of
these vessels is a hallmark of the technology
and style of Caddo pottery vessels in the
upper Neches, and these shapes and forms
would have been immediately recognizable
(e.g., Stark 2003:212) to other Caddo as
belonging to those of a particular social
group, as with the earlier quote from Sadie
Bedoka, a Caddo-Delaware woman, that
potters from one group could tell those of
another simply by different pottery shapes
(e.g., La Vere 1998:92). Comparisons

Chapter 6: Ceramic Artifacts from the Lang Pasture Site (41AN38) and the Place of the Site Within an
Upper Neches River Basin Caddo Ceramic Tradtion

between the two areas at the Lang Pasture
site in rim and lip form suggest that there
were minor differences in rim and lip form
preferences, and thus presumably, minor
differences in the kinds and proportions of
vessels used through time at the Lang
Pasture site.
Larger jars (with very thick rim and body
walls, >9-10 mm) were probably used for
short term storage, simply because they
would be less easily moved about during
cooking, while larger carinated bowls may
have been employed in communal food
serving; the majority of the serving vessels
and cooking jars were in the 1-2 liter range,
and thus likely intended for household use.
Most of the utility ware jars were used for
cooking, based on their form as open
containers, as well as the presence of soot
deposits, either heavy or light, as well as
preserved charred organic remains. Sherds
from jars tend to have residues formed on
the interior of vessels that are related
directly to cooking, as well as soot deposits
built up from wood combustion, indicating
that vessels were placed over an open fire
during use (Hally 1983:9). Bowls may have
also been used for serving food, like the
carinated bowls, but many of them lacked
surface decorative embellishments. Bottle
sherds, used for storing and carrying liquids,
also were a common utilitarian form made
for the use of the site occupants, particularly
those Caddo living in the earlier and
northern area of the site.
A number of conditions contribute to the
longevity or use-live, of a given vessel,
including: “(1) basic strength, in terms of
wall hardness and thickness, and vessel size,
(2) use and reuse frequency and variation,
(3) drying and storage practices, (4)
opportunity for breakage, especially due to
children and animals, (5) the potential for
vessel repair [and] (6) the number of vessels
in the household inventory” (Deal
1998:168). Smoothed and burnished grogtempered pottery made at Lang Pasture
combines strength, thermal shock resistance,

304

resistance
to
breakage,
and
low
permeability, and, thus, may have lasted for
a considerable length of time, especially if
the vessels being used were large in size (see
Arthur 2006:93). Vessel breakage, by
whatever means, nevertheless, occurred with
regularity at the Lang Pasture site because
they were used on a daily basis, particularly
among the cooking vessels, and this resulted
in a large accumulation of pottery sherds
inside and outside house structures.
Breakage, however, did not always signal
the end of use of a vessel (see Arthur
2006:102-120). Deal (1998:108) found in
his study of pottery consumption in the
Central Maya Highlands that, “The decision
to reuse a given vessel for a specific activity
was determined by the nature of the
surviving portion, such as a rim segment, a
large sherd, or a bottomless vessel, rather
than by its original value, quality, or
morphology.” At Lang Pasture, there is no
evidence of vessel repair via lacing through
holes drilled adjacent to cracks. Where
repair was not an option, some vessels could
have been recycled. Again, however, there is
no evidence in the domestic ceramics from
the Lang Pasture site for vessel recycling. It
seems to have been easier to either make or
obtain new pottery vessels than to recycle
broken vessels. The absence of evidence of
vessel recycling, mending, and reuse in the
Lang Pasture ceramics suggests that there
were Caddo potters living at the site or
nearby in surrounding households (cf.
Arthur 2006:119).
Vessel Size
Caddo domestic ceramics from the Lang
Pasture site are relatively variable in size,
ranging from about 0.2 liters to as much as
4-6 liters. There are also several notable
trends in the vessel rim orifice diameter
data: very small to medium-sized vessels are
proportionally more abundant in the older,
northern component, although small vessels
become more commonly used later in time
at the expense of medium-sized vessels.

Technical Report No. 174202

Archeological Investigations at the Lang Pasture Site (41AN38) in the Upper Neches River Basin of East Texas
Texas Department of Transportation

Very small vessels (bottles)—all plain
wares—are restricted to the northern area
(see Table 6-20). These data suggest that the
Caddo living in the northern area made
pottery designed for use in cooking and food
serving in small social groups, perhaps
individual
households,
and
only
occasionally were foods prepared and served
for larger (i.e., more than 10 individuals)
groups of people. Later in time, larger
vessels used for food service (fine wares),
cooking (utility wares), and storage (utility
wares) were more frequently produced and
used at the Lang Pasture site. In the southern
area of the site, then, the ceramics produced
and used by the Caddo were apparently
made with the presumption that food
preparation and serving needs extended to
both household and supra-household
contexts.

thinner and lighter vessels would have also
contributed to the ease with which serving
vessels could be handled, used, and
transported.

Another aspect of vessel size that can be
measured is body wall thickness. The fine
ware vessel sherds are consistently from
vessels made thinner than the decorated
utility ware or plain ware sherds,
particularly when measured along the rim.
These variations in vessel wall thickness are
likely related to functional and technological
decisions made by Caddo potters in how
these different wares were intended to be
used in local Caddo households. The less
substantial vessel walls in some of the utility
wares would be well suited to the cooking
and heating of foods and liquids and,
because heat would have been conducted
efficiently while heating rapidly, would have
contributed to their ability to withstand heatrelated stresses; also, the much thicker
utility ware vessels (with rim thicknesses
greater than 9 mm and body wall
thicknesses greater than 10-11 mm) would
have created stronger and more stable
vessels, and would have been well suited for
use as long-term storage containers (Rice
1987:227). Fine wares were probably
intended for use in the serving of foods and
liquids, and thinner and less porous vessel
walls would have helped to maintain the
temperature of served food and liquids;

Firing

Technical Report No. 174202

Another factor that would have influenced
vessel body wall thickness would have been
the sequence in which a vessel was
constructed (Krause 2007:35), of which
there are a wide variety of choices available
to potters (cf. van der Leeuw 2002:243-256).
Vessels constructed from the bottom up, as
these Caddo vessels likely were, would tend
to have thinner walls moving up the vessel
body towards the rim, with the lower portion
of the vessel—especially the base, likely
made separately, and thus available to serve
as a support during later vessel
construction—usually significantly thicker
than the upper portions of the vessel.

The vessel sherds found in domestic
contexts were primarily fired in a low
oxygen or reducing environment. Reduced
or low oxygen fired sherds are less common
from the southern ceramic component/area,
especially among the utility wares.
Conversely, sherds from the southern site
area are more likely to be from vessels fired
in an oxidizing or incompletely oxidizing
environments, again most notably among the
utility wares (39.8%), and less so among the
fine wares and plain wares.
Utility ware, plain ware, and fine ware
vessels were fired differently from each
other. Fine ware and plain wares were better
made and better fired (at least in terms of
regulating the firing temperature), and they
were probably fired longer in a low oxygen
environment than the utility wares. The
Caddo potters exerted more control over the
end product of fine ware and plain ware
vessel manufacture than they did with the
utility wares, primarily to produce a harder
ceramic. Firing conditions tended to be more
heterogeneous among the utility wares,
likely the product of the multi-purpose

305

Chapter 6: Ceramic Artifacts from the Lang Pasture Site (41AN38) and the Place of the Site Within an
Upper Neches River Basin Caddo Ceramic Tradtion

nature of these vessel forms, as they were
used for cooking pots and storage
containers. As long as the porosity of the
utility wares was not excessive, and there
was a good balance between clay plasticity
and temper constituents, they did not need to
be fired for as long a time as the harder fine
wares to be serviceable vessels without
being subject to diminished strength from
cumulative thermal fatigue as well as cracks
and fractures (cf. Steponaitis 1984).
Mortuary Character of the Ceramics
from the Lang Pasture Site
Among the funerary offerings placed with
the Caddo burials at the Lang Pasture site
are 10 carinated bowls, 11 bowls, three
compound bowls (apparently a rare vessel
form in the upper Neches), three jars, and
four bottles. These are the same vessel forms
used in domestic contexts, but with
significantly higher numbers of serving
vessels in mortuary contexts; this is a
practice shared with later upper Neches
Caddo groups.
One of the more distinctive features of the
mortuary vessels from the site is the high
frequency of plain vessels (61%). The
carinated bowls, bowls (with one exception),
and bottles, if decorated, have engraved
motifs, particularly several distinctive
regional and local varieties of Poynor
Engraved that appear to have been common
only before ca. A.D. 1480. Decorated utility
wares from the burials include Maydelle
Incised jars and a pinched bowl.
The vessels used in domestic contexts at the
Lang Pasture site are generally much larger
than those placed in the burials with the
deceased, or at least have a wider range in
vessel volume, which makes sense when one
balances the needs of the living community
and household with the needs of the
deceased. The mortuary vessels are no larger
than 20 cm in orifice diameter (and no larger
than 2 liters in volume), and may have been
chosen because at the time of burial

306

interment, the Caddo living there believed
that only one to a few servings of food were
necessary on the deceased’s journey to the
House of the Dead.
Local Ceramic Styles and Caddo Social
Identity
There is a general consensus among
archeologists that stylistic expressions, and
variations in that expression, in material
culture, dress, body ornamentation, food
practices, etc. can be a measure of social
identity. However, the recognition of style in
archeological materials is more than “the
material correlate” [emphasis in the
original] of social affiliation” (Wobst
1999:120). Patterns of style reflect
variability in both individual choices as well
as social group membership, and therefore
the existence and pervasiveness of styles in
material culture—our concern here being the
existence of local styles of ceramic
decoration—reflect
the
strength
of
interaction between individuals (individual
potters), the form of cultural transmission
(i.e., from parent to child; from a teacher to
a pupil; from older to younger members of a
social group; or between unrelated
individuals, see McClure 2007:Table 1), and
the ability of styles to be inherited from one
generation to the next (O’Brien and Lyman
2003:19). Styles “share a common
developmental history and are from the
same tradition” (O’Brien and Lyman
2003:19). Style in ceramics as used here
simply mean the characteristic patterns of
pottery decoration that when applied to the
rim and/or body of vessel in certain
combinations and elements result in a
unique set of visually represented design
motifs and attributes. The combinations may
be innumerable, as the choice “between
certain kinds of design elements on ceramics
is not a functional consideration but rather is
historically determined and selectively
“neutral,” because there is no inherent
advantage between one element and the
next” (Meltzer 2003:140). In actual fact,
ceramic practice among Caddo potters in the

Technical Report No. 174202

Archeological Investigations at the Lang Pasture Site (41AN38) in the Upper Neches River Basin of East Texas
Texas Department of Transportation

upper Neches dictated the range of
acceptable variation (a rather impressive
variation at that, particularly among the fine
wares) in stylistic choice that were
maintained for generations.
One last thing to mention about style: styles
are expected to change rapidly, more rapidly
than functional forms of tools and pottery
vessels (see Rogers and Ehrlich 2008:3418).
This interpretation follows from the idea that
stylistic traits have a relatively rapid turn­
over because of their use in generating and
reinforcing cultural identity, their selectively
neutral character (i.e., stylistic elements
have no differential effect on survival), and
the potential high variation between
individuals and groups in learning and
replicating
specific
shared
styles,
particularly (in the case of ceramics) if
Caddo potters were producing vessels
largely independent of one another, that
together comprise a ceramic tradition at any
one moment in time.
While there are significant differences in the
proportions of certain kinds of utility wares
and fine wares at the Lang Pasture site, the
wares in both areas share many similar
decorative elements and stylistic motifs, and
in a number of cases, these elements and
motifs occur in roughly similar proportions.
This suggests that these wares are part of the
same ceramic stylistic tradition of practice
as well as part of the same Caddo social
group; furthermore, they may not be
separated much in time. That they share
many decorative elements (Table 6-40), but

Technical Report No. 174202

in slightly different proportions, presumably
represents evidence of subtle stylistic
changes over time effected by Caddo potters
in how utility ware and fine ware were to be
decorated, as well as the particular styles
preferred by the Lang Pasture community.
In the southern area, jars with brushed rims
are particularly abundant (25%). This is
followed by vessels with tool punctated
(15%), brushed-punctated (7%), and incised­
punctated (5%) rim decorations (see Table
6-6). The proportions of rims among these
particular utility wares are not much
different between the northern and southern
areas (11-20%), except for the brushed­
punctated sherds. In this decorative method,
only 4% of the brushed-punctated sherds in
the northern area are rims, compared to 28%
of these sherds from the southern area.
Brushed
vessel
sherds
comprise
approximately 54% of all the decorated
sherds in the southern area (an 180%
increase from the northern ceramic
component/area). This one change in the
manufacture and use of one kind of utility
ware—the brushed cooking jar (see
below)—led to considerable reductions in
previously important kinds of decorated
utility wares, and a different character to the
overall utility ware assemblage with time,
even as the elements of decoration remained
consistently in use: incised (13%, a 45%
reduction from its proportion in the northern
area), incised-punctated (3%, a 62%
reduction), and punctated (9.5%, a 47%
reduction).

In the northern ceramic component/area, the
incised, punctated, and incised-punctated
vessel sherds account for 49% of all the
decorated sherds, whereas in the southern
ceramic component/area, that percentage has
decreased to only 25%. The emphasis on
incised triangles filled with punctations, or
the use of geometric incised line designs
remained the same (see Table 6-40).
The only significant difference in the
brushed sherds from the southern and
northern areas is the absolute proportions of
brushed sherds in the utility wares: 26% in
the northern area and 64% in the southern
area. Clearly, the period after ca. A.D. 1320­
1400 and in much of the 15th century A.D.
is one where Caddo potters in the upper
Neches River basin began to manufacture
considerable numbers of jars with brushed
vessel bodies and rims.
Fine wares, especially engraved bottles, are
more common in the northern site
component/area than they are in the southern
area. Decorative elements on bottles shared
in both site areas included sets of curvilinear
lines and triangular elements, usually in
combination with hatched areas, either
triangular, circular, or oval-shaped (see
Table 6-40). Many of these bottle sherds are
from globular Poynor Engraved bottles (see
Suhm and Jelks 1962:Plate 63g-j) rather
than the elongated bottle form (see Suhm
and Jelks 1962:Plate 63a-f), as long vertical
decorative motifs that occur on these
elongated forms (as they do on Hume
Engraved bottles) were not clearly identified
in the Lang Pasture bottle sherds.
The sets of decorative elements in the
engraved fine ware carinated bowls and
bowls from both site areas are found on
Poynor Engraved vessels in the upper
Neches River basin (see Suhm and Jelks
1962:Plate 62a-j), many with hatched
triangles of various sizes appended to larger
motifs on rim panels. The decorations on
these engraved vessels feature—either in a
singular fashion or in combination—

Technical Report No. 174202

triangular, oval, or circular motifs on rim
panels filled in with closely to widelyspaced hatching or cross-hatched lines,
usually with appended hatched triangles (see
Table 6-40). Horizontal engraved sherds in
the southern area may be from Hood
Engraved effigy vessels, although no effigy
heads were recovered at the Lang Pasture
site. Lip notched, engraved-lip notched, and
red-slipped fine ware sherds, although rare
overall, represent other distinctive stylistic
practices used in the decoration of the
northern area fine ware assemblage. Sites
with Poynor Engraved vessels with similar
decorative styles to those from Lang Pasture
are found over a ca. 500 km2 area in the
central part of the upper Neches, from
Caddo Creek on the north and Walnut Creek
to the south (Figure 6-72).
Culinary Traditions and Increased Maize
Consumption
The culinary tradition in use at the Lang
Pasture site and all other post-A.D. 1300
Caddo sites in the upper Neches River basin
was one designed to effectively deal with
the processing and cooking of maize, in
particular, with other sundry supplements
(i.e., beans, deer meat, nut meat and oil) and
condiments. That the vessels from the Lang
Pasture site are all hollow wares (i.e., jars,
bowls, and carinated bowls), and the other
studied sites have the same range of vessel
forms, it seems likely that the Caddo diet
was based almost entirely on liquid-based
foods boiled and cooked in jars, including
stews, corn and bean dishes, and gruels, as
well as the serving and drinking of liquids. It
is suspected that Caddo culinary traditions in
general were primarily domestic in scale
rather than community or communal-based,
because of the small to medium size of
many of the vessels, although the size of
some cooking and serving vessels found in
mortuary contexts suggests that communal
food practices were also important at certain
times in upper Neches River basin Caddo
society.

Any dietary changes and differences in food
consumption by Caddo peoples should have
had a significant role in the functional and
temporal character of ceramic assemblages
in use in the upper Neches River basin,
particularly any changes or trends in the
character or proportions of cooking jars in
Caddo domestic settings. That is, any
changes in the kind and proportion of vessel
forms that were made and used by the
Caddo in cooking imply that there were
changes in culinary traditions: changes in
the foods that were consumed, and changes
in the way that foods were prepared and
served (e.g., Mills 1999:100). In other
words, increases in agricultural reliance by
any Caddo group, in the upper Neches or
elsewhere in the Caddo area, ought to be
reflected in changes in the character of their
cooking wares relative to the remainder of
the ceramic assemblage.
I have previously argued that the increasing
predominance of utility wares, specifically
the number of brushed jars (and the
proportion of brushed sherds in the utility
wares), after ca. A.D. 1250/1300 in East
Texas Caddo sites is a proxy measure of the
increasing local intensification in the
production and consumption of maize and
other cultigens in the diet (Perttula
2001:112).7 There was a continual need in
an agricultural society to manufacture
sufficient numbers of cooking jars that were
suitable for the cooking and processing of
maize, and these cooking jars were
apparently constantly breaking (given the
large numbers of cooking jar sherds at
Caddo sites) because of thermal stress
failures (e.g., Steponaitis 1984:92). It has
already been shown by both proportions of
rims and proportion of decorated sherds that
the Lang Pasture site ceramic assemblage is
dominated by utility ware vessels (many of
them brushed, at least in the southern area),
most of which would have been used for
cooking; the Lake Palestine Late Caddo
ceramic assemblages reflect this same utility

Technical Report No. 174202

ware dominance in sites occupied after ca.
A.D. 1300.
In the absence of any stable isotopic analysis
of residues from sherds or vessels (e.g.,
Beehr and Ambrose 2007) from the upper
Neches as a determinant of what foods were
actually being cooked among these Caddo
societies, stable isotope analyses of Caddo
human remains from the region can closely
track maize consumption trends and
patterns. In fact, it is known from stable
carbon isotope data from other parts of the
Caddo area, particularly along the Red River
(Perttula 2008a:Figure 6), that there were
changes in Caddo diet beginning after ca.
A.D. 1300, because of the increased
consumption of maize. Stable isotope
analysis is an integral part of determining
maize intensification among the Caddo
because it monitors the relative abundance
of carbon 13 to carbon 12 (13C/12C) in bone
collagen and bioapatite (Pollard et al.
2007:171-172, 180-188).
The ratio of
13 12
C/ C differs between C3 and C4
photosynthetic plant pathways. C3 and C4
plants have different 13C means and ranges
with C3 plants averaging -26.7 + 2.7 ‰ and
C4 plants averaging -12.5 + 1 ‰. These
values are passed up the food chain with a
fractionation factor of about 5‰. Maize was
the primary C4 food source for the Caddo.
The stable carbon isotope values on human
skeletal remains, specifically on collagen in
the bone, should range from a low value of
ca. -21‰ value for non-maize-eating
populations and a high or C4 enriched value
of ca. -8 ‰ for intensive maize eaters. With
respect to general bioapatite values as an
indication of maize consumption, given a
mean -5 ‰ spacing between bioapatite and
collagen values, a bioapatite value of ca. ­
16 ‰ would be indicative of a non-maize­
eating diet while a value of -3 ‰ would
represent a 100% C4 or maize diet.

Stable carbon isotope analyses of Caddo
burials in the upper Neches River basin have
been obtained from 14 different sites (see
Chapter 10, this volume): The pre-A.D.
1300 Caddo burials in the upper Neches
River sample have bioapatite values that fall
into two clusters: one between -10.9 ‰ and
-11.7 ‰ and the other between -7.6 ‰ and ­
8.7 ‰.
These same burials have collagen values that
range from -15.9 to -21.8 ‰. The diversity
in bioapatite and collagen values at this time
is notable, hinting (albeit with very small
sample sizes) at a similar diversity in maize
consumption by Early Caddo populations in
the upper Neches River basin. The lowest
maize values (ca. 30-38% maize in the diet,
using bioapatite measurements, and between
ca. 10-40% using the collagen values) are
from two Stage II burials from Mound C at
the George C. Davis site (see Story 1997)
and the Forest Mound site. These burials
likely date to the Early Caddo period, from

312

the 10th century A.D. in the case of the
George C. Davis burials (Story 1997:60,
64). A later flexed burial (Feature 130),
although undated, at the George C. Davis
site was found in the vicinity of a large
structure (Feature 125) abandoned by the
early 12th century A.D. (Story 1997:86). Its
bioapatite value indicates this individual
may have had a substantial (+55%) maize
diet, but its collagen value of -18.4 ‰
suggests otherwise; it is unfortunate that a
radiocarbon date was not obtained from
these remains to better ground the
conflicting maize estimations.
The burials from the Lang Pasture site fall
into one main group with bioapatite values
that range from -10.8 ‰ to -8.7 ‰, with a
single outlier (Feature 92) with a bioapatite
value of -6.4 ‰; this latter individual may
have had a maize-reliant diet. Collagen
values for all the burials range between ­
15.6 ‰ and -19.7 ‰, suggesting maize
consumption in some individuals topped

Technical Report No. 174202

Archeological Investigations at the Lang Pasture Site (41AN38) in the Upper Neches River Basin of East Texas
Texas Department of Transportation

40% of the diet. The bioapatite values
suggest that among this ca. early 14th to
early 15th century Caddo population in the
upper Neches River basin, maize
consumption was relatively consistent,
probably comprising between ca. 40-60% of
the diet. The isotope values partially overlap
with the pre-A.D. 1300 Caddo burials, but
also evidence a temporal trend in C4
enrichment that continues into the Frankston
phase.
In the case of the Frankston phase Caddo
burials
examined
in
Wilson’s
bioarcheological study (Chapter 10, this
volume), the bioapatite values for this group
fall in one cluster that ranges from -9.1 ‰ to
-6.7 ‰. Stable carbon isotope values on
collagen from the Frankston phase burials
range from -9.7 ‰ to -14.8 ‰; this range
may hint that maize consumption was still
diverse at this time. These bioapatite and
collagen values in the main do indicate,
nevertheless, that these upper Neches River
Caddo had a diet based primarily on the
consumption of maize, with maize likely
contributing an increased ca. 50-70% of
their diet, and maize contributed more to the
diet of these Caddo than were documented
at either the Lang Pasture site or pre-A.D.
1300 burials in the region. The bioapatite
values of the Frankston phase burials from
the upper Neches are comparable to, if not
also higher in C4, than either Late Caddo
burials (-8.0 ‰ to -8.2 ‰) along the Red
River in Northeast Texas (see Perttula
2008b:Appendix IX) or northwestern
Louisiana (-8 ‰ to
-10.3 ‰, see Kelley
1997:Table 44). Both of these populations
were maize eaters, with maize probably
contributing 50-60% of the diet.
Bioapatite values for the Historic Caddo
burials from the upper Neches River basin
also fall in one cluster, with values ranging
from -4.8 ‰ to -7.4 ‰; collagen values
were also more enriched, ranging from only
-12.2 ‰ to -13.9 ‰. The overall trend in
these values when compared to the earlier
Frankston phase burial sample indicate that

Technical Report No. 174202

maize consumption had not leveled off by
ca. A.D. 1650, but had become even more
substantial after that time. The bioapatite
values suggest that maize comprised
between ca. 65-85% of the diet for these
upper Neches Caddo groups.
The stable carbon isotope data reviewed
above from the upper Neches River basin
convincingly establishes that there was an
increased reliance on maize agriculture after
ca. A.D. 1300—a reliance that never leveled
off. This increased consumption of corn,
when matched with the contemporaneous
increased use of cooking and storage jars
(most of them brushed), is one piece of
evidence that does not disprove that maize
intensification is matched by the increased
use of brushed (and other decorated utility
ware) cooking vessels in upper Neches
culinary traditions. This change in the
importance of certain kinds of decorated
cooking jars presumably represents the
product of individual and group decisions to
develop and adopt new strategies of food
cooking; this change had functional and
stylistic ramifications for the character of the
remainder of the ceramic vessel assemblage.
This does not mean that there may not be
other reasons that account for the increased
use of cooking jars (i.e., increase in
household size or composition, or an
increased incidence of communal feasting,
etc.) in upper Neches Caddo social groups,
but the evidence of maize intensification is
compelling. Locally, then, this change in
cuisine and culinary tradition expressed by
the ubiquitous utility ware cooking jar (often
brushed) appears to have taken place in the
latter part of the 14th century and/or early
part of the 15th century, about the time of the
Caddo occupation of the southern area at the
Lang Pasture site. As noted above, the
ceramic assemblage from the southern area
of the site is dominated by utility wares,
particularly brushed utility ware vessels.

Chapter 6: Ceramic Artifacts from the Lang Pasture Site (41AN38) and the Place of the Site Within an
Upper Neches River Basin Caddo Ceramic Tradtion

Mortuary Ceramics in the Upper Neches
River Basin
The basic composition of Caddo mortuary
vessel assemblages from upper Neches
River burial sites includes fine wares (73%),
decorated utility wares (15%), and a
significant proportion of plain ware vessels
(12%). Th choice of funerary offering is
clearly focused on the fine ware serving
vessels (and presumably their contents), as it
is in all prehistoric and early historic Caddo
mortuary vessel assemblages (see Kelley
1997; Perttula 2000).
The principal fine wares in all these
cemeteries are Poynor Engraved bowls and
carinated bowls (50% of the fine wares),
followed by Poynor Engraved bottles of
various forms (9%), Patton Engraved (13%),
Hood Engraved (12%) effigy ware vessels,
and Hume Engraved bottles (12%). Among
the utility wares, the major types include
Bullard Brushed (n=22% of the utility
wares), Killough Pinched (21%), Maydelle
Incised (12%), punctated jars (10%), and
brushed-punctated jars (8.5%). Most of the
plain wares are simple bowls (39% of the
plain wares), carinated bowls (31%), and
several forms of bottles (22%). In upper
Neches River basin sites, Killough Pinched
jars are present only in sub-phase 2
Frankston phase contexts, while Maydelle
Incised vessels are predominant in ca. A.D.
1400-1480 contexts, diminishing in later
times. What stands out among the utility
wares from mortuary contexts in the upper
Neches is the frequency of vessels with
brushed decorations: 37% of all the utility
ware vessels are brushed.
The vessels from upper Neches cemeteries
fall into five basic vessel forms, and with a
number of distinctive sub-forms based on
rim and lip treatment, as well as the addition
of handles and effigy appendages: carinated
bowls, bowls, bottles, jars, and compound
bowls. Carinated bowls are by far the most
abundant mortuary offering, accounting for
48.5-63% of all the vessels; this relative

314

proportion peaks during the late (sub-phase
3) Frankston phase, and continues in the
Allen phase. Mortuary vessels in upper
Neches River Caddo sites were made in a
wide variety of sizes. In most cases, the
vessels included with the deceased by his
living relatives easily would have held
multiple servings of food and liquids. There
is a clear trend towards the use of very large
carinated bowls (food serving vessels) after
ca. A.D. 1480—well-suited for communal
food serving—suggesting that the vessels
may have been intended by the Caddo to
meet multiple and changing purposes in
mortuary rituals. These could have included
use of the vessels in grave-side rituals and
daily food offerings by the relatives of the
deceased, after which they were placed in
the graves as final accompaniment once the
“Sixth Day Feast” had been concluded. PreA.D. 1480 cemeteries in the upper Neches
have only a range of small to medium-sized
vessels, probably destined for individual
use.
As was the practice with the manufacture of
upper Neches River basin Caddo ceramics
that were used in domestic contexts, the
mortuary vessels from the region were
predominantly
tempered
with
grog,
regardless of the Frankston phase sub-phase
to which the vessels can be assigned. Grog
is commonly the sole tempering inclusion,
but more often than not, was the principal
temper in conjunction with smaller amounts
of crushed and burned bone and crushed and
angular hematite pieces. Less than 7% of
the vessels—with the exception of the Lang
Pasture site—were tempered solely with
aplastics other than grog. Bone temper,
however, was a popular temper inclusion
used throughout the Frankston phase for
vessels placed in burials. Overall, the
frequency of bone-tempered pottery in the
mortuary vessels ranges from 12-52%. By
comparison, sherds from domestic contexts
at these sites, including the Lang Pasture
site, are much less likely to have been
tempered with bone. For instance, at Lang
Pasture, between 9-20.5% of the sherds by

Technical Report No. 174202

Archeological Investigations at the Lang Pasture Site (41AN38) in the Upper Neches River Basin of East Texas
Texas Department of Transportation

site area were tempered with bone, less than
half the amount identified in the mortuary
vessels. Sherd samples from other upper
Neches River sites (see below) tend to have
less than 5% bone-tempered sherds in the
assemblages, irrespective of their ages.
Because of these dramatic temper
differences in domestic vs. mortuary
ceramics, vessels placed in mortuary
contexts appear to have been made in
different ways by individual potters, solely
to accompany the deceased rather than to
conform to domestic preferences.
Another indication of differences in the
character of domestic vs. mortuary ceramic
vessels concerns how the vessels were fired.
After ca. A.D. 1400, mortuary ceramics
were very commonly fired in a high oxygen
environment, or were incompletely oxidized.
By site, these two methods of firing
comprise between 47-85% of all the vessels
in the post-A.D. 1400 detailed analysis
sample (see Table 6-33), very much
different than the Lang Pasture vessels.
As a consequence of ceramic practice
differences in firing, many of the vessels
found in Caddo mortuary contexts have a
reddish to reddish-brown color because of
high oxygen firing, rather than the darker
gray, grayish-brown, or black colors that
would have resulted from firing in a
reducing environment. However, firing
vessels in a reducing environment, but
cooling them in the open air would have had
a similar effect, at least in terms of the color
of the fired pots, as the open air cooling
would leave a thin oxidized interior and/or
exterior surface. Technologically, if the goal
was to produce a vessel of a certain color
and durability, it seems to have made more
sense to fire the pot red-hot in an oxidizing
fire, as the Frankston phase Caddo potters
chose to do, and thus be able to see when a
pottery vessel was done and could be
removed from the fire, then it was to gauge
the right time to remove a pot from a firing
when it was smothered in a bed of coals and
ashes. This technological change or firing

Technical Report No. 174202

preference appears to have become part of
the upper Neches River ceramic tradition—
at least with respect to the manufacture of
mortuary vessels—after ca. A.D. 1480 to
A.D. 1560 (sub-phases 2 and 3 of the
Frankston phase).
Both red and white clay pigments were used
regularly on upper Neches mortuary vessels.
Red pigments were exclusively used on a
few bowls and effigy bowls, and almost
exclusively on bottles. Among the carinated
bowls, about one-quarter had a white clay
pigment, particularly the carinated bowls
from post-ca. A.D. 1560 Frankston phase
cemeteries. White clay pigment began to
supplant the red clay pigment after ca. A.D.
1560 on mortuary vessels up to ca. A.D.
1560. The symbolic meaning and use of
different pigments on mortuary vessels point
to the likelihood that cosmological and
world views of the Caddo peoples living in
the upper Neches began to change after ca.
A.D. 1480, but these new views came to
dominate beliefs and mortuary ritual usage
after ca. A.D. 1560 and continued into early
historic period times.
Upper Neches River Basin Caddo
Ceramic Tradition
The existence of a distinctive prehistoric
Caddo ceramic tradition (dating from ca.
A.D. 1320-1700) in the upper Neches River
basin has been known for many years (cf.
Suhm and Krieger 1954; Suhm and Jelks
1962; Shafer 1981; Kleinschmidt 1982;
Story and Creel 1982), although not to the
extent we are now able to trace and
document it, and lies behind the recognition
and definition of the Frankston and Allen
phases in this region (see Figure 6-70). By
ceramic tradition, I mean a single, coherent,
community of technological and stylistic
practice specific to the Caddo peoples of
this area. This tradition is consistent with a
broad unity in culture and material culture
production, as well as a shared native
history, one developed through centuries of
intermarriage, trade, transmission of

315

Chapter 6: Ceramic Artifacts from the Lang Pasture Site (41AN38) and the Place of the Site Within an
Upper Neches River Basin Caddo Ceramic Tradtion

learning, and other kinds of reciprocal
relationships.
The analysis of the ceramics from the Lang
Pasture site (41AN38), as well as sherds and
vessels from a number of other broadly
contemporaneous and younger Caddo sites
in the basin (see Figure 6-1), has
considerably refined our understanding of
this prehistoric Caddo ceramic tradition.
Crucial to this development is the detailed
stylistic and technological information that
has been obtained on sites with burials and
mortuary vessels that were used for short
periods of time within this ca. 380 year
chronological sequence. Also important to
anchoring the beginnings of this ceramic
tradition, and laying the framework for
tracing stylistic changes in the ceramic fine
wares, is the fact that the Lang Pasture site
appears to be the earliest of the known sites
within this tradition. Grog-tempering is the
key component of this ceramic tradition.
Poynor Engraved is by far the most common
fine ware type in the upper Neches River
basin Caddo ceramic tradition, in both
domestic and mortuary contexts. Its most
distinctive and unifying characteristic, at
least in the case of the defined varieties to be
discussed in a moment, is the use of rim
panels on carinated bowls (whether with
direct or inverted rims or shouldered or
globular forms)—or a rim panel decoration
turned vertically on bottles—that have
distinctive dividers, creating central
rectangular, oval, negative oval, and semi­
circular elements. In some cases, there are
additional decorative elements within the
area created by the dividers, including
hatched triangles, pendant triangles, circles,
punctate-filled circles, or circles with spurs
or ticks. The five defined varieties of Poynor
Engraved are found at most of the sites in
the upper Neches, as well as in sherd
assemblages from domestic and mound
components. Poynor Engraved, var. Hood is
the most widespread of the defined varieties,
followed by Poynor Engraved, var.
Blackburn. Poynor Engraved, var. Lang is

316

the least widespread of the defined varieties.
The other varieties are Poynor Engraved,
var. Cook and var. Freeman. The analysis of
these varieties of Poynor Engraved, in
combination with the examination of the
later
Patton
Engraved
type,
has
demonstrated
the
unbroken
stylistic
connection between the latest variety of
Poynor Engraved—var. Freeman—and the
earliest of the distinctive Patton Engraved
vessels, namely Patton Engraved, var.
Freeman, as well as the earlier stylistic
change from Poynor Engraved, var. Hood to
var. Freeman (see Figure 6-63).
The earliest site that belongs to this
tradition—the Lang Pasture site—has none
of these defined Poynor Engraved varieties,
but it shares the practice of using grog
temper in vessel manufuacture. But there are
also a number of regional varieties of
Poynor Engraved, some of which are present
in the earliest contexts at sites throughout
the upper Neches River basin and in
widespread 14th century contexts in parts of
East Texas. These varieties also feature a
diverse range and combination of stylistic
elements, principal among them nested
triangles, nested ovals, and nested circles;
scrolls of various sorts; hatched pendant,
stacked, and nested triangles; cross-hatched
ladders and panels; hooked arms; concentric
ovals; and sets of diagonal lines with small
pendant triangles. The most common
regional varieties of Poynor Engraved are
var. F (nested ovals/triangles and diagonal
cross-hatched ladders, also local variety 1 at
the Lang Pasture site), var. E (scroll and
circle), and var. B (interlocking scrolls).
Var. F vessels have also been reported from
sites in the upper Sabine River basin that
date to the 14th century, indicating a wider
and perhaps earlier distribution to some of
these more unique Poynor Engraved styles.
The other regional varieties are represented
by vessels from only a few sites.
More than 57% of the Poynor Engraved
vessels at the Lang Pasture site can be
assigned to one of these regional varieties;

Technical Report No. 174202

Archeological Investigations at the Lang Pasture Site (41AN38) in the Upper Neches River Basin of East Texas
Texas Department of Transportation

the other 43% are specific local varieties of
Poynor Engraved seen only at Lang Pasture
and currently at one or two other sites in the
region. In the broader upper Neches River
basin mortuary vessel assemblages, these
numerous regional varieties are most
abundant in pre-A.D. 1480 contexts (61%),
with a significant drop off in ca. A.D. 1480­
1560 (12%) and ca. A.D. 1560-1650 (20%)
mortuary contexts. This suggests that prior
to A.D. 1480, and reaching back into the
early to mid-14th century A.D. when the
Lang Pasture site was occupied and
distinctive regionally specific fine ware
styles were beginning to be created, the
favoring of stylistic innovations and the
individual work of specific artisans, were
what led to the wide diversity or variety in
Poynor Engraved rim motif styles at that
time. This suggests that pottery learning at
this time was primarily between parent and
child, usually in independent households
(McClure 2007:500 and Table 1).
Innovations and unique artistic expressions
with Poynor Engraved vessels eventually
began to diminish in favor of stylistic
conformity around a certain few rim panel
motifs. This uniformity suggests that fewer
people were making pottery (or a number of
potters from different households were
being taught how to make pottery from a
prominent teacher, cf. McClure 2007:501),
and thus after ca. A.D. 1480, specific
distinct styles/varieties of Poynor Engraved
may not have been made in each Caddo
settlement or community. Instead each style
of Poynor Engraved may have made by a
certain number of artisans living in specific
parts of the upper Neches River basin, and
the products were then traded and
exchanged throughout the region.
Other important fine wares include Hume
Engraved and Patton Engraved, with several
defined varieties in the upper Neches, as
well as Hood Engraved effigy vessels.
Seriation analysis of mortuary vessels
suggest that neither of the first two pottery
types began to be made until after ca. A.D.

Technical Report No. 174202

1480 (in the case of Hume Engraved, with
their distinctive elongated bodies) or after
ca. A.D. 1560 (in the case of Patton
Engraved). Hood Engraved effigy vessels
began to be made ca. A.D. 14008, and they
were most popular as mortuary offerings
between ca. A.D. 1400-1480; they continued
to be made and used through the Allen
phase. There are three known varieties, with
Hood Engraved, var. Hood being the most
common effigy vessel style. Hood
Engraved, var. Hood vessels occur in burial
and domestic contexts at a number of sites.
Hood Engraved, var. Allen effigy vessels,
however, are more concentrated in late
Frankston and Allen phase settlements and
cemeteries in the Caddo and Flat Creek
areas and in the Neches River valley itself
(see Figure 6-67).
Important utility wares include the
aforementioned Bullard Brushed, as well as
Maydelle Incised, rim punctated jars, and
Killough Pinched noded bowls and jars, the
latter including exuberant examples with
pedestal bases and pinched legs. Plain
vessels were an important part of the upper
Neches Caddo ceramic tradition, and in
addition to simple bowls, other plain wares
were made in the same shape as some of the
distinctive fine wares, as in the globular
carinated bowl form (Poynor Plain) or the
elongated body-short-necked bottle form
(Hume Plain).
The decorated and plain sherd assemblages
from post-A.D. 1400 Lake Palestine
domestic sites further illustrate the
commonalities of this Late Caddo ceramic
tradition. They are (1) almost exclusively
grog-tempered;
bone-tempered
pottery
comprises less than 3% of the sherds; (2)
brushed utility ware pottery from Bullard
Brushed vessels and other brushed utility
ware types dominates the decorated sherd
assemblages, accounting for between 49­
80% of all the decorated pottery; (3) fine
ware vessel sherds from Poynor Engraved
and Hood Engraved vessels account for less
than 10% of the decorated sherds; (4) wet

Upper Neches River Basin Caddo Ceramic Tradtion

paste decorations on sherds from Maydelle
Incised vessels and various unnamed utility
wares are also more abundant than fine
wares, accounting for between 10-42% of
the decorated sherds, by site; (5) fingernail
punctated sherds are rare (less than 3%) at
each site; and (6) plain to decorated sherd
ratios (P/DR) range from only 0.14-1.50,
with most of the sites having P/DR values
less than 0.72. Lake Palestine Caddo sites
dating after ca. A.D. 1400 did not have
many plain ware vessels.

all three forms are present in domestic
contexts. In other upper Neches River basin
sites, Var. A pipes are restricted to pre-A.D.
1480 components. Var. B pipes are present
in ca. A.D. 1400-1560 mortuary contexts, as
well as 15th century ceremonial contexts at
the A. C. Saunders site (41AN19), while
Var. C pipes occur from ca. A.D. 1400­
1650. Var. D-F are all apparently post-A.D.
1560 elbow pipe forms in the upper Neches
River basin.
End Notes

A final part of the upper Neches River
Caddo ceramic tradition was the practice of
clay elbow pipe manufacture in various
forms and decorative styles. Clay pipes are
found in both domestic and mortuary
contexts throughout the upper Neches River
basin, and pipes were made locally for daily
use, as well as for use in mortuary rituals.
Elbow pipes changed in form and decoration
through time from a common beginning in
the 14th century, beginning with plain Lshaped forms (Var. A elbow pipes),
followed by flaring bowl forms with distal
stem knobs; these pipes (Var. B) have three
engraved or deep incised lines on the stem
and short lines on the lower bowl. Var. C
pipes have engraved/incised lines on the
stem, and lines on the pipe that extend along
the entirety of the stem and basal portions of
the bowl. In Var. D pipes, the parallel
engraved or incised lines extending along
the stem and the lower body are replaced by
long rows of small punctations. Var. E
elbow pipes are the first forms that are
completely covered with decoration, in this
case curvilinear incised lines, and then later
by cross-hatched engraved lines (Var. F
elbow pipes). These particular styles of
decoration, and combination of decorative
elements, on the clay elbow pipes is
particular to the upper Neches River basin
(cf. Jackson 1933).
Var. A-C elbow pipe forms are present at
the Lang Pasture site. The pipes from
mortuary contexts are Var. A forms, while

318

1. A total of 23 sherds were submitted for
TL dating, but no TL dates were obtained
from two of these (UW1709 and UW1721).
The first is a pinched body sherd from the
southern ceramic component/area, and the
second is a parallel brushed body sherd from
the southern ceramic component/area.
2. Given the Caddo potter’s penchant for
decorating pottery vessels with one kind of
decoration on the rim, and a different
decoration on the vessel body, analysis of
the rim decorations do not provide a
comprehensive view of the range of
decorated utility wares. Categories of
decorative methods represented in the utility
wares that have only a few or no rims are
likely indicative of those decorative methods
used only (or primarily) on the vessel body,
while those categories with a fair proportion
of decorated rims to total sherds are more
likely to include vessels decorated in
comparable fashion by the same decorative
method on both the vessel rim and body.
3. More far-flung examples of decorated
Caddo pottery that resemble these early
varieties of Poynor Engraved include three
vessels from 14th century shaft burials from
the Washington Square Mound (41NA49) in
the Angelina River basin (Hart 1982:Figure
3-13). These three vessels have rectangular
panels with hatched triangles at the corners
of each panel, as well as central elements,
including circles (as with Poynor Engraved,
var. Blackburn, see Figure 6-63b’) or

Technical Report No. 174202

Archeological Investigations at the Lang Pasture Site (41AN38) in the Upper Neches River Basin of East Texas
Texas Department of Transportation

hooked arm scrolls (as with Poynor
Engraved, var. N or P, see Figure 6-64).
Hatched triangular panels or triangularshaped elements with hatched corners,
creating negative ovals, as well as
concentric ovals, are elements seen on
engraved vessel rims and body sherds from
at least three different vessels at the 14th
century Bryan Hardy site (41SM55) in the
Sabine River basin (Walters and Haskins
2000:Figures 17i-j and 22a-c) and in the
14th-early 15th century ceramics from the
Redwine site (41SM193) (Walters et al.
1998:Figure 14a). One incised-punctated jar
from the site has a nested oval and triangle
motif, otherwise comparable to Poynor
Engraved, var. F (Walters and Haskins
2000:Figure 19). The well-dated Leaning
Rock site (41SM325) in the upper Sabine
River basin, with calibrated dates ranging
from AD 1280-1420 (and a mean of the
calibrated intercepts of AD 1349), has at
least one rim with a vertical engraved panel
and triangular hatched corners (Walters
2008:30).
4. For example, at the late 17th-early 18th
century Allen phase Deshazo site (41NA27),
only white pigments (n=27 sherds) were
noted on the engraved fine wares (Fields
1995:187-197).
5. Poynor Engraved and/or Patton Engraved
sherds from likely upper Neches River
Caddo sources have been documented in a
number of Central Texas Toyah phase sites
(Ricklis and Collins 1994:Figures 142b and
155), north Texas Blackland Prairie sites
(Crook 2007:53 and Figure 6; Crook and
Hughston 2008), north central Texas
prehistoric sites (Bruseth and Martin
1987:Figures 8-2d-e, 8-3c), east central
Texas aboriginal sites (Fields 2004:Figure
12.14c, g; Gadus et al. 2002:Figure 50f-g),
Spanish mission sites in South Texas (Fox
and Tomka 2006:81, Walter 2007:91-93), as
well as a ca. A.D. 1450-1684 aboriginal
component at the Loma Alta site (41PS15)
in the Junta de los Rios area of west Texas
(Kelley 1986:83 and Plate IIa). Gregory and

Technical Report No. 174202

Avery (2007:44) have recovered Patton
Engraved at the 18th century Spanish
mission at Los Adaes in northwestern
Louisiana. Suhm and Krieger (1954:344)
have commented that Poynor Engraved
“appears to have been the most widely
traded Caddoan pottery among tribes living
west of the Caddo.”
6. Feathers (Appendix C, this volume)
suggests that one of the sherds submitted for
TL dating (a parallel brushed body sherd
from the southern area), was likely also from
a vessel not made at the Lang Pasture site.
The radioactivity of this one sherd
(UW1721) indicated that it contained
unusually high concentrations of K, unlike
the other Lang Pasture sherds and
accompanying sediment samples submitted
as part of the TL dating, and likely came
from a vessel made from a different clay
source.
7. In a case study from the Oak Hill Village,
where paleobotanical remains from feature
flotation samples were abundant from three
sequential village components, as were
brushed pottery sherds, the ubiquity of
maize in features closely tracks the
proportion of brushed utility wares. In the
ca. A.D. 1150-1250 village, the percentage
of brushed sherds in the decorated sherd
assemblage is 15.3% and maize ubiquity is
31.6%. In the ca. A.D. 1250-1350 village,
maize ubiquity increases to 50% and the
percentage of brushed sherds is 24.4%. By
the time of the late village, dating from ca.
A.D. 1350-1450, maize ubiquity is 96.9%,
and brushed sherds comprise 48.7% of the
decorated sherds in this component (Perttula
2001:Table 5).
8. The timing in the appearance of effigy
vessels in the upper Neches region is of
interest, given previous discussion of how
the overall character of the region’s ceramic
assemblages changed with the increasing
prevalence of cooking jars, especially
brushed cooking jars, at the time of an
increased consumption of maize in the

Caddo’s diet. That finding leads to a
question about one possible meaning of the
effigy vessels, particularly the very common
use of a bird’s head appendage on effigy
vessels, and a corresponding speculation,
following up a review of North American
Indian maize myths by Lankford (2008:37).
Lankford makes the point that in these
myths, maize is commonly described in a

320

“maize-as-a-gift” tradition, as in a gift from
a divinity or their emissary; this is the case
among the Caddo, for instance (Lankford
2008:Figure 2.1). One of those emissaries is
a bird. Perhaps, then, the bird on the effigy
bowls made by the upper Neches Caddo is a
unique symbolic representation of the bird
emissary that brought corn in all its
abundance to these Caddo people.

CHAPTER 7
7LITHIC ANALYLSIS
Donald G. Hunter

7.1

INTRODUCTION

The data recovery excavations at Lang
Pasture produced an abundance of lithic
artifacts, which include a number of finished
tools and a large sample of debitage. A
preliminary analysis of the diagnostic lithic
artifacts was made, and revealed that the site
had multiple occupations beginning in the
Early Archaic period and ending in the Late
Caddo period. Because of the sandy nature
of the local soils and mixing of deposits
through
bioturbation,
other
natural
processes, and human-related activities, it
became apparent that much of the debitage
resulting from these multiple occupations
had been mixed and was of little value for
addressing research questions of interest.
This was regarded as especially true of the
samples obtained from non-feature contexts.
The debitage recovered from selected
features was analyzed to determine whether
these collections had any research utility,
but the following analysis focuses on the
diagnostic lithic artifacts.
7.2

ARTIFACT DESCRIPTIONS

Arrow Points
Eighty compete and partial arrow points
were identified in the data recovery lithic
sample (Table 7-1). Of that number, 30
(37.5 percent) could not be assigned to a
particular type because they lacked sortable
attributes due to breakage or the stage of
manufacture at the time of loss or
abandonment, or because diagnostic

Technical Report No. 174202

morphology was not clear present. The
remaining 50 (62.5 percent) were
categorized to one of several previously
established types commonly encountered at
archeologicalsites in eastern and northcentral Texas. Where arrow points or points
resembled a certain type but could not be
assigned to that category with any degree of
confidence, they were noted as being
"similar to" that type (abbreviated as "sim."
in the following text and tables).
Steiner Arrow Points
Steiner arrow points were the most common
type recovered during the data recovery
excavations. They were represented by 18
examples, accounting for 36 percent of the
identified arrow points (Figure 7-1, a-o).
They are easily recognized by pronounced
or exaggerated serrations or protrusions
often placed at irregular intervals along the
blade edges, as well as a lack of general
symmetry in many instances (cf., Davis
1991:254-255;
Turner
and
Hester
1999:232). Most appear to have been made
of local materials, including chert, quartzite,
and silicified wood derived from water-worn
cobbles, pebbles, or tabular fragments. A
relatively high percentage (78 percent)
appear to have been heat treated. Metric
data relating to the Steiner arrow points in
this sample are presented in Table 7-1. As
can be seen, roughly 28 percent of the
Steiner arrow points were made by means of
unifacial work on flakes. Turner and Hester
(1999:232) assign the Steiner type to the
Late Prehistoric period

Additionally, only two (13 percent) appear
to have been thermally altered. Here, again,
metric data relating to the Perdiz arrow
points in this collection are presented in
Table 7-1. It should be noted that at least 44
percent of the Perdiz arrow points were
made by unifacial working of flakes, a
substantially greater proportion than the
Steiner arrow points described above.

(ca. A.D. 700-1600) and note it as primarily
occurring in eastern Texas, where it pertains
to the Caddo period. Davis (1991:254)
suggests a somewhat more limited
chronological position of ca. A.D. 800-1400,
a range that would encompass the
Formative, Early, and Middle Caddo periods
(Perttula 2004a:378). Prewitt (1995:131)
shows this type being most commonly
reported from sites in east-central Texas.

Perdiz arrow points are common at sites in
Central and South Texas, and occur in
Caddo sites in the Sabine, Cypress, and
Neches-Angelina river basins. Turner and
Hester (1999:227) suggest a date range of
ca. A.D. 1200-1500. Perdiz is the main
arrow point diagnostic of the Toyah phase of
Central Texas, dated to ca. A.D. 1300-1700
(Prewitt 1985).

Perdiz Arrow Points
Perdiz arrow points (n=16) are the second
most common type recovered (see Table 7­
1), and account for 32 percent of the
identified arrow points (Figure 7-2c-q).
This type is characterized by a triangular
blade; pronounced barbs; and a relatively
long, contracting, and sometimes pointed
stem (cf., Suhm and Jelks 1962:283-284;
Davis 1991:244-245; Turner and Hester
1999:227). Unlike the Steiner arrow points
discussed above, most of the Perdiz in this
sample were made of cherts with possible
geologic origins in the Edwards Plateau,
although Edwards cherts can also be
obtained as outwash from Uvalde gravels in
East Texas rivers such as the Brazos,
Trinity,
Navasota,
and
Neches.

Catahoula Arrow Points
Twelve of the arrow points in this sample,
representing 24 percent of the identified
total, were classified as the Catahoula type
or probable Catahoula (see Table 7-1).

above, the Catahoula appear to have been

made primarily of local cherts, quartzites,
and silicified woods, with half showing
signs of thermal alteration. One Catahoula
made of grayish-yellow novaculite is also
present in this sample. Several of these
arrow points have serrated blade edges
resembling, in some respects, the treatment
found on some of the Steiner points. Metric
data relative to the Catahoula and Steiner
arrow points contain similar figures.
The Catahoula points, however, have a
somewhat
greater
average
width.
Additionally, most of the Catahoula arrow
points (75 percent) were not unifacially
flaked, which also makes them similar to the
Steiner arrow points in this collection.
Catahoula arrow points are normally
associated with Coles Creek- and
Mississippian-period sites in the Tensas
Basin of the Lower Mississippi Valley,
where they have been recovered in dated
contexts between ca. A.D. 900-1300 (Hunter
et al. 1995, 1999). Limited numbers have
been found in northwestern Louisiana,
several in Formative or Early Caddo Period
contexts at Mounds Plantation (Webb and
McKinney 1975:Table 3). Catahoula points
have also been recovered from sites in East
Texas.
Bassett Arrow Points
Two Bassett arrow points, representing 4
percent of the identified total, were
recovered (see Table 7-1 and Figure 7-2a-b).
Both are small and feature the triangular
blade, pronounced barbs, and small pointed
stem characteristic of this type (cf. Suhm
and Jelks 1962:265-266; Turner and Hester
1999:201; Davis 1991:194-195). Both were
unifacially flaked on flakes, possibly of nonlocal origin (see Table 7-1). The materials
include a light gray novaculite and an
opaque, white chert.

northwestern Louisiana has been given as
ca. A.D. 1200-1500 (Webb 1981). In Texas,
this type seems to have been in use during
the Late Caddo and Historic Caddo periods,
with estimated date ranges of ca. A.D. 1400­
1700 (Turner and Hester 1999:201; Davis
1991:194). Apparently, Bassett points were
not in use during the early historic period at
Caddo sites in Louisiana, based on
excavations at the McLelland and Joe Clark
sites in Bossier Parish (Kelley 1994).
Other Arrow Points
Two additional arrow points were recovered
that cannot be assigned to established types.
The first (Figure 7-2r) has a triangular
shape, with a deep concave base, prominent
barbs, and distinctive blade notches. One
side of the arrow point displays a breakage
pattern, commonly referred to as an impact
burination. Several Late Caddo sites in the
Ouachita Mountain area of west central
Arkansas have produced arrow points that
appear very similar to the point from the
Lang Pasture site. They have the same
triangular shape, relatively deep basal
concavity, and distinctive blade notches.
They were classified as Maud, var. Hopper,
arrow points (Early 1988:107-109, 2000:86­
87).
The second point placed under this heading
is made of brown chert (see Figure 7-2s). It
has an expanding stem and a rounded base,
which makes it similar in appearance to a
Bulbar Stemmed (cf., Turner and Hester
1999:203; Davis 1991:198-199). However,
that type is common only along the central
and southern Texas Gulf coast, far distant
from the Lang Pasture site. Because of this,
the point is only considered vaguely similar
to the type Bulbar Stemmed, a type normally
associated with the Late Prehistoric and
Historic periods in that general area of
Texas (Turner and Hester 1999:203).

Bassett arrow points primarily occur at sites
in East Texas and adjoining parts of
Louisiana.

Unclassified Arrow Points
As noted above, 30 of the arrow points in
this collection could not be classified. Most
were partial, lacking diagnostic sorting
attributes, while others were unfinished.
Five of these had attributes similar to Perdiz
arrow points, but they could not be sorted as
such with any degree of certainty. Four
specimens (see Figure 7-1y-bb) have stem
shapes similar to Steiner points, but lack the
blade-edge
serrations/spurs
that
are
distinctive of that type.
Points
The term "point" is used herein to denote a
class of bifacially worked artifacts that have
a proximal haft preparation and a pointed
distal end. The term "projectile point"
implies a specific function—that of the head
of a missile, such as a spear, dart, or arrow.
Because it is usually impossible to
determine the specific use of such artifacts
without microscopic analysis and use-wear
replication, the latter term, which has this
specific functional implication, is avoided.
Although some examples of this artifact
class might have indeed served as projectile
points, many could have also functioned as
hafted knives or scraping tools. Thirty-three
whole and fragmentary points were
classified as belonging to this general
artifact category; only 24 (72 percent) were
categorized as belonging to a previously
identified type. These artifacts are usually
be termed “dart points” in the Texas
archeologicalliterature (e.g., Turner and
Hester 1999).
Andice Points
Two partial Andice points are in the data
recovery sample from the Lang Pasture site
(Table 7-2). Both (Figure 7-3h-i) are well
made of a light gray chert, possibly derived
from the Edwards Plateau. They account for
8 percent of the identified points. One lacks
its distal end as well as one barb. The other
lacks its stem, one barb, and its distal end.

326

This type is characterized by its large size,
convex blade edges, and deep and narrow
basal notches that form a rectangular stem.
Its extremely long barbs extend to the base
of the point (cf., Prewitt 1983; Turner and
Hester 1999:71-72; Davis 1991:26-27).
Andice points are typically thin and well
made; the extremely large barbs were prone
to breakage. Metric data on these two points
from the Lang Pasture site are provided in
Table 7-2. Andice points are most
commonly found in east-central Texas but
have been reported southward over large
parts of the coastal plain. They date ca.
4050-3050 B.C. (Turner and Hester
1999:71; Davis 1991:26), an interval
generally considered to pertain to the Early
Archaic in Central Texas (e.g., Prewitt
1985), but more recently (Johnson and
Goode 1994; Collins 1995) designated as
Middle Archaic, in line with a general time
span of ca. 6000-4000 B.P. (cal.) for East
Texas (Perttula 2004:9).
Axtell Points
Axtell is an old type name revitalized by
Prewitt and Chandler (1992). This is a
small- to medium-sized point with a fairly
narrow, triangular blade.
The main
distinguishing characteristic of this type is
its large, bulbous stem formed by shallow
corner or side notches. Axtell points occur
most frequently in east-central Texas. This
type is believed to date to the late part of the
Middle Archaic period, from about 3000­
2000 B.C., which would be the early part of
the Late Archaic in East Texas It is possible
that this point was also in use during the
Late Archaic (Prewitt and Chandler 1992;
Turner and Hester 1999). Two points in the
present sample, representing 8 percent of the
identified specimens, were classified as
Axtell points (see Figure 7-3a-b and Table
7-2).
They were made of brown or
brownish gray cherts. No evidence of
thermal alteration was noted on either.

Edgewood Point
One point, also representing four percent of
the identified sample, was classified as an
Edgewood point (see Figure 7-3g and Table
7-2). This is a relatively small cornernotched point with a wide stem and concave
base. In many instances, the stem on
Edgewood points is as wide as the widest
part of the blade (cf., Suhm and Jelks
1962:183-184; Turner and Hester 1999:111;
Davis 1991:70-71). The Edgewood point
from the Lang Pasture site is made of a
brown chert with no visible signs of thermal
alteration.

temporal placement, a period pertaining to
the Woodland period in East Texas.
Ensor Point
One point, constituting 4 percent of the
identified sample, was classified as an Ensor
point (see Figure 7-3f and Table 7-2). This
type is characterized by a narrow, triangular
blade and small corner or side notches that
produce a wide expanding stem with a flat
base (cf., Suhm and Jelks 1962:189-190;
Turner and Hester 1999:114; Davis
1991:76-80).
The example from Lang
Pasture is small in comparison to most of the

other points in the sample. It is well made

black, chert presumably of non-local
derivation.

most numerous of the point types at Lang
Pasture (n=8). Several specimens appear to
have reworked (and therefore shortened)
blade portions (Figure 7-4a-d).

Ensor points are common in Central and
south-central Texas (Turner and Hester
1999:114; Prewitt 1995:103; Davis 1991).
They appear to date to the Late Archaic or
Woodland periods with estimated date
ranges of ca. 200 B.C.-A.D. 600 (Turner and
Hester 1999:114) or ca. 1000 B.C.-A.D. 500
(Davis 1991).

Hoxie Point

Dawson Points
According to Turner and Hester (1999:102),
this is an East Texas type; they assign it,
very roughly, to the “Middle Archaic.”
Given that these authors generally use
Archaic period designations as they have
been defined for Central and southern
Texas, it is possible that Dawson points fall
into the Late Archaic as defined for East
Texas (i.e., ca. 4000-2000 years B.P.; see
Perttula 2004:9.

One point, accounting for four percent of the
identified sample, is classified as a Hoxie
(see Figure 7-3e and Table 7-2). It was
made from a dark gray, almost black chert,
presumed to be of non-local origin. This is
an Early Archaic type, characterized by its
long,
slender
blade,
expanding-to­
rectangular stem, weak shoulders, normally
concave base, and stem edge grinding (cf.,
Davis 1991:58-59; Turner and Hester
1999:101). Beveling of the edges and stem
occurs on some examples of this type. The
point from the Lang Pasture site has ground
stem edges and base, but no alternative
beveling of the blade. Hoxie points are
common in central and south-central Texas.
They are thought to date to the latter part of
the Early Archaic, ca. 6,000 B.C. (Prewitt
1985; Collins 2004)

One point in the collection (Figure 7-3d) is
largely complete and made from a brown
chert. Its triangular blade is finely serrated
and somewhat asymmetrical, one edge being
straight and the other concave. The stem is
rectangular with a slightly convex base. Its
shoulders are pronounced but not barbed. A
second specimen (Figure 7-4o) has distinct
but unbarbed shoulders, convex blade edges,
and a slightly contracting stem.

Palmillas points have a widespread
distribution across the southern half of
Texas (Prewitt 1995:125; Turner and Hester
1999:167; Davis 1991:146). They appear to
be associated with a date range of ca. 1500
B.C.-500 B.C. (Davis 1991:146), and thus
fall into te Late Archaic as defined for East
Texas (Perttula 2004:9).

Gary Points

One point, representing 4 percent of the
identified total, was classified as a Palmillas
point (cf. Suhm and Jelks 1962:229-230;
Turner and Hester 1999:167; Davis
1991:146-147) (see Figure 7-3c). It is a
relatively narrow point that has wide side
notches, an expanding stem, and a rounded
base. The point is made of a light gray
chert, possibly derived from the Edwards
Plateau.It appears to have been resharpened
and has hinge stacks on both faces.

Gary points are primarily found in eastern
Texas. Age estimate ranges include Late
Archaic to Woodland periods—ca. 2000
B.C.-A.D. 500 (Davis 1991:94) or ca. 2500
B.C.-A.D. 800 (Turner and Hester
1999:123). However, Schambach (1982)
dates Gary points ato the period from ca.
500 B.C. to A.D. 700, suggesting that they
are best thought of as Woodland period
points (see Perttula 2004:9). This is the

Yarbrough Points
Six points in the sample (25 percent of the
identified total) were classified as
Yarbrough points (cf. Suhm and Jelks
1962:261-262; Turner and Hester 1999:197;
Davis 1991:182-183).

330

Four are complete, while two are missing
the distal ends (see Figure 7-4, i-n and
Tables 7-3-7-4). All have relatively narrow,
triangular blades; wide, rectangular-to­
slightly expanding stems; straight-to-slightly
convex bases; and weak shoulders formed
by broad, shallow side notches. Three were
made of light gray chert, perhaps derived
from the Edwards Plateau. The remaining

Technical Report No. 174202

Archeological Investigations at the Lang Pasture Site (41AN38) in the Upper Neches River Basin of East Texas

three were made of thermally altered
quartzites and chert.
Yarbrough points most commonly occur in
eastern Texas (Davis 1991:182; Prewitt
1995:137; Turner and Hester 1999:196).
They probably date to the early part of the
Late Archaic as defined in East Texas.
Davis (1991:182) suggests a date range for
this type of ca. 3000-1000 B.C..
Preforms
The lithics recovered during the data
recovery excavations at the Lang Pasture
site included 27 artifacts that have been
classified as preforms. Technically, these
represent debitage, because they are
unfinished items discarded for various
reasons. However, they are discussed here
with the diagnostic lithic artifacts to
facilitate distributional analyses (discussed
below) used to identify possible specific use
areas within the site. Of the 27, 21 were
probably preforms for arrow points, as
indicated by their relatively small size,
thickness, and general shape, as well as
rudimentary stems or barbs on some of the
more advanced-stage examples. There is a
good deal of variability in this general
group. Some were merely flakes that had
been trimmed to begin subsequent shaping
and thinning. Others had been shaped to the
extent of having some of the defining
characteristics of arrow points.
The
remaining six appear to have been for much
larger artifacts, such as the dart points
described above. Five of these six were
broken.
Four-Beveled Biface
The collection from the Lang Pasture site
contains a nearly complete four-beveled
biface (cf. Turner and Hester 1999:274-276;
Davis 1991:408-409) (see Figure 7-2v).
These particular artifacts, sometimes called
Harahey Knives (e.g., Johnson 1994) are
found in Late Prehistoric and Historic sites
throughout Texas and have been commonly

Technical Report No. 174202

found in association with bison kill and
processing sites. Age estimates range from
ca. A.D. 700-1600 (Davis 1991:408) to ca.
A.D. 1300-1750 (Turner and Hester
1999:274). In his Central Texas chronology,
Prewitt (1985) assigns this artifact form to
the Toyah phase, dating to ca. A.D. 1300­
1700.
The material is a mottled brown and creamcolored, very fine-grained, chert that was
found to fluoresce a strong orange color
under ultra-violet light.
This strongly
suggests that the material is Edwards chert.
Perforators
Two perforators were recognized in the
chipped stone from the Lang Pasture site
(see Figure 7-2). Both appear complete and
were made from flakes. One was made of a
fine-grained thermally altered quartzite; the
other was manufactured from a brown chert.
Little effort was directed toward shaping
these tools. One is merely a long pointed
flake that received minimal trimming to
form its pointed distal end. The proximal
end is considerably wider, evidently to
facilitate handling. The other also has an
expanding base, the unmodified portion of
the parent flake. Somewhat more effort was
directed toward shaping its point, which is
completely bifacial.
Pitted Stones
Three pitted stones are in the sample (Figure
7-5a-c). Each is made of a small cobble or
tabular fragment of ironstone (ferruginous
sandstone), which is locally available. Two
of the stones have single pits, the other has
one pit on each face.
Palette or Grinding Slab Fragment
The data recovery sample contains one fairly
large tabular fragment of ironstone (see
Figure 7-5d). One face has been shaped into
a smooth, flat surface. The stone was
probably used for shaping implements made

of bone or wood. There are no grooves on
the artifact like those associated with
abraders.

relate to the number and age of occupations,
and also provide some information
concerning the distributions of these
artifacts across the site.

Celt Fragment
The collection from the Lang Pasture site
contains one small piece of dark, coarsegrained igneous stone that appears to be a
remnant of a ground-stone celt (Figure 7-6).
The fragment captures a small part of the bit
section, as may be seen in the profile view
shown in Figure 7-6. The material is similar
to stone found in the St. Francis Mountains
of southeastern Missouri, although other
source areas possibly exist in the Ouachita
Mountain area of western Arkansas, as well,
perhaps the most likely source area.

DIAGNOSTIC ARTIFACT
ANALYSIS

The analysis of diagnostic artifacts from the
data recovery excavations at the Lang
Pasture site make it possible to make some
interpretations concerning the prehistoric
occupation of the site. These primarily

Number and Age of Occupations
The diagnostic artifacts in this sample allow
some conclusions to be drawn concerning
the number and ages of site occupation.
Limited use of the site took place during the
Early Archaic, as evidenced by the single
Hoxie point from the site.
Sporadic
occupation occurred during the Middle
Archaic period, sometime around or after
4000 B.C.
This is evidenced by the
recovery of two partial Andice points, made
of a fine-grained chert, undoubtedly of nonlocal origin.
Several of the point types suggest a slightly
more substantial occupation on later Middle
Archaic or early Late Archaic time levels,
possibly around 3000 B.C. These types
include Axtell, Yarbrough, and Palmillas.

the Bit Section of a Ground-Stone Celt.
The profile view on the right clearly
shows the edge of the bit.

There seems to have been a shift towards the
use of some local stone at this time, as
indicated by several of these points being
made of thermally altered pebble cherts and
fine-grained quartzites. Sill, some use of
imported stone for tools is seen in the
occurrence of high quality, light gray
(Edwards Plateau?) cherts for making some
of the points.
Site occupation seems to have intensified by
the middle to latter parts of the Late Archaic
period (ca. 1000 B.C.) and lasted, certainly,
into the Woodland period. This is suggested
by a number of point types, including Ensor,
Edgewood, and Gary. Here, too, there
seems to have been continued use of local
pebble cherts, quartzites, and silicified wood
(most thermally altered), in addition to some
imported stone. The data at hand suggest
that during this general time period, use of
Ouachita Mountains novaculite began, albeit
on a very limited scale.
It is clear from the shear number of arrow
points in the sample that the most substantial
occupation of the site occurred on Caddo
time levels. The arrow points in this
collection have been sorted into four
previously established types, including

Technical Report No. 174202

Bassett, Catahoula, Perdiz, and Steiner.
Unfortunately the date ranges for these types
have not been precisely delineated.
Therefore, it is difficult to ascertain—using
the arrow points alone—whether there is one
or more Caddo occupations at the site, much
less the precise ages of the occupation(s).
While the estimated date ranges of some
arrow point types seem to overlap in time,
several studies have indicated that certain
types might be useful for general temporal
interpretations. For example, types such as,
Scallorn, Catahoula, and Steiner are
regarded as being earlier than types such as
Perdiz, Maud, and Fresno in north central
Texas (Prikryl 1990:Figure 24).
Story
(1990) maintains that in many parts of
eastern and east-central Texas, arrow points
with strongly expanded stems, such as
Scallorn, Colbert, Homan, or Agee,
represent the earliest types. Around A.D.
800, these begin to be replaced by "forms
having slightly expanded or rectangular
stems and, on some specimens, elaborations
of the blade" (Story 1990:251). These types
include Steiner, Catahoula, Friley, Alba,
Hayes, and Bonham. According to Story,
Perdiz arrow points appear to have been
introduced into this region around A.D.
1200, making them one of the latest types.
Accordingly, the arrow points from the Lang
Pasture site could be assigned to early and
late groupings, or clusters. The earliest
would be composed of the types Catahoula
and Steiner. The late cluster would include
the Perdiz and Bassett arrow points. Not
only do these temporally oriented groupings
seem reasonable in light of previous
research conducted in the region, but also in
regard to other characteristics observed in
this sample. First, there was apparently a
preference for the use of local stone for
making points in the early cluster, as
demonstrated by the fact that 74 percent of
the stone is thermally altered cherts,
quartzites, or silicified wood. In the late
cluster, this material category was used for

333

Chapter 7: Lithic Analysis

only 11 percent of the Bassett and Perdiz
arrow points. Furthermore, there seem to
have been some technological differences
between the two clusters, primarily in the
unifacial working of flakes to produce arrow
points. In the Bassett/Perdiz cluster, at least
72 percent of the arrow points were made
unifacially, as opposed to 35 percent in the
Catahoula/Steiner cluster.
With this in mind, it would appear that there
are two distinct Caddo occupations at the
site represented by the two arrow points
groups. The late cluster, composed of
Perdiz and Bassett arrow points, would fit
the ca. A.D. 1400 Frankston phase date
proposed for the Caddo occupation of the
site based on the recovered ceramic sherds
and vessels, and the majority of the
radiocarbon dates. However, most of the
classified arrow points (65 percent) appear
to date somewhat earlier. How much earlier
is impossible to determine at present,
because of the lack of precise date ranges for
the arrow point types.
It is possible, however, that these clusters
have no relation to temporal differences. For
example, at Lake Palestine, several
Frankston phase sites with possible minor
Alto phase or Sanders-like components
produced only Perdiz arrow points.
Conversely, several of those sites that did
not yield Alto or Sanders-like markers had
mainly
Catahoulas
with
a
good
representation of other types, including
Friley, Bonham, and Perdiz. Three of the
sites, all of which lacked Alto or Sanders
ceramic markers, produced only Perdiz
arrow points (Anderson et al. 1974:178).
The possible temporal implications of these
types or clusters is anything but clear and
should be a primary research consideration
for
future
archeologicalinvestigations
dealing with Caddo developments in this
part of Texas.

334

Horizontal Distributions of Diagnostic
Lithics
One of the tasks undertaken during this
analysis involved examining the horizontal
distribution of diagnostic lithic artifacts
recovered from the hand-excavated units.
This was done for several reasons. First, it
was undertaken to determine whether
temporal markers clustered in different
portions of the site. Second, it was done to
ascertain whether certain artifacts were
associated with particular features or sets of
features. Finally, it was hoped that specific
activity areas might be defined so that a
better understanding of site structure could
be obtained. To do this, a base map of the
excavation was developed, simply showing
the locations of each of the 1 x 1 m units
(scraped areas were omitted because of
limited control in those areas and the
relative paucity of artifacts recovered from
each). To facilitate a better understanding of
site structure, the locations of features were
added. On this base map, the probable wall
lines of three structures were also shown:
Structure 1 being the northernmost,
Structure 2 just to the south, and Structure 3
(a possible ramada) being immediately
adjacent to Structure 1. Letter symbols were
developed for each of the diagnostic artifacts
discussed above and simply placed in the
corresponding square for the excavation unit
from which they were recovered. Counts for
diagnostic artifacts recovered during site
testing are included for more complete
interpretations.
Arrow Points
The distribution of arrow points within the
hand-excavated units is depicted in Figure 7­

Area.

335

Chapter 7: Lithic Analysis

There seems to be a cluster of arrow points
in the extreme southern portion of the
excavated area, south of the Structure 2
location.
This area produced Steiner,
Catahoula, Bassett, and Perdiz arrow points.
In terms of the arrow point clusters
discussed previously, both early (n=6) and
late (n=6) groups came from this portion of
the site. Another apparent cluster is seen
within those units within and around
Structure 2 (see Figure 7-7). Whether this
represents a concentration distinct from the
one previously described is uncertain.
Identified types include Steiner, Catahoula,
Cuney, and Perdiz. Here, types associated
with the early arrow point cluster
predominate with 12 being recovered. Later
types were limited to three Perdiz and a
single Bassett.
Comparatively fewer arrow points were
recovered from the excavation units directly
associated with Structure 1. Most (n=6) of
the arrow points from this area were broken
or not finished, precluding them from being
classified. Catahoula (n=1), Steiner (n=2),
and a single Perdiz point came from this
portion of the site.
In those units
immediately east of the Structure 1 location,
three additional Steiner points, one Cuney, a
Bassett, and an arrow point similar to a
Bulbar Stemmed were also recovered. The
two former types are included within the
early cluster and if they are spatially related
to Structure 2, this could indicate that both
houses are about the same age, assuming
that the clusters have temporal significance.
A fairly distinct arrow point concentration
is seen in and around the Feature 76 locale.
Identified types include Perdiz, Catahoula,
Steiner, and Cuney. Here again, earlycluster types (n=7) predominate over latecluster types (n=4).
This could be
interpreted
as
meaning
that
the
concentration in the Feature 76 area is
roughly contemporaneous to those possibly
associated with the two structures.

336

Points
The distribution of (non-arrow) points
recovered from the Lang Pasture site is
presented in Figure 7-8. As can be seen,
there seems to be a small concentration of
Late or Archaic or Woodland types in the
Structure 2 vicinity, although the association
with that structure is undoubtedly fortuitous.
Identified types include, Edgewood (n=1),
Ensor (n=1), and Gary (n=4).
A second apparent concentration is in the
vicinity of Feature 76. Six of the points
were either fragmentary or unfinished,
precluding them from being classified. Six
others were identified and included Hoxie
(n=1), Gary (n=2), Axtell (n=1), and
Yarbrough (n=2). This concentration is
somewhat difficult to explain given the fact
that a number of arrow points were also
recovered from this specific locale. Perhaps
the relatively high number of points (mainly
Archaic types) reflects the amount of
relatively deep excavation done by the
Caddo in this area in order to expose and
excavated the large pit, Feature 76. In
viewing Figure 7-8, it can be seen that types
normally associated with the Early, Middle,
and Late Archaic/Woodland periods are
scattered over most of the site area sampled
by the excavation units.
Preforms
The distribution of preforms is illustrated in
Figure 7-9. Counts are not available for
those units excavated during site testing, so
those numbers are not shown. What appears
to be a slight concentration can be seen
within those units associated with Structure
2. Three have been classified as arrow point
preforms, while the remainder are too
fragmentary to classify.
One definite concentration of preforms, all
seemingly intended for arrow points, is seen
in the Feature 76 locale. This occurrence
cannot be explained with the data at hand.

from this specific portion of the site
Other Artifacts
The distributions of the other lithic artifacts
are also illustrated in Figure 7-9.
Interpretations relating to these categories
are even harder to make given the low
frequencies in each class. The three pitted
stones came from a very limited area of the
excavations bounded by the N197 and N201
lines. This seems to indicate a specialized
activity locus. Unfortunately, pitted stones
are not good temporal markers; it is,
therefore, impossible to relate this apparent
activity locus to a particular segment of site
occupancy.
As noted earlier, only two perforators were
recovered during the data recovery
excavations. One came from a unit situated
within Structure 2. The other was in one of
the northern excavation units.
The remaining artifacts under consideration
include the possible celt fragment and the
four-beveled biface.
The former was
recovered from Feature 76 in Unit
N198E203. An association with a particular
segment of site occupancy cannot be made.
The four-beveled biface came from a unit
just outside the Structure 2 wall line.
However, whether that artifact is directly
associated with that structure is unknown.

processes used in making chipped stone
tools, while the second is to determine the
range of lithic reduction that was being
conducted on site. The latter is often useful
in interpreting site function. The analytical
procedure used in this study places the
debitage into one of several categories that
can be assumed to be associated wit a
particular processual stage in working stone.
These categories are defined in Table 7-3.
As noted previously, only a sample of the
debitage from the Lang Pasture site was
analyzed. The reason for doing so stemmed
from the fact that it was impossible to isolate
discrete samples that could be associated
with a particular segment of site occupancy.
The sandy nature of the soils at the site and
natural and man-induced disturbances
caused cultural deposits to become mixed,
thereby eliminating the research potential
for much of the debitage obtained from the
hand-excavated units. However, it was
believed that the debitage in some of the
features might be associated with a specific
component and could provide some
information on the related segment of site
occupancy. The following features were
selected because they are believed to be
associated with the Late Caddo Frankston
phase occupation of the site and they
appeared little disturbed (for quantities and
percentages of debitage from these features,
see Table 7-4).

As mentioned previously, the excavations at
the Lang Pasture site produced a large
sample of debitage. As used herein, the
term debitage refers to all chipped stone that
was not completed into a finished tool and

reduction process. Debitage analysis is
usually undertaken for two primary
purposes. The first is to examine the actual

Structure 1 near the corner of Structure 3
(see Figure 7-7). Two radiocarbon samples
from this feature produced two calibrated 2­
sigma dates of AD 1290-1420 (calibrated
intercepts: AD 1320, 1350, and 1390) and
AD 1450-1650 (calibrated intercepts: AD
1500, 1600, and 1610).

Chapter 7: Lithic Analysis

Table 7-3. List of Definitions for Kinds of Debitage from the Lang Pasture Site.
Flakes: Pieces of stone that have been removed from a core, preform, or tool, either by pressure or percussion
techniques. Flakes normally have only two faces: (1) a dorsal face, which either bears scars from previous flake
removal or cortex and (2) the ventral face. The ventral face is more or less flat to somewhat concave and commonly
features a bulb of force, ripples, and radial fissures that result from force passing through the stone when struck from
the parent rock.
Primary Flakes: Flakes that have greater than an estimated one-half of the dorsal surface covered by cortex.
Secondary Flakes: Flakes that have less than an estimated one-half of the dorsal surface covered by cortex.
Tertiary Flakes: Flakes that lack cortex and do not have multifaceted platforms or other characteristics of biface­
thinning flakes (see below).
Biface-Thinning Flakes: Flakes that lack cortex and display scars on the dorsal surface resulting from previous flake
removal. They are distinguished by a distinctive "lipped" or multifaceted platform that was actually a portion of the
opposite face of the biface from which they were removed. Biface-thinning flakes are normally associated with latestage reduction in producing bifacial artifacts.
Notching Flakes: Similar to biface-thinning flakes. However, they are characterized by their relatively small size and
by their distinctive, concave, proximal ends adjoining an unusually small, multifaceted platform. As the name implies,
they are derived from notching artifacts, typically bifaces, for hafting purposes.
Interior Flakes: Flakes that lack cortex and intact striking platform remnants. Most are probably broken tertiary or
biface-thinning flakes.
Blades: A "specialized flake with parallel or sub-parallel lateral edges; the length being equal to, or more than, twice
the width" that was "associated with a prepared core and blade technique" (Crabtree 1972:42).
Blade Flakes: Resemble blades in terms of length/width ratios, parallel or roughly parallel edges, triangular or
trapezoidal cross section, etc. However, they were not produced from specialized cores as indicated by their striking
platforms.
Preforms: Represent intermediate stages between cores and finished tools. The division between early stage performs
and late stage cores is often subjective. Generally, performs have been thinned substantially more and have assumed
more of the general outline of the finished tool. Some performs are derived from flakes.
Unclassified Bifaces: Small fragments of stone bifaces that cannot be categorized to a particular artifact or debitage
class.
Blocky Debitage: Angular pieces of stone that lack flake characteristics and typically feature little or no cortex. Larger
examples do not appear to be expended cores. The smaller specimens represent what some researchers refer to as
"shatter."
Pebble: A rounded water worn nodule of stone measuring between 4 and 64 mm in diameter (Bates and Jackson
1980:460).
Fractured Pebbles: Pieces of split or broken pebbles. This category includes examples that range from fragments
greater than half the pebble to those that are flake size. Regardless of size, all have large amounts of remaining cortex
and lack characteristics normally associated with flakes.
Tested Pebbles: Essentially pebbles from which only one or two flakes have been removed. They are believed to
represent one of the earliest stages in the lithic reduction process. The removal of these initial flakes would have
allowed the knapper to inspect the quality of the stone to determine its suitability for flaking.

Archeological Investigations at the Lang Pasture Site (41AN38) in the Upper Neches River Basin of East Texas
Texas Department of Transportation

Feature 20 yielded no diagnostic lithic
artifacts; however, one very crude preform
possibly intended for a Gary point was in the
flotation sample from 50-60 cm. The debitage
consisted of 54 pieces of stone obtained from
five flotation samples totaling 33.0 liters. This
indicated a density of 1.64 pieces of debitage
per liter of soil. As a normal part of the lithic
analysis, this sample (and all of the other
flotation samples) was screened through ¼­
inch wire mesh prior to sorting. Roughly 28
percent of the debitage was greater than ¼
inch in maximum dimension; whereas, about
72 percent was less than ¼ inch.
The debitage from Feature 20 included all six
of the material types that were common at the
site.
These include chert, novaculite,
quartzite, silicified wood, thermally altered
chert, and thermally altered quartzite.
Novaculite and thermally altered chert were
only present in the less than ¼ inch sample.
Evidence of heat treating was present on 41
percent of the debitage.
Frequencies and percentages of the various
debitage categories represented in Feature 20
are presented in Table 7-4. Nothing unusual is
seen in the relative frequencies of the various
forms. Flakes account for 78 percent of the
collection, while other categories comprise 22
percent. Only 5 percent of the flakes had
cortex. There were only two pieces of edgemodified debitage in the sample, representing
4 percent of the collection.
Feature 25
Feature 25 is believed to represent an outdoor
hearth, which was situated roughly 3 m
northeast of Structure 1 and about 1 m north of
Structure 3 (see Figure 7-7).
A single
calibrated radiocarbon date of AD 1290-1420
(2-sigma) with calibrated intercepts of AD
1320, 1350, 1390 was obtained from Feature
25.
Feature 25 yielded no diagnostic lithic
artifacts. All of the debitage (96 pieces) was

Technical Report No. 174202

obtained from 11 flotation samples totaling
80.8 liters. This gave a density of 1.18 pieces
of debitage per liter of soil, similar to the
density in Feature 20. When screened through
¼-inch wire mesh, the sample was found to
have 22 pieces (23%) greater than ¼ inch in
maximum dimension and 74 (77%) less than
¼ inch.
The debitage in Feature 25 seems fairly typical
of the rest of the features in terms of material
type. All six major material types were
present: chert, novaculite, quartzite, silicified
wood, thermally altered chert, and thermally
altered quartzite, each represented in both the
greater than ¼ inch and less than ¼ inch
samples. Evidence of heat treating was noted
on 42 percent of the collection.
Table 7-4 lists the frequencies and percentages
of the various debitage categories in Feature
25. There were two notching flakes in this
sample.
Both
were
yellowish-brown
novaculite. The maximum widths of the
notches were 1.5 mm and 3.3 mm, suggesting
they resulted from arrow point production.
Again, nothing is unusual in terms of the
various represented types, with one notable
exception. There were only six fire-spalled
pieces of debitage in the sample, which is
extremely low when considering the suggested
function of Feature 25 as an outdoor hearth.
That is unless the debitage in Feature 25 is
intrusive into the feature after its
abandonment. Regardless, flakes account for
81 percent of the collection, while other
categories comprise 19 percent. Cortex was
present on 8 percent of the flakes. There was
no edge-modified stone in the sample.
Feature 36
Feature 36 (see Figure 7-7) was located about
1 m northeast of Structure 1 and within or
immediately adjacent to Structure 3. It was
interpreted as either a smudge pit or a hearth.
Two radiocarbon samples from Feature 36
produced calibrated 2-sigma dates of AD
1400-1450 (calibrated intercept: AD 1430)

343

Chapter 7: Lithic Analysis

and AD 1300-1450 (calibrated intercept: AD
1420).
There were no diagnostic lithic
artifacts in Feature 36.
Most of the debitage (81 pieces) was obtained
from three flotation samples totaling 17.8
liters. This resulted in a ratio of 4.55 pieces of
debitage per liter, which is substantially
greater than any of the other features
examined as a part of this analysis. When
screened through ¼-inch hardware cloth, it
was found that 9 percent was greater than ¼
inch in maximum dimension, while 91 percent
was less than ¼ inch. There were eight pieces
of debitage from two hand-excavated
proveniences in Feature 36. These were
eliminated from this analysis because of the
small sample size.
The lithic materials present in Feature 36 were
fairly typical in comparison to the other
features examined.
Chert, novaculite,
quartzite, silicified wood, thermally altered
chert, and thermally altered quartzite were
present. Of some interest is the occurrence of
an interior flake of dark oolitic chert in the
hand-excavated sample. The stone contains
numerous white microfossils and has
transparent thin edges.
It resembles
descriptions of Pisgah Ridge chert, which is
found in a very limited area of east central
Texas near Richland in Navarro County
(Banks 1990:52). One noticeable difference in
the materials in Feature 36 is the low relative
frequency of heat-treated material, only 27
percent. As discussed below, the only feature
in which a similar percentage of thermally
altered stone occurred was Feature 79.
Feature 37
Feature 37 was located within the wall lines of
Structure 1 in its southeastern quadrant (see
Figure 7-6). It was interpreted as a possible
food-storage pit. A single calibrated 2-sigma
radiocarbon age range of AD 1400-1450
(calibrated intercept: AD 1430) was obtained
from Feature 37.
Feature 37 produced no diagnostic lithic
artifacts. The debitage sample included 13

344

pieces of stone from hand-excavated contexts
and an additional 26 pieces from two flotation
samples totaling 2.5 liters. The flotation
samples indicate a density of 1.51 pieces of
debitage per liter of soil, which is comparable
to most of the other features.
This is very small sample and any
generalizations
should
be
considered
accordingly. It appears that there is no
noticeable difference in the material types, the
represented debitage forms, or the percentage
of thermally altered stone in this feature. Nor
is there anything noteworthy in the handexcavated sample, except a rather large
notching flake of black chert that measures 8.3
mm long and 9.1 mm wide, larger than what
would be expected in arrow point production.
Feature 76A
Feature 76A is a part of the Feature 76
complex located approximately 4 m northeast
of Structure 1 (see Figure 7-6). It was
interpreted as a large storage pit. A single
radiocarbon sample produced calibrated 2­
sigma date ranges of AD 1050-1090, 1130­
1140, and 1140-1260 with a single calibrated
intercept of AD 1210.
Feature 76A produced two diagnostic lithic
artifacts. The first was a Hoxie point at a
depth of 100-110 cm. The second was a
Steiner
arrow
point
(110-120
cm).
Additionally, an unclassified biface that
appears to have been part of a point perform
was recovered between 140-150 cm. These
occurrences indicate that (1) the feature
contains materials that predate the Caddo
occupation(s) of the site and (2) there was
mixing of these deposits, both compromising
interpretations attempted from the debitage.
The debitage from Feature 76A includes 36
pieces of stone from hand-excavated contexts
and 31 more from four flotation samples
totaling 29.0 liters.
The density of the
debitage in the flotation samples was 1.07
pieces per liter of soil, which is comparable to
that occurring in most of the other features
examined in this study.

Technical Report No. 174202

Archeological Investigations at the Lang Pasture Site (41AN38) in the Upper Neches River Basin of East Texas
Texas Department of Transportation

Here, again, nothing in the flotation samples
seems unusual as regards types of materials
present, represented forms, percentages of
thermally altered chert, or the like. The only
thing that is of some interest is the high
percentage (45 percent) of the sample in the
greater than ¼-inch size category. This could
be related to the presence of earlier materials
in Feature 76A, if not, in effect, related to the
extremely small sample size.

The debitage from Feature 76 included 149
pieces of stone from hand-excavated contexts
and another 65 from four flotation samples
totaling 29.0 liters. The density of the lithics
in the flotation sample was 2.24 pieces per
liter of soil, a figure comparable to most of the
other features examined herein. The flotation
sample had 23 percent of the debitage in the
greater than ¼-inch size category and 77
percent in the less than ¼-inch size group.

In comparing the hand-excavated debitage
from Feature 76A to the sample recovered
during flotation, nothing out of the ordinary is
seen, with the exception of the high relative
frequency (46 percent) of cortical flakes. This
is substantially higher than any of the other
features, including the hand-excavated
samples from Features 76 and 79 (discussed
below). An explanation for this is impossible
with the data at hand. One biface thinning
flake in the hand-excavated sample was a dark
gray, almost black, chert with numerous white
microfossils, possibly another example of
Pisgah Ridge chert. Sizes of complete flakes
in the hand-excavated sample are provided for
additional comparisons.

Nothing seems unusual about the flotation
sample in regard to the material types, the
amount of thermally altered stone, the
represented forms, etc.
One interesting
observation is the complete lack of cortical
flakes. This is obviously related to the small
size of the collection, because cortical flakes
were present in the hand-excavated debitage.

Feature 76
Feature 76 was interpreted as a large storage
pit that was subsequently used for burials. It
was approximately 4 m northeast of Structure
1 (see Figure 7-6). Two of the radiocarbon
samples from Feature 76 produced 2-sigma
calibrated date ranges of AD 1300-1370 and
AD 1380-1430 (calibrated intercept: AD
1400) and AD 1300-1370 and A.D. 1380-1430
(calibrated intercept: AD 1400). A third
radiocarbon date was much later and possibly
was contaminated with recent organics.
Feature 76 yielded three diagnostic lithic
artifacts. The first was a Perdiz arrow point
(70-80 cm); the second was a Steiner arrow
point (110-120 cm); and the third was a Gary
point (120-130 cm).
The latter artifact
indicates that some of the debitage in Feature
76 might predate the Caddo occupation(s) of
the site.

Technical Report No. 174202

As noted above, the hand-excavated debitage
from Feature 76 included 149 pieces of stone ,
In comparing the hand-excavated samples
from Features 76 and 76A , there appear to be
no notable differences in material types,
amounts of thermally altered stone,
represented forms, etc. Flake sizes seem
comparable also.
However, Feature 76
yielded six pieces of dark gray, almost black,
chert containing numerous white microfossils
(evidently Pisgah Ridge chert) occurring as
biface-thinning and interior flakes. Also,
Feature 76 produced a very large notching
flake that was evidently derived from the
production of a biface significantly larger than
an arrow point. That notching flake measured
9.0 mm long and 11.2 mm wide.
Feature 79
Feature 79 was interpreted as a large pit. It
was located approximately 2 m north of
Structure 1 (see Figure 7-7). One of the two
radiocarbon samples from Feature 79
produced a calibrated 2-sigma date range of
AD 1260-1320 and AD 1350-1390 (calibrated
intercept: AD 1290). The second yielded a
calibrated 2-sigma date of AD 570-660 (cal.
intercept: AD 640), which seems too early.
The first date suggests that Feature 79 might
predate many of the other features thought to

345

Chapter 7: Lithic Analysis

be associated with the Frankston phase
occupation of the site. The only diagnostic
lithic artifact in Feature 79 was a Perdiz arrow
point recovered from 60-70 cm.
Most of the debitage obtained from Feature 79
(n=143) came from 10 flotation samples
totaling 80.6 liters. This indicated a density of
1.77 pieces of stone per liter of soil.
Approximately 18 percent of this sample was
greater than ¼-inch in maximum dimension,
while 82 percent was less than ¼-inch.
Nothing unusual is seen in regard to the
materials, represented forms, etc. One thing
of some interest is the low relative frequency
of non-thermally altered material (23 percent)
in this sample. This is comparable to Feature
36 (discussed above). As noted above, the
hand-excavated samples contained only 36
pieces of debitage. It is somewhat interesting
to observe that this collection contained 47
percent heat-treated stone, as opposed to 23
percent in the flotation samples. Possibly, this
disparity is related to the small size of the
hand-excavated sample.
When comparing the hand-excavated samples
from Features 76A, 76, and 79 there are few
observable differences in the collections. The
number of whole flakes in the hand-excavated
sample in Feature 79 was too small to make
meaningful comparisons.
However, there
were a number of complete flakes in the
flotation sample. Unfortunately, there are no
comparable data sets available to attempt any
interpretations. This information is presented
here solely to provide data for future studies
on Caddo lithic technological developments in
this and adjoining parts of Texas.
Interpretations
The analysis of the debitage collected from
selected features at the Lang Pasture site is
hampered by several factors.
The most
notable stems from the fact that the site had
multiple occupations beginning in the Early
Archaic period and terminating at some point
in Caddo times. Although the occupation of
the site presumably was not continuous,

346

debitage continued to accumulate as each new
group came in and produced chipped stone
tools. Natural processes, such as animal
burrowing, tree falls, root action, etc. mixed
the sandy soils and the materials from these
successive occupations over much of the site
area. Then, there were the disturbances
caused by humans when digging post holes for
structures and excavating pits for food storage.
Too, if these pits were filled after use, soils
from across the site containing earlier artifacts
would have been employed, thereby adding to
the contamination. This has, to some extent,
been seen in the discussions of the features
presented above.
The second factor that impedes interpreting
the debitage from these features stems from
the lack of comparable data sets. The Lang
Pasture site is one of a few Late Caddo sites
that has been extensively examined in the
study area. Additionally, we do not as yet
know what earlier Caddo sites in the area look
like archaeologically. Ideally, small singlecomponent sites should be located and
thoroughly investigated to clearly define the
cultural chronology of this region and to
delineate discrete artifact and debitage
assemblages that can be used for future
comparisons.
7.4

SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS

The analysis of diagnostic lithic artifacts has
indicated a number of things concerning site
occupancy. First, multiple components are
reflected by a number of Early, Middle, and
Late Archaic, and Woodland, points. There
seems to be some horizontal separation of
Archaic materials within the hand-excavated
units, with apparent clusters in the northern
and southern portion of the excavation. That in
the northern part of the site appears somewhat
earlier than that in the southern portion of the
excavations. A concentration of Archaic
points occurred in the Feature 76 area.
A more substantial Caddo-era site utilization
is demonstrated by the large number of arrow
points in the sample. There seem to be two
groups or clusters of arrow points in the

Technical Report No. 174202

Archeological Investigations at the Lang Pasture Site (41AN38) in the Upper Neches River Basin of East Texas
Texas Department of Transportation

collection that might have temporal
significance.
Arrow points classified as
Catahoula and Steiner share technological
similarities and are probably the earlier of the
two groups. Perdiz and Bassett arrow points
are interpreted as comprising the later cluster.
If these do, in fact, represent two distinct
temporal segments of Caddo occupation of the
site, recovery frequencies indicate that the
earlier was the more substantial, or perhaps
that bow and arrow hunting was more
intensively practiced during the earlier period.
It is impossible to clearly associate one of
these two groups with particular features or
sets of features on the basis of the lithic
artifacts alone.
This work has addressed to various degrees
several of the research questions identified in

Technical Report No. 174202

the original data recovery plan. These include
age and number of occupations, Caddo tool
assemblages, and, to a limited extent, raw
material use. It was hoped that a detailed
analysis of the artifacts and debitage recovered
from the site could be used to address other
questions, such as (1) defining specific activity
areas within the site, (2) examining the use of
informal (i.e., expedient) tools versus formal
tools; (3) studying use and acquisition of lithic
raw materials, including identification of
probable source locations; (4) establishing
lithic reduction strategies, and (5) examining
site function by comparing the lithic
assemblage to contemporary Caddoan sites in
the region. This, however, was not possible
due to a number of factors, as mentioned
above.

CHAPTER 8
8PLANT REMAINS FROM THE LANG PASTURE SITE (41AN38), ANDERSON
COUNTY, TEXAS, AND THE CHARACTER OF CADDO AGRICULTURE IN THE
UPPER NECHES RIVER BASIN
Phil Dering and Timothy K. Perttula

8.1

INTRODUCTION

The primary goal of this analysis is to provide
botanical data obtained during the data
recovery excavations at the Lang Pasture site
(41AN38) that will contribute to an
understanding of prehistoric Caddo land use
and subsistence, specifically the character of
Caddo subsistence and agricultural practices at
the Lang Pasture site in the upper Neches
River basin of East Texas. This study will
first describe the macrobotanical remains from
the Lang Pasture site and discuss the evidence
for plant utilization and plant production (see
Table 5-10 for associated radiocarbon dates).
The analysis first describes the plants
identified in the samples, the context of the
plant material and the ubiquity and abundance
of the plant resources at the site. The
remainder of the chapter discusses the
character of prehistoric Caddo agriculture in
East Texas, including the paleobotanical
findings from the Lang pasture site within this
broader context.
8.2

METHODS

There are two types of samples in the current
study: flotation samples and macrobotanical
sample. Flotation is a method of recovering
organic remains from archeological sediments
by using water to separate heavy or soluble
inorganic particles from plant parts and small
animal bone or other small archeological
debris. The material floating to the surface is
called the light fraction, and this is caught on a
fine-mesh screen or strainer. The material that
sinks to the bottom is the heavy fraction and it

Technical Report No. 174202

is also caught on a fine mesh screen (usually
about 0.5-0.6 mm bottom mesh size). Most of
the soil, including clay and silt, is suspended
in water and passes through the screens and is
either recycled or discarded. In most cases,
only the light fraction is submitted for analysis
after the heavy fraction has been examined for
plant materials.
Macrobotanical samples are carbonized plant
remains that are separated from the rest of the
archeological materials by hand. Usually
these samples are collected either from an
excavator’s screen or point collected in-situ.
At most open archeological sites, only
carbonized plant remains are considered to be
potentially a part of the archeological record.
In some rare cases certain durable and easily
identifiable wood types such as juniper may
survive in a partially carbonized state, but only
at younger sites in relatively dry conditions.
Submerged sites at which deposits have
remained in anaerobic conditions often
preserve uncarbonized plant remains quite
well. Deposits in the current study have been
exposed to the elements for a sufficiently
lengthy time period that only carbonized plant
material is included in the archeological
record.
A total of 45 flotation samples were submitted
from the Lang Pasture site for the current
analysis. Additionally five macrobotanical
samples consisting of maize fragments were
examined and described for this study (see
Chapter 8 appendix).

349

Chapter 8: Plant Remains from the Lang Pasture Site (41AN38) Anderson County, Texas, and the Character of
Caddo Agriculture in the Upper Neches River Basin

The analysis follows standard archeobotanical
laboratory procedures. Each sample is passed
through a nested set of screens of 4 mm, 2
mm, 1 mm, and 0.45 mm mesh and examined
for charred material, which is separated for
identification. Plant remains were sorted into
three categories: woody fragments, nut
fragments, and seed/fruit fragments, including
maize parts. Identification of carbonized
wood was accomplished by using the snap
technique, examining the fragments at 8 to 45
magnifications with a hand lens or a binocular
dissecting microscope, and comparing the
material to samples in the archeobotanical
herbarium. All seed identifications were made
using seed manuals and reference collections
at Shumla Archeobotanical Services.
Counts and weights from the site sample are
presented in tabular format in Appendix H,
and in various tables in this chapter. Presence
values are presented for woody taxa, for nuts
and acorns, and for cultigens. Presence value
or ubiquity is defined as the percentage of all
analyzed samples, both productive (with
seeds) and unproductive (wood charcoal only
or no charcoal), in which a particular taxon is
present. The presence value does not provide
abundance figures, but it does provide a means
of determining how widespread a taxon is
throughout the samples recovered from a site.
Abundance is presented most effectively by
weight. Tables that follow include both
ubiquity figures and taxon weight in order to
best describe and evaluate the occurrence of a
taxon.
The nut to wood ratios (i.e., the ratio of nut
weight to wood charcoal weight) provide a
scale by which to measure changing quantities
of nut fragments across a site. These data may
have some utility in establishing the nature of
subsistence patterns at the Lang Pasture site by
comparison with other recently analyzed
Caddo paleobotanical assemblages (cf. Bush
2007, 2008; Dering 2008). Nut to wood ratios
have been utilized as one line of evidence in
the study of other Caddo paleobotanical
assemblages in determining the degree to
which the landscape has been altered for

350

agriculture, and the degree to which a
settlement relies on wild plant resources.
However, both the presence values and the nut
to wood ratio from a single site are specific to
the spatial and temporal framework of that site
only, and may not reflect the overall
subsistence patterns of the region.
Issues in Identification
Only charred wood and other plant material is
included in the analysis of the paleobotanical
remains from the Lang Pasture site, because
uncarbonized material is consumed by insects,
fungi, and bacteria and does not survive more
than a few years in the archeological deposits
of open sites. Identifications are made to the
most precise taxonomic level possible, given
the condition of the plant material.
In
particular, wood identification is often made to
the genus or family level, or in some cases
wood is assigned to a type. In the current
study, willow/cottonwood, or the Salicaceae
type, refers to all wood in the willow family.
Rose family refers to several common genera
in the study area, including crab-apple,
dogwood, and cherry.
8.3

RESULTS

Analysis of plant materials recovered from the
Lang Pasture site recorded 11 wood types,
acorns and hickory nut, maize cupules and
kernels, and squash rind. Wood charcoal was
the most abundant and frequent of the plant
materials. Table 8-1 presents the ubiquity
values for the plant remains.
Hickory nut fragments were by far the most
frequently occurring and abundant of all the
edible plant resources at the Lang Pasture site,
occurring in 84.4% of the flotation samples
and in 16 of the 20 features in the study, and
weighing a total of 22.7 g. Of the two
cultigens recovered from the samples, maize
was fairly widespread, occurring in 42.2% of
the flotation samples and in 13 features. The
squash rind occurred in three samples from
Features 37, 84, and 85.

Oak is the most abundant and widespread
wood identified in the flotation samples,
accounting for 60% of the total wood weight.
Other wood types include willow/cottonwood,
pine, hickory, and indeterminate wood and
bark. Pine was the third most common wood
type, occurring in over 26% of the flotation
samples. Based on the wood contents of the
features at the Lang Pasture site, it is likely
that the region was a mixed hardwood/pine
woodland with more oak than pine during the
Caddo occupation of the area.

In addition to the oak, pine, and hickory noted
from the samples, very small quantities of
giant cane, hackberry, sweetgum, rose family
(cherry, dogwood, crabapple, etc.), and elm
wood also were recorded.
Table 8-2 presents the results of all the
flotation samples ordered by feature number.
Most of the features contained similar
contents, that is, oak wood, hickory nut
fragments, and 13 of the 20 features contained
maize.

Archeological Investigations at the Lang Pasture Site (41AN38) in the Upper Neches River Basin of East Texas
Texas Department of Transportation

Maize occurrence was limited to only a few
kernel or cupule fragments in the flotation
samples, however, there were two notable
exceptions. Feature 41 contained 222 maize
fragments along with a relatively small
quantity of oak wood. Several small cob
segments from Feature 41 also were submitted
as macrobotanical samples.
Feature 84
contained 204 maize fragments with hickory
nut and hickory wood, and a few squash rind
fragments.
Nut fragments, although very widespread, for
the most part did not occur in dense
concentrations.
A few acorn pericarp
fragments were recovered from Features 25
and 79. Hickory nut pericarp fragments

occurred in most of the features, but only
Features 36 and 37 contained large quantities
of nut fragments. The implication is that most
of the features contain a background scatter of
hickory nut fragments.
Table 8-3 presents the results of the
macrobotanical samples submitted for
analysis. These samples were composed
mostly of very small maize cob fragments.
Although I can only estimate row counts, most
of the cob segments suggest that these samples
consisted of 8-10 row cobs. Many of the
cupules were comparatively wide, measuring
between 5.35-5.65-mm.

SUMMARY OF THE PLANT
REMAINS FROM THE LANG
PASTURE SITE

Forty-five flotation samples and five
macrobotanical samples contained 11 wood
types, hickory nuts, acorns, maize, and squash.
Hickory nut fragments were the most
widespread and abundant of the forest mast
remains, but were recovered in large quantities
only from Features 36 and 37. Although maize
was widespread, remains were thinly scattered
through most of the samples with the
exception of material from Features 41 and 84.
Squash rind occurred in three features. The
macrobotanical samples consisted of very

small maize cob fragments, too small to
reconstruct cob size or cob rows. However,
cupule measurements suggest that most of the
fragments from Feature 41 were 8 and 10 row
types. This does not discount, however, the
distinct possibility that higher-number-rowed
cobs were present at the site.
The most consistent aspect of the feature
paleobotanical descriptions from the Lang
Pasture site is the overwhelming ubiquity and
abundance of hickory nut fragments recovered
in the samples. Hickory nut fragments were
present in 84.4% of the flotation samples, and
hickory nut remains outweighed the other
plant food resource by a factor of 5:1.

Chapter 8: Plant Remains from the Lang Pasture Site (41AN38) Anderson County, Texas, and the Character of
Caddo Agriculture in the Upper Neches River Basin

The ubiquity and relative abundance of
hickory nut fragments indicates that the site
deposits contain a relatively consistent
paleobotanical background of hickory nut
fragments. Most of the features, regardless of
their original function, were filled or refilled
with charred nut fragments. The variety of
feature types in which nut fragments are
present suggests that they constitute secondary
refuse, or trash deposited at some location
other than the location of use. Secondary
refuse usually consists of larger, more longlasting plant parts such as nut fragments that
are often over-represented in archeological
deposits. However, the ubiquitous presence of
nut fragments at this site also suggests that
hickory nut processing was sufficiently intense
to have created debris that penetrated virtually
every feature at the settlement. Even though
hickory nuts are obviously over-represented in
the
archeological
record
here,
the
predominance of nut fragments at this site
indicates that hickory nut harvesting and
processing must have been an important and
repeated activity in the fall, implying that the
site was occupied at least during the fall and
winter.
Wood charcoal remains indicate that the forest
vegetation at the time was probably a mixed
hardwood/conifer forest at the Lang Pasture
site. The principal overstory trees were pine
and oak (see Table 8-1).
Domesticated plants, particularly maize, are
widespread and relatively abundant at the
Lang Pasture site. Plant production was a
major focus of Caddo subsistence at the time
of the occupation of the site, based on maize
ubiquity of 42% (see Table 8-1), and it is
likely that the agricultural fields for the Caddo
peoples living at the Lang Pasture site were
located in the nearby stream bottoms or in
other settings with arable soils. These fields
probably covered no more than an acre per
household, and would have been cleared with
wood or stone tools to remove brush, weeds,
and grasses, as well as dead trees or
overhanging limbs (see Swanton 1942:127­
131). Seeds were planted (probably in two
plantings (e.g., Swanton 1942:129) and the

358

fields would then have been carefully tended
to protect the crop from small animals and
deer. The cultivation of maize, as well as
squash, and the collection of hickory nuts and
the preparation of hickory nut oil, were the
main plant production and processing
activities at the site. As the Caddo occupation
here appears to have been a permanent one,
the paleobotanical record was left by a Caddo
group that was moderately invested in
agriculture. The stable carbon isotope values
from a number of the burial features at the
Lang Pasture site (see Wilson, this volume)
support the notion that maize was an important
part of the diet of these Caddo peoples during
the early 14th to mid-15th centuries A.D..
8.5

PREHISTORIC CADDO
AGRICULTURE IN EAST TEXAS

Ethnographic accounts of Caddo plant
utilization (Griffith 1954; Swanton 1942;
Rogers and Sabo 2004) indicate that the
Caddo peoples living in East Texas and along
the Red River in Louisiana grew two varieties
of maize, six varieties of beans, squash,
sunflower, and tobacco as well as the
European introductions of watermelon,
peaches,
and
pomegranates
(Swanton
1942:127-134; Blake 1981). While maize,
beans, and squash were apparently the
mainstays of historic Caddo subsistence, wild
plant foods were also collected, including
hardwood nuts, seeds, and greens. Like other
Southeastern U.S. tribes (see Scarry and
Scarry 2005), the Caddo grew crops in small
family plots as well as in larger communal
fields, storing the harvests in household
granaries.
Because floral preservation is generally poor
in the acidic soils of the Caddo area, the
consideration and interpretation of prehistoric
Caddo subsistence until recently rested more
on the fortuitous recovery of subsistence
remains (primarily maize), and the available
ethnographic information compiled by
Swanton (1942), than on a systematic study of
the Caddo archeological and paleobotanical
records themselves. Fortunately, recent
research on a number of prehistoric and early

Technical Report No. 174202

Archeological Investigations at the Lang Pasture Site (41AN38) in the Upper Neches River Basin of East Texas
Texas Department of Transportation

historic Caddo sites has been directed towards
the development of a regional subsistence data
base (especially paleobotanical), and to the
utilization of techniques such as flotation to
maximize the recovery of subsistence remains.
Yet, the relative utilization and contribution of
domesticates, and models that account for the
development of agricultural economies,
remain to be fully assessed and evaluated
within any one region of the Caddo area. Only
by means of the development of a series of
regional research efforts, and a focus on the
investigation of appropriate archeological
resources, can processes of cultural and
subsistence change become more evident.
Local developmental sequences cannot be
generated easily over different parts of the
Caddo area, and therefore require supporting
data and sufficient temporal control to insure
investigation of short and long-term changes
in the archeological record.
Story (1981:148) estimated that the
contribution of maize to the Caddo diet in
prehistoric times was "conservatively to have
accounted for at least 30-40% of the diet."

This would be in line with the current
inference that the Caddo had an agricultural
subsistence strategy. However, quantifiable
data has not been presented to support the
estimate, nor is it known if that estimate
pertains to the entire sequence of the
prehistoric Caddo tradition (in East Texas) or
to a particular segment of that lengthy Caddo
occupation of the region. Archeological
evidence discussed below suggests that it is
not until after ca. A.D. 1300 to A.D. 1400 that
agricultural subsistence strategies are to be
found among the East Texas Caddo, including
the Caddo groups that lived at the Lang
Pasture site.
Plant Foods Grown and Cultivated by the
Caddo Indian Peoples
With the ever-increasing flotation of
sediments from feature fills and trash midden
deposits on prehistoric and early historic
Caddo sites, it is apparent that there was a
wide suite of plant foods were grown and
cultivated by Caddo peoples (Table 8-4).

Caddo Agriculture in the Upper Neches River Basin

This includes the important cultigens maize,
common bean, and squash, as well as bottle
gourd; oily seeds (namely sumpweed and
sunflower), and starchy seeds, including
chenopod, knotweed, amaranth, maygrass,
little barley, and in a few instances in
southwestern Arkansas Caddo sites, panic
grass (see Powell and Lopinot 2000; Fritz
1993). The same range of plant foods is
documented in prehistoric eastern North
American sites dating before as well as after
ca. A.D. 800/900 (Smith and Cowan
2003:117-122).
Maize is by far the most common cultigen
identified on prehistoric and early historic
Caddo sites, although its ubiquity varies
considerably both spatially and temporally.
The types of races of maize grown include
Eastern Eight-Row (also known as “Northern
Flint”) and Midwestern Twelve-Row, and
generally speaking the maize has been
grouped with Eastern Complex corn (see
discussion in Goldborer [2002:84-85]).
Beans of several different sizes and kinds have
been documented in Caddo sites, although
they are absent in the Lang Pasture
paleobotanical record. Beans are much more
commonly recovered in post-14th century
Caddo sites on the Red and Ouachita rivers
than they are elsewhere in the Caddo area,
including
East
Texas
Caddo
sites.
Nevertheless, we know that maize, beans, and
squash were the principal crops among the
Caddo peoples living in East Texas in the late
17th century (Foster 1998:236, 244). Joutel
commented in 1687 that the Nasoni Caddo
produced large crops of beans, but that the
Caddo did “not make much effort in preparing
them; for them it suffices to put them in a
large pot, without even removing the strings,
then they cover the beans with vine leaves
until they are almost cooked” (Foster
1998:237).
The squash found on Caddo sites would have
been used as edible flesh (cut into strips) and
seeds, and would also have been useful as
containers. Other cultivated plants of this kind

360

would include the bottle gourd, pumpkin, and
various cucurbits.
The chenopod, amaranth, knotweed, sumpweed, and sunflower are clear cultigens that
exhibited obvious morphological signs of
domestication (i.e., increasing seed size and/or
thinner seed coats); these seeds do not occur
with regularity on Caddo sites anywhere in the
larger Caddo archeological area, however. The
maygrass, little barley, and panic grass also
appear to have been cultivated, based
primarily on their occurrence in large numbers
at some sites, but they exhibit no such
morphological distinctions. Powell and
Lopinot (2000:205) suggest that panic grass
may be an element of “the native seed
complex” in Arkansas Caddo sites, primarily
because it commonly occurs in prehistoric
sites in the American Bottom in southwestern
Illinois (cf. Johannessen 1984).
Regional and Temporal Diversity in the
Importance of Cultivated Plant Foods
among the Caddo
Given the known importance, both
prehistorically and in historic times, of the
cultigens maize, beans, and squash to the diet
of the Caddo peoples, one of the most critical
aspects of the plant husbandry system is that
these plants were transported and introduced
from habitats (probably from the Southwest or
even from the eastern United States), where
they had been initially incidentally
domesticated, into an existing Woodland and
Caddo agroecology. Evidence from East
Texas and elsewhere suggests that tropical
cultigens were introduced independently and
sequentially, and that processes of adaptation
were gradual. It was not until some 500 to
1000 years after the initial introduction of
maize in most areas (see Milner 2004:Figure
62), that it became a staple. Furthermore,
while native plants such as sumpweed and
sunflower were used for a long time before
maize was being grown, it was not until after
agriculture based on tropical domesticates
developed that these native domesticates
received their greatest use.

of plant remains (Table 8-5). Chenopod seeds
were recovered at the Herman Bellew site
(41RK222) in the Sabine River basin, but
these were not from a domesticated variety.

At 41HP137 on the Sulphur River, cultivated
squash rinds (whether of a native or tropical
variety has not been established) were
recovered in two features. Calibrated
radiocarbon dates from those features range
from 154-46 BC and AD 560-652 (see
McGregor et al. 1996; Crane 1996:718),
namely in Early to Late Woodland times.
These remains represent the earliest known
evidence for the use of domesticated plants in
the southern Caddo area. Other plant species
recovered at this site include hickory and
acorn nutshells, and a small amount of tuber or
rhizome fragments, possibly from the prairie
turnip or cf. Pediomelum (Fields et al.
1997:Table 11). Other Woodland-period
components in northeastern Texas and
northwestern Louisiana are dominated by
nutshells, with limited amounts of other kinds

Current evidence indicates that maize was
broadly distributed across much of the eastern
U.S. after A.D. 200, and was introduced from
the northern Southwest (see Clark and Knoll
2005:Figure 13.2). According to Smith and
Cowan (2003:117), “it was only after A.D.
800-900 that this introduced crop took center
stage and maize-centered farming appeared
across much of the East.” Furthermore, “the
adoption of maize in eastern North
America…was not straightforward, rapid, and
uniform across the region, but rather a
complex, culturally-variable process” (Smith
and Cowan 2003:122).

The maize introduced into the eastern United
States does seem to reflect considerable
genetic diversity, both because of the nature of
the sources, and gradual environmental and
human selection within the area itself (Cutler
and Blake 1977:134-135). Ford (1981:15)
suggests, therefore, that:
With this range of variation present, it is not
necessary to postulate successive introductions
of new corn types. As corn was introduced
into the northern latitudes, natural and cultural
selection favored attributes of rapid
germination in cool, moist, soil and quicker
maturation for a shorter growing season. There
is no reason that the Northern Flint…, which
came to dominate the Upper Missouri and
Northeast… and which later was introduced
into the Mississippi valley and the Southeast,
could not have evolved in the Upper Midwest
as suggested by a reduction in row number
frequencies from 12-and 14-row to 8-row.
At the same time, under less stressful climatic
conditions (i.e., longer growing season and
minimal threat of frost), row numbers need not
decrease or cob sizes increase as part of the
evolution of maize (Blake and Cutler 1979). In
these areas, including that settled by the
Caddo, local selective pressures (including
their storability) appear to have led to the
maintenance of row and cob size variability in
both hard flint and pop races (Midwest-12 row
and North American Pop) rather than a
reduction in rows like the Eastern Eight Row.
Some of the earliest eight row corn in the
Eastern United States was initially identified
by Jones (1949) from the George C. Davis
(41CE19) corn; the George C. Davis site is
located on the middle reaches of the Neches
River, downstream about 60 km from the
Lang Pasture site. Dated originally at A.D.
399 +162 (C-153, corrected, with a 2 sigma
calibrated age range of AD 25-434), it was
considered to be significant not only in terms
of discussions about the cultivation of maize
in the Caddo area, but was integral in initial
considerations of the development both of the
Caddo tradition, and of Mississippian groups
in general (Krieger 1948:158; Newell and

Technical Report No. 174202

Krieger 1949:231). Jones (1949) suggested
that the George C. Davis maize resembled the
Northern Flint type, and perhaps originated in
Highland Guatemala, rather than in North
America. This particular date on maize came
from a pit (Fea. 31) under the Mound A
platform mound at George C. Davis, but has
since been discredited because of (1) the early
method of radiocarbon analysis (i.e., solid
carbon) that tended to produce older than
expected radiocarbon ages, and (2) its
archeological context (Story 1990:254). That
being said, there are a few other more recently
obtained calibrated radiocarbon dates on
maize from George C. Davis that suggest
some use of the plant before A.D. 800: AD
598-787 (also from Fea. 31, along with
another calibrated date on maize from this
feature of AD 1044-1219), AD 251-566 (Fea.
195-137 in one of the village areas), and AD
346-534 (Fea. 195-149 in the same village
area as Fea. 195-137).1
While the paleobotanical and archeological
evidence appeared to go hand in hand,
subsequent examination of the Davis site
samples and more comprehensive absolute
dating (Story and Valastro 1977) indicates that
such a temporal affiliation for these corn
samples is unlikely. Radiocarbon dates from
the George C. Davis site suggest that the
Caddo occupation there did not begin prior to
A.D. 780 (Story and Valastro 1977:67), or
perhaps not until after ca. A.D. 850 (Story
2000). While Galinat (1985) argued that eight
row corn spread to the Eastern United States
from Northwest Mexico and the Southwest
after ca. A.D. 700, the appearance of eight row
corn at the George C. Davis site need not
imply its dominance even if such an
introduction could by demonstrated. Small 10and 12 row maize was apparently the most
common kind of maize at George C. Davis
and throughout the Caddo area on sites of this
time period (see Cutler and Blake 1977, 2001).
The virtual absence of maize remains from a
Woodland context in the Caddo area may in
part be interpreted as (a) primarily the result of
limited data, (b) its still relative unimportance
as a crop compared to wild plant and animal

363

Chapter 8: Plant Remains from the Lang Pasture Site (41AN38) Anderson County, Texas, and the Character of
Caddo Agriculture in the Upper Neches River Basin

resources, and (c) perhaps a lack of suitable
storage facilities. The oily and starchy seeds,
and the gourds, may have been the dominant
domesticated crops at that time, but even their
level of utilization had yet to intensify prior to
the adoption of maize cultivation. In a
pre-Caddo-tradition horticultural context, Fritz
(1984) suggests that starchy grain crops native
to eastern North America were important
components of the pre-Mississippian as well
as Late Prehistoric diets in the Ozarks as
elsewhere. This indigenous husbandry base
predated the acquisition of maize, flourished at
the time of early, non-intensive maize farming
and finally declined in importance as maize
became the dominant staple.
The timing of the introduction and adoption of
maize as a crop in the Caddo area is not
precisely known. Evidence from flotation
samples from some sites in East Texas (Table
8-5) suggests it is ubiquitous only after A.D.
950 (Perttula and Bruseth 1983:16).
Youngblood (2008:107 and Table 1) asserts
that “corn arrived before A.D. 800 as
demonstrated by 19 direct dates on cob
remains” from East Texas sites such as George
C. Davis, Washington Square (41NA49), Oak
Hill (41RK214), and Ray (41LR135), but
every one of the dates she cited postdates 1010
B.P. (A.D. 940), and thereby refute her own
assertion rather convincingly.
Schambach (2002:105) has suggested that
“corn horticulture” and/or the gardening of
starchy and oily seeds may have been
practiced in Woodland period Fourche Maline
Culture groups by ca. A.D. 400. He bases this
not on any analyses of plant remains from
Fourche Maline sites along the Red River, but
on the appearance of certain types of stone
tools that he thinks may be gardening tools,
perhaps hoes. Schambach (2002:106) also
argues that corn was present and being used
by Fourche Maline groups around A.D. 800,
citing the aforementioned early dates from the
George C. Davis site, and a single calibrated
radiocarbon date on wood charcoal of AD
690-960 from Feature 2 at the Ray site in the
Red River basin (Bruseth 1998:53). (Jeter
[2007:176] has made the same mistaken

364

assertion that corn was present in pre-Caddo
contexts by relying on this one date.) From
these dates, Schambach (2002:106) assumed
that late Fourche Maline-Early Caddo groups
“added corn gradually to their (still
hypothetical) starchy and oily seed
horticultural complex, which they almost
certainly would have done.” He goes on to
suggest that corn was introduced to the Caddo
area from Late Woodland peoples in the
American Bottom, and that the corn may have
been an accompaniment of foreign prestige
goods exchanged between the American
Bottom and Caddo peoples.
What Schambach has overlooked—at least in
the case of the putative early corn at the Ray
site—is that the corn at the Ray site has been
directly dated from two features at the site,
including the feature with the 7th to 9th century
A.D. calibrated date on wood charcoal, and
that it actually dates between AD 1000-1205
(Feature 2) and AD 1045-1220 (Feature 37)
(Perttula et al. 2001:207 and Table 11; Fritz
2008:440). It is clear that the corn from the
Ray site is from a later Caddo occupation, and
has little relevance with regard to the early
adoption and use of this cultivated plant by the
Woodland ancestors of the Caddo peoples.
The introduction of maize into an existing
agroecology based on incidental native crops
brought about a change in the scale of
aboriginal plant husbandry (e.g., Fritz 1986a).
Through time, the relative importance of
maize as a crop plant increased as opposed to
both native cultigens and wild plant and
animal resources. Plant selection was
primarily directed towards the production of
energy and carbohydrate-rich starchy plant
foods, of which maize is most appropriate
nutritionally, and in terms of the ability to
increase its productivity. The cultivation of
maize also increased the agroecological niche
for the more successful cultivation of other
starchy plant foods. That is, while starchy
seeds had been harvested and perhaps grown
for several thousand years prior to the
introduction of maize, it was not until the
human environmental modification associated
with corn cultivation became established that

Technical Report No. 174202

Archeological Investigations at the Lang Pasture Site (41AN38) in the Upper Neches River Basin of East Texas
Texas Department of Transportation

starchy seeds, and even oily seeds, became
domesticates able to take advantage of the
agroecological habitat.
The intensified consumption of starchy seeded
annuals after ca. 1550 B.P. appears to be
confirmed in the paleobotanical record at least
in the southwestern Ozarks (Fritz 1986a,
1986b, 1990). Such is not the case in
Woodland and prehistoric Caddo sites in
northeastern
Texas
and
northwestern
Louisiana, where such seeds are absent in
Woodland period contexts, and are minimally
represented in Early, Middle, and Late Caddo
(ca. A.D. 1400-1680) period sites in the
Sulphur River, Red River, Neches/Angelina,
and Sabine River basins (see Table 8-5).
The most significant aspect of the
paleobotanical record for the period between
ca. A.D. 850-1400 is the common appearance
of corn in all regions of the Caddo
archeological area. Systematically collected
paleobotanical assemblages indicate that the
introduction and adoption (at least to some
extent) of maize by Caddo peoples as a food
source was generally accomplished by ca.
1050 B.P. The record of its utilization is
sporadic at best prior to 1050 B.P. because
only a few paleobotanical assemblages are
known in detail before this period of time.
Paleobotanical samples from East Texas and
the Ozark Highland, based on the systematic
recovery of plant remains, has produced
evidence of the consumption of corn as early
as the 9th century A.D. in Caddo archeological
contexts. At the George C. Davis site,
pre-mound A (Jones 1949) and Early Village
samples from features contained maize from
small 8-10 rowed varieties. Quantification of
maize remains from village excavations
(Jackson 1981; Ford 1997) suggests that maize
was more prevalent, however, only by the Late
Village (A.D. 1050-1300) occupation at the
site. Such a trend in maize has also been
documented at the Oak Hill Village
(41RK214), where maize ubiquity increased
from 31.6% in the Early Village (ca. A.D.
1150-1250) to 96.9% in the Late Village (ca.
A.D. 1350/1375-1450) (Dering 2004:Table
88). The relative abundance of maize was low

Technical Report No. 174202

compared to hardwood nuts throughout the
Caddo utilization of this settlement. The
general ratio of hardwood nutshells to maize
fragments has been used as a measure of the
relative importance of wild plant foods versus
crops (cf. Scarry and Scarry 2005:267). There
is a general scarcity of seeds from these
archeological deposits.
The cal. AD 779-955 occupation at the Osborn
site (41WD73) in the Upper Sabine Basin
contained maize, hickory nuts, and acorn nuts
in only a limited number of flotation samples
from storage pits. No other domesticates or
seeds were recovered from this Formative
Caddo (ca. A.D. 800-1000) occupation (see
Bruseth and Perttula 1981). Flotation at seven
different Caddo components in the Upper
Sabine Basin dating between ca. A.D. 800 and
A.D. 1350 uniformly contain maize, hickory,
and acorn plant remains in paleobotanical
samples (see Table 8-5).
After ca. A.D. 900 plant exploitation patterns
in the Caddo area are better known. Quantified
paleobotanical remains recovered from
flotation samples are available from a number
of sites dating from the Early Caddo to Late
Caddo periods in northeastern Texas and
northwestern Louisiana (see Table 8-5).
Consequently, there is a better basis for
discussion of plant exploitation patterns than
in earlier periods.
Utilization of Weeds
The most important weedy annuals utilized by
Caddo groups are the oily and starchy seed
complex plants. Oily seeded annuals include
sumpweed and sunflower, while maygrass,
chenopods, knotweed, and little barley
comprise the starchy seed complex. Evidence
from elsewhere in the eastern United States
indicates that the starchy seeded plants, rich in
carbohydrates, began to dominate oily seeds as
seed crops at the same time as the widespread
utilization of maize (Fritz 2000a, 2000b;
Scarry 2003; Gremillion 2004). Furthermore,
the relative emphasis on weeds for their seeds
(and greens), whether they were oily or
starchy, also took place then. In terms of their

365

Chapter 8: Plant Remains from the Lang Pasture Site (41AN38) Anderson County, Texas, and the Character of
Caddo Agriculture in the Upper Neches River Basin

nutritional quality and productive capabilities,
the weedy annuals represent a complementary
pattern of exploitation to maize since both
types of plants are successful colonizers of
disturbed habitat. Changes in weedy annuals
are expressed phenotypically in both
increasing seed size (oily seeds) and number
(starchy seeds), in combination with evidence
for loss of natural seed dispersal, compactness
of seed heads, and the colonization of areas
outside their natural habitat.
Fritz (1986a:214-215) pointed out that
chenopods,
maygrass,
and
sumpweed
domesticates do become scarcer as maize
became the most important plant food source,
and other domesticates were introduced,
including beans and domesticated amaranth.
She suggests that “as maize became what
would seem to have been the most productive
crop, husbandry of the previous staples
appears to have become more casual.
Introgression from the, by then, probably
highly evolved weedy companions may have
been permitted to the point that something
akin to a gradual reversal of the domestication
process went into effect.”

although Crane (1996) has more recently
reported a domesticated variety of Iva annua
from Spoonbill.
At Spoonbill, the presence of seeds of
morning glory and passionflower from the
earliest Caddo component reflects the initial
disturbance of the habitat and the natural
vegetation for the cultivation of domesticated
plants. These plants usually occur in close
association with garden plots, old fields, and
maize stalks (Crane 1982:87).
In the later occupation at the Oak Hill Village,
maize and squash were the only cultigens
identified by Dering (2004). As previously
mentioned, maize ubiquity increased from
31.6% to 96.9% through time, and the “rise in
density suggests that maize farming increased
during the late [ca. A.D. 1350/1375-1450]
occupation” (Dering 2004:332). Seeds of
maygrass and cheno-ams were also
recovered—although only in the Middle
Village
(ca.
A.D.
1250-1350/1375)
occupation—but they may be from wild
plants.
Tropical Cultigens

The Caddo paleobotanical record for the
utilization of weeds for their seeds is
consistent with these general changes in plant
exploitation patterns, although the total
evidence is considerably more limited outside
of the northern Caddo region (e.g., Fritz
1990), as well as outside of the Sulphur River
basin in northeastern Texas (see Table 8-5).
From quantified paleobotanical assemblages,
starchy seeds are present in quantity only after
ca. A.D. 1200, although they were probably
utilized before that time. Oily seeds dominate
the Spoonbill (41WD109) site assemblage
dated between cal AD 967-1160. Sumpweed
and sunflower from that component comprise
more than 65% of the seeds from weedy
annuals present in the assemblage. In the cal
AD 1228-1395 component from Spoonbill,
Chenopodium sp. and knotweed are the only
weedy annuals identified except for one
sunflower achene. Measurements on the oily
seeds by Crane (1982) indicate that they were
non-domesticated varieties of these plants,

366

Tropical cultigens grown by the Caddo
peoples include maize, squash, gourds, and
beans. Only the latter is not well represented
in paleobotanical assemblages, and probably
was not grown to much extent before A.D.
1300, if not slightly later based on
paleobotanical remains from Caddo sites in
southwestern Arkansas (Perttula 2008a:Table
3). Squash and bottle gourd were among the
first tropical cultigens used by the aboriginal
inhabitants of the eastern United States, and
they continued to be cultivated throughout the
Mississippian and Historic periods by these
peoples (Gremillion 2007:393-394). Like
beans, they are poorly represented in
paleobotanical assemblages generally, and
their representation is probably affected by
generally poor preservation conditions on
Caddo sites. Squash is very commonly
recovered in Early Caddo period contexts at
Cooper Reservoir sites, however, with
ubiquity ranging from 50-71.4% at the

Technical Report No. 174202

Archeological Investigations at the Lang Pasture Site (41AN38) in the Upper Neches River Basin of East Texas
Texas Department of Transportation

Lawson, Thomas, and Doctors Creek sites
(Crane 1996:Table G-1), but is otherwise
infrequent
in
Caddo
paleobotanical
assemblages from sites in East Texas.
Although the relative abundance of the
aforementioned tropical domesticates is
generally sporadic, due in large measure to
conditions of preservation and probable food
preparation and disposal techniques, maize is
common in paleobotanical assemblages.
Analyses of flotation results from Caddo
assemblages, however, indicate that while the
utilization of maize was widespread, it was not
as intensively used then as it was to become
after ca. A.D. 1300-1400 (see Table 8-5). The
presence of maize from feature and/or
flotation samples discussed rather consistently
range between 20-60%, except in the Sulphur
River basin (see Table 8-5), where maize
ubiquity is lower. Maize ubiquity in 14th and
early 15th century contexts at the Lang Pasture
site is 42%.
However, measures of relative abundance
commonly employed in paleobotanical
research support the general conclusion that
maize utilization was not as frequent before
ca. A.D. 1300 in an overall sense as was the
procurement of a wide range of wild plant
foods gathered in a generalized foraging and
horticultural economy. The use of these types
of abundance measures, while not as reliable
as other more direct means of dietary
inference such as stable isotopes, does not
dispel the fact that in comparably collected,
quantified, and analyzed paleobotanical
assemblages of the Early and Middle Caddo
periods, maize constituted only one of a wide
range of plant resources utilized by Caddo
peoples.
It does appear to be the case that the use of
maize was more intensive in the eastern part
of the Caddo area, namely in the Ouachita and
Red River basins, as well as the Arkansas
River basin, than was the case among Caddo
groups living in much of East Texas. This is
based on ubiquity measures (Perttula
2008a:Table 3). In Caddo sites of different
ages in northeastern Texas, maize ubiquity—

Technical Report No. 174202

with a few exceptions in the Sabine River
basin—ranged from only 0-19% in the
Sulphur River basin (with the highest
percentage in ca. A.D. 1000-1200 contexts), to
15-47% in the Red River basin (with the
highest percentages in post-A.D. 1300
contexts), to 21-58% in the Sabine River basin
(with the highest percentages after ca. A.D.
1350/1375), and to 6-45% in the Big Cypress
and Neches-Angelina river basins (the highest
percentages are in post-14th century sites, with
the exception of several sites in the Attoyac
Bayou basin where maize ubiquity is low in
later sites [see Perttula 2008b]). By contrast,
Caddo sites in the Red and Ouachita river
basins in Arkansas and northwestern
Louisiana dating after ca. A.D. 1200 have
maize ubiquity measures that range from 40­
94% (see Perttula 2008a:Table 3). After ca.
A.D. 1400, those measures actually range
from 58-94%, all considerably higher than
what has been documented to date from
northeastern Texas Caddo sites.
Corn remains from Caddo sites are variable in
terms of cob size and row numbers, and this is
also reflected in median cupule widths
between different assemblages. Cupule width
of maize may be a good proxy for large
kernels, and larger corn yields. That is, “corn
varieties with larger cupules will tend to
support larger kernels, thus resulting in greater
yields” (Diehl 2005:364). In the Ozark
Highlands, the earliest directly dated and
measured corn (ca. A.D. 750) has the smallest
cupule widths (4.6 mm), while the latest corn
(dated after ca. A.D. 1300) have cupule widths
that are as large as 8.8-11.5 mm (Fritz 1986a).
This supports a trend for larger cupules and
kernels over a ca. 600-700 year period.
However, it is difficult to discern any temporal
trends in cupule width in the Red River (see
Blake 1994), Ouachita River (Cutler and
Blake 2001), or East Texas Caddo sites. In the
Ouachita River basin, cupule widths range
from 4.3-6.2 mm, with widths peaking at ca.
A.D. 1325-1400. Cupule widths range from
3.2-12.0 mm on Red River Caddo sites, but
the largest cupules are reported for the 18th
century Caddo maize from Roseborough Lake
(Fritz 1986c). In East Texas, the largest cupule

367

Chapter 8: Plant Remains from the Lang Pasture Site (41AN38) Anderson County, Texas, and the Character of
Caddo Agriculture in the Upper Neches River Basin

widths are also reported from a historic Caddo
site, in this case the early 19th century Timber
Hill site (Goldborer 2002), while the smallest
(3.2 mm) are in Middle Caddo archeological
deposits at the Oak Hill Village (Elson et al.
2004). Cupule widths at the Lang Pasture site
range from 5.3-5.6 mm.
The very smallest corn (and hence the least
productive) documented is from the
McGuire’s Garden site in the Post Oak
Savanna of east-central Texas; this is a nonCaddo site. Here, in contexts dated from ca.
A.D. 1290-1410, cupule widths are 2.05-4.65
mm on cobs and 2.45-3.76 mm on loose
cupules (Dering 2002). Kibler (2005:198, 200)
argues that the cultivation of maize was “a
short-lived experiment” in this area, and
“never played a major role in the overall
subsistence.”
Most Caddo corn is from 10, 12 and 14-rowed
ears resembling Northern American Pop and
Midwest Twelve Row races. These are corn
varieties with small cobs and cupules, and
longer than wide kernels (Blake and Cutler
1979:53). Archeological samples of maize
dating before A.D. 1400 are dominated by 8and 10- rowed varieties (Perttula 2008a:Figure
5). The earliest maize remains in well-studied
Caddo plant assemblages with preserved cobs
have the highest percentages of 8-rowed corn,
amounting to between 29-44% of the total
samples. These assemblages, of course, have
the lowest mean row number values. After
A.D. 1200 the 10-rowed varieties are most
abundant, and remain so until approximately
A.D. 1400. The corn grown at that time is
commonly ascribed to Midwest Twelve Row,
an intermediate form between North American
Pop and the Eastern Eight Row races
described by Cutler and Blake (2001). The 12
rowed varieties, including some examples of
quite small corn (King 1984) from the
protohistoric Cedar Grove site (3LA97), are
the most common rowed varieties in Caddo
assemblages dating after A.D. 1400 (see also
Fritz 1986c; Goldborer 2002).
These trends in the evolution of maize present
clear evidence for the development of varieties

368

with higher numbers of rows through time in
the Caddo area. This points out the basic
similarity in maize variation across the Caddo
area. Samples from different environmental
settings such as the Ouachita Mountains, the
Red River and Ouachita River basins, and
Arkansas Basin sites, demonstrate that
patterns of variation are significant only at the
areal scale (Perttula 2008a:Figure 5). These
comparisons suggest that the maize varieties
grown by the Caddo peoples of different
regions were quite similar to one another in
character, just as they are to the maize grown
in the lower Mississippi Valley (Blake and
Cutler 1979).
Late Caddo Plant Use
The emphasis on the procurement and use of
weedy annual nuts and a wide variety of
domesticated plants in the Early and Middle
Caddo period paleobotanical assemblages is
not totally duplicated in the Late Caddo (ca.
A.D. 1400-1700) archeological record in East
Texas and elsewhere in the Caddo area.
Instead the paleobotanical record indicates: (a)
a reduction in wild plant food utilization,
especially with the weedy annuals, (b) a deemphasis on nuts, and (c) a higher relative
abundance of beans, squash, and gourd
accompanied by more frequent use of maize.
Caddo subsistence remained geographically
variable. Our best measure of the importance
of maize in the diet of Caddo peoples comes
from stable isotope analyses from sites
throughout the Caddo area (see Perttula 1996,
2008a; Rogers 1997; Rogers et al. 2003; Rose
et al. 1998; Wilson 2008), including the stable
carbon and nitrogen values obtained from
burials at the Lang Pasture site and other
upper Neches River basin Caddo sites.
The stable carbon isotope information from
sites in the southern Caddo area indicates that
around A.D. 1100-1200, there was a
significant increase in the consumption of
maize, as marked by C4-enriched samples at
that time. Later Caddo samples leveled out
and reached a measure of stasis after ca. AD
1250-1300 (Perttula 2008a:Figure 6), although
in the upper Neches River basin, isotopic

Technical Report No. 174202

Archeological Investigations at the Lang Pasture Site (41AN38) in the Upper Neches River Basin of East Texas
Texas Department of Transportation

values after the 14th century suggest that the
importance of maize continued to increase in
the Caddo diet (Wilson 2008, see also Wilson,
this volume), peaking at ca. A.D. 1650 (during
the Allen phase). In the Arkansas River valley
of eastern Oklahoma, there was a more
gradual increase in the consumption of maize
through time (as well as the consumption of
bison meat), with the most enriched samples
dating after ca. A.D. 1250-1450 (Rogers 1997)
and peaking during the Fort Coffee phase.
At the 15th and 16th century Pilgrim’s Pride
site in the Big Cypress Creek basin (Dering
2005; Perttula 2005), and at other Late Caddo
Titus phase sites, maize and beans recovered
in feature contexts provide the best evidence
for later Caddo agricultural production in East
Texas. Notably absent from these Titus phase
sites is evidence for the use of oily and starchy
seeds of the eastern Agricultural Complex
(Fritz 2000a; Scarry 2003). Nevertheless, the
abundance of charred nutshells, and a high
nut-to-wood
ratio
(Dering
2005:345),
indicated that nut mast collection and
processing was also an important part of the
subsistence strategy there, more so than at the
contemporaneous Lang Pasture site; the nut to
wood ratio at the Pilgrim’s Pride site was
1.4:1, compared to only 0.5:1 at the Lang
Pasture site. Dering (2005:345) concluded that
the Caddo “clearly relied on maize-based food
production as a major source of subsistence,
but were not as heavily invested in plant food
production as were some of the much larger
regional settlements to the north and east in
this part of the Caddo archeological area.” The
same may be said for Caddo maize-based food
production efforts at the Lang Pasture site in
the upper Neches River basin.
In the Ouachita River basin, at sites occupied
by the Caddo after ca. A.D. 1400, such as
Helm (Powell and Lopinot 2000), Hardman
(Fritz 1993), Winding Stair (Williams 2000),
and Standridge (Early 1988), a wide variety of
wild plant and tropical cultigens have been
recovered. This includes a heterogeneous mix
of maize with from 8-14 rows, starchy seeds,
oily seeds, squash/gourds, and beans. Mean
maize row numbers increase through time,

Technical Report No. 174202

from 10.2 rows at ca. A.D. 1100-1200 to 11.2
rows from ca. A.D. 1450-1535. This trend is
consistent with the result of environmental and
human selection towards many-rowed crops.
The 17th century Joe Clark and McLelland
sites along the Red River in northwestern
Louisiana had high-rowed maize, beans,
squash, cultivated sunflower and sumpweed
(Gardner 1997:116), as well as maygrass, and
chenopod. None of the seeds of the eastern
Agricultural Complex are abundant. Gardner
(1997:116) suggests that the thin-testa
domesticated chenopod from the two sites
represents a cultivated small grain described
among the Natchez in the early 18th century.
At the Belcher site on the Red River near
Shreveport, Louisiana, deposits of charred
corn cobs (12-row and 16-row) were found on
the floor of 17th century Belcher phase houses,
along with persimmon seeds, beans, black
walnut, and hickory nuts (Webb 1959:179­
180).
Beans are abundant in this same set of Late
Caddo sites (see Perttula 2008a:Table 3), and
the size of the beans are consistent with
selection for increasing seed size and plant
productivity. Length to width ratios of bean
seeds from these sites range from 1.60 for ca.
A.D. 1000-1200 components, and 1.73-1.77
on Caddo sites dating from ca. A.D. 1400­
1600. Beans from historic Indian sites dating
after A.D. 1600 are even larger, with ratios of
1.84-1.90 (Blake and Cutler 1982:Table 3).
Measurable cotyledons of beans from
elsewhere in the Caddo area are limited, but
the length/width ratios are consistent with the
trends noted in the Ouachita River basin.
Beans from the Washington Square Mound
site in Nacogdoches County, Texas, dated at
ca. A.D. 1250-1420, have length/width ratios
of 1.60 (Gennett 1983). Those from an Early
to Middle Caddo period context at Beaver
Pond Bluffs had length/width ratios of 1.55
(Fritz 1986b:Table 14).
In general, these changes in Late Caddo times
regionally may be marked by a reduction in
the number of domesticated plants used as
staples, with an increasing reliance on one or a

369

Chapter 8: Plant Remains from the Lang Pasture Site (41AN38) Anderson County, Texas, and the Character of
Caddo Agriculture in the Upper Neches River Basin

few species of plants in a specialized
subsistence strategy. This focus on one or a
few plant species may have resulted in the
displacement and/or differing use of other
wild and cultivated plants that had previously
been important parts of the diet. The selective
effects of increasing productivity in these few
species resulted in the relative proportional
use of these resources at the expense of the
displaced resources.
The relative percentage of nutshell remains in
Late Caddo period paleobotanical samples
ranges between 57-60% of the total plant food
weights, compared to estimates of 87-100% in
previously mentioned Early and Middle Caddo
assemblages; at the Lang Pasture site,
however, the proportion is ca. 83% (see Table
8-1), suggesting a continued regular use of
hickory nuts. The same types of plant species
were harvested by Caddo populations, but the
importance of the harvesting was changing
through time. Any major increase in maize
productivity relative to the potential
productivity of wild plant foods—as well as to
weedy annuals with a less inherent capacity
for productivity increases compared to
maize—would mean a reorientation of plant
husbandry and associated wild plant foraging
activities. Thus, this characteristic of maize
would have a positive influence on its fitness.
Changes in preparation techniques, storage
methods (i.e., a shift to above-ground
granaries to save seed for the following year’s
crop and for maintenance of the food supply
for 1-2 years) or harvesting strategies, may
also have been critical in Caddo efforts at
maize intensification. Archeological evidence
from sites in the Red, Sabine, and Big Cypress
basins point to a change in some
circumstances from below-ground storage pits
to above-ground granaries after ca. A.D. 1350­
1450 (Perino 1981; Trubowitz 1984); Rogers
and Perttula 2004); the use of below-ground
storage pits continued at the Lang Pasture site,
however. These granaries are also documented
in the ethnohistorical records as the primary
means of food storage used by the Caddo
peoples.

CONCLUSIONS

The ethnographic and ethnohistorical data on
the Caddo utilization of wild and cultivated
plant foods is a record of the primary use of
maize, beans, and squash (Swanton 1942),
including up to six varieties of beans and
squash as well as sunflower and tobacco.
There is no archeological or paleobotanical
evidence of the use of tobacco, which is
difficult to recover because of the small size of
the seeds. At least two varieties of maize were
described by Europeans as grown by the
Caddo, but paleobotanical evidence from Late
Caddo and Historic period occupations (see
Ford 1982; King 1984; Goldborer 2002)
suggest that the varieties mentioned by the
Europeans actually referred to differences in
harvesting strategies rather than to physical
differences in the maize itself. Eight-ten­
twelve- fourteen-and 16-rowed varieties of
North American Pop, Midwest 12 Row, and
Eastern Eight Row races were present and
being cultivated during those periods of time.
Tremendous variability existed among Caddo
populations through time and across space in
their agricultural practices, their food
production success, as well as their absolute
dependence upon cultivated foods in the diet.
A wide array of cultigens were grown—
including the tropical cultigens corn (kish-sih
in Caddo), beans (bah-hey), and pumpkin
(coo-nooh-cah-ke-cus-neh)—as
well
as
various oily and starchy seeds, among them
chenopods/lambsquarter
(bah-ha-tse),
sunflower (bah-hun), marsh elder, and
maygrass. Hickory and acorn nutshells were
also important plant foods. The Caddo also
talk of the e-ha-si-nai, a wild tuber that was
found in northwestern Louisiana and East
Texas (Newkumet and Meredith 1988:33).
The Caddo believe all these plants are gifts
from the earth that “they were to hold and use
for their benefit. The two gifts most closely
associated with the earth were corn and
pumpkin” (Newkumet and Meredith 1988:30).
The available archeological and paleo­
botanical evidence recovered from Woodland
and prehistoric/historic Caddo sites suggest

Technical Report No. 174202

Archeological Investigations at the Lang Pasture Site (41AN38) in the Upper Neches River Basin of East Texas
Texas Department of Transportation

that these various cultivated and harvested
plants were most intensively used beginning
after around A.D. 800/900. A number of them
had been grown and used for at least a
millennium before that. By A.D. 800/900, the
Caddo
lived
in
complex
sedentary
communities. Intensive food production
strategies, however, became most important
across almost all of the landscape occupied by
the Caddo only after about ca. A.D.
1200/1300. As tropical cultigens became the
dominant crops, the other plant foods were
much diminished in use and eventually were
no longer grown. Such is the case at the Lang
Pasture site, where in early 14th to early 15th
century A.D. domestic contexts, maize was the
most important domesticated plant food as
seen in the paleobotanical analyses; stable
isotope analyses of Lang Pasture burials
provide further confirmation of the relative
importance of maize in prehistoric upper
Neches River basin Caddo diets.

Technical Report No. 174202

The Caddo agricultural strategies and
economies (based on domesticated plants and
various wild plant foods) across the East
Texas Caddo area were resilient and flexible,
and apparently designed to suit the changing
environments and seasons along the western
frontier of the eastern Woodlands, and as part
of their critical understanding of the rhythms
of plant growth. The Caddo believe they came
into the world carrying the seeds of corn and
pumpkin.
End Note

1. Youngblood (2008:Table 1) mentions other
supposedly early dates on maize from the
George C. Davis site, but all of the dates she
cited are inexplicably later than 1010 B.P.
(A.D. 940).

Archeological Investigations at the Lang Pasture Site (41AN38) in the Upper Neches River Basin of East Texas
Texas Department of Transportation

CHAPTER 9
9FAUNAL REMAINS
David B. Kelley

9.1

INTRODUCTION

The 2006 excavations at the Lang Pasture site
(41AN38) yielded a small quantity of
vertebrate faunal remains that were generally
highly fragmented and poorly preserved. The
total sample analyzed consisted of 1,759
specimens, of which 1,016 (57.8 percent) were
unidentifiable. This is an exceptionally high
percentage of unidentifiable remains, and it is
directly related to the poor bone preservation
at the site. The 743 identifiable specimens
consisted almost entirely of relatively dense
mammalian remains.
9.2

PREVIOUS RESEARCH IN THE
REGION

At present only a handful of sizeable faunal
assemblages from Caddo sites in the middle
Neches River basin have been reported on.
This is partly due to the limited number of
excavations that have been undertaken there,
but also to the often poor bone preservation
found in not only this region, but much of East
Texas.
One site in this region that has produced wellpreserved faunal remains is the ALCOA #1
site (41AN87), a small Frankston phase
farmstead or hamlet located about 7 km
northeast of Palestine, Texas on a terrace
overlooking Mound Prairie Creek (Amick et
al. 1991). Excavations in a thick trash midden
at the site yielded an assemblage that included
catfish, gar, buffalo fish, frog, box turtle,
turkey, a raptor, unidentified large- and
medium-sized birds, opossum, cottontail,
swamp rabbit, squirrel, raccoon, white-tailed
deer, and bison (Amick et al. 1991:14).

Technical Report No. 174202

Unfortunately, the authors did not quantify
their data other than to note that white-tailed
deer remains dominated the collection, and
that bison was represented by a single
element.
Lee Anna Schniebs analyzed a small
collection of faunal remains recovered from
six shovel tests and a 50 x 50 cm unit
excavated in a midden deposit located in a
portion of the Lang Pasture site about 10 m
west of the SH 155 right-of-way. She noted
that the bone from this area was fragmented,
but “generally well-preserved” (Perttula et al.
2007c:34). Of the 118 specimens recovered,
mammals accounted for 95 percent of the
number of identified specimens (NISP). The
most common mammalian species was whitetailed deer, followed by opossum, and an
unidentified species of rabbit. The only other
taxa represented were box turtle and an
unidentified turtle.
Recently, Schniebs (2007) also reported on
another relatively small collection from the
Kah-hah-ko-wha site (41CE354) on Flat Creek
in northwestern Cherokee County.
This
assemblage is associated with an Allen phase
occupation that dates from the midseventeenth century to the early eighteenth
century. A total of 714 specimens were
recovered from test excavations in two areas
of the site. Mammals accounted for 90
percent of the identified remains, and the most
abundant species was white-tailed deer
(Schniebs 2007:Table 23).
Cottontail,
opossum, and squirrel were also present, but in
very low frequencies. Reptiles, in this case
turtles, made up 9 percent of the NISP. At
least two turtle taxa were represented, box

375

Chapter 9: Faunal Remains

turtle and the mud-musk turtle family. The
only other taxa present were a few
unidentified fish remains and a single turkey
element. A high percentage of the remains
from the Kah-hah-ko-wha site, 78 percent
from the site as a whole and 99 percent from
one area, were burned, suggesting that
preservation bias had a significant effect on
this assemblage.
9.3

METHODOLOGY

The faunal remains analyzed from the Lang
Pasture site consisted of material recovered
from ¼-inch screen and from flotation
samples. The material from flotation samples
came from the heavy fraction, which was
collected in window screen.
Identification of the material from the Lang
Pasture site was performed by comparing the
archeologicalspecimens to elements in the
comparative collections of the author, Coastal
Environments, Inc., and the Museum of
Natural Science at Louisiana State University,
Baton Rouge.
The analysis involved
identification of taxon, element, element
symmetry, element portion, and specimen
count. Information was also recorded on
evidence of burning, butchery, use, and age at
death indicators. Bones that were identifiable
only to class (e.g. mammal, bird, fish, etc.)
were placed into size categories of small,
medium, and large, if possible. All of the data
were then entered into a spreadsheet program,
Microsoft Excel, in order to facilitate
manipulation of the information.
Quantification
Quantification of the faunal remains consisted
of one primary figure, NISP, and one
secondary figure, the minimum number of
individuals (MNI). The limitation of NISP is
apparent when attempting to assess the
amount of edible portions contributed by each
species. For example, if white-tailed deer was
represented in one assemblage by five left
femora and five right femora and in another
assemblage was represented by ten right
femora, though the number of specimens in

376

each assemblage would be equal, the number
of deer represented, and therefore the amount
of available meat, would differ. NISP cannot
account for the distinction of individuals of a
particular species.
To determine the number of individuals of a
species that were present, the most common
unit of measure is MNI. MNI is a figure
calculated by assessing the minimum number
of individual animals represented within an
assemblage based on the frequency of specific
elements. For example, if there are five right
femora and three left femora of a species, the
minimum number of individuals that are
represented is five. MNI can also take into
consideration age or sex differences in the
remains.
While MNI overcomes some of the
shortcomings of NISP, it has limitations in
terms of how accurately it reflects the
frequency and dietary importance of certain
taxa. One problem is that MNI can be
calculated in a number of ways, thus
introducing an enormous variable when
comparing
assemblages
analyzed
and
interpreted by different researchers. Another
difficulty is that MNI, which by definition
offers
a
minimum
number,
often
underestimates the true frequency of
individuals, especially well-represented ones.
Also, MNI does not account for the percentage
of the species' skeleton that is present. A
species represented by single bone will receive
a MNI of one, while another species,
represented by every bone in the skeleton, will
also receive a MNI of one.

played an important part in the faunal
exploitation strategies of the site’s occupants,
this exceptionally high percentage is a
reflection of preservation bias favoring the
remains of larger animals with denser bones.
White-tailed deer account for the majority of
the mammal remains that are identifiable
below the level of class. Most of the deer
bone consists of relatively small fragments of
dense elements, such as teeth, metapodials,
carpals, tarsals and phalanges. However,
antler fragments, which are also very dense,
are not present, suggesting that they were
being curated for tool manufacture. At least
three individuals are represented based on
right astragali, two adults and a fawn.

Technical Report No. 174202

Remains of the fawn occurred in two units
located immediately south of Structure 1,
while the adult remains were much more
widely scattered.
Most of the features
contained no more than a single deer bone, the
exceptions being Features 76, 76A, and 79.
The only other mammal represented by more
than four specimens is a canid (Canis spp.)
represented by 36 mandible and tooth
fragments found in the 45-50 cm level of a
single unit near the southern edge of the site.
The material was too fragmentary to identify
to species level; however, based on the size of
the teeth the animal was probably a dog, as
they are too small for wolf and too large for
coyote.

Table 9-2. Vertebrate Faunal Remains Recovered from Features at the Lang Pasture

Archeological Investigations at the Lang Pasture Site (41AN38) in the Upper Neches River Basin of East Texas
Texas Department of Transportation

A small number of rabbit (Sylvilagus spp.)
remains were recovered from the excavations.
Like much of the faunal material these were
highly fragmented and could not be identified to
species. All of these remains were recovered in
flotation samples from features, two from
Feature 25, one from Feature 76A, and one from
Feature 79.
Remains of two mammals that represent recent
additions to the archeologicaldeposits were also
present. These include a single cow (Bos
taurus) molar and four cranial elements of Plains
Pocket Gopher (Geomys bursarius), all of the
latter recovered from a single unit. Gophers
have burrowed extensively at the site, and were
still active at the time of the excavations.
Unidentified mammal and unidentified large
mammal represent the two largest categories of
mammalian remains. Most of these remains
consisted of small, weathered fragments of long
bone shafts or other dense elements. Many of
the unidentified large mammal specimens are
probably from white-tailed deer, but cannot be
confidently identified as such.

Technical Report No. 174202

Reptiles
Reptiles are the only other class represented in
the faunal remains, and they consist of only
three specimens of turtle carapace that could not
be identified to genus or species. Interestingly,
all of the turtle remains occurred in the area
immediately north of Structure 1.
These
elements are relatively dense, so their low
frequency is probably an accurate reflection of
their limited exploitation, rather than
preservation bias.
9.5

SUMMARY

The collection of faunal remains recovered from
the Lang Pasture site is relatively small and
poorly preserved. This is largely due to a
combination of chemical weathering from the
strongly acid soil on which the site is located
and gnawing by gophers. Only in a few of the
features, particularly two of the hearths, Features
25 and 36, were larger samples of faunal
remains recovered.
The bone from these
contexts is still highly fragmented, and the
increased sample size appears to be related to
the high percentage of burned bone present there
(over 60 percent).
Unfortunately the
preservation problems encountered in the faunal
assemblage recovered from Lang Pasture
prevent its use for addressing questions related
to subsistence at the site.

CHAPTER 10
10ANALYSIS OF HUMAN REMAINS FROM THE LANG PASTURE SITE
Diane Wilson

10.1

INTRODUCTION

The study of the Lang Pasture site (41AN38)
human remains has two objectives and hopes to
test one hypothesis. The first is to provide a
written report of an osteological examination
conducted on the remains recovered from the
Lang Pasture site and human remains housed at
the Texas Archeological Research Laboratory
(TARL) from 14 Caddo sites in Anderson and
neighboring Cherokee counties. The second
objective is to provide a synthetic regional
review of Caddo bioarchaeology incorporating
the new information with bioarchaeological
information already published on Caddo human
remains from the southern Caddo region.
Finally, the data collected here will be used to
test the hypothesis that the Caddo from the Lang
Pasture site and the rest of the Upper Neches
River basin had a diet low in maize and a low
rate of infectious disease. The human remains
were examined following standard osteological
procedures outlined in Buikstra and Ubelaker
(1994) and the Texas A&M University
Department of Anthropology Data Collection
Forms (Steele et al. 1993). Information gleaned
from each burial was recorded in a standard
osteological database and provided the
information used for the analysis presented here.
The analysis of the recently excavated Lang
Pasture human remains and the newly collected
data on human remains housed at TARL provide
an inventory of the remains recovered from the
Upper Neches River Basin, address issues
concerning the state of preservation of the
remains, the body size and sexual dimorphism of
the Caddo from this region, an evaluation of the
population’s diet and health, and an assessment
of their biological affinity to other populations

Technical Report No. 174202

within the region. (Editor’s note: Due to their
great length, the data tables for this chapter—
Tables 10-1 through 10-24-- are placed on the
compact disk, as Appendix H, found in the
sleeve in the back cover of this report).
10.2

INVENTORY

Establishing an inventory of the individuals in
the assemblages and the material representing
each individual is the prerequisite to any
osteological analysis. The inventory serves as a
description of remains present and is useful in
assessments of preservation, health, mortuary
patterns, bioturbation and other postmortem
disturbances, excavation conditions and
techniques, and soil conditions.
In addition to the Lang Pasture site, 14 other
sites containing human remains are reported on
here. Determining the number of burials per site
in this region can be problematic due to poor
preservation, excavation strategies and the
activities of collectors. At the Lang Pasture site
the remains of nine individuals were recovered.
In addition, machine scrapings produced some
human bone fragments. It was not possible to
associate these fragments with the nine isolated
individuals so their context remains unknown.
The number of individuals examined from other
sites in the Upper Neches basin ranged from one
to 15. Only the Jim Allen and George C. Davis
sites were represented by more than nine
individuals. In all, a minimum of 72 individuals
were examined for this study. The mean number
of individuals examined per site is 4.6. Rose
and Burnett (1990) gave a mean of 8.7
individuals per Caddo site from the eastern
portion of the Gulf Coastal Plain. This is similar

381

Chapter 10: Analysis of Human Remains from the Lang Pasture Site

to the number of individuals recovered from the
Lang Pasture Site.
For this study burials were assigned to time
periods following Story’s (1990) categories
based
on
radiocarbon
dates,
archeologicalcontext and associations. Two
sites were left out of the temporal analysis: the
Lee Ellis site and the Isibell Gene Donnell site
could not be placed into a refined time period
within the Caddo sequence. For all analyses of
sites, dating was done based on the majority of
burials. For example, the Lang Pasture site has
individuals dated to the Middle and Late Caddo
periods, but since a majority dated to the latter
part of the Middle Caddo period, it was placed
into the Middle Caddo period. All stable isotope
analyses were performed on an individual rather
than site basis. For all analyses of individuals,
burial dates stand. For example, the Formative
Caddo period individual from the George C.
Davis site remains as an example from the
Formative Caddo period rather than being
lumped into the Early Caddo period.
10.3

TAPHONOMY

The issues most commonly raised when
evaluating the taphonomic processes affecting
human remains deal with documenting the
extent of postmortem degradation and loss of
skeletal remains; understanding the processes of
destruction and dispersal of bones; and assessing
the role of humans as agents causing
modification, destruction, and dispersal of
human skeletal remains at archeologicalsites.
The human remains in much of the southern
portion of the Caddo region in Texas are poorly
preserved. Bones can be so degraded as to be
recognized only by stains in the soil and burial
offerings. Feature 91 from the Lang Pasture
site, for example, consisted of one enamel
fragment from an unidentifiable tooth, and in
another burial, Feature 94, no bones or teeth
were preserved. The analysis presented here
provides an objective assessment of the state of
preservation. Tables 10-1, 10-2, and 10-3
provide summaries of the elements recovered
from the sites examined for this report. The
tables show that all skeletons are missing

382

skeletal elements and most of the bones present
are incomplete. An examination of the skull
shows that the interments follow a pattern
typical for skeletons buried in the soil. That is,
bones of the face are less common and less well
preserved than those of the braincase. Bones of
the braincase (frontal, parietals, temporals and
occipital) have thicker cortices than the thin
cortical bone found in the facial bones (e,g.,
maxilla, palatine and zygomatic). In the postcranium, long bones were more common and
recovered in larger fragments than bones of the
chest, back, pelvis, hands and feet. No palatines,
sternum body, thoracic vertebra 10, eleventh and
twelfth ribs, and pubis bones were recovered in
the entire Upper Neches River basin sample.
One problem with the inventory scoring method
was found in the mandible and frontal. In these
bones, inventory procedures follow those for
bones that have left and right sides because both
bones develop from bones with left and right
sides into a whole unit. Once the bones have
become whole units (adults), they were scored
with one completeness score rather than a score
for each side.
In the computer they are
automatically scored as an unsided element,
causing some possible confusion as to whether a
bone fragment from the mandible or frontal is
unsided or could be sided.
The site with the most skeletal elements per
person represented was the Emma Owens Farm
(41AN21) (Table 10-4). This site only had the
remains of one individual. This individual had
nearly half of the skeletal elements (47 percent)
coded for in the inventory database represented.
The one individual from the Isibell-Genen
Donnell site had the worst skeletal
representation with less than one percent of the
skeletal elements present. The Lang Pasture site
averaged 7.2 percent of the skeletal elements
preserved. This was worse than the average for
the entire sample of 12.9 percent. Inventory
preservation scores indicate that the Forest
Mound site (41CE290) had the best preservation
of the elements represented. The combined
sample had a mean preservation score of 2.2.
The skeletal elements from the one individual
represented from the Forest Mound site
averaged a score of 1.1 with 1 being the best
preservation and 3 being the worst. The worst

Technical Report No. 174202

Archeological Investigations at the Lang Pasture Site (41AN38) in the Upper Neches River Basin of East Texas
Texas Department of Transportation

preserved site was the Isibell-Gene Donnell site
(41AN14) with a mean score of 3.0. The
individuals from the Lang Pasture site had an
average preservation score of 2.7, again showing
that the site had poor preservation.
The taphonomic processes affecting the Upper
Neches River Basin sites are much the same as
for other sites from East Texas. As in much of
the southern Caddo archeologicalregion the dry
and brittle condition of the bones, along with
their low organic content can be attributed to
acidic soil. In addition, the soil is relatively fine
grained which does not impede drainage. Water
damage is mainly enhanced when the burial pit
and its remains are excavated into a Bt horizon,
and the burial pit would hold water during
precipitation events. This repeated wetting and
with slow rates of drying further intensifies bone
destruction through the leaching of organic bone
matter into the surrounding matrix. Gill-King
(1990) was one of the first to describe this
process in the region.
Although geological modification inhibited
observation of other forms of surface
destruction, root etching was common in the
Lang Pasture site. Root etching was observed in
all individuals from the Lang Pasture site. Root
etching was present in 45 percent of the
remaining individuals from the Upper Neches
River basin (49 observable individuals). Other
forms of biological modification include rodent
gnawing in three individuals and insect boring in
two individuals from the Lang Pasture site.
Rodent gnawing was the second most common
biological modification and was observed in
21.3 percent of the remaining Upper Neches
River basin population, followed by insect
boring which was present in 15 percent of the
population (47 observable individuals for both).
There was no evidence of human modification
of bone in the form of burning or cut marks in
the entire Upper Neches River basin sample.
Cut marks have been recorded in the Roitsch
population (Derrick et al. 2008) but are rare in
Caddo sites.

10.4

DEMOGRAPHY

The age and sex of individuals from the Lang
Pasture site and other Upper Neches River Basin
sites were assessed using a variety of techniques
(Table 10-5). Individuals were age assessed
using one or more of the following: dental
formation stage (Moores et al. 1963a, 1963b),
dental eruption (Ubelaker 1978), dental wear
compared to Texas Red River Caddo (Wilson
1997), external, palatine and internal cranial
vault suture closure (Meindl and Lovejoy 1985,
Buikstra and Ubelaker 1994), epiphyseal fusion
(Baker et al. 2005) and size and features of
immature remains (Baker et al. 2005). Sex was
determined using one or more of the following
techniques: cranial and/or pelvic observations
(Krogman 1962; Steele and Bramblett 1988),
femoral head circumference (Stewart 1979),
femoral midshaft circumference (Black 1978),
talus length (Steele 1976) and dental
discriminate function formulae (Ditch and Rose
1972).
Table 10-5 provides a summary of age and sex
data for the Lang Pasture and comparable Upper
Neches River basin human remains.
The
average age at death for the Lang Pasture Site is
29.3. This is nearly the same average age at
death as for sites from the Cooper Lake region at
29.1 years (Wilson and Steele 1997) and the
Pine Tree Mound site at 29.6 (Wilson 2008a)
and similar to the Mitchell site but higher than
the Hatchel site both on the Red River (Lee
1997:163). The Lang Pasture site is lower than
the mean for the summary data from the Neches
River at 32.5 years presented by Burnett (1990,
1999).
The Upper Neches River basin population
examined here has an average age of death of
34.2 years. When the individuals from the Lang
Pasture site are included, this average drops to
32.9 years and is nearly identical to Burnett’s
(1990, 1999) findings. Compared to Burnett’s
(1990, 1999) summary data from other river
basins, the Upper Neches average age at death is
higher than other Caddo populations. In looking
at Burnett’s (1990, 1999) data there is a general
south to southwestern progression of increasing
age at death through the Caddo region in Texas

383

Chapter 10: Analysis of Human Remains from the Lang Pasture Site

which may be the result of differential burial
practices, preservation of subadults, or a real
increase in longevity.
The average age of death for adults from the
Lang Pasture site is high at 42.2 years. This is
higher than all other comparable data except
from the Pine Tree Mound site (Wilson 2008a)
at 41.1, and suggests an absence of young adults
in the population. It is higher than at the mound
sites of Sanders (35.8) and Mitchell (38.3)
(Wilson 1997). The Lang Pasture adult average
age at death is also higher than the summary
data for the Neches River drainage at 35.9
(Burnett 1990, 1999). The Upper Neches River
basin has an adult average age of death of 39.8
without the individuals from the Lang Pasture
site and an adult average age at death of 40.0
when they are included. This is higher than
summary data for the other river drainages
where the Caddo resided on the eastern Gulf
Coastal Plain. Only the Cooper Lake population
had a higher adult average age at death at 44.6
(Wilson and Steele 1997).
The average age at death did not differ
significantly through time. A larger sample is
needed to determine if the decreased life
expectancy during the Historic period seen in
this study will bear out. In the Upper Neches
River basin population, the Historic period as
represented by the Jim Allen site had an average
age of death of 25.8 years. This is an apparent
decrease from the Late Caddo period average
age of death at 32.1 years, which itself is a slight
decrease from the Middle period average of 35.9
years. The Early Caddo period average age of
death is nearly the same as the Middle Caddo
period at 34.3 years. Adult average ages at
death paralleled the site averages. The Historic
period mean as represented by the Jim Allen site
was approximately five years less than for the
other time periods (Early Caddo mean = 40.6,
Middle Caddo mean = 43.8, Late Caddo period
mean = 41.4, Historic mean = 35.2).
Where demographic data have been provided,
males appear to have outlived females
throughout the Texas Caddo region. The Lang
Pasture site does not follow this pattern, but the
Upper Neches River basin does. Based upon the

384

three individuals for whom sex could be
determined, females had a higher average age at
death at 43.8 years than the male at 40.0 years.
The difference between males and females is
greater when the entire Upper Neches River
basin is examined. Males had an average age of
death of 43.7 while females have an average age
of death of 33.0. When the individuals from the
Lang Pasture site are included the average age of
death for females is 34.5 and the average age of
death for males is 43.4. Despite a difference of
almost nine years, the difference in life
expectancy is not statistically significant. A
significant difference between male and female
average age of death was found in the Cooper
Lake population with males averaging 46.6
years compared to 38.4 for females (Wilson and
Steele 1997). This is the same pattern with a
smaller difference recorded in the Sanders (38.5
years and 35.6 years) and Mitchell (38.3 years
and 35.6 years) populations (Wilson 1997). The
higher mean age at death for males is common
historically and is assumed to be a reflection of
higher mortality of adolescent and young adult
females due to complications of pregnancy and
childbirth.
The adult sex ratio from the Upper Neches River
basin is 14 females to 16 males, inclusive of the
Lang Pasture Caddo. Throughout the Caddo
region in Texas there is a nearly even sex ratio
(Table 10-6). It should be noted that Rose
(1984) suggested that a sex ratio of more males
than females is the norm for Caddo sites, but
Derrick et al. (2008), in a review of sites
neighboring the Roitsch site, finds females
typically outnumber males.
10.5

BODY SIZE AND SEXUAL
DIMORPHISM

Tables 10-7, 10-8, 10-9, 10-10, and 10-11
provide all measurements recorded during the
analysis of the skeletal and dental remains from
the Lang Pasture site and the Upper Neches
River basin. The relatively poor state of
preservation is reflected in the small number of
measurements that could be taken. Stature
estimates were not possible due to the
incomplete nature of the remains from the Upper
Neches River basin.

Since stature estimates were not available, three
measurements were chosen to examine the
degree of sexual dimorphism: circumference at
the nutrient foramen of the tibia, anteriorposterior diameter at the nutrient foramen of the
tibia and the transverse diameter of the nutrient
foramen of the tibia. Measurements of the tibia
were chosen because these bones directly bear
body weight and femoral measures were only
available for males. Table 10-12 documents
these measurements for females and males in the
Upper Neches River basin.
Stini (1985) found the range of male/female
body size ratios to be between 104 and 111.
Stature estimates for the Caddo fall within this
range. Doran’s (1975) Caddo sample had a sex
ratio of 106 for stature. The Roitsch site has a
sex ratio of 103.3 for stature (Derrick et al.
2008). Populations from Sam Kaufman (Butler
1969) had a sex ratio of 106.1 for stature. Based
on Loveland’s data (1986), the Rowland Clark
site population had a sex ratio of 105.4 and the
Clark site population had a sex ratio of 108.1.
Femoral measures from the Cooper Lake
assemblage and tibia measurements presented
here are near the upper limit for sexual
dimorphism. Taken together, the Caddo had a
higher degree of sexual dimorphism in terms of
robusticity than stature when compared to other
populations. While robusticity and stature are
under genetic influence, they are also controlled
by the quantity and quality of diet and the health
of individuals. Robusticity is also influenced by
workloads. While the sample size is small, Table
10-12 shows that the female has a wider tibia
than males, males have deeper tibiae that are
more robust overall. The difference in shape
likely corresponds to a difference in activity
patterns and weight bearing.

POPULATION AFFINITIES

The population affinity of the Caddo is an
important topic given the Caddo geographic
location between Plains, Mississippian, and
Texas hunter-gatherer populations. The Caddo
spoke a Caddo language but were culturally
similar to Mississippian populations. To date,
the most thorough is the study by Lee (1999).
Using cranial and dental non-metric traits she

Technical Report No. 174202

showed that the Caddo were a genetically
homogenous group with genetic admixture
concentrated in the Red River Valley during the
A.D. 1200-1600 period and limited both before
and after that time period. The Lang Pasture site
is located within the time period of greatest
population admixture but outside of the
geographic region of heterogeneity. Lee (1999)
found that populations within the Angelina,
Neches, and Neosho rivers and Cypress Creek
were closely related with a possible closer link
to the Upper Red than Lower Red River
populations. The population from the Neches
River was found to be homogenous through time
based on cranial and dental non-metric features
(Lee 1999).
Non-metric traits were recorded using the Texas
A&M University scoring system (Steele et al.
1993) while dental traits were scored using the
abbreviated ASU system recommended by
Buikstra and Ubelaker (1994). Dental traits were
scored using ASU reference plaques. Nonmetric cranial and postcranial traits are
presented in Tables 10-13 and 10-14 while
dental traits are given in Table 10-15.
The goal of this section was to compare the
individuals from the Lang Pasture site to Lee’s
(1999) findings since these were the only
individuals not included in her study. Poor
preservation restricted the observations from the
Lang Pasture site. Only the absence of a
metopic suture was a comparable data point in
cranial traits. Lee (1999) found all individuals
she examined from her Middle period in the
Neches River drainage to lack a metopic suture.
While this study re-examined many of the
individuals included in Lee’s (1999) study,
Lee’s study was far larger than the present one
and a sub-sample of the data set did not produce
significant differences in trait observations so
her conclusions are assumed to hold for the
Upper Neches population examined here.
Dental data from the Lang Pasture site were
similarly problematic. Only 10 of the traits
scored for in this study were considered
significant by Lee (1999). The two traits from
the Lang Pasture site that were considered
valuable, Carabelli’s trait and the Hypocone, in

385

Chapter 10: Analysis of Human Remains from the Lang Pasture Site

Lee’s (1999) analysis did not fall outside the
pattern she found. Again, the majority of trait
scores from the Upper Neches River basin
matched Lee’s (1999) observations and indicate
that the population was congruous with the
Caddo living in Texas south and west of the Red
River during her Middle period.
It is
unfortunate that the small number of traits
observable from the Lang Pasture population
make it impossible to test Lee’s (1999)
hypothesis that biological distance among the
Caddo was more affected by social status than
geography.
10.7

DIET

Dietary choices are a reflection of cultural norms
and the natural environment. A maize-intensive
diet is one of the hallmarks of the Caddo
archeologicalculture and is used to separate
them from hunter-gatherer neighbors and
predecessors. To determine what a population
ate, most bioarchaeologists focus on dental
remains and/or stable isotope analysis on bone.
This study uses dental remains and stable
isotope analysis to examine foods consumed and
processing strategies. Teeth were examined for
cariogenesis, dental attrition and abscessing.
Reliance on maize provides a sticky
carbohydrate-rich dietary source favorable to
cariogenic microbial attack. Cariogenesis can,
in turn, provide the entry point for infectious
organisms to the rest of the body.
One of the important hypotheses the data from
the Lang Pasture burial population was proposed
to test is Burnett’s (1990, 1999) idea that the
Caddo of the Neches and Pine Forest region did
not depend on maize agriculture and that maize
carbohydrate consumption was low. She based
this assertion in part on the low frequency of
dental caries in her sample from the region
(Burnett 1990, 1999). Her hypothesis is
important because agriculture affects a human
population’s health not only by changes in diet
and nutrition, but also through changes in
workloads, settlement patterns, and overall
mobility. These changes in turn result in changes
in stress, disease and pathogen loads. The Lang
Pasture and Upper Neches Caddo populations do
not support Burnett’s (1990, 1999) hypothesis.

386

Throughout the Americas, increased reliance on
maize resulted in increased dental caries.
Although Lee (1999) has called into question a
direct genetic link between Fourche-Maline
populations and the Caddo, the populations who
preceded the Caddo and have been assumed to
have had a greater reliance on hunting and
gathering and had fewer dental caries (Rose et
al. 1984; Powell 1985; Burnett 1999) than later
Caddo populations. Rose et al. (1998) has
shown through data reanalysis and dental microwear studies that increased caries rates indicate
an increase in carbohydrate consumption that
may be the result of an increase in starchy seed
consumption at Fourche Maline and Early
Caddo sites. Rose et al. (1998) found regional
variability in the adoption of maize prior to the
Middle Caddo period as well as ecological
variability in maize consumption which, in
Texas, was summarized by Burnett’s (1990,
1999) summary data that found an increase in
caries rates from east to west across vegetation
zones.
It is important to remember average ages at
death in comparative samples when examining
dental disorders. Since the adult average ages at
death for the Lang Pasture and Upper Neches
River basin are higher than most comparable
population sets, dental disorders may be higher
than in comparable populations.
Dental attrition
Dental attrition is not necessarily a disorder but
the natural result of occlusal abrasion, the rate of
which is influenced by the amount of
unprocessed vegetal materials and grit in the
diet. Grit is introduced into the diet through
associations of dietary items, sand and the use of
stone grinding implements. The Caddo used
both stone and wooden grinding implements.
Dental wear can also result in the introduction of
infectious agents and result in abscessing and
eventual tooth loss.
Colby (1997), in a
comparison of Caddo and Texas coastal huntergatherers, found that wear more often leads to
dental abscessing than cariogenesis.
Dental wear was assessed using the Smith
(1984) technique for the anterior teeth and Scott

Technical Report No. 174202

Archeological Investigations at the Lang Pasture Site (41AN38) in the Upper Neches River Basin of East Texas
Texas Department of Transportation

(1979) technique for the posterior teeth. Table
10-16 presents the dental wear scores for all
individuals from the Lang Pasture site. Table 10­
17 provides average dental attrition scores
individuals and adults site means for the Upper
Neches Caddo population. Comparisons with
other populations can be difficult due to a use of
non-standardized techniques found in early
Caddo bioarchaeological studies. Table 10-18
summarizes available dental attrition scores
from other Caddo sites in Texas. In a recent
review of this data this author found that age
was not a factor in differences in wear patterns
among Caddo populations in Texas (Wilson
2008c).
Assuming that maize consumption is directly
correlated with decreased attrition because it is a
soft food item, and if Burnett’s (1990, 1999)
hypothesis holds, dental attrition should be
considerably less in populations from the
Blackland Prairie and the Pineywoods
populations should have should have the highest
dental attrition scores. Table 10-18 shows that
dental wear scores are highest in the Blackland
Prairie and this difference was found to be
statistically significant (Kruskal-Wallis one-way
ANOVA test). This suggests the diet of the
Caddo living on the Blackland Prairie was
coarser (i.e., contained more seeds and nuts)
than those living in the Post Oak Savannah and
Pineywoods. It is important to point out that the
Blackland Prairie Caddo sites predate the
Middle Caddo period.
Differences in dental attrition were also
significant through time (Kruskal-Wallis oneway ANOVA). Scores are high prior to the
Middle Caddo period (circa A.D. 1200), when
they drop. This corresponds to the time when
Rose et al. (1998) see a uniform adoption of
maize agriculture in Caddo populations outside
Texas. Unfortunately, nearly all of the earlier
populations from this summary are located in the
Blackland Prairie. Both Early Caddo sites from
the Pineywoods had low mean dental wear. This
suggests that biotic region was important in the
temporal trend of food items and processing
techniques used by the Caddo.

Technical Report No. 174202

Dental wear has been shown to decrease with an
increase in maize consumption among the
Caddo (Burnett 1990, Powell 1985). In this
study, using molar wear scores, wear increases
very slightly until the Historic period when there
is a significant (p = 0.05) decrease (Early Caddo
period mean = 17.5, Middle Caddo period mean
= 18.4, Late Caddo period mean = 19.4, Historic
Caddo period mean = 11.9). Molar wear
indicates that a shift in diet occurred where
coarser items were replaced by soft maize
between the Late Caddo and Historic periods.
Although anterior wear does not differ through
time significantly (Early Caddo mean = 4.0,
Middle Caddo mean = 3.5, Late Caddo mean =
3.9, Historic Caddo mean = 4.5), it is interesting
that anterior wear is greatest during the Historic
Caddo period when posterior wear is lowest.
Individual attrition scores for anterior and
posterior teeth were examined for differences
between females and males in the Upper Neches
River basin, including the Lang Pasture site. No
significant difference was found.
Males
averaged 4.8 on their anterior teeth compared to
4.4 for females, while molar wear averaged 17.8
for males and 17.6 for females. The lack of
difference between females and males was also
found in the Cooper Lake population (Wilson
and Steele 1997) and suggests that there was no
difference in the coarseness of diets between
males and females throughout the Caddo region
of Texas.
Although dental wear is expected to be age
progressive, it was not found to be progressive
in a linear fashion in this study. Dental wear has
been shown to be a relatively low predictor of
age for the Cooper Lake (Wilson and Steele
1997) and the Sanders and Mitchell (Wilson
1997) populations, but the correlation was even
worse in this study. When the Upper Neches
River basin site mean Smith (1984) and Scott
(1979) scores are compared to the average adult
age at death correlations were poor. A Pearson’s
R value of 0.24 for the Scott (1979) technique
while the Smith (1984) technique produced a
Pearson’s R value of 0.32. Correlations were
similarly poor for the entire Caddo region of
Texas as shown in Table 10-18. The Scott
(1979) technique yielded a Pearson’s R value of

387

Chapter 10: Analysis of Human Remains from the Lang Pasture Site

0.37 and the Smith (1984) technique yielded a
Pearson’s R value of 0.30. My study of the
Sanders and Mitchell populations suggests that
dental wear is stable until age 40 when there was
a rise in tooth wear followed by a lack of
patterning for those who survive to age 50
(Wilson 1997). This pattern suggests that once
enough enamel has been removed from the
occlusal surface dentin is exposed and since it is
softer than enamel, the exposure of dentin
undermines the surviving enamel leading to a
faster rate of wear.
Caries
Age is one of two basic components to consider
in examining caries frequency. Caries should
be age progressive, but this is not always the
case with archeologicalpopulations (Hillson
1979). This was not the case in the Upper
Neches River basin population including the
Lang Pasture site. In fact, caries are not age
progressive among the Caddo from East Texas
(Wilson 1997, 2008a, 2008b; Wilson and Steele
1997).
The second factor is diet. A sticky carbohydrate
rich diet high in sucrose should produce a
relatively high rate of caries. Bacterial
Lactobacillus acidophilus and Streptococcus
mutans in the mouth convert sucrose (in maize)
into an acid that destroys enamel and underlying
dentin. A range of 8 to 25 percent carious teeth
per individual has been used to identify maize
agricultural populations (Turner 1979; Cohen
and Armelagos 1984, Powell 1985). The Lang
Pasture population actually lies below this rate
with only 3.7 percent of the 28 teeth having
caries. Another Texas Caddo site that had a
comparably low frequency of teeth with caries is
Clark (5.6 percent [Loveland 1986]).
In the Caddo region, others have used the caries
rate to discriminate maize from non-maize
eating populations. Rose and Marks (1985) used
a caries of rate of 2.0 per individual to
differentiate between high and low carbohydrate
diets. More recently Rose et al. (1998) has used
caries rates to show variability in the adoption of
maize agriculture by the Caddo early in the
archeologicalsequence. In this study, the caries

388

rate for the Upper Neches River basin is 4.3
caries per individual, although there is
tremendous variability within the region (Table
10-19). The Lang Pasture site has the lowest
caries rate, at only 0.2.
In a recent study, I found that contrary to
Burnett’s (1990, 1999) hypothesis, the frequency
of caries in northeastern Texas Caddo sites
indicates that maize was a significant part of the
diet in all but the Blackland Prairie biotic region
(Wilson 2008c). Burnett (1990, 1999) gave a
caries rate of 2.5 for the Middle Caddo from her
summary data and very low rates of 0.5 for the
Pineywoods region in which the Lang Pasture
and Upper Neches River basin sites lie. In my
study, Blackland Prairie Caddo sites had a caries
rate of 1.8 compared to 5.4 in the Post Oak Belt
and 3.8 in the Pineywoods.
Rose et al. (1998) found variability in caries
rates among Caddo living outside Texas prior to
ca. A.D. 1100. Perttula (2008), according to
analyses of paleobotanical assemblages in East
Texas as well as a consideration of stable
isotope data, described maize as being less
important as a dietary staple until the latter part
of the Middle Caddo period, around A.D. 1300.
This study found no significant difference in the
caries rate through time, although only during
the Early and Middle Caddo periods were caries
rates below the high carbohydrate threshold.
Caries rates were also above the 2.0 rate during
the Early Caddo period at the George C. Davis
site in the Upper Neches River basin. All Late
Caddo period sites and the Historic Caddo
period Jim Allen site were above the 2.0 caries
rate indicator of a high carbohydrate diet.
In the Caddo paleobotanical assemblages in the
Cypress Creek, Neches, and Angelina River
basins, maize use peaked sometime during and
after the Late Caddo period (Perttula 2008:Table
2).
Dental data support Perttula’s (2008)
findings in the Neches River basin; although
variability between sites is present. In the Upper
Neches River Basin average caries rates for the
Early Caddo period are 7.0, 0.6 during the
Middle Caddo period, 6.0 for the Late Caddo
period and 4.5 at the Historic Caddo period Jim
Allen site.

Among most modern and archeological
populations females have higher caries rates
than males. This may be the result of metabolic
demands and/or hormones (Hillson 1986;
Walker 1986). Females have higher caries rates
than males in the Upper Neches River basin.
The 10 females have a caries rate of 7.0
compared to 5.8 for the 14 males with dental
remains. The difference is not statistically
significant in a Chi-square test.
Dental Abscess and Antemortem Loss
Dental abscess frequency is another indicator of
dental health. Colby (1997) hypothesized that
caries were causal in abscess formation, so it
was expected that the two would co-vary.
Among the Caddo they do not and a clear
pattern has yet to be established. In this study
both periapical and alveolar abscesses were
lumped into one category since both can be
caused by a number of factors including
exposure of the pulp chamber and disease
(Ortner and Putschar 1981). Dental abscesses
were not found in the Lang Pasture (Table 10­
20, which can be found in Appendix H) site
population but this may be a reflection of the
few alveolar margins and maxilla that were
preserved. In fact, only one observable alveolar
margins was present (Feature 93B1). The
frequency of dental abscess is low in the Upper
Neches River basin population as a whole with
23 percent of the observable adults affected. A
total of seven abscesses were found in four
adults. Colby (1997) found significantly more
abscesses in the Roitsch population than found
in a group of coastal hunter-gatherers. From her
findings she suggested that caries are more
likely causal than dental attrition in abscess
formation. At the Roitsch site, Colby (1997)
found 38 percent of the population examined
affected by dental abscesses. Burnett (1990,
1999) found abscesses rare throughout the
Caddo region of Texas. Wilson (1997) found 31
percent of the Sanders population, but only nine
percent of the Mitchell population, affected, but
more of the Mitchell population experienced
dental caries. Wilson and Steele (1997) found
60 percent of the Cooper Lake population had
abscesses. In this study caries did not correlate
with abscess frequency (R = 0.24).

Technical Report No. 174202

Antemortem loss of teeth is typically associated
with age, carious destruction, abscess and, most
directly, periodontal disease. It is assumed that
antemortem loss increases with age. In fact, a
Pearson’s value of 0.68 on individuals with one
or more teeth lost prior to death confirms that
there is an association between age and tooth
loss in the Upper Neches River basin population.
While 532 observations were made, 41 teeth had
been lost prior to death resulting in a loss of 7.7
percent. This is lower than the loss reported by
Wilson and Steele (1997) for the Cooper Lake
region and greater than the rate reported by
Burnett (1990, 1999) for the eastern portion of
the Gulf Coastal Plain.
As in the Cooper Lake population, antemortem
tooth loss was higher among males than females
in the Upper Neches River basin. There were
eleven adults affected by antemortem tooth loss,
two of whom were female, eight were male and
one was indeterminate. The two females had
three teeth lost prior to death while the males
had a higher rate of tooth loss with 36 teeth lost
prior to death. This may indicate a higher rate of
periodontal disease among males and/or is the
result of more males living to an older age than
females in the Upper Neches River basin.
Stable Isotope Analysis
Stable isotope analysis is used to examine the
trophic level of organisms and the amount of
plant matter in the diet from different
photosynthetic pathways: C3, C4 and CAM. In
the Caddo region of Northeast Texas, the
environment is characterized by plants that use
the C3 photosynthetic pathway. Maize can be
recognized in stable isotope signatures from the
region because it is a C4 plant. The collagen
enrichment factor is the difference between the
dietary and bone signature for carbon and is
approximately 5‰. C3 plants have a delta 13C
gelatin signature of -26.5‰ on average, while
bone from a C3 plant consumer would have a
delta 13C gelatin value of -21.5‰. C4 plants
have a higher delta13C gelatin signature of ­
12.5‰ on average.
Two components of bone are analyzed: collagen
and apatite. Collagen values yield the isotopic

389

Chapter 10: Analysis of Human Remains from the Lang Pasture Site

composition of the organic portion of bone while
apatite yields the isotopic composition of the
mineral portion of bone. The two are believed
to have different turnover rates, or rates of
replacement, meaning that they reflect different
amounts of time in an individual’s life (Ambrose
1993). They also reflect different aspects of diet
(Ambrose 1993). Carbon collagen has been
more commonly sampled than apatite. Ambrose
and Norr (1993) and Tieszen and Fagre (1993)
have proposed that delta 13C collagen values
vary in what they represent based on the amount
of protein in the diet of the consumer. For
example, in archeologicalpopulations of North
American maize agriculturalists, it has been
shown that the carbohydrate portion of the diet
is seen in delta 13C collagen values because the
amount of protein in the diet was relatively low.
Apatite is not biased by the amount or source of
protein and should be better able to show a small
increase in the amount of maize in a given diet.
The difference between collagen and apatite
isotopic values can be used to determine trophic
level. Ambrose (1993) suggested that where the
majority of carbohydrates are from a C4 source,
such as maize, and the protein is a C3 source in a
low protein diet, the difference between delta
13C values of bone collagen and apatite will be
large.
Nitrogen stable isotope signatures represent the
amount of nitrogen-fixing plants such as beans,
as well as the source and amount of dietary
protein (Schoeninger 1989). Nitrogen values are
ultimately a result of bacterial fixation or soil
nitrates which are passed up the food chain with
a 2-3‰ increase per trophic level. Humans in
terrestrial-based food webs typically have delta
15N values of 6-10‰ whereas consumers of fish
may have delta 15N values that range as high as
15-20‰ (Schoeninger and DeNiro 1983).
Unlike carbon isotopes, nitrogen stable isotopes
also reflect temperature and humidity in the
natural environment.
Human bone samples were prepared and
processed by Geochron Laboratories.
All
individuals from the Lang Pasture site were
analyzed and 25 individuals from the Upper
Neches River basin population housed at TARL
were analyzed. In addition, all individuals from

390

Lang Pasture and five of the individuals from
the Upper Neches River Basin population that
were sampled for and submitted to Geochron
Laboratories were also sent to Beta Analytic,
Inc. for radiocarbon dating. These samples
produced slightly different results as shown in
Table 10-21, suggesting that different processing
techniques were used by the different
laboratories.
Given the variable caries rates from the Early
and Middle Caddo periods in the Upper Neches
River basin, it is likely that maize was not
uniformly adopted by the Caddo until after the
Middle Caddo period in the Neches River Basin.
This is consistent with the pattern established by
Rose et al. (1998) for other Caddo regions.
Paleobotanical evidence shows that maize was
present throughout East Texas by the Early
Caddo period, but that is was not as important as
starchy seeds until later in the archeological
sequence (Perttula 2008). If caries rates indicate
an increase in carbohydrates but can not
distinguish
between
maize
and
other
carbohydrate sources, then stable isotope
analysis provides the only means of determining
when and where maize became an important
component of the Caddo diet.
In fact, delta 13C collagen values show an
increase through time and a Kruskal-Wallis oneway ANOVA test shows the relationship
between delta 13C collagen values and time to
be statistically significant. There are two large
increases in mean values (Table 10-22). The
first is between the Formative Caddo period and
the Early Caddo period and the second is
between the Middle Caddo and Late Caddo
periods. These changes suggest that maize was
introduced to the Caddo by the Early Caddo
period and that an increase in maize and protein
consumption took place by the Late Caddo
period. While these results are in keeping with
the paleobotanical data, more testing is needed
since only one individual from the Upper
Neches dates to the Formative Caddo period
(George C. Davis site, Feature 155).
Delta 13C apatite values show an increase
through time from the Early Caddo to Historic
Caddo periods. The relationship between delta

Technical Report No. 174202

Archeological Investigations at the Lang Pasture Site (41AN38) in the Upper Neches River Basin of East Texas
Texas Department of Transportation

13C apatite and time was statistically significant.
Since apatite values indicate the whole diet, it is
interesting to note the difference in incremental
increase in values between apatite and collagen.
Delta 13C apatite values show a large increase
between the Early and Middle Caddo periods
followed by a steady increase through time.
This is interpreted as maize intensification
occurring during the Middle Caddo period
followed by a further increase in maize
consumption during the Late Caddo period.
The difference between collagen and apatite
delta 13C values is believed to represent the
amount of protein while delta 15N values reflect
the protein source. Changes in the difference
between delta 13C collagen and apatite values
through time and delta 15N were not statistically
significant. In both values there is a lot of
individual variability within the time periods.
Mean values indicate that protein consumption
was greatest during the Late Caddo period and
least during the Formative Caddo period.
Protein consumption increased during the Early
Caddo period followed by decrease in the
Middle Caddo period. Nitrogen isotope values
means do not show much difference through
time and are consistent with terrestrial based
food webs. Nitrogen values are lowest during
the Historic Caddo period suggesting the
presence of more legumes in the diet.
Despite the difference in antemortem tooth loss
and caries rates between the sexes, there were no
significant differences in stable isotope results
between females and males, showing that the
Caddo diet in the Upper Neches River basin did
not differ by sex.
The Lang Pasture site testing has added
significantly to our understanding of the Caddo
diet during a transitional time. Stable isotope
studies in the Upper Neches River basin have
confirmed that maize was a significant part of
the Caddo diet in contrast to Burnett’s (1990,
1999) previous bioarcheologicalfindings for the
region. Burnett (1990, 1999) based her findings
on dental data and rates of porotic hyperostosis.
Her dental data was limited to the Early Caddo
period which stable isotope analysis has shown
had maize presence but lacked intensification.

Technical Report No. 174202

Caries rates do not adequately discriminate
amounts of maize consumption in the Upper
Neches. For example, the caries rate for the
Formative and Early Caddo George C. Davis
site is high at 7.0, but delta 13C collagen and
apatite values show that some maize was
consumed, but not in the levels seen in the later
periods. While delta 13C collagen results for the
Upper Neches are similar to those presented by
Rose et al. (1998), higher values in both this
study and a larger study (Wilson 2008c) during
the Early Caddo period suggest that more maize
was consumed earlier in Texas than in Caddo
regions of Arkansas, Louisiana and Oklahoma.
Apatite values show that maize intensification in
the Upper Neches River basin occurred during
the Middle Caddo period. Unfortunately little
stable isotope testing has been performed
outside of Texas in the Caddo region from this
time period.
Paleopathology
The second part of the goals established for this
study was to determine how common infectious
diseases were, how heavy work loads were and
whether there were episodes of chronic stress
from the lifestyles lead by Caddo in the Upper
Neches basin. Specifically this study sought to
add to the limited body of information on
skeletal health among the Caddo. Rose et al.’s
(1998) hypothesis that in regions with a good
resource base, agriculture will be adopted later
and adaptive health will be better can be tested
with the data from the Upper Neches River
Basin population. Rose et al. (1989) state that
Caddo populations living in the Pineywoods
region had the greatest adaptive efficiency
compared to populations living further west.
This is based in large part on Burnett’s (1990,
1999) study of the region, in which she found
that the Neches River Caddo had little infectious
disease compared to other Caddo populations.
Although Burnett’s (1990, 1999) sample from
the region was small, consisting of nine Caddo
individuals whom provided data on infection,
she found one individual from the George C.
Davis site with evidence of infection. Burnett
(1990, 1999) had no data on childhood stress for
the region.

Chapter 10: Analysis of Human Remains from the Lang Pasture Site

Enamel Hypoplasia

Infection

Evidence of childhood stress in the form on
enamel hypoplasia in the Lang Pasture
population suggests that the population was
better adapted to their cultural and natural
environment than other Caddo populations.
Enamel hypoplasia records a disruption in the
formation of enamel on teeth. It may be the best
record of fetal, infant and early childhood stress
recorded in the human skeleton.
Various
stressful events can produce enamel defects
during the time in which the enamel is being
formed, including infectious disease and
malnutrition in the mother or child. Genetic
factors and trauma may also influence enamel
development. The six individuals from Lang
Pasture with dental remains had no hypoplasia.
Hypoplasias have not been well studied among
the Caddo so there is little comparative
information. A total of 50 individuals with 575
teeth were examined for enamel hypoplasia from
the Upper Neches River basin (Table 10-23).
The rate of 12 percent for the Upper Neches
River basin as a whole is much lower than seen
in the Red River basin (60.2 percent) (Burnett
1990, 1999). The Pine Tree Mound population
had a higher incidence with 22.2 percent
affected, and Wilson and Steele (1997) found in
the Cooper Lake region a higher incidence still
(36 percent).

Like enamel hypoplasia, infectious disease may
also be influenced by genetic factors, nutritional
status, population density of agent and host,
behavior and environment. Most infectious
agents that affect the skeleton are chronic and
debilitating because a certain amount of time is
required in the life of the individual for the agent
to affect bone. Bone responds to an infection in
a limited number of ways causing further
challenges
to
specific
diagnoses
for
paleopathologists. Often only through observing
the pattern of bone response throughout a
skeleton, can a specific diagnosis be made; thus,
preservation has a strong influence over the
assessment of infectious disease rates.

There is a difference in the frequency of
individuals affected by enamel hypoplasia
through time in the Upper Neches River basin,
but larger samples are needed to investigate this
pattern further. Hypoplasias are nearly absent
until the Historic period. There is one individual
from the Early Caddo period George C. Davis
site and one from the Late Caddo E. W.
Hackney site with hypoplasias. In contrast, four
of the nine Historic Caddo period individuals
from the Jim Allen site had enamel hypoplasias.
During this period there is also evidence of
childhood iron deficient anemia in AH-9 from
the Jim Allen site. This is the only incidence of
cribra orbitalia in the entire Upper Neches
population. Taken together, the incidence of
enamel hypoplasia and cribra orbitalia suggest a
high incidence of childhood stress during the
Historic Caddo period.

392

Burnett’s (1990, 1999) data from the region is
admittedly limited. While Burnett (1990, 1999)
stated that infection rates in the Neches were
low, she also hypothesized that infection rates
were related to the amount of occupational
debris. Wilson (1998) in a study of treponemal
infections throughout archeologicalpopulations
in Texas, found that population density more
than site longevity affected the rate of infectious
disease. Based on these hypotheses, the Lang
Pasture population would be expected to have a
low rate of infection. Unfortunately, the poor
preservation of the skeletal remains recovered
from the Lang Pasture site makes statements
about rates of infection tenuous because the poor
preservation results in underreporting of
frequencies calculated on a per individual basis.
Only one individual from the Lang Pasture site
had evidence of infection. Thus, the rate of
infection at the Lang Pasture site is 11.1 percent,
with no subadult infection and 16.7 percent of
the adult population having evidence of
infection. In the entire Upper Neches River
basin there were only 8 instances of infectious
bone, excluding likely scalp infections. (The
infection rate rises to 13.9 percent if the two
instances of probable scalp infection are
included). As previously stated, preservational
bias has likely resulted in an underestimate of
the actual rate of infection.
While the sample size is slightly larger here
(MNI = 72), for the greater Pineywoods region,

Technical Report No. 174202

Archeological Investigations at the Lang Pasture Site (41AN38) in the Upper Neches River Basin of East Texas
Texas Department of Transportation

Rose et al. (1998) gave a rate of infection of 18
percent of 57 individuals, a rate higher than that
found here. They found the Pineywoods region
to have the lowest infection rate for Caddo
populations living in the three vegetation zones
in Texas. This study confirms their findings. In
much of the Upper Neches River basin,
population density based on the number of
burials per site is relatively low. This matches an
expectation of low infection rates with lower
population density. Lee (1997) examined two
Late Caddo large mound center site populations
on the Red River, Hatchel and Mitchell. She
found that 31.2 percent of the individuals from
Hatchel and 51.6 percent from Mitchell had
evidence of infection. In contrast, the Pine Tree
Mound population was found to have a low rate
of infection at 6.7 percent of the population
(Wilson 2008a); however, Wilson (2008a)
cautioned that poor preservation may have
biased these results. Infection rates at nonmound sites along the Red River in northwestern
Louisiana are higher than at Pine Tree Mound,
but lower than mound sites on the Red River. At
habitation sites such as McLelland (Tiné and
Tieszan 1997) the infection rate was 25.0
percent and at Cedar Grove (Rose 1984) the
infection rate was 22.2 percent; these sites are
two Late Caddo farmsteads in the Red River
valley, downstream from the Great Bend. This
supports Wilson’s (1998) findings that
settlement density is directly related to infection
rates, but also indicates that geographic location
and preservation all play a role in infection rates.
What differs from Rose et al.’s (1998) review of
Red River and East Texas Caddo is the temporal
trends in infection rates. Rose et al. (1998)
found that infection rates peak in the Early
Caddo and Historic Caddo periods (25.0 percent
each). In this study, infection rates
approximately double with each successive time
period until the Historic Caddo period when
there is only one individual with evidence of
infection. During the Early Caddo period 5.9
percent of the 17 individuals were affected;
during the Middle Caddo period the rate climbs
to 11.4 percent (of 10); in the Late Caddo period
19.2 percent of the 26 individuals had evidence
of infection; and 6.7 percent of the 15 from the
Historic Caddo period. With the exception of

Technical Report No. 174202

the Historic Caddo period rates, the infection
rate parallels increases in maize consumption
and likely changes in settlement patterns. The
lower rate of infection during the Historic Caddo
period warrants further investigation, but may be
an indication that individuals died prior to bone
involvement from infections, given the
approximately 10-year decrease in average age
at death.
Of the infections, one was from an Early Caddo
period burial, one was from the Middle Caddo
period, two were from the Late Caddo period,
and one was from the Historic Caddo period.
Two are possible cases of osteomyelitis, one
from the Late Caddo J. W. Blackburn site (burial
AI-1), the other is from F. 93, Burial 2 from the
Lang Pasture site. The individual from George
C. Davis has non-specific periostitis on the right
tibia. The individual from Reagor Farm (burial
AJ-1) exhibited endosteal bone formation that
was active at the time of death based on the lack
of remodeling.
Endosteal bone formation
indicates a systemic rather than localized
infection. There were four “suprainion”
depressions. This is recorded as focal bone loss
on the occipital above the superior nuchal line
that can be described as a shallow depression.
Suprinion depressions were recorded on Burial 1
from the O.L. Ellis site, in the two individuals
from Fred McKee, and in burial AH-1 from the
Jim Allen site. The child from the Fred McKee
site is the only child in the Upper Neches River
basin population to exhibit signs of infection.
The adult from the Fred McKee site and the
individual from the Jim Allen site have an
unusual pattern of focal bone loss in that it does
not show on the occipital but is grouped with the
two suprainion depressions because the etiology
is the same. These are observed as one and two
lesions, one on each parietal just superior and
lateral to the lambda. They are suggestive of
chronic irritation, presumptively from wearing
something on the head in that location. I have
seen numerous suprinion depressions among the
Caddo and they have been noted in other Caddo
populations (Derrick et al. 2008; Derrick and
Wilson 1997). They are the result of a localized
infection whose source is unknown and may be
related to the practice of cranial modeling that
produced a localized sore.

393

Chapter 10: Analysis of Human Remains from the Lang Pasture Site

Porotic hyperostosis has been used as an
indicator of nutritional stress in the form of irondeficient anemia (El Najjar et al. 1976) and as an
indicator of parasite load (Kent 1986). Porotic
hyperostosis is found rarely in scurvy, which has
not been documented for the Caddo.
Observations of porotic hyperostosis are
complicated by diagnosis. When diploë are not
expanded, porosity may be the result of healed
porotic hyperostosis or periosteal reaction to a
insect infestation of the scalp, or fungal or
bacterial infection of the scalp. It is also
possible that a combination of anemia, scalp
inflamation and/or scalp infection may have
occurred in a given population or individual.
Lee (1997) is the only researcher to adequately
describe this phenomenon for a given Caddo
population. Lee (1997) found 89 percent of the
Hatchel population and 56 percent of the
Mitchell population had porotic hyperostosis
and/or cranial porosity. Porotic hyperostosis
and/or cranial porosity was absent in the Lang
Pasture population. Burnett (1990, 1999) found
porotic hyperostosis to be most common in the
Blackland Prairie and did not find it in the
Pineywoods. Porotic hyperostosis occurred in a
high incidence among the Cooper Lake
population (18.5 percent) (Wilson and Steele
1997). Three cases (4.3 percent) of porotic
hyperostosis were found in two sites from the
Upper Neches River basin. This low rate is very
different than Lee’s (1997) findings and is more
consistent with the Rose et al. (1998) findings
for the Red River and East Texas. Rose et al.
(1998) found that porotic hyperostosis peaked in
the Middle Caddo period, but otherwise was
fairly consistent at around 8 percent. That was
not the case for the Upper Neches where the two
sites affected were from the Late Caddo and
Historic Caddo periods. The one individual
from the Late Caddo period with porotic
hyperostosis resulted in a frequency of 3.8
percent, while the frequency for the Historic
Caddo period was 13.3 percent.
It is likely that the child from the Fred McKee
site with porotic hyperostosis had a scalp
infection since the child also has an active
infection at the suprainion (depression) and the
hypervascularity was found on the superior
portion of the occipital and both parietals near

394

the lambda. The two individuals from Jim Allen
are more ambiguous. In burial AH-1 the pitting
occurs near the (suprainion) depressions on the
left parietal. Pitting was concentrated on the
occipital just below the lambda adjacent to the
three depressions and is therefore believed to be
associated with the suprainion depression. In
burial AH-7 the well-healed porosity is also
located near the lambda but found on the right
parietal. There was no evidence of a suprainion
depression on this individual. There was,
however, an older child from the Jim Allen site
with cribra orbitalia, which is caused by iron
deficient anemia. The Jim Allen site, therefore,
exhibits both infections affecting cranial bones
and iron-deficient anemia.
Trauma and Biomechanical Stress
In most Caddo populations trauma is rare,
although Wilson and Steele (1997) reported a
very high incidence of trauma in the Cooper
Lake population with 9.2 percent of the
individuals being affected. The Upper Neches
population has a frequency of traumatic injury of
2.9 percent. One individual (Feature 8 burial)
from the Lang Pasture site suffered a fractured
right tibia.
The fracture occurred on the
distolateral portion of the diaphysis. It was
impossible to determine the extent of the
fracture because the medial portion of the
diaphysis was missing. The fracture site was
extremely well healed indicating that the
fracture was set and successfully immobilized.
In my experience, the Caddo were adept at
setting broken bones. There was one other
fracture in the Upper Neches population and one
individual with large enthesiopathies. The other
fracture was found in the left femur of burial
AL1-AL11 from the E. W. Henry Farm site.
The break occurred on the lateral aspect at
approximately midshaft and was a partial or
green stick fracture. Like the individual from
Lang Pasture, this individual was completely
healed other than the remains of a small bone
callous.
Biomechanical stress is seen in the Upper
Neches population. One case is suggested by
the presence of enthesiopathies on the right
femur along the linea aspera and left tibia along

Technical Report No. 174202

Archeological Investigations at the Lang Pasture Site (41AN38) in the Upper Neches River Basin of East Texas
Texas Department of Transportation

the soleal line of Feature 163 from the George
C. Davis site. Enthesiopahties can result from
repeated use or injury from muscle and tendon
pulls. In this case, Feature 163 is unusually
robust at the muscle attachment sites present.
The linea aspera on left femur is enlarged but the
surface is too eroded to determine if the injury is
bilateral. Likewise, on the right humerus the
deltoid attachment site is very pronounced with
a sharp edged linear depression suggestive of a
muscle tear. Taken together, it appears that
Feature 163 led an unusually strenuous life.
Degenerative joint disease is a more common
indicator of biomechanical stress in a
population.
Degenerative joint disease, or
arthritis, here refers to degenerative changes in
the synovial joints (arthritis) and vertebral
column (osteophytosis).
Degenerative joint
disease is typically the result of repeated stresses
from repeated motions through time, but can
also result from a single episode injury. As the
fluid filled joint capsule breaks down, bone
responds by expansion of the surface area with
marginal lipping, erosion of the joint surface and
finally polishing, eburnation, from direct boneto-bone contact.
Observations of degenerative joint disease are
dependent on the preservation of joint surfaces.
Due to the cancellous bone that underlies joint
surfaces, they are less often preserved than
cortical bone diaphyses. None of the individuals
from the Lang Pasture site had intact articular
surfaces so it was not possible to determine the
presence of degenerative joint disease. In the
entire Upper Neches River basin population
there were only two individuals with
degenerative joint disease (7.7 percent). Joint
observations were only possible on 26 of the 55
adults. The frequency of degenerative joint
disease (arthritis and osteophytosis) in the Upper
Neches River basin is much lower than Rose et
al. (1998) report for the Red River and East
Texas Caddo, excepting during the Middle
Caddo period. In their data summary, Rose et
al. (1998) find a dramatic peak in arthritis during
the Historic Caddo period.
The affected
individuals in the Upper Neches are from the
Late Caddo and Historic Caddo periods, but they
are also likely among the older adults in the

Technical Report No. 174202

population who have had longer time over which
to accumulate joint stress.
Burial AH-3, an older adult from the Jim Allen
site, exhibited both arthritis and osteophytosis.
There is osteophytosis and surface porosity of
the centrum, superior, and inferior articular
facets of preserved cervical vertebrae. Loveland
(1994) and Wilson (1994) reported this to be a
common location for arthritis among Red River
Caddo, where degenerative joint disease is
relatively common. The other case of vertebral
osteophytosis is in the lumbar vertebrae of a
male from the E. W. Henry site (burial AL-3).
The individual from the Jim Allen site also had
surface porosity at the anterior aspect on the
right and left glenoid fossa of the
temporomandibular articulation. Degenerative
joint disease at the temporomandibular joint was
seen in high frequency in the Sam KaufmanRoitsch population with a considerably higher
frequency among males (Derrick et al. 2008).
While Wilson (1994) found a low incidence of
temporomandibular arthritis in the Middle
Caddo Sanders site population, she found that
male stress loads as evidenced by degenerative
joint disease were nearly twice that of females.
Derrick et al. (2008) believe that the pattern in
the Late Caddo Roitsch-Sam Kaufman
population is the result of using the anterior
dentition as a tool and that this tool use is part of
the sexual division of labor among the Caddo.
One individual, Feature 88, from the Lang
Pasture site, has an unusual severity of wear on
the canine and premolars that is suggestive of
use of the teeth for something other than
chewing. The left maxillary canine and first
premolar exhibit shearing of the lingual cusp and
the right mandibular first premolar exhibits
shearing of the buccal cusp. Molar wear is
comparatively light.
Unfortunately the
temporomandibular joint in this individual was
very fragmentary.
Further testing of the
hypothesis that some Caddo used their teeth as
tools is needed.
Second to dental caries, degenerative joint
disease is typically the most common
pathological condition seen in Caddo skeletons
(Derrick et al. 2008). In the Upper Neches
population, fractures were observed on more

395

Chapter 10: Analysis of Human Remains from the Lang Pasture Site

individuals. The low rate of degenerative joint
disease is undoubtedly influenced by the poor
preservation of joint surfaces in the Upper
Neches population. Nearly all joint surfaces
present had a preservation score of 3 (Buikstra
and Ubelaker 1994), indicating that less than
one-third of the surface is present. A more
detailed study of degenerative joint disease in
the Caddo is clearly necessary to address issues
of workload. Yet, a lower rate of degenerative
joint disease was reported by Burnett (1990,
1999) for the Pineywoods (2.1 percent) than
seen here. Wilson and Steele (1997) reported a
rate of 38.9 percent in the Cooper Lake
population. Where preservation is better, rates
of degenerative joint disease are higher. For
example, Loveland (1994) found osteophytosis
in 57.7 percent of the males and 46.4 percent of
the females from the Sam Kaufman-Bob
Williams site sample she analyzed. Likewise,
Wilson (1994) found that 78 percent of the
Sanders population had some form of
degenerative joint disease. At other sites along
the Red River with good preservation, Lee
(1997) found arthritis in 67 percent of the
population from the Hatchel site and 65 percent
from the Mitchell site. Derrick et al. (2008)
found osteoarthritis in the weight-bearing joints
of 43 percent of the adults from the Roitsch site.
Another site with a high frequency of arthritis is
the McLelland site, where 75 percent of the
population were affected (Tiné and Tieszan
1997).
The question remains whether the
differences represent a difference in preservation
or a difference in geographic region and/or time.
Other Conditions
Three additional pathological conditions were
observed. One was the fusion of the second and
third cervical vertebrae in a young adult female
from the George C. Davis site. No marginal
lipping was observed in conjunction with this
condition, so it is not scored as degenerative
joint disease. Juvenile rheumatoid arthritis can
manifest itself in such a way and does affect
more females than males. The neural arch and
the portion of the centrum that was present were
fused. None of the other skeletal remains of this
individual were affected. A button osteoma is
present on the frontal of a male from the E. W.

396

Henry site (burial AL-3). This is a common
benign lesion. The final condition appears to be
a congenital defect as there is no indication of
bone growth or remodeling surrounding the
lesion. In Burial 97 from Lee Ellis Farm, a
significant narrowing of the left auditory canal
was present which left a kidney-shaped canal. It
is not known if this would have affected the
individual’s hearing.
The question thus remains, were levels of
infection and other indicators of physiological
stress lower in populations south of the Red
River? It is clear that preservation of human
skeletal remains in the region is poor and surface
observations are inhibited (Wilson 2008c).
Nevertheless, it does appear from the data
presented here that childhood stress was
significant in the Historic Caddo period. At this
time maize intake was at its highest, but is only
slightly higher than during the Late Caddo
period, so it is likely that childhood health was
affected by additional factors. It is intriguing
that the highest incidence of porotic hyperostosis
occurs during the Historic Caddo period, but, as
stated earlier, the meaning of this is somewhat
ambiguous. Clearly traumatic injury remained
consistent through time. Infection rates exhibit a
very different pattern than described for the
Caddo from the Red River and East Texas (Rose
et al. 1998), with the Upper Neches River basin
population showing a steady increase up to the
Historic Caddo period when there is a dramatic
decrease. It is possible that epidemic diseases
were causing death prior to local endemic
infections. The Upper Neches River basin
skeletal series cannot adequately address the
issue of work loads due to its poor preservation,
but it does beg for a more specific examination.
10.8

CULTURAL MODIFICATION

Cultural modification of the body is an effective
form of group identification in human societies
and can be useful to archaeologists in
reconstructing ethnic and group identity. Cranial
modeling is one of the most common forms of
body adornment that preserves in hard tissue and
is available to archaeologists to study cultural
norms of beautification. Cranial modeling was
practiced by the Caddo and documented both

Technical Report No. 174202

Archeological Investigations at the Lang Pasture Site (41AN38) in the Upper Neches River Basin of East Texas
Texas Department of Transportation

archaeologically (Derrick and Wilson 1997) and
ethnohistorically (Swanton 1942). Since cranial
modeling occurs early in life when an infant’s
cranial bones are relatively ductile, cranial
modeling reflects the group identification to
which the parents or another authority figure
wish their child to be perceived as belonging.
Table 10-24 documents the frequency and types
of cranial modeling in the Upper Neches River
population. Only two of the four cranial
modeling styles practiced by the Caddo
occurred, and some burials lacked modeling
(e.g., Derrick and Wilson 1997). Both annular
and tabular styles were observed, indicating that
both hard and soft devices were used to produce
the desired result. Annular modeling involves
the tight circular wrapping of the infant head
with soft materials like animal skin or cloth, or
the application of removable pads or cords
(Rogers 1975).
It results in a distinctive
conically-shaped head that often had a coronal
saddle occurring posterior to the bregma.
Tabular forms of modeling are produced by
immobilizing the infant head between boards
and is differentiated from unintentional
flattening of the back of the head cause by a
cradleboard. Tabular styles among the Caddo
result in a flattened frontal and occipital with
expansion of the parietals (Derrick and Wilson
1997).
As in Derrick and Wilson’s (1997) study of
cranial modeling in the East Texas Caddo, the
most common type of modeling among the
Upper Neches River Caddo is tabular fronto­
vertico-occipital. Cranial modeling was less
common in the Upper Neches River basin than
for East Texas Caddo populations as a whole,
where 90 percent of the crania were found to be
modeled. There were 16 individuals in the
Upper Neches for whom observations could be
made, 10 of whom had modeled crania (62.5
percent). One individual had cranial modeling
but the style could not be determined. Tabular
fronto-vertico-occipital is present in seven crania
(46.7 percent).
Annular parallelo-fronto­
occipital modeling was observed in two
individuals: a male from the Historic period Jim
Allen site (Burial AH-3) and a female from the

Technical Report No. 174202

Lang Pasture site who dates to the early part of
the Late Caddo period (F. 93, Burial 2).
There was no difference between males and
females in the Upper Neches Caddo in the
presence and style of cranial modeling. Because
the numbers are small, it is difficult to discern a
relationship between cranial modeling and time,
although it appears that cranial modeling entered
the Caddo region during the Middle Caddo
period (Derrick and Wilson 1997). The earliest
evidence of cranial modeling in this study is
seen in the two individuals from the Lang
Pasture site. It is possible that cranial modeling
as a practice spread to the Caddo of the Neches
River basin somewhat later than in other regions
such as the Red River, where cranial modeling
was slightly more common than for the region as
a whole. It is interesting that cranial modeling is
present in the Lang Pasture population at a time
when maize intensification has not yet taken
place.
In comparing cranial modeling in the Upper
Neches River basin with the Red River basin, it
is interesting to note that the variety of cranial
modeling may correlate with a more
heterogenous genetic population than was seen
in the Upper Neches (Lee 1999). Unfortunately,
the sample size is too small here to test Derrick
and Wilson’s (1997) finding that mound centers
had greater variety in the styles of cranial
modeling than other site types. The two mound
sites in the studied sample were represented by
an individual without cranial modeling and an
individual with tabular fronto-vertico-occipital
modeling. The results from the Pine Tree Mound
site in the Sabine River basin support Derrick
and Wilson’s (1997) finding. Lee’s (1997)
research also suggested that mound sites had
higher population admixture.
10.9

SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS

The remains of nine individuals were recovered
from the Lang Pasture site. In order to address
bioarchaeological issues, the Lang Pasture
population was analyzed alongside a minimum
of 63 Caddo from the Upper Neches River basin
housed at the Texas Archeological Research
Laboratory (TARL). This analysis is the largest

397

Chapter 10: Analysis of Human Remains from the Lang Pasture Site

of its kind in a region in which there has been
relatively little bioarchaeological study.
It
provides a needed context for understanding
how the Lang Pasture population fits into its
temporal and regional circumstance in terms of
preservation, adaptive efficiency and health,
ethnicity and genetic relationships, and diet.
Within the Upper Neches River basin population
individual skeletal remains came from the
Formative through Historic Caddo periods.
Single and multiple interments are represented
as are mound burials and non-mound burials.
Burials ranged in offerings and presumably
status.
The state of preservation was generally poor for
the Lang Pasture remains, as was the case for
many sites in the Upper Neches River basin.
One individual from Lang Pasture, Feature 91,
was represented only by enamel fragment from
an unidentifiable tooth. The Lang Pasture site
has a mean of only 7 percent of the skeleton
complete with the best represented individual
being only 17 percent represented (Feature 92).
The skeletal preservation at the Lang Pasture site
is not unlike other southern Caddo sites. The
Upper Neches population had a mean
representation of 13 percent. Elements were
also given a preservation score from 1 to 3. The
individuals from the Lang Pasture site had an
average preservation score of 2.7, again
indicating poor preservation. The Upper Neches
River basin preservation mean is better than
observed in the Lang Pasture population, but not
by much, at 2.2. Poor bone preservation in the
region can be attributed to acidic soils leaching
organics from the bone during periods of
repeated wetting and slow drying. Because of
the poor state of preservation, many metric, nonmetric, and pathological observations could not
adequately be made.
The poor preservation made it difficult to
address issues of body size and sexual
dimorphism. Since stature estimates were not
possible, tibial circumferences were used to
examine sexual dimorphism in terms of
robusticity rather than stature. While robusticity
and stature are under genetic influence, they are
also controlled by the quantity and quality of
diet and the health of individuals. Robusticity

398

scores are also influenced by activity patterns,
that is, the degree of muscle use at a given
location. Measurements taken here suggest that
the Caddo from the Neches River basin fall at
the high end of the normal range for humans.
The Cooper Lake population had a similar
degree of sexual dimorphism in robusticity
(Wilson and Steele 1997). This is interpreted as
meaning there was a difference in weight
bearing and the way the muscles that attach to
the tibia were used by males and females, with
males bearing the brunt of activities that shaped
the lower limb. In a study of the Middle Caddo
Sanders site population from the Red River, I
found that degenerative joint disease showed
higher work loads for males among the Caddo
(Wilson 1994). Taken together, there is a
suggestion that there was a distinct sexual
division of labor among the Caddo and that
males experienced greater stress loads than
women, but further research on this topic is
needed.
The issue of genetic relationships of the Lang
Pasture population to nearby populations could
not adequately be addressed due to poor
preservation. Enlarging the population to the
Upper Neches for comparison with Caddo from
other regions was possible using non-metric
traits. Observations recorded for this study do
not differ from Lee’s (1999) prior study. Lee
(1999) found that populations from the region
were relatively homogenous compared to
populations from the Red River.
This study disproves Burnett’s (1990, 1999)
hypothesis that populations south of the Red
River and those of the Pineywoods were not
reliant on maize agriculture. Burnett (1990,
1999) and Rose et al. (1998) hypothesized that
rainfall via vegetation regions influenced the
adoption of maize. They hypothesized that
maize consumption decreased from the
Blackland Prairie to the Pineywoods. This study
further adds to a growing body of data that
demonstrate higher frequencies of caries in the
Pineywoods and Post Oak Savannah than in the
Blackland Prairie (Wilson 2008c).

George C. Davis. Both stable isotope and caries
rates indicate that maize was a significant part of
the Caddo diet at all sites examined by the Late
Caddo period.
Rose et al. (1998) found variable caries rates
prior to A.D. 1100. This study found caries
rates both above and below the threshold of 2.0
prior to the Late Caddo period. For example, the
Lang Pasture population has an extremely low
caries rate of 0.3 for adults, but the Early Caddo
George C. Davis site had a caries rate of 7.0.
Stable isotope analysis shows that the delta 13c
apatite and collagen values at the two sites are
very similar and show that the consumption of
carbohydrates other than maize are causing
elevated caries rates at some Caddo sites.
Perttula (2008), according to analyses of
paleobotanical assemblages in East Texas as
well as a consideration of stable isotope data,
described maize as being less important until the
latter part of the Middle Caddo period, around
A.D. 1300. This study corroborates his findings
as caries rates are consistently greater than 2.0
after the Middle Caddo period. Taken together,
dental and stable isotopic data show that maize
was an important dietary resource that became a
staple for some populations during the Middle
Caddo period (Forrest Mound) and during the
Late Caddo period for others in the Upper
Neches River Basin. From the Late to the
Historic Caddo period there was a further
dependence on maize.
Stable isotope testing from this study has
contributed significantly to our understanding of
Caddo diets. Since this study has shown that
starchy seeds can elevate caries rates, stable
isotope studies are the only direct measure of
maize consumption. Delta 13C collagen and
apatite values show an increase in maize
consumption through time from the Early Caddo
to Historic periods. Delta 13C collagen values
document two significant increases: the first is
between the Woodland period and the Early
Caddo period and documents the introduction of
maize to the Caddo diet in the Upper Neches;
the second is between the Middle Caddo period
and the Late Caddo period, when caries rates are
uniformly above the high carbohydrate
threshold. Delta 13C apatite is regarded as a

Technical Report No. 174202

better indicator of the diet as a whole and is
better at showing small increases in maize
consumption. It is interesting that apatite values
show a significant change between the Early and
Middle
Caddo
periods
that
signifies
intensification of maize agriculture.
More
testing is required to better refine when maize
agricultural intensification occurred within the
Middle and Late Caddo periods.
Wear scores from the Upper Neches are
relatively stable until the Historic Caddo period.
This is the period of highest maize consumption
and presumably the softest diet.
Increased sedentism goes hand-in-hand with
intensification of maize agriculture. While
increased sedentism leads to increased waste at a
site, settlement density may be more important
in infectious disease rates (Wilson 1998).
Agricultural intensification allows for increased
settlement density, but does not require it. An
increase in the proportion of maize in the diet at
the expense of higher quality nutritional items
would, like external stress, lower resistance to
infection and slow the body’s ability to heal
from injury. Maize agriculture in the region has
been shown to parallel developments outside the
Neches River basin with its introduction during
the Early Caddo period followed by mixed
adoption of the crop until intensification
occurred between the Middle and Late Caddo
periods. There is a further intensification of
maize in the Historic Caddo period that is seen
across the Texas Caddo region (Wilson 2008c).
In the Upper Neches River basin there is
evidence of poor health at this time that was
likely associated with cultural stress, increased
population density (assumed from number of
burials), and malnutrition.
Paleopathological study of the Lang Pasture site
and other Upper Neches Caddo human remains
was influenced by poor preservation. This raises
the question of preservation in the region as a
factor in shaping Burnett’s (1990, 1999)
hypothesis. Site type and settlement density also
cannot be ignored. Settlement density as
indicated by burial population size is less in the
Upper Neches than in other places in the Caddo
region. The mean number of burials per site in

399

Chapter 10: Analysis of Human Remains from the Lang Pasture Site

this study was approximately half that found by
Rose and Burnett (1990, 1999) for the Caddo
region of the eastern Gulf Coastal Plain. Given
the distance from the Red River, poor
preservation of bone surfaces, and low
settlement density, the Upper Neches should
have reasonably low infection rates. At 11.1­
13.9 percent for the Upper Neches River basin
population, this in fact is the case. Combined
with the study of the Pine Tree Mound
population from the Sabine River basin (Wilson
2008a) and the Hatchel, Mitchell, Eli Moores
sites study (Lee 1997), it does support Burnett’s
(1990, 1999) hypothesis that infection rates were
lower south of the Red River.
What differs from Rose et al.’s (1998) review of
Red River and East Texas Caddo is the temporal
trends in infection rates. Instead of peaking in
the Early Caddo and Historic Caddo periods,
infection rates double with each successive time
period until the Historic Period when there is no
infection. With the exception of the Historic
Caddo period, the infection rate parallels
increases in maize consumption and likely
increasing settlement density. The relatively
high incidence of childhood stress during the
Historic period coupled with the lack of
infection and decreased mean age at death
indicates that individuals were succumbing to
diseases before bone involvement had time to
occur.
Enamel hypoplasia and porotic hyperostosis are
the only indicators of adaptive efficiency that are
not influenced by poor preservation to the
degree of infection, degenerative joint disease
and trauma. Rates of enamel hypoplasia are
lower in the Upper Neches River basin than
elsewhere and support a higher adaptive
efficiency in the Pineywoods that may be due to
factors other than maize consumption (which is
consistent with other Caddo regions in Texas).
Rates of enamel hypoplasia also show that there
was a significant increase in childhood stress
during the Historic Caddo period. This may be
the result of epidemic disease and social stress
and/or increased maize consumption. Further
examination of this is needed both within and
outside the Upper Neches.

400

Porotic hyperostosis was rare in the Upper
Neches population.
It, unfortunately, has
ambiguous meaning among the Caddo. The
suprainion depressions show that scalp infection
was present among the Caddo of the Upper
Neches; however, the case of cribra orbitalia
also indicates that iron deficient anemia was
present, at least during the Historic period.
Porotic hyperostosis is seen only during the Late
and Historic Caddo periods in the Upper
Neches. Porotic hyperostosis is absent during
the Middle Caddo period when Rose et al.
(1998) showed a peak for other Caddo from the
Red River and East Texas areas.
Unfortunately, this study cannot adequately
address issues of workload stress due to poor
preservation. It is clear that this is a problem in
much of the Caddo region (Rose et al. 1998) and
needs further study. Both robusticity of the tibia
and the overall picture of pathological
conditions related to biomechanical stress
suggest that there was a strict division of labor
among the Caddo from the Upper Neches and
that males bore the brunt of labor stress.
Although the number is small, all individuals
with fracture, enthesiopathies, and degenerative
joint disease are male (excepting the fracture
found in the commingled remains from E. W.
Henry for whom sex could not be determined).
This study sought to test Burnett’s (1990, 1999)
hypothesis that peoples inhabiting drainages to
the south of the Red River had a greater adaptive
efficiency. This study shows that the Upper
Neches River population and the Lang Pasture
site population had high adaptive efficiency until
the Historic Caddo period. This study has
already shown that agriculture did not
necessarily enter the archeologicalsequence of
the Upper Neches later than elsewhere, or that it
was practiced with less intensity in the Upper
Neches due to a more productive natural
resource base than in the Blackland Prairie. A
low population density in the Upper Neches may
have protected the health that increased maize
consumption is often assumed to affect
adversely. The Upper Neches Caddo were
genetically homogenous, and had a lower
population density than was the case in the Red
River area.
These factors, coupled with

Technical Report No. 174202

Archeological Investigations at the Lang Pasture Site (41AN38) in the Upper Neches River Basin of East Texas
Texas Department of Transportation

relatively poor bone preservation, influence
observation on health, but it is likely that smaller
populations with less admixture had better
health and certainly less infectious disease. It is
worth investigating whether distance from the
Red River has a greater influence over adaptive
efficiency than rainfall
and corresponding
vegetative zones. Using Burnett’s (1990, 1999)
data, settlement density within the Red River
was considerably higher than the Caddo average,
with a mean of 31.7 individuals per component;
it is here that Lee (1999) described the greatest
concentration of population admixture, and here
where Derrick and Wilson (1997) found the
greatest variety of cranial modeling styles within
sites. In concert, these factors increase the
likelihood of infectious disease through
increased population flux, interpersonal contact
and increased concentration of waste.

Technical Report No. 174202

The decreased adaptive efficiency that is seen in
the Historic Period may be the result of a small
sample size (n=15) and warrants further
investigation both within and outside the Neches
River basin. The apparent decreased adaptive
efficiency of the Historic period may be the
result of a further increase in maize
consumption, increased settlement density
within sites, and/or external social stress and
disease.

CHAPTER 11
11CADDO MORTUARY PRACTICES IN THE UPPER NECHES RIVER BASIN IN
EAST TEXAS
Timothy K. Perttula
11.1

INTRODUCTION

Caddo mortuary features from planned
cemeteries1 have the potential to contribute
important information on the social and
gender differences as well as religiousphilosophical beliefs that existed among
prehistoric Caddo populations that lived in the
upper Neches River basin in East Texas. Is
there evidence within or between sites in this
region of social, gender, and religiousphilosophical differences that may have
existed in prehistoric times? The examination
of the complexity and character of mortuary
behaviors (i.e., the placement and orientation
of the deceased; the energy invested in the
mortuary rituals; the amounts of grave goods
placed with the dead; the kinds of grave goods
placed with the dead; and the locale where the
dead were buried) can contribute new
information on the mortuary treatment of postA.D. 1300 Caddo agricultural communities,
beginning with the community of which the
Caddo residents of the Lang Pasture site were
a part. This examination can be made more
compelling by turning our attention to the size
and organization of other generally
contemporaneous Caddo cemeteries in the
upper Neches River basin (see Story and Creel
1982:33) as well as elsewhere in the middle
Neches and Angelina river basins (Good 1982;
Creel et al. 2005), and building on the basic
conclusions
from
current
mortuary
information that Caddo groups in these locales
lived in “habitation sites [that] were usually
not occupied for long periods of time…the
population associated with any one settlement
was relatively small…and most statuses were
not ranked” (Story and Creel 1982:33).
The kinds of funerary objects associated with

Technical Report No. 174202

the interments and the energy invested in
burial treatment (i.e., shaft tombs versus
individual extended grave pits) provide the
information with which to examine the
organization of the different prehistoric and
early historic Caddo cemeteries by status, rank
or political scales, by gender, and with respect
to religious-philosophical beliefs (cf. Carr
1995; Cannon 2002, 2005). Information on
Caddo burial practices can be illuminated
when the sex and age of the individuals (when
that is available) is known, as well as would
information on the boundaries, sizes (i.e., the
number of deceased) and orientation of formal
cemetery areas.
Mortuary data from prehistoric Caddo sites in
the upper Neches River basin are relatively
abundant and competently documented, and
well suited for comparative analyses with the
burials from the small cemetery at the Lang
Pasture site (41AN38). The vast majority of
the available mortuary data derives from
University of Texas excavations in the 1930s
(Jackson 1931, 1933a-b; Pearce 1920; Pearce
and Woolsey 1935; Woolsey 1935a-p; see also
Cole 1975:337-357; Kleinschmidt 1982).
More limited Caddo mortuary data are
available from the Attaway site (41HE114;
Shafer 1981) and Vanderpool (41SM77)
(Anderson 1972:139; Perttula 2006), as well
as a few other sites in the Lake Palestine area
(Anderson 1972; Anderson et. al 1974;
Johnson 1961).
These mortuary data are sufficient to
determine the following: (1) the location of
cemeteries within sites and in relationship to
habitation areas and sources of water, adding a
spatial dimension to mortuary practices, since
cemeteries are spots on the landscape where

403

Chapter 11: Caddo Morturary Practices in the Upper Neches River Basin in East Texas

Caddo groups, “using both the natural and
created landscape, construct a setting that
gives permanent expression to both identities
and relationships” (Goldstein 2006:384); (2)
the age of many of the burials (i.e., adult vs.
child), and perhaps the sex as well (employing
the results of Diane Wilson’s analysis of
human remains in the Texas Archeological
Research Laboratory [TARL] collections from
the upper Neches River basin, see Chapter 10,
this volume, as well as the results of previous
physical anthropological examination); (3) the
kind and quantity of grave goods placed in
most of the burials, including information on
the placement of any goods of non-local
origin; and (4) the orientation and internal
arrangement of burials within cemeteries.
From these data, combined with comparable
mortuary data obtained from the analysis of
the Lang Pasture site burials, it is possible to
evaluate the hypothesis posed by Story and
Creel (1982:33) that upper Neches River basin
Caddo populations living in this area around
and after ca. A.D. 1400 did not have a social
hierarchical character, when contemporaneous
Caddo groups to the north (among Titus and
McCurtain phase groups) or east (Texarkana
and Belcher phase Caddo groups living on the
Red River) in East Texas, Southwest
Arkansas, and Northwest Louisiana) did (see
Kelley 1997; Perttula 2004, 2005; Trubowitz
1984; Webb 1959).
11.2

PERSPECTIVE ON MORTUARY
PRACTICES

Cemeteries represent distinctive and socially
significant places on the prehistoric Caddo
landscape, whether it be the upper Neches
River basin after the 14th century A.D. or in
the Red River basin in the 17th century. They
are places where past Caddo societies created
and renewed a sense of place and developed a
sense of social memory (e.g., Cannon
2002:193-194; Goldstein 2006:380), leading
to an appreciation of the social and spatial
dimensions of mortuary practices. Ashmore
and Geller (2005:87-88), among others, have
noted that burial places are appropriate places
for transforming the dead kin through life and
death cycles (cf. Silverman 2002:7) and

404

commemorating ancestral continuities through
ritual action. Burials, and cemeteries, reflect a
continuity of kin and community in their
location relative to the inhabited and habitable
landscape and in their location relative to other
deceased
Caddo
peoples.
Chesson
(2001b:110) has noted that:
On a regional scale, the people who buried
their dead…followed a particular set of
standards in their mortuary rites, forging a
sense of similarity between people in [the]
region, as well as nurturing a sense of tradition
in the treatment of [the] dead. These
communities shared a set of principles and
local knowledge that instructed them how to
treat their dead, where to commemorate them,
and the importance of maintaining these
practices. This knowledge, and the resulting
practices, may reflect a regional identity.
[emphasis added]
From this perspective, mortuary practices of
the prehistoric Caddo are believed to have
been guided by the cultural and social ideas
and traditions of the living Caddo people
concerning the afterlife as well as the
relationship of the living with their ancestors.
These ideas and relationships—essentially
social ties expressed in shared mortuary
rituals—can endure for generations. As
detailed in this chapter, shared ritual mortuary
practices among the prehistoric Caddo living
in the upper Neches River basin lasted as least
250-300 years (10-15 generations). Because
these mortuary practices are based on the
active beliefs of the living Caddo who laid the
deceased in graves in certain sacred areas,
with specific burial pit forms and orientations,
as well as certain kinds and quantities of grave
furniture (cf. Carr 1995:Table III), mortuary
practices provide key insights into Caddo
cosmology and ideology, particularly beliefs
on the afterlife, the nature of the soul, and
steps necessary to protect and save the souls of
the deceased.
The setting of cemeteries across the upper
Neches River basin region is not thought to be
haphazard, but should have a spatial and
historical context that can be related to

Technical Report No. 174202

Archeological Investigations at the Lang Pasture Site (41AN38) in the Upper Neches River Basin of East Texas
Texas Department of Transportation

traditions and beliefs shared by Caddo peoples
about universal order and the structure of the
cosmos (e.g., Carr 1995:Table XIV; Charles
2005:23-24; Kay and Sabo 2006; Sabo 2008).
The demographic dispersion of agricultural
Caddo peoples across the upper Neches River
basin, and the apparent belief that the dead
needed to be kept near to the living, led to the
accompanying dispersion of cemetery sites in
proximity to habitation areas and settlements.
These Caddo households defined their own
sense of place and who they were by the
unique juxtaposition of the living and the dead
in circumscribed areas with larger farming
communities. An emphasis on affinity and
kinship within and between different
households that created these sacred cemetery
places was more important to household
members than were their broader ties to the
larger communities of which they were a part.
Although these Caddo shared similar views on
social memory and the place of the dead in
their lives, it was their households and
associated cemeteries (i.e., their ritual space)
that were the center of their universe, not the
larger and socially more diverse communities.

11.3

CEMETERY AND BURIAL SAMPLE

Not including the Lang Pasture burials, there
are 35 roughly contemporaneous prehistoric
Caddo cemeteries in the upper Neches River
basin, most in Anderson and Cherokee
counties, that are the focus of our investigation
of the character of Caddo mortuary practices
(Figure 11-1 and Table 11-1). The presumed
age of these cemeteries as employed
throughout this chapter basically follows
Kleinschmidt (1982:212-228), whose temporal
seriation of cemeteries by Frankston phase
sub-phases 1, 2, and 3, and Allen phase
contexts has been confirmed by both
radiocarbon dating (see Chapter 5, this
volume) and the detailed examination of
engraved fine ware ceramic vessel funerary
offerings from a number of cemetery sites in
immediate proximity to the Lang Pasture site
(see Chapter 6, this volume).

Chapter 11: Caddo Morturary Practices in the Upper Neches River Basin in East Texas

These 35 cemeteries contained an estimated
167 individuals, ranging from 1 to 23 burials
per locale, and with a mean size of less than
five individuals per cemetery. Since the
investigations of each of the cemetery sites
was variable in terms of the extent of
excavations, it is doubtful that entire Caddo
burial populations were examined or defined
archeologically. Thus, the mean number of
burials per cemetery is probably a meaningless
number since it represents both an
amalgamation of sites where only a single
burial or a few burials were discovered (cf.
Johnson 1961; Shafer 1981)—but excavations
were not sufficient to determine if more
burials from a cemetery were present—to
cases where broad excavations by University
of Texas crew apparently were successful in
locating all or most graves in certain
cemeteries (see Woolsey 1935m, 1935p).
More apt comparisons of mortuary practices
can be derived from those examples where
burial excavations were intensive and the total
number of burials has been reasonably
established. In those cases, the largest Caddo
cemetery known in the upper Neches River
basin has 23 individuals (the Omer and Otis
Hood site, cemetery #1); most have around 10
interments, quite comparable in size and
internal complexity in burial treatment and
funerary offerings to the nine burials from the
Lang pasture cemetery. To the north, among
generally contemporaneous Titus phase Caddo
groups, a number of the cemeteries there have
more than 80 individuals (and as many as
200+, see Perttula [2005:377 and Figure 11­
10]), and large cemeteries with more than 50
individuals are known in Kinsloe phase sites
in the middle Sabine River drainage (cf. Jones
1968:157-159). The cultural implications of
these differences in cemetery site will be
further discussed below.
Documentation on these cemeteries in the
upper Neches River basin is available in the
records and unpublished manuscripts at TARL
as well as Anderson (1972), Anderson et al.
(1974), Cole (1975), Johnson (1961),
Kleinschmidt (1982), and Shafer (1981). From
this information, we examine the questions of

408

whether there are shared mortuary practices
that may reflect distinct and shared social,
religious, and philosophical beliefs about the
dead and the afterlife, as well as whether there
is a social hierarchical character to the
households within the settlement and the
larger community. This is accomplished by
comparisons with other Late Caddo family
cemeteries with similar information in the
upper Neches River basin (see Cole 1975;
Kleinschmidt 1982; Shafer 1981; Story and
Creel 1982, and reports on file at TARL
written in the 1930s), as well as from elite
burials in Caddo mound centers (i.e., the
George C. Davis site, see Story 2000) or lesser
centers. The detailed examinations of ceramic
styles and engraved rim motifs on the vessels
placed as funerary objects (see Chapter 6, this
volume) also provide information that may
help to establish if the social affiliations of the
household(s) at the sites relate to
geographically distinct socio-political groups.
Lang Pasture Site Burials
There are two distinct groups of Caddo burial
interments at the Lang Pasture site. The first
group is 10-17 m north of Structure 1, and
includes six adult burials (Features 8, 88, 91,
92, 93, and 94)—five in two rows and the
sixth (Feature 8) somewhat spatially removed
from the group—from an associated family
household cemetery (see Figure 5-4). These
six burials, which contained either one or two
individuals (Feature 93), had ceramic vessel
(n=27) and elbow pipes (n=2) as associated
funerary offerings. A second set of burials
(Features 76B, 76C, and 76D) were placed in
Feature 76, a large pit feature, to the east a
short distance northeast of Structure 1. These
burials had only four ceramic vessels as the
sole funerary offerings, with a mean of only
1.33 funerary offerings per individual (see
Table 5-9). All three individuals were children
(see Wilson, Chapter 10, this volume).
In each of the burials at the Lang Pasture site,
the deceased Caddo individual was apparently
laid out in an extended supine position on the
floor of the burial pit, with funerary offerings
placed on either one or both sides of the body,

Technical Report No. 174202

Archeological Investigations at the Lang Pasture Site (41AN38) in the Upper Neches River Basin of East Texas
Texas Department of Transportation

but also resting on the burial pit floor. The
three burials placed in Feature 76 were
oriented northwest-southeast (see Table 5-9),
with the head of the individual at the
southeastern end of the burial pit, and facing
to the northwest. The burial pits ranged from
115-200 cm in length and 63-69 cm in width;
the one smaller grave (Feature 76D) is likely
that of a small child, and as previously
mentioned, Wilson (Chapter 10, this volume)
indicates that the other two Feature 76 burials
were those of children. The other burials, all
adult Caddo individuals, are laid out in an
east-west position, in two north-south rows,
with the head of the deceased at the eastern
end of the burial pit, and thus facing to the
west (see Figure 5-48 and Table 5-9). The
burial pits from this second cluster range from
260-312 cm in length and 100-176 cm in
width (see Table 5-9).
There are several distinct and unique
characteristics of the Lang Pasture burials, as
will become more apparent when the other
upper Neches River basin Caddo burials are
discussed next. First, three of the burials
(Feature 76B-D) were placed within a large
and existing pit feature, rather than being
placed in burial pits dug from a current ground
surface; two (Feature 76B and Feature 76C)
were placed side by side; this is a previously
undocumented form of burial of Caddo
children. Second, the orientation of these
burials (northwest-southeast), with the head at
the southeastern end of the burial pit, had also
not been previously documented in upper
Neches River basin Caddo cemeteries. Third,
two of these burials (Feature 76B and C) were
apparently placed atop an extensive sherd
deposit deliberately laid down within the
partially filled in Feature 76 basin. Fourth, two
of the burials (Feature 8 and Feature 94) had
evidence of small fires that had been placed at
the foot of the grave. Fifth, one of the graves
(Feature 93) had two adults placed in it. Sixth,
one of the burials (Feature 93) had a very
distinctive red gravelly fill. And last, the
burial pits of the first burial group (Features 8,
88, 91-94) are larger in length and width than
all but a few of the Caddo burials from the

Technical Report No. 174202

other upper Neches River basin graves (see
Table 11-1).
11.4

MORTUARY RITUALS AND BURIAL
FEATURES

Cemetery Size
As noted above, the average size of an upper
Neches River basin Caddo cemetery is less
than five individuals, but with a range from 1­
23 individuals (see Table 11-1). As others
have noted, the variation in the size of the
cemeteries relate not only to the length of time
that they were used by different families and
lineages, but also to whether the cemeteries
were used by a larger community such as is
the case among Titus phase Caddo groups
(Perttula 2005:377), or just by extended and
kin-related family members. In the case of the
upper Neches River basin Caddo, it is
suspected that these cemeteries were used only
by members of a small number of related
settlements that are part of a single
community, as populations contributing to
each of them must not have been substantial
(e.g., Story and Creel 1982:33); they are best
considered to be family or multi-family
cemeteries. In fact, because of their small size
and their intimate spatial relationship with
associated settlements, with respect to
Frankston and Allen phase cemeteries, Shafer
(1981:156) has suggested that “the relative
duration of the hamlets (settlements) can be
measured by the number of graves in the
cemeteries and relative temporal placement of
each hamlet can be determined by seriating
mortuary assemblages.”
Consider that a community with a population
of 100 and a hypothetical mortality or death
rate of three percent.per year, a not
unreasonable death rate for individuals
between 5-50 years of age in a sedentary
agricultural population like the Caddo
(Chamberlain 2006:25-29 and Figure 3.6),
would create a death assemblage of
approximately 10 individuals in 3.3 years.
Similarly, an extended family or two in a
small farmstead compound of approximately
20 people would create a death assemblage of

409

Chapter 11: Caddo Morturary Practices in the Upper Neches River Basin in East Texas

10 individuals in only 17 years with a 3%
death rate. These hypothetical computations
indicate that only a matter of a few years to a
single generation would need to have elapsed
for either the occupants of a small Caddo
farmstead compound or a small community of
related individuals to create nearby cemeteries
of the range in size documented in upper
Neches River basin Caddo sites.

(Hatcher 1927a:162), he noted that “as soon as
the souls leave the body they travel towards
the west and from there they rise once more
into the air and go close to the presence of the
great captain whom they call caddi ayo. From
there they go to wait in a house located
towards the south, called the House of Death.”
For the Caddo, the soul’s travel to the west is
also associated with the setting of the sun.

Burial Orientation

There are a few notable exceptions to the eastwest burial orientation in upper Neches River
basin Caddo cemeteries. One burial (AL-9) at
the E. W. Henry site (41CE17) was placed in
an east-west oriented pit (Figure 11-2), but its
head was at the western end of the grave and
faced to the east (Woolsey 1935k:47). Several
others had their heads facing to the southwest
(see Table 11-1), while, as previously
mentioned, three child burials from the Lang
Pasture site faced to the northwest. The
orientation of these burials may have been
more influenced by the position of the sunset
at certain times of the year (i.e., summer and
winter solstice) or their position relative to the
House of Death in the southwestern sky (Kay
and Sabo 2006:32), rather than to beliefs that
the soul traveled west on their journey to the
House of Death. In any respect, these few
exceptional burial treatments do not change
the fact that an east-west body orientation was
likely primarily due to a near universal belief
in the direction of the afterlife and the soul’s
journey to the afterlife.

The vast majority of the upper Neches River
Caddo burials were placed singly in pits that
were oriented east-west, with the deceased’s
body placed on their back in an extended,
supine position, with the head at the eastern
end of the grave, facing west. Sabo (2008:15­
20) has noted that:
among the Caddo, the western
cardinal direction, associated with the
setting sun, symbolizes death and the
realm of ancestral souls whereas the
eastern cardinal direction, associated
with the rising sun, symbolizes life
and the realm of the living. Eastfacing rituals accordingly would be
associated with life-affirming events,
such as agricultural ceremonies or
community renewal celebrations.
West-facing rituals, on the other hand,
would logically be associated with
life-threatening events, such as
hunting, warfare, or funeral rites.

Caddo mortuary practices by Fray Espinosa

Figure 11-3. Plan of the Caddo Cemetery at the Mrs. J. M. Cook Site (41AN1).

Burials were typically placed in single or
multiple rows, either east-west (Figure 11-3)
or north-south rows (Figures 11-4, 11-5, and
11-6), with each body separated from the other
by ca. 1 m (Figure 11-7). The rows may have
had as many as seven individuals before a
second row of burials were added to the
interments, although Creel et al. (2005:10 and

Technical Report No. 174202

Figure 7) have detected through remote
sensing a probable single north-south row of
Late Caddo or historic Caddo burials at the
George C. Davis site that has 12 individuals.
Burial pit sizes, funerary offerings, and
preserved human remains suggest that the
majority of the burials in the family cemeteries
are adult males and females.

Chapter 11: Caddo Morturary Practices in the Upper Neches River Basin in East Texas

Caddo adults and children were buried
together in a few of the cemeteries, based at
least on the differences in size of the burial
pits, rather than on the recovery and study of
human skeletal remains because the remains
of children rarely tend to be preserved in the
sandy burial fills of upper Neches River basin
graves. These few instances include two of the
four burials at the Fred McKee site (Woolsey
1935l), two of the burials at the Pierce
Freeman site (Jackson 1931:3-15), at least two
children at the Jim P. Allen site (Woolsey
1935p; Cole [1975:322] suggests that children
were buried in a separate section of this
cemetery, apart from the adult burials), three
children in cemetery #1 at the Omer and Otis
Hood site (Woolsey 1935m), one burial at the
A. H. Reagor site (Woolsey 1935h), three
children at the E. W. Henry site (Woolsey
1935k), one or two burials from the R. J. Fair
site (Woolsey 1935i), and one of two burials at
the A. S. Mann site (Woolsey 1935g).
Significantly, seven of the eight sites in the
upper Neches River basin with child burials
placed in cemeteries date only after ca. A.D.
1480, and 63% of these sites date after the
mid-16th century. Children also were probably
buried in pits under house floors (although this
has not been documented in the upper Neches
River basin because few Caddo structures
have ever been identified or excavated in past
archeological investigations), likely while the
houses were still occupied by an extended
family (cf. Story 1995:241).

elite burials in Mound C at the George C.
Davis site (Story 1997, 1998) and the Reavely
Mound at the Washington Square site (Corbin
and Hart 1998) that date prior to ca. A.D.
1300/1400. This particular Smith County
burial had an abundance of funerary objects,
among them 21 pottery vessels (of Frankston
phase types), a celt, and a Jowell knife; the
recovery of the Jowell knive suggests this
burial feature dates late in the Frankston
phase, likely after ca. A.D. 1600, since Jowell
knives are relatively common offerings in late
17th-mid-18th century Allen and Kinsloe phase
burials (Cole 1975; Jones 1968).

There are a few instances where more than
one Caddo individual was placed in a burial
pit. This includes Feature 93 at the Lang
Pasture site and Burial AO-1/AO-2 at the
Jasper Tucker site (41AN44, see Woolsey
1935o; see Figure 11-1). Anderson (1972:139­
140) mentions an unidentified site on County
Line Creek in Smith County (in the vicinity of
41SM79, see Figure 11-1), about 20 km to the
northeast, where a burial had been excavated
by collectors that had three individuals
interred in a 3.6 m wide pit; the size of this
tomb as well as the number of individuals
placed in it, although not found in a mound,
bears some resemblance to the treatment of

In general, there is not much diversity in burial
treatment of the deceased in prehistoric Caddo
societies in the Upper Neches River basin.
This limited diversity in burial treatment is
part of the evidence preserved in the mortuary
practices that strongly hints that there were not
any considerable social organizational
differences between affiliated and kin-related
farmsteads that created these cemeteries (cf.
Carr 1995:157 and Tables XIII and XIV). Carr
(1995:Tables XI and XIV) suggests that body
treatment, body preparation, and body
orientation closely track beliefs about the soul
and the afterlife more than they do the social
position of the deceased.

414

Only rarely did burials in these upper Neches
River basin cemeteries intrude or intersect one
another (AM-5 and AM-6 at the R. J. Fair site
[see Figure 11-5 and Woolsey 1935i] and AQ­
1, AQ-6, and AQ-10 in cemetery #1 at the
Omer and Otis Hood site [Woolsey 1935m]).
It seems likely that the burials probably had
wood post markers or some other form of
commemoration at one end of the burial pit to
insure that individual burials were kept
separate and did not disturb earlier burials in
sacred ground. The near absence of
intersecting burials also suggests that these
cemeteries were not used for long periods of
time, as the memory of specific burial
locations and rows of burials still remained
strong among the living.
Burial Pit Treatment

Technical Report No. 174202

Archeological Investigations at the Lang Pasture Site (41AN38) in the Upper Neches River Basin of East Texas
Texas Department of Transportation

In the upper Neches River basin region, Caddo
burials typically were placed in long and
relatively narrow pits that were excavated to
no more than 50-100 cm in depth. The fact
that the pits tend to be narrow from the head to
the foot of the burial suggests that the feet and
ankles of the deceased may have been tied
together. There was substantial room in the
burial pits around the head, shoulders, and
upper body of the deceased, probably for the
purpose of leaving sufficient room to place
food stuffs, ceramic vessels, and other
accompanying funerary objects.
Not all Caddo received the same burial
treatment and burial pit preparation at death.
Several burials, including one at the Lang
Pasture site, had a hard-packed gravel burial
fill. These others include burial E-6 at the Mrs.
J. M. Cook site (Jackson 1931) (see Figure 11­
3) and burial AH-10 at the Jim P. Allen site
(41CE12) (Woolsey 1935p:64); here the
gravel lens was placed “under the middle part
of the skeleton and extending to edge of grave
on both sides of the skeleton” (see Figure 11­
7).

only by age and sex), but a definitive
determination of this is hampered by little
comprehensive information on the age and sex
of the deceased individuals from these
excavated cemeteries. It has been assumed in
archeological analyses of prehistoric mortuary
practices that “the abundance and quality of
burial goods equate with status” (Cobb
2003:72). However, this assumption needs
reconsideration given the many factors that
come into play that can account for the
number and kind of funerary offerings placed
in the grave by the living (see Chesson
2001a:4-7), particularly since “mortuary
rituals are frequently utilized by the living to
negotiate, display, mask, or transform actual
power or social relations” (Rakita and
Buikstra 2005:7).

Funerary Offerings

It does appear to be the case with upper
Neches River basin Caddo burials that only a
few individuals in these communities had
access (either in life or death) to the kinds,
numbers, and variety of funerary offerings that
have been documented in Caddo cemeteries
and individual burial features in mound
contexts, in shaft tombs, or in other special
mortuary contexts from East Texas where
individuals had distinctive exotic and nonlocal funerary offerings. From the available
evidence at the Lang Pasture site, none of the
burial features appear to be those of
individuals of high social status ranking.
Nevertheless, there are certain individuals in
this region, probably adult males, that are
found with high numbers of ceramic vessels
and/or arrow point quivers and pipes, as well
as a diverse array of other sorts of funerary
offerings; these individuals may represent
those with a higher social position, likely the
heads of different lineages or extended kin
groups that resided in nearby farmsteads, and
ended up being interred in associated
cemeteries amidst their kin relations.

The kinds, proportions, and absolute number
of funerary offerings in upper Neches River
basin Caddo sites do not show much evidence
among these individuals for differential status
or social rank, although there may be gender
differences (i.e., artifact associations differ

Ethnographic information about East Texas
Hasinai Caddo mortuary practices suggest that
in a symbolic and material sense the items
used by individuals in life, as well as the range
of goods needed to accompany the deceased
on their journey to the other world (or the

cemetery #1, burial AQ-6 had a 51 cm thick
white clay deposit that filled the bottom half
of this deep (1.32 m) burial pit (Woolsey
1935m). There was a long-term importance of
clay in Caddo burial rituals (Gonzalez
2005:57), particularly the washing of the body
in red clay. It may be significant that the color
white is a counterpoint to red clay (associated
with the Other World). Thus, there appears to
have been a general symbolic significance for
Caddo peoples in the upper Neches River
basin with respect to different colors and their
cosmological views about the world (cf. Cobb
and Drake 2008).

Chapter 11: Caddo Morturary Practices in the Upper Neches River Basin in East Texas

House of Death), were placed with the
deceased in their graves. In 1691, Fray
Casanas noted that for the Caddo, “when all
the souls are gathered together [in the House
of Death] they will enter another world to live
anew. For this reason, they bury their dead
with all the arms and utensils which each
possesses and for several days they carry
something to eat to the place where they have
buried a person” (Hatcher 1927c:294). Fray
Hidalgo in 1716 stated that at death, after the
deceased had been bathed, the Caddo “place
there something of everything they have to eat
as well as buffalo hides…They place there
provisions for the journey and other
possessions to serve for clothing” (Hatcher
1927b:57). Fray Espinosa made similar
observations, namely that the Caddo “provide
great quantities of pinole, corn, and other
eatables” for the deceased, which they place in
the grave (Hatcher 1927a:162). He went on to
write that if the deceased was a man, the
Caddo “collect his bows and arrows, his knife,
and the other things needed in life and, if it be
a woman, all her domestic utensils, canisters,
grinding instruments, and earthen-ware
vessels, because they say the dead will have
need of them where they are going” (Hatcher
1927a:162). That these practices were
maintained into modern times is indicated by
20th century Caddo ethnographic informants
of Parsons (1941:37), who told her that they
would “put into the grave whatever they think
the deceased should take with her or him, for a
woman, cooking utensils, plates, etc., clothing;
and for a man, besides clothes and blankets,
bow and arrows ‘to defend himself on his road
if anything bother him’.”

416

In the upper Neches River basin in later
prehistoric times, after ca. A.D. 1300-1400,
the Caddo placed a number of different kinds
of funerary offerings in the graves of the
deceased (Table 11-2). The principal and
ubiquitous funerary offering in virtually every
grave—regardless of age or sex—were
ceramic vessels, including bottles (13%),
bowls and carinated bowls (70%), and cooking
jars (17%) (Perttula 2000:Table 7). These
vessels must have held, at least symbolically,
foods and liquid provisions that the deceased
would have used to quench their thirst and
hunger on their journey to the House of Death.
Furthermore, these mortuary assemblages may
have been placed in the graves “to mirror a
mini-household assemblage envisioned to take
care of the needs of that specific individual”
(Shafer 1981:175).
Other important funerary offerings in
prehistoric Caddo cemeteries include arrow
points, usually in quivers, and clay pipes, as
both of these kinds of objects are found in at
least one burial at each of the better
documented cemeteries. Among the less well
represented funerary objects are large bifacial
and/or beveled knives, chipped and/or ground
stone tools, marine shell ornaments (beads and
disks), clay pigments or chunks of hematite
pigment, animal bone tools or beads, or in the
case of Allen phase cemeteries, European
trade goods (see Table 11-2).

Through time, the proportion of burials with
ceramic vessel funerary offerings remained
remarkably consistent, with vessels placed as
offerings in 88-100% of the known burials
(Table 11-3), peaking during the historic Allen
phase. It seems likely that beliefs about the
provisioning of the dead remained virtually
unchanged. Arrow points (16-36.8% of the
burials by phase and sub-phase) and clay pipes
(16.7-34.8% of the burials by phase and subphase) also tend to have been placed as
offerings in the same relative proportions in
both Frankston and Allen phase contexts,
although arrow point and clay pipe offerings
were more likely to have been placed in
greater quantities and greater relative
proportions with Frankston 2 and 3 sub-phase
burials (ca. A.D. 1480-1650), particularly
those of adult males.
Such is not the case with the other kinds of
funerary offerings, namely stone tools, knives,
marine shell, pigments, animal bone objects,
or European trade goods. Discounting the
European trade goods (i.e., glass beads and
metal artifacts), which would only have been
available to Allen phase Caddo groups, all of
these other categories of funerary offerings
were only commonly placed in the burials of
Caddo individuals in either post-A.D. 1650
Allen phase cemeteries or a few post-A.D.
1560 Frankston phase cemeteries, and not
before (see Table 11-3). This fundamental
change in the kinds and proportions of
funerary offerings placed with the deceased
suggests that some differences and changes in
mortuary beliefs and practices occurred among
the Caddo in the upper Neches River basin
around the mid-16th century and were then
maintained through the early part of the 18th
century, if not longer.

Technical Report No. 174202

These temporal, and presumably social,
religious, and philosophical, differences in
Caddo mortuary practices are also evident if
we examine the mean number of funerary
offerings per burial in the better documented
upper Neches River basin cemeteries,
including the two burial groupings at the Lang
Pasture site (Table 11-4). The cemeteries sort
clearly into two distinct groups: (a) one group
from 12 different sites throughout the region
that have higher mean numbers of funerary
offerings (ranging from at least 7.00-17.34
offerings per burial in each cemetery; and (b)
a second group of seven cemeteries in the
upper Neches—among them the Lang Pasture
burials as well as the Deshazo site (see Good
1982; Story 1995)—with burials that have few
funerary offerings.
The principal difference in the funerary
offerings between these two groups of
prehistoric Caddo cemeteries rests in the
numbers and relative proportions of arrow
points placed in the graves (see Table 11-4). In
the first grouping of cemeteries, arrow points
comprise between 30-68% of the items placed
with the deceased, while the majority of the
deceased individuals buried in the second
group of cemeteries either lack arrow point
quiver offerings or they comprise less than
20% of all the funerary offerings. Pipes and
lithic tools are also proportionally more
common in the first group of cemetery sites
(see Table 11-4).
In the second group of cemeteries, those
where burials have lesser amounts of funerary
offerings in general, ceramic vessels account
for 80-100% of the funerary offerings (see
Table 11-4). Conversely, in the cemeteries
dominated by offerings of arrow point quivers,
ceramic vessels represent only 33-68% of the
funerary offerings.

Taking into account the fact that cemeteries
contain the burials of both adult men and
women, as well as some children, it is likely
that this diversity in the absolute quantity
and kinds of funerary offerings in upper
Neches River basin Caddo sites represent
the existence of social differences among the
Caddo communities that created and
maintained these cemeteries, particularly
between adult men and women. These social
differences and changes in social
relationships between adult men and women
also have a temporal character, in that 50%
of the cemeteries with high mean numbers

Technical Report No. 174202

of funerary offerings and arrow point
quivers date after ca. A.D. 1560 (and 83%
date after ca. A.D. 1480), when the status of
adult men relative to women in their society
may have been increasing, while 67% of the
cemeteries with low mean numbers of
funerary offerings per burial date before ca.
A.D. 1560 (and 50% date before ca. A.D.
1480). Prior to ca. A.D. 1560, then, the
social position of adult Caddo men and
women appears to have been more or less
the same within upper Neches River
communities.

Chapter 11: Caddo Morturary Practices in the Upper Neches River Basin in East Texas

Age and Sex Characteristics in Caddo
Mortuary Practices
In a study of a Frankston phase (sub-phase
2) cemetery at the Attaway site (41HE114)
on the west side of the Neches River (see
Figure 11-1 and Tables 11-1, 11-2, and 11­
4), Shafer (1981:175) suggested that the
sexual status of Caddo individuals at this
site may have played an important role in
the kinds of funerary offerings placed in
their graves at death. Specifically, Shafer
hypothesized that clay pipes, clusters of
arrow points, and celts were characteristic
offerings placed with adult males, and that
the selection of the kinds of vessels placed
in graves was along gender lines.
These types of age and sex relationships
with respect to the character of funerary
offerings has been well-documented in
contemporaneous Titus phase cemeteries
(cf. Thurmond 1990; Turner 1992; Perttula
2005) in East Texas, certainly with respect
to offerings that are strongly associated with
adult males, but also with ceramic vessels
used for provisioning of the dead. In Titus
phase burials, for instance, bowls were most
common in the graves of adolescents and
younger children, although they were also
placed in the graves of both adult males and
females. Cooking jars were more frequent
funerary offerings among adult females and
adolescents, and children had more jars than
did adult males. Compound bowls were
particularly common in the graves of
younger children, adolescents, and adult
females, while carinated bowls were most
frequent in the graves of adult males. All
burials contained at least a single bottle
(Perttula 2005:259, 261). From these
differences, it seems likely that the needs of
the dead differed in Titus phase societies
between adults and children/juveniles. Were
there similar age and sex differences in
funerary offerings in upper Neches Caddo
burials?
The best available mortuary data in the
upper Neches River basin on the placement

422

of funerary offerings with Caddo individuals
of different age and sex is from a few Allen
phase sites (see Cole 1975:176-336), due in
large part to the preservation of skeletal
remains from these early historic Caddo
burials that could be aged and sexed. Cole’s
findings are as follows: (1) the
preponderance of arrow points, chipped
stone scraping tools, Jowell and Anderson
knives, bison bone tools, and clay pipes
were placed with adult males over 20 years
of age; and (2) adult males and children
tended to have beveled knives and green
(glauconite pigments) clay pigments placed
with them as funerary offerings. Overall,
ceramic vessels, on the other hand, were
seemingly uniformly placed with adult
males, females, and children (Cole 1975);
their needs with respect to the provisioning
of foods and liquids were about the same.
However, Hood Engraved effigy vessels
were a more frequent funerary offering in
the graves of adult males, as were Patton
Engraved, var. Allen, Simms Engraved, var.
Darco, Taylor Engraved, and Hume
Engraved, var. Allen fine wares. Other
forms of Patton Engraved (var. Fair and
var. Freeman) were equally common
offerings in the graves of adult men and
women, while Patton Engraved, var. Patton
vessels, the ultimate Allen phase serving
vessel, were equally abundant in the graves
of adult men, women, and children.
Additional demographic analyses of upper
Neches River basin Caddo skeletal remains
by Wilson (Chapter 10, this volume) provide
further insights into the treatment of the
deceased, and the offerings placed with
them, according to their age and sex.
Children as well as adults uniformly had
funerary offerings placed with them at
death. In the case of children and adult
females, the principal funerary offerings
were ceramic vessels (Table 11-5). Adult
females had approximately twice as many
funerary offerings as did children, and they
had more diverse kinds of offerings.

Adult men had a wealth of funerary
offerings placed with them at death (see
Table 11-5). In addition to ceramic
vessels—about the same number of vessels
as placed with adult females, again equating
to similar death provisioning needs among
adults—adult Caddo men had large chipped
stone knives, other stone or bone tools, clay
pipes, arrow points, marine shell ornaments,
and European trade goods. Clay pigments
were absent in the graves of adult men.
While not extensive (only 19 individuals of
known age and sex, see Table 11-5), the
demographic and funerary offerings data
clearly indicate that the kinds and amounts
of funerary offerings placed among upper
Neches River Caddo groups, and needed by
them in their journey to the House of Death,
varied significantly by age and sex. Other
than broad similarities in the number of

Technical Report No. 174202

vessels per burial—suggesting that these
vessels held sufficient food stuffs for
children and adults on their journey, but
nothing more—in all other aspects adult
men clearly had need in the afterlife of such
gender-laden things as stone tools and arrow
points, a clay smoking pipe, and ornaments
on their journey, while children and adult
females did not.
Three gender-laden exceptions are worth
noting in the Table 11-5 demographic and
funerary offerings data. Adult female or
probable adult female burials from the Fred
McKee site (41AN32, AP-3), Pierce
Freeman site (41AN34, D-2), and E. W.
Hackney site (41CE6, AN-1)—all post-A.D.
1560 Caddo cemeteries—had either clay
pipes, marine shell, or large chipped stone
knives placed in their graves along with
ceramic vessels. Provided that the

423

Chapter 11: Caddo Morturary Practices in the Upper Neches River Basin in East Texas

identifications of sex for these burials is
accurate, then it appears to be the case that
some Caddo women had access to, and used,
these material goods in life and then were
provided with them as an accompaniment in
death.
Notable Interred Individuals
Based on several attributes, including the
number of funerary offerings placed with the
dead,2 the number of individuals placed in a
burial pit, as well as the specific kinds of
artifacts included as funerary offerings, all
of which bespeak social differences (cf. Carr
1995:169, 179-180, 191), there are several
notable interred individuals among the ca.
A.D. 1400 to early historic Caddo burials in
the upper Neches River basin. These notable
interred individuals represent about 5% of
the known Caddo burial population in the
region.
These individuals include the following:
Burial F-1 at the J. M. Cook site
(41AN2). This adult individual had
a very large assortment of funerary
offerings (n=39), including five
vessels placed around the head and
by the left hip, two large chipped
stone knives by the left hip and right
knee, a large ceramic elbow pipe
between the legs and near the feet,
and 31 arrow points in quivers by
the right knee and between the legs
and near the feet (Jackson 1931);
Burial AO-1/AO-2 at the Jasper
Tucker site (41AN44). This
particular burial had two adult
individuals interred together. Also
notable is that between the two
individuals, a total of six Hood
Engraved effigy vessels were among
the funerary offerings (Woolsey
1935o:13); effigy vessels are
otherwise relatively rare funerary
offerings;

424

Burial AI-3 at the Mrs. J. W.
Blackburn site (41CE4) (see Figure
11-4). This adult had a large number
of funerary offerings (n=29),
including seven vessels placed
either by the head, from the waist to
the feet, or on the body, one clay
pipe by the right foot, and 21 Perdiz
arrow points in quivers by the head
and the right waist (Woolsey
1935b);
Burial AN-2 at the E. W. Hackney
site (41CE6), an Allen phase burial.
This adult individual had six
ceramic vessels by the head, left
shoulder, right arm, and left
leg/foot, six arrow points by the
skull and at the back of the head; a
large knive by the left side of the
body; 27 marine shell beads at the
waist and left arm (bracelet); and an
engraved pipe by the left arm
(Woolsey 1935j);
Three adult male individuals at the
Jim P. Allen site, another Allen
phase cemetery, were buried with
impressive amounts of funerary
offerings: AH-3 (n=53), AH-7
(n=60),
and
AH-10
(n=24)
(Woolsey 1935p) (see Figure 11-7).
Burial AH-3 (more than 40 years of
age at death), situated in the
approximate center of the cemetery,
had six ceramic vessels by the head,
hip, and left leg; a quiver of 27
arrow points by the left side of the
head; various lithic tools (two
beveled chipped stone knives, a
mallet/maul, three scrapers, and a
drill, all by the left arm); a clay pipe
by the right shoulder; a bison bone
by the right arm; and marine shell
beads and discs on the neck and
chest, and one by an ear; Woolsey
(1935p:113) commented that it was
the “richest and most valuable
burial” at the site. Burial AH-7,
about 8 m southwest of AH-3 (see

Technical Report No. 174202

Archeological Investigations at the Lang Pasture Site (41AN38) in the Upper Neches River Basin of East Texas
Texas Department of Transportation

Figure 11-7) had two vessels placed
by the head and left foot, a stone
knive by the left waist, 33 shell
beads on the waist (probably
decorating a sash), 22 arrow points,
including a quiver of 16 by the right
side, along the ribs, and a bison
bone tool by the right leg. Burial
AH-10, near the western end of the
cemetery (see Figure 11-7), had a
ceramic bottle placed by the head,
mussel shells above the head, seven
marine conch shell beads at the
waist, eight glass beads at the back
of the head and around the
deceased’s neck, a brass tinkler by
the right knee, and four arrow points
placed by the left side of the head;
and
Burial AQ-9 at the Omer and Otis
Hood site (41CE14) had a large
number (n=25) of funerary offerings
placed with the deceased. This
included seven ceramic vessels
around the head and shoulders, two
arrow point quivers (one by the right
hand and the other by the right leg)
with a total of 16 arrow points, and
two engraved ceramic elbow pipes,
placed by the two arrow point
quivers (Woolsey 1935m).
Half of these notable interred individuals are
from Allen phase contexts, and three of the
remaining four individuals are in Frankston
sub-phase 2 and sub-phase 3 cemeteries. In
other words, it appears that after ca. A.D.
1500, and certainly after ca. A.D. 1560,
there were a few Caddo individuals in upper
Neches River basin Caddo societies that
were recognized as having particularly
important social identities above that of
others in Caddo communities, probably
manifest in leadership roles within specific
communities. Where information on age and

Technical Report No. 174202

sex is available, these individuals appear to
have been adult males.
Placement of Cemeteries relative to
Domestic Habitation areas
Caddo cemeteries in the upper Neches River
basin tend to be situated in proximity to
springs, spring-fed tributaries, and small
streams, and on the periphery of habitation
locales (Figure 11-8). As such, their
distribution tends to match closely the
distribution of prehistoric Caddo settlements
in the basin (see Figure 11-1), wherein
domestic abodes are found on elevated
landforms along small to medium-sized
streams that are tributaries to the Neches
River, the principal drainage in the basin, as
well as along the Neches River itself. Caddo
populations appear to be distributed about
equally between these settings, based on the
distribution of known post-A.D. 1300/1400
Caddo sites in the region. Tributary streams
with notable concentrations of Caddo
habitation sites and cemeteries include
Caddo Creek—the Lang Pasture site and
cemetery is above a small stream in the
Caddo Creek drainage—Flat Creek, County
Line Creek, Brushy Creek, and Saline
Creek. On the Neches River itself, habitation
sites and cemeteries are concentrated in the
immediate vicinity—both north and south—
of the A. C. Saunders (41AN19) mound
center, but no cemeteries are known at this
mound center. It is likely that these
settlements and cemeteries represent parts of
a distinct political community or constituent
group (cf. Story and Creel 1982:33)
comprised of interrelated settlements and
cemeteries that are centered on a key site
distinguished by public architecture (i.e.,
earthen mounds as temple platforms) and
large domestic village areas.

425

Chapter 11: Caddo Morturary Practices in the Upper Neches River Basin in East Texas

Figure 11-8. The Placement of the Large Cemetery at the Jim Allen Site
(41CE12) Relative to Midden and Habitation Areas.

At the local or micro-scale, cemeteries are
well-defined and discrete sacred areas set
away from habitation debris, structures, and
midden deposits. Cemeteries also tend to be
placed in settings near freshwater and
flowing water, and between the sources of
freshwater and habitation areas, regardless
of the direction of water from the latter. A
good example is the E. W. Henry cemetery

426

(41CE17, see Figure 11-2), where the
“burial place was in almost direct line
between the midden and the watering place”
(Woolsey 1935k:1). With all things, there
are exceptions. In the case of the Frankston
phase cemetery at the Pierce Freeman site
(41AN34), the cemetery was on a hill slope
overlooking a small creek (Poley Creek),
and a considerable distance from water

Technical Report No. 174202

Archeological Investigations at the Lang Pasture Site (41AN38) in the Upper Neches River Basin of East Texas
Texas Department of Transportation

(Jackson 1931), as was the John Bragg site
cemetery (Jackson 1933b). At the Solon
Stanley site (41CE3), the cemetery was
more than 800 m from a small tributary to
Killough Creek, but unlike most of the other
cemetery and habitation sites, here the
midden and habitation areas were located
between the cemetery and freshwater;
Woolsey (1935a:16) commented that “this
situation is unusual, as graves are usually
between water and campsite.” Finally, at the
Woldert site (41HE80), a looted burial there
was found in a midden deposit, not in a
separate cemetery (Anderson et al.
1974:102).
Caddo ancestors and the dead played a role
in structuring the lives of the living. Once a
cemetery had been created in association
with a nearby set of farmsteads and small
communities, it imbued the landscape with a
duality of life and the hereafter, one that was
not readily transgressed. Thus, when the
farmsteads or small community was
abandoned after a generation or thereabouts
and the people moved to another locale
within the territory of the community, so to
was the cemetery, left to mark the dead in
the memory of the living. Rarely was a
cemetery returned to or re-used by the these
Caddo, and consequently, Caddo cemeteries
commonly dot the landscape lived in and
shaped by the life and death of upper Neches
River Caddo agricultural communities.

REGIONAL COMPARISONS IN
MORTUARY PRACTICES

The mortuary practices of the Caddo peoples
living in the upper Neches River basin
between ca. A.D. 1300 and the early 18th
century are in some ways quite comparable
to the set of mortuary practices documented
among contemporaneous Titus phase Caddo
groups in the Sabine and Cypress drainage
basins in East Texas (Perttula 2005:370­
388), as well as with historic Kinsloe phase
or Nadaco Caddo groups (cf. Jones
1968:157-159) in the middle reaches of the
Sabine River basin (Figure 11-9). In both
cases, these groups established formal
cemeteries of varying sizes, usually at some
distance from habitation or residential areas
and not in middens, where rows of
individuals—mostly adults—were buried in
an extended supine position, with the heads
of the deceased facing east. Each of these
individuals, whether male or female, was
accompanied by an assortment of funerary
offerings, generally ceramic vessels,
occasional quivers of arrow points, clay
pipes, stone tools, ornaments, and pigments.
These funerary offerings were placed around
the head and shoulders of the deceased, as
well as near their feet, and in rows along one
or both sides of the body.

Territories, the Upper Neches River Basin, the Titus Phase, the Kinsloe Phase, and
Selected Sites Mentioned in the Text.

One of the ways in which these Titus and
Kinsloe phase cemeteries differ from those
of the upper Neches River basin is in their
absolute size, with a number of the
cemeteries commonly containing more than
50-80 individuals. These are apparently
community cemeteries used by discrete
political
communities
for
several
generations; by contrast, community
cemeteries are not known in the upper

428

Neches. Both Titus and Kinsloe phase
Caddo societies also had smaller
cemeteries—family plots—near habitation
areas and farmsteads, and these cemeteries
tended to have had about 10-30 individuals
interred in them, about or near the same size
as the Caddo family cemeteries in the upper
Neches.

In the vast majority of Titus phase Caddo
burials, adults tended to have more funerary
offerings placed with them that did children
or adolescents, but adult males, adult
females, adolescents, and children received
different amounts and kinds of grave goods
to accompany them on their death journey
(Perttula 2000:107; Thurmond 1990:235­
236). Furthermore, graves of adult men
frequently contained clusters or quivers of
arrow points, while those of adult females
contained polishing stones (probably used in
ceramic vessel manufacture) or more diverse
numbers and kinds of pottery vessels. Very
few of these burials contained supra-local
offerings (cf. Brown 1981:29-30) made of
exotic or non-local materials.
As with the notable interred individuals
identified primarily in post A.D. 1560
Frankston and Allen phase cemeteries, there
are a number of burials found in Titus phase
cemeteries that are clearly those of
important people, typically males, either
adult members of the social elite, individual
community leaders, or heads of paramount
lineages (Perttula 2005:384). They received
special treatment at death, including unique
and rare artifacts (including large chipped
bifacial knives, marine shell ornaments, or
other exotic ceramic and lithic artifacts)
placed with them in the burial pits, just as
they must have had use of these artifacts
during their lives. Most of these individuals,
members of the social elite, were interred in
large community cemeteries or in shaft
tombs and burial mounds (Perttula
2005:Table 11-7). Most of the notable social
elite burials in Titus phase society date after
the early 16th century, and are found in
cemeteries dating at late as the early to mid­
17th century, if not later. This same
heightened sense of temporal changes in the
status relationship of certain adult Caddo
men is also apparent in the upper Neches
during this time, although overall, Titus
phase mortuary practices are more complex
in their structure and organization than has
been documented for Frankston and Allen
phase Caddo social groups. This in turn

Technical Report No. 174202

implies that kin-related groups within Titus
phase Caddo societies were more socially
hierarchical in character, or socio-politically
complex (cf. Carr 1995:169, 174) than were
upper
Neches
Caddo
groups and
communities.
The kinds and quantities of funerary
offerings in Kinsloe phase burials closely
mirror what has been recognized for post-ca.
A.D. 1650 burials and cemeteries in the
upper Neches. That is, individuals tended to
have placed with them at death not only an
assortment of ceramic vessels and arrow
point quivers, but also large bifacially
chipped knives (Anderson and Jowell types),
marine conch shell ornaments, clay
pigments, and European trade goods (see
Jones 1968). One distinctive feature of
Kinsloe phase cemeteries was the
checkerboard pattern of burial rows at the
Millsey Williamson, Susie Slade, and
Brown #1 sites. In these cemeteries, the
burials were also more widely spaced (1-4.5
m) in alternating rows than is the case for
either Frankston/Allen or Titus phase
interments.
The Deshazo site (41NA27) is perhaps the
best-studied Caddo domicile in East Texas
(Story 1982, 1995). This site (see Figure 11­
9), on a tributary to the Angelina River, was
occupied by a Hasinai Caddo group between
ca. A.D. 1686-1714. An associated cemetery
with 10 individuals was situated across an
unnamed tributary stream from the
habitation area. Here, adult individuals were
placed in a row that was oriented northeastsouthwest, very different from the upper
Neches Caddo, with the heads of the
deceased in the southeastern portion of the
grave pit, and they faced to the northwest
(Figure 11-10). This distinctive orientation
suggests that the Caddo living at the
Deshazo site may have had different beliefs
about the direction in which souls traveled at
death, or the location of the House of Death
in the sky, than did their upper Neches
brethren, and this is one expression about
differences in their regional identity.

429

Chapter 11: Caddo Morturary Practices in the Upper Neches River Basin in East Texas

Figure 11-10. Plan of the Cemetery at the Deshazo Site (41NA27) (from Good
1982: Figure 28).

Furthermore, there may be a relationship
between this distinctive body orientation and
particular mortuary beliefs about both the
importance of winter and summer solstices
and specific cosmological frames of
reference in insuring the “condition of the
souls of the dead” (Kay and Sabo 2006:39)
here that did not exist in upper Neches
Frankston and other Allen phase population
mortuary beliefs. The dead buried in the
Deshazo cemetery were accompanied by a
very limited range and quantity of offerings
(see Table 11-4; see also Good 1982;
Perttula 1992:Table 15), including one to
three ceramic vessels per burial and some
amount of European glass trade beads. Story
(1995:241) suggests that the mortuary
patterning is the product of a “small,

430

egalitarian” Caddo society with only limited
social differences in status by age or sex. It
is possible that the greater diversity in the
kinds and numbers of funerary offerings in
burials at the Deshazo site that have
European trade goods may indicate that an
individual Caddo’s access to these goods
enhanced their social importance (Perttula
1992:185); such may also be the situation
with certain Kinsloe phase burials and an
older adult male (AH-10) at the Richard
Allen cemetery in the upper Neches River
valley.

SUMMARY AND CONCLUDING
COMMENTS

“Relationships to places may also
find expression through the agencies
of myth, prayer, music, dance, art,
architecture,
and,
in
many
communities, recurrent forms of
religious and political ritual. This
represented and enacted—daily,
monthly, seasonally, annually—
places and their meanings are
continually woven into the fabric of
social life, anchoring it to features
of the landscape and blanketing it
with layers of significance that few
can appreciate” (Basso 1996:57)
The prehistoric and early historic Caddo
cemeteries found in the upper Neches River
basin (a ca. 1700 km2 area, see Figure 11-1)
represent the social, material, and religioussymbolic beliefs about death, the soul, and
the afterlife among a series of small
communities and affiliated farmsteads. The
adults and children buried in these
cemeteries are believed to have been lineally
related, perhaps in some form of corporate
descent group or lineage (Goldstein 1980:7­
8). In this sense, then, “to the degree that
corporate group rights to use and/or control
crucial but restricted resources are attained
and/or legitimized by means of lineal
descent from the dead (i.e., lineal ties to
ancestors), such groups will maintain formal
disposal areas for the exclusive disposal of
the dead” (Saxe 1970:119). In these
situations, the placement of burials in
cemeteries (areas used exclusively for the
dead) are expected to reflect these lineal
relationships, with burials with the same
orientation and proximity in rows likely to
represent distinctive groups of related
individuals. The placement of burials one to
another, and the kinds of funerary offerings
placed with the dead, are intimately tied to
each person’s life, their ties to others in the
community, and to their social memories
within that community, as each deceased
person and their material surroundings

Technical Report No. 174202

“become significant in the orientation of
persons, both deceased and alive, in relation
to their past, present and future” (Hallam
and Hockey 2001:190).
At a broader spatial scale, the distribution of
Caddo cemeteries across the upper Neches
River basin represent the Caddo’s past in the
landscape, as also do the abandoned
farmsteads and farmstead compounds of
different
communities.
The
burials
themselves, and the consecration of each
cemetery as sacred ground, gave each place
a long-lasting meaning and cultural
significance in everyday life.
The mortuary practices of the prehistoric
Caddo communities that lived in the upper
Neches River basin of East Texas, as seen at
the Lang Pasture site and the many other
cemeteries in the region, include the
following attributes:
1. The cemeteries and burial places of
these Caddo were deliberately kept
physically distant from habitation areas, as
an act of separating the dead from the living
but also in creating a social memory of the
deceased in those places; they are often
placed near sources of fresh water;
2. The burials are primarily those of single
interments, usually adult men and women;
children were sometimes buried in
cemeteries along with adults (at least after
the ca. mid-16th century), but there are
instances both before and after the mid-16th
century where children were buried in
spatially distinct groups;
3. The graves are relatively shallow, and
are narrowed near the foot end, and the
deceased were laid in the graves in an
extended supine position, with their arms by
their sides;
4. In most cases, the deceased’s head was
at the eastern end of the grave, and faced
west towards the setting sun; in a few cases
where burial orientation of a few graves

431

Chapter 11: Caddo Morturary Practices in the Upper Neches River Basin in East Texas

was different, as at Lang Pasture (Features
76B-D), this may be evidence of a slightly
earlier (i.e., pre-A.D. 1400) form of burial
interment, perhaps one associated with the
summer and winter solstices. The westwardfacing burial orientation of the Caddo
deceased reflects the path in which the souls
traveled to their House of Death (e.g.,
Hatcher 1927a:162), while “east is the
direction of life” (Kay and Sabo 2006:32).
Kay and Sabo (2006:29, 33) further link this
directionality in Caddo mortuary practices
with a symbolic relationship between death
and winter, death imagery, and concern for
the dead, where mortuary rituals represent a
physical embodiment of cosmology as
expressed in the social order and a specific
set of beliefs about life, death, and socially
necessary funerary accompaniments;
5. Burials were in rows, with the graves
parallel to one another, in either east-west or
north-south rows; the burials were typically
only 1-2 m apart in these rows; the graves
rarely intersected; prepared grave floors are
rare, but when done, consisted of a gravel
fill or a white clay;
6. The cemeteries were not used for
substantial periods of time by any one
farmstead compound or group of related
farmsteads, perhaps no longer than 10-30
years at their maximum, based on the range
in the size of each cemetery and the number
and extent of associated habitation areas;
7. The common occurrence of charcoal in
the burial fill of many of the graves suggests
that as an important ritual, fire may have
been placed in the graves (near the feet) or
by the foot of the graves prior to the burial
pit being filled; the fires may have been kept
for six days (see Parsons 1941:37; Gonzalez
2005:57-59). The use of a controlled and
consecrated fire in mortuary ritual was an
important symbol for these Caddo people,
and “smoke appears to serve as an axis
mundi between life and death, or a path to
the spirit world” (Kay and Sabo 2006:33);

432

8. Almost all individuals, whether child or
adult, had accompanying offerings, both
durable as well as perishable (i.e., food
stuffs); the offerings placed with the
deceased almost invariably contain an
assortment of ceramic pottery vessels,
followed by for adult males arrow points
(commonly in quivers), clay pipes, chipped
stone knives, other kinds of stone tools,
marine shell ornaments, pigments, bone
tools or beads, and in the case of Allen
phase burials, a few European trade goods
(see Tables 11-2 and 11-3); pigments were
apparently specific offerings associated with
adult females; children had the lowest
number of funerary offerings as well as the
least diverse kinds of offerings. The
differences in funerary offerings between
children and adults are clearly related to
gender and personal identity; Story and
Creel (1982:23) reached the same
conclusions when they stated that among
East Texas Caddo burials “offerings
reflected the individual’s position in the
social organization;” in summary, since a
very high proportion of Caddo burials had
funerary offerings, it seems likely that the
placement of these offerings was a function
of both individual wealth and community
esteem (cf. Cannon 2005:52), reflecting
differences in gender status;
9. The fact that some adult Caddo females
had clay pipes and stone tools (large bifacial
knives) as funerary offerings suggests that
certain adult females participated along with
more adult men in both religious rituals
associated with smoking (cf. Rafferty and
Mann 2005:xiii-xv; Winter 2000:266) as
well as activities associated with the
specialized butchering of game animals;
10. The offerings were generally placed by
the head and shoulders, as well as at the
waist and by the hands and feet; in some
cases, the offerings appear to have been
placed on the body, usually at the hips and
on the legs; ceramic bottles were
consistently placed near the head; the
arrangement and placement of funerary

Technical Report No. 174202

Archeological Investigations at the Lang Pasture Site (41AN38) in the Upper Neches River Basin of East Texas
Texas Department of Transportation

offerings reflect particular social meanings
to these Caddo groups, as “items take on
specific meanings by dint of where they
were placed” (Ashmore and Geller
2005:90);
11. The variation in offerings by grave or by
cemetery are not substantial, except in the
absolute frequency of quivers of arrow
points in certain cemeteries (see Table 11-4)
north and east of the Lang Pasture site that
date to the latter part of the Frankston phase;
and
12. Certain adult males in upper Neches
River basin Caddo society had a recognized
higher social status in life—achieved
through accomplishments as hunters,
warriors, or diplomats/leaders—that was
reflected in their distinctive treatment at
death. These social identity or leadership
relationships became clearest after ca. A.D.
1560 in the region. Even with their elite
social position, these individuals were
buried with their families and lineages in
family cemeteries, rather than being interred
at a social distance with other social elites
from related farmsteads and communities.
At the Lang Pasture site, Caddo adult men
and women were buried in a spatially
discrete cemetery placed ca. 10-20 m distant
from habitation and outdoor work areas. The
burials of children, on the other hand, were
placed together in a large pit feature that
may have first been used for storage of food
stuffs, until its storage function was
discontinued, at which point three child
burials were placed in it, and then filled in.
As with other upper Neches River basin
Caddo cemeteries, the children had only a
few funerary offerings placed with them,
while the adults had two or three times as
many ceramic vessels; two burials—both
probably adult men—had clay pipes placed
with them at death.

Technical Report No. 174202

The rarity of double burials in upper Neches
River Caddo cemeteries suggests that the
double burial (Feature 93, that of an adult
male and female) at the Lang Pasture site
may represent the interment of notable and
important adult individuals in a Caddo
community that lived in part of the Caddo
Creek basin. Otherwise, the other burials at
the site—including those from both groups
of burials defined here (see Figures 5-4 and
5-48)—appear to have had an equivalent
social position, separated only by age. They
were buried by a living community of
Caddo peoples that shared similar social
beliefs about personal identity and gender,
beliefs about the soul’s nature, the afterlife,
and the soul’s journey to the House of
Death.
End Notes
1. A cemetery is a “place where burials of
isolated individuals are placed with separate
graves relatively soon after death; thus
‘cemetery’ implies primary burials in
individual graves” (Hutchinson and Aragon
2002:42).
2. Based on extensive ethnographic
research, the absolute quantity of funerary
offerings is apparently a less important
reflection of social status of the deceased
than are such characteristics as the internal
organization of cemeteries, the overall
amount of energy expended on a specific
interment (i.e., grave construction), as are
the form of disposition of the body, the
number of different kinds of burial
treatments (i.e., in cemeteries, in mounds, in
shaft tombs, etc.), the number of persons
placed in a grave, and the kinds of funerary
offerings found associated with the deceased
(Carr 1995:Table XXII).

12SUMMARY AND SYNTHESIS
Timothy K. Perttula, with contributions by Robert Cast and Bobby Gonzalez
12.1

SUMMARY STATEMENT, SITE
SETTING, AND ARCHEOLOGICAL
COMPONENTS AT THE LANG
PASTURE SITE

The Lang Pasture site (41AN38) is a multicomponent prehistoric site situated on an
upland ridge and toe slope in the Caney
Branch Creek valley in the upper Neches
River basin, a few miles south of the
community of Frankston, Texas. The
principal prehistoric occupation was by
ancestors of the modern-day Caddo Nation
of Oklahoma some 600 years ago, who
established a permanent domestic settlement
of indeterminate size and complexity (more
than 90% of the site occurs on private land,
and little is known about the archeological
deposits there, see Perttula et al. [2007]). A
household cemetery with ten burials is part
of this prehistoric Caddo settlement.
In modern times, this part of the upper
Neches basin is in the Pineywoods
physiographic
zone
(Diggs
et
al.
2006:Figure 4). The Pineywoods are a
generally well-watered part of East Texas
characterized by an overstory of shortleaf
and loblolly pines and a variety of deciduous
hardwoods (including mast-bearing trees) in
upland settings as well as a diverse
bottomland hardwood community along the
major river and creek drainages. The sandy
loam and loamy fine sand deposits found in
the uplands and creek floodplains would
have been amenable to cultivation by the
Caddo peoples with hand tools, especially
large tracts of land on the west side of the
Caney Branch Creek valley and the fine

Technical Report No. 174202

sandy loam floodplain soils immediately
east of the Lang Pasture site.
The recovered archeological materials found
at the site indicate that this landform was
used only lightly and periodically from the
Middle Archaic (ca. 6000 years ago) until
about A.D. 900, and this is based almost
exclusively on the recovery of a series of
dart and arrow points of a variety of styles,
but little else in the way of identifiable
features or clearly discrete or concentrated
archeological deposits. OSL dating of sand
grains seemed to indicate that the landform
was very slowly aggrading beginning about
8000 years ago, and ending around 900
years ago, but that may be too simplistic.
Abbott (2010 personal communication).
Abbott suggests that “[a]lthough the A-E
sequence containing the cultural sequence
could represent an eolian veneer of
Holocene age, the OSL samples are not
consistent with such an interpretation. The
character and spread of the single-grain
histograms implies that grains were exposed
to light at very different times. The fact that
the age of grains tends to increase with
depth is not a function of progressive burial
as much as a probabilistic function of
sediment mixing.” Radiocarbon dates (from
charred plant materials incorporated in the
fill of various pit features) indicate relatively
ephemeral use (presumably for hunting
purposes and tool refurbishing, as well as
some hot rock cooking, as little in the way
of other associated artifacts or features can
be associated with these earlier remains) of
the Lang Pasture site around cal 1040-840
BC, AD 70-330, and AD 570-1030.

435

Chapter 12: Summary and Synthesis

When the landform was essentially a stable
topographic surface (or whether it had
always been a stable surface for thousands
of years before the Caddo settlement), it was
occupied by a group of Caddo Indians, and
was the location of a permanent settlement
of Caddo peoples from the first quarter of
the 14th century to the early part of the 15th
century A.D. Associated with the domestic
settlement was a small family cemetery of
Caddo peoples that likely resided at the
Lang Pasture site. Both radiocarbon dating
of
non-burial
features
and
thermoluminescence
(TL)
dating
of
decorated ceramic sherds support the
temporal estimate for the duration of the
Caddo occupation, although there are
ambiguities in both series (see discussion in
Chapters 5 and 6, this volume) of absolute
dates. At least one of the nine Caddo burial
features (Feature 8) found in the associated
family cemetery at the site appears to have
been interred shortly after the domestic
occupation ended in the portion of the site
investigated during this project. Otherwise,
the stylistic character of the recovered
ceramic vessels, particularly the engraved
fine wares, from the burial features indicate
that the Lang Pasture burials share stylistic
features with both pre-A.D. 1400 and early
(ca. A.D. 1400-1450) Frankston phase
mortuary ceramics in the upper Neches
River basin. Ceramic sherds recovered from
a midden on another portion of the Lang
Pasture site suggest that domestic activities
in other compounds likely continued into the
16th and 17th centuries (Perttula et al. 2007).
The principal prehistoric Caddo component
in the investigated portion of the Lang
Pasture site included two circular domestic
structures (Structures 1 and 2) each
inhabited by at least one family. The
structures, marked by arcs of post holes,
were built of wood, grass, and thatch, and
were between 6.8 and 9 m in diameter. The
structures were less than 5 m apart. No
entrances were apparent along the portions
of the walls in the project right-of-way, and
thus it is likely that the entrances to both
structures opened to the west to face the

436

remainder of the Caddo community (now on
private property). The two structures are
interpreted, based on spatial proximity and a
broad similarity in the ceramic material
culture found in the excavations, to be part
of a household compound, probably one of
at least several such compounds that may be
preserved at the Lang Pasture site.
Such a compound at Caddo sites in the
Neches-Angelina river basins of East Texas
would have consisted of a series of domestic
structures set around an open courtyard,
with outdoor activity areas and ancillary
facilities. At Lang Pasture, these outdoor
activity areas were marked by pits, smudge
pits, and hearths not far removed to either
the north or east of the domestic structures;
these were also trash disposal areas, based
on the broad scatter of broken ceramic
vessels and pipe sherds in these same areas.
Outdoor storage pits were also found in
these areas. Ancillary facilities include at
least one small (2 x 4 m) arbor or ramada
(i.e., elevated work platform) east of
Structure 1.
There was also an associated Caddo family
household cemetery north and northeast of
Structure 1, but physically distant from it. A
total of nine burial features (including one
feature with two individuals interred in it)
were identified and excavated at the Lang
Pasture site, and they were found in two
distinct groups. Based on the size of the
cemetery, it is unlikely that it was in use for
any substantial period of time by any one
household compound or related group of
households, perhaps no longer than 10-30
years.
One group of burials is composed of adults
(Features 8, 88, and 91-94) and the other,
not far removed from Structure 1, is
composed of children (Features 76B, 76C,
and 76D). The deceased Caddo adults and
children were laid out in extended supine
positions, with their heads either facing west
(adults) or northwest (children) towards the
House of Death and the setting sun, and they
were accompanied by a modicum of

Technical Report No. 174202

Archeological Investigations at the Lang Pasture Site (41AN38) in the Upper Neches River Basin of East Texas
Texas Department of Transportation

funerary offerings (ceramic vessels and
elbow pipes) that would have served as
provisioning on the deceased’s journey. The
mortuary practices evidenced with the Lang
Pasture burials are clearly comparable to the
practices employed by other Caddo
populations that lived in the upper Neches
River basin from ca. the 14th century to the
early 18th century.
12.2

DISCUSSION OF RESEARCH
DESIGN ISSUES

This section discusses the archeological
findings from the Lang Pasture site
archeological,
bioarcheological,
and
paleoenvironmental investigations—as well
as broader findings based on the
incorporation of analyses of a wide variety
of upper Neches River basin Caddo sites
(especially mortuary sites and their
associated funerary objects)—in light of the
research issues and problems developed in
the project research design (see Chapter 4,
this volume). These research issues include:
cultural chronology; paleoenvironmental
conditions and human adaptation; Caddo
settlement
systems
and
households;
subsistence systems; local and extra-local
trade and exchange; the material culture of
the Caddo peoples living at the Lang Pasture
site; mortuary practices; and the health and
diet of the Caddo living at the site and in the
upper Neches River basin.
Cultural Chronology
Establishing the Age of the Occupations
at the Site, and Arriving at a Better
Understanding
of
the
Cultural
Chronology of the Local Region
Several lines of evidence were employed in
establishing the ages of the various
prehistoric occupations at the Lang Pasture
site, including the presumed age of
temporally diagnostic projectile points (e.g.,
Davis 1991; Story 1990; Suhm and Jelks
1962; Turner and Hester 1999), seriation of
Caddo ceramic stylistic motifs and
decorative elements, a series of radiocarbon

Technical Report No. 174202

dates (n=34) on charred plant remains from
features, and 21 TL dates on both fine ware
and utility ware sherds. The preponderance
of the evidence, taken in conjunction with
the kinds of material culture remains found
in association with those features and in
other discrete archeological contexts,
indicates that the principal occupation of the
site was by a prehistoric Caddo group from
the early part of the 14th century A.D. to the
early part of the 15th century A.D. It is likely
that the Caddo occupation lasted less than
that interval, but it is impossible to be more
specific given the 1 and 2 standard deviation
ranges for both the radiocarbon and TL
dates. The earlier uses of the site, as
suggested by the range of identified
projectile points, extended from the Middle
Archaic through the Late Archaic,
Woodland, and early Caddo (ca. 1000-900
years ago) periods, but only as a result of
sporadic use. Nevertheless, it does appear to
be the case that during this broad span of
time prior to the establishment of a
permanent Caddo settlement in the 14th
century A.D., the use of the site was more
common in the Late Archaic and Woodland
periods (ca. 3000 B.C. to A.D. 800).
The stylistic analysis of plain to decorated
sherd ratios, decorative methods, elements,
and motifs on ceramic vessel sherds from
domestic contexts, in combination with the
more detailed consideration of engraved
motifs from fine ware vessels placed as
funerary offerings in graves, led to the initial
conclusion that the Lang Pasture site was
occupied early in the Frankston phase (ca.
A.D.
1350-1450).
More
detailed
considerations of the decorated ceramics, in
combination with radiocarbon and TL dates,
have narrowed the age of the principal
Caddo occupation at the site to the period
from ca. A.D. 1320 to 1400, or shortly
thereafter, with the occupation beginning
prior to the Frankston phase, but ending in
the early part (sub-phase 1) of the Frankston
phase in the southern ceramic/component
area. Moreover, subtle differences in the
decorative character of the sherd assemblage
from the Lang Pasture site resulted in the

437

Chapter 12: Summary and Synthesis

recognition of southern (younger) and
northern (older) ceramic components that
appear to represent temporally sequent
occupations, but occupations where the
northern ceramic component is not
significantly older than the southern ceramic
component/area.
Additional radiocarbon dates on human
remains from other Caddo sites in the upper
Neches River basin pertain to post-A.D.
1400 occupations during Frankston phase
(ca. A.D. 1400-1650) and Allen phase (ca.
A.D. 1650-1800) times. In conjunction with
seriation analysis of more than 620 mortuary
vessels in the region from 35 cemeteries in
this region, the earlier analyses by
Kleinschmidt (1982), and the results of the
radiocarbon analysis, it is possible now to
recognize three temporal sub-phases of the
Frankston phase: Frankston 1 (ca. A.D.
1400-1480), Frankston 2 (ca. A.D. 1480­
1560), and Frankston 3 (ca. A.D. 1560­
1650). The decorative rim motifs identified
on the fine wares in each sub-phase are
distinct—and several local varieties are
recognized in the Lang Pasture mortuary
ceramics that are not well represented at
other Caddo cemeteries in the upper Neches
River
basin—and
have
temporal
implications; five different varieties of the
principal fine ware (Poynor Engraved) have
been defined as part of this study (see Figure
6-63). None of the defined varieties of
Poynor Engraved are present at the Lang
Pasture site, although there are several
distinctive but unnamed (because of their
rarity) regional varieties that are seen at a
few other sites in the basin, but not in the
frequency with which they are present here.
This suggests that the Lang Pasture
cemetery began to be used prior to the onset
of sub-phase 1 of the Frankston phase—
which is in concordance with radiocarbon
dates and the analysis of the domestic
ceramic assemblage—and that several
stylistically unique varieties of Poynor
Engraved began to be made in the upper
Neches sometime prior to A.D. 1400.

Paleoenvironmental Conditions and
Human Adaptations
Establishing the Extent to Which the
Caddo Population at the Lang Pasture
Site and the Surrounding Region Affected
Vegetation Patterns
Pollen Assemblage Zone 3 in Core 1 (see
Albert, Appendix A, this volume), with
calibrated radiocarbon dates that range from
AD 1180-1400, contains 10% ruderals (i.e.,
Ambrosia and Chenopodiaceae) that may
serve as proxies for evidence of humancaused disturbance to the vegetation, such as
land clearing, burning, and tree removals. At
the time of the Caddo occupation at the
Lang Pasture site, the forested overstory was
comprised of pine, oak, and hickory, as it is
in modern times. Given the low levels of
ruderal pollen representation, as well as an
absence of evidence for the substantial use
of cultivated plants by the Caddo until after
that time (as seen in stable isotope analyses
of human remains, see Table 10-22), it
seems probable that the major changes in the
Caddo Creek pollen diagrams reflect local
and regional changes in climate, as well as
the local effects of natural fires (see Albert
2007), not the effects of Caddo agricultural
practices.
Establish If the Agricultural Practices of
the Caddo Degraded the Local and
Regional Environmental Setting
Albert’s analysis of sedimentation rates
from three pollen cores in alluvial deposits
along Caddo Creek (Appendix A, this
volume) indicate that the highest rates of
accumulation (and upland erosion) occur
after 3800 B.P. He also notes from one core
that these rates of alluvial accumulation
actually doubled between cal A.D. 1240­
1340, immediately preceding the onset of
the principal Caddo occupation at the Lang
Pasture site. This change in alluvial
accumulation appears to correlate with longterm paleoenvironmental and climatic
changes, and fluctuating wet and dry cycles

at that time (as well as before and after), in
eastern Texas (see Perttula 2005:Figure 2-4),
not to Caddo-induced environmental
degradation.
The pollen data obtained by Albert does not
support any suggestion that the Caddo
groups living in the upper Neches River
basin had any long-term effect on the
character of the local and regional
environment. A similar pollen study from
the Sabine River basin did not detect any
significant anthropogenic effects of Caddo
land use practices (i.e., land clearance and
firing) until after ca. A.D. 1560 (Albert
2007). Although stable isotope data on
Caddo human remains from the upper
Neches indicate that Caddo groups were
cultivating domesticated plants such as
maize from ca. A.D. 1000, if not earlier, an
intensification of maize production did not
occur until after ca. A.D. 1400, primarily
after the Lang Pasture site was abandoned.
The pollen cores from the Caddo Creek have
preserved pollen that primarily predates ca.
A.D. 1400, so it is not surprising that any
anthropogenic effects of Caddo maize
agricultural practices could not be detected.
Another factor that may be responsible for
the low levels of disturbances that can be
attributed to the Caddo is that Caddo
settlements, and their associated fields, in
the upper Neches were well dispersed and
localized, such that an intensive local and
regional pollen sampling effort would need
to be conducted to identify any evidence of
local
and
regional
environmental
degradation through the course of the near
millennial settlement of the region by Caddo
peoples.
Caddo Settlement Systems and
Households
Establishing the Internal Organization of
the Caddo Settlement, and How It
Differed From Other Dettlements in This
Region or Other Parts of the Caddo Area

Technical Report No. 174202

The archeological exploration of the internal
organization of the 14th to early 15th century
Caddo settlement at the Lang Pasture site
was constrained by the fact that the Texas
Department of Transportation-sponsored
investigations were confined to a narrow
proposed right-of-way (see Figures 1-2 and
5-4) that arbitrarily bisects only a portion of
what is clearly a much larger prehistoric
Caddo site that extends onto private
property; the only information available
about the private-property portion of the site
is that there is a concentrated midden
deposit about 10 m west of the right-of-way
fence (see Perttula et al. 2007). That being
said, the combination of extensive block
excavations at the Lang Pasture site, in
conjunction with machine-aided scraping, of
the intact archeological deposits on the
upland landform, clearly defined the internal
organization of the prehistoric Caddo
component on one portion of the site.
The Caddo settlement at the Lang Pasture
site includes portions of two circular
structures (Structures 1 and 2), probably not
contemporaneous based on recovered
decorated ceramics (see Chapter 6, this
volume), that would have been occupied by
one or more families. Associated with each
of these structures were outdoor activity
areas to one side of the structures (on the
side away from the structure entrances?) that
were marked by: (1) pits and other features
where plants and animal foods were
processed and cooked, stone tools were
manufactured and resharpened, and pottery
vessels were in use and were being cached,
as well as (2) concentrations of broken
artifacts. Several of the pits are of
considerable size and depth, and may have
been used initially for below-ground storage
of food stuffs (likely plant foods such as
hickory nutshells and corn) before they were
filled with trash at the time of their
abandonment. There is a pattern of post
holes about 2 x 4 m in size to one side of the
northern structure, amidst an outdoor
work/activity area (Structure 3, see Figure 5­
49) that is suggested to represent a small

439

Chapter 12: Summary and Synthesis

arbor or ramada (i.e., elevated work
platform).
In addition to these domestic features, the
final aspect of the Caddo settlement at the
Lang Pasture site is two groups of burials.
The first group, all children, was buried in a
large pit feature (Feature 76) that is
apparently associated with the northernmost
domestic structure (Structure 1). The adults
that lived in this portion of the site were
buried in a small cemetery about 10-17 m
north of Structure 1 (see Figure 5-4),
between the domestic compound and the
Caney Branch valley. The small size of the
cemetery suggests that the Caddo
occupation in this portion of the site was not
lengthy or intensive. A population of 20
adults and children living at the site for ca.
40 years, and having a moderate annual
death rate (1-3%) could have had this many
deaths.
Although only an apparently small portion
of the prehistoric Caddo settlement at the
Lang Pasture site has been examined in
detail, the arrangement of domestic
structures, outdoor work/activity areas and
elevated work platform, the presence of a
trash midden, and a family or household
cemetery (see Figure 5-49), is quite
reminiscent of the layout of the few
prehistoric and early historic Caddo
households that have been examined in any
detail (through archeological investigations
and/or archaeo-geophysical studies) in rural
community settings in the Neches and
Angelina river basin in East Texas. This
includes household settlements at sites such
as Deshazo (41NA27) (Story 1995:239 and
Figure 82), J. T. King (41NA15, Walker
2009), Tallow Grove (41NA231, Perttula
2008b:Figure 5-29), and Beech Ridge
(41NA242, Perttula 2008b:Figure 5-49). The
Deshazo site investigations are the best
known with respect to intra-site settlement
organization because of the extensive
excavations conducted there over the
entirety of the site area, but the basic pattern
is clear: two concentrations of circular
domestic structures at the northern and

440

southern ends of the site, with an open
courtyard between them; a dense midden set
to one side and somewhat removed spatially
from the domestic structures; ramadas or
storage racks to one side of the
concentration of structures; outdoor hearths
(in likely outdoor work/activity areas); and a
cemetery for the burial of adults living at the
site that is removed from the area of
domestic activities of the households living
there. The impression we have gained from
the archeological investigations at the Lang
Pasture site and other contemporaneous and
later Caddo settlements is that rural Caddo
households dating from ca. the 14th century
A.D. to the early 18th century A.D. did not
differ substantially from one another with
respect to how they were arranged for
domestic, outdoor, trash disposal, and
mortuary activities, suggesting they were
occupied by the same kind and size of
households.
Were There Changes Through Time in
the Organization of the Settlement?
If we examine the long-term use of the Lang
Pasture site, not just the principal prehistoric
14th to early 15th century A.D. Caddo
settlement, the one fundamental change in
the use of the site was from a very transitory
occupation during Early Archaic, Middle
Archaic, Late Archaic, and Woodland times
(as based almost exclusively on temporally
diagnostic projectile points, in conjunction
with radiocarbon dates on charred plant
remains that were incorporated in the fill of
Caddo pit features) to the establishment of a
sedentary household of two or more Caddo
families beginning in the early part of the
14th century A.D. Given the vagaries of
radiocarbon and TL dating (and the 2-sigma
standard deviations of these absolute dates),
this Caddo occupation in this one
investigated portion of the Lang Pasture site
probably did not last more than one or two
generations.
Subtle differences in the decorative style of
fine-ware and utility-ware ceramics at the
Lang Pasture site, as well as radiocarbon and

Technical Report No. 174202

Archeological Investigations at the Lang Pasture Site (41AN38) in the Upper Neches River Basin of East Texas
Texas Department of Transportation

TL dates from Caddo features (both
domestic and mortuary), suggest that the
two domestic structures may not have been
contemporaneous, but sequent. Structure 1
(at the northern end of the domestic
compound preserved in the project right-of­
way) appears to have been the earlier of the
two structures, with Structure 2 (at the
southern end of the project right-of-way)
being slightly younger in age. Despite this
apparent non-contemporaneity, there are no
significant differences in the character and
spatial layout of the domestic features
associated with these two different
occupational episodes. Indeed, the Caddo
occupants of both structures apparently
continued to use the one household cemetery
for the interment of deceased adults that
lived in Structures 1 and 2.

notion that maize was a relatively important
part of the diet of these Caddo peoples
during the early 14th to mid-15th centuries
A.D., although it became more important in
Late and Historic Caddo times (Wilson
2008c). The stable carbon (on bone
collagen) isotope values from the Lang
Pasture site range from -21.0o/oo to
-15.2o/oo , with a site average of -18.1o/oo to
-17.6o/oo. These average stable carbon
isotope values indicate that maize comprised
between 28-31% (see the mass balance
equations in Schoeninger and Schurr
[1998:127]) of the diet of the Lang Pasture
Caddo population.

Subsistence Systems

The available subsistence evidence from the
Lang Pasture site indicates that the Caddo
group living there relied on a generalized
subsistence strategy that was based on a
broad-spectrum collection of hickory nuts
for the preparation of hickory nut oil, oak
mast, the cultivation of maize in local fields,
the procurement of a variety of wild
animals, including medium-sized prey (deer)
and turtle, and undoubtedly other seasonal
resources such as seeds, roots/tubers, and
greens. The consumption of maize was
important, but it was not the mainstay of the
Caddo diet here, or in much of the rest of the
Caddo area at the time (i.e., ca. A.D. 1320­
1400) (Perttula 2008a; Wilson 2008c). Other
cultigens that the Caddo grew included
beans and bottle gourd, as well as various
starchy and oily seeds, but these cultigens
are not present in the Lang Pasture
paleobotanical remains; poor preservation
probably is a principal contributing factor in
the absence of beans and most seeds.

Establishing the Importance of PlantFood Production in Caddo Subsistence
Strategies at the Site
The paleobotanical study of the preserved
plant remains from flotation samples and
macrobotanical samples recovered from
features at the Lang Pasture site (see
Chapter 8, this volume) indicate that the use
of maize was widespread at the site; maize
was the principal cultigen, although a
domesticated squash was also cultivated. In
terms of its ubiquity, maize (probably
primarily 8-10 rowed cobs) was present in
42% of the flotation samples (see Table 8­
1).
The cultivation of maize, as well as squash,
and the collection of hickory nuts and the
preparation of hickory nut oil, were the main
plant production and processing activities at
the Lang Pasture site. As the Caddo
occupation here appears to have been a
permanent one, the paleobotanical record
was left by a Caddo group that was
moderately invested in agriculture. The
stable carbon isotope values from a number
of the burial features at the Lang Pasture site
(see Chapter 10, this volume) support the

Technical Report No. 174202

How Did Subsistence Strategies Here
Compare to Contemporary Sites in the
Region or Other Caddo Regions?

In terms of the ubiquity of maize in East
Texas Caddo assemblages, ubiquity values
of 42% (as at Lang Pasture) or higher have
been documented only in post-A.D. 1300
assemblages in the Red River basin; postA.D. 1000 Caddo sites in the middle and
upper reaches of the Sabine River basin; and

441

Chapter 12: Summary and Synthesis

post-A.D. 1400 Titus phase sites in the Big
Cypress Creek basin and Frankston phase
sites in the Neches-Angelina River basin
(see Table 8-5). Outside of East Texas, it
does appear to be the case that the use of
maize was more intensive in the eastern part
of the Caddo area, namely in the Ouachita
and Red River basins, as well as the
Arkansas River basin, and that Caddo
subsistence strategies had become more
specialized. This finding is based on
ubiquity measures (Perttula 2008a:Table 3).
Caddo sites in the Red and Ouachita river
basins in Arkansas and northwestern
Louisiana dating after ca. A.D. 1200 have
maize ubiquity measures that range from 40­
94% (see Perttula 2008a:Table 3). After ca.
A.D. 1400, those measures actually range
from 58-94%, all considerably higher than
what has been documented to date from
northeastern Texas Caddo sites.
The stable carbon isotope information from
sites in the southern Caddo area indicates
that around A.D. 1100-1200, there was a
significant increase in the consumption of
maize in the Ouachita River basin (i.e.,
maize contributed an estimated 60% of the
diet in the Caddo population at the Ferguson
site [Rose et al. 1998:Table 6-2), as marked
by C4-enriched samples at that time. Later
Caddo samples in southwest Arkansas and
northwest Louisiana sites leveled out and
reached a measure of stasis after ca. AD
1250-1300 (Perttula 2008a:Figure 6);
isotope values indicate that the contribution
of maize to the diet may have been less in
East Texas at that time.
In the upper Neches River basin, however,
isotopic values after the 14th century suggest
that the importance of maize continued to
increase in the Caddo diet (Wilson 2008c),
peaking at ca. A.D. 1650 (during the Allen
phase), and the consumption of maize in the
diet of the East Texas Caddo was quite
comparable to other Caddo groups in the
larger Caddo area. Mean LateCaddo stable
isotope values in the upper Neches basin
(-14.38o/oo) are not significantly different
from Late Caddo contexts at the Belcher

442

Mound on the Red River (-15.88o/oo, see
Rose et al. 1998:Table 6-2)—perhaps
representing only a 10% difference in maize
consumption in the diets of these two
populations. Farther afield, in the Arkansas
River valley of eastern Oklahoma, there was
a more gradual increase in the consumption
of maize through time (as well as the
consumption of bison meat), with the most
enriched samples dating after ca. A.D. 1250­
1450 (Rogers 1997) and peaking during the
Late Caddo Fort Coffee phase. By the late
17th century, Caddo diets, as measured by
stable carbon isotope data from analyzed
human remains, are apparently quite
homogeneous and reflect a subsistence
strategy based on the production and
consumption of maize: mean stable carbon
isotope values in the upper Neches river
basin are -13.74o/oo (see Table 10-22),
while two populations from the Red River in
southwest Arkansas and northwestern
Louisiana have mean values of -14.11o/oo
and -13.97o/oo, respectively (Rose et al.
1998:Table 6-2; Tine and Tieszen
1997:Table 43). These values indicate that
after ca. A.D. 1650, maize contributed
approximately 56-59% of the diet of these
Caddo populations.
Local and Extra-Local Trade and
Exchange
Establishing What Goods Were Obtained
Through Trade, and How That Trade
Was Organized
The instrumental neutron activation analysis
(INAA) of a large sample of ceramic sherds
from the Lang Pasture site and other
generally contemporaneous Caddo sites in
the upper Neches River basin indicates that
the vast majority of ceramic vessels made
and used on Caddo sites were produced at
the local household and community level
and used and distributed on those same local
sites. There is no evidence discernible in the
INAA database for the specialized
production of ceramic vessels, or a
concomitant, directed trade and exchange of
specific kinds of ceramic vessels within the

Technical Report No. 174202

Archeological Investigations at the Lang Pasture Site (41AN38) in the Upper Neches River Basin of East Texas
Texas Department of Transportation

upper Neches River basin or other parts of
the Caddo area.
The INAA analysis did identify one
chemically distinctive set of ceramic sherds
(8.8% of the analyzed sherds, including both
utility ware and fine ware sherds) that may
have been made from clays that occur in a
localized area east and northeast of the Lang
Pasture site, principally on the east side of
the Neches River. It does appear that these
sherds are from vessels made by Caddo
potters living on the other side of the river
from Lang Pasture, who then traded or
exchanged pottery vessels with the Caddo
groups living at Lang Pasture. These INAA
data are the best current ceramic evidence
for intra-regional exchange of material
goods between Caddo households and
communities.
Different lithic raw materials in the chipped
and ground stone tools at the Lang Pasture
site attest to the Caddo very occasionally
obtaining, most likely through through trade
or exchange rather than logistical/embedded
acquisition, completed tools made from nonlocal raw material sources. In the principal
Caddo occupation, this principally includes
novaculite arrow points (n=2) from either
materials available in Red River gravels or
Ouachita Mountains sources in southeastern
Oklahoma (cf. Banks 1990), as well as a
ground stone celt from the same non-local
source areas more than 100 miles to the
north of the Lang Pasture site. Novaculite is
also present in lithic debris samples from
Caddo features (11%), suggesting that
novaculite tools were resharpened and
maintained during the occupation. Another
completed tool (a four-beveled knife) from
this component was made on a large piece of
Edwards cherts from Central Texas sources.
The rarity of chipped and ground stone tools
on non-local lithic raw materials indicates
that the Caddo tool makers at the site relied
on more accessible and locally available
resources for tool manufacture, rather than
having to trade for suitable materials, since
these few non-local raw materials were
apparently derived from completed tools,

Technical Report No. 174202

not from cores and bifaces brought to the
site for reduction. The local materials were
probably collected from Neches River
gravel sources (Perttula and Nelson
2007:105). Central Texas pebbles and
cobbles that were incorporated in Uvalde
gravel sources in the Brazos and Trinity
River drainages more than 30 miles to the
west to the west were apparently also
exploited for lithic raw materials suitable for
tool manufacture. These include a wide
variety of high-quality cherts, among them
Pisgah chert from Trinity River sources (see
Banks 1990; McGregor 1993), and the
Caddo groups living at Lang Pasture may
well have directly procured these raw
materials or obtained them from related
Caddo communities living between the
Neches and Trinity River valleys in
exchange for other material goods. The
latter scenario seems the most likely given
the high frequency of chert flakes in the
lithic debris (51% in flotation samples and
65% in hand-excavated samples) from
analyzed features (see Chapter 7, this
volume). Lithic debris samples from a
nearby late 17th to early 18th century Allen
phase Caddo sites in the upper Neches River
basin had even higher proportions of chert
raw materials (74%) (see Perttula and
Nelson 2007:Table 19), suggesting this
pattern of lithic raw material exchange
continued unabated well after the Lang
Pasture site was abandoned. In the case of
the late 17th-early 18th century Caddo
groups, they may have had the horse, and
thus could have directly obtained needed
lithic raw materials during long-distance
deer/fur trade trips into the Trinity River
valley. The 15th century Caddo living in the
upper Neches seem more provincial with
respect to longer-distance forays from
sedentary farms and villages.

Chapter 12: Summary and Synthesis

Material Culture of the Caddo Peoples
Living at the Lang Pasture site
Establishing the Temporal, Cultural, or
Functional Variability in the Ceramic
Assemblages in the Region
The analysis of the ceramics from the Lang
Pasture site, as well as sherds and vessels
from a number of other broadly
contemporaneous and younger Caddo sites
in the upper Neches River basin, has
considerably refined our understanding of
the temporal, cultural, and functional
character of prehistoric Caddo ceramic
assemblages in the region. These sites are
part of a culturally recognizable cultural
tradition confined to the upper Neches (see
Figure 6-70). Crucial to understanding the
temporal and cultural development of this
ceramic tradition is the detailed stylistic and
technological information that has been
obtained from Caddo cemetery sites with
mortuary vessels that were used for short
periods of time within a ca. 380 year
chronological sequence (ca. A.D. 1320­
1700), as supported by a large suite of
radiocarbon and TL dates from Lang Pasture
and other Caddo sites in the upper Neches
area (see Chapter 5, this volume, and
Feathers, Appendix C, this volume). Also
important to anchoring the beginnings of
this ceramic tradition, and laying the
framework for tracing subsequent stylistic
changes in the ceramic fine wares in the
region, is the fact that the Lang Pasture site
appears to be the earliest of the known sites
within this tradition.
Building on the seriation of mortuary vessels
proposed by Kleinschmidt (1982), the
ceramic analysis of the mortuary vessels
focused on the engraved rim motifs on the
many Poynor Engraved vessels found in
upper Neches River basin Caddo cemeteries,
primarily because of the stylistic diversity of
this type and its overall abundance in
mortuary contexts. More than 30 distinctive
Poynor Engraved rim stylistic motifs have
now been recognized (see Figures 6-63 and
6-64) in the region—including several from

444

the Lang Pasture site that may be amongst
the earliest motifs seen on this fine ware—
but five new varieties represent more than
73% of the documented Poynor Engraved
vessels in the upper Neches River basin.
These include varieties Blackburn, Cook,
Freeman, Hood, and Lang; var. Hood is the
most common in the upper Neches River
vessel sample (29.3% of the vessels),
followed by Poynor Engraved, var. Cook
(15.7%), var. Blackburn (12.6%), var.
Freeman (9.1%), and var. Lang (6.6%). The
frequency seriation of these different
decorative motifs on Poynor Engraved
vessels from seven nearby prehistoric Caddo
cemeteries—the Mrs. J. M. Cook (41AN1),
J. M. Cook (41AN2), Fred McKee
(41AN32), J. W. Blackburn (41CE4), Omer
and Otis Hood, cemeteries #1 and #2
(41CE14), E. W Henry (41CE17), and R. J.
Fair (41CE25) sites—indicates that the
earliest varieties are var. Cook, var.
Blackburn, and var. Hood, as well as
regional varieties A-B, F, I-L, and S. Most
of these regional varieties are found only in
pre-A.D. 1480 contexts.
None of the
defined varieties of Poynor Engraved are
present at the Lang Pasture site, but regional
varieties B, F, and K are, although in higher
proportions here compared to the other
cemeteries. These differing proportions, and
the absence of the defined varieties, suggests
that the Lang Pasture cemetery—or at least
some significant portion of it—predates the
onset of the Frankston phase at ca. A.D.
1400, and that a number of more stylistically
unique varieties of Poynor Engraved had
begun to be made in the upper Neches
sometime prior to ca. A. D. 1400.
Two of the early varieties of Poynor
Engraved (var. F and J) continued to be
made between ca. A.D. 1480-1560, but in
lesser amounts. Instead, a number of other
regional varieties of Poynor Engraved make
their appearance at this time, namely var. C­
E, Q, and R. Four of these regional stylistic
varieties of Poynor Engraved were made
only during this temporal interval, but var. E
became more common in later (ca. A.D.
1560-1650) Frankston phase burials.

Technical Report No. 174202

Archeological Investigations at the Lang Pasture Site (41AN38) in the Upper Neches River Basin of East Texas
Texas Department of Transportation

Among the defined varieties of Poynor
Engraved, a new variety (var. Lang) makes
its first and only appearance in ca. A.D.
1480-1560 burials. Var. Hood, Cook, and
Blackburn comprise 75.8% of the ca. A.D.
1480-1560 Poynor Engraved vessels (but
only 38.9% of the ca. A.D. 1400-1480
Poynor Engraved vessels). Each variety
increased monotonically in proportion
during ca. A.D. 1400-1480 to ca. A.D. 1480­
1560 intervals, and then decreased in
frequency in ca. A.D. 1560-1650 burials.
Poynor Engraved, var. Freeman appears to
be the latest variety of the Poynor Engraved
type in the upper Neches, as it makes its
appearance between ca. A.D. 1560-1650, the
latter part of the Frankston phase, where it is
the dominant defined variety. Regional
varieties N, P, and T are also present in low
proportions only in ca. A.D. 1560-1650
burials. Var. Freeman appears to have
developed from the earlier Poynor
Engraved, var. Hood, because they both
have hour glass-shaped panel dividers and
none of the other varieties do. What
separates var. Hood from var. Freeman are
the pendant triangles on the upper and lower
parts of the engraved rim panel of the latter.
In the case of Poynor Engraved, var.
Freeman, a simple stylistic decision to add
concentric circles and hooked arm elements
on the body of carinated bowls, and then the
addition of tick marks to concentric circles
on the vessel body, suggests a clear and not
temporally lengthy stylistic link between
Poynor Engraved, var. Freeman and Patton
Engraved, var. Freeman, and an obvious
stylistic and cultural connection between
Caddo peoples and potters that archeologists
call the Frankston and Allen phases. This
stylistic relationship of concentric circle and
hooked arm elements on vessel bodies,
embellished by the later addition of ticks on
those elements, further suggests that Patton
Engraved, var. Freeman is the earliest of the
defined Patton Engraved varieties. These
stylistic changes took place long after the
Lang Pasture site was abandoned.

Technical Report No. 174202

Hood Engraved, var. Hood and var. Cook
are the earliest effigy vessel forms in the
upper Neches. Hood Engraved, var. Allen is
found in association with Patton Engraved,
and is apparently part of Allen phase
ceramic assemblages, although one burial at
the Frankston phase Mrs. J. M. Cook site
(41AN1) had one of these vessels. This
effigy vessel form includes zoomorphic or
anthropomorphic tail riders. The other
varieties of Hood Engraved have effigy
heads and tab tails, as well as horizontal
engraved lines as the main rim/body
decoration, with var. Cook also having
engraved pendant triangle elements, and all
are found in Frankston phase temporal
contexts. Hume Engraved, var. Allen and
var. Hume, are found primarily in Allen
phase contexts or later (i.e., dating after ca.
A.D. 1480) Frankston phase contexts.
Hume Engraved bottles are absent from
earlier Caddo burials in the upper Neches,
and no Hume Engraved vessels were in any
of the Lang Pasture burials.
The culinary tradition in use at the Lang
Pasture site and all other post-A.D. 1300
Caddo sites in the upper Neches River basin
was one designed to effectively deal with
the processing and cooking of maize, in
particular, with other sundry supplements
(i.e., beans, deer meat, nut meat and oil) and
condiments. Because the vessels from the
Lang Pasture site are hollow wares (i.e., jars,
bowls, and carinated bowls), and the other
studied sites have the same range of vessel
forms, it apparently is the case that the
Caddo diet was based almost entirely on
liquid-based foods boiled and cooked in jars,
including stews, corn and bean dishes, and
gruels, as well as the serving and drinking of
liquids. It is suspected that Caddo culinary
traditions in general were primarily
domestic in scale rather than community or
communal-based, because of the small to
medium size of many of the vessels,
although the size of some cooking and
serving vessels found in mortuary contexts
suggests that communal food practices were
also important at certain times in upper
Neches River basin Caddo society.

Chapter 12: Summary and Synthesis

Poynor Engraved is by far the most common
fine ware type in the upper Neches River
basin, in both domestic and mortuary
contexts. Its most distinctive and unifying
characteristic is the use of rim panels on
carinated bowls—or a rim panel decoration
turned vertically on bottles—that have
distinctive dividers, creating central
rectangular, oval, negative-oval, and semi­
circular elements. In some cases, there are
additional decorative elements within the
area created by the dividers, including
hatched triangles, pendant triangles, circles,
punctate-filled circles, or circles with spurs
or ticks. The five newly defined varieties of
Poynor Engraved are found at most of the
sites in the upper Neches, as well as in sherd
assemblages from domestic and mound
components. Poynor Engraved, var. Hood
is the most widespread of the defined
varieties, followed by Poynor Engraved, var.
Blackburn. Poynor Engraved, var. Lang is
the least widespread of the defined varieties.
The other varieties are Poynor Engraved,
var. Cook and var. Freeman. The analysis of
these varieties of Poynor Engraved, in
combination with the examination of the
later
Patton
Engraved
type,
has
demonstrated
the
unbroken
stylistic
connection between the latest variety of
Poynor Engraved—var. Freeman—and the
earliest of the distinctive Patton Engraved
vessels, namely Patton Engraved, var.
Freeman, as well as the earlier stylistic
change from Poynor Engraved, var. Hood to
var. Freeman.
The earliest site that belongs to this
tradition—the Lang Pasture site—has none
of these defined Poynor Engraved varieties.
There are a number of unnamed regional
varieties of Poynor Engraved we have
recognized, some of which are present in the
earliest contexts at sites throughout the
upper Neches River basin and in widespread
14th century contexts in adjacent parts of
East Texas. These varieties also feature a
diverse range and combination of stylistic
elements, principal among them are nested
triangles, nested ovals, and nested circles;
scrolls of various sorts; hatched pendant,

446

stacked, and nested triangles; cross-hatched
ladders and panels; hooked arms; concentric
ovals; and sets of diagonal lines with small
pendant triangles. The most common
regional varieties of Poynor Engraved are
var. F (nested ovals/triangles and diagonal
cross-hatched ladders), var. E (scroll and
circle), and var. B (interlocking scrolls).
More than 57% of the Poynor Engraved
vessels at the Lang Pasture site can be
assigned to one of these regional varieties;
the other 43% are specific local varieties of
Poynor Engraved seen only at Lang Pasture
and currently at one or two other sites in the
region. In the broader upper Neches River
basin mortuary vessel assemblages, these
numerous regional varieties are most
abundant in pre-A.D. 1480 contexts, with a
significant drop off in ca. A.D. 1480-1560
and ca. A.D. 1560-1650 mortuary contexts.
This suggests that prior to A.D. 1480, and
reaching back into the early to mid-14th
century A.D. when the Lang Pasture site
was occupied and distinctive regionally
specific fine ware styles were beginning to
be created, the favoring of stylistic
innovations and the individual work of
specific artisans were what led to the wide
diversity or variety in Poynor Engraved rim
motif styles at that time.
Innovations and unique artistic expressions
with Poynor Engraved vessels eventually
began to diminish in favor of stylistic
conformity around a certain few rim panel
motifs. This uniformity suggests that fewer
people were making pottery, and after ca.
A.D. 1480, specific distinct styles/varieties
of Poynor Engraved may not have been
made in each Caddo settlement or
community. Instead, each style of Poynor
Engraved may have made by a certain
number of artisans living in specific parts of
the upper Neches River basin, and the
products were then traded and exchanged
throughout the region.
Other important fine wares include Hume
Engraved and Patton Engraved, with several
defined varieties in the upper Neches, as
well as Hood Engraved effigy vessels.

Seriation analysis of mortuary vessels
suggest that neither of the first two pottery
types began to be made until after ca. A.D.
1480 (in the case of Hume Engraved) or
after ca. A.D. 1560 (in the case of Patton
Engraved). Hood Engraved effigy vessels
began to be made ca. A.D. 1400, and they
were most popular as mortuary offerings
between ca. A.D. 1400-1480, although they
were made and used through the Allen
phase. There are three known varieties, with
Hood Engraved, var. Hood being the most
common effigy vessel style.
Hood
Engraved, var. Hood vessels occur in burial
and domestic contexts at a number of sites.
Hood Engraved, var. Allen effigy vessels,
however, are more concentrated in late
Frankston and Allen phase settlements and
cemeteries in the Caddo and Flat Creek
areas and in the Neches River valley itself.
Important utility wares include Bullard
Brushed, as well as Maydelle Incised, rim
punctated jars, and Killough Pinched noded
bowls and jars, the latter including
exuberant examples with pedestal bases and
pinched legs.
Plain vessels were an
important part of this ceramic tradition
through time, and in addition to simple
bowls, other plain wares were made in the
same shape as some of the distinctive fine
wares, as in the globular carinated bowl
form (Poynor Plain) or the elongated body­
short-necked bottle form (Hume Plain).
The decorated and plain sherd assemblages
from post-A.D. 1400 domestic sites in the
upper Neches (e.g., Anderson et al. 1974)
are dominated by brushed utility ware
pottery from Bullard Brushed vessels and
other brushed utility ware types. Wet paste
decorations on sherds from Maydelle
Incised vessels and various unnamed utility
wares are also a distinctive part of the utility
wares in the region. Fine-ware vessel sherds
are from Poynor Engraved and Hood
Engraved vessels, and they are relatively
rare (comprising less than 10% of the
decorated sherds at the Lake Palestine sites).
Plain to decorated sherd ratios for these
assemblages range from only 0.14-1.50,

Technical Report No. 174202

with most of the sites having values of less
than 0.72. Lake Palestine Caddo sites dating
after ca. A.D. 1400 did not have many plain
ware vessels.
Establishing the Stylistic, Technological,
and Functional Character of the Artifact
Assemblage on a Caddo Residential
Settlement
Sherds from early 14th to early 15th century
domestic contexts at the Lang Pasture site
are from plain wares (including carinated
bowls, bowls, and bottles), fine wares (i.e.,
the engraved and red-slipped vessels,
including carinated bowls and bottles) and
utility wares (i.e., the coarse-paste decorated
vessels), usually cooking or storage jars and
simple bowls. These wares are known to
have been made and used differently, based
on functional, technological, and stylistic
analyses on numerous Caddo sherd
assemblages in the broader East Texas
region, with uses ranging from food service,
cooking of foodstuffs, containers for liquids,
and storage of plant food/seed crops. The
ubiquity of these wares in every part of the
site indicates that they were available to all
the Caddo that lived there, and that there
was no restricted access to the use of fine
wares. These same wares are also found in
the mortuary vessel assemblage at the Lang
Pasture site, but in very different
proportions, with an increased emphasis on
fine wares as one of the principal funerary
offerings.
The decorative style of the fine and utility
wares in the northern (presumed to be the
earliest Caddo occupational episode) and
southern (the presumptive later occupational
episode) areas at the Lang Pasture site share
many similar decorative elements and
stylistic motifs, and in a number of cases,
these elements and motifs occur in roughly
similar proportions. This suggests that these
wares are part of the same ceramic stylistic
tradition of the same Caddo social group;
furthermore, they may not be separated
much in time. That they share many
decorative elements, but in slightly different

447

Chapter 12: Summary and Synthesis

proportions, presumably represents evidence
of subtle stylistic changes over time effected
by Caddo potters in how utility ware and
fine ware were to be decorated, as well as
the particular styles preferred by the Lang
Pasture community. Overall, almost 48% of
the rims in the ceramic assemblage are from
utility wares, another 31% are from plain
wares, and the remaining 22% are fine wares
(engraved carinated bowls, bottles, and
some bowl forms).
Jars with horizontally brushed rims are
particularly abundant in the utility wares,
followed by vessels with rim decorations
consisting of tool-punctated rows, horizontal
brushed-tool punctations (with the punctates
pushed through the brushing), and triangle
incised zones filled with tool punctations.
The only significant difference in the
brushed sherds from the southern and
northern areas at the Lang Pasture site is the
absolute proportions of brushed sherds in the
utility wares: 26% in the northern area and
64% in the southern area. Clearly, the period
after ca. A.D. 1320-1400 and in much of the
15th century A.D. is one in which Caddo
potters in the upper Neches River basin
began to manufacture considerable numbers
of jars with brushed vessel bodies and rims.
This one change in the manufacture and use
of one kind of utility ware—the brushed
cooking jar —led to considerable reductions
in previously important kinds of decorated
utility wares and, with time, a different
character to the overall utility ware
assemblage, even as the elements of
decoration remained consistently in use:
incised (parallel, diagonal, opposed, and
cross-hatched elements), incised-punctated
(straight/parallel incised lines framing tool
punctated rows or zones), and punctated
(tool and fingernail punctated rows). In the
northern
ceramic-component/area,
the
incised, punctated, and incised-punctated
vessel sherds account for 49% of all the
decorated sherds, whereas in the southern
ceramic component/area, that percentage has
decreased to only 25 percent.

448

Fine wares, especially engraved bottles, are
more common in the northern site
component/area at the Lang Pasture site.
Decorative elements on bottles shared in
both site areas included sets of curvilinear
lines and triangular elements, usually in
combination with hatched areas, either
triangular, circular, or oval-shaped. Many of
these bottle sherds are from globular Poynor
Engraved bottles rather than the elongated
bottle form, as long vertical decorative
motifs that occur on these elongated forms
(as they do on Hume Engraved bottles) were
not clearly identified in the Lang Pasture
bottle sherds.
The sets of decorative elements in the
engraved fine-ware carinated bowls and
bowls from both site areas are found on
Poynor Engraved vessels in the upper
Neches River basin, many with hatched
triangles of various sizes appended to larger
motifs on rim panels. The decorations on
these engraved vessels feature—either in a
singular fashion or in combination—
triangular, oval, or circular motifs on rim
panels filled in with closely to widelyspaced hatching or cross-hatched lines,
usually with appended hatched triangles.
Horizontal engraved sherds in the southern
area may be from Hood Engraved effigy
vessels, although no effigy heads were
recovered at the Lang Pasture site. Lipnotched, engraved-lip-notched, and redslipped fine ware sherds, although rare,
represent other distinctive stylistic practices
used in the decoration of the northern area
fine-ware assemblage.
Clays used for vessel manufacture at the
Lang Pasture site were likely gathered from
nearby alluvial settings, as suggested by
instrumental neutron activation analysis,
particularly the more easily processed
alluvial clay bodies along Caddo Creek, but
certainly within a short (1-7 km away, at
most) distance from the settlement. Grog,
burned and crushed bone, and crushed
hematite are the significant tempers used in
the locally produced ceramics at the Lang
Pasture site. The predominant practice of

Technical Report No. 174202

Archeological Investigations at the Lang Pasture Site (41AN38) in the Upper Neches River Basin of East Texas
Texas Department of Transportation

Caddo potters at the site, as at other upper
Neches River Caddo sites, was in making
grog-tempered plain ware, utility ware, and
fine ware pottery in both areas and through
time. The principal technique used in the
manufacture of Lang Pasture and other
upper Neches River basin ceramics was the
building of vessels using coils, beginning at
the flat base and working up the vessel
body. Using the coiling method, coils of
clay, in the form of ropes, rolls, or fillets,
were built up to create the desired size and
height of the vessel.
The sample of rim sherds from the
excavated area at the Lang Pasture site
(n=456), almost all of which appear to be
from separate vessels, suggests that there
may have been thousands of vessels used by
the Caddo during their occupation of the
entire site, given the apparent size of the site
relative to the proportion that was
excavated. With a duration of occupation
that may lasted no more than ca. 80 years in
the area excavated for this project, the
number of vessels used by each household
during the course of occupation was
substantial, perhaps 20-30 vessels at any one
time, with different functions, sizes,
volumes, and use-lives. Based on the
number of rims from the three different
pottery wares found in domestic contexts,
the vessels in use were dominated by
decorated utility wares, typically jars used
for cooking and/or storage activities, and
plain wares, generally simple bowls used for
food serving along with the fine wares. The
rim and lip form data from the southern and
northern ceramic component/areas indicate
that the same range of forms were used by
potters in both areas: carinated bowls,
bottles, bowls, and jars. These were forms
that were considered appropriate by the
Caddo for the kinds of vessels being made
and used in each area. The particular shape
and form of these vessels is a hallmark of
the technology and style of Caddo pottery
vessels in the upper Neches, and these
shapes and forms would have been
immediately recognizable to other Caddo as

Technical Report No. 174202

belonging to those of a particular social
group.
Vessel orifice data suggest that the Caddo
living in the northern area at the Lang
Pasture site made pottery designed for use in
cooking and food serving in small social
groups, perhaps individual households, and
only occasionally were foods prepared and
served for larger (i.e., more than 10
individuals) groups of people. Later in time,
larger vessels used for food service (fine
wares), cooking (utility wares), and storage
(utility wares) were more frequently
produced and used at the site. In the
southern area of the site, then, the ceramics
produced and used by the Caddo were
apparently made with the presumption that
food preparation and serving needs extended
to both household and supra-household
contexts.
Utility-ware, plain-ware, and fine-ware
vessels were fired differently from each
other. Fine ware and plain wares were better
made and better fired (at least in terms of
regulating the firing temperature), and they
were probably fired longer in a low oxygen
environment than the utility wares. The
Caddo potters exerted more control over the
end product of fine ware and plain ware
vessel manufacture than they did with the
utility wares, primarily to produce a harder
ceramic. Firing conditions tended to be more
heterogeneous among the utility wares,
likely the product of the multi-purpose
nature of these vessel forms, as they were
used as cooking pots and storage containers.
The manufacture and use of clay pipes is a
distinctive feature of the artifact assemblage
at the Lang Pasture site: there were two
pipes from mortuary contexts and sherds
from at least 10 other pipes that were found
in the domestic areas. Pipes were probably
smoked on a daily basis by adult members
of farmsteads and communities—mainly by
adult males—and when the pipes broke,
they were discarded in nearby middens.
Pipes were made locally for daily use, and
for use in mortuary rituals. The pipes and

449

Chapter 12: Summary and Synthesis

pipe sherds are from elbow pipes, a style of
ceramic pipe manufacture that began to be
popular after ca. A.D. 1350 in East Texas,
and are virtually the exclusive form of clay
pipe made by the Caddo from the 15th
century A.D. on. At the Lang Pasture site
there were L-shaped elbow pipes (Var. A) in
two burials, the earliest form of elbow pipe
in the upper Neches, as well as engraved
Var. B and Var. C pipes (see Figure 6-23).
The stylistic character of the few arrow
points from the site that can reasonably be
associated with the principal Caddo
occupation (i.e., Perdiz and Bassett)
suggests the shared practice after ca. A.D.
1300 across the upper Neches River basin in
the manufacture and form of suitable arrow
points. The chipped and ground stone tools
found in domestic contexts at Lang Pasture
point to hunting activities as well as food
processing activities, and there is some
evidence of expedient flake tool use for
tasks and activities that emphasized the
“processing of smaller quantities of
resources” (Tomka 2001:208) than would
formal knapped tools. These expedient flake
tools and perforators would have been used
on wood or bone, or to cut and scrape hides
and animal parts. The four-beveled knive
would have been used for the butchering and
processing of medium-sized prey such as
deer (see Chapter 9, this volume). The one
ground stone celt may have been used in the
cutting of timbers for house construction or
structure repair.
How the Caddo at the Lang Pasture Site
Processed and Cooked Wild and
Domesticated Plant Foods and Wild
Animal Foods
The Caddo groups that lived at the Lang
Pasture site cooked plant and animal foods
almost exclusively in utility ware ceramic
jars that were placed in or over a hearth or
an open high-intensity fire. Sherds from
these ceramic jars have sooting and
preserved organic residues from the cooking
of plant food stuffs. The virtual absence of
ground stone plant processing equipment—

450

nutting stones, grinding slabs, manos, and
metates—associated with the principal
prehistoric Caddo component further
suggests that plant foods were processed
using bone and wood tools (i.e., wooden
mortars and pestles, bone sickles, see
Swanton 1942). One shallowly buried firecracked rock concentration (Feature 36)
northeast of Structure 2 (a domestic
structure) suggests that occasional hot rock
cooking of plant or animal foods (cf. Thoms
2008) took place in Caddo times as well, but
this cooking technology had been virtually
supplanted early in the Caddo archeological
record by the boiling of foodstuffs in
ceramic cooking pots.
The distribution of discarded sherds and
other artifacts at the site suggest that most of
the processing and cooking activities took
place outdoors, in activity and work areas
near to the domestic structures (see Figure
5-48, this volume). The one outdoor hearth
(Feature 25) is near both Structure 1 (a
domestic residence) and Structure 3 (a
ramada/elevated work platform). There are
also fire-cracked rock concentrations in the
outdoor work/activity areas, but the
archeological evidence suggests that most of
these clusters are the product of occasional
hot-rock cooking in Woodland and Late
Archaic times in these areas.
Establishing the Kinds of Tools Made and
Used During the Principal Caddo
Occupation
The kinds of stone tools made and used at
the Lang Pasture site during the early 14th to
early 15th century A.D. occupation include
arrow points of several forms (most likely
the Perdiz and Bassett types), perforators,
and edge-modified flakes.
Formally
retouched flake tools (i.e., scrapers and
drills) are conspicuously absent in the
chipped stone tool assemblage, and chipped
stone tools are not common at the site given
the extensive excavations that were
conducted there. A concentration of arrow
point preforms in the vicinity of Feature 76
indicates, however, that arrow point

Technical Report No. 174202

Archeological Investigations at the Lang Pasture Site (41AN38) in the Upper Neches River Basin of East Texas
Texas Department of Transportation

manufacture took place in this specific area
during the Caddo occupation. Other tools
that were used at the site—but were
probably not made there—include one
ground stone celt and a four-beveled knive
of Edwards chert. With respect to the low
number of arrow points that can be
reasonably associated with the principal
Caddo occupation at the Lang Pasture site
(16 Perdiz and two Bassett points), it has
been shown in several studies in East Texas
that the frequency of arrow points in post-ca.
A.D. 1300 contexts is rather low—even on
single component sites—and it appears that
stone arrow points and tools were not
intensively made or used after this time
(perhaps as a consequence of less hunting,
or greater use of bone or wood tools) (see
Perttula and Nelson 2007; Walters 2008).
Thus, on a site like Lang Pasture, the
numbers of arrow points reflect more than
simply occupational intensity but also
intensity of tool use, site function, etc.,
regardless of age, as well as the lower
intensity of use/production of chipped stone
tools for hunting and hide-processing
activities.
The fact that there are more early style
arrow points (i.e., pre-A.D. 1200) such as
Steiner and Catahoula at the Lang Pasture
site than there are arrow points of the Perdiz
and Bassett types, but almost no evidence in
the more abundant ceramic sherds (and from
many of the C14 and TL dates) for a preA.D. 1300 Caddo occupation, suggest a
specialized use of the area at that time for
Caddo hunting pursuits. This earlier Caddo
use must have originated from different
households and communities situated
elsewhere in the upper Neches River basin,
although such sites are far from common (cf.
Anderson et al. 1974; Johnson 1961; Story
2000).
Establishing the Manufacturing and Tool
Maintenance Activities at the Site
The best evidence for the manufacture of
chipped stone tools at the Lang Pasture site
is the 21 arrow point flake preforms and

Technical Report No. 174202

preform fragments recovered in the
excavations. Also substantiating the on-site
manufacture of chipped stone tools is the
number of cortical flakes in the lithic debris
assemblage from a series of Caddo pit
features (see Chapter 7, this volume).
Approximately 17% of the lithic debris from
these features has cortical remnants. This
relatively high percentage of cortex in the
lithic debris suggests that the Caddo stone
knappers reduced pebbles and cobbles of
raw material via bifacially flaked cores that
had some considerable amount of cortex on
them at the time of reduction. The goal of
the knapping was to produce flakes of
sufficient length and width that would be
suitable for arrow point manufacture or for
use as sharp-edged expedient flake tools.
Establishing Differences in the Proportion
of Local vs. Non-Local Lithic Raw
Materials in the Tools and Lithic Debris
Non-local lithic raw materials are present in
the chipped and ground stone tools and
chipped stone lithic debris from the Lang
Pasture site, but they are not abundant. They
include novaculite and metamorphic stone
from Ouachita Mountains sources and
Central Texas chert from likely Trinity and
Brazos River gravel sources. Less than 10%
of the arrow points are clearly made from
non-local lithic raw materials (and even
some of these are from sources not that far
distant), among them a few Perdiz and
Bassett arrow points. Local chert, quartzite
(primarily heat-treated), and petrified wood
were the predominant raw materials used by
the Caddo to manufacture tools at the site.
More specific analyses of the color and
cortex (i.e., proportion that are cortical, have
smoothed/roughened or limestone-covered
cortex, etc.) of the chert lithic debris would
need to be conducted to more specifically
sort probable local chert raw materials that
were being used and reduced on site versus
non-local chert debris that is likely the
product of the resharpening of tools made
elsewhere.

451

Chapter 12: Summary and Synthesis

Mortuary Practices
The main purpose of this research effort was
to establish if the burials at the Lang Pasture
site have evidence for social differences in
status or rank, and what were the prevalent
forms of mortuary treatment at the site and
in the region.
At the Lang Pasture site, Caddo adult men
and women were buried in a spatially
discrete cemetery placed ca. 10-20 m from
habitation and outdoor work areas. The
burials of children, on the other hand, were
placed together in a large pit feature that
may have first been used for storage of food
stuffs, until its storage function was
discontinued, at which point three child
burials were placed in it, and then filled in.
As with other upper Neches River basin
Caddo cemeteries, the children had only a
few funerary offerings placed with them,
while the adults had two or three times as
many ceramic vessels; two burials—both
probably adult men—had clay pipes placed
with them at death. Each grave had very
similar kinds and amounts of funerary
offerings, and the form of burial treatment
was also the same, both evidence preserved
in the mortuary practices that indicates that
there were not any considerable socialorganizational differences between the
individuals that were interred at the Lang
Pasture site.
The rarity of double burials in upper Neches
River Caddo cemeteries suggests that the
double burial (Feature 93, that of an adult
male and female) at the Lang Pasture site
may represent the interment of notable and
important adult individuals in a Caddo
community that lived in this part of the
Caddo Creek basin. Otherwise, the other
burials at the site—including those from
both adult and children burial groups—
appear to have had an equivalent social
position, separated only by age. The Caddo
burials found throughout the upper Neches
were buried by a living community of
Caddo peoples that shared similar social
beliefs about personal identity and gender,

452

beliefs about the soul’s nature, the afterlife,
and the soul’s journey to the House of
Death. These Caddo households defined
their own sense of place and who they were
by the unique juxtaposition of the living and
the dead in circumscribed areas with larger
farming communities. An emphasis on
affinity and kinship within and between
different households that created these
sacred cemetery places was more important
to household members than were their
broader ties to the larger communities of
which they were a part. Although these
Caddo shared similar views on social
memory and the place of the dead in their
lives, it was their households and associated
cemeteries (i.e., their ritual space) that were
the center of their universe, not the larger
and socially more diverse communities of
which they were a part.
The mortuary practices of the prehistoric
Caddo communities that lived in the upper
Neches River basin, as seen at the Lang
Pasture site and the many other cemeteries
in the region, have several significant
characteristics. First, the cemeteries and
burial places of these Caddo were
deliberately kept physically distant from
habitation areas, as an act of separating the
dead from the living but also in creating a
social memory of the deceased in those
places; they are often placed near sources of
fresh water. The burials are primarily those
of single interments, usually adult men and
women; children were sometimes buried in
cemeteries along with adults, but there are
instances where children were buried in
spatially distinct groups. The graves are
relatively shallow, and are narrowed near
the foot end, and the deceased was laid in
the grave in an extended supine position,
with arms by the sides. In most cases, the
deceased’s head was at the eastern end of
the grave, facing west towards the setting
sun; in a few cases where burial orientation
of a few graves was different, as at Lang
Pasture, this may be evidence of a slightly
earlier (i.e., pre-A.D. 1400) form of burial
interment, perhaps one associated with the

facing burial orientation of the Caddo
deceased reflects the path in which the souls
traveled to their House of Death. This
directionality in upper Neches Caddo
mortuary practices is a symbolic relationship
between death and winter, death imagery,
and concern for the dead, where mortuary
rituals represent a physical embodiment of
cosmology as expressed in the social order
and a specific set of beliefs about life, death,
and
socially
necessary
funerary
accompaniments. Individual burials were in
rows, with the graves parallel to one
another, in either east-west or north-south
rows; the burials were typically only 1-2 m
apart in these rows; the graves rarely
intersected; prepared grave floors are rare,
but when made, consisted of a gravel fill or
a white clay. Finally, the upper Neches
River Caddo cemeteries were not used for
substantial periods of time by any one
farmstead compound or group of related
farmsteads, perhaps no longer than 10-30
years at their maximum, based on the range
in the size of each cemetery and the number
and extent of associated habitation areas.
Almost all individuals, whether child or
adult, had accompanying offerings, both
durable as well as perishable (i.e.,
foodstuffs).
Funerary offerings were
generally placed by the head and shoulders,
as well as at the waist and by the hands and
feet; in some cases, the offerings appear to
have been placed on the body, usually at the
hips and on the legs. Ceramic bottles were
consistently placed near the head; the
arrangement and placement of funerary
offerings reflect particular social meanings
to these Caddo groups.
The offerings placed with the deceased
contain an assortment of pottery vessels,
followed by arrow points (commonly in
quivers) for adult males, clay pipes, chipped
stone knives, other kinds of stone tools,
marine shell ornaments, pigments, bone
tools or beads, and in the case of Allen
phase burials, a few European trade goods.
The variations in offerings by grave or by
cemetery are not substantial, except in the

Technical Report No. 174202

absolute frequency of quivers of arrow
points in certain cemeteries (see Table 11-4)
north and east of the Lang Pasture site that
date to the later part of the Frankston phase.
Pigments were apparently specific offerings
associated with adult females; children had
the lowest number of funerary offerings as
well as the least diverse kinds of offerings.
The differences in funerary offerings
between children and adults are clearly
related to gender and personal identity.
Since a very high proportion of Caddo
burials had funerary offerings, it seems
likely that the placement of these offerings
was a function of both individual wealth and
community esteem, reflecting differences in
gender status, not social status. The fact that
some adult Caddo females had clay pipes
and stone tools (large bifacial knives) as
funerary offerings suggests that certain adult
females participated along with more adult
men in both religious rituals associated with
smoking as well as activities associated with
the specialized butchering of game animals.
Certain adult males in upper Neches River
basin Caddo society had a recognized higher
social status in life—achieved through
accomplishments as hunters, warriors, or
diplomats/leaders—that was reflected in
their distinctive treatment at death. These
social identity or leadership relationships
became clearest after ca. A.D. 1560 in the
region. Even with their elite social position,
these individuals were buried with their
families and lineages in family cemeteries,
rather than being interred at a social distance
with other social elites from related
farmsteads and communities.
Evaluate the Hypothesis that Caddo
Populations in the Area Did Not Have a
Social Hierarchical Character as Seen in
Mortuary Practices
The demographic and funerary offerings
data from upper Neches River basin Caddo
cemeteries clearly indicate that the kinds and
amounts of funerary offerings placed among
upper Neches River Caddo groups, and
needed by them in their journey to the

453

Chapter 12: Summary and Synthesis

House of Death, varied significantly by age
and sex. Other than broad similarities in the
number of vessels per burial—suggesting
that these vessels held sufficient food stuffs
for children and adults on their journey, but
nothing more—in all other aspects adult
men clearly had need in the afterlife of such
gender-laden things as stone tools and arrow
points, a clay smoking pipe, and ornaments
on their journey, while children and adult
females did not. After ca. A.D. 1500, and
certainly after ca. A.D. 1560, there were a
few Caddo individuals in upper Neches
River basin who were recognized as having
important social identities, probably
manifest in leadership roles within specific
communities, or as heads of important
lineages. These individuals represent about
5% of the known Caddo burial population in
the region. Where information on age and
sex is available, these individuals appear to
have been adult males. By comparison to
contemporaneous Caddo populations in the
Big Cypress and Red River basins, mortuary
practices are less complex in their structure
and organization for Frankston and Allen
phase Caddo social groups. This in turn
implies that kin-related groups within upper
Neches Caddo societies were less socially
hierarchical in character or socio-politically
complex (cf. Carr 1995:169, 174) than were
other East Texas Caddo groups and
communities.
Establish the Social Affiliation of the
Households at the Site to Geographically
Related Socio-Political Groups in the
Upper Neches River Basin
The analysis of the decorative motifs in the
mortuary ceramics from a large number of
upper Neches River basin Caddo sites—
including the ceramic vessels from the Lang
Pasture site—as well as sherd assemblages
from domestic contexts—indicate that the
Caddo occupants of the Lang Pasture site
are socially affiliated at the regional scale
with other Caddo communities that had
settled over a ca. 5000 km2 area of the upper
Neches and upper Angelina River basins
(see Figure 6-70). A more detailed

454

consideration of decorative elements in the
engraved fine ware vessels, and a
comparison with the decorative styles
identified at the Lang Pasture site, indicate
that the closest social relationships (using
ceramic stylistic similarities as a proxy for
the closest social relationships and intensity
of social interaction) between the Caddo
living at the Lang Pasture site are with other
Caddo households and communities found
over a ca. 500 km2 in the central part of the
upper Neches, from Caddo Creek on the
north, Walnut Creek to the south, and
including sites on both the east and west
sides of the Neches River valley (see Figure
6-71).
Health and Diet of the Caddo
Establishing If the Diet was Adequate,
and If Infectious Diseases or Episodes of
Chronic Stress Were Common
Paleopathological evidence gathered in the
course of the bioarcheological investigations
of the Lang Pasture human remains, and
additional analyses of human remains from a
series of sites in the upper Neches River
basin, has shown that these Caddo
population had high adaptive efficiency until
after ca. A.D. 1650. Enamel hypoplasia and
porotic hyperostosis are the best available
indicators of adaptive inefficiency, and their
rates of occurrence are lower in the upper
Neches River basin than elsewhere in the
Caddo area (see Wilson 2008c). Rates of
enamel hypoplasia show a significant
increase in childhood stress only after ca.
A.D. 1650 that may be the result of
epidemic disease, social stress, and/or
increased maize consumption. Porotic
hyperostosis was rare in the upper Neches
population, but Rose et al. (1998) has
showed a peak for other Caddo populations
from the Red River and East Texas. The
one case of cribra orbitalia seen in the upper
Neches bioarcheological record indicates
that iron deficient anemia was present, at
least after ca. A.D. 1650.

Technical Report No. 174202

Archeological Investigations at the Lang Pasture Site (41AN38) in the Upper Neches River Basin of East Texas
Texas Department of Transportation

It is likely that an overall low, localized, and
dispersed Caddo population density in the
upper Neches through much of the history of
Caddo settlement there (or at least up until
ca. A.D. 1650) may have protected the
health that increased maize consumption is
otherwise assumed to negatively affect. The
upper Neches Caddo were genetically
homogenous, and with a lower population
density than that seen in the middle reaches
of the Red River basin. It is probably the
case that the lower population density of the
Caddo groups living in the upper Neches
after ca. A.D. 1200, in combination with
minimal population admixture or significant
periods of interpersonal contact, had better
health conditions and certainly experienced
less exposure to infectious diseases than did
those Caddo populations living along a
major stream such as the Red River, or those
populations that lived in the Blackland
Prairie (i.e., the upper Sulphur River basin).
Evaluate the Hypothesis That the Caddo
Population Living at the Lang Pasture
Site Had a Diet with a Relatively Low
Dependency on Maize
Stable isotope studies in the upper Neches
River basin, and at the Lang Pasture site,
have confirmed that maize was a significant
part of the Caddo diet as early as the Middle
Caddo period, and that maize consumption
significantly increased after ca. A.D. 1400.
The stable isotope values from Lang Pasture
indicate that, on average, maize comprised
between 28-31% of the diet, although one
individual (Feature 76C) had stable isotope
values on bone collagen that are consistent
with 45-48% maize consumption. Caddo
populations with a low dependency on
maize are seen only in pre-A.D. 1000 Caddo
burials from the upper Neches River basin
and in other Caddo populations of the same
age in the Red and Sulphur River basins in
southwestern Arkansas and East Texas
(Rose et al. 1998; Wilson 2008c).
Otherwise,
bioarcheological
evidence
(including stable isotopes, dental caries
rates, and dental wear) in the Pineywoods of
the upper Neches River basin are consistent

Technical Report No. 174202

with Caddo diets in which maize was
important, when the Lang Pasture site was
occupied, and that it became an even more
important food resource in the region after
this site was abandoned.
Establish if Maize Was as Important in
the Diet of the Upper Neches River Basin
Caddo as it Appears to Be in Other
Caddo Populations
Dental and stable isotopic data clearly
indicate that maize was an important dietary
resource in the upper Neches River basin
beginning during the Middle Caddo period,
as it was across much of the Caddo area
where such bioarcheological information is
available (Perttula 2008:Figure 6; Wilson
2008c). In the upper Neches, moreover, the
consumption of maize apparently increased
two-fold in the region after ca. A.D. 1400
(the Late Caddo period). Caries rates are
uniformly above the high carbohydrate
threshold (2.0 caries per individual)
beginning in the Middle Caddo period, but
increase to more than 4.5 caries per
individual during this same time period.
Wear scores from the Upper Neches remain
relatively stable until after ca. A.D. 1650.
This is the period of highest Caddo maize
consumption and presumably the softest
diet.
The highest bone collagen values for maize
in the upper Neches occur during Historic
Caddo times (see Table 10-22), as has also
been documented in Caddo populations
living along the Red River in southwestern
Arkansas and northwestern Louisiana (see
Rose et al. 1998; Tine and Tieszen 1997).
In fact, the stable isotope values in all three
areas suggest that maize comprised between
56-59% of the diet at that time.

12.3

THE CADDO NATION PERSPECTIVE
ON THE ANALYSIS OF HUMAN
REMAINS FROM
THE LANG PASTURE SITE
(41AN38)
Robert Cast and Bobby Gonzalez

On January 30, 2007 we visited the Texas
Archeological Research Laboratory at The
University of Texas at Austin to watch Dr.
Diane Wilson perform analysis on human
remains excavated from the Lang Pasture
site (41AN38), an archeological site in
Anderson County, Texas, that was
excavated by archeological contractors
working for the Texas Department of
Transportation (TxDOT). There were nine
burials represented at the site, however,
only seven individuals were represented
in the archeological excavations because
human remains were not preserved in all of
the burials (see Chapter 10, this volume).
There were some problems with getting to
view Dr. Wilson doing the analysis on the
remains. First of all, none of the burials or
remains had been cleaned or prepared for
her to look at. She had assumed that the
human remains would have had all the soil
matrix removed from them and that they
would have been prepared and cleaned for
her simply to do her measurements,
observations, and analysis; however, this
was not the case. Dr. Wilson explained that
the soil matrix was attached to a lot of the
bone, which was brittle and easily flaked
apart. Diane spent most of the week
cleaning the human remains. We took this
as an opportunity to learn what some of her
preliminary observations were regarding the
remains and the people living at the Lang
Pasture site.
When we are participants in these types of
work contracts, as a federally recognized
tribal government with a connection to the
archeological site and the human remains,
these projects are a recognition of our tribal
sovereignty. The Caddo Nation has believed

456

for decades that it has been unprofessional
for archeologists, anthropologists, and
historians to ignore the questions raised by
the tribe when doing projects that may
concern the living descendants over the life
of any given project. Some of the questions
raised during a project would be: "Why
remove these remains to begin with? Can't
they be left in place? If not, where will
they be reburied? How long will it take to
rebury them?"
With respect to the Caddo Nation and the
scientific community we can have a
common ground in that we believe there
are things to be learned from each other. If
we can learn to be equals over the life of a
project we can better understand each other.
We want to teach our people about the past
so future generations will also be aware of
the Caddo in Texas and the archeological
record left behind there. When we understand
more about the types of analysis that are
being done, we are more readily able to
understand what types of research questions
are out there and what new information can
be obtained from these analyses.
Because Dr. Wilson had to wash and prepare
all the human remains for analysis, we
discussed what her analysis would entail and
what she had observed so far from the
skeletal remains recovered in the
excavations and from the cleaning of the
remains. She explained that certain diseases
that were introduced by the Europeans
impacted the Caddo and these can be seen
when analyzing the bones. She stated that
arthritis is common with Caddo human
remains and seems to be prevalent along
the back of the neck, and is somewhat of a
genetic marker. This prompted us to question
whether or not this shows up in the present
day Caddo people. We also questioned her
about diabetes and if this showed up in the
human remains. She stated that none of the
Caddo in Texas observed from these
archeological contexts had diabetes but that
the Caddo developed the disease during
historic times. From our discussions with
Dr. Wilson, we believe that this type of

Technical Report No. 174202

Archeological Investigations at the Lang Pasture Site (41AN38) in the Upper Neches River Basin of East Texas
Texas Department of Transportation

research can in some ways benefit the present
day Caddo people and we hope this research
will provide a better understanding of our
genetic make-up concerning our own health
and diet.
Dr. Wilson also discussed different types of
cranial modeling that had been seen on
Caddo burials in the Caddo Area. We found
it interesting that one of the crania at the
Lang Pasture site had "banding rings"
present on the skull; Dr. Wilson explained
that there were four types of cranial
modeling among the Caddo in prehistoric
and early historic period times. She stated
that she did not see any evidence for cranial
modeling occurring exclusively among the
elite but that cranial modeling was noted in
burials throughout the Caddo regardless of
status.
Dr. Wilson also stated that there were a lot
of charcoal fragments in the burials, on the
remains, and throughout the soil matrix. We
found this interesting because perhaps this
charcoal is related to the fact that the present
day Caddo always build a fire near the foot
of the grave of the deceased; the prehistoric
Caddo may have had similar mortuary
practices. This fire burns for six days and is
used as a light to help guide the person in the
afterlife.
Any type of research question needs to be
handled with care and respect when
analyzing human remains that we believe to
be our ancestors. We have a Repatriation
Committee made up of traditional elders that
hear requests for analysis from a variety of
graduate
students
and
professional
archeological contractors doing research in
a number of fields related to Caddo
archeology. When we, and the Repatriation
Committee, hear these requests, we cannot
help but learn more about some of the
reasons
why
archeologists
and
anthropologists do what they do. The
Repatriation Committee answers each
request on a case-by-case basis. In rare
cases they have allowed destructive analysis
of human remains when the person doing

Technical Report No. 174202

the research has met with them, presented
in detail what they wanted to do, and
presented a clear argument to the
committee on how the analysis would be
beneficial. Meeting with the Repatriation
Committee also helps the archeologist and
anthropologist know what issues are of
concern to the tribe. When this does not
happen, we are unaware of the research
questions being asked, how they may or
may not benefit the tribe, and the
archeologists and anthropologists cannot
be made aware of any of our questions or
concerns regarding their studies. We believe
that sharing information is pertinent to a
productive relationship and benefits
everyone.
To answer some of the questions regarding
the analysis of human remains from the
Lang Pasture site and our perspective on
that analysis, we must first ask the question,
"Why were the human remains excavated in
the first place?" The Caddo would prefer to
have left the remains in place. This
however, was not possible because of the
highway project and its right-of-way. So,
through consultations with TxDOT, it was
agreed that the human remains and any
funerary objects recovered during the
archeological investigations would be
professionally documented for reporting
purposes.
The
Federal
Highway
Administration and TxDOT also agreed
with the request of the tribe that the human
remains and any funerary objects would be
repatriated and reburied as close as possible
to the area from which they came. These
details are still ongoing and reinterment of
the remains and the location of the
reinterment will be worked out with further
consultation.
The Caddo Nation Preservation Office
reviewed the research design for the work
and agreed with the overall research design
and data recovery plan. With this in mind, we
agreed to allow standard identification
related to age and gender of the human
remains without allowing any destructive
analysis of the remains. However, the

457

Chapter 12: Summary and Synthesis

tribal council agreed to isotope analysis in
February of 2006, once more details were
explained about the analysis.
As observers, we were very pleased with
the care and respect that Dr. Wilson
showed the remains. However, it was sad
to see human remains having to be washed,
with the minute bone meal fragments
going down the drain of the sink, which
we understood could not be prevented. We
also realize if a burial has only bone meal
left within its context (as did two of the
interments in one grave) it will be difficult
for archeologists to collect it all. When we
have been involved in reburials of human
remains it is sometimes devastating to the
elders doing the reburial to have to remove
the bones from all the packaging. They
may ask "Why are we having to take these
remains out of plastic bags?" In other
words, it is not traditional for them to have
to rebury these remains in the first place, or
to have to remove them from boxes, cartons,
plastic bags, or vials. Observing how these
human remains were packaged for transport
to the laboratory, we realize bone meal is
also often left in the packaging material
and then discarded in the trash; this again is
something that is not traditional for us. Bone
meal is still a part of that individual.
Archeologists recognize that from tiny
portions of human remains there is the
opportunity to extract DNA, obtain
chronological dates on the context of the
remains, and in a sense, ask questions about
where this type of analysis will go in the
future and what scientific techniques will be
developed to further our understanding of
humanity. We also understand the
significance of these small fragments of
remains for they are our people. How the
Caddo people choose to address this issue,
however, is a dilemma for us. On the one
hand, we would try to collect every single
bit of human remains, bone meal and all,
for proper reburial. Traditionally, we would
never use plastic bags or artificial
containers to hold or transport the remains,
but would prefer cedar boxes or blankets.
We would hope that the archeological

458

community would be more aware of these
cultural differences and realize that we have
been asked to address certain questions that
we never expected that we would have to
address. What other groups in Texas have
to rebury human remains on a regular
basis?
TXDOT understands that we use cedar boxes
and blankets to rebury our people. However,
when they are removed from the field,
archeologists use standard materials to
transport the remains. We do prefer cedar
boxes and blankets; however, once the
remains are put in boxes or blankets they
need to be left alone until reburial. We
know that the dirt from the fill and every
burial along with remains will be reunited
with all their individual material that was
removed with them, and that is good.
Even though the human remains were
examined following standard procedures
explained in the report, there are tribal
members that may feel this type of research
was wrong, unnecessary, and against
tribal beliefs and outside of tribal custom.
Also, in providing synthetic regional review
of Caddo bioarcheology, and incorporating
that new information with bioarcheological
information already published on Caddo
human remains from the Caddo region,
bioarcheologists should explain in more
detail how this information can help the
present day Caddo. We know that the word
"Caddoan" as seen in the Chapter 10 draft
was used linguistically and lumps in other
federally recognized tribes that are
different than the Caddo. Terms like these
cause confusion among tribes and scholars
alike and should be corrected and referred to
as just the bioarcheology of the Caddo. This
report also seems to be merely more research
data for those in the field of bioarcheology
and archeology at the expense of our
ancestral remains, although this is
understandable given the circumstances that
our ancestors had to be removed.
However, we are pleased with the
establishment of the inventory of the

Technical Report No. 174202

Archeological Investigations at the Lang Pasture Site (41AN38) in the Upper Neches River Basin of East Texas
Texas Department of Transportation

individuals from the Lang Pasture site. In
understanding the assemblages of the material
representing each individual, this can be
used as a good tool for the tribe and does
chart a way for repatriating the individuals
along with any associated materials. The
inventory also gives an assessment on the
preservation of the human remains, health,
mortuary patterns, bioturbation, postmortem
disturbances, excavation conditions, and other
useful information. The assessment in the
report is useful and needed for the tribe to
understand what took place during and after
the excavations of the human remains and
the material representing each individual.
This report also indicates the likelihood
that more research questions and requests
for more specific examinations may be
brought forth in the future. It is important
for the Caddo Nation to communicate that
any expectations for more research relating
to the human remains from the Lang Pasture
site will be treated independently from this
research analysis.
One topic that could use a lot more dialogue
and discussion is the bioarcheological
information concerning cranial modeling
and the different types of cranial modeling
used by the Caddo people over time as
described in this research. We would like to
see a presentation made to the Tribal
Council detailing the findings contained in
this report along with an explanation of the
archeological contents and mortuary
contexts excavated from the Lang Pasture
site. This would be a good starting point to
discuss the various types of cranial
modeling and how long this has occurred
with the Caddo, to provide a temporal
context for when this occurs, and where this
occurs on the Caddo cultural landscape. In
conclusion, this research has shown that
there are many differences between those
individual scholars and archeologists who
seek answers to their questions about the
Caddo and those of the tribe that is impacted
with such explorations and requests.

CONCLUSIONS

What began in the winter of 2004 as the
Texas Department of Transportationsponsored test excavation of a poorly known
prehistoric Caddo site in a right-of-way
along SH155 that was proposed for
expansion, now referred to as the Lang
Pasture site (41AN38), in the upper Neches
River basin in East Texas, has now, several
years later, resulted in one of the most
extensive and archeologically compelling
investigations of a Caddo site in this area.
The data recovery work completed by a
Coastal
Environments,
Inc.
and
Archeological
&
Environmental
Consultants, LLC team in 2006 obtained a
wealth
of
new
archeological,
bioarchaeological, and paleoenvironmental
information about the lives and times of
prehistoric ancestors of the Caddo Indian
peoples, and has cast a new light on the
character and pace of native history of the
Caddo in the East Texas region.
The
data
recovery
investigations
summarized in this volume have been
particularly important for advancing the
field of Caddo archeology in several
different respects. First, the intensive work
completed in domestic habitation contexts at
the site resulted in the identification of a
well-defined series of features from
prehistoric Caddo houses, specialized
structures (i.e., granaries or ramadas/arbors),
and ancillary outdoor activity areas, such
that the character of a rural domestic Caddo
household in much of East Texas (or at least
the Neches-Angelina River basins) has come
into better focus. Second, the exposure and
excavation of a Caddo family cemetery—
and the attempt to determine the regional
context for changes in Caddo diet and
health—has led to an understanding of the
bioarcheological character of the Caddo
people in the upper Neches River basin that
is unparalleled anywhere in the larger Caddo
archeological area (cf. Wilson 2008c). The
bioarcheological information on diet, health,
and pathologies obtained during the course
of the Lang Pasture site investigations has

459

Chapter 12: Summary and Synthesis

an importance well beyond the local
archeological context, because it provides a
sweeping view of more than 800 years of
Caddo life that will be relevant to
understanding different Caddo peoples and
groups in other parts of the Caddo world.
Thirdly, the Lang Pasture archeological and
bioarcheological investigations were done in
consultation with the Caddo Nation of
Oklahoma, most particularly arising from
their permission to conduct the intensive
bioarcheological analysis of the Lang
Pasture human remains and the human
remains from other upper Neches River
Caddo sites. That consultation has allowed
the Caddo peoples to keep abreast of the
bioarcheological approach and findings, and
most importantly also provides them an
opportunity
to
communicate
their
perspectives on the meaning of the findings
from these investigations. This is a first for
the field of Caddo archeology, and it is a
step in the right direction of making room
for the Caddo peoples to be full partners in
future
Caddo
archeological
and
bioarcheological investigations within their
traditional homelands.
Fourth, and finally for the purposes of this
summary, the identification of the family
cemetery at the Lang Pasture site—as well
as the associated funerary offerings placed
in each of the graves—allowed for the
regional consideration of Caddo mortuary
practices based on a study of a number of
upper Neches River basin Caddo cemeteries,
a topic that heretofore had been of limited
interest to East Texas Caddo archeologists.

460

To complement the consideration of
mortuary practices, the study of the style,
manufacture, and function of mortuary
vessels in this region permitted the first
examination of issues of style and stylistic
change, social identity, and changes in
culinary traditions as possible manifestations
of changes in ceramic practice that occurred
among Caddo groups living in the upper
Neches River valley of East Texas between
the 14th to 17th centuries A.D.
The mortuary ceramics from upper Neches
River basin Caddo sites illustrate broad
continuities in ceramic practice, which had
been
suspected
but
never
fully
demonstrated, particularly in terms of vessel
decoration and vessel form, but also
demonstrate patterns in technical choices
that are very different than what is
documented in domestic Caddo ceramic
assemblages of the same age and made by
the same social group of potters. The
ceramic practice data (i.e., decorative,
technological, and formal) from both
domestic and mortuary contexts has been
employed to posit the existence of a
distinctive upper Neches Caddo tradition of
ceramic practice.

Introduction

Site selection for the 41AN38 pollen project
in Anderson County, Texas was guided by a
desire to locate reduced sediments
containing stratigraphically ordinal and
well-preserved pollen of significant timedepth reflecting both local (41AN38 site
specific) and regional vegetation conditions
within a zone of exploitation by site
inhabitants and neighboring communities.
Such flora would then be used to reconstruct
the ecology of human settlement, including
a reconstruction of potential food mosaics
and regional climate conditions. Moreover,
direct and indirect human impact on
vegetation through time might also be
reconstructed in this East Texas region
lacking in pollen data.
In this context,
possibilities of understanding historic forest
ecology of parts of East Texas are also
realizable.
Moreover, important
methodological advances in alluvial
palynology are finally achieved in this
study, as described in concluding sections.
Pollen cores from site environs and the
Caddo Creek valley derive from a narrow
strip of post oak savanna after regional
vegetation maps (Diggs et al. 2006),
although fine mapping systems also locate
aspects of blackland prairie vegetation
within the valley, depending on the
incidence of certain soil types (Bureau of
Economic Geology 2000). Immediately to
the east of the core sites, a transition of
vegetation to a piney-woods mixture is
mapped, indicating that a variety of flora
might be encountered in pollen stratigraphy
of the Caddo Creek region, ranging from
floodplain woodlands supporting demanding
tree species, to Pinus echinata and Quercus
stellata on more acidic uplands, to (little
bluestem dominated) grasslands with forbs
of
the
Schizochyrium-Sorgastrum
association depending on the presence of
local Alfisols.

Technical Report No. 174202

An importance of soil formations for
vegetation in the study region has been
noted.
To this end, it is observed that a
main soil type of the Caddo Creek valley
(and of the 41AN38 site locality) is that of
the moderately acidic Pickton-Wolfpen
series, which is sandy, well drained, and
usually developed on moderate slopes
(Texas Agricultural Experiment Station
1975, 1979).
This formation supports
acidophytic woodland, consisting of oak
with some pine (as above) and yaupon (Ilex
vomitoria). Important particularly to Cores
1 and 3 in the Caddo Creek valley itself is
the Nahatche series, described as a loamy
soil on poorly drained level ground. Trees
of a more demanding sort, including black
hickories (Carya texana), as well as
numerous oaks (Quercus marilandica, Q.
nigra), and Q. phellos in increasingly wet
areas) occur here.
A further soil formation of importance to the
study region is the Trawick series around the
boundary of Anderson and Henderson
Counties.
This is a variegated series of
glauconite, sandy marl, loamy sediment, and
inter-bedded clayey strata. This supports
grassland or savanna vegetation in places,
and is generally less acidic than the Pickton
and Nahatche.
By analogy to defined
sugarberry-elm forests of the post-oak
savanna in the Middle Brazos valley (Diggs
et al. 2006), such alkaline soils can promote
a variety of deciduous trees, including
species of Ulmus, Celtis, and Fraxinus.

Field Work

Three vibra-cores contained within 3-inch­
diameter modified irrigation pipe were
extracted for dating and pollen analysis from
the environs of 41AN38 and the Caddo
Creek immediately south of Frankston near
the boundary of Anderson and Henderson
Counties, Texas. The vibra-corer itself was
made by Harry Williams, Professor. of
Geography at the University of North Texas,

499

Appendix A: Middle to Late Holocene Palynology of Vibra-Cores from 41AN38 and Caddo Creek

from a concrete vibrator and machinedclamp, which is attached to pipe.
Thus
attached, the apparatus drives such pipe
through sediment via vibration. A cutting
element with retractable welded plates was
attached to the low end of the pipe for
sample retention during core extraction,
when pipe and sediment core is supported
by tripod. The device works well in wet
sediments, although limits to coring include
drier clays, which are difficult to penetrate
via vibration and the sheer weight of the
entire apparatus in wet places during
sediment core extraction by winch.
Of the three cores, Core 2 derives from a
small seep immediately south of the
archaeological site, on the western edge of
the H-155 ROW. Cores 1 and 3 derive
from alluvial accretion deposits in the north
and middle parts of the Caddo Creek valley,
on the eastern edge of the ROW of H-155,
about one mile north of the archaeological
site.
By topographic context, all cores
derive from places of high water table
conducive to pollen preservation (reduction
limits that biotic activity degrades pollen).
An acidic sedimentary matrix is also
indicated after reactions of HCL in
laboratory work described below (acidic
matrices also lower biotic activity).
Furthermore, according to topography,
deposits at Core 2 are accumulating as
colluvium along a transportational slope. In
contrast, deposits from Cores 1 and 3 from
the small Caddo Creek valley are finer and
consist of alluvium. Of these latter, Core 1
lies on the northern alluvial margin (over­
bank deposit) six meters north of Core 3,
which derives from the middle part of the
creek valley.

500

Due to factors of sorting, sediments from
Core 3 are generally coarser than those from
Core 1.
Both Cores 1 and 2 reach
consolidated sediments below alluvium and
colluvium respectively. Work at Core 3,
however, was limited by constraints of the
wetland setting in the absence of a special
platform. Here, the base of unconsolidated
alluvium was not reached at a depth of 2.75
meters, the logistical limit of coring.
A.2.1 Description of Pollen Core
Sediments
The irrigation pipes containing Cores 1, 2,
and 3 were cut open by pneumatic
machinery prior to description and sampling.
Of these, Core 1 from over-bank deposits
was recovered to a depth of 2.95 (or 3.15
after factoring for compression) meters.
Sediments here consist mostly of silt with
some clay and a minor fraction of fine sand.
Most fine sand occurs in the lower part of
the core (266-295 cm).
Sediments also
become finer in three bands, which contain
more clay and traces of humus (218-266,
106-160, and 0-90 cm). A grayish-brown
hue predominates in this core, suggestive of
a reducing situation. Some mottling is also
observed in the upper part of the core.
Sediments are described in a quartile (0-4)
system after Troels-Smith (1955) in Table
A-1 below. In this system, trace values of a
given sediment type are registered as a plus,
while boundaries between sedimentary
zones are termed limus, whereby sharper
boundaries are registered with high values
on a four-point scale. Importantly, all cores
are integral (i.e., derive en toto from a single
pipe).

AMS Dating and Rates of
Sedimentation

A total of fourteen AMS samples,
principally of bulk sediment, have been
assayed from the three pollen cores (Table
A-4), although isolated dates are also
derived from non-carbonized plants. For
example, leafy detritus (D. Hood, pers.
comm. 2008) is assayed in the upper part of
Core 3 (Beta 239842), where an Atomic age
comparable to that of upper bulk sediment
(cf. Beta 218312) is obtained. In this case,
a non-intrusive deposition is inferred. It is
also apparent here that a low-energy setting
(indicated in sediments) might reduce the
incidence of the introduction of old carbon
via erosion and redeposition. Conversely, a
single rejected date (Beta 239844) from
Core 3 derives from minute and
indeterminate plants, and may be rhizomous
(i.e., significantly intrusive from above).
This assay is more than a millennium too
young relative to other dates in Core 3 as
well as contextual dates in Core 1.
A
reliability check on Beta 239844 is thus
made after an assay on bulk sediments from
which the minute plant fraction derives
(Beta 243084), which produces a
contextually rational date about three
thousand years older.

502

humus

Importantly, twelve dates from organic
sediment produced rational sequences in all
three cores. For example, all bulk sediment
dates from Core 3 increase in age with
depth. From Core 2, two closely spaced
samples produced very close dates in proper
sequence. The position of this core in a
seep along a gentle transportational slope
reinforces the impression that bulk
sediments can produce reliable dates in low
energy settings. An exception to this rule is
a less significant inversion (with 2-Sigma
overlap) of dates in the upper part of the
over-bank deposit of Caddo Creek (Core 1).
These (Beta 218308 and 238499) are quite
similar, despite a 40-cm difference in depth,
and suggest either a high rate of
accumulation with redeposition of up-stream
deposits, or else an intrusion of sediment
after bio-turbation in this terrestrial setting.
A lack of stratigraphic evidence for an
unconformity here, along with a mottling of
sediment hues support the latter possibility,
which is also a more sensible one in terms of
topographic context.
Thus older date
ranges will be used to estimate
sedimentation in the upper part of Core 1
(this supposes that Beta 238499 is too
young, as opposed to 218308 being too old).

In general, dates from Core 1 support the
mid-channel sequence from Core 3 in that
the highest rates of accumulation in the
channel are correlated with the entirety of
the over-bank deposition (post-3800 BP).
Also, highest (pre-Atomic) rates of
sedimentation in Core 3 are coeval with the
highest rates of over-bank deposition after
Core 1 AMS data (to after 800 BP). These
correlations indicate that a significant level
of erosion and accumulation along the
middle channel and over-bank aspects of the
Caddo Creek valley region predates the
Caddo period (Woodland or Fourche
Maline), although such rates double during
and after Middle Caddo times (Table A-5).

Local to 41AN38, it is not possible to
accurately estimate rates of later sediment
accumulation (containing much pollen) on
the transportational slope of the seep after
the AMS data from Core 2 (this is attempted
after relative pollen dating). It is noted,
however, that over the long-term, net
sedimentation rates are low here (~1
cm/century). From
Caddo
Creek,
sedimentation rates are far greater,
particularly in Core 1 from the over-bank
(3.1-20+ cm/century), while sedimentation
rates are highly variable in Core 3 from the
mid-channel deposit (1.4 -~50 cm/ century).

In Core 3, sedimentary boundaries are well
defined (Lim. values of 2-3) where higher
rates of accumulation occur. In this light,
grading boundaries (Lim 0-1) in slowly
accumulating sediment in the same core
reflect a more continuous if low average rate
of accumulation, rather than erosion, which
should produce a sharp, not a grading

boundary.
The
same
boundary
characteristics are also evident in the upper
part of Core 1, where other problems of
dating arise. A demonstration of a higher
sedimentation rate of later alluvia in the
creek valley as a whole gives contextual
support the chronometry in Table A-5.

Laboratory Work

All pollen samples were processed using the
HF method (an application of a hot 49% HF
solution followed by a controlled 10%
warm, HCL reduction of silico-flourides),
along with a pretreatment of 10% cold HCL
and 10% hot KOH.
Distilled water for
cleaning and pure ETOH for dehydration is
employed herein. A post-treatment of an
acetolysis solution (of sulfuric acid and
acedic anhydride) was made after relative
cellulose content of sample material. All
samples with major clay content are further
deflocculated in a 5% solution of sodium
hexa-metaphosphate and filtrated using a
tested 8-micron nitex screens in a modified
Gilson SS-15 apparatus, prior to chemical
reduction. In addition, a Lycopodium tablet,
containing 6000 exotic fern spores, issued
by the Department of Quaternary Geology,
University of Lund in Sweden, was added to
all samples towards the calculation of pollen
concentration. Samples were then dyed red

in saffranine and placed in a substrate of
2000 viscosity silicone oil for purposes of
light microscopic work.
Notably, an
advantage of oil over gelatin pollen
preparations lies in the fact that grain
expansion common to glycerols is avoided.
This is important where the size of grain
attributes is a part of taxonomy, for example
in Zea pollen identification.
After reduction of pollen samples, light
microscope work aimed at achieving
statistically significant counts in the order of
200 to 500 grains per sample. Most grains
are examined at x400 magnification, with
immersion oil being used for examinations
at x1000 magnification. Special emphasis
is also given to Zea pollen identification,
given its potential importance for detecting
prehistoric agricultural episodes and a
potential confusion of wild grass with maize
pollen.
Regarding the latter, modern
varieties of Zea average more than 80
microns in diameter, although the pollen

Archeological Investigations at the Lang Pasture Site (41AN38) in the Upper Neches River Basin of East Texas

morphology of prehistoric maize varieties is
unknown due to a lack of direct comparative
specimens.
Attention to the question comparative ZeaPoaceae
morphology
includes
an
examination of type-slide collection from
the University of Texas at Austin Herbarium
at the Dept. of Geography and Environment
and a review of literature (esp. Eubanks
1997 and Dull 2006).
In short, it is
concluded that there is a potential for a
confusion of large wild grass with small
maize pollen grains (those under 65 microns
dia.).
However, given that the average
diameter of Teosinte (maize progenitor)
pollen is observed to be 79 microns, it is
unlikely that ancient maize will produce
pollen
significantly
smaller,
as
domestication should increase rather than
decrease cultigen pollen grain size with
cultural selection. This is certainly the case
in the Old World, where pollen grains of
varieties of (originally cultivated) emmer
wheat range from 40 to 50 microns in
diameter, increasing to 70 microns in
subsequently cultivated bread wheat
varieties.
Indeed, most pollen grains of
modern American maize varieties have
diameters ranging from 118 to 122 microns,
while pollen of Mexican maize varieties of
an “indigenous” characteristic exhibit
diameters ranging mostly from 76 to 97
microns.
Only statistical outliers of the
latter varieties exhibit diameters under 60
microns.
In fact, a pollen grain of 58
microns diameter is the smallest maize
specimen cited by Eubanks (1997).
There are no established criteria other than
measured diameter to distinguish Zea from
large Poaceeae, and although early maize
pollen is sometimes defined on the basis of
grains as small as 50 microns in diameter,
these assignments are tenuous (Dull 2006).
A need for caution in this respect is also
reflected at Caddo Creek, where three
Poaceae grains with diameters of 55 to 60
microns occur at 263 and 150 cm depths in
Cores 1 and 3, respectively.
These

Technical Report No. 174202

sediments are about 3,000 years old, and
predate by many centuries the earliest
evidence for maize cultivation in the TransMississippian South (Schambach 2001).
These observations support Dull (2006),
who limits the definition of Zea to those
pollen grains with a minimal long axis of 65
microns.
With
regard
to
the
palynological
identification of tree species important for
human economy, hickory and pecan are
usually subsumed under the general Carya­
type. However, based upon pollen typeslide examination at the Herbarium, as well
as investigations of multiple sequences in
South Texas and Mexico (where Carya
relates to C. illinoensis), pecan pollen
exhibits a more robust exine thickening at
the pore margin and somewhat larger
average grain size vis à vis hickory, although
measurements over-lap in these respects.
Notably, pollen grains of Carya from Caddo
Creek and 41AN38 cores are less robust,
and probably derive mostly from hickory
rather than pecan trees.
A.5

Pollen Preservation and
Concentration

Subsequent to laboratory work, wellpreserved pollen in high concentrations was
found in a great majority of analyzed
samples from the Caddo Creek valley (Cores
1 and 3), although layers with low pollen
concentrations were found in one sample at
85 cm depth in Core 1 and in two samples
around 100 cm depth in Core 3. These low
grain concentration samples are listed in
absolute pollen count tables, but insufficient
grains are countable to make such data
statistically meaningful. In general, pollen
exines in sediment are generally preserved
due to a reducing environment promoted by
the local water table. Crumpling of pollen
grain walls has occurred in these (non­
cushioned) mineragenic matrices, but this is
moderate, allowing for proper identifications
in all but a small number of cases.
A
silicone oil preparation employed above is

505

Appendix A: Middle to Late Holocene Palynology of Vibra-Cores from 41AN38 and Caddo Creek

useful here, as this allows for grain rotation
under the light microscope, for a complete
examination of morphological aspects.
More than 40 different pollen types have
been distinguished in the examination of

about 15,000 grains from the three pollen
cores, in which pollen concentration values
vary in a somewhat random fashion by a
high magnitude.

In Core 1 from over-bank deposits of Caddo
Creek, pollen concentration values of viable
samples range from 1,433 to 75,545 grains
per cubic cm.
Importantly, these values
vary without respect to pollen zones (see
below) or relative quantities of degradationresistant Pinus pollen. It is inferred that
conditions of initial sedimentation (rather
than
degradation)
modulate
pollen
concentration values, whereby relative
percentage values are not affected in a
significant way.

from sample-to-sample, from 4,395 to
429,000 grains per cubic cm in absolute
terms. A uniformity of non-degradation of
pollen is also observed, even in low
concentration samples. Although multiple
peaks of pollen concentration are further
observed here, it is significant that there is
no relation of this variation (of two orders of
magnitude) in pollen concentration to
granulometry, pollen grain diameter, pollen
type, or pollen zone definition. Moreover,
abrupt variation in concentration from level-

Archeological Investigations at the Lang Pasture Site (41AN38) in the Upper Neches River Basin of East Texas

to-level observed in many close-set samples
(e.g., 170/160 and 155/151 cmbs) produces
no abrupt change in relative pollen
percentages. Rather, pollen representation
in close-set samples grades according to
longer-term
trends,
which
reflect
ecologically rational floral change through
time. The data pattern from Cores 1 and 3
from Caddo Creek thus shows that pollen
concentration in alluvium is not a necessary
indicator of differential representation
(sorting), and moreover, major variations of
up to two orders of magnitude in such

concentration has a negligible influence on
relative pollen percentages or zonation.
Conditions for pollen preservation are far
worse in Core 2 colluvium, where an
oxidation of middle and lower sediments is
observed according to Munsell hues.
Samples from a depth of 55 cm
(approximate depth of site AMS dates) to
surface are analyzed, and virtually no pollen
is encountered below a depth of 21 cm.

under oxidizing conditions is a likely agent
of this absence. However, once conditions
for pollen preservation are made effective,
very high concentration values are observed,

507

Appendix A: Middle to Late Holocene Palynology of Vibra-Cores from 41AN38 and Caddo Creek

with a site maximum of 347,000 grains per
cubic cm occurring in the basal viable
sample. A secondary peak of 80,700 grains
per cubic cm also occurs in upper parts of
the core (at 2 cmbs), below a near surface
sample with a minimum of pollen
concentration (5,037 grains/cc). Evidently,
factors of sedimentation rates might
importantly affect the relative concentration
of pollen grains (higher mineragenic
accumulation rates may produce lower,
time-dependent pollen concentration values
and vice versa).
It is guessed that the
hydrology of the seep by 41AN38 has also
varied though time, and had a different
orientation entirely below the 21 cmbs depth
threshold, which seems to mark the starting
point of local reduction.
A.6

Pollen Recruitment Dynamics

After topographic context, it is inferred that
pollen from creek valley sediments in Cores
1 and 3 is derived importantly from water
transport after flood events and more
equitable drainage, ultimately after overland
flow from a basin area estimated to extend
145 square kilometers in northern Anderson
(inclusive of 41AN38) and southern
Henderson
Counties,
after
aerial
photographic soil maps (Texas Agricultural
Experiment Station 1975, 1979).
This
inference is supported by a wealth of pollen
analog data from bay and lake settings (e.g.
Peck 1973, Bonny 1976, 1978, Pennington
1979), which indicate that about 80 to 97%
of pollen is recruited into sediment by water
in settings where there are significant inlet
channels for a water transport of pollen.
Particular to alluvium, a landmark study
based upon a multi-year collection of analog
data in multiple fluvial basins in Exeter
County, England (Brown et al. 2007), shows
that 91% of pollen in alluvium is recruited
into such sediment from high-energy flood
events, ultimately from overland flow, with
only a minor aspects originating from air
deposition or the redeposition of top-set
sediments upstream.
Moreover, a close

508

match between basin vegetation composition
and pollen in alluvium is discerned, along
with an effective transport of upland pollen
types (e.g., Calluna vulgaris) without major
distance decay of the representation of such
pollen at downstream sites. The land area
of pollen recruitment at such alluvial sites
closely corresponds to the shape of the
upstream drainage basin. The latter finding
indicates an actual empirical superiority of
aqueous transport sites over those where
airborne
deposition
of
pollen
is
predominant, in that distance decay
relationship of pollen deposition after air
transport are exceedingly difficult to define,
and varies greatly moreover according to the
surface area of lake or peat basins, as well as
the relative afforestion of their margins, the
trunk and canopy space of which
importantly localize site aerodynamics and
pollen taphonomy (Tauber 1967, Anderson
1974, Jacobson and Bradshaw 1981).
Often, the land area represented by pollen
spectra in small wooded basins is greatly
over-estimated due a failure to account for
such aerodynamic factors, and local pollen
flora are thus interpreted to be regional, as
has been the case at Boriack Bog, Texas
(Bryant and Holloway 1985).
In less temperate regions, a similar match
between pollen in alluvium and basin
vegetation is inferred by the author
according to the criterion of ecologic
rationality of pollen spectra in an earlier
study from Highway 155 at Big Sandy
Creek in Upshur County, Texas (Albert
2007).
In the present study, a more
stringent test of the reliability of alluvial
pollen data will be made after comparative
pollen zonation of nearby cores in different
alluvial facies, as well as a comparison of
percentage values of statistically robust
main pollen types in near-coeval samples
from such cores (see below).
Pollen Core 2 from the source of a seep by
the site of41AN38 is quite different in
pollen taphonomic terms vis à vis the Caddo
creek cores, in that there is no possibility of

Technical Report No. 174202

Archeological Investigations at the Lang Pasture Site (41AN38) in the Upper Neches River Basin of East Texas
Texas Department of Transportation

extensive upstream transport of pollen at the
seep. Here a mix of airborne deposition
from extra-local flora, gravity deposition by
local types, and some overland flow from
the transportational slope of the 41AN38
locale is inferred to be operative. As will
become apparent below, it is nonetheless
interesting that pollen types found at the
41AN38 seep correspond to those found in
the valley of Caddo Creek as a whole, not
only with respect to actual genera
represented, but often also their relative
levels of representation. This comparative
similarity provides direct empirical support
to the inference that pollen in the creek
valley cores is significantly derived from
overland flow from extra-riparian zones.
Differences between the creek and seep
pollen flora are minor, and probably reflect
local elements of the seep, where Rhus for
example is a significant arboreal element,
and Asteraceae is somewhat less important
amongst herbaceous pollen types.
A.7

Pollen Zonation

Pollen zonation, for objective, comparative
purposes, is done statistically using a
stratigraphically constrained incremental
sum of squares cluster analysis employing
pollen percentage data.
This analysis is
facilitated by the CONISS program
developed by Dr. E.C. Grimm of the
Southern Illinois State Museum and
COHMAP member. The program measures
the dissimilarity of sample clusters in terms
of Edwards and Cavalli-Sforza’s chord
distance. A dendrogram of this distance is
plotted on the right-hand side of pollen
diagrams as an addendum. For purposes of
zonation here, a chord distance of less-than
four is required for the grouping of
distinctive
pollen
assemblages
in
stratigraphic sequence.
At present, it is
noted that there is a positive relation
between time-depth of individual sequences

Technical Report No. 174202

and the number of defined zones. Thus the
abbreviated, 21 cm pollen sequence in Core
2 produces a single pollen zone.
In
contrast, seven zones are observed in the
circa 6,700 year sequence from Core 3,
while a circa 3,000 year parallel sequence in
Core 1 produces 3 pollen zones according to
consistent statistical standards after Grimm
(1987). These zones are described on a
sequential basis. The dating of individual
pollen zones depends principally on AMS
data, although stratigraphic data, including
that of pollen and sediments types, is also
used to infer less-approximate ranges in
some cases.
A.8

Pollen Core 1

Five AMS dates from this core are used to
infer the dating of three pollen zones from
the over-bank deposit, although an age
estimate of the final zone is necessarily
more approximate due to date over-lap or
inversion of two assays here. Upper dates
from the core nonetheless establish a pre­
modern, post-1000 cal. BP age for the
termination of major sedimentation,
probably around Late Caddo times. Below
this zone, a vegetation history sequence of
3,600-year age is observed. Zones defined
on the basis of samples separated by
multiple centuries (due to low rates of
sedimentation) are assigned minimal
chronologic ranges only.
Pollen Assemblage Zone 1 (295-263 cmbs),
3575-2535 cal. BP, Quercus, Carya,
Asteraceae. Quercus pollen dominates this
zone, ranging from 14.4 to 24.8%, while
Carya is almost as important, with values
ranging from 12.3 to 18.8%.
Low to
moderate Pinus values occur, ranging from
3.0 to 11.7%.
Trace values (ca.1%) of
Ulmus, Celtis, Juglans, Populus, Alnus, and
Fraxinus, as well as low values (ca. 2%) of
Salix appear. Tree pollen as a whole
averages about 45% within this zone.

Pollen Core 2

Two AMS dates from the middle part of this
core are used in part to infer the dating of
one defined pollen zone from the upper part
of the seep deposit by 41AN38.
In the
main, low sedimentation rates at this site
imply a two thousand year time depth of the
latter zone; however, a lack of stratigraphic
change
in
the
pollen
assemblage
(statistically clustered into a single,
moderately variable zone after CONISS) is
suggestive of a shorter time-span, in the
order of one thousand years or less after
durations of defined pollen assemblage
zones in the other, better-dated cores.
Further correlations with Cores 1 and 3 are
made where Pinus is pollen dominant,
Carya values are low (<%5), and Stellaria is
significant, in Zones 3 and 5 respectively.
Such relative dating is supportive of a post­
1000 cal. BP chronologic range of the Core
2 pollen assemblage. Finally, a modern age
of the surface sample (1 cmbs) cannot be
assumed.
It may be important in this
respect that not trace of disturbance from
adjacent Highway 155 construction is

as is the case in Core 3 (below).
Pollen Assemblage Zone 1 (1-21 cmbs),
post-1000 cal. BP (?), Pinus, Quercus, Salix,
Poaceae, Stellaria.
This singular pollen assemblage zone
exhibits very high values of Pinus (to a
maximum of 55.8%) and high values of
Quercus (to a maximum of 31.6%).
Significant level of Poaceae (to a maximum
of 30.7%) and Stellaria (to a maximum of
14.5%) pollen are also expressed. Only low
values (ca. 2%) of Betula, Carya, Ulmus,
and Salix occur, although these trees achieve
a rational expression. Less continuous are
traces of Celtis, Fagus, Ilex, Alnus, and
Fraxinus amongst the arboreal pollen types.
Finally,
a
sporadically
significant
representation by Rhus (to a maximum of
8.0%) is noted. Minor herbaceous types are
variously represented at the site, and include
Asteraceae, the Senecio-Arctium type,
Cirsium, Centaurea, Ambrosia, Compositae
liguliflorae, Mentha, Trifolium, Rosaceae
(not
Prunus),
Umbelliferae,
Caryophyllaceae, Chenopodiaceae, Vicia,
and Ephedra (a long-distance type).
Of
these minor herbs, only composites and
chenopods achieve a nearly rational
representation. Aquatic pollen types here
include low values of Cyperaceae, Typha,
Polygonum persecaria, and an isolate of the
distinctive Coleogeton-type.
Tree pollen
averages about 65% within this zone.

Pollen Core 3

Six AMS dates from this core are used to
infer the dating of seven pollen zones of the
middle channel deposit at Caddo Creek,
although an upper disturbed horizon above
33 cmbs is correlated after sedimentary
characteristics, with the support of two
Atomic age AMS dates, to the period of
initial Highway 155 construction around
1940 (Zone 6). In addition to actual dating
and sediment mottling due to disturbance,
this upper correlation is supported by a

514

coincidence of an absolute maximum of
ruderal
(human
disturbance)
pollen
indicators (Chenopodiaceae) and forbs
(Asteraceae) which would be emphatically
promoted by such construction (note such
curves in samples at 2.5 cm increments), as
well as inference of a major change of
pollen taphonomy, from water to air or
gravity deposition, itself caused by this
temporary obstruction of drainage.
This
obstruction of water-flow produces artificial
fluctuations in the representation of local
floodplain (Quercus+) vs. regional upland
(Pinus-Quercus-)
pollen
types.
Inferentially, a resumption of water flow,
ultimately from uplands, results in a final
rise of Pinus, further enhanced in Atomic
times with a development of pine plantations
in the region. Below these anthropogenic
floral changes, acomplex vegetation
historical sequence of 6,700-year time-depth
is described (Zones 1-5). Zones defined on
the basis of samples separated by multiple
centuries (due to low rates of sedimentation)
are assigned minimal chronologic ranges.
Pollen Assemblage Zone 1 (245-200 cmbs),
6740-4875 cal. BP (minimally), Carya,

dominates this zone, although Quercus is
important (37.2% maximum).
Minor

Betula, Ulmus, Fagus, Ilex, Sambucus,
Alnus, and Salix. Important herbs include
Poaceae (14.7% maximum) and Asteraceae

and declining) dominate this zone. Carya
pollen is less significant, and averages about
10%, while amongst other trees, low values
of Tilia, Ulmus, Celtis, Rhus, Fagus,
Carpinus, Myrica, and Ilex also occur.
Other important herbs include Poaceae
(20.3% maximum). Ruderal types achieve
a low but rational representation as reflected
in Chenopodiaceae, while other minor
herbaceous types include Senecio-Arctium,
Cirsium, Ranunculaceae, Umbelliferae, and
Rhododendron.
Pollen Assemblage Zone 4 (140-70 cmbs),
2620-955 cal. BP, Quercus, Pinus. Both
Quercus (24.4% maximum), and Pinus
pollen (rising to 37.9%) dominate this zone.
Carya pollen is less significant, but achieves
minor highs at 140 and 85 cmbs (17.9 and
16.0% maxima, respectively), while
amongst other trees, low values of Ulmus,
Celtis, Rhus, Fagus, and Salix occur.
Important herbaceous types include Poaceae
(13.5% maximum) and Asteraceae (25.0%

low but rational representation after
Ambrosia (ca. 1%) and Chenopodiaceae,
which achieves minor highs of 2.6 and 2.4%
at 140 and 85 cmbs, respectively. Minor

Inter-core correlations are evident from the
above, which support a significant
chronologic alignment of variation in the
main tree and herb pollen types. Identical
trends are particularly evident in a general
decline of Carya, and a converse rise of
Pinus over several millennia. A maximum
of forb (Asteraceae and Ambrosia)
vegetation is likewise reconstructed in both
creek pollen cores during the Fourth
Millennium (cal.) BP. After this period,
Asteraceae undergoes a continuous decline
at Caddo Creek until about 700/800 (cal.)
BP, when a minor rise of composites is
registered in PAZ 3 in Core 1 and PAZ 5 in
Core 3. A minor, secondary rise in Carya
also occurs in Core 3 around this time, but
this event is not clearly discerned in Core 1
(which is poorly resolved in this aspect). A
significant level of Stellaria pollen
registration, along with high Pinus levels
and generally lower levels of Carya are
main traits tentatively aligning pollen zones

Chronological correlations of the same
pollen zonation of the well-dated Cores 1
and 3 in the Caddo Creek valley are a
powerful test as to the reliability as well as
reproducibility of the alluvial pollen data
from lower energy situations.
This is
particularly true given the statistical
characteristics of the CONISS-based cluster
analysis, which tends to split rather than
lump stratigraphic pollen assemblages zones
(Grimm 1987).
Apparent chronologic
differences in correlated pollen zonal
expression in Cores 1 and 3 are evident
(Table A-8), but such differences reflect
limits of long (multi-century) time
increments between samples as imposed by
low sedimentation rates.

Comparison of Near-Coeval
Pollen Samples

A particularistic comparison of pollen
samples from Cores 1 and 3 first depends on
the identification of spectra from each core
in
close
chronometric
proximity.
Comparative pollen spectra of less than 100
years difference in (estimated) age are
selected for this purpose. One century is a
minimal empirical limit of two-Sigma
values after the AMS dating method under
ideal conditions. Additional uncertainties
as to dating of the upper aspect of Core 1
thus make comparison of these spectra
undesirable using this standard. Moreover
in Core 3, a break in the pollen sequence
around one meter below surface limits
comparisons with further parts of Core 1.
More secure comparisons after these criteria
are limited to six spectra in Table A-9. In
this, pollen types with high base
percentages, including Pinus, Quercus, and
Carya, Poaceae, and Asteraceae amongst
the herbs are considered, as these provide a
better statistical basis for comparison. In
addition, Salix, a minor tree, is considered,
as this may be over-represented on the
riparian margin. Finally, Stellaria, a minor
herb, is considered, as this is important for a
relative dating of Core 2. A particularistic
test of the synchronicity of its relative
representation is thus desirable.
A tabulation of major coeval pollen
representation levels reveals a highly
comparative pattern among the thirty main
taxon and spectrum combinations. Twentyseven of these paired values fall within 95%,
1/1 confidence interval as defined by baselevel percentages and absolute pollen counts
(Faegri et al. 1989). Exceptions are limited
to Asteraceae (which is better represented in
Core 3 at 180 and 160 cmbs) and Pinus (also
better represented in Core 3, at 85 cm).
Because these are non-local types, and the
local pollen of the Salix-type is better
represented in Core 1 at the valley margin, it

Technical Report No. 174202

is inferred that such differences reflect
higher relative levels of gravity deposition
of pollen (never fully airborne nor
significantly transported by water) by
riparian verge species at the more terrestrial
(Core 1) locale.
Along these lines, somewhat higher Quercus
levels evident in Core 1 at 106, 280, and 295
cm depth might reflect a registration of
riparian oaks (Q. nigra and Q. phellos).
Effects of local over-representation due to
gravity-deposition by riparian types after
terrestrialization are in fact most emphatic
within the Core 3 sequence, whereby Salix
first becomes an important type in Atomic
times (Zone 7). This event is demonstrably
after the restriction of water-flow from the
highway, which partially dams the drainage
of Caddo Creek, giving rise to aquatic
communities of Typha domingensis west of
the highway (upstream) and telmatic Salix
and Quercus nigra to the east (downstream).
Along these lines, it is notable that Stellaria
representation, although identical in its trend
in both sequences, is consistently if
moderately better represented in Core 3 vis à
vis Core 1.
Stellaria is efficiently
transported by wind, and is a regional type
as defined in the pollen study from Big
Sandy Creek in Upshur County (Albert
2007), where it generally co-varies with
Pinus as a favored sub-canopy element of
pine woodlands (Bratton 1976). In spite of
such minor differences, it is important that
the main woodland and grassland types
(Pinus, Quercus, Carya, and Poaceae) often
achieve a symmetry of representation
approaching a 95%, 2/5 confidence level
(values lie within 20% of each other, after
statistical noise).
This would further
indicate that such types might be used for
quantitative ecology studies, including
natural history reconstruction.

Natural History

A natural history of the Caddo Creek valley
and
41AN38
environs
is
made
reconstructable by the demonstration of a
rational program of dating and pollen data
analysis. Pollen data from Cores 1 and 3
Caddo Creek will be considered in tandem,
but remarks will be made first regarding the
local vegetation situation elucidated in upper
aspects of Core 2 from the 41AN38 seep.
As hypothesized above, the pollen zone
from Core 2, comprised of eleven viable
samples from a depth of 21 cm to surface,
dates principally to the last 1000 years.
Probable time-elapse between samples is
thus something in the order of one century,
while individual 1 cm thick samples
probably relate to pollination over multiple
decades.
In this time frame, little
significant change in vegetation occurs
outside of minimally significant oscillations
of Pinus vs. Quercus, as well as Poaceae
and an occasional appearance of moderate
values of Rhus and other local species of
trees and herbs. The pollen spectrum in fact
is typical of a post-oak savanna type with an
admixture of pine (note proximity of this
vegetation zone to the east of the site).
Also compared to the creek valley sites,
much less Asteraceae occurs.
A relative
poverty of this common forb pollen type is
related to a lower influence of prairie
vegetation patches atop the Trawick series,
which are proximal to the valley but not the
archaeological site. It is thought also that

Stellaria is a regional type after its
dispersion characteristics and associations
with pine-dominated woodlands, which
would strengthen its use in relative pollen
dating (cf. Albert 2007). Notably, Stellaria
is also not common to the archaeological
locale today.
A most characteristic prehistoric disturbance
pollen taxon defined by the author at the
Caddo mound site of 3HE40 (Albert 2004),
as well as Mississippian archaeological sites
(Peacock and Reese 2003) is the
Chenopodiaceae-type. This occurs in most
levels in Core 2, but as low values usually
(~0.5-1%), except in some lower levels,
where a maximum value of 3.5% is
registered at 12 cmbs. By depth and logical
date, it is tempting to associate this
Chenopodiaceae maximum with the
41AN38 Caddo occupation. No definitive
cultivation indicators occur here, however
(Dull 2006 and Eubanks 1997).
It is
probable in any event that long-term Caddo
impact on the environment is negligible. A
singular change in ecology indicated in the
pollen data from the 41AN38 seep is
reflected, however, in pre-recent (4 cmbs)
finds of Coleogeton (false-pondweed). This
local aquatic type certainly derives from the
seep, and is strongly indicative of an
alkaline hydrology (possibly as affected by
regional marls). Regardless of moderately
acidic conditions read after soil maps, it is
likely that local (41AN38) soil conditions
were more basic at certain times in the past.

Technical Report No. 174202

Archeological Investigations at the Lang Pasture Site (41AN38) in the Upper Neches River Basin of East Texas
Texas Department of Transportation

From Caddo Creek itself, conclusive
evidence has been collected indicating a
major decline of Carya, in relative pollen
terms from 52.7% before six thousand years
ago to only trace values in the early part of
the 20th Century. During this same time, a
major increase in Pinus from negligible
values to about 35% of total land pollen is
also registered.
This increase may
sometimes be promoted by, but is never
significantly negated by climate forcing.
Rather, a step-like increase in Pinus endures
through the long-term (until artificial
transforms in Core 3, Zone 6). This pattern
is
strongly
suggestive
of
gradual
acidification of regional soils commonly
inferred in North Hemispheric Holocene
bio-stratigraphy (this is a product of
increases in precipitation and leaching in
Global terms after Ice Ages, which are
drier). This is regionally possible due to
tendencies of most upland pine species in
East Texas to increase local soil ph through
needle-fall. As soils acidify, the relative
prominence of pine increases, leading to still
more localized acidification (cf. Diggs et al.
2006). The present study demonstrates that
such acidification is irreversible over
Holocene timescales.
Due to generally low levels of ruderal pollen
representation as well as an absence of
evidence for substantial cultivation, it is
probable that other major changes in the
Caddo Creek diagrams reflect climate
forcing. Most obvious of such changes is
the major rise of forbs and grasses in Zone
2, where Asteraceae attains an absolute
maximum of 41.1%, and non-tree pollen as
a whole forms a majority.
After AMS
dating, this rise begins a little before four
thousand years ago and peaks a little before
three thousand years before present. The
beginning of the Pinus rise also dates to this
upper part of this zone, which further
supports an inference of warm and a dry
climate, conditions that promote forbs.
After pollen response surface data from
eastern North America, it seems likely that a
summer temperature increase by more than

Technical Report No. 174202

1 degree Celsius at this time, else there is a
decline
in
effective
(non-winter)
precipitation in the order of 100 mm per
annum or more (Bartlein et al. 1986),
although these are inferences made
conservatively, as they based on analog sites
lacking major inlet channels (which might
affect relative pollen recruitment). Other
elements of the Fourth Millennium (cal.) BP
include isolated grains in three separate
spectra of Euphorbiaceae, a taxon
(unproductive of pollen) typical of blackland
prairie formations to the west. Although
the more common Poaceae grains are less
than distinctive with respect to specific
morphology, an expansion of little bluestem
and Indian grass species is probably
reflected in this zone.
Close-interval
sampling subsequently attests to the
empirical reality of a decline in non-tree
pollen after three thousand years ago,
generally coeval to a major mesic climate
phase (Zone 3) at Big Sandy Creek in
Upshur County, Texas (Albert 2007). It is
likely that wetter conditions here have led to
a contraction of grasslands, although this
palynological climate signal is overpatterned by a hypothesized pedogenic rise
of pine. A secondary decline of non-tree
pollen then occurs after 800 years ago.
Importantly, this decline is also coeval with
a mesic phase (Zone 6) at Big Sandy Creek,
and together with the latter data strongly
suggests that somewhat cooler or wetter
climate conditions prevailed broadly during
Late Caddo and post-Contact times (Little
Ice Age). Relatively modest (ca. 30%) nontree pollen values of Euro-American date at
Caddo Creek (around 40 cmbs) further show
by way of comparison that prehistoric
vegetation was relatively open, with a
mosaic of grasslands, woodlands, and
savannas. In fact, the extent of grassland a
little before three thousand years ago was
probably greater than that witnessed in
modern times, even after significant EuroAmerican impacts.
Compared to pollen stratigraphy in the Big
Sandy Creek valley, that at Caddo Creek

519

Appendix A: Middle to Late Holocene Palynology of Vibra-Cores from 41AN38 and Caddo Creek

produces a more complex data pattern
involving a wider variety of plant species
and genera reacting importantly not only to
climate forcing and fire, but also major
pedogenic changes which may be
characterized as gradual and unidirectional
acidification. Since base conditions at Big
Sandy Creek are more generally hyperacidic, given a prevalence of highly leached
sandy substrates in the valley (with ph
values approaching four), it is inferred that
the latter sequence is largely insensitive to
increasing acidity vectors by 3500 (cal.) BP.
The same acidity leads also to a poverty of
Carya and high levels of Betula (which
remains sensitive to climate changes after
moisture requirements).
Rather than
reflecting principally bi-directional climatic
forcing, the 6,700 year pollen sequence at
Caddo Creek thus indicates a unidirectional
geologic as well as more variable climatic
vectors. A richer human subsistence base
provided by a more diverse environment
densely vegetated at times by highly
productive Carya might also allow for
different prehistoric (both Caddo and PreCaddo) human interactions with the
environment.
This cultural ecological
history is now considered in a detailed
manner, focusing upon anthropogenic
indicator horizons in the main valley pollen
diagrams.
A.13

Cultural Ecological History

The valley of Caddo Creek presents a
mosaic of vegetation types through history
ranging from extensive hickory woodlands
to grasslands and oak savannas in the period
before 4000 (cal.) BP.
Judging from
modern vegetation surveys in West
Arkansas, it is more likely that woodland
conditions promoting hickory are semi-open
as opposed to closed canopy (Jurney and
Stahle 2004). The West Arkansas data thus
affirm the definition by Tharp (1926) of
Carya texana and other hickories as mid­
seral species in East Texas, promoted by
moderate disturbance. In terms of huntergatherer economy, this earlier epoch is a

520

highly productive one, for hickory is a major
food source, producing about 23,000 Kcalories per tree. This is much more than
oak (or any other deciduous element,
excepting pecan), which produces little more
than 1,000 K-calories per tree (Brown
1988), while processing requirements for
hickory nuts are also considerably lower
than those of acorns (Tull 1999). By virtue
of the principle of trophic levels, food
resources for Native populations from fauna
should be considerably less than that from
flora (by a factor of more than ten after
calculations by Brown 1988 respecting
Aquilla Lake environments of Hill County
in North Central Texas). Nonetheless, a
presence of grasslands, open woodlands, and
forests in valley bottoms would produce a
variety of game animals for exploitation,
with suitable environments for both bison
and deer.
After pollen data, this wide resource base
becomes more restrictive during the Fourth
Millennium (cal.) BP, when grasses expand
and hickories significantly contract. It is
important
to
note
that
ruderal
Chenopodiaceae (which do occur in dry
grasslands) does not achieve a rational
representation at this time.
In fact,
Chenopodiaceae in Trans-Mississippian
grasslands are often attributable to human
disturbance (Schauwecker and MacDonald
2003), rather than a natural condition.
At the beginning of the Third Millennium
(cal.) B.P., grasses began a long decline as
woodlands became increasingly dominated
by pine. Nonetheless, a secondary rise of
Carya to 17.9% at 140 cmbs was
accompanied by a high in ruderal
Chenopodiaceae of 2.6%, when the latter
taxon also first achieved a rational
representation.
Chenopod values around
1% continued under arboreal conditions
until about 1,000 (cal.) B.P., when tertiary
rises of Carya (to 16.0%) and
Chenopodiaceae (to 2.4%) are evident.
Prehistoric maxima of Chenopodiaceae
pollen of about two-to-three percent are not

Archeological Investigations at the Lang Pasture Site (41AN38) in the Upper Neches River Basin of East Texas

inordinately lower than a modern maximum
(prior to Highway 155 construction) of
7.2%.
This association of a syn-anthropic with
higher hickory pollen levels amid
increasingly afforested conditions provides
support for a syn-anthropic origin of the
rational Chenopodiaceae response, which is
expressed contrary to primary ecologic bias
(this ruderal should increase with
grasslands).
Its regular representation is
due to fact that amongst anthropogenic
indicators, chenopods share high levels of
pollen production and an efficient airborne
distribution of pollen grains (Behre and
Kucan 1986). Of course, this also enhances
its representation levels on land surfaces
subject to surface run-off. An association
of this taxon with higher hickory pollen
values then not only supports modern
observations of Carya ecology (Tharp
(1926), but also a hypothesis for an
anthropogenic origin of some prehistoric
hickory rises, which is posited as a
sylvicultural expansion fostered first by
Woodland peoples, and then by the Early or
Middle Caddo, achieved through an artificial
opening of canopy space, ultimately as part
of a general adaptive pattern to increase
hickory nut yields through moderate
disturbance (Delcourt and Delcourt 2004).
Indeed, two coeval Carya rises are also
observed at Big Sandy Creek in periods of
moderate disturbance or recovery from
major fires (Albert 2007).
Along these
lines, a long-term (pedogenic) decline of
hickory, a major food source in the Middle
Archaic (Story et al. 1990), might induce
later peoples to increase its distribution and
production through minor clearances,
possibly aided by fire setting, which may
also further contribute to a rise of pine (Spalt
and Reifsnyder 1962).
This hypothesis generally supports models
of later Woodland and earlier Caddo
subsistence that posit an importance of
hickory nut exploitation in many regions of
eastern Texas after macro-botanical

Technical Report No. 174202

evidence (Dering 1993 1994). At Hurricane
Hill (41HP106) in Hopkins County, Texas
for example, hickory comprises about 92%
of finds even in Middle Caddo times, where
only one gram of maize and a single squash
rind is observed (Goldborer and Pertulla
1999). The Chenopodiaceae pollen type
also includes amaranths such as pigweed,
which is present at earlier Caddo sites such
as Spider Knoll in Delta County (Dering
1994), along with Polygonaceae, considered
generally as an anthropogenic indicator
(Behre 1981). Notably, a sole pollen grain
of this type at Caddo Creek occurs in
Woodland times, along with the above
Chenopodiaceae maximum.
It has been noted that no Zea is identified in
the Caddo Creek valley pollen cores.
Direct evidence of cultivation is thus
lacking, although it is further noted that by
way of comparison, Zea in cores from the
Tennessee valley, from regions under
considerable Native cultivation, is an
uncommon pollen type (Delcourt et al.
1986).
Thus less considerable maize
cultivation might not register unless a very
intensive pollen sampling strategy is
adopted. With a view to models of maize
cultivation in Late Caddo times, macrobotanical and isotope evidence point to an
increased consumption of corn in East Texas
(Pertulla 1996, 2008). Particular to Caddo
Creek, Chenopodiaceae pollen declines at
this time (<1%) alongside Carya, although
Ambrosia, a syn-anthropic type, achieves a
more rational representation in approximate
Late Caddo times.
Rather than increasing, syn-anthropic pollen
indications thus become more ambiguous
after corn cultivation is (thought to be)
established. It may be that a greater later
Caddo focus on maize production seen in
other regions (e.g., Gardner 1997 for Red
River valley) need not relate to higher total
human impact on the environment.
At
Caddo Creek, such impacts might actually
contract as more economic effort is placed
on small garden plots and away from wider

521

woodland
clearances
that
are
palynologically more visible.
A shift in
character of minor anthropogenic indicators
from less Chenopodiaceae to more
Ambrosia might relate to subtle changes in
the character of human impacts that are at
present difficult to distinguish, due to their
low amplitude. A slightly higher amplitude
combination of this type is indeed seen in
one spectrum from 12 cmbs in Core 2
(middle part of post-1000 cal. BP zone) by
41AN38, which registers 4.5% Ambrosia
and 3.5% Chenopodiaceae.
It seems
plausible that this mid-zonal spectrum from
the seep reflects a local product of moderate
Caddo agricultural impacts that are
registered regionally in the better-dated
valley cores.

Conclusions

A use of pollen data to infer human-plant
interactions in the Caddo Creek valley and a
seep adjacent to the archaeological site of
41AN38 has met with some success. Given
the pioneer nature of the study, it is
unsurprising that some major unexpected
findings are apparent. Most important of
these is a clear documentation of a multi­
millennial decline of Carya and rise of
Pinus that must reflect a gradual
acidification of soil substrates in the study
region. Very low Pinus values seen in this
period are of particular interest in that pine
is a productive and extensively transported
pollen type.
It near-absence in earlier
Holocene sediments indicates that the
proximity of mixed-pine woodland mapped
east of the study region (Diggs et al. 2006
and Bureau of Economic Geology 2000) is
at a far remove, and has expanded into its
present position over the long-term. After
comparisons of growing stock volume and
pollen expression from surfaces in the
eastern United States ((Delcourt et al. 1984),
it is estimated that this early zonal remove of
mixed-pine forest is greater than 50 km; in
other words, there is a major shift of
vegetation belts in the region in the past six
thousand years. Altogether, these findings

522

are important for present forestry, as the
above would indicate that acidification
caused by mono-cultural pine plantations in
modernity is irreversible in practical terms.
The quite different environment before four
thousand years ago is much more productive
for human economy, which in times of
decline might adapt to a reduction of
resources through an adoption of first
sylviculture (by 3,000 cal. B.P. or earlier?)
and then agriculture (by 1,200 cal. B.P. or
earlier?). A further find of interest is that
the prehistoric vegetation landscape of the
Caddo Creek valley is relatively open, if not
at times more open than the present
condition, particularly as forced by a xeric
Fourth Millennium B.P. climate.
Caddo
impact on woodlands and grasslands is
moderate, whereby a non-employment of the
plow may be a factor (in Old World
palynology, the range and magnitude of
agricultural indicators is greater due to the
use of animal traction, Behre 1981).
Moreover, there is no discernable
relationship between a more intensive
cultivation of maize probable in later Caddo
times and a higher registration of syn­
anthropic pollen. In fact, Woodland period
impacts inferred to be sylvicultural are as
great as those of the early Caddo. Such
impacts scarcely affect pollen zonation,
which is first determined by pedogenic and
then by climatic change.
From a methodological point-of-view,
comparisons of pollen zones and individual
spectra from alluvium of different aspect
and granulometry indicate that, although
pollen concentration in alluvium is highly
variable, relative pollen recruitment (i.e.,
percentage data) is insensitive to such
differences, in both the present study as well
as earlier work sponsored by Texas
Department of Transport Environmental
Affairs Division at 41UR77, to the northeast
(Albert 2007). This would imply that the
differential sorting of pollen by size under
different water velocities detected in
controlled flume experiments (e.g., Brush

Technical Report No. 174202

Archeological Investigations at the Lang Pasture Site (41AN38) in the Upper Neches River Basin of East Texas
Texas Department of Transportation

and Brush 1972) is not necessarily operative
in real world situations. Indeed, multiple
years of observation of actual pollen
transported by water in fluvia from Exeter
County, England show uniform pollen
composition in respective water columns
from a range of basins types under different
flood stages (Brown et al. 2007).
After analytic experiences of the author, as
well as lab- and field-work of Holmes
(1990), macro- and micro-topic graphic
effects in most slack water alluvial deposits
prevent sorting. By the latter, it is meant
that the grain and micro-undulation of
alluvium acts as a trap unless surfaces are
comprised largely of very level fines (clays
and fine silts). This catchment prevents an
effective sorting of pollen in most alluvial
situations. Respecting macro-topographic
effects, one can also observe that many
depositional environments, including ox­
bows (e.g. Delcourt et al. 1986; Albert
2007), as well as undulating over-bank
deposits
of
the
present
study,

Technical Report No. 174202

also act as pollen traps at a larger scale. In
such cases, pollen is differentially
represented is only if it is already sorted
prior to site recruitment, presumably when
water flow rates are low (Allen 1965).
Along these lines, more sophisticated flume
experiments of Holmes (1990) show there is
no sorting of pollen in water flows greater
than 30 cm per second, while such sorting is
fully effected only at quite low rates of
about 5 cm per second. In real world terms,
Holmes finds that these conditions occur
most often in sediment-laden embayments
and lakes.
Even should a small-order
drainage exhibit such rates regularly, this
would not actually result in differential
pollen sorting in sediment, as a great
majority (91+%) is transported by water
during flood stage (Brown 2007).
The
implications of the present and other
(laboratory and analog) studies are that
properly selected alluvial sites can provide
data for environmental study far beyond the
limited geographic extent of traditional bog
sites.

Abstract

Optical luminescence dating at the single
grain level was applied to coarse quartz
grains extracted from twenty seven samples
taken from two stratigraphic columns from
the site 41AN38, Texas.
All samples
behaved well from an OSL perspective, but
analysis of sample replicates indicates they
have
undergone
post-depositional
disturbance and/or incomplete sediment
resetting prior to burial. Whilst attempts
have been made to isolate what may be the
burial ages, inconsistencies down profile
from this tightly sampled dataset indicate this
has not been entirely successful. Thus, best
estimates of the sample’s burial age range
from 610 ± 40 years (Shfd07145) to 6,630 ±
360 years for the first sampled column and
130 ± 20 years (Shfd07156) to 7980 ± 410
years (Shfd07169). Further analysis of the
component related age calculations with
other site information is recommended as a
possible way to improve the site chronology.
B.2

Introduction

Twenty seven samples in opaque PVC
tubing from site 41AN38 northeast, Texas,
USA were submitted for luminescence
dating by Dr. David Kelley (Coastal
Environments Inc.). All luminescence work
was carried out at the Sheffield Centre for
International Drylands Research (SCIDR)
luminescence laboratory. The samples are
assumed not to have been exposed to
sunlight during sampling or transportation to
the laboratory. Upon arrival, each sample
was allocated a Sheffield lab number (Table
B-1). This report provides a brief summary
of the procedures employed and results
obtained for samples.
In order to derive an optically stimulated
luminescence (OSL) age both the

Technical Report No. 174202

palaeodose (De - the amount of absorbed
dose since the sample was buried) and the
dose rate (the estimated radiation flux for
the sedimentary bodies) have to be
determined. Aitken (1998) gives a detailed
explanation of both these parameters. To
calculate an age, the palaeodose (expressed
in Grays) is divided by the annual dose rate
(Grays/yr). An inherent assumption in these
age calculations is that the sediment was
fully reset or ‘bleached’ by exposure to
sunlight during the last transport event or
whilst in situ prior to burial and that no postdepositional sediment disturbance has
occurred. As part of this investigation,
efforts have been taken to establish if these
sediments have been bleached or disturbed
by, for example, bioturbation. As the OSL
signal measured with a standard aliquot is an
average of 2000 grains the true distribution
of De values within a sample may be
masked. This is of particular significance in
heterogeneously dosed samples (e.g. poorly
reset/bleached) in which grains with a high
De signal will dominated the signal at the
expense of grains containing a true burial
De. Measurement of the accumulated dose
from individual grains obviates this
problem. Thus this latter single grain
approach was adopted for this study.
B.3

Dose Rate Analysis

Naturally occurring potassium (K), thorium
(Th), rubidium (Rb) and uranium (U) are the
main contributors of dose to sedimentary
quartz.
The concentrations of these
elements were determined by inductively
coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP) at
SGS laboratories Ontario Canada (Table B­
2).
Elemental concentrations were
converted to annual dose rates using data
from Adamiec and Aitken (1998), Marsh et
al. (2002), and Aitken (1988).

This took into account attenuation factors
relating to sediment grain sizes used, density
and palaeomoisture. It has been assumed
that the samples formed part of a thick
homogeneous unit with no gamma
contribution (other than from cosmogenic
sources) being received by the samples from

562

o

other
unsampled
sedimentary
units.
Attenuation of dose by moisture used the
present-day moisture values as measured in
the laboratory, with a  2% error to
incorporate seasonal and longer-term
fluctuations in moisture which the samples
may have endured since burial (Table B-2).

Appendix B: Quartz Optical Dating of Sediment Samples 41AN38

The contribution to dose rates from cosmic
Sources were calculated using the
expression published in Prescott and Hutton
(1994; Table 2).
It should be noted
however that as most of the samples were
collected from less than 50 cm from the
surface the cosmic dose rate calculation will
be an under-estimate as it does no include
the soft component (Precott and Hutton
1994). The dose rates calculated are based
on analyses of the sediment sampled at the
present day. This assumption is only valid if
no movement and/or reprecipitation of the
four key elements has taken place since
sediment burial and the adjacent sediments
to those sampled had similar dose rates.
Analysis of the ICP data indicates no
increase in leachable K or U with depth
from the two sample columns and the U:Th
ratio is within the norm for a natural sample.
Further analysis would have to be
undertaken to establish whether the latter is
true and if radioactive disequilibrium is
present in the dose rate.
B.4

Palaeodose Determination

The samples were prepared under subdued
red lighting following the procedure to

extract and clean quartz outlined in Bateman
and Catt (1996). Prepared aliquots of the
samples were taken from within a maximum
size range of 125-180 m. Samples then
underwent measurements at the single grain
level using a Risø TL DA-15 single grain
laser luminescence reader with radiation
doses administered using a calibrated
90
strontium beta source.
Grains were
mounted in 300�m pits with 100 pits per
9.6 mm stainless steel aliquot. A focussed
532 nm Nd:YVO4 laser provided the
stimulation and luminescence detection was
through a Hoya U-340 filter. All samples
were analysed using the single aliquot
regenerative (SAR) approach (Murray and
Wintle 2000), in which an interpolative
growth curve is constructed using data
derived from repeated measurements of a
single aliquot which has been given various
laboratory irradiations (Figure B-1).
The
last irradiation dose replicated the first to
check if sensitivity changes cause by
repeated measurement of the same aliquot
had been correctly monitored and corrected
for by the SAR protocol ((known as the
recycling ratio).

Figure B-1. Examples of Single Grain OSL Data for Sample Shfd07148 (a) OSL Decay of
Naturally Acquired Signal and (b) SAR Growth Curves.

Within the SAR protocol a preheat of
240 °C for 10 seconds prior to OSL
measurement was used to remove unstable
signal generated by laboratory irradiations.
This preheat was derived experimentally
using a dose recovery test with a range of

564

preheat temperatures (after Murray and
Wintle, 2003). As Figure B-2 shows the
240 °C for 10 preheat recovers the 40s
exposure to the laboratory beta radiation
source within errors and has recycling ratios
within 10%.

Figure B-2. Results of Dose Recovery Test on Shfd07147Used to Determine Appropriate
Preheat for SAR Protocol. (a) Results of different preheat recovering a 40 s exposure to
the laboratory beta radiation source; (b) recycling ratio of different preheats.

With all single grain OSL analysis many
grains exhibit insufficient OSL signal to be
utilised and/or are too poorly behaved for
the De to be accurately measured. De values
from individual grains were only accepted
where their recycling ratio was 1  0.20,
they exhibited good growth with dose and
the error on the test dose used within the
SAR protocol was less than 20%. As Table
B-3 shows, for sample Shfd07147 300
grains were measured of which 25% yielded
grains which met these criteria. For sample
Shfd07161 of the 400 grains measured 16%
yielded grains which met these criteria.
These return rates are high compared to
other sites within Texas and further a field
(typically <10% of grains yield usable data)
indicating that the quartz grains from
41AN38 are behaving as good natural
dosimeters with relatively high sensitivity to
dose.

Sedimentary Bleaching
Behaviour

The effects of incomplete bleaching of the
sediment during the last period of transport
or exposure in situ can be profound.
Typically, poorly bleached sediments retain

Technical Report No. 174202

a significant level of residual signal from
previous phases of sedimentary cycling,
leading to inherent inaccuracies in the
calculation of a palaeodose value. By
plotting the replicate data for each sample as
a probability density function some
assessment of whether older or younger
material has been included in the sample
measurements can be made (Figure 3). In
principle a well bleached unpost­
depositionally disturbed sample should have
replicate palaeodose (De) data which is
normally distributed and highly reproducible
(See Bateman et al. 2003, Fig 3; Bateman et
al 2007a).
Where post-depositional
disturbance or incomplete bleaching prior to
sample burial has occurred skewing of this
distribution may occur and/or replicate
reproducibility may be lower (Bateman et al
2007a; Bateman et al. 2007b). In the case of
poorly bleached material skewing should be
evident with a high De tail (e.g. Olley et al.
2004).
As Figure B-3 (and Appendix 1) shows the
single grain data distributions all vary and
none form a tight normal distribution.

Appendix B: Quartz Optical Dating of Sediment Samples 41AN38

For all samples the De distribution is much
broader/non-normal than would be expected
for a well-bleached undisturbed sediment
with OD values in excess of 50% for all
samples (Table B-3; Bateman et al. 2007a).
Samples from near the surface clearly have
large numbers of zero dosed grains and
extremely high OD values (>400%). Whilst
some of the zero-dosed grains may be due to
instrumental error it has been argued that
where significant numbers of zero dose
grains have been measured this is indicative
of grains which have recently been exhumed
and returned to depth by, for example,
bioturbation (see Heimsath 2002; Bateman
et al 2007). As Figure 4 demonstrates, the
number of zero-dosed grains found
decreases with sampled depth as does the
scatter represented by OD (Table B-3
above). This conforms to the fact pedogenic
overturning and bioturbation are most
intense in the uppermost horizons and
decrease in intensity with depth (See
Bateman et al. 2007b, Fig. 8).

There also appears to be a significance
difference between the two sampled
columns in terms of the amount of this
disturbance (Figure B-4), with the column
incorporating
field
samples1602-1615
having much higher levels of zero-dosed
grains.
In addition to some samples having a
significant zero grain component, all
samples also include either multiple peaks
and/or are skewed with high De values
(Figure B-3, Table B-3).
Two possibilities exist to explain these.
Firstly, that this represents incomplete
resetting of previously accumulated OSL
signal due to incomplete exposure of the
sediment to sunlight prior to its reburial.
Alternatively, these high De values could
represent the movement upward of older
sediment into sediments of younger
antiquities by post-depositional disturbance.
Without other information about the
depositional style of the sediments, detailed
site stratigraphic and sedimentological/
archaeological evidence, it is impossible to
differentiate between these two possibilities
using only the OSL data. However this does
cause significant difficulties if one is trying
to isolate the samples’ burial age. Most
samples have one dominant De peak
reflecting a number of coincident De’s from
replicate. If peaks related to zero dosed
grains are excluded as representing recent
bioturbation, and it is assumed that
bioturbation
has
not
completely
homogenised the sediment (Bateman et al.
2003) then the dominant De peak may
represent the true burial age De. As such
steps have been made to try and statistically
isolate replicates associated only with this
dominant peak using the finite mixture
model of Galbraith and Green (1990). This
model assumes a natural sample dispersion
of 15% for the single grain data (Jacobs et
al. 2003). Table B-4 shows the results of the
finite mixture modelling and the number of
components recognised in each sample. All
samples had at least 3 components present.

Based on dominant De as calculated by finite mixture modelling of De replicates.

Thus from an OSL data perspective postdepositional disturbance of the sediments
associated with all the samples cannot be
ruled out and careful consideration of this
data in relation to other available site
information is recommended.

Age Calculation and
Conclusions

Ages are quoted in years from the present
day (2007) and are presented with one sigma
confidence intervals which incorporate
systematic uncertainties with the dosimetry
data, uncertainties with the palaeomoisture
content and errors associated with the De
determination. Table B-4 shows the ages
calculated for all the De component
extracted from finite mixture model except
those which returned a zero dose value or
for which the component represented less
than 10% of the grains measured. Figure
B-5 and the summary in Table B-6 and show
ages derived only from the dominant De
peak. These show multiple age reversals
(e.g. Shfd07146 and Shfd07147) and
significant age divergences between similar

Technical Report No. 174202

depths from the two columns sampled (e.g.
Shfd07149 and Shfd07162).
This suggests that the assumption made that
the dominant De peak has retained the true
burial age De maybe not valid. As the data
stands, there is some hint of increasing
antiquity with depth with ages ranging from
610 ± 40 years (Shfd07145) to 6,630 ± 360
years for the first sampled column and 130 ±
20 years (Shfd07156) to 7980 ± 410 years
(Shfd07169) for the second sampled
column. With additional chronological and
stratigraphical/archaeological information,
combined with using ages above and below
as constraining points (assuming the law of
super-position) it may be possible to better
select the De component which has the true
burial age from those calculated in Table B­
4 (See Bateman et al. 2007).
Such
approaches have also been developed for
radiocarbon using Bayesian statistics (see
Ramsey 2000, Ramsey 2007). This further
analysis is highly recommended.

Dose rate – Alpha counting, using the pairs
techniques, was used to determine U and Th
contents from the sherds and associated
sediments.
Flame photometry was
employed to measure K contents. While this
information, given in Tables C-2 and C-3,
can provide current alpha, beta and gamma
dose rates, it is accurate only insofar as
secular equilibrium can be assumed in the U
and Th decay chains and if the associated

Technical Report No. 174202

sediment is an accurate proxy for the
environmental dose rate.
The first assumption can be assessed to
some degree by comparing beta dose rates
determined directly by an independent
means, beta counting, with those calculated
from the alpha counting/flame photometry
results. Disagreement, particularly if K (a
major beta emitter) contents are small (as

581

Appendix C: Luminescence Dating of Ceramics from the Lang Pasture Site

they are for these samples), suggests some
disequilibrium between U and daughter
isotopes in the 238U decay chain. Significant
disagreement was found only for four
sherds. In these four cases the beta counting
provides a more accurate measure, assuming
that the disequilibrium occurred prior to the
deposition of the pottery. (Clays are prone
to such disequilibrium and so it probably
occurred prior to pottery manufacture.)
Other causes of disequilibrium, such as
those involving radon or radium daughters,
are less likely to be detected by this
comparison, but, at least in the case of radon
emanation, the state of equilibrium may be
relatively constant and therefore not a
problem for dose rate measures, such as
alpha counting, which measure activities and
not concentrations.

The second assumption was not assessed
directly by in situ measurements of gamma
dose rates, but the radioactivity of all 23
associated sediment samples is remarkably
similar (Table C-3).
This suggests
radioactivity across the site is fairly uniform
and the external dose rate is therefore not
likely to vary greatly from sherd to sherd.
There is also no evidence of increased U
activity in any of the sediments, which
might occur if U or Ra may have leached
from the pottery.
In sum, the determined dose rates for the
pottery and sediments appear to be
reasonably accurate and there is no evidence
these dose rates have changed markedly
through time.
Moisture contents were
assumed to be 80±20% of saturated values
for the pottery and 10±5 percent for the
sediments.

Cosmic radiation was determined following
Prescott and Hutton (1988). It is assumed
the current burial depths have not changed
more than about 5 cm through time. Lower
average burial depths will increase the ages
somewhat by reducing the external dose
rate, but the latter constitutes only about
25% of the total dose rate for most samples,
so the problem should not be very
significant.
The radioactivity of most of the ceramics
does not vary greatly, with one exception,
UW1721, which contained unusually high
concentrations of K. This ceramic was
likely made from a different clay source
than the others, possibly representing an
import.
Equivalent dose – Equivalent dose was
determined both by TL and by combined
IRSL/OSL, as described in the appendix

(Table C-4). The TL was measured from
relatively short plateau regions (where
equivalent dose does not vary with
temperature). The plateau extended beyond
340°C for only four samples, and on 10
samples it did not exceed 320°C (Table C­
5). This is attributed to the relatively low
firing temperature of the pottery. Sensitivity
change with heating, however, was minimal,
being significant at 2-sigma only for seven
samples. Anomalous fading was detected to
some degree on all but four sherds (no test
was performed on two others). Corrections
were applied following Huntley and
Lamothe (2001). Fading past the one week
storage time after irradiation, however, was
not considered significant for many of the
samples that did show fading. For these,
when computing the age, the uncorrected
results were used.

Appendix C: Luminescence Dating of Ceramics from the Lang Pasture Site

The purpose of the IR stimulation in the
IRSL/OSL measurements is to reduce the
feldspar signal, so that the subsequent OSL
signal stems largely from quartz. Feldspars
are stimulated by IR but quartz is not.
However, both minerals respond to the blue
stimulation used for OSL.
Because
feldspars are prone to anomalous fading,
removing its signal increases the probability
the OSL signal is free from fading.
However, because feldspars also respond to
blue stimulation, it is not certain that the IR
stimulation removes all the feldspar signal,
so that the subsequent OSL signal may still
contain a fading element. Table C-4 shows
that most of the samples did not have a
measurable IRSL signal. This suggests that
feldspars have only a weak presence. To
look at this further, an experiment using
pulsed OSL was employed on five samples,
UW1705, UW1710, UW1712. UW1717,
and UW1722.
In normal OSL
measurements, the luminescence signal is
collected during the stimulation.
With
pulsed OSL, the luminescence signal is
collected after the stimulating light is turned
off. It has been found that the time between
stimulation and luminescence emission for
feldspars is much shorter than it is for
quartz, about 5µsec and 30µsec respectively.
By setting the pulse for 10µsec off (i.e.,
luminescence signal not being collected) and
240µsec on, the feldspar signal can be
greatly reduced. A fading test using both
pulsed and non-pulsed data showed that
none of the signals faded, either pulsed or
non-pulsed, again suggesting a weak
feldspar presence. However, the equivalent
dose for pulsed and non-pulsed did differ on
all but one sample.

584

In all but one case, the pulsed equivalent
dose was more consistent with the TL
results than the non-pulsed, so it was used.
The differences in equivalent dose might
reflect difference in b-value (to be discussed
next), but b-value was not measured using a
pulsed signal for any of the samples.
Research into pulsed OSL is continuing, but
it does seem to produce more consistent
results than the non-pulsed data.
Alpha radiation is less efficient at producing
luminescence than beta or gamma radiation,
so a correction to take this into account must
be made. This is done by comparing
additive dose slopes using beta and alpha
irradiation, the slope ratio called b-value.
These values differ among TL, IRSL and
OSL (because the measured minerals differ)
and are shown in Table C-4. The values for
OSL are very typical of pure quartz samples,
the exception being the high value for
UW1721, a sample that was atypical in its
radioactivity as well.
In summary, the OSL signal does not seem
to reflect feldspar to a very large degree in
these samples, as evidence from the lack of
an IR signal in many samples, the typical
quartz b-values for OSL, and the lack of
evidence for fading of non-pulsed signals.
Nevertheless, where it was measured, pulsed
OSL did tend to produce results more
consistent with TL.

Appendix C: Luminescence Dating of Ceramics from the Lang Pasture Site

Ages – For most of the samples, the ages
calculated from TL and OSL did not
significantly differ, so a weighted average
was used to estimate the age (Table C-6).
Where fading was judged significant, the
corrected TL age was used in this
calculation.
Exceptions are discussed
briefly. For UW1703 and UW1705, the
OSL produced an unreasonably old age that
was significantly greater than the age for
TL, so only the TL was used to estimate the
age. The cause of the over-estimated OSL is
unknown. For UW1713, the ages from TL

and OSL differed significantly, but either
produced reasonable ages in terms of the
ages of other samples. Because there was
no reason to prefer one over the other, a
simple average was used as the estimate,
which explains the high error.
The ages range from AD1041 ± 77 to AD
1588 ± 16. It must be remembered that the
dates address when the ceramics were last
fired to at least 400°C, probably when they
were made. It does not necessarily address
the time of occupation.

Addendum: Procedures for Thermoluminescence Analysis of
Pottery
Sample Preparation -- Fine Grain

Equivalent Dose

The sherd is broken to expose a fresh
profile. Material is drilled from the center
of the cross-section, more than 2 mm from
either surface, using a tungsten carbide drill
tip. The material retrieved is ground gently
by a corundum mortar and pestle, treated
with HCl, and then settled in acetone for 2
and 20 minutes to separate the 1-8 µm
fraction. This is settled onto a maximum of
72 stainless steel discs.

The equivalent dose is determined by a
combination additive dose and regeneration
(Aitken 1985). Additive dose involves
administering incremental doses to natural
material. A growth curve plotting dose
against luminescence can be extrapolated to
the dose axis to estimate an equivalent dose,
but for pottery this estimate is usually
inaccurate because of errors in extrapolation
due to nonlinearity. Regeneration involves
zeroing natural material by heating to 450°C
and then rebuilding a growth curve with
incremental doses. The problem here is
sensitivity change caused by the heating. By
constructing both curves, the regeneration
curve can be used to define the extrapolated
area and can be corrected for sensitivity
change by comparing it with the additive
dose curve. This works where the shapes of
the curves differ only in scale (i.e., the
sensitivity change is independent of dose).
The curves are combined using the
“Australian slide” method in a program
developed by David Huntley of Simon
Fraser University (Prescott et al. 1993). The
equivalent dose is taken as the horizontal
distance between the two curves after a scale
adjustment for sensitivity change. Where
the growth curves are not linear, they are fit
to quadratic functions. Dose increments
(usually five) are determined so that the
maximum additive dose results in a signal
about three times that of the natural and the
maximum regeneration dose about five
times the natural. If the regeneration curve
has a significant negative intercept, which is
not expected given current understanding,
the additive dose intercept is taken as the
best, if not fully reliable approximation.

Glow-Outs
Thermoluminescence is measured by a
Daybreak
reader
using
a
9635Q
photomultiplier with a Corning 7-59 blue
filter, in N2 atmosphere at 1°C/s to 450°C.
A preheat of 240°C with no hold time
precedes each measurement.
Artificial
irradiation is given with a 241Am alpha
source and a 90Sr beta source, the latter
calibrated against a 137Cs gamma source.
Discs are stored at room temperature for at
least one week after irradiation before glow
out.
Data are processed by Daybreak
TLApplic software.

Fading Test
Several discs are used to test for anomalous
fading. The natural luminescence is first
measured by heating to 450°C. The discs
are then given an equal alpha irradiation and
stored at room temperature for varied times:
10 min, 2 hours, 1 day, 1 week and 8 weeks.
The irradiations are staggered in time so that
all of the second glows are performed on the
same day. The second glows are normalized
by the natural signal and then compared to
determine any loss of signal with time (on a
log scale). If the sample shows fading and
the signal versus time values can be
reasonably fit to a logarithmic function, an
attempt is made to correct the age following
procedures recommended by Huntley and
Lamothe (2001).

Technical Report No. 174202

A plateau region is determined by
calculating the equivalent dose at
temperature increments between 240° and
450°C and determining over which
temperature range the values do not differ
significantly.
This plateau region is
compared with a similar one constructed for

the b-value (alpha efficiency), and the
overlap defines the integrated range for final
analysis.

Alpha Effectiveness
Alpha efficiency is determined by
comparing additive dose curves using alpha
and beta irradiations. The slide program is
also used in this regard, taking the scale
factor (which is the ratio of the two slopes)
as the b-value (Aitken 1985).

Radioactivity
Radioactivity is measured by alpha counting
in conjunction with atomic emission for 40K.
Samples for alpha counting are crushed in a
mill to flour consistency, packed into
plexiglass containers with ZnS:Ag screens,
and sealed for one month before counting.
The pairs technique is used to separate the U
and Th decay series. For atomic emission
measurements, samples are dissolved in HF
and other acids and analyzed by a Jenway
flame photometer. K concentrations for
each sample are determined by bracketing
between standards of known concentration.
Conversion to 40K is by natural atomic
abundance. Radioactivity is also measured,
as a check, by beta counting, using a Risø
low level beta GM multicounter system.
About 0.5 g of crushed sample is placed on
each of four plastic sample holders. All are
counted for 24 hours. The average is
converted to dose rate following BøtterJensen and Mejdahl (1988) and compared
with the beta dose rate calculated from the
alpha counting and flame photometer
results.
Both the sherd and an associated soil sample
are measured for radioactivity. Additional
soil samples are analyzed where the
environment is complex, and gamma
contributions determined by gradients (after
Aitken 1985: appendix H).
Cosmic
radiation is determined after Prescott and
Hutton (1988). Radioactivity
concentrations are translated into dose rates
following Adamiec and Aitken (1998).

Moisture Contents
Water absorption values for the sherds are
determined by comparing the saturated and
dried weights. For temperate climates,
moisture in the pottery is taken to be 80 ± 20
percent of total absorption, unless otherwise
indicated by the archaeologist. Again for
temperate climates, soil moisture contents
are taken from typical moisture retention
quantities for different textured soils (Brady
1974: 196), unless otherwise measured. For
drier climates, moisture values are
determined in consultation with the
archaeologist.
Procedures for Optically Stimulated or
Infrared Stimulated Luminescence of
Fine-Grained Pottery
Optically stimulated luminescence (OSL)
and infrared stimulated luminescence
(IRSL) on fine-grain (1-8µm) pottery
samples are carried out on single aliquots
following procedures adapted from Banerjee
et al. (2001) and Roberts and Wintle (2001.
Equivalent dose is determined by the singlealiquot regenerative dose (SAR) method
(Murray and Wintle 2000).
The SAR method measures the natural
signal and the signal from a series of
regeneration doses on a single aliquot. The
method uses a small test dose to monitor and
correct for sensitivity changes brought about
by preheating, irradiation or light
stimulation. SAR consists of the following
steps: 1) preheat, 2) measurement of natural
signal (OSL or IRSL), L(1), 3) test dose, 4)
cut heat, 5) measurement of test dose signal,
T(1), 6) regeneration dose, 7) preheat, 8)
measurement of signal from regeneration,
L(2), 9) test dose, 10) cut heat, 11)
measurement of test dose signal, T(2), 12)
repeat of steps 6 through 11 for various
regeneration doses. A growth curve is
constructed from the L(i)/T(i) ratios and the
equivalent dose is found by interpolation of
L(1)/T(1). Usually a zero regeneration dose
and a repeated regeneration dose are
employed to insure the procedure is working

properly.
For fine-grained ceramics, a
preheat of 240°C for 10s, a test dose of 3.1
Gy, and a cut heat of 200°C are currently
being used, although these parameters may
be modified from sample to sample.

A dose recovery test is performed by first
zeroing the sample by exposure to light and
then administering a known dose. The SAR
protocol is then applied to see if the known
dose can be obtained.

The luminescence, L(i) and T(i), is
measured on a Risø TL-DA-15 automated
reader by a succession of two stimulations:
first 100 s at 125°C of IRSL (880nm
diodes), and then 100s at 125°C of OSL
(470nm diodes).
Detection is through
7.5mm of Hoya U340 (ultra-violet) filters.
The two stimulations are used to construct
IRSL and OSL growth curves, so that two
estimations of equivalent dose are available.
Anomalous
fading
usually
involves
feldspars and only feldspars are sensitive to
IRSL stimulation. The rationale for the
IRSL stimulation is to remove most of the
feldspar signal, so that the subsequent OSL
signal is free from anomalous fading.
However, feldspar is also sensitive to blue
light (470nm), and it is possible that IRSL
does not remove all the feldspar signal.
Some preliminary tests in our laboratory
have suggested that the OSL signal does not
suffer from fading, but this may be sample
specific. The procedure is still undergoing
study.

Alpha efficiency will surely differ among
IRSL, OSL and TL on fine-grained
materials. It does differ between coarsegrained feldspar and quartz (Aitken 1985).
Research is currently underway in the
laboratory to determine how much b-value
varies according to stimulation method.
Results from several samples from different
geographic locations show that OSL b-value
is less variable and centers around 0.5.
IRSL b-value is more variable and is higher
than that for OSL. TL b-value tends to fall
between the OSL and IRSL values. We
currently are measuring the b-value for
IRSL and OSL by adding two alpha
regeneration points to the SAR sequence.
The slopes of the beta regeneration growth
curve and that of the alphas are compared to
determine b-value. This procedure is also
undergoing study.

Introduction

Pottery (n=100, TKP754-803 and TKP826­
875) from ten sites in eastern Texas were
analyzed by instrumental neutron activation
analysis (INAA) at the University of
Missouri Research Reactor Center (MURR).
Here, we describe sample preparation and
analytical techniques used at MURR and
report the compositional group membership
of the new samples. The Caddo database
consists of approximately 900 samples, and
ten reference groups. We are currently in
the process of reassessing all of the Caddo
samples to create more inclusive reference
groups, but for the purpose of assigning
these samples, the tightly defined reference
groups presented in Ferguson and Glascock
(2006) are used. To further complicate
matters, the samples described in this report
are compositionally intermediate between
the Smith and Titus Groups, and appear to
also come from sites between the areas
where most of the members of the Smith and
Titus reference groups derive. Rather than
blur the boundary between the Titus and
Smith groups by including some of the new
samples or create a new group with little
separation fro other groups, we have decided
to describe the sample as unassigned until
the reanalysis of the Caddo database is
complete.
D.2

Sample Preparation

Pottery samples were prepared for INAA
using procedures standard at MURR.
Fragments of about 1 cm2 were removed
from each sample and abraded using a
silicon carbide burr in order to remove
glaze, slip, paint, and adhering soil, thereby
reducing
the
risk
of
measuring
contamination. The samples were washed in
deionized water and allowed to dry in the
laboratory. Once dry, the individual sherds
were ground to powder in an agate mortar to
homogenize the samples. Archival samples
were retained from each sherd (when
possible) for future research.

Technical Report No. 174202

Two analytical samples were prepared from
each source specimen. Portions of
approximately 150 mg of powder were
weighed
into
clean,
high-density
polyethylene vials used for short irradiations
at MURR. At the same time, 200 mg of
each sample was weighed into clean highpurity quartz vials used for long irradiations.
Individual sample weights were recorded to
the nearest 0.01 mg using an analytical
balance. Both vials were sealed prior to
irradiation.
Along with the unknown
samples, standards made from National
Institute of Standards and Technology
(NIST) certified standard reference materials
of SRM-1633a (coal fly ash) and SRM-688
(basalt rock) were similarly prepared, as
were quality control samples (e.g., standards
treated as unknowns) of SRM-278 (obsidian
rock) and Ohio Red Clay (a standard
developed for in-house applications).
D.3

Irradiation and Gamma-Ray
Spectroscopy

Neutron activation analysis of ceramics at
MURR, which consists of two irradiations
and a total of three gamma counts,
constitutes a superset of the procedures used
at most other NAA laboratories (Glascock
1992; Neff 1992, 2000). As discussed in
detail by Glascock (1992), a short irradiation
is carried out through the pneumatic tube
irradiation system. Samples in the polyvials
are sequentially rradiated, two at a time, for
five seconds by a neutron flux of 8 x 1013 n
cm-2 s-1 The 720-second count yields
gamma spectra containing peaks for nine
short-lived elements aluminum (Al), barium
(Ba), calcium (Ca), dysprosium (Dy),
potassium (K), manganese (Mn), sodium
(Na), titanium (Ti), and vanadium (V). The
samples are encapsulated in quartz vials and
are subjected to a 24–hour irradiation at a
neutron flux of 5 x 1013 n cm-2 s-1. This
long irradiation is analogous to the single
irradiation
utilized
at
most
other
laboratories. After the long irradiation,
samples decay for seven days, and then are
counted for 1,800 seconds (the "middle
count") on a high-resolution germanium

593

Appendix D: Instrumental Neutron Activation Analysis of Caddo Pottery from Ten Sites in Central Texas

detector coupled to an automatic sample
changer. The middle count yields
determinations of seven medium half-life
elements, namely arsenic (As), lanthanum
(La), lutetium (Lu), neodymium (Nd),
samarium (Sm), uranium (U), and ytterbium
(Yb). After an additional three- or four-week
decay, a final count of 8,500 seconds is
carried out on each sample. The latter
measurement yields the following 17 long
half-life elements: cerium (Ce), cobalt (Co),
chromium (Cr), cesium (Cs), europium (Eu),
iron (Fe), hafnium (Hf), nickel (Ni),
rubidium (Rb), antimony (Sb), scandium
(Sc), strontium (Sr), tantalum (Ta), terbium
(Tb), thorium (Th), zinc (Zn), and zirconium
(Zr).
The element concentration data from the
three measurements are tabulated in parts
per million using the EXCEL spreadsheet
program. Descriptive data for the
archaeological samples were appended to
the concentration spreadsheet. The data are
also stored in a dBASE/FOXPRO database
file useful for organizing, sorting, and
extracting sample information. The data file
enclosed with this report contains the sample
database in EXCEL format.
D.4

Interpreting Chemical Data

The analyses at MURR described previously
produced elemental concentration values for
33 elements in most of the analyzed
samples. Data for Ni in most samples was
below detection limits (as is the norm for
most New World ceramic analyses) and was
removed from consideration during the
statistical analysis. Calcium levels were
found to be high enough in approximately
five of the specimens to require a calcium
correction of the dataset, but all of the
comparative Caddo sherds have been
calcium corrected, so to maintain a
consistent dataset we have corrected the new
samples as well. Because calcium has the
potential to affect (dilute) the concentrations
of other elements in the analysis, all samples
were
mathematically
corrected
to
compensate for any possible calcium

594

included effects (the data were examined
before and after calcium correction and the
results were similar). The following
mathematical correction was used as it has
been proven to be effective in other calciumrich datasets (Cogswell et al. 1998:64;
Steponaitis et al. 1988):

106 e
e'=

106 − 2.5c

where e′ is the corrected concentration of a
given element in ppm, e is the measured
concentration of that element in ppm, and c
is the concentration of elemental calcium in
ppm. After the calcium correction, statistical
analysis was subsequently carried out on
base-10 logarithms of concentrations on the
remaining 31 elements. Use of log
concentrations rather than raw data
compensates for differences in magnitude
between the major elements, such as
calcium, on one hand and trace elements,
such as the rare earth or lanthanide elements
(REEs).
Transformation
to
base-10
logarithms also yields a more normal
distribution for many trace elements.

The interpretation of compositional data
obtained from the analysis of archaeological
materials is discussed in detail elsewhere
(e.g., Baxter and Buck 2000; Bieber et al.
1976; Bishop and Neff 1989; Glascock
1992; Harbottle 1976; Neff 2000) and will
only be summarized here. The main goal of
data analysis is to identify distinct
homogeneous groups within the analytical
database. Based on the provenance postulate
of Weigand et al. (1977), different chemical

groups may be assumed to represent
geographically restricted sources. For lithic
materials such as obsidian, basalt, and
cryptocrystalline silicates (e.g., chert, flint,
or jasper), raw material samples are
frequently collected from known outcrops or
secondary deposits and the compositional
data obtained on the samples is used to
define the source localities or boundaries.
The locations of sources can also be inferred
by comparing unknown specimens (i.e.,
ceramic artifacts) to knowns (i.e., clay
samples) or by indirect methods such as the
“criterion of abundance” (Bishop et al.
1992) or by arguments based on geological
and sedimentological characteristics (e.g.,
Steponaitis et al. 1996). The ubiquity of
ceramic raw materials usually makes it
impossible to sample all potential “sources”
intensively enough to create groups of
knowns to which unknowns can be
compared. Lithic sources tend to be more
localized and compositionally homogeneous
in the case of obsidian or compositionally
heterogeneous as is the case for most cherts.
Compositional groups can be viewed as
“centers of mass” in the compositional
hyperspace described by the measured
elemental data. Groups are characterized by
the locations of their centroids and the
unique relationships (i.e., correlations)
between the elements. Decisions about
whether to assign a specimen to a particular
compositional group are based on the overall
probability that the measured concentrations
for the specimen could have been obtained
from that group.
Initial hypotheses about source-related
subgroups in the compositional data can be
derived from non-compositional information
(e.g., archaeological context, decorative
attributes, etc.) or from application of
various pattern-recognition technique to the
multivariate chemical data. Some of the
pattern recognition techniques that have
been used to investigate archaeological data
sets are cluster analysis (CA), principal
components
analysis
(PCA),
and
discriminant analysis (DA). Each of the

Technical Report No. 174202

techniques has it own advantages and
disadvantages which may depend upon the
types and quantity of data available for
interpretation.
The variables (measured elements) in
archaeological and geological data sets are
often correlated and frequently large in
number. This makes handling and
interpreting patterns within the data difficult.
Therefore, it is often useful to transform the
original variables into a smaller set of
uncorrelated variables in order to make data
interpretation easier. Of the abovementioned pattern recognition techniques,
PCA is a technique that transforms from the
data from the original correlated variables
into uncorrelated variables most easily.
PCA creates a new set of reference axes
arranged in decreasing order of variance
subsumed. The individual PCs are linear
combinations of the original variables. The
data can be displayed on combinations of
the new axes, just as they can be displayed
on the original elemental concentration axes.
PCA can be used in a pure patternrecognition mode, i.e., to search for
subgroups in an undifferentiated data set, or
in a more evaluative mode, i.e., to assess the
coherence of hypothetical groups suggested
by other criteria. Generally, compositional
differences between specimens can be
expected to be larger for specimens in
different groups than for specimens in the
same group, and this implies that groups
should be detectable as distinct areas of high
point density on plots of the first few
components.
It is well known that PCA of chemical data
is scale dependent (Mardia et al. 1979), and
analyses tend to be dominated by those
elements or isotopes for which the
concentrations are relatively large. As a
result, standardization methods are common
to most statistical packages. A common
approach it to transform the data into
logarithms (e.g., base 10). As an initial step
in the PCA of most chemical data at MURR,
the data are transformed into log

595

Appendix D: Instrumental Neutron Activation Analysis of Caddo Pottery from Ten Sites in Central Texas

concentrations to equalize the differences in
variance between the major elements such as
Al, Ca and Fe, on one hand and trace
elements, such as the rare-earth elements
(REEs), on the other hand. An additional
advantage of the transformation is that it
appears to produce more nearly normal
distributions for the trace elements.
One frequently exploited strength of PCA,
discussed by Baxter (1992), Baxter and
Buck (2000z), and Neff (1994, 2002), is that
it can be applied as a simultaneous R- and
Q-mode technique, with both variables
(elements) and objects (individual analyzed
samples) displayed on the same set of
principal component reference axes. A plot
using the first two principal components as
axes is usually the best possible twodimensional representation of the correlation
or variance-covariance structure within the
data set. Small angles between the vectors
from the origin to variable coordinates
indicate strong positive correlation; angles at
90 degrees indicate no correlation; and
angles close to 180 degrees indicate strong
negative correlation. Likewise, a plot of
sample coordinates on these same axes will
be the best two-dimensional representation
of Euclidean relations among the samples in
log-concentration space (if the PCA was
based on the variance-covariance matrix) or
standardized log-concentration space (if the
PCA was based on the correlation matrix).
Displaying both objects and variables on the
same plot makes it possible to observe the
contributions of specific elements to group
separation and to the distinctive shapes of
the various groups. Such a plot is commonly
referred to as a “biplot” in reference to the
simultaneous plotting of objects and
variables.
The variable inter-relationships inferred
from a biplot can be verified directly by
inspecting bivariate elemental concentration
plots. [Note that a bivariate plot of elemental
concentrations is not a biplot.] Whether a
group can be discriminated easily from other
groups can be evaluated visually in two
dimensions or statistically in multiple

596

dimensions. A metric known as the
Mahalanobis distance (or generalized
distance) makes it possible to describe the
separation between groups or between
individual samples and groups on multiple
dimensions. The Mahalanobis distance of a
specimen from a group centroid (Bieber et
al. 1976, Bishop and Neff 1989) is defined
by:

D2 yX = [ y − X ] tIx [ y − X ]
where y is the 1 x m array of logged
elemental concentrations for the specimen of
interest, X is the n x m data matrix of
logged concentrations for the group to which
the point is being compared X being it 1 x m
centroid, and Ix is the inverse of the m x m
variance-covariance matrix of group X.
Because Mahalanobis distance takes into
account variances and covariances in the
multivariate group it is analogous to
expressing distance from a univariate mean
in standard deviation units. Like standard
deviation units, Mahalanobis distances can
be converted into probabilities of group
membership for individual specimens. For
relatively small sample sizes, it is
appropriate to base probabilities on
Hotelling’s T 2 , which is the multivariate
extension of the univariate Student’s t.
When group sizes are small, Mahalanobis
distance-based probabilities can fluctuate
dramatically depending upon whether or not
each specimen is assumed to be a member of
the group to which it is being compared.
Harbottle (1976) calls this phenomenon
“stretchability” in reference to the tendency
of an included specimen to stretch the group
in the direction of its own location in
elemental concentration space. This problem
can be circumvented by cross-validation,
that is, by removing each specimen from its
presumed group before calculating its own
probability of membership (Baxter 1994;
Leese and Main 1994). This is a
conservative approach to group evaluation
that may sometimes exclude true group
members.

Technical Report No. 174202

Archeological Investigations at the Lang Pasture Site (41AN38) in the Upper Neches River Basin of East Texas
Texas Department of Transportation

Small sample and group sizes place further
constraints on the use of Mahalanobis
distance: with more elements than samples,
the group variance-covariance matrix is
singular thus rendering calculation of Ix
(and D2 itself) impossible. Therefore, the
dimensionality of the groups must somehow
be reduced.
One approach would be to eliminate
elements considered irrelevant or redundant.
The problem with this approach is that the
investigator’s preconceptions about which
elements should be discriminate may not be
valid. It also squanders the main advantage
of multielement analysis, namely the
capability to measure a large number of
elements. An alternative approach is to
calculate Mahalanobis distances with the
scores on principal components extracted
from the variance-covariance or correlation
matrix for the complete data set. This
approach entails only the assumption,
entirely reasonable in light of the above
discussion of PCA, that most groupseparating differences should be visible on
the first several PCs. Unless a data set is
extremely complex, containing numerous
distinct groups, using enough components to
subsume at least 90% of the total variance in
the data can be generally assumed to yield
Mahalanobis distances that approximate
Mahalanobis distances in full elemental
concentration space.
Lastly, Mahalanobis distance calculations
are also quite useful for handling missing
data (Sayre 1975). When many specimens
are analyzed for a large number of elements,
it is almost certain that a few element
concentrations will be missed for some of
the specimens. This occurs most frequently
when the concentration for an element is
near the detection limit. Rather than
eliminate the specimen or the element from
consideration, it is possible to substitute a
missing value by replacing it with a value
that minimizes the Mahalanobis distance for
the specimen from the group centroid. Thus,
those few specimens which are missing a

Technical Report No. 174202

single concentration value can still be used
in group calculations.

Results and Conclusions

The primary questions addressed here are 1)
How do the new samples fit within the
compositional groups structure previously
developed for the Caddo region? 2) Are
there any apparent differences in the
composition of the samples from 41AN38
and those from the other nine sites in this
study?
Table D-1 displays the group
assignments and some descriptive data for
the samples.

Compositional Group Structure
Before discussing the compositional group
assignments of the new samples, it is
necessary to discuss the current status of the
reference groups. The similarity of the clay
sources in the Caddo area results in large
compositional groups with considerable
overlap. In the most recent analysis of
Caddo pottery (Ferguson and Glascock
2006) we refined the reference groups to
allow for some separation of the groups
using Mahalanobis distance calculations.
Prior to this reanalysis, the reference groups
had grown to the point that there was very
little chemical separation. As an unfortunate
result of this refinement, approximately half
of the Caddo sherds in the database are now
unassigned. The reference groups are now
reduced to much tighter groups that allow
more confident assignment of new samples,
however, this results in many new samples
not fitting well into existing reference
groups. In the following paragraphs we
explain why none of the new samples
belong in any of the reference groups except
for possibly Titus and Smith, but we also
explain some of the problems with assigning
new samples to these groups.

Comparison with Small Caddo
Reference Groups
The most chemically unique Caddo
reference group is the Sandy Paste Group.

597

Appendix D: Instrumental Neutron Activation Analysis of Caddo Pottery from Ten Sites in Central Texas

This group has diluted concentrations of
most elements, likely resulting from large
amounts of sand (although we are not sure if
this is due to the use of a sandy clay, or the
addition of sand temper). None of the new
samples plot well within this group.
Another reference group, Rusk, consists of
20 members, and thus also precludes the use
of Mahalanobis distance calculations (due to
small sample size). Figure D-1 plots the
distribution of the new samples relative to
the Rusk and Sandy Paste Groups, according
to concentrations of chromium and
dysprosium. Figure D-2 plots the new
samples relative to the very small (n=5)
Washington Square reference group.
Figures D-3 and D-4 plot the Leaning Rock
samples against the Hurricane 1 (n=20) and
Hurricane 2 (n=25) reference groups,
respectively. Figures D-5 and D-6 plot the
samples against the Cypress 1 (n=14) and
Cypress 2 (n=16) Reference Groups. The
Cypress 1 Reference Group is a problematic
group because is consistently overlaps with
many other reference groups, particularly
with Titus. The overlap of Cypress 1 with
Titus is the likely reason why there are no
plots that completely separate the new
samples from Cypress 1. This relationship
may become clearer following the reanalysis
of the entire Caddoan database that is
currently underway.

Comparison with Large Caddo
Reference Groups
The three remaining groups, Titus, Smith,
and Red River, are all large enough to
permit statistical assessment of group
membership using probabilities of group
membership calculated from a Mahalanobis
distance projection. Figure D-7 is a bivariate
plot of the new samples against the Red
River reference group. There is little
overlap, and the Mahalanobis distance
projections shown in Table D-2 support this
complete separation from the Red River
Group.
The highest probability of
membership for any of the 100 samples was
only 0.021%.

598

The assessment of the Smith and Titus
Groups is where this interpretation gets
more complicated. Bivariate elemental plots
are quite confusing because the sherds
consistently plot right around the
intersection of the Smith and Titus ellipses.
A plot of Figure D-8 is a good example of
this overlap. All other elemental bivariate
plots show considerably greater overlap
between Titus and Smith, and thus more
samples that simultaneously plot in both
groups.

membership

Table D-2 was used to identify the samples
with a consistent and exclusive connection
to one of the reference groups. Using the
criteria that the sample must be
overwhelmingly associated with only one
group, five samples were assigned to the
Smith Group, and eleven were assigned to
Titus. If these assigned samples are added to
the reference groups, and then a new
Mahalanobis distance projection conducted,
more samples fall into one group or the
other, but this leads to problems with the
reference groups. The new samples added
tend to fall closer to the overlap between the
two groups, thus, each round of adding new
samples further blurs the distinction between
the groups. This fuzzy overlap is the reason
the groups were cut back to central clusters
in the 2006 (Ferguson and Glascock) report,
and it seems counter productive to reduce
the separation between the reference groups.
As of this report, the eleven samples in Titus
and five in Smith have been assigned to the
reference group, but not added to the actual
reference group. Dr. Perttula has suggested
that the samples for this project come from
sites in the region between the areas that
have produced the bulk of the Titus and
Smith samples, and the compositional data
presented here agree.
Canonical discriminate analysis can be quite
useful in creating separation between groups
that do not separate well in elemental
bivariate plots. One problem with canonical
discriminate analysis is that it requires three
identified groups in order to calculate the

variables. Using the Titus, Smith and Red
River groups, the canonical discriminate
functions do a good job of isolating the Red
River Group and they reveal the overlap
with the Smith and Titus Groups (Figure D­
9). As an additional exploratory test, we
treated the new samples as a single
compositional group and then calculated the
canonical discriminate function of the new
samples, Titus, and Smith. Figure D-10
shows how it is possible to isolate the new
samples into a separate cluster, but this
difference is not sufficient to consider the
new samples to be a new group, just an
intermediate scatter with some samples
closer to Titus and others closer to Smith.
While only 16% of the samples were
assigned to an existing reference group, that
is not surprising given the complex
relationship with the Titus and Smith
Reference Groups outlined above. The
remaining samples fall into two broad
categories: intermediate and unassigned.
These designations are based on the
probabilities of group membership listed in
Table D-2. Samples are assigned to the
intermediate group if that have a reasonable
probability of belonging to both the Smith
and Titus groups, while the unassigned do
not. Some of the unassigned samples may
have a slight probability of membership in
only one of the groups, but not enough to
assign it to the reference group. Figure D-11
shows some predictable, yet interesting,
patterns in the data. The samples assigned to
the Titus and Smith reference groups pull in
opposite directions, and the remaining
samples cluster in the middle.
The
intermediate samples have a tighter cluster
inside the distribution of the unknown
samples.
This separation between the
unassigned and unassigned and intermediate
samples is not incredible informative except
to suggest that some of the unassigned
samples might be more likely to be imported
than some of the intermediate samples,
assuming that the local production is using
raw materials that have compositions
intermediate between Smith and Titus.

Intersite Comparison
One of the goals of this project was to
determine if there were any systematic
differences in the raw materials used in the
ceramics found at 41AN38 and the sherds
from the other nine sites included in the
analysis. Bivariate elemental plots revealed
no systematic differences between the two
assemblages in any elements, except perhaps
aluminum, but the differences were quite
small and aluminum is one of the more
difficult elements to measure accurately.
There are also no significant patterns in the
assignments to either the reference groups or
to the differences in the intermediate or the
unassigned categories. At this point we
cannot see any differences in the
composition between the samples from
41AN38 and those from the other sites.
D.6

Conclusions

Of the 100 sherds analyzed for this project,
16 were assigned to either the Titus or Smith
reference groups. This low percentage of
unassigned specimens is likely the result of
the gradual and systematic differences in the
chemical composition of the raw materials
used in pottery manufacture the Caddo area.
Almost all of the new samples appear to
have been made of raw material that is
compositionally intermediate between those
used to make the Titus and the Smith
Reference Groups. This analysis contains
material from ten different sites, and there
appears to be little systematic difference in
the materials used at the different sites. This
report should be considered preliminary
until the reanalysis of the entire Caddoan
database, currently underway, is completed.

Introduction

In late-January and February of 2004,
archeologists from Coastal Environments, Inc.
(CEI), working under contract to the Texas
Department of Transportation (TxDOT),
conducted test-level investigations at two sites
(41AN38 and 41AN159) in Anderson County,
Texas. The sites are located alongside State
Highway 155, and will be impacted by
scheduled expansion of SH155 from two to four
lanes. 41AN38 was initially recorded by TxDOT
archeologists in the early 1980s, who
recommended the site for testing at that time.
41AN159 was recorded during a survey
conducted by Hicks & Company (under contract
to TxDOT) in 2002, at which time the site was
recommended for testing based on the recovery
of Caddo style ceramic sherds, including several
decorated pieces. Hicks & Company also
revisited 41AN38, recovering additional Caddo
materials and reconfirming the earlier
recommendation.
On the basis of artifact recoveries, both sites
were characterized as probable Caddo
farmsteads of unknown time periods. The sites
were perceived as having potential to make
significant contributions to the regional
understanding of Caddo prehistory, especially
considering the information they were thought to
contain regarding residential or domestic
activities. The great majority (though not all) of
archeological attention given to Caddo sites in
East Texas and adjacent regions has been
focused on mound sites and cemeteries, leaving
questions of regional settlement, subsistence
practices, domestic organization (around lines of
age, gender, task group, and/or status), and
household-scale religious behavior relatively
unsettled. Farmsteads, along with communities,
have been referred to as one of the “fundamental
building blocks of the Caddoan settlement
system” (Story 1990a:336), though farmsteads
are most frequently overlooked in research
efforts (Kelley 1997).
At TxDOT’s request, a Research Design and
Scope of Work was prepared (Perttula and

Technical Report No. 174202

Ricklis 2003) outlining work to be conducting in
determining whether the sites should be
considered eligible for listing to the National
Register of Historic Places (NRHP) and warrant
further treatment prior to road construction.
Important questions to be resolved included
whether the sites were farmsteads and whether
they were contemporaneously occupied, in
which case they could be considered together as
part of an integrated regional settlement system.
To resolve these questions in determining site
NRHP eligibility, the Scope recommended that
additional shovel testing be carried out to
identify concentrations of buried remains. Hand
excavated units would follow to recover an
adequate sample of temporally diagnostic
decorated ceramic sherds which can be
compared with assemblages recovered from
nearby Lake Palestine (Anderson et al. 1974) to
help seriate site occupations based on
percentages of different decorative elements and
paste treatments (50-100 decorated sherds were
needed and 200+ was considered ideal). Based
on the results of the Hicks & Company survey, it
was predicted that at least nine square meters
would need to be excavated at 41AN38 and
perhaps as many as 22 square meters of
excavation were required for 41AN159 to
recover 200 decorated sherds. To resolve the
first question, the nature of residential site
structure, potential features were to be sought by
hand excavations and also by mechanically
stripping of large sections of overburden. These
exposures would ideally reveal cultural features
such as postholes, middens, burial or storage
pits, and so forth. Such features would be
recognizable by discrete patterns of soil
discolorations, usually a dark staining. All units,
including shovel tests, test units, and
mechanically scraped areas, were to be located
on topographic maps of the sites that would be
prepared using a surveyor’s transit.
E.2

Environmental Setting

Physiographically, the study area lies in what
Story et al. (1990) termed the West Gulf Coastal
Plain (Figure E-1). Following Fenneman (1938),
this section of the Coastal Plain includes the

615

Appendix E: Test Excavations at 41AN159

Texas-Louisiana border and extends west as far
as the Trinity River. Surrounded by more active
geologic provinces (such as the Ouachita,
Mississippi Valley, and Central Texas sections),
the region is characterized by rolling
topography,
abundant
groundwater
and
numerous rivers, and sandy loam sediments that
are often loosely consolidated. The region’s
sandy soils, while agriculturally productive, are
not considered particularly fertile without
constant replenishment of nutrients.

Figure E-1. Location of Project Area with
Respect to Physiographic Provinces (after
Story 1990b: Figure 4).

Moreover, the loose sediment consolidation can
result in serious problems of topsoil loss from
erosion and runoff once standing vegetation is
cleared, unless the soils are otherwise protected
through slope management. Owing to the
heavily weathered geologic substratum and the

616

sedimentary nature of much of the region’s
bedrock, the study area lacks an abundance of
raw stone materials well suited for tool-making
(coarse petrified wood was commonly used in
the absence of finer grained silicious material).
Much of the toolstone that is available
(including quartzite, petrified wood, and chert
nodules) occurs in secondary deposits as river
gravels, and is heavily battered and generally
small in size.
Vegetation across the project area is presently
characterized by a mixture of evergreen and
deciduous growth. Pines and hardwoods are
present in mixed communities, with species
including shortleaf and loblolly pines, oaks, bois
d’arc, hickory, redbud, and dogwood among
others (see Perttula 1995). This vegetation
regime is supported by a fairly mesic or wet
climate, including standing ground water and
boggy tracts as well as numerous streams,
drainages, and river systems (Figure E-2). For
the Cypress Creek valley, Thurmond (1981)
suggested that the region’s late prehistoric
archeological record of dense occupations
sustained by agricultural production, in sharp
contrast to adjacent areas where regional stream
flows are more intermittent, is likely to be a
direct result of the perennial presence and
reliability of water. One result of the region’s
numerous active stream channels is that
drainages and their valleys are frequently filled
with alluvial sediments from flood events,
reducing their suitability for habitation sites;
most of the region’s prehistoric settlement
(including the two sites discussed in this report)
is found on adjacent well drained upland areas.
The floodplains, however, also were very
important environmental areas for prehistoric
inhabitants, and are quite likely to contain wellpreserved paleoenvironmental records of flood
events, deforestation, and perhaps agricultural
practices reflective of regional occupational
sequences.

Cultural Context

Sites 41AN38 and 41AN159 are situated in a
part of the Neches River valley that is well
known as one of the principal areas settled by
prehistoric and historic Caddo groups that are
identified archeologically as the Frankston (ca.
A.D. 1400-1650) and Allen (ca. A.D. 1650­
1750) phases (see Story and Creel 1982:29-32;
Kleinschmidt 1982), but much of the relevant
archeological work was done in the 1930s and
focused on the excavation of cemeteries (see
Guy 1990: Table E-3; see also Cole 1975); one
such nearby cemetery in the Caney Branch
Creek valley is the Mrs. J. M. Cook site
(41AN1). Major excavations were also
conducted in the early 1930s at the A. C.
Saunders (41AN19) mound center (Jackson
1936; Kleinschmidt 1982), but there was a
dearth of work done in habitation deposits (other
than occasionally trenching a trash midden

Technical Report No. 174202

deposit). Story (2000:13) has noted that “none of
the [Frankston phase] sites…has been
extensively investigated nor well dated and
much of the information comes from
excavations made in the early and middle
1930s.”
In more recent times, archeological work in this
part of the upper Neches River basin has taken
place at or near Lake Palestine, where a number
of primarily Late Caddo Frankston phase sites
have been investigated (Anderson et al. 1974;
Cliff et al. 2004; Gilmore 1983; Shafer 1981).
Here too, however, the work was not specifically
directed towards identifying and studying
habitation features and the layout of Caddo
settlements/households, and it was primarily
successful only in the identification of midden
deposits and their contents, or in salvaging the
contents of a disturbed Late Caddo burial (e.g.,
Shafer 1981).

617

Appendix E: Test Excavations at 41AN159

On Caddo habitation sites, “most excavations
have been too limited to permit accurate
characterization of the settlement size and
structure, and sometimes even its history of use”
(Story 1990:334). While there have been more
extensive archeological investigations of Caddo
habitation sites more recently in some parts of
northeastern Texas , the fact remains that our
understanding of the basic character of
prehistoric and early historic Caddo households,
settlements, and communities is still poorly
known. This is as true for Caddo habitation sites
in the upper part of the Neches River basin as it
is in any part of northeastern Texas.
The archeological investigations that we
proposed to conduct at 41AN38 and 41AN159
were designed to determine if: (a) both sites
have archeological deposits that are informative
about the nature and character of Caddo
households and farmsteads in the upper Neches
River basin, and (b) if the plain and decorated
ceramics found on the sites can establish if they
are part of a related set of households/farmsteads
in the Caney Branch Creek valley and the upper
Neches River basin.
To investigate the research issue “Caddo
settlement systems and households” by focusing
on these two Caddo sites of unknown age, we
needed to be able to establish their spatial
parameters and internal organization (see
Kenmotsu and Perttula 1993:137). This included
establishing whether there are structures and
other kinds of features (especially specialized
storage facilities and midden deposits) preserved
on the sites, as well as any spatial clusters of
ceramic sherds, lithic tools and debris, plant
remains, and any preserved animal bones. These
spatial data on features and artifacts are key to
determining if Caddo households are present at
41AN38 and 41AN159, and if the configuration
of household features and activity areas can also
be identified during the archeological work. We
also hoped to establish their age, hopefully
within a 50-100-year span, to either establish the
contemporaneity of the two sites or, if they were
of different ages, how much older one was than
the other so that diachronic changes in
household configuration and material culture
could be measured in the archeological record.

618

Since Caddo sites in the upper Neches River
basin appear to be part of sedentary, but
dispersed settlement systems of agricultural
communities, we expected well-preserved
individual households or farmsteads to contain
evidence of pole-frame structures (thatched with
grass)—such as post holes, smudge pits, or
central hearth features in the archeological
record—that would have been occupied by
nuclear or extended families for 10-20 years.
There should also be evidence for outdoor
activity areas where foods were cooked and
plant and animal products were processed;
midden deposits from trash disposal and the
discard of broken ceramic vessels and stone
tools; postholes denoting possible granary
structures, ramadas, and arbors; and the presence
of burials from small family cemeteries.
Furthermore,
well-preserved
and
single
component Caddo households/farmsteads should
contain artifacts found in various archeological
deposits that may be present at 41AN38 and
41AN159 (i.e., residential, storage, and trash
midden
contexts)
that
stylistically,
technologically, and functionally can be shown
to belong together as part of a single isolable
component. Should such well-preserved features
and archeological deposits be identified at the
two sites, then they would have the potential to
contribute important information on the
prehistoric Caddo archeology of the northeastern
Texas region, and would warrant inclusion in the
National Register of Historic Places.

Field Methods

Site Description
Site 41AN159 is located at the edge of a
formerly forested upland landform overlooking
the Caney Branch Creek valley. Caney Branch
Creek is a very small tributary of the Neches
River, into which it flows approximately 10
kilometers downstream (northeast) from the site.
The project area is between three and four
kilometers south of the town of Frankston, in an
area of rolling topography and perennial
drainages fed by seep springs.
The site extends some distance (30 or more
meters) inside the SH155 ROW. The area is
covered in moderately dense secondary growth;

Texas Department of Transportation

Hicks & Company archeologists described the
site as not having been cleared or plowed in at
least 50 years (Figure E-3). The site was
interpreted as a possible Caddoan farmstead
based on the recovery of a small sample of
sherds and lithic debris. Most of the site area is
located on sloping terrain, though generally flat
and level areas are located at the top of the

landform; sediment depths in these flat areas
varies considerably from only 10 or so
centimeters to over 60cm. A private drive and
residence are located to the south of the site
(Figure E-4), and Caney Branch Creek runs
immediately to the south of the drive.

Contour plowing, dating to the early 1900s, has
heavily impacted sloped areas across the site.
The process of contour plowing involves
building up linear berms of sediment across
slopes to slow or prevent the erosion of topsoil.
Soil comes from above and immediately below
the berm, involving a substantial amount of

sediment dislocation and redeposition. Much of
this work was done with either tractors or mule
teams drawing plows behind them; depths of
impact probably exceeded 40 to 50 centimeters
and covered wide horizontal swaths both above
and below each berm (Figure E-5).

Figure E-5. Contour Terrace at 41AN159 (grass covered berm indicated by arrow), Looking North.

Additional disturbance at the site is from
localized erosional drainages; two such features
were observed during CEI work (Figure E-6).
The same telecom line noted at 41AN38
parallels the fenceline along the western edge of
this site as well (visible in Figure E-4). Finally,
in some places portions of earthen berms have
begun eroding away as a result of continued
rainfall and the lack of regular maintenance.
Hicks & Company archeologists estimated the
total site area of 41AN159 within the ROW at
approximately 900 square meters, though CEI
work recovered artifacts from a somewhat larger
area (albeit not in any patterned concentration).
In general, it is clear that there has been a
considerable amount of sediment displacement
and redeposition through a number of processes
across the site. Soil depths vary widely from
only a few centimeters in upslope areas to well
over a meter in downslope settings. Unlike

620

41AN38, this area appears to have undergone
considerable impacts in historic times, both from
agricultural landscape modifications and natural
erosion.

Methods of Investigation
The first activity conducted at the site consisted
of the preparation of a topographic map onto
which all excavation units could be plotted, and
that also established control (horizontal and
vertical) for documenting artifact recovery and
the locations of possible features. An initial
baseline was established that paralleled the fence
line along the western edge of the site. The
fence line was also used as “grid north” for
aligning all subsequent hand excavations and
overall map orientation; these alignments later
were rectified with magnetic north, using a Silva
hand-held plate compass. Grid points were
established at 1-meter intervals in reference to
the site’s primary datum point (arbitrarily

defined as N100E100, elevation 100m).
Elevation values were recorded in reference to
the site’s main datum; these topographic data
were entered into a spreadsheet, and then into a
computer mapping program (Surfer, version 7.0)
capable of rendering the site terrain in a variety
of formats, including standard contour maps at

nearly any interval as well as wireframe
overviews depicting landform geography in
three-dimensional views.
Unit locations,
features, fence lines, terracing and erosional
features all are plotted onto contour base maps
in a computer drawing program (CorelDraw,
version 9.0).

Erosional Drainages, Contour Terracing, and the Direction to SH155. Vertical scale is
approximately 4x the horizontal scale, total area depicted measures approximately 50m E-W by
190m N-S.

All shovel tests were excavated in 20-cm levels
with sediments screened through ¼” mesh.
Hand-excavated units, consisting of 1-x-2m and
2-x-2m units dug in arbitrary 10-cm vertical
levels, were then opened. All sediment from
these units was also screened through ¼” mesh,
with artifacts collected by provenience. A total
of 20 square meters (10 1-x-2m units) were hand
excavated at 41AN159 spread across the top of
the landform (one of the units was placed in a
downslope area). Finally, mechanical scraping
was conducted in order to remove overburden
from large blocks in an effort to expose potential

Technical Report No. 174202

cultural features (post molds, pits, middens, etc.)
that would provide detail concerning site
structure. A box blade was affixed to a John
Deere tractor and pulled across the top of the site
in specific areas considered likely for the
presence of features. Topsoil was removed to a
depth of 20 or so centimeters, the scraped areas
closely inspected by hand, and then more soil
was scraped. In areas yielding any artifact
recovery whatsoever, sediments were shovel
skimmed between passes of the tractor so that
potential feature outlines were exposed as
clearly as possible (Figure E-7).

Excavation Results

Description of Excavations
A total of 22 shovel tests were spaced across the
41AN159 site area in an effort to identify

concentrations of cultural materials that
indicated the presence of intact components or
deposits (see Figure E-7). These probes failed to
identify any particularly strong or patterned
concentrations of artifact material, but rather
reflected the diffuse and seemingly disturbed
depositional character of the site (Table E-1).

Hand excavations, consisting of ten 1-x-2m
units, were conducted in areas thought, based on
shovel tests results, to have potential for
containing intact deposits. Nine units were
located in three general areas across the top, flat
portion of the site landform; the remaining unit
was placed in a downslope setting to test
whether colluvial slopewash had buried earlier
deposits. Results from the test units indicate a

from historic agricultural activities and erosion
that this site has undergone.
Sediment profile information from all test units
showed the site to contain a stratigraphic
sequence that was not present in its entirety in
all units. The basal stratum was densely
compacted sterile clay that probably represented
a buried Pleistocene terrace or illuviated Bt
horizon. Lying directly atop this layer was a
dark red sandy clay with gravel inclusions.
Gravels decreased in frequency upwards through
the
soil
column,
suggesting
a
paleoenvironmental shift from a period of

623

Appendix E: Test Excavations at 41AN159

erosion following the deposition of the
Pleistocene terrace to resumed deposition. The
erosional event likely removed early Holocene
deposits, causing an unknown amount of time to
be unrepresented in the soil profiles. Some units
showed a dark staining in the sandy clay some
distance (ranging from only a few centimeters to
several decimeters) above the sterile clay. We
suggest that this dark stratum, where present,
corresponded to the period of Caddoan
occupation of the area, perhaps reflecting
widespread swidden agricultural practices that
deposited charcoal and ashy particles across the

region, even at sites where habitation did not
take place. It is not interpreted as a distinct
depositional event. In units where this inferred
anthropogenic zone is present, it was separated
from the surface by an upper stratum of reddish
sandy clay that ranged in thickness depending on
the amount of topsoil loss in that immediate
vicinity. Important characteristics for overall
stratigraphic sequence are gravel size and
content; gravels diminished considerably
towards the top of the stratigraphic column. A
shallow A-horizon overlied the entire site
(Figures E-8-E-10).

The southernmost part of the site area was tested
by three units (N99E105, N104E104, and
N111E103) and was characterized by a steep
downward slope in the basal clay toward the
south and southeast. The northern of these three
units extended only approximately 20 cm before
the basal clay was encountered. In contrast, the
southernmost unit, N99E105 was almost 70cm
deep before it was terminated. Sediments
pinched out rather abruptly to the north between
the N99 and N111 units. The middle site area
was initially probed by Shovel Test 5, which
yielded a total of five pieces of lithic debitage.
Two 1x2m units were excavated here
(N170E106 and N178E106), though the soil
profiles exposed in these units extended only
around 30 cm. Two of the Archaic dart points
recovered from the site came from these units
(see below), although little to no pottery was
recovered. Moreover, very few additional
artifacts were recovered from these units. The
northernmost excavated area was sampled by

Technical Report No. 174202

four 1x2m units (N203E109, N213E109,
N215E105, and N220E109), based on the results
from Shovel Tests 9 and 10 (see Table E-1).
Stratigraphy ranged from approximately 15cm
deep (see Figure E-10, lower frame) to over
80cm, including the anthropogenically stained
layer. In spite of the potential for ordered
deposits to be present, artifact recovery was
minimal and is considered indicative of only
sparse and infrequent site visitation rather than
one or more periods of sustained or intensive
occupation.
Unit N231E129 was placed somewhat off the
top of the landform, in a downslope area thought
to have the potential for containing undisturbed
sediments. Controlled excavations continued
over a meter, and were even extended to almost
two meters in a small probe to define what was
thought to be an intrusive feature but which
turned out to be the mold of a tap root for a pine
tree (Figure E-11). No stratified or isolable
components were exposed in this unit.

The plain/decorated sherd ratio (P/DR) for the
41AN159 ceramic assemblage is 3.39. The
principal decorative methods represented are
incised (n=10), engraved (n=5), punctated (n=4),
and brushed (n=3), with one brushed-incised
sherd. The relatively low frequency of brushed
sherds (13.0%), along with the P/DR value of
3.39 suggests that the prehistoric Caddo
occupation at 41AN159 dates some time prior to

Technical Report No. 174202

A.D. 1400 based upon comparisons with nearby
Lake Palestine Caddo sites as well as the
Broadway site (41SM273) on West Mud Creek
(Perttula and Nelson 2004). In the absence of
radiocarbon dates, and with only a few Lake
Palestine Caddo sites for comparison, I suggest
that the Caddo occupation took place perhaps
between ca. A.D. 1200-1300. Almost 14% of the
plain and decorated sherds at 41AN159 are

631

Appendix E: Test Excavations at 41AN159

bone-tempered, which is consistent with a higher
use of bone tempering in earlier Caddo ceramic
vessels, and provides further support for the
speculative chronological placement of the site.
The site is placed in Group IV of the Lake
Palestine Caddo ceramic assemblages (Table E­
6). These sites have fairly low frequencies of
brushed sherds (9.7-18.5%), many sherds with

wet paste decorations (i.e., incised, punctated,
pinched, appliqued), and a relatively high P/DR;
in the case of the latter, that means that more of
the surfaces of the vessels made when the Group
IV sites were occupied were left undecorated
than was the case in later Group I-III Caddo
assemblages, where vessels tended to have
decorations more often on the rim as well as the
body surface

As Perttula and Ricklis (2003) pointed out,
Group I-III Caddo sites at Lake Palestine date
after ca. A.D. 1400, and appear to be Late Caddo
Frankston phase sites.
The 10 incised sherds are from utility ware
vessels, and they include the following
decorative elements: parallel sets of straight

632

lines (n=3); a rim with horizontal and cross­
hatched lines (n=1, probably a variety of Dunkin
Incised); cross-hatched (n=1); and sets of
diagonal lines (n=1), apparently on the vessel
body. The other four incised sherds are body
sherds with a single straight line of
indeterminate orientation.

Technical Report No. 174202

Archeological Investigations at the Lang Pasture Site (41AN38) in the Upper Neches River Basin of East Texas
Texas Department of Transportation

There are fingernail (n=2), tool (n=1), and cane
punctated (n=1) rim and body sherds from utility
ware vessels. The punctations are in rows, either
on the rim or on the rim and vessel body. The
few brushed sherds are from cooking jars have
parallel brushing marks on the vessel body; the
brushed-incised sherd has overlapping incised
and brushing marks.
The fine ware sherds from 41AN159 include
five engraved sherds. Two from bowls or
carinated bowls simply have a single straight
line of uncertain orientation, another has a set of
parallel lines, and a fourth has a set of vertical
engraved lines that may be part of a panel. The
last engraved sherd is from a bottle with a set of
widely spaced curvilinear engraved lines.
Although the sample of engraved sherds is
small, none of the decorative elements present
resemble motifs and elements seen on Late
Caddo Poynor Engraved vessels (Kleinschmidt
1982: Figure 19).
E.8

Definition of Site Components

As no features were recorded at the site, defining
components relies solely on patterns of artifact
recovery correlated with soil profiles and
temporally diagnostic artifacts. Recovery rates
of debitage and FCR in the south area of the site
suggest that a thin component is, or was, present
ranging from approximately 99.40m elevation in
N99E105 upwards towards to approximately
100.30 in unit N111E103. The Yarbrough point
from Level 2 in N104E104 suggests that this
thin component dates to sometime around the
Middle to Late Archaic, though ceramics
underlie this cultural zone in N99E106. It
appears that the stratigraphy and site
components in this vicinity are somewhat mixed
and perhaps redeposited.
Sediments in the central site area, tested by units
N170E106 and N178E106, have been described
as thin and deflated. Two Archaic dart points, a
Trinity point and one untyped point were
recovered from N170E107, from Levels 1 and 3,
indicating that there might have been a
moderately intensive Archaic period occupation
here at one time. However, debitage recovery is
minimal and the soil profiles reflect the loss of

Technical Report No. 174202

unknown amounts of topsoil, leaving what
deposits remain in an insecure geomorphological
context.
The northernmost area of the site, sampled in
units N203E109, N213E109, N215E105, and
N220E109, shows the most robust artifact
recovery from all excavations at 41AN159.
However, debitage counts from these units do
not reveal cleanly or consistently stratified
deposits. The Catahoula point, associated with
ceramics and perhaps with Caddo occupation,
was recovered from Level 3 of N221E109,
although ceramics were also recovered from the
bottom of this unit at 101.50m elevation. While
this sequence is not necessarily out of order, it
cannot be directly compared in any sense with
the sequences indicated in other parts of the site.
Moreover, frequencies of artifact recoveries
from these four units appear to show some
vertical movement of component materials.
In general, Caddo presence at the site is
represented in the ceramic inventory though it is
not well defined in the lithic assemblage, which
instead more strongly reflects the Archaic
period. However, the lack of features or
consistent and stratigraphically ordered deposits
in any unit are clear indications of severe site
disturbance through a number of processes,
including deflation, soil redeposition by historic
agriculture, and natural erosion. These
conclusions are supported by the mapping data
and presence of numerous contour terraces
across the sloped areas of the site landform.
What components are or were present at one
time now appear to be severely mixed,
conflated, and without stratigraphic integrity.
E.9

Conclusions and
Recommendations

By Robert A. Ricklis and Timothy K.
Perttula
As Lohse has discussed above, the testing at
41AN159 revealed evidence of occupation
during the Middle-Late Archaic and during
some part of the prehistoric Caddo occupation in
northeastern Texas. Perttula’s analysis of Caddo

633

Appendix E: Test Excavations at 41AN159

ceramics from the site suggests occupation
relatively early in the regional Caddo sequence.
However, the subsurface investigations at this
site showed the deposits to be significantly
disturbed, probably in large part by historic land
modification associated with contour terracing
that was presumably associated with agricultural
activity. Although test units were placed across
the site, there was no definable continuity in
stratigraphy, and temporally diagnostic materials
(such as pottery sherds) were vertically
dispersed, suggesting considerable disturbance
of the site deposit. Adding to this the relatively
low density of artifacts at the site and the

634

absence of any definable subsurface cultural
features, it seems clear that stratigraphically
isolable components cannot be defined at
41AN159. Given this, the site has little potential
to elucidate either cultural chronology or to
provide information on synchronic community
plan or intra-site activity patterns. Thus, the site
holds little potential for meaningful data
recovery and is not considered to be eligible for
inclusion in the National Register of Historic
Places or to merit designation as a State
Archeological Landmark.
No further
archaeological work is recommended at
41AN159.

FEATURE: 76B, 75-89 cm bs (N199 E203)
VESSEL NO.: 2
NON-PLASTICS: bone
VESSEL FORM: Seed jar or neckless bottle with two
suspension holes (6.4 mm in diameter)
CORE COLOR: Undetermined, but apparently fired in a reducing environment
INTERIOR SURFACE COLOR: Dark brown (7.5YR 3/3)
EXTERIOR SURFACE COLOR: Dark brown (7.5YR 3/3)
WALL THICKNESS: 4.4 mm at the neck
INTERIOR SURFACE TREATMENT: none
EXTERIOR SURFACE TREATMENT: smoothed
HEIGHT: 11.7 cm
ORIFICE DIAMETER: 3.64 cm at the neck
DIAMETER AT BOTTOM OF RIM OR NECK: 9.8 cm near the base
BASE DIAMETER: 6.14 cm
ESTIMATED VOLUME: 0.4 liters
DECORATION: The vessel is decorated with a series of diagonal panels decorated with engraved
or rocker-stamped elements. The rim has a single row of rocker stamping.
From top to bottom on the vessel, the diagonal panels begin with a zone of cross-hatched
engraved pendant triangles inside the panel, followed by a rocker-stamped panel with cross­
hatched engraved pendant triangles (14 and 18, respectively) on the outside of the panel. The
third diagonal panel is filled with rocker stamps (forming triangular areas within the panel) and
very small tick-like rocker stamping on either side of the panel. This is followed by a fourth panel
that is just like the second in having rocker stamping within the panel (forming triangular areas)
and cross-hatched engraved pendant triangles on the outside of the panel. The last panel is
comprised of two diagonal rows of cross-hatched engraved pendant triangles (13 and 15,
respectively), with a row of smaller rocker stamps inside the panel itself.
TYPE: Undetermined engraved-rocker stamped vessel; resembles the Garland Engraved type as
described by Early (1993:90) in having the roughened rocker-stamped zones and the cross­
hatched background or fill elements. Early (2006 personal communication) indicates that vessels
with this shape and decoration may date to ca. A.D. 1400, if not earlier, and are very common in
the Hot Spring County, Arkansas area in the Ouachita River valley. This suggests that Vessel 2
from Feature 76B is a trade ware. Two views of Vessel 2 from Feature 76B: a, view showing
suspension holes and decoration; b, view showing decorative elements on vessel rim and body.

engraved zones or narrow panels repeated three times around the neck. The body has interlocking
horizontal scrolls repeated six times around the vessel (Feature 88, Vessel 1), as in the Poynor
Engraved, var. B examples from the upper Neches River basin. A red clay pigment has been
rubbed in the engraved lines.
TYPE: The design elements (especially those on the body) are reminiscent of several unnamed
varieties of Poynor Engraved, including what has been called Poynor Engraved, var. B. The
vessel form is unique, however.

DECORATION: The upper panel is plain, while the lower panel has a series of triangular and
circular engraved motifs that are repeated seven times around the vessel ( Feature 91, Vessel 1).
The circles, with small hatched pendant triangles, alternate with the triangular motif, which
consists of two triangles that touch at their apex in the central part of the lower panel; the double
triangle motif is also seen in examples of Poynor Engraved, var. O in the upper Neches River
basin, but examples have hatched triangles. Four of the engraved triangles have triangular
hatched areas at each corner of the larger triangle, while three have negative ovals within the
larger triangles, outlined by a series of curvilinear hatched lines at the corner of the larger
triangles.
There is also a single engraved triangle on the interior surface of the upper rim panel.

Feature 91, Vessel 2

DECORATION: The rim is divided into six panels by sets of vertical engraved lines. Each panel
has unique engraved motifs that feature—in varying combinations—circles or ovals, semi-circles,
hooked arm scrolls, pendant triangles, and hatched ovals (Feature 91, Vessel 2). All these
elements are commonly featured on upper Neches River Poynor Engraved vessels, but not in the
combinations represented on Feature 91, Vessel 2.
Moving from left to right on the vessel, the first panel has two semi-circles, with small hatched
pendant triangles on the outer semi-circle. The second panel has a central oval with hatched
pendant triangles, as well as two semi-circles, one of which has pendant triangles; there also is a
small triangular element with a negative oval opposite the central oval. The third and fourth
panels have hooked arm scrolls with hatched pendant triangles. Where they differ is that the third
panel has two semi-circles in one corner of the panel, while the fourth panel has three hatched
pendant triangles. The fifth panel has two opposed hooked arm scrolls with hatched pendant
triangles, a connecting engraved line from one scroll to the other, a hatched negative oval, and
semi-circles pendant from the second of the hooked arm scrolls; the outermost semi-circle has
hatched pendant triangles. The sixth and last panel has a large semi-circle—with smaller
engraved semi-circles within it—and hatched pendant triangles on the outside of the large semi­
circle (Feature 91, Vessel 2).

DECORATION: There is a set of two closely-spaced horizontal engraved lines on the
bottle neck, and three similar sets of horizontal lines on the vessel body. The central
engraved motif—on the mid-point of the body—repeated three times, consists of a large
engraved semi-circle bisected by two sets of closely-spaced vertical engraved lines (this
decorative element is comparable to Poynor Engraved, var. K carinated bowls in the
upper Neches River basin); there are hatched triangles at the top and bottom of these
larger semi-circles (Vessel 41CE-27). Two smaller semi-circles are pendant from these
vertical lines, and each smaller semi-circle has a series of triangular tick marks. A red
clay pigment has been rubbed in the engraved lines.

with a score of 1 being 75 percent to 100 percent complete, 2 being 25 percent to 75 percent complete and 3 being less than 25
percent complete. MNI is the minimum number of individuals represented by that skeletal element. Indet is indeterminant.
Note, also, that Features 91 and 94 are not included in this table due to lack of bone preservation in those features (with the
exception of one tooth in Feature 91).

Notes: The total excludes known individuals who were double counted from Hatchel, Mitchell and Moores which are housed at
TARL. It is not known how many individuals from Burnett’s (1999) data are from TARL, but her Sulphur River data has been
reduced to reflect those re-examined in the Cooper Lake study.

IINNA RESULTS ON A NATURAL CLAY SAMPLE

Prepared by:

Archeological Investigations at the Lang Pasture Site (41AN38) in the Upper Neches River Basin of East Texas
Texas Department of Transportation

The accompanying table shows the
proportional representation of trace elements
in a sample of raw clay obtained by Waldo
Troell (TxDOT) from the Lang Pasture Site,
41AN38 on October 1, 2007. The sample
was excavated, using a hand-held shovel,
from clay that lay beneath the fine sand on
the southeast side of the site, along the roadcut embankment that sloped down toward
Caney Creek. The fist-sized sample was
sent by Troell to Dr. Leslie C. Cecil
(Stephen F. Austin State University), who
forwarded it for analysis to Dr. Jeffrey R.

Ferguson Senior Research Specialist,
University of Missouri Research Reactor
Archaeometry Group (Waldo Troell,
personal communication, 1/18/2008).
The results of the analysis are presented here
for the sake of availability to researchers
conducting studies of clay chemistry with
the goals of elucidating patterns of clay
extraction by prehistoric peoples in the
Texas region and identifying possible
patterns of mobility among these peoples
and/or transport across the landscape of their
ceramic products.
