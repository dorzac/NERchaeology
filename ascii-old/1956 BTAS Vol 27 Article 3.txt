SURFACE ARTIFACTS FROM LA PERDIDA,
STARR COUNTY, TEXAS 1
FRANK

AL

WEIR

La Perdida is an archeological site located about nine
miles north of Rio Grande City in Starr County (Fig. 2).
It is on the northeast bank of Arroyo Los Olmos, a creek
which begins west of Hebbronville and flows some 70 miles
southward to join the Rio Grande just below Rio Gl'ande
City. The arroyo is frequently dry because local rain is its
only source of water.
The importance of the site is brought out by the fact that
Paleo-American material in the form of Clovis, Plainview,
Meserve, Scottsbluff, and Angostura points has been found
with •a great variety and abundance of artifacts usually assigned to the Archaic stage.2 Although Paleo-American
points have been found on other South Texas sites (Sellards,
1940; Orchard and Campbell, 19'54) and in Tamaulipas just
across the Rio Grande (R. de la Borbolla and Aveleyra,
1953), no other site in this region, to the knowledge of the
writer, has yielded such a variety.
The La Perdida site was first discovered in the summer
of 1955 by Milton B. Newton of McAllen, Texas. Mr. Newton, Bob Schutz, and the writer have made several expeditions to the site since then. During this period evidence of
only one hearth was observed. This hearth, consisting of
burned sandstone slabs, is the only one lined with sandstone
to be discovered in the area, to my know ledge. Most hearths
in the Los Olmos area are of thermal-fractured flint, chert,
and agate, the most common stones of the area. It should
also be noted that thousands of flint spalls and snail shells
occur in the site.
1. Appreciation is due Miss Dee Ann Suhm and Dr. Alex D.
Krieger for helpful criticisms and suggestions.

2. The cultural and typological terminology herein follows that
of An Introductory Handbook of Texas Archeology (Suhm, Krieger,
and Jelks, 1954).

DESCRIPTION OF THE SITE
The site itself is exceptionally large for this area. It is
approximately 400 yards long, and 150 yards wide, and, because of stream erosion, is shaped roughly like a horseshoe.
Because of its size it has been suggested that it may be several overlapping sites. There are, however, no visible means
of determining whether this is true or not.
The site has been exposed by water and wind action which
has formed gullies, washes, and blowouts ranging in depth
from a few inches to many feet in some places. The soil exposed is clearly defined into three strata. The first or top
stratum 'is an almost white sand deposit of high alkali content. In the immediate area this deposit is about 12 inches in
thickness. The second stratum, separated disconformably
from the first, is a very dark humus deposit ranging in thickness from 2 to 6 feet. It has been observed that most of the
archeological material was being eroded from the upper limits of this stratum and from the sandy stratum. The third
and last exposed stratum, also discon£ormably separated
from the second, is a tan Pleistocene clay. Incorporated in
this clay are small granules of calkhe, but these occupy only
an extremely small percentage of the deposit. At least 7 feet
of this particular deposit has been exposed by the arroyo.3
Over the entire arroyo the sand and clay deposits are always
present, but the humus deposits are completely absent in
many localities.
The most common plants observed are mesquite, small
thorn trees, grasses, and various cacti. Evidences of deer,
javalina, coyote, and rodent are also present. Undoubtedly
some of these plants and animals were present during occupation of the site and were part of the Indian subsistence.
3. It is of interest to note that remains of two elephants have
been found being eroded from the clay deposits in the lower Arroyo Los Olmos area. One, an adult, was found about four miles
north of La Perdida, and the other, a smaller individual, was found
slightly more than a mile south of Perdida. Gravel was found underlying both animals. No artifacts were reported in association.

ARTIF.NCTS OF CHIPPED STONE
During July, 1955, approximately 900 artifacts were collected by Newton, Schutz, and the writer. These include
choppers, side and end scrapers, gouges, gravers, "drills",
knives, projectile points, shell ornaments, and grooved
stones. A number of worked flakes were found but their
use is indefinite.

Choppers or fist axes (52) (Plate 6, A). These are very
common throughout South Texas. They average about 9 em.
in diameter and 3 to 8 em. in thickness. The cutting edges
were made by percussion. All of the choppers retain a large
amount of the original waterworn and patinated flint surface (Plate 6, A).
Scrapers (about 200). Almost 75 per cent of those found
are side scrapers, the remainder being end scrapers. With
few exceptions the side scrapers are rough with either
straight or convex bits. In general the end scrapers do not
run as large as the side scrapers but the workmanship on
both is similar. All of the end scrapers have convex bits.
"Blade gouges" (11) (Plate 6, E-F). Actually these are
end scrapers chipped on the thick edges of broken blade
fragments and are fairly common (Cason 1952: 225). They
were made from both the bases and the tips of both projectile points and biface knives. All are well made and run
to a maximum length of 4 em. Only one of these was made
from a stemmed projectile point (Plate 9, F).
Gouges (4) (Plate 6, B). Three bi-convex and one bi-concave gouge, referred to by Dr. Cyrus N. Ray as Clear Fork
gouges, were found. These artifacts are well worked on both
faces with one beveled, convex or concave end. Many gouges
of the same forms occur on other sites in the vicinity.
Gravers (5) (Plate 6, D). These are made from flint
spalls with each specimen having only a single small projection or beak. They show retouching only around these
beaks and range from 2 to 5 em. across.

"Drills" (2) (Plate 9, S). These are probably the rarest of
flaked artifacts from this area. Only two were found at this
site. One is a drill tip of tan chert. The other is a basal fragment which is made of opaque agate. The basal fragment is
3.5 em. long and 3 em. wide, and the width of the drill projection is 9 mm. This drill was probably reworked from a
Tortugas point, the most common type of projectile point at
this site.
Knives (about 150) (Plate 6, G-K). These are triangular
or leaf-shape with most specimens having either straight or
convex edges, but a few having asymmetrical edges. They
range in length from '5 to 10 em. The grade of workmanship
runs from very poor to fine.
Projectile Points. A total of 289 points was collected from
the site. The identified types are Tortugas, Lerma, Abasolo,
Matamoros, Catlin, Refugio, Pandora, Desmuke, Langtry,
Kent, Shumla, Lange, and CastrovilLe. The Paleo-American
types are Clovis, Plainview, Angostura, Scottsbluff, and
Meserve.
Tortugas (94) (Plate 7, A-J). This type is the most common at La Perdida, making up almost one-third of the total
found. These are triangular in form with straight and slightly convex blade edges, a few having slightly recurved edges.
The bases are straight, concave, or slightly convex. Basal
thinning is common in this type (Suhm, Krieger, and Jelks,
1954: 482) . The bases of 68 specimens have been thinned
by short longitudinal flaking. The grade of workmanship
on most of these points is good to fine. All specimens are
flint or chert with the exceptions of A and I on Plate 7,
which are petrified wood.
Lerma (51) (Plate 7, K-0). These constitute the second
m ost frequent type from the site. Their blades are slender
and pointed at both ends (Suhm, Krieger, and Jelks, 1954:
440. The edges are convex and the workmanship is usually
fine.
Abasolo (32) (Plate 8, A-E) . The blade edges of these

66

Texas Archeological Society

points are convex with a few being beveled. Bases are also
convex. All specimens are chert except the largest (Plate
8, A), which is translucent agate.

Matamoros (18) (Plate 8, 0-R). This type is the most
abundant of the small dart points. Except for size, the general outline is the same as the Tortugas.
Catan (11) (Plate 8, M-N). Again, like the Matamoros
points compared with the Tortugas points, the general outline of the Catan points is the same as that of the Abasolo
points, the difference being in size (Suhm, Krieger, and
Jelks, 1954: 410).
Refugio (10) (Plate 8, F). All are slender leaf-shaped
blades with either parallel or slightly convex edges and convex bases. Most of these points are rather thick in cross
section (Suhm, Krieger, and Jelks, 1954: 474). The single
specimen illustrated is petrified wood.
Pandora (11) (Plate 8, G-I). Like Refugio points, Pandora
are slender, leaf-shaped blades with either parallel or convex
edges. They differ from Refugio in having straight bases.
Desmuke (9) (Plate 8, J-L). All of these small, shoulderless, and roughly lozenge-shaped points (Suhm, Krieger,
and Jelks, 1954: 416) are chert.
Langtry (11) (Plate 9, A-E). Contrary to most descriptions of this type, all but two specimens have convex blade
edges. A typical Langtry has slightly concave or straight
blade edges (Suhm, Krieger, and Jelks, 1954: 438). The
Langtry points from La Perdida have contracting stems with
straight, convex, or irregular bases.
Kent (5) (Plate 9, P-Q). These are slender, stemmed
points with slightly convex blade edges. The stem edges are
straight with slightly convex to straight bases having rounded corners. Shoulders are almost absent on some specimens.
Shumla (3) (Plate 9, 0). These are strongly barbed, basal-notched points. The blade edges are slightly convex.
The stem edges are straight or slightly expanding with

slightly convex bases (Suhm, Krieger, and Jelks, 1954: 480).
The complete specimen illustrated is flint, 5 em. long and
4cm. wide.
Castroville (10) (Plate 9, F-J). All of these are shouldered and have convex blade edges. The stems are large and
slightly expanding with straight or slightly convex bases.
It is notable that all the Castroville points found here are
shouldered rather than barbed. In central Texas the barbed
form is far more common than the shouldered (Suhm, Krieger, and Jelks, 1954: 408).
Lange (8) (Plate 9, K-N). These points are shouldered or
slightly barbed. The stems are small and expanding with
either straight or slightly convex bases. The blade edges are
slightly convex. All specimens are chert or flint except
Plate 9, N, which is a reworked point of chalcedony. In outline several of the Lange points are similar to Castroville
points but the stems are not as broad.
The following types are generally considered to belong to
the Paleo-American stage:

Plainview (6) (Plate 10, B-G). This is probably the most
common early type in this area. Of those found, only one is
complete (Plate 10, G). All specimens are finely chipped
chert. Blade edges are straight to slightly recurved. Although the recurving is exaggerated on the specimen in
Plate 10, C, this is probably a variant of the Plainview type
(Krieger, personal communication).
Meserve (1) (Plate 10, A). This specimen is flint and
shows fine workmanship. It is 6 em. long and 2.5 em. wide.
The diagnostic beveling of the blade, which is to the right on
both faces, begins 3.4 em. from the base and extends to the
tip. Like at least some of the Meserve points found widely
in Texas, it may originally have been a Plainview point
which was later beveled (Suhm, Krieger, and Jelks, 1954:
450). Haynes (1955: 148) has suggested that some of these
early points were designed with long bodies, so that if the
tip was broken off they could be re-pointed and still have
enough of the original blade left for effective use. Possibly
this was the case with this specimen.

Angostura (4) (Plate 10, J -M and possibly I). These wide
but narrow-based, leaf-shaped points are well worked and
made of chert. Specimen I, Plate 10, is somewhat like an
Angostura point and was found close to other Angostura
points, but no definite classification can be given because
it is very thick in cross-section, is percussion-chipped, and
has no basal smoothing.
Scottsbluff (3) (Plate 10, N-P). No complete specimens
were found, but what we have to work with gives a suggestion of straight and parallel blade edges. The stem edges
are parallel to slightly expanding with straight bases. Fine
workmanship is shown in all specimens. Specimen Q, Plate
10, in some respects resembles the Scottsbluff type. Small
shoulders are represented and a great deal of basal smoothing is present. Except for the basal expansion and concavity,
point Q might have been classified as Scottsbluff. A point
from the Pinos Mountain area in New Mexico, illustrated
by Haynes (1955; Plate 19, K), is almost exactly like this
south Texas point.
Clovis (1) (Plate 10, H). This is possibly the most significant of the Paleo-American finds. The specimen, a basal
fragment, is deeply fluted on both faces and has an extreme
amount of basal smoothing on all but the broken edges. It
seems to have had parallel sides and a deeply concave base
with a width of 2.5 em. The specimen is well worked and is
made from a gray flint which is uncommon in this area, but
is extremely common in central Texas. This artifact may
therefore have been imported from that area.

Only one arrow point was found and it should probably
be classified as an eccentric shape (Plate 9, R). It is 4.5 em.
long and 3 em. wide. The edges are concave and the base is
strongly indented, forming "ears". Such points are very
rare in this area and are prized by many Rio Grande Valley
collectors.

mately 20 fragments of various kinds of marine shells were
found at La Perdida. Only two of these were definitely
identified as artifacts: a small pendant and a bead carved
from conch shell (Plate 7, P -Q). Such artifacts and many
others carved from shell are common in the Rio Grande
delta area (Anderson, 1932).
Found near the sandstone hearth mentioned above was a
grooved awl sharpener (Plate 6, C). This specimen, of gray
sandstone, measures 8 em. long, 7 em. wide, and 3.5 em. thick.
The two grooves, both in the same face, are 4 em. and 3 em.
long. Both are pointed, rounded, and smooth inside.
DISCUSSION
After nine of the "early" points had been found at La
Perdida (Plate 10, B, C, E, F, I, J, M, P, Q) in a single wash
approximately 20 feet across, along with numerous artifacts
of the Archaic stage, it was suspected that artifacts of the
Archaic stage might have become mixed with those of an
earlier or Paleo-American stage by slumping as the result
of erosion. This theory is not feasible, however, for this
wash is no deeper, if as deep, as the surrounding eroded
areas where many Archaic artifacts are found, but no "early"
points.
Next the possibility of cultural overlap was considered.
That is, people of the Paleo-American stage may still have
been living in the area at the advent of Archaic culture.
This theory is weakened by the fact that the "early" points
fo und r epresent several different time levels farther north,
in the Great Plains region .
A third possibility is that of importation. It seems logical
that later Indians would now and then find artifacts of
earlier origin and, through curiosity, carry them back to
their camps and perhaps even re-use them. Except for the
flint of the Clovis point fragment (Plate 10, H), the flint
and chert of th e other "early" points can be fo und both in
Central and in South Texas, but are more common in South
Texas.

78

Texas Archeological Society

The question of where later Indians could have found
these points, however, is still unanswered. As yet no pure
Paleo- American sites have been isolated in Southwest,
South, or Central Texas although several hundred of the
"early" points have been reported from these areas. Only
further research can answer the questions brought up by
the La Perdida site.
