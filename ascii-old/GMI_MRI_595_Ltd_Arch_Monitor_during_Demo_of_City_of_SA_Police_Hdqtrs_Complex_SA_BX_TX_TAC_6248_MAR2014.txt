MANAGEMENT SUMMARY

As part of a proposed land swap agreement made between the city of San Antonio and the
General Services Administration, the city of San Antonio contracted with Ford Powell & Carson
Architects & Planners, Inc., of San Antonio, Texas, to oversee the demolition of the San Antonio
Police Headquarters complex in downtown San Antonio, Bexar County, Texas. Ford Powell and
Carson then contracted with Geo-Marine, Inc., of Plano, Texas, to conduct archaeological
monitoring during ground-disturbing activities during the demolition. Abasolo Archaeological
Consultants were subcontracted by Geo-Marine as the local, on-call, immediate support.
The purpose of the archaeological monitoring during the demolition activities of the former San
Antonio Police Headquarters building and associated structures and facilities (utilities) was to
identify and record any pre-1870 deposits that may exist within the boundary of the property on
New City Blocks 248, 293, and 915 and evaluate their potential for inclusion in the National
Register of Historic Places and/or for designation as a State Antiquities Landmark. As a result of
this intensive archaeological monitoring, no evidence of intact archaeological deposits was
encountered, and none of the potential pre-1870 deposits previously expected were found. A late
1880s–early 1900s-era brick sewer pipe construction was encountered but considered not eligible,
and thus documented and destroyed during pipe/utility removal. Likewise, an early twentiethcentury deposit encountered in contamination pits near San Pedro Creek was also noted, but no
additional work conducted because the material was part of a redeposited fill. Therefore, since no
significant resources were identified within the footprint of the demolished headquarters building,
near San Pedro Creek, or within the utility-removal corridors, no additional work was
recommended for these areas. However, areas that have not been examined closely during this
phase of the demolition project (i.e., parking lots west and south of the building complex) would
require archaeological investigation prior to construction of the new federal building. The
potential for intact archaeological deposits in these unexamined areas is considered to be
somewhat higher than in the headquarters footprint area. Any work prior to and during
construction would be sponsored by the General Services Administration which will coordinate
any and all compliance responsibilities at that time.
All materials generated from this project were permanently housed at the Center for
Archaeological Research at the University of San Antonio.

ACKNOWLEDGMENTS

This project would not have been successful without the help of many people. First and foremost
appreciation goes to John Mize at Ford Powell & Carson and the city of San Antonio for giving
Geo-Marine this opportunity. Several city staff—John Cantu, Cathleen Crabb, and Leticia Arzate
in particular—were diligent in making sure Geo-Marine was notified when needed. San Antonio
City Archaeologist Kay Hindes, was always available for welcomed insights and cooperation.
Michael Hellums and his crew—Doug Niedenberger, George Diaz, Sean Shokrok, Eric Dunn,
and Joel Sanchez—at CPS Energy were extremely patient with all of the archaeological requests
during the utility removal and reroutes, as was James Humphrey of Bartek Construction when
live utilities were encountered during construction. Last, but by no means least, Abasolo
Archaeological Consultants took on the brunt of the on-call local monitoring activities, and the
project could not have been accomplished without its help.
The efforts of several Geo-Marine personnel are greatly appreciated. Leonard Kemp ably
assisted in compiling some cultural and environmental information, and Bill Hersch contributed
to discussions of the pipelines. Erin King created the maps presented in this document. Sharlene
Allday edited this report, and Denise Pemberton was responsible for its formatting and
production. Steve Hunt prepared for final curation the records and photographs generated from
this project.

CHAPTER 1
INTRODUCTION

As part of a proposed land swap agreement made between the city of San Antonio and the
General Services Administration (GSA), the city of San Antonio contracted with Ford Powell &
Carson Architects & Planners, Inc., of San Antonio, Texas, to oversee the demolition of the San
Antonio Police Headquarters complex in downtown San Antonio, Bexar County, Texas. Ford
Powell & Carson then contracted with Geo-Marine, Inc., of Plano, Texas, to conduct
archaeological monitoring during ground-disturbing activities during the demolition (Geo-Marine
project number 30695.00.01). Abasolo Archaeological Consultants were subcontracted by GeoMarine as the local, on-call, immediate support. The city of San Antonio is a political
subdivision of the state of Texas and thus is mandated to comply with the Antiquities Code of
Texas [Title 9, Chapter 191, the Natural Resources Code of Texas], which requires an inventory
of cultural resources within the boundaries of its projects. Accordingly, the present investigation
was conducted under Texas Antiquities Code Permit # 6248. Likewise, as the Texas Historical
Commission (THC) confirmed that the proposed land swap between the city and GSA constitutes
a federal action, the work also falls under Section 106 of the National Historic Preservation Act
(NHPA) of 1966, as amended through 2000 [16 U.S.C. § 470 et seq.; P.L. 89–665; 80 Stat. 915].
The ultimate goal of this investigation was to identify and inventory cultural resources properties
contained within the project area and to evaluate their potential for inclusion in the National
Register of Historic Places (NRHP) and/or designation as a State Antiquities Landmark (SAL).
Following 10 years of assessment studies undertaken by the GSA for constructing a new federal
courthouse (see Adams et al. 2006; Freeman and Green 2008; Salo et al 2002), a decision was
made for the new location: the site of the old San Antonio Police Headquarters complex. This
headquarters complex was situated on the city block bounded by West Nueva Street on the north,
San Pedro Creek on the east, Graham Avenue on the south, and Santa Rosa Avenue on the west
(Figures 1 and 2). This entire location was occupied by the police headquarters, ancillary
buildings, a large communications tower, and a large parking lot. Large light poles, electric
gates, and drainage pipes had been installed within and around the parking lot, with much of the
wiring placed underground. The drainage pipes emptied into San Pedro Creek at the rear of the
property. In addition, buried gas tanks and oil drains had been placed at the southeast corner of
the property at the service shop and filling station. San Pedro Creek has been channelized in this
part of the city and is now within a paved waterway. Other buried utilities (gas, water, sewer)
were at the northeast, northwest, and southwest corners of the property as well as below West
Nueva Street at San Pedro Creek.

In addition to the ground-disturbing activities during demolition, work associated with gas and
water line cut-offs and reroutes located outside the headquarters property during demolition
activities was included in the monitoring investigation. These outside areas were in the
intersection of West Nueva and South Laredo streets, in Santa Rosa Avenue, and on the Bill
Miller property on the south side of Graham Avenue.
Based on the 2007–2008 cultural resources assessment document by Freeman and Green (2008),
a recommendation for more intensive archival research on the proposed property was made (THC
letter May 22, 2008) that would be used to help in the determination of archaeological deposits or
potential historic properties within the project limits. That intensive archival review honed in on
three New City Blocks—248, 293, and 915—divided into 29 lots. The resulting summarizing
document (Freeman and Pfeiffer 2010) included detailed synopses of settlement and development
dating from 1718 to the present, and stated that early (pre-1870) deposits could potentially exist,
but in limited areas. With respect to these potential early archaeological deposits, a plan for
archaeological monitoring portions of the block during groundbreaking demolition and
construction was proposed. The monitoring plan was approved by the City Archaeologist and
THC, and an antiquities permit (#4481) to conduct the monitoring investigations issued on April
10, 2012 (THC letter dated May 9, 2012). The results of these monitoring activities during
demolition are presented here. Since this is a Section 106 action, any and all investigations that
may occur due to the construction of the new federal courthouse will be the responsibility of the
GSA coordinating closely with the THC.
Monitoring fieldwork occurred several times during utility rerouting in 2012 (June 6, 2012; July
24, 2012; August 6, 24, and 29, 2012), and in 2013 (April 8, 2103; June 24, 2013) Geo-Marine
was notified that cultural materials had been encountered during demolition. Melissa M. Green,
the Principal Investigator for the Geo-Marine project, monitored the gas cut-off on the Bill Miller
property on June 6, 2012, and Dr. Harry J. Shafer and Dr. Thomas R. Hester of Abasolo
Archaeological Consultants conducted the remaining field visits.
All collected artifacts, notes, forms, and photographs obtained during this project will be curated
at the Center for Archaeological Research at the University of Texas at San Antonio.

CHAPTER 2
ENVIRONMENTAL CONTEXT

PHYSIOGRAPHY
Bexar County includes portions of three physiographic regions: the Edwards Plateau, the
Blackland Prairie, and the Rio Grande Plain (also known as the South Texas Coastal Plain). The
Edwards Plateau is north and west; the Blackland Prairie is east and southeast; and the Rio
Grande Plain is south and southwest. The Balcones Fault Zone, which runs through this area of
Texas, is characterized by undulating and hilly topography that ranges from about 213 to 335
meters (m; 700–1,100 feet [ft]) above mean sea level (amsl). The area is dissected by small
streams (Taylor et al. 1966). Chert, a raw material for the production of stone tools, is found in
outcrops throughout the project area, particularly in the Balcones area. At the southern fringe of
the Edwards Plateau, the Balcones Canyonlands is a natural subregion of Texas that has a
landscape dissected by numerous high-gradient streams in steep-sided canyons that flow south
and southeast to the Gulf of Mexico (Riskind and Diamond 1988:1).
GEOLOGY AND SOILS
The Geologic Atlas of Texas maps the surficial geology underlying the project area as consisting
of Quaternary Fluviatile Terrace deposits (Bureau of Economic Geology 1983). The U.S.
Department of Agriculture, Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS), shows one soil map
unit within the project area: Houston Black clay, terrace, 1 to 3 percent slopes (HtB-Branyon)
(Natural Resources Conservation Service 2013). The Houston Black Clay, Terrace, 1 to 3
percent slopes is found on stream terraces and prior to urbanization was prime farmland. The
Houston Black Clay soils are moderately well drained. A typical soil profile is a very dark gray,
clay soil that is approximately 86.6 centimeters (cm; 34 inches [in]) deep overlaying a dark gray
clay approximately 50.8 cm (20 in) thick containing a few lime concretions (Soil Survey Staff
2013). Figure 3 shows the geomorphology, hydrology, and soils of the project area. It is
important to note that the project is in an urban area that has been impacted to one degree or
another by the construction of roadways, utilities, and both industrial and residential structures.

CLIMATE
Bexar County has a modified subtropical climate. Winters are mild, with northerly winds
prevailing, and summers are hot, with southeasterly winds prevailing. Strong winds and heavy
rains occasionally occur as the result of tropical storms in the Gulf of Mexico. The San Antonio
area has an average of 265 frost-free days. The warmest months are May through October.
Temperatures rarely fall below -6.6 degrees Celsius (°C; 20° Fahrenheit [F]). The average daily
maximum and minimum temperatures for December–January range from about 4.4 to 15.5°C
(40–60°F), and from 21 to 35°C (70–95°F) for July–August (Taylor et al. 1966:102, 118–119,
Table 11).
Annual precipitation, about 71 cm (28 in), is generally distributed throughout the year, with the
highest rainfalls occurring in May and September. Winter is the period of lowest precipitation.
Thunderstorms account for most of the rain from April through September. Light hail often
accompanies spring thunderstorms. Because of the presence of steep slopes, thin rocky soils, and
narrow valleys/canyons in the northwest, portions of Bexar County are subject to flooding during
heavy rain events. During the winter, snow is rare and most precipitation occurs as light rain or
drizzle. The average minimum and maximum monthly precipitation, respectively, occurs during
November (about 3.6 cm [1.4 in]) and September (about 8.9 cm [3.5 in]) (Taylor et al. 1966:118,
Table 11).
FLORA
As indicated previously, Bexar County is situated in a transitional zone between three
physiographic regions. Therefore, the flora is a mixture of three biotic provinces: the Balconian
(associated with the Edwards Plateau), the Texan (associated with the Blackland Prairie), and the
Tamaulipan (associated with the South Texas Coastal Plain) (Table 1). Each is represented to
varying degrees (Blair 1950).

Vegetation consists of mixed evergreen-deciduous woodlands along the edge of the escarpment,
grading into deciduous woodlands, and finally into forest in riparian and deep canyon settings.
Prior to European settlement, the vegetation setting along the southeastern border of the Edwards
Plateau was predominantly grasslands, with woodlands and forests limited to hillsides and deeply
incised limestone canyons (Weniger 1988). The mixture of grasslands and riparian forests, in
addition to the nearby Blackland Prairie, would have provided prehistoric and the earliest historic
inhabitants of the region with ample game and edible plant resources.
FAUNA
Bexar County is in a faunal transitional zone that is characterized by an intermixture of vertebrate
fauna from other biotic provinces: Austroriparian, Tamaulipan, Chihuahuan, and Dansan (Blair
1950:113–115). Major mammalian fauna include white-tailed deer, raccoon, coyote, fox, bobcat,
opossum, fox squirrel, eastern cottontail, black-tailed jackrabbit, beaver, eastern wood rat, badger,
skunk, river otter, and the extirpated pronghorn and bison (Blair 1950:113–114; Schmidly 1983).
Important nonmammalian species consist of turkey, bobwhite, western box turtle, snapping turtle,
channel catfish, and sunfish (Blair 1950:113–115; Bull and Farrand 1977; Ernst and Barbour
1972; Hubbs 1982; Schmidly 1983; Taylor et al. 1966:3–4). Most of these species were of
economic importance to prehistoric and the earliest historic populations of the region.

CHAPTER 3
CULTURAL CONTEXT

The project area falls within the southern portion of the Central Texas archaeological region. The
archaeological record for Central Texas reflects the full North American cultural sequence;
therefore, evidence of human occupation spans a time period of roughly 12,000 years. The
Central Texas prehistoric cultural sequence is divided into region-specific cultural-historical
subperiods within four broad cultural stages—Paleo-Indian, Archaic, Late Prehistoric, and
Historic—that differentiate the broadly recognized North American cultural trends (Table 2).
These four major cultural stages will not be summarized here, but can be reviewed in detail in
such works on Central Texas as Arnn (2012), Black (1989), Collins (1995, 2004), Hester (2004),
(Johnson 1994), Prewitt (1981, 1985), Suhm (1960), Suhm and Krieger (1954), and Weir (1976).

The Historic period began with Spanish exploration and settlement of Texas (1517–1821),
Mexican statehood (1821–1836), the Texas Republic (1836–1845), and culminated with
American statehood (1845–present). Since 1999, the Texas State Historical Association (2013)
9

has provided a searchable website with articles on both the prehistory and history of Texas.
Printed works on the history of Texas and San Antonio are available from Bannon (1974),
Campbell and Campbell (1996), Chabot (1937), Chipman (1992), Cox (2005), de la Teja (1995),
Fehrenbach (1968), Fox (1989), Hogan (1975), McGraw and Hindes (1987), Montejano (1987),
and Steinfeldt (1978). The archaeological reports of the late Anne Fox are also a significant
resource for the historic period of San Antonio.
Very detailed archival review of the Police Headquarters project area conducted in 2009 honed in
on three early blocks, New City Blocks 248, 293, and 915, that were divided into 29 lots. These
three blocks make up what is now the Police Headquarters parcel block. The resulting
summarizing document (Freeman and Pfeiffer 2010) included detailed synopses of settlement and
development dating from 1718 to the present, and stated that early (pre-1870) deposits could
potentially exist, but in limited areas. The currently proposed archaeological monitoring was
based on the results of that study.

10

CHAPTER 4
METHODS

FIELDWORK
The monitoring was conducted to determine if any of the potential “archaeologically sensitive”
areas exist within the demolition locale and what the possible function and age of the deposits or
features might be. When archaeological materials were identified during monitoring, these
materials were documented (photographed, mapped). If the archaeological materials represented
intact features, limited testing occurred to determine age, function, and their potential SAL/NRHP
eligibility. The decision as to whether to fully excavate a feature or just sample it was made in
consultation with City Archaeologist Kay Hindes. Demolition go-ahead in these areas was
contingent on the recommendations from the city archaeologist and/or THC. However, had the
city archaeologist and THC determined that the feature was significant and additional
investigations were required, these investigations were not to be conducted under this contract,
but would be conducted under a separate scope and budget prior to the land swap with GSA.
Detailed daily notes were kept by the archaeologist. Photographs were taken of the general area,
general demolition activities, and all potential archaeological materials or deposits. A description
of any deposits or features was made for future final reporting. Recording of features and
deposits was made with a hand-held global positioning system (GPS) unit for accurate mapping.
After each monitoring visit, a short report of findings was produced. All measurements were
taken in English rather than metric in order to correspond with construction plans.
Had buried human remains been encountered at any time during subsurface monitoring
investigations, direct work would have been immediately stopped in the area and the city and
THC immediately informed. Under the revised Health and Safety Code (new state law
concerning cemeteries and unmarked graves), further action within and in association with the
remains would be contingent on THC consultation.
All materials generated from these investigations are permanently housed at the Center for
Archaeological Research at the University of Texas at San Antonio.

11

SITE DEFINITION
A site is defined on the basis of content and extent and contains cultural items of at least two
different artifactual materials or classes (e.g., prehistoric stone tool manufacturing debris of
different raw materials, or historic-era ceramics in addition to glass). Should any cultural
resources be located within a trench, the site would be recorded to the extent possible within the
backhoe trench. Cultural remains meeting these criteria are designated as a site, recorded on a
Texas Archeological Site Data Form, and submitted to the Texas Archeological Research
Laboratory (TARL) in Austin for official site trinomial assignment.
NRHP ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA
The assessment of significance of a cultural resources property is based on federal guidelines and
regulations. The criteria (36 CFR Part 60.4 [a–d]) for evaluating properties for inclusion in the
National Register of Historic Places are codified under the authority of the National Historic
Preservation Act of 1966, as amended, and the Advisory Council on Historic Preservation has set
forth guidelines to use in determining site eligibility. Based on Advisory Council guidelines, any
resource that is included in or eligible for inclusion in the National Register is a “historic
property.” Federal regulations state that “The term ‘eligible for inclusion in the National
Register’ includes both properties formally determined as such by the Secretary of the Interior
and all other properties that meet National Register listing criteria” (36 CFR §800.2 [e]).
Subsequent to the identification of relevant historical themes and related research questions, the
following four criteria for eligibility are applied:
The quality of significance in American history, architecture, archeology, engineering, and culture is
present in districts, sites, buildings, structures, and objects that possess integrity of location, design,
setting, material, workmanship, feeling, and association and
(a) that are associated with events that have made a significant contribution to the broad patterns of
our history; or
(b) that are associated with the lives of persons significant in our past; or
(c) that embody the distinctive characteristics of a type, period, or method of construction, or that
represent the work of a master, or that possess high artistic values, or that represent a significant
and distinguishable entity whose components may lack individual distinction; or
(d) that have yielded or may be likely to yield, information important in prehistory or history [36 CFR
Part 60.4 (a–d)].

The principal research objective is to determine whether a cultural resources property possesses
the potential to meet to one or more of the above-defined criteria. Therefore, adequate
information on site function, context, and chronological placement from both archaeological and,
if appropriate, historical perspectives is essential for cultural resources investigations. Because
research questions vary as a result of geography, temporal period, and project design,
determination of site context and chronological placement of cultural properties is a particularly
important objective during the inventory process. The objective of this current project was to
locate and define both horizontally and vertically any cultural resources, document and describe
those resources, and then, when adequate data were present, evaluate each for NRHP eligibility.

12

TEXAS STATE ANTIQUITIES LANDMARK CRITERIA
For purposes of implementing the Antiquities Code of Texas, the Texas Historical Commission
[Commission] is the statutorily created body responsible for protecting and preserving State
Antiquities Landmarks under the Texas Natural Resources Code, Title 9, Chapter 191. A State
Antiquities Landmark is an archaeological site, archaeological collection, ruin, building,
structure, cultural landscape, site, engineering feature, monument or other object, or district that is
eligible to be designated as a landmark or is already officially designated as a landmark. The
state of Texas considers all publicly owned archaeological sites and historic buildings and
structures to have some intrinsic historic value, and the Antiquities Code provides some level of
protection for those sites, buildings, or structures regardless of their size, character, or ability to
currently yield data that will contribute important information on the history or prehistory of
Texas. Additionally, these publicly owned archaeological sites and historic buildings and
structures are protected from vandalism, or other actions meant to take, alter, or destroy them, and
information directly related to the specific location of archaeological sites is restricted from open
records requests. However, not all cultural resources are equally significant to the history and
prehistory of Texas. Some archaeological sites may not possess research value sufficient to
warrant long-term preservation or investigations beyond survey level recordation, and some
historic buildings and structures retain minimal integrity due to damage or deterioration.
Therefore, the issue of whether cultural resources are significant and warrant preservation, and/or
further research (such as archaeological testing and data recovery level investigations), is
addressed through official landmark designation, permit issuance, and rules associated with
enforcement of the Antiquities Code. Sections 191.091 and 191.092 of the Texas Natural
Resources Code provide that archaeological sites and historic buildings and structures on lands
belonging to state agencies or political subdivisions of the state of Texas are landmarks or may be
eligible to be designated as landmarks. Also protected under the Texas Natural Resources Code
(Section 191.094) are specially designated landmarks on private property. [Note: the above
information compiled from Texas Administrative Code, Title 13, Part 2, Chapter 26, Subchapter
A, Section 26.2].
Under the Texas Antiquities Code at the state level, an archaeological site may be considered
significant and be recognized or designated as an SAL. The commission uses one or more of the
following criteria when assessing the appropriateness of official landmark designation, and/or the
need for further investigations under the permit process:
(1) the site has the potential to contribute to a better understanding of the prehistory and/or
history of Texas by the addition of new and important information;
(2) the site’s archaeological deposits and the artifacts within the site are preserved and intact,
thereby supporting the research potential or preservation interests of the site;
(3) the site possesses unique or rare attributes concerning Texas prehistory and/or history;
(4) the study of the site offers the opportunity to test theories and methods of preservation,
thereby contributing to new scientific knowledge;
(5) there is a high likelihood that vandalism and relic collecting has occurred or could occur,
and official landmark designation is needed to ensure maximum legal protection, or
alternatively, further investigations are needed to mitigate the effects of vandalism and
relic collecting when the site cannot be protected [Texas Administrative Code, Title 13,
Part 2, Chapter 26, Subchapter C, Section 26.10].

MONITORING RESULTS

Monitoring was conducted as the demolition of the old San Antonio Police Headquarters
progressed: cut-off and reroutes of utilities, excavation of contamination pits and construction
trenches, and identification of obvious cultural remains. A plan map of the Police Headquarters
parcel shows the areas that were closely examined (Figure 4). Personnel from either Geo-Marine,
Inc., or Abasolo Archaeological Consultants monitored various excavations. Each visit is
discussed separately below by date of visit.
MONITORING CPS ENERGY CUT-OFF, BILL MILLER PROPERTY, GRAHAM
STREET—JUNE 6, 2012
by
Melissa M. Green, Geo-Marine, Inc.
On June 6, 2012, Geo-Marine initiated the monitoring project by observing the excavation of the
CPS gas cut-off and reroute trench on the Bill Miller property located on the south side of
Graham Street across from the San Antonio Police Headquarters property (see Figure 4). A
narrow trench (2 ft wide) 35 ft long was excavated to a depth ranging from 3.3 to 3.6 ft (Figure
5). The trench was perpendicular to Santa Rosa Avenue and located approximately 26 ft north of
the corner of Santa Rosa and Durango Boulevard. The trench walls demonstrated various
disturbances over time through the installation of cast iron, copper, and PVC piping for water and
gas lines, running both parallel and perpendicular to the trench, but for the most part, the walls
indicated gravel and small cobbles in a grayish brown soil profile. Topsoil extended below the
grass to about 13.8 in, with the gravel and cobbles to the base of the trench (Figure 6). A large
chunk of approximately 6.5-in-thick concrete was encountered just below the grass at the
sidewalk on the west end of the trench and was thought to be a cap over the gas line that ran
along the sidewalk that was being rerouted. An old cast iron pipe approximately 3.3 ft east of the
sidewalk was noted at 3.3 ft below the surface. The east end of the trench was expanded into a
4.6-ft wide and 3.6-ft deep pit for the installation of the new gas reroute line. A large yellow
PVC pipe was encountered near the base of this pit along the east wall at 4.2 ft below the surface.
This area was the most disturbed, with several other utilities servicing the Bill Miller complex
located just outside of the building. A single fragment of red machine-made brick was
encountered; it was the only artifact noted in the entire excavation.

MONITORING ALONG SANTA ROSA AVENUE, SOUTH LAREDO STREET, WEST
NUEVA STREET, AND NEAR SAN PEDRO CREEK
by
Dr. Harry J. Shafer and Dr. Tom Hester, Abasolo Archaeological Consultants
July 24, 2012—CPS Energy Cut-Off, West Nueva Street at Casa Navarro
Dr. Harry Shafer of Abasolo Archaeological Consultants arrrived at the site for the excavation for
the CPS gas cut-off and rerouting on the north side of the project area in the middle of West
Nueva Street adjacent to Casa Navarro, but the work was delayed due to concerns about
vibrations from the streetwork (use of an air hammer) and the effects on Casa Navarro. Vibration
monitors had been established in two separate places in Casa Navarro and another monitor on the
new clay tile wall where a mural illustrating Navarro’s place in San Antonio’s history exists.
These monitors were being used to ensure that vibrations from the construction would not
damage the wall or Casa Navarro itself. The monitoring for this was ultimately rescheduled.

August 6, 2012—Reschedule CPS Energy Cut-Off, West Nueva Street at Casa Navarro
On August 6, 2012, Dr. Tom Hester served as the monitor during the excavation of a pit designed
to locate and expose an old gas line on West Nueva Street, just south of its juncture with South
Laredo Street (Figures 7 and 8).
Pavement removal required jackhammers and proceeded very slowly. Beneath one part of the
paving was thick concrete, necessitating the continuance of jack-hammering (Figure 9). A
backhoe (Figure 10) was used to complete the digging and removal of fill. The pit exposing parts
of the old gas line measured roughly 4-x-8-ft (Figure 11).
Upon the establishment of the gas line location and cessation of excavation, two profiles of the
unit walls were sketched (Figure 12; the profiles provide additional data on the deposits). The
unit size measured 5.6-x-6.0 ft and was excavated, in part, to a depth of 6.5 ft. No unusual or
significant cultural material was found. The matrix appeared to be fairly clean fill, though an
occasional brick fragment was found (Figure 13). However, nothing of cultural significance was
encountered, and there was no impact on sites, historic or prehistoric, by this project. No further
work was recommended. Once the pit walls were documented, it was backfilled with sand and
capped with a thick metal plate until a utility crew could accomplish cutting the gas line.

August 24, 2012—Historic Brick Sewer Pipe at West Nueva and South Laredo Streets
On the afternoon of August 23, 2012, a historic brick sewer pipe was exposed during the
construction of the new sanitary sewer at the intersection of South Laredo and West Nueva
streets, and the city archaeologist was called. At the request of the city archaeologist, GeoMarine was contacted and requested Dr. Shafer, the on-call, local archaeologist, conduct the
examination and photodocumentation of the exposed late 1890s-early 1900s-era pipe. Dr.
Shafer’s documentation took place midday on August 24.
The large brick sewer pipe encountered is evidence of the City of San Antonio’s move toward a
modern public sewer and waste-water system at the turn of the twentieth century. Large-scale
urban drainage systems were constructed in commercial areas of New England cities as early as
the colonial period (APWA 1976; Burian and Edwards 2002) as means to move or collect human
waste and other nuisance water away from sources of drinking water (Schladweiler 2013). Early
sewer conveyances were built of wood, brick, stone depending on materials available. In San
Antonio, sewage was gathered in individual or community cess pools and drainage ditches or
disposed of by private entities. Though an organized sewage system was advocated by then
Mayor Bryan Callaghan II as early 1890, it was not authorized until 1894 and only became fully
operational by 1900 (SAWS 2013).

13. Part of a brick found in the excavation

Figure 13. Part of a brick found in the excavation.

The excavation had been temporarily covered with sheet iron plates due to its depth and the size
of the excavation. Once the plates were removed, photographs were taken of the pipe structure.
Due to the depth of the construction trench, all photographs were taken from the original ground
surface above the pipe. The large cylindrical pipe was encountered at a depth of approximately
5–5.6 ft from the top of the pavement. The massive pipe was an impressive piece of construction
composed of two layers of brick laid in an American running bond and was lined on the inside
with a concrete slurry mixture (Figures 14–17). Smaller angled PVC pipes tied into the larger
brick lateral pipe, and the bricks appeared to be have been bonded with standard Portland cement.
Though an impressive structure, the pipe itself did not meet NRHP eligibility criteria. Therefore,
no further archaeological investigation was conducted, and the construction was allowed to
continue.
August 29, 2012—Sanitary Sewer Reroute, West Nueva Street at Casa Navarro
Monitoring by Dr. Shafer of the new sewer system installation continued on August 29, 2012 (see
Figure 4). Shortly after excavation began, several utility lines that ran under West Nueva Street
were encountered: an active 12-in water main and an AT&T phone line encased in PVC pipes
capped with concrete (Figures 18–22). These two lines overlap the planned sewer line, making
installation of the latter impossible as originally planned. The choices were not optimal: either
run the sewer line under the water line (feasible), or remove the phone lines (very costly). No
intact deposits were apparent during the excavation, and no historic features or artifacts were
uncovered.

The seriousness the existing lines imposed to the planned work stalled further excavation until a
decision could be made by city engineers and construction personnel on how to proceed around
the existing lines. Therefore, no monitoring was necessary until the construction crew could
begin work on creating a manhole over the old brick line.
April 8, 2013—Brick Sewer Line Demolition, Santa Rosa Avenue
Dr. Shafer arrived at the old San Antonio Police Headquarters building razing worksite on April
8, 2013, to monitor the demolition of an old buried brick-lined sewer line that transected the
headquarters lot. A large backhoe was used to begin searching for the brick-lined sewer pipe that
had been documented beneath Nueva Street the prior year. The trench began at the Nueva Street
boundary and was excavated southwestward toward Graham Street. Historically, the pipe ran on

the north side of old South Laredo Street, which was once paved with brick, and was
encompassed within the police headquarters block. Traces of the brick street (remnant bricks) in
disturbed contexts had been encountered during earlier excavations.
The pipe was about 3 ft in diameter and sealed with two layers of red brick (Figure 23). The
bricks were heavy, dense, red-fired clay, commonly known as “Chicago” brick, though the origin
of the brick is unknown and the nomenclature is unclear. At this location, the pipe was deeply
buried, 10–15 feet below the present surface, and lying on yellowish gravel. These gravels,
consisting of mostly balls of rolled limestone, were typical of the San Antonio River valley and
were the only intact deposits observed in the entire trench. Using the backhoe, the brick-lined
sewer pipe was excavated to the opposite end of the lot at Graham Street.

Numerous utility lines, including water lines, drainage pipes, gas lines, fiber optic lines, etc.,
crisscrossed the pipeline transect. These much shallower trenches were installed subsequent to
the installation of the brick sewer pipe.
April 9, 2013—Monitoring a Trench at Santa Rosa Avenue
On April 9, 2013, Dr. Hester carried out archaeological monitoring at a pipe-removal trench near
the corner of Graham Street and Santa Rosa Avenue. The pipe removal trench extended along a
roughly east–west line, intersecting the big trench near its southern end (Figures 24–28). Initial
digging was conducted at the west end, next to the massive transmission tower just north of
Graham Street. Although an old abandoned manhole was encountered, there was scant evidence
of a pipeline, which was supposed to be about 3 ft deep. Thus, the backhoe moved to the east

and, after some digging, found another manhole (with metal rim and manhole cover), which as
well was clearly abandoned. Between this manhole and the initial one found at the east end of the
trench, the backhoe uncovered segments of a red ceramic sewer pipe, evidenced as short sections
often collapsed or with some possibly removed at an earlier date. As the backhoe moved
eastward, a PVC pipe encasing a smaller PVC water line was cut, and just east of that were three
small PVC pipes containing transmission lines of some sort—perhaps related to computers in the
old San Antonio Police Headquarters building. There was absolutely no evidence of prehistoric
or historic cultural remains (though the base of one beer bottle was observed). At the east end,
the trench descended down to more than 10 ft. Two basic stratigraphic units were exposed: a
thick construction fill, overlying a dark, almost black, damp, fine-grained soil. It was thought that
this might be in situ sediments derived from San Pedro Creek just to the east. However, there
was absolutely no evidence of any cultural material. As the backhoe moved to the west, the
stratigraphy changed somewhat as the trench was dug to only 6–7 ft in depth. The deposit was
wholly construction fill of varied colors, though tending to be tan overall. When the ceramic
sewer pipes were found, it was clear that they had been laid in a pipeline trench filled with
yellowish gravel and soil.
Construction personnel decided that the trench in its entirety would not be excavated, but rather
that the PVC pipes and the remnants of the sewer line would be removed by heavy equipment as
the redevelopment of the lot continued. Therefore, monitoring was terminated at that time. Since
no intact cultural materials (aside from pipelines) were present, as stated above, no further
monitoring was needed along this trench.

33

June 24, 2013—Contamination Pits near San Pedro Creek
Possible historic materials had been encountered in the investigation for possible environmental
contamination pits next of the old car wash at the police station and were reported to the city
engineer on the morning of June 24, 2013. The report stated that some bricks and other artifacts
had been found between the car wash building and the property line adjacent to San Pedro Creek
in the southeast part of the property. As subcontractor for Geo-Marine for the archaeological
monitoring of this site, authorization from Geo-Marine to do the work was necessary, and
granted. Dr. Shafer arrived that afternoon and examined the historic materials.
Two pits about 4 m square and about 2–3 m deep were excavated to test for contaminate soils.
The profiles showed several distinct layers of fill, with one of these layers containing an
assortment of bricks, horseshoes, broken tiles, some rusted metal, ceramic insulators, cable, a
broken pick mattocks, etc.all representative of the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries
(Figures 29–31). One brick exhibited a portion of a painted mural that probably was part of an
advertisement on the side of a demolished building. One whiteware sherd with a decalcomania
print (possibly hotelware, ca. 1890–1960s [Conroy 1998]) was noted, but none of the artifacts
was indicative of early nineteenth-century trash. The artifacts were clearly part of construction
fill introduced to increase the elevation along the sloping north bank of San Pedro Creek. No in
situ foundations or wall bases that would indicate intact deposits were found. Because these
historic materials were found in redeposited fill, not in their original context, and had no
association with any features or intact deposits, the materials were considered not to meet NRHP
eligibility criteria and no additional work was recommended.

CHAPTER 6
SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS

The purpose of the archaeological monitoring during the demolition activities of the former San
Antonio Police Headquarters building and associated structures and facilities (utilities) was to
identify and record any pre-1870 deposits that may exist within the boundary of the property on
New City Blocks 248, 293, and 915. As a result of this intensive archaeological monitoring, no
evidence of intact archaeological deposits was encountered; and none of the potential pre-1870
deposits (mostly residential and/or Colonial) previously expected was found. Though the turn-ofthe-twentieth-century brick sewer pipe construction was impressive, the pipe did not meet
eligibility criteria or the period of significance so it was documented and removed during
pipe/utility removal. Likewise, the early twentieth-century deposit encountered in contamination
pits near San Pedro Creek was also noted but no additional work considered necessary.
Therefore, no significant historic properties meeting the eligibility criteria for National Register
inclusion (36 CFR Part 60.4 [a–d]) or for SAL designation (36 CFR 60.4, 13 TAC 26.5[6], 13
TAC 26.5[32], and 13 TAC 26.8) were identified during these investigations within the footprint
of the demolished headquarters building, near San Pedro Creek, or within the utility-removal
corridors, and no additional work was recommended for these areas. However, areas that have
not been examined closely during this phase of the demolition project (i.e., parking lots west and
south of the demolished building complex) would require archaeological investigation prior to
construction of the new federal building. As this is a Section 106 action under the NHPA (16
U.S.C. § 470 et seq.; P.L. 89–665; 80 Stat. 915), and the potential for intact archaeological
deposits in these unexamined areas is considered to be somewhat higher than in the headquarters
footprint area, any work prior to and during construction would be sponsored by the General
Services Administration which will coordinate any and all compliance responsibilities at that
time.
