May’s Program to be on Field
Trip to Big Bend National Park

Fort Chadbourne Up Date

Claude Hudspeth will give a Power
Point presentation on the April CVAS field
trip to Big Bend National Park.
The presentation will include five locations most visitors to Big Bend never see.
Included are a pre-historic site with rockart, mortars, and metates. Scenes of Glenn
Springs in 1916 and the present condition of
the site after being cleared by the Park Service in the 1950s will be compared.
Also presented is the Mariscal Mine,
with some interesting drawings of how it
was, and photos of how it is today. We also
visited the famous Johnson Ranch, which
was knocked down by the Park Service.
Photos of before and after will be shown.
Last is a visit to Musk Hog Spring. Claude
did not find the spring, but Jack Woodrow,
Gary Heuimer, and Tommy Deering did,
and they took photographs, so one of them
will tell you all about it.
If you are one of the many that could
not make this trip to the Big Bend, then
don’t miss this opportunity to see what you
missed, or escaped, as the case may be.

The excavations of the Butterfield
Stage Station at Fort Chadbourne are
nearing completion. Thanks to all of
you who helped during the Fort Chadbourne Days. On Friday, around 1,000
school kids from the surrounding area
attended. On Saturday many visitors
came by the sight. Thus far we have exposed all of the foundation, many doors,
three fireplaces, stone footings for floor
joists and many wooden floor joists. We
have uncovered valuable information
that will aid in the re-construction of the
station. A little over 20,000 artifacts
have been recovered thus far and the
nice thing is that we have finished the
lab work on all but three units. In the
largest of the rooms the artifact count
was low (mostly nails and glass). The
other three smaller rooms have produced
larger amounts of artifacts. Artifacts in
one area indicate a trunk had rotted
away. Many artifacts that were within
the trunk and metal parts of the trunk
were recovered. Continued on page 3.

Friends and colleagues: The fifth annual

TAC Festival showcases the world’s

By the way, the discussion about the penny
found in the trunk area during Chadbourne
Days was an Indian-head penny (1864). Indian-head pennies were produced between
1859 and 1907. Many of the artifacts recovered in the smaller rooms are workshop and
horse related. These may have been used during the time the station was in operation or
many could have been the results the ranch era
occupation. Thus far we have learned a lot
about the station and if you have not had the
opportunity to work on this project you still
have a chance.

CVAS Big Bend Field Trip
April, 2008

We have set a workday on May 17th to finish the excavation. We have six units that
need to be excavated. If we can get a good
crew together we can finish by noon. We will
start at 8:30 on Saturday morning and work
until we finish. Bring a sack lunch and plenty
to drink. If you can help on that day please
RSVP so we know if we have enough workers
for the day.
I would like to commend the CVAS and
SMART group on a job well done. An excavation of this magnitude usually lingers on and
on when volunteer groups are involved. In
one month you have excavated and labbed 204
units. Thanks to all of you who have worked
so hard on the project.
On a sad note: many of you knew Pat
Meyer (member of the SMART group). She
and Roger became members of the CVAS during last years excavations of the Officers'
Quarters (Ranch Headquarters). Pat passed
away last week and will be buried in Altus,
Oklahoma on Tuesday. We, the CVAS express
our sympathy to Roger and his family.
Hope to see many of you on May
17th. There is still time to be part of an exciting adventure in archeology.
