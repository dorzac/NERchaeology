ABSTRACT
In March 2007 Deep East Texas Archaeological Consultant (DETAC) conducted a
cultural resource management survey of the proposed City of Lakeport wastewater
treatment facility under Antiquities Permit 4479. The pedestrian survey was conducted
with a combination of visual examination and shovel testing. A total of 23 shovel tests in
the area were all negative. No artifacts were collected. No further investigations are
recommended however, if any cultural material is recovered during construction, than
excavation should stop and a qualified archaeologist contacted to evaluate the impact.
DETAC is requesting concurrence with the determination of “no effect” on NRHP
eligible properties for the proposed project area.

INTRODUCTION
In March 2007, DETAC (Deep East Texas Archaeological Consultant) conducted a
cultural resources survey of the proposed City of Lakeport Wastewater Treatment Plant
in Gregg County, Texas (Figure 1). The survey was conducted upon request of the Texas
Water Development Board under Texas Antiquities Permit number 4479 as the funding
for the project initiated with the State of Texas. The report was reviewed by the Texas
Historical Commission.
The purpose of this survey was to locate, describe and record any cultural resources
within the project area boundaries. The report was prepared following the short report
format outlined by the Council of Texas Archaeologist (CTA) (1995a) with modifications
requested by the THC (Martin 1999). No cultural resources were found during the
survey. Based on fieldwork, DETAC recommends a determination of “no effect” to
cultural resources for the well pad and access road.
DEFINITION OF STUDY AREA
The project included a 152 x 152 meter (500 x 500 ft) area approximately 120 m (390 ft)
south of the Sabine River and approximately 320 m (1150 ft) southeast of the existing
wastewater treatment plant for the city of Lakeport, Teas. The project plans include
constructing the plant and utilizing the existing access facilities for the old plant. Project
area boundaries were delineated surveyor’s rebar corner posts at the time of the survey.

PREVIOUS RESEARCH AND CULTURAL HISTORY
Overall, Gregg County has been part of broad studies and investigated in both larger
examinations and numerous small surveys. The closest large-scale investigations were
conducted in nearby Rusk, Panola, and Harrison Counties. These investigations were
conducted primarily for the several strip mines under the Environmental Protection
Agency and Railroad Commission (Nash 1994; Sherman 2001). Small-scale surveys
were conducted for several pipelines and road improvements throughout the area as well
(Drake 2000; Perttula 2000).
In addition to the fieldwork referenced above, several documents have added significantly
to available information on the archaeological record in this region. The documents of
primary importance are D.A. Story's (1990) and J.A. Guy's (1990) discussions of the Gulf
Coastal Plain. Additionally, the Texas Historical Commission, Department of Antiquities
Protection developed a document for the eastern Texas portion of the Texas State Plan
(Perttula and Kenmotsu 1993). This document includes several historic contexts, each of
which deals with a particular facet of northeast Texas prehistory. This plan serves to
synthesize the current state of archaeological research in the region and identify problems
and objectives to be addressed in future research and cultural resources management.
Several weak areas in archaeological knowledge of the region are identified in these
studies. Cultural chronology, aboriginal settlement patterns and subsistence, and historic
continuities are some of the general research directions that these recent studies emphasize
as important for developing future archaeological research designs.
The occupation of the area ranges from the Paleoindian (ca. pre-7000 B.C.) to Archaic
foraging cultures (ca. 7000-200 B.C.), Early Ceramic Period groups (ca. 200 B.C. - A.D.
800), the sedentary Caddoan occupation (A.D. 800 - 1680), and ends in the historic Euro
American settlement (Perttula and Kenmotsu 44:1993). The Paleo-Indian period (ca.
10,000-7000 B.C.) is characterized by small, mobile bands of hunters and gatherers that
consumed a variety of native plants and animals (Story 1990). The Archaic (7000-200
B.C.) refers to hunter-gatherers who implemented more regionally specialized approaches
toward exploiting their environment (Story 1990). The Early Ceramic (200 B.C.-A.D. 800)

3

stage, also referred to as the Woodland period, represents an increasing utilization of the
environment by local groups to include a greater reliance on cultigens, prolonged
occupations at specific locales indicating an increasingly sedentary lifestyle, and the
emergence of social and ritual ceremonies (Story 1990). The prehistory of east Texas in
the Late Prehistoric period essentially concerns the Caddoan culture (A.D. 800-1600). This
culture is an indigenous development strongly influenced by the Mississippian tradition of
the Lower Mississippi Valley (Story 1990). Larger aggregates of people became sedentary
and constructed villages with public ceremonial areas and cemeteries found in association
with large mounds. A stratified social structure developed, corresponding to the chiefdom
level as first defined by Service (1962, 1975). Extensive commercial networks were also
established. The Historic period (1680-present) describes both the history behind the
current cultural setting of the area and marks a transition from the native populations
domination of the area, to the American immigrants establishment of farms, towns, and
counties. Today, the area remains largely agricultural and produces crops including cotton,
corn, hay and vegetables. Beef and dairy cattle, as well as hogs, are also raised. The
timber and oil industries currently play a prominent role in the area’s commercial
enterprises (Webb 1952).

RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODOLOGY
The investigations were preformed in compliance with the National Historic Preservation
Act of 1966 (PL89-665), as amended in 1974, 1976, 1980, and 1992; the National
Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (PL91-190, 83 Stat. 915, 42 USC 4231, 1970); and the
guidelines set forth by the CTA (1995b), the Texas Antiquities Code, and the Register of
Professional Archaeologists.
The program of site definition was conducted in accordance with the National Park
Service criteria (36 CFR, part 60.4) which present the guidelines for determining
eligibility of a cultural resource for nomination to the National Register of Historic Places
(NRHP). The objectives of the survey were to locate prehistoric and historic cultural
resources sites within the survey areas. If sites were found, then the investigations were
to delineate the vertical and horizontal extent of each site, determine each site’s integrity,
and provide a preliminary evaluation of each site’s potential for NRHP eligibility.
Before initiating fieldwork, DETAC conducted a records and literature review using maps
and files at the Texas Archeological Research Laboratory (TARL) and at the Texas
Archaeological Site Atlas (THC 2007). The site location maps and cultural resources
records at TARL were consulted to identify the location, types, and both State
Archaeological Landmarks (SAL) and NRHP eligibility of previously recorded sites within
or in close proximity to the project areas. The Site Atlas was consulted for published and
unpublished data regarding cultural resource surveys.
DETAC conducted a 100 percent pedestrian survey of the area. To locate sites, the
pedestrian survey relied on visual examination and shovel testing. Visual examinations
were conducted in areas with exposed soil surfaces in a continuous effort between shovel
tests at all locations with exposed surfaces. Shovel testing was conducted in accordance
with the Texas Historic Commission’s guidelines for cultural resources surveys.
According to these guidelines, project areas between 1.2 and 4 hectares (3 and 10 acres)
require a minimum of two shovel test per 0.4 ha (1 acres); therefore, a total of 11 shovel
5

tests were required for the 2.3 ha. (5.7 ac.) area. Shovel testing included excavating an area
approximately 30 cm (12 inches) in diameter in 10 cm (4 inch) levels down to the clay
substrate or 90 cm (35 inches). The excavated matrix was screened through a 0.635 cm
(0.25 inch) wire mesh screen. The depth, soil type, and color of each shovel test were
recorded.

RESULTS
The closest documented cultural resources survey was a survey by the Texas Highway
and Transportation Department along Hwy 149 in 1975 roughly 200 m (700 ft) south of
the project area. Other surveys conducted in the area were primarily for oil interests
roughly 3 km (2 miles) southeast of the project area.

This work resulted in the

documentation of 41GG104, on a low sandy rise in the Sabine River floodplain. These
investigations found the remains of a post hole and associated artifacts on an isolated
sandy landform in the floodplain (Galan 2006).
Soils in the project area were described as Latch/Mollville complex. Both soils formed
on river terraces but different topographic locations.

Latch soils are elevated well

drained, deep loamy fine sand soils while Mollville soils occur in depressed areas and are
very fine sandy loam with gray and red mottles over clay (NRCS 2005).

The

combination of topographic location suggests the lower areas have a lower probability for
containing cultural resources while the elevated areas have a higher probability of
containing cultural resources.
The pedestrian survey found that the area was dominated by a dissected sandy ridge
overlooking lower-lying areas with evidence of ponded and slow draining water. A once
paved road crosses the area along with sewer pipelines. The road and pipelines are part
of the current wastewater treatment facility northeast of the project area (Figure 2).
Vegetation was a mixture of immature mixed hardwood and pine forest with scattered
mature hardwood and pine trees. Push piles and cutting associated with the road crossed
the slopes of the mounded sandy soil. Understory was moderate to dense with both
saplings and various briers indicative of logging in the past 10 years. A total of 23 shovel
test were excavated in the area focusing on the higher sandy soil areas (Figure 2). Shovel
testing found soil conditions similar to the soil survey with varying depths and colors of
sandy to clayey loam. The lower areas collect and slowly drain water resulting in more
grey/red mottled colors and silt or clay deposits. No cultural material was observed in the
shovel testing or during the surface inspection. Shovel test results are described in table
1.

SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS
The archaeological survey of the proposed Lakeport wastewater treatment facility was
conducted upon request of the Texas Water Development Board for the City of Lakeport.
Previous investigations in the area, topography and soil conditions suggest the area has a
high probability for containing cultural resources. However; surface inspection and
shovel testing did not reveal any evidence of past occupation.
In conclusion, the investigations did not document any cultural resources. Based on the
investigations, there is little chance of encountering cultural resources in the project
areas. DETAC is requesting a concurrence with the determination of “no effect” on
NRHP eligible properties for the proposed project areas.
