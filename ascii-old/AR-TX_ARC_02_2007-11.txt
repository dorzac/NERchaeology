ABSTRACT
The City of Grand Prairie intends to construct the approximately 2.5 mile
long Grand Prairie Thirty-Inch Water Pipeline Route which begins at a
business park north of Carrier Parkway in Tarrant County and runs
generally east to Roy Orr Boulevard. The pipeline will be attached to the
bridge over the West Fork of the Trinity River and then will run generally
east along the floodplain of the river until it encounters Hardrock Road.
The route parallels Hardrock Road southeast and terminates northwest of
the intersection of Hardrock Road and Wildlife Boulevard in Dallas
County. Much of the area has been disturbed by road, office complexes,
residences and mining activities.
On February 8 and March 1, 2007, AR Consultants, Inc. conducted an
intensive pedestrian archaeological survey of an upland portion of the
proposed route between the business park and Roy Orr Boulevard and
deep testing in the West Fork floodplain east of Roy Orr Boulevard. The
archaeological survey was done for Freese and Nichols, Inc. which is
doing the environmental permitting for the City of Grand Prairie. No
archaeological sites were found in the upland portion, but site 41DL449,
which consists of a freshwater mussel shell and bone scatter, was found
buried a meter beneath the ground surface in the West Fork floodplain. No
lithic materials, fire-cracked rock, charcoal or hearth was found associated
with the scatter. The site appears to be on the surface of a developed soil.
The site was excavated during the deep testing. The site is deemed
ineligible for nomination to the National Register of Historic Places or as a
State Archaeological Landmark due to the absence of diagnostic artifacts.
AR Consultants, Inc. recommends that further cultural resource
investigations are unwarranted due to the absence of archaeological sites
in the upland area and the excavation of site 41DL449 during deep testing
of the West Fork floodplain. However, if buried cultural materials older
than 50 years are encountered, work should stop immediately in that area
and the Archeology Division of the Texas Historical Commission should
be notified. In addition, if the cultural materials older than 50 years are
uncovered within the West Fork’s floodplain, the Fort Worth District of
the US Army Corps of Engineers also should be notified. Work should not
continue until consultations with the appropriate agency have been
conducted.

INTRODUCTION

On March 2, 2007, AR Consultants, Inc. (ARC) conducted an intensive pedestrian
archaeological survey and deep testing in the floodplain of the West Fork of the Trinity
River on the east side of Roy Orr Boulevard in Grand Prairie, Texas for the proposed
Grand Prairie 30-inch diameter water pipeline route. In addition, an upland area west of
Roy Orr Boulevard and south of the West Fork was investigated (Figure 1). The
archaeological survey was conducted for Freese and Nichols, Inc. which is doing the
environmental permitting for the City of Grand Prairie. The pipeline route is
approximately 2.5 miles long and begins about 860 feet north of Carrier Parkway in a
office complex in Tarrant County and runs generally east to Roy Orr Boulevard. The
pipeline route then turns north and crosses the West Fork of the Trinity River. The
pipeline will be attached to the bridge over the river. North of the West Fork, the
proposed pipeline route runs east, turns north, then back east and then generally southeast
until it encounters Hardrock Road. The route parallels Hardrock Road southeast and
terminates approximately 585 feet northwest of the intersection of Hardrock Road and
Wildlife Boulevard. Much of the area has been disturbed by road, office complexes,
residences and mining activities.
The cultural resource investigation was required because the City of Grand Prairie is a
political entity of the State of Texas and Texas Antiquities Permit Number 4331 was
issued for the archaeological survey. In addition, since the pipeline will cross waters of
the United States, the proposed pipeline route falls within the jurisdiction of the Fort
Worth District of the US Army Corps of Engineers. Relevant federal legislation includes
the National Historic Preservation Policy Act of 1966, as amended (PL-96-515), the
National Environmental Act of 1969 (PL-90-190), the Archeological and Historical
Preservation Act of 1974, as amended (PL-93-291), the Clean Water Act, as amended
PL92500 and the Rivers and Harbors Act of 1899. The Archeology Division of the Texas
Historical Commission not only will review this report as the State Agency, but also as
the Section 106 review agency.
This report is written in accordance with the guidelines for reports adopted by the
Archeology Division of the Texas Historical Commission, and developed by the Council
of Texas Archeologists (N.D.). The following report presents a brief description of the
natural setting of the project area, followed by a discussion of the archaeology and
history. A chapter on the research design and methodology employed in the investigation
is then followed by the results of the field investigation. The report concludes with
recommendations followed by the references cited.

NATURAL ENVIRONMENT
The study area is located on the north bank of the West Fork floodplain and on a ridge
overlooking the West Fork. The proposed water pipeline route crosses the Houston
Black-Heiden and Trinity-Frio Soil Associations in Dallas County (Coffee et al.
1980:General Soils Map) and the Batsil-Silawa Soil Association in Tarrant County
(Ressel 1981:General Soils Map). The upland ridge in Tarrant County is mapped as
containing Silawa fine sandy loam with 3 to 8 percent slopes (Ressel 1981:Sheet 33) and
the portion of the pipeline route investigated in Dallas County is mapped as being
frequently flooded Frio silty clay (Coffee et al. 1980:Sheet 29). The subsoil for the
Silawa series is described as being 6 inches (9 cm) (Ressel 1981:107), and the C horizon
for the Frio series is listed as being 53 inches (132.5 cm) below the ground surface
(Coffee et al. 1981:60).
The underlying geology consists of the Eagle Ford Shale Formation which is covered by
Quaternary age terraces along the proposed pipeline route (Bureau of Economic Geology
1988). The channel of the West Fork is mapped as containing Quaternary alluvium.
The West Fork has incised a wide floodplain through both Lower Cretaceous- and Upper
Cretaceous-aged bedrock and reached its lowest base level about 18,000 years ago
(Ferring 1986:Figure 4). Since then, it has alluviated as carrying capacity varied and
aggradation increased. The meandering channel has left behind a series of sloughs and
cut-off meanders which apparently stabilized about 2,000 years ago (Ferring in
Shaunessy, Jurney, and Yedlowski 1994:5). These geological processes have buried a
complex web of channel and levee deposits which span the past 20,000 years.
Remnants of a bottomland hardwood forest occur in the West Fork floodplain and in a
pre-1900 condition it would have provided habitat for deer, quail, dove, rabbit, squirrel,
raccoon and other animals (Jurney 1988; Martin 1988; Ressel 1981:57). The bottomland
hardwood forest is a western extension of the forest from downstream on the Trinity (US
Fish and Wildlife Service 1985). In its native state, elm and postoak were the dominant
trees, along with hackberry, Spanish oak, and elm. Various fruit and nut producing
species included bur oak, red haw, walnut, pecan, gum bumelia and mulberry. Upland
tree cover outside of the valley was composed primarily of post oak and blackjack oak
(Peter and Jurney 1988).
A consensus about the paleoenvironmental conditions of North-Central Texas over the
past 12,000 years has not been reached. Discussions by Prikryl (1993), Ferring (1990),
Humphrey and Ferring (1994) and Brown (1998) offer disparate interpretations based on
different analytical approaches. The following discussion relies heavily on Ferring's
investigations and focuses upon the past two thousand years. Correlating periods of rapid
alluviation with higher precipitation and slow alluviation with drier conditions, Ferring
has concluded that the Late Holocene [5000 yr B.P. to the present] was a wet period with
moderate alluviation, except for a dry period between 2000 to 1000 yr B.P. [A.D. 11000]. It was during this dry period that the West Fork Paleosol was established on the
stable surfaces of the river meanders along the Upper Trinity and its tributaries. This

interpretation is supported by changing patterns seen in stable isotope analysis. Brown
(1998) offers a different interpretation based on isotopic analyses of mussel shells from a
prehistoric site (41DL270) on Denton Creek. He concludes that the period from 1500 to
2500 yr B.P. was cooler and/or wetter and that before and after that time period, the
environment was warmer and drier. He points out, however, that this interpretation may
only be applicable for the Elm Fork tributary and not the region.

REVIEW OF WEST FORK FLOODPLAIN STUDIES
This chapter reviews archaeological investigations and soil studies in the floodplain of
the West Fork of the Trinity River between Fort Worth and Dallas over the past fifteen
years as they have a bearing upon the potential for finding buried prehistoric sites in the
study area along the West Fork. The presentation begins with the on the east side of Fort
Worth and ends just east of the study area. A prehistoric chronology, based on Prikryl
(1990), and an added historic period, for North Central Texas is presented below to
provide the reader with a time framework for the previous occupation discussed below.

Archaeological Investigations
The First Street Bridge site (41TR138) is located on the east side of Fort Worth (Largent,
Hunt and Peters 1991). The site consists of four concentrations of mussel shell and/or
burned rock on the south bank of the West Fork. The site deposit extends from one to
four meters below the surface in what the authors refer to as a deposit topped with the
West Fork paleosol. The site shows evidence of repeated occupation and inundation
which is common for sites on the West Fork, although few had been documented.
The River Bend site (41TR68) was located on the north side of the West Fork midway
between the Gateway section and the mouth of Village Creek. The site was tested in 1987
(Peter 1987) and is an example of a specialized foraging camp that was repeatedly
reoccupied between AD 850 and 1350. Low quantities of artifacts and virtually no
curated tools were found, although a wealth of burned rock and mussels shells were
present. Faunal remains included bones of deer, bison, rabbit, frog and turtle, but it was
concluded that the large mammals were butchered elsewhere (Peter 1987:32). Four rock
features were uncovered and radiocarbon dates of AD 1200+50 (Beta-22487) and AD
1330+100 (Beta-22488) were obtained from charcoal. Archaeomagnetism yielded dates
between AD 1350 and 1450.
AR Consultants, Inc. (Todd and Skinner 2002) conducted an archaeological
reconnaissance of four areas for the creation of wetland mitigation banks. Despite
intensive investigation, no cultural materials were found in the survey areas. One site,
however, that consisted of mussel shell, fire-cracked rock and bone that was

approximately 100 m long and 3 m below the surface, was found eroding from the bank
of the West Fork outside one of the survey areas.
River Legacy Park is a City of Arlington park that extends west from FM 157 almost to
Greenbelt Road and is situated along the south side of the West Fork channel. Ferring's
survey of the park area (1994) located four prehistoric sites (41TR143-146) exposed in
the riverbank. He also described the Old Bridge Geologic Section from the south bank of
the West Fork to just east of the Rough Green site (Skinner and Caran 1997; Skinner,
Caran and Trask 1999). The Old Bridge section includes four units (A-D). Unit A
consists of laterally accreted sands and silts and is related to the Sanger Alloformation
which is mid-Holocene in age (10,000 to 5,000 B.P.). A moderately developed soil with a
thick A-horizon is present at the top of Unit A. Unit B consists of calcareous silts and
clays with a prominent buried soil on top of the unit. This has been termed the West Fork
Paleosol. All of the recorded river bank sites are contained in this unit from near its top to
four meters below the surface. Unit C consists of discontinuously exposed younger
channel fills that are inset onto Units A and/or B. Unit D consists of recent alluvium that
covers all exposures of units B and C.
Two sites were discovered by AR Consultants, Inc. (Todd and Skinner 2003) during an
archaeological survey of the proposed expansion of MacArthur/Meyers Road north of US
30. Site 41DL426 was discovered in the West Fork’s floodplain and consists of mussel
shell, fire-cracked rock, bone and a charcoal and ash lens. Site 41DL425 was recorded on
the south bank of Bear Creek just north of the West Fork. The site contains at least two
shell lens overlying one another. Bone, charcoal, freshwater mussel shells, fire-cracked
rock, four pieces of lithic debris and an unusual deer antler tool (?) were recovered during
test excavations.
Two prehistoric sites were located during the survey of a pipeline that crossed the
western part of River Legacy Park and continues north across the river before connecting
with a Trinity River Authority (TRA) pipeline (Skinner and Caran 1997). The Rough
Green site was discovered by shovel testing and was defined using augering and backhoe
trenching. A deeply buried prehistoric site, 41TR164, was located by backhoe trenching.
Extensive testing at Rough Green (Skinner, Caran and Trask 1999) found Late Archaic
and Early Late Prehistoric occupations situated along the overbank levee paralleling
Walker Branch before the West Fork pirated the creek. It was concluded that the primary
function of the site was to collect bur oak acorns, although evidence of hunting deer and
other mammals and gathering freshwater mollusks was found in the site deposit.
In 1994, the Archaeology Research Program (ARP) of Mercyhurst College recorded two
sites (41TR141 and 142) east of FM 157 in the West Fork floodplain (Shaunessy, Jurney
and Yedlowski 1994:1). Both sites are located along an old meander of the West Fork.
Testing at site 41TR141 yielded a Middle to Late Archaic Palmillas dart point, as well as
other artifactual and ecofactual materials. Subsequent testing of site 41TR142 and other
floodplain deposits for buried cultural horizons was conducted in 1996 by Geoarch
Consultants (Ferring and Byers 1996). Testing revealed the presence of an abandoned
meander belt system in the floodplain west of site 41TR142. The site was shown to

contain a preserved Late Archaic deposit over an area of about 20,500 square meters. The
floodplain site is considered to be the largest such site in the West Fork below Lake
Bridgeport (Ferring and Byers 1996:12). Mussel shell and animal bone are present, in
addition to lithic artifacts and fire-cracked rock.
Testing of additional prehistoric sites (41TR167) was conducted by the Texas
Department of Transportation in conjunction with planning for a hiking and biking trail
between FM 157 and Highway 360 (Ellis 1998). The site is described as an example of a
"…zone containing a large number of 'localities' (Binford 1980) where small-scale,
limited-function resource exploitation events occurred (Ellis 1998:11)." The upper part of
the site sediment column is described as an A-horizon that has no clear evidence of the
West Fork Paleosol. A single radiocarbon date from the lower part of the occupation was
dated at A.D. 900 but was not associated with temporally diagnostic chipped stone tools.
Downstream and also on the north side of the West Fork, Geo-Marine, Inc. found a
buried prehistoric site reported as 41TR174 with the limits of a proposed pipeline route
designated as WF-11B by the Trinity River Authority (Burson, Hunt, Peter and
Shanabrook 2000). After a record's search, the authors realized that their new site was
probably part of Ellis' site, 41TR167, which has been radiocarbon dated to about a
thousand years ago. At site 41TR174, cultural materials were found from 48 to 200 cm
below the surface. This zone was described as the West Fork Paleosol and a radiocarbon
date from near the base of the paleosol was dated A.D. 330+50 (Beta-131368).
Previous Investigations
No archaeological surveys or archaeological sites are listed on the Texas Archeological
Sites Atlas (2007). AR Consultants (Trask et al. 1995) conducted an archaeological
survey southwest of Hardrock Road and adjacent to the Grand Prairie Gun Club
(formerly the Arlington Sewage Disposal Plant).Two shovel tests were excavated in the
approximately 6 acre study area and, based upon the shovel tests, it was determined that
the whole area had been disturbed in the past. The survey is across the river from where
the proposed pipeline terminates.

RESEARCH DESIGN & METHODOLOGY
Regular flooding of the West Fork floodplain and the destruction of the floodplain and
the extensive quarrying of floodplain sediments eliminated historic occupation as a major
focus for this investigation. The following research questions were posed to be answered
at the time this project was begun.
-It was expected that sediments containing evidence of prehistoric
occupation would be found buried under the recent floodplain sediments
along the north bank of the West Fork and that the most recent of these
site deposits would be found more than a meter below the present surface
and associated with the top of the West Fork Paleosol.
-It was further expected that a deeper occupation would be found and
would provide evidence of earlier visitation to the drainage edge.
-It was further expected that sites would be located adjacent to the present
channels in settings including the floodplain and buried levees, all within
one hundred meters of the channels. While we recognize that most of this
study area is within the 100 m limit, this question is relevant to all
research within the West Fork floodplain.
The West Fork of the Trinity River has been shown to have a good potential for
containing buried prehistoric archaeological resources (Ferring 1990). Ferring (1986:108)
states that sites with better preservation potentials are those that occur either above or
below the West Fork paleosol. Although lateral channel movement of the West Fork may
have destroyed some sites, this movement, along with siltation, is likely to have buried
prehistoric sites under the present surface.
The field team conducted a pedestrian survey along the portion of the pipeline route
adjacent to the West Fork. Shovel testing was not done because shovel testing has been
shown to rarely penetrate the recent alluvium in the West Fork floodplain. The proposed
pipeline route right-of-way is approximately 50 feet and the pipe will be buried from 5 to
6 feet below the ground surface. The deep testing recommended by the Council of Texas
Archeologists (2002) was exceeded. Soils were described following the procedures
developed by Vogel (2002). In order to meet OSHA requirements, all trenches were
stepped; the trenches ranged from triangular to roughly square in shape to insure safety
and this also allowed the archaeologists to be able to view more area than a narrow trench
would have provided. The trenches were 5 m long and about 2 m deep. No shovel testing
was done in the upland portion of the survey area west of Roy Orr Boulevard due to the
good (at least 50 percent) ground visibility. Photographs of both areas were taken as were
notes on the topography, vegetation and other relevant data.

RESULTS
Most of the proposed pipeline route has been disturbed by mining and the construction of
residences. However, two areas appear to be undisturbed. An upland area west of Roy
Orr Boulevard and a portion of the West Fork floodplain east of Roy Orr Boulevard. The
deep testing within the West Fork’s floodplain is discussed first and is followed by a
description of the upland archaeological survey. Site 41DL449 is described next and
conclusions derived from the survey end the chapter. Backhoe trenches are described
generally in the text, but specific information is provided in Table 1. Backhoe trench
locations are shown on Figure 4.
Deep testing
Three backhoe trenches were placed within the West Fork’s floodplain. The area is
forested by hackberry, American elm and bois d’arc trees. Understory vegetation includes
saw greenbriar, grape vine, dandelions, johnson grass, clover, native grasses and bushes.
Eye-height visibility was excellent, but ground visibility was less than 10 percent. The
vegetation is shown in Figure 2. A ditch (Figure 3) is present about 150 m east of Roy
Orr Boulevard and is not shown on the USGS map. The ditch apparently was formed
from run-off from the road and is approximately 5 m deep and wide. No buried cultural
materials were seen in the 45-degree sloped bank walls.

Approximately 245 m of pipeline route were investigated by three backhoe trenches. No
cultural materials older than 50 years were seen on the ground surface prior to the deep
testing. The first backhoe trench was excavated about 50 m east of the ditch and the
backhoe trenches went from east to west. It was intended to excavate to 3 m below the
ground surface, but when the heavy amount of calcium carbonate was encountered at 171
cm in Zone VI in Backhoe trench (BHT) 1 (Figure 5), it was decided that further
trenching was unnecessary because we had encountered a developed soil zone that no
sites had been found in based upon descriptions of backhoe trenches such as the River
Bend site (Peter 1987:15), the Rough Green site (Skinner et al. 1999:24) which was
found by shovel testing, not trenching, and site 41TR174 (Lintz et al. 2004:A3-A5).
Therefore, Backhoe trenches 2 and 3 were excavated until this soil was encountered.
The most interesting trench was BHT 1 because it contained 7 soil zones while the others
only contained five. However, in cross-section, Zones IV and V appear to pinch out prior
to BHT 2. This may be a result of erosion. A bowl-shaped depression forms the lower
surface (Zone V in BHT 1, Zone IV in BHT 2 and Zone IV in BHT 3). The lowest soil
zone, however, indicates a slight rise in elevation to the south in BHT 3.
During excavation of BHT 3, mussel shells were seen at about 100 cm below the ground
surface. Backhoe trenching was stopped to determine if a site was present. It was and is
described below.

The upland survey
Approximately 270 feet (90 m) of the proposed pipeline route in the uplands (Figure 1)
was pedestrian surveyed. The intended length of the pipeline route was approximately
540 feet (180 m) but construction of residences had disturbed half the survey area. The
vegetation is similar to that along the West Fork except that the trees ranged to 2.5 feet in
diameter and eastern red cedar trees are present as well as prickly pear. The ground
surface consists of a thin layer of forest duff overlying loamy sand in places. The
sandstone bedrock is approximately 2 m below the ground surface. The ground along this
portion of the pipeline route had eroded so badly that small rills ran throughout the area
allowing for good ground exposure as well as good soil profiles. No shovel tests were
excavated due to the good ground visibility (50+ percent) and no cultural materials older
than 50 years were seen on the ground surface or in the soil profiles.

Site 41DL449
Site 41DL449 was found approximately 100 cm below the ground surface at the contact
of Zones III and IV in BHT 3 (Figure 6) which was excavated about 10 m north of the
West Fork. The site consists of approximately 7 mussel shell valves and 2 pieces of what
appeared to be deer bone. The site’s dimensions are about 5 cm (two mussel shells) thick
and 20 cm wide and long (Figure 7). The mussel shells were identified and left in the
field. The bone was collected for radiocarbon dating and sent to Beta Analytic, Inc. The
bone was dated to 910+40 B.P. (A.D. 1000 to 1160). No fire-cracked rock, lithic tools or
debris, burned earth or features were associated with the shells. The shells were unburned
and, based upon a cursory examination of the whole valves, had not been culturally
modified.
To further explore the site, the initial trench was widened and then a trench (BHT 4) was
excavated perpendicular to BHT 3 as shown in Figure 7. The trench was 120 cm deep
and no buried cultural materials were found. Also, another trench (BHT 5) was excavated
about 1.5 m northeast and at about a 45 degree angle from BHT 3 to 120 cm, but no
buried cultural materials were found. Neither BHT 4 nor 5 were profiled, but the soil
matrices are similar to BHT 3 as are the soil zones.
The site may reflect a very short-term occupation. Until the bone was found, it was felt
that the shells may have been collected for fish bait as suggested by Claassen (1986).
Five species were recognized and dominated by the presence of Plectomerus dombeyanus
(Bankclimber). Other species include Amblema plicata (Threeridge), Potamilus
purpuratus (Bluefer), Quadrula mortoni (Southern Mapleleaf) and Lampsils sp. cf L.
hydiana (Louisiana fatmucket). Seven different freshwater mussels are represented. The
small size of the shells indicates a possibly stressed environment or the mussels were
collected from a shallow portion of the river. However, Potamilus purpuratus prefers
deep water and the river may have been shallow when the shells were collected. An
investigation along the bank did not reveal any mussel shells.
Lintz and others (2004:113) encountered two dates for the West Fork at site 41TR174
about 1.4 miles northwest of the study area. Sediment was dated to 1,050+70 B.P. from
55 to 58 cm and shell was dated to 2,000+60 B.P. from between 90 and 100 cm below the
ground surface. The date for the 100 cm level at 41TR174 is about twice as old as date
from site 41DL499. The disparity may be the distance from the West Fork. Site 41DL499
is on the bank of the river whereas site 41TR174 is slightly more than 1,000 feet south of
the river and on an older terrace deposit.

Conclusions
As expected, no archaeological site was found in the upland portion of the survey area,
but as expected, a buried site was found in the West Fork floodplain. The site is deemed
ineligible for nomination to the National Register of Historic Places or as a State
Archeological Landmark site due to absence of diagnostic artifacts and the fact that the
site was excavated away during the trenching process.

RECOMMENDATIONS

Although site 41DL449 was discovered, it is considered ineligible for nomination to the
National Register of Historic Places or as a State Archeological Landmark site due to the
absence of diagnostic artifacts and the fact that it was removed during trenching. No
historic sites were encountered. Based upon our findings, AR Consultants, Inc.
recommends that further cultural resource investigations are unwarranted. Planning and
construction personnel should be advised that buried archaeological materials could be
encountered during construction, and if this should happen, work should cease in that
immediate area and the Archeology Division of the Texas Historical Commission and the
Fort Worth District of the US Army Corps of Engineers be notified.
