ABSTRACT
Dell City Telephone will be replacing fifteen miles of copper lines with
fiber optic cables in Hudspeth, Culberson, and Jeff Davis counties, Texas.
The Texas Historical Commission (THC) reviewed and specified three
areas to be surveyed based on earlier surveys, previous sites recorded, and
where the new lines will be installed in areas of high archaeological
potential. The Area of Potential Effect (APE) was a ten meter wide path
adjacent to the roads. The three surveyed areas were located near Clint,
Plateau, and Kent, Texas. AR Consultants, Inc. conducted a pedestrian
survey of these areas and found evidence of prehistoric occupation near
Clint, has been heavily disturbed. Site 41EP5221 was revisited, as well as
41EP5220 and 41EP5217. South of Plateau three prehistoric sites were
documented. 41CU740 will not be impacted and is newly recorded,
41CU741 will partially be impacted and is also newly recorded, and
41CU449 was a revisit to a previously recorded chert quarry site that will
not be impacted. Shovel tests at 41CU740 and 41CU741 failed to show
any depth to the sites and nothing datable was recovered. All three sites
associated with Plateau were disturbed with only surface scatter and
lacking diagnostics. No cultural material was located on the four ranch
roads surveyed south of Kent. ARC recommends that further
archaeological investigations are unwarranted in conjunction with this
project.

INTRODUCTION
In January 2007, AR Consultants, Inc. (ARC) conducted a pedestrian archaeological
survey of a total of 70 acres of the Dell City Telephone Network. This service area covers
an area of 10,500 square miles in West Texas and Southeastern New Mexico. The
conversion to fiber optic cable is taking place in Hudspeth, Culberson, and Jeff Davis
counties in Texas along with Otero and Eddy counties in New Mexico (Dell Telephone
Cooperative). In addition, a twenty square foot building will be built in the Clint area
near IH-10.in eastern El Paso County. The APE is an area ten meters wide adjacent to the
roads where the new cables will be installed.
Three areas were surveyed in El Paso, Culberson, and Jeff Davis counties near Clint,
Plateau, and Kent, Texas (Figure 1). Clint is located southeast of El Paso on IH-10 at the
FM-1110 exit where the proposed building will be located. The survey area near Plateau
extends thirteen miles south on Plateau Valentine Road which is eighteen miles east of
Van Horn. Here the entire thirteen miles of Plateau Valentine Road needed to
investigated for cultural remains. The area near Kent has ranch roads to the east and west
of CR-118 south of IH-10 that needed to be surveyed for cultural deposits. The survey
was done at the request of N-Com, L.P. of Lubbock, Texas after they received a letter
from the Texas Historical Commission (THC). The concerns of the THC were areas that
had not been surveyed yet, primarily the small ranch roads. (Oaks 2006).
The purpose of the survey was to locate any cultural resources that are present within the
surveyed area and to make recommendations about their significance and if they would
be impacted by construction. This report will be reviewed by the Archeology Division of
the THC as part of their Section 106 review process. The relevant federal legislation
includes the National Historic Preservation Act of 1966, as amended (PL-96-515). The
Texas Antiquities Code is not applicable to this project.
This report has been written in accordance with the report guidelines prepared by the
Council of Texas Archeologists (ND). The following report presents a brief description
of the natural and cultural environment of the surveyed areas. This is followed by the
research design and methodology. The results of the investigation follow and constitute
the body of the report. The last chapter presents recommendations.

NATURAL AND CULTURAL ENVIRONMENT
Natural Environment
To get a better feel for the natural environment of Dell City Telephone’s service area
imagine driving from El Paso to Kent on IH-10 in the Trans-Pecos region of West Texas.
Heading southeast on IH-10 a long stretch of windblown sand can be seen that pinches
off before turning east and crossing the Quitman Mountains towards Sierra Blanca.
Further east the Quaternary alluvium is entered leading into the Salt Basin by Van Horn.
Still further east heading towards Kent the southern most portion of the Apache
Mountains are to the north and the Davis Mountains are to the southeast. Clint (Figure 2)
is just southeast of El Paso on IH-10. Plateau (Figures 3a and 3b) with the Apache
Mountains to the northeast and Davis Mountains to the southeast is in the Salt Basin with
Black Peak. The third section is near Kent (Figure 4) with the Apache Mountains to the
northwest and the Davis Mountains directly east of the ranch roads surveyed. The Lobo
Valley is southwest of Plateau and Kent survey areas, and the Van Horn Mountains are
west of Lobo Valley. Vegetation in all three areas primarily is cacti, mesquite tress,
creosote bush, and grass (Hedrick 1968:1).
The geology of the Clint survey area is a small section northeast and southwest of IH-10
by the FM-1110 intersection. Windblown sand and bolson deposits from the Quaternary
period are found in the area. The bolson deposits are clay, sand, and gravel with some
caliche (Bureau of Economic Geology 1975). The soil within the Clint survey area is
called the Bluepoint Association (USDA 2007). A detailed description was not available;
however in the field it was noted that fine-grain sand was plentiful. Vegetation included
primarily creosote bush, narrow leaf yucca, occasional mesquite, and very little grass.
The geology of Plateau area is described as windblown sand and extends south from the
Salt Flat north of IH-10 in Culberson County. This is next to young Quaternary deposits
of alluvium and lower terraces formed along streams which moved southward in the
valley between the mountain ranges. At the Jeff Davis County line the Victorio Peak
Formation is isolated remnant surrounded by young Quaternary deposits. This formation
is composed of limestone and dolomite that is medium to fine grained. The color is a
brownish-black to medium-gray that weathers to a pale orange. The Victorio Peaks
Formation was originally laid down in the Leonard Phase of the Permian Age. Red Hill is
the southernmost point of the survey (Bureau of Economic Geology 1979). The general
soil begins south of IH-10 and commonly has alkaline to noncalcareous clay loam with 0
to 3 percent slopes. Bedrock is both igneous and limestone based. A gullied land section
lies to the south of the plains has level and sloped land. The southern end rises up again
with a 1 to 5 percent slope with mostly gravelly sandy loam originating from igneous
material. The primary vegetation consists of low grasses and shrubs (Turner 1977).

The geology of the Kent area begins with the Boracho Formation south of IH-10
composed of Levinson and San Martine Limestone in Culberson County off of CR-118.
The composition of Levinson Limestone is limestone, shale, and sandstone with marine
mega-fossils found at greater depths, and San Martine Limestone containing beds with
calcareous shale and mega-fossils. The Boracho Formation was formed in the Lower
Cretaceous. Entering Jeff Davis County, the old and young Quaternary alluvial deposits
dominate the ranch roads in the project area east of CR-118 heading towards the Davis
Mountains. The old Quaternary deposits are composed of Gozar and Bigtank gravels, and
the young Quaternary is the same formation found in the Plateau area (Bureau of
Economic Geology 1979). The soils range from gravelly to clayey loam (Turner 1977).
In the north section of the survey area, hills are common with 1 to 40 percent slopes with
mainly gravelly loams underlain by limestone bedrock or cobbles. Moving south the
plains become more common with noncalcareous clay loamy soils which are underlain
with limestone. In the southern-most section of the survey area, the Davis Mountains pick
up again with noncalcareous well drained stony soils underlain by igneous bedrock with
20 to 45 percent slopes. The main vegetation supported by the soils here are low grasses
and shrubs.
Cultural History
A brief review the Trans-Pecos Region culture history is presented below. More
information is compiled in other sources, particularly those prepared in conjunction with
investigations at Fort Bliss and Geo-Marine, Inc. (Ward 2006:3-1 to 3-11). The
chronological time frame is shown below beginning with the Paleo-Indian Period and
ending with the Historic period.

Chronological Framework
Historic
Protohistoric
Formative

A.D. 1540 to present

A.D. 200/900 to 1400
6,000 B.C. to 200/900 A.D.
10,000 to 6,000 B.C.

The Paleo-Indian period is associated with the distinctive Paleo-Indian Folsom and
Clovis spear point types found in El Paso County (Meltzer and Bever 1995:Table 1). In
Culberson County the Baylor Mountains near Van Horn a Folsom site was located along
with other Paleo-Indian materials (Lindsay 1969). It is thought that the Paleo-Indians
were migratory in the Trans-Pecos region since no habitation structures have been found.
This group is associated with big game hunting with Folsom points found with bison.
Clovis points were found with mammoth bones in West Texas and New Mexico.

In the Archaic period, hunting and gathering was still the primary food source, but there
was a shift toward more dependence on plant foods and smaller game. This was probably
due to the megafauna becoming extinct due to climatic changes. In the Trans-Pecos
region evidence shows that succulents such as sotol and lechuguilla were processed
(Ward 2006:3-7). Site types and locations consist of rock shelters, caves, burned rock
loci, lithic scatters and isolated hearths.
During the Formative period the cultivation of beans, squash and maize occurred. The
Formative period is divided into two stages: the earlier pithouse village and later pueblo
stage (Simmons, Dykeman, and Hicks 1989: 95-96). Arrow points and pottery make their
appearance in this period. Pottery styles range from plainware to polychrome painted
vessels, and imported ceramics are found on sites in the area. Pithouses can be found in
the Western Trans-Pecos which is dated the entire period. Circular ones are more
common after A.D. 1000 (Ward 2006 3-10). At approximately A.D. 1400, the area
appears to have been abandoned, evidence points to a probable shift in subsistence
strategies to try to counteract the change to a dryer environment.
The Protohistoric period was the transition between the Formative and Historic Period.
The lack of radiocarbon dates during this period shows an abandonment of the villages in
the western Trans-Pecos region. This was probably due to the specialized agricultural
practices and climate changes (Miller and Kenmotsu 2004: 258).
The Historic period is divided into three phases to distinguish cultural influences in the El
Paso area. The Spanish phase ranges from A.D. 1540 to 1821. The Mexican Phase ranges
from 1821-1846, and finally the Anglo phase from 1841- today. More detailed
information of these three phases can be found in the The Handbook of Texas Online El
Paso, Texas (Timmons 2007). In the Trans-Pecos region the historic period began in
1535 when the first Europeans stumbled upon the Native Americans. The area was
sparsely populated until after 1846 at the start of the Anglo phase (Ward 2006 3-11).

Previous Investigations
Prior to fieldwork, the Texas Archeological Sites Atlas online (TASA) was checked for
previous archaeological surveys in or near the areas of the survey. TX Dot has surveyed
the main roads leaving only the smaller, less traveled ones still needing to be surveyed.
Nearly all of the sites are prehistoric and are listed by the survey sections.
In the Clint section of the survey the only previous studies were the recording of site
41EP5217, 41EP5220, and 41EP5221 that were revisited in order to relocate. TASA does
not have any site forms for the sites, but El Paso Brownware was discovered at
41EP5221. Survey work at Milehigh between El Paso and Van Horn by Skinner, Steed
and Bearden (1973) recorded 117 sites including numerous rock shelters, stone-lined
hearths, historic glass, chipping sites, prehistoric ceramics, lithic scatters, and fireAR CONSULTANTS, INC.

cracked rock. Kimball Banks (1973) conducted a survey of the Three Mile and Sulphur
Draw Watersheds finding eleven sites and several artifact locations. Four of these sites
were chosen for further investigation where bifaces, projectile points, ceramics, manos,
hammerstones, and retouched flakes were discovered.
The Plateau section was extensively surveyed by the late John A. Hedrick (1968, 1975,
1989) He recorded 23 base camps, 59 camp sites, 18 rock shelters, 8 quarries, 5 ring
middens, 2 rock circles, 2 rock art sites, 5 lithic scatters, 3 isolated hearths, a cairn, and
an isolated find. A total of 127 sites were located of which 16 had previously been
recorded. A large quarry site near Black Peak, 41CU449, with large quantities of purpletan chert was recorded by Hedrick. Working in the Salt Basin region near Plateau in a
roughly 24 square mile area finding surface sites that he described as large open
campsites and small isolated campsites. Artifacts located included flint cores, flakes,
scrapers, manos, metates, and arrow points. All of the sites listed above were prehistoric.
Other groups have done surveys and excavations in the Plateau section as well. The Blue
Origin Launch Facility Project by Christine Ward (2006) in Culberson County north of
Van Horn was a prehistoric site, 41CU696, studied by Geo-Marine, Inc. The site was
located on an alluvial fan. Artifacts included chipped stone, faunal bone, and ceramics.
The University of Colorado (Lindsay 1969) excavated the Chispa Creek site near Van
Horn in 1967. Clovis period material to recent pottery were located, including several
Folsom points that were found in place. Almost 100 Folsom points were discovered
there. The ElCOR Burial Cave (Skinner, Haas, and Wilson 1980:25-87) north of the
plateau region in the Gypsum plain was an unusual find with seven very thick human
skulls.

RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODOLOGY
The research design for the intensive pedestrian survey took into consideration previous
investigations in the region that showed a similar natural environment. It was expected
that prehistoric occupation would be found in the form of lithic or lithic scatters, isolated
or multiple rock-filled hearths, burned rock middens, and possibly ceramics. Historic
occupation would be much less common; however house structures, brick-lined cisterns,
bottles, glass, and modern ceramics would be plausible.
Based on known sites in and around the study area it is proposed that
prehistoric occupation in the region was on a seasonal basis and sites were
used for specific or limited maintenance activities. Current evidence
shows that permanent occupation was not demonstrated. There is
sufficient evidence to conclude that historical occupation was long term
but widely scattered.
In order to test these hypotheses, it was necessary to do the following:
1.

2.

3.
4.

Systematically survey the route of the fiber optic cable looking for hearths,
cairns, burned rock middens, or lithic scatters in a ten meter wide strip
adjacent to the road.
Record any evidence of prehistoric or historic occupation as sites or
isolated occurrences [IOs] following the guidelines described by Stuart
and Miller (1991:9)
Map site arrangements on site survey forms or on graph paper if a more
detailed map was warranted by the site arrangements/artifact scatter.
Photograph each site.

Limited shovel tests were placed at the sites within the survey area for the purpose of
determining the boundaries and depth of the two sites. This would also try to determine
the age by finding datable materials and the means to recreate the site.

RESULTS
This section is arranged by describing the condition, ground surface coverage, sites
located, shovel tests associated with sites, and the vegetation for the three survey areas.
Starting with Clint southeast of El Paso on IH-10, then continuing east towards Plateau,
and finally further east towards Kent.
The area near Clint is where Dell City Telephone plans to build a twenty square foot
switching station is now highly disturbed, and destroyed in some places, by the
construction of IH-10. Erosion has occurred in much of the area as well with large ditches
that have trash in them. An ariel photo of the area shows IH-10 and the surrounding
development (Figure 5). Ground coverage was good at about 75 percent, but very little
could be found. Three sites were previously plotted (41EP5221, 41EP5220, and
41EP5217); however no site forms could be located on TASA online. Site 41EP5221
(Figure 6) east of IH-10 was highly disturbed and eroded with ground visibility at 75
percent. Artifacts consist of five El Paso Brown ceramic sherds, and a mano, metate, and
FCR. The ceramic sherds were found on a sand dune running parallel with Roberts Ranch
Road that leads to a land fill entrance. The mano appeared to be out of context, on top of
sand dune, as if someone had simply dropped it there. No shovel tests were done at this
location. Vegetation included primarily creosote bush, narrow leaf yucca, and
occasionally a mesquite tree.
Site 41EP5220 (Figure 7) was plotted south of IH-10 and is highly disturbed and eroded,
if not destroyed, with water pipes, a large drainage system, cables, pipelines, and trash. A
mobile home park and Exxon station with truck parking is next to the area. Ground
coverage was good at 75 percent visible, but no evidence could be found to confirm the
plotted site. The site was probably destroyed because of its close proximity to IH-10.
Vegetation included creosote bush, and narrow leaf yucca.
West from IH-10 is the previously plotted site of 41EP5217, and the destruction here is
more intensive than at 41EP5220. Roads cut through the site location as well as large
water pipes, an asphalt fill area, and a construction material platform. Ground visibility is
still at 75 percent, but no cultural remains could be located. The site was probably
destroyed because of its close proximity to IH-10. Creosote bush is the primary
vegetation with narrow leaf yucca also present.
The Plateau area is mildly disturbed due to natural erosion taking place. Ground visibility
ranges from 50 to 75 percent depending on how thick the vegetation is. The proposed
thirteen mile route for the fiber optic cable is marked in red (Figure 3a and 3b) and
resides in a wide valley between the Davis and Van Horn Mountains in the Salt Basin
(Bureau of Economic Geology 1979). The route starts in Culberson County and ends in
Jeff Davis County. Archaeological potential is higher in the northern portion of the
survey area where 41CU740, 41CU741 were recorded, and 41CU449 was revisited. The
archaeological potential drops off considerably after the revisited site to almost nothing
all the way to the end of the survey area at Red Hill. Vegetation was consistent for the

41CU740 is an isolated single fire-cracked rock hearth (Hedrick 1968) just east of
Plateau Valentine Road. It was readily located due to excellent ground visibility at 75
percent due to the lack of vegetation. Artifacts present included a less than ten lithic
debris scatter, mainly primary interior flakes, several core fragments, and half of a onehanded mano. Shovel tests were conducted in order to determine the boundaries of the
site and showed that the first 30 - 35 cmbs of Shovel Tests 1-5 are a brown sandy loam
(7.5YR4/3) followed by gravel caliche that were negative. Shovel test 6 showed 0–45
cmbs as disturbed with no artifacts found. There is no evidence of any depth to the site,
and nothing datable was found. The site is outside the APE and is mapped in Figure 8.

41CU741 (Figure 9) is a multiple hearth site with very few associated lithics. The site is
100 meters south of 41CU470 on the western sloping upland part of Black Peak hill east
of Plateau Valentine Road. There are four rock concentrations here with two that are in
the APE. The largest of the rock concentrations is seven by two meters and the smallest is
one by one meters. Both of these rock concentrations are in the APE and will be
destroyed. The remaining two angle up towards the northeast and are five by one meters
and one by one meters. Lithics are present but the low artifact density suggests this was
short term camp in size. All four are on the surface and have been heavily disturbed. The
six shovel tests were all negative and showed (0 to 50 cmbs) a brown sandy loam

Hedrick’s previously recorded Purple-Tan Chert Quarry, 41CU449, is roughly 700
meters south of 41CU741 also on the east side of Plateau Valentine Road (Figure 11).
Although well out of the APE, it was examined to find the source of the lithic material.
Evidence of matrix removal, testing, and trimming chert was found (Hedrick 1988:135).
Hill A is the closest to the road and the smallest on the east side of the road. Hill B
(Figure 12) is the tallest and almost directly east of hill A. Walking up the east slope of
the Hill B thousands of purple-tan, and brown lithic material could be seen, but at the top
only limestone was present. Heading down the hill in a northwest direction the limestone
source for the purple-tan chert could be seen, however the lithic flakes dropped to almost
nothing. Hill C (Figure 13) is southwest of Hill B and is very similar with the exception
that there is lithic material on its hilltop. It appears that the source of the lithic material
has eroded away from the top of Hill B but not yet from C. Therefore the hilltops are the
probable source for the lithic material at the site, which has eroded away over time. The
valley between hill A and B showed a lesser amount of material to almost nothing
cultural at all.

The Kent area (Figure 4) sections of the proposed cable routing resides in the valleys of
the Davis Mountains. Large boulders and various other rocks with very little soil is the
predominate terrain cover for the region. The ground visibility was good at 75 percent
due to the lack of vegetation in many parts. No cultural remains were located in these
surveyed areas, and no shovel tests were done. This was determined by walking ranch
roads to an unmarked ranch to the east and west towards the Rancho del Cielo Ranch off
of CR-118 south. Further south on the east side another short section was surveyed to a
ranch house where a rancher confirmed that the valley fill was mostly rock. Traveling
further south, the last section surveyed led to a locked gate on the east side of the road
for the Reynolds Cattle Company JN Ranch. The terrain looked the same as the previous
sections. The predominant vegetation is creosote bush with some mesquite trees present
for all four sections surveyed.
Conclusions
In the survey area near Clint, two of the three previously plotted sites, 41EP5220 and
41EP5217, were not relocated and were probably destroyed during or after the
construction of IH-10. Site 41EP5221 showed signs of cultural material, but it is located
in a disturbed and eroded setting with no evidence of a buried cultural deposit. The
absence of site forms at TASA online made relocating the sites much harder. Because of
the shallow soil and extensive disturbances, all three sites are considered destroyed.
The Plateau survey area yielded two newly recorded prehistoric sites, 41CU740 and
41CU741, and Hedrick’s previously recorded Purple/Tan Chert Quarry 41CU449. All
three sites are located at the north end of the survey area.. Sites 41CU740 and 41CU741
are hearth sites that are deflated and eroded with a very dispersed lithic scatter
associated. They are open camps and may have been staging points before or after
collecting lithics at the nearby quarry.
The survey area near Kent yielded no cultural remains. The four sections surveyed are
all private ranch roads with very rocky terrain with boulders and rocks from the Davis
Mountains.

RECOMMENDATIONS
The building location in the Clint area has the three previously reported sites. Two of
these appear to have been destroyed now and the third is badly eroded and is disturbed,
therefore ARC does not recommend any further archaeological investigation. Replacing
the old copper cable with fiber optics adjacent to the existing roadways in the Plateau
area could impact the area around site 41CU449. Only one of the two recorded sites near
Plateau is partly in the APE, but being a surface site with no depth or datable material no
further investigation is warranted. No cultural material was discovered near Kent on any
of the four sections for the proposed cable routing, thus not warranting any further
archaeological study. All the sites to be impacted are ineligible for NRHP. It is AR
Consultants, Inc. recommendation that no further archaeological investigations are
warranted. If during burial of the new cable or construction of the building cultural
material is discovered work should cease immediately until it can be investigated further.
