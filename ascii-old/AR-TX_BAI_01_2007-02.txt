In November 2006 archeologists from Blanton & Associates, Inc., conducted an intensive archeological
survey along of approximately six miles of FM 1235 between US 277 in View, Texas, and FM 89 in the
City of Buffalo Gap, Taylor County, Texas, prior to proposed roadway widening and culvert replacement
construction (CSJ: 0633-04-011). The survey was performed at the request of Kimley-Horn and
Associates, Inc., on behalf of the Texas Department of Transportation’s Abilene District. The survey
discovered two archeological sites (41TA275 and 41TA276) within the Area of Potential Effect for
archeology. No artifacts were collected so curation was unnecessary.

INTRODUCTION
In November 2006, archeologists from Blanton & Associates, Inc. (Blanton & Associates), at the request
of Kimley-Horn and Associates, Inc. (KHA) on behalf of the Texas Department of Transportation’s
(TxDOT) Abilene District, conducted an intensive archeological survey along approximately six miles of
FM 1235 between Buffalo Gap and View in Taylor County, Texas prior to proposed roadway widening
and culvert replacement. The planned construction would extend from the US 277/FM 1235 intersection
in View, Texas to the FM 1235/FM 89 intersection on the north side of Buffalo Gap, Texas (Figure 1).
TxDOT proposes to resurface the roadway, add paved shoulders, and extend 20 existing culverts within
the existing FM 1235 right-of-way (ROW). The existing ROW is 100 feet wide with a 24-foot wide
roadway containing two 10-foot wide lanes and two 2-foot wide shoulders (Figure 2). Proposed
improvements would create a 30-foot wide roadway with two 11-foot wide lanes and two 4-foot wide
paved shoulders. Current schematics indicate that no temporary or permanent easements are planned. The
estimated depth of vertical construction impacts along the highway is 3 to 4 feet.
Because of the roadway widening 20 culverts would be extended, including a bridge-class culvert to
replace the existing culverts at Elm Creek. Two structures will be required at Elm Creek, both of which
will be approximately 60 feet long, 10 feet wide, and nine feet tall. The estimated maximum depth of
vertical impact of the bridge-class culvert is 10 to 12 feet below ground surface. The overall Area of
Potential Effect (APE) for this project is therefore 31,171 feet long, 100 feet wide, and 72 acres in size.
As the planned construction would occur on property owned by the state, the project is subject to the
provisions of the Antiquities Code of Texas, now subsumed in Title 13, Part II of the Texas
Administrative Code. This legislation defines the necessary conditions for recognition and preservation of
State Archeological Landmarks (SALs) and requires that any political subdivision of the State of Texas,
defined as a “local governmental entity created and operating under the laws of this state, including a city,
county, school district, or special district created under the Texas Constitution, Article III, §52(b)(1) or
(2), or Article XVI, §59” in 13 TAC §26.5 of the code, must identify potential SALs through survey of
public lands prior to actions that could potentially damage those SALs.
It is assumed that funding for the proposed highway construction will come in part from the Federal
Highway Administration (FHWA) and, as such, the proposed construction project is also subject to the
provisions of Section 106 of the National Historic Preservation Act of 1966 (NHPA). The intent of the
NHPA is to protect significant cultural resources that might be threatened by actions that are federally
funded or permitted, or which occur on federal property. The act, which created the National Register of
Historic Places (NRHP) and the Advisory Council for Historic Preservation (ACHP), states that the
ACHP must be afforded the chance to comment when any cultural resources eligible for inclusion on the
NRHP are present in an area affected by federal agency actions or actions funded or permitted by federal
agencies.
The federal regulatory process is described in detail in the ACHP regulations (36 CFR 800) and in the
regulations of the agencies and federal divisions engaged in historic preservation. Protection of cultural
resources under federal law is tied to eligibility for the NRHP that depends on site significance as defined
by National Park Service (NPS) rules 36 CFR 60. Although the ACHP is the final arbiter of the Section
106 process, in practice, the process is typically limited to review and concurrence by the involved agency
and the State Historic Preservation Officer (SHPO), represented in Texas by the THC.

Investigations were conducted in accordance with the First Amended Programmatic Agreement (PA)
among the FHWA, the THC, the ACHP, and TxDOT, as well as the Memorandum of Understanding
(MOU) among TxDOT and THC. The survey was designed to comply with appropriate archeological
survey methods as defined in the Department of the Interior's Standards and Guidelines (NPS 1983), the
Guidelines of the Council of Texas Archeologists (1987), and the survey standards developed by the THC
in conjunction with the Council of Texas Archeologists (THC n.d.). The primary intent of the survey was
to identify and describe all cultural resources discovered within the APE, evaluate their potential
eligibility for nomination to the NRHP or for formal SAL designation, and should significant cultural
resources be located, make recommendations for future cultural resource management options such as
avoidance, preservation, or further investigations.

ENVIRONMENTAL SETTING
The proposed project area is located in the central part of Taylor County on the north side of the Callahan
Divide. The Callahan Divide is an erosional remnant of a once vast cover of Cretaceous rocks and
represents a northern outlier of the Cretaceous limestone that comprises the Edwards Plateau of central
Texas (Spearing 1991:215). The Callahan Divide separates the Brazos and Colorado River basins and sits
prominently above the surrounding plains. The project area along FM 1235 roughly parallels the base of
the divide’s north face as it traverses portions of the Rolling Plains ecological region of Texas, which is
characterized by a gently undulating to rolling dissected plain. Elevations across the Rolling Plains range
from approximately 1,000 feet in the eastern margins of the region to 2,200 feet at the base of the Cap
Rock Escarpment on the region’s western edges (Jordan et al. 1984). The project area crosses Elm Creek
on the northwest edge of Buffalo Gap, Tippett Creek southeast of View, and a number of unnamed
tributary drainages and swales between the two communities.
GEOLOGY
The project area is primarily underlain by the Permian-age Clear Fork Group that consists of mudstone,
limestone, dolomite, and siltstone. Small amounts of recent (Holocene) Alluvium and Pleistocene
fluviatile terrace deposits are located along the two largest drainages in the project area. The fluviatile
deposits consist of undivided gravel, sand, and silt separated into low and high terrace deposits along the
Clear Fork of Brazos River and Elm Creek. Quaternary alluvium consists of floodplain and low terrace
deposits. A sliver of fluviatile terrace deposits that make up the second terrace east of Elm Creek is
located at the FM 1235/FM 89 intersection. The east and west banks of Elm Creek within the project area
are recent alluvium, as is the Tippet Creek crossing southeast of View (Barnes 1974). In terms of the
potential for archeological preservation, recent alluvium along local and regional drainages has been
shown to contain buried cultural deposits.
SOILS
Soils in the study area belong to the Sagerton-Rowena-Rotan association, which consists of deep
calcareous to noncalcareous friable clayey upland soils exhibiting alternating strata of clay and clay loam.
The four primary soils mapped along FM 1235 include, Vernon clay, 3 to 12 percent slopes; Sagerton
clay loam, 1 to 3 percent slopes; Tillman clay loam, 1 to 3 percent slopes; and Weymouth clay loam, 1 to
3 percent slopes. Vernon clay, 3 to 12 percent slopes, is red to weak red clay found on uplands, developed
in place from clayey shale, and extends to about 60 inches below ground surface to its contact with the
underlying redbed clay shale. Sagerton clay loam, 1 to 3 percent slopes, is dark reddish brown to red,
formed in calcareous loamy sediment on uplands, and consists of firm clay loam with calcium carbonate
extending to a depth of 80 inches or more below ground surface. Calcium carbonate content gradually
increases with depth to the extent that the deepest horizon (B3ca) is 40 to 50 percent calcium carbonate
(Conner 1976).
The Tillman soil series consists of clayey upland soils that developed in situ from calcareous clayey shale.
Tillman clay loam, 1 to 3 percent slopes, consists of seven to 10 inches of hard to very hard reddishbrown clay loam overlying extremely hard reddish-brown to red clay from 10 to 70 inches below ground
surface. Weymouth clay loam, 1 to 3 percent slopes, is an upland soil that developed in place from
calcareous loamy sediments over clayey shale. A representative profile exhibits about 24 inches (0 to
24 inches below ground surface) of hard reddish-brown clay loam (Ap, B21, and B22ca horizons) over

ARCHEOLOGICAL SURVEY ON FM 1235 BETWEEN BUFFALO GAP AND VIEW, TAYLOR COUNTY

hard yellowish-red clay loam that is 20 to 25 percent calcium carbonate. The calcium carbonate content of
this soil increases dramatically in the B22ca horizon, accounting for 20 percent of the matrix. The IIC
horizon (24 to 36 inches below ground surface) is weak red clayey shale.
Along Elm Creek and Tippett Creek are Colorado soils, frequently flooded, that are found on bottom
lands and formed in calcareous alluvial sediment. This soil consists of six inches (0 to six inches below
ground surface) of hard light brown loam overlying hard reddish-brown platy loam to a depth of 60
inches (Conner 1976). The lack of substantial deposits of recent alluvium along drainages in the project
area, coupled with the nature of the upland soils in the APE, indicates that the potential for buried, intact
cultural remains in the project area is low.
VEGETATION
Taylor County lies in the Kansan biotic province where native vegetation consists of a mixed-grass plain
dominated by little bluestem (Schizachyrium scoparium), big bluestem (Andropogon gerardii) and
western wheatgrass (Agropyron smithii) (Blair 1950). Vegetation within and adjacent to the project area
consists of maintained highway ROW and Mesquite-Lotebush Shrub (Prosopis glandulosa-Ziziphus
obtusifolia) type (McMahan et al. 1984). Adjacent land use includes rural undeveloped range, agricultural
land, scattered rural residences, and the partially developed outskirts of Buffalo Gap and View.

CULTURE HISTORY
The project area is located in the southeastern extent of the Southern Plains and the southwestern edge of
the Rolling Plains. This area lacks the cultural syntheses that other regions of Texas have. The most
exhaustive, long term archeological studies in the area were conducted to the north at Lubbock Lake
(Johnson and Holliday 1995) and at Justiceburg Reservoir, now Lake Allan Henry (Boyd et al. 1989,
1990, 1992, 1993, and 1994; Boyd 1997). Five broad periods typically define the prehistoric cultural
history of the project area. They include the Paleoindian, Archaic, Ceramic, and Protohistoric periods
(Johnson and Holliday 1995). Earlier chronologies incorporate the Ceramic and Protohistoric into a single
Late Prehistoric period (Suhm et al. 1954). As only prehistoric cultural resources were identified during
this survey, this background is limited to a general overview of regional prehistory.
PALEOINDIAN PERIOD
The earliest well-documented evidence of human occupation in the region appears in the Paleoindian
period during the Late Pleistocene around 9,500 B.C. at the Blackwater Draw, Miami, and Lubbock Lake
sites (Johnson and Holliday 1995:552). During the Late Pleistocene the environment was humid with
mild winters and summers and the mean temperature was lower than it is today (Johnson 1986).
Grasslands covered much of the plains, and many small streams crossed the countryside (Johnson and
Holliday 1995:552).
Megafauna such as mammoth, Bison antiquus, camel, giant turtle, horse, short-faced bear, giant beaver,
and peccary inhabited this landscape (Hester 1972). The common view is that paleoindians were nomadic
hunter-gathers who followed large game and lacked many semi-permanent or permanent structures
(Johnson and Holliday 1995), but recent evidence suggests that a more diversified and complex lifeway
may have existed. The tool kit from this time included large, intricately worked, fluted, lanceolate stone
points that were probably hafted on a spear-like weapon. These points include Clovis, Folsom, Midland,
Plainview, and Firstview styles.
ARCHAIC PERIOD
As the cooler and wetter climates of the Late Pleistocene gave way to the warmer and drier Holocene,
there were marked changes in fauna and flora of the region. The large mammals vanished from the
landscape, possibly aided by overhunting. In the midst of this dramatic environmental shift, a range of
cultural changes mark the beginning of the long Archaic period (6,500 B.C. to 700–900 A.D.). With the
majority of the large mammals gone and the environment drier, Southern Plains cultures became more
sedentary and dependent on B. bison, which had replaced the larger B. antiquus, and smaller game such as
deer and rabbit. While lanceolate projectile point forms remained in use during the Early Archaic,
stemmed dart points began to proliferate and eventually replace the lanceolate forms altogether. The dart
points were better suited to the lightweight shafts propelled by the atlatl, and the entire toolkit was better
adapted to small game. Ground-stone artifacts found at sites of this age may be indicative of a more
generalized diet containing more plant material.
Population grew during the Archaic despite the changing climates and resource base. Boyd et al.
(1989:44) discuss a number of climatic “shifts” during the Archaic that are marked primarily by drier
episodes. Each shift indicates a potential change in priorities between plant and animal resources. Shift 1
(6,500 B.C. to 4,400 B.C.) roughly corresponds with the Early Archaic of the Central Texas chronologies.

Bison were the most important food and plants less important. Shift 2 (4,400 B.C. to 3,500 B.C.)
correlates with the Hypsithermal, or Drought 1. The Hypsithermal was a global phenomenon during
which warmer, drier conditions and prolonged, severe droughts affected much of North America. During
this time, the parched grasslands and warmer temperatures of the Southern Plains became less attractive
to bison (Johnson and Holliday 1995:526). Bison herds traveled south into the area less frequently, and
people became more dependent on plant resources (Dillehay 1974). Water became critical during the
prolonged droughts of the Hypsithermal. At the Mustang Springs Site, seven wells that date to this time
were documented by Meltzer (1991). Shift 3 (3,500 to 3,000 B.C.) marked a return to more mesic
conditions. Bison returned to the area in greater numbers and once again became an important food
resource.
Between 3,000 B.C and 2,500 B.C, Johnson and Holliday (1995:526) postulate another prolonged hot and
dry period (their Shift 4 or Drought 2) that was less severe than the earlier Hypsithermal. As bison ranged
the cooler northern plains, plant resources again became a dietary staple. Shifts 2, 3, and 4 overlap with
Middle Archaic (ca. 3,500 B.C. to 1,100 B.C) dates from adjacent cultural chronologies. The final climate
shift (Shift 5) occurred between 2,500 and 1,000 B.C. and is once again identified with a reliance on bison
as the primary diet. Shift 5 overlaps with the beginning of the Late Archaic (ca. 1,100 B.C to 600–
700 A.D.), during which time the climate stabilized and conditions developed that have remained to the
modern era (Johnson and Holliday 1995:528).
CERAMIC AND PROTOHISTORIC PERIODS
The Ceramic Period (ca. 600–700 A.D. to 1540 A.D.) is denoted by the appearance of two technologies
important to the area: ceramics and the bow and arrow. Arrow points, dart points, and coarse-tempered
cord-marked ceramics were found associated with each other at Deadman’s Shelter. This seems to
indicate that there was a transition between technologies rather than an abrupt switch (Hughes and Wiley
1978). Diagnostic materials for the period are corner-notched Scallorn points and ceramic trade items
from the Mogollon and Puebloan cultures (Perttula et al. 1995).
The Protohistoric period (1540 A.D. to 1750 A.D.) was defined by Johnson and Holliday (1995:530) as
the presence of Europeans in the New World but the apparent lack of European items in the archeological
record. The typical arrow point associated with this time period is the triangular, often serrated Garza
point (Turner and Hester 1999:215). Very little is known about this period, but Hickerson (1994:24)
believes that the area was populated by the Jumano Indians by the time of the Coronado expedition. By
the early 1700s, the Jumanos were eradicated by disease and the Apache, whom they had been battling
with for decades or more (Hickerson 1994). Later the Apache were supplanted by the Comanche, who
controlled the area until the 1870s (Lowry et al. 2002:5).
HISTORIC PERIOD
The following offers only a brief overview of the general history of the project area. Detailed histories of
the area can be found in Landers’ (1929) A Short History of Taylor County and Zachry’s (1980) A History
of Rural Taylor County. Taylor County was established in 1858 and named for Alamo defenders Edward,
James, and George Taylor. Taylor County was attached to Travis and Bexar counties for administrative
purposes until 1873. Partly due to the presence of the Comanche, the area remained virtually unsettled
until the 1870s when the Comanches were displaced by the U.S. Army (Handbook of Texas Online
2006).

The earliest Anglo-European settlers to arrive in Taylor County were buffalo hunters during the 1870s.
The county was finally organized in 1878, with the settlement of Buffalo Gap chosen as the seat of
government. Settlement accelerated when the Texas and Pacific Railway was established in the area
during the early 1880s. The railroad bypased Buffalo Gap, opting instead to construct a route further north
through what would become Abilene, Texas. As Abilene developed into a shipping center, the community
of Buffalo Gap declined in population. In 1883, Abilene became the county seat (Handbook of Texas
Online 2006).
Despite the semi-arid climate and dissected plains of the area, crop farming became an early leading
industry in Taylor County. Early crops included corn, wheat, and cotton. The early farmers and ranchers
of the area came into conflict with one another in the 1880s over competition for open range versus
fenced crop land. By the early 1900s, cotton was the primary cash crop in Taylor County, with the
ranching industry steadily declining. Oil was first discovered in the county in 1929 but was not a
significant part of the economy until the 1940s. By the 1980s, the petroleum industry had shrunk
dramatically. Since the 1980s, crop farming, ranching, industrial manufacturing, and Dyess Air Force
Base in Abilene comprise the bulk of Taylor County’s economy (Handbook of Texas Online 2006).
Predating the establishment of Taylor County by one year, Buffalo Gap was founded at a natural gap in
the Callahan Divide in 1857. The earliest history of Taylor County centers around Buffalo Gap where
1860s and 1870s buffalo hunters made winter camps to exploit the buffalo herds. Elm Creek, which is
crossed by FM 1235 in the current project area just north of Buffalo Gap, flows southwest to northeast
across Taylor County and through Buffalo Gap. The creek once served as vital watering hole for the herds
of buffalo that traveled annually through the gap in the Callahan Divide between the southern and
northern Texas plains. FM 89, which runs through Buffalo Gap, follows the Center Line Trail that was
surveyed in 1874 and ran from Texarkana to El Paso. Between 1925 and 1980, the population of Buffalo
Gap fluctuated between 250 and 400. By 1990, the town had 409 residents and six businesses (Handbook
of Texas Online 2006).
Although a minor earlier settlement had developed at the eventual town site, View was not formally
registered as a town until the Coleman Cutoff of the Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railway system came
through, bypassing Abilene, in 1909–1910. View took its name from its location atop a hill overlooking
scenic farmland on the bottomlands below. The railroad depot became the first official building in the
town. The railroad station in View likely contributed to the 1940 establishment of Camp Barkeley
between View and Abilene (Handbook of Texas Online 2006).
Camp Barkeley was designed in 1940 as a temporary camp for infantry and supply troops. However,
during World War II the installation became a training facility and one of Texas’ largest military
installations before it was deactiviated in 1945. The camp also served as a Prisoner of War camp for
German prisoners of war. At its peak in 1945, the POW camp housed 840 prisoners. The installation is
now the Texas Army National Guard’s El Campo Armory.

PREVIOUS ARCHEOLOGICAL INVESTIGATIONS
Prior to field investigations, a background records and literature review of site and project files was
conducted at the Texas Archeological Research Laboratory (TARL), the THC, and on the THC’s online
Texas Archeological Sites Atlas (TASA) to provide information on the potential for archeological site
occurrence/density throughout the project area. That review found that there are several previously
investigated project areas and previously recorded archeological sites within a 1,000-meter radius of the
project area.
During the late 1920s and early 1930s, E. B. Sayles (1935) conducted extensive surveys throughout the
Taylor County area during his archeological assessment of Texas. Near Buffalo Gap, just north of the FM
1235/CR 257 intersection and northeast of FM 1235 is site 41TA69, a probable five-acre prehistoric open
camp with hearths and a low density surface scatter of artifacts recorded by Sayles in 1928 (TASA). On
the opposite end of the project area, about 800 meters northwest of the FM 1235/US 277 intersection in
View, Texas, Sayles recorded a moderately-sized prehistoric open camp adjacent to the head of Little Elm
Creek. The site was reported to have had a large number of hearth features but, as with 41TA69, few
artifacts. The cultural deposits extended about 10 to 15 centimeters below ground surface (TASA).
In 1994, an archeological reconnaissance and survey were conducted on the grounds of the El Campo
Armory, which is located approximately three kilometers southeast of View, Texas on FM 1235. A series
of four small prehistoric lithic scatters with surface and shallowly (0 to 10 centimeters) buried materials
was recorded during the investigations (Wormser et al. 1994). All of the sites were highly disturbed and
contained modern military debris (i.e., M-16 cartridges and clay pigeon fragments) and trash. None of the
sites were recommended as eligible for the NRHP or for formal SAL designation.
Roughly 500 meters south-southwest of the clustered lithic scatters documented by Wormser et al. (1994)
is site 41TA229, a large (about 673 meters N/S by 400 meters E/W) site located on an upland ridge
overlooking FM 1235. Unfortunately, the THC’s online Texas Archeological Site Atlas provides no
additional data, but based on the size and location of the site, it is likely prehistoric (TASA).
During an archeological reconnaissance of three Permanent School Fund tracts immediately east of the El
Campo Armory, Carpenter (2001) recorded two prehistoric sites; one undifferentiated Archaic lithic
scatter (41TA237) with 0 to 5 centimeters of buried materials and one open camp (41TA238) with burned
rock features and a lithic scatter with up to 10 centimeters of buried deposits. Neither site was
recommended for designation as a SAL.
In Buffalo Gap and within 400 to 800 meters of the FM 1235/FM 89 intersection are five historical
markers, one structure recorded during a Neighborhood Survey, and a single National Register property.
About 500 meters west-southwest of the intersection are historical markers commemorating the Ernie
Wilson Museum (THC Marker No. 1476) and first Taylor County Jail and Courthouse (THC Marker
No. 1597). Three additional historical markers are located 800 meters south-southwest of the intersection
and commemorate; 1) the Buffalo Gap College (THC Marker No. 560) that was founded in 1885, 2) the
settlement of Buffalo Gap (THC Marker No. 5523) in the 1870s, and 3) an 1863 battle between
Comanches and a Texas ranger detachment under Lt. T. C. Wright that occurred about one mile east of
Buffalo Gap (THC Marker No. 5647).

Six hundred meters south of the FM 1235/FM 89 intersection on the corner of William Street and Elm
Street is the Kleberg Bank that was recorded during a local Neighborhood Survey. The nearby NRHPlisted property is the Old Taylor County Courthouse and Jail (Reference No. 78002984) that was built in
1879–1880 on William Street between North and Elm Streets.

METHODS
The intensive archeological survey on FM 1235 involved surface and subsurface investigations of
sufficient intensity to determine the nature, extent, and if possible, the significance of any discovered
cultural resources. Investigations adhered to THC survey standards (n.d.), as well as the guidelines of the
Council of Texas Archeologists (1987), and the Secretary of the Interior’s Standards and Guidelines (NPS
1983). Moreover, the survey was designed and executed in accordance with the PA among the FHWA,
the THC, the ACHP, and TxDOT, as well as the MOU between TxDOT and the THC.
Surface investigations consisted of an intensive 100 percent pedestrian survey of the project area by two
archeologists systematically examining the ground surface within the APE, as well as what could be
observed on private property outside of, and adjacent to, the FM 1235 ROW. None of the drainages had
significant cutbank exposures. Except for recent alluvium along Elm and Tippett Creeks, the soils in the
study area are upland soils that developed in situ from clayey shale and are not, therefore, conducive for
containing buried intact cultural deposits. Additionally, the project area has experienced substantial
surface and subsurface disturbances (i.e., buried utilities, drainage improvements, and roadway
construction and maintenance) that have resulted in a lack of intact sediments within the APE. Given
these conditions subsurface investigations involved judgmental shovel testing and limited backhoe
trenching.
Shovel testing focused on the 20 culverts that would be extended during the widening of FM 1235.
Shovel tests were also planned between Culvert Nos. 13 and 14 near previously recorded site 41TA69
that is located north of FM 1235 and outside of the ROW. However, surface investigations there revealed
exposed bedrock and gravels, thereby precluding shovel testing in that area. At the onset of field work it
was obvious that 11 of the culverts (nos. 2, 5–9, 11, and 16–19) are not associated with natural drainages
and are only for cross roadway drainage. As such, judgmental shovel tests were limited to culverts
associated with drainages that had discernible channels. Shovel tests were 30 to 40 centimeters in width
and excavated with a square-head shovel. All sediments removed from shovel tests were screened through
¼-inch wire mesh. All appropriate shovel test data was recorded on Blanton & Associates shovel test
forms and plotted with hand-held global positioning system (GPS) receivers. All field investigations were
thoroughly documented with digital cameras. No cultural materials were collected so curation was
unnecessary.
Backhoe trench excavations were conducted at Tippett Creek (Culvert No. 3) and Elm Creek (Culvert
No. 20). Excavated backhoe trenches were approximately five meters long, one meter wide, and 1.5
meters deep. All trenching activities were monitored by archeologists to avoid any unnecessary damage to
potentially buried cultural deposits. Following excavations, the archeologists cleaned and examined
trench walls to locate any in situ artifacts, features, or soil anomalies in the trench profiles. Stratigraphic
units in each trench were recorded and described in detail on a Blanton & Associates geologic profile
form and a photographic record of the investigations was made. Backhoe trench locations were plotted
with hand-held GPS receivers.
Site documentation involved the recording of the horizontal and vertical extent of all archeological sites
identified within the APE. Site data included a description of the site’s environment, cultural materials
noted within the APE, and observations on the continuance of any site that extend outside of the APE. All
recorded sites were evaluated with respect to their eligibility for inclusion to the NRHP (as per eligibility
criteria set forth in National Park Service regulations 36 CFR 60.4.) or for formal designation as a SAL
(as per criteria established in Chapter 26.8 of the Texas Antiquities Code).

RESULTS OF INVESTIGATIONS
Archeological investigations consisted of a 100 percent pedestrian survey of the APE and the excavation
of 15 shovel tests (ST) and seven backhoe trenches (BHT) to prospect for buried cultural deposits. Shovel
testing within the APE revealed very dry, hard, and compacted construction fill and/or dry and hard clay
strata truncated by roadway construction (Figures 3.1 and 3.2). Given the dry, hard, and compacted nature
of the clay soils, shovel tests extended 50 centimeters or less below ground surface (Appendix A). Deeper
tests were deemed unnecessary due to the clay soils in the APE that developed in situ, were disturbed, and
therefore had little potential for containing intact buried archeological materials. Only modern trash and
debris were noted in the upper 20 centimeters in a number of shovel tests excavated at culverts. Ground
surface visibility throughout the project area was 40 percent or greater (Figure 4).
Backhoe trench excavations at Tippett and Elm Creeks revealed soil conditions similar to those observed
during shovel testing (Figure 5; Appendix B). Backhoe Trenches 1–3 were located at the southern end of
the project area on Elm Creek (Culvert No. 20) and BHTs 4–7 were excavated on Tippett Creek (Culvert
No. 3) just southwest of View in the northern end of the project area (see Figures 3.1 and 3.2).
Although a phone company representative was present during excavations at Elm Creek, two abandoned
phone cables were cut during the excavation of BHT 1 in the northwest quadrant of the creek crossing.
BHTs 2 and 3 contained no cultural materials (Figure 6). At the request of the phone company
representative, a fourth BHT was not excavated in the northwest quadrant of the Elm Creek crossing due
to the presence of a large buried phone cable, the exact location of which could not be determined. Given
the close proximity of this location to residential areas in Buffalo Gap, several other phone cables are also
located in and adjacent to the Elm Creek crossing.
The excavation of BHTs 4–7 on Tippett Creek revealed disturbed construction fill overlying truncated
natural clay and no archeological materials (Figure 7). Although surface and subsurface investigations at
the various culvert locations and on Elm and Tippett Creeks discovered no archeological sites or artifacts,
two archeological sites (41TA275 and 41TA276) were discovered during the pedestrian survey. Unlike
the majority of the project area, the sites are associated with two discrete areas of fine sandy loam north of
Buffalo Gap.
41TA275
This site is an historic surface and subsurface trash scatter discovered on the steeply banked eastern edge
of the ROW between FM 89 and Elm Creek (Figure 8). The site was identified by a thin surface scatter of
historic glass shards, wire and cut nails, one horseshoe, and several pieces of unidentified rusted metal
randomly dispersed across the eastern edge of the ROW and continuing an unknown distance east of the
ROW into adjacent private property. Site boundaries within the eroded and steeply banked ROW extend
approximately 140 feet north-south by 10 feet east-west (Figure 9). Ground surface visibility was
approximately 40 to 50 percent within the maintained ROW.
Because of the excellent ground surface visibility and previous mechanical disturbances, subsurface
investigations on 41TA275 were limited to the excavation of ST 15 to determine the presence or absence
of a buried site component (see Figure 9). Buried artifacts included several salt glazed crockery
fragments, one whiteware fragment, one patinated and solarized manganese glass shard, six patinated

plate glass (window) shards, all of which appear to date to the late nineteenth and early twentieth
centuries (see Appendix A). Although artifacts were recovered from 0 to 30 centimeters (0 to 12 inches)
below ground surface in ST 15, the fact that the ROW has experienced surface and subsurface
disturbances and that the majority of the buried glass was patinated intimates that the artifacts were
exposed on the ground surface for some time prior to being buried. This strongly suggests that the
subsurface artifacts are in secondary contexts because of highway construction cut and fill activities.
Following field investigations, the owner of the property east of the FM 1235 ROW where site 41TA275
continues was contacted to determine if there had been a house, outbuildings, or other structures in that
location. The property in question is identified as Parcel 48627 with a legal description of A0059, Survey
111 Moses Evans (Taylor County Central Appraisal District 2006). The owner, a Mr. Brookreson of
Buffalo Gap, indicated that he was born on the property in 1928 after his father had purchased it in 1925
or 1926. Mr. Brookreson stated that he was raised on the property and had never seen a structure in that
area.
Considering the extensive impacts to the ROW and the questionable integrity of the subsurface deposit,
the part of site 41TA275 located on TxDOT property within the FM 1235 ROW has little research value
and is not recommended as eligible for the NRHP or for formal SAL designation. The eligibility of the
part of the site that extends east of the ROW onto private property is unknown as investigations there
were not possible.

41TA276
This site is a prehistoric knapping station exposed on the ground surface along the east side of the FM
1235 ROW on the margins of an upland rise (Figure 10). The landform is adjacent to a meander scar of
Elm Creek. Site boundaries within the eroded and steeply banked ROW extend about eight meters northsouth by three meters east-west (Figure 11). The site continues an unknown distance to the east-northeast
out of the ROW and into private property. Ground surface visibility was approximately 60 percent within
the maintained ROW.

Figure 10. Overview of 41TA276.
Observed cultural materials consisted of roughly 30 pieces of chipped-stone debitage consisting of several
primary, secondary flakes, and abundant tertiary flakes, all of which appear to reflect the reduction of a
single high quality bluish-grey Edwards-like chert nodule. Because of the excellent ground surface
visibility and previous mechanical disturbances, subsurface investigations on 41TA276 were limited to
the excavation of ST 16 to determine the presence or absence of a buried site component (see Figure 11
and Appendix A). Excavations encountered no buried artifacts, only very dry and hard reddish-brown
compacted fine sandy loam from 0 to 20 centimeters below ground surface overlying very dry, hard, and
compacted reddish-brown clay from 20 to 40 centimeters below ground surface. At 40 centimeters, the
matrix was impenetrable with shovels and the shovel test was halted.
Considering the extensive impacts to the ROW, the surficial character of the site, and the lack of
diagnostic artifacts, the part of site 41TA276 located on TxDOT property within the FM 1235 ROW has
little research value and is not recommended as eligible for the NRHP or for formal SAL designation. The
eligibility of the part of the site that extends east of the ROW onto private property is unknown as
investigations there were not possible.

SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS
Intensive archeological survey along FM 1235 resulted in the discovery of two previously unrecorded
archeological sites (41TA275 and 41TA276) within the existing ROW. The survey also indicated that the
APE has experienced pervasive disturbances from erosion, utilities, and construction activities.
Additionally, the majority of the soils throughout the study area are clays that developed in place from
calcareous and clayey shale and have little to no potential for containing intact buried archeological
deposits. Given those conditions, it is unlikely that any intact cultural resources would be impacted within
the APE by the planned roadway improvements.
The surface and subsurface artifacts observed in the ROW at historic 41TA275 are in secondary contexts,
having been disturbed during highway construction and maintenance. The horizontal and vertical integrity
of historic site 41TA275 is very questionable, with the patination on the glass shards recovered during
shovel testing indicating that the site was originally surficial. Discussions with the landowner east of FM
1235 where the site extends indicated that there was never a structure or structures at that location during
his 78 year association with the property, so site 41TA275 may represent only a roadside trash dump.
Given those conditions, the part of 41TA275 located within the existing ROW has little research
potential.
Prehistoric site 41TA276 is a discrete knapping station exposed on the ground surface within the steeply
banked FM 1235 ROW, as well as continuing east of the existing ROW. Shovel testing on site discovered
no subsurface components. Because of the disturbed surface context resulting from highway construction
and maintenance, as well as the lack of diagnostic artifacts, the part of site 41TA276 in the ROW has little
research potential.
Due to the project area’s low potential for containing intact subsurface cultural materials that could
contribute new or important data to our understanding of local and regional prehistory, Blanton &
Associates recommends that the proposed construction be allowed to proceed as planned within the
existing ROW at 41TA275 and 41TA276 without additional cultural resources investigations or
consultations. As the parts of the sites that continue east of the ROW could not be investigated, the extent,
nature, and integrity of those remains are unknown, as are their significance. However, the portions of
sites 41TA275 and 41TA276 within the ROW would not contribute to the sites’ NRHP and SAL
eligibilities if the parts of the sites outside of the ROW were determined at a later time to be NRHP and
SAL eligible.
If it is determined that TxDOT requires additional ROW at either site location for the proposed
construction or for future construction projects, then additional archeological survey is recommended to
examine those parts of 41TA275 and 41TA276 outside of the existing ROW. In the event that previously
unidentified cultural materials are discovered during construction, work in the immediate area would
cease and the TxDOT archeological staff would be contacted to initiate accidental discovery procedures
in accordance with the aforementioned PA and MOU.
