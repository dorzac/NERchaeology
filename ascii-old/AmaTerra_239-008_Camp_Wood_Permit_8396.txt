Abstract
In April of 2018, AmaTerra Environmental, Inc. (AmaTerra) conducted a cultural resources
investigation in support of the Lower Colorado River Authority Transmission Services
Corporation’s (LCRA TSC) T-269 Camp Wood to Leakey transmission line upgrade project
in Real County, Texas. The transmission line rebuild will replace all 150 existing support
structures along the 17.3 mile long transmission line with new single pole supported structures.
Of the 150 pole locations, 44 are located in areas where the slope exceeds 20 percent. These
locations were excluded from the survey. However, 22 of the omitted structure locations were
field verified as easily accessible and were pedestrian-surveyed as part of this study. A total
of 3.7 miles (21 structures) located at the eastern end of the project area was omitted from the
survey. These areas were assessed pre-field as well as during the survey as having extreme
slope and thus, a minimal chance to contain cultural resources. Additionally, LCRA cultural
resources staff stipulated each water crossing identified within the existing T-269 easement
that could necessitate modification was required to be surveyed. Also, in areas where heavy
vehicular traffic is expected when construction of the rebuild is undertaken, AmaTerra sampled
additional portions of the LCRA easement where archaeological site potential was highest
such as canyon heads or lookout locations. These areas were assessed through intensive
pedestrian archaeological survey and subjective shovel testing. In summary, AmaTerra visited
and assessed 129 pole locations (107 pedestrian-surveyed and shovel-tested and 22 pedestriansurveyed only), 13 water crossings, and three other areas considered to have a high potential
of cultural resource occurrence, totaling 145 locations spread over 13.6 linear miles. This
equates to approximately 266.5 acres surveyed within the existing T-269 easement. AmaTerra
conducted the archaeological survey under Texas Antiquities Permit No. 8396.
Investigations consisted of a systematic pedestrian walk-over survey of each defined locality
along the existing LCRA easement supplemented with the manual excavation of 268 shovel
tests throughout the proposed project area. Initially, 182 shovel tests were excavated within
the areas of interest as a discovery tactic; an additional 86 tests were excavated during site
delineation or as an assessment of isolated occurrences (IO). AmaTerra recorded 12 newly
documented archaeological sites (41RE155-166) and 13 IOs. All of the newly documented
archaeological resources are prehistoric. The lack of intact features, dateable materials, and/
or stratified deposits, coupled with poor organic preservation, the horizontal displacement
of artifacts across sites, and adverse effects from modern disturbances led investigators to
conclude that 11 of the 12 sites (41RE156-41RE166) have negligible research potential within
the existing LCRA easement. The portions of these sites that are contained within the existing
easement are evaluated as ineligible for listing as a State Antiquities Landmarks (SAL) and
no additional work is recommended. Site 41RE155 is the lone exception and was documented
as a seasonal encampment site with dateable features as well as intact subsurface deposits.
Investigators concluded that portions of 41RE155 within the existing easement have significant
intact deposits that may make it eligible for listing as a SAL and, therefore, should be avoided.
However, subsurface artifact density was sparse in direct proximity (within two meters) of the
structure footprint where removal and/or replacement will take place. Therefore, AmaTerra

recommends construction to proceed within the structure footprint as long as access is restricted
to the existing two-track access road and the eastern edge of the site boundary.
No artifacts were collected during the survey. All project-related records will be curated at the
Texas Archaeological Research Laboratory, University of Texas-Austin.

Introduction
In April 2018, on behalf of the Lower Colorado River Authority Transmission Services
Corporation (LCRA TSC), AmaTerra Environmental, Inc. (AmaTerra) conducted a cultural
resources survey and assessment in advance of the LCRA TSC’s proposed T-269 Camp
Wood to Leakey Transmission Line Upgrade Project in Real County, Texas (Figure 1.1). The
transmission line rebuild will replace all 150 existing support structures along the 17.3-mile
long transmission line with new single pole supported structures within the existing 100-footwide LCRA easement. A total of 3.7 miles (21 structures) located at the eastern end of the
project area was omitted from the survey. These areas were assessed pre-field as well as during
the survey as having extreme slope and thus a minimal chance to contain cultural resources.
Additionally, LCRA cultural resources staff stipulated each water crossing identified within
the existing T-269 easement that could necessitate modification was required to be surveyed.
Also, in areas where heavy vehicular traffic is expected when construction of the rebuild is
undertaken, AmaTerra sampled additional portions of the LCRA easement where archaeological
site potential was highest such as canyon heads or lookout locations. These areas were assessed
through intensive pedestrian archaeological survey and shovel testing.
In order to encapsulate each area (pole locations, water crossings and high potential areas)
adequately and assess the existing easement for cultural resources, a narrow buffer was placed
around the existing LCRA easement, effectively creating the Area of Potential Effect (APE).
For the purpose of this survey, all work was confined to the APE surrounding the existing
LCRA right-of-way (ROW) or the off-ROW road easements primarily located along areas of
steep slope. The off-ROW easements were visually assessed through a combination of windshield and pedestrian surveys. No cultural resources were observed at any of the off-ROW
easements and additional construction along the existing off-ROW easements is expected to
be minimal, if at all.
Of the 150 pole locations within the APE, 44 are in areas where the slope exceeds 20 percent.
These locations were excluded as part of the survey. However, 22 of the omitted structure
locations were field verified as easily accessible and were pedestrian surveyed as part of this
study. All told, AmaTerra visited and assessed a total of 129 pole locations (107 pedestriansurveyed and shovel-tested and 22 pedestrian surveyed only), in addition to 13 water crossings
and three areas determined as having high potential for cultural resource occurrence along the
APE, totaling 145 locations spread over 13.6 linear miles. This equates to approximately 266.5
acres surveyed within the existing T-269 easement.
As a governmental jurisdiction of the State of Texas, LCRA TSC is subject to the provisions
of the Antiquities Code of Texas (ACT). LCRA TSC authorized this program of cultural
resource investigations to ensure that significant cultural resources could be avoided during
the modernization of the T-269 transmission line and its associated components. AmaTerra’s
work conformed to the guidelines under 13 TAC Chapter 26, which outline the regulations for
implementing the ACT.

Field investigations took place in April of 2018, under Texas Antiquities Permit No. 8396. Tim
Griffith served as the project’s Principal Investigator and James J. Hill acted as the project
archaeologist, while Heath Bentley, Noel Steinle, Joshua Hamilton and Joshua Zatopek assisted
with field investigations.
The survey resulted in the identification of 12 new archaeological sites (41RE155–166), and
documented 13 Isolated Occurrences (IO). All 12 of the newly recorded sites are prehistoric
and consisted of nine lithic scatters and/or small campsites, two lithic procurement sites
and a single seasonal encampment site. Due to a lack of intact features, diagnostic artifacts,
dateable materials, organic remains, and stratified deposits, coupled with the adverse impacts
from modern disturbances and the movement of artifacts across the surface, eleven of the
twelve sites have little to no research potential and are assessed as ineligible for listing as
State Antiquities Landmarks (SAL) with no additional work recommended within the existing
LCRA TSC easement. Site 41RE155 is the lone exception and was documented with burned
rock and hearth features as well as subsurface cultural deposits. Investigators concluded
that 41RE155 has significant intact deposits that may make it eligible for listing as SAL and
recommended avoidance. However, subsurface artifact density was dense in direct proximity
(within two meters) of the structure footprint where pole removal and/or replacement will take
place. Therefore, AmaTerra recommends construction to proceed within the structure footprint
as long as access is restricted to the existing two-track access road and the eastern edge of the
site boundary.
No artifacts were collected, but all project related materials, such as field forms and photographs,
will be curated at the Texas Archaeological Research Laboratory (TARL), University of
Texas-Austin.
This report is divided into six chapters. The environmental setting and cultural overview
are discussed in Chapters 2 and 3 respectively. Chapter 4 includes the field methodology
implemented during the project. The results of field investigations are presented in Chapter 5.
Chapter 6 contains a summary and management recommendations.

Environmental Setting
The project area crosses the Balcones Canyonlands subregion of the Edwards Plateau
ecoregion (Figures 2.1 and 2.2). Largely a dissected limestone plateau, the Edwards Plateau is
characterized by rolling hills, intervening broad flat valleys and canyons, stairstep landforms,
and a karst topography resulting in numerous springs, streams, and rivers. Shaped during the
Miocene epoch, the southern portion of the Edwards Plateau separates central Texas from the
Texas coastal plain (Spearing 1991 cited in Griffith et al. 2007).

2.1	Climate
The climate is described as subtropical with hot, typically humid and wet summers with mild
to cool winters (Peel et al. 2007). Located between eastern mesic and western arid climates,
the Edwards Plateau is subject to periodic drought and drying westerly winds, as well as moist
humid weather originating in the Gulf of Mexico (Griffith et al. 2007). On average, the project
area receives between 25 and 30 inches of precipitation annually and has a mean air temperature
of 67 degrees Fahrenheit (USDA-NRCS 2018).

2.2	Geology
The bedrock geology underlying the Balcones Canyonlands subregion consists of Lower
Cretaceous limestone and dolomite of the Edwards Formation, interbedded dolomite, chalk,
marl, and mudstone of the Glen Rose Formation, Hensell Sand exposed in valleys and
floodplains, and Upper Cretaceous Buda Formation limestone caps (Griffith et al. 2007).
Specifically, the project area is underlain by a combination of Devils River Limestone (Kdv)
and Glen Rose Limestone (Kgr) of the Lower Cretaceous Period (BEG 1986; Figure 2.3).
Soils common across the Edwards Plateau ecoregion include Mollisols, Alfisols, Entisols, and
Inceptisols. Mollisols, which are located on flat or convex surfaces like hills and plateaus,
form in grassland environments and are characterized by a thick, dark surface horizon. These
soils are the most common type found in the Edwards Plateau ecoregion. On the other hand,
Alfisols, which are formed in semiarid to humid areas and are characterized by a clay-enriched
subsoil, are found in the floodplains and valleys, while entisols, soils lacking any soil profile
development aside from the A horizon, and Inceptisols, soils that form quickly through the
alteration of parent material, are found on slopes. Soil depth also varies across the Edwards
Plateau ecoregion with shallow and rocky soils on plateaus and hills, whereas deeper soils are
found across the plains and valley floors (Griffith et al. 2007).
According to the USDA Natural Resources Conservation Service (2018), soils within the
project area are mostly shallow loams and clays, alluvially deposited and overlain over shallow
limestone bedrock (Table 2.1).

feed into Ranch Creek and Flat Creek. The substation at which the T-269 line emanates outside
of Camp Wood is located approximately 0.4 miles east of the Nueces River and terminates
at a substation south of Leakey approximately 0.9 miles west of the Frio River. Both Rivers
ultimately empty into the Gulf of Mexico.

2.4	Flora
Generally, the Edwards Plateau ecoregion is characterized by a juniper-oak and mesquiteoak savanna (Figure 2.4). The Balcones Canyonlands consists of an upland woodland
composed of Texas oak (Quercus buckleyi), plateau live oak (Quercus fusiformis), Vasey oak
(Quercus vaseyana), Lacey oak (Quercus laceyi), Texas persimmon (Diospyros texana), ashe
juniper (Juniperus ashei), escarpment black cherry (Prunus serotina var. exima), and cedar
elm (Ulmus crassifolia), while riparian areas are characterized by baldcypress (Taxodium
distichum), American sycamore (Platanus americanus), black willow (Salix nigra), slippery
elm (Ulmus rubra), Ohio buckeye (Aesculus glabra), boxelder (Acer negundo), bigtooth maple
(Acer grandidentatum), and Carolina basswood (Tilia caroliniana). Disturbed grasslands and
grazed areas are comprised of little bluestem (Schizachyrium scoparium), yellow Indiangrass
(Sorghastrum nutans), sideoats grama (Bouteloua curtipendula), Texas wintergrass (Stipa
leucotricha), and threeawns (Aristida spp.). Found near crevice seeps and springs are maidenhair
fern (Adiantium capillus-veneris), tuber anemone (Anemone edwardsiana), and the southern
shield fern (Thelypteris kunthii) (Bezanson 2000; Amos and Rowell 1988 cited in Griffith et
al. 2007), while sumac (Rhus spp.), sotol (Dasylirion texanum), acacia (Acacia spp.), honey
mesquite (Prosopis glandulosa), and ceniza (Leucophyllum frutescens) (Riskin and Diamond
1988 cited in Griffith et al. 2007) are common across drier south and west-facing slopes. Rare
species include the canyon mockorange (Philadelphus ernestii) and Texas snowbell (Styrax
texana).

2.5	Fauna
The proposed project area falls within the Balconian Biotic Province of Texas (Blair 1950),
which was created through the “realization that the Balcones Fault Zone was a major physical
factor in the distribution of animals in central Texas” (Neck 1986). Differences in xericity, or
arid conditions, and changes in geological substrate differentiate the Balconian biotic province
from neighboring provinces. Mammals well suited to the conditions characteristic of this
subregion include the white tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus), red wolf (Canis rufus), gray
wolf (Canis lupus), black bear (Ursus americanus), mountain lion (Puma concolor), prairie dog,
badger (Taxidea taxus), black-footed ferret (Mustela nigripes), ground squirrels (Marmotini
spp.), woodrats (Neotoma floridana), porcupine (Erithizon dorsatum), coyote (Canis latrans),
and Mexican free-tailed bats (Tadarida brasiliensis). Birds such as the Rio Grande wild turkey
(Meleagris gallopavo intermedia), golden-cheeked warbler (Setophaga chrysoparia), blackcapped vireo (Vireo atricapilla), scissor-tailed flycatcher (Tyrannus forticatus), and the brownheaded cowbird (Molothrus ater) migrate through or live permanently within this province.
Lastly, aquatic species supported by the spring-fed waterways include the widemouth blindcat
(Satan eurystomus), sun fish (Lepomis spp.), channel catfish (Ictalurus punctatus), Guadalupe
bass (Micropterus treculi), largemouth bass (Micropterus salmoides), Comal blind salamander
(Eurycea tridentifera), and the Blanco blind salamander (Typhlomolge robusta) (Griffith et al.
2007).

Regional Cultural Background
and Previous Investigations
The project area is situated at the crossroads of two archaeological regions as defined by Perttula
(2004) (Figure 3.1 6). The project straddles the central Texas and south Texas archaeological
areas. A cultural chronology of these areas has been developed by Story (1985) and Johnson
and Goode (1994) with refinements by Black (1989a, b), Collins (1995, 2004), and Hester
(2004). Large-scale archaeological projects by McGraw and Hindes (1987) and Thoms and
Mandel (2007) have documented a detailed record of occupation for the Medina River and Elm
Creek areas in the Late Paleoindian through Historic periods.
Typically, cultural chronology in Texas is divided into four major periods of time: Paleoindian
(16,000–8800 years before the present [BP]), Archaic (8800–1200/1300 BP), Late Prehistoric
(1200/1300–350 BP), and Historic (350 BP–present) (Prewitt 1981). While the Prehistoric
Periods are principally defined by the presence of diagnostic projectile points and other
technologies, they are intended to order cultural change and are thus somewhat arbitrary;
cultural change proceeded at somewhat different rates over the vast area of Texas. A regional
chronology of the Paleoindian, Archaic, Late Prehistoric and Historic periods are detailed in
the following sections.

3.1	Paleoindian (Ca. 16,000–8800 BP)
The arrival of humans in the New World may have occurred as early as 16,000 years ago with
people that pre-date Clovis groups (Jennings and Waters 2014). Evidence of a “Pre-Clovis”
occupation of Texas has been theorized at the Debra L. Friedkin Site located along Buttermilk
Creek in Bell County (Waters et al. 2011). Artifacts found at this site include bifaces, a discoidal
core, edge-modified flake tools, blade fragments, bladelets, a polished piece of hematite, and
macrodebitage. Other sites in Central Texas with potential Pre-Clovis components include the
Gault Site, situated upstream from the Debra L. Friedkin Site.
The Paleoindian period (ca. 11,500–8,800 years BP) is divided into early and late subperiods
in central and portions of south Texas (Collins 1995, 2004). Each subperiod is characterized
by distinct styles of lanceolate projectile points and other stone tool technologies. Early
Paleoindian sites are characterized by Clovis or Folsom projectile points, with each associated
with a subsistence pattern related to hunting extinct forms of megafauna, primarily mammoth
for the earlier Clovis hunters and bison for later Folsom hunters. Each group also used a wide
variety of other animal and plant resources. Late Paleoindian sites are also associated with a
series of distinctive projectile point forms: Plainview, Golondrina, Scottsbluff, and Angostura.
Evidence from central and south Texas indicates that these later Paleoindian groups were
using a more generalized hunting and gathering subsistence pattern similar to that of later

Archaic groups in the region. Early and late Paleoindian site types are similar and include open
campsites, special-purpose sites for procuring specific resources, and kill sites for mammoth
and bison.
Notable Paleoindian sites occurring in central Texas within the general vicinity of the project
area include the Wilson-Leonard, Gault, Pavo Real, and Berger Bluff sites. In addition to these
excavated sites, numerous instances of Paleoindian projectile points have been documented in
unstratified surface deposits throughout Central, South, and Southeast Texas. Environmental
studies suggest that Late Pleistocene Epoch climates were wetter and cooler (Mauldin and
Nickels 2001; Toomey et al. 1993) during most of the Paleoindian Period with a gradual shift
to drier and warmer conditions at the onset of the Early Holocene Epoch (Bousman 1998). As
megafauna gradually died off, inhabitants of Central and South Texas shifted their subsistence
patterns towards smaller game and an increased reliance on plant foraging. This cultural change
is visible in the archaeological record and marks the onset of the Archaic Period.

3.2

Archaic Period (Ca. 8800–1200/1300 BP)

The Archaic period is subdivided into Early (ca. 8800–6000 BP), Middle (ca. 6000–4000
BP), and Late subperiods (ca. 4000–1200/1300 BP) (Collins 1995, 2004; Hester 2004). The
Archaic period represents a continuation of the generalized hunting and gathering lifeway that
characterized the Late Paleoindian subperiod. Each subperiod is characterized by distinctive
changes in lithic technology and projectile dart point styles and groundstone technology, some
of which are regionally specific for central and south Texas. Changes in technology and broad
changes in subsistence and site types are correlated with regional changes in climate and
resource distribution through time. Some indication of increasing social complexity during the
Middle and Late Archaic is evident by the appearance of regional cemeteries, distinctive burial
practices, and the presence of various artifacts manufactured of non-local raw materials such
as marine shell ornaments, bannerstones, and boat stones. Such artifacts imply participation in
larger regional exchange networks, some of which have been traced to the greater southeastern
United States. Presence of established mortuary areas during the period is indicative of specific
group territories and the existence of maintained, and in some cases defended, social boundaries
among groups. A wide variety of site types has been recorded for the Archaic period. Although
site types are rather comparable through the period, frequencies of different types of sites
fluctuate over time and may be related in large part to continuing changes in environmental
conditions and available resources. Site types include rockshelters, open campsites, specialpurpose resource extraction locations (burned rock middens, ring middens, lithic procurement
areas), and mortuary sites or cemeteries.

3.2.1 Early Archaic
The Early Archaic subperiod (ca. 8800–6000 BP) is characterized by “very low population
density, small band sizes, highly mobile, and extremely large territorial ranges” (Black
1989a:49). This behavior may be attributed to the arid environment (Hester 2004), as this
climate required inhabitants to be near water. For the region, Thomas Hester (2004:136)
AmaTerra Environmental, Inc.

An Archaeological Examination of the T-269 Camp Wood
to Leakey Transmission Line Upgrade Project, Real County, Texas

divides the Early Archaic into two horizons: early corner-notched and early basal notched.
The early corner-notched horizon has corner-notched dart points with recurved or notched
bases. These point types include Martindale, Uvalde, Baker, Bandy, and Gower dart points,
and Guadalupe tools. The early basal-notched horizon is characterized by dart points with deep
basal notches, large bulbs, and distinctive long stems. Point types include the Bell and Andice
dart points. Additional tools associated with this horizon include early triangular bifaces and
large unifacial Clear Fork tools.

3.2.2 Middle Archaic
Dating from about 6000–4000 BP, the Middle Archaic subperiod is marked by the onset of
the Altithermal, a long episode of warming and drying (Meltzer 1999). This subperiod is also
associated with a shift in subsistence to a greater reliance on plant resources (Black 1989b;
Hester 2004). Regional tools associated with the Middle Archaic include Abasolo, Bulverde,
Lange, Morhiss, Pedernales, and Tortugas projectile points, unifacial distally beveled tools like
the Nueces tool, and marine shell ornaments and tools. Reliance on plant resources is evident
through “an increase in formal hearths, earth ovens, and burned rock accumulations” (Hester
2004:139), as well as the presence of ground stone tools, such as tubular stone pipes, grinding
slabs, and manos.

3.2.3 Late Archaic
The Late Archaic subperiod dates from ca. 4000–1200/1300 BP. Kent and Gary make up the
dominant dart point types associated with the Late Archaic in Texas. Regionally, sites show
a shift to the utilization of more local lithic source material that is of poorer quality, which
signifies a reduction in group mobility and more spatially restricted territories (Story 1990).
Another line of evidence showing reduction in group mobility is the increase in cemeteries in
South and Central Texas. One prominent example is the Ernest Witte site in Austin County
that contained over 200 individuals spanning the Middle and Late Archaic. Burials that dated
to the Late Archaic contained a wide variety of grave goods that includes Ensor and Fairland
dart points, corner-tanged knives, groundstone “boatstones,” a gorget, bone pins, and conch
shell beads and pendants. Large cemeteries with grave goods become increasingly common in
the Late Archaic, and the fact that the same types of grave goods are found with both male and
female burials suggests a somewhat egalitarian social organization (Ricklis 2004).

3.3	Late Prehistoric Period (Ca. 1200/1300–350 BP)
The Late Prehistoric period (ca. 1200/1300–350 BP) in Central and South Texas was marked
by increased apparent social boundary differentiation and a continuation of the basic hunting
and gathering subsistence strategy (Collins 1995, 2004; Hester 2004). Collins (2004) divides
the period into an Austin and Toyah interval. Three significant traits—pottery, bow and arrow,
and agriculture—also make their appearance during the Late Prehistoric. Austin and Toyah
intervals have become hallmarks of the Late Prehistoric for Central and South Texas. The
Austin interval is associated with a technological shift from Late Archaic style dart points to
14

AmaTerra Environmental, Inc.

Chapter 3

smaller arrow points associated with initial use of the bow and arrow technology; otherwise,
there is actually little change in terms of subsistence patterns from the preceding Late Archaic
period. The Toyah interval is distinguished by one primary arrow point style, the Perdiz point.
Other technological aspects of Toyah assemblages include end scrapers, prismatic chert blades,
and large thin bifacial knives—all of which are interpreted as signatures of a bison, deer, or
antelope hunting tool kit. It is significant that the traits of Toyah assemblages appear at about
the same time across Central and South Texas and beyond into East Texas. This distribution has
led some researchers to question whether it represents the spread of an adopted technological
system by multiple ethnic groups or the widespread presence of a single ethnic group (Black
1989a, b; Johnson 1994; Ricklis 1994). Late Prehistoric cemeteries or mortuary areas indicate
a continuation of the territorial boundary aspect developed during the Middle and Late Archaic,
but perhaps for different social objectives. Site types reflect a continuation of those identified
during previous periods: open occupation or camp sites, burned rock midden sites and hearth
features, shell middens, lithic procurement sites and rockshelters, caves, and sinkholes. Isolated
burials, cemeteries, rock art sites, and artifact caches reflect special-purpose sites. Some sites
have also had small ephemeral structures associated with them.

3.4	Historic Period (350 BP–Present)
The Historic period (beginning ca. 350 BP) covers the time of initial contact between Europeans
and Native Americans and the subsequent interactions of these populations following the
establishment of European and later Anglo settlements. Collins (2004) has assigned early,
middle, and late subperiods. Archaeological research and existing historic written accounts
by Spanish, French, and Anglo writers provide the basis for virtually all of our knowledge of
this period. Written records provide a much more detailed glimpse into the lifeways and social
aspects of native populations than exist for previous periods. The Historic period subsumes
initial Spanish and French exploration; military and religious expeditions into Central and
South Texas; and the subsequent establishment of the Spanish mission system in the 1700s.
During this period, Native American populations were subjected to a dramatic influx of
innovative ideas, new technologies, and diseases. Subsistence patterns continued to emphasize
mixed hunting and gathering, primarily of bison, deer, and antelope, with movement of native
groups directed in response to game routes. Site types are similar to those documented for the
Late Prehistoric and Protohistoric periods, but with the occasional use of European artifacts
and materials as part of the technological system. Following the forced removal of the last
mobile groups in the region, mainly the Comanche in Central Texas, Anglo-European and
Hispanic settlers established farms and ranches and developed urbanized areas.

3.4.1 Real County
Throughout the historic period, long-term settlement in Real County has been concentrated
in the Frio and Nueces Canyons. The first European settlement in Real County was the San
Lorenzo de la Santa Cruz Mission, established in 1762 on the Nueces River near presentday Camp Wood. The mission was created by Spanish Franciscan friars with help from the
Spanish military. The mission and nearby settlement of the same name served the purpose of

15

establishing a Spanish presence in the far northern reaches of their territory, an area threatened
by the French. Two friars and 20 Spanish soldiers were stationed at the mission, which within
a week had attracted 400 Lipan Apaches seeking protection from their Comanche enemies
(Chipman 2018). Over the next few years the Spanish and Apaches constructed 14 adobe and
limestone buildings, a bastion, and irrigation ditches in nearby fields (Texas Beyond History
2018). By 1767, though, the Lipan bands had moved on and the Mission (which was never
sanctioned by the Spanish Viceroy) was officially closed in 1771 (Chipman 2018).
After the Spanish abandoned the mission there was little European or Euro-American presence
in what would become Real County until 1856 when John and Nancy Leakey, along with a
small group of other settlers, established a settlement in the Frio Canyon near the current town
of Leakey. Around the same time the Rio Frio settlement was established about six miles to the
south (Minton 2016). In 1857 the U.S. military set up the Camp Wood outpost on the Nueces
River near the former site of Mission San Lorenzo de la Santa Cruz. Federal troops abandoned
the post in 1861 with the outbreak of the Civil War, and Confederate troops occupied it for the
duration of the war. After the war ended it was periodically used by Texas Rangers and the U.S.
Army (Minton 2016). Despite this military presence, Indian attacks on settlers in the Frio and
Nueces Canyons were common until 1881.
Since the mid nineteenth century, ranching has dominated the local economy, though farming
was also common until a boll weevil infestation in 1910 caused it to decline significantly.
Until the early twentieth century, cotton, corn, oats, tobacco, and wheat were all grown in Frio
Canyon. Lumber mills in Frio Canyon that processed local cypress trees were also important to
the area’s economy in the late nineteenth century. By 1910, angora goat ranching had become
particularly important as well (Minton 2016).
Isolation and difficult travel to nearby county seats prompted the Texas Legislature to create
Real County in 1913 from parts of Edwards, Bandera, and Kerr Counties. Leakey was selected
as its county seat (Minton 2016). In 1920 the Uvalde and Northern Railway built north to
Camp Wood to transport Cedar trees from this part of the county. The railroad created a link
between Real County and national markets and encouraged immigration to the area. The
county’s population increased from 1,461 in 1920 to 2,197 in 1930. Even after the railroad
came, travel between the Frio and Nueces Canyons was long and difficult until Farm Road 337
was completed in 1948. Therefore, despite living in the same county, residents tend to identify
themselves based on their residence in either the Frio or Nueces Canyon (Minton 2016).
Today, ranching continues to be an important part of the lifestyle and economy of Real County,
although angora goat ranching has steadily declined since the 1950s. Over the last few decades
tourism and hunting have become important to the local economy (Minton 2016). As of 2014
the population of Real County was 3,371 (Minton 2016).

3.5	Previous Cultural Resource Investigations
The Texas Archaeological Sites Atlas (Atlas) was consulted to identify previous surveys and
recorded cultural resources. Research focused on the identification of archaeological sites,
16

AmaTerra Environmental, Inc.

Chapter 3

Registered Texas Historic Landmarks (RTHLs), sites listed as SALs, sites listed on the
National Register of Historic Places (NRHP), cemeteries, and archaeological surveys within
one kilometer (0.62 mile) of the project area. According to the Atlas, four previous surveys
fall within the one-kilometer (0.62-mile) buffer of the existing LCRA easement (Figure 3.2).
Of the four surveys, one was completed thirty years ago, and had limited data available on the
Atlas. The survey was undertaken in 1988 on behalf of the Environmental Protection Agency
(EPA). Two additional surveys were undertaken consecutively by SWCA in 2009 on behalf
of the Hill Country Telephone Corporation. The surveys were sponsored by the United States
Department of Agriculture (USDA) and work was performed under Texas Antiquities Permit
4952. Kevin Miller of SWCA served as the Principal Investigator for the project. A fourth
survey was undertaken in 2011 by Geo-Marine, Inc. on behalf of the City of Leakey and the
Nueces River Authority. The work was performed under Texas Antiquities Permit 5174 and
Melissa Green of Geo-Marine served as the Principal Investigator (Atlas 2018).
A total of six previously recorded archaeological sites (41RE64, 41RE65, 41RE71, 41RE72,
41RE124 and 41RE154) are located within one kilometer of the project area. None of the sites
are listed or recommended as eligible for listing as a NRHP or as a SAL. Only one of these
sites, 41RE65, is located directly within the APE. Recorded in 1980 by Daniel E. Fox, little
information about the site was available on the Atlas. However, it was determined ineligible
for NRHP listing despite the large size of the site (on the Atlas, it is listed as 2000-meter[N-S]
by 600-meter [E-W]; Atlas 2018). Six existing tower locations are located within the 41RE65
boundary and were each shovel tested as part of the T-269 re-design survey. No cultural material
was recorded within any of the twelve shovel tests dug at these locations and no artifacts were
observed on the surface.
Review of historic aerial photography and maps shows that historically the area has always been
extremely rural. Due to the ruggedness of the terrain, little in the way of agriculture and urban
development has occurred in the area surrounding the existing T-269 easement. Historically,
Camp Wood, located approximately 0.25 mile north of the western terminus of the existing
T-269 easement, was the site of Mission San Lorenzo de la Santa Cruz mentioned above. The
remains of mission San Lorenzo have been excavated by Curtis D. Tunnell formerly of the
Texas Memorial Museum and currently are the subject of ongoing excavations by the Texas
Archaeological Society (TAS) and their summer field school under the direction of Dr. Tamra
Walter of Texas Tech University.
A 1927 United States Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) topographic map demonstrates the
lack of development in the region as recent as the early part of the 20th century (Figure 3.3).
The only built environment depicted in Figure 3.3 in proximity to the proposed T-269 re-design
plan is what is presumed to be the “Friday” Ranch located within Bee Cave Hollow just east of
where the transmission crosses the Dry Rio Frio. Subsequent maps and photographs analyzed
from 1954 and after do not show any signs of the Friday Ranch (Figure 3.4 and Figure 3.5a–b).
Figure 3.4 does, however, indicate a different ranch constructed towards the western terminus
of the T-269 transmission line sometime between 1929 and 1954. A series of USGS topographic
maps from 1971 to 1973 do not indicate the presence of either of the two historic ranches, and
it is presumed the latter ranch on the 1954 USGS topographic map was abandoned at some

point between 1954 and 1973 (Figure 3.6a–c). The presence of the T-269 transmission line (the
Camp Wood substation and at least portions of what is now known as the T-269 transmission
line) on the historic maps and photographs indicate its construction is at least nearly fifty to
seventy years old and thus likely never surveyed. Recent aerial photographs do not show a
significant increase in development or housing construction in and around the project area,
further demonstrating the rugged terrain T-269 traverses.

Methods
Prior to field investigations, archaeologists conducted archival research to assess the potential
for historic-period localities. This research involved examining historical maps and aerial
photographs. In addition, archaeologists consulted the Atlas (2018) to assess previously
recorded archaeological sites within or near the project area, as well as a review of literature
on archaeological sites within the region (for example: Miller et al. 2008). This allowed
investigators to identify previously recorded archaeological sites adjacent to or within the
APE, and provided insight into site types, site settings, artifact assemblages, and average depth
of cultural materials below the ground surface. Lastly, the APE was overlaid on aerial based
gridded maps and loaded onto hand-held GPS units to aid in navigation.
Field work was conducted from April 16–23, 2018. The archaeological survey conformed to
survey standards set forth by the Council of Texas Archaeologists (CTA). The transmission line
rebuild will replace all 150 existing support structures along the 17.3-mile long transmission
line with new single pole supported structures within the existing 100-foot-wide existing
easement. A total of 3.7 miles (21 structures) located at the eastern end of the project area was
omitted from the survey. These areas were assessed pre-field as well as during the survey as
having extreme slope and thus a minimal chance to contain cultural resources. Additionally,
LCRA cultural resources staff stipulated each water crossing identified within the existing
T-269 easement that might require modification was required to be surveyed. Also, in areas
where heavy vehicular traffic is expected when construction of the rebuild is undertaken,
AmaTerra sampled additional portions of the LCRA easement where archaeological site
potential was highest such as canyon heads or lookout locations. These areas were assessed
through intensive pedestrian archaeological survey and subjective shovel testing.
In order to encapsulate each area (pole location, water crossing and high potential areas)
adequately and assess the existing easement for cultural resources, a narrow buffer was placed
around the existing LCRA easement effectively creating the APE. For the purpose of this
survey, all work was confined to the APE surrounding the existing LCRA ROW or the offROW road easements primarily located along water crossings or areas of steep slope. The offROW easements were visually assessed through a combination of wind-shiled and pedestrian
surveys. No cultural resources were observed aat any of the off-ROW easements and additional
construction along the existing off-ROW easements is expected to be minimal, if at all.
Of the 150 pole locations, 44 were in areas where the slope exceeded 20 percent. These
locations were excluded as part of the survey. However, 22 of the omitted structure locations
were field verified as easily accessible and were pedestrian-surveyed as part of this study. All
told, AmaTerra visited and assessed a total of 129 pole locations (107 pedestrian-surveyed
and shovel-tested and 22 pedestrian-surveyed only), in addition to 13 water crossings and
three areas determined as having a high potential of cultural resource occurrence along the
APE, totaling 145 locations spread over 13.6 linear miles. This equates to approximately 266.5

acres surveyed within the existing T-269 easement. Survey included visual inspection and
shovel testing of each of the aforementioned areas identified within the APE. Additionally,
archaeologists drove or walked the majority of the transmission line to visually inspect areas
with limited potential for cultural resources.
In general, each of the 129 previously identified pole locations was visually inspected and subject
to two shovel tests. In some cases, fewer than two shovel tests were excavated if the location
showed clear evidence of ground disturbance or where limestone bedrock was observed at the
surface. Occasionally more than two shovel tests were excavated at or near a replacement pole
location if the terrain looked particularly favorable for archaeological sites. At water crossings,
the area was pedestrian-surveyed and/or shovel-tested if there was potential for buried cultural
deposits. Shovel tests measured 30 cm in diameter and extend to a maximum depth of 60
cm below surface (cmbs). The shovel tests were excavated in 10 cm increments and all soil
was screened through ¼-inch hardware cloth. Shovel tests were backfilled upon completion.
Relevant information for all shovel tests was be recorded on a standardized form and shovel
test locations were marked with handheld GPS units.
For the purposes of this survey, an archaeological site was defined as containing a certain
number of cultural materials or features older than 50 years within a given area. The definition
of a site was: (1) five or more surface artifacts within a 30-m radius, or (2) a single cultural
feature, such as a hearth or burned rock midden, observed on the surface or exposed during
shovel testing, or (3) a positive shovel test containing at least three total artifacts, or (4) two
positive tests located within an individual structure’s footprint.
In general, all archaeological sites identified within the APE were investigated by means of
no fewer than six subsurface tests to define site boundaries within the APE. However, in areas
where surficial bedrock was noted across the site, less than six shovel tests were excavated, and
the site was delineated by surficial artifact distribution. Specific site information was recorded
in the field through field notes, hand-drawn maps, digital photographs, and GPS points. This
information was later recorded on standardized forms and presented to TARL for inclusion in
their archives and assignment of new site trinomials. Any artifacts found either on the surface
or in shovel tests were catalogued and photographed in the field and returned to their original
locations. No artifacts were collected during the survey.

Results
The T-269 transmission line extends from an existing LCRA substation along River Road,
just east of the Nueces River in Camp Wood, Texas east to the LCRA substation south of
Leakey, Texas approximately 0.50 miles from the intersection of US 83 and Stanford Hollow
Road. The T-269 transmission line traverses extremely rugged and rural terrain between the
Nueces and Frio rivers, crossing the Dry Frio River as well as several other smaller first order
streams and several mapped natural spring locations along southern Real County (Figures 5.1
a–b). There is no evidence the T-269 transmission line had ever previously been assessed for
cultural resources prior to the AmaTerra investigation as only a few archaeological sites had
been recorded in the vicinity of the project area apart from Camp Wood located at the western
terminus of the transmission line (Atlas 2018).
A total of 13.6 miles (21.9-km) were surveyed as part of the survey (Figure 5.2a–b). A total
of 3.7 miles (21 structures) located at the eastern end of the project area was omitted from the
survey. These areas were assessed pre-field as well as during the survey as having extreme
slope and thus a minimal chance to contain cultural resources. Of the 150 pole locations
located within the APE, 44 are located in areas where the slope exceeds 20 percent. These
locations were excluded as part of the survey. However, 22 of the omitted structure locations
were field verified as easily accessible and were pedestrian-surveyed as part of this study. All
told, AmaTerra visited and assessed a total of 129 pole locations (107 pedestrian-surveyed and
shovel-tested and 22 pedestrian-surveyed only), in addition to 13 water crossings and three
areas determined as having a high potential of cultural resource occurrence along the APE,
totaling 145 locations spread over 13.6 linear miles. This equates to approximately 266.5 acres
surveyed within the existing T-269 easement.
A total of 268 shovel tests were excavated as part of the field efforts (Appendix A). A typical
shovel test measured approximately 30 centimeters (cm) in diameter and extended no deeper
than 60 cm below surface (cmbs). Shovel tests were typically shallow, extending between 20
and 40 cmbs and comprised of a series of silty clay, silt loam and silty clay loams. Variability
within shovel tests did exist and was depended largely on localized field conditions including
areas of disturbance, water crossings, bedrock, etc. The shovel tests were excavated in 10-cm
increments and all soil was screened through a ¼-inch hardware cloth. Relevant information
for all shovel tests was recorded on a standardized form and will be curated at TARL along
with all other documentation associated with the project after the final report is submitted to
LCRA.
Field efforts identified 12 previously undocumented archaeological sites and 13 IO’s. For the
purposes of this survey, an archaeological site was defined as containing a specified number of
cultural materials or features older than 50 years within a given area.

All artifacts were field catalogued and returned to their original locations as per LCRA
requirement that no artifacts were to be collected during the survey. A discussion of each site
is found below.

5.1 	Site 41RE155 (The Phillips Site)
Site 41RE155 is a prehistoric
site situated on a flat alluvial
terrace
that
overlooks
Ranch Creek (Figure 5.3).
The site encompasses 5.56
acres and is defined by two
burned rock features, one
subsurface hearth, and a
laterally extensive lithic
scatter (Figure 5.4). The
site was identified through
extensive pedestrian survey
and a series of shovel tests
excavated within the APE.
Ground surface visibility
was excellent, averaging
75–80 percent across the site.
Figure 5.3. Overview of 41RE155, looking east
Vegetation within the APE
included live oak, ashe juniper
and mesquite mixed with a multitude of grass and cactus species. According to the USDANRCS Web Soil Survey (2018), soils within the site are affiliated with three named soil groups
that include the Mailtrail-Mereta complex with zero to five percent slopes, the Dev-Riverwash
complex with zero to three percent slopes, and the Campwood-Knippa complex with zero to
three percent slopes. Shovel tests placed throughout the site are typified by very dark grayish
brown (10YR 3/2) silty loam overlaying a dark brown (10YR 3/3) silty clay loam or clay loam
at depths ranging from 40–50 cmbs.
Site 41RE155 was initially revealed to the archaeologists by the ranch manager, Mr. Ron
Phillips, who noted that the site had been surface collected in the past. Pedestrian survey
confirmed that temporal diagnostics (i.e. projectile points) were largely absent from the site.
Fifteen shovel tests were placed within the site boundary, seven of which contained cultural
material. Over 150 pieces of lithic debitage, fire-cracked rock, faunal material, and charcoal
were recovered from depths that ranged from 0–40 cmbs in a silty loam.
Additionally, a dense lithic scatter, including an untyped dart point, was observed on the site
surface. Cultural material documented at 41RE155 consists of angular and flake debris, firecracked rock, biface fragments, cores, a hammerstone, unifacial and bifacial lithic tools, a dart
point, faunal remains, and charcoal.

Seven positive shovel tests
located along both the east
and west sides of the existing
transmission
structure
contained cultural material
and were delineated with
shovel tests in both directions
(see Figure 5.4; Appendix A).
Positive tests occur alongside
the north and south corridor
boundaries as well, suggesting
cultural deposits associated
with 41RE155 extend outside
of the APE.
In addition to the extensive
buried sub-subsurface deposits,
shovel testing revealed the
presence of three features
within 41RE155 that included
two burned rock middens and
hearth feature. One of the two
burned rock features contains
both surface and sub-surface
deposits. The hearth feature
identified during shovel testing
was buried approximately 25
cmbs and extended to a depth
of 45 cmbs (Figures 5.5–5.6).

Therefore,
investigators conclude that 41RE155 has significant intact deposits that may make it eligible
for listing as a SAL and recommend avoidance. However, subsurface artifact density was
sparse in direct proximity (within two meters) of the structure footprint where pole removal
and/or replacement will take place. Artifact density dropped dramatically east of the structure,
suggesting disturbance from previous structure installation. Therefore, AmaTerra recommends
construction to proceed within the structure footprint as long as access is restricted to the
existing two-track access road and the eastern edge of the site boundary.

5.2	Site 41RE156
Site 41RE156 is a diffuse surficial lithic scatter situated on a terrace overlooking a shallow
ephemeral drainage (Figure 5.7). The site was identified through pedestrian survey and six
shovel tests placed along the APE. Ground surface visibility within the APE was excellent (75–
100 percent). Site vegetation included live oak, ashe juniper, persimmon and a several different
grass species (Figure 5.8). The site measures 0.32 acres and was defined by surficial artifacts
dispersed across the site. According to the USDA-NRCS Web Soil Survey (2018), soils within
the site area consist entirely of Pratley clay with zero to three percent slopes. Shovel tests
placed within the site area encountered very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) gravelly sandy
loam overlying a grayish brown (10YR 5/2) gravelly clay or bedrock at depths ranging from
5–35 centimeters below surface (cmbs).
Six shovel tests were placed in the site boundary as a means to probe for subsurface deposits.
None of the shovel tests contained cultural material. Eleven pieces of lithic debitage, a core,
and two bifaces were recorded on the surface of Site 41RE156. One of the bifaces had three
notches and as a result was typed as a potential Montell projectile point (Figure 5.9). Lithic
raw materials included gray and grayish brown Edwards chert.
Site 41RE156 is a small, surficial lithic scatter located on deflated and eroded terrain. The
portion of the site located within the existing easement has little to no additional research
potential beyond the locational data gathered during survey. Therefor, additional work within
the site boundary is suggested at this time and 41RE156 is not recommended eligible for listing
as a SAL.

5.3	Site 41RE157
Site 41RE157 is a prehistoric lithic resource procurement site situated on an upland erosional
hilltop (Figure 5.10). The site consists of a knapping station (Feature 1) and an extensive
scatter of lithic debitage including cores, bifaces, tested cobbles and expedient flaked tools
(Figure 5.11). The site was identified through extensive pedestrian survey and the excavation
of six shovel tests placed within the APE. Ground surface visibility was excellent (90–100
percent) and laterally extensive bedrock excposures were observed across much of the site.
Vegetation within the site boundary includes ashe juniper, mountain laurel and salt bush.
The site measures approximately 2.6 acres and is defined primarily through an abundance of
surficial artifacts and natural occurring chert on-site (Figure 5.12). According to the USDANRCS Web Soil Survey (2018), soils within the site area consist entirely of Eckrant-Rock
outcrop complex with one to twenty percent slopes. Shovel tests placed within the site area
encountered gravelly organic soils overlying bedrock approximately 5 cmbs.
A knapping station was the only feature documented at the site and consisted of an in-situ
hammerstone and core along with several discarded crude biface fragments and a scatter of
chipping debris located within a small, two-meter circular radius (Figure 5.13). The lithic
assemblage is comprised entirely of cherts documented on site with the exception of the
hammerstone.

Site 41RE157 is a lithic procurement site with an associated lithic scatter. No observed subsurface component was identified. The site appears to be largely intact apart from the tower
location and a two-track access road as well as past surface collection defined by the presence
of several piles of non-diagnostic lithic artifacts. The lack of sub-surface deposits limits further
research at the site, but questions about lithic processing and procurement sources may still
be able to be addressed. However, it is recommended that planned construction may proceed
as much of the site, including the knapping feature, is located well outside the footprint of the
lone structure within the site boundary. Therefore, the portions of 41RE157 within the current
LCRA easement have limited research potential beyond locational data collected as part of the
survey and is recommended ineligible for listing as a SAL.

5.4	Site 41RE158
Site 41RE158 is a diffuse prehistoric lithic scatter situated along a two-track road on a short
terrace overlooking an ephemeral drainage (Figure 5.14). The site was assessed through
extensive pedestrian survey and seven shovel tests placed along the APE where ground surface
visibility was moderate (25–50 percent). Vegetation within the site boundary includes live
oak, ashe juniper, persimmon and grasses (Figure 5.15). The site measures approximately
1.08 acres and was defined primarily through surficial artifact distribution. According to the
USDA-NRCS Web Soil Survey (2018), soils within the site area consist entirely of Pratley clay
with zero to three percent slopes. Shovel tests placed within the site area encountered very dark
grayish brown (10YR 3/2) sandy clay overlying a dark yellowish brown (10YR 4/4) clay loam
or degraded bedrock at depths ranging from 10–40 cmbs.
Seven shovel tests were placed within the site area, none of which contained cultural material.
Sixteen pieces of lithic debitage and a biface were recorded on the surface of 41RE158. Lithic
raw materials included blue-speckled white chert and gray and grayish brown Edwards chert.
Site 41RE158 is a small, diffuse lithic scatter with no subsurface component and is situated
on deflated and eroded terrain. Based on the above data, the site has little to no additional
research potential beyond locational data gathered during survey. No additional work at the
site is suggested at this time and 41RE158 is not recommended eligible for listing as a SAL.

5.5	Site 41RE159
Site 41RE159 is a lithic scatter situated in a fallow agricultural field that resides on an erosional
terrace overlooking the Dry Frio River (Figure 5.16). The site was located through extensive
pedestrian survey and a series of shovel tests placed along the APE next to the drainage where
ground surface visibility was moderate (25–50 percent). Surrounding vegetation consisted of
a series of hardwoods that accompanied the nearby drainage comprised of several oak species,
cottonwood and maple as well as other smaller vegetation that includes ashe juniper, prickly
pear, mesquite, and various grasses (Figure 5.17). The site measures approximately 4.53 acres
and was defined primarily by a series of ten positive shovel tests as well as sparse surficial
artifact distribution. According to the USDA-NRCS Web Soil Survey (2018), soils within the
site area consist of the Campwood-Knippa complex with zero to three percent slopes and
Pratley clay with zero to three percent slopes. Shovel tests placed within the site area revealed
very dark brown (10YR 3/3) silty clay loam overlying a very dark gray (10YR 3/1) clay or silty
clay between 20–40 cmbs, overlying bedrock at 40–60 cmbs.
The 200 x 90-m lithic scatter was identified during pedestrian survey, and subsequent shovel
testing. Ten shovel tests contained cultural material, typically between 10 and 40 cmbs (see
Appendix A). Twenty lithic flakes were recovered within the shovel tests, and several other
flakes as well as an Uvalde projectile point (Early Archaic) were documented on the surface of
41RE159 (Figure 5.18).

The site has been impacted by recent land clearance and agricultural plowing. Hence, the
shallowly buried cultural deposits is most likely reflective of previous agricultural practices at
the site. A total of twenty-four shovel tests were excavated within the site boundary. Of those,
ten tests were positive with twenty pieces of lithic debitage. Overall, artifacts were sparse and
spread out over a wide area.
Taking this paucity of artifacts, as well as lack of features or other organic dateable material, and
the artificial displacement of artifacts into account, 41RE159 has limited additional research
potential beyond the locational data that has been collected during survey and the portion of
the site located within the existing easement is recommended as ineligible as a SAL. Planned
construction should be permitted with no additional work within the existing LCRA easement.

Site 41RE160 is a diffuse lithic scatter situated on an erosional terrace on the west side of
an ephemeral drainage (Figure 5.19). The site was identified through pedestrian survey and
six shovel tests placed within the APE. Ground surface visibility within the site boundary
was moderate (25–50 percent). Site vegetation within the site included live oak, ashe juniper,
persimmon and several grass species (Figure 5.20). The site measures approximately 1.04

included brown specked and grayish brown Edwards chert.
Site 41RE160 is a diffuse, surficial lithic scatter with no subsurface component. Slope
movement and road clearing have led to a lapse in contextual of integrity of the site within
the existing LCRA easement. Therefore, portions of the site within the existing easement have
little to no additional research potential beyond the locational data gathered during the survey.
No additional work within 41RE160 is recommended at this time and it is not recommended

Site 41RE161 is a small, diffuse surficial lithic scatter situated on an eroded slope with laterally
extensive bedrock exposures (Figure 5.21). The site was identified through pedestrian survey
along the APE where ground surface visibility was excellent (90–100 percent). Site vegetation
included live oak, ashe juniper, persimmon and several grass species (Figure 5.22). The site
measures approximately 0.20 acres and was defined by surficial artifact dispersed across the
site. According to the USDA-NRCS Web Soil Survey (2018), soils within the site area consist
entirely of the Kerrville-Real complex, with one to eight percent slopes.

5.8	Site 41RE162
Site 41RE162 is a surficial lithic scatter residing on an eroding terrace (Figure 5.23). The
site was identified through pedestrian survey and eight shovel tests located within the APE.
The site is loosely attributed to the Late Archaic period based on the presence of a possible
Castroville point. Ground surface visibility within the site boundary was moderate to good
(50–75 percent). Site vegetation included Live Oak, ashe juniper, persimmon and several
grass species (Figure 5.24). The site measures 1.07 acres and was defined by surficial artifacts

Summary and Management
Recommendations
AmaTerra surveyed and tested 145 locations within the APE totaling 13.6 miles as part of the
T-269 Camp Wood to Leakey Transmission Line Upgrade Project in Real County, Texas. This
equates to approximately 266.5 acres surveyed within the existing T-269 easement. The survey
included 129 previously identified existing support structures (107 pedestrian-surveyed and
shovel-tested and 22 pedstrian-surveyed only), 13 water crossings, and three high probability
areas such as canyon heads or ridgetops identified by LCRA and AmaTerra cultural resource
personnel. A total of 3.7 miles (21 structures) located at the western end of the project area
was omitted from the survey. These areas were assessed pre-field as well as during the survey
as having extreme slope and thus a minimal chance to contain cultural resources. With the
exception of two parcels, access was available to the entire proposed project area as AmaTerra
personnel did not encounter any conditions that inhibited the survey. AmaTerra conducted the
archaeological survey under Texas Antiquities Permit No. 8396 and work conformed to the
guidelines for implementation of these regulations under 13 TAC Chapter 26.
During the survey, archaeologists excavated 268 shovel tests including 186 as a discovery
tactic on survey and an additional 82 to delineate sites and IO’s. Within the APE, archaeologists
recorded twelve previously unrecorded sites and thirteen IO’s.
All 12 sites and all 13 IO’s are associated with the prehistoric period. Site 41RE155 represents
a seasonal encampment site with two burned rock features observed on the surface and one
hearth feature recorded within a shovel test. Sites 41RE157 and 41RE166 represent two lithic
procurement sites. The nine remaining prehistoric sites (41RE156; 41RE158–165) are lithic
scatters and/or small intermittent campsites consisting of low density surface scatters of lithic
debitage and burned rock with occasional bifaces and lithic tools. Temporally diagnostic items
observed included a Montell-like projectile point, Uvalde projectile point, and a possible
Castroville projectile point.
All sites were evaluated using criteria outlined under 13 TAC 26. Eleven of the 12 sites
(41RE156–41RE166) have little to no research potential beyond locational data collected
during the survey within the existing LCRA easement. With the exception of 41RE159, each
of these sites have extremely shallow soils with negligible potential to contain intact buried
deposits. Buried deposits were present at 41RE159; however, 24 shovel tests produced only
20 pieces of lithic debitage within a secondary context. Although cultural material was present
in a subsurface context, it was a result of long-term agricultural activity along an erosional
terrace. The portions of these sites that are contained within the existing LCRA easement
were evaluated as ineligible for listing as SAL’s and no additional work is recommended.
Site 41RE155 is the lone exception and was documented as a seasonal encampment site with
dateable features as well as intact subsurface deposits.

AmaTerra Environmental, Inc.

63

An Archaeological Examination of the T-269 Camp Wood
to Leakey Transmission Line Upgrade Project, Real County, Texas

Investigators concluded the portions of 41RE155 within the existing easement have significant
intact deposits that may make it eligible for listing as a SAL, and, therefore, should be avoided.
However, subsurface artifact density was sparse in direct proximity (within two meters) of
the structure footprint where pole removal and/or replacement will take place. Therefore,
AmaTerra recommends construction to proceed within the structure footprint as long as access
is restricted to the existing two-track access road and the eastern edge of the site boundary.
Archaeologists collected no artifacts during this survey. All field forms and site records will be
