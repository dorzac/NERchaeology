ABSTRACT
Harris County is planning to widen a one-mile long segment of Hufsmith Road in
Harris County, Texas. For the most part, the road will be widened by eight feet on
each side of the existing 20-ft-wide road. The major bend in this portion of the
road will be altered more drastically and the new road will cross land previously
not part of the road. Halff Associates, Inc. is handling the environmental
permitting for the project and they contracted with AR Consultants, Inc. to
conduct a survey of the 1.25-acre area for the realignment. The area was
considered low potential for prehistoric sites, but was considered high for historic
materials since early maps and aerials demonstrated a homestead on the property
since the mid-20th century. The survey was conducted on December 11, 2017 with
the excavation of three shovel tests. All were negative. Outside the survey area is
an occupied historic homestead with auxiliary buildings. None of them will be
impacted and it was not recorded as site since it completely fell outside the survey
area. The purpose of this investigation was to determine if significant cultural
resources are present in the proposed Hufsmith Road Expansion project area. No
cultural resources were identified in or below the surface in the survey area.
Based on the results of the survey, ARC concludes that further cultural resource
investigations for this project are unwarranted, and requests that the THC concur
with this recommendation. However, if buried cultural materials are discovered
during construction, the Archeology Division of the THC should be notified.

INTRODUCTION
Harris County is planning to widen a one-mile long segment of Hufsmith Road in Harris County,
Texas (Figure 1). For the most part, the road will be widened by eight feet on each side of the
existing 20-ft-wide road. The major bend in this portion of the road will be altered more
drastically and the new road will cross land previously not part of the road (Figure 1). In June
2017, Halff Associates, Inc. (Halff), which is handling the environmental permitting for the
project, contracted with AR Consultants, Inc. (ARC) to conduct an evaluation of the project.
ARC concluded that the only portion of the road that required cultural resource survey was the
new curve. The Texas Historical Commission (THC) concurred with this assessment on
November 29, 2017 when Texas Antiquities Permit (TAP) was issued. Subsequently, Halff then
contracted ARC to conduct an archaeological survey of the proposed new road portion.
The cultural resource investigation was required because Harris County is a political entity of the
state of Texas, therefore the Texas Antiquities Code (Texas Natural Resource Code, Title 9,
Chapter 191) applies to this investigation and TAP Number 8239 was issued for the
archaeological survey. Fieldwork was conducted on December 6, 2017. This report was prepared
to be reviewed by the Archeology Division of the THC. Relevant federal legislation includes the
National Historic Preservation Act of 1966, as amended (PL-96-515), the National
Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (PL-90-190), the Archeological and Historical Preservation
Act of 1974, as amended (PL-93-291), Executive Order No. 11593 “Protection and Enhancement
of the Cultural Environment,” and Protection of Historic Properties (36 CFR 800).
This report is written in accordance with report guidelines used by the Archeology Division of
the THC (Council of Texas Archeologists n.d.). The following report presents a brief description
of the natural setting of the project area, followed by a discussion of the culture history and
previous investigations within the study area. A chapter on the research design and methodology
employed in the investigation is then followed by the results of the field investigation. The report
concludes with recommendations followed by the references cited.

ARCHAEOLOGICAL SURVEY OF HUFSMITH ROAD EXPANSION

NATURAL ENVIRONMENT
The project area is in north Harris County within the Flatwoods ecoregion (Griffith et al. 2007).
This province, which lies within the South Central Plains or “piney woods,” is almost completely
level but rises gently in elevation from the Gulf Coast towards the interior of the state. This level
ground is broken by pimple mounds and hummocks that dot the landscape (Griffith et al.
2007:92). This portion of Hufsmith Road is in the broad uplands between Spring and Willow
creeks, which converge approximately 4.5 miles (mi) east of the project area. Though stock
ponds and wetlands dot the landscape immediately outside the project area, the survey area does
not cross any mapped drainages.
The survey area is mapped on the Pleistocene-aged Lissie Formation, which consists of an upper
part of clay, silt, and sand with small siliceous gravel and a similar lower part with coarser gravel
(Bureau of Economic Geology 1992). The survey area is mapped on the Segno fine sandy loam
with 0-1 percent slopes (Wheeler 1976:Sheet 3). The A horizons is generally 13 inches thick and
dark grayish-brown and pale brown fine sandy loam that rests atop yellowish brown sandy clay
loam subsoil (Wheeler 1976:56-57).

CULTURAL HISTORY
The project area is located in the southwestern portion of the Southeast Texas archaeological
region, as defined by Perttula (2004:7). A prehistoric chronology, based on Ricklis (2004) is
presented below to provide a temporal framework for the culture history of the Southeast Texas
region as contained in this section of the report.
Table 1. Cultural Chronology
Period
Dates
Historic
A.D. 1750 to present
Ceramic
A.D. 400 to A.D. 1750
Late Ceramic
A.D. 800 to A.D. 1750
Early Ceramic
A.D. 400 to A.D. 800
Archaic
6000 B.C. to A.D. 400
Late Archaic
1000 B.C. to A.D. 400
Middle Archaic
5000 B.C. to 1000 B.C.
Early Archaic
6000 B.C. to 5000 B.C.
Paleoindian
9500 B.C. to 6000 B.C.
The earliest widely-accepted human occupation in Texas began in the Paleoindian period (9500
B.C. to 6000 B.C.), a period characterized in part by small, mobile bands of hunters that utilized
distinctive fluted Clovis projectile points. Currently nine such points have been reported from
Harris County (Bever and Meltzer 2007:68). In addition to Clovis points, Folsom, Midland,
Dalton, San Patrice, Plainview, Scottsbluff, and Angostura points have been recovered from sites
in Southeast Texas and Harris County (Patterson 1995:251). Plant foods and small game likely
supplemented the Paleoindian diet (Patterson 1995; Ricklis 2004:184). Generally, inland
Paleoindian sites are located along major drainages. Due to an absence of well-stratified or single
component sites, the Paleoindian period is poorly defined in Southeast Texas, though it seems
clear that there was widespread movement of people and material goods based on the recovery of
points made out of lithic material that is not native to southeast Texas.
The transition to the Archaic period (6000 B.C. to A.D. 400) followed the demise of Pleistocene
megafauna and a shift to a more xeric climate at the onset of the Holocene. Subsistence,
settlement patterns, and stone tool technology shifted as populations began to focus more on
local resources. This increased reliance on local resources suggests decreased group mobility,
and conceivably, more tightly defined group territories (Story 1985:44-47). The appearance of
group cemeteries during the Archaic has been interpreted as an expression of territoriality and
group identity. As with the Paleoindian period, the Early and Middle Archaic periods are poorly
known archaeologically but there is substantial evidence of seasonal scheduling at Late Archaic
sites in southeastern Texas (Ricklis 2004:187-188). This adaptation coincided with a general
growth in population toward the end of the Late Archaic.
The appearance of ceramics in the Galveston Bay area as early as A.D. 400 preceded the
adoption of ceramics throughout most of Southeast Texas around A.D. 500 (Perttula et al. 1995).
Goose Creek Plain, Punctated, and Incised are sand-tempered pottery types commonly found
during the Early Ceramic period, and several other types of decorated varieties and tempering

materials have been identified (Patterson 1995; Perttula et al. 1995). Caddoan pottery from East
Texas is found during the period between A.D. 1000 and A.D. 1300 and may be a sign of extraregional trade or migration (Aten 1983). The bow and arrow appeared during the Ceramic period
and undoubtedly had some impact upon hunting strategies. In terms of subsistence strategies, the
innovations of the Ceramic period appear to have served to increase efficiency of food
production, but did little to alter major lifeways (Ricklis 2004:189).
Contact between Native Americans and early explorers may have begun as early as 1529, when
Álvar Núñez Cabeza de Vaca traveled up the San Jacinto River to trade with the natives (Henson
2017). Though various French and Spanish traders may have passed through what is now Harris
County, none settled there. In 1824, some settlers moved to the San Jacinto estuary, falsely
assuming it was part of Stephen F. Austin’s empresario grant. Two years later John R. Harris
established Harrisburg on Buffalo Bayou and opened a store and saw and grist mill. Soon after,
the area became a hub of land and water transportation. As the area became more heavily
explored, and tentative settlement began, European diseases began to have an impact on the
health of the Native Americans. Ultimately, disease and other privations resulting from European
incursion reduced or eliminated the indigenous populations (Ewers 1973).
In 1839, Harris County, as it is designated today, was formed. The population continued to grow
in the mid-1800s because of the transportation industry (railroads, water routes, and roads)
spurred by the cotton and sugar industries that were thriving in Texas (Henson 2017). Hufsmith,
the closest town, was founded in 1872 as a railroad station stop (Kleiner 2010). The earliest
residents were African-Americans, many of whom were freed slaves now cotton and potato
farmers. The population of Hufsmith reached its zenith in the 1940s and it had maintained
approximately 250 residents ever since.
Previous Investigations
A search of TASA (2017) revealed no National Register of Historic Places (NRHP) properties or
State Antiquities Landmarks (SALs) within a mile of the project area. The Zion Lutheran
Cemetery, 0.4 miles northwest of the survey area, and its associated historical marker are the
only landmarks of their kind found within a mile of the survey area.
Three previous cultural resources surveys have been conducted within a mile of the project area,
all on the north side of Hufsmith Road. These surveys resulted in four archaeological sites being
recorded within a mile of the project area. In 1990, Moore Archaeological Consulting surveyed
the Burroughs Park Tract 0.45 miles west of the survey area (TASA 2017). This tract stretched
from Hufsmith Road north to Spring Creek. Prehistoric site 41HR625 is located on the creek’s
southern bluff and was recommended as an SAL.
In 2010 and 2012, Horizon Engineering Services conducted two surveys for the Woodlands
Development Company immediately north of the current survey area. The 2010 survey did not
record any sites, but the 2012 survey recorded three prehistoric sites within a mile of the current
project area. Sites 41HR1088 and 41HR1091 are located on the same bluff as site 41HR625,
while site 41HR1090 was located on a hill at the edge of the uplands approximately 0.4 mi
northwest of the study area. Horizon recommended further work at all three sites to help make
recommendations regarding eligibility for the NRHP and as SALs.

In 2001, James Abbott, a Texas Department of Transportation (TxDOT) archaeologist, put
together a Potential Archeological Liability Map (PALM) for the Houston area. The PALM is
the result of a GIS-based predictive model of the apparent geoarchaeological potential
throughout the Houston-area highway district. According to the PALM data, most of the project
area lies within Map Unit 4 (Abbott 2001:Figure 66). Abbott recommends that areas mapped as
this unit warrant no survey for prehistoric cultural resources due to the lack of Holocene deposits
and the presence of man-made land (2001:156). The sites recorded by Horizon fall in Map Unit
2, which has much higher potential.
Historic Map & Aerial Review
The 1922 USDA Harris County Soil Map, 1936 and 1957 Harris County General Highway maps
(GHMs), and 1962 (photorevised 1979) Oklahoma, TX 15’ USGS topographic map were
reviewed as part of this evaluation. The 1922 Soil Map shows a structure northwest of the bend
in the road. Though low resolution, an aerial photograph from 1944 confirms at least one
structure at this location. The GHMs are drawn at a county-wide and relatively inaccurate scale,
but the 1936 and 1957 GHMs both show a structure at the same location. By 1962, the
topographic map shows a residence and an outbuilding there. The 1979 photorevision adds two
buildings to the location, and 1978 aerials match that information. Some trees had grown up
around the structures by the 1980s (according to aerial photographs), but at least three of them
are visible and possibly still inhabited.

RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODOLOGY
Research Design
Based on the research conducted prior to survey, two hypotheses were developed. First, it was
hypothesized that there was low potential for encountering prehistoric sites, given the project
area’s setting and distance to water in the uplands. The survey and site data reviewed do not
show many sites being found in this area. Prehistoric sites in this region are typically located
directly adjacent to significant drainages, which would allow for access to water and food
resources. Therefore, there is very limited potential for encountering temporary-use sites in this
specific setting. These would likely be ephemeral and exposed on the degrading surface.
Additionally, prehistoric sites recorded in this setting are typically not well preserved due to the
degrading environment and fact that the area has been developed since the mid-1800s.
The second hypothesis stated that there was potential for encountering historic sites within the
project area. Structures are shown on historic maps and aerials just outside the survey area.
While these demonstrate that the mapped structures are not likely to be found within the survey
area, historic trash scatters and features such as foundations, cisterns, or wells might be present.
Methodology
Survey was conducted in accordance with the standards set forth by the THC (n.d.). Field
personnel walked a transect along the centerline of the survey area. Shovel tests were placed
where ground visibility was less than 30-percent and the ground surface was not heavily
disturbed. Shovel tests averaged 30 cm in diameter. Sandy loam from the shovel tests was
screened through ¼-inch mesh hardware cloth. When clay fill was encountered, it was inspected
visually and broken into smaller chunks in order to determine if cultural materials were present.
Shovel test matrices were described on the basis of composition, texture, and color. The Munsell
Soil Color Chart (2010) was used to identify soil colors. The authors made notes about the
ground exposure, drainages, soil types, and disturbed areas where subsoil was exposed.
Photographs were taken during the survey using a 16-megapixel, digital camera. Shovel test and
project boundary locations were marked with a handheld Garmin GPS.

RESULTS
This chapter is divided into two sections. The first describes the project area’s natural setting
along with results of the pedestrian survey. Shovel tests are described generally throughout the
text, but are detailed in Table 1. Conclusions end the chapter.
The centerline of the new alignment for Hufsmith Road cuts through the front yard of a historic
homestead. The yard is well maintained with very short grasses; however, it was very thick
leaving no ground surface visibility (Figure 2). Throughout the yard were large pecans and pine
trees. The historic homestead is occupied by the owner Billie Sims Carpenter. Her house and
associated structures are all outside the survey area and therefore were not recorded as an
archaeological site (Figure 3). Approximately 10 m outside the survey corridor, on the north
side, is the corner of a foundation associated with a small shed (Figure 4). The homestead
consists of a house, large barn, and the small shed and foundation. Three shovel tests were
excavated, and all were negative for cultural materials (Figure 5). Profiles were similar in all the
shovel tests, which contained dark grayish brown sandy loam on top of mottled sandy loam and
sandy clay between 40 and 60 centimeters below the surface. The historic homestead will not be
impacted by the project. Discussions with Carpenter demonstrated that the home and auxiliary
structures were likely built in the 1930s or 1940s by R. A. Martens, the previous landowner.
Carpenter and her husband purchased the property in 1983 from Martens (Carpenter, personal
communication 2017). Records at the Harris County Courthouse confirm her information (Deed
Record 042981514). It is unclear when Martens might have purchased the property, but deed
records show he owned a significant number of properties all dating to the 1930s and 1940s.

Conclusions
Beyond the historic homestead outside the survey corridor, no other cultural resources were
found during the survey of the Hufsmith Road Expansion project. In terms of prehistoric
resources, no evidence of occupation was found which was not unexpected given the location in
the uplands and distance from any drainages. The historic homestead is occupied and was not
recorded as a site since it falls completely outside of the survey area. No artifacts were recovered
in shovel tests or on the surface within the survey area. ARC concludes that the site will not be
impacted.

RECOMMENDATIONS
The purpose of this investigation was to determine if significant cultural resources are present in
the proposed Hufsmith Road Expansion project area in Harris County, Texas. No cultural
resources were identified in or below the surface in the survey area. Based on the results of the
survey, ARC concludes that further cultural resource investigations for this project are
unwarranted, and requests that the THC concur with this recommendation. However, if buried
cultural materials are discovered during construction, the Archeology Division of the THC
should be notified.
