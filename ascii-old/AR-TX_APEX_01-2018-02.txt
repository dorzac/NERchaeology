ABSTRACT
ONE Gas, Inc./Texas Gas Service (One Gas) is proposing to construct and operate the
approximately 1.75-mile of natural gas pipeline along the southeast side of South Mopac
Expressway (Loop 1) in Travis County, Texas, hereafter referred to as the proposed Project. The
proposed Project occurs to the southwest of the city of Austin, approximately 1 mile from the
Travis-Hays County line. The southwestern terminus of the proposed Project occurs 200 feet
south of the intersection of TX-45 and Archeleta Boulevard and the northeastern terminus at the
intersection of South Mopac Expressway and La Crosse Avenue. This proposed Project may
require permitting through the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) Section 404 of the Clean
Water Act (Section 404). The proposed Project is located on Texas Department of Transportation
(TxDOT) right-of-way (ROW) and will be regulated under the Antiquities Code of Texas (TAC). The
Texas Historical Commission (THC) reviewed the scope-of-work and assigned TAC Permit No.
8322 to portions of the Loop 1 1.75-mile natural gas pipeline project that had not been previously
surveyed; hereafter referred to as the Area of Potential Effect (APE) for the cultural resources
investigation (Apex Project No. 453371). The northern 0.20 mile and southern 0.74 mile of the
proposed Project were previously surveyed resulting in the documentation of one very large
prehistoric lithic procurement site (41TV1540) at the intersection of Loop 1 and SH 45. Locational
data of the proposed Project and APE is presented in Attachment A, Figures 1 and 2 on aerial
and topographic maps, respectively.
On February 9, 2017, Apex Companies, LLC (Apex), at the request of Texas Gas Service (TGS,
a subsidiary of ONE Gas, Inc.), conducted an intensive non-collection cultural resources survey
of the APE. The northern boundary of the APE is located approximately 0.20 mile south of the
intersection of northbound Loop 1 and La Crosse Avenue and the southern boundary is located
approximately 854 feet south of South Bay Lane for a total length of approximately 0.81 mile; it
extends east of Loop 1 approximately 130 feet for a total of 12.45 acres.
The 100% pedestrian survey of the APE, augmented with strategically placed shovel tests, was
positive for prehistoric cultural resources. Five prehistoric procurement sites (41TV2548,
41TV2549, 41TV2550, 41TV2551, and 41TV2552) were documented across the APE. The
assemblages include natural chert cobbles with a small number of tested cobbles and cores along
with a few primary flakes and utilized flakes and chunks. Due to the limestone bedrock at or near
the surface, a limited number of shovel tests were excavated, and all were negative for cultural
resources.
Due to the surficial nature of the sites and lack of features, concentrations, clusters or diagnostic
cultural material, sites 41TV2548 through 41TV2552 are recommended as ineligible for listing as
State Antiquities Landmarks (SALs) or inclusion in the National Register of Historic Places (NRHP).
Apex recommends that the proposed Project proceed without further cultural resources
investigation as the proposed Project would have no effect on cultural resources with the potential
for listing as SALs or inclusion in the NRHP.

MANAGEMENT SUMMARY

PROJECT TITLE: Cultural Resources Survey of Portions of the Proposed 1.75-Mile Natural Gas
Pipeline located east of South Mopac Expressway (Loop 1), Austin, Travis County, Texas.
PROJECT DESCRIPTION: TGS is proposing to construct and operate approximately 1.75 mile
of natural gas pipeline along the east side of South Mopac Expressway in Travis County, Texas,
hereafter referred to as the proposed Project (Attachment A, Figure 1). The northern 0.20 mile
and southern 0.74 mile of the proposed Project has been previously surveyed; therefore, the APE
for the cultural resources survey consists of the remaining 0.81 mile located on TxDOT ROW
between northbound Loop 1 and private property.
PROJECT LOCATION: The proposed Project occurs to the southwest of the city of Austin,
approximately 1 mile from the Travis-Hays County line. The northeastern terminus of the
proposed Project occurs just southeast of the intersection of the northbound Loop 1 and La
Crosse Avenue and the southwestern terminus occurs approximately 200 feet south of the
intersection of TX-45 and Archeleta Boulevard.
DATE OF WORK: February 9, 2018
PURPOSE OF WORK: Apex assisted TGS in their due diligence under Section 106 of the
National Historic Preservation Act (NHPA) and the Texas Antiquities code TAC).
PRINCIPLAL INVESTIGATOR: Debra L. Beene
NEWLY RECORDED SITES: 41TV2548 through 41TV2552
PREVIOUSLY RECORDED SITES: none within the APE
COMMENTS: The pedestrian survey of the APE, augmented with strategically placed shovel
tests, was positive for cultural resources. Prehistoric sites 41TV2548, 41TV2549, 41TV2550,
41TV2551, and 41TV2552 were documented across the APE. The assemblages include raw chert
cobbles with a limited number of tested cobbles and cores along with a few primary flakes and
utilized flakes and chunks. Due to the expanse of limestone bedrock at or near the surface, a
limited number of shovel tests were excavated; all were negative for cultural resources.
Due to the surficial nature and lack of features, concentrations, clusters or diagnostic cultural
material, sites 41TV2548 through 41TV2552 are recommended as ineligible for listing as SALs or
inclusion in the NRHP. Apex recommends that the proposed Project proceed without further
cultural resources investigation as the proposed Project would have no effect on cultural resources
with the potential for listing as SALs or inclusion in the NRHP.

INTRODUCTION

This report details the results of the intensive cultural resources survey, augmented with shovel
tests, of the APE located along the east side of Loop 1 located in southwest Austin, Travis County,
Texas (Project No: 453371). The northeastern terminus of the proposed Project occurs just
southeast of the intersection of northbound Loop 1 and La Crosse Avenue and the southwestern
terminus occurs 200 feet south of the intersection of TX-45 and Archeleta Boulevard. Locational
maps of the proposed Project and survey boundary (APE) are presented in Attachment A,
Figures 1 and 2 on aerial and topographic maps, respectively. See Attachment A, Figure 3 for
the survey boundary (APE) and locations of the newly recorded prehistoric sites. Attachment A,
Figures 4A/4B provide a closeup view of sites 41TV2548, 41TV2549, and 41TV2550, along with
the locations of shovel tests, karst features, and isolated finds on aerial and topographic maps,
respectively. Attachment A, Figures 5A/5B provide a closeup view of sites 41TV2551 and
41TV2552, along with the locations of shovel test, karst features, and isolated finds on aerial and
topographic maps, respectively
This work was completed in support of TGSâs proposed new natural gas pipeline located within
the TxDOT ROW on the east side of northbound Loop 1 from La Crosse Boulevard south to 200
feet south of the intersection of TX-45 and Archeleta Boulevard. The northern 0.20 mile and
southern 0.74 mile of the proposed Project were previously surveyed; however, approximately 0.81
mile, located between the previously surveyed areas, had not been surveyed. Based on topographic
relief and the results of previous investigations in similar settings to the proposed project, the APE
was identified from approximately 0.20 mile south of the intersection of Loop 1 and La Crosse
Boulevard, continuing south for approximately 0.81 mile.
Because the proposed Project will occur on public TxDOT ROW, the project is subject to the
Texas Antiquities Code. Section 106 of the National Historic Preservation Act of 1966 (NHPA)
requires federal agencies, agencies, including the USACE, to take into account the effects of their
undertakings on historic properties. The USACEâs implementation of this rule is acknowledged in
General Condition 20 of NWP 12. Projects utilizing federal funds, located on federal land, and/or
requiring permits, license, or permission from a federal agency must comply with Section 106.
This proposed Project may require permitting through the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE)
Section 404 of the Clean Water Act (Section 404).
On behalf of TGS, Apex conducted an intensive non-collection cultural resource survey of the
APE, 0.81 mile of the larger 1.75-mile new natural gas pipeline, located east of Loop 1. The
cultural resources investigation was conducted to identify archeological and historical resources
within the proposed APE. The survey methodology followed the Survey Standards of Texas
developed by the Council of Texas Archeologists (CTA) (1987) and THC (n.d.).

ENVIRONMENTAL SETTING

The proposed Project is located in the Central Texas archeological region in southwestern Travis
County. Austin lies mostly within the Blackland Prairie division of the Gulf Coastal physiographic
zone and the Plains Grassland vegetation habitat (Perttula 2004). Topography, hydrology,
vegetation, and soils within the proposed Project are briefly summarized below.
Topography
The topography of the proposed Project is fairly level in the southern extent and rolling hill in the
northern extent (Attachment A, Figure 2) with drops in elevation near the minor tributaries.
Elevation of the proposed Project ranges from 802 feet above mean sea level (msl) at the
tributaries to 844 feet above msl near the proposed Projectâs northwestern terminus (Attachment
A, Figure 2). The APE consists of the lower edges of the slightly sloping to level upland terraces
with drops in elevation between terraces.
Hydrology
The proposed Project is located in the Slaughter Creek-Onion Creek (120902050407) watershed
(HUC 12), which is located within the Austin-Travis Lake (12090205) HUC 8 watershed (EPA
2018). Apex biologist reviewed aerial imagery, United States Geological Survey (USGS)
topographic maps, USGS National Hydrography Data (NHD), and the National Wetlands
Inventory (NWI) database (2018a) and noted that there are four USGS blue-line streams and one
non-blue-line stream intersected by the proposed Project.
Vegetation
The proposed Project is located within the Live Oak-Ashe Juniper Woods (27) and Live Oak-Ashe
Juniper Parks (26a) vegetation types according to McMahan et al. (1984). Woods are defined as
areas with woody plants mostly nine to 30 feet tall with closed crowns or nearly so and a midstory that is usually lacking. Parks are defined as areas with woody plants equal to or greater
than nine feet tall growing in clusters or as scattered individuals within continuous grass or forbs.
Typical vegetation of the Live Oak-Ashe Juniper Woods (27) type consists of live oak (Quercus
virginiana), Ashe juniper (Juniperus ashei),Texas oak (Quercus texana), shin oak (Quercus
sinuata var. breviloba), cedar elm (Ulmus crassifolia), evergreen sumac (Rhus virens),
escarpment cherry (Prunus serotina var. eximia), saw greenbrier (Smilax bona-nox), mescal bean
(Sophora secundiflora), poison oak (Toxicodendron radicans), twistleaf yucca (Yucca rupicola),
elbowbush (Forestiera pubescens var. pubescens), cedar sedge (Carex planostachys), little
bluestem (Schizachyrium scoparium), oneflower grama (Bouteloua uniflora), Texas grama
(Bouteloua rigidiseta), meadow dropseed (Sporobolus compositus var. drummondii), Texas
wintergrass (Nassella leucotricha), curly mesquite (Hilaria belangeri), pellitory (Parietaria
pensylvanica), noseburn (Tragia ramosa), spreading sida (Sida abutifolia), woodsorrel (Oxalis
spp.), and mat euphorbia (Chamaesyce serpens).
Typical vegetation of the Live Oak-Ashe Juniper Parks (26a) type consists live oak, Ashe juniper,

cedar elm, hackberry (Celtis spp.), flameleaf sumac (Rhus lanceolata), Texas pricklypear
(Opuntia engelmannii), kidneywood (Eysenhardtia texana), honey mesquite (Prosopis
glandulosa), Texas persimmon (Diospyros texana), pricklypear cactus (Opuntia sp.), agarita
(Mahonia trifoliolata), rabbit tobacco (Evax prolifera), saw greenbrier (Smilax bona-nox), purple
threeawn (Aristida purpurea), Halls Panicum (Panicum hallii var. hallii), hairy tridens (Erioneuron
pilosum), two leaved senna (Senna roemeriana) and mat euphorbia.
Review of aerial imagery indicates that outside of areas disturbed by maintenance of the
Expressway and utility line ROWs, vegetation intersected by the proposed Project is somewhat
consistent with Live Oak-Ashe Juniper designation.
Soils
One soil unit is intersected by the proposed Project alignment. Table 1 lists the soil unit within the
50-foot corridor along the proposed Project (NRCS 2016). Although limestone bedrock can be
expected between 12 and 20 inches below the surface., numerous prehistoric sites have been
recorded on similar landforms as those within the APE identified for the cultural resources survey.

CULTURAL BACKGROUND AND PREVIOUS INVESTIGATIONS

The traditional cultural sequence of central Texas includes the Paleoindian period (11,500 to 8800
BP) followed by the Early (8800 to 6000 BP), Middle (6000 to 4000 BP), and Late (4000 to 1300
or 1200 BP) Archaic periods; the latter Late Prehistoric period (approximately 1200 to around 250
BP) is followed by the Historic period (250 BP into the mid-to late 19th century) (Collins 2004).
These temporal divisions are reflected in changes in technologies and subsistence adaptations.
Archeological site types range from lithic scatters and isolated heaths to open camps, burned rock
middens, hearth fields, lithic procurement/quarries, rockshelters and cemeteries. Within the
general area of the proposed Project, most of the prehistoric sites are open camps situated on
alluvial terraces near streams or rivers. The cultural assemblages may include fire cracked rock
(FCR), lithic debitage, lithic tools (hammerstones, unifaces, bifaces, diagnostic projectile points),
ground stones, and ceramic sherds. Historic site types range from Mexican period ranchos, early
Anglo farmsteads and settlements to the Camino Real de los Tejas, a network of roads linking
outposts and supply towns. Most of the historic sites, within the general area of the proposed
Project, are homesteads and tenant farms dating to the late 19th century.
A search of the restricted use online Texas Archeological Sites Atlas (ATLAS), maintained by the
THC and the Texas Archeological Research Laboratory (TARL), was conducted to identify any
known cultural resource sites (including cemeteries) and previous investigations conducted within
0.5 mile of the proposed Project. Numerous cultural resources sites have been recorded and
several surveys have taken place within this study boundary (ATLAS 2018).
The survey of the proposed Loop 1 (Mopac Expressway) from US 290 to the proposed Project
was conducted by TxDOT in 1987. The northern 0.20 mile of the proposed Project was included
in this survey which was negative for cultural resources within the current study area.
The Lady Bird Wildflower Center was surveyed by Prewitt & Associates, Inc. in 2001; three sites
were recorded (ATLAS 2018). Site 41TV1935, a cave, is located on the north slope of a Slaughter
Creek tributary. The cultural assemblage included a Marcos dart point, lithic debitage, and a deer
tooth; the site was determined to have potential for human remains/burials (ATLAS 2018). It is
located approximately 0.17-mile east of the proposed Project and would not be impacted. Site
41TV1933, a lithic procurement site, is located on an interfluve between two tributary streams of
Slaughter Creek. The cultural assemblage included non-diagnostic lithic tools and debitage
(ATLAS 2018). The site is located approximately 0.26-mile east southeast of the proposed Project
and would not be impacted. Site 41TV1934, a lithic procurement site, is located on an interfluve
between two Slaughter Creek tributaries. The cultural assemblage included non-diagnostic lithic
tools and debitage (ATLAS 2018). The site is located approximately 0.57-mile east of the
proposed Project and would not be impacted
In 1990, a survey for the City of Austin Parks and Recreation Department was carried out by the
Texas Archeological Research Laboratory, the University of Texas at Austin at the proposed
Veloway Park (ATLAS 2018). Dr. Solveig A. Turpin acted as Principal Investigator under Texas

Antiquities Code (TAC) Permit Number 871. Seven prehistoric sites (41TV1541, 1542, 1543,
1544, 1545, and 1546), recorded within or adjacent to the study area, consist of lithic scatters,
lithic procurement areas, and open camps. The assemblages included lithic cores, debitage,
tested cobbles, fire cracked rock, a Marshall dart point base, and a Bulverde dart point (ATLAS
2018). These sites are located between 0.29- and 0.65-mile east of and 0.49-mile northwest of
the proposed Project and would not be impacted. Follow-up work at site 41TV1546 included
eligibility testing.
Site 41TV2539, the Historic Circle C Ranch Headquarters site, was surveyed in 2017 Permit No.
8001. It is a large, complex site; the cultural assemblage is represented by structural remains and
features (ATLAS 2018). The property was known as the Barker Ranch from 1895-1937 and was
likely the ranch headquarters for the Eugene Howard Ranch from 1937-1946. It later became the
headquarters for the Covert Circle C Ranch from 1946-1973. The ranch was owned by Polly
Covert (Blanton), a prominent female rancher. The houses and structures at the site are still
occupied and in use today (ATLAS 2018). It is located approximately 0.60-mile northeast of the
proposed Project and would not be impacted.
The southern 0.74-mile of the proposed Project was surveyed for TxDOT in 2014. Site 41TV1540,
a lithic scatter and procurement site, encompasses much of the survey area and extends beyond
its boundaries; it measures approximately 0.71-mile east/west by 0.36-mile north/south. The
assemblage includes large primary and secondary hard hammer flakes, tested cobbles, and
occasional early stage bifaces (ATLAS 2018). It has been recommended ineligible for inclusion
in the NRHP and for listing as a SAL. No further assessments are warranted. The above site,
41TV1540, and 41TV2188 were investigated during a narrow linear TxDOT survey conducted in
1989. 41TV2188 is a lithic reduction site located approximately 0.68 mile west of the proposed
Project; the lithics are widely scattered, diffuse, and scattered across a 5-acre substation site
(ATLAS 2018). The sites will not be impacted by the proposed Project.
Two additional linear surveys were carried out immediately southwest of the proposed Project.
The surveys were conducted under TAC Permit Numbers 3146 and 4013 in 2003 and 2006,
respectively (ATLAS 2018). Both investigations were negative for cultural resources within 0.50
mile of the proposed Project.

METHODOLOGY

Prior to the field investigation, the THCâs ATLAS database (ATLAS) and the Texas State
Library and Archives Commissionâs (TSL) historical county maps (TSHD 1940 and 1961)
were reviewed to identify significant cultural resources.
The northern 0.20 mile and southern 0.74 mile of the proposed Project has been previously
surveyed; however, the remaining 0.81 mile had not been surveyed and was identified as having
a moderate to high probability for containing intact prehistoric cultural resources. The fieldwork
was restricted to the 0.81 mile of the proposed Project that has not been previously surveyed and
represents the APE for cultural resources.
An intensive pedestrian survey, supplemented with shovel tests, was carried out within the APE.
The current field investigation was designed to comply with appropriate archeological field
methods as defined in the Department of the Interior's Standards and Guidelines (NPS 1983), the
Guidelines of the CTA (1987), and the survey standards developed by the THC (n.d.) in
conjunction with the CTA. The primary intent of the survey is to identify and describe all
archeological and historical resources discovered within the APE, evaluate their eligibility for
inclusion in the NRHP and listing as SALs. If eligible cultural resources are located,
recommendations for future management options, such as avoidance and preservation or further
investigations, will be presented. No cultural materials will be collected; however, any newly
discovered materials will be professionally photographed and illustrated in detail.
A draft technical report will be prepared; it will meet the standards for cultural resource reports
adopted by the THC and the CTA. The report will briefly describe the natural and cultural history
of the project area, discuss the methodology and results of the survey, and conclude with
recommendations about site NRHP eligibility (if applicable) and whether further archeological
work should be conducted in the project area. The draft report will be submitted to the THC for
review. Any concerns will be addressed, and final reports will be provided to the THC and Texas
State Library, as required. Project records will be curated at the Texas Archeological Research
Laboratory (TARL).

RESULTS

The 0.81-mile APE was identified for an intensive pedestrian survey supplemented with shovel
tests, as needed. The remainder of the proposed Project had been previously surveyed. See
Appendix A, Figure 3 for the survey boundary or APE, and the locations of the five newly
recorded archeological sites. Closeup views of sites 41TV2548, 41TV2549, 41TV2550,
41TV2551, and 41TV2552, along with the location of shovel tests, karst features, and isolated
finds, are presented in Appendix A, Figures 4 A/B and 5 A/B on aerial and topographic maps.
The APE was surveyed using the proposed Project alignment provided by TGS; the width of the
survey corridor measured between 80 and 130 feet. Due to limestone bedrock at or near the
surface and construction impacts, a limited number of shovel tests were excavated, and all were
negative for cultural resources. Four shovel tests (Shovel Tests 1-4) were excavated within the
area of sites 41TV2548, 41TV2549, and 41TV2550 (see Appendix A, Figures 4 and 5 for shovel
test locations and Table 2 for shovel tests results). The soils were generally shallow and rocky
consisting of Speck stony clay loam soil. The western 36 to 62 feet of the APE consists of artificial
earthen downslopes from the eastern edge of Loop 1 into the project area; the steep to moderate
slope is cleared and maintained. An approximate 20-foot-wide electric corridor parallels this
cleared area in the northern three quarters of the APE. The eastern half of the corridor consists
mainly of an open canopy of cedar, cedar elm, and live oak trees along with yaupon, agarita,
prickly pear, twist leaf yucca, smilax, tasajillo., and minimal short grasses.
The survey was initiated at the southern terminus of the APE, the surface below the cleared Loop
1 berm consists of abundant exposures of limestone bedrock and gravels and two ATV or twotrack trails entering from the east. Prehistoric site 41TV2548 (Site 1) is a lithic procurement site;
it was recorded near the southern edge of a slope overlooking two tributaries of Slaughter Creek,
which are no longer visible in the area of Loop 1. The northern boundary is located approximately
587 feet south southeast of the intersection of Loop 1 and South Bay Lane and approximately 82
feet east of the eastern edge of northbound Loop 1. Within the APE, the site measures
approximately 150 feet N/S by 48 feet E/S and extends at least 53 feet east of the APE. Adjacent
to the site and approximately 48 feet east of the APE, a limestone karst was observed; see
photograph in Appendix B (B-1). Two shovel tests (STs 1 and 2) were excavated in rocky clay
loam; limestone bedrock was encountered between 11 and 17 inches below the surface (bs).
Natural chert cobbles were observed in the upper 1-2 inches of ST 1 and two small chert cores
and decomposed limestone were observed in the upper 1-2 inches of ST 2. Lots of broken up
limestone bedrock was observed on the surface. Abundant natural chert cobbles, two chert
chunks with edge wear, at least 10 large reduced cobbles, one large utilized flake, and several
tested cobbles were observed across the site area. No diagnostic artifacts, features, or
concentrations were observed during the investigation. See Appendix A, Figures 4A/4B for the
site boundary and Appendix B (B-2 through B-10) for associated photographs.
Prehistoric site 41TV2549 (Site 2) is a lithic procurement site; it is located on the southern and
eastern edge of an eastward sloping terrace approximately 0.78 mile west of the confluence of

two Slaughter Creek tributaries. The site center is located approximately 175 feet northeast of the
intersection of Loop 1 and South Bay Lane and approximately 80 feet east of the eastern edge of
northbound Loop 1. Within the APE, the site measures approximately 30 feet N/S by 14 feet E/S
and extends at least 75 feet southeast of the APE. Limestone bedrock was exposed at the surface
and shovel testing was not warranted. Natural chert cobbles, a few tested cobbles, and at least
six large chert cores were observed on the surface. No diagnostic artifacts, features, or
concentrations were observed during the investigation. See Appendix A, Figures 4A/4B for the
site boundary and Appendix B (B-11 through B-14) for associated photographs.
Prehistoric site 41TV2550 (Site 3) is a lithic procurement site; it is located on a northern terrace
that slopes downward to the east. The northern boundary of the site is located approximately 302
feet southeast, 432 feet south, and 951 feet west of a Slaughter Creek tributary that wraps around
the northern side of this terrace. The tributary eventually joins a second tributary that wraps
around this larger terrace to the south. The sites southern boundary is located approximately
247.88 feet northeast of the northwest side of the intersection of S. Bay Ln and north bound S
Mopac Expy (Loop 1). It is approximately 66 feet east of and parallels the eastern edge of the
north bound Loop 1. The site is located in the eastern half of the APE in an open wooded
landscape consisting of cedar, cedar elm, prickly pear, live oak trees, twist leaf yucca, and tasajillo
with abundant exposures of limestone bedrock. The western half of the APE is the steeply sloping
Loop 1 ROW which has been cleared and mowed; there was no evidence of cultural material in
this portion of the ROW. Loop 1 has been built up and highway run-off drains into the site area.
Within the APE, the site measures approximately 220 feet N/S by 31 feet E/S and extends at least
22 feet east of the APE. Two shovel tests (STs 3 and 4) were excavated in rocky clay loam mixed
with small pieces of decomposed limestone over limestone bedrock between 15 and 16 inches
bs. A few small chert pebbles were observed in ST 3 and one large chert core and two lithic
chunks were noted in the upper few inches of ST 4 and extended onto the surface. An abundance
of natural chert cobbles were observed along with large tested cobbles, six cores of various sizes,

of cultural material, it is spread across the site surface without patterning. See Appendix A,
Figures 4A/4B for the site boundary and Appendix B (B-15 through B-20) for associated
photographs.
Prehistoric site 41TV2551 (Site 4) is a lithic procurement site; it is located on the southwestern
edge of a terrace sloping downward toward the unnamed Slaughter Creek tributary which is
approximately 580 feet to the south. The surface is relatively level with a minor slope to the south
and east. A second tributary is located approximately 0.21-mile northeast of the site. This terrace
levels out to the east beyond the APE; Slaughter Creek is located approximately 0.88 mile to the
east. The sites southern boundary is located approximately 0.28 mile north northeast of the
northwest corner of the intersection of S. Bay Ln and north bound S Mopac Expy (Loop 1). It is
approximately 82.1 feet east of the eastern edge of the north bound Loop 1. The site extends
approximately 20 feet into the eastern edge of the APE and extends east beyond the APE. The
entire site area has been burned, either by a controlled burn or accidental burn. The vegetation
includes a few clusters of cedar and live oak trees and prickly pear and the surface has abundant
exposures of broken up limestone rocks and chert gravels. Very little of the site is located in the

APE consisting of approximately 20 feet along the eastern edge of the APE; it may extend a great
distance into the Lady Bird Wildflower Center. Within the APE, the site measures approximately
200 feet N/S by 20 feet E/W and extends at least 245 feet to the east beyond the APE. Due to
the 90 to 100 percent ground surface visibility and exposures of limestone at the surface, shovel
testing was not warranted. Natural chert cobbles, chert gravels, and limestone rocks were
observed along with ten large tested cobbles, several primary flakes, chert cores of various sizes,
and a few chert chunks. There are no diagnostic artifacts, features, concentrations, or clustering
of cultural material, it is spread across the site surface without patterning. See Appendix A,
Figures 5A/5B for the site boundary and Appendix B (B-21 through B-25) for associated
photographs.
Prehistoric site 41TV2552 (Site 5) is a lithic procurement site; it is located on the northeastern
edge of a downward sloping surface toward an unnamed Slaughter Creek tributary to the
northwest approximately 728 feet. A second tributary is located approximately 0.21 mile to the
south. The gently sloping terrace levels out to the east well beyond the APE. Slaughter Creek is
located approximately 0.85 mile to the east. The site is located approximately 0.39-mile north
northeast of the northwestern corner of the intersection of S. Bay Ln. and the northbound Loop 1.
The site extends from 95.5 feet to 136.7 feet east of northbound Loop 1. It appears to be mostly
confined to the APE but may extend an unknown distance to the east. It measures approximately
110 feet N/S by 45 feet E/W within the APE. The vegetation consists of mainly cedar with a few
prickly pear, live oak trees, twist leaf yucca, and tasajillo. Under the canopy of cedar trees is a
cleared floor with exposed limestone bedrock and chert gravels at the surface. Due to the 90 to
100 percent ground surface visibility and exposures of limestone at the surface, shovel testing
was not warranted. The cultural assemblage includes early reduction and source testing of chert
cobbles along with one large primary flake and one large secondary flake with edge utilization,
chert chunks with cortex (a few exhibited edge nibbling), and one early stage biface. There are
no diagnostic artifacts, features, concentrations, or clustering of cultural material which is spread
across the site surface without patterning. See Appendix A, Figures 5A/5B for the site boundary
and Appendix B (B-25 through B-30) for associated photographs.

SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS

The Area of Potential Effect (APE) for cultural resources was identified as the 0.81 mile portion of
the Loop 1 natural gas pipeline project that had not been previously surveyed. The northern
boundary of the APE is located approximately 0.20 mile south of the intersection of northbound
Loop 1 and La Crosse Avenue and the southern boundary is located approximately 854 feet
south of South Bay Lane for a total length of approximately 0.81 mile; it extends east of Loop 1
approximately 130 feet for a total of 12.45 acres.
The APE was subjected to an intensive pedestrian survey, supplemented with shovel testing;
four shovel tests (Shovel Tests 1 â 4) were excavated by the archeologists across the APE.
Five prehistoric procurement sites (41TV2548, 41TV2549, 41TV2550, 41TV2551, and
41TV2552) were documented across the APE. The assemblages include natural chert cobbles
with a small number of tested cobbles and cores along with a few primary flakes and utilized
flakes and chunks. Due to the limestone bedrock at or near the surface, a limited number of
shovel tests were excavated. The only subsurface cultural materials were observed in the upper
few inches. The dark brown clay loam was mixed with decomposed limestone and solid
limestone bedrock was encountered between 11 and 17 inches below the surface. The only
cultural materials recorded during the shovel testing were limited to the upper few inches. Two
small chert cores were observed in the upper one inch in ST 2 (41TV2548), and one large chert
core and two lithic chunks were observed in the upper few inches and the surface at ST 4
(41TV2550). See Table 2 and Attachment A, Figures 4A/4B for shovel test descriptions and
locations.
The sites have not been fully assessed to the east beyond the proposed Project; therefore, their
NRHP eligibility is unknown. However, due to the surficial nature of the sites and lack of features,
concentrations, clusters or diagnostic cultural material, sites 41TV2548 through 41TV2552, as
currently recorded, would not contribute to their eligibility if they were later determined NRHP
eligible.
Apex recommends that the Project proceed without further cultural resource investigation as the
proposed construction would have no effect on cultural resources eligible for inclusion in the
NRHP or listing as SALs. The work reported here represents a reasonable and good faith effort
to ensure that the proposed Project will not affect historic properties; and no further work is
recommended.
If it is determined that the planned construction requires additional workspace beyond the
currently proposed infrastructure, then further archeological investigations may be necessary in
those areas prior to any construction.
