ABSTRACT

Geo-Marine, Inc. (GMI), under contract to CDM, conducted archeological investigations along
the proposed 2.06 mile (3.2-kilometer) route of a proposed San Antonio Water System (SAWS)
sewer line along Leon Creek in southwestern Bexar County, Texas. The construction easement
for the project is 115 feet (ft); 35 meters [m]) wide and the permanent easement is 50 ft (16 m)
wide.
The archeological field investigations involved pedestrian survey along each side of the proposed
right-of-way. Fifteen shovel tests were placed where drainage, soils, vegetation, and low levels
of disturbance suggested archeological sites might be preserved. In addition, two backhoe
trenches were placed along Leon Creek and a third trench in the terrace deposits above Leon
Creek to determine the potential for buried cultural deposits. Four previously documented
archeological sites are within 1 mile (mi) or 1.6 km of the proposed construction project, but none
are within the project right-of-way. A series of concrete slabs and foundations was found west of
Plumnear Road that, based on aerial photographs, were built in the 1970s In view of the late
period of construction and demolition of the associated structures, these features are not
considered eligible for inclusion in the National Register of Historic Places or for designation as a
State Archeological Landmark. No historic properties will be affected by the proposed sewer
line.
All materials generated by this project will be permanently curated at the Center for
Archeological Research (CAR) at the University of Texas at San Antonio.

CHAPTER 1
INTRODUCTION

San Antonio Water System (SAWS) is planning to build a replacement for the Western
Watershed (WWRL A) sewer main in southwestern Bexar County (Figure 1). Geo-Marine, Inc.
(GMI), of Plano, Texas, was contracted by CDM, the SAWS contractor for this project, to
provide the archeological investigation for the lower segment of the project. This segment of the
project is approximately 3.32 kilometers (km; 2.06 miles [mi]) long and has a construction
easement 35 meters (m; 115 feet [ft]) wide. The permanent easement is 14 m (50 ft) wide.
Fieldwork was conducted on February 15 to 18, 2010, by Steven Hunt of GMI. Melissa Green,
also of GMI, served as Principal Investigator for the project.
The project right-of-way is in southwestern Bexar County, a short distance east of the intersection
of Interstate Highway (IH) 35 and IH 410. The right-of-way begins along the IH 410 westbound
frontage road and proceeds in a roughly northwesterly direction until it reaches New Laredo
Highway (Figure 2). After crossing New Laredo Highway, the right-of-way meanders in a
roughly northeasterly direction until its ending point along Quintana Road. Large portions of the
right-of-way are disturbed due to fill deposits and abandoned residential or commercial
properties. In addition, the existing SAWS pipeline parallels the right-of-way a short distance to
the east along much of the route. The right-of-way crosses Leon Creek in three different
locations.
The current survey was undertaken to provide baseline information for the project environmental
assessment as required by the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) of 1969 [42 U.S.C. Â§Â§
4321â4347; P.L. 91â190; 83 Stat. 852]. This investigation was conducted to fulfill compliance
with Section 106 of the National Historic Preservation Act (NHPA) of 1966, as amended through
2000 [16 U.S.C. Â§ 470 et seq.; P.L. 89â665; 80 Stat. 915], requiring cultural resources survey. In
addition, the ultimate client, SAWS, is a political subdivision of the state of Texas and must
comply with the Antiquities Code of Texas [Title 9, Chapter 191, the Natural Resources Code of
Texas]. Accordingly, the present investigation was conducted under Texas Antiquities Code
permit #5516. The ultimate goal was to identify and inventory cultural resources properties
contained within the proposed project APE and to evaluate their potential for inclusion in the
National Register of Historic Places (NRHP) or for designation as a State Archeological
Landmark (SAL). All materials generated from this project will be permanently housed at the
Center for Archeological Research (CAR) at the University of Texas at San Antonio.

CHAPTER 2
ENVIRONMENTAL CONTEXT

PHYSIOGRAPHY
Bexar County includes portions of three physiographic regions: the Edwards Plateau, the
Blackland Prairie, and the Rio Grande Plain (also known as the South Texas Coastal Plain). The
Edwards Plateau is north and west; the Blackland Prairie is east and southeast; and the Rio
Grande Plain is south and southwest. The Balcones Fault Zone is characterized by undulating
and hilly topography that ranges from about 2133 to 335 m (700-1100 ft) amsl. The area is
dissected by small streams (Taylor et al. 1991). Chert, a raw material for the production of stone
tools, is found in outcrops throughout the project area, particularly in the Balcones area. At the
southern fringe of the Edwards Plateau, the Balcones Canyonlands is a natural subregion of Texas
that has a landscape dissected by numerous high gradient streams in steep-sided canyons that
flow south and southeast to the Gulf of Mexico (Riskind and Diamond 1988:1).

GEOLOGY AND SOILS
The Geologic Atlas of Texas has mapped the geologic formation underlying the project area as
the Eocene-era Midway Group (Bureau of Economic Geology 1983). The U.S. Department of
Agriculture, Soil Conservation Service (SCS), shows three soil map units within the project area:
Frio clay loam; Venus clay loam, 0 to 1 percent slopes; and Venus clay loam, 1 to 3 percent
slopes. Frio clay loam is found on the flood plains of the San Antonio and Medina rivers and
their major tributaries, or on low terraces adjacent to the flood plains. Occasional flooding occurs
within the map unit. The landform is relatively level, from 0 to 1 percent slopes. The ground
surface is uneven and may be dissected by old stream channels, in which water may stand for
short periods after floods. The typical soil profile begins with a grayish brown or dark grayish
brown clay loam about 51 cm (20 in) deep and is underlain by a light brownish gray clay loam or
loam from 51 to 63 cm (20-25 in) below surface. The C horizon consists of pale brown clay loam
from 63 to 89 cm (25-35 in) below surface and a very pale loam stratified with thin layers of clay
loan and sandy loam below that (Taylor et al. 1966:16, 109).

5

Venus clay loam, 0 to 1 percent slopes, forms on smooth terraces 20 to 40 feet above the flood
plains of the San Antonio and Medina rivers and their major tributaries. The soil begins with a
dark-grayish brown loam or clay loam that is approximately 41 cm (16 in) deep. The underlying
AC horizon is about 50 cm (20 in) thick and consists of brown limy loam or clay loam that has
less clay content than the surface layer. The C horizon consists of light yellowish brown or very
pale brown loam that may be many feet thick. Snail shells, worm casts, and fine pores are
common (Taylor et al. 1966:33, 116).
Venus clay loam, 1 to 3 percent slopes, forms as gentle slopes either between terrace deposits and
upland soils or between terrace deposits and flood plains. The soil begins with a dark-grayish
brown loam or clay loam that is approximately 36 cm (14 in) deep. The underlying AC horizon
is about 50 cm (20 in) thick consists of brown limy loam or clay loam that has less clay content
than the surface layer. The C horizon consists of light yellowish brown or very pale brown loam
that may be many feet thick (Taylor et al. 1966:33, 116).

CLIMATE
Bexar County has a modified subtropical climate. Winters are mild, with northerly winds
prevailing, and summers are hot, with southeasterly winds prevailing. Strong winds and heavy
rains occasionally occur as the result of tropical storms in the Gulf of Mexico. The San Antonio
area has an average of 265 frost-free days. The warmest months are May through October.
Temperatures rarely fall below -6.6Â°C (20Â°F). The average daily maximum and minimum
temperatures for December-January range from about 4.4 to 15.5Â°C 40â60Â°F), and from 21 to
35Â°C (70â95Â°F) for July âAugust (Taylor et al. 1966:102, 118â119, Table 11).
Precipitation, about 70.86 cm (27.9 inches) annually, is generally distributed throughout the year,
with the highest rainfalls occurring in May and September. Winter is the period of lowest
precipitation. Thunderstorms account for most of the rains from April through September. Light
hail often accompanies spring thunderstorms. Because of the presence of steep slopes, thin rocky
soils, and narrow valleys/canyons in the northwest, portions of Bexar County are subject to
flooding during heavy rainfalls. During the winter, snow is rare and most precipitation occurs as
light rains or drizzles. The average minimum and maximum monthly precipitation occurs during
November (about 3.6 cm [1.4 inches]) and September (about 8.9 cm [3.5 inches]), respectively
(Taylor et al. 1966:118, Table 11).

FLORA
As indicated previously, Bexar County is situated in a transitional zone between three
physiographic regions. Therefore, the flora is a mixture of three biotic provinces; the Balconian
(associated with the Edwards Plateau), the Texan (associated with the Blackland Prairie), and the
Tamaulipan (associated with the South Texas Coastal Plain) (Table 1). Each is represented to
varying degrees (Blair 1950).
Vegetation consists of mixed evergreen-deciduous woodlands along the edge of the escarpment,
grading into deciduous woodlands, and finally into forest in riparian and deep canyon settings.
Prior to European settlement the vegetation setting along the southeastern border of the Edwards
Plateau was predominantly grasslands with woodlands and forests limited to hillsides and deeply

incised limestone canyons (Weniger 1988). The mixture of grasslands and riparian forests, in
addition to the nearby Blackland Prairie, would have provided prehistoric inhabitants of the
region with ample game and edible plant resources.

FAUNA
Bexar County is in a faunal transitional zone that is characterized by an intermixture of vertebrate
fauna from other biotic provinces: Austroriparian, Tamaulipan, Chihuahuan, and Dansan (Blair
1950:113â115). The mammals are represented by 57 species and none are restricted to the
Balconian province. Major mammalian fauna include the white-tailed deer, raccoon, coyote, fox,
bobcat, opossum, fox squirrel, eastern cottontail, black-tailed jackrabbit, beaver, eastern wood rat,
badger, skunk, river, otter, and the extirpated pronghorn, and bison (Blair 1950:113â114;
Schmidly 1983). Important nonmammalian species consist of turkey, bobwhite, western box
turtle, snapping turtle, channel catfish, and sunfish (Blair 1950:113â115; Bull and Ferand 1977;
Ernst and Barbour 1972; Hubbs 1982; Schmidly 1983; Taylor et al. 1966:3â4). Most of these
species were of economic importance to prehistoric populations of the region.

CHAPTER 3
CULTURAL CONTEXT

PREVIOUS RESEARCH
Because of the unique location of the project area in a transitional zone between three
physiographic regions and the concentration of springs and streams along the Balcones
Escarpment, the region has been a favored camping place throughout prehistory (Story 1985). A
review of the map, county, and site files at the TARL; the online Historic Sites Atlas and the
Archeological Sites Atlas maintained by the Texas Historical Commission; survey files and
reports; National Register of Historic Places (NRHP) nominations; and Recorded Texas Historic
Landmarks files at the Texas Historical Commission revealed that several major archeological
and historical projects have contributed important information regarding the prehistoric and
historic occupation of the region. In addition, over the years, many small archeological surveys
dealing with residential and commercial development, parks, landfills, water and wastewater
lines, and road improvements have been conducted.
In 1970 and 1971 avocational archeologists, Paul McGuff and Bill Faucett, recorded many sites
along Leon Creek. Many of these sites have not been revisited since they were originally
recorded while others, such as 41BX52 (Pavo Real), have been fully mitigated. Other
avocational work in the area included a rescue excavation of a burial by South Texas
Archaeological Association (STAA) members in 1990, and site recording efforts by STAA
members David Calame and C. K. Chandler. Excavation projects, major surveys on Lackland
and Kelly AFBs, and smaller surveys proximate to the proposed pipeline route, have been
undertaken over the past 25 or so years. All of these projects document heavy exploitation of
Leon Creek and its environs during both prehistoric and historic times.
The excavation of 41BX52 (Pavo Real) by the Texas Department of Transportation (TxDOT) in
1979 (Henderson and Goode 1991) contributed greatly to our knowledge of Paleoindian lifeways
and illustrated the rich culture history preserved in the Leon Creek valley. This site was
originally recorded by Paul McGuff and Bill Faucett in 1970. It is now destroyed by construction
of Loop 1604 West and its bridge over Leon Creek.

9

The Texas Historical Commission sites atlas shows an EPA TDWR survey in September 1983
along Leon Creek within the current buffer zone from just north of Loop 13 southward to Loop
410. No additional information is available on the survey or sites that may have been recorded.
In June and July of 1994, the Center for Archaeological Research (CAR) of the University of
Texas at San Antonio (UTSA) conducted an archeological survey of a 147-acre tract of land
along Leon Creek (Tennis and Hard 1995). This survey resulted in recommendations concerning
four previously recorded sites within the tract (41BX40, 41BX47, 41BX48, and 41BX50). The
previously identified sites were reevaluated resulting in the determination that 41BX48 no longer
exists, 41BX40 is actually a part of larger site 41BX47, and 41BX50 has been heavily damaged.
Site 41BX47, an Early and Middle Archaic period site, was tested in 1995 and recommended
eligible for inclusion in the NRHP (Tennis 1996). Eighty-four burned rock features were
identified and Paleoindian, Early, Middle, and Late Archaic components were identified.
In 1991, GMI conducted a sample survey of 1,460 acres of the San Antonio Ranch, property
owned by the Department of Housing and Urban Development and later transferred to Texas
Parks and Wildlife as a part of Government Canyon State Natural Area. This survey resulted in
the recording of 17 new archeological sites. None of these sites was recommended eligible for
inclusion in the National Register (Peter and Hunt 1992).
In 1996, archeologists from Texas Parks and Wildlife conducted a survey of 725 acres at the
south end of Government Canyon State Natural Area. This survey resulted in the relocation of
previously recorded site 41BX148 and the identification of 16 new archeological sites
(41BX1190â41BX1205).
Recommendations for State Archeological Landmark (SAL)
designation of these sites were presented as well as a Management Plan for archeological
resources in the Government Canyon State Natural Area (McNatt et al. 2000).
As part of the Kelly AFB CRMP (Peter et al. 1997), a geoarcheological assessment of the base
was undertaken to determine the contextual integrity of the landforms and use areas. The
assessment consisted of archival research, review of available geological studies, reconnaissance
survey, intensive survey, and backhoe investigations. Only limited areas of the base were found
to have not been affected by construction of military facilities, gravel operations, golf course
landscaping, or landfill activities. These areas were intensively surveyed. One historic-era site
(41BX958) was found but was recommended not eligible for NRHP inclusion.
In the 1990s, CAR conducted a project on Lackland AFB. A 3,860-acre survey began in 1994
with limited surveys and shovel testing of areas slated for development, followed by a 100percent pedestrian survey with limited shovel testing of the remaining undisturbed and
undeveloped areas of the base (Nickels et al. 1997). The project recorded 71 new sites and
revisited three known sites. Seventy-one of the 74 sites were considered eligible for NRHP
inclusion.
An intensive pedestrian survey of Leon Creek between Bandera Road and Babcock Road was
conducted in 1998 by CAR (Cargill 1999). This survey identified three new archeological sites
(41BX1301â41BX1303) within the floodplain. Only one site was considered to have potential
for inclusion in the NRHP and was recommended for testing if avoidance was not possible.

10

Between 2001 and 2002 CAR conducted systematic archeological survey of trail locations in a
portion of Government Canyon (Greaves et al. 2002). This survey resulted in the identification of
86 sites; 52 were newly recorded. Of the 86 sites, 24 were recommended for designation as
SALs. These sites have subsurface deposits, low levels of disturbance, and a high density of
artifacts. The remaining 62 sites are not recommended for SAL designation.
In 2003 CAR tested two areas of site 41BX1199 and recommended that the parts investigated are
not eligible (Weston 2003). The site represents a low density scatter and monitoring and periodic
inspection was recommended.
According to the site atlas, part of a survey conducted for TxDOT in 2003 by Parsons,
Brinckerhoff, Quade, and Douglas crosses near the southern end of the present project area.
Limited rights-of-entry were available during the survey with only two isolated finds and a trash
scatter identified, and the entire area found to be âof poor integrityâ (Ahr 2004).
GMI conducted limited archeological delineations and NRHP evaluations at 23 previously
recorded sites on Lackland AFB in 2003 (Huhnke et al. 2006). Two sites were recommended
eligible. Many of the remaining sites were not found and thus considered not eligible for NRHP
inclusion. Seven sites, however, were in the floodplain and although near-surface deposits failed
to yield significant cultural resources, each had the potential for deeply buried deposits within
floodplain portion of the sites and those portions were of undetermined eligibility. Sites
41BX1107 (not eligible) and 41BX1108 (eligible) in the 2003 project are within the current
proposed pipeline buffer zone.
Between October 2002 and January 2004 CAR conducted archeological survey of a 2,570-ac
project area for the Toyota manufacturing plant (Greaves et al. 2004). Much of this survey falls
south of the Leon Creek watershed and only two sites identified during the project are located
within the current study area (41BX125 and 41BX681).
Most recently, an overview and reconnaissance survey of the watershed in western Bexar County,
which included Leon Creek and its tributaries, was undertaken by GMI for the USACE, Fort
Worth District, as a step in identifying and evaluating cultural resources that could be affected by
future flood control measures (Osburn 2008). In total, 305 archeological sites are located within
the approximately 152,000-acre area reviewed. Of these 305 sites in the watershed area, 145
would require additional inspection if they will be directly or indirectly affected by planned flood
control measures. In 2008, a cultural resources files search and literature review was conducted
by GMI for SAWS covering the entire Western Watershed relief sewer line from US 90 to IH
410, of which the lower portion constitutes this project, indicating two historic markers and 11
recorded sites within 1.5 miles of the proposed sewer line (Allday and Osburn 2008). One of
theses sites fall within the current project alignment, but is not in this currently surveyed segment.
The most recent project along Leon Creek was conducted in 2009 by SWCA Environmental
Consultants for the proposed Leon Creek hike and bike trail from SW Military Drive to Loop 353
(Quintana Road) (Galindo 2010). One previously recorded site 41BX598 purported to be in the
project area was not relocated. However, one newly identified prehistoric site, 41BX1815 a
surficial lithic scatter, was found with no diagnostics, features, or intact deposits, and therefore
not considered eligible for inclusion on the NRHP or designation as an SAL.

PREHISTORIC CHRONOLOGY (11,500â450 B.P.)
The project area falls within the southern portion of the Central Texas archeological region. The
archeological record for Central Texas reflects the full North American cultural sequence;
therefore, evidence of human occupation spans a time period of roughly 12,000 years. The
Central Texas cultural sequence presented in the following discussion is divided into regionspecific cultural-historical periods within four broad cultural stagesâPaleo-Indian, Archaic, Late
Prehistoric, and Historicâthat differentiate the broadly recognized North American cultural
trends (Table 2). These four major cultural stages are briefly summarized in the following
cultural history of the Central Texas area, which derives primarily from the work of Black (1989),
Collins (1995, 2004), Hester (2004), Prewitt (1981, 1985), Suhm (1960), Suhm et al. (1954), and
Weir (1976).

Paleo-Indian
The earliest widely accepted human occupation of North America is termed the Paleo-Indian
period (11,500â8,800 years before present [B.P.]). Cooler, wetter conditions were in place 12,000
years ago, and although a general drying trend continued through Paleo-Indian times, climatic
conditions were more stable than during the subsequent Holocene. This period is often
characterized as a culture of small but highly mobile bands of foragers who were specialized
hunters of Pleistocene megafauna. Most Paleo-Indian sites are deeply buried and difficult to find,
leaving the highly visible, but often fortuitously discovered, mammoth kill sites as the primary
evidence of Paleo-Indian life-ways. Recent studies address this bias and emphasize that large
kills probably contributed little to overall food requirements. Rather, a primary reliance on other
game animals and plant resources was more likely (Ferring 1989). Subsistence in this period
certainly included large herbivores such as mammoth, bison, and horse, but was probably based
more consistently on smaller animals such as various species of turtle, land tortoise, alligator,
mice, badger, and raccoon (Collins et al. 1989; Story 1990) and, presumably, also included an
array of plants (Collins 1998). The defining Paleo-Indian trait is the fluted point tradition.
Projectile points of the Early Paleo-Indian period were made from high quality toolstone and
indicate high technical skill in flaking, exhibiting a hallmark âflute,â which is a long, shallow
flake scar that extends from the base toward the tip of the point on one or both sides.
12

The Paleo-Indian stage in Texas, as across North America, is the earliest substantiated cultural
period. The Paleo-Indian stage in Central Texas falls into early and late subperiods, which
encompass three archeological complexes. The Llano and Folsom complexes comprise the Early
Paleo-Indian subperiod (11,500â10,000 B.P.), and the Late Paleo-Indian (10,000â8,800 B.P.)
reflects the Plano complex. These complexes are not unique to Central Texas, for their ranges
extended into the Southwest and Great Plains. The Early Paleo-Indian subperiod is based on two
projectile point styles: Clovis and Folsom.
The Llano complex is represented by the Clovis projectile point, the oldest point type found in
North America. Much research energy has been devoted to the makers of Clovis points, but the
material record of Llano peoples is largely limited to hunting activities. Clovis assemblages
include the diagnostic fluted lanceolate Clovis point, along with engraved stones, bone and ivory
points, stone bolas, and ochre (Collins 1995; Collins et al. 1992). Sites with Clovis components
reported in Central Texas include Kincaid Rockshelter, Wilson-Leonard, Gault, Horn Shelter 2,
Pavo Real (41BX52), and Crockett Gardens. Surface finds of distinctive Clovis points are
reported from a number of other localities (Meltzer and Bever 1995).
By about 11,000 years ago the cool, wet climatic conditions of the Pleistocene had given way to
Holocene warming and drying. This change coincides with the extinction of Pleistocene
megafauna, most notably the mammoth, and is concurrent with the earliest record of the Folsom
complex. Like the Llano complex, the Folsom complex is best known for the Folsom projectile
point. Shorter than Clovis points, âclassicâ Folsom points exhibit fine parallel flaking and large
flutes that extend across most of each face. Midland points, commonly believed to occur later in
time, may represent unfluted Folsom points, apparently made to offset the production risks
involved in fluting (Amick 1995). Another trademark of the Folsom complex is the association
of Folsom points with the remains of now-extinct bison (Bison antiquus), usually found in the
context of massive kills of bison herds run into ravines. Such sites are conspicuous, and thus
much of what is known about Folsom subsistence and technology comes from lithic artifacts
found at these sites or nearby processing sites. Folsom tool kits consisted of the fluted Folsom
and the thin, unfluted (Midland) points, large thin bifaces, and end scrapers that were more
conducive to specialized hunting, particularly of Bison antiquus (Collins 1995:382).
By approximately 10,000 years ago, the climate trended toward more moderate conditions, and
the megafauna from the Early Paleo-Indian subperiod were no longer available. Most of the
associated faunal evidence dated to the Late Paleo-Indian Plano complex reflects a human
subsistence pattern based on deer and other smaller animals. Horn Shelter No. 2 (Forrester 1985)
located on the Brazos River in Bosque County, Hinds Cave (Shafer and Bryant 1977) in Val
Verde County, and Wilson-Leonard (Collins 1998) in Williamson County have yielded
subsistence data indicating that a variety of vertebrate fauna was consumed by the Late PaleoIndian peoples.
The Late Paleo-Indian Plano complex is represented by a greater diversity of projectile points
(e.g., Plainview, Angostura, Scottsbluff, and Golondrina), which, still in lanceolate form, were
unfluted. In contrast to evidence from the earlier subperiod, late subperiod points are associated
with modern bison (Bison bison) and often occur as surface finds throughout Central Texas. The
beginning of Prewittâs (1981) Early Archaic, or Circleville phase, is considered in this report as
the Late Paleo-Indian Plano complex but has also been called the âPre-Archaicâ (see Sollberger
and Hester 1972). The Late Paleo-Indian Plano complex defies convenient labeling, as it exhibits
a unique blend of lanceolate and stemmed points that appear to correspond with life-ways
13

reflective of Archaic subsistence alongside Paleo-Indian mobility. Again, little is known about
the complex in Central Texas, but toward the latter part of the Late Paleo-Indian period,
lanceolate points began to be replaced by stemmed points. Settlement-subsistence strategies
probably more closely approximated those of the Archaic than Early Paleo-Indian. More diverse
sites are associated with this period, including not only the mass bison kills, which by the Late
Paleo-Indian period consist only of modern bison (Bison bison), but also campsites and
residences. The characteristics of the Wilson, Golondrina-Barber, and St. Maryâs Hall
components are more Archaic-like in that burned rock features are found, although the features
are much smaller and contain less rock that the burned rock features in the subsequent Archaic.

Archaic
Toward the end of the Late Paleo-Indian period a great variety of projectile point styles began to
appear. The subsequent Archaic period (8,800â1,200 B.P.) is broadly characterized by stemmed
and side-notched dart points and by the appearance of ground and pecked stone tools. The
Archaic represents a more generalized style of hunting and gathering as a way of life, and the
subsistence pattern may have become more diffuse, reflecting a greater exploitation of local
environments as smaller game animals, fish, and wild plant foods increased in dietary importance.
Like their predecessors, Archaic peoples apparently continued to follow a nomadic way of life,
traveling seasonally to utilize different food resources in various localities (cf. Weir 1976).
McGraw and Hindes (1987:47) have noted that:
In northern and central Bexar County, major occupation sites are situated on stream terraces and are
usually associated with one or a series of spatially proximate, often buried, burned rock middens. An
extensive distribution of chipped stone debitage and a variety of diagnostic projectile points indicate
recurring occupations that span several thousand years. Major Late Prehistoric sites, in contrast, are
often physically discrete from these earlier sites.

The Archaic is generally divided into Early, Middle, and Late subperiods (Black 1989; Collins
1995, 2004; Story 1985) based on diagnostic projectile point styles and associated radiocarbon
assays (Collins 1995, 2004). By the Middle Archaic in southern Central Texas, some regional
distinctiveness is apparent archeologically, as evidenced primarily by increased techno-stylistic
diversity among projectile point types. Interplay between influential factors of population
increase and environmental change toward greater aridity and climatic variability probably drove
adaptive change throughout the Archaic. The following discussion follows Storyâs (1985) broader
subdivisions of the Early, Middle, and Late Archaic, although Prewittâs (1981) discussion of
various phases within these periods provides much of the information discussed.
The most archeologically obvious changes from the Paleo-Indian to the Early Archaic (8,800â
6,000 B.P.) are the appearance of ground stone implements and the shift from the lanceolate points
of the Paleo-Indian tradition to the stemmed and side-notched dart points emblematic of the
Archaic. Three recognized point styles (Angostura, Early Split Stem [Gower and Jetta], and
Martindale-Uvalde) indicate that the makers tended to occupy the better-watered eastern part of
the Edwards Plateau (Collins 1998:65). Assemblages also include Clear Fork and Guadalupe
bifaces, manos, metates, hammerstones, burins, circular scrapers, and a variety of bifaces. Few
burials have been assigned to this period (Prewitt 1981:77â79; Story 1985:34â35), and
settlement/subsistence systems are âhypothesized to have been diffuse, utilizing a variety of
resources and frequently shifting the loci of subsistence activities rather than intensifying the use
of any specified resourceâ (Story 1985:39).
14

Projectile point types constitute the primary source of information about the Early Archaic, but
Prewitt (1981, 1985) uses point types to define four phases: the Circleville, San Geronimo,
Jarrell, and Oakalla, respectively. This refinement is questioned by some as unsubstantiated since
few intact sites are known (see Black 1989:26; Black and McGraw 1985), but the tendency for
many Early Archaic sites to occur around the Balcones Escarpment leads several researchers to
infer that this area was a refuge from drier conditions in Central Texas and on the coastal plains
(McKinney 1981; Story 1985). Concentrations of Early Archaic sites along the southern and
eastern margins of the Edwards Plateau may be indicative of climatic conditions at the time, as
these environments had more reliable water sources and a diverse subsistence base. The margins
of the Edwards Plateau are ecotonal in character and may have provided reliable resources during
times of environmental stress (Story 1985:31, 34). Convincing paleoenvironmental data on the
climatic conditions of this period is, nonetheless, still lacking.
Early Archaic sites are small (Weir 1976:115-122), suggesting that populations were highly
mobile and that their densities were low (Prewitt 1985:217). Early Archaic sites are usually
described as open campsites (such as Loeve, Wilson-Leonard, Richard Beene, Sleeper, Jetta
Court, Youngsport, Camp Pearl Wheat, and Landslide) or lithic procurement stations. Only a few
campsites located in rockshelters (e.g., Kincaid Rockshelter) occur on the Edwards Plateau during
this period. The location of lithic procurement sites is determined by the natural distribution of
cherts. Large and varied burned-rock features (Sleeper, Camp Pearl Wheat, Wilson-Leonard,
Richard Beene) become common in the latter part of the Early Archaic, and domestic structures
(Turkey Bend Ranch) and caches (Linder) are also known in the Early Archaic (Collins 1998:64).
Freshwater mussel, deer, and small game appear to have been important food resources. Hearths
are occasionally found at Early Archaic sites and can be stone-lined, basin-shaped, or flat. The
appearance of ground stone signifies a shift to plant resources, and the diversification of lithic
technology appears to reflect an increased reliance on gathering.
The Middle Archaic (6,000â4,000 B.P.) marks the first period of Central Texas distinctiveness as
an archeological region. The subperiod exhibits more numerous and more varied sites than the
preceding Early Archaic. This cultural manifestation is characterized by a population increase;
the development of regionally distinct cultural patterns; and changes in settlement patterns,
economic and social systems, and technology (Prewitt 1985). In addition, territorial boundaries
may have begun to emerge (Story 1985:39).
Burned-rock middens, which often consist of massive amounts of fire-cracked limestone, are,
however, the preeminent archeological features of the Middle Archaic. Many of these middens
may represent earthen ovens used to process live oak acorns (see Weir 1976), as well as for
roasting succulents or other plants and animals. Many Central Texas tree species disappeared
from the paleoenvironmental record at this time, leaving live oak forests to dominate the
landscape. A renewed focus on deer, which themselves were well suited for the oak-savanna
environment, is likely. Weir (1976:124â130) suggests that an expansion of oak forests influenced
the development of an economic system that focused on the exploitation of deer, acorns, and
other hardwood nuts. Prewitt (1985:222â226) notes that the abundance of rock middens indicates
a greater reliance on plant foods, although tool kits still imply a strong reliance on hunting.
Middle Archaic sites in Central Texas are represented by rockshelters, campsites, lithic quarries,
and kill sites (Weir 1976), as well as by the burned-rock middens that first appeared toward the
end of the Early Archaic. Other features include basin hearths and large flat hearths. Data
concerning mortuary practices are few except for the end of the Middle Archaic, for which
15

cremations have been reported (Prewitt 1981:81). Three generalized point styles characterize this
subperiod: Bell-Andice-Calf Creek, Taylor, and Nolan-Travis. Bifaces, a variety of scrapers,
unifaces, and grinding stones are also present. Prewitt (1981:73) suggests that the proportion of
projectile points (50 percent) compared to total number of tools is indicative of a balance between
the exploitation of plant and animal resources.
Late Archaic (4,000â1,200 B.P.) life-ways began similarly to those of the Middle Archaic, but
notable changes occurred, characterized by the emergence of new cultural patterns as well as the
intensification of preexisting ones (Story 1985:45). Coastal marine shells, used either as
ornaments or as raw materials for ornaments, were exchanged with inland groups, at least on a
limited basis, in return for finished lithic tools and/or siliceous raw material (Story 1985:48). The
use of burned-rock middens throughout the Late Archaic appears to have been a major part of the
subsistence strategy as a decrease in the importance of hunting, inferred from the low ratio of
projectile points in relation to other tools in site assemblages, may have occurred (Prewitt
1981:74). Bison, which had been absent from the area for most of the Archaic, however, were
once again available in the region (Dillehay 1974).
Late Archaic sites include rockshelters, campsites, and large cemeteries. The establishment of
these large cemeteries along drainages suggests strong territorial ties by certain groups (Story
1985:40). Cemeteries, burial sites where at least two individuals were buried in proximity, imply
repeated use of space for the burial of a group of peopleâs dead. The location and use of the
larger cemeteries are believed to be the result of the same cultural group using a place on the
landscape to reaffirm their rights of descent and control/access to critical resources (see
discussion in Taylor 1998 and Taylor et al. 1995:627â631).
Late Archaic cemeteries in South and Central Texas exhibit a significant energy investment and
often contain mortuary furniture. When artifacts are found in burial contexts, they represent
discrete points in time, or part of the package of tools or objects that would have been used during
a particular occupation period. Burial artifacts, then, provide the unique opportunity to glimpse
an assemblage that may not be possible in other site contexts where multiple occupations may be
overprinted, as is common in terrace settings. From general ethnographic studies of huntergatherer groups, it is suspected that grave goods represent a sampling of utilitarian and
ornamental items used and possessed in life by those individuals, hinting at the social status and
personae of the deceased (Binford 1971), and a recognition that such burial goods would be
needed in the deceasedâs next life (Pertulla 2001).
In Central Texas, on the Edwards Plateau, burials in sinkholes and caves appear to be relatively
common (Kibler 2001). Below the escarpment, however, cemeteries are found along river
drainages and often contain mortuary goods. There appears to be an association of deer antler
and deer antler racks in late Middle Archaic and Late Archaic mortuary contexts. Evidence of
this association is primarily based on items recovered from large burials in riverine settings at
such sites as Loma Sandia (41LK28) in Live Oak County, Olmos Dam (41BX1) in the Blackland
Prairie below the Edwards Plateau escarpment in Bexar County, and Ernest Witte (41AU36)
along the lower Brazos River in Austin County (Perttula 2001).
Other features found at Late Archaic sites include basin hearths, arcuate hearths, earth ovens, and
mussel shell caches. The lithic assemblages contain a variety of dart point styles (e.g., Bulverde,
Pedernales-Kinney, Lange-Williams-Marshall, Marcos-Montell-Castroville, Ensor-Frio-Fairland,
and Darl); Erath, San Gabriel, and Hare bifaces; gravers; scrapers; a variety of unifaces and
16

bifaces; grinding stones; and boatstones. Except for Montell and Fairland, the point styles for the
Late Archaic are among the most widely distributed dart points (Prewitt 1985). Other artifacts
include ulna flakers, bone beads and awls, stone and marine shell gorgets, and freshwater mussel
shell pendants (Prewitt 1981:81â82).

Late Prehistoric
The Late Prehistoric period (1,200â750 B.P.) is marked by the replacement of atlatl-and-dart with
bow-and-arrow technology. Ceramics were also adopted within this period. Basin-shaped and
flat hearths and burned clay/charcoal lenses and pits are the predominant archeological features.
There is a continuation of Late Archaic burial practices with flexed and semi-flexed burials
occurring near habitation sites, usually in cemeteries but also as isolated occurrences. Some
burials were cremations, carried away from cemeteries and placed in shallow pits.
The period is divided into two main periods, the Austin (1,200â750 B.P.) and Toyah (750â450
B.P.), and each is marked by distinctive cultural traits. Once believed to be contemporaneous,
Jelksâs (1953, 1962) work at the Blum Rockshelter and the Kyle site demonstrated the temporal
separation between Austin and Toyah components by locating stratigraphically distinct Perdiz
arrow points above older Austin phase Scallorn arrow points. The Late Prehistoric chronology of
southern Texas is closely aligned with that of Central Texas, particular in terms of Toyah cultural
manifestations (Hester 1995:443).
The Austin phase is characterized by a shift to the use of the bow and arrow. Common are
Scallorn and other related side-notched (e.g., Edwards) arrow points, as well as broad-based
hunting and gathering as the main mode of subsistence (Turner and Hester 1999:173). Common
artifacts for this period include numerous bifaces, Clear Fork gouges, scrapers, grinding stones.
Typical features included basin hearths, pits, and cemeteries. The interments at Austin phase
cemeteries such as Loeve-Fox (41WM230; Prewitt 1981, 1974) and the Coleman site (41BX568;
Potter et al. 2005) show evidence of increased nutritional stress and social violence. In addition,
the mortuary program followed by Austin phase populations appears to contrast with that of the
Late Archaic period peoples in the area (Potter et al. 2005). There is less investment in mortuary
goods or personal adornment during this phase, and the antlers that occur in numerous Late
Archaic cemeteries are poorly represented in Late Prehistoric cemeteries.
The broad-based subsistence patterns of the Austin phase focused largely on gathering, though
hunting of deer along with exploitation of freshwater mussels and snails is also suggested to have
been important (Prewitt 1981:83; Ricklis and Collins 1994). The diagnostic projectile points of
the Austin period are the Scallorn and Granbury. Austin phase components have been found at
sites along waterways throughout Bexar County (e.g., Cibolo Creek [sites 41BX379, 41BX746,
41BX1005], Salado Creek [sites 41BX699, 41BX1007, 41BX1433]), the San Antonio River [site
41BX567] and the Medina River [sites 41BX1076, 41BX1104]) (Texas Archeological Sites
Atlas). Friday bifaces and unifaces, other bifaces, scrapers, ground stone, ulna flakers, and bone
awls are among the wide variety of tools. Other artifacts include painted stones, bone beads, and
marine shell beads and pendants. Projectile points are proportionately more common during the
Austin phase as hunting appears to have become increasingly important. The widespread
occurrence of Scallorn points outside of Central Texas and the frequency of marine shell indicate
a broad cultural entity and/or extensive trade networks in the Late Prehistoric.

17

The Toyah phase is the best known of the Late Prehistoric phases. It is distinct from the
preceding Austin phase and is marked archeologically by Perdiz and similar contracting-stem
arrow points, pottery, beveled-edge bifacial knives, perforators, and end scrapers (Black 1986,
1989, Creel 1991; Hester 1980, 1995; Jelks 1962; Johnson 1994; Kelley 1986; Prewitt 1981).
Perishable artifacts such as cordage and basketry are found at some sites. Corncobs have also
been recovered, indicating either trade relations with agricultural peoples or some degree of
horticulture (Prewitt 1981:74). Extensive trade relations are also indicated by the presence of
Caddo ceramics, such as Bullard Brushed among other imported types. Toyah phase burials
sometimes contain artifacts, but it is not established that these are grave goods. Perdiz and
Cliffton points found in burials may be from fatal wounds and indicative of increased conflict.
Sites in Bexar County associated with the Toyah phase have been recorded in Government
Canyon (e.g., 41BX133, 41BX141) and along Cibolo Creek (41BX372), the Medina River
(41BX528), and Culebra Creek (41BX1422, 41BX1423) (Texas Archeological Sites Atlas).
During the Toyah phase, a climatic shift to moister conditions allowed the savannas and
grasslands to advance, bringing the return of the bison. Subsistence strategies shifted even further
toward hunting in response to the reoccupation of Central Texas by bison (Dillehay 1974). Deer,
however, probably continued to be an important resource (Black and McGraw 1985). The
importance of bison to the Toyah economy is readily deduced from the makeup of artifact
assemblages represented at a number of archeological sites. The Buckhollow site (41KM16)
produced an abundance of Perdiz arrow points of many varieties (Johnson 1994). Also found
were Harahey knives, most of them containing four beveled edges. The use wear is
representative of cutting bison hides and fleshâa hypothesis supported by the recovery of large
numbers of bison bones. Also indicative of the importance of bison is the recovery of large end
scrapers from the site. The presence of edge rounding and polish on bit ends indicates use on
fresh hides, most of which were probably bison (Johnson 1994). The Hinojosa site (41JW8),
located in Jim Wells County in southern Texas, represents a Late Prehistoric Toyah base camp
dating from A.D. 1300â1500 (Black 1986). Specialized hunting adaptations are evident from the
archeological materials, though a broad subsistence base of fish, softshell turtle, aquatic birds,
and mussel shell was also exploited. Deer figured prominently in the overall assemblage, with
bison and pronghorn antelope also contributing a significant portion to overall subsistence (Black
1986). A significant component of the highly adaptive bison-oriented Toyah phase tool kit is the
end scraper used for processing hides. Creel (1991) has suggested that these tools are indicative
of the importance of trade in bison hides during the Late Prehistoric and Early Historic periods.
Bison bones occur in great frequency in many Late Prehistoric Toyah phase sites. Excavations at
41LK201 and 41MC222 along the Frio River drainage contained abundant bison bone, with the
latter site dating to around A.D. 1260â1290 (Hester 1980; Highley 1986).

HISTORIC CHRONOLOGY (A.D. 1500sâEARLY 1900s)

Historic Native American
The historic period (post-A.D. 1500) in Central Texas represents the local expression of sweeping
cultural change for native peoples across North America. Spanish missionization corresponds to
the first European influence in Texas, but it probably did not have dramatic effects until the 1600s
when native groups sought refuge at the missions from encroaching Apache and, later, Comanche
groups. Changes through gradual cultural adoption and exchange of Spanish life-ways and
18

materials occurred throughout the seventeenth century. After the 1700s, European material
culture became pervasive. Metal, glass, European clothing, and guns became important to native
peoples, replacing traditional items.
The early history of southern and Central Texas is the most richly documented in the state. The
numerous expeditions into these parts of the region resulted in records and journals that provide
sparse glimpses into the past of the native peoples. Nevertheless, limited ethnographic cultural
data exist for the native groups that occupied this immediate area preceding the establishment of
the missions. Campbell and Campbell (1996) present a list of the groups occupying Mission San
Juan and Mission Espada, as well as the other missions in the area. For many of the groups
listed; however, original territorial ranges can only be speculated, and their material culture
cannot be differentiated from other groups residing in the missions at the time. In the nineteenth
century, the term âCoahuiltecan,â for Coahuilteco, was coined by a Mexican linguist for a related
group of native languages in the region (Campbell and Campbell 1996:17). The name came from
the Mexican state of Coahuila, which included the northern part of New Spain and most of the
area occupied by present-day Texas. Over the last century, the term Coahuiltecan was widely
adopted for use in referring to the whole of the native groups living on the southern Texas plains
region and into Mexico. Although the term originally described a group of related languages, it
devolved into a common misinterpretation that was applied to a widespread ethnically related
culture believed to speak the same Coahuiltecan language. This terminology was far from
correct. In fact, the people who were subsumed under this umbrella term represented distinct
ethnic groups with distinct cultures and diverse languages and dialects (Hester 1998).
Few Historic Native American archeological sites have been investigated in the San
Antonio/Bexar County area. Supposed sites relating to the historic Indian contact period are
usually characterized by multiple components that span a long period of time. Since the historic
Indian period lasted only roughly 200 years, the material evidence occurs at shallow depths below
surface or entirely on the surface. Consequently, it is prone to modern disturbance. Stratigraphic
separation between the Late Prehistoric and Historic Native American contact components is
often limited or nonexistent. Excavations at site 41MC296, a historic native encampment on Elm
Creek in McMullen County, illustrate that European trade items were introduced to the South
Texas native peoples in advance of the Spanish entrada. Conversely, at the Olmos Dam site
(41BX1) in Bexar County, historic-era seasonal encampments made by native peoples traveling
the âPeyote Trailâ to northern Mexico were documented as late as the 1920s (Lukowski 1988).
Numerous river crossing sites with possible contact period components were identified during
historical research and survey for the Applewhite Reservoir in San Antonio. They include the
Dolores/Perez/Applewhite Crossing (41BX682); Pampopa/Paso del Talon (41BX680), one of the
documented crossings used by Native Americans prior to Spanish use; Sabinitas/Jett/Palo Alto
Crossing (41BX857); and Paso de las Garzas (41BX697) (Hindes 1992). Archeological
investigations were conducted at the Pampopa-Talon crossing site (41BX528), where important
roads connecting San Antonio to points along the Rio Grande pass over the Medina River.
Between 1731 and 1737, the Pampopa fled mission confinement and were pursued to their
rancherias near the âOld Fordâ of the Medina River. Historic accounts tell of encampments of
the Pampopa and other Indian groups nearby (Thoms and Ahr 1995). The Pampopa
Crossing/Ford has been positively identified at sites 41BX527 and 41BX528 on the Medina
River.

Spanish Exploration and Settlement
The initial European presence in Texas occurred in 1519 when Ãlvarez de PiÃ±eda mapped the
coastline of Texas under the order of Francisco Garay, then governor of Jamaica. PiÃ±eda laid
claim to all the land between Florida and the Rio Grande in the name of the Spanish Crown. His
explorations were followed by those of Alvar NÃºÃ±ez Cabeza de Vaca in the 1530s. Cabeza de
Vaca was a member of the 1527â1528 expedition of PÃ¡nfilo de NarvÃ¡ez, a large expedition
charged with surveying much of the land in the southeastern United States. While inland, the
NarvÃ¡ez group became separated from the ships. Because of hostile Indians and food shortages,
NarvÃ¡ez led his men in improvised watercrafts along the Gulf of Mexico coastline, hoping to
reach the PÃ¡nuco River. A hurricane destroyed most of the group, but shipwrecked a few of the
men, including Cabeza de Vaca, on the Texas coast, probably on present-day Galveston Island, in
1528. De Vaca lived among the coastal Indians for the next eight years. After being enslaved by
hostile Indians, he eventually made his escape, arriving at a Mexican outpost to the west in 1536.
He was the first non-Indian to wander through the Texas region, and his writings about his travels
are the first accounts of the area, generating excitement over the prospect of gold and leading to
subsequent Spanish expeditions to the region in search of the precious commodity. Soon,
Spanish authorities commissioned Francisco VÃ¡zquez de Coronado, governor of the Mexican
province of Nueva Galicia, to lead an expedition into the American Southwest in 1540 in search
of the fabled Seven (Golden) Cities of Cibola to the north (Fehrenbach 1968:23). The expedition
was a dismal failure in its attempt to find the legendary gold, but did succeed in exploring some
of Texas and New Mexico. In 1539, Hernando de Sotoâs expedition landed in present-day
Florida and over the next four years traveled across the southeastern United States. After de
Sotoâs death at the Mississippi River, Luis de Moscoso de Alvarado took command of the
expedition. By 1542, the Moscoso group had traveled as far west as Texas (Hester 1989:199) in
an attempt to reach New Spain (present-day Mexico).
As it became apparent that there were no cities of gold to exploit, settlement was somewhat
slowed until French interest in the region stimulated the Spanish to renew their colonizing efforts.
After word came in 1685 that Rene-Robert Cavelier, Sieur de La Salle, had established an outpost
somewhere on the Texas coast, the Spanish were motivated to send various expeditions to locate
and eradicate the outpost. The threat that the French presented became almost an obsession with
the Spanish:
The specter of French invasion brooded over the Spanish colony in New Mexico for nearly two centuries.
Somewhereâperhaps from the wilds of New France, perhaps from the coast of the Gulf of Mexico, at
some incalculable distanceâan indeterminable number of Frenchman were periodically thought to
threaten the silver mines of New Spain. . . . Beset with internal problems, woefully conscious of their
weakness and isolation, New Mexicans started at the very shadow of intruders on the vague periphery of
their province [John 1975:155].

This attitude encouraged the establishment of missions and presidios in East Texas to buffer
against further French encroachment into the region (Fox 1989:85).
Alonso de LeÃ³n mounted various expeditions into Texas between 1686 and 1690. In 1691,
Domingo TerÃ¡n was appointed governor of the province. He, accompanied by Padre Massanet,
set out to determine what French activities were occurring in the region and to establish a series
of missions among the Indians. In this pursuit, they came into the region of San Antonio, both
commenting on the fine plains and large numbers of buffalo they encountered (McGraw and
Hindes 1987:64). Padre Massanet called the area âSan Antonio de Paduaâ in honor of St.
20

Anthony of Padua and suggested that it would make a suitable location for a mission. A small
garrison of men was left there, and the Presidio of San Antonio de BÃ©xar was initiated (McGraw
and Hindes 1987:64). At least one source believes that the site of the presidio was initially called
âthe âlevel lands without woodsâ which . . . de TerÃ¡n and Massanet crossed when they continued
their journeyâ (Habig 1968:160).
Activities in the area were curtailed during the Eleven Yearsâ War of Spanish Succession (1702â
1713); but when the Frenchman Louis Juchereau de St. Denis traveled over much of the province
undetected in 1714, the Spanish were galvanized into action. A series of missions was planned
throughout the frontier areas of New Spain. For example, in 1716, an expedition led by Captain
Domingo RamÃ³n set out for East Texas to establish missions and a presidio, including one at a
site between the Red and Sabine rivers at Los Adaes (de la Teja 1988:51â51).
In response to the remoteness of the settlements in East Texas, the Spanish soon recognized that a
âway-stationâ was necessary to bridge the distance between the newly settled missions and San
Juan Bautista on the Rio Grande. The need for an intermediate location had been evident for
some time, and âTerÃ¡n . . . considered the upper San Antonio River valley, with its abundant
water supply, woods and agricultural land, the ideal site for missions and townsâ (de la Teja
1988:53). Of like mind was Fray Antonio de San Buenaventura Olivares who had been
impressed with the area during his visit in 1709. MartÃ­n de AlarcÃ³n, who had been recently
appointed as governor to the province, considered the opinions. It was decided that two missions
were to be founded: one on the San Antonio River and one on the San Colorado River, with the
former established first. The viceroy ordered not only missionaries and solders to populate the
new missions, but settlers and families, artisans, and livestock as well (de la Teja 1988:55).
The three-pronged approach that the Spanish used for settlementâwhich included presidio,
mission, and civilian settlementsâproved to be more successful than the establishment of
mission and presidio or presidio alone (Gilmore 1991). This was certainly true in the case of San
Antonio. On May 1, 1718, a group led by AlarcÃ³n and including Fray Olivares founded the
Mission San Antonio de Valero on San Pedro Creek, and on May 5, 1718, the presidio and the
villa of San Antonio de BÃ©xar were established. Although ceremonially the city was founded in
1718, no actual construction was begun until 1719 due to the lack of men and materials (McGraw
and Hindes 1987:66).
A total of five missions was eventually built on the San Antonio River, all within a 12-mile radius
of the present city of San Antonio. They are, in order of establishment: Mission San Antonio de
Valero (1718), Mission San JosÃ© (1720), Mission Nuestra SeÃ±ora de la PurÃ­sima ConcepciÃ³n
(1731), Mission San Juan de Capistrano (1731), and Mission San Francisco de la Espada (1731).
The last three had initially been established in East Texas, but were relocated to the San Antonio
River area. All of the missions in present-day San Antonio were administered by the order of
Saint Francis. San JosÃ© was under the authority of the College of Zacatecas, and the remaining
four were under the authority of the College of QuerÃ©taro. In 1773, all the San Antonio missions
were placed under the auspices of the College of Zacatecas (Jackson 1986:33). Each ministered
to different groups of Indians.
During the early 1700s, population growth was slow in the San Antonio area. Initially, most
inhabitants were members of military households. AlarcÃ³nâs first settlement had included âan
engineer, stone mason, blacksmith, and a number of women and childrenâ (de la Teja 1988:56).
Fray Celiz, the chronicler of the AlarcÃ³n expedition, noted that the first attempts in 1718 to locate
21

settlement sites were unsuccessful. A stable water supply for the missions was necessary for both
crop production and human and animal consumption. Because of the relatively arid San Antonio
environment, the missions needed an effective way to enhance the available water supply. The
Franciscans adopted a system of irrigation ditchesâcalled acequiasâintroduced into Spain by
Moslems, and began construction in 1719 on a 15-mile network of seven gravity-flow ditches,
five dams, and an aqueduct to distribute water to about 3,500 acres of cultivated land (NPS 2005).
The acequias are, in order of construction: Concepcion/Pajalache (1791), Alamo Madre (1724),
San Jose (1730), San Juan (1731), Espada (1731), San Pedro (ca. 1738), and Alazan (1872)
(Guerra 1987:17-21). Once the first of the acequias was operational, settlers âexpected a large
crop of maize, beans, and other produceâ (de la Teja 1988:57).
By 1721, San Antonio had become a series of wood and mud huts (jacales), typical of a Spanish
frontier settlement. All settlers, both military and civilian, were dependent on the garrison for
defense, communications, and, initially, civil administration. The missions of San Antonio
attracted a variety of Indian groups, primarily Coahuiltecan and Karankawan hunter-gatherers,
during the mid 1700s, but also attracted Indians of other origins, some of whom were fleeing
Spanish disruptions in Nuevo LeÃ³n and other regions of northern Mexico (Hester 1989:200).
However, not all Indian groups were interested in what the missions had to offer:
When our arms were first introduced in Texas, our foremost object was the propagation of faith, by the
means of evangelic predication; but, notwithstanding the endeavors and apostolic zeal of the Reverend
Missionaries, we could not succeed in gathering the Indians around the Missions. Used to a roving and
unrestrained life, the Nations of that extended territory refused to submit to the merciful yoke of the
Church, finding it rather burdensome, owning to their depraved habits. Unable to attract them to us of
their own free will, we never availed ourselves of force. . . . [Buquor 1935:2].

Mission settlements were disrupted frequently from 1721 to 1749 by raiding Apaches. Even after
a formal truce had been signed in 1749, thievery and limited hostilities took place throughout the
rest of the century (de la Teja 1988:61). Hostilities also were occurring with various Comanche
bands, who disapproved of the tentative link between the Spanish and the Apache during the last
half of the 1700s.
At the expense of the Spanish Crown, colonists from the Canary Islands had been sent to colonize
other areas with great success. The harsh economic conditions that existed on the islands,
coupled with the promise of land, made the islanders eager emigrants (de la Teja 1988:67). On
March 9, 1731, a group of colonists from the Canary Islands came to the area and were to have a
profound effect on the region. As originally conceived, an additional 400 islander families would
immigrate into the region. When it became apparent that this endeavor would be too costly, the
idea was abandoned and no additional families were ever recruited (de la Teja 1988:68). The
Canary Islanders were given control over lands previously allotted to the military settlers. They
also were given control over the town council and effectively barred established settlers from
participating in local government (de la Teja 1988:68). Eventually, local elections took place in
which the sitting council elected its successors. Although these elections were full of
irregularities, in the end they did provide a means by which new settlers could share in town
government.
Initially, town lots were only distributed among Canary Islanders. The distribution of land to the
islanders involves the first record of the San Antonio Town Tract (on which the city proper is
located). Captain Juan Antonio PÃ©rez de AlmazÃ¡n, who served as commander and superior
justice (justicia mayor) of San Antonio, began to lay the tract for the town of San Antonio in
22

1731. He had to work around the existing presidio and missions (de la Teja 1988:122) because,
in general, the land west of San Pedro Creek was considered less desirable because of its
vulnerability to Indian attack.
Population growth in the area continued at a steady rate due to a variety of factors and in part to
established access into the region via El Camino Real, also known as the Kingâs Highway or the
Old San Antonio Road. This âroadâ was not one fixed route, but one that altered with the season
and the year. San Antonio de BÃ©xar, as an established way-station, became a hub for the various
routes (McGraw and Hindes 1987).
Land use outside of BÃ©xar during the Spanish period was chiefly confined to large-scale ranching
activities. Ranching during the eighteenth century was very relaxed. Round-ups amounted to
little more than the gathering of wild, unbranded stock when meat or hide and tallow were needed
(McGraw and Hindes 1987:71). This lax attitude can be attributed primarily to the small
population and the lack of markets. However, some ranches in what is today Bexar County were
more productive (McGraw and Hindes 1987:72).
Outside political factors during the latter half of the eighteenth century had a great impact on the
region. The completion of the Seven Yearsâ War (1754â1762) and the signing of the Treaty of
Paris in 1763 resulted in the French and Spanish ceding most of the lands east of the Mississippi
River to England, and Spain acquiring the Louisiana Territory from France. This, of course, put
an end to the years of Spanish paranoia and called for a reassessment of the situation in New
Spain (McGraw and Hindes 1987:74). Local effects included the selection of BÃ©xar as the new
provincial capital.
The American Revolution encouraged economic growth in the region. Cattle from the ranches in
the BÃ©xar area were rounded up for sale in Louisiana to the Spanish who were fighting the British
along the Gulf Coast (McGraw and Hindes 1987). Another change in the region was the
beginning secularization of the missions by 1794. Secularizationâthe transition from mission
status into secular Spanish society, based on official royal decreeâwas in part a result of the
missionsâ decline in status as a response to the removal of the French threat. The second factor in
secularization was the decline of the missionsâ indigenous inhabitants in the 1790s as those
populations assimilated into Spanish society, achieving a major goal of the mission system,
through intermarriage or conversion to Christianity. Pressure from the surrounding civilians for
mission farmland (labores) increased as mission populations fell, and eventually secularization
was complete by 1824 as the last of the labores were privatized, divided, and distributed among
the remaining mission Indians and the local population (Reese 1995:K-9; Spanish Missions
2001).
Political events continued to have a rapid impact on the region. The Louisiana Purchase in 1803
brought about the establishment of a âno-manâs landâ between the Texas and Louisiana border.
Both Spain and America were eager to avoid a costly war. The Louisiana Purchase, however, did
generate increased American interest in Texas. Many from the former French province were
eager to emigrate:
In view of the fact that the said province has been retroceded to the French Republic and they have sold it
to the United States of America, numerous noble, influential, and rich families, as well as some poor
ones, desire to move to the provinces under your command in order that they might live under the
Spanish flag and enjoy the same kind treatment that they, as well as their predecessors, have previously
23

enjoyed. . . . the universal love and loyalty felt for the Spanish government is so great that we are satisfied
and believe there will be more than a thousand families, more than two hundred of them of the Spanish
nation, who will come as soon as they sell their lands . . . [Hatcher 1934:278].

This kind of attitude was not, however, prevalent throughout the Spanish colonies. Growing
discontent with Spanish rule (which had been rapidly deteriorating) in the provinces resulted in
10 bitter years of strife, beginning in 1810 and culminating with Mexican Independence in 1821.
These years had a profound effect in the region of what is today San Antonio. Filibusterers,
encouraged by the claim that Texas was actually American territory, made forays into the
province. In addition, battles were waged between Spanish loyalists and revolutionaries, and
control of San Antonio de BÃ©xar changed back and forth several times. In a particularly bloody
incident, 1,000 persons in the province who were, or were accused of being, revolutionaries were
rounded up and executed or exiled. Much of the improved farmland around BÃ©xar was left
fallow, and the town itself was almost abandoned because of the scarcity of food (Fehrenbach
1968:130).

Mexican Statehood
The period following Mexican Independence brought a slow improvement in the conditions
around San Antonio de BÃ©xar. Beginning in 1823, immigration laws were changed to allow
empresarios to offer lands to heads of families willing to settle in Texas. The policy had been
initially investigated by the Spanish as a means of securing its territory and providing a buffer
zone against Indian attack. In fact, Moses Austin had applied for and received permission to
bring American colonists to Texas in 1821, before Mexican Independence (Fehrenbach
1968:135). Austin had been granted the right to settle 300 families in Texas, but he never saw his
grant. By the time he returned to his home in Missouri, his health had broken, and before his
death he only had time to beg his son Stephen to carry out his plans (Fehrenbach 1968:136).
Stephen F. Austin willingly followed in his fatherâs footsteps, and because of the liberal land
policies, first of Spain and later of Mexico, he had many eager volunteers ready to accompany
him. Colonists had to have good moral character and were required to become Spanish (then
Mexican) citizens. They were also required to convert to Catholicism, although this requirement
was not rigorously enforced. Under Spanish/Mexican law, land was distributed as follows: one
labor (177 acres) to each family engaged in farming, one league (4,428 acres) to each family
engaged in ranching, and one-third league (1,476 acres) to each single rancher (Fehrenbach
1968:140). The government charged a flat title fee, and Austin received a fee. The law required
the land to be developed in two years or be forfeited. In all, 297 titles were issued, and only
seven were forfeited. Most of the settlers claimed to be ranchers for obvious reasons.
In San Antonio de BÃ©xar, local politics were affected by the Mexican Constitution of 1824.
Former Spanish provinces were turned into sovereign states, and Texas and Coahuila were
combined into one state with Saltillo named as its capital. The legislature of Coahuila passed its
own colonization laws in 1825. This continued to open up the area to Euro-American settlement,
and in all, there were some 26 empresarios in colonial Texas.
After a decade of empresarios, over 20,000 Euro-Americans, with their slaves, were in Texas.
The impact of this can be understood when realizing that the empresarios managed to settle more
of Texas in a decade than the government of Spain had settled in three centuries.
24

One of the effects of increased immigration was the opening and improvement of roadways,
many of which followed the earlier Spanish caminos. The influx of settlers into the region
brought changes in local politics as well, with Anglo-American immigrants gaining more power.
In many areas of Texas, Mexicans were becoming politically overshadowed by the new
immigrants. This situation alarmed the Mexican government, who passed the Decree of April 6,
1830, prohibiting the further âcolonization of Mexican territory by citizens of adjacent
countriesâmeaning the United Statesâ (Fehrenbach 1968:165). This decree also prohibited the
importation of slaves and further alienated the Anglo-American settlers.
From 1832 to 1835, a series of conflicts and temporary solutions continued to drive a wedge
between Texas and Mexico. When the Texans met in San Felipe de Austin in 1835, they adopted
resolutions and framed a state convention (to form a separate state from Coahuila). Shortly
afterward, when it became known that a Mexican army under Presidente Antonio LÃ³pez de Santa
Anna had crossed the Rio Grande bound for San Antonio de BÃ©xar to squelch the rebellious
Texans, a call to arms was issued, and hostilities were begun in earnest (Fehrenbach 1968:193).
Many of the conflicts of what would come to be known as the Texas Revolution were fought in
and around the modern city of San Antonio. These engagements culminated in the battle at the
Alamo (formerly Mission San Antonio de Valero) in the spring of 1836. At the same time that
the Alamo was under siege, elected representatives of the Texans were meeting at Washingtonon-the-Brazos, and on March 2, 1836, the Texas Declaration of Independence was signed. After
his victory at the Alamo, Santa Annaâs forces were defeated by the Texans at the Battle of San
Jacinto, and the Republic of Texas was born.

Texas Republic
In 1836, the Republic of Texas was a âbackwaterâ with about 40,000 residents, most of whom
were subsistence farmers. When elections were first held in 1836, the Texans voted
overwhelmingly to approve a union with the United States, but the issue of slavery stood in the
way of annexation for 10 years.
The government of the new Republic was a loosely organized affair. Among the many problems
facing the new Republic was the fact that â[t]here was no money economy, nor any money.
There were no banks or improved roads or organized schools. There was no industryâ
everything from pins to powder had to be imported from the United Statesâ (Fehrenbach
1968:247). The Texans quickly replaced the old Spanish/Mexican conventions with the more
familiar American ones.
Bexar County was formed in 1836, with a population that was predominantly Mexican.
However, the new Republic was eager to encourage immigration, and it did so by offering its
most abundant commodityâland. Travelers across the region wrote enthusiastic letters back
home.
Texas is certainly one of the finest countries in the world, the salubrity of her climate and the luxuriance
of her soil is beyond doubt unparalleled in the known world,âhere it seems to be one perpetual spring
[Hale 1836].

25

Under the Republic of Texas Constitution, settlers fell into one of three classes, which dictated
the disbursal of land:
First Classâarrived before March 2, 1836
Heads of Household: one league and one labor
Single Man: one-third league
Second Classâarrived between March 2, 1836, and October 1, 1837
Heads of Household: 1,280 acres (about one-third league)
Single Man: 640 acres
Third Classâarrived between October 1, 1837, and January 1, 1840
Heads of Household: 640 acres
Single Man: 320 acres.
The new settler to Texas had to find unclaimed land on his own and often would not be able to
procure land in his county of residency. The responsibility for providing witnesses who could
attest to the arrival date fell to the settler, as did the costs for the survey and filing fees. In most
counties, the Board of Land Commissioners went to work without delay because of the extreme
importance of land to the citizens. The later land laws established under the State of Texas were
set up in much the same way, but with land also being granted preemptively, through âsquattersâ
rights.â Land also was distributed in differing amounts for military service. âThus it, was
virtually impossible, theoretically, for a Texas family to be landlessâ (Fehrenbach 1968:283).
With the question of annexation to the United States unanswered, Mexico again laid claim to
Texas as part of its territories in 1837. During this period, San Antonio and Bexar County once
more became the setting for numerous hostilities between Mexican and Texan forces. Finally,
after truce had been declared in 1843, the question of annexing Texas was once again raised in
the U.S. Congress. By this time, sentiment had shifted in the United States, and on December 29,
1845, Texas was annexed officially.

American Statehood
The annexation of Texas by the United States brought about many changes in the region.
Commerce, which had faltered in the Republic period during hostilities with Mexico, improved.
San Antonio became a center for stagecoach travel into the region (McGraw and Hindes
1987:95). Immigration from the rest of the United States increased rapidly, as did the arrival of
refugees from abroad. The population became much more diversified with the organized
immigration of Alsatian, French, and German colonists. These colonists clustered in Castroville
and New Braunfels. From there the German colonists spread into the Balcones Escarpment
regions west and north of San Antonio including communities like Helotes and Leon Springs in
the study area (McNatt et al. 2000:29). One interesting fact relating to San Antonio is that âby
1850, and for many years afterward, European, mostly German, immigrants in San Antonio
outnumbered both Mexicans and Anglosâ (Fehrenbach 1968:285).
During the early years of statehood, the San Antonio region continued to be âAnglicized.â This
was true in all areas and was demonstrated by a growing use of more âAngloâ types of
architecture and building materials. In San Antonio itself, small businesses thrived and fledgling
industries developed.

26

Military exploration of the lands west of San Antonio was necessary to open the west to trade and
settlement. The military exploration and presence also served to defend the frontier and enable
military personnel and civilians to identify and claim tracts of land to the west. The military was
charged in 1849 with finding a suitable road for commerce between San Antonio to El Paso. The
route identified followed the well established Pinta Trail that connected San Antonio to
Fredericksburg, Presidio San Saba, and eventually El Paso. This was known as the upper route
and present day IH 10 West now follows this historic road (Freeman 1994). The lower route
followed a more southerly route and passed over the Devils, Nueces, Frio, and Seco rivers before
arriving in San Antonio from El Paso.
In Texas, the political situation, like that throughout the United States, was uneasy during the
1850s. When the rest of the South seceded from the Union in 1860â1861, the state of Texas
voted overwhelmingly to follow. In general, the region around San Antonio fared better that
most during the Civil War. When San Antonio was named the headquarters for the Cavalry of
the West in 1864, some of the smaller communities actually benefited from this posting as a
result of the increased travel through the region (McGraw and Hindes 1987:99).
The initial years after the Civil War, however, brought several setbacks in the region. Much of
the area had suffered from a severe drought in 1863. In some areas where slaves once had
worked large plantations, tenant farming became the norm. In the latter years of the century, land
speculation seemed to be very common.

27

CHAPTER 4
METHODS

Prior to conducting fieldwork, archival research was conducted in order to ascertain if any
historical acequias or aqueducts were associated with the project area. All resources indicated
that the acequias, with one exception, were associated with the early Spanish missions and the
San Antonio River, paralleling a 15 mile course along the river, a substantial distance east of the
project area. The only acequia not found to be associated with the San Antonio River was the
Alazan. Although it originated at San Pedro Springs, as did the San Pedro acequia, the Alazan
acequia flowed south and west, irrigating land west of San Pedro Creek, before merging with
Alazan Creek. Although it was the most westerly acequia documented, the Alazan was
nonetheless far removed from the project area, being located some 7 miles north-northeast
(Corner 1890:49-50, Guerra 1987:17-21; Hutson 1898:43-46; NPS 2010). By the time Frederick
Law Olmsted, the father of American landscape architecture, visited San Antonio in 1856, the
acequia system had largely been abandoned (Fort Tours Systems 2010). By the end of the
nineteenth century, an underground water system had largely replaced the acequia system. The
one exception, the Espada Dam and acequia, is still in use today and is a Registered National
Historic Landmark (NPS 2010; San Antonio Water System 2010). It should be reiterated that the
Espada Dam and acequia is approximately 7 miles east of the project area.
In addition, several maps, both historical and contemporary, were consulted specifically in
regards to the presence of acequias or aqueducts within the project area. The Bexar County
Landowner Map of 1896 notes the acequias related to the early Spanish missions, but does not
indicate any man-made water features in the vicinity of the project area (Historical Maps
Restored 2007). A slightly later map notes the Alamo Madre, San Pedro and Upper Labor
Ditches (acequias), but does not extend as far southwest as the project area (Hutson 1898:42, 44).
Given the importance of the acequia to the development of the San Antonio area, it is reasonable
to assume that had other acequia or aqueduct systems been in use in the region they would have
also been noted. A 1986 Texas County Highway Map is also void of any reference to acequias
or aqueducts in the project area (TxDOT 1986). The first reference to an aqueduct near the
project area is found on the 1992 USGS 7.5â Terrell Wells Quadrangle (USGS).
The Texas Archeological Sites Atlas was consulted to determine if any previously recorded sites
or National Register-listed properties occur within a 1-mile radius of the project area. No sites
were found within the project right-of-way, although four sites (41BX598, 41BX704, 41BX1690,
29

and 41BX1815) are within the 1-mile radius. No National Register-listed properties are shown
within the 1-mile radius of the project right-of-way. A number of previous archeological project
are shown within the 1-mile radius. During the San Antonio 201 Wastewater project five pipeline
routes (including the existing pipeline parallel to the project right-of-way) were surveyed and test
excavations were undertaken at site 41BX333 (Snavely et al. 1983). The survey for the Kelly
Parkway corridor study between US 90 and SH 16 was conducted in 2004, with two isolated
finds and a trash scatter identified. One prehistoric site was found during the survey (Ahr 2004).
During 2009, SWCA Environmental Consultants undertook a survey for the Leon Creek Hike and
Bike Trail. A previously recorded site, 41BX598, was not relocated and one site, 41BX1815
(described below), was identified during the survey (Galindo 2010). In addition, two projects
were conducted in 2002 and 2005 for private clients by South Texas Archeological Research
Services; unfortunately, there are no abstracts for these projects in the Texas Archeological Sites
Atlas.
In addition, several historic maps and aerial photographs were examined that showed the recent
history of the project right-of-way. The 1940 General Highway Map of Bexar County was
examined. Quintana Road, New Laredo Highway, and Somerset Road are visible on this map,
but Edwards Schlundt Road, Plumnear Road, IH-35, and IH-410 are not illustrated. No structures
are illustrated anywhere near the project area on this map (Texas State Highway Department
1940). Edwards Schlundt and Plumnear roads are shown on a 1955 aerial photograph of the
project area. The buildings shown near the project along Edwards Schlundt Road are likely the
same as today, while the housing development along Plumnear Road appears to be under
construction in 1955 (HistoricAerials 2010a). A 1973 aerial shows some changes from the 1955
aerial: IH-35 and IH-410 are present, the existing SAWS pipeline is visible in some areas, a
trailer park is now just west of the right-of-way along Somerset Road, another trailer park is
present in the northwest corner of the intersection of Edwards Schlundt Road and IH-35, and the
trailer park west of Plumnear Road is also in existence (HistoricAerials 2010b). The 1986 aerial
photograph shows some interesting alterations. A road parallels the existing SAWS pipeline from
Somerset Road to IH-410 and for much of the distance from New Laredo Highway southward to
Leon Creek. This probably served as an access road for the pipeline. A network of roads and
bare areas west of the right-of-way between IH-410 and Leon Creek probably indicate an early
incarnation of the Custom Crushed Stone quarry currently in this area. All three trailer parks are
still in existence (HistoricAerials 2010c). Finally, a 2004 aerial was examined, with the
anomalous roads paralleling the pipeline no longer visible, and the trailer park along Somerset
Road has disappeared. The network of roads and bare areas has expanded greatly and now
occupies much of the area between Leon Creek and IH-410 (HistoricAerials 2010d). Google
Earth also provides some historic depth in its imagery. The earliest aerial photograph is from
1995; it shows no significant changes from the 1986 aerial photograph. On the 2002 imagery, the
trailer parks off Somerset and Plumnear roads are gone, but the remainder of the project right-ofway is little changed from the 1995 imagery. Other imagery dated 2003, 2004, 2005, and 2006
show no significant changes from the 2002 imagery.
During the pedestrian survey each side of the project right-of-way was traversed. Surface
inspection was utilized where possible, with a total of 15 shovel tests being judgmentally placed
across the project area. Each shovel test was approximately 35 cm in diameter and was excavated
in 20 cm arbitrary levels to subsoil or to a minimum of 80 cm. Soils removed from the shovel
tests were processed through 6.35 mm (Â¼ in) hardware cloth. The results of each shovel test and
backhoe trench were recorded on standardized forms. Digital photographs were used to record
the survey conditions, shovel tests, backhoe trenches, and any archeological site or deposits
30

encountered. A description of each photograph was recorded on standardized forms. Two
backhoe trenches were dug along Leon Creek and a third in the terrace deposts overlooking Leon
Creek in order to better view the deep sediments in these areas.
For this survey, a site is defined on the basis of content and extent. When a shovel test yields
cultural material, additional shovel tests are excavated in the cardinal directions in a cruciform
pattern at 5-m (16.5-ft) intervals around the initial test until two sterile shovel tests are
encountered. A site is then defined within the extent of positive shovel tests. For surficial
materials, a site is defined as five or more cultural items of at least two different artifact materials
or classes (e.g., prehistoric stone tool manufacturing debris exhibiting different raw materials, or
manufacturing debris in combination with stone tools; or historic-era ceramics [or glass] of
several different types, or ceramics in addition to glass) within a 20-m (65.6-ft) square. Cultural
remains meeting these criteria are designated as a site, recorded on a Texas Archeological Site
Data Form, and submitted to the Texas Archeological Research Laboratory (TARL) in Austin for
a permanent trinomial. Conversely, the discovery of one or two cultural items (either surface or
subsurface) not meeting these criteria is considered an isolated occurrence of human activity and
is simply documented by location and content; likewise, historic-era material representing an
obvious single-event trash dump is not considered a site, with only location and content
documented.
Although no artifacts were collected and thus none require curation, all notes, forms, and
photographs obtained during this project will be curated at Center for Archeological Research
(CAR) at the University of Texas at San Antonio.

RESULTS

The pedestrian survey found that large portions of the project area were disturbed by cut-and-fill
operations and by recent construction and demolition. A total of 15 shovel tests was dug during
the pedestrian survey; all of which proved sterile. In addition, three backhoe trenches were dug to
determine whether deeply buried deposits were present. No indication of a buried A horizon was
noted. The only artifacts observed during the trenching were concrete fragments associated with
fill deposits in the upper two strata of Backhoe Trench 3. In addition, background research was
undertaken to determine if the âaqueductâ shown on the Terrell Wells 7.5â quadrangle map was
associated with historic irrigation features.

AQUEDUCT
The USGS 7.5â Terrell Wells quadrangle (1992) shows a feature labeled âaqueductâ that largely
coincides with the project right-of-way between New Laredo Highway and IH-410. The
âaqueductâ begins near the intersection of Plumnear Road and New Laredo Highway and extends
southeasterly to a sewage disposal plant near the confluence of Leon and Comanche creeks. No
surface channels were noted in the project area, nor were any architectural features noted at the
three Leon Creek crossings. While consulting the Texas Archeological Sites Atlas, it was noted
that the âaqueductâ also largely coincides with a linear survey area marked for the San Antonio
201 Wastewater project. Given these lines of evidence, combined with fact that no references to
additional acequia or aqueduct systems in the San Antonio area was found during the archival
research, it appears that the âaqueductâ in fact represents the existing sewer line paralleled by the
project right-of-way.

PEDESTRIAN SURVEY
The southern end of the project right-of-way begins along the IH-410 frontage road (see Figure 2)
and proceeds in a northeasterly direction toward Leon Creek. A dirt road leading eastward from
the Custom Crushed Stone headquarters divides this segment roughly in half. The landform in
this area is very disturbed, as it is very irregular, with many mounds and windrows of fill visible
(Figures 3 and 4). Likely this is a result of mining activities by Custom Crushed Stone. Near

Leon Creek, a manhole was noted with the concrete slab standing approximately 50 cm above the
current land surface (Figure 5). In view of this high level of disturbance, no shovel testing was
conducted in this area.

The dumping has extended to the terrace edge where large pieces of concrete were noted along
the terrace scarp (Figure 6). The soil profile exposed in the south bank of Leon Creek appears to
represent Frio soils (Figure 7). It consists of a very dark grayish brown clay loam 20 cm thick
that is underlain by a yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) clay from 20-40 cm below surface. This in
turn, was underlain by a brown (10YR 4/3) clay containing many gravels. The cutbank was
examined to see if any artifacts were exposed; however, only modern materials (a clear glass jar
and beer cans) were found embedded in the upper strata. This material is thought to be flotsam
introduced during flooding along Leon Creek. The north bank of Leon Creek has been eroded
down to the gravel layer (Figure 8). Once again, the terrace scarp is covered with fill deposits
(Figure 9). Concrete and other rubble from the fill deposits were noted in the Leon Creek flood
plain.
Much of the area between Somerset Road and Leon Creek has been disturbed. Starting at
Somerset Road, the right-of-way first crosses the site of an abandoned trailer park (Figure 10). A
paved road is present inside the trailer park (see Figure 2) and much of the area has been
disturbed. One sterile shovel test was placed in the apparently undisturbed area between the
trailer court and Somerset Road. After leaving the trailer park, the right-of-way crosses a
relatively level fallow field covered with tall grasses. Fill has been dumped on the surface of this

field east of the right-of-way (Figure 11) and there is a dirt road at the south end of the fallow
field. Three shovel tests were excavated in the field; although the area appeared to retain good
contextual integrity, all three shovel tests proved sterile. Massive fill deposits approximately 2 m
thick begin in the treeline south of the dirt road (Figure 12). These deposits continue unabated to
the terrace scarp north of Leon Creek. In view of the fill deposits, no shovel tests were placed in
this area.
The short segment between Somerset Road and the IH-35 frontage road is covered with short
grasses and hardwood trees. Considerable recent dumping had occurred in this area (Figure 13),
so only one shovel test was dug in this segment; it was sterile.
After crossing IH-35, the right-of-way will follow Edwards Schlundt Road toward Leon Creek
(see Figure 2). Edwards Schlundt Road is narrow â only one lane (10 m; 30 ft) wide (Figure 14).
The east side of Edwards Schlundt Road is a pasture, while the west side begins with an
abandoned trailer park (now used to sell used trailers) and then enters another pasture. The

project right-of-way leaves Edwards Schlundt Road when it turns eastward to follow Leon Creek.
The right-of-way then proceeds downslope to cross Leon Creek (Figure 15). There were a large
number of cobbles visible on the ground surfaces along Edwards Schlundt Road. Three shovel
tests were excavated along Edwards Schlundt Road; all three proved sterile.
The Leon Creek flood plain below Edwards Schlundt Road is open and grass covered (see Figure
15). One sterile shovel test was excavated in the flood plain. Backhoe Trench 1 was also dug in
the flood plain (Table 3; Figure 16). No artifacts were discovered while digging this trench.
After crossing Leon Creek, the right-of-way climbs another steep terrace scarp; once again,
concrete was found dumped along the scarp (Figure 17), but not in the dense quantities noted
previously. On top of the terrace, the right-of-way crosses a soccer field. The soccer field
appears to be in a bowl shaped depression (Figure 18) with berms along the southeast and
northeast sides. These berms appear to artificial in nature (Figure 19). The soccer field exhibited
excellent ground surface visibility, estimated at 70 to 80 percent; however, no cultural materials

were observed except for recent debris (such as plastic water bottles and glass beer bottles). One
shovel test was excavated at the edge of the soccer field overlooking Leon Creek, but it proved
sterile.
More fill deposits approximately 1.2 m thick (Figures 20 and 21) were found between the soccer
field and New Laredo Highway. One structure, a guardhouse, was noted near the edge of the
right-of-way (Figure 22). Although the fill deposits are leveled in the project right-of-wy, other
deposits east of the right-of-way are more mounded (Figure 23). A shovel test was place in a
small area with intact deposits on the west edge of the right-of-way; modern plastic and asphalt
shingle fragments were found at the surface, but no other materials were discovered.

The project area will parallel the south side of New Laredo Highway for a short distance (see
Figure 2). The south side of the highway right-of-way is currently used as a road to the soccer
field (Figure 24); the existing sewer pipeline and a fiber optic cable have also been placed in this
area. A water meter or valve box standing approximately 30 cm above ground surface was noted
at the south edge of the highway right-of-way, indicating that the original ground surface has
been removed from this area (Figure 25).
After crossing New Laredo Highway, the project right-of-way will cross the north highway rightof-way and a small portion of privately-held land before once again crossing Leon Creek (Figure
26, see Figure 2). Disturbances noted in the highway right-of-way include a mound of fill and
bulldozing along the fenceline (Figure 27). One shovel test was excavated in the highway rightof-way, but it proved sterile. Many cobbles were visible on the surface of the pasture north of the
fence. Push-piles or dumploads of fill were noted on the terrace scarp in this area (Figure 28).
Backhoe Trench 3 was excavated on the privately-held land in order to determine if deeply buried
deposits might be present on this landform (Table 4, Figures 29 and 30). The upper two strata
appear to be fill deposits, as a piece of concrete was found at the contact between them and the
underlying subsoil.
Backhoe Trench 2 was dug on the east bank of Leon Creek (Table 5, Figure 31; see Figure 2).
No artifacts were observed during the trenching. The terrace scarp east of Leon Creek has also
seen considerable dumping (Figure 32), which continued onto the terrace edge (Figure 33). A
shovel test excavated in this area confirmed that the disturbance is not confined to the surface

(Figure 34). A series of concrete slabs and foundations was first encountered near the northern
edge of the project right-of-way (Figures 35, 36, and 37). Two shovel tests were dug at the edge
of the right-of-way near these features; both exhibited disturbed soils. The features appear to be
related to a series of buildings and ponds that first appear on the 1986 aerial photograph, but not
on the earlier 1973 aerial photograph (HistoricImages 2010b, c). The structures are also visible
on 1996 imagery provided by Google Earth, but are no longer visible on 2002 imagery. In view
of the recent age of these structures, they are interpreted as a non-site locality.
Another abandoned trailer park is on the west side of Plumnear Road (see Figure 2). This
property is not shown on the 1955 aerial photograph, but is present on the 1973 aerial photograph
(HistoricAerials 2010a, b). It is still visible on 1995 imagery available from Google Earth, but
was removed on the 2002 imagery. Construction and/or demolition of the trailer park had
significant effects on the area (Figures 38 and 39).

with Quintana Road (Figure 40). Both sides of Plumnear Road are affected by utility
construction. The right-of-way then turns northeast on Quintana Road; a deep ditch is present on
the south side of Quintana, while the north side has been affected by utility and railroad
construction (Figures 41 and 42).

SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS

The pedestrian survey showed that much of the project right-of-way has been disturbed by cutand-fill episodes, dumping, and recent construction and demolition. Fifteen shovel tests were
judgmentally placed in areas thought to retain good contextual integrity; although the shovel
testing identified small areas with good contextual integrity, no culural deposits were discovered
during shovel testing. A series of recent concrete slabs and foundations was noted near the north
edge of the project right-of-way between Plumnear Road and Leon Creek. Historic aerial
photographs indicate that these features were constructed sometime between 1973 and 1986;
furthermore, shovel testing in this area showed that extensive disturbance has occurred.
Consequently, these features are interpreted as non-site localities. Three backhoe trenches were
dug to determine the potential for buried cultural deposits along Leon Creek and in the upland
surrounding New Laredo Highway. No indication of buried cultural deposits was found in the
trenching.
In addition, background research was undertaken to clarify the significance of the âaqueductâ
shown on the USGS Terrell Hills 7.5' quadrangle map near the project right-of-way. No
indication was found that the early historic irrigation systems extended into this area. No surface
channels were noted during the survey nor were any architectural features noted at the Leon
Creek crossings. The âaqueductâ closely follows the project right-of-way between New Laredo
Highway and IH-410 and ends at a sewage disposal plant to the southeast. In view of these
factors, it appears that the âaqueductâ represents the existing sewer pipeline paralleling the
project right-of-way.
As a result, it is recommended that the proposed construction will not have an effect on
significant cultural deposits in the project right-of-way. However, should cultural deposits be
encountered during the construction, construction should cease and the Texas Historical
Commission notified.
