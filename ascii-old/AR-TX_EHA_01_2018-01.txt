Cultural Resource Monitoring for the Oncor Electric Delivery Company Lufkin to
Crockett 138 kV Rebuild Project, Houston and Angelina Counties, Texas.
I. PROJECT DESCRIPTION

On behalf of Oncor Electric Delivery (Oncor) Atkins North America Inc. (Atkins) conducted cultural
resources investigations that included monitoring of the Lufkin to Crockett 138 kV Transmission Line
Rebuild within Angelina and Houston Counties, Texas (Figure 1). Oncor plans to rebuild and upgrade the
existing 138 kV transmission line between the Lufkin SW Station, northwest of Keltys, in Angelina County,
Texas, and the Crockett Substation, north of Crockett, in Houston County. The proposed rebuild is
approximately 69.2 kilometers (km; 43 miles) long with approximately 31.4 km (19.5 miles) (Figure 1).
The proposed project will consist of the installation of a new double circuit 138 kV line on concrete and
steel monopoles within the existing Oncor right-of-way (ROW) between the Lufkin SW Station and the
Crockett Substation. The existing structures on the Lufkin to Crockett transmission line consist of wooden
H-frames. Most of the poles will be directly embedded with footings averaging about 1.5 meters (m) (5
feet [ft]) in diameter and about 7.6 m (25 ft) deep. Poles with anchor bolted footings will require
foundations averaging 2.3 m (7.5 ft) in diameter and 10.7 m (35 ft) deep. The ROW for the Lufkin to
Crockett transmission line is 30.5 m wide (100 ft)
An examination of the proposed rebuild line on the USGS 7.5-minute quad maps showed that the line
crosses 52 drainages large enough to appear on the maps. A check of the surface geology and soils at
these locations showed that most are located on small upland drainages with narrow floodplains and little
or no alluvial deposition. However, six of these drainages are thought to be large enough to have a high
likelihood of containing previously unrecorded buried archeological sites (Hurricane Creek, Cochino
Bayou, the Neches River, Bodan Creek, Rowan Creek, and Crawford Creek). As a result, Atkins believed
that monitoring was needed for those structure foundations that are located within these six floodplain
areas.
II. METHODS
The field methods involved monitoring the excavation of each new foundation. The diameter of the
foundation holes ranged from about 0.6 m (ca. 24 inches) to 2.4 m (96 inches), depending on the structure
and the location of the pole. The sediment removed from the foundation hole by the auger was examined
for any cultural material that may have been impacted by excavation. The stratigraphy of each foundation
hole was observed and recorded, within safety limits, to identify strata with a high probability for
containing cultural resources. Whenever possible, depths were measured from the ground surface or

1

estimated based on the depth of the auger. Digital photos and notes were taken to document each
foundation hole. Sediment color was recorded when possible using Munsell Soil Color Charts.
Profiles were initially described in “Zones,” and were only subsequently differentiated between perceived
pedologic features. The nature of the foundation holes prevented precise definition of zone boundaries,
and zones were limited to gross determinations based on the removed deposits. Additional soils
information was obtained from the soil survey for Angelina and Houston Counties (United States
Department of Agriculture, Soil Conservation Service Web Soil Online ([USDA, SCS] 2018).
III. RESULTS
Records Review
A review of the files and maps at the Texas Archeological Research Laboratory (TARL), the THC’s on-line
Restricted Archeological Sites Atlas, TXDOT’s database of NRHP-listed and -eligible bridges, and the
National Park Service’s National Register of Historic Places (NRHP) database and GIS Spatial Data, as well
as the National Historic Landmarks Program identified 3 previously recorded archeological sites
(41HO182, 41HO193, 41AG201), the El Camino Real de los Tejas National Historic Trail as well as the
Crawford (Rowan) Cemetery as being crossed by the Lufkin – Crockett 138-kV rebuild. An additional 23
previously recorded archeological sites and cultural resources were identified within 1 km. of the rebuild
(Table 1).

Of the resources crossed by the rebuild, of particular concern is the Crawford (Rowan) Cemetery.
According to the Texas Health and Safety Code:
§ 711.035. EFFECT OF DEDICATION.
(a) Property may be dedicated for cemetery purposes, and the dedication is permitted in respect for the
dead, for the disposition of remains, and in fulfillment of a duty to and for the benefit of the public.
(b) Dedication of cemetery property and title to the exclusive right of sepulture of a plot owner are not
affected by the dissolution of the cemetery organization, nonuse by the cemetery organization,
alienation, encumbrance, or forced sale of the property.
(c) Dedication of cemetery property may not be invalidated because of a violation of the law against
perpetuities or the law against the suspension of the power of alienation of title to or use of property.
(d) A railroad, street, road, alley, pipeline, telephone, telegraph, electric line, or other public utility or
thoroughfare may not be placed through, over, or across a part of a dedicated cemetery without the
consent of:
(1) the directors of the cemetery organization that owns or operates the cemetery; or
(2) at least two-thirds of the owners of plots in the cemetery.
(e) All property of a dedicated cemetery, including a road, alley, or walk in the cemetery:
(1) is exempt from public improvements assessments, fees, and public taxation; and
(2) may not be sold on execution or applied in payment of debts due from individual owners and
plots.

3

(f) Dedicated cemetery property shall be used exclusively for cemetery purposes until the dedication is
removed by court order or until the maintenance of the cemetery is enjoined or abated as a nuisance
under Section 711.007.
Acts 1989, 71st Leg., ch. 678, § 1, eff. Sept. 1, 1989. Amended by Acts 1993, 73rd Leg., ch. 634, § 16, eff.
Sept. 1, 1993.
Additionally, even if Oncor is able to obtain permission through (d)(1) or (d)(2), the Texas Historical
Commission will likely not let the rebuild proceed in the vicinity of the cemetery without confirming that
human remains do extend beyond the cemetery boundary into the ROW.
Monitoring
A total of 45 towers were selected for monitoring along the Lufkin-Crockett rebuild. Of these, 28 have
been monitored by Atkins employees (5/2, 5/3, 5/4, 5/5, 8/3, 8/4, 8/5, 8/6, 8/7, 9/7, 9/8, 9/9, 10/1, 10/2,
10/3, 10/4 ,12/1, 12/2, 12/3, 12/4, 12/5, 12/6, 12/8, 12/9, 13/1, 13/2, 13/3, 13/4). During the monitoring
effort the area experienced substantial and frequent rainfall. Tower locations in the Neches river
floodplain were often heavily saturated or even under water (Figures 2 and 3). These tower locations were
often augered using casings and slurry much earlier than most of the other tower excavations, making
monitoring difficult. During the project, only a single tower was observed to contain cultural material
(12/6). This site, 41AG246, is a possible prehistoric campsite.

Site 41AG246
Site 41AG246 is a prehistoric camp site located on a terrace within the Neches River floodplain (Figure 4).
The site is estimated to be 190 feet above mean sea level. The nearest reliable source of water is the
Neches river approximately 500m (0.3 miles)west. The soil at the site is mapped as Beinville loamy fine
sand 0 to 5 percent slopes (USDA, NRCS 2018). The auger revealed a strong brown (7.5 YR 6/6) sandy loam
from surface to approximately 1m (3.3 ft) over fine sand to approximately 7 m (23 ft)(figure 4). The
vegetation at the site was predominantly pasture grasses with some pine forest north of the ROW.
A few bits of carbon and a fragment of ground stone were observed in the auger back dirt within a range
of depth of approximately 2 m (6.6 ft) to 3 m (9.8 ft) below surface. The carbon, approximately 0.2 cm

6

(0.08 inches(in)) in diameter, was observed first,. The carbon was not photographed as it was destroyed
during the identification process. The ground stone was found in the back dirt the next run. The
groundstone was approximately 4 cm (1.6 in) by 4 cm (1.6 in) along its longest edges and 1.5 cm (0.6 in)
thick, made of hematitic sand stone. Grinding was only observed on one surface; no grinding was observed
along the narrower edges. It also appears that the stone was broken from a larger tool (Figure 5).
The size of the site is limited to the area impacted by the auger excavation approximately 1.5 m (5 ft) in
diameter. No additional work was conducted outside this area.
Site 41AG246 represents a portion of a possible prehistoric campsite. The terrace on which the site is
located is large and well developed. This land form has a high probability of harboring intact cultural
resources. The depth of the deposit is beyond most common modern disturbances allowing for a greater
possibility for intact deposits. While these finding do not appear to warrant National Register of Historic
Places (NRHP) eligibility status, if further excavations were to be conducted at the location caution should
be taken. Currently, surficial and shallow activity within the project ROW dose not warrant further
investigation.

IV. SUMMARY
During the monitoring of 28 towers on the Lufkin to Crockett rebuild, a single cultural site (41AG246) was
located. Based on observations of the site, at the time of excavation, there was nothing to indicate intact
cultural resources. The paucity of artifacts and lack of observable features at tower 12/6 suggests that
41AG246 does not warrant NRHP eligibility. The rest of the monitored towers had no impact on cultural
resources due to the absence of cultural material, the records review, and a site file review..
Oncor Electric Delivery is in full compliance with General Condition 12 for Historic Properties, under
Nationwide Permit 12 for Utility Line Activities for the poles monitored by Atkins.
