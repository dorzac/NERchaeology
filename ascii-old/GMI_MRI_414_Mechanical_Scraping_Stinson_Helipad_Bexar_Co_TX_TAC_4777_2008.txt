ABSTRACT

Reynolds, Smith and Hills, Inc. (RS&H), contracted with Geo-Marine, Inc. (GMI), to conduct
archeological investigations for a proposed training helipad and a new taxiway inside Stinson
Municipal Airport in San Antonio, Bexar County, Texas. The location of the proposed helipad is
immediately west of a marked historic paupers’ cemetery (site 41BX789). The boundaries of the
cemetery have not been clearly defined, and unmarked burials have been encountered on the
property in the past. Likewise, the southern portion of the proposed taxiway occurs in the general
vicinity of the airport where graves have been discovered, as well as in an area where archival
evidence indicates a possibility for burials. Because of the proximity of the proposed
construction projects to the known burials, archeological investigations were conducted in these
areas to determine if unmarked human graves were present. Eight backhoe trenches, totaling
0.035 acre in area, were carefully scraped in the proposed 90-foot-by-90-foot (0.186-acre) area of
potential effects for the proposed helipad, and seven trenches encompassing 0.031 ac were
excavated along the roughly 0.321-acre proposed taxiway. No evidence of burials was observed.
Based on these observations and results of previous investigations near the proposed taxiway, the
probability for human interments within these areas is extremely low. It is recommended that the
helipad project be allowed to proceed without further archeological investigation. However, in
the event that existing lights and utility lines at the south end of the proposed taxiway have to be
relocated, an archeological monitor is recommended.
No sites were recorded and no artifacts were retrieved as a result of this fieldwork; however,
photographs and notes were compiled. All files concerning this project will be permanently
curated at the Center for Archaeological Research, University of Texas at San Antonio.

CHAPTER 1
INTRODUCTION

Reynolds, Smith and Hills, Inc. (RS&H), of Houston, Texas, contracted with Geo-Marine, Inc.
(GMI), to conduct an archeological investigation for a proposed training helipad and taxiway
inside Stinson Municipal Airport in San Antonio, Bexar County, Texas. The proposed
improvements occur near a marked historic paupers’ cemetery (site 41BX789), and a potential
exists for unmarked burials to occur within the construction areas. On January 30–February 1
and February 19–20, 2008, GMI osteologist and cemetery specialist Angela Tiné monitored
mechanical scraping of these areas to identify any human burials that might be impacted by the
planned construction. Ms. Tiné and Melissa Green, also of GMI, served as principal investigators
for the project. The results of the investigations are presented in the following report (GMI
project number 30595.00.01).

PROJECT AREAS AND PROPOSED IMPACTS
Two specific areas were investigated. Both occur within the western half of Stinson Municipal
Airport in San Antonio, Bexar County, Texas (Figure 1). The proposed helipad site (Figure 2) is
approximately 240 feet (ft) south of Runway 9 and 280 ft east of Roosevelt Avenue. The actual
helipad will measure 35-by-50 ft; however, an area of up to 90-by-90 ft will likely be impacted by
construction, resulting in an area of potential effects (APE) of 8,100 square feet (sq ft). In
addition, an existing entrance road (Figure 3) that extends from 99th Street southward to Taxiway
D and Runway 9 will be widened and converted to a taxiway for facilities north of 99th Street.
The existing asphalt road is 20 ft wide with earthen shoulders approximately 10 ft wide on each
side. Drainage ditches parallel the road. The road will be expanded to 30 ft in width and a
drainage ditch on the west side will be moved an additional 10 ft in that direction. Although the
taxiway expansion will extend a greater length, the southern 400 ft between a concrete culvert on
the west side and an asphalt pad on the east to Taxiway D and Runway 9 was the focus of
investigation. Depth of impact for both projects should approach 3 ft.
Topography within and immediate to the two project areas is generally level and much of the
vegetation at the airport consists of mowed grass, including the project areas. A large stand of
hardwood trees, primarily mesquite, occupies most of the airfield south of the runways roughly
525 ft east of Roosevelt Avenue. Six Mile Creek, a tributary of the San Antonio River, flows
across the airport facility approximately 900 ft to the south of Runway 9.

Though the true boundaries have yet to be documented, site 41BX789, a historic paupers’
cemetery, is plotted on the Texas Archeological Sites Atlas directly east of the proposed helipad
location. This area encompasses two cemeteries indicated on the 1992 edition of the USGS
Southton, Texas, 7.5-minute topographic quadrangle, as well as a portion of the runway and
facilities on the west side of the airport, including the proposed taxiway. Unmarked burials have
been discovered in an area approximately 530 ft east of the south end of the proposed taxiway,
and two clusters of burial markers occur east of the proposed helipad site. The larger one occurs
in a relatively open, grassy area north of the woods (Figure 4). It spans roughly 300-by-300 ft
(2.1 acres) and consists of both stone markers and metal markers that commonly serve as
temporary markers until permanent stones are erected. However, because the cemetery represents
a paupers’ graveyard, these were probably the only markers for many individuals interred in the
cemetery. No lettering is present on any of the metal markers to identify individuals, although all
bear a patent date of August 27, 1918, on the back (Figure 5). The grave markers are fairly
widely spaced in this area, but the spacing is probably the consequence of markers deteriorating,
falling, or being discarded. An employee of the airport, Morris Martin, stated that all of the
markers were toppled when the property was acquired by the city from the U.S. Army Corps of
Engineers in the mid-1940s, and that each was simply uprighted where it was found (personal
communication, 2008). Most of the stone markers have no writing or are illegible and are made
of concrete. Those with writing are usually hand-engraved or etched. A few of the graves are
decorated with curbing and ornamental flowers (Figure 6). Some oyster and columella shell was
also identified on the ground surface that might represent grave decorations and/or offerings. Of
the gravestones observed, those with legible writing place death dates in the 1930s.

A second cluster of grave markers is present inside the south tree line on the west side of the
wooded area. Presently, an approximately 120-by-120-ft area of tightly spaced grave markers is
observable (Figure 7). All but one is a metal temporary marker identical to those to the north.
One stone marker is present (Figure 8). It is made of concrete in the shape of a cross and
inscribed with “P.G./2.22.40.” Presumably, P.G. stands for “pauper’s grave” and the numbers
represent the date of death. A defunct sewer line extends north-northeast from the north bank of
Six Mile Creek and separates the two groups of burial markers, as does a small channel of the
creek slightly east of the sewer line. A line of 10 in situ wooden fence posts (Figures 9 and 10) is
visible slightly east of this cluster along the south edge of the tree line, approximately 100 ft north
of the bank of Six Mile Creek. The fence probably marked the southern boundary of the
cemetery in this area.
ARCHEOLOGICALLY SENSITIVE AREAS
The historic paupers’ cemetery, site 41BX789, inside Stinson Municipal Airport was identified by
archeologists at the Center for Archeological Research (CAR) at the University of Texas at San
Antonio in the late 1980s (Cox et al. 1989). These and subsequent archeological investigations at
the airfield (Cave et al. 2003; Uecker 1996), however, have been unable to determine the
boundaries of the cemetery. An attempt to identify all burials within the cemetery by AlianzA,
LLC (Cave et al. 2003) in 2002 was abandoned when it became clear to the researchers that the
only way to do so would be through extensive subsurface investigations that would be both costprohibitive and potentially disruptive to the airfield infrastructure. Consequently, they
recommended that the airfield be divided into four zones of probability for the presence of graves
based on archival, informant, and archeological data (Figure 11).

Zone 1, the most sensitive, consists of areas where graves have been identified or have a high
potential for burials based on documentation. Recommended land use for these areas consists of
limitation to aboveground activities. In the event subsurface disturbance becomes necessary,
however, coordination with the Texas Historical Commission (THC) would be required, as would
Antiquities permit-level archeological investigations.
Zone 2 is primarily a 25-m (82.5 ft) buffer around Zone 1, but also consists of areas with
moderate potential to contain graves. Ground disturbances would be allowed in these areas, but
review by the THC would be required beforehand, as well as professional archeological
investigations and monitoring. Zone 3 possesses a lower likelihood for burials than Zone 2, but a
possibility remains. The City Historic Preservation Office would have to be notified prior to
ground-disturbing activities in these areas, and these activities would require monitoring by a
professional archeologist. Zone 4 represents areas of little to no potential for containing graves.
No restrictions would be placed on activities in this zone, but notification to the City Historic
Preservation Office would be necessary.

The proposed helipad location occurs within Zone 1, and a small portion of the taxiway
expansion clips Zone 2 and possibly Zone 1 (see Figure 11). The majority of the taxiway project
area, however, extends through Zone 3.

CHAPTER 2
ENVIRONMENTAL SETTING

TOPOLOGY AND PHYSIOGRAPHY
The Balcones Escarpment, a broad area of faulted limestone that forms the southern and eastern
edge of the Edwards Plateau, primarily governs the regional physiography. This escarpment rises
approximately 1,000 feet above the coastal prairie that lies to the south and east, and has a
marked influence on the environmental setting. The escarpment extends from near Del Rio,
Texas, about 160 miles to the west, through northern Bexar County, to Austin (70 miles to the
northeast). Remnants of the escarpment extend as far north as Waco. This physical feature runs
northeast to southwest through the San Antonio area.
To the northwest of the escarpment lies the Edwards Plateau, a rugged hilly region dissected by
many small streams. Within the San Antonio region, the Edwards Plateau is drained by Cibolo
and Balcones creeks and contains the headwaters of Culebra, Leon, and Salado creeks (Taylor et
al. 1991:119). Plateau elevations range from 1,100 to 1,900 feet. Fenneman (1931) mapped the
Edwards Plateau as part of the Great Plains Province.
The Gulf Coastal Plain (also called the Rio Grand Plain) Province lies southeast of the Balcones
Escarpment. It consists of nearly level or undulating prairie, and elevations range from 450 to
700 feet. The Medina and San Antonio rivers, Cibolo Creek, and their tributaries drain the
province (Taylor et al. 1991:119).
The Blackland Prairie physiographic area falls along the base of the escarpment in the region in
which the present project area is situated (Taylor et al. 1991). The Blackland Prairie is undulating
and hilly, and elevations range from 700 to 1,000 feet. Within the San Antonio region, the
Blackland Prairie is drained by the San Antonio River and by tributaries of the Medina River and
Cibolo Creek (Taylor et al. 1991:119). This physiographic area is also known as part of the
Taylor/Navarro Plain. Much of this plain is covered with gravelly terrace deposits, and some
valleys are cut by stream erosion. Six Mile Creek, historically known as Piedras Creek, is a
tributary of the San Antonio River and occurs inside the current project area.

12

HYDROLOGY
The hydrology of the region is derived from subsurface aquifers and from surface drainages that
emanate from the Balcones Escarpment. The Comanche Peak, Edwards, and Georgetown
Limestone formations comprise a hydrologic unit known as the Edwards Underground Reservoir
or Edwards Aquifer. This aquifer extends along the Balcones Fault Zone from Kinney County
through Uvalde, Medina, Bexar, and Comal counties and terminates in Hays County. Seventeen
cities, including San Antonio, and local communities depend on the Edwards Aquifer for their
domestic water supply. The formations on the Edwards Plateau form an extensive perched water
table, from which the residents derive their water. In places where the Edwards Plateau outcrops
to the south, numerous springs and seeps occur and form the baseflow for several of the perennial
streams in the area. The location of these springs and seeps influenced both prehistoric and
historic settlement patterns in the area (Gerstle et al. 1978:26). In the area below the escarpment,
where the Edwards Plateau outcrops, water reenters the formation through solution cavities that
have developed along fractures in the limestone. Recharge to the aquifer is primarily from
streams that flow across its outcrop in the Fault Zone, although some recharge is from direct
precipitation on the outcrop.
At various places downslope from the recharge zones, water reaches the surface under hydraulic
pressure through faults that reach the surface. These water sources have formed springs and
artesian wells. Hill and Vaughn (1898) listed 40 artesian wells in San Antonio. Six major
springs, as well as countless other small springs and seeps, are present in Bexar County. The San
Antonio River occurs east of the project area. Six Mile Creek, a tributary west the river, flows
across the project area. The alluvial valley of the creek and the river is considered to be a modern
flood plain.

GEOLOGY AND GEOMORPHOLOGY
The project area overlies Pleistocene fluviatile terrace deposits. These deposits consist of gravel,
sand, silt, and clay (Bureau of Economic Geology 1983). Soils within the project area are
mapped as Lewisville silty clay, 1 to 3 percent slopes (Taylor et al. 1991). Lewisville soils are
moderately deep, well-drained soils formed over the higher terrace deposits. The typical soil
profile begins with a surface layer approximately 61 cm (24 in) thick, consisting of very dark
grayish brown (10YR 3/2) silty clay with very fine carbonate concretions. Below, an AC horizon
that consists of brown (7.5YR 5/4) silty clay extends from about 61 cm (24 in) to 111.8 cm
(44 in) below the ground surface. Reddish yellow (7.5YR 6/6) silty clay with medium and fine
concretions comprises the underlying C horizon (Taylor et al. 1991:113).

CLIMATE
Bexar County is located on the edge of the Western Gulf Coastal Plain, resulting in a modified
subtropical climate. The summer is hot, and daily maximum temperatures exceed 90°F over 80
percent of the time. Normal mean temperatures range from a low of 62.3°F in January to a high
of 94.2°F in August. Mild weather prevails during much of the winter months; below-freezing
temperatures occur on an average of about 20 days each year. Relative humidity averages about
80 percent during the early morning hours most of the year, and drops to near 50 percent in the
late afternoon.
13

San Antonio is situated between a semi-arid area to the west and the coastal area of heavy
precipitation to the southeast. The average annual rainfall of 27.89 inches (in) is sufficient for the
normal production of most crops. Precipitation is fairly well distributed throughout the year, with
the heaviest amounts occurring during May and September. Precipitation from April through
September usually occurs as thunderstorms in which fairly large amounts fall in short periods of
time, but most of the winter precipitation occurs as light rain or drizzle. Because of its proximity
to the Gulf, storms of a tropical nature also occur and result in high winds and prolonged rainfall.
Thunderstorms and heavy rainfalls have occurred in all months of the year. Hail of damaging
intensity seldom occurs, but light hail is frequent in connection with the springtime
thunderstorms. Measurable snow occurs only once in three or four years (Taylor et al. 1991:118–
121).

FLORA AND FAUNA
Bexar County is situated in a transitional zone between three physiographic regions, and
therefore, the flora is a mixture of three biotic provinces: the Balconian (associated with the
Edwards Plateau), the Texan (associated with the Blackland Prairie), and the Tamaulipan
(associated with the South Texas Coastal Plain). Each is represented to varying degrees (Blair
1950).
Because of this edge setting, the indigenous native vegetation was likely quite diverse and
abundant. Texas wintergrass (Stipa leucotricha), Texas grama (Bouteloua rigidiseta), and panic
grass (Panicum sp.) are considered the dominant climax species, but other grasses such as big
bluestem (Andropogon gerardi), Indian grass (Sorghastrum avenaceum), switchgrass (Panicum
virgatum), and side-oats grama (Bouteloua curtipendula) also would be found. Among the
grasses are a wide variety of wildflowers including Indian blanket (Gaillardia pulchella), upright
prairie coneflower (Ratibida columnaris), coreopsis (Coreopsis sp.), and Drummond skullcup
(Scutellaria drummondii). Along waterways such as Leon Creek, woodlands consisted of cedar
elm (Ulmus crassifolia), netleaf hackberry (Celtis reticulata), cottonwood (Populus deltoides),
and pecan (Carya illinoinensis) trees.
The indigenous native prairie supported herds of buffalo (Bison bison), antelope (Antilocapra
americana), white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus), peccary (Pecar tajacu), and numerous
game birds. The urbanization of the area has caused most of the larger and more sensitive
animals to vacate. The present fauna can be divided into two regimes: those inhabiting the
urbanized portion and those inhabiting the bottomlands. Urban-tolerant animal and bird species
include fox squirrels (Sciurus niger), English sparrows (Passer domesticus), rusty blackbirds
(Euphagus carolinus), grackles (Quiscalus sp.), mockingbirds (Family Mimidae), robins (Turdus
sp.) and chickadees (Poecile sp.). The bottomlands form a more protected habitat for wilder
species. Beaver (Castor canadensis), armadillo (Dasypus novemcinctus), skunks (Mephitis
mephitis), cottontail rabbits (Sylvilagus sp.), and opossums (Didelphis virginiana) inhabit the
bottomlands. The number of bird species that visit bottomlands also may be high, as a large
number of birds have been sighted in Bexar County. Black bullheads (Ictalurus melas),
mosquitofish (Gambusia affinis), sailfin molly (Poecillia latipinna), warmouth (Lepomis
gulosus), bluegill (Lepomis macrochirus), largemouth bass (Micropterus salmoides), Rio Grande
perch (Cichlasoma cyanoguttatum), as well as introduced species of mouthbrooders, may inhabit
the wetlands.

CHAPTER 3
HISTORIC CONTEXT

CHRONOLOGICAL FRAMEWORK
The project area falls within the southern portion of the Central Texas archeological region. The
archeological record for Central Texas reflects the full North American cultural sequence;
therefore, evidence of human occupation spans a time period of roughly 12,000 years. The
Central Texas cultural sequence presented in the following discussion is divided into regionspecific cultural-historical periods within four broad cultural stages—Paleo-Indian, Archaic, Late
Prehistoric, and Historic—that differentiate the broadly recognized North American cultural
trends (Table 1). These four major cultural stages are briefly summarized in the following
cultural history of the southcentral Texas project area, which derives primarily from the work of
Black (1989), Prewitt (1981, 1985), Suhm (1960), Suhm et al. (1954), and Weir (1976).

Paleo-Indian (10,000–6000 B.C.)
The earliest widely accepted human occupation of North America is termed the Paleo-Indian
stage (10,000–6000 B.C.). Cooler, wetter conditions were in place 12,000 years ago, and
although a general drying trend continued through Paleo-Indian times, climatic conditions were
more stable than during the subsequent Holocene. This period is often characterized as a culture
of small but highly mobile bands of foragers who were specialized hunters of Pleistocene
megafauna. Most Paleo-Indian sites are deeply buried and difficult to find, leaving the highly
visible, often fortuitously discovered, mammoth kill sites as the primary evidence of Paleo-Indian
life-ways. Recent studies address this bias and emphasize that large kills probably contributed
little to overall food requirements. Rather, a primary reliance on other game animals and plant
resources was more likely (Ferring 1989). Subsistence in this period certainly included large
herbivores such as mammoth, bison, and horse, but was probably based more consistently on
smaller animals such as various species of turtle, land tortoise, alligator, mice, badger, and
raccoon (Collins et al. 1989; Story 1990) and, presumably, also included an array of plants
(Collins 1998). The defining Paleo-Indian trait is the fluted point tradition. Projectile points of
the Early Paleo-Indian period were made from high-quality toolstone and indicate high technical
skill in flaking, exhibiting a hallmark “flute,” which is a long, shallow flake scar that extends
from the base toward the tip of the point on one or both sides.
As across North America, the Paleo-Indian stage is the earliest substantiated cultural period in
Texas. The Paleo-Indian stage in Central Texas falls into early and late subperiods, which
encompass three archeological complexes. The Llano and Folsom complexes comprise the Early
Paleo-Indian subperiod (10,000–8000 B.C.), and the Late Paleo-Indian (8000–6000 B.C.) reflects
the Plano complex. These complexes are not unique to Central Texas, for their ranges extended
into the Southwest and Great Plains. The Early Paleo-Indian subperiod is based on two projectile
point styles: Clovis and Folsom.
The Llano complex is represented by the Clovis projectile point, the oldest point type found in
North America. Much research energy has been devoted to the makers of Clovis points, but the
material record of Llano peoples is largely limited to hunting activities. Clovis assemblages
include the diagnostic fluted lanceolate Clovis point, along with engraved stones, bone and ivory
points, stone bolas, and ochre (Collins 1995; Collins et al. 1992). Sites with Clovis components
reported in Central Texas include Kincaid Rockshelter, Wilson-Leonard, Gault, Horn Shelter No.
2, Pavo Real, and Crockett Gardens. Surface finds of distinctive Clovis points are reported from
a number of other localities (Meltzer and Bever 1995).
By about 11,000 years ago, the cool, wet climatic conditions of the Pleistocene had given way to
Holocene warming and drying. This change coincides with the extinction of Pleistocene
megafauna, most notably the mammoth, and is concurrent with the earliest record of the Folsom
complex. Like the Llano complex, the Folsom complex is best known for a projectile point, the
Folsom point. Shorter than Clovis points, “classic” Folsom points exhibit fine parallel flaking
and large flutes that extend across most of each face. Midland points, commonly believed to
occur later in time, may represent unfluted Folsom points, apparently made to offset the
production risks involved in fluting (Amick 1995). Another trademark of the Folsom complex is
the association of Folsom points with the remains of now-extinct bison (Bison antiquus), usually
found in the context of massive kills of bison herds run into ravines. Such sites are conspicuous,
and thus much of what is known about Folsom subsistence and technology comes from lithic
artifacts found at these sites or nearby processing sites. Folsom tool kits consisted of the fluted
Folsom and the thin, unfluted (Midland) points, large thin bifaces, and end scrapers that were
more conducive to specialized hunting, particularly of Bison antiquus (Collins 1995:382).
16

By approximately 10,000 years ago, the climate trended toward more moderate conditions, and
the larger megafauna from the Early Paleo-Indian subperiod were no longer available. Most of
the associated faunal evidence dated to the Late Paleo-Indian Plano complex reflects a human
subsistence pattern based on deer and other smaller animals. Horn Shelter No. 2 (Forrester 1985)
located on the Brazos River in Bosque County, Hinds Cave (Shafer and Bryant 1977) in Val
Verde County, and Wilson-Leonard (Collins 1998) in Williamson County have yielded
subsistence data indicating that a variety of vertebrate fauna was consumed by Late Paleo-Indian
peoples.
The Late Paleo-Indian Plano complex is represented by a greater diversity of projectile points
(e.g., Plainview, Angostura, Scottsbluff, and Golondrina), which, still in lanceolate form, were
unfluted. In contrast to evidence from the earlier subperiod, late subperiod points are associated
with modern bison (Bison bison) and often occur as surface finds throughout Central Texas. The
beginning of Prewitt’s (1981) Early Archaic, or Circleville phase, is considered in this report as
the Late Paleo-Indian Plano complex but has also been called the “Pre-Archaic” (see Sollberger
and Hester 1972). The Late Paleo-Indian Plano complex defies convenient labeling, as it exhibits
a unique blend of lanceolate and stemmed points that appear to correspond with life-ways
reflective of Archaic subsistence alongside Paleo-Indian mobility. Again, little is known about
the complex in Central Texas, but toward the latter part of the Late Paleo-Indian period,
lanceolate points began to be replaced by stemmed points. Settlement-subsistence strategies
probably more closely approximated those of the Archaic than Early Paleo-Indian. More diverse
sites are associated with this period, including not only the mass bison kills, which by the Late
Paleo-Indian period consist only of modern bison (Bison bison), but also campsites and
residences. The characteristics of the Wilson, Golondrina-Barber, and St. Mary’s Hall
components are more Archaic-like in that burned rock features are found, although the features
are much smaller and contain less rock that the burned rock features in the subsequent Archaic.

Archaic (6000 B.C.–A.D. 800)
Toward the end of the Late Paleo-Indian period, a great variety of projectile point styles began to
appear. The subsequent Archaic period (6000 B.C.–A.D. 800) is broadly characterized by
stemmed and side-notched dart points and by the appearance of ground and pecked stone tools.
The Archaic represents a more generalized style of hunting and gathering as a way of life, and the
subsistence pattern may have become more diffuse, reflecting a greater exploitation of local
environments as smaller game animals, fish, and wild plant foods increased in dietary importance.
Like their predecessors, Archaic peoples apparently continued to follow a nomadic way of life,
traveling seasonally to utilize different food resources in various localities (cf. Weir 1976).
McGraw and Hindes (1987:47) have noted that:
In northern and central Bexar County, major occupation sites are situated on stream terraces and are
usually associated with one or a series of spatially proximate, often buried, burned rock middens. An
extensive distribution of chipped stone debitage and a variety of diagnostic projectile points indicate
recurring occupations that span several thousand years. Major Late Prehistoric sites, in contrast, are
often physically discrete from these earlier sites.

The Archaic is generally divided into early, middle, and late subperiods (Black 1989; Collins
1995; Story 1985) based on diagnostic projectile point styles and associated radiocarbon assays
(Collins 1995). By the Middle Archaic in Central Texas, some regional distinctiveness is
17

apparent archeologically, as evidenced primarily by increased techno-stylistic diversity among
projectile point types. Interplay between influential factors of population increase and
environmental change toward greater aridity and climatic variability probably drove adaptive
change throughout the Archaic. The following discussion follows Story’s (1985) broader
subdivisions of the Early, Middle, and Late Archaic, although Prewitt’s (1981) discussion of
various phases within these periods provides much of the information discussed.
The most archeologically obvious changes from the Paleo-Indian to the Early Archaic (6000–
3000 B.C.) are the appearance of ground stone implements and the shift from the lanceolate points
of the Paleo-Indian tradition to the stemmed and side-notched dart points emblematic of the
Archaic. Three recognized point styles (Angostura, Early Split Stem [Gower and Jetta], and
Martindale-Uvalde) indicate that the makers tended to occupy the better-watered eastern part of
the Edwards Plateau (Collins 1998:65). Assemblages also include Clear Fork and Guadalupe
bifaces, manos, metates, hammerstones, burins, circular scrapers, and a variety of bifaces. Few
burials have been assigned to this period (Prewitt 1981:77–79; Story 1985:34–35), and
settlement/subsistence systems are “hypothesized to have been diffuse, utilizing a variety of
resources and frequently shifting the loci of subsistence activities rather than intensifying the use
of any specified resource” (Story 1985:39).
Projectile point types constitute the primary source of information about the Early Archaic, but
Prewitt (1981, 1985) uses point types to define four phases: the Circleville, San Geronimo,
Jarrell, and Oakalla. This refinement is criticized by some as unsubstantiated since few intact
sites are known (see Black 1989:26; Black and McGraw 1985), but the tendency for many Early
Archaic sites to occur around the Balcones Escarpment leads several researchers to infer that this
area was a refuge from drier conditions in Central Texas and on the coastal plains (McKinney
1981; Story 1985). Concentrations of Early Archaic sites along the southern and eastern margins
of the Edwards Plateau may be indicative of climatic conditions at the time, as these
environments had more reliable water sources and a diverse subsistence base. The margins of the
Edwards Plateau are ecotonal in character and may have provided reliable resources during times
of environmental stress (Story 1985:31, 34). Convincing paleoenvironmental data on the climatic
conditions of this period is, nonetheless, still lacking.
Early Archaic sites are small (Weir 1976:115–122), suggesting that populations were highly
mobile and that their densities were low (Prewitt 1985:217). Early Archaic sites are usually
described as open camp sites (such as Loeve, Wilson-Leonard, Richard Beene, Sleeper, Jetta
Court, Youngsport, Camp Pearl Wheat, and Landslide) or lithic procurement stations. Only a few
campsites located in rockshelters (Kincaid Rockshelter) occur on the Edwards Plateau during this
period. The location of lithic procurement sites is determined by the natural distribution of
cherts. Large and varied burned rock features (Sleeper, Camp Pearl Wheat, Wilson-Leonard,
Richard Beene) become common in the latter part of the Early Archaic, and domestic structures
(Turkey Bend Ranch) and caches (Linder) are also known in the Early Archaic (Collins 1998:64).
Freshwater mussel, deer, and small game appear to have been important food resources. Hearths
are occasionally found at Early Archaic sites and can be stone-lined, basin-shaped, or flat. The
appearance of ground stone signifies a shift to plant resources, and the diversification of lithic
technology appears to reflect an increased reliance on gathering.
The Middle Archaic (3000–1000 B.C.) marks the first period of Central Texas distinctiveness as
an archeological region. The subperiod exhibits more numerous and more varied sites than the
preceding Early Archaic. This cultural manifestation is characterized by a population increase;
18

the development of regionally distinct cultural patterns; and changes in settlement patterns,
economic and social systems, and technology (Prewitt 1985). In addition, territorial boundaries
may have begun to emerge (Story 1985:39).
Burned rock middens, which often consist of massive amounts of fire-cracked limestone, are,
however, the preeminent archeological features of the Middle Archaic. Many of these middens
may represent earthen ovens used to process live oak acorns (see Creel 1986; Weir 1976), as well
as for roasting succulents or other plants and animals. Many Central Texas trees disappeared
from the paleoenvironmental record at this time, leaving live oak forests to dominate the
landscape. A renewed focus on deer, which themselves were well suited for the oak-savanna
environment, is likely. Weir (1976:124–130) suggests that an expansion of oak forests influenced
the development of an economic system that focused on the exploitation of deer, acorns, and
other hardwood nuts. Prewitt (1985:222–226) notes that the abundance of rock middens indicates
a greater reliance on plant foods, although tool kits still imply a strong reliance on hunting.
Middle Archaic sites in Central Texas are represented by rockshelters, campsites, lithic quarries,
and kill sites (Weir 1976), as well as by the burned rock middens that first appeared toward the
end of the Early Archaic. Other features include basin hearths and large flat hearths. Data
concerning mortuary practices are not available except for the end of the Middle Archaic, for
which cremations have been reported (Prewitt 1981:81). Three generalized point styles
characterize this subperiod: Bell-Andice-Calf Creek, Taylor, and Nolan-Travis. Bifaces, a
variety of scrapers, unifaces, and grinding stones are also present. Prewitt (1981:73) suggests that
the proportion of projectile points (50 percent) compared to total number of tools is indicative of
a balance between the exploitation of plant and animal resources.
Late Archaic (1000 B.C.–A.D. 800.) life-ways began similarly to those of the Middle Archaic, but
notable changes occurred, characterized by the emergence of new cultural patterns as well as the
intensification of preexisting ones (Story 1985:45). Coastal marine shells, used either as
ornaments or as raw materials for ornaments, were exchanged with inland groups, at least on a
limited basis, in return for finished lithic tools and/or siliceous raw material (Story 1985:48). The
use of burned rock middens throughout the Late Archaic appears to have been a major part of the
subsistence strategy as a decrease in the importance of hunting, inferred from the low ratio of
projectile points in relation to other tools in site assemblages, may have occurred (Prewitt
1981:74). Bison, which had been absent from the area for most of the Archaic, were once again
available in the region (Dillehay 1974).
Late Archaic sites include rockshelters, campsites, and large cemeteries. The establishment of
these large cemeteries along drainages suggests strong territorial ties by certain groups (Story
1985:40). In addition to cemeteries (e.g., Orchard [41BX1]; Story 1985:49), isolated flexed
burials have been recorded for this period (Prewitt 1981:81–82). Features include basin hearths,
arcuate hearths, and mussel shell caches. The lithic assemblages contain a variety of dart point
styles (e.g., Bulverde, Pedernales-Kinney, Lange-Williams-Marshall, Marcos-MontellCastroville, Ensor-Frio-Fairland, and Darl); Erath, San Gabriel, and Hare bifaces; gravers;
scrapers; a variety of unifaces and bifaces; grinding stones; and boatstones. Except for Montell
and Fairland, the point styles for the Late Archaic are among the most widely distributed dart
points (Prewitt 1985). Other artifacts include ulna flakers, bone beads and awls, stone and marine
shell gorgets, and freshwater mussel shell pendants (Prewitt 1981:81–82).

19

Late Prehistoric (A.D. 800–1500)
The Late Prehistoric period (A.D. 800–1500) is marked by the replacement of the atlatl-and-dart
with bow-and-arrow technology. Ceramics were also adopted within this period. Basin-shaped
and flat hearths, burned clay/charcoal lenses, and pits are the predominant archeological features.
Flexed and semiflexed burials occur near habitation sites, usually in cemeteries but also as
isolated occurrences, a continuation of Late Archaic burial practices. Some burials were
cremations, carried away from cemeteries and placed in shallow pits.
The Late Prehistoric chronology in South Texas is closely aligned with that of Central Texas,
particular in terms of Toyah cultural manifestations (Hester 1995:443). The period is divided into
two main periods, the Austin and Toyah, and each is marked by distinctive cultural traits. Once
believed to be contemporaneous, Jelks’s (1953, 1962) work at the Blum Rockshelter and the Kyle
site demonstrated the temporal separation between Austin and Toyah components by locating
stratigraphically distinct Perdiz arrow points above older Austin phase Scallorn arrow points.
Each phase is discussed below.
The Austin phase is characterized by a shift to the use of the bow and arrow. Common are
Scallorn and other related South Texas side-notched (e.g., Edwards) arrow points, with broadbased hunting and gathering as the main mode of subsistence (Turner and Hester 1985:173).
Common artifacts for this period include numerous bifaces, Clear Fork gouges, scrapers, grinding
stones, as well as basin hearths, pits, and cemeteries. The broad-based subsistence patterns
focused largely on gathering, though hunting of deer and exploitation of freshwater mussels and
snails is also suggested to have been important (Prewitt 1981:83; Ricklis and Collins 1994). The
diagnostic projectile points of the Austin period are the Scallorn and Granbury. A wide variety of
tools are found, including Friday bifaces and unifaces, other bifaces, scrapers, ground stone, ulna
flakers, and bone awls. Other artifacts include painted stones, bone beads, and marine shell beads
and pendants. Projectile points are proportionately more common during the Austin phase as
hunting appears to have become increasingly important. The widespread occurrence of Scallorn
points outside of Central Texas and the frequency of marine shell indicate a broad cultural entity
and/or extensive trade networks in the Late Prehistoric.
The Toyah phase is the best known of the Late Prehistoric phases. It is distinct from the
preceding Austin phase and is marked archeologically by Perdiz and similar contracting-stem
arrow points, pottery, beveled-edge bifacial knives, perforators, and end scrapers (Black 1986,
1989; Creel 1991; Hester 1980, 1995; Jelks 1962; Johnson 1994; Kelley 1986; Prewitt 1981).
Perishable artifacts such as cordage and basketry are found at some sites. Corncobs have also
been recovered, indicating either trade relations with agricultural peoples or some degree of
horticulture (Prewitt 1981:74). Extensive trade relations are also indicated by the presence of
Caddo ceramics, such as Bullard Brushed, among other imported types. Toyah phase burials
sometimes contain artifacts, but it is not established that these are grave goods. Perdiz and
Cliffton points found in burials may be from fatal wounds and indicative of increased conflict.
During the Toyah phase, a climatic shift to moister conditions allowed the savannas and
grasslands to advance, bringing the return of the bison. Subsistence strategies shifted even further
toward hunting in response to the reoccupation of Central Texas by bison (Dillehay 1974). Deer,
however, probably continued to be an important resource (Black and McGraw 1985). The
importance of bison to the Toyah economy is readily deduced from the makeup of artifact
assemblages represented at a number of archeological sites. The Buckhollow site (41KM16)
20

produced an abundance of Perdiz arrow points consisting of many varieties (Johnson 1994). Also
found were Harahey knives, most of them containing four beveled edges. The use wear is
representative of cutting bison hides and flesh—a hypothesis supported by the recovery of large
numbers of bison bones. Also indicative of the importance of bison is the recovery of large end
scrapers from the site. The presence of edge rounding and polish on bit ends indicates use on
fresh hides, most of which were probably bison (Johnson 1994). The Hinojosa site (41JW8),
located in Jim Wells County in southern Texas, represents a Late Prehistoric Toyah base camp
dating from A.D. 1300 to 1500 (Black 1986). Specialized hunting adaptions are evident from the
archeological materials, though a broad subsistence base including fish, softshell turtle, aquatic
birds, and mussel shell was also exploited. Deer figured prominently in the overall assemblage,
with bison and pronghorn antelope also contributing a significant portion to overall subsistence
(Black 1986). A significant component of the highly adaptive bison-oriented Toyah phase tool
kit is the end scraper used for processing hides. Creel (1991) has suggested that these tools are
indicative of the importance of trade in bison hides during the Late Prehistoric and Early Historic
periods. Bison bones occur in great frequency in many Late Prehistoric Toyah phase sites.
Excavations at 41LK201 and 41MC222 along the Frio River drainage contained abundant bison
bone, with the latter site dating to around A.D. 1260 to 1290 (Hester 1980; Highley 1986).

Historic
The Historic period (post-A.D. 1525) in Central Texas symbolizes the local expression of
sweeping cultural change for native peoples across North America. Spanish missionization
represents the first European influence in Texas, but it probably did not have dramatic effects
until native groups sought refuge at the missions in the 1600s from encroaching Apachean and,
later, Comanche groups. Changes through gradual cultural adoption and exchange of Spanish
life-ways and materials occurred throughout the seventeenth century. After the 1700s, European
material culture became pervasive. Metal, glass, European clothing, and guns became important
to native peoples, replacing traditional items. In the post-1900 period, farming and ranching have
been the primary land use activity in Bexar County.

BRIEF HISTORY OF THE PAUPERS’ CEMETERY AND STINSON MUNICIPAL
AIRPORT
It is unclear when the cemetery was established or started accepting interments. The city of San
Antonio acquired the property that includes Stinson Municipal Airport and the cemetery in 1895
for use as a waste disposal area for the city’s sewer system, and it was leased to various parties as
a sewer farm until 1904. The exception is 50 acres that were leased to the U.S. Army as an
experimental sewer farm until about 1916. In 1915, the city agreed to deed several acres of the
former sewer farm to the Catholic Church in exchange for a sewer right-of-way. The exchange
never took place; however, a paupers’ cemetery plotted on a 1942 U.S. Army Corps of Engineers
map seems to indicate that the city began to use part of the property as a burial ground sometime
prior to this date. In 1915, the city leased a portion of the old sewer farm to the Stinson family to
operate a flying school until it went out of business in the late summer of 1917, but the property
continued to function as an airfield. The U.S. Army Air Corps took possession of Stinson Field
1942 for use as an auxiliary airfield, and later returned the facility to the city in 1946 after the end
of World War II. It is presumed that the improvements the U.S. Army made to the facility,
including extension of a runway and relocation of a sewer line, resulted in the present segregation
of burial areas (Cave et al. 2003; Cox et al. 1989).
21

PREVIOUS ARCHEOLOGICAL INVESTIGATIONS
A previous search of the site files curated at the Center for Archaeological Research (CAR) at the
University of Texas at San Antonio (UTSA) and at the Texas Archeological Research Laboratory
(TARL) at the University of Texas at Austin (Largent and Duke 2003) indicated that 43 recorded
sites occur within a 1.6-km (1-mi) radius of the project areas (Table 2). Several of the sites are
part of the nearby San Antonio Missions National Historic Park (SAMNHP) that was designated
as the result of the Mission Parkway Survey conducted by the THC (Scurlock et al. 1976). Many
sites from the SAMNHP are labeled with “MP” numbers rather than state trinomial site numbers.
The “MP” sites are typically old houses, some of which are still occupied, or sites whose
locations were provided by local informants but not necessarily verified in the field. In fact,
Stinson Airport is designated MP 66 within the historic district.
Other archeological projects have been conducted both within the airport and in the nearby
vicinity. UTSA, CAR, and the THC performed most of these investigations. Most consisted of
small projects related to the changing management needs at the historic missions (see Escobedo
1984; Fox 1993; Fox and Hester 1976; Gross 1998; Ivey and Fox 1999; Killen and Scurlock
1977; Meissner 1998; Meskill 1992; Turner 1988). In addition, archeologists with the State
Department of Highways and Public Transportation tested 41BX252 in the Mission Parkway,
which was to be affected by the construction of Interstate 410 (Clark 1986) and also recorded
prehistoric site 41BX706.
The site that is the impetus for the current investigations is 41BX789, a historic paupers’
cemetery that is potentially eligible for inclusion in the National Register of Historic Places
(NRHP). Cox et al. (1989) of CAR recorded 41BX789 during an archeological survey of Stinson
Municipal Airport. The cemetery is on the west side of the airfield, although its boundaries have
not been clearly defined. Nevertheless, archeological investigations related to the cemetery have
been conducted (see Figure 9). In 1994, burials were discovered when a storm drain was installed
across the northern taxiway approximately 560 m east of the south end of the proposed taxiway.
St. Mary’s University identified, excavated, and relocated the burials of nine individuals (Uecker
1996). Grave markers associated with five of the burials were discovered below the ground
surface, and all of the dates occurred in the mid to late 1930s (Uecker 1996).
In 2002, AlianzA, LLC, attempted to locate and map known burials in order to facilitate future
planning of improvements to the airfield (Cave et al. 2003). Investigations included archival
studies, informant interviews, and both invasive (mechanical excavation) and noninvasive
(ground-penetrating radar, magnetometer, and metal detector) subsurface methods.
Archeological examinations were conducted north of the airfield runways on each side of the road
that will be expanded for the proposed taxiway. Results from noninvasive studies were
inconclusive. Mechanical scraping located four burials immediately west of the burials excavated
by St. Mary’s University, roughly 530 ft east of the proposed taxiway. As a result of these
exercises, the investigators concluded that, although an option, mechanical scraping to locate all
burials would be cost-prohibitive and impact existing airfield facilities. Instead, they
recommended that the airfield be divided into four zones of probability for the presence of graves
based on archival, informant, and archeological data (see Figure 11). Depending on potential for
graves, different restrictions on land use (i.e., unrestricted to no activity other than groundskeeping activities without a Texas Antiquities permit) were proposed, each of which required a
different protocol prior to any ground-disturbing activities. Required action ranges from simple
notification to the City Historic Preservation Officer of planned improvements to archeological
monitoring and/or field investigation by a qualified professional.

Sites within One Mile of the Project Area

The cemetery was not the sole focus of a 2004 GMI survey for a San Antonio Water System
(SAWS) sanitary sewer pipeline (Tiné and Largent 2004). However, a portion of the proposed
pipeline inside Stinson Municipal Airport potentially occurred within probability Zones 1 and 2.
GMI archeologists monitored the boring of the two geotechnical and environmental core holes
along the proposed pipeline corridor in the area thought to be closest to the cemetery but
identified no evidence of burials. Nevertheless, two 4-in-diameter holes were not considered
sufficient to presume an absence of burials within the project corridor, and gradual, systematic
mechanical scraping of the proposed pipeline easement between the airport runways and Six Mile
Creek was recommended. The trenching exercises were carried out between May 31 and June 2
of the following year (Tiné 2005). A 50-ft-wide by 300-ft-long strip was excavated inside the
west fence of the airfield. No burials were encountered, although seven wooden fence posts,
including four in situ, were identified in the excavated area. They appeared to predate the present
airport; however, no clear pattern of their placement was discerned and their purpose remains
unknown. An additional trench was excavated on the west side of a pipeline bridge crossing Six
Mile Creek that was scheduled for removal. The bridge is south of two discrete clusters of
marked burials. The trench profile indicated that the present embankment is artificial and
composed of more than 10 ft of fill. No burials were identified in this area.

24

CHAPTER 4
METHODS AND RESULTS

A series of trenches was mechanically scraped in each of the project areas to discern whether
unmarked burials were present in these locations (see Figure 9). A Gradall is the preferred
machine for subsurface prospecting for graves because its retractable arm provides for a smooth,
controlled scraping motion and the machine typically has a wide (4–5 ft) bucket that efficiently
permits exposure of a large surface area. Unfortunately, no such machine was available in the
San Antonio area, and a backhoe with a smooth-edged bucket was used as an alternative. Each
trench was excavated by gradually scraping away a few inches of soil at a time until either the
stain of a burial shaft was observed, or a contrasting stratum of soil was encountered in which
such a stain, if present, would be visible. Except in two instances, trenches were two buckets
(approximately 60 in) wide to maximize visibility of the trench floors. All were excavated with
the long axis oriented north-to-south. Historic and modern burials in the United States are
traditionally oriented east-to-west, and scraping across the short axis greatly improves the chance
of encountering rows of burials. All backhoe trenches and other pertinent features were recorded
with a Trimble Pro-XRS global positioning systems receiver. Each project area is discussed
individually below.

TRAINING HELIPAD
Once the 90-by-90-ft APE was defined, it was divided into quadrants for trenching. Except for
Trench 7, which extended along the entire east edge of the project area (90 ft), trenches extended
the length of a quadrant (about 45 ft). Eight trenches were excavated within the project area (see
Figure 9). These consisted of three in the southwest quadrant (Trenches 1–3), three in the
southeast quadrant (Trenches 4–6), one in the northeast quadrant (Trench 8), and one along the
east edge of the project area (Trench 7), extending along both the northeast and southeast
quadrants.
Trenches were usually spaced 3–6 ft apart. This distance safely accommodated the backhoe
while providing as little unexcavated space as possible. An exception is Trench 3, which was 5 m
(15 ft) west of Trench 2. However, these two trenches were in the west side of the project area
and had a lower probability for containing graves because of their greater distance from the
marked burials to the east. Trench 1 was the only trench excavated one-bucket width, the rest
were widened to two.
25

All trenches indicated a surface layer of fill 30 cm (11.8 in) to 100 cm (39.4 in) thick, and fill
layers were thickest in the southeast portion of the project area. Soil stratigraphy was fairly
uniform among the trenches (Figure 12). Natural soils consisted of an upper layer of very dark
grayish brown (10YR 3/2) silty clay that graded into dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) silty clay
with calcium carbonate inclusions above grayish brown (10YR 5/2) or pale brown (10YR 6/3)
calcareous clay. Trench depth ranged from 175 cm (69 in) to 210 cm (82.7 in). No burials were
observed in any of the trenches, and except for gravel, asphalt, and pieces of metal in the fill
layer, the only materials encountered in the trenches were tree stumps at the south ends of
Trenches 2 and 3. Based on the absence of burials in the eastern half of the APE, as well as the
southwest quadrant, the potential for burials occurring in the northwest quadrant was considered
very low to nonexistent, and this area was not scraped.

TAXIWAY
For the proposed taxiway, a series of backhoe trenches was excavated along the two sides of the
existing entrance road. The east side is closer to the burials excavated by St. Mary’s University
and those encountered during the AlianzA investigations and, therefore, has a higher probability
for graves to be encountered. Consequently, this side was given the greatest attention. Four
trenches (1–4) were spaced along the east side of the road approximately 20 ft east of the
pavement edge starting at the southernmost end in a small greenspace between Taxiway D and a
service road to the north and extending northward (see Figure 9). Two additional trenches (5 and
6) were placed between the road and the first row of trenches adjacent to Trenches 2 and 3.
26

Except for Trench 1, which was limited to 13 ft long because of landing lights, buried power
lines, and a sewer line, all trenches on this side ranged between 43 and 56 ft in length and
generally were spaced 16.5 ft apart. A seventh trench was placed on the west side of the road
immediately west of the existing drainage ditch and as far south as possible without disturbing
existing lights and buried power lines. The trench measured approximately 26 ft long and
differed from the others in that it was only 2.5 ft wide, rather than 5 ft. Soil profiles were similar
to those observed in the helipad area, although, except for Trench 1, all they lacked the surface
fill layer (Figure 13). As a result, trenches were shallower and ranged from 130 cm (51 in) to
168 cm (66 in) in depth before a heavily calcareous yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) layer was
encountered. No burials or other features were identified in the trench walls or floors. A few
pieces of clear bottle glass were unearthed in the upper 50 cm (20 in) of Trench 6, however,
including the base of a square bottle with an Owens ring. This feature is a by-product of an early
automated manufacturing process that was commonly used throughout the early half of the
twentieth century starting around 1910 and most dominant during the 1920s (Lindsey 2008).
Nonetheless, this object has no context and could have been deposited any time during the
airfield’s history.

CHAPTER 5
DISCUSSION AND RECOMMENDATIONS

Of the 8,100-sq-ft (0.186-ac) helipad APE, 1,507.5 sq ft (0.035 ac) were mechanically scraped,
and no burial shaft stains, burial container remnants, or human remains were observed in the
walls or floors of any of the eight trenches. The five trenches, including one that extended the
entire length of the eastern edge, in the two eastern quadrants that are closest to the marked
burials were void of burials, as were the three in the southwest quadrant. The absence of burials
in these areas precluded the necessity to trench the northwest quadrant, as an isolated burial or
group of burials in this area would be extremely unlikely. No further archeological work is
required for the proposed helipad area.
Seven trenches encompassing 1,355 sq ft (0.031 ac) were excavated along the roughly 14,000-sqft (0.321-acre) proposed taxiway, and no burials were identified. In 2002, AlianzA conducted
subsurface scraping in this general area on both sides of the existing entrance road, although not
within the specific location of the planned improvements (Cave et al. 2003). Burials were
identified over 500 ft to the east of the road, but none were encountered any farther west. Based
on the negative findings of both sets of investigations, it is highly unlikely that burials north of
Taxiway D occur any farther west than an existing hangar building 430 ft east of the entrance
road. Indeed, the assignment of the southern part of the proposed taxiway project area to Zone 2
and possibly Zone 1 appears to be based on its location relative to an area designated as a
paupers’ cemetery on a 1942 Corps of Engineers map rather than physical evidence of burials. In
addition, landing lights and underground utilities occur in the portions of the project area that are
within these probability zones, primarily in areas where the pavement is already at the width of
the proposed taxiway. Therefore, it is doubtful that any additional disturbance will occur in this
area. In the event that this does happen, however, an archeological monitor is recommended to
confirm that no burials, although unlikely, are present. Should any burials be identified, work
should cease immediately until an agreement is reached between the airport, THC, and the City
Historic Preservation Office as to whether the burials should be removed and relocated or
additional disturbance to the area should be avoided.
Though no sites were recorded and no artifacts were collected as a result of this fieldwork,
photographs and notes were compiled. All files concerning this project will be permanently
curated at the Center for Archaeological Research, University of Texas at San Antonio.
