ABSTRACT
SWCA Environmental Consultants (SWCA) was contracted by the Texas Department of Transportation (TxDOT)
to conduct archaeological impact evaluations and surveys in the South Texas Contract Area, which includes the
Corpus Christi, Laredo, Pharr, and San Antonio Districts. The project area comprises 38 counties. The investigations were performed under Texas Antiquities Permit 3907.
TxDOT issued 16 work authorizations under the contract. Not including a work authorization for the preparation
of this ﬁnal report these work authorizations comprised 72 individual projects, which included 62 archaeological
surveys and 10 impact evaluations. None of the 62 archaeological surveys included a geoarchaeological component. TxDOT issued seven ﬁeld projects under ﬁve work authorizations for the Corpus Christi District, 34 ﬁeld
projects and 10 work authorizations for the Laredo District, 13 ﬁeld projects under ﬁve work authorizations for
the Pharr District, and 18 ﬁeld projects under four work authorizations for the San Antonio District.
SWCA investigated 30 archaeological sites while completing the 15 work authorizations that required ﬁeld
investigations. Over half of these archaeological sites (n=17) occurred within the Laredo District. Five of the 17
Laredo District archaeological sites were encountered along the United States Highway (US) 59 project alignment in Webb and Duval Counties. This project contained the most sites for any single TxDOT project. During
the course of several surveys, 11 previously reported archaeological sites that were believed to be near or in a
survey area could not be relocated or were found not to extend into the right-of-way (ROW).
Testing was recommended at one of the 30 archaeological sites within the ROW. This site was a stratiﬁed prehistoric campsite. No further investigations were recommended at the remaining 29 sites within existing TxDOT
ROW. In general, further work was recommended at sites that had not been substantially disturbed by previous
impacts and had the potential to contain buried archaeological components with good integrity. This combination of factors was typically rare. The one site matching these criteria was recommended for signiﬁcance testing
(41LS105), which is a possibly intact, stratiﬁed prehistoric campsite. The sites not recommended for further work
primarily occupy upland settings or are in disturbed alluvial deposits. The data indicate that sites are likely to be
discovered in a variety of settings, but recommendations for testing-level investigations are unlikely except in
areas with a high potential for buried components with good integrity, usually in alluvial settings that have been
spared previous impacts. These conditions are generally rare particularly when in association with an existing
transportation corridor as most of these projects were.
Under the contract, any recovered artifacts were to be curated at the Texas Archeological Research Laboratory
at the University of Texas at Austin. However, no artifacts were collected.

INTRODUCTION

Overall, TxDOT issued 16 work authorizations under
the contract. One work authorization consisted of
the ﬁnal report (WA 16) and 15 work authorizations
composed the ﬁeld investigations that occasionally
involved ﬁeldwork in multiple districts. Not including
the preparation of the ﬁnal report, the work authorizations comprised 72 individual projects, which included
62 archaeological surveys and 10 impact evaluations.
Speciﬁcally, ﬁve work authorizations were issued for
the Corpus Christi District, 10 for the Laredo District,
ﬁve for the Pharr District, and four for the San Antonio
District. However, most of these work authorizations
were simultaneously authorized for more than one
district. The highest numbers of individual projects
were conducted in the Laredo (n=34) and San Antonio
(n=18) Districts. The Pharr District had 13 projects
and the Corpus Christi District had seven ﬁeld projects
(Table 2). Table 2 lists the work authorizations and
individual projects completed under the contract. Each
ﬁeld project has been assigned a sequential project
number on the table.

SWCA Environmental Consultants (SWCA) was
contracted by the Texas Department of Transportation
(TxDOT) through the Environmental Affairs Division
(ENV) to conduct archaeological impact evaluations
and linear surveys in the South Texas Contract Area,
which includes the Corpus Christi, Laredo, Pharr, and
San Antonio Districts (Figure 1). The project area
comprises 38 counties (Table 1). The work, which was
conducted under Contract No. 575XXSA011, began on
October 11, 2005, and concluded on January 21, 2008.
This ﬁnal report is the last component of the project.
Kevin A. Miller served as the Principal Investigator
for the project, and Brett A. Houk was the Quality
Control Ofﬁcer. The investigations were performed
under Texas Antiquities Permit 3907.
The investigations were conducted to fulﬁll TxDOT’s
obligations under the National Historic Preservation
Act (NHPA), as amended (16 U.S.C. §470) and the
Antiquities Code of Texas (Title 9, Chapter 191, Texas
Natural Resource Code). SWCA performed surveys
and impact evaluations to assist TxDOT in complying
with the requirements of their Memorandum of Understanding with the Texas Historical Commission (THC)
and a Programmatic Agreement between the Advisory
Council on Historic Preservation, the Federal Highway
Administration, the THC, and TxDOT.

This ﬁnal report includes background information on
the environmental settings and cultural histories of the
four districts, reviews the methods used to investigate
the various projects, and summarizes the results of the
investigations. This report also examines the utility
of the methods used to conduct the investigations as
techniques for ﬁnding archaeological sites and makes
recommendations for improving the methods. A glossary of technical terms comprises Appendix A. Finally,
a separate CD-ROM attachment is included with this
report that contains a PDF and Microsoft Word version
of this ﬁnal report.

An impact evaluation is deﬁned in the contract as “onsite inspection and report documenting existing impacts
or other conditions which may or may not preclude the
presence of intact archaeological deposits within the
project area for a proposed” TxDOT project. As such,
impact evaluations are a tool for conducting an initial
assessment of a proposed impact area to determine if
an archaeological survey is warranted. Impact evaluations are on the order of an initial reconnaissance and
background review and in most cases cannot be used
for a determination of site eligibility.

ENVIRONMENTAL SETTING
INTRODUCTION
The South Texas Contract Area covers a 38-county area
in south and central Texas and includes the southern
Texas coast. This area is diverse environmentally,
sharing similarities with northeastern Mexico, the
Great Plains, and the southeastern United States. The
four-district area includes portions of ﬁve of the 12
geographic regions in Texas described by Arbingast et
al. (1973) including the Gulf Coastal Plain, the South
Texas Plain, the Post Oak Belt, the Blackland Prairie,
and the Edwards Plateau (Figure 2). Similarly, the
project area covers portions of eight vegetation areas

An archaeological survey is deﬁned as “archeological
ﬁeld work…to locate archeological remains, if any,
including on-foot examination of the surface, shovel
testing, and trenching by mechanical means where
appropriate.” Under the contract, SWCA performed
only archaeological surveys. Although listed under the
contract as a possible survey method, archaeological
surveys with geoarchaeology was not utilized.

The Rio Grande Delta, the area that encompasses
Hidalgo, Cameron, and Willacy Counties, occupies
the southern half of the Pharr District. This subregion is “a ﬂuvial-deltaic environment” (Kibler
and Freeman 1993:2) and has been described as a
“geomorphically featureless deltaic plain” (Young et
al. 1999:10). Surface geology of the area comprises
Tertiary (2–66 million years ago) and Quaternary (2
million years ago to present) formations, which are
primarily ﬂoodplain deposits of stratiﬁed, Holocene
sands, silts, clays, and gravels (Barnes 1976).

Portions of the Laredo, San Antonio, and Corpus
Christi Districts fall within the Nueces-Guadalupe
Plain subdivision, the largest subarea of the South
Texas Plains. This area includes several southeastward ﬂowing rivers that dissect the subregion, dividing it into alternating riparian zones and more extensive areas of scrub-brush savanna (Black 1989b). The
climate changes from arid to semiarid to subhumid
from northwest to southeast in this subregion.

and four biotic provinces (Black 1989a). In general,
however, it is possible to discuss the project area in
terms of three areas that are environmentally distinct:
the southern, northern, and western portions.
The southern portion of the project area falls within
the South Texas Plain. The northern portion includes
the southeastern edge of the Edwards Plateau and
small strips of Blackland Prairie and Post Oak Belt.
The extreme western corner includes the Lower
Pecos region, which is distinctly different—both
environmentally and culturally—from the rest of
the project area.

The southeastern portion of the Corpus Christi District and a small area of the Pharr District are within
the Coastal Bend subregion. This area, with its subtropical climate, is ecologically diverse. Flat coastal
prairies meet small bays and tidal ﬂat areas along the
coast, all buffered by a system of barrier islands that
front the Gulf of Mexico (Black 1989b).
To the west, the southwestern portion of the Laredo
district falls within the Rio Grande Plain, the approximately one-county wide band that parallels
and drains into the Rio Grande. This area has an arid
subtropical climate and is ecologically dominated
by the Rio Grande’s plant and animal communities
(Black 1989b).

SOUTHERN PORTION OF THE PROJECT
AREA
All of the Corpus Christi and Pharr Districts and
portions of the Laredo and San Antonio Districts
are included within the South Texas Plain, the area
stretching from Cameron County in the south to
southern Bexar County in the north. While the South
Texas Plain is generally considered to be mesquite
brush country, there is signiﬁcant environmental
variation within the region. Black (1989b:Figure
19) describes ﬁve subdivisions, or biogeographical
areas, that comprise the region (Figure 3): the Rio
Grande Delta, the Rio Grande Plain, the NuecesGuadalupe Plain, the Sand Sheet, and the Coastal
Bend (which includes a portion of the Gulf Coastal
Plain geographic region deﬁned by Arbingast et al.
[1973]).

The ﬁnal subarea, known as the Sand Sheet, occurs
in the Pharr District and basically encompasses
Brooks County. This semiarid subtropical area lacks
permanent surface water and is covered by a sheet of
recent sands. The area supports thorny xeric brush
(Black 1989b).
The South Texas Plains geographic region roughly
corresponds to the Tamaulipan biotic province
deﬁned by Blair (1950) or the South Texas Plains
vegetational area deﬁned by Correll and Johnston
(1979). This area includes all of the Pharr and Corpus
Christi Districts as well as portions of the other two

districts. Many species of mammals, birds, reptiles,
and amphibians occupy, or historically occupied,
this biotic province; their distribution and densities
vary considerably and are mainly dependent upon
the local vegetational community and available water
resources.

WESTERN PORTION OF THE PROJECT AREA
The northwestern portion of the Laredo District
includes the Lower Pecos Canyonlands, “a ﬂat to
rolling rangeland dissected by entrenching tributaries
to the three major rivers—the Devils, the Pecos, and
the Rio Grande” (Turpin 2004:266). Known as the
Stockton Plateau, this portion of the Edwards Plateau
is best know archaeologically for the dry rockshelters
that occur along the steep cliff faces of the deeply
incised river and stream channels (Black 1989a).

The modern vegetation of the South Texas Plains
region does not reﬂect the prehistoric conditions of
the area (Jahrsdoerfer and Leslie 1988). Currently,
the regional vegetation is brush land dominated by
mesquite (Prosopis glandulosa) and acacia (Acacia
sp.). Other scrub and brush species found in the
region include prickly pear (Opuntia lindheimeri),
horse crippler (Echinocactus texensis), Spanish dagger (Yucca treculeana), Mexican myrtle (Malpighia
glabra), and saw greenbrier (Smilax bonanox). Vegetation along the Rio Grande is dominated by giant
reed (Arundo donax), black willow (Salix nigra),
hackberry (Celtis laevigata), black brush (Acacia
rigidula), and huisache (Acacia farnesiana) trees
(Correll and Johnston 1979; Everitt et al. 2002). In
contrast, the prehistoric indigenous ﬂora “would have
been composed of riparian lands and bottom lands
deciduous forests” (Kibler and Freeman 1993:3).

This section of the project area sits at the intersection
of the Chihuahuan and Balconian biotic provinces
(Blair 1950). This position along the margins of
two biotic provinces allows for an extremely varied
environmental setting. The vegetation in the area is
a mixture of desert-like plants in the uplands and
western half of Val Verde County and mesic, denser
vegetation along the rivers and to the east. Species
that extend eastward from the Chihuahuan biotic
province include beargrass (Nolina texana), lecheguilla (Agave lecheguilla), Texas Pistache (Pistacia
texana), and pinyon (Pinus edulis). The ﬂoodplains
and eastern regions contain hardwoods such as elms
(Ulmus crassifolia) and oaks (e.g., Quercus grisea),
as well as large cypress trees (Taxodium distichum).
The vegetation condition most characteristic of both
areas are scrub forests containing Mexican cedar (Juniperus mexicana), Texas oaks (Quercus texana), and
stunted live oaks (Quercus virginiana) (Blair 1950;
Correll and Johnson 1979; Stein et al. 2003).

Common small mammals recorded to occur in the
region include the pocket mouse (Perognathus hispidus), white-footed mouse (Peromyscus leucopus),
southern plains woodrat (Neotoma micropus), desert
cottontail (Sylvilagus audubonii), and black-tailed
jackrabbit (Lepus californicus). Large mammal species that occur or have the potential to occur within
the project area include white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus), coyote (Canis latrans), bobcat
(Lynx rufus), and javelina (Tayassu tajacu) (Davis
and Schmidly 1994; Everitt et al. 2002).

Wildlife from both the desert-like Chihuahuan biotic and the moister Balconian biotic are within this
area. A total of 57 mammalian varieties are listed
in the area (Blair 1950:113). The largest mammalian populations are white-tailed deer (Odocoileus
virginianus) and mule deer (Odocoileus hemionus).
Other mammalian varieties found include the cottontailed rabbit (Sylvilagus ﬂoridanus), javelina
(Tayassu tajacu), mountain lion (Felis concolor),
coyote (Canis latrans), fox (Vulpes velox), raccoon (Procyon lotor), beaver (Castor canadensis),
porcupine (Erethizon dorsatum), and other small
mammals such as mice and squirrels. Ethnohistoric
records indicate an abundance of bison in the area
at the time of European contact (Turpin 1998:6).

Common bird species of the brush and scrub vegetational community include the mourning dove
(Zenaida macroura), northern mockingbird (Mimus
polyglottos), house sparrow (Passer domesticus),
olive sparrow (Arremonops rufivirgatus), the
northern bobwhite (Colinus virginianus), red-tailed
hawk (Buteo jamaicensis), and long-billed thrasher
(Toxostoma longirostre). Besides mammals and
birds, various snakes include Mexican hook-nosed
snake (Ficimia streckeri), southwestern rat snake
(Elaphe guttata meahllmorum), Texas long-nosed
snake (Rhinocheilus lecontei tessellatus), and lizards,
12

and eastern extents of the biotic zone (Neck 1986).
Common mammals of the area include white-tailed
deer (Odocoileus virginianus), plains pocket gopher
(Geomys bursarius), cottontail rabbit (Sylvilagus
ﬂoridanus), opossum (Didelphis virginiana), raccoon
(Procyon lotor), nine-banded armadillo (Dasypus
novemcinctus), black-tailed jackrabbit (Lepus californicus), and deer mouse (Peromyscus maniculatis).
Less common are the predatory mammals including
the bobcat (Lynx rufus), coyote (Canis latrans), and
gray fox (Urocyon cinereoargenteous). In addition to
these common mammals, bison (Bison bison), mountain lion (Felis concolor), and black bear (Ursus
americanus) would have been available prehistorically (Davis and Schmidly 1994; Hudler 2000).

A large variety of snakes including Central Texas
whipsnake (Masticphis taeniatus girardi), Mexican
hog-nosed snake (Heterodon nasicus kennerlyi),
and Baird’s rat snake (Elaphe bairdi) are recorded
for this area (Werler and Dixon 2004). Other wildlife recorded for the area includes amphibians, and
aquatic life within the rivers and streams, including
fresh-water mussels. Bird varieties include hawks,
eagles, and doves.

NORTHERN PORTIONS OF THE PROJECT
AREA (SOUTHERN CENTRAL TEXAS)
The northern counties in the San Antonio District
fall within the limits of Central Texas, the area generally corresponds to the Edwards Plateau. Bexar
County, which is near the geographic center of the
district, lies on the margins of the Edwards Plateau,
South Texas Plains, and Blackland Prairie vegetative
regions as deﬁned by Correll and Johnston (1979).
The Balcones Escarpment forms a sharp vegetative
boundary between the thin-soiled limestone uplands
and the wide coastal plains.

There are at least 75 species of amphibians and
reptiles listed within the Balconian Province (Blair
1950). The Balcones Escarpment has been shown to
be a major limiting factor in the movement of these
species (Smith and Buechner 1947). Bird species
composition in the project area is fairly diverse
with numerous breeding, migrant, and wintering
species present (Kutac and Caran 1994). Common
species both migratory and resident found in the
area include bobwhite quail (Colinus virginianus),
northern cardinal (Cardinalis cardinalis), wood duck
(Aix sponsus), canvasback (Aythy valisineria), tufted
titmouse (Parus bicolor), Berwick’s wren (Thryomanes bewickii), mourning dove (Zenaida macroura), northern mockingbird (Mimus polyglottos),
red-tailed hawk (Buteo jamaicensis), wild turkey
(Melagris gallopavio), and turkey vulture (Cathartes
aura) (Hudler 2000:20; Kutac and Caran 1994).

The Edwards Plateau is dominated by a mixed live
oak (Quercus virginiana)/Ashe juniper (Juniperus
ashei) woodland interspersed with occasional grassy
openings. Other tree species present in low densities
throughout upland areas of the project area include
cedar elm (Ulmus crassifolia), blackjack oak (Quercus marilandica), Texas oak (Quercus texana), and
some mesquite (Prosopis glandulosa). Shrub density
varies between low to dense in upland areas. Species
occurring in low densities include Texas persimmon
(Diospyros texana), agarita (Berberis trifoliolata),
and prickly pear (Opuntia spp.) with thick, mixed
grasses in areas (Hudler 2000; Stein et al. 2003;
Van Auken 1988). In contrast, Hudler (2000:102)
notes that pollen data recovered from north Bexar
County determined that prehistoric indigenous ﬂora
was generally more productive than today. This
research suggests that over the last 12,000 years the
ﬂora community was typically more abundant and
ﬂourishing than is observed in the region currently
(Hudler 2000).

CULTURAL HISTORIES
INTRODUCTION
The four TxDOT districts composing the South Texas
Contract Area fall within four archaeological regions
of Texas (i.e., South Texas Region, Central Texas
Region, Coastal Texas Region, and Lower Pecos
Region) (Figure 4). Although the archaeological
regions are not absolute, they do generally reﬂect
recognized biotic communities and physiographic
areas in Texas (Perttula 2004:6). The South Texas
Region extends from the Rio Grande River to the
margins of the Edwards Plateau and encompasses
most of the South Texas Contract Area. The Central
Texas Region, as its name implies, is situated in the

This portion of the project area also falls within the
Balconian biotic zone (Blair 1950). Approximately
50 percent of all non-marine mammal species in
Texas exist along the Balcones Escarpment, the
prominent geological feature that marks the southern

center of Texas and covers the Edwards Plateau and
portions of the Blackland prairie east of the Edwards
Plateau. The Coastal Texas Region extends from the
gulf shoreline and barrier islands inland to encompass
the coastal plain, which is roughly 25–30 miles wide
(Ricklis 2004:156). Centered on the mouth of the
Pecos River in Val Verde County, the Lower Pecos
Region extends approximately 90 miles north of the
Rio Grande. The South Texas Contract Area entirely
encompasses the South Texas Region, covers almost
the entire Lower Pecos Region and the Coastal Texas
Region, and envelops only the southern margins of
the Central Texas Region (see Figure 4). The following regional synopses provide basic culture histories
of each region. Portions of this section were supplied
by TxDOT under the terms of previously authorized
Contract # 572XXSA003 and sections are taken
directly from Fields et al. (2002).

Archaic subperiods. Additionally, within these divisions are a “plague” of phases, foci, complexes,
traditions and horizons, some of which are fairly
clearly deﬁned while others remain ambiguous or
have become obsolete.

PALEOINDIAN PERIOD
The Paleoindian Period (11,000–8,000 B.P.) spans the
time of initial settlement to the advent of regional
identities that mark the beginnings of the later Archaic period hunter-gatherers (Black 1989b:48). These
earliest groups—distinguished in the archaeological
record by various lanceolate points, including Clovis, Folsom, Plainview, Golondrina, and Angostura
types—are generally inferred to have been small,
highly mobile bands relying on large game animals
for their basic livelihoods. Although a fairly large
number of diagnostic artifacts dating to this period
have been recovered from South Texas, no clearly
intact sites have been investigated in the region.
Consequently, the nature of Paleoindian adaptation
to South Texas remains poorly understood, relying
largely on inferences from better-studied sites in
adjacent areas such as the Southern Plains, Lower
Pecos, and Central Texas.

SOUTH TEXAS
This archaeological region includes the Pharr District, most of the Laredo and San Antonio Districts,
and only a small portion of the Corpus Christi District
(see Figure 4). Major river basins in South Texas
include the Rio Grande, the Nueces River, and the
Guadalupe River. The San Antonio, Medina, Frio,
and Atascosa rivers are prominent tributaries to these
primary rivers.

To summarize the distribution of Paleoindian sites
in Texas, Bousman et al. (2004:15–97) compiled a
table of Paleoindian components in Texas using data
from the Texas Archeological Research Laboratory
(TARL). This research, with records dated up to
1994, found that counties within the South Texas
Region have 53 sites that contain at least one Paleoindian component (Bousman et al. 2004:Table 2.2).
Of note, a number of these counties (e.g., Bee and
Bexar Counties) lie along the margins of the South
Texas Region and another archaeological region.
Therefore, the sites indicated on the table may fall
within one of the adjacent archaeological regions
(e.g., Coastal Texas Region). Of those counties
clearly within the boundaries of the South Texas
Region, Dimmitt and McMullen County contained
the most recorded Paleoindian sites within this region
with six sites and nine sites, respectively (Bousman
et al. 2004:Table 2.2). Some researchers have suggested that the high frequency of Paleoindian sites
may be attributed to migratory rounds from the
Edwards Plateau to the playa-prairie savannah of
South Texas (personal communication, Al McGraw
2008). Speciﬁcally, Paleoindian groups may have

Deeply stratiﬁed open campsites do occur in southern
Texas, but these are rare and the vast majority of the
region’s sites lack integrity, as a result of erosion
and repetitive occupation on stable surfaces (Hester
2004). The resultant contextual problems have posed
difﬁculties in establishing precise chronologies and
deﬁning assemblages or complexes. However, to
redress these problems there has been a growing
focus on sites with stratiﬁed deposits and isolable
components with dateable materials. Based on data
derived from these efforts, the region’s prehistory
has undergone several substantial reﬁnements and
revisions in recent years. The following chronology
incorporates many of these changes.
The archaeological remains of South Texas provide
evidence of at least 11,000 years of cultural occupation (Hester 2004:133). This long chronology is
divided into four basic cultural periods: Paleoindian,
Archaic, Late Prehistoric, and Historic. The Archaic
is further subdivided into Early, Middle and Late

sites in Victoria County), and Central Texas (e.g.,
Pavo Real, Gault Site).

exploited resources along the Nueces, Frio, and San
Miguel waterways that cross through Dimmitt and
McMullen Counties.

The early lithic technology of the Paleoindians consisted mainly of the ﬂuted projectile points and specialized blade core production (Hester 2004). At the
later end of this period, projectile point styles change
to non-ﬂuted, lanceolate types such as Angostura
and Golondrina (Black 1989b:49). In addition, the
poorly dated Lerma dart point has been tentatively
assigned to this period (Epstein 1969; Suhm et al.
1954), but the continuing lack of corroborating data
makes this style increasingly suspect as a legitimate
type (Hester 1995). The important transitional stage
between the Paleoindian period and the subsequent
Early Archaic Period is poorly understood in this
region. However, it is generally believed there was
a transition from big-game hunting to a generalized
hunting and gathering strategy at the later part of the
Paleoindian Period (Black 1989b). An accompanying technological shift from lanceolate points to
stemmed dart points appears to have also occurred.

Clovis points mark the earliest identiﬁed Paleoindian
groups in the region. In a survey of ﬂuted points reported from throughout the state, Bever and Meltzer
(2007:67–70) identiﬁed 55 Clovis points recovered
from the counties comprising the South Texas region. Two trends are evident in their ﬁndings. First,
Clovis points are rare in the coastal areas, including
the Rio Grande Delta (Pharr District). Only four
points were reported from the Pharr District counties
(Bever and Meltzer 2007:67–70). The ﬁve Clovis
points recovered from the counties comprising the
Corpus Christi District further substantiate the rarity of these early sites along the coast. Second, the
vast majority of Clovis points in South Texas have
been recovered from the Nueces-Guadalupe Plain,
which includes most of the San Antonio and part of
the Laredo Districts. Bever and Meltzer (2007:91)
also determined that roughly 76 percent of the Clovis
point raw material originated from the Edwards Plateau, but the distribution suggests the Clovis groups
focused on the Nueces-Guadalupe Plain in the South
Texas region.

ARCHAIC PERIOD
Most of the archaeological evidence from this period
derives from investigations at Choke Canyon in Live
Oak and McMullen Counties, Chaparrosa Ranch in
Zavala County, Duval County, Chacon Creek in Zavala and Uvalde Counties, the Falcon Reservoir area
in Zapata and Starr Counties, and the Laredo area in
Webb County. Additionally, numerous isolated studies ﬁll in gaps to present a relatively broad set of data.
Much of the recent work has been conducted along
the border counties, where increased international
commerce has supported numerous infrastructural
improvements (i.e., roads, border crossings, and
border safety inspection facilities).

Folsom point distributions, both the frequency and
spatial patterning, differ from the Clovis patterns,
suggesting a shift in adaptation patterns (Bever and
Meltzer 2007; Meltzer and Bever 1995:60 and 74).
Folsom points appear more frequently in the coastal
plain as well as the South Texas plain, most notably
the Nueces-Guadalupe Plain. Although Folsom
points have been recovered from the plateau (i.e.,
Kincaid Rockshelter), this is the exception and are
conspicuously lacking in the Edwards Plateau (Collins 2004). As Folsom points are almost exclusively
found in plains settings, the technology perhaps
marks a more specialized adaptation, likely to a more
intensive reliance on ancient bison.

Early Archaic (8,000–4,500 B.P.) populations appear to have shifted subsistence practices towards
an increased reliance on plant food resources and
small game (Black 1989b:49). Early Archaic artifacts found in the region are triangular and stemmed
projectile points found throughout South Texas and
adjacent areas of northern Mexico. For the Early
Archaic Period, Hester (1995, 2004) distinguishes
between the “Early Corner Notched Horizon” consisting of Martindale-Uvalde-Baker point types and
the later “Early Basal Notched Horizon” consisting
of Andice and Bell point types. Some researchers

Later Paleoindian points are also common in the
region, but like the earlier sites, no intact sites dating to these times have been systematically studied
in South Texas. The nearest sites with reasonably
good integrity are located in the Lower Pecos (e.g.,
Baker Cave, Hinds Cave, Devil’s Mouth, and Eagle
Cave), the coastal plain (e.g., Berger Bluff, Berclair
Terrace, also known as Buckner Ranch, and several
16

The Late Archaic Period (2,400–1,150 B.P.) represents a continuation of trends begun in the Middle
Archaic, mainly increasing population and intensive
exploitation of the environment (Black 1989b:51;
Terneny 2005:98). Late Archaic sites are common
throughout South Texas in all topographic settings.
The presence of large cemeteries along the coast and
eastern portions of South Texas suggest increased
population densities for this period (Black 1989b).
As with the preceding period, populations in the Late
Archaic exploited plant food resources, small game,
and aquatic resources. Unstemmed dart points of the
Matamoros and Catan types have commonly been
considered diagnostic artifacts of the Late Archaic,
although a number of studies (e.g., Shiner 1983) have
questioned the integrity of the types. A recent study
by Mahoney et al. (2002) indicates these are neither
viable types nor chronological markers. Distinctions
between the Matamoras and Tortuga points and the
Abasolo and Catan types cannot be clearly deﬁned,
but rather are part of a continuum in size with no
discernible temporal distinctions. Other point types
from this period commonly found in the region include Shumla, which are somewhat better deﬁned
based on studies in the Lower Pecos area.

note that Martindale-Uvalde point types are equivalent to Baker-Brady point types in the Lower Pecos,
respectively (Johnson and Goode 1994). Thus, there
appears to be some overlapping diachronic and synchronic cultural spheres possibly from Central Texas,
Lower Pecos, and Southern Texas regions (personal
communication, Al McGraw 2008). Cultural materials from this period indicate an increased use of
stone-lined hearths and the probable exploitation of
terrestrial and aquatic food resources. Sites are generally found on high terraces or upland areas. However,
as with the Paleoindian Period, Early Archaic sites
and materials are generally uncommon in the Rio
Grande Plain, and this period of human occupation
is presently poorly understood (Black 1989b).
The Middle Archaic Period (4,500–2,400 B.P.) sites
are much more commonly found in South Texas than
in those of earlier periods, and the sites seem to occur in a much broader range of topographic settings
(Black 1989b:49). The Middle Archaic is interpreted
to have been a period characterized by population
increases, an expansion of lithic technologies, and
more intensive utilization of plant food resources.
Larger, compacted hearths and ground stone tools
are believed to indicate increased utilization of plant
foods (Black 1989b). Dart points, unifacial scrapers,
and preforms found at Middle Archaic sites suggest
hunting and manufacturing activities. Gouges are
present in artifact assemblages in increased numbers over the preceding period, possibly suggesting
increased wood- or hide-working activities (Hester
2004). The appearance of projectile point types
typical of other regions and marine shell originating from outside the area suggest an expansion of
trade/exchange networks in the region. Burial of the
dead in cemeteries appears to be more common in
this period as evidenced by excavations at the Loma
Sandia Site in Live Oak County (Taylor and Highley
1995). However, some researchers propose that these
Archaic cemeteries may be attributed to a cultural
intrusion and not associated with indigenous groups
(personal communication, Al McGraw 2008). Dart
points from this period consist of Tortugas, Abasolo,
Carrizo, and Bulverde types. However, as discussed
below, the unstemmed points are fairly ambiguous
chronological markers. Of note, the small triangular
point tradition is reported to dominate the regional
assemblages south of the Nueces River (personal
communication, Al McGraw 2008).

LATE PREHISTORIC PERIOD
The technological innovations of ceramics and the
bow and arrow are typically regarded as marking the
beginning of the Late Prehistoric (1,150–350 B.P.)
(Black 1989b:51; Terneny 2005:98–99). Prehistoric
sites from this period are often the best preserved,
most distinctive, and visible of all periods in South
Texas. Ceramics dating to this period are generally
bone tempered (Black 1989b:52). Late Prehistoric
settlement patterns suggest increased mobility,
perhaps an effect of greater reliance on bison as a
subsistence mainstay. Faunal assemblages dating to
the Late Prehistoric show an increased consumption
of bison, deer, and antelope (Black 1989b; Hester
2004). At the Hinojosa Site in Jim Wells County,
the well-preserved faunal remains associated with a
Toyah occupation showed dependence on deer and
antelope, and to a lesser extent, bison (Black 1986).
Adoption and use of the bow and arrow may have
facilitated the shift in balance between animal and
plant foods. In South Texas, common arrow point
types include Perdiz, Scallorn, Fresno, Starr, and
Zavala. The social and material culture of the period

later became the Old San Antonio Road. These
expeditions established missions and presidios on
the margins of South Texas in Guerrero, the San
Antonio area, and along the Coastal Bend on the
San Antonio and Guadalupe Rivers, but founded no
substantial settlements in the South Texas region. The
Paso de Francia crossing along with Paso Paquache
were the most commonly used in the eighteenth and
nineteenth centuries (personal communication, Al
McGraw 2008).

can be inferred to some degree by the ethnohistorical
record, as discussed below.

HISTORIC PERIOD
The early phase of the Historic Period included
Spanish exploration and expansion into South
Texas, colonization of areas along the Rio Grande,
and the attempted missionization of the local Native
American groups. In 1519, Alonso de Piñeda, sailing on behalf of conquistador Francisco Garay, ﬁrst
charted the South Texas coastline, discovering the
mouth of Rio de las Palmas (Rio Grande). Piñeda
camped along the river delta for 40 days, reporting
to Garay about the area’s promise for settlement
(Sánchez 1992:53). Garay subsequently supported
two attempts to establish a settlement in the Rio
Grande Delta, but hostile natives and the inhospitable landscape thwarted both. Following these ﬁrst
entries into Texas, in 1535, after living seven years
among the Texas coastal inhabitants, Cabeza de Vaca
and several other castaways from Narvaez’s ill-fated
expedition crossed along the northern margin of the
region on their journey back to Spanish colonies in
Mexico. His account of the ordeal provides some
of the more detailed information on the area and its
native inhabitants.

In 1746, Spain established the new province of
Nuevo Santander and appointed Jose de Escandon
as its ﬁrst governor. The province, named after the
Governor’s birthplace in northern Spain, included
almost the entire Northeastern Mexico-South Texas
archaeological region, extending as far north as the
San Antonio River although the boundary was ultimately shifted south to the Nueces River. From 1746
to 1755, Escandon, still recognized in South Texas
as the “greatest colonizer of Northern Mexico” and
the “Father of the Lower Rio Grande”, established
many of the settlements that comprise the modern
landscape and introduced the great ranches that still
characterize the regional economy. Among the 23
towns he laid out were six along the Rio Grande
that includes Laredo, Dolores, Revilla (now Guerrero Viejo), Miers, Camargo, and Reynosa. Many of
these names originated from place names his home
providence of Santander. Escandon also established
routes through the area. One of Escandon’s settlers,
rancher Tomas Sanchez de la Barrera y Gallardo from
Nuevo Leon, established Laredo at the ford known as
Paso de Jacinto on May 15, 1755. The signiﬁcance
of this crossing was borne out by subsequent travels
into Texas.

Subsequent European travels through the area were
spurred by confrontations between the French, the
Spanish, and possibly even the Dutch (Sánchez
1992:62). From his base at Fort St. Louis, La Salle
evidently ventured as far west as the Nueces and
possibly the Rio Grande in 1685–1686 to assess the
Spanish presence on their northern frontier (Stephens
and Holmes 1989:11). However, no clear evidence
verifying the westward exploration by La Salle has
yet to be encountered and this interpretation is disputed. In return, Spain sent out several expeditions by
land and sea beginning in 1686 in search of La Salle
(Chipman 1992:77–85). However, it was not until
two expeditions led by Alonso de Leon, in 1689 and
1690, that the searches were successful. He crossed
the Rio Grande at the Paso de Francia near the later
town of Guerrero, then continued northeastward to
the Nueces River and onward to the east (McGraw
1991:129). This route through South Texas, crossing
at the Paso de Francia, was generally followed by
numerous subsequent Spanish expeditions from the
1690s through the early 1700s, effectively establish-

After the boundary between the French and Spanish
territories was resolved in 1763, Spain devoted its resources to colonization and exploration of the Texas
frontier. Rubi’s 1767 inspection tour crossed north
of present-day Eagle Pass and returned through the
region, crossing the Rio Grande at Rancho Dolores
about 20 miles south of present day Laredo (personal
communication, Al McGraw 2008). This latter route
was followed by Solís the following year.

ETHNOHISTORICAL INDIGENOUS GROUPS

the larger groups “each family …or two together
travel around the hills, living two days here and four
there” (De Leon as cited by Griffen 1969:115). In
addition to these groupings, sources often refer to
a larger group, a “nation”. This group is the largest
identity, but it is unclear if this level of tribal organization was ever a viable political entity until later
ethnohistorical times when regional groups united
to confront colonial advancement and decimation.
From the early seventeenth century to the nineteenth
century, increased pressures from southward territorial expansion by the Apache and Comanches and
northward Spanish expansion effectively destroyed
these indigenous groups.

The Spanish chroniclers of these expeditions and
early missionaries provide ethnohistorical descriptions of the native groups in South Texas at the
time of contact. Their accounts deﬁned the groups
in northeast Mexico as “Coahuileños”. From the
recorded fragments of the language of these groups,
Mexican linguists deﬁned the Coahuilteco language
in the 1860s, and later researchers constructed the
larger Coahuiltecan linguistic family, which was surmised to include the language of groups throughout
the northeast Mexico-South Texas region. Although
some (i.e., Ruecking 1953, 1955a, 1955b; Newcomb
1961) have proposed a broad Coahuiltecan culture as
well as a linguistic grouping, “this belief in a widespread linguistic and cultural uniformity was [later]
seriously questioned” (Campbell 1983:343). Recent
research has perhaps substantiated this notion. For
example Johnson and Campbell (1991) deﬁned the
previously unidentiﬁed Sanan language among mission Indians in the region. In part there was perhaps
a rush to judgment in deﬁning a “monolithic adaptation” that led to an oversight in variability.

EARLY ANGLO SETTLEMENT
From early times the United States considered
expansion into the American Southwest. Conﬂict
with the Spanish began with the ﬁrst incursions
by Anglo explorers. In 1801, the remainder of the
Philip Nolan’s defeated expedition was marched
down the Camino Real to Chihuahua. To determine
their fate, the nine survivors were forced to roll dice
from a crystal glass onto the skin of a drum (a low
four resulted in execution). U.S. Army Lieutenant
Zebulon Pike, on an expedition to the American
Southwest in 1806–1807, was captured by the Spanish and returned to the United States under military
escort through modern-day Eagle Pass and on to
San Antonio. Although forbidden to take notes, Pike
secretly recorded observations of northern Mexico
and Texas, hiding his notes by stufﬁng them down
his troops’riﬂe barrels. Of signiﬁcance, his favorable
reports of Texas publicized the potential for farming and ranching, thereby fostering an Anglo drive
towards settlement.

Nevertheless, the ethnohistorical record suggests
some commonalities among the groups in the region.
All were nomadic hunter/gatherers who moved
around the landscape exploiting seasonal foods
(Campbell and Campbell 1981), most likely within
clearly deﬁned territories. Griffen (1969:115) cites a
number of early descriptions of highly mobile groups
moving within clearly recognized and “marked”
areas. Alonso de Leon, who was observing groups
south of the Rio Grande in 1689, describes the social
organization and settlement patterns that were commonly noted elsewhere in the region. He describes
two distinct groupings using terms familiar to his
own society: the “rancheria” and “rancho”. The
former group is larger and presumably the size of a
band. Based on ethnographic accounts of groups in
northeastern Mexico, Griffen (1969:115) infers an
average band size of 40–60 persons with recorded
variations ranging from roughly 25–75 individuals.
These rancherias often comprised about 15 bellshaped huts arranged in rows or a crescent formation. Each house contained a central ﬁre said to be
used mainly for illumination (Campbell 1983:51).
As described by De Leon, the smaller group occupying the rancho was a family unit. When not in

Under Mexican rule (1821 to 1836), South Texas
was made part of the state of Coahuila y Texas in
1824 and later subdivided among the Department of
Bexar, and the states of Tamaulipas, and Coahuila.
Two empresario grants were established in South
Texas, including the McMullen and McGloin grant
in the central part of the region and the Woodbury
grant to the north. The former brought in settlers from
Ireland, creating an Irish-Mexican-Anglo culture in
South Texas.

COASTAL BEND AND CENTRAL COASTAL
PLAIN

PALEOINDIAN PERIOD
The earliest occupation of the coastal plain occurred
in the Paleoindian period ca. 11,000–8,000 B.P. The
ﬁrst half of this period is marked by the occurrence
of Clovis and Folsom dart points, almost always
in isolated contexts. For instance, a Clovis point
was recovered from San Patricio County near the
mouth of the Nueces River (Hester 1976), and a
Folsom point was recovered on Oso Creek (Hester
1980:6). Excavated Paleoindian components on the
coastal plain include the deep terrace sites of Buckner
Ranch located in Bee County, the Berger Bluff site
in Goliad County, and the Johnston-Heller and J-2
Ranch sites in Victoria County. The Buckner Ranch
site produced late Pleistocene fauna and hearth-like
clusters of burned rocks, as well as Folsom, Plainview, Scottsbluff, and Angostura points (Sellards
1940). Hester (1980:8–9), in a re-evaluation of
Sellards’s data, concluded that the site “served as a
campsite for a succession of Paleo-Indian groups”
possibly spanning 3,000 years. Although this site is
the only one of the excavated components to produce
a Folsom point, in a more recent discussion Hester
(2004:134) states “no Folsom camps or kill sites
have been located.”

The Corpus Christi District is located in the Coastal
Bend area and extends into the Central Coastal
Plain. The Southern Portion of the San Antonio
District includes a portion of the Central Coastal
Plain. Many people, institutions, and governmental
agencies have undertaken archaeological investigations on the central coastal plain of Texas. Among
the more prominent of these are excavations by The
University of Texas at Austin and the Works Progress
Administration at the Johnson and Kent-Crane sites
in the Copano Bay and Aransas Bay areas (Campbell 1947, 1952); Story’s (1968) excavations at the
Ingleside Cove and Anaqua sites in San Patricio
and Jackson Counties; excavations at 41AU37 and
41AU38 along Allen’s Creek in southern Austin
County by The University of Texas at Austin (Hall
1981); excavations by The University of Texas at
San Antonio (UTSA) at the Hinojosa site situated
approximately 60 km inland from Corpus Christi
Bay (Black 1986); explorations by the THC in the
projected area of Palmetto Bend Reservoir along
the Lavaca and Navidad Rivers of Jackson County
(Mallouf et al. 1973); UTSA survey and site testing
in the area of Coleto Creek Reservoir in Victoria
and Goliad Counties (Fox and Hester 1976; Fox et
al. 1979); extensive survey and excavation efforts,
primarily by UTSA, at Choke Canyon Reservoir in
Live Oak and McMullen Counties (Hall et al. 1981,
1986); excavations by TxDOT at the Loma Sandia
site in Live Oak County and subsequent analysis
by The University of Texas at Austin (Taylor and
Highley 1995); Robert A. Ricklis’s (1989, 1996)
work at the Holmes and McKinzie sites, among
others, in the Corpus Christi and Copano Bay area;
testing and data recovery excavations at sites along
the Victoria Barge Canal in Victoria and Calhoun
Counties (Gadus et al. 1999; Weinstein 1992); and
recent work by the THC at La Salle’s Fort St. Louis
(Davis and Bruseth 2000), as well as work at other
Spanish Colonial Mission-period sites (Calhoun
1999; Hindes et al. 1999; Ricklis 1999; Walter 1999).
Summaries of the prehistory of the region based on
these investigations, and more complete bibliographies concerning previous work, have been compiled
by Black (1989b), Weinstein (1992), Hester (2004),
Ricklis (2004), and Tomka et al. (1997).

Late Paleoindian points such as Plainview and
Golondrina have been recovered from the JohnstonHeller site and the J-2 Ranch site (Birmingham and
Hester 1976; Fox et al. 1979). Clear Fork tools also
were recovered at the Johnston-Heller site. The
Berger Bluff site, now inundated by Coleto Creek
Reservoir, produced a deeply buried hearth dated to
ca. 8,000–6,000 B.P. This site is of interest because
its faunal assemblage includes small animals not
thought to be characteristic of a Paleoindian biggame subsistence pattern (Brown 1996: 497–498;
Weinstein 1992:60). Investigation of these components indicates the earliest Americans’ long-lived,
slowly changing adaptation to the near-coast.
Evidence of Paleoindian use of the coastal zone also
comes from isolated ﬁnds in eroded or disturbed contexts. The erosion is in part the result of a dramatic
sea level change associated with the end of the last
glaciation. At that time, sea level was much lower
than today, and the Gulf shoreline was appreciably
farther south of its present position (Aten 1983:117,
146). As sea level began to rise, it likely inundated
many Paleoindian sites. Both artifacts and fossil
20

the number of coastal components increased, as did
the intensity of the occupations. It appears that both
shellﬁsh and ﬁsh were exploited to the extent that
these early components likely functioned as ﬁshing
camps (Ricklis 1988:101–102, 2004:161–165).

bones have been recovered from Texas beaches and
are believed to be eroding from submerged, relict
deltaic landforms that contain these ancient sites.
One such area that has produced artifacts and fossil
bones is 41MG4, the Sargent Beach site. The site
produced one late Paleoindian Angostura point, as
well as Archaic Pedernales and Kent points and fossil
bones, including horse, bison, and mammoth teeth.
Fossil bones and teeth of mastodon, mammoth, bison, horse, camel, deer, and turtle without associated
artifacts have been recovered from several nearby
disposal areas for dredged materials along the Gulf
Intracoastal Waterway west of the San Bernard River
(Black and Cox 1983) and to the south in alluvium of
the ancestral Palo Blanco River of northern Kenedy
County (Shum 1980).

The coastline reached its present position in the Middle Archaic, which lasted from roughly 4,200–3,100
B.P., with the climate approaching modern conditions at the end of the period (Ricklis 2004:165).
It has been suggested that these changes may have
enhanced coastal resources enough that populations and site densities increased (Story 1985:39,
1990:244). Toward the end of this period, extensive
shell middens appeared, signaling that the bays and
estuaries had developed to the extent that shellﬁsh
had become a ubiquitous resource. On the coast in
Aransas and Nueces Counties, this intensive exploitation of estuarine resources was ﬁrst given the
appellation Aransas Focus (Campbell 1947, 1952).
Distinctive shell tools such as Busycon whorl scrapers and columella gouges mark Aransas sites. Similar
tools have been recovered from shell midden sites
as far north along the coast as Lavaca Bay and the
lower reach of Caney Creek in Matagorda County
(Fritz 1975:129).

Toward the end of the Paleoindian period, a disruption in large game populations may have precipitated
a greater reliance on a broad-based subsistence
strategy (Aten 1983:152–157). This presumed but
probably overstated change in subsistence strategy
has been used to mark the beginning of the Archaic
period. There also is evidence of climatic ﬂuctuations
and additional episodes of sea level rise within this
period. These ﬂuctuations have been used to divide
the Archaic into early, middle, and late subperiods.

To tighten the chronological and spatial parameters
for this archaeological manifestation, the Aransas
Focus was deﬁned for the Late Archaic period based
on work at the Kent-Crane site (Campbell 1958;
Corbin 1974). The Middle Archaic manifestation has
been labeled the Kent Phase (Weinstein 1992:61).
Projectile points including Matamoros, Bulverde,
and Palmillas mark the Kent Phase. Other Middle
Archaic period projectile points with inland ties
include Morhiss, Nolan, Travis, and Refugio (Black
1989b:49; Weinstein1992:61).

ARCHAIC PERIOD
The Early Archaic spans the period from approximately 7,500–4,200 B.P. when sea level was still well
south of its present location (Ricklis 2004:161). As
with Paleoindian sites, few Early Archaic sites are
known, and it has been suggested that populations
and site densities continued to be low on the entire
coastal plain (Story 1985:37). Projectile points diagnostic of the period include Gower, Wells, Bell,
Andice, Martindale, Uvalde, and related forms
(Black 1989b:49; Weinstein 1992:57). Inland along
the edge of the coastal plain, sites are associated with
upland landforms and high terraces, though several
components within deep alluvium are known from
the Choke Canyon area of Live Oak County (Scott
and Fox 1982). Examples of sites from the coastal
bend include 41VT17 (Fox and Hester 1976), the
McKenzie site (Ricklis 1988), and the Swan Lake
site (Prewitt et al. 1987). Though the Early Archaic
components at these sites are ephemeral, they demonstrate early use of the estuarine bay shore environment. During the late part of the Early Archaic,

Inland, data from the Choke Canyon Reservoir sites
suggest that open camps along stream courses on
natural levees and low terraces marked the Middle
Archaic period. Features such as formal hearths,
earth ovens, and concentrations of burned rocks point
to an emphasis on use of plant resources (Hall et al.
1986). Possible baking pit features with associated
concentrations of burned rocks also have been identiﬁed at coastal shell midden sites. One such Middle
Archaic shell midden, 41CL9 situated in Calhoun
County along the upper Guadalupe River estuary,
also produced faunal data indicating that terrestrial
21

resources contributed signiﬁcantly to the coastal
resource base (Gadus et al. 1999:35–73). These
data suggest that, in general, subsistence practices
may not have differed greatly between coastal and
inland sites.

site in Live Oak County (Taylor and Highley 1995).
But Hall (1995b:645–646) points out that though the
grave furnishings from Loma Sandia suggest interaction with nearby coastal cultures, the overriding
connection appears to be with cultures of the Rio
Grande Plain. These suggested differences in interaction provide data needed for understanding territorial afﬁliations across the coastal plain. Of note, as
McGraw points out (personal communication, 2008),
the Loma Sandia Cemetery is the southernmost in
an apparent chain of cemeteries that extend from
the Nueces to the Guadalupe Rivers. Although the
cemeteries do imply an increase in population, the
apparent overriding association with the Rio Grande
Plain is questionable.

The Late Archaic period, which dates from ca.
3,100–950 B.P., is marked by a continuation and
intensiﬁcation of adaptations on the coast (Ricklis
2004:165–171). Some sites, such as Mustang Lake
on San Antonio Bay and Ingleside Cove on Corpus
Christi Bay, produce faunal data that suggest intensive ﬁshing (Ricklis 2004:168–169). Inland, the
presence of grinding implements and large deposits
of burned rocks at the Choke Canyon sites suggest
continued, intensive exploitation of plant resources
(Hester 2004:140). Point types found on the coast
include Ensor, Darl, and Fairland. Inland point types
for this period include Frio, Marcos, Montell, Morhiss, Castroville, and Ellis (Black 1989b:51; Weinstein 1992:57). Overall, this period saw a continued
increase in populations and trend toward deﬁned
territories (Story 1985:44–45, 48).

LATE PREHISTORIC PERIOD
The Late Prehistoric period began variously along
the Texas coastal plain at ca. 950–250 B.P. (Ricklis
2004:171). Of note, the Late Prehistoric period ended
a little earlier (ca. 480 B.P.) upon the arrival of Cabeza de Vaca, discussed below (Hester 1999:17–19).
However, the Late Prehistoric period terminus is here
deﬁned as the introduction of the Historic period
for the entire region. The Late Prehistoric period is
marked by the addition of pottery and the bow and arrow to an otherwise Archaic technological repertoire
(Aten 1983:297–304; Corbin 1976:91; Weinstein
1992:57). Scallorn arrow points, one of the earliest
forms found on the coast, have been recovered from
burials at the Blue Bayou site dating to the early Late
Prehistoric, ca. 1,520–960 B.P. (Huebner 1988). Scallorn points and expanding-stem arrow point forms
also were recovered from more-inland sites such
as the Berger Bluff site located in Goliad County
(Brown 1983) and sites in the Choke Canyon area of
Live Oak County (Hall et al. 1986). In many cases,
no ceramics were associated with these components,
suggesting separate arrival or development of the two
technologies. Similarities of these components to
the early Late Prehistoric Austin Phase components
of Central Texas have been acknowledged (Brown
1983: 80–81; Weinstein 1992:63).

One indication of population increase is the expansion of formal cemeteries. Cemeteries appeared in the
Middle Archaic period and grew in size and number
though the Late Archaic and into the Late Prehistoric
period (Hall 1995a:56–57). An extensive Middle
Archaic through Late Prehistoric period cemetery
has been excavated at Allen’s Creek (Hall 1981).
The site, 41AU36, is located on the Brazos River
approximately 115 km north of the coast in Austin
County. Burials showed an increase in traumatic
deaths, speciﬁcally during the Late Archaic period,
that might be considered evidence of an escalation
in hostilities suggesting greater territorial competition (Hall 1981:284–285). Closer to the coast, the
Blue Bayou cemetery (41VT94) and the Morhiss
cemetery (41VT1) are situated on the lower reach of
the Guadalupe River in Victoria County (Campbell
1976:81–85; Huebner 1988). The Morhiss cemetery
has been dated to the Archaic period by diagnostic
projectile points recovered from the associated
habitation site. Because shell ornaments and many
lithic materials were recovered from the habitation
site, investigators have suggested that the inhabitants had both inland and coastal interactions (Hall
1995a:49–50). Similar interactions can be suggested
from the inland formal cemetery at the Loma Sandia

Slightly later but before 950 B.P., bone-tempered ceramics and expanding-stem arrow points are known
from the Choke Canyon sites (Black 1989b:52),
and Scallorn points and sandy paste ceramics like
ceramics from the upper Texas coast appeared on
the central coast. Scallorn points and sandy paste
22

ceramics were recovered from the Anaqua site
and other sites located along the lower Lavaca and
Navidad Rivers in Jackson County (Mallouf et al.
1973:136; Story 1968), as well as the Kent-Crane
site in Aransas County (Cox and Smith 1988). Weinstein (1992:64) suggests that these components are
recognizable cultural manifestations that preceded
introduction of Rockport ceramics along the south
and central coasts.

on their seasonal round and what interactions they
may have had with inland-based groups are questions
that require additional research.
Though the Karankawa may have moved inland
seasonally to hunt bison and deer, faunal evidence
from the Hinojosa site in Jim Wells County and the
Choke Canyon sites suggests that resident inland
groups may have focused both on large game and
on a wide range of smaller animals (Steele 1986;
Steele and Hunter 1986). Recognition of a related
lithic tool kit emphasized the importance of large
game such as bison to the subsistence base (Black
1989b:53–54). Consisting of Perdiz arrow points,
small end scrapers, and beveled knives, this tool kit
has been linked to the Toyah phase cultures that appear to have originated on the Southern Plains and
moved south to central Texas, probably in response to
southward-expanding bison herds (Black 1989b:57).
The Toyah phase tool kit has been identiﬁed at the
Hinojosa site and is often found within Rockport
phase sites on the central coast (Black 1986:254–255;
Ricklis 2004:172–175). But the mechanisms behind
adoption of this Toyah technology and its meaning
for the coastal and near-coastal peoples have yet to
be clearly deﬁned (see Johnson [1994] for a wideranging discussion of the Toyah culture).

Rockport ceramics, a sandy paste ware decorated
with asphalt designs and incising, occur most often
with Perdiz and Fresno points. Other arrow point
types occasionally found include Starr, Padre,
Scallorn, Young, Cliffton, and McGloin (Corbin
1974:43). The occurrence of these artifact types
along the coast–generally in Kleberg, Nueces, San
Patricio, Aransas, and Refugio Counties–has been
used to deﬁne the Rockport phase of the Late Prehistoric-Historic period (Campbell 1952, 1958; Story
1968; Suhm et al. 1954). The Rockport phase has
been linked to the historically known Karankawa
Indians because that group continued to produce
the distinctive asphalt-decorated and asphalt-coated
ceramics well into historic times.
Archaeological studies of prehistoric and historic
Karankawa adaptive strategies suggest that these
people took advantage of both the coastal estuarine
and adjoining prairie-riverine resources. Based on
sites in the Corpus Christi Bay and Copano Bay area,
Ricklis (1996:100–124) discerned a seasonal pattern
in the occupation of coastal and nearby inland sites
that may reﬂect this strategy. Two Late Prehistoric
site types have been identiﬁed. One is a shoreline
ﬁshing camp that has extensive deposits of estuarine
resource remains, and the other is an inland hunting
camp with large quantities of terrestrial game such
as deer and bison (Ricklis 1996:33). Seasonal data
based on ﬁsh otoliths and Rangia cuneata samples indicate that the ﬁshing camps were occupied in the fall
through winter or early spring and that hunting camps
were occupied in the spring and summer (Ricklis
1996:70–71, 89–95; 2004). In this model, ﬁshing
camps were occupied at a time of year when a reliable
resource—that is, ﬁsh—was concentrated along the
coast and allowed people to mass. Concomitantly,
hunting camps represent population dispersal geared
toward more-scattered resources—bison and deer.
How far inland the Karankawa may have journeyed

HISTORIC PERIOD
Coastal aboriginal groups were affected not only
by inland aboriginal groups, but they also bore the
brunt of early contact with European explorers and
colonists. The ﬁrst encounter was that of the Spanish
shipwreck survivor and eventual trader Alvar Nuñez
Cabeza de Vaca, who lived and traveled with various
aboriginal groups across coastal Texas ca. 1528 (Hester 1999:17–19). Re-establishing Cabeza de Vaca’s
movements places him on the Texas coast in the
vicinity of San Antonio, Copano, and Corpus Christi
Bays (Campbell and Campbell 1981:2–9). The
Karankawa also met Robert Sieur de La Salle on his
fateful expedition that ended along Matagorda Bay
in the winter of 1685 (Ricklis 1996:1,112). Recent
work at the site of La Salle’s Fort St. Louis (41VT4)
and the excavation of La Salle’s ship, the Belle, in
Matagorda Bay will provide new information on this
contact and the lives of the Frenchmen who participated in that expedition (Davis and Bruseth 2000).
The French presence on the Texas coast was short,
23

PALEOINDIAN PERIOD

but the Spanish, with their emphasis on establishing
missions and presidios, had a lasting effect.

The Paleoindian period (14,500–8800 B.P.) spans the
Pleistocene/Holocene transition, a time of relatively
rapid climatic, ﬂoral, and faunal changes (Turpin
2004:268–269). The Aurora (14,500–11,900 B.P.) and
subsequent Bonﬁre (10,700–9,800 B.P.) subperiods
are represented most notably in Cueva Quebrada
(Lundelius 1984) and Bonﬁre Shelter (Bement 1986;
Dibble and Lorrain 1968) where cultural deposits
are associated with the remains of extinct species
such as camel, elephant, horse, and Bison antiquus.
The earliest subperiods are the hallmark of the
stereotypical Paleoindian adaptation, a subsistence
strategy focused on large game. The late Paleoindian
subperiod Oriente (7,400–6,800) (9,400–8,800 B.P.)
shows the gradual transition to an Archaic lifestyle
as the climate shifted towards a more xeric setting
(Turpin 2004:269). Much of the evidence for the
paleoenvironmental changes derive from studies
conducted in 1970s and 1980s, when a theoretical
shift towards an ecological approach made the Lower
Pecos an appealing research area because of excellent
preservation conditions for ﬂoral and faunal remains.
Notable among the studies, Texas A&M carried out
a paleoenvironmental assessment at Hinds Cave
(Shafer and Bryant 1977), and archaeologists from
UTSA worked at Baker Cave (Brown 1991; Chadderdon 1983; Hester 1983).

Spanish attempts to establish missions and presidios
along the coastal plain continued through the 1700s.
These included Mission Espiritu Santo, established
in 1722 in the present vicinity of Jackson County
and then moved to Victoria County in 1726, Presidio
La Bahia and Mission Rosario established in 1749
and 1754 in Goliad County, and Mission Nuestra
Señora de Refugio, ﬁrst located in Calhoun County
and then moved to Refugio County in 1795 (Ricklis
1996:145). Recent investigations of some of these
sites, including the major ongoing studies of TxDOT
at the Mission Refugio site, have provided information on the mobility patterns, economic activities, and
interactions of both Spanish and Native American
occupants (Calhoun 1999; Ricklis 1999; Walter
1999). These investigations, as well as work on
Late Prehistoric and historic aboriginal sites, appear
to indicate that coastal aboriginal groups kept their
ethnic identities despite attempts by the Spanish to
missionize them, and to some extent they ﬁt the mission system into their aboriginal subsistence pattern
(Ricklis 1996:159–168). Consequently, local coastal
Native American groups, such as the Karankawa,
survived as much-reduced but viable groups into the
nineteenth century. Native groups did not, however,
survive the aggressive Anglo-American settlement of
the Texas coast that took place during the nineteenth
and twentieth centuries.

ARCHAIC PERIOD
The long Archaic Period (ca. 9,000–1,300 B.P.) is
divided into six subperiods (Turpin 2004:269–274).
This relatively precise chronology was deﬁned by
data recovered primarily from dry rockshelters and
caves. Prior to addressing the Archaic chronology,
a brief account of the history of investigations is
provided here, in part to note the extensive amount
of evidence collected from the region. The earliest
excavations, conducted under the auspices of the
Smithsonian Institution, The University of Texas,
and the Witte Museum, began in the 1930s. Among
the more notable early studies were a number of cave
excavations and several works on the area’s rock
art. Pearce and Jackson’s (1933) excavation of Fate
Bell Shelter along Seminole Canyon inaugurated
a rapid succession of rockshelter investigations,
which included study of Shumla, Eagle, Moorhead,
and Murrah caves, among others. Information col-

LOWER PECOS
The northern portion of the Laredo District, namely
Val Verde County, lies in the Lower Pecos archaeological region as it is typically delineated (see for
example Bement 1989; Turpin 1991, 1995, 2004).
One of the hallmarks of the region’s archaeology
is the dry rockshelter and cave sites, which have
preserved art and otherwise perishable materials
generally lost in more mesic settings. Accordingly,
the prehistoric material assemblage is perhaps the
most comprehensive in the state. The following
chronology divides the regional chronology into
Paleoindian, Archaic, Late Prehistoric, and Historic
Periods, subdivided into more speciﬁc subperiods as
discussed by Turpin (1991, 1995, 2004), who draws
from a long tradition of chronology building in the
Lower Pecos and numerous radiocarbon dates.
24

lected during these efforts provided a basis for the
ﬁrst chronologies and trait lists proposed by Sayles
(1935) and Kelley et al. (1940). Forrest Kirkland
(1937, 1938, 1939) and A.T. Jackson (1938) undertook documentation of the regional rock art. Later
rock art studies over recent decades (Shafer 1977,
1986; Turpin 1982, 1984, 1986a, 1986b, 1990; Zintgraff and Turpin 1991) have further tapped into the
interpretive, chronological, and aesthetic potentials
of these symbols.

Cibola subperiod. Broad bladed dart points and a
stylistic change in rock art reﬂect the fundamental
shift. The following Flanders subperiod is perhaps
a return to a desert adaptation reminiscent of the
earlier Archaic times, but the archaeological record
is rather inconclusive. The end of the Archaic, the
Blue Hills subperiod, shows a gradual transition to
the Late Prehistoric. Though a desert adaptation is
still evident, stylistic afﬁnities suggest participation
in a larger interaction sphere extending into Central
Texas and beyond.

Following the early studies, work resumed in the
1950s and continued through the 1960s during the
“reservoir salvage years”. To mitigate the effects of
the proposed Amistad Dam and Reservoir, originally
designated Diablo Reservoir, the Archeological Salvage Program was established under the directorship
of E. B. Jelks at The University of Texas in Austin.
The reservoir study provided auspices for surveys
(e.g., Graham and Davis 1958; Taylor 1958; Taylor
and Rul 1961; Parsons 1962), rockshelter and cave
excavations (Alexander 1970; Dibble 1965, 1967;
Epstein 1960, 1963; Nunley et al. 1965; Parsons
1965; Prewitt 1966), terrace site excavations (e.g.,
Johnson 1964), and rock art recording (e.g., Gephard
1960, 1965; Grieder 1965; Parsons 1962). As the new
studies added to earlier efforts, a revitalized interest
in works of the previous generation led to a number
of syntheses and reassessments, most notably by
Kirkland and Newcomb (1967) and Shuetz (1956,
1961, 1963).

LATE PREHISTORIC PERIOD
The Late Prehistoric Period includes the Flecha
and subsequent Inﬁerno subperiods (ca. 1,300–250
B.P.) (Turpin 2004:274–277). Along with new technologies such as the bow and arrow, most aspects
of culture, including subsistence patterns, site
types, artifact styles, mortuary practices, and artistic
expression, changed during this period. The Red
Monochrome and Bold Line Geometric art styles
appear to have entered the area fully developed
(Turpin 2004:274–277). In the ﬁnal stages of this
period, ominous effects of far-away changes begin to
trickle into the cultural setting. Disease and societies
marginalized by the advancing frontier rupture a long
continuity in the cultural trajectory.

HISTORIC PERIOD
The Historic Period began with the ﬁrst Spanish
entradas in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries.
Gaspar Castano de Sosa reportedly crossed the Rio
Grande near present-day Del Rio in 1590 en route
to the Pecos Pueblo. Another important entrada occurred in 1675 headed by Fernando del Bosque and
Father Juan Larios who crossed the Rio Grande possibly at the Paso de Francia ford (Chipman 1992:68).
This entrada (Bosque-Larios expedition) consisted
of 10 soldiers and two missionaries including Father
Larios, explored the region and along the Pecos River
(Chipman 1992:68). The Ethnohistoric accounts
from this entrada were extremely detailed regarding the interactions of bands and Macrobands of the
region (personal communication, Al McGraw 2008).
In 1720 Joseph Berroterán with a band of 70 soldiers
marched along the left bank of the Rio Grande from
present-day Langtry to Dryden (Chipman 1992:134;
Tyler 1996:32). In 1736, Garza Falcon led an expedition into the area, intending to confront hostile groups

The Archaic is usually deﬁned by a generalized subsistence pattern marked by the intensiﬁcation in the
exploitation of locally available resources and the rise
of territoriality, or regionality. Burned rock middens,
various ground stone features and artifacts, and the
proliferation of spatially speciﬁc artifact styles are
indicators of these trends. The Viejo subperiod, the
earliest in this period, coincided with a widespread
drying trend. Fiber artifacts, coprolite analysis, and
other lines of evidence indicate an advanced adaptation to the arid conditions. The subsequent Eagle
Nest and San Felipe subperiods show increasing
intensiﬁcation in resource exploitation, insularity,
and possibly internal social stresses. In the latter of
these two subperiods, rock art ﬂourished on a grand
scale, marked by the polychromatic Pecos River
style. With the return of bison to the area, an abrupt
change in the cultural trajectory is noted during the

Verde, was established in 1738.

Panther Springs Creek site in Bexar County (Black
and McGraw 1985), the Jonas Terrace site in Medina County (Johnson 1995), the Camp Pearl Wheat
site in Kerr County (Collins et al. 1990), 41BX1 in
Bexar County (Lukowski 1988), 41BX300 in Bexar
County (Katz 1987), and several sites at Canyon
Reservoir (Johnson et al. 1962). For more-complete
bibliographies concerning archaeological work done
in the region, see Black (1989c), Collins (1995), and
Johnson and Goode (1994).

In 1848 Jack Hays led a distinguished party that
included Sam Maverick and Sam Highsmith through
the Lower Pecos in an effort to establish a route
from San Antonio to El Paso, a signiﬁcant leg of
the Chihuahua Trail. The dissected terrain tangled
their careers and nearly cost them their lives. Out of
frustration, Hays reportedly labeled one waterway
the Devil’s River, a name that stuck (Tyler 1996:54).
Maverick’s diary, though terse, provides a poignant
portrait of the rugged area through the eyes of the
early explorers. As discovered by the Spanish centuries before, with a few exceptions (such as Horsehead
Crossing near the western margin of the region), the
Lower Pecos is more of an end in itself rather than a
feasible route for a regional thoroughfare.

PALEOINDIAN PERIOD
Surﬁcial and deeply buried sites, rockshelter sites,
and isolated artifacts represent Paleoindian (11,500–
8,800 B.P.) occupations of the Central Texas region
(Collins 2004:116). The period is often described as
having been characterized by small but highly mobile
bands of foragers who were specialized hunters of
Pleistocene megafauna. But Paleoindians probably
used a much wider array of resources (Meltzer and
Bever 1995:59), including small fauna and plant
foods. Faunal remains from Kincaid Rockshelter
and the Wilson-Leonard site (41WM235) support
this view (Bousman 1998; Collins 1998; Collins
et al. 1989). Longstanding ideas about Paleoindian
technologies also are being challenged.

SOUTHEASTERN MARGIN OF CENTRAL
TEXAS
The archaeological record of the Central Texas region overlaps the northern part of the San Antonio
District. This region is known from decades of investigations of stratiﬁed open sites and rockshelters
throughout the Edwards Plateau (see Collins [2004]
for review). The area has highly dissected eastern
and southern margins, and the adjoining margins of
physiographic regions to the east and south. Traditionally, the Central Texas archaeological area has
included the Balcones Canyonlands and Blackland
Prairie—that is, the northern part of the San Antonio District (e.g., Prewitt 1981; Suhm 1960). These
two areas are on the periphery of the Central Texas
archaeological area, and their archaeological records
and projectile point style sequences contain elements
that suggest inﬂuences from and varying degrees of
contact over time with other areas such as the Lower
Pecos and Gulf Coastal Plain (Collins 2004; Johnson
and Goode 1994). Archaeological sites in these two
areas of the San Antonio District that have contributed important information include the Richard
Beene site at Applewhite Reservoir (McGraw and
Hindes 1987; Thoms et al. 1996; Thoms and Mandel
1992; Thoms and Mandel 2005), the Cibolo Crossing site at Camp Bullis (Kibler and Scott 2000), the

Collins (2004) divides the Paleoindian period into
early and late subperiods. Two projectile point styles,
Clovis and Folsom, are included in the early subperiod. Clovis chipped stone artifact assemblages, including the diagnostic ﬂuted lanceolate Clovis point,
were produced by bifacial, ﬂake, and prismatic-blade
techniques on high-quality and oftentimes exotic
lithic materials (Collins 1990). Along with chipped
stone artifacts, Clovis assemblages include engraved
stones, bone and ivory points, stone bolas, and ochre
(Collins 2004:116; Collins et al. 1992). Clovis points
are found evenly distributed along the eastern edge of
the Edwards Plateau, where the presence of springs
and outcrops of chert-bearing limestone are common (Meltzer and Bever 1995:58). Sites within the
area yielding Clovis points and Clovis-age materials
include Kincaid Rockshelter (Collins et al. 1989),
Pavo Real (Henderson and Goode 1991), and San
Marcos Springs (Takac 1991). A probable Clovis
polyhedral blade core and blade fragment was found
at the Greenbelt site in San Antonio (Houk et al.
1997). Analyses of Clovis artifacts and site types
suggest that Clovis peoples were generalized hunter26

An increasing amount of evidence suggests that
Archaic-like adaptations were in place before the
Archaic (see Collins 2004:118, 1998; Collins et al.
1989) and that these practices continued into the succeeding Late Prehistoric period (Collins 1995:385;
Prewitt 1981:74). In a real sense, the Archaic period
of Central Texas is not a developmental stage, but
an arbitrary chronological construct and projectile
point style sequence. Establishment of this sequence
is based on several decades of archaeological investigations at stratiﬁed Archaic sites along the eastern
and southern margins of the Edwards Plateau. Collins (1995, 2004) and Johnson and Goode (1994)
have divided this sequence into three parts—early,
middle, and late—based on perceived (though not
fully agreed upon by all scholars) technological,
environmental, and adaptive changes.

gatherers with the technology adapted to hunt larger
game but not solely rely on it. In contrast, Folsom
tool kits—consisting of ﬂuted Folsom points, thin
unﬂuted (Midland) points, large thin bifaces, and
end scrapers—are more indicative of specialized
hunting, particularly of bison (Collins 2004:117).
Folsom points have been recovered from Kincaid
Rockshelter (Collins et al. 1989) and Pavo Real
(Henderson and Goode 1991).
Postdating Clovis and Folsom points in the archaeological record are a series of dart point styles (primarily unﬂuted lanceolate darts) for which the temporal,
technological, or cultural signiﬁcance is unclear.
Often, the Plainview type name is assigned these dart
points, but Collins (2004:117) has noted that many
of these points typed as Plainview do not parallel
Plainview type-site points in thinness and ﬂaking
technology. Investigations at the Wilson-Leonard
site (see Bousman 1998) and a statistical analysis of
a large sample of unﬂuted lanceolate points by Kerr
and Dial (1998) have shed some light on this issue.
At Wilson-Leonard, the Paleoindian projectile point
sequence includes an expanding-stem dart point
termed Wilson, which dates to ca. 10,000–9,500
B.P. Postdating the Wilson component is a series
of unﬂuted lanceolate points referred to as Golondrina-Barber, St. Mary’s Hall, and Angostura, but
their chronological sequence is poorly understood.
Nonetheless, it has become clear that the artifact
and feature assemblages of the later Paleoindian
subperiod appear to be Archaic-like in nature and in
many ways may represent a transition between the
early Paleoindian and succeeding Archaic periods
(Collins 2004:118).

Early Archaic (8,800–6,000 B.P.) sites are small, and
their tool assemblages are diverse (Weir 1976:115–
122), suggesting that populations were highly mobile
and densities low (Prewitt 1985:217). It has been
noted that Early Archaic sites are concentrated along
the eastern and southern margins of the Edwards
Plateau (Johnson and Goode 1994; McKinney 1981).
This distribution may indicate climatic conditions at
the time, given that these environments have more
reliable water sources and a more diverse resource
base than other parts of the region. Early Archaic
projectile point styles include Hoxie, Gower, Wells,
Martindale, and Uvalde. Clear Fork and Guadalupe
bifaces and a variety of other bifacial and unifacial
tools are common to Early Archaic assemblages.
Construction and use of rock hearths and ovens,
which had been limited during late Paleoindian
times, became commonplace. The use of rock features suggests that retaining heat and releasing it
slowly over an extended period were important in
food processing and cooking and reﬂects a specialized subsistence strategy. Such a practice probably
was related to cooking plant foods, particularly
roots and bulbs, many of which must be subjected
to prolonged periods of cooking to render them
consumable and digestible (Black et al. 1997:257;
Wandsnider 1997; Wilson 1930). Botanical remains,
as well as other organic materials, are often poorly
preserved in Early Archaic sites, so the range of plant
foods exploited and their level of importance in the
overall subsistence strategy are poorly understood.
But recovery of charred wild hyacinth (Camassia

ARCHAIC PERIOD
The Archaic period for Central Texas dates from ca.
8,800 to 1,300–1,200 B.P. (Collins 2004:119–121)
and generally is believed to represent a shift toward
hunting and gathering of a wider array of animal
and plant resources and a decrease in group mobility
(Willey and Phillips 1958:107–108). In the eastern
and southwestern United States and on the Great
Plains, development of horticultural-based, semisedentary to sedentary societies succeeds the Archaic
period. In these areas, the Archaic truly represents
a developmental stage of adaptation as Willey and
Phillips (1958) deﬁne it. For Central Texas, this
notion of the Archaic is somewhat problematic.

types of plant foods used and their importance in the

in Bexar County (Thoms and Mandel 1992), the

plants) or resource patches meant the debris of multiple rock ovens and hearths accumulated as middens
on stable to slowly aggrading surfaces, as Kelley and
Campbell (1942) suggested many years ago. Johnson
and Goode (1994:26) believe that the dry conditions
promoted the spread of yuccas and sotols, and that
it was these plants that Middle Archaic peoples collected and cooked in large rock ovens.

During the Middle Archaic period (6,000–4,000
B.P.), the number and distribution of sites, as well as
their size, probably increased as population densities grew (Prewitt 1981:73; Weir 1976:124, 135).
Macrobands may have formed at least seasonally,
or more small groups may have used the same sites
for longer periods (Weir 1976:130–131). Development of burned rock middens toward the end of the
Middle Archaic suggest a greater reliance on plant
foods, although tool kits still imply a considerable
dependence on hunting (Prewitt 1985:222–226).
Middle Archaic projectile point styles include Bell,
Andice, Taylor, Baird, Nolan, and Travis. Bell and
Andice points reﬂect a shift in lithic technology from
the preceding Early Archaic Martindale and Uvalde
point styles (Collins 2004:119). Johnson and Goode
(1994:25) suggest that the Bell and Andice darts are
parts of a specialized bison-hunting tool kit. They
also believe that an inﬂux of bison and bison-hunting
groups from the Eastern Woodland margins during a
slightly more mesic period marked the beginning of
the Middle Archaic. Though no bison remains were
recovered or present, Bell and Andice points and associated radiocarbon ages were recovered from the
Cibolo Crossing (Kibler and Scott 2000), Panther
Springs Creek, and Granberg II (Black and McGraw
1985) sites in Bexar County. Bison disappeared as
more-xeric conditions returned during the late part of
the Middle Archaic. Later Middle Archaic projectile
point styles represent another shift in lithic technology (Collins 2004:120; Johnson and Goode 1994:27).
Prewitt (personal communication, 2000) postulates
that the production and morphology of Travis and
Nolan points are similar to projectile points from the
Lower Pecos region. Because they appeared earlier
in the Lower Pecos than in Central Texas, such characteristics as beveled stems and overall morphology
may have originated in the Lower Pecos. At the same
time, a shift to more-xeric conditions saw the burned
rock middens develop, probably because intensiﬁed

During the succeeding Late Archaic period (4,000 to
1,300–1,200 B.P.), populations continued to increase
(Prewitt 1985:217). Within stratiﬁed Archaic sites
such as Loeve-Fox, Cibolo Crossing, and Panther
Springs Creek, the Late Archaic components contain the densest concentrations of cultural materials.
Establishment of large cemeteries along drainages
suggests certain groups had strong territorial ties
(Story 1985:40). A variety of projectile point styles
appeared throughout the Late Archaic period.
Johnson and Goode (1994:29–35) divide the Late
Archaic into two parts, Late Archaic I and II, based
on increased population densities and perceived
evidence of Eastern Woodland ceremonial rituals
and religious ideological inﬂuences. Middle Archaic
subsistence technology, including the use of rock and
earth ovens, continued into the Late Archaic period.
Collins (2004:121) states that, at the beginning of the
Late Archaic period, the use of rock ovens and the
resultant formation of burned rock middens reached
its zenith and that the use of rock and earth ovens
declined during the latter half of the Late Archaic.
There is, however, mounting chronological data that
midden formation culminated much later and that
this high level of rock and earth oven use continued
into the early Late Prehistoric period (Black et al.
1997:270–284; Kleinbach et al. 1995:795). A picture
of prevalent burned rock midden development in the
eastern part of the Central Texas region after 2,000
B.P. is gradually becoming clear. This scenario parallels the widely recognized occurrence of post-2,000
B.P. middens in the western reaches of the Edwards
Plateau (see Goode 1991).
The use of rock and earth ovens (and the formation
of burned rock middens) for processing and cooking
plant foods suggests that this technology was part
of a generalized foraging strategy. The amount of
energy involved in collecting plants, constructing
hot rock cooking appliances, and gathering fuel ranks
28

most plant foods relatively low based on the resulting caloric return (Dering 1999). This suggests that
plant foods were part of a broad-based diet (Kibler
and Scott 2000:134) or part of a generalized foraging
strategy, an idea Prewitt (1981) put forth earlier. At
times during the Late Archaic, this generalized foraging strategy appears to have been marked by shifts
to a specialized economy focused on bison hunting
(Kibler and Scott 2000:125–137). Castroville, Montell, and Marcos dart points are elements of tool kits
often associated with bison hunting (Collins 1968).
Archaeological evidence of this association is seen
at Bonﬁre Shelter in Val Verde County (Dibble and
Lorrain 1968), Jonas Terrace (Johnson 1995), Oblate
Rockshelter (Johnson et al. 1962:116), John Ischy
(Sorrow 1969), and Panther Springs Creek (Black
and McGraw 1985).

phase horizon markers, Scallorn-Edwards and Perdiz
arrow points, respectively, are distributed across
most of the state. Violence and conﬂict often marked
introduction of Scallorn and Edwards arrow points
into Central Texas—many excavated burials contain
these point tips in contexts indicating they were the
cause of death (Prewitt 1981:83). Subsistence strategies and technologies (other than arrow points) did
not change much from the preceding Late Archaic
period. Prewitt’s (1981) use of the term “Neoarchaic”
recognizes this continuity. In fact, Johnson and
Goode (1994:39–40) and Collins (2004:122) state
that the break between the Austin and Toyah phases
could easily and appropriately represent the break
between the Late Archaic and the Late Prehistoric.
Around 1,000–750 B . P ., slightly more-xeric or
drought-prone climatic conditions returned to the
region, and bison came back in large numbers
(Huebner 1991; Toomey et al. 1993). Using this vast
resource, Toyah peoples were equipped with Perdiz
point-tipped arrows, end scrapers, four-beveled-edge
knives, and plain bone-tempered ceramics. Toyah
technology and subsistence strategies represent a
completely different tradition from the preceding
Austin phase. Collins (1995:388) states that formation of burned rock middens ceased as bison hunting
and group mobility obtained a level of importance
not witnessed since Folsom times. Although the
importance of bison hunting and high group mobility hardly can be disputed, the argument that burned
rock midden development ceased during the Toyah
phase is tenuous. A recent examination of Toyah-age
radiocarbon assays and assemblages by Black et al.
(1997) suggests that their association with burned
rock middens represents more than a “thin veneer”
capping Archaic-age features. Black et al. (1997)
claim that burned rock midden formation, although
not as prevalent as in earlier periods, was part of the
adaptive strategies of Toyah peoples.

The Archaic period represents a hunting and gathering way of life that was successful and that remained
virtually unchanged for more than 7,500 years. This
notion is based in part on fairly consistent artifact
and tool assemblages through time and place and
on resource patches that were used continually for
several millennia, as the formation of burned rock
middens shows. This pattern of generalized foraging,
though marked by brief shifts to a heavy reliance on
bison, continued almost unchanged into the succeeding Late Prehistoric period.

LATE PREHISTORIC PERIOD
Introduction of the bow and arrow and, later, ceramics into Central Texas marked the Late Prehistoric
period. Population densities dropped considerably
from their Late Archaic peak (Prewitt 1985:217).
Subsistence strategies did not differ greatly from the
preceding period, although bison again became an
important economic resource during the late part of
the Late Prehistoric period (Prewitt 1981:74). Use
of rock and earth ovens for plant food processing
and the subsequent development of burned rock
middens continued throughout the Late Prehistoric
period (Black et al. 1997; Kleinbach et al. 1995:795).
Horticulture came into play very late in the region
but was of minor importance to overall subsistence
strategies (Collins 2004:122).

HISTORIC PERIOD
Hester (1989) and Newcomb (1961) provide historical accounts of Native Americans and their interactions with the Spanish, the Republic of Mexico, the
Texas Republic, and the United States throughout
the region. The beginning of the late seventeenth
and early eighteenth centuries was an era of morepermanent contact between Europeans and Native
Americans as the Spanish moved northward out of

Mexico to establish settlements and missions on their
northern frontier (see Castañeda [1936–1956] and
Bolton [1970] for extended discussions of the mission system and Indian relations in Texas and the San
Antonio area). There is little available information
on aboriginal groups and their ways of life except for
the fragmentary data Spanish missionaries gathered.
In the San Antonio area and areas to the south, these
groups have been referred to collectively as Coahuiltecans because of an assumed similarity in way
of life, but many individual groups may have existed
(Campbell 1988). Particular Coahuiltecan groups,
such as the Payaya and Juanca, have been identiﬁed
as occupying the San Antonio area (Campbell 1988).
This area also served as a point of contact between
the southward-advancing Apaches and the Spanish,
with native groups often caught in between. Disease
and hostile encounters with Europeans and intruding
groups such as the Apache were already wreaking
their inevitable and disastrous havoc on native social
structures and economic systems by this time.

and the U.S. defeat of the Apaches and Comanches
and their removal to reservations.

METHODS
BACKGROUND REVIEW
Prior to ﬁeld investigations, SWCA conducted an
initial background review of the project area(s) to
determine if any previously recorded sites were located near (within 1 mile of) the project area(s) or if
any surveys had been conducted nearby. Maps and
site ﬁles at TARL and on the THC’s online Historic
Sites Atlas were reviewed, as were the appropriate
geologic and soil survey maps.

FIELD METHODS
The ﬁeld methods depended on the type of project
(linear or bridge replacement, for example) and the
level of investigation (impact evaluation or survey).
For linear impact evaluations, the investigations included a pedestrian walkover of the project area to
deﬁne and investigate the Area of Potential Effects
(APE) of the proposed work. Unless conditions
made it infeasible, all ﬁeldwork was of sufﬁcient
intensity to determine the nature, extent, and, if possible, signiﬁcance of any cultural resources located
within the proposed project area. The survey met
all THC minimum archaeological survey standards
for projects such as these, with some exceptions,
which were thoroughly documented. If right-ofentry was not arranged for proposed impact areas
outside of the existing ROW, those areas were
inspected visually from across fence lines. Because
the goal of an impact evaluation was not to locate
archaeological sites but to determine the likelihood
of archaeological deposits with good integrity to be
present, the investigations focused on documenting
impacts to the project area and assessing the general
geomorphological setting. The ﬁeld crews mapped
the locations of impacts and photographed the condition of the project area(s) to document existing
disturbances.

Establishment of the mission system in the ﬁrst
half of the eighteenth century to its ultimate demise
around 1800 brought the peaceful movement of
some indigenous groups into mission life, but others
were forced in or moved in to escape the increasing
hostilities of southward-moving Apaches and Comanches. Many of the Payaya and Juanca lived at
Mission San Antonio de Valero (the Alamo), but so
many died there that their numbers declined rapidly
(Campbell 1988:106, 121–123). By the end of the
mission period, European expansion and disease
and intrusions by other Native American peoples
had decimated many Native American groups. The
small numbers of surviving Payaya and Juanca were
acculturated into mission life. The last references to
the Juanca and Payaya were recorded in 1754 and
1789, respectively, in the waning days of the mission
(Campbell 1988:98, 123). By that time, intrusive
groups such as the Tonkawa, Apache, and Comanche
had moved into the region to ﬁll the void. Outside of
the missions, few sites attributable to these groups
have been investigated. To complicate matters, many
aboriginal ways of life endured even after contact
with the Spanish. For example, manufacture of stone
tools continued even for many groups settling in the
missions (Fox 1979). The nineteenth century brought
the ﬁnal decimation of the Native American groups

For impact evaluations of bridge replacement projects, the crews employed a body of methods that
SWCA developed for use in TxDOT’s Dallas District
during the assessment of 148 bridge project areas
(Houk and Skoglund 2002). Typically, a standardized
ﬁeld form was utilized by each ﬁeld crew to record
30

the respective project area. Speciﬁcally, information related to the setting of the bridge, including
vegetation, land use, and topography; particular
types of impacts that were commonly encountered;
the assessment of the potential for archaeological
sites with good integrity to be located in the project
area; and the need for additional archaeological
investigations. Houk and Skoglund (2002:19–26)
describe the methods used at bridge replacement
project areas in detail.

RESULTS
SUMMARY OF WORK AUTHORIZATIONS
The work authorizations and individual projects are
summarized in Tables 3 and 4. The work authorizations are also discussed by district in this section. As
previously noted, a total of 16 work authorizations
was granted under this contract. Fifteen of the work
authorizations comprised 72 individual ﬁeld projects, which included 62 archaeological surveys and
10 impact evaluations. None of the archaeological
surveys included a geoarchaeological component.
The ﬁnal (WA 16) work authorization consists of
the preparation for the ﬁnal report. Therefore, the 16
work authorizations compose an overall total of 73
projects. This section brieﬂy discusses the activities
conducted in the districts. Speciﬁcally, the number of
work authorizations, impact evaluations, and surveys
are indicated for each of the four TxDOT districts
within the South Texas Contract area. Subsequent to
this section, common impacts observed within the
project areas of the four districts are provided. The
common impacts of the project areas are followed
by a discussion of the investigated archaeological
sites.

For survey projects, the ﬁeld investigations included
a pedestrian walkover of the project area and some
combination of mechanical trenching and/or shovel
testing to look for buried cultural resources. Because
the excavation equipment was supplied by TxDOT,
the machinery used depended on what the closest
TxDOT area or district ofﬁce could provide. Backhoes and Badgers, a Gradall-like excavator, were
the two most commonly supplied machine types. In
some cases, trenches were excavated at a speciﬁed
interval, but in other cases were placed according
to the location of known sites, accessibility, and the
nature of the project area’s topographic setting and
level of disturbance.
Trenches were generally 5 m long and 1.5 m deep;
the width varied by machine, with backhoe trenches
being 0.75 m wide and Badger trenches being 1.5
m wide. An archaeologist monitored the excavation of each trench and cleaned the proﬁle walls to
look for buried cultural materials. Each trench was
documented on a standardized form with detailed
stratigraphic descriptions of each trench.

CORPUS CHRISTI DISTRICT

Shovel tests were generally 30 cm in diameter and
excavated in arbitrary 20-cm levels. The depth of
each shovel test depended on the depth of bedrock,
the depth of pre-Holocene soils, or, in come cases, the
depth of the water table. The matrix from each shovel
test was screened through ¼-inch hardware mesh,
and the excavator described the soils encountered,
cultural materials recovered, and depth of excavation
for each shovel test on a standardized form.

TxDOT issued ﬁve work authorizations for the Corpus Christi District, consisting exclusively of seven
archaeological surveys. Three of the seven surveys in
the Corpus Christi District were associated with the
same project area (US 59 in Live Oak County). Due
to sporadic landowner access, the evaluation of new
ROW along US 59 was conducted over three separate ﬁeld trips (WAs 1-1, 4-1, and 6-1). Two of the
remaining four surveys occurred in Nueces County
along FM 2292 and SH 361; the other two surveys
were in Bee and San Patricio Counties consisted of a
linear survey of FM 799 and SH 188, respectively.

The ﬁeld crews utilized hand-held GPS receivers to
record the locations of shovel tests, trenches, and
archaeological sites. They also photographed each
project area to document sites and/or existing conditions. For each archaeological site discovered or reevaluated, the crew completed a State of Texas Site

Archaeological sites were investigated during four of
the seven surveys in this district. Only one of these
four surveys (WA 1-1) resulted in the discovery of an
archaeological site (41LK322). The remaining surveys evaluated previously recorded sites including
the aforementioned ﬁeldwork conducted along US 59

No further archaeological work
is recommended for this project
area. However, for the bridge or
any other structure, building, or
object to be a contributing element
to Sisterdale Valley NHRP district,
must have been constructed
or used during the period of
signiﬁcance (i.e., 1825–1847).
Bridge appears to date after this
and is possibly not a contributing
element to the NRHP district.
However, additional research
may be necessary to make this

PHARR DISTRICT

(WAs 1-1, 4-1, and 6-1). Due to varying landowner
access, this ﬁeldwork examined the same project
area (US 59) over three ﬁeld trips. The remaining
survey was conducted along SH 188 (WA 1-7) that
evaluated previously recorded site 41SP96. Three of
the seven surveys in this district did not evaluate or
encounter any archaeological sites.

TxDOT issued ﬁve work authorizations for the Pharr
District that comprised four impact evaluations and
nine archaeological surveys. Most (n=3) of the impact evaluations in the Pharr District were of long,
linear road improvement projects (i.e., widening
existing roadway). The remaining impact evaluation
(WA 6-4) was for the enhancement (e.g., widening)
of a road intersection. Overall, the impact evaluations were evenly distributed between urban and
rural settings with two located in suburban settings.
No archaeological sites were encountered during the
impact evaluations.

LAREDO DISTRICT
TxDOT issued 10 work authorizations for the Laredo
District, the most for any of the four districts. The
work authorizations comprised ﬁve impact evaluations and 28 archaeological surveys. The impact
evaluations exclusively consisted of bridge replacement projects. All of the impact evaluation projects
were in rural areas, and resulted in recommendations of no further archaeological investigations.
No archaeological sites were encountered during the
impact evaluations.

Six of the nine surveys conducted in the Pharr District were linear surveys for the widening of existing roadways. The remaining surveys (n=3) were
composed of a bridge replacement, while two (WAs
10-4 and 10-5) consisted of examining new ROW
for a proposed new roadway. Six of the surveys
were located in rural areas while two were situated
in urban areas and one in a suburban setting. No
new archaeological sites were encountered during
these surveys, but three previously recorded sites
(41CF15, 41CF16, and 41CF187) were evaluated
during two surveys (WAs 1-3 and 1-4). No further
archaeological investigations were recommended
within the existing TxDOT ROW for these sites.

The archaeological surveys included 18 bridge replacement projects, a survey for a retention pond at
a Border Safety Inspection Facility (BSIF), seven
surveys for the enhancement of various roadways
(e.g., add passing lanes or shoulders), and three linear
surveys for new roadway. Most of the surveys were
also in rural settings, although two were in an urban
and one was located in a suburban setting.
Overall, 17 archaeological sites were investigated
in the Laredo District. Of note, several of these 17
archaeological sites (i.e., 41WB1 and 41WB208)
were reportedly within or adjacent to the project
ROW (WA 5-1), but were not observed during
ﬁeldwork. Of the surveys, seven resulted in the
discovery of 10 newly recorded archaeological
sites (41LS105, 41ZV454–456, 41WB647–649,
and 41VV1988–1990) and four surveys examined
ﬁve previously recorded sites (41ZV117, 41WB2,
41WB6, 41WB205, and 41MV242). SWCA recommended avoidance or testing for one archaeological
site (41LS105) and additional archival research for
one site (41ZV454). Of note, archival research was
recommended for 41ZV454 during the initial survey
(WA 1-8) of the area. A subsequent survey of the
project area (WA 10-2) determined that the site did
not extend into the project corridor and no further
work was recommended within TxDOT ROW. No
further archaeological investigations were recommended within the existing ROW for the 13 remaining archaeological sites.

SAN ANTONIO DISTRICT
TxDOT issued four work authorizations for the San
Antonio District that included one impact evaluation
and 17 archaeological surveys. One survey began
as an impact evaluation along SH 16 (WA 9-1), but
was upgraded to a linear survey. The sole impact
evaluation (WA 9-2) was for a bridge replacement.
No archaeological sites were encountered during the
impact evaluation.
The 17 surveys included 13 bridge replacement
projects, two linear road enhancement (i.e., widening) projects, and one linear survey (WA 6-5) for
new roadway. The overwhelming majority of these
surveys (n=11) were in a rural setting while three
were suburban and two were in urban settings. Three
of the surveys (WAs 12-1, 12-3, and 12-6) each encountered an archaeological site: 41FR59, 41FR60,
and 41BX1719, respectively. Also, three previously
recorded sites (41BN73, 41BN195, and 41BN196)

most common buried utilities are phone and/or ﬁber
optic lines. Other buried utilities include electrical,
gas, water, and sewer lines (Figure 7). Obviously,
buried utilities have more impact on subsurface
cultural materials than overhead utilities. The extent
of the impact also varies somewhat with the type of
buried utility, as installing gas, water, and sewer lines
causes larger areas to be disturbed than the installation of phone and ﬁber optic lines.

were re-evaluated during two surveys (WAs 5-3 and
9-1). No further archaeological investigations were
recommended within the existing TxDOT ROW for
these sites.

COMMON IMPACTS TO TXDOT PROJECT
AREAS
In order of predominance, the impacts most commonly encountered include disturbance from roadway construction (i.e., cut and ﬁll sections), buried
and overhead utilities, roadway maintenance (blading and vegetation clearing), and erosion.

Prior to each survey, SWCA would coordinate a
utility locate along the project area to prevent cutting buried utilities during backhoe trenching. These
utility locates often revealed buried utilities for
which no surface indication was visible, and they
usually indicated that the utilities were farther from
the edge of the ROW than previously believed. The
utility locates failed to identify abandoned utilities,
which pose no threat to trenching but do represent a
subsurface impact.

Fill sections occur on linear projects and bridge replacement projects. The approaches for most bridges
are elevated by ﬁll sections, which were usually
wider and thicker at the ends of bridges and tapered
in both height and horizontal extent away from the
drainage. Fill sections vary greatly in thickness and
width; some rural roads have no ﬁll section, while
multi-lane divided highways may have massive ﬁll
sections over 20 feet thick that extend nearly the
width of the ROW (Figure 5).

Other common impacts include blading and vegetation clearing for road maintenance. These impacts
are almost exclusively associated with rural gravel
roadways, but can occur along the shoulders of
paved roadways. One example is the bridge survey
that occurred along the rural Wright Road in the
Laredo District (WA 15-5). The roadway consisted
of a gravel road that was frequently bladed for road
maintenance. At the time of examination, Wright

Although the negative effect of ﬁll sections is prevalent, the speciﬁc level of these disturbances varies.
Fields et al. (2000:49) estimated that at least the
upper 0.5 m of sediment beneath and adjacent to ﬁll
sections is disturbed initially by construction activities and then by compaction. It is likely, however,
that the construction impacts for even
small ﬁll sections extend much farther
than the visible edge of the ﬁll.
Another more evident but less common
impact is cuts below grade for road construction. These impacts entail removing a portion of the existing topographic
grade (Figure 6). These disturbances
primarily occur along linear projects
and vary in depth depending on the
area topography.
Buried and overhead utilities are a very
common type of disturbance, occurring along rural, suburban, and urban
roads. Although utility lines occasionally cross a roadway perpendicularly,
the lines predominantly run parallel to
roads near the edges of the ROW. The

DISCUSSION OF
ARCHAEOLOGICAL SITES
INVESTIGATED
SWCA investigated 30 archaeological
sites while completing the 15 work
authorizations that required ﬁeld investigations. The sites are summarized
in Tables 5 and 6. As previously mentioned, the Laredo District contained

adjacent to roads or ﬁll sections and

cases, ditches have associated concrete
culverts or drainage pipes, particularly
under cross roads or driveways. Gullies, on the other hand, vary in size and
depth (from 1–10 feet deep) as well as
where in a project area they occur.
Various other disturbances were recorded during the project. In most
cases, these impacts were observed to
disturb areas outside of the apparent
ROW, but in some cases they extend
into the ROW as well. The following
impacts were present in one or more
project areas: intersecting roads, access
roads, roadside entrances to private
residences and businesses, commercial

an area that exhibited minimal previous impacts. In
the seven cases where surveys were downgraded to
impact evaluations, these areas exhibited prevalent
disturbances, an absence of alluvial deposits, or
a combination of the two scenarios. The ratio of
impact evaluations that were recommended for additional survey investigations during this project is
low. However, by comparison this project is lower
than some previous projects conducted for TxDOT
(e.g., Houk and Carpenter 2004) and about the same
as others (e.g., Houk and Skoglund 2002). In each

recommended for additional investigation were encountered along the same project area (RM 189 in Val
Verde County, Laredo District). Notably, this project
was unique in that most of the RM 189 alignment
crossed deep Holocene alluvial deposits (Houk and
Carpenter 2004:67). Therefore, the sites documented
along the RM 189 project are removed from the
sample set as the percentages are more proportional
to the current project. In regards to the archaeological
sites of South Texas Contract, most of the sites were
within or immediately adjacent to existing TxDOT
ROWs. These sites generally exhibited disturbed
contexts, lacked stratigraphic integrity, had a low
density of preserved cultural material, or a combination of these factors. Therefore, the context of most
of these archaeological sites had some bearing on
whether the site warranted further investigation.

As an archaeological investigative tool, impact
evaluations are a cost-effective way of making a “reasonable and good faith effort” to identify loci with
sufﬁcient integrity to contain archaeological sites
that are eligible for NRHP nomination or that may
warrant SAL status. The impact evaluations serve as
a relatively efﬁcient and inexpensive method of identifying areas that have little archaeological potential
based on previous impacts or natural setting.

CONCLUSIONS
The likelihood of a survey encountering archaeological deposits with good integrity is directly related to
the level of previous disturbance to the TxDOT ROW
and the general archaeological potential of the area in
which the project is located. Sites may be present in
disturbed project areas, such as 41WB205, but they
are unlikely to require testing because they have poor
integrity. In project areas such as Huajuco Road in
LaSalle County where the degree of disturbance is
much less severe, if sites are present, they are likely
to have good integrity and require additional investigations. It follows that areas with new ROW have
the greatest potential for containing archaeological
deposits with good integrity, provided that they are
located in geomorphologically suitable settings (alluvial), such as stream terraces or ﬂoodplains.

SURVEYS
SWCA conducted 62 surveys, none of which included geoarchaeology. Of those, one followed an
impact evaluation previously conducted by SWCA
under the South Texas Contract. The majority of
surveys failed to discover archaeological sites, even
in cases where sites were previously recorded in the
vicinity of the project area. Overall, archaeological
sites were investigated during roughly 36 percent of
the 62 surveys. The lowest percentage (22 percent)
occurred in the Pharr District while the Corpus
Christi District (57 percent) had the highest percentage of investigation. The San Antonio and Laredo
Districts were closer to the overall average with 30
and 39 percent, respectively.

RECOMMENDATIONS FOR IMPROVING THE
PROCESS
In general, the methods employed to conduct impact
evaluations and surveys appear to be in accord with
the concept of “reasonable and good faith effort”
to comply with state and federal laws related to the
identiﬁcation of archaeological sites that are eligible
for the NRHP or warrant designation as an SAL.
The process could be improved, however, with only
minor changes.

In cases of the 30 sites documented within the ROW
of various projects, testing was recommended at one
archaeological site (see Table 5). This accounts for
approximately 3 percent of the investigated sites.
Comparatively, other previous projects conducted
for TxDOT have recommended additional testing
at 33 percent of the encountered sites (Houk and
Carpenter 2004:66). However, ﬁve of the eight sites

SWCA recommends that whenever possible an impact evaluation should be conducted after construc52

Comments/Recommendations

Prehistoric open campsite.

Upland prehistoric open campsite.

Previously recorded at the intersection of Las Tiendas Road and the Camino Colombia Toll Road, which is
roughly 1,056 feet south of the current APE. Hicks & Company recommended additional investigations to
determine NRHP and SAL eligibility. In 1997, SWCA revisited the site and utilized backhoe trenches and a
pedestrian survey to determine NRHP eligibility and was recommended not eligible for inclusion to the NRHP or
SAL. No further work was recommended.

Previously recorded on the south side of a major unnamed tributary of Tejones Creek about 1,475 feet
southeast of the current APE. Hicks & Company recommended additional investigations to determine NRHP
and SAL eligibility. In 1997, SWCA revisited the site and utilized backhoe trenches and a pedestrian survey to
determine NRHP eligibility and was recommended not eligible for inclusion to the NRHP or SAL. No further
work was recommended.

Previously recorded about 1 mile southeast of the project area situated on the western terrace of Santa Isabel
Creek. Hicks & Company recommended further testing of the site. In 1997, SWCA conducted testing and data
recovery of the site.

Absence of cultural materials within US 59 ROW on either side of Caliche Creek seems to indicate that site
41WB208 does not extend northward into the ROW. Due to disturbed nature of ROW, shallow nature of the
soils, and the absence of evidence of cultural materials no additional investigations are recommended for the
ROW of US 59 at Caliche Creek.

Prehistoric surﬁcial scatter or open
camp.

Prehistoric open campsite.

Location unresolved-THC and TARL have the site plotted in two different locations. TARL and Atlas show the
site on the eastern bank of El Gato Creek, approximately 100 feet (30 m) north of US 59. THC shows the site
approximately 1 km south of US 59. Hicks & Company (1998) concluded THC map is probably more accurate,
which would place 41WB4 well outside of the US 59 project area.

Absence of cultural materials within the ROW of US 59 west of Salado Creek seems to indicate that site 41WB1
does not extend into the ROW. Due to the disturbed nature of the ROW, the shallow nature of the soils, and the
lack of cultural materials within the ROW, no additional investigations are recommended for the ROW of US 59
at Salado Creek.

Previouly recorded on the northwest portion of Laughlin Air Force Base, approximately one mile east of the
project area near U.S. 90.

Previously recorded by SWCA . The site is not considered eligible for listing on the National Register of Historic
Places or designation as a Texas State Archeological Landmark.

No evidence of the previously recorded site 41MV242 was observed within the ROW. The project area is
severely disturbed by US 277 construction activities and is in an upland setting with little potential for buried
cultural resources. No additional archaeological investigations are recommended for the project area in the
existing ROW. However, if the alignment is shifted to require new ROW, it may be necessary to conduct further
archival research and survey to determine if any signiﬁcant cultural resources are located outside of the existing
ROW.

Based on plotting nearest part of is its western edge approx. 700 feet south of project area; no cultural materials
associated with site observed in ROW.

Previously recorded on Mustang Island approximately 1 mile southeast of the current project area. This site is
dated to 1942–45 and will not be impacted by the current project.

SWCA’s 2006 survey found no evidence of site 41LK269 in the Perkins property portion of new ROW as
indicated/plotted in the ﬂoodplain as the southern portion of the site on the Atlas. The previously recorded
portion within the existing ROW was found to be ineligible for NRHP nomination and did not warrant SAL
designation by Goode (1986). No further archaeological work is recommended for the Perkins property portion
of new ROW.

tion plans have been developed. In general impact
evaluations are part of the early stages of construction planning, and details about the speciﬁc impacts
of construction are not available. On one hand, earlystage impact evaluations can serve to alert planners
to areas with high potential to affect resources. If
survey is recommended and sites are found, time
exists to allow planners to formulate alternatives for
avoidance. On the other hand, ﬁeld crews without
any knowledge of construction plans are unable to
appropriately focus their investigations of the project
area. Their recommendations are assigned to loosely
deﬁned quadrants rather than speciﬁc areas. Any
information about the probable construction impacts
associated with a project, such as whether it requires
an easement, would allow crews to improve their
investigations and recommendations.

Finally, TxDOT may wish to perform some sort of
quality control test of itself and its subcontractors
to determine if impact evaluations and surveys are
being conducted consistently. While this may not
be ﬁscally possible, it would be informative to have
several private ﬁrms conduct an impact evaluation
or survey on areas previously evaluated by TxDOT
and then subsequently contrasting the results. Ideally,
this would allow TxDOT to identify inconsistencies
or deﬁciencies and perhaps result in the development
of standardized guidelines and approaches.

SWCA recommends that whenever possible, utilities
be located prior to an impact evaluation. While this
may be impossible on contracts such as this one, it
may be useful on individual impact evaluation work
orders under other contracts. Based on experience,
the placement and number of buried utilities can
be incorrectly assessed during a surface inspection
because of unclear or missing signage. Therefore,
the degree of previous disturbance may be underestimated.
SWCA recommends that it may be possible to eliminate the need for a ﬁeld inspection of urban project
areas based on recent aerial photographs. In addition
to a review of the soils, geology, and archaeological
sites database, the use of an aerial photograph, such
as a Digital Orthophoto Quarter Quad or Google
Earth that could assess the degree of impact to urban
project areas (such as WA 12-5 in the San Antonio
District) and possibly eliminate the need for an onsite inspection. Houk and Skoglund (2002) made
a similar recommendation after evaluating bridge
replacement projects in TxDOT’s Dallas District and
in a previous South Texas TxDOT surveys report
(Houk and Carpenter 2004).
Regarding archaeological surveys, SWCA recommends that surveys be conducted in all project areas
with previously recorded archaeological sites. It is
probable that an impact evaluation of such an area
would result in a recommendation for survey anyway
(see WA 9-1). In some cases, it may be possible to an61
