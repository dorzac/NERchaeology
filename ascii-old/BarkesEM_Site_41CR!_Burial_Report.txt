A CRANE COUNTY BURIAL: 41 CR .1
On December Ji, 1971 Mr. Rnd Mrs. Jack Prich0rd of
Odessa, Texas were arrowhead hunting and discovered a bone
partially exposed by erosion on the north edge of a

le~se

road in Block J1, Section 42, University Lands Survey of
Crane County, Texas.

This is in the sandhills area about

nine miles northwest of Crane, Texas.
Mr. Prichard exposed enough to determine that the
bones were humen.

He than covered the bones and reported

his find to Mr. A. W.

11

Woody 11 J(eith of the University of

Texas of the Permian Basin staff.

Mr. Keith and General

Henry Hise, also of the UTPB staff, accompBnicd Jvir. Priehard to the site on Tuesday, January 4, 1972.

They exposed

the skeleton and determined. the orientation of it.

It was

decided to contact Dr. E. Mott Davis of the Department of
Anthropology of the University of Texas, Austin, Texas.

Dr. Davis suggested that members of the Midland Aroheological Society be contacted to assist in the excavation.
On Thursday, JanuBry 6, 1972, Mr. and Hrs. Francis
Stickney end Mrs. James Barkes of the Midland Society accompanied General Hise and Mr. Keith to the

~ite.

Mr. and

Mrs. Prichard. and their four children were also there.
