ABSTRACT

Under contract with the Lubbock District of the Texas Department of Transportation, GeoMarine, Inc., performed a cultural resources assessment of 9.594 miles (347.506 acres) of new
and existing right-of-way for the proposed SH 349 Southern Cross highway project in Dawson
County, Texas, between FM 829 and the proposed US 87 Reliever Route in the town of Lamesa
(GMI project # 32004.00.04). In 2007, Hicks & Company surveyed the 7.57-mile segment of SH
349 between FM 829 and CR 22 as part of a larger investigation for the Odessa District and
recorded two archeological sites, 41DS13 and 41DS14, within the project corridor. Both sites
occurred in plowed agricultural fields, and neither was considered eligible for inclusion in the
National Register of Historic Places. Because this portion had already been intensively surveyed,
a windshield reconnaissance of most of the area was conducted; however, the two sites were
reidentified and examined more closely. Site 41DS14, a prehistoric lithic scatter, has all but
disappeared. Only one chert flake was observed in the existing right-of-way of SH 349. Site
41DS13, a scatter of twentieth-century household debris, is relatively unchanged from the
original site description. The primary difference is that three prehistoric chert flakes were
identified on the ground surface during the present survey.
An intensive pedestrian survey was conducted along the remaining 3.69 miles (116.3 acres) of the
project corridor. Over 90 percent of the previously unsurveyed area consisted of plowed
agricultural fields and existing right-of-way that afforded excellent ground surface visibility.
Because of the high surface visibility and disturbance from agricultural activity, road
construction, and installation of underground utility lines, these areas were traversed and visually
inspected for archeological materials. None were observed. Although site 41DS8, a prehistoric
lithic scatter, was previously recorded in the vicinity of the project corridor, south of the Lamesa
landfill, no material evidence of it was observed during the survey. Newly identified site 41DS15
was recorded in an overgrown area overlooking the west flood plain of Sulphur Springs Draw. A
complex of several structures, including a house constructed in 1950, is present, and shovel tests
produced a small number of historic artifacts, mostly concentrated near the house. Recentness of
the site, mixed context from subsequent dumping, and limited artifact quantity and quality
preclude the site from eligibility for inclusion in the National Register of Historic Places or for
listing as a State Archeological Landmark. Nine backhoe trenches excavated within the Sulphur
Springs Draw flood plain did not demonstrate any evidence of buried artifacts, archeological
features, or cultural horizons. No significant cultural resources will be impacted by the proposed
iii

highway project, and it is recommended that it be allowed to proceed without additional
investigation.
No artifacts were collected during the survey; however, all notes, forms, and photographs
obtained during this project are curated at the Texas Archeological Research Laboratory in
Austin.

CHAPTER 1
INTRODUCTION

As part of the SH 349 Southern Cross highway project, the Lubbock District of the Texas
Department of Transportation (TxDOT) is proposing improvements to the existing SH 349 in
Dawson County (CSJ 0905-32-006). Improvements consist of widening a 9.504-mile (mi)
segment of the existing two-lane roadway between FM 349 northeast to its present terminus at
SH 137 in Lamesa to accommodate additional traffic lanes, as well as construction of a new 1.67mi divided, four-lane arterial highway between SH 137 and the proposed US 87 Reliever Route to
the east (Figure 1). The proposed new alignment will cross Sulphur Springs Draw immediately
south of the Lamesa Country Club. Traffic interchanges at SH 137 and US 87 are also included
in the design. The total project will require approximately 347.506 acres (ac) of right-of-way
(ROW). Roughly 207.107 ac will consist of new ROW. Vertical impacts are not expected to
exceed 3.5 feet (ft) except at Sulphur Springs Draw, where they might be deeper. TxDOT
contracted with Geo-Marine, Inc. (GMI), of Plano, Texas, to conduct an archeological survey
(GMI project #32004.00.04) of the new and existing project ROW as required under Section 106
of the National Historic Preservation Act (36 CFR 800) and the Antiquities Code of Texas (13
TAC 26). Due to revision of project limits and overlap of TxDOT districts, a portion of the
project corridor has already been investigated. In 2007, Hicks & Company surveyed a 42.5-mi
segment of SH 349 for the Odessa District that included the portion of SH 349 between FM 829
and CR 22 (Jones et al. 2007) that falls within the present project limits. As a result, only 3.69 mi
(116.3 ac) of the current project corridor required intensive pedestrian survey (Figure 2).
The project corridor consists of a combination of public property (including both state-owned
ROW and city-owned property) and privately owned land. Topography consists of relatively flat
to gently rolling plains. Sulphur Springs Draw and a series of playas are the primary water
sources in the region.
The project area setting is rural, and over 90 percent of it consists of cultivated fields, primarily
cotton. A few private residences, both currently occupied and vacant, occur within or near the
proposed corridor. A golf course and a landfill also occur immediately north of the project area
between SH 137 and Sulphur Springs Draw near the northeast terminus. Extensive agriculture
has stripped most of the project area of its natural vegetation, and the only locations with
nonagricultural ground cover are on a terrace west of Sulphur Springs Draw and east of Radio
Road/CR L and along the residential properties. Hardwood trees, junipers, and ornamental shrubs
1

are planted near a house at the intersection of SH 349 and SH 137, and lawn grass partially
covers approximately 70 percent of the ground surface. The other residential properties also
exhibit patches of lawn grass, although these are sparse due to erosive conditions and foot traffic.
A thin cover of grass also occurs along areas of existing ROW along SH 349 between SH 137 and
FM 2052. Grasses, ragweed, prickly pear, and scrub trees cover the property on the terrace
between Radio Road/CR L and Sulphur Springs Draw.
GMI conducted the cultural resources survey of the proposed SH 349 Southern Cross project
between March 11 and 13, 2008. Project Archeologist Angela Tiné and Archeological
Technician Bethany Oliver of GMI performed the field survey. Melissa Green of GMI served as
Principal Investigator for the project.
The following chapters provide brief reviews of the environmental and cultural backgrounds
(Chapters 2 and 3) and a description of the methodology used during this project (Chapter 4),
followed by the results of the investigations and the recommendations based on those results
(Chapters 5 and 6). A list of references cited in the text concludes the body of the report.

CHAPTER 2
ENVIRONMENTAL BACKGROUND

Dawson County is on the eastern edge of the Llano Estacado of the High Plains. The Llano
Estacado is characterized by smooth to slightly irregular plains with a high percentage of
cropland, although oil and gas production also occurs. It is an elevated plain surrounded on three
sides by escarpments. Geologically, it originated as the Ogallala Formation, an apron of
Miocene-Pliocene sediments eroded from the eastern Rocky Mountains, and was later covered by
Pleistocene wind-borne sand and silt. Isolated from the major streams that once flowed through
the plain, seasonal rainfall is captured in a series of playas scattered throughout the region. Prior
to being used predominantly for crop agriculture, shortgrass prairie composed of buffalograss,
blue (Bouteloua gracilis) and sideoats (Bouteloua curtipendula) grama, and little bluestem
(Schizachyrium scoparium) covered the Llano Estacado. Native wildlife consisted of bison
(Bison bison), black-tailed prairie dog (Cynomys ludovicianus), black-footed ferret (Mustela
nigripes), snake (suborder Serpentes), ferruginous hawk (Buteo regalis), coyote (Canis latrans),
swift fox (Vulpes velox), deer (family Cervidae), pronghorn (Antilocapra americana), mountain
lion (Puma concolor), and gray wolf (Canis lupus) (Griffith et al. 2004).
Dawson County has a dry steppe climate, characterized by mild winters and hot summers.
During the winter, frequent cold fronts move in from the north, accompanied by strong, gusty
winds. Average low temperature in January is 28° Fahrenheit (F) and the average high
temperature in July is 94°F. As noted above, the region is arid, receiving on average only 40.6
centimeters (cm; 16 inches [in]) of rainfall per year (Gelin and Odintz 2008).
Soils within the project area are classified under the Amarillo association and consist mostly of
Amarillo sand and Arvana fine sandy loams that occur on broad, nearly level to gently sloping
plains. Specific soil map units within the project area consist of Amarillo fine sandy loam, 1 to 3
percent slopes (69 percent); Amarillo fine sandy loam, 0 to 1 percent slopes (27 percent);
Mansker fine sandy loam, 3 to 5 percent slopes (2.6 percent); Mansker fine sandy loam, 1 to 3
percent slopes (<1 percent); Arvana fine sandy loam, shallow, 0 to 3 percent slopes (>1 percent);
and Spur fine sandy loam (>1 percent). Amarillo soils are deep, well-developed moderately
sandy reddish soils on high plains developed from soft, calcareous, moderately sandy parent
material. The Mansker series consists of dark brown to yellowish brown, strongly calcareous,
droughty soils that arose from strongly calcareous, medium- to fine-textured sediments. They
occur along Sulphur Springs Draw and the eastern portion of Dawson County. Arvana soils are
5

well-developed, reddish, sandy soils underlain by hard, platy caliche and developed on a thin
mantle of sandy material deposited by wind on the caliche. They occur along ridge tops and in
areas where Amarillo soils change elevation. The Spur series is made up of very dark grayish
brown, friable, calcareous soils along flood plains and ancient drainages. Spur soils were formed
by alluvial sediments deposited at the base of sloping soils flanking these drainages (Sanders
1960).

CHAPTER 3
CULTURAL BACKGROUND

PREVIOUS RESEARCH
Examination of the Archeological Sites Atlas maintained by the Texas Historical Commission
(THC) indicates that three cultural resources management (CRM) projects have been conducted
within 1 kilometer (km; 0.6 mi) of the current project corridor, and, indeed both appear to have
occurred at least partially within the present project boundaries. The earliest CRM project was
conducted in 1998 by PRIAM and consisted of an archeological survey for a proposed extension
of the Lamesa city landfill (Katz 1998). One archeological site, 41DS8, was identified, and it
appears to be located within the present project corridor, south of the existing landfill and
between SH 137 and Radio Road/CR L, west of Sulphur Springs Draw. Site 41DS8 was
recorded as a prehistoric surficial lithic scatter of burned caliche and chipped stone flakes. No
subsurface materials were identified, and the site was determined to be ineligible for inclusion in
the National Register of Historic Places (NRHP) or for listing as a State Archeological Landmark
(SAL) because of poor contextual integrity from repeated plowing and its lack of potential to
provide additional information about the regional culture history.
More recently, Hicks & Company surveyed an approximately 42.5-mi segment of existing and
proposed ROW along SH 349 in Martin and Dawson counties from 2 mi north of the MidlandMartin county line northeast to the intersection of SH 349 and CR 22 in Dawson County for
TxDOT’s Odessa District (Jones et al. 2007). The Dawson County portion of the survey
coincides with the southern 7.51 mi of the current project. Five archeological sites were
discovered during the survey, and two, 41DS13 and 41DS14, were located within the present
project boundary. Site 41DS13 was described as a moderately dense scatter of ca. 1940s
household debris in a plowed field east of SH 349 on a hilltop north of CR 24. Site 41DS14 was
recorded as a low-density prehistoric lithic scatter consisting of burned caliche, debitage, and
chipped stone tools on the surface of a cultivated field east of SH 349 and bisected by CR 26.
Artifacts from both sites were limited to the ground surface and plowzone, with few subsurface
materials recovered. Both sites were determined to be ineligible for NRHP or SAL listing
because of poor contextual integrity and absence of potential to yield new data (Jones et al. 2007).

7

Though not within the current project corridor, a 2007 Blanton & Associates, Inc., survey was
conducted east of the present project area for the proposed US 87 Reliever Route, with which the
extended SH 349 will eventually connect. As a result of the investigations, site 41DS12 was
identified less than 1 km southeast of the current project area. The site was similar to others in
the region in that it consisted of a surface scatter of burned caliche and prehistoric chipped stone
materials—one biface and several pieces of debitage—observed in a plowed field. No subsurface
materials were identified, and surface context was nonexistent due to repeated deep plowing of
the area. The site extended outside the boundary of that project; however, the portion of the site
within the project area was assessed as ineligible for NRHP or SAL listing because of poor
contextual integrity and low research potential (Sanchez and Dusek 2007).

PREHISTORIC BACKGROUND
Two recent reviews on the archeology of the Llano Estacado are by Hofman et al. (1989) and
Johnson and Holliday (1995). The following discussion is largely based on that presented by
Johnson and Holliday. A summary of the chronological periods recognized for the Llano
Estacado is presented in Table 1. Readers interested in a more detailed discussion should consult
either of the above works.

Post-A.D. 1800

After Hofman et al. (1989) and Johnson and Holliday (1995)

The Paleo-Indian period (ca. 9500 to 6500 B.C.) is the earliest generally recognized human
occupation in North America. The period is typified by the use of lanceolate projectile points and
a population generally characterized as consisting of small groups of highly mobile, big-game
hunters. The Llano Estacado contains several important Paleo-Indian sites such as Blackwater
Draw and Lubbock Lake, and the Scharbauer (Midland Man) site is in proximity to the project area.
The earliest human occupation of the central United States is represented by the Clovis culture
and is usually associated with the remains of extinct Pleistocene mammals. Climatic conditions
during the Clovis period consisted of “an equitable, humid, maritime paleoclimate . . . with a
lower mean annual temperature than today; there were also cooler summers and warmer winters
that lacked extended freezing conditions (Johnson and Holliday 1995:522). During the
succeeding Folsom period, the emphasis shifted from exploitation of Pleistocene megafauna to
bison, partly as the result of an environmental shift that included “[a]n accelerated warming trend,
greater seasonality, increased annual temperature fluctuation, and wide-spread extinctions”
8

(Johnson and Holliday 1995:523). Although both Clovis and Folsom are very widespread
cultural phenomena, regionalization of cultural groups began to appear following the Folsom
period. On the Llano Estacado, this consisted of the Plainview and Firstview cultures. The major
distinction of the Plainview period is the presence of the unfluted Plainview points; climatic
conditions, however, became warmer and drier throughout the period. During the Firstview
period, the earlier moist conditions ended and drier conditions became established (Hofman
1989a; Johnson and Holliday 1995).
The Archaic period was one of more regional cultural circumscription than in the past and a
greater dependence upon vegetal resources, as indicated by the introduction of gouges, manos,
and metates. The period is also marked by increased diversification and specialization of tool
kits. The Early Archaic period on the Llano Estacado is not well known. Environmental
conditions continued to deteriorate to the beginning of the Altithermal period (4000–2500 B.C.), a
very hot, dry, and dusty period with extensive aeolian sedimentation. The Middle Archaic period
coincides with the Altithermal. Prehistoric wells have been identified for this period at
Blackwater Draw Locality #1 (Evans 1951; Green 1962), Mustang Springs (Meltzer 1991;
Meltzer and Collins 1987), and Mark’s Beach (Honea 1980). The return of cooler and moister
conditions than found during the Altithermal occurred during the Late Archaic period. Stable
vegetation appears to have returned to the area, as aeolian sedimentation ceased and wind erosion
was reduced (Boyd et al. 1989:39–44; Johnson and Holliday 1995).
The Ceramic period is marked by the introduction of two new technologies: pottery and the bowand-arrow. Johnson and Holliday (1995) informally divide the Ceramic period into earlier (50
B.C. to A.D. 950) and later (A.D. 950 to A.D. 1450) periods. The gradual transition from the earlier
Archaic lifeways to those found in the later Ceramic period is indicated by the coexistence of dart
and arrow points at several sites with good stratigraphic context; pottery, arrow points, and dart
points were also found together at Deadman’s Shelter (Hughes and Willey 1978). Diagnostic
artifacts of the period include Scallorn points and coarse-tempered, cord-marked pottery.
Puebloan trade pottery (especially Jornado Mogollon types) and Plains-style lithic tool types
characterize the later Ceramic period (Johnson and Holliday 1995:528–530).
Johnson and Holliday (1995:530) anachronistically date their Protohistoric period to ca. A.D.
1450–1650, apparently in order to have this period coincide with the radiometrically derived date
range for Garza points. This usage, however, contradicts their earlier statement that the
“Protohistoric period covers the time when Europeans were in the region, but their influence was
not manifested in the aboriginal material culture nor in the archeological record” (Johnson and
Holliday 1995:521). The Native American portion of the succeeding Historic period is
characterized as being “marked by the appearance of European trade goods and modern horse
remains” (Johnson and Holliday 1995:530). Meanwhile, Hofman’s (1989b) dating of the
Protohistoric period from the beginning of the Coronado expedition in 1541 to ca. 1800 is more
consistent with the usage of the term “Protohistoric” as used elsewhere in Texas. Hofman’s
usage of Protohistoric is followed here.
At the beginning of the Protohistoric period, the inhabitants of the region were probably the
Jumano, a Tanoan-speaking nation of traders. The Jumano had extensive trading networks across
Texas, with historically documented contacts with the Rio Grande pueblos, the Caddo of
northeastern Texas, and the Wichita (Hickerson 1994:xxvi, 24). The Jumano may already have
been in conflict with the Apache at the time of the Coronado expedition (Hickerson 1994:24);
certainly, they were at war with the Apache later (Hickerson 1994; John 1975). The conflict
9

between the Jumano and Apache continued until the early eighteenth century, when the Jumano
were destroyed as an independent group. The Apache, however, were unable to retain possession
of the region for a long period, because they were already under pressure from the Comanche to
the north. By the end of the eighteenth century, the Comanche dominated the southern Llano
Estacado and controlled the region until the 1870s.

HISTORIC BACKGROUND
The earliest Europeans known to have traversed western Texas were Alvar Núñez Cabeza de
Vaca and his companions Alsono del Castillo, Andrés Dorantes, and Esteban. These individuals
were shipwrecked along the Texas gulf coast in 1528 and spent the next eight years traveling
among the Native American groups in present-day east, south, and west Texas in an effort to
reach the Spanish settlements in New Spain. They finally encountered a Spanish slave-raiding
expedition in northwestern Mexico (Weber 1992:42–45). Given the particulars of Cabeza de
Vaca’s journeys, it is unlikely that he had a significant effect upon Native American culture.
Francisco Vázquez de Coronado led the next expedition to the region. Between 1540 and 1542,
the Coronado expedition explored present-day New Mexico, Arizona, the Texas Panhandle,
Oklahoma, and Kansas in search of the fabled seven cities of Cíbolo. Cíbolo turned out to be
distorted reports of the southwestern pueblos, and a disappointed Coronado returned to New
Spain (Weber 1992:45–49). Several other expeditions crossed the Trans-Pecos region subsequent
to Coronado (Weber 1992:Map 2). The permanent European presence in western Texas and New
Mexico began in 1598, when Juan de Oñate began his expedition of conquest in the Rio Grande
valley. The conquerors originally lived among the subjugated populations, with the European
settlement of Santa Fe being founded in 1610 (Weber 1992:77–82, Map 2). Although European
influences, especially the introduction of the horse, greatly affected Native American groups on
the southern Llano Estacado, European populations did not begin to replace aboriginal
populations until the 1870s.
Buffalo hunters, more so than American soldiers, are suspected of driving native populations out
of the region in the mid-1870s. Attracted by the Plains grasses, cattle ranchers settled the area
shortly thereafter, and by the mid-1880s four ranches occupied most of the land encompassed in
Dawson County. Dawson County was formed August 21, 1876, but remained attached to
Howard County to the southeast for judicial purposes until February 13, 1905. Lamesa was
selected as the county seat on March 20, 1905, beating out the town of Chicago 2 miles away by
five votes. The two towns were eventually consolidated, and the businesses and residences of
Chicago were relocated to Lamesa. The county obtained its first railroad in 1911 when the Santa
Fe line was built into Lamesa. During the early 1900s, the population of Dawson County
increased as grazing leases for the large cattle ranches expired and the lands were turned over for
settlement. Crop agriculture replaced cattle ranching during that time, and cotton became the
major crop by the mid-1910s. Cotton remained as the economic mainstay until the Great
Depression when both poor farming conditions and low prices affected the industry. However,
other businesses arose that helped offset the losses in the cotton market. The dairy industry
became successful and oil production was introduced in 1934. By 1940, sorghum had
temporarily outpaced cotton as an agricultural staple, but after the introduction of irrigation to the
county in the latter portion of the decade, cotton resumed its dominant role in the agricultural
economy. Oil and agriculture continue to be the primary forces behind the county’s economy,
although the agricultural industry has become more diversified with the inclusion of sorghum and
wheat crops, as well as the raising of cattle and hogs (Gelin and Odintz 2008).

METHODOLOGY

ARCHIVAL RESEARCH
Prior to fieldwork, a search of the available archival data was undertaken. The purpose of this
background research was to identify all previous cultural resources investigations in the vicinity
of the project area and to determine the locations of all known archeological sites, standing
structures, National Register properties, and National Historic Landmarks and SALs that might be
situated within or near the project area. The results of the research were used to guide the field
methods, to determine the areas in which previously recorded sites would be encountered, and to
locate landforms with the highest probability to retain archeological deposits. The data also
served as a contextual framework so that any newly recorded sites could be evaluated for
significance.
Site records obtained from the THC’s Archeological Sites Atlas were consulted to obtain
information on previous investigations and known sites within or near the current project area, as
were any available reports on CRM investigations in the region. The results of this search have
already been summarized in Chapter 3.
ARCHEOLOGICAL FIELD METHODS
GMI archeologists conducted an intensive pedestrian survey of the project corridor between CR
22 and US 87 (see Figure 2). Survey included visual examination of the ground surface along the
project route, systematic shovel testing in areas with less than 30 percent surface visibility, and
excavation of backhoe trenches within the Sulphur Springs Draw flood plain. Two archeologists
walked transects spaced 15 meters (m) apart along the length of the corridor northeast of CR 22.
The number of transects depended on the width of the ROW for a particular area. Over 90
percent of the proposed ROW consisted of plowed agricultural fields that afforded excellent
ground visibility (usually greater than 75 percent), and grass cover along existing ROW was
typically sparse with visibility over 30 percent, and usually over 50 percent. Right-of-entry
(ROE) was not available for one property; however, ground exposure in this location was good
and the property could be inspected from the existing ROW and proposed ROW where access
had been granted. Existing ROW typically indicated disturbance from grading and buried utility
lines; therefore, although those areas were briefly examined, surface inspection focused on the
proposed ROW.
11

One area along the project corridor underwent systematic shovel testing. A segment of proposed
ROW 300 ft (90.9 m) wide on a terrace between Radio Road/CR L and Sulphur Springs Draw
was overgrown with grasses, and ground visibility was less than 10 percent. Because of the poor
surface visibility and the landform’s proximity to the draw, the area was systematically shoveltested. Archeologists traversed four transects, starting along the northern boundary of the ROW,
spaced 30 m apart and excavated shovel tests along these transects at 30-m intervals until the
slope of the landform precluded the likelihood for archeological materials to be present. Shovel
tests were approximately 30 cm (11.8 in) in diameter and were excavated to 80 cm (31.5 in)
below ground surface (bs), or until the B horizon was encountered. All shovel test fill was sifted
through 0.25-in hardware cloth to identify any subsurface cultural materials that might be present,
and data regarding soil color, texture, and content for each shovel test were recorded on a
standardized form.
Because of a potential for deeply buried cultural deposits in the alluvial sediments of Sulphur
Springs Draw, nine backhoe trenches were excavated within a 300-ft-wide corridor of the flood
plain. Although a 150-ft ROW was specified for this location, TxDOT representatives suggested
investigating a 300-ft-wide area because the proposed ROW flanking both sides of the draw was
that width. A row of five backhoe trenches was excavated approximately 15 m (50 ft) west of the
draw, and two additional trenches were placed 10 m west of this row. Two trenches were also
dug along the east side approximately 27 m (89 ft) east of the draw where the flood plain was
narrower and circumscribed by a wire fence. All trenches were excavated perpendicular to the
draw and were spaced 10–15 m (33–50 ft) apart in a row. Trenches were typically 5 m (16.5 ft)
long and 1.5 m (5 ft) wide. They were excavated until the water table and/or the caliche was
encountered. The walls and floors of the trenches were examined for cultural features or
horizons, and backdirt was inspected for artifacts. Notes were taken regarding soil stratigraphy
and contents.
Hicks & Associates had already surveyed the segment of SH 349 between CR 22 and FM 829 in
2007. Therefore, a windshield survey was conducted along this portion. Two archeological sites,
41DS13 and 41DS14, were recorded in this area in 2007, and the sites were reidentified and
revisited to determine if they still existed and to document any change from previous
descriptions.
The Project Archeologist maintained daily field notes that detailed the investigations and field
observations. Backhoe trench and select shovel test locations (i.e., those that could not be
extrapolated by measuring from existing landmarks) were recorded using a Garmin
eTrexLegendTM global positioning system (GPS) unit. Digital photographs were taken to record
the general landscape of the project area as well as disturbances, artifacts (with scale), and trench
wall profiles.
Artifacts were not collected for three reasons: (1) previous researchers in the area had set the
precedent of a “no collection” policy; (2) written consent by the owners to collect artifacts from
private property was not provided to the investigators; and (3) none of the artifacts observed were
unique or diagnostic to the extent that photographs and written descriptions could not suffice for
artifact identification and temporal assignment. Although no artifacts require curation, all notes,
forms, and photographs obtained during this project will be curated at the Texas Archeological
Research Laboratory in Austin.

CHAPTER 5
RESULTS

The following chapter discusses the results of the archeological survey. For the purposes of
discussion, the survey area is arbitrarily divided by location, ROW width, and survey strategy.
Each is addressed individually starting from the eastern end and working southwest (see Figure
2).

US 87 RELIEVER ROUTE TO US 87
A small portion of the proposed SH 349 extension continues east of US 87 and turns north, where
it will connect with the proposed US 87 Reliever Route. No ROE was granted for the property
directly east of US 87, but it appears to be disturbed by an asphalt parking lot and several
buildings (Figure 3). TxDOT representative Davis Melton (personal communication 11 March
2008) indicated that the small parcel north of this property that meets with the proposed US 87
Reliever Route was already examined when the survey for the Reliever Route was conducted.

US 87 TO SULPHUR SPRINGS DRAW
Proposed ROW width for this segment is 300 ft. The area is partially disturbed by residential
buildings and their infrastructure, a barn, and a corral area that includes concrete walkways
(Figures 4 and 5). Two plowed fields are also present and ground visibility exceeds 80 percent.
In particular, many portions of the corral area are eroded to the red clay subsoil (Figure 6). The
area was traversed in six east-to-west transects. No cultural materials were identified.

SULPHUR SPRINGS DRAW
As discussed in the previous chapter, the actual proposed ROW in the area is 150 ft; however, the
ROW flanking the draw is twice as wide, and impacts to this extent are possible. Therefore, a
300-ft-wide corridor was investigated. At the location where the proposed corridor crosses the
draw, the draw is an ephemeral stream and is presently dry (Figure 7). Nevertheless, nine
backhoe trenches were excavated in the flood plain (Figure 8) to examine the characteristics of

the alluvial sediments and determine if the draw had previously been more extensive than at
present. No archeological features or cultural horizons were observed in any of the trenches, and
the only cultural materials observed were pull-tab beer cans and other modern trash recovered
from the upper 10–20 cm (4–8 in) of the ground surface.
Two basic soil profiles appeared in the backhoe trench walls (Figures 9 and 10). Backhoe
trenches (BHTs) 1–5 were excavated closest to the draw and demonstrated the deepest solums
and the greatest stratigraphy. Depth of these trenches ranged from 360–433 cm (142–170.5 in;
3.6–4.3 m [11.8–14.2 ft]) bs, and aside from slight variation on stratum thickness, soil color and
composition was relatively uniform from trench to trench. Table 2 provides a representative soil
profile based on observations in BHT 1.
The relatively thick strata and fine-particle soils indicate a generally nondynamic alluvial
environment. General absence of soil mottling and gleying suggests that prolonged inundation of
the flood plain has been an infrequent occurrence. Initially, the very dark layer usually
encountered at 70 cm (27 in) bs aroused suspicion about the presence of a paleosol. However, the
soil appeared to be extremely dark and was composed of clay loam, whereas other strata tended
to be sandy loam. Therefore, it was determined that it was a separate soil layer rather than
organic staining from possible human activity. The stratum is also consistent with A horizon
strata among the Spur soils series, the soil type mapped along Sulphur Springs Draw in the Soil
Survey of Dawson County, Texas (Sanders 1960:19).

BHTs 6–9 were more distant from the draw and demonstrated soil profiles different from the first
five trenches. These profiles consist of shallower solums, fewer but thicker strata, and redder
soils with more calcareous inclusions. Table 3 provides a representative soil profile taken from
BHT 6. Trench depths ranged from 170–340 cm (67–134 in; 1.7–3.4 m [5.6–11.2 ft]) deep.
These portions of the flood plain underwent less frequent and dramatic inundation and have very
low potential for deeply buried cultural deposits.

SULPHUR SPRINGS DRAW TO RADIO ROAD/CR L
The 300-ft proposed ROW in this area was systematically shovel-tested due to its elevated nature,
proximity to Sulphur Springs Draw, and poor ground visibility. Four west-to-east transects were
shovel-tested along the length of the corridor (Figures 11 and 12). Transect 1 was placed 5 m
(16.5 ft) south of the northern ROW boundary. Although transect widths were intended to be
spaced 30 m (99 ft) apart, a complex of structures consisting of an abandoned house, garage,
mobile home, and series of outbuildings (site 41DS15; Figure 13), all enclosed along the north
side by a fence of wood framing sided with corrugated sheet metal, occupied the ROW 30 m
(99 ft) south of Transect 1. Therefore, Transect 2 was placed 20 m (66 ft) south of Transect 1,

along the north side of the series of buildings. The remaining two transects were placed 30 m
(99 ft) south of each previous one. Shovel tests were spaced at 30-m (99-ft) intervals and
extended along the landform until it sloped steeply, at which point the probability of in situ
archeological materials was low. Results of the subsurface investigations are summarized in
Table 4.
Of the 16 shovel tests excavated, seven were positive and produced a small amount of historic
domestic and architectural artifacts. Artifact deposits were typically limited to the upper 20 cm
(8 in) of the shovel tests, although Shovel Test (ST) 2 of Transect 2 also produced materials 20–
40 cm (8–31.5 in) bs. Observed artifacts were primarily fragments of clear and brown bottle
glass, although two pieces of lamp glass were identified, as well as two fragments of iron wire, a
few wire nails, and metal fragments, including a crimped rim, most likely from cans or tins. A
small modern safety pin, a piece of butchered animal rib, and two turquoise-colored fragments
from the center of a ceramic plate or platter were also identified (Figure 14). All artifacts were
consistent with twentieth-century manufacture dates. The color of the ceramic fragments was
similar to, though not necessarily unique to, Fiestaware, a relatively inexpensive line of ceramic
dinnerware introduced in 1936 by the Homer Laughlin China Company that was characterized by
art-deco styling and bright, bold colors (Cunningham 1982; The Homer Laughlin China
Company 2008a). The line was discontinued in 1973 but was reissued in 1988 (The Homer
Laughlin China Company 2008a). More specifically, turquoise was produced from 1937–1969
and resumed in 1988 (The Homer Laughlin China Company 2008b). Other ceramic companies
also followed the trend of producing bright and pastel-colored ceramic dishes during this time as
well (Cunningham 1982), and in the absence of more diagnostic details, the fragments could not

be assigned a specific manufacturer. However, the color was distinct enough to suggest that the
dish (or dishes) was manufactured after the mid-1930s and more likely to have been used during
the middle decades of the twentieth century.
The complex consisting of an abandoned house, attached garage, mobile home, and three
outbuildings, linked by framing sided with sheet metal, occurs within the middle of the corridor
and extends west-to-east along the top of the landform. The south side of the compound is lined
with discarded refuse consisting of a refrigerator, 55-gallon metal drums, subsurface drilling
equipment, and domestic and architectural debris. An abandoned Ford Econoline van is parked
west of the south side of the house, and two additional refuse piles occur north of the east end of
the structural compound.
According to TxDOT employee Davis Melton (personal
24

communication 12 March 2008), county property tax records indicate that the house was
constructed in 1950. A moderate-sized, empty rectangle appears on the 1970 USGS Lamesa
South 7.5' quadrangle in the location of the observed structures (see Figure 11), indicating that the
house had been abandoned by the time the map was published. More recent items, such as the
van, which appears to be a 1980s model, indicate that the location continued to be used, perhaps
not for habitation but for storage and/or dumping.
Originally, the complex of structures and associated subsurface materials were considered a
locality. However, upon discovering that at least the initial occupation of the house would have
occurred over 50 years ago, the location was upgraded to a site, 41DS15. Because project area
boundaries limited investigation to the north and south and all of the positive shovel tests except
for ST 3, Transect 1, were along the north and south of the structural complex, with the greatest
artifact concentrations north of (behind) the main house, no additional refinement of the site
boundary was determined necessary. ST 3, Transect 1, a positive shovel test, was approximately
5 m south of the north ROW edge and 9–10 m south of a fence that separates the property from a
golf course. Transect shovel tests to the east and west were sterile. ST 4, Transect 2, was also
positive but only produced two artifacts and was near the edge of the landform; therefore, the
transect was discontinued. Site artifact deposits were shallow and of low density and, with one
exception, confined to within 10–20 m of the house structure. The artifacts, as well as the
structure, were fairly recent and appeared to be mixed with subsequent dumping episodes, very
much limiting the site’s research potential.

RADIO ROAD/CR L TO SH 137
This segment consists of a proposed 300-ft-wide ROW of new highway alignment and primarily
extends across a large cotton field (Figure 15), although the western terminus also crosses a horse
stable and paddock area, a house, a relatively bare lawn, and a driveway (Figure 16). Ground
exposure ranged between 30–100 percent, and typically exceeded 80 percent. Investigators
traversed the area in six 15-m (50-ft) transects. No artifacts were observed on the ground surface,
despite the project area’s proximity to site 41DS8 along the east half of the corridor segment (see
Figure 15). No evidence of the site was observed. Although it is possible the site occurs south of
the project area, the site was already disturbed and not substantial in terms of artifact density
when recorded in 1998. Most likely, agricultural activities over the past decade have obliterated
all evidence of the site. The only cultural materials encountered were several bits of modern trash
(Figure 17) including newspaper, plastic bags, aluminum cans, plastic bottles, and butchered
animal bones that probably originated from the city landfill immediately north and were either
blown south by the winds or carried out by animals.

SH 137 TO CR 22
The section of the project area in this location extends along the northwest side of the present SH
349 and consists of both new and existing ROW. Width of the corridor extends 200 ft from the
edge of the existing road pavement and mostly along plowed cotton fields (Figure 18). Ground
visibility in this area is excellent and is usually greater than 70 percent. The existing ROW
indicated disturbance from grading and buried utility lines. The proposed ROW often
demonstrated disturbance from deeply plowed furrows, and no archeological materials were
observed in these fields. ROE was not permitted for one parcel south of FM 2052 (see Figure 2);

however, it could be viewed from both the present ROW and the proposed ROW on property to
the west where access was allowed. The property demonstrated greater than 50 percent ground
visibility and was partially disturbed by two structures. No evidence of archeological materials
was noted.

SH 349–SH 137 INTERCHANGE
In addition to widening SH 349 in this location, the interchange will also be reconfigured. The
periphery of a triangular piece of property surrounded by SH 349, SH 137, and FM 2052
(presumably this road will also be altered slightly at its intersection with SH 349) and a segment
east of SH 137 between its intersections with SH 349 and FM 2052 were examined. New and
existing ROW will extend 50 ft from the edge of the present pavement along these road segments,
and only a single transect was walked. The triangular property west of SH 137 consists of a
plowed field in the southern two-thirds, and a house (Figure 19), outbuildings, and horse paddock
in the northern third. Ground exposure ranged from 30 to 50 percent. No artifacts were
observed, and although the house is outside the project area, the driveway, underground utilities,
and landscaping have no doubt disturbed the area east and north of the house. A plowed field lies
east of SH 137 and it permitted similar visibility. No archeological materials were observed in
this area. Grading of the natural ground surface to accommodate road construction and
installation of subsurface utility lines has impacted existing ROW (Figure 20).

CR 22 TO FM 829
The southwest 7.57 mi of the project area were previously investigated in a survey by Hicks &
Company in 2007. This part of the corridor extends along the east side of SH 349 across several
agricultural fields. GMI archeologists conducted a windshield survey to determine if any
characteristics about the geography or ground cover warranted a closer look and found none.
However, two archeological sites recorded during the previous investigation are located along
this segment, and they were revisited to determine if they were still present and whether they had
changed appreciably. Site 41DS13 (Figure 21) is the more northern of the two sites and was
recorded as a surface scatter of historic domestic and architectural artifacts. When the site was
inspected during the present investigation, it appeared similar to its description in the Hicks &
Company project report. The observed scatter extended approximately 120 m north-to-south and
30 m east-to–west, and it consisted of historic ceramic fragments; clear, brown, solarized, blue
and aqua container glass fragments; milk glass fragments; aqua window glass fragments; a metal
screw; wire nails; a fence staple; a brick fragment; a metal rod; a glass marble; and a clear glass
aspirin or pill bottle (Figure 22). The bottle appears to have had a stopper top and was
manufactured by a fully automated process. The base of the bottle exhibits an Owens ring and is
embossed with the letter “I” in a circle above “2 ½ FL. OZ./ 4.” The circled “I” indicates that the
bottle was manufactured by Owens-Illinois Glass Company. That particular mark was first
introduced around 1954 and is still used (Whitten 2008). The Owens mark and absence of any
childproofing along the opening of the bottle suggest that it was manufactured toward the earlier
end of the timeline. This would coincide with the mid-twentieth-century date postulated for the
site by the original investigators. The only difference was that three prehistoric chert flakes

addressed in the report of the previous investigation. Most likely the flakes were recently
exposed through erosive processes.

Site 41DS14 (Figures 24 and 25) was recorded as a low-density scatter of worked chert and
burned caliche. Despite extensive surface examination, only one chert flake was identified within
the site location, and it was found near the highway within the existing ROW. The wind was
extremely strong the day the site was revisited, and in the absence on any significant ground
vegetation, large amounts of sand were blown about. Some of these very recent sand deposits
obscured the ground surface. A shovel test was excavated on each side of CR 26, a road that
divides the site into north and south portions. Both shovel tests indicated strong brown (7.5YR
5/6) sand at the surface above 50 cm (20 in) of yellowish red (5YR 5/8) sandy loam underlain by
yellowish red (5YR 4/6) sandy clay loam. No artifacts were recovered, and although soil deposits
indicated some thickness, plow ruts were approximately 20 cm (8 in) deep, and chunks of
recently plowed soil in some areas included the red clay subsoil (Figure 26). Most likely, what
little of the site that remained when it was recorded has probably been removed or relocated by
recent plowing.

SUMMARY OF RESULTS AND RECOMMENDATIONS

The cultural resources investigation documented in this report was undertaken with three primary
management goals in mind:
1. to locate all historic and prehistoric cultural resources occurring within the designated
project area;
2. to evaluate the significance of these resources in regard to their potential for inclusion in
the NRHP; and
3. to make recommendations for the treatment of these resources in relation to the proposed
undertaking, based on their NRHP evaluations.

NATIONAL REGISTER OF HISTORIC PLACES CRITERIA
The assessment of significance of cultural resources properties is based on federal guidelines.
The criteria to evaluate properties for inclusion in the NRHP are codified under the authority of
the National Historic Preservation Act of 1966, and the Advisory Council on Historic
Preservation has set forth the following regulations to define significance and to determine
eligibility of cultural resources:
The quality of significance in American history, architecture, archeology, engineering, and culture is
present in districts, sites, buildings, structures, and objects that possess integrity of location, design,
setting, material, workmanship, feeling, and association and
(a) that are associated with events that have made a significant contribution to the broad patterns of
our history; or
(b) that are associated with the lives of persons significant in our past; or
(c) that embody the distinctive characteristics of a type, period, or method of construction, or that
represent the work of a master, or that possess high artistic values, or that represent a significant
and distinguishable entity whose components may lack individual distinction; or
(d) that have yielded or may be likely to yield, information important in prehistory or history [39 CFR
Part 60].

35

At the survey level of investigation, the principal research objective is the determination of
whether a cultural resources property possesses the potential to make a contribution to one or
more of the above-defined criteria. The objective is to determine which cultural resources
properties could yield further data regarding regional, methodological, or theoretical research
questions. Therefore, adequate information on site function, context, and chronological
placement from both archeological and, if appropriate, historical perspectives is essential for
cultural investigations. Because research questions vary as a result of geography and temporal
period, determination of site context and chronological placement of the cultural properties is a
particularly important objective during the inventory process.

SUMMARY RESULTS
One new site, 41DS15, a historic house site, was recorded during the present investigation, and an
attempt was made to revisit three previously recorded sites. No evidence of 41DS8, a prehistoric
lithic scatter, was observed. Although the site might be slightly farther south than the proposed
project corridor that was examined, more likely, what little of it that was present when originally
recorded in 1998 has been destroyed or removed by agricultural activities over the past decade.
Similarly, site 41DS14, another small lithic scatter that had been impacted by years of cultivation
before it was recorded, has all but disappeared. The location was identified, but only a single
chert flake was observed in the existing ROW along SH 349. No cultural materials were
identified within the plowed field, or in the two shovel tests, where the site was originally
recorded. Site 41DS13, a historic artifact scatter, is extant and appears to have changed little
since it was recorded a year ago. The site dimensions are similar to those reported by the original
investigators, although a prehistoric component, indicated by three chert flakes on the ground
surface, was also identified.

RECOMMENDATIONS
Previously recorded site 41DS8 does not occur within the current proposed project corridor;
therefore, protection of the site is not necessary. Previously recorded site 41DS13 is in the same
general condition as when it was originally recorded. The site was determined to be ineligible for
NRHP or SAL listing because of poor contextual integrity and limited research potential. No
reason exists for amending this conclusion. Despite discovery of a few previously unreported
lithic artifacts, the contextual issues remain. Less of previously recorded site 41DS14 is present
than was reported a year ago, to the extent that it has almost disappeared and nothing is left to
protect.
At least part of the occupation/use of newly recorded site 41DS15 occurred more than 50 years
ago. However, context has been compromised by subsequent dumping on the site. Existing
artifact deposits are limited in area, low in density, and limited in the information that they
convey. The structures on the site have already been evaluated for significance and were
determined to have none (Davis Melton, personal communication 12 March 2008). Therefore,
41DS15 is not considered eligible for inclusion in the NRHP or for listing as an SAL. The
proposed project will have no adverse impact on existing or potential NRHP properties or SALs
because none are present within the proposed highway corridor. Therefore, it is recommended
that the project be allowed to proceed without additional investigation.
