ABSTRACT
phase III extensive excavations of prehistoric archeological
sites within Palmetto Bend Reservoir in Jackson County~ Texas~
carried out by the Texas Archeological Survey for the Bureau
of Reclamation~ are reported in the final volume of a series
of six.
The seven sites selected for intensive study range
in age from Late
leoindian to Late Prehistoric.
ositions
formulqted in the research design for phase I investigations in
the Reservoir are reevaluated in the context of the archeological
recovery of Phase III.
The evidence all points to a stable
lifeway established by the Middle Archaic Period, and perhaps
as early as Late Paleoindian times, which closely resembled
ethnohistoric accounts of the coastal Indians at contact.
A study of the effects of inundation on soils and archeological
remains, as well as an analysis of recovered faunal material,
are appended.

PREFACE
This volume is the sixth and final in the Palmetto
Bend series published by the Texas Archeological Survey,
The University of Texas at Austin. The results of extensive
excavations at seven prehistoric sites during the Phase III
field season (1977) are presented. All of these excavations
were conducted by TAS field crews under the direct supervision
of William B. Fawcett, Jr. who also directed the laboratory
analysis of the primary artifacts.
Fawcett left Austin to enter graduate school in another
state before the manuscript of this, and the previous volume,
NO.5 in this series, were complete. The editorial staff of
TAS has exercised considerable latitude in the arrangement
and content of this volume. Much of the original text has
been deleted and additional material has been supplied by the
editors from field notes and the collections. The objective
has been to present equitable coverage of the sites excavated
and the data recovered, and to relate this information to
previous work in the Reservoir.
In general then, errors of omission should be attributed
to the editors while Mr. Fawcett should be given credit for
the methods employed in both excavation and analysis.
It should also be noted that Appendix I by Alf Sjoberg
was accomplished in cooperation with the National Park Service
as part of an inundation study and was not directly related
to the archeology. Those portions that relate directly to
the sites have been incorporated into the main text where
appropriate.

INTRODUCTION
This, the final report in a series of six issued by the
Texas Archeological Survey (p. ii), presents the resul ts of the
Phase III intensive archeological excavations within Palmetto
Bend Reservoir, Jackson County, Texas, a project sponsored by
the Bureau of Reclamation. Three of these previous reports were
devoted to the historic and two to the prehistoric resources
within the Reservoir. Detailed environmental background, the
history of the Reservoir project and of previous archeological
and historical work in the area have been presented in these
and other preceding
reports (Wakefield 1968; Mallouf, Fox and
Briggs 1973; McGuff 1978; McGuff and Fawcett 1978) and will not
be repeated here.
Zones are defined as: the coastal marine - the area along
bay edges, barrier islands, and estuaries; coastal inland - ex­
tends from the inland areas, 40-60 miles from the coast, down to
the estuaries (McGuff 1978: 13, 21). Palmetto Bend Reservoir is
located on the boundary between the coastal inland and the
coastal marine (McGuff 1978: 169) making it an excellent data
source for the study of cultural change through adaptation to
adjacent but distinct environments.
McGuff (1978: 51) defined the prehistoric research goals
for Palmetto Bend Reservoir as the development of hypotheses
IIconcerning the ways in which patterns of subsistence systems
were manifested and to identify similarities and differences
between patterns in a time perspective." A second objective
was the isolation of variables which defined this diversity.
McGuff (1978: 14-20) argued for cautionary use of ethnohistorical
literature in South and Central Texas, suggesting that this
information is variably reliable. Instead, general huntergat her e r the 0 r y and the know n arc heo log i cal d a t a (ibid.: 9 - 13 )
were applied to derive a series of testable propositions (ibid.:
29-35). At the conclusion of the Phase I investigations, these
propositions were evaluated in the light of the newly gathered
d a t a (ibid".: 165- 173 ). Th us, Ph as e I II ex c a vat ion s we reo r i en ted
toward the acquisition of information which bore upon the
following problem domains.
Proposition 1. Archeological localities on this part
of the coast are evidence of a simple hunting and
gathering pattern in UJ'hioh peop Ze were non-sedentary.

It was expected that if this proposition were true, the
faunal remains would reflect seasonal occupations, small group
size would result in small site areas, storage or other permanent
facilities would be largely absent, and food refuse would

2

indicate that only non-domesticated species were exploited.
The analysis of the cultural remains recovered during
the Phase I excavations largely met the test requirements.
Faunal remains were of species seasonably available during the
fall and the spring. Average site size was less than 7000
square meters; only one site was of larger dimensions (16,500 m2
No storage facilities were isolated; the only features exposed
were fire hearths and a single burial, and only wild species
of plants and animals were indicated by the food refuse and
artifactual assemblages.

).

Proposition 2.
Before the Late Prehistoric, coastaZ
adaptation concentrated principaZZy on inZand resources.
However, in that adaptation coastaZ mapine resources
were occasionaZZy taken advantage of as part of the
seasonaZ rounds.
Proposition J.
During the TransitionaZ to Late Prehis­
toric, an expZicitZy coastaZ marine adaptation deveZoped
out of a society with a coastaZ inZand adaptation.

Archeological indications of the validity of Propositions
2 and 3 would consist of a predominance of items of coastal
marine origin in assemblages created prior to the Late Prehis­
toric, implying scheduled stops in the cyclic round of the
inland groups. The evidence for coastal exploitation would de­
cline sharply during the transitional period, followed by a
return to a more stable relationship with the environment in the
Late Prehistoric.
Although the archeological evidence recovered during
Phase I excavations seems to support both the above propositions,
McGuff felt that this could be a result of fluctuations in the
physical environment in the vicinity of these sites and con­
sidered the proposition neither tested nor refuted.
Proposition 4.
Early Middle-Prehistoric and Transitional
to the Late Prehistoric period societies practiced an
adaptive strategy which was not stahle.
Proposition 5.
Middle and Zate MiddZe-Prehistoric as
weZZ as Late Prehistoric coastaZ inZand societies
practiced a stable adaptive strategy.

The proposed instability would be reflected in the archeo­
logical record by the wide spatial distribution of sparse
midden deposits and by the more random nature of seasonal occu­
pations. Conversely, the increased stability in adaptive
patterns would result in more rigid scheduling evidenced by
the reuse of locations for a specific purpose.
Limited support for these two propositions was recovered
in one level of one site tested; McGuff considered the effects

of post-depositional disturbances at the other sites had
effectively obscured either corroborative or negative evidence
and that more refined excavation techniques were essential to
adequately test these hypotheses.
Proposition 6.
On the coastal inland, during the Late
Prehistoric and middle and late Middle-Prehistoric
periods, lived nomadic hunters and gatherers who were
significantly unlike present exampZes of that type of
society in temperate climates.

The testing of this proposition relied upon finding in
the archeological deposits evidence of more permanent facilities,
thus of long-term use of sites within less flexible boundaries,
and that this territoriality would be reflected by increased
conflict.
McGuff believed that some indications of facilities could
be detected and that the similarities in the cultural remains
through time suggested the use of the area by a single group of
closely related groups. Negative evidence was used in support
of the territoriality of this group.
Proposition 7.
During the middle and late Middle Pre­
historic and Late Prehistoric periods, but reaching a
climax in the late Middle Prehistoric, inland hunters
and gatherers developed a structure that included social
stratification.

Social stratification would be reflected by the recovery
of status goods in habitations and burials, especially in those
attributable to the late Middle Prehistoric.
McGuff felt that Phase I recovery data pertinent to the
testing of Proposition 7 was inadequate and that further exami­
nation of additional sites might result in restatement of the
terms of the hypothesis.
Proposition 8.
From the middle or early Middle Prehis­
toric periods until late in the Late Prehistoric period
the same peoples occupied the Central Texas Gutf Coastal
inland.
Outsi
groups did not make that area part of
their territories.

The test of Proposition 8 was the recovery of evidence
for stability in adaptation to the environment and cultural con­
tinuity. McGuff felt that the rigid scheduling in site occu­
pation and the similarities in subsistence-related items ful-"
filled these expectations,
Proposition 9.
A group or groups of peopZes from outside
the coastal inland began late in the Late Prehistoric
period to include portions of the coastal inland in their
exploitative range.

4

Support for this proposition would consist of detected
changes in the faunal resources exploited, the tools used, and
conflict between indigenous and intruding populations. At one
site, in one unit, faunal and artifactual material resembled
assemblages characteristic of the Plains type. No additional
evidence could be brought to bear on this specific problem.
In addition to the evaluation of the propositions, a
number of additional observations were presented as a result of
the Phase I investigations. During the Archaic Period, tool
assemblages were characterized by a high percentage of thick,
bi-convex bifaces, reflecting the importance of a core-biface
lithic reduction sequence in which lithic material was in­
efficiently utilized (McGuff 1978: 161). Marine shell tools
were also heavily utilized.
During the Late Prehistoric Period, the technology changed
to a flake-tool form with a high percentage of thin distal
retouched items. Lithic raw material was more effectively
utilized and very few marine shell tools were manufactured (a~. ).
Late in the period the assemblage was characterized by thin.
plano-convex bifaces and laterally retouched items.
The Phase II testing program and intensive archeological
survey were conducted during the spring of 1976 (McGuff and
Fawcett 1978). Of the eighteen archeological sites tested, seven
prehistoric and two historic sites were recommended for extensive
excavations (see Freeman and Fawcett 1980 for the results of
historic site studies). Selection was based on site intactness~
age of the deposits, and potential for the recovery of sub­
sistence and seasonality data. The Phase III goal was to obtain
a data base for the upper portion of the Reservoir comparable
to that of the lower section.

ENVIRONMENTAL BACKGROUND
INTRODUCTION
Detailed environmental backgrounds and the results of
additional botanical studies (McGuff and Fawcett 1978) have
been presented in previous reports on the cultural resources
of Palmetto Bend Reservoir (Wakefield 1968; Mallouf, Fox and
Briggs 1973; McGuff 1978; McGuff and Fawcett 1978). Only a
discussion of paleoclimatic factors and geomorphological events
which influenced the evaluation of the excavation data are
briefly summarized herein.
PALEOCLIMATIC RECONSTRUCTION
In Texas, palynology has provided most of the data for
paleoclimatic reconstruction. Pollen studies have been con­
ducted at Soefje (Graham and Heimsch 1960; Bryant and Shafer
1977) and Hershop (Larson, Bryant and Patty 1972) in Gonzales
County, within 100 miles of Palmetto Bend Reservoir (see also
Bryant 1978a; Bryant and Shafer 1977).
From 10,000 B.P. to the present, a gradual reductionin
arboreal pollen types (with the exception of oak (Quercus spgs))
and an increse in herbs and grasses implies a drying trend.
Tree cover decreased, uplands became post oak savannahs, and
floodplains more open woodlands. Generally, the environment
can be classed as less mesic.
Between 7000 and 4500 years ago, the gradual increase in
grass and decline in arboreal pollen reflects a hotter and/or
drier climate than before. Termination of the trend remains
unclear, at least in south-central Texas. At Hershop bog
(Larson, Bryant and Patty 1972: 366), a dramatic increase in
compositae and graminae pollen about 3500 B.P. correlates with
stabil ity in arboreal poll en frequency.
Pollen recovery from Palmetto Bend archeological sites
was unsatisfactory. Schoenwetter and Rankin (1976) suggest
that if larger samples were processed, adequate 200 grain
pollen counts might have been obtained. Bryant (1978a)
failed to recover pollen from any of the Phase I archeological
sites. Poor results were also obtained from Phase III samples.
Like Schoenwetter and Rankin, Bryant did recover pollen at
41JK163. Bryant (1978b: 37) seems to feel that low pollen
recovery is due to the low organic content of some sediments.
Only at 41JK163 did soil samples contain over 2 percent organic
matter.

GEOMORPHOLOGY
The present geomorphology of coastal Texas is heavily
related to past fluctuations in sea-level (Fig. 2), which in
turn resulted from variations in glaciation. Sea levels
remained stationary (still stands) at 48 fathoms (18500 to
15000 B.P.), 29 fms.(11000-10500 B.P.). 23 fms. (11000-7500
B.P.), and 9 fms. (10000-7500 B.P.) (Frazier 1974: 24; Brown
et al. 1976: 21, Fig. 5; McGowen et al. 1976: 16). During
periods of still stand and rising sea level, valleys filled
with sediments and stream gradients decreased (Bernard et aZ.
1970: 3; McGowen and Brewton 1975: 9). In addition, localized
erosion and formation of oxbows occurred (Curray 1960: 263;
Bernard et al. 1970: 9; Brown et at. 1976: 19; McGowen et al.
1976: 16). Oxidized soils or hiatal surfaces are correlated
with glacial periods when sea-level was low or at still stand;
organic materials accumulated during these periods. Rises
in sea-level caused estuary displacement upstream (Frazier'
1974: 1-7).
During periods of falling sea-level. in which
stream gradients increased. the zone of deposition moved
downstream and streams became entrenched (Frazier 1974: 8;
McGowen and Brewton 1975: 9). The deeply incised channels of
the Lavaca and Navidad rivers eroded between 30000 and 18000
years ago when the sea-level was 450 ft. below the present
(McGowen et al. 1976: 30).
Water of the Gulf of Mexico first invaded the Lavaca­
Navidad estuary 11000 to 10500 B.P. (McGowen et aZ. 1976: 16).
The Gulf influence extended as far as the head of Lavaca Bay
from 10000 to 7500 B.P. In association with this still stand
relict barrier islands formed 3 to 6 mi. seaward of the present
islands (Brown et al. 1976: 21). The Gulf, at this time,
extended inland along incised river valleys as far as 26 mi.
Valleys were drowned and wave eroded (McGowen et aZ. 1976:
16-17).
Transgression (rising sea-level) resumed about 7500 B.P.
reaching the present level still stand about 2800 to 2500 years
ago (McGowen and Brewton 1976: 6; Parker 1960: 329). Increasingly
arid winds in the Late Holocene (7500-4500 B.P.) carried eolian
material inland (Brown et aZ. 1976: 21). Deposition into bays
also increased. Soils from this time period have high frequen­
cies of calcium carbonate in their B-horizons (Price 1933:
500, 503, 513); those formed under more humid conditions have
higher percentages of aluminum, silica, iron and manganese.
Around 2500 years ago, estuaries were 5 to 10 mi. inland
from the present river mouths (Brown et al. 1976: 21). Barrier
islands were not continuous until about 1800 B.P., promoting
higher bay salinity prior to this date. Earlier bays with
little or no circulation had elongated narrow estuaries and
lacked lagoons. As sea-level rose, oyster reefs grew up the
bays. Bays reached their maximum depth and salinity

aa. 8000 B.P. (Shepard and Moore 1950: 147-150). Barrier
islands began to form after 3000 B.P. (McGowen et al.. 1976:

19, 30). Since the most recent still stand, the Lavaca River
has prograded about 2.7 mi. into Lavaca Bay (ibid.).

Coastal Terraces
During the Holocene a number of terraces formed between
the Late Pleistocene Beaumont Formation and the modern flood
plain. These have been grouped under the name Deweyville
terrace which dates between 18000 and 4500 B.P. (Fisher et aZ.
1973: 44, 1972: 40; McGowen et aZ.1976: 51; Bernard and
LeBlanc 1965: 149). Ranging between 25 and 40 ft. above
mean sea level. the Deweyville terrace extends 20 to 30 mi.
inland along the rivers of the Gulf Coast. Only extreme
floods are capable of submerging this terrace. Baker and
Penteado-Orellana (1977: 410-411) have estimated the terrace{s)
formed under conditions ;n which stream discharge was 6 to 7
times the present rate. This resulted in sediments/deposits
which are more coarse than either the Beaumont Formation or
Recent material (Gagliana and Thorn 1967). The terrace represents
old alluvial surfaces or valley walls consisting of meander
belt sands (Brown et at. 1976: 19-21, 56).
Since it is probable that one or more terraces are being
subsumed by the Deweyville designation, making the dating of
the deposits problematical (cf. McGuff 1978: 44), studies of
the lower Colorado River valley are reviewed.
The Lower Colorado River Valley
Recently, a series of geologic studies of the lower
Colorado River within Bastrop and Fayette counties (Looney
and Baker 1977; Baker and Penteado-Orellana 1977).
clearly demonstrate that the Deweyville terrace is in fact
composed of three sets of terraces. Based on changes in
channel characteristics and sediment transport size, climatic
inferences have been proposed.
The period from 13,000 to 10,000 BP was characterized
by an equable climate with uniform rainfall and fairly high
humidity. The following period from 10000 to 7000 B.P. shows
an increase in seasonal variation in rainfall and temperature
which led to decreased plant cover, and increased erosion and
channel incision. An aggradation phase between 7000 and 3000
B.P. was followed by a brief return to more mesic conditions.
During this period, 3000 to 2000 B.P., grass cover increased.
The last 2000 years have been characterized by a return to more
arid conditions; the Colorado River underwent periodiC entrench­
ments and aggradations. In general, this most recent period has
been less environmentally stable.

Regional Geomorphology:

A Summary

The regional paleoenvironmental and geologic history can
be summarized into the following sequence. Sea water first
entered the Lavaca-Navidad estuary between 11000 and 10500 B. P.
The period of Deweyville terrace formation (13000 to 10000 B. P.)
had an equable climate with uniform rainfall. The terrace is
consistently 10 to 15 m. in elevation above the present stream
channels.
The following period (10000-7000 B. P.) was one of gradual
drying during which tree coverage decreased and grass and herb
frequency increased. Rainfall decreased and became more sea­
s a na 1. 0uri ng the s tills tan d (- 9 fm s) sed i men t a x ida t ion and
formation of soils occured. The Gulf extended to the head of
Lavaca Bay. or about 26 miles inland from its present position.
As a direct result, the drowned river valleys were wave eroded.
The period between 7000 and 4500 B. P. has been tradition­
ally termed the A1titherma1. Palynological evidence suggests
that during this period grass cover increased while tree cover
further decreased below previous levels. It is a period of in­
creased aridity with highly calcified soils. Drying and de­
creasing plant cover stimulated eolian erosion in coastal areas.
Sediment deposition into bays increased. Sea-level gradually
rose but bays remained poor in circulation and high in salinity.
Between 3500 and 4500 B. P. major erosion occured due to increased
flood magnitude and frequency.
A brief mesic period (3000-2000 B. P.) followed. during which
arboreal pollens increased sligntly in frequency and rainfall
increased in magnitude and equability.
Barrier islands formed across Matagorda Bay. decreasing
salinity and improving bay circulation. The present sea-level
was also reached. These processes probably decreased the avail­
ability of Gulf marine animals. while at the same time they in­
creased overall estuary productivity. Next a period of entrench­
ment occured ca. 2000 B. P.
The last 2000 years can be characterized as a period of
less stable environmental conditions with periodiC drought. more
seasonal rainfall. and episodes of both aggradation and en­
trencnment.
Upper Palmetto Bend Reservoir Geology and Paleoenvironment
A simplified local geological sequence has been formulated
from profiles which were drawn and observed during the Phase II
and III investigations. used in conjunction with C14 dates. The
key profile upon which this sequence is based is located 200­
300 meters north of the Pratka site (41JK53). Only at this
locality was the full stratigraphic sequence observed. At the
base of the sequence. a compact red clay nad been deeply weathered.

deposit, suggesting formation under damper and cooler climatic
conditions than at present. At 41JK163 and 41JK59 a series of
classic PZainview Golondrina and DarZ hoxie projectile points
were recovered from this deposit. These imply an age of
5000 to 8300 B.C. for formation and weathering of the deposit.
A soil remnant (A-horizon) is present on the surface of the
"red clay" over portions of the School House site (41JK59).
It is believed that most of the artifacts were deposited in
this soil horizon, but were then transported downward in
subsequent deflation, weathering, and cracking. This A-horizon
probably formed during the -9 fms. still stand (10000-7400 B.P.)
(Frazier 1974: 24 and numerous others).
Sometime prior to 5000 or 4000 B.C. erosion removed much of
the A-horizon, weathering and cracking the upper clay surface.
This erosional episode may correlate with the long-proposed
Altithermal (Antevs 1955), although there is no broad, convincing
evidence of its effects in this region.
During the following period, a light brown carbonaceous
silt was deposited and solidified by calcium carbonate accumu­
lation. These deposits have been observed at the Chytka (pro­
nounced HIT-KA) site (41JK66, Zone 4); the Pratka site (41JK53),
Olsovsky site (41JK74), and in the lowest portion of 41JK91
(McGuff 1978). Projectile points recovered from these sites
are indicated by a Middle to Late Archaic age. Radiocarbon
dates range between 300 and 3880 B.C. Analysis of land snails
recovered from these and later sites suggest that by 4000 B.C.
the modern plant communities were established and that these
have not changed substantially since then. The major difference
between Archaic and Late Prehistoric environments is the decrease
in the availability of brackish water and marine animal species
as a result of barrier island formation.
On the basis of available faunal remains, geology and paly­
nology, little is currently known about the Late Prehistoric
paleoenvironment. There is no good evidence for the so-called
Little Ice Age (A.D. 1500-1800) except perhaps for the brief
appearance of bison in the area between A.D. 1200 and 1400/1500
which may indicate a dispersion on the Plains prompted by
increased rainfall and grass cover (cf. Reher 1977). Bison
population radiation may have pushed isolated individuals and
small herds into areas like South, Central and Coastal Texas.
There is no evidence for drastic environmental changes during
the past 1500 years.

THE SCHOOL HOUSE SITE

41JK59, the site of a late nineteenth - early twentieth
century school house, was recorded as a historic site in the
first intensive survey of Palmetto Bend Reservoir (Mallouf.
Fox and Briggs 1973: Table 14). Located south of the town
of Ganado on the south side of Mustang Creek (Fig. 1), the site
would be inundated by reservoir impoundment. Testing of the
site during Phase II was carried out to ascertain if any
historic structural remnants remained intact. None were found
but in the process of profiling the backhoe trenches, a buried
soil horizon containing highly patinated chert artifacts was
exposed (McGuff and Fawcett 1978: 16). Based on the presence
of this intact buried cultural level and the potentially early
age of occupation, the site was recommended for intensive
excavation.
EXCAVATION TECHNIQUES
A contour map of the site was prepared (Fig. 3) and the
plow zone and sandy loam deposits removed with a backhoe to a
depth of 10 to 20 cm. above the buried prehistoric zone. Up to
one meter of overburden was excavated from an 8 by 16 m. area.
The western half of this area was staked into 1 m. squares and
elevations of the scraped surface recorded at each unit corner.
A checkerboard pattern of units (Fig. 4b) was then excavated
in 10 cm. arbitrary levels.
The scraped surface had been compacted by the heavy
machinery and baked to a brick-like consistency by the sun.
Picks were used to remove this 10 cm. crust. The remainder of
the fill was shovel-scraped and water screened through ~ in.
mesh (Fig. 4a). Historic debris, such as glass slivers, were
a constant hazard to the screeners despite heavy rubber gloves,
This hardship, in addition to the difficulty in removing the baked
fill, dictated a decision to excavate only an 8 by 8 meter
checkerboard of alternating units.
The southwest corner, used to designate the unit, was se­
lected for removal of special columns, 32 em. square, which were
fine-screened to aid in the recovery of faunal. botanical, and
cultural material. These columns constitute a 10% sample of
the unit volume.
Profiles were drawn along all the north grid coordinate
lines. Black and white photographs and color slides, field notes,
field catalogs, level reports, and sketch maps were used to
document the excavations. All project records and collected
specimens are curated at the Texas Archeological Research

SOILS AND STRATIGRAPHY
The natural stratigraphy of the School House site is
presented in Figure 5. Zones 3 and 4 are believed to corres­
pond to the Deweyville terrace. Iron and manganese concre­
tions are concentrated in these zones, implYing formation
under cooler and damper climatic conditions than at present.
PZa£nview~ GoZondrina~ and Darl hoxie dart points found at 41JK
163 and one probable Angostura dart point base recovered at
41JK59 in these deposits support an early Holocene time estimate.
The most recent time estimates for Plainview (ca. 8200 B.C.),
GoZondrina (ca. 7000 B.C.), and Angostura (ca. 6000 B.C.) in the
South Texas region are summarized by Hester (1980). The Dar!

the San Geronimo Phase, ca. 7000 to 6000 years ago in east and
central Texas (Weir 1976).

Intensive weathering and erosion removed some of these Zone
3 deposits and deeply cracked Zone 4, which resulted in the
downward movement of artifacts. Calcium carbonate concretions
formed during and after this episode.
The largest number of artifacts, pebbles, and natural con­
cretions occur in Zone 3~ suggesting that it represents the de­
flated surface of a now-buried paleosol. Artifacts of all ages
are found in all zones indicating extreme mixture by shrink­
swell mechanisms and bioturbation.

The supposition that the prehistoric component has been
redeposited by erosion or deflation of the original surface is
strengthened by the results of soil chemical analysis (Table 1).

ARTIFACTS
By far the preponderance of the historic material was re­
covered from Zones 1 and 2; limited amounts were present in Zones
3 and 4, declining with depth. Twelve prehistoric plainware
sherds were also found in the uppermost zones, interspersed with
the historic material. These sherds, and probably the few non­
patinated chert artifacts which were confined to Zones 1 through
3, are indicative of a Late Prehistoric occupation but the un­
certain provenience and undoubtedly mixed nature of the deposit
precluded a secure distributional analysiS.
A class of chert artifacts made from a distinctive cream
colored chert and exhibiting a high degree of patination were
found almost exclusively in Zones 3 and 4. Only one potentially
diagnostic artifact of this material was recovered. The base of
a probable Angostura dart point indicates an age of approximately
6000 B.C. (Hester 1980). The deeper stratigraphie position and
the patina, which suggests a long-term surface exposure at some
time in the past, were used to isolate specfmens which could be
attributed to this earliest occupation. This analytiC unit was
composed of 914 artifacts - 353 chips, 424 flakes, and 87 tools
(Tabl Ii 2).
A series of distributional maps was prepared in the field
laboratory in Ganado in an attempt to detect any spatial pat­
terning of these materials throughout the 8 x 8 m. block as a
unit. Two areas differentiated by artifact size and type could
be discerned (Table 3). For simplicity, these can be viewed as
the diagonally opposed segments of the excavation block: north­
east and southwest.
The northeastern area is characterized by a high density
of artifacts of larger than average size consisting mainly of
lithic debitage and tools. A moderate number of these are
either burned, potlid-fractured, or heat-treated. The adjacent

southeastern area also has larger specimens but at much lower
densities. Few of these artifacts show any evidence of tnermal
alteration.
The southwestern area holds high densities of all artifact
types but low values for artifact size. Debitage and tools
are numerous but tend to be smaller than those in the opposing
quadrat. Many of these are potlid fractured or show signs of
thermal alteration.
The different distribution of artifacts by type and size
can be interpreted in the light of studies into functional
activity areas.

An Explanation of the Activity Area Distinctions
Two types of activity areas have been observed with some
degree of consistency in Paleoindian and Early Archaic sites of
the central and eastern United States cf. Ahler and McMillan

18

1976: 197, Fitting et aZ. 1966: 70-81, Goodyear 1974, Hester
1977b: 3, Knudson 1973: 105, 122-125, MacDonald 1968: 21-23, 132­
133, Voss 1977, and Wilmsen 1974). The first type is called a
secondary lithic reduction area. Recovered artifacts are large
flakes, frequently with cortex on a portion of·their dorsal sur­
face, and probably the result of thinning for bifacial tools.
The second type, the finishing/use area, is small (8-16m 2 ) , and
usually centered around a small, unlined hearth. Tool forms
reflect varied activities and recovered artifacts include thin
finished flakes, projectile points, scrapers and faunal remains.
These two kinds of activity areas are usually 2-5m. apart
and cover a total area ranging 100-200m 2 , and artifact density
is greater than 5/square meter. Lithic materials may be heat
treated in either type of activity area. Woodworking tools are
randomly distributed across the site area (Knudson 1973: 122­
125). Tool frequencies differ between the secondary reduction
and finishing/use activity areas. The secondary reduction areas
have a higher tool :debitage ratio. Also, final reduction/I.!~~_ __
areas should be three or four times more frequent tllan {he
secondary reduction areas.
As already noted, Early Archaic and Late Paleoindian camp­
sites are characterized by unlined hearths (Adovasio et al.
1977: 31, Ahler and McMillan 1976: 196, Alexander 1965: 510,
Broyles 1971: 20-23, Byers 1955: 274, Coe 1964: 61, Crook and
Harris 1957, Davis 1962: 61,69, Dibble and Lorrain 1965: 28-29,
Hibben 1968: 89, Hughes 1949, Jennings 1957: 54, Knudson 1973:
73, Logan 1952: 22, MacDonald 1968: 24-25. Roosa 1977: 109,
Satterthwaite 1957: 5, Wedel et al.1968: 27, and others). With
the intensive weathering and deflation that occured at 41JK59
all direct evidence of unlined hearths would probably be
destroyed. However, 1ocation of these hearths can be inferred
by the density of burned or potlid fractured lithic debitage
(MacHaffie site, Knudson 1973: 73. Holcombe Beach, Fitting et
at. 1966: 30-31), probably due to accidental burning of debitage.
Further Spatial Analysis
Based on this model the following activity area interpre­
tations are suggested for the School House site. The south­
western portion of the unit is probably a lithic artifact ­
finishing and use area. This assignment is based on the high
artifact and tool density, the high density of potlid fractured
flakes indicating the presence of an unlined hearth, and the
overall small artifact size.
The northeastern portion is believed to be a secondary
reduction area because of the large artifact size, the high ar­
tifact and debitage density. and the presence of some heat
treated lithic material. Potlid fractured flakes do occur, but
~_t a muc h 10 w~ r_~c! ens i t y t ha n_ i n_t h~QJJ th.w__e s t ~ r n po r t ion .

19

The distribution of tools -- bifaces, gouges and various
unifaces -- is in accord with the functional interpretation of
the areas. The northeastern portion (secondary reduction area)
contained thick and thin bifaces and unifaces of various forms
(mostly thick, see Table 2). Gouges occur in both this and the
area containing the only projectile point fragment recovered,
numerous thin bifaces, and thin unifaces. The overall area
covered by the checkerboard excavation (64m 2 - is almost half
the size of the average floor area. The actual size (9-16m 2 ) of
the finishing/use activity area corresponds closely with the
rna del ( 8 -16m ).

41JK163

THE LITTLE RISE SITE

The Little Rise site is located within the bluff top
forest on a locally prominent natural rise which projects into
the west side of the Navidad River flood plain (Fig. 1). In a
25x25 m. vegetation quadrat the following plant species were
identified: liveoak (Quercus sps.), anaqua (Ehretia sps.),
palmetto palm (Sabal sps.), hackberry (Celtis sps.), wild grape
(Vitia sps.), mulberry (Morus sps.), yaupon holly (IZlex sps.),
mexican persimmon (niospyros texana) , elm (Ulmus sps.), green
briar (Smilax sps.), and various grasses (McGuff and Fawcett
1979: 31-38, Quadrat 6). Yaupon holly dominated the shrub under­
story; liveoak was the most numerous tree species. As is the
case for most of the prehistoric sites within Palmetto Bend
Reservoir, three plant communities are present within an 0.5 km.
radius of the site. The closest permanent water source today
is a freshwater marsh and pond located about 100 m. south­
southeast of the site.
41JK163 was recorded and tested during Phase II investiga­
tions (McGuff and Fawcett 1978). A series of 1-2 m. long back­
hoe trenches were made along two alignments (Fig. 6). Artifacts
recovered from these were in the sandy loam. The easternmost
end of backhoe test row 2 produced a high density of lithic
artifacts. As a result, the Phase III 8x8 m. excavation block
was located here. At the time of the Phase II testing, cultural
materials in the deeper underlying red clay were not exposed.
Only during the excavation of three backhoe trenches, while out­
lining the 8 m. block and obtaining profiles, were cream color
patinated chert artifacts observed within the upper portion of the
red clay. Phase III intensive excavations concentrated upon
overlying Late Prehistoric cultural deposits and only super­
ficially sampled the earlier components.
FAUNAL SAMPLING
To the south of the site a 2 m. deep backhoe test was dug
(Fig. 6) to recover a sample of natural faunal "rain" from non­
archeological deposits for comparison with faunal collections
from cultural contexts. A O.2 m3 sediment sample was removed from
each 20 cm. arbitrary level after the profile was drawn and
photographed. These samples were water screened through 1/4 and
1/16 inch wire screen. All residue on the screens was retained
and dried. At a later date it was sorted and all faunal remains
removed and identified. The overall faunal density was low and
consisted of a few frog and rodent bones. Therefore the effect
of natural fuanal "rain" on archeological collections from this
area is believed to be minimal.

EXCAVATION METHODS
Once the 8 x 8 m. block was outlined with three backhoe
trenches and staked out in one meter grid units, the sandy
loam was removed by unit in a single level approximately 30 cm.
thick. Special columns (32 cm. square) were removed from the
southwest corner of every square. Both these and the general
fill were water screened. In units where large numbers of
cream colpred patinated chert artifacts were recovered, exca­
vation was extended below the sandy loam (Levell) into the red
clay in a series of 10 cm. arbitrary levels. Most of the actual
excavation was done by troweling and shovel scraping, and all
contiguous units within the 8 m. square block were excavated
(Fig. 7).
SOILS AND STRATIGRAPHY
The natural stratigraphy was defined by profiles of the
backhoe trenches and excavation units (Fig. 8). Most of the
Late Prehistoric artifacts were recovered from the dark sand
designated as Zone 2. While Paleoindian and Archaic artifacts
are also present, most of these came from the red clay (Zone 5),
the mottled clay (Zone 4), or the contact area of these zones.
No features, shell, bone or botanical remains were recovered
within the red clay.
Based on the examination of in situ artifacts in various
stratigraphic profiles, the cream colored patinated chert arti­
facts were associated with Zones 4 and 5, and their contact with
overlying Zone 2. Debitage and tools were first sorted on the
basis of this attribute. Those cream-colored artifacts with
patination (Fig. 9) are believed to be Paleoindian or Early
Archaic. Unpatinated lithic artifacts of other colors are be­
lieved to be Late Prehistoric (Fig. 10). The presence of bone
tempered pottery and Perdiz arrowpoints allow us to suggest
that the upper component of the site dates from the last half
of the Late Prehistoric (A.D. 100-1500). Consequently, this
component of the Little Rise site is roughly contemporary with
the Olsovsky Site (41JK178).
Geological conditions at the Little Rise Site are similar
to those at the School House Site (41JK59). The red clay is
buried below 30 cm. of sand alluvium depOSited in recent times.
The boundary is not distinct due to the soil formation processes
and the intense weathering following the initial occupation of
the site. The presence of early side-notched, Darl hoxie~ Plain­
view and Golondrina projectile points suggests that they were
deposited on tne surface of a paleosol that later eroded to its
C horizon. This occupation is estimated to date between 8050
and 5550 B.C. Artifacts made of cream colored patinated chert,

artifacts are of maxiumum size at this depth. The largest
manganese oxide concentrations also occur at this depth, but the
~reatest frequency occurs slightly below this within Level 5
(40-50 cm. below scraped surface). This pattern, which was also
observed at 41JK59, may indicate that a portion of the early
component artifacts are still in situ. Smaller artifacts found
above and below Level .4 (30-40 cm.) occur 1n these levels as a
result of soil cracking, weathering. and more recent rodent
burrowing and tree root disturbance.

Levels generally associated with burials (Wood: 1977)

(ca. 3000 parts per million) or aboriginal residential residue

(800+ parts per million) were not shown in this profile. This
suggests further that both components may represent the debris
of only very short term occupations.
DATING
No samples suitable for radiocarbon dating were obtained for
either the early or late components at the Little Rise site.
Only relative dating by comparison with other sites in the general
area is possible.
FEATURES AND ARTIFACTS
One concentration of five fire-cracked calcium carbonate
Feature 2, was located in excavation unit N18/E19
(Fig.ll). These are believed to be the remnants of a disturbed
hearth scattered over a 0.12m2 area. Two lithic artifacts were
found associated with this feature. All of these concretions
and artifacts are situated at a depth 10-20 cm. below ground
surface. No charcoal or dark organic stain was detected and no
pit or depression could be discerned in the feature cross-section.
Although bone fragments were commonly encountered in the
excavation no~e were identifiable.
Because of the narrow cultural zone and the evident mixing .
of artifacts between the strata by rodents and soil action, no
clear stratigraphic separation between the early and late com­
ponents could be established. Therefore, the admittedly somewhat
artifical separation of lithic artifacts into those made of
clearly patinated cream chert and those of other materials was
imposed in an effort to discriminate between the early and late
components. The spatial patterning analysis presented below is
based on these criteria rather than a stratigraphic separation.
concretions~

The Early Component Artifact Spatial Patterning
Only single specimens of the Golondrina and Plainview types
were found. while a number of Dart hoxie variety points were
recovered (Fig. 9). As mentioned earlier when discussing the
School House site, Prewitt (in press) has dated these points to
the San Geronimo phase of the Early Archaic - ca. 6000-7000 years
ago (Weir 1976). The early side-notched point is consistent
with this time period as well.

29

Heat Affected Chert
In an effort to detect the possible remnants of unlined
hearths, an analysis of the stone artifacts exhibiting potlid
fractures was undertaken. For the purposes of this analysis,
five analytical units were imposed on the excavation. One unit
was created in the northeast corner where the Darl hoxie and
early side-notched points were found. S~aller units were desig­
nated around the Plainview and Golondrina points. These three
divisions teft two areas in which only thick bifacial tools
had been found.
Two distributional maps of potlid fractured chert were pre­
pared. One data set included only the cream colored patinated
artifacts; the second plot was of all colors and varieties of
chert. Using the criteria of high density as proposed by Knudson
(1973: 73) and Fitting (1966: 30-31), the prior existence of at
least three hearths can be inferred, all in the analytic unit
where the Darl hoxie and early side-notched specimens were found.
Summary of Early Component
At least two occupations from the Late Paleoindian and
Early Archaic periods were defined at 41JK163. These range in
age between 8300 and 5000 B.C. The Golondrina and Plainview
components are ephemeral.
Unlike the temporally earlier activity areas, the San
Geronimo phase occupation area was the scene of both secondary
tool reduction or manufacture, and tool finishing and use.
There is also evidence of at least three unlined hearths in
this area.
Spatial Analysis of the Late Components
An analysis of all thermally altered lithic material was
undertaken to compare the results with the similiar analysis
described above. When all lithic material was included the
results were virtually replicated illustrating a clear inter­
mingling of the two components and suggests that a fair amount
of the cream chert material that showed no patination belongs
to the early component.
Summary of the Late Component
It is apparent from the artifacts recovered
the site was occupied in Late Preaistoric times.
designated Feature 2 are thought to be one focus
pation.
~ is possible, however, that more than
party used this area in these times and that the

recovered represent several episodes rather than a single occu­
pation. Given the mixed nature of the deposit, there seems
little hope of detecting the number of occupations. However, a
few fragments of sandy paste pottery, as well as some of bone
tempered fragments which is usually interpreted as much younger,
strongly suggests multiple brief occupations during the Late
Prehistoric period.
INTERPRETATION
The sl ight elevation of the site itse1 f seems to have
attracted hunting/camping parties over a long span of prehistory.
The only period not suggested by the artifacts recovered is
the Middle Archaic. It would appear therefore that the pref­
erence for sandy-capped knolls near permanent water as camping
sites prevailed as much in this area as elsewhere in Texas, and
that this preference persisted over several thousand years.

THE PRATKA SITE

The Pratka Site lies east of the Navidad River on the left
bank of Mustang Creek approximately 320 m. from the water (Fig. 1).
On the bluffedge overlooking the flood plain forest, the site is
17 m. AMSL and 11 m. above the normal level of the creek.
When originally recorded, the site, which contained both a
prehistoric and historic component, was estimated to cover 30,000
square meters (Mallouf, Fox and Briggs 1973: Table 4). However,
so much of the site had been removed for fill, exposing a 60­
centimeter-thick fresh water shell midden (Fig. 12) of estimated
Middle Archaic age, that Phase II testing was suspended in favor
of a recommendation for later intensive excavation (McGuff and
Fawcett 1978: 15).
EXCAVATION TECHNIQUES
An 8 by 8 m. block of the remnant deposits was outlined by
backhoe trenches and staked into 1 m. units (Fig. 13). The intent
to excavate the entire block was abandoned when it became apparent
that the deposit was much smaller than had been estimated. An
additional consideration was the depletion of the only source of
water for screening, a small pond which was pumped dry during the
two weeks (March 31- April 15, 1977) spent at the site. Twenty
1 x 1 m. units were excavated and all fill water-screened through
1/4 in. mesh. Within each unit and level, a special column 32 cm.
square, or 10%, was taken from the southw~st corner for fine
screening through superimposed 1/4 and 1/16 in. window mesh.
SOILS AND STRATIGRAPHY
The thickness of the midden deposit was originally estimated
at 60 cm. from its exposure along the borrow pit bank. In the
area of excavation, slightly to the east of this exposure, the
deposit was contained in the sandy A horizon which forms the upper
20 cm, of the soil profile (Fig. 14). Four natural levels were
defined in the backhoe trenches~

ARTIFACTS AND FEATURES
Bottle fragments, white ironstone sherds and square iron
nails recovered in the general fill of the Pratka Site suggest
a historic farmstead occupation in the late nineteenth century.
Although some of these artifacts were found in the lower levels
they were generally confined to the surface and Zone 1 (Fig. 14).
Lithics
The Middle Archaic dart point shown in Figure 15 is similar
to .t hos e fir s t r e c 0 vere d a t the M0 r his s Sit e (C amp be 11: 1 97 6) ,
indicating that this poorly known culture complex, first de­
fined in Victoria County, may have contributed to the shell
midden accumulation. The other whole point pictured, too large
to have been a dart point, shows no wear patterns generally
associated with use as a knife. The specimen from the Pratka
Site is made of mottled medium brown chert.
A total of 36 lithic tools were recovered from this site.
One third were retouched utilized flakes, 11 per cent were end
scrapers, 31 per cent side scrapers and 14 per cent were scrapers
with multiple use faces. One dart point, abandoned while still
in the manufacturings process, illustrates the sequence of re­
duction wherein the blade was completed before the base was
fashioned.
Features
Only one feature, a hearth composed of large calcium
carbonate concretions and containing numerous shells of the
Quadrula genus, was uncovered at the Pratka Site (Fig. 16).
Radiocarbon Dating
No samples suitable for radiocarbon dating were recovered
in excavations at the Pratka Site.
FAUNAL REMAINS
Shellfish
By far the largest class of faunal remains were the shells
from the midden deposit listed below by species. It is worth
noting that although fresh water shellfish seem to have been
the major resource exploited (199 shells), a remarkable number
of salt water shellfish are also represented.

Sna i 1 s
A total of 927 snail shells were recovered in the general
fill from the Pratka Site (Appendix III). The recovery of
shells of the Rabdotus AZternatus species, which would not
normally be found in this habitat. may imply that these were
collected in the upland areas and brought to the site.
Other Faunal Material
Some remains of turtle, horse and deer were recovered in
the fill as well as some bone that was either cow (Bos) or
Bison.
SUMMARY
The tenuous indications of a Middle Archaic occupationthe dart points similar to those from the Morhiss site- cannot
be substantiated by the rest of the artifacts or by stratigrah­
ic association. Unfortunately, the disturbed nature of the
general fill, the drastic reduction in cultural deposits by
barrowing, and the large number of clearly distoric artifacts
precludes refinement of occupational periods or associations
between the recovered cultural materials. The Pratka Site
demonstrates, however, the exploitation of transitional environ­
mental zones in prehistory. probably during the Middle and Late
Archaic periods.

41JK74

THE OLSOVSKY ROAD SITE

41JK74 is situated 0.5 km. east of the Navidad River, 50
m. south of Mustang Creek and about 2 m. above the current
normal water level at an elevation of 14 m. AMSL (Fig. 1).
The site area is in bluff top forest which blends into the
flood plain vegetational community a short distance away.
Testing of 41JK74 was carried out by the Texas Historical
Survey Committee (Mallouf, Fox and Briggs 1973). One 1x2 test
unit was excavated to sterile soil, a depth of 52 cm. Analysis
of the recovered lithic, faunal, and shell materials indicated
an Early to Middle Archaic occupation utilizing both the upland
prairie and the riverine flood plain (op cit: 123) with an
emphasis on the latter. From the preponderance of freshwater
species represented in the shell remains, it was proposed that
Mustang Creek was a free-flowing gravel-bottomed stream at the
time of occupation.
No machine testing of 41JK74 was done during the Phase II
reevaluation because of the prior damage done to the site by
borrowing for fill (McGuff and Fawcett 1978).
EXCAVATION TECHNIQUES
A block of deposits was outlined by backhoe trenches and
staked 1nto 1 m. units (Fig. 17). The original intent to exca­
vate a complete 8x8 m. block of 1 m. squares was abandoned when
it became apparent that the majority of the cultural deposits
had been destroyed by the borrowing. Thus excavations were
restricted to a small pocket of remaining cultural material.
Four contiguous lxl units were excavated in 20 em. arbitrary
levels. All fill was water-screened through 1/4 in. mesh.
Special columns, 32 cm. square, or 10% of the unit volume, were
taken from the southwest corner of the unit and fine-screened
through superimposed 1/4 and 1/16 in. mesh to aid in the recovery
of faunal, botanical, and cultural material.
SOILS AND STRATIGRAPHY
Backhoe trenches and excavation unit walls were profiled
(Fig. 18} and four natural levels were defined. A weak A and
possible B horizon had begun to develop in recent alluvium. The
greatest artifact density and high~st phosphorus content come
from Zone 3, the 50 cm. thick layer of yellow-brown sandy loam
that began generally 20 cm. below the present surface, This zone
may represent a buried A horizon.

The chemical analysis of the soils at 41JK74 (Table 6

ceed those found by Wood (1977) to indicate human occupation
which further s~ggests that this zone is the former habitation

that the absence of Late Prehistoric evidence at the site was
probably the result of bulldozing. Unfortunately, no corrobo­
rative materials from either period were recovered during the
hand excavations.
Nineteen additional 1 ithic tools were recovered at 41JK74 ­
six were fragments of ~hick bifaces, one thin biface fragment,
eleven unifaces and one Late Archaic dart point of undetermined
type. The remainder of the lithic debitage consisted of secon­
dary and tertiary flakes and mirrored the findings of the Texas
Historical Survey Committee. By far the preponderance of the
lithic material is the by-product of secondary reduction.
Faunal Remains
The analysis of the recovered fauna reflects a varied sub­
sistence based upon the hunting of deer and the exploitation
of riverine resources (Appendix III). The predominance of large
snail species suggests importation of these fauna for food,
possibly in conjunction with the harvesting of prickly pear
(Appendix II). Eighty-two bone fragments are possibly modified
for use and 203 shell items are considered to have functioned
as tools.
SUMMARY

41JK74

The excavation of the small portion of 41JK74 which remained
intact produced several lines of evidence for a long-term
utilization of the site from the Paleoindian to the Late Pre­
historic Period. The one possible PZainview projectile point
base and the two plainware sherds recovered from backhoe exca­
vations during Phase III were not augmented by additional
cultural materials of these ages so the proposed earliest and
latest aboriginal occupations are tentative at best. Similarly.
only one artifact diagnostic of each of the Archaic subdivisions
has been recorded - Early and Middle Archaic dart points by
Mallouf. Fox and Briggs (1973) and a Late Archaic dart point in
Phase III.
However. the high phosphorus content of the Zone 3 soils,
the source of most of the cultural material at 41JK74, and the
widely separated radiocarbon dates. support the proposed 10n9­
term occupation of the site. The results of these analyses,
taken in conjunction with the temporally diagnostic artifacts,
the highly varied faunal remains. the features, the modified bone
and shell tools, imply that 41JK74 was a highly favored camp
site, repeatedly used throughout the span of prehistory, because
of the optimal location for exploitation of the riverine and
upland resources.

THE CHYTKA SITE

41JK66. the Chytka site lies on the bluff ridge 100 m.
north of Mustang Creek and overlooking the flood plain from a
height of 5 m. above normal creek flow (Fig. 1). The Texas
Historical Survey Committee excavated a 1.5x2 m. test unit to
a depth of 150 cm. without reaching the bottom of the cultural
deposit (Mallouf, Fox and Briggs 1973). The recovered artifact
assemblage contained numerous arrow points and pot sherds indi­
cative of a Late Prehistoric occupation. One possible dart
point was recovered and examination of a private collection from
the site (ibid: 51) confirmed an occupational span of Early'
Archaic through the Middle and Late Archaic (ibid: 115) in
addition to the Late Prehistoric component.
Faunal and shell remains were abundant and well preserved.
A reliance on woodland and riverine resources was indicated by
the predominance of deer, turtle and fish remains. Mussels were
also a major dietary component. The presence of brackish water
Rangia and fresh water Quadrula indicates proximity to a tran­
sition zone in the riverine environment. Additional limited
testing during Phase II indicated a high possibility for recovery
of lithic. ceramic and faunal remains and more extensive exca­
vations were recommended (McGuff and Fawcett 1978: 16-17).

EXCAVATION TECHNIQUES
A 16x16 m. block adjacent to the Texas Historical Survey
Committee test pit was outlined by backhoe trenches and staked
into 1 m2 units (Fig. 20). Natural soil zones were defined by
profiles exposed in these trenches (Fig. 21). Within those
zones. vertical control was established by excavating in arbi­
trary 20 em. levels.
One hundred and one 1x1 m. units were excavated (Fig. 22)
during the period from November 17 1976 to March 4 1977. All
fill was water screened through 1/4 in. mesh. Special columns~
32 cm 2 , taken from the southwest corner of the unit were water­
screened through superimposed 1/4 and 1/16 in. mesh to aid in
the recovery of the smaller items of cultural material.

SOILS AND STRATIGRAPHY
On initial examination, the Chytka site appeared to contain
a well-preserved midden deposit overlain by a thin plow zone.
Natural level designations were assigned to zones visible in the
backhoe and excavation unit profiles (Fig. 21).
Zone 1, the 13-14. cm. deep plow zone, was a highly disturbed
layer of light to moderately gray soil (10YR3/2) with some
scattered cultural material. Zone 2, a lighter colored layer,
showed some slight effects of deep plowing but appeared to re­
tain some cultural material in its original context. Generally,
these two zones were removed and screened as a single unit.
Zone 3 was a well-defined dark gray or black (7.5-10YR3/2)
midden soil beginning about 24 cm. below the surface and averaging
41 cm. in thickness. Artifacts of all time periods were most
frequent in this zone and appeared to be largely undisturbed.
Later analysis of the recovered material, however, indicated
considerable post-depositional disturbance had taken place.
Zone 4, a clearly defined stratum of light yellow-brown
to gray (7.5-10YR3-5/2-3) soil, contained few artifacts but held
the only features exposed by the excavations.
A lens of soil between Zones 3 and 4 was designated as
Level 8. A larger area in the northeast portion of the blocked
out deposits was labelled Level 9 and the 20 cm. Levels within
that section were 9Al, 9A2, . . . . (Fig. 21 illustrates the
relationship of the level designations and zones.)

SOIL CHEMISTRY
The phosphorus levels encountered in Zone 9 soils were
three to four times higher than those found elsewhere in the
site (Table 7). One sample from 110-120 cm. depth in this area
showed 2220 parts per million phosphorus, approaching the level
found by Wood (1977:251) in known medieval burials. The bone
content of these levels was also quite high. The majority of
identifiable bone was that of whitetailed deer. No human bone
was identified. The simplest proposed explanation for the ele­
vated phosphorous levels in this area was that in Late Prehis­
toric times the partially butchered bodies of several deer were
deposited in a refuse pit dug into and through the older midden
deposit. The frequent intrusions into Level 4 shown in the
profiles and the uneven state of preservation of the recovered
bone indicated a degree of disturbance of this kind. A fairly
large number of radiocarbon samples were collected and dated in
an attempt to unravel these intrusion and date each general
stratum with some accuracy.
RADIOCARBON DATES
The complete sequence of radiocarbon dates on material from
the Chytka site is shown in Table 8. The table is arranged with
the deeper levels first, grading toward the surface. As one
might expect the deeper material tends to date older than the
more shallowly buried, with the apparent BC/AD separation between
Levels 3B and 3C. However, stratigraphic integrity is question­
able. The dates from substratum 3B, for instance, range from
AD 340 to 1210. Two of the dates from stratum 3A also fall
within this range while two are later. All dates from areas
where Level 3 was excavated as a single unit are before AD 1000.
One date from the surface layers (Tx2754) also fits into the 3B
sequence, while three dates from stratum 3A are later than the
earliest date for a sample from Levels 1 and 2.
The distribution of these dates, as well as the extensive
number of bones from burrowing mammals identified from the
various levels. the pitlike character of Zone 9 in the northeast
corner, and the appearance of Middle Archaic (Bulverde~ Abasolo)
projectile point types in the private collection examined by
the Texas Historical Survey Committee (Mallouf. Fox and Briggs
1973: 116) suggests widespread and fairly random disturbance of
the deposit by both rodents and humans.
FEATURES AND ARTIFACTS
Artifacts collected at the Chytka site are remarkably
varied in terms of time diagnostic types. The most frequent
projectile point type recovered were the Saallorn arrow points

(Fig. 23). These were found throughout Levels 1, 2 and 3 and
at least three were found in Level 4. This point type, dated
about AD 700-900, is normally considered to be earlier than
Perdiz (Hester 1980: 107) in Central Texas but the two types are
sometimes found in coeval context in South Texas.
A few of the specimens recovered at 41JK66 show the deep
edge serrations that have defined a SealZorn variant common to
McMullen County (op cit.). Figure 23 illustrates a represen­
tative range of the Scallorn points in the collection from the
Chytka site. Only three arrow points could be confidently
classified as Perdiz (Fig. 23, L,M~N).
Dart Points
The general impression of repeated brief occupations over,
a very long time period is reinforced by the dart points re­
covered from the site. Dart points were generally less frequent
than arrow points and were most common in Level 3, although the
Morrill point {Fig. 24} was found within the plow zone less than
30 cm. below the surface.
Morrill (Fig. 24L) These points have been found in contexts
that suggest they may be a form originating in east Texas and
continuing into the Alto Focus with pottery associations (Suhm
and Jelks 1962: 223).
DarZ (Fig. 241) The DarZ point type is widely distributed in
south Texas. Hester (1980: 97) places this point type temporally
in a transitional phase following the Late Archaic. Only one
s pe c i men oft his t y Dew a s r e c 0 vere d - - from N14/ Ell. Zo ne 3.
Ellis (Fig. 24E,F,G,H) Ellis points are very widely distributed
in Texas. They appear to be clearly associated with Late Archaic
occupations in south Texas and may survive into the Late Pre­
historic (Hester 1980: 101). In large samples, making distinc­
. tions between
lis, Edge~ood, FairZand and Zavalla points may
be difficult. At least one of the examples from the Chytka
site could be classed a Fairland rather than an Ellis type but
this would not change the Late Archaic time association, as all
these types are similarly distributed.
Ensor (Fig. 24M-N) The Ensor point is generally associated with
the latter half of the Late Archaic and is considered by Hester
(1980: 97) to extend into the transitional period between the
Archaic and Late Prehistoric. Speciman M and the Ellis point
{G) were recovered from the same square and level (N12/E12 Zone
3A) .
Marcos (Fig. 240)
The Marcos point type is also diagnostic of
the Late Archaic, but is generally associated with the first
h~lf of that period (Hester 1980: 97).
The illustrated speciman
came from Level 3 in N12/E4.
Palmillas (Fig. 24K) The Palmillas point type (Suhm and Jelks
1962: 229) is sometimes held to be a minor type appearing in
most Archaic stage complexes in Texas. However, Hester (1980: 102)

58

sees it as a weak typological group. The specimen pictured
was recovered from N12/E7 Level 3.
PedernaZes (Fig. 24A,B,C) This point type is typical of the
Middle Archaic in central Texas (lOOO-2000 BC) and has been
found in many south Texas sites (Hester 1980: 102). Two of the
illustrated exam~les were found in Zone 3. The smallest (e)
is from N16/E9 Zone 4. It should be noted that this same square
yielded an Ensor point and the base of a Bulverde point in
Level 3.
BuZverde (Fig. 24E) The Bulverde point is not very common in
south Texas, being more characteristic of the Early Archaic in
central Texas (Hester 1980: 98). The pictured example from
square N19/E16 Level 4 was the only whole point of this type re­
covered at the C~ytka site. Two basal fragments that could be
cl assed as Bu.lverde came from Level 3, one near Feature 7. a
possible hearth. in N13/E12 and the other from square N16/E9.
Unidentified Projectile Points. Four arrow-point-size lithic
objects which are shaped more like Cody knives than arrow points
were recovered from the Chytka site. One came from the plow
zone in square N16/E16; the other three were found in natural
level 3 in various squares. These most closely resemble the
semi-notched arrow points recovered from the Kyle Site in central
Texas by Jelks (1962: 32), who suggests they represent an inter­
mediate stage between Granbury (blank notched biface) and
Sdallorn.

Other Lithics
Only 3.4% of all lithic artifacts recovered at the Chytka
site were projectile points. Other types of lithic artifacts
recovered are shown below. (In addition to the tools, 73 cores
and 1198 pieces of lithic debitage were recovered).

Had the site yielded more time discrete strata a more com­
plete pictoral inventory of the other tool types would be in
order. However, the disturbed nature of the site precludes any
conclusions as to which types of tools were associated with
which period of occupation.

59

Bone and Shell Art; facts
Artifacts recovered at the Chytka site included 126 bone
tools and 258 shell tools. These were most commonly encountered
in Zone 3 but were found both above and below this level. Again
the very mixed nature of the deposit precludes any conclusions
as to the time periods and cultures using different tool types,
but dates from burned bone suggest repeated occupation over a
long period in the Late Prehistoric.
Ninety-seven of the bones classified as tools were spirally
fractured splinters with a single point. On forty-two of these,
the point had an angle of more than 45° while fifty-five had
points of 45° or less. The majority of the other bone tools were
also spirally fractured long bones with multiple points. It is
possible that some of the spiral fractures may have been the
results of butchering for marrow removal rather than intentional
toolmaking. Most specimens. however, showed evidence of use as
tools.

SUMMARY
The PedernaZes point, typical of Central Texas, and two
radiocarbon dates between 1000 and 2000 Be refute the concept
of intrusions by outsiders or no occupations during the Middle
Archaic. It is unfortunate that what originally appeared to be
an undisturbed deep cultural deposit turned out to be extensively
disturbed. Additionally, the recovered artifacts and series of
radiocarbon assays support the sequential use of this site
throughout prehistory.
It is clear, however. that the location in a transition
zone between upland prairie and riverine flood plain and between
marine and freshwater zones allowed exploitation of all three
resource sets and made it a favored camp location over a very
long period. As pointed out by Mallouf. Fox and Briggs (1973:
114) deer remains indicate hunting in the flood plain woodlands,
while invertebrate bivalves of both brackish habitat (Rangia)
and freshwater habitat (QuadruZa) indicate the use of shellfish
of both zones as a secondary major food source. The bison bone
identified by Mallouf and others (1973) was not, however, con­
firmed by findings during the excavations reported here .

41JK178, THE OLSOYSKY SITE
The Olsovsky site, 41JK178, is in the northeastern portion
of Palmetto Bend Reservoir on Mustang Creek, just upstream and
across a dry tributary from the Chytka site, 41 JK66 (Jig. 1).
Both sites are within the bluff top forest plant community north
of Mustang Creek.
The Olsovsky site was recorded and later tested during Phase
II investigations at Palmetto Bend Reservoir (McGuff and Fawcett
1978: 20). Artifacts were collected from the southern portion of
the site which had been disturbed by prior earth remoyal and from
several backhoe trenches excavated as a testing procedure, The
Perdiz afrow points and bone-tempered ceramics noted during these
and later investigations suggested that the 01sovsky site held
some potential for the recovery of cultural material representatiye
of the Late Prehistoric Period.
.
EXCAVATION TECHNIQUES
41JK178 was the first site excavated during the Phase III
field season. Consequently, it served as a training ground for
the development of techniques used in all subse~uent excavations,
An 8 by 8 m. block was isolated by three backhoe trenches (Fig. 25)
and staked into 64 units 1 m. square. The grid coordinates of
the southwest corner were used to designate the unit. Vertical
control consisted of excavating all units by visible zones, All
fill was water screened througn 1/4 in. mesh .. Special columns,
32 cm. square or 10% of the unit volumetrically, were taken from
the southwest corner of each square and fine screened through both
1/4 and 1/16 in. mesh to aid in the recovery of botanical. faunal,
and cultural material. In all, 17.9 cubic meters of deposits were
excavated; the mean thickness of the cultural material was 0.28 m.
Three weeks, betw~en October 12 and November 4, 19]6, were expended
in the excavations at 41JK178.
.
SOILS AND STRATIGRAPHY
All of the cultural material recovered from 41JK1J8 was

Radiocarbon Dating
No samples suitable for radiocarbon assay were recovered
from this site although large quantities of charcoal were present.
The burning of recently cleared trees had resulted in the
deposition of modern charcoal throughout the area. None was
found in a secure archeological context.

FEATURES AND ARTIFACTS
The intent to excavate extensive areas of the Olsovsky site
to allow for spatial analysis of artifact distribution was largely
thwarted by the mixing of materials which resulted from clearing
of the site. The southern portion had been radically modified by
tree removal. The remnants of uprooted trees were found in the
excavation units (Fig. 27). A surface depression near the N13/E13
grid coordinate was excavated, exposing dumps and lenses of calcium
carbonate concretions pulled up when the trees were uprooted.
Wood charcoal was also concentrated in this area. A yellow-brown
lens of fine material found in the southwest corner of the
excavation block is either sawdust, decayed wood, or an ant nest.
Distributional maps were made of the historic, lithic and
ceramic artifacts. The densities of historic and lithic items
coincide, reflecting the mixture of materials of different ages.
The ceramic densfties are found in the extreme southern and northern
segments of the excavated block, perhaps as a result of displacement
by tree removal in the central part of the site.
Due to the disturbed nature of the Olsovsky site, the artifact
assemblage must be treated as a unit. The components of this
assemblage are li'sted in Table 10.

SUMMARY OF 41JK178, THE OLSOVSKY SITE
Phase III archeological investigations at 41JK178
established that the site had been severely disturbed by
recent land clearing, specifically by tree uprooting. However,
the artifact assemblage as a whole indicates that the site was
occupied during the Late Prehistoric Period. The remains of
more than one brief camp are suggested by the co-occurence of
sandy paste and bone-tempered pottery. The soil chemistry
analyses are not reflective of long-term use of the site for
habitation. This location had apparently been used on successive
occasions during the Late Prehistoric Period.

69

41JK31

THE DEAD GOAT SITE

41JK31 was first recorded as a prehistoric site during the
initial survey of the Palmetto Bend Reservoir area (Wakefield
1968: 8). The site lies south and west of the Navidad River
(Fig. 1) in an area to be inundated by the first stage of reser­
voir impoundment (ibid.). Testing of the site during Phase II
investigations isolated three components - one historic refuse
area destroyed by plowing, a central, shallow prehistoric deposit,
and a northern component of mixed historic and prehistoric age
(McGuff and Fawcett 1978). Wakefield (1968: Table 2) reported
only historic ceramics from the site; during Phase II, two sand­
tempered plainware sherds were collected from the surface, implying
a Late Prehistoric age for the prehistoric utilization of the area.
The northern component was considered to hold potential for the
recovery of ceramics, faunal remains, and lithics of that period
(McGuff and Fawcett 1978: 13) and was recommended for intensive
excavation. Soon after this, vegetation was bulldozed from the
upper portion of the reservoir, including the site area, exten­
sively damaging the shallow cultural deposits.
EXCAVATION TECHNIQUES
Phase III excavations were carried out over a three day
period from March 21 through 23. 1977. An 8 by 8 m. block on
the edge of the bluff above the Navidad River, in the area of
highest surface exposure of cul tural materia 1, was outl i ned by
three backhoe trenches (Fig. 28). Nine 1 by 1 m. units were
excavated in 10 cm. arbitrary levels and all fill was screened
through 1/41n. roes·h. Within each unit a special column, 32 cm.
square, was taken from the southwest corner and fine screened
through 1/16 in. window mesh to aid in the recovery of faunal,
botanical, and cul tural material (Tabl ell).
SOILS AND STRATIGRAPHY
The portion of the site south of the NIl grid line had
been cleared in the 1830's and subsequently plowed. The northern
portion of the site, once covered with bluff top forest, exhibits
a natural soil development of hard, firm, sticky clay with a
slight Hel reaction at the top, and a violent reaction increasing
with depth down the profile. The series of zones are: black
topsoil (A horizon); dense calcium carbonate and manganese
concretion gravels; white salt concentrates; and a red calcareous
clay (Fig. 29). Cultural materials were found only in the black
topsoil and concretion gravels which form the top 20 cm. of the
stratigraphic profile at the site.
Soil Chemistry
The chemical analysis of soils at the Dead Goat Site does
not reveal phosphate levels indicative of long-term aboriginal

Radiocarbon Dates
No samples suitable for radiocarbon assay were recovered
at 41JK31.
FEATURES AND ARTIFACTS
No features were recognized in the excavations at 41JK31.
Distributional maps of lithic density, based on a limited sample
of 55 items, indicate higher densities of debris in the center
of the excavated area between the E12 and E16 grid 1 ines, and
extending from the NIO to the N19 coordinates. One tool, a
thick unifacial scraper, and one core were recovered from the
southern end of this concentration. The remainder of the lithic
material consists of secondary and tertiary flakes and chips
(Table 11 ), an assemblage characteristic of sites in the upper
Navidad River (see Mallouf, Fox and Briggs 1973: 139). All
the lithic debris at 41JK31 is indicative of secondary reduction.
SUMMARY OF 41JK31
The artifact recovery from the Dead Goat Site is indicative
of a short-term, limited occupation of this campsite, datable to
the Late Prehistoric Period solely on the basis of two plainware
sherds collected from the site during the testing phase. Prior
modifications to the site area, primarily the bulldozing of
vegetation, in all probability affected the shallow cultural
deposit. However, plots of the density of lithic debris recovered
from the checkerboard of isolated units indicate a tendency for
the percentage of interior, multi-faceted flakes to increase in
the southern portion of the 8 by 8 m. block. It may be tentatively
concluded that these flakes and chips were the product of tool
use and resharpening. The recovery of only one core, one tool,
no primary flakes, and few secondary flakes is characteristic of
the sites in Palmetto Bend which are removed from primary lithic
resources (Mallouf, Fox and Briggs 1973).

74

REGIONAL/TEMPORAL INTEGRATION
The only major attempt at a general framework for the pre­
history of the upper Texas coast is Aten's 1979 dissertation.
Although his major focus was the Galveston Bay region rather than
the Matagorda Bay region, it seems most appropriate to relate the
information gained in excavations at Palmetto Bend to his general
regional framework.
As shown by Aten (1979:62) the Mustang Creek-lower Navidad
drainage was occupied by the Karankawa peoples in the eighteenth
and early nineteenth centuries. More specifically,the Cujane
tribe (Aten 1979:55; Bolton 1915:281), a subdivision of the Karan­
kawa, occupied the region during E~r.opean contact times. As noted
by Aten (1979:56) the Spanish sometimes used Cujane to designate
the language group of tribes as a whole, while the term Karankawa
and its variants is a development of the nineteenth century. The
origin of this group seems to have been from the Carribean language
groups via Central America in relatively recent centuries. The
evidence for origin of these tribes outside of Texas is, however,
quite limited and inconclusive (Aten 1979:57; Landar 1968; Mayhall
1939:345). Such ethnohistoric material on their culture as is
available has been summarized by Newcomb (1961:59-81). Although
we earlier noted Aten's use of Cujane as a tribal subdivision of
the larger Karankawa culture, it should be noted that Newcomb
(1961:70) states:
The small Karankawa bands were the largest social and
political grouping these people ever achieved. And while
there must have been considerable interchange between
bands - intermarriage, visiting and the like - it never
resulted in political units. Even a band's members were
frequently, perhaps normally, scattered into smaller family­
groups as they foraged by themselves.
EARLY ARCHEOLOGY
The Rockport Focus as defined by Campbell (1956, 1958a) and
Suhm, Krieger and Jelks (1954:125-127) seems to be clearly the
protohistoric remains of Karankawa occupations along the central
Texas coast. The Galveston Bay Focus (Suhm, Krieger and Jelks:
1954:128-130) seems to represent virtually the same lifeway, but
to be associated with the Akokisa tribe as defined by Aten. The
Coco, a Karankawa tribe or subgroup, occupied the territory between
these two groups around the mouth of the Brazos, an area not defined
as culturally distinct prior to Atents work.
ETHNOGRAPHY
As noted by Hester (1980:50), the Karankawa material culture
is not markedly distinguished from that of the Coahuiltecan groups

75

living south of Corpus Christi and inland. The chief differences
are (I) the use of marine shells for making tools and ornaments
and {2} the making of thin-walled asphalt-decorated pottery. Both
Karankawa and Coahuilteco lived in small bands of 30 to 40 people
and used smoke signals to draw these bands together for ceremonies
or to form war parties.
Perhaps another note on the reputed cannibalism of the Karan­
kawa is warranted. The popular image of these Indians is not
accurate. As pointed out by a number of authors (Newcomb 1~61:
78; Berlandier 1969:77; Hester 1980:51). the Karankawa practiced
ritual cannibalism for either magical purposes or as a sort of
ultimate revenge inflicted on a fallen enemy. It was the Karan­
kawa who were reported to have been shocked at the starving Spanish
survivors of the Narnaez expedition eating the bodies of their
dead shipmates (Hester 1980:50). These Spaniards, who were ship­
wrecked in 1528 on the Texas coast, found the Karankawa to be
generally friendly. Cabeza de Vaca's account of his adventures
among the coastal and inland peoples in the sixteenth century is
the earliest European account we have of the customs of these
Native Americans.
WORK AT PALMETTO BEND
As noted in the introduction to this volume, the propositions
addressed by McGuff (1978) in the Phase I and Phase II investiga­
tions at Palmetto Bend formed the basis of the general research
design for the Phase III investigations. These propositions will
be used to provide a framework for the discussion of the general
results and conclusions reached in the Phase III work.
Because our conclusions and observations do not specifically
agree in all respects with those set forth in Volume 3 of this
series (McGuff 1978:165-173}, some discussion of where the second
season's work confirmed earlier conclusions and where this volume
differs is in order. To allow the reader to compare the two direct­
ly, the format followed in that volume will be paralleled. That is,
the proposition will be given in italics followed by specific
comments on the evidence cited by McGuff. While this creates some
redundancy it seems essential for clarity. The first proposition
was stated by McGuff as:
ArcheologicaZ localities on this papt of the coast
ape the remains left by a non-sedentary hunting and
gathering people.

,

. . McGuff c?ncl~ded that the Rangia and other shellfish remains
lndlcated sprlngtlme occupation of the Palmetto Bend sites while
~ea t!out remains indicated a second occupation during the"aTi

Using the same criteria as McGuff. the evidence indicates that
the Chytka site, 41JK66, was a fall (October, November) camp site
and that the Olsovsky Road and Pratka sites, 41JK74 and 41JK53,
appear to have been favored for the early spring. No seasonal
statement seems possible for the other sites because the evidence
is lacking.
The average area of the five sites tested during 1974 and
1975 was 6845 square meters.
All but one were below 10.000 square
meters in extent. All of the sites tested in the field season
reported in this volume are quite small; the 1500-square-meter
Chytka site (41JK66) is the largest. This the evidence for the
truth of proposition one is even stronger now than it was for
McGuff: all the sites reported in this volume indicate brief
occupations by small hunter-gatherer bands. This first proposition
also agrees well with the band size reports assembled from the
ethnographic literature by Aten (1979:93-99) in which a camp of
perhaps 100 people was reported for the summer, and smaller fall
and winter bands were indicated.
McGuff isolated no features that could have functioned as
food storage facilities, but noted that pottery was visible,al­
though fairly rare, in the later deposits, and that baskets were
used, of which no evidence was likely to have survived. Our find­
ings agree well here. Except for an intrusive pit in the midden
at 41JK66, which we interpreted as a disposal pit, no features
other than isolated hearths were located during the Phase III field
season. A considerable amount of pottery was noted at four of the
sites, and a few sherds of bone-tempered ceramics at 41JK178 and
41JK163. The Chytka site, 41JK66, yielded only 69 sherds, and
41JK59 only a dozen. Two sites, 41JK53 and 41JK74, held no pottery
whatever in the portions we excavated.
With this evidence we cannot fully concur with McGuff's
concllJsion (1978:166) that "the storage of food against adversity
was unnecessary for the peoples involved," We found no more evi­
dence than McGuff but refuse to draw such strong conclusions from
the absence of basket and bag remnants. We would, however, note
that the burned mud dauber nests we found only at 41JK66 indicate
either gourmet tastes, or occasional lean times, for the occupants.
The second and third of McGuff's propositions are rather
more complex:
2) Before the Late Prehistoric~ coastal adaptation
concentrated principally on inland type resources . .
However~ in that adaptation coastal marine resources
were occasionally taken advantage of as p;rt of the
seasonal rounds. ------3) During the Transitional to the Late Prehistoric~
an explicitly coastal marine adaptation developed out
of a society with a coastal inland adaptation.
--,-------­

.
McGuff (1978:168-169) concluded that the data collected during
the Phase I field season could not be used either to refute or
support these propositions because of a supposed environmental

77

change about 2000 years ago that would have confused the picture.
This change, involving the formation of barrier islands across the
Matagorda Bay entrance, is supposed to have rendered the lower
reaches of the coastal streams less saline. Thus faunal remains
would appear to be of a more inland nature either because of changed
human collecting patterns or because the same collecting patterns
were applied to less saline streams. This compresses McGuff's
discussion at some risk to the finer points, but contains the
core of his conclusions.
It would seem that, unless one makes a great distinction
between the use of freshwater and saltwater shellfish, the evi­
dence obtained at the Chytka site largely refutes Propositions 2
and 3. To recapitulate, Quadrula shells were found in Level 4 of
41JK66 associated with two hearth features. The radiocarbon age
determinations from this level and the artifacts most generally
found there suggest a clearly Archaic context. Although fresh­
water shell remains were the predominant species, a number of
marine shellfish species were identified.
Thus, unless the very narrow meaning of coastal marine adap­
tation is insisted upon, we seem to see fairly clear evidence, at
least from the Chytka site, that the people who camped there were
quite familiar with both riverine and marine shellfish and used
both for food. Salt water species were also well represented in
the shell sample from 41JK53, the Pratka site, where the artifacts,
although rather sparse, also indicate Archaic occupation. The
Olsovsky site (41JK178) results, on the other hand, show generally
the same proportion of marine to freshwater shellfish species and
indications of only a Late Prehistoric occupation with both shell
tools and stone tools present. These results must, however, be
regarded as less than definitive because of the disturbed struc­
ture of the Olsovsky site. In summary, the findings from these
excavations indicate that coastal marine resource exploitation
was by all indications a practice of considerable antiquity and
not a development of only 2000 years ago as implied by McGuff.
Essentially the same comment must be applied to our findings
relative to the next two propositions. In spite of the fact that
our results are less than clear, there seem to be indications of
a relative stability of procurement systems and lifeways through­
out the record.
The fourth and fifth propositions considered by McGuff were:
4) Transitional to the Late ppehistopia and early"
Middle ppehietoria pepiod soaieties ppaatiaed an adaptive
strategy whiah was vapiable.
5) Late ppehistoria as well as middle and late Middle
ppehistopia aoastaZ inland soaieties praatiaed a

strategy.

Here the reader may encounter some difficulty with the chrono­
logical terms used in McGuff's original report. He chose to use

78

explicitly relative terms which roughly equated as follows to
the more common terms used in adjacent areas of Texas.

While the motive for using an explicitly relative series of
chronological terms to emphasize the very tentative chronology
established for the area of the upper Texas coast is excellent,
the resulting cumbersome terms seem a large price to pay, so this
scheme has been abandoned in this volume in favor of the more
common terminology. As was done at the beginning of this volume,
McGuff's propositions will be restated in terms of the conventional
chronology. Restated, (4) and (5) become:
4) During the early Arohaio and the transition from the
Arohaio to the Late Prehistorio~ a Zess stable adaptive
strategy was praotioed.
5) Middle and Late Arohaio as weZl as Late Prehistorio
aoastal populations praotioed a stable adaptive strategy,

McGuff (1978:170) concluded that the evidence for the repeated
use of the sites he tested was generally supportive of Proposition
5,
The unstable lifeway predicted in Proposition 4 could not be
detected in his data because
of the five sites tested one had little post-depositional
disturbance (at the Venom Hill site) and there the
excavation techniques were too little refined for a clear
picture of what may be a Transitional to the Late Prehis­
toric midden deposit (McGUff 1978:169).
The evidence from the Phase II field season is of essentially
the same general type. We had initially hoped that the Chytka
site (41JK66) would prove to be finely enough stratified to offer
some distinct evidence along these lines. As the reader will have
noted in the account of that site given above, the radiocarbon
results suggested rather more post-depositional disturbance than
was immediately apparent to the excavator. However, we recovered
a sUbstantial number of SoaZZorn arrow points at that site as well
as a number of points characteristic of the Late Archaic and trans­
itional period.
To recapitulate the evidence of the transitional period, the

79

following dart point types were recovered from Level 3 at the
Chytka site: Darl~ Ellis~ and Ensor (Fig. 23 J, F through I, M
and N). The Darl point type is generally held to be character­
istic of the transitional period (Hester 1980:97). The Ellis
type is known in South Texas in late Archaic contexts and may
have survived as a recognizable form through the transitional
per i 0 din tot h e La t e Pre his tor i c ( 0 p. cit.: 101 ) . The En s 0 r
point type has a very similar Late Archaic to transitional
osition. All of this, plus the general span of dates obtained
from Level 3 at the Chytka site, clearly indicate that the site
was occupied during the supposed uns table lifeway period be­
tween the late Prehistoric and Late Archaic. We cannot, how­
ever, suggest that we can cleanly seperate the stratum deposited
during that time period from all alse in the site and thus examine
the evidence for procurement in a separate, relatively pure,
context. As above, the best supported inference from the evidence
at hand is that of a long term stability of human subsistence
adaptation throughout this time span.
Two of the sites excavated presented indications of having
been occupied during the Early Archaic which was also supposed
to have been a period of unstable adaptive strategy. Specifically,
41JK163, the Little Rise site, contained artifacts diagnostic of
the Late Paleoindian and subsequent transitional periods. There
were also indications of an occupation of this period at the
School House Site, 41JK59. The evidence at hand from these two
sites again indicates a long term continuum in subsistence strategy
rather than periods of instability. We cannot, however, differen­
tiate strata sufficiently to explicitly refute either proposition.
lI

ll

The continuity we see may be a secondary effect of the mixing of
archeological materials of various ages giving the appearance of
homogeneity.

The next of McGuff's (1978:170-171) propositions and conclu­
sions is subject to some of the same general comments as to the
inadequacy of the evidence either to confirm or conclusively
refute the hypothesis. This proposition reads
6)
On the coastal inland during the Late Prehistoric
and middle and late Middle Prehistoric periods
lived
nomadic hunters and gatherers who were significantly
unlike present examples of that type of society in
temperate climates.

In the discussion McGuff asserts that IIEvidence was found
that strongly suggests significant differences ... 11 We find it
difficult to support McGuff in this assertion. First, the field
evidence outlined above fails to meet any of the three specific
criteria we would expect. We found no evidence of warfare, al­
though there is ethnographic evidence of extended conflict among
Karankawa groups in the historic period. Second, the evidence
cited by McGuff for greater use of fishing facilities than would

80

be expected in a present day hunter-gather lifeway, seems equally
consistent with the use of nets or other fishing paraphernalia
which have not survived. We have seen no evidence other that the
remains of fish which McGuff presumes to be too small to have been
caught on a hook. We cannot follow him to his conclusion that
this implies the use of fish weirs or other such facilities. The
evidence of non-flexible small territories which would provide
the third type of evidence seems to us to be lacking as well.
Aten (1979:90ff) has done an extensive review of the literature
and attempted to reconstruct historic populations in each terri­
tory from Galveston Bay to Matagorda Bay. He takes the seventeenth
century as a "population zenith for the upper Texas coast, there
being no evidence to suggest larger populations earlier," Cop.
cit. : 91).
.
McGuff's next proposition is somewhat related to the above:
7) Duping the middle and late Middleppehistopic and
Late ppehistopic pepiods but peaching a climax in
the Late Middle ppehistopic inland hunteps and gathepeps
developed a stpuctupe that included social stpatification.

MCGuff (1978:171-172) concluded that the evidence from Phase I
excavations· was not sufficient to either confirm or disprove this
proposition. The archeological evidence commonly used to infer
social stratification at this subsistence level ~ differential
burial goods, exotic materials caches and elaborate fixed factli­
ties - are not present in any of tne excavations outlined above
either. Aten's (1979:137ff1 discussion of social organization of
the Texas coastal tribes suggests that in historic times the Karan­
kawa had hereditary chiefs, perhaps ad hoc war chiefs, shaman and
several other recognized social roles that carried some special
status. Aten states that a minimum of 18 such statuses are poten­
tially recognizable in the archeological record, but aside from
the possible inherited headmanship among the Karankawa "there is
still no indication of ranking within these sodalities" (Aten
1979:153).
McGuffls (1978:1]2l eighth research proposition is more in
line with the evidence presented above,
8) Fpom the middle OP eaply Middle ppehistopic pepiods
until late in the Late ppehistopic pepiod the same
peopZes occupied the Centpal Texas Gulf Coastal inland.
Outside gpoups did not make that area part of their
teppitories.

In his discussion McGuff considers that the evidence of the
first field season generally supported this hypothesis. As noted
above, the evidence from tne Phase III field season also strongly
supports this proposition. Indeed, the evidence from the School
House Site (41JK59} and the Little Rise Site (41JK163] suggests
that there may exist a cultural continuity for the coastal adapta­

81

tion extending to Paleoindian times. While the other inform~­
tion obtained during the Phase III field season is very much
like the evidence examined by Aten and other earlier investiga­
tors along the Texas coast, the evidence of occupation during
and before the Middle Archaic is perhaps the principal contribu­
tion of this investigation to the archeological record.
To quote from Aten~s (1979:451) exhaustive integrative
study of the archeology of the upper Texas coast
Although no Paleo-Indian and Early Archaic sites are
known from the upper coast, projectile points typical
of these times have been found quite infrequently;
Middle Archaic artifacts have not been found at all;
and the Late Archaic is largely represented by the
numerous preceramic shell middens reflecting movement
of the coastal zone inland to its present location.
The Chytka site (41JK66) contained both radiocarbon-dated
material and projectile points diagnostic of the Middle Archaic.
It is, however. interesting to note that 3860 + 370 B.P. was the
earliest radiocarbon date obtained from the Ch~tka site, or for
that matter, any of the sites investigated during the Phase III
work. This date is certainly post-Altithermal (Weir 1976:28;
Aten 1979:451). Aten's observation that coastal populations
may have been significantly smaller during the Altitherma1 may be
quite correct.
The apparent deflation and subsequent reburial of soil pro­
files at the School House and Little Rise sites would tend to
support the view of the coastal habitat as somewhat grim and
forbidding during the Altitherma1 period, which is generall~
date& at ~bout 7000 to 45QO B.C.
Noting that any conclusion based on the absence of data to
the contrary is not logically sound, nevertheless the results of
the Phase III field season tend to support Aten's general view
of reduced populations during the Altithermal and to lend further
support to McGuff's eighth proposition regarding long term cultur­
al continuity on the coast. The ninth and final of McGuff's
propositions addresses a possible break in that cultural continuity.
9) A group or groups of peoples from outside the coastal
inland began late in the Late Prehistoric period to
include portions of the coastal inland in their exploitive
range.

In the Phase I report McGuff discovered an assemblage at
During the
Phase III excavations no such assemblage was identified, thus we
can neither support McGuff's partial substantiation of this propo­
sition nor refute it, based on the evidence obtained. We might,
however, comment that Aten's reconstruction of the distribution
of native groups on the upper Texas coast in early historic times
(Aten 1979:62, 67) suggests that except for some intrusive Tonkawa
41JK91 that was suggestive of a Plains-type camp.

82

encampments near Edna circa 1829, no one seriously challenged
the Karankawa for the coastal territory.
SUMMARY
The bulk of our evidence points to long term stability of
an apparently successful lifeway similar to that recorded in
early historic times for the Karankawa. Rigid scheduling and
regular reoccupation of favorable campsites over very long periods
of time are richly demonstrated. There is some evidence that the
fashioning of tools from stone and shell changed somewhat from
time to time, but no abrupt changes were noted in the sites we
excavated. As a general matter we find ourselves more inclined
to see evidence as pointing to the general validity of the ethno­
graphic record as it exists. Thus the rather sweeping rejection
of the previous ethnographic work made by McGuff (1978:14) seems
to us to be at least premature, although his discussion of ethno­
graphic considerations remains largely valid.
Perhaps the sing1emost significant addition to our knowledge
of the Lower Navidad River area and its past is our finding that
the coastal inland lifeway had its origins by the Middle Archaic
and may indeed have begun in late Paleoindian times. Here our
information on subsistence is too poor to allow firm conclusions,
but at least the same localities were occupied.

APPENDIX I
INTRODUCTION
As a part of the National Park Service Inundation Study,
soil samples from Palmetto Bend Reservoir were analyzed for
pH, phosphorous, potassium, sodium, calcium, and magnesium.
Preliminary studies had indicated altered relationships in
the amounts of present soil components. Soil chemical analysis
was therefore incorporated into the research design of the
Inundation Study, and it was hypothesized that the measurement
of present soil components constituted variables relevant to
determining the effects of inundation upon archeological sites.
The analysis was limited to those determinations mentioned
above. The total amount, i.e. both the inorganic and organic
forms of each element was determined by means of highly accurate
methods.
METHODOLOGICAL CONSIDERATIONS
that:

In the National Park Service research design it is stated
Chemical remains are a fragile part of the archeo­
logical record and would appear to be capable of
severe distortion and even obliteration under the
impact of immersion by freshwater. Leaching, changing
the pH of the surrounding medium and other changes
in the environment of soils exposed to immersion
will all apparently contribute to a complex of
factors that can alter the chemical traces which are
part of the information content of an archeological
site.

The basic assumption has been made, without confirming data, that
inundation does alter the relationships between chemical elements.
Building upon studies by Eddy and Dregne (1964), Lenihan et at.
(1911), and McIntyre (1911), it is further assumed that inundation
causes a decrease or total disappearance of parts of or whole
amounts of elements present prior to inundation.
The testing procedures as outlined in the Inundation Study
research deSign require some discussion. The two applications
of soil analysis on Palmetto Bend Reservoir samples include:
a) intra-site patterns of surface chemical variability, and
b) patterns of chemi~al variability of features.

94

It is further said that:
If we cannot define meaningful patterns on an
uninundated site, we cannot expect to find them on
inundated sites. On the other hand, if patterns
can be discerned on a control site we are in a
position to evaluate the results of analysis on
the inundated sites.
To evaluate the impact of inundation, one uninundated site was
chosen, to which data from other inundated sites were to be com­
pared, the question of inundation or not is answered with lIyes
if the meaningful patterns of the control site are not found on
the inundated sites.
It is unclear what is meant by IImeaningful pattern refer­
ring to the chemical characteristics of the control site. Any
pattern of horizontal or vertical chemical variability must be
considered as being meaningful or significant. No sites exist
with totally identical chemical characteristics, and one might
say, that the patterned chemical variability, either horizontal
or vertical. is as unique as a fingerprint. There do not exist
two identical fingerprints. and neither do there exist, chemically
speaking, two identical sites. The difference in chemical char­
acteristics are, for uninundated sites, always related to human
behavior: a unique behavior for each site. Except within ex­
tremely broad limits we are not at the present able to classify
sites solely on the basis of soil chemical characteristics. Thus,
one uninundated site cannot be used as a controlling medium, be­
cause the soil chemical components of that specific site consti­
tute a unique case. Furthermore, comparisons between sites will
not tell us about effects of inundation. The chemical changes
occurring as a result of human activities must be assumed to be
much greater than changes resulting from inundation, i.e. if the
incoming reservoir water is not heavily polluted. In summary,
only by comparing chemical results from analysis of same samples
with exactly identical provenience prior to and after inundation,
a knowledge of the kind and amount of chemical pollutants in the
water, and with highly accurate analytical procedures, will it
be possible to reach conclusions concerning the effects of inun­
dation (cf. Garrison 1977: 154).
A complex series of events is involved in the transformation
from a dry to a wet environment. The introduction of permanent
water coverage greatly increases the number of interactive pro­
cesses, many of which are dependent upon the chemical properties
of the incoming water. It is suggested that the following proposed
sampling design will work as a model in future long-term studies
of soil chemical alteration on inundated cultural resources:

We cannot compare uninundated sites with inundated to reach
conclusions concerning the effects of inundation. but inter- and
intra-site relationships can be investigated. There is no doubt
that the chemical variance on an uninundated archeological site
will show a meaningful pattern. This fact underlies the discussion
below.
A meaningful pattern is here defined as the inter- or intra­
site archeologically significant patterning of amounts of soil
chemical components. The ultimate effect of inundation is under­
stood as the loss of the meaningful pattern.
No archeologicallv significant effects of inundation is the
case when the chemical variance in an intra-site context is pre­
served, i.e. whether an increase or decrease has occurred, the
relative difference in amounts of soil components is preserved.
On the other hand. effects on archeologically significant data
occur when: 1) there is an increase or decrease in the amounts
of one or several. but not all. of the soil chemical components
in an intra-site context; when 2) intra-site chemical distinction
in relation to the environment is decreased or lost; and when
3) intra-site chemical variance is decreased or lost.

HYPOTHESES AND BASIC CHEMICAL DATA
pH
According to the NPS research design the following tentative
effects of inundation are presented:
the pH value of the soil will change to match that of
the water;
the pH level of the soil will become more acidic in
inundated sites;
inundation by basic water should raise the pH level, and
if the sediments s after inundation, were truly acidic
(pH less than 7.0), preservation would be less favorable to
bone recovery.
Based upon these test implications, it is hypothesized that:
"Absolute pH values will be altered by inundation, but
should still yield relative pH values useful for archeological
research. In a loosely compacted soil stratum, pH values
will approach the reservoir pH, if this stratum does not lie
below a compact soil stratum."
A soil solution is soil water. in which ionic forms of plant
nutrients have been dissolved. The pH value is the expression for
the concentration of hydrogen (H) ions over hydroxul (OH) ions.
A soil solution is characterized as acid, neutral, or alkaline
(basic) dependent upon the relationship between Hand OH ions.
In a neutral soil solution, (pH equal to 7.0), the relationship
of Hand OH ions is balanced and the number of Hand OH ions equal.
In an acidic soil solution (pH less than 7.0) the H ions are domi­
nant, and in an alkaline soil solution (pH greater than 7.0) the
OH ions are dominant. There is a mutually inverse relationship
in the balance between Hand OH ions.
The term basic refers to alkalinity, i.e. to a high degree
of base saturation in the soil. Saturation is defined as the
process or condition of dissolving in a solvent all of a solute
that the solvent can absorb, under equilibrium conditions and at
a given temperature. Alkalinity implies a relatively high degree
of base saturati~n. Processes including equilibrium maintenance
or increase of exchangeable bases such as calcium, magnesium,
potassium, and sodium, gives a preponderance of OH ions over H
ions in the soil solution, i.e. a reduction in acidity and an
increase in alkalinity. When a strong base and a weak acid, for
example sodium carbonate (Na 2 C0 3 ) go into solution, hydrolysis
takes place (a chemical reaction in which water reacts with
another substance to form two or more new substances, which involves
ionization of the water molecule as well as splitting of the

98

compound hydrolyzed) and alkalinity is developed.
is as follows:

The reaction

2Na+ + C03-- + 2HOI-{-« ... 2Na+ + 20H- + H2C03
The dissociation of the sodium hydroxide (NaOH) is greater than
that of the weak carbonic acid (H 2 C0 3 ). and therefore the OH ions
will dominate the result. An identical reaction concerns the
dissociation of potassium carbonate (K 2 C0 3 ) and of magnesium
carbonate (MgC0 3 ).
The factors forming acidity are organic decay. microbial
action. and podzolization. The decomposition process of organic
matter forms both organic and inorganic acids. Most common of
the organic acids is carbonic acid. H2C03' resulting from a
reaction of carbon dioxide and water. H2 CO 3 dissolves calcium
carbonate (CaC0 3 ) in soil minerals. Strongly acid environments
are the result of stronger organic acids. such as sulphuric acid
(H 2S0 4 ) and nitric acid (HN0 3 ). which are formed both through
organlc decay processes and from microbial actions on fertilizer
materials (sulfur and ammonium sulfate). Strong organic acids
are also formed by podzol;zation. defined as the movement of clays
and sesquioxides down the soil profile and their deposition in
the B horizon. Acidity can also occur through leaching in drainage
waters, by which those metallic cations that could compete with
hydrogen and aluminum on the exchange complex are removed.
. A basic or alkaline environment is the result of any process
which maintains or irlcreases the amounts of the exchangeable bases
such as calcium, potassium. sodium, and magnesium. Weathering
processes releasing exchangeable cations from minerals and pro­
ducing ability to be absorbed increases the number of hydroxyl
ions. An addition of limestone causes alkalinity. Salts contain­
ing irrigation water can produce significantly increased soil
alkalinity.
In addition to the reasons mentioned above, there are other
factors, which are relevant to the varying decreased or increased
hydrogen ion concentration. An increased acidity is the product
of acid organiC matter, for example leafmold, pine needles, tan­
bark, saWdust, and moss peat. The presence of chemicals. especially
ferrous sulfate will develop sulphuric acid by hydrolysis, result­
ing in a drastically lowered pH value. The presence of sulfur
will have the same effect. A soil sample preparation including
oven drying often causes an increase in acidity. Samples collected
during summer time when acid producing micro-organisms are abundant
will be more acid than samples collected during winter or spring.
An increase of alkalinity or decrease of acidity is agri­
culturany produced through liming (agricultu-ral limes are oxides,
hydroxides, carbonates of calcium and magnesium). The place of
released hydrogen is, in moderately acid and neutral to alkaline
soils, taken by calcium and magnesium bases. A soil dominated by
sodium saturation has a much higher pH value than a soil dominated
by calcium and magnesium. A ratio of present calcium. magnesium,

99

potassium. and sodium of 4:1:1:9 would mean a higher pH value than
if the ratio were 10:3:1 :1. For example. the presence of shellfish
containing calcium carbonate (CaC0 3 ) would result in a decrease
a f a c i d i ty .
Finally. variation of the pH value of samples taken only a
few centimeters from each other may be the result of local micro­
bial action and an uneven distribution of organic matter in the
so i 1 .
PHOSPHORUS
The suggested effects on amounts of present phosphorus are.
as outlined in the NPS design, the following:
phosphorus, which as calcium phosphate is the principal
component of bone, is water soluble, and
phosphorus in flooded areas in changed into phosphine and
disperses.
The following was hypothesized:
"Samples taken for soil-phosphate analysis after site inun­
dation, but relative differences between samples will remain
unthanged. Where ferro-phosphate compounds are formed in
loose soils, such as sandy loams, phosphates will be lost
unless replenished with phosphate from bone apatite, e.g.,
over a cemetary."
The accuracy level of the method of analysis used ranges be­
tween 95-98% recovery. The method extracts total phosphorus,
i.e .• both organic and inorganic phosphorus compounds . .
In organic compounds are a) those containing calcium, and
b) those containing iron and aluminum. Organic compounds are,
among others. a) phytin and phytin derivates, b) nucleic acids.
and c) phospholipids. The solubility of inorganic calcium com­
pounds increases with the increased simplicity of the compound.
but the simpler compounds are available in very small quantities
and they easily revert into insoluble states.
The fixation of added phosphates t when the pH value is in
the range of a little less than 8.0 to 8.5, is mostly in the
form of calcium phosphates.
In alkaline soils t phosphates will react with the calcium
ion and with calcium carbonate. The next step includes a con­
version of the calcium phosphate (Ca (P0 4 )2) to insoluble compounds.
such as hydroxYt oXYt carbonate t and 3 fluorapatite (insoluble apa­
tite compounds are formed at pH levels of above 7.0) compounds,
the latter being the most insoluble compound known. An excessive
amount of calcium carbonate (CaC0 3 ) produces very insoluble com­
pounds.
At a pH level of between 6.0 and 7.0 the fixation is at its

100

minimum.
It is not within the scope of this paper to fully describe
the extremely complex and incompletely investigated phosphorus
cycle. The behavior of phosphorus in water systems will be dis­
cussed in the interpretive section.
POTASSIUM
The following assumptions are made in the NPS research design
concerning the effects of inundation on amounts of potassium:
potassium is likely to be leached downward upon inundation,
and
the potassium level in the flooded area ;s much lower than
the unflooded area, and it is probably being washed out.
On these assumptions it is hypothesized that:
"Site inundation will wash out potassium salts from the upper
strata of a site, but should not affect the potential analysis
of potassium values below those levels saturated by lake water.1I
Sandy soils are comparatively low in amounts of total potas­
sium. The unavailability of potassium to higher plants is similar
to the phosphorus situation, but unlike phosphorus much of potas­
sium is lost by leaching. Relatively unavailable forms (feldspars,
micas, etc.) constitute 90-98% of total potassium; slowly available
potassium (nonexchangeable, fixed) is 1-10% of total potassium,
and relatively available potassium (exchangeable and solution) in
the soil is 1-2% of all potassium. These figures are based on the
situation in an average mineral soil.
Four factors are known to govern the potassium fixation in
the soil:

The nature of the soil colloids. Vermiculite and illite
clays readily fix potassium in large amounts,

freezing and thawing, which results in the release of fixed
potassium, and
the presence of excess lime. Well-limed soils fix potassium
better than acid soils. It has been shown that potassium
deficiency is the result of the presence of excess calcium
carbonate (CaC0 3 ).
The amount of potassium lost annually by leaching and erosion
greater than losses of nitrogen and phosphorus, but mostly not
great as losses of calcium and magnesium.

101

SODIUM
Analysis of sodium was initially not included in the NPS
research design.
Sodium is essential to higher animals in regulating the
composition of their body fluids, and to some marine organisms,
but it is dispensible for many bacteria and most plants, except
for the blue-green algae (i .e., the fresh water algae).
The accumulation of neutral soluble salts, such as sodium,
calcium, and magnesium chlorides and sulfates, is caused by
impeded drainage of arid region soils. The products are exces­
sive surface evaporation and an accumulation of the soluble
salts in the surface horizon (cf. salinization). If these sol­
uble salts are dominating, only a small amount of exchangeable
sodium is present. The soil is classified as saline and has a
pH value usually below 8.5. The soluble salts can easily be
leached out in saline soils. This is, agriculturally, done
through eradication, i.e., heavy and repeated applications of
water (low in sodium), which dissolves the salts and carries
them off through tile drains. This method works especially well
with saline soils, where salts are high in calcium and magnesium.
Fresh waters contain small and variable amounts of sodium
and potassium. usually in the ratio of from 1:1 to 4:1.
CALCIUM AND MAGNESIUM
High amounts of calcium present at an inundated site were
suggested in the NPS research design to be the result of the
disintegration of the shell and bone that had previously been
present in the site soil.
The calcium and magnesium components of a soil system are
integrated in a very complex way. Therefore, only relationships
and processes relevant to effects of inundation are discussed.
Calcium and magnesium are macronutrients, i.e., they are
used in relatively large quantities by plants. In agriculture,
they are added to acid soils in limestone and are called lime
elements. Much of present soil calcium and magnesium are held
on the surfaces of the colloids as adsorbed cations. Cations are
easily released to the soil solution by exchanging with other
positively charged ions, hence, the term lI exc hangeable cations ll •
Assuming that hydrogen from an ocid such as carbonic acid replaces
calcium from the soil colloids, the general reaction for calcium
is as follows:
Ca

Colloidal

Much of the calcium becomes mobile through this reaction. The
cation exchange replacement occurs very easily and rapidly.
Therefore, soils which contain considerably more total potassium
than total calcium release the calcium to the soil solution and
to leaching much more generously. The same reaction serves for
transfer of magnesium.
When exchangeable calcium and magnesium are lost by leach­
ing, the pH value should gradually decrease. In arid regions
there should be a general relationship between soil pH and
exchangeable calcium and magnesium, except in cases when a large
amount of sodium is adsorbed. Arid region soils lack extensive
leaching because of low precipitation, and leave the base status
of these soils high, i.e., high amounts of potassium, sodium,
calcium, and magnesium should be present. A normal soil should
have an accumulation of calcium carbonate somewhere in the pro­
file. The drier the climate, the closer to the surface this
accumulation will be placed in the soil profile.
Calcium and magnesium are lost in three ways: 1) by ero­
sion; 2) by crop removal, and 3) by leaching. Loss of calcium
is greater than loss of magnesium. This is because there is
always a larger amount of calcium present in an exchangeable
condition. Because liming material contains more calcium than
magnesium, this loss ratio will generally be maintained. A low
precipitation produces an upward movement and evaporation of
water resulting in the accumulation of salts at the soil surface,
and because these bases dominate the adsorption, a pH value
of 7.0 and above will result.
(Note:
1974.)

This chapter has been based mainly on data from Brady,
INTERPRETATION

The reader should have in mind that the interpretations
are made with the use of the "control-site approach," and that
their validity is seriously affected by this circumstance.
Although certain relationships seem to exist, their presence
could be totally incidental because of the large number of non­
controllable variables of the H con trol-sfte approach" (i.e.,
variation in human behavior and lack of information of water
chemistry, etc., as outl ined in t~e proposed sampling design).
If the suggested sampling model were followed, there would not
be any doubts about the validity of the interpretation because
non-controllable variables would have been eliminated. In
spite of this, the author is of the opinion that, because of
sample size, fitness of data to models of environmental change
due to pollution, and the general trend in the comparison of
an inundated and an uninundated archeological environment, the
results can partially be considered as representative.
Further, the assumptions made in the NPS research design
apparently were built upon the analysis done on four samples

103

(two from inundated and two from uninundated proveniences)
from a Chesbro Reservoir site (4SCL52). Four samples, two from
each environment, are most certainly not a sample large enough
to reach any conclusions. In addition, the con trol-site
approach," and simple incorrectness concerning the solubility
of phosphorus (phosphine) gave rise to assumptions not at all
related to the real situation. (Data on phosphine from chemi­
cal dictionary: phosphine;s soluble in alcohol, ether and
cuprous chloride; slightly soluble in cold water; insoluble in
hot water. It is very unlikely that, if phosphorus actually
were transferred into phosphine, it would be dispersing.)
Because no explanatory models of an archeological nature
and no comparative studies exist, it becomes extremely difficult
to reach conclusions from the present analysis. Except for
phosphorus, there are no explanatory models which could be used.
The situation is thus one involving extreme interpretative
difficulties: the data as such could be characterized as non­
usuable because of the "control-site approach." The general
trends in the data could be of incidental nature, and because
the chemistry involved in inundation has not previously been
investigated, we do not know what is actually taking place.
II

pH
There does not seem to be any distinct change of the pH
value in either direction. A minimal trend towards a slightly
more alkaline environment is noticeable. The range of pH varies
from slightly to moderately alkaline, both prior to and after
inundation. Smaller differences in pH cannot be said to be a
result of inundation (see above, p.98). At a pH level of over
8.0 the exchangeable bases predominate, which ;s seen in the
data by the relatively large amounts of salts, especially po­
tassium and calcium t in both environments. A lowering of the
pH level would mean stable and sociated hydrogen, but an increas­
ing pH level would mean dissociated hydrogen with a negative
charge on the colloid, recharged by metallic cations. The
relationship in mineral soils between pH on the one hand and
microorganism activities and availability of plant nutrients on
the other indicates that at a pH level of around B.5 only the
availability of phosphorus is decreasing.
Mullins (1977:376) reports that the pH level in natural
systems ranges between 7.0-B.5. and that the main species in
solution is the bicarbonate ion, which most easily makes carbon
available to aquatic organisms. If the pH level is drastically
changed, the.result is a depletion of carbon and disappearance
of microorganisms from the area.
pH ON SITES IN THE PALMETTO BEND RESERVOIR AREA
In the accompanying contextual data from the Pratka site
(41JK53) it was assumed that the soil pH level was very basic,

104

containing large quantities of carbonates. This assumption was
verified: there is an increasing alkalinity with depth, and
a pH range of nearly neutral to slightly alkaline (7.04-7.82).
At the Olsovsky Road site (41 JK 74) the expectations were
also met by the analysis: down to a depth of 75 cm. the pH
level changes from slightly alkaline to moderately alkaline.
Also at the Little Rise site (41 JK 63) the assumptions were
verified: the acidity increases with increased depth, but the
entire soil column still remains slightly alkaline. At the
Olsovsky site (41 JK 178) the soil varies between slightly acidic
and slightly alkaline with increased depth. Contrary to the
expectations. the two soil samples from the Sutherland Plantation
site (41 JK 33) are both slightly alkaline.
At the Dead Goat Site(41 JK 31) the pH level becomes more
alkaline with increased depth. Still the soil column in char­
acterized as slightly alkaline. Instead of being acidic, the
soil at the School House site (41 ~IK 59) is slightly and close
to moderately alkaline. Finally, at the Chytka site (41 JK 66)
both soil columns are slightly alkaline, and a slight trend
towards greater alkalinity and acidity respectively is noticeable.
Phosphorus
The representative percentage of phosphorus in an acid
region mineral surface soil is reported by Brady (1974: 24;
Table 2:3) to be 0.07% (700 ppm). Stream water normally contains
20 parts per billion or 0.02 ppm phosphorus (Garrels et at.
1975: 34; Table 5). Except for a few samples from features, the
level of 700 ppm is not reached by the majority of the samples.
In fact, the amounts of present phosphorus are extremely low in
both the uninundated and inundated environment.
The tendency for phosphorus to increase and to even out
slightly is the only effect, so far, of inundation that can be
lIexplained li .
Eutrophication refers to the enrichment of water by plant
nutrients. The term means IIwell-nourishedli. The nutrients of
most importance are nitrogen, carbon, and phosphorus, but it is
still not known whether lower phosphate levels in natural waters
will result in slowing down the eutrophication process (Stoker
and Seager 1977: 425).
The question whether carbon or phosphorus is the main cause
of eutrophication has turned into a controversy_ The carbon group
believes that the sediment is a vast reservoir of phosphorus,
that all the phosphorus is available, and that increases or de­
creases in phosphate concentrations have no effect on algal
growth. The phosphorus group believes that the sediment is a
sink rather than a source, and that phosphate concentration is
directly related to algal growth. If pnosphorus and carbon are
available in excess, then nitrate becomes the growth limiting

105

nutrient, but since phosphorus has a limited sphere of cycling,
the sedimentation effect is a controlling factor. Schindler
et aZ. (1973) reported from a lake system that 80% of incoming
phosphorus was sedimented and that no return was noted. Upchurch
et aZ. (1974) showed that availability of phosphorus from sedi­
ments decreased from the fresher water to the saltier water, and
that this decrease related closely to the quantity of iron
present. Williams et aZ. (1970) reports that calcareous lake
sediments will absorb and retain less added phosphorus than non­
calcareous lake sediments, and they also show that the ability
of a sediment to absorb added phosphorus decreases with an in­
crease in the phosphorus concentration (Mullins 1977: 382-384),
With this background data in mind, we look at Palmetto Bend
Reservoir. It seems possible to compare the reservoir with a
fresh water lake system. though the situations are not identical.
1. There is no doubt that aquatic phosphorus is coming
into the reservoir, either carried by streams or through erosion
from agricultural lands surrounding the reservoir. Even erosion
and transportation of phosphorus from historic agriculture to
the deposition in the original stream bed 150 years ago could be
of importance (irrigation water carried phosphorus).
2. Being a fresh water system the availability of phosphorus
to organisms should be advantageous.
3. The calcareous sediments of Palmetto Bend Reservoir
would absorb and retain less added phosphorus t but
4. More important, if increased phosphorus toncentrations
were present (= archeological sites, or single high peaks within
a site), less absorption would occur in those areas, meaning that
the increase would concentrate in areas low in sedimented
phosphorus.
Mullins (1977: 384) states that as the concentration of
phosphates in the water increases, the total amount absorbed by
sedimentation decreases. In this way the water system phosphates
could be steadily increasing. causing eutrophication.
Potassium, Sodium, Calcium, and Magnesium
No comparative or explanatory data are available relating
to these elements.
For all, except sodium, there is a trend towards greater
amounts. But again, this can be purely incidental.
The presence of large amounts of calcium and magnesium on
the surface is due to what is said above concerning low precipi­
tation in arid climates. Not much sodium seems to be absorbed.
Calcium, in addition, forms very complex, insoluble compounds
at pH values over 7.5 (cf. Cook and Heizer 1965: 19).

106

POTASSIUM, SODIUM, CALCIUM, AND MAGNESIUM
ON SITES IN THE PALMETTO BEND RESERVOIR AREA
There is not doubt that the variability of potassium,.§odium,
and calcium is culturally significant, but whether or not magnesium
is a suitable element in future analysis is questionable.
An archeologfcally meaningful pattern of potassium obtains
on all sites except 41 JK 33. More significant are the results
of the calcium analysis, especially on ~1 JK 74, 1n which calcium
(sample #8-10) undoubtedly is the result of an animal food diet.
The same would also apply to sites 41 JK 53 (sample #3 and #4)
and 41 JK 66 (sample #34, #40, and #41).

GRAIN SIZE DISTRIBUTION ANALYSIS OF DEPOSITS IN THE
PALMETTO BEND RESERVOIR AREA
(The weight of samples #6 and #38 was less than 100 g. due
to container breakage during mailing, and they were therefore
not processed).

41 JK 53
A suitable way of illustrating a stratigraphic series is
shown by the example on the following page. It is not a very
exact graph, but it shows the trend in the size distribution.
For further information concerning ways of illustrating particle
size analysis results consult Shackley (1975: 91-99).
A trend is noticeable from a dominance of very fine sand to
fine gravel, medium, and fine sand with depth. The content of
clay and silt is relatively stable with increased depth.

41 JK ]4
The distribution of grain sizes is stable with depth: fine
sand dominates except for the 65-75 cm level ~ in which coarse
particles are more abundant, The clay content is staole with
depth.

41 JK 63 AND 41 JK 1]8
Fine to very fine sand are th~ dominant sizes through the
profile with a slightly decreasing tendency. In contrast to the

two sites above, the clay content on 41 JK 163 is high (50-60%).
As was the case on 41 JK 53, coarse particles are more abundant
with depth on both sites.

41 JK 33, 41 JK 31, AND 41 JK 59
41 JK 33 has an abundance of coarse and fine clay particles.
At 41 JK 31 this relationship is particularly noticeable, where
coarse and medium sand dominate the presence of both fine sand
and clay particles. At 41 JK 59 fine to very fine sand are out­
standingly dominant, and the clay content is low and decreasing
with depth.

41 JK 66
When compared, the grain size distribution diagrams show a
very distinct difference. Soil column #15, except for the 4-14
cm level, is clearly dominated by fine to very fine sand and its
clay content is very stable troughout all levels. Contrarily,
soil column #1 has a heterogenous content of clay between levels;
mid-sized sand particles vary in abundance through the profile,
and coarse sand particles tend to dominate.
CONCLUSIONS
Although an intensive search has been made for comparative
data and explanatory models, phosphorus seems to be the only
element investigated thoroughly. This is related to the fact
that environmental science is very concerned with this element
because of its abundance in community sewage, and its importance
in natural systems.
It is not possible, at the present, to reach conclusions
other than in very general terms. What is said in this report
is of hypothetical character, and only further analysis of
samples will falsify or verify the present study. In future
sampling it is strongly suggested that a new sampling design be
constructed so that non-controllable variables are eliminated
and the data base widened.

109

CONCLUSIONS:

SITES IN THE PALMETTO BEND RESERVOIR AREA

The following sites are suitable for resampling after
inundation because they show a distinct and meaningful pattern
of chemical variation: 41 JK 53; 41 JK 74; 41 JK 163 (level
20-30 cm); and 41 JK 66.
Concerning the grain size distribution, I think two variables
should be studied after inundation: the total clay content and
the relative relationship between the amounts of particle sizes.
Particularly the alteration of the clay content could hypo­
thetically be important as an indicator of alternated sediment
profiles. For example, resampling of the two profiles on 41 JK
66 would produce useful data pertaining to these questions,
It is further suggested that certain computer techniques
be applied, especially to the particle size data. Shackley
(1975: 100-106) is informative of relevant statistics. The
application of computer techniques to the comparison of chemical
and sedimentation data would also be advantageous.

LABORATORY PROCEDURES

Determination of pH
To 10 9 ( appr~ximately) of soil in a 50 ml glass beaker,
of 0.01 M CaC1 2 were added, the solution stirred 3 times
minute intervals and then left to rest for 30 minutes,
which the pH was measured. and the result reported as
pH measured in 0.01 M CaC1 2 " (Peech 1965: 223).
The pH measured in 0.01 M CaC12 is about 0.5 pH unit lower
than that measured in water using 1 part of soil to 2 parts ot
liquid, but the method, once developed by Schofield and Taylor
(1955), has several important advantages (ef. Peech 1965: 918-919).

Determination of Total Phosphorus
The methodological procedure in the chemical analysis is
described through the steps noted in Figure 1.
All samples were dried overnight in an oven at a temperature
of around 50°C.
Samples consisting of very fine particle sizes were ground
directly after having been dried. while samples with coarser
particle sizes had to be screened. The choice of sieve size was
made so that the sieved sample would have the same particle size
as the ground one.
0.50 g of each sample was then put into a graduated di­
gestion tube~ to which were added 2 ml of Perchloric Acid (HC10~)
and Nitric Acid (HN0 3 ) respectively.
The tubes were then placed in an aluminum heating block
under a perchloric acid fume hood CBlanchar, Rehm and Caldwell
1965). The HN03 was boiled off at a temperature of 170°C. After
a stepwise increase to 225°C the remaining HC10~ was left to
boil for 1 hour. The tubes were checked regularly so that none
of them boiled dry. If the volume in the tubes placed in the
center of the heating block had decreased to a minimal level,
they were exchanged with tubes from outer positions of the block.
The different rate of decrease of sample volume within the tubes
is caused by the significant temperature difference between the

After the digestion, the volume of each tube was raised to
50 ml with distilled H20, stirred, and left to rest for a period
of at least 12 hours.
'
A stock solution was made according to a modification of
the Murphy and Riley (1962) reagent, consisting of: a) 9.0 9
Ammonium Molybdate ((NH4)6Mo702~.4H20) and 0.2 9 Potassium
Antimony Tartrate (K(SbO)C~H406·1/2H20), which were mixed to­
gether and the volume raised to 1000 ml with H2 0 .

Analytical procedures for total phosphorus detennination.

•
112

A primary standard solution, with a concentration of 1000
ppm (parts per million) P, was made by dissolving 4.387 g Potassium
Phosphate Monobasic (KH 2 P0 4 ) in sufficient H2 0 to yield 1000
ml. A secondary standard solution, with a concentration of 10
ppm P, was made by adding 40 ml HC10 4 to 10 ml of the primary
standard solution and diluting with H2 0 to a volume of 1000 ml.
Working standard solutions ranging from 1 to 6 ppm P were made
from the secondary standard solution.
The color developing solution, freshly made for every batch
of 1000 samples, consisted of 2.0 g Ascorbic Acid mixed with 200
ml of the stock solution and raised to 1000 ml with H2 0.
5 ml of the color-developing solution was added to 1 ml of
each of the working standard solutions as well as to 1 ml of the
samples. After 1 hour their absorbances were read on a Spectronic
20 colorimeter at a wavelength of 740 nm. The absorbance of the
standards was plotted against the known concentration. From this
graph the concentrations of the soil samples were calculated
(cf. Figure 1-2).
This method is a combination and modification of several
(Ahler 1973; Blanchar, Rehm and Caldwell 1965; Frei, Peyer and
SchUtz 1964; and Murphy and Riley 1962). Information relatin9 to
the analytical procedure can be found in Eidt and Woods (1974),
Proudfoot (1976), Provan (1971), and Woods (1977), among others.
Jackson (1958: 175) describes four methods for extracting
total Phosphorus. The second method mentioned by Jackson is
similar to the one used for the present analysis. The chemical
analysis, as described above, is accurate and has good reproduci­
bility. A linear regression of P content and absorbance gave a
correlation coefficient (r) of ) .9998 (cf. Frei, Peyer and SchUtz
1964: 324). The regression line plotted in Figure 2 is based upon
the mean absorbance from 6 standard curves. The linear relation­
ship between absorbance and concentration is evidently true
judging from the r value of 0.9998 and the straight line. One of
the absorption laws, Beer's law, states the following: lithe
fraction of light absorbed is directly proportional to the concen­
tration of the colored constituent (Kirk-Othmer 1964: 788-789).
The chemical analysis conforms closely to Beer's law: the slope
of the regression line is just below optimal linearity as is ex­
pressed by the regression equation y=0.0957x +0.0028. A direct
proportionality, as stated by Beer's law, would have meant
y=O.lx.
Determination of Total Potassium
After a 500 fold dilution and an addition of 5 ml Lanthanum,
the digest resulting from the total P determination, containing
HC104 only, was used for total Potassium determination.
This was done with Flame Emission Spectrometry (air/acetylene
flame) on a Jarrell-Ash #82-000; 0.5 m Ebert Spectrometer (cf.
Tite 1972: 264-266).

Determination of Total Sodium
After a 50 fold dilution and an addition of 2.5 ml Lanthanum,
the digest resulting from the total P determination, containing
HC10 4 only~ was used for total Sodium determination.
This was done with Flame Emission Spectrometry (air/acetylene
flame) on a Jarrell-Ash #82-000; 0.5 m Ebert Spectrometer (cf.
Tite 1972: 264-266),
Determination of Total Calcium
After a 50 fold dilution and an addition of 2.5 ml Lanthanum,
the digest resulting from the total P determination, containing
HC10 4 only, was used for total Calcium determination.
This was done either with Flame Emission Spectrometry (nitrous
oxide/acetylene flame) on a Jarrell-Ash #82-000; 0.5 m Ebert
Spectrometer or with Atomic Absorption Spectometry on a Perkin­
Elmer Model 303 Atomic Absorption Spectrophotometer. (cf. Tite
1972: 264-266),

Determination of Total Magnesium
After a'SO fold dilution and a n addition of 2.5 ml Lanthanum,
the digest resulting from the total P determination, containing
HC10 4 only, was used for total Magnesium determination.
This was done with Atomic Absorption Spectrometry (Magnesium
Hollow Cathode Lamp; air/acetylene flame) on a Jarrell-Ash #82­
000; 0.5 m Ebert Spectrometer or on a Perkin-Elmer Model 303
Atomic Absorption Spectrophotometer (cf. Tite 1972: 264-266).
Particle Size Analysis
Depending upon general particle size, a suitable sample size,
usually 100 g. was either gently ground or crushed with a wooden
mangle.
The sample was passed through a stack of 5 sieves (2.0; 1.0;
0.5; 0.25; and 0.125 mm) on an automatic sieve shaker for a period
of 5 minutes. The sieves were weighed empty and with sample and
the weight percentage calculated for each sieve size. The amount
of the sample with a particle size below 0.125 mm was weighed and
10 g was put into a sedimentation pipet unit (Fisher Scientific
Co., #14-232) using distilled water as sedimentation medium.
10 ml of sample was extracted from constant depth at measured
time intervals (at 20 DC, and 200 mm below surface: after 57s
(seconds) = 4 ~ or 0.016 mm; after Ih (hour) Om48s = 7 ~ or 0.008
mm; and after 4h3m12s = 8 ~ or 0.004 mm. (Cf. Catt and Weir 1976:
75, Table 2) and drained into preweighed evaporating dishes,
evaporated in an oven, weighed, and the weight percentage calcu­
lated. For each sample a particle size distribution curve was
plotted.

ANALYSIS OF GASTROPODS RECOVERED FROM ARCHEOLOGICAL
SITES IN THE PALMETTO BEND RESERVOIR
Raymond W. Neck

This page intentionally left blank.

APPENDIX II
Gastropods recovered from four archeological sites to be
inundated by the Palmetto Bend Dam on the Navidad River were
analyzed. These sites are located in a riparian corridor wood­
land which is intrusive upon the Coastal Prairie of Texas.
These woodlands exhibit high species diversity. Canopy
trees include live oak, Quepcus vipginiana Mill.; post oak,
Quepous stellata Wan~.; water oak, Quepcus nigpa L.; pecan,
Capya illinoinensis (Wang.) K. Koch; cedar elm, Ulmus cpassifolia
Nutt.; sugarberry, Celtis laevigata Willd.; American elm, Ulmus
amepioana L.; Shumard's oak, Quepcus shumardii Buckl.; green ash,
Fraxinus pennsyZvanioa March; and black hickory, Capya texana Bukl.
Common understory woody species are yaupon, IZex vomitoria Ait.;
gum elastic, BumeZia lanuginosa (Michx.) Pers.; and several species
of hawthorn, Crataegus spp. Composition of a woodland at a par­
ticular site is dependent upon local edaphic and hydrological
conditions.
Native Coastal Prairie is characterized by several species
of tall grasses. The most abundant of these grasses are little
bluestem, Sohizaohypium scopapium (Michx.) Nash; big bluestem,
Andpopoqon gepapdi Vitman; Indian grass, Sopghastpum avenaceum
(Michx.) Nash; eastern gamagrass, Tpipsacum dactyloides (L.) L.;
gulf muhly, Muhlenbepgia capiZlapis var. filipes (M. A. Curtis)
Chapm.; and several other co-dominant species.
The prairie and woodland areas around these sites share some
species of snails, but each area also has its own distinctive
fauna (see annotated list below).
Pupoides albilabpis (Adams).

This species requires mesic
but well drained microhabitats in a variety of both woodland
and prairie environments.

Gastrooopta pellucida hordeaoella (Pilsbry).

Occurring in
a variety of environments, this species requires moisture­
preserving cover.

Gastpooopta oontpaota (Say).

This species usually occurs in
riparian woodlands. Although it is often found in association
with the previous species, it generally requires a more mesic
microhabitat.

& Ferriss). This species occurs
in mesic microhabitats with sufficient humus in riparian
wo 0 d 1 and s .

stpobiZops texasiana (Pilsbry

Catinella vermeta (Say).

This wide-ranging species may be
found in xeric environments but is restricted to more mesic
microhabitats.

124

Helicodiscus parallelus (Say).

This occurs under rotting
logs in mesic bottomland woodlands in the eastern part of
Texas.

Helicodiscus singZeyanus (Pilsbry). This species normally
occurs under rocks or other cover in woodland and prairie
areas.
Glyphyalinia umbilicata (Cockerell).

This species occurs in
both woodland and grassland areas where abundant cover is
present.

Mesomphix friabilis (Binney).

This medium-sized snail
lives in leaf litter or under logs in relatively mesic
woodlands.

The four sites for which snail samples were available are
located on Mustang Creek, a tributary of the Navidad River.
41JK66 is located at the ecotonal break between the more upland
Coastal Prairie and the bottomland alluvial woodland. The wood­
land at this site consists of sugarberry and cedar elm; pecan
becomes prevalent downslope toward the creek. The woody under­
story is nearly totally absent, probably due to human impact,
; .e. livestock grazing. Similar impact has reduced the prairie
portion to prostrate grasses and forbs. 41JK178 is located in
a live oak woodland with an intact canopy; understory woody
plants were uncommon. 41JK74 is also located in a live oak
woodland but previous clearing and quarrying (for sand) activi­
ties have reduced native understory plants. Much of the area
around this site has been invaded by three exotic, weedy species
common to the area: chinese tallow. Sapium sebiferum (L.) Roxb.;
chinaberry. Melia azedarach L.; and McCartney rose,'Rosa bracteata
Wendl. Access to 41JK53 was not available but is probably similar
to one of the above three sites.

ANNOTATED LIST OF LAND SNAILS FROM 41JKS3, 66, 74, & 178
Helicina orbiculata (Say). The only operculate land snail
present in Texas also has the widest environmental tolerance of
any land snail in the area. This species occurs in habitats
ranging from closed woodlands to open prairies as long as some
co v e r i nth e form 0 f woo d, roc ks. 0 r pro s t rat e p1ant s is a vail a b1 e .
Shells of this species from the Palmetto Bend area are small in
comparison to shells from central Texas. This is true of both
contemporary and prehistoric shells. Several fine-screened lots
contained opercula of this species.
Rabdotus sp.

This genus is represented by three species in

---~-

125

these archeological sites. Each species is c~aracteristic of a
different habitat. Species identification is based upon pigmented
streaks and background colors in addition to subtle differences
in shell thickness and general appearance, A large number of
shells of this genus from these sites are not referable to a par­
ticular species with a certainty probability which is comfortable
to this writer. None of the shells listed under this label are
Rabdotus alternatus; they represent Rabdotus dealbatus~ Rabdotus
mooreanus or hybrids of the above two taxa,
Rabdotus dealbatus dealbatus (Say).

This species normally
is found in riparian woodlands; it is more mesic-adopted
than the other species of this genus in Texas.

Rabdotus mooreanus (Pfeiffer).

This species occurs in
grassland or mixed savannah habitats. Where these habitats
impinge upon riparian woodlands, dealbatus and mooreanus
hybridize to a certain extent.

Rabdotus alternatus (Say).

This large, heavy-shelled species
occurs in chaparral habitats of southern Texas. This species
does not normally occur in the immediate vicinity of these
archeological sites.

Polygyra texasiana (Moricand).

This species occurs in open
woodland and prairie areas with significant cover in the form
of wood fragments.

Polygyra dorfuelliana Lea.

This species occurs over much of
the same area as the preceding species, but is usually found
in areas of increased effective moisture, i.e., deeper leaf
litter and/or more abundant logs or other suitable cover.

Praticolella berlandieriana (Moricand).

This species occurs
in woodlands, grasslands, and brush-invaded lands which sup­
plies sufficient cover; clayey soils are favored.

Mesodon thyroidus (Say).

This species occurs in riparian
woodlands which are rather mesic and mayor may not be well­
drained.

Mesodon roemeri (Pfeiffer).

This species occurs in woodlands
and savannahs characterized by well-drained soils and sufficient
logs to serve as retreats.
CONTEMPORARY SNAIL FAUNA

Concurrent with a cursory vegetational survey (as reviewed
above), a survey of the present-day land snail fauna was conducted

--------------

126

in the area of 41JK66. General snail pick-up surveying techniques
revealed only four species: Zonitoides arboreus (Say), Mesomphix
friabiZis~ Mesodon thyroidus~ and Glyphyalinia umbiZiaata.
With
the exception of the first-named species, all of the above were
represented in the samples. The only logical reason for the absence
of Z. arboreus from the samples from the archeological sites is
shell destruction due to soil pressure. There is no reason to
believe that this species is an extremely recent invader. A soil
sample taken from a point 100 meters north of 41JK66 was subjected
to normal extraction procedures using a series of soil sieves
(No.8, 16, and 30). This sample revealed a diversity somewhat
lower than expected (9 species--see Table 11-1)
The highly depauperate fauna now found in the vicinity of
41JK66 is largely the result of human impact. Dry conditions at
the time of survey could have reduced the species list somewhat.
but probably not significantly. The greatest impact on the snail
fauna has been livestock grazing pressure, which has reduced the
original Coastal Prairie to prostrate weedy grasses and forbs.
Much of the understory of the riparian woodland of Mustang Creek
has been destroyed because of consumption and trampling by livestock.
INTERPRETATION OF SNAIL SAMPLES
With one exception (R. alternatus) all of the land snails
found in these sites are those to be expected at an ecotonal area
between the coastal prairie and riparian woodland biomes. A number
of species were represented by speCimens of rather large size. How­
ever, until adequate samples of contemporary populations are obtained,
the significance of this large size cannot be determined. SpeCies
with large-sized shells included Mesodon thyroidus~ PratiaolZela
berlandieriana~

Mesomphix

friabilis~

Rabdotus

deaZbatus~

R.

mooreanU8~

and R. aZternatus. As these are the larger sized species in this
sample, one might be tempted to hypothesize that these larger snails
were selected by human inhabitants. This factor was probably acting
on several of the species but P. berZandieriana was probably not
involved in such selection because of its smaller size.
Three species of Rabdotus present in these samples are the
most interesting of all the species recovered at this site. Much
debate has occurred considering the significance of Rabdotus in
archeological deposits (Clark. 1973, 1976; Hester and Hill, 1975).
While few, if any, observers doubt that Texas aboriginal populations
utilized land snails as food, the origin of any particular sample
is uncertain because of the possibility of natural introduction
into the sites (Hester, 1975). Natural introduction may involve
attraction of living ambulatory snails to concentrations of food
in middens or transport by predators to specific sites.

127

The presence of Rabdotus aZternatus is unusual because it is
not to be expected in any of the habitats observed in the vicinity
of these sites on Mustang Creek; nor is it to be expected in the
relatively small upstream drainage basin of this watercourse. The
most likely origin of these shells is imported human food. Two
other factors increase the likelihood that these are human intro­
ductions. Practically all shells of this species are those of
adults (this is not true of the other two species of Rabdotus,
(see 'Table II",,2.). Many of the shells of R. aZternatus are of a very
large size. This would indicate that large specimens were brought
in from nearby sites. Although this species has been reported
from Jackson County (Fullington and Pratt, 1970) populations prob­
ably exist only in western Jackson County within 20 kilometers of
the site. As this species is not overly abundant in the samples,
R. alternatus was probably a food source utlized when other more
heavily used foods were in short supply. This species attaches
itself to a trunk of a shrub or tree to withstand dry periods,
where it would be vulnerable to human collection at any time of
the year.
Both Rabdotus deaZbatus deaZbatus and R. mooreanus may be
considered native to these sites although they could also be (and
probably were) consumed by humans. The former species, characteris­
tic of mesic woodlands and observed in areas similar to these sites,
is represented in the samples by numerous immatures. Reproduction
undoubtedly could readily occur in an active midden where cover and
food would be available. R. mooreanus has been reported from nu­
merous counties in the Coastal Prairie although I have yet to see
any in this biome. At any rate, occurrence of substantial numbers
of immatures of this species indicates that suitable reproductive
habitat was available. Hybridization between these two forms could
well have occurred at these sites. Even if the R. mooreanus were
brought in from some distance, they certainly found a suitable
micro-habitat. Some shells of this species are rather heavy, being
similar to shells found in the Texas Hill Country west of San Antonio.
However, such shells may well exist along the Nueces River in the
vicinity of the presentday Lake Corpus Christi. Both deaZbatus
and mooreanus would be most easily collected when they are aestivat­
ing during hot, dry weather; both forms burrow into the soil during
the winter.
Several samples had small numbers of large Mesodon thyroidus.
These same samples tended to have the large Rabdotus aZternatus.
Whether this indicates that large M. thyroidus were also consumed
is a highly speculative matter at this point. These two species
would not be found in the same habitat.
Appearance of large specimens and immatures of Mesomphix
friabiZis in some samples indicates that sufficient animal protein
was available. Protein sources utilized by this species includes
living snails and small protein sources such as the remains of

128

. mammals, birds, and other animals eaten by the human residents.
Quite possibly large specimens of Mesomphix were eaten by these
people.
One shell of a small (11 mm) marine snail, prunum apiainum
Menke, was found in one sample (41JK74, lot 20). This attractively
colored snail occurs in shallow bays of the western Gulf of Mexico,
but it is uncommon in Texas waters. While it may well have been
a IItrinket
another, thoroughly natural, origin can be postulated.
This snail could have been transported to this site from a coastal
bay ;n the digestive tract of a water bird and deposited during
defecation.
ll

,

Rabdotus alternatus is characteristic of the South Texas Plains
which today, as the result of human impact, is best described as
South Texas Brush Country, This species attaches itself to the
trunk of a shrub or tree to withstand dry periods by aestivating,
at which time it would be vulnerable to human collection at any
season of the year. In actuality, however, there are several periods
which are more likely to be characterized by collection of R. alternatus
by aboriginal populations. One of the prime aestivation microhabitats of this snail is the pad of the abundant prickly-pear,
Opuntia lindheimeri Engelm.

Fruit of this same prickly pear known by their Spanish name of
tuna was the prime summer food of the native human populations of

much of Texas (Krieger 1956). Entire populations would converge on
the prickly pear areas of south central and southern Texas. Seasonal
occupation of these areas would last for several months. Possibly,
some snails were consumed during these festival-like days.
Alvar Nunez Cabeza de Vaca was a Spanish explorer who was
shipwrecked on the Texas coast in 1528. After living with various
Indian groups for several years, he finally found a Spanish settle­
ment on the Mexican Pacific coast. Following his return to Spain,
he wrote of his adventures. This journal has been invaluable to
anthropologists studying protohistoric cultures of southern Texas.
Using a translation of Cabeza de Vaca's journal by Bishop (1933),
Hester and Hill (1975) cited enthnographic observations of the
importance of land snails during the late summer tuna-collecting
period. This observation was disputed by Clark (1976) who claimed
that Bishop (1933) had made an error of translation.
Utilization of snails as a food source during a period of extreme
abundance of the highly-desired tunas would appear unlikely because
molluscan tissues are generally low in calories (Parmalee and Klippel,
1974). More likely, R. alternatus individuals could have been collect­
ed at the end of the tuna collecting period. Snails are easily
collected off cactus pads and trunks of various brushland species.
They are easy to store, coming packaged in a custom-designed container.
Storage in simple holding baskets would allow snails to survive for

129

several months. The major problem as regards keeping the snails
would be to maintain them in a dry situation so that they were not
induced to emerge from their shell and move about.
Individuals may have been collected in late summer before
leaving the prickly pear areas. Snails were carried back to the
coastal base camps where they were consumed and discarded to become
part of the midden refuse.
Other time periods may also have been a likely time for collec­
tion of R. alternatus individuals. Except for summer (prickly pear
tunas) and late autumn (pecans) most times were periods of scarce
food for the aboriginal populations of this area of Texas (Krieger
1956). Utilization of any food items that could be easily collected
(and neither attempted rapid escape or attacked in defense) is to
be expected.
However. the known existence of annual summer trips to the
major habitat of Rabdotus alternatus by these people indicates
that late summer and early fall would be the most likely utilization
period for this snail as food.
Consumption of these snails was probably accomplished by simple
extraction of a cooked snail. The body may well protrude allowing
oral-extraction from the shell; otherwise extraction using a thin,
sharp flint tool or a plant thorn would suffice. Heating of the
shell, particularly boiling, injures the shell surface; this may
have been the source of some of the problems in differentiating the
various species of Rabdotus seen in this study. One sample (41JK74,
lot 55/56) contained numerous fragments of Rabdotus shell, most of
which was probably R. alternatus. These fragments could be the
result of snails that were smashed in order to extract the animal
for food. Certainly more study is needed.
As only four aquatic snail shells were found in these samples,
the samples are believed to largely if not almost entirely consist
of snails which lived and died at these sites; flood debris contri­
bution to these sites is believed to be minimal.
No analysis has been attempted to differentiate between-level
variations in percentage occurrence of various snail species. How­
ever, the raw data are presented in tables. This report is based
upon analysis of 8909 snail shells (41JK53, 927 snails; 41JK66,
5073 snails; 41JK74, 2613 snails; 41JK178, 296 snails).

VERTEBRATE FAUNAL REMAINS RECOVERED FROM ARCHEOLOGICAL
SITES IN THE PALMETTO BEND RESERVOIR

APPENDIX III
The vertebrate material was identified as completely as
possible and the distribution of each taxon was tallied by lot
and by level within each of the seven sites. In the accompanying
charts this distribution is expressed as minimum number of indi­
vidual animals of each taxon which would have been needed to
produce the number of bones found; these figures were arrived at
by counting the number of the most common skeletal element from
each taxon for which right and left could be determined.
Except for badger and antelope, all taxa found at Palmetto
Bend are ones which might be found in Jackson County today. Badger
occurs today in counties as close to Jackson County as Bee and
San Patricio counties, and so its presence in the fauna probably
does not signify any important climatic differences. Antelope,
however, today occurs only on the High Plains, in the Panhandle
area; thus, its presence in the fauna suggests an age of several
hundred years for the two sites in which it occurs.
At 41JK66 the presence of horse bones in Zone 3 is in conflict
with that of artifacts spanning a very long time period and radio­
carbon dates ending at A. D. 1250. It is possible that some of the
conflicting faunal and artifactual materials are intrusions into
this zone rather than having been deposited there originally. In
fact, there is a great deal of ~vidence for extensive mixing of
material between zones (See 41JK66). Principal paints indicating
mlxlng are: the presence of mole and pocket gopher, both of which
are enthusiastic burrowers; the great variation in preservation
among bones from the same level, or even the same square, suggest­
ing greatly different ages for material found lying quite close
together. The differences in preservation are quite marked, with
some bones from a given level being quite sound. while others of
the same taxa are chalky or deeply solution-pitted, indicating
much greater age. Hopefully the forthcoming Carbon-14 dates on
this material will help to resolve this question.
All bones were checked for possfble artifactual marks or
patterns of breakage. Several fragments of unidentifiable bone
were found which obviously had been worked, having been rounded
off and in some cases having had a design cut into them. These
pieces came from 41JK66 Zones 3 through 9. Several deer ulna
fragments also were found in these zones which might be described
as worked in that the broken end of the thin distal shaft had been
rounded, flattened, or pointed. No patterns of breakage were ob­
served which could clearly be ascribed either to human or to
carnivore action upon the material; most breaks could equally well
have been caused by one of these two agents or by something else.
