ABSTRACT
The life of a cowboy in West Texas was a lonely life. Many
hours were spent roaming the vast expanse of the open range,
working from sun-up to sun-down. One such cowboy, Burt
Smalley, worked on an Irion County ranch in the 1920’s and
1930’s. While working on the ranch, he devoted many hours of his
spare time sitting alone on a limestone outcrop and carving into the
stones a variety of ranch related objects commonly found on early
area ranches. In 2012, archeologists located, mapped, sketched
and photographed 192 petroglyphs on the historic site (41IR76).
The following manuscript reports the documentation of the
petroglyphs.

INTRODUCTION
In 1989, a field crew from the Texas Archeological Research
Laboratory of The University of Texas at Austin, conducted a pipe
line survey through Irion County. On a limestone hill near Teepee
draw, they came across a petroglyph of a snake that was thought to
be a prehistoric Indian petroglyph. After further investigation
more petroglyphs were noted and it was determined that they were
historic carvings, Anglo American in origin.
The site (41IR76) is an extensive collection of petroglyphs
carved in the limestone bedrock by a lone cowboy Burt Smalley.
The petroglyphs include brands and objects commonly found on
early area ranches. A name and date carved among the
petroglyphs (Burt Smalley – 1921) led to further archival research
that later told the story of this cowboy.
Smalley was born on a farm in DeWitt County Texas and left
the area as a teen-ager to seek work on a ranch in West Texas. He
ended up working on a ranch near Barnhart, Texas. He led a
4

solitary life as a cowboy as noted by neighbor E.C. Tarvin. His
interest in ranching history was probably the reason behind the
extensive collection of petroglyphs he carved among the limestone
rocks. Although family and neighbors did not know of Smalley’s
works until they were discovered some years later, Tarvin noted
that Burt spent many Sunday afternoons on the hillside (Utley,
Turpin 1995).
As time passes and the Smalley petroglyphs are exposed to
the elements, weathering has started to take its toll. Over the last
twenty years, it is evident that many of the petroglyphs are slowly
fading away. The documentation of these unique petroglyphs will
preserve an interesting life history of a lone cowboy and his works.

HISTORY OF THE SITE
In the winter of 1995, Dan Utley and Solveig Turpin published an
article in the Persimmon Hill magazine, A Publication of the National
Cowboy Hall of Fame. The article entitled The Burt Smalley Petroglyphs A
Rancher’s Legacy in Stone best tells the story of the site and the life of Burt
Smalley. Following is the article in its entirety.
Few images of the American West are as pervasive in the collective
cultural perceptions of our past as that of the lone cowhand. The stereotype
of one rugged, determined individual persevering against the overwhelming
vastness and solitude of the ranching west is central to important aspects of
our folklore literature, art, music, and regional introspection.
Writers of all disciplines have mythologized the lone cowhand,
ascribing to him contemplative traits of philosopher and world observer,
while downplaying more likely characteristics of frustration, isolation, or
8

ennui. Born in part of truth, the image of the lone cowhand survives to this
day, even while innovations such as cellular phones, laptop computers, FAX
machines, and super highways are redefining ranch life.
Just how lonesome was the lone cowhand of the historic American
West? Archives preserve some answers in the form of diaries, journals, and
family correspondence of those fortunate enough to be literate. Dictated
memoirs, contemporaneous biographical sketches, and oral histories also
record significant insights and reminiscences, as do photographs and period
art. Additional clues are found in archeological remains of the cowboys’
lifestyle and in the patterns of their impact on the cultural and
environmental landscape.
Field crews of the Texas Archeological Research Laboratory of The
University of Texas at Austin discovered just such an archeological site, one
that could have some relevance to the stereotypical image of the lone
cowhand.
In 1989, archeologists following a pipeline corridor through Irion
County, Texas, came over a hill above Teepee Draw and found what they
initially believed was a prehistoric Indian petroglyph of a snake. Further
investigation indicated, however, that the carvings were historic and Anglo
American in origin.
The site proved to be an extensive collection of petroglyphs that
covered several acres, included deeply incised cattle brands, and outlines of
objects commonly found on early area ranches. Among the objects carved
in stone were a pistol, rifle, coffeepot, boot, drawknife, a coiled rattlesnake,
saws, sheep shears, and a turtle. Less understandable were carvings of a
demijohn and an anchor.
The brands, numbering more than 70, included such familiar ones as
the Frying Pan of the Panhandle area, the Running W of the South Texas
King Ranch, and the XIT of the celebrated Capitol Syndicate.
Geographical diversity was evidenced by the Half-circle J, and El
Paso brand, and the L up and L down, a brand registered in Gonzales
County. While some of the brands were identified through published
sources, county registration books, and the assistance of local historians
and museum personnel, most remain unknown. It appears many of the
petroglyphs represent adaptations of existing brands, or concepts of
proposed designs.
A name and date incised in the midst of the petroglyphs proved to be
the clue that led to further archival research. The date was clearly 1921,
but the name could have been Burt Smalley or Burt S. Malley — the S was
backwards. A review of death records in Austin showed a Burt Smalley died
9

in Fort Worth on April 1, 1974. His obituary in the local newspaper listed
the names of his surviving family members, most of whom lived in the
DeWitt County area.
Following a variety of leads, contact was finally made with Smalley’s
sister, Ella Schlinke. In an oral history interview, she and her nieces,
Charlene B. Anderson and Audrey L. Clinton, provided background
information about Burt Smalley’s life. A detailed personal history of a lone
cowhand began to emerge.
Smalley was born Aug. 30, 1888, to a struggling farm family in the
community of Davy, a dispersed agricultural settlement in western DeWitt
County. Sensing a limited future in the cotton fields of his hometown, he left
the area as a teenager to seek work as a ranch hand in West Texas. He
eventually ended up west of Barnhart on a sizable spread owned by a
rancher named “Honey” Henderson.
The two men agreed on terms of employment that would allow
Smalley to live on the land free. Any wages he might accrue in the course of
his work would be held in an informal trust until Smalley was ready to claim
them. This bond of honor governed the working relationship of the two
through the 1920’s and into the mid-1930’s. Smalley proved to be a trusted
employee, working his way up to ranch foreman.
In 1936, at the height of the Great Depression, he made the decision
to recall his investment to finance his lifelong dream of owning his own
ranch land and herds. His back wages then amounted to approximately
$30,000, a fortune in those hard times. Henderson, like others trapped in
the nation’s economic downturn, lacked the liquidity to fulfill the pledge
immediately. Rather than abrogate the commitment, however, he sold his
considerable Irion County land holdings in order to raise the capital.
Such action, while exemplary and laudatory, perhaps merely reflected
the pervasiveness of an informal, but ironclad, West Texas code of honor
that made a man’s word his bond. Nonetheless, the story of Burt Smalley,
the rancher, and the “gentleman’s agreement” circulated widely.
Oral accounts of Smalley’s life in Irion County depict him as a quiet,
unassuming man, conservative in nature and frugal in personal finances.
While not a hermit, he nonetheless resigned himself to a solitary life. He
was not, however, without social contacts within the nearby community.
Neighbor E.C. Tarvin recalled Smalley frequently ventured into Barnhart on
a motorcycle to buy supplies. While there, he would often visit with a local
hotelier, and they engaged in lengthy discussions, some friendly and some
heated, about many topics.

10

Although Smalley lacked a formal education, he held his own,
especially when the subject was history. His primary interest was ranching
history, and his series of petroglyphs reflect the depth of his knowledge.
Smalley never married, but he apparently never missed the
companionship. He frequently stated to family members that he would never
have a woman or a cat on his land, reasoning, “A cat is in everything but
your business, and a woman is in your business.” He avoided women who
viewed him as “eligible,” and even enlisted the aid of local youths to shop
form him at a mercantile run by an “interested” widow.
Living alone, Smalley adopted the practice of frequently moving his
sleeping quarters from room to room. While this may have been done to
protect what limited material wealth he had, or was believed to have, it also
afforded him an element of surprise on at least one occasion when armed
intruders entered his home. The notoriety of his accrued wages may have
made him the target of such robbery attempts in the years before he left the
county.
Until strangers ”discovered” Smalley’s carvings, family members and
neighbors were not aware of his “rock art” pastime, although E.C. Tarvin
recalled
the
young
cowhand
spent
many
Sunday afternoons alone on the limestone outcrop. The expanse of the site
and the complexity of the petroglyphs indicate Smalley committed countless
hours and many years to the project.
His carvings are generally one-dimensional, their simplicity dictated
by the nature of the medium, but they are not without detail. Some made in
haste have weathered considerably over the years, while others reveal deep
incisions that must have been time-consuming even with the proper stone
working tools.
In the course of the investigation associated with the archeological
site, family members provided several photographs of Smalley in his prime.
Some pictured him tending cattle or hogs, probably on his own land in the
1940s or 1950s. In a few, he is shown wearing dark glasses, which his sister
said were prescribed for a malady that caused a sensitivity to light.
The most lasting image, however, is perhaps the mental one derived
from oral sources: a young cowhand wearing dark glasses, alone on a
remote, treeless hill, meticulously and systematically recording the everyday
life of an ordinary man. On his stone “canvas” are deeply incised outlines
of everything that might have been commonly found on an early West Texas
ranch – everything, that is, except a cat or a woman.
Smalley eventually moved from the Barnhart area, using his new
wealth to begin acquiring land in Coke County in the winter of 1940. He
11

first bought almost 700 acres from Raymond and Katheleen McCutchen. To
this he added approximately 480 acres from D.J. and Ada Walker, and 270
acres from W.R.W. and Zelma L. Gunnels. In each of the transactions,
Smalley invested relatively large sums of capital in order to minimize
financing. His investment grew in value over time, in part because of oil
leases to both Union Oil and Texaco.
In 1958, near the age of 70, Smalley sold his Coke County ranchstead
for $66,000, part of which he financed for the new owner. Those who
followed him on the land never found evidence of a petroglyph site
reminiscent of that left behind in Irion County.
Following the sale of his ranch, Smalley lived for a time in San
Angelo, but eventually moved to Fort Worth to be near family. Upon his
death there in 1974, his body was interred in the Davy Cemetery near his
birthplace.
From the cotton field of the Texas coastal plains to the isolated
ranches of West Texas, and from San Angelo to Fort Worth and back to
DeWitt County, Smalley had come full circle. Surviving family members
inherited a sizable estate, the result of his frugal lifestyle and conservative
investments, but his legacy in stone remained undiscovered and unknown for
another 15 years.
The motivating factors that led Smalley to record his life’s artifacts in
stone remain a mystery; he left no diary or journal to explain his intentions.
Are the petroglyphs merely the elaborate idle doodlings of a simple man, or
do they have a deeper meaning? Do they represent a cathartic experience
limited in time and place, or do they show a longing for immortality.
Given Smalley’s interest in history, perhaps they are a respectful
attempt to honor and imitate the rock art of such ancient people as those
who must have inhabited the land around Teepee draw.
What is certain about the petroglyphs is that they helped preserve an
interesting life history of one lone cowhand. Unlike most prehistoric rock
art, which is communal and corporate, the Irion County carvings represent
a solitary record of one man at one specific point in time. The fact that
something is known of his life adds to the site’s significance in terms of
cultural history.
In a broader context, the actions of Burt Smalley are not too
dissimilar to those of countless other individuals over time. Like the bottled
note cast into the sea, the scrawled graffiti in the subway, or the tagged
balloon released from a schoolyard, they are evidence of the innate longing
all humans have to be recognized within the vastness of the universe.
12

Such longing after all, is at the core of most social and cultural
institutions, from the arts and government to personal relationship and
education. Heady ideas to ponder, thanks to the musings of a lone cowhand
on a West Texas Hill.

ARCHEOLOGICAL
DOCUMENTATION
In 1989, when the Burt Smalley petroglyphs were first observed and
recorded by archeologist, the importance of the site became evident. During
the ensuing years, attempts were made to document the site, but this only
resulted in the article published in Persimmon Hill magazine.
In 2012 with the increased oil activity in Irion County, Dr. Solveig
Turpin, principle investigator of the pipeline crew that recorded the site,
contacted the author about the possibility of documenting the site. The
author contacted the landowner Richard Mayer, and it was determined that
the petroglyphs had shown evidence of weathering during the past years. In
April of 2012, Mr. Mayer agreed to an archeological crew entering the
property and documenting the petroglyphs. Several trips were made during
the year to locate, map, sketch and photograph the petroglyphs.

A large flat limestone rock leaning toward the East and propped by
another smaller rock was reportedly used by Smalley as a sun-dial.
The rock is located near Stake EE.

SUMMARY
In 1989, an archeologist working on a pipeline survey in Irion County
came across a snake carved in limestone rock. At first it was thought that
this was a site that contained pre-historic petroglyphs. On further
investigation it was noted the site contained many petroglyphs dating to the
historic era. At that time the site was recorded, but the significance of the
site was not fully recognized. Archival research later told the story of a lone
cowboy in the early 1920’s who sat atop a limestone hill in West Texas and
left his legacy in stone. Burt Smalley used the limestone rocks on the hill as
a canvas to carve 194 known images that were as realistic as the actual
objects they represented.
In the mid 1990’s, Solveig Turpin and the author returned to the site
to photograph some of the petroglyphs for an article in Persimmon Hill
magazine. The amount of time spent at the site was limited and only a few
of the petroglyphs were located and photographed.
A more extensive search of the site in 2012 revealed many more
petroglyphs, some that had been covered by soil from sheet erosion. During
this trip, it was noted that many of the petroglyphs were becoming faint due
to weathering of the limestone rock. Two carvings photographed during the
1990’s trip were not located during the 2012 documentation. These along
with others have been buried and some have weathered away.
Of the 194 petroglyphs documented, 143 were brands. This would
stand to reason given the occupation of Burt Smalley. It is known that
cowboys would carry their own diary of cattle brands that would help
identify strays. This could account for the large number of brands carved in
the rocks by Smalley. The remaining carvings included everyday items that
a cowboy would use while working on the ranch. Some of the carvings
could be both brands and ranch items (anvil, rolling pin, anchor, pitch fork,
key, etc.).

Smalley carved his name in two different areas of the site. In one area
he carved his name “BURT SMALLEY” (with a backwards S) (Stake EE
Panel 1) and the date “1921”. In other areas of the site, brands were carved
with a backwards “S”, and it remains a mystery as to why. In 1922, he
carved his name in another part of the site (Stake HH Panel 1) and the “S” in
Smalley was not backward.
During documentation of the petroglyphs, Smalley’s style of carving
began to emerge. Letters and numbers throughout the site had similar
characteristics. Two petroglyphs stand out as not being carved by Smalley
The first carving “CBH” (Stake I Panel 5a petroglyph 53) was probably
introduced into the site by a visitor in later years. The style of this carving
did not have the same characteristics as Smalley’s, and the letters exhibited a
whiter color indicating they were carved at a later date. The second carving
“JV 1949” (Stake GG Panel 1 petroglyph 140) exhibited a different style of
letters and numbers, and the date was after Smalley left the ranch.
In looking at rock art sites, we often wonder why the picture was
painted on the wall or scratched in the rocks. The Burt Smalley site, created
less than a century ago, lends an answer to the question. Aboriginals, as
well as Smalley, wanted to tell the tales of their everyday life by painting or
scratching them on a canvas that was provided by nature. This collection of
historic petroglyphs carved by Smalley stands among the best in the world.
