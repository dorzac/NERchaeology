Project Description
1.1	The Undertaking
The United States Army Corps of Engineers, Fort Worth District (USACE) is responsible for
managing certain federally owned lands in Central Texas in association with lakes, reservoirs,
and navigable waterways. These management responsibilities include 11,456-acre Somerville
Lake and its surrounding federal land. Because Somerville Lake received funds from the
American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009, improvements are proposed to Yegua
Creek and Rocky Creek parks, both of which are owned by the federal government and
managed by the USACE. While planning and conducting undertakings that have the potential
to affect historic properties, the USACE must take such resources into account. Therefore, in
compliance with Section 106 of the National Historic Preservation Act of 1966 as amended
through 1992 (P. L. 89-665 et seq.), the current investigation was authorized by the USACE to
identify any archeological sites, buildings, structures, or other resources that may be eligible
for inclusion on the National Register of Historic Places (NRHP). Ecological Communications
Corporation (EComm) conducted the archeological work.
Both parks are popular destinations for campers, many of whom require access to water, electric,
and sewer hookups for camper trailers. Increased visitor traffic and aged facilities are in need
of replacement and/or improvements. Proposed improvements will include creating additional
parking lots, flush toilet facilities, and additional water and electrical hookups, and removing
existing pit toilet facilities. Improving or replacing existing facilities and/or installing new
facilities will create impacts to depths of up to three feet (ft), or one meter (m).

1.2	Location
The project area consists of ten parcels in
two parks totaling approximately 123.5
acres at Somerville Lake in northern
Washington County (Table 1). Somerville
Lake is located on Yegua Creek 2.5 miles
southwest of the City of Somerville and
15 miles north of Brenham (Figure 1). The
dam was built in 1967 for flood-control,
conservation, and recreational purposes.
Elevation of the conservation pool is 238
ft above mean sea level (amsl). Somerville
Lake contains about 4,600 surface acres
and holds approximately 155,062 acre-

feet of water at conservation pool levels. Pool elevation at the time of this survey was
approximately 236 ft amsl (United States Army Corps of Engineers 2007).
The ten survey areas are all located on the south side of Somerville Lake. Three parcels are
located in Yegua Creek Park and are designated Areas 1â3, and seven parcels are in Rocky
Creek Park and are designated Areas AâG (see Table 1-1). The survey areas are currently
dedicated to camping areas, with the exception of Area 1 (currently undeveloped) and Area B
(camping area currently closed to the public) (Figure 2).

1.3	Natural Environment
Typical vegetation currently encountered within the Somerville Lake area includes post oak
(Quercus stellata), chinquapin or âpinâ oak (Quercus muhlenbergii), Yaupon holly (Ilex
vomitoria), black walnut (Juglans cinera L.), hackberry (Celtis spp.), bois dâarc (Maclura
pomifera), buffalo grass (Buchloe dactyloides), little bluestem (Schizachyrium scoparium), big
bluestem (Andropogon gerardii), and switchgrass (Panicum virgatum) (Preston 1976; Vines
1984). The project area is located within the Texan Biotic Province as defined by Blair (1950).
Typical mammalian fauna commonly observed within this region include opossum (Didelphis
marsupialis), striped skunk (Mephitis mephitis), raccoon (Procyon lotor), nine-band armadillo
(Dasypus novemcinctus), bobcat (Lynx rufus), and coyote (Canis latrans) (Davis and Schmidly
1994).

1.4	Bedrock Geology and Soils
The bedrock geology encountered within the project areas is composed of sandstone deposits
of the Manning formation (Texas Commission on Environmental Quality [TCEQ] 2004).
These sandstone and shale deposits formed approximately 60â55 million years ago during the
Eocene Epoch of the Tertiary period, when the region consisted of broad riverine deltas that
drained southeastward (Alvarez 2006; Barnes 1974; Sellards et al. 1932; TCEQ 2004).
The ten inventory parcels contain sandy soils formed from alluvium and bedrock residuum
underlain by precultural clays. Cultural deposits in these soils are generally shallowly buried
and are adequately investigated by manual shovel testing.
According to the US Department of Agriculture (USDA) Soil Survey of Washington County
(Chervenka et. al. 1981), soils within the survey areas include Burlewash fine sandy loam
(29.7%), Falba fine sandy loam (32.5%), Silawa loamy fine sand (23.1%), Tabor fine sandy
loam (1.2%), and Tremona fine sand (13.5%). These soils are all similar in makeup and
pedogenesis, and are largely restricted to upland settings.
Upper soil columns are generally brown to dark brown fine sandy loams to depths of 6â13
inches (15â33 cm), underlain by brown sandy or clayey subsoil to depths of 21â40 inches
(53â100 cm), underlain by light brown to reddish yellow clays or sterile sands of varying
depths to local bedrock. Soils are largely well drained and medium to very acidic in nature.

Cultural Context
2.1	Previous Work
2.1.1 Previously Recorded Archeological Sites
The Texas Historical Commission (THC) online Archeological Sites Atlas shows a total of
nine known archeological sites within one mile, or 1.6 kilometers (km), of the parcels. These
sites are largely prehistoric open campsites of varying or unknown ages. None of the sites are
eligible for listing on the NRHP or for designation as State Archeological Landmarks (SALs).
Site 41WT2, recorded in 1961 by Kenneth Honea for the National Park Service (NPS), is
located one mile (1.6 km) southeast of Area A and consists of several hearths observed in an
eroded cut to a depth of 50 centimeters below the surface (cmbs). No diagnostic artifacts were
recovered, leaving this site with an undetermined age (Honea 1961a).
Site 41WT3, also recorded in 1961 by Honea for NPS, is a 20-acre open campsite located
within Yegua Creek Park approximately 174 m (570 ft) south of Area 3; it has a general Archaic
association (Honea 1961b).
Site 41WT23, located along the main park road within Rocky Creek Park approximately 67 m
(220 ft) north of Area B, is a prehistoric site of undetermined age (Texas Historical Commission
Archeological Sites Atlas [THCASA] n.d.a).
Site 41WT24 is located within Rocky Creek Park along the main park road 76 m (250 ft) west
of Area A. This site consists of a collection of historic glass sherds and square and cut nails
(THCASA n.d.b).
Site 41WT25 is an earlyâtwentieth-century historic structure site located 1,463 m (4,800
ft) west of the project areas. Prewitt and Associates, Inc. recorded the site in 1981. The site
assemblage includes a cistern feature and miscellaneous bottle and ceramic sherds (Day 1981).
Site 41WT31, recorded by the USACE in 1983, is located within Yegua Creek Park 88 m (290
ft) west of Area 2, across a small drainage now occupied by a boat ramp. This small open
campsite of unknown age was noted to have had three hearths but no diagnostic artifacts (Scott
1983).
Site 41WT41, recorded by Prewitt and Associates, Inc. for the Bureau of Land Management
(BLM) in advance of an oil well pad and pipeline construction in 1983, is located within
Rocky Creek Park 305 m (1,000 ft) west of Area D, and is a dual-occupation site consisting of
unknown prehistoric chert flakes and miscellaneous historic ceramic and purple glass sherds
(Fields 1983).

Cultural Context

Site 41WT50, also recorded by Prewitt and Associates, Inc. for the BLM in advance of an oil
well pad, tank battery, and access road construction in 1984, is located in Yegua Creek Park 396
m (1,300 ft) south of Area 1. This prehistoric lithic scatter of unknown age was documented to
extend from 30 to 50 cmbs (Hannum 1984; Hannum and Klement 1985).
Site 41WT55 was documented by Prewitt and Associates for the BLM in 1985 as part of an
oil well pad survey. This open campsite of Late Prehistoric age (based on the presence of a
Scallorn arrow point) is located in an undeveloped portion of Yegua Creek Park 518 m (1,700
ft) east of Area 3 (Hannum 1985).

2.1.2 Previous Archeological Surveys
The THC Archeological Sites Atlas indicates that 31 previous archeological surveys have
been performed within one mile (1.6 km) of the project area. These surveys include 16 linear
surveys (totaling 6.6 miles) and 15 block area surveys (totaling 162 acres) performed mostly
for USACE, with two oil surveys for the BLM and two for NPS. The surveys are either along
local roads or within USACE parklands, and appear to be associated with all of the nine sites
documented within one mile. Within the project areas, Areas 1, 2, A, B, C, and F had portions
previously surveyed by the 1961 NPS survey and 1981 and 1983 USACE block surveys.

2.2	Cultural Historical Framework
The project area is located within the southeastern portion of the Central Texas Archeological
Region as defined by Turner and Hester (1999). Over the past century, numerous explanations
have been put forth by prominent archeologists regarding Central Texasâ prehistoric cultural
chronology (see Black 1989, 1995; Collins 1995; Jelks 1962; Johnson and Goode 1994;
Kelly 1947; Prewitt 1981; Weir 1976). The cultural background presented in this report is
predominantly based on the chronological interpretations made by Johnson and Goode (1994)
and Collins (1995). All dates are approximate and given as radiocarbon years before present
or BP (i.e., before the development of radiocarbon dating in 1950). Human presence in Central
Texas is divided into Prehistoric and Historic stages.
Three major intervals or periods are identified in the Prehistoric Stage: 1) Paleoindian, 2)
Archaic, and 3) the Late Prehistoric.

2.2.1 Paleoindian
The earliest known time of human occupation in North America is the Paleoindian period. In
Central Texas, it is generally considered to date from about 11,000 to 8,500 BP. The archeological
evidence suggests that during this time the earliest residents of Texas were highly nomadic
hunters and gatherers (Brown and Lebo 1990:16). Populations were likely small and dispersed,
and exploited a variety of wild food resources. The economy was based on a lithic technology.
Large leaf-shaped projectile points, such as the widespread Folsom and Clovis, are diagnostic

Cultural Resource Inventory of 123.5 Acres at Somerville Lake, Washington County, Texas

of this period and suggest that mega-fauna, such as extinct bison, were key resources. Within
Central Texas, a generalized hunting and gathering subsistence economy was characteristic.
Archeological sites dating to this period are often found deeply buried near water sources.

2.2.2 Archaic
According to Collins (1995), the Archaic period in Central Texas occurred between 8800 and
1200 or 1300 BP. The Archaic period is divided into three sub-periods: Early, Middle, and Late
Archaic (Collins 1995).
Early Archaic
The Early Archaic period in Central Texas occurred between 8800 and 6000 BP (Collins 1995).
The hunting patterns that formed during the Late Paleoindian continued into the Early Archaic.
The hunter-gatherers during this period modified their existing subsistence strategy and became
more holistic by exploiting a wider array of food resources, such as prickly pear, rodents and
rabbits (Story 1985:38â39; Weir 1976). Early Triangular, Martindale, and Andice are some of
the projectile points commonly associated with this period (Black 1995).
Middle Archaic
Collins (1995) dates the Middle Archaic in Central Texas to 6000â4000 BP. During the
Middle Archaic, severe and prolonged altithermal (warm and dry) climatic conditions were
predominant. The severe altithermal noted in Texas led to numerous important social and
subsistence adaptations for the native inhabitants during this time. The altithermal caused the
numerous bison populations, commonly observed in this region during the early stages of the
Early Archaic, to migrate out of Texas into the more mesic climate in the northern Great Plains.
With the total loss of bison and severe xeric conditions throughout Texas, native populations
migrated into Central Texas, where resource-rich environments were fed by natural springs
that rose from the Balconies Escarpment fault zone.
Late Archaic
Collins (1995) dates the Late Archaic in Central Texas to 4000â1200 or 1300 BP. During the
Late Archaic, the severe altithermal observed during the Middle Archaic waned, and more
mesic conditions prevailed (Collins 1995). The return of mesic conditions in Central Texas
also brought about the return of the large bison populations that left Texas during the Early
to Middle Archaic. The return of large bison herds brought about a substantial change in the
population density and subsistence strategies employed by the native inhabitants in Central
Texas during this time. The mobile hunting and gathering subsistence strategy associated with
plains bison-focused hunting replaced the sedentary and holistic food processing life-ways
adopted during the Middle Archaic.

2.2.3 Late Prehistoric
The Late Prehistoric in Central Texas occurred between 1250 and 260 BP (Collins 1995). The
development of the bow and arrow, along with the introduction of pottery in Central Texas, are
technological innovations that mark the shift from the Archaic to the Late Prehistoric (Black
1989:32; Story 1985:45â47). The Late Prehistoric is divided into two phases: the Austin Phase
(ca. 1250â800 BP) and the Toyah Phase (ca. 800â260 BP).
Austin Phase
The Austin Phase was a period of population decline (Black 1989:32). Early expanding-stem
projectile points (e.g., Scallorn) are common during this time. Even though small burned rock
middens associated with Edwards and Scallorn points have been found (Goode 1991:71; Houk
and Lohse 1993:193â248), they are rare.
Toyah Phase
In Central Texas, the Toyah Phase is marked by a shift from expanding-stem projectile points
(e.g., Scallorn) to contracting-stem points (e.g., Perdiz [Black 1989:32; Huebner 1991:346]).
In addition, this phase is characterized by the introduction of bladelet technology and the first
appearance of bone-tempered pottery in Central Texas.

2.2.4 Historic
The Historic period in Texas is divided into two sub-periods: Protohistoric and Historic. The
following is a very brief and generalized description of the Historic period in Texas.
Protohistoric
The Protohistoric spans the period ca. 470â300 BP. The arrival of Spanish explorer Cabeza de
Vaca into South and Southeast Texas in 1528 marks the beginning of the Protohistoric period
in Texas. The first European to enter the immediate area was RenÃ©-Robert Cavelier Sieur de
La Salle during his final expedition in 1687 (Hailey and Leffler 2009). Due to the fact that few
written records are available for analysis, most of what we know regarding the Protohistoric has
been gathered through archeological means (Hester 1995:449â450). Generally, archeological
sites that date to this sub-period contain both traditional Native American artifacts (e.g., lithic
tools) and imported European manufactured goods (e.g., glass beads, metal).
Early reports from the vicinity of present-day Washington County noted the presence of
permanent Tonkawa villages and transient Apache and Aranama groups as well (Hailey and
Leffler 2009).

Historic
The establishment of the Catholic Missions by the northward expanding Spanish Colonial
Empire marks the arrival of the Historic sub-period in Texas, which extends from 300 BP until
present. Unlike the Protohistoric, a great deal of what we know regarding the Historic subperiod is derived from the analysis of numerous written records produced by the early Spanish
missionaries.
The first European settlers arrived in present-day Washington County in 1821 as part of Stephen
F. Austinâs initial Mexican land grant. Though initially much larger, Washington County was
one of the original counties defined by the Republic of Texas in 1836, with seats of power
moving from Washington-on-the-Brazos, then to Mount Vernon, and finally to Brenham in
1844 (Hailey and Leffler 2009).
From the beginning of Anglo settlement, agriculture dominated the local economy, transitioning
from subsistence to production farming throughout the pre-Civil War years. By 1860, half of
Washington County residents were listed as slaves, which was reflected in election results of
95 percent in favor of secession from the Union (Hailey and Leffler 2009). Cotton increased
its importance in the area after the Civil War, largely through the introduction of the Gulf,
Colorado, and Santa Fe Railway (GCSF). Following the arrival of the boll weevil in the 1910s,
the local economy shifted toward animal husbandry and mineral extraction (Hailey and Leffler
2009).
History closer to the project area involves the City of Somerville and local ranching. The
City of Somerville was established as a railroad town on the GCSF in the 1890s, and was
quickly adopted as the home for the Texas Tie and Lumber Preserving Company; the crosstie yard remains (under different ownership) to the present (Jackson 2009). From 1962 to
1967, USACE constructed the Somerville Dam on Yegua Creek, impounding Somerville Lake
(Jackson 2009). In addition to the Somerville tie yard, ranching and farming were the main
staples of local economy. According to USACE Ranger Bill Keienburg, the Neinast Ranch,
once a large local land-holder, was the primary owner of the areas that are now part of Yegua
Creek and Rocky Creek parks during much of the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries

Chapter 3

Methods
Joel Butler and Emory Worrell conducted the archeological field inventory over four workdays
(September 28âOctober 1, 2009). Methods and density of shovel testing complied with or
exceeded the minimum requirements for field tactics stipulated by the THC for archeological
inventories in Texas.

3.1	Survey Tactics
For each parcel, transects were visually inspected in 30-m intervals the whole of the parcel.
Shovel tests were dug at a base rate of one per two acres, exceeding THC standards of one test
per three acres for project areas exceeding 101 acres. While approximately even coverage was
attempted, surveyors deviated from transect alignments in order to shovel test and visually
inspect high-probability locations. Tests were selectively placed on landforms shown by
previous research to be preferred site locations (i.e. ridgelines, knolls, and promontories).
Areas of obvious deep disturbance, (blading, bulldozing, trenching, etc.) were excluded from
shovel testing. Recent trash debris was commonly observed. No further attention was paid to
items clearly less than 50 years old.
At all shovel tests, GPS coordinates were recorded along with findings. All shovel tests were 30
cm in diameter. All tests were dug to the bottom of the Holocene deposits as indicated by clay,
or to 80 cmbs if no clay or the water table was present. Tests were individually recorded with
regard to depth, soil type and color, and cultural material present. Tests were dug in arbitrary
20-cm levels and all excavated material was screened through Â¼-inch (6.4 mm) wire mesh.
All cultural material within shovel tests was inspected, described and/or photographed, and
reburied. No artifacts were collected. All shovel tests were backfilled. Appendix A presents
aerial photographs of each survey parcel showing the locations of all shovel tests. Appendix B
contains shovel test results.
Each positive shovel test was further investigated by excavating additional shovel tests in
the immediate vicinity at 5â15-m distances for up to six tests in an area where possible (i.e.
not restricted by project area or water). If more than one of these tests were positive or if
more than two artifacts were found in any single test, then the location was designated as
an archeological site. Otherwise, the positive test was designated as an isolated occurrence.
The recorded locations of previously recorded sites were similarly investigated using multiple
shovel tests.
Site boundaries were to be delineated by excavating multiple shovel tests in the area to identify
zones of zero or low artifact presence. These were to be in cardinal directions from the initial
positive test, unless topography suggested an alternative tactic. Site boundaries would be
defined on the basis of subsurface artifact distribution, complemented by surface artifacts and

features (where present), topography, soil exposures, and other relevant criteria. Based on the
distribution of negative shovel tests or absence of surface artifacts, site boundaries were drawn
on UTM-gridded aerial photographs. Sites were to be photographed, sketched, and mapped,
and all site data recorded onto State of Texas site data forms. Artifacts, notes, and records will
be curated at EComm in Austin, Texas.

3.2	Density of Shovel Testing
The contractual scope of work issued by the USACE specified that at a minimum one shovel
test per three acres was to be excavated. Using this rate of coverage, a minimum of 41 shovel
tests was required to inventory the five parcels. In total, 77 shovel tests were dug, or 36 more
(46%) than the required minimum. For the project as a whole, shovel test coverage was 1.6
tests per acre.

Chapter 4

Results
In total, approximately 123.5 acres were inventoried in ten parcels within Yegua Creek and
Rocky Creek parks. No archeological sites were documented or revisited. Other than modern
park improvements, no standing structures were present. Broken chert and burned rocks
were encountered in several shovel tests, but following further tests, these were found to be
associated with land-clearing, brush-burning, or general camping activities. No artifacts were
noted above or below the surface at any of the study areas.

4.1	Yegua Creek Park
4.1.1 Area 1
The parcel denoted as Area 1 is composed of 7 unimproved acres in Yegua Creek Park south of
the attendantâs booth (see Figure 2). The parcel was found to be heavily eroded from previous
all-terrain vehicle traffic, now halted (Figure 3; Bill Keineburg, personal communication 2009).
Soils within the parcel were Burlewash fine sandy loam and Silawa loamy fine sand. Area 1 was
inventoried using four shovel tests, for a net density of 0.57 shovel tests per acre (see Appendices
A and B). All shovel tests were negative and reached precultural clays at depths of 20â60 cmbs
except Shovel Test (ST) 4, which attained a depth of 80 cmbs in sand. No cultural artifacts were

observed within this parcel above or below the surface. The surface of the parcel has been
largely disturbed by road construction and erosion.

4.1.2 Area 2
Area 2 (12.6 acres) is located on the northern end of Yegua Creek Park (see Figure 2). The area
contains 41 campsites, several paved roads, and two restroom facilities. The northern edge of
the parcel is bound by a steep slope down to the Somerville Lake shoreline, which once was
a high overlook of Yegua Creek, 1,150 m to the north. According to ranger Bill Keienburg
(personal communication, 2009), a 1992 high water event on Somerville Lake induced
massive erosion along the lakeâs shoreline, which removed much of the original overlook.
USACE has performed major revetment work to halt mass wasting along the lakeshore within
the area. The surface had been visibly
altered by burrowing animals (moles)
and campground and related facility
construction (Figure 4). Soils within
Area 2 were Silawa loamy fine sand.
Nine shovel tests were recorded
within Area 2, for a rate of 0.71
tests per acre, with depths of 20â100
cmbs. Seven of the nine shovel tests
were found to be disturbed, while
two were negative. ST 8 recovered
several broken chert fragments, thus
necessitating further tests surrounding
it. These tests (STs 10, 11, and 12) all
encountered road fill gravels, blended
soil columns, and large, intact chunks
of very well-preserved charcoal.
These indicators, plus the fact that
the broken chert fragments were not
obvious cultural artifacts (debitage,
flakes, tools, etc.), all point to modern
disturbance from park road and
campsite construction and possible
brush-clearing. No cultural artifacts
were recovered above or below the
surface within Area 2.

4.1.3 Area 3
Area 3 (21.1 acres) is located on a peninsula jutting into Somerville Lake over the submerged
channel of Yegua Creek, 1,100 m north (see Figure 2). As in Area 2, the original shoreline and
overlook have been heavily eroded (Figure 5) and no longer reflect the original landform. At
14

the time of survey, Area 3 contained 40 campsites with several paved roads and parking lots,
one boat ramp, and two restroom facilities. The north and eastern sides of the area are bound by
Somerville Lake. Surface disturbances noted included facility construction, landscaping, erosion,
and animal (mole) burrowing (Figure 6). Soils within the parcel consist of Silawa series loamy
fine sands. Eleven shovel tests were dug in the area, for a total of 0.52 tests per acre. Five of the

shovel tests were found to be disturbed, with the remainder negative. Shovel tests within
undisturbed contexts found sand to depths exceeding 80 cmbs, except in ST 21, which
encountered precultural clay at 20 cmbs. No cultural artifacts were noted above or below the
surface within Area 3.

4.2	Rocky Creek Park
4.2.1 Area A
Area A (9.8 acres) is located within Rocky Creek Park, 1,000 m west of Yegua Creek Park
across the submerged channel of Rocky Creek, which forms a cove between the two parks
(see Figure 2). Area A is located on the east side of the park over the submerged Rocky Creek
channel. Area A contains 30 campsites and is dominated by a stand of large live oak trees
(Figure 7). The area has been extensively landscaped, but the soil column appeared to be intact,
although there is evidence of active erosion resulting from pluvial activities. Soils within the
parcel consisted of Burlewash fine sandy loam soils. Five shovel tests were dug throughout the
parcel (0.5 tests per acre); all were negative. All shovel tests encountered precultural clays at
depths varying from 5 to 30 cmbs. No cultural materials were noted above or below the surface
within Area A.

4.2.2 Area B
Area B (7.1 acres) is located on the west side of Rocky Creek Park over the submerged channel
of Salty Creek, a small tributary to Yegua Creek (see Figure 2). Area B was closed to the public
at the time of survey, but contains one central road, 14 campsites, and several parking areas.
The surface of Area B was largely landscaped and bladed for campsite and road construction,
and lake erosion had apparently consumed some of the shoreline (Figure 8). Prehistoric site
41WT23 is documented directly east of Area B, but no sign of the site was noted within
the project area. Soils within Area B were Burlewash fine sandy loam and Falba fine sandy
loam. Four shovel tests were dug in Area B (0.57 tests per acre), all of which were negative.
Precultural clays were encountered at depths of 40â50 cmbs throughout the area. No cultural
artifacts were observed above or below the surface of Area B.

4.2.3 Area C
Area C (6.1 acres) is located on the east side of Rocky Creek Park over the submerged
channel of Rocky Creek (see Figure 2). Area C contains one central loop road, seven
campsites, a restroom facility, a large pavilion, and several parking areas (Figure 9). Ranger
Bill Keienburg (personal communication, 2009) stated that there had been two oil wells
located within the center of Area C, now removed, the construction and removal of which
created a large bowl-shaped depression across the center of the area. Soils in Area C are of

Burlewash fine sandy loam. Three shovel tests were dug (one test per two acres) within the area
in locations least likely to have been extensively disturbed by park construction and petroleum
extraction activities. All three shovel tests were negative and encountered precultural clay
either at the surface or very shallowly within the test. This indicates a truncated soil column
across the area, most likely the result of smoothing and landscaping. No cultural artifacts were
observed above or below the surface of Area C.

4.2.4 Area D
Area D (12.7 acres) is located north of Area C on the east side of Rocky Creek Park over the
submerged channel of Rocky Creek (see Figure 2). Area D contains one central loop road, 40
campsites, a restroom facility, and several parking areas. Disturbances noted were results of park
construction and landscaping activities (Figure 10). Soils in Area C are of Tremona loamy fine
sand and Tabor fine sandy loam. Nine shovel tests were excavated within the area, for coverage
of 0.7 tests per acre. Five tests were negative and encountered precultural clays at depths of
20â40 cmbs. The remaining four tests were determined to contain disturbed sediments. ST 38
contained several non-artifact fragments of brown chert, which entailed several more tests to
be performed in the immediate vicinity. STs 39 and 40 both encountered disturbed soils and
modern trash at depths exceeding 60 cmbs, further demonstrating the disturbed nature of ST
38. The remains of a modern concrete slab structure containing chert gravels 15 m north of the
tests was determined to be the likely source of chert noted in ST 38. No cultural artifacts were
observed above or below the surface of Area D.

4.2.5 Area E
Area E (16.1 acres) is located north of Area D on the east side of Rocky Creek Park over
the submerged channel of Rocky Creek (see Figure 2). Area E contains two loop roads, 33
campsites, a restroom facility, and several parking areas. Soils in Area E are of Falba fine sandy
loam. Nine shovel tests were excavated within the area, for coverage of 0.56 tests per acre. All
tests were negative and encountered precultural clays at depths of 20â80 cmbs. No cultural
artifacts were observed above or below the surface of Area E.

4.2.6 Area F
Area F (4.2 acres) is located west of Area E on the west side of Rocky Creek Park, 1,000 m
southeast of the submerged channel of Yegua Creek (see Figure 2). Area F contains a central
loop road, 29 campsites, a restroom facility, and several parking areas. Soils in Area F are of
Falba fine sandy loam. Three shovel tests were dug within the area, for coverage of 0.71 tests
per acre. Two of the tests were negative and encountered precultural clays at depths of 20â60
cmbs, while the third test was found to contain modern trash to depths of at least 30 cmbs. No
cultural artifacts were observed above or below the surface of Area D.

4.2.7 Area G
At 26.8 acres, Area F is the largest survey parcel of the project. Located on the tip of the
peninsula jutting between Rocky Creek and Salty Creek, Area G is located 950 m southeast
of the submerged channel of Yegua Creek (see Figure 2). Area G contains eight roads, 44
campsites, two restroom facilities, and seven designated parking areas (Figure 11). Soils in
Area F are of Falba fine sandy loam. Twenty shovel tests were excavated within the area, for
coverage of 0.75 tests per acre. Fourteen of the tests were negative and encountered precultural
clays at depths of 10â60 cmbs. ST 55 encountered 10 pieces of fractured (non-artifact) chert
and three pieces of burned sandstone at depths varying from 20 to 100 cmbs. Six more tests
(STs 61, 62, 63, 64, 75, 76, and 77) were excavated in the vicinity to test the presence of an
archeological site. Two of the exploration tests (STs 61 and 76) were negative. The other tests
all contained evidence of modern disturbance, namely saw-cut bone (in good condition) to
depths of 80 cmbs and a fragment of barbed wire at 70 cmbs. These results (modern debris,
burned rock, non-artifactual fractured chert) imply that the additional tests were located within
disturbed deposits, most likely from initial land-clearing for that portion of the park. No cultural
artifacts were observed above or below the surface of Area D.

Summary and Recommendation
On September 28âOctober 1, 2009, archeologists from EComm performed an intensive cultural
resource inventory at Somerville Lake in Washington County, Texas. This cultural resources
inventory investigated ten parcels totaling 123.5 acres at Yegua Creek and Rocky Creek parks.
Field methods included a pedestrian survey at 30-m intervals accompanied by excavation of
77 shovel tests. Shovel tests were approximately 30 cm in diameter and were dug to either
precultural clay horizons or to 80 cmbs. Overall testing density for the project was 0.62 tests
per acre.
No cultural artifacts were noted within the survey areas. No intact historic building or structure
greater than 50 years old or prehistoric archeological sites were present in any of the inventory
areas. EComm recommends that park improvements proceed with no further archeological
investigations.
