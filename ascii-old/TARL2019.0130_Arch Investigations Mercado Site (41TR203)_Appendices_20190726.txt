RE: Radiocarbon Dating Results For Samples 41TR203.L13.02, 41TR203.L16.01, 41TR203.L22.04,
41TR203.L28.05, 41TR203.L33.06
Dear Dr. Shipp:
Enclosed are the radiocarbon dating results for five samples recently sent to us. They each
provided plenty of carbon for accurate measurements and all the analyses proceeded normally. The report
sheet contains the dating result, method used, material type, applied pretreatment and two-sigma calendar
calibration result (where applicable) for each sample.
This report has been both mailed and sent electronically, along with a separate publication quality
calendar calibration page. This is useful for incorporating directly into your reports. It is also digitally
available in Windows metafile (.wmf) format upon request. Calibrations are calculated using the newest
(2009) calibration database. References are quoted on the bottom of each calibration page. Multiple
probability ranges may appear in some cases, due to short-term variations in the atmospheric 14C
contents at certain time periods. Examining the calibration graphs will help you understand this
phenomenon. Calibrations may not be included with all analyses. The upper limit is about 42,000 years,
the lower limit is about 250 years and some material types are not suitable for calibration (e.g. water).
We analyzed these samples on a sole priority basis. No students or intern researchers who would
necessarily be distracted with other obligations and priorities were used in the analyses. We analyzed
them with the combined attention of our entire professional staff.
Thank you for prepaying the analyses. As always, if you have any questions or would like to
discuss the results, don’t hesitate to contact me.
Sincerely,

RE: Radiocarbon Dating Result For Sample 41TR203.F23
Dear Dr. Shipp:
Enclosed is the radiocarbon dating result for one sample recently sent to us. As usual, specifics of
the analysis are listed on the report with the result and calibration data is provided where applicable. The
Conventional Radiocarbon Age has been corrected for total fractionation effects and where applicable,
calibration was performed using 2013 calibration databases (cited on the graph pages).
The web directory containing the table of results and PDF download also contains pictures, a cvs
spreadsheet download option and a quality assurance report containing expected vs. measured values for
3-5 working standards analyzed simultaneously with your samples.
The reported result is accredited to ISO-17025 standards and all pretreatments and chemistry
were performed here in our laboratories and counted in our own accelerators here in Miami. Since Beta is
not a teaching laboratory, only graduates trained to strict protocols of the ISO-17025 program participated
in the analysis.
As always Conventional Radiocarbon Ages and sigmas are rounded to the nearest 10 years per
the conventions of the 1977 International Radiocarbon Conference. When counting statistics produce
sigmas lower than +/- 30 years, a conservative +/- 30 BP is cited for the result.
When interpreting the result, please consider any communications you may have had with us
regarding the sample. As always, your inquiries are most welcome. If you have any questions or would
like further details of the analysis, please do not hesitate to contact us.
The cost of the analysis was charged to the American Express card provided. Thank you. As
always, if you have any questions or would like to discuss the results, don’t hesitate to contact me.

Quality Assurance Report
This report provides the results of reference materials used to validate radiocarbon analyses prior to reporting.
Known
value reference materials were analyzed quasi-simultaneously with the unknowns. Results are reported as expected values
vs measured values. Reported values are calculated relative to NIST SRM -4990B and corrected for isotopic fractionation.
Results are reported using the direct analytical measure percent modern carbon (pMC) with one relative standard deviation.

Dear Dr. Shipp:
Enclosed are the radiocarbon dating results for 25 samples recently sent to us. As usual, the
method of analysis is listed on the report with the results and calibration data is provided where
applicable. The Conventional Radiocarbon Ages have all been corrected for total fractionation effects
and where applicable, calibration was performed using 2013 calibration databases (cited on the graph
pages).
The web directory containing the table of results and PDF download also contains pictures, a cvs
spreadsheet download option and a quality assurance report containing expected vs. measured values for
3-5 working standards analyzed simultaneously with your samples.
Reported results are accredited to ISO/IEC 17025:2005 Testing Accreditation PJLA #59423
standards and all chemistry was performed here in our laboratories and counted in our own accelerators
here in Miami. Since Beta is not a teaching laboratory, only graduates trained to strict protocols of the
ISO/IEC 17025:2005 Testing Accreditation PJLA #59423 program participated in the analyses.
As always Conventional Radiocarbon Ages and sigmas are rounded to the nearest 10 years per
the conventions of the 1977 International Radiocarbon Conference. When counting statistics produce
sigmas lower than +/- 30 years, a conservative +/- 30 BP is cited for the result.
When interpreting the results, please consider any communications you may have had with us
regarding the samples. As always, your inquiries are most welcome. If you have any questions or would
like further details of the analyses, please do not hesitate to contact us.
Thank you for prepaying the analyses. As always, if you have any questions or would like to
discuss the results, don’t hesitate to contact me.
Sincerely,

Digital signature on file

RE: Radiocarbon Dating Results For Samples 41TR203.L13.02, 41TR203.L16.01, 41TR203.L22.04,
41TR203.L28.05, 41TR203.L33.06
Dear Dr. Shipp:
Enclosed are the radiocarbon dating results for five samples recently sent to us. They each
provided plenty of carbon for accurate measurements and all the analyses proceeded normally. The report
sheet contains the dating result, method used, material type, applied pretreatment and two-sigma calendar
calibration result (where applicable) for each sample.
This report has been both mailed and sent electronically, along with a separate publication quality
calendar calibration page. This is useful for incorporating directly into your reports. It is also digitally
available in Windows metafile (.wmf) format upon request. Calibrations are calculated using the newest
(2009) calibration database. References are quoted on the bottom of each calibration page. Multiple
probability ranges may appear in some cases, due to short-term variations in the atmospheric 14C
contents at certain time periods. Examining the calibration graphs will help you understand this
phenomenon. Calibrations may not be included with all analyses. The upper limit is about 42,000 years,
the lower limit is about 250 years and some material types are not suitable for calibration (e.g. water).
We analyzed these samples on a sole priority basis. No students or intern researchers who would
necessarily be distracted with other obligations and priorities were used in the analyses. We analyzed
them with the combined attention of our entire professional staff.
Thank you for prepaying the analyses. As always, if you have any questions or would like to
discuss the results, don’t hesitate to contact me.
Sincerely,

Digital signature on file

RE: Radiocarbon Dating Results
Dear Ms. Canavan,
Enclosed are the radiocarbon dating results for seven samples recently sent to us. The report sheet contains the
Conventional Radiocarbon Age (BP), the method used, material type, and applied pretreatments, any sample specific comments
and, where applicable, the two-sigma calendar calibration range. The Conventional Radiocarbon ages have been corrected for
total isotopic fractionation effects (natural and laboratory induced).
All results (excluding some inappropriate material types) which fall within the range of available calibration data are calibrated
to calendar years (cal BC/AD) and calibrated radiocarbon years (cal BP). Calibration was calculated using one of the databases
associated with the 2013 INTCAL program (cited in the references on the bottom of the calibration graph page provided for each
sample.) Multiple probability ranges may appear in some cases, due to short-term variations in the atmospheric 14C contents at
certain time periods. Looking closely at the calibration graph provided and where the BP sigma limits intercept the calibration
curve will help you understand this phenomenon.
Conventional Radiocarbon Ages and sigmas are rounded to the nearest 10 years per the conventions of the 1977
International Radiocarbon Conference. When counting statistics produce sigmas lower than +/- 30 years, a conservative +/- 30
BP is cited for the result.
All work on these samples was performed in our laboratories in Miami under strict chain of custody and quality control under
ISO/IEC 17025:2005 Testing Accreditation PJLA #59423 accreditation protocols. Sample, modern and blanks were all analyzed
in the same chemistry lines by qualified professional technicians using identical reagents and counting parameters within our
own particle accelerators. A quality assurance report is posted to your directory for each result.
Our invoice will be emailed separately. Please forward it to the appropriate officer or send a credit card authorization. Thank
you. As always, if you have any questions or would like to discuss the results, don’t hesitate to contact us.
Sincerely ,

Results are ISO/IEC-17025:2005 accredited. No sub-contracting or student labor was used in the analyses. All work was done at Beta in 4 in-house NEC accelerator mass
spectrometers and 4 Thermo IRMSs. The "Conventional Radiocarbon Age" was calculated using the Libby half -life (5568 years), is corrected for total isotopic fraction and was
used for calendar calibration where applicable. The Age is rounded to the nearest 10 years and is reported as radiocarbon years before present (BP), “present" = AD 1950.
Results greater than the modern reference are reported as percent modern carbon (pMC). The modern reference standard was 95% the 14C signature of NIST SRM-4990C
(oxalic acid). Quoted errors are 1 sigma counting statistics. Calculated sigmas less than 30 BP on the Conventional Radiocarbon Age are conservatively rounded up to 30.
d13C values are on the material itself (not the AMS d13C). d13C and d15N values are relative to VPDB-1. References for calendar calibrations are cited at the bottom of
calibration graph pages.

Results greater than the modern reference are reported as percent modern carbon (pMC). The modern reference standard was 95% the 14C signature of NIST SRM-4990C
(oxalic acid). Quoted errors are 1 sigma counting statistics. Calculated sigmas less than 30 BP on the Conventional Radiocarbon Age are conservatively rounded up to 30.
d13C values are on the material itself (not the AMS d13C). d13C and d15N values are relative to VPDB-1. References for calendar calibrations are cited at the bottom of

Quality Assurance Report
This report provides the results of reference materials used to validate radiocarbon analyses prior to reporting. Known-value
reference materials were analyzed quasi-simultaneously with the unknowns. Results are reported as expected values vs
measured values. Reported values are calculated relative to NIST SRM -4990B and corrected for isotopic fractionation. Results
are reported using the direct analytical measure percent modern carbon (pMC) with one relative standard deviation. Agreement
between expected and measured values is taken as being within 2 sigma agreement (error x 2) to account for total laboratory
error.

Introduction
Seven flotation samples and one radiocarbon sample from Site 41TR203 were
submitted for identification and analysis of plant remains. The seven flotation samples
represent 20.65 cubic decimeters of soil matrix from six excavation units.
Site setting
Site 41TR203 is located on the floodplain of the West Fork of the Trinity River
east of the current I-35W bridge. Despite disturbance in the upper 30 centimeters, three
distinct prehistoric components were observed in testing (THC Site Forms 5/3/2005 and
6/22/2009).
Vegetation in the site area is currently a mowed field, but a much more dynamic
floodplain vegetation would have been in place prior to channelization of the Trinity
River. Not surprisingly, plants of riparian zones tend to tolerate flooding and other
disturbances better than their upland counterparts. A great many species may share the
canopy in a floodplain forest, and “dominance is absent or poorly defined” (Lee
1945:163). Common trees of the Trinity River area include willows (Salix spp.),
cottonwood (Populus deltoides), elms (Ulmus spp.), hackberry (Celtis spp.), ashes
(Fraxinus spp.), various types of oaks (Quercus spp.), pecan and other hickories (Carya
spp.), roughleaf dogwood (Cornus drummondii), boxelder (Acer negundo), sedges,
grasses, and forbs (Bezanson 2000:115). Floodplains also support useful vines such as
grapes (Vitis spp.) and Virginia creeper (Parthenocissus quinquefolia). Oxbows, sloughs,
marshes, and other wetlands associated with the Trinity River offer plant resources such
as cattail (Typha spp.) and aquatic tubers or rhizomes including arrowhead (Sagittaria
spp.) and spatterdock (Nuphar lutea).
Upland vegetation would have been very different from riparian vegetation in
prehistoric times. Tarrant County lies in the Fort Worth Prairie section of the Cross
Timbers and Prairies vegetation area, where upland vegetation protected from modern
human impacts is a mixed-grass prairie characterized by grasses such as little bluestem
(Schizachyrium scoparius), Indiangrass (Sorghastrum nutans), side-oats grama
(Bouteloua curtipendula) and forbs (Bezanson 2000:115-116; Diggs et al. 1999:52-53).
Mean annual precipitation in Tarrant County during the period 1951-1980 was
31.3 inches (795 mm). Precipitation has a unimodal distribution, peaking in April and
May followed by a dry summer. The frost-free season in Tarrant County today averages
230 days and runs from March 26 through November 11 (NFIC 1987:465-466).

Methods
Flotation samples were processed in a modified version of the TAS Field School
method (Bush 2012, 2013). The manual (bucket) flotation used bottom (heavy fraction)
mesh with square openings of 1.0 mm and top (light fraction) mesh with triangular

2

openings of 0.3 x 0.3 x 0.5 mm. Light fractions were skimmed from the water surface
rather than poured off. As recommended by Gail Wagner, 100 carbonized poppy seeds
(Papaver somniferum) were added to two of the seven flotation samples prior to
processing to assess small seed recovery rates (Wagner 1982). Poppy seeds are used
because they are readily available, not native to the study area, and at about 1.0 mm long
they approximate the mean size of wild seeds in North America. In the laboratory, 86
poppy seeds were recovered from one sample and 88 from the other. This is comparable
to recovery rates reported for the Incinerator (Sunwatch) Machine using 0.59 mm bottom
mesh (Wagner 1982), the Illinois Department of Transportation (IDOT) manual system
using 0.5 mm bottom mesh (Hunter and Gassner 1998), and the Flot-Tech Machine at
Indiana University using 1.0 mm bottom mesh (Bush 2001). Recovery rates for this
project are well above rates reported for IDOT projects and the Incinerator Machine with
1.0 bottom mesh (Wagner 1982). Recovery rates in the 90s have been occasionally
reported for manual flotation systems (Bush 2013) and machines with 0.6 mm bottom
mesh (Bush 2001, 2013; Hunter and Gassner 1998).
Plant material from the light fractions was transferred to Macrobotanical Analysis
in December 2013, where sorting and analysis took place in December 2013 and January
2014. The flotation samples were sorted according to standard procedures (Pearsall
2000). Light fractions were weighed on an Ohaus Scout II 200 x 0.01 g electronic
balance before being size-sorted through a stack of graduated geologic mesh. Carbonized
botanical materials that did not pass through the No. 10 mesh (2 mm square openings)
were completely sorted, counted, weighed, recorded, and labeled. Uncarbonized plant
parts and all non-botanical material in this size fraction are referred to as
“contamination”. At Site 41TR203, contamination consisted of rootlets, gastropods, grass
leaves, and bits of modern plastic. Materials that fell through the 2 mm mesh (“residue”)
were examined under a stereoscopic microscope at 7-45 X magnification for carbonized
botanical remains other than those present in the larger size fraction (in this case, wood
charcoal). Identifiable material was removed from residue, counted, weighed, recorded,
and labeled. Uncarbonized seeds in the light fraction were identified and recorded on a
presence/absence basis on laboratory forms. Contamination and residue were weighed,
recorded, and labeled only.
For each flotation sample, wood charcoal fragments were selected at random from
those larger than 2 mm until 20 fragments were examined (or all fragments in cases
where fewer than 20 were present). When no wood charcoal was present in the larger size
fraction, identification was attempted for smaller pieces (Lots 7, 24, and 27), but these
could usually be identified only as “hardwood”. The softwood from Lot 7 could be
assigned to the genus Juniperus (juniper, also called cedar) because there are only two
reasonable softwood possibilities for Tarrant County, one coarse-textured (Taxodium;
baldcypress) and one fine-textured (Juniperus). Fragments were snapped to reveal a clean
transverse section and examined under a stereoscopic microscope at 28-180 X
magnification. When necessary, tangential or radial sections were examined for ray
seriation, presence of spiral thickenings, types and sizes of intervessel pitting, and other
minute characteristics that can only be seen at the higher magnifications of this range.

3

All samples were subject to radiocarbon protocols during identification to retain
suitability for radiocarbon dating. Samples were sorted on freshly washed glassware and
handled only with vinyl gloves and metal forceps. Contact with paper and other plant
products was avoided
Botanical materials were identified to the lowest possible taxonomic level by
comparison to materials in the Macrobotanical Analysis comparative collection and
through the use of standard reference works (e.g., Core et al. 1979; Davis 1993; Hoadley
1990; Martin and Barkley 1961; Musil 1963; Panshin and de Zeeuw 1980). Plant
nomenclature follows the PLANTS Database (USDA, NRCS 2014).
Results and Discussion
Plant materials recovered from Site 41TR203 samples are given in Tables 11.2.18. The tables include count and weights of carbonized plants from the flotation samples
as well as identification of the radiocarbon sample. Weights for the residue and
contamination fractions of the flotation light fractions are provided, and uncarbonzied
seeds are shown on a presence/absence basis.
Uncarbonized plant remains
Most uncarbonized plant parts at Site 41TR203 appear in the form of rootlets and
grass stems and are clearly related to the modern vegetation at the site. Uncarbonized
seeds are shown on a presence/absence basis in Table 11.2. Uncarbonized seeds are a
common occurrence on most archeological sites, but they usually represent seeds of
modern plants that have made their way into the soil either through their own dispersal
mechanisms or by faunalturbation, floralturbation, or argilliturbation (Bryant 1985:51-52;
Miksicek 1987:231-232). In all except the driest areas of North America, uncarbonized
plant material on open-air sites can be assumed to be of modern origin unless compelling
evidence suggests otherwise (Lopinot and Brussell 1982; Miksicek 1987:231). The seeds
at Site 41TR203 consist primarily of grass seeds almost certainly relating to the current
vegetation on the site. The four other seed taxa present are weedy colonizers that are
common in modern lawns and grassy fields. All uncarbonized plant parts, including
seeds, are interpreted here as modern.

Carbonized plants
Wood charcoal was the only plant type found that was not clearly related to
modern vegetation or methods testing. (As discussed above, carbonized poppy seeds
were added to two flotation samples to assess flotation processing.) Seventy-eight wood
charcoal fragments were recovered (3.37 g), with identification attempted for 63
fragments, of which 45 could be identified to the level of the botanical genus or species.
Identifiable wood consisted mostly of genus Ulmus (n=16; probably cedar elm, U.
crassifolia) and genus Acer (n= 15; probably boxelder, A. negundo). A legume (n=6;
probably honeylocust [Gleditsia triacanthos] or redbud [Cercis canadensis]) and various

4

oaks (Quercus spp.; n=6) were present, with elbowbush (Forestiera pubescens; n=1), and
juniper (Juniperus sp.; n=1) also represented. Most of these trees are typical floodplain
species and would have been readily available in the site area during most of the
Holocene. Juniper is associated with upland habitats today, but in prehistoric times it
would have been more common in canyons and along rivers where it was protected from
fires. One of the oaks, Quercus fusiformis (plateau live oak), is more typically an upland
species but can often be found on river terraces.
Summary
Archeological plant remains from Site 41TR203 consisted of solely of wood
charcoal. The trees represented are almost exclusively floodplain species (boxelder and
cedar elm) that would have been present in the immediate site area.

Results of Faunal Analysis, 41TR203 Testing, ACI consulting project number 12-13027, Task Order 1

Dear Dr. Scott,
TRC provides this letter report of the Faunal Analysis of Site 41TR203 material recovered
during Archeological Testing by aci consulting (ACI) in keeping with Task Order 1. The site was
discovered during environmental review of the North Tarrant Expressway (NTE) Project in Fort
Worth, Tarrant County, Texas. Archeological site 41TR203 was located along the West Fork
Trinity River. Testing efforts at the site confirmed that the site is National Register of Historic
Places (NRHP) and State Archeological Landmark (SAL) eligible. Cultural materials were
encountered to a depth of 150 centimeters below the surface (cmbs), and at least three occupation
zones were identified to a depth of approximately 120 cmbs.
Results
Animal bones recovered from 41TR203 during testing by ACI were analyzed. All bones were
identified through use of the analyst’s private faunal collection, use of loan specimens from the
University of Tennessee’s Department of Anthropology’s Vertebrate Comparative Skeletal
Collection, and assorted identification manuals (Balkwill and Cumbaa 1992, Jacobson 2004).
Taxonomic classification for mammals follows Schmidly (1994).
As not all of the animal bone was identifiable beyond class, size categories were used to
differentiate the various bones for analytical purposes. The categories included large mammal
(e.g., bison, cattle, horse, etc.), medium-large mammal (e.g., deer, antelope, pig, etc.), medium
mammal (e.g., dog, raccoon, etc.), small mammal (e.g., rabbit, prairie dog, opossum, etc.), and

very small mammal (e.g., wood rat, hispid cotton rat, vole, etc.).
The total vertebrate number of identified specimens (NISP) recovered from the site during
testing was 1073, of which 1060 (98.8%) were identifiable to class. The dominate class of
vertebrate represented in the assemblages was mammal accounting for 1059 (99.9%) of
the bones identifiable to class. Amphibians, with 1 bone (0.1%) identifiable to class,
accounted for the only other class of remains present. A detailed account of taxa identified
and the NISP for each taxa are listed in Table 1. The minimum number of individuals
(MNI) for most taxa recovered from the site is 1. The only exception is Odocoileus sp.
(deer) with an MNI of 3.

Data collected in addition to identification of element and species included any human
modification to the bone (i.e., cuts, chops, other modification such as percussion points for bone
fracturing, or thermal alteration) and any taphonomic alterations (i.e., carnivore or rodent
gnawing or evidence for consumption, root etching, and degree of weathering of the bone)
Additionally, any characteristics on the bone identifying an animal’s age (e.g., epiphyseal
union, tooth eruption or wear, etc.) or sex (e.g., antlers, morphometric characteristics, etc.) were
recorded if present.
Overall, cut marks were identifiable on 4 bones, chop marks on 1 bone, 4 bones had evidence for
other human modification such as percussion points for bone fracturing, and a total of 53 bones
had been thermally modified. Of the burned bone, 34 had some browning, 9 were blackened, and
10 had been calcined. Brown discoloration is indicative of short-term and lower heat burning,
such as exposure to a grass fire or camp fire for less than 6 minutes (Lyman 1994). Blackened
bone has been carbonized and would indicate prolonged exposure to a grass fire or camp fire.
Grey and white bone has been fully calcined, which means that it has lost all organic matter and
become plastically deformed. Some of the brown thermal alteration is similar to that the analyst
has seen on other assemblages such as 41DL436. The browning in that instance was indicative
of an indirect heat source, such as a heated rock, that had been placed on green bone searing it
and causing micro-fractures while weakening the bone. The hypothesis was that this facilitated
easier bone breakage for marrow extraction on long bones.
There was only minor evidence for carnivore modification (n=5) and no evidence for rodent
gnawing of the bone. Some human and animal modifications, however, may have been obscured
due to high root etching on the bone. While specific numbers were not recorded, the majority of
the bone exhibited extensive root etching.
The bones were examined for signs of breakage and weathering. Fifteen bones (1.4% of the
assemblage) were complete and unbroken. The degree of weathering to which a bone had been
subjected was recorded for each bone. Degree of weathering was recorded following Lyman’s
(1994) synthesis of Behrensmeyer (1978), Andrews (1990), and Johnson (1985). The weathering
scale consisted of rankings from 0 to 5 where 0 equals a bone with some flesh still attached and 5
would be a bone with large splinters which is disintegrating. Typically, all archeological material
would be minimally assigned a 2 or 3 ranking. The majority (n=1052, 98%) of the bone
recovered from 41TR203 was assigned a ranking of 3. Only 31 bones were assigned to a ranking
of 4. Additionally, while most of the bone exhibited a break of some kind, the fragments were in
general larger and more identifiable as is evidenced by the low ratio of bones assigned as
indeterminate vertebrate
Recommendations
Given the preservation and overall ability to identify and quantify the remains, further research at
the site is recommended. While species diversity at the site was very low, with a high
concentration of focus on deer-sized and bison-sized artiodactyls, there is still research potential

at the site. The presence of bison, and the timeframe for its availability and use are still relatively
unknown in the North Texas area due to poor preservation in the region. While not diverse, the
preservation of the bone is good and the potential to identify the presence of bison and
antelopewithin a stratified and datable context could supplement recent information from other
nearby sites, such as the Fish Creek Slough Site (41DL436) in Dallas County. Notably, while
bison and antelope (grassland species) were identified, none of the deer bone identifiable to
species was mule deer. Only white-tailed deer, a riparian and woodland species, was present. The
data would provide information on regional shifts in environmental conditions and regional
subsistence strategies, especially with regards to the presence of prairie versus woodland species.
Furthermore, the presence of browning on some of the bone at spiral fracture locations on the
bone is potentially indicative of intentional localized heating of the bone to facilitate breakage
and marrow extraction. Further research and larger samples may provide additional support for
this butchering technique. Therefore, additional knowledge could be gained through further
recovery and analysis of faunal material from the site.

APPENDIX D
BURNED EARTH REPORT

Analysis of the Burnt Earth Assemblage Recovered from 41TR203
Charles D. Frederick
In most archeological reports one would expect that a report with this title would discuss
ceramics. That would be appropriate given that the English word “ceramic” derives from the
Greek word keramos which means “burnt earth” (McLaren and Cao 2009). But pottery is not the
subject of this chapter. Instead this section delves into the more mundane but substantially murkier
issue of burnt earth that is a common constituent of prehistoric occupation excavations,
especially common at sites situated on clayey sediment surfaces, which are debatable of human
agency. These objects, which may comprise a substantial collection all by themselves, are rarely
examined and reported in detail because they are often thought not to be intentional
artifacts, but rather incidental byproducts of human occupations. They are commonly counted
and weighed, and then summarily lumped into the category of things created by accident when
using hearths or other thermal features. A few studies plotted the spatial distribution of burned
clay with respect to other artifacts (e.g., Gaddus et al. 2006) but this treatment is uncommon.
Indeed, the background literature search for this project identified almost no studies that
described and interpreted these burnt earth objects.
The objects in this assemblage are the subject of examination here in part because of petrographic
observations made during the geoarchaeological study conducted by Frederick and McKee (n.d.).
Of the few micromorphology samples examined during that study, one examined a fragment
of burnt earth in Feature 20 that upon microscopic evaluation appeared to not simply be burnt
site matrix, but rather tempered clay, which implies human agency in construction, not
merely incidental heating of the substrate as the object was anticipated to be when observed in
the field. The presence of baked clay with a clearly coarser textured temper resembled in some
ways fiber impressed fragments of burnt clay found at 41DL203 (Tinsley et al. 2011), although
examination of the morphology of the micromorphology sample was not possible.
The original research design for this study called for an assessment of the assemblage, comparison
with similar material from sites in Tarrant and surrounding counties, and then petrographic and
computer assisted tomographic (CAT scans) examination of a small number of specimens.
Owing to an advanced reporting timeline, the petrographic and CAT scans could not be
completed. What follows is a review of the effects of heat on earthen materials and substrates, a
brief discussion of types of burnt earth objects commonly found in Texas archaeology, and an
interpretive summary of the types of materials observed in the assemblage from 41TR203.
THE EFFECTS OF HEAT ON CLAYEY SEDIMENTS
The effects of heat on earthen materials, especially clay, are well understood. In a discussion of the
evidence of fire in the distant past, Aldeias (2017) differentiates between direct and indirect
combustion residues. Direct residues consist of those that are created by burning and comprise
things like ash, charcoal, siliceous aggregates of phytoliths, calcined bone or dung
spherules. Indirect combustion residues consist of things, artifacts or sediments, altered
by elevated temperatures associated with fire. Typical indirect proxies of fires include
thermally altered artifacts (lithics, bones, shells, seeds, etc.) or deposits (earthen materials
mixed with fuel, or the substrate beneath a fire that was heated by it). Granted, Aldeias’ goal was
to closely examine what

types of evidence can be used to identify human use of fire in the distant past (the Paleolithic), and
so she did not consider artifacts made by thermal alteration such as pottery. But one can easily
expand to include a third category, artifacts intentionally and directly exposed to heat, such as
pottery vessels and other nonvessel burnt clay objects such as figurines, pipes, and earspools.
The effects of heat on earthen materials have been widely and extensively documented, largely in
association with the production and analysis of pottery. Although it is possible to go into
considerable detail on this subject the two principal attributes worth considering here are changes
in color and changes in hardness. It is well known that heating of earthen materials often results in
color changes, be they rocks (e.g., Lintz 1989), concrete (Hager 2014), clay (Rice 2015) or earth
under hearths (Aldeias et al. 2016). The changes in color are typically either the development of
red color, black or both.
Color Changes: Reddening (aka Rubification)
It is widely accepted that the development of red color is due to the oxidation of iron-rich minerals,
specifically the transformation of goethite which is typically brown or yellow colored, to hematite
which is red (Canti and Linford 2000; Röpke and Dietl 2017), but as Mentzer (2014) notes, in
certain situations common iron minerals like goethite may transform to other minerals like
maghemite, which is black or brown, and substrates lacking iron minerals may not discolor at all.
Reddening (or Rubification) is one of the most common effects of heat on earthen materials and as
such it is often considered a proxy for the location of a fire when found in a deposit, be the source
of the fire a burnt tree stump, or a hearth. The development of a reddened layer under a hearth is
thought to be a function of the sediment texture, the maximum temperature and duration of the fire,
and the organic matter content of the deposit (Aldeias 2017; Aldeias et al. 2016; Canti and Linford
2000; Mallol et al. 2013).
The development of black color in some heated materials is thought to be due to incomplete
oxidation of organic matter (Backhouse et al. 2005; De Atley 1980; Lintz 1989), but as noted earlier
it could also indicate the production of maghemite.
Changes in Hardness
Beyond changes in color, heating induces hardening of the earth by sintering, and melting. Detailed
discussions of these changes can be found in numerous books on pottery (e.g., Rice 2015). Röpke
and Dietl (2017:174) define sintering as “the formation of a solid mass from a fine-grained
aggregate at temperatures below the melting point” and this occurs at lower temperatures than
melting which generally happens above 1300˚C (5432°F). It is hardening that undoubtedly draws
the attention of excavators who are often confronted with soil that will not pass through the screen
easily, and if an increase in hardness is accompanied by a color change, such materials are generally
declared to be burnt clay, regardless of the actual particle size of the material.

BURNT CLAY OBJECTS COMMONLY ENCOUNTERED IN TEXAS
ARCHAEOLOGY
As noted in the introduction, there are generally few details to be found on this class of possible
artifact in the literature. The exception to this generalization are burnt clay balls that were used as
a proxy for rock as thermal storage devices in cooking features in rock poor regions.
Clay Balls (aka Burned Clay Nodules, Burnt Clay Lumps, Baked Clay Balls)
There appear to be two regions of Texas where faux rocks such as these appear: the coast, and near
Dallas. The best known of these are along the Texas coast (Campbell 1976; Dockall and Black
2006; Patterson 1996; Ricklis and Albert 2005; Turpin 2004, 2014) where large numbers of fist
sized and smaller rounded burnt clay balls are found on occupation surfaces and in features.
Curiously, such objects are also known from the Dallas region, albeit perhaps less than the coastal
variety (Crook 2009; Lorrain 2012; Tinsley et al. 2011). The Texas version of this cooking
technology pale in comparison to those found at Poverty Point in Louisiana, where this approach
to cooking without rock approached an art. There, burnt clay was formed into distinct geometrical
shapes referred to as Poverty Point Objects that were then used to cook food (Hunter 1976).
Burnt Mud Plastered Thatch
A much less common form of burnt clay, and still very debatable are objects of burnt clay that are
fiber or grass impressed on one side. Such objects have been reported by Thurmond and
Kleinschmidt (1979:26–27) at the George C. Davis Site and by Tinsley et al. (2011) at 41DL203.
Although the origin of such objects is not entirely clear, it is likely that they represent burnt mud
plaster that had been applied to a grass thatched roof. Mud applied in this manner is intended to
make the roof resistant to leaking, and often had the side benefit of reducing the fire hazard of such
structures.
Vernacular houses with mud plastered thatch roofing have been described from various cultures
such as the Mojave in Arizona (Shufeldt 1892), Mississippian groups at Bynam Mounds (USDOI
2018), and as far afield as the Cholistan in Pakistan, and East India. Shufeldt (1892) described
houses made by the Mojave in Arizona that were timber framed houses with roofs thatched with
long prairie grass and plastered with a thick coat of mud. Gilchrist (1825:232–235) describes the
plastering of grass thatch roofs with mud as a protection against heavy rain as well as providing
protection from fire. Closer to Texas, the prehistoric houses documented at Bynam mounds near
Tupelo Mississippi have been described as circular timber houses with willow or reed stems woven
into them and then plastered with mud. And the Mill Creek Culture of Iowa lived in timber houses
with thatched grass roofing and clay/mud plaster (Larsen 2010).
THE BURNT EARTH ASSEMBLAGE AT 41TR203
The entire assemblage consisting of 144 lots, and slightly more than 3300 specimens was examined
in order to form an impression of the range of items present. The vast majority of these objects
were reddened, typically expressing a 7.5 YR Munsell hue, and some exhibited a carbon core (only
visible on those that had been broken or abraded; samples were not broken to check the interior
color). A few samples presented an achromatic gray color (clearly hardened but not red) but such

specimens were rare. All were fairly hard (no attempt was made to examine their resistance to
rupture).
While examining the burnt clay, notes were made on their shape and surface features. The vast
majority of these objects were variations on the form of blocks, with the most common shapes
resembling the soil structural form called subangular blocky. A few specimens exhibiting angular
blocky forms were present as well, but were less common. The second most common form was
rounded or subrounded blocks, and the third most common shape was plates. The resemblance of
many of these to soil pedology is undoubtedly more than a coincidence, and it is likely that these
features result from thermal alteration of the substrate and preserved the natural soil aggregates
present at the time of the occupation. The rounded forms are a bit more perplexing. None of the
soil structure at the site presented such forms, and perhaps these are either less-well hardened
fragments, or alternatively, items that were removed from features like hearths when removing ash
and were then rounded while exposed on the occupation surface.
Although the shape of the objects was often telling, the surface features of the objects were much
more tantalizing yet mysterious. Many specimens exhibited one or more relatively flat facets. These
could be divided into those facets that were abraded, flat ped faces, flat faces striated with linear
impressions (presumed to be either roots or grass), and more enigmatic forms that were typically
quite smooth. The smooth surfaces were often either concave (most common) or convex, and on
rare occasion complete fragments made clear the ultimate origin of some of these features.
The clearest of these were abraded facets that are the result of screening. Some of the flat facets
were most likely pedologic faces perhaps made flat by shrink-swell processes in the soil. The
smooth surfaces, typically either convex or concave, are suspected to be trace fossils of insect
activity, associated with insects that resided in the soil underground (see Genise 2017 for a variety
of examples). One ellipsoidal internal cast is most likely a wasp cocoon; it appeared to match the
smooth concave surface also found in the same lot. Exceptions to this generalization are the nests
of mud daubers, which were most likely attached to fuel wood that was combusted in a thermal
feature, thereby firing the earth and preserving the nest for perpetuity.
The facets with parallel linear grooves, presumed to be impressions of plants, are most enigmatic.
These fragments were uncommon, typically very thin (<1 cm) which would be quite thin for a
plaster, especially over what one assumes would be a fairly irregular surface. In the literature, most
authors cite the presence of a temper as evidence of human agency and none of the items appeared
to be tempered. The evaluation of temper within the specimens is an ongoing process.
SUMMARY
The majority of the burnt earth assemblage at 41TR203 consists of material burned in place, an
accidental by-product of human occupation. Some of the more enigmatic features are most likely
associated with insect activity, but the most curious are those with parallel linear grooves that
resemble grass impressions. But most of these are quite thin and appear to be improbable candidates
for plaster over a thatch surface, which would have undoubtedly been somewhat rough and
undulatory, requiring a relatively thick cover of mud to render it waterproof. Somewhat
surprisingly, the context from which a fragment of burnt earth was petrographically examined
during the first phase of work recovered very little burnt earth. It was from this context that it was

hoped that the external morphology of those materials could be examined. Unfortunately that was
not the case.
Following examination of the entire assemblage, there appears to be no solid evidence of burnt
earth artifacts associated with earthen plaster applied to prehistoric structures, and for this reason,
the analytical work aimed at analyzing such features was aborted. This is not to say that identifying
attributes of enigmatic natural features (such as those created by insects) are not worth documenting
in detail, but rather that this was not the goal of this analysis. It would be useful to see more in
depth analysis of assemblages such as this as a means of better understanding such assemblages,
and hopefully this analysis can be a first step in that direction.
