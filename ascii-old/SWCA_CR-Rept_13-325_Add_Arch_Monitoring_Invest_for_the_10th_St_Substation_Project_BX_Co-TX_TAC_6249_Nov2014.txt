ABSTRACT
On behalf of CPS Energy, SWCA Environmental Consultants (SWCA) conducted additional cultural
resources monitoring of a construction project at the Tenth Street Substation in Bexar County, Texas
under Texas Antiquities Permit No. 6249. The proposed project area is bounded by Ninth and Tenth
Streets and by North Alamo Street and Interstate Highway (IH) 37. The project involved two trenches for
conduits in the existing right-of-way (ROW) of North Alamo Street, removal of existing slabs to prepare
it for the replacement of a transformer and switchgear within the substation, the installation of 12 pier
locations, and trenches associated with conduit and duct bank work. These concrete piers are
approximately 1 m (3 feet) in diameter and 6.1 m (20 feet) in depth. The trenching and block excavations
for the installation of additional conduits for new duct banks were of various widths and depths not
exceeding 1.8 m (6 feet). The Tenth Street Substation is an irregularly shaped 2-acre tract. Thus the Area
of Potential Effects (APE) was approximately 2 acres, with depth of impacts up to 6.1 m (20 feet) deep at
pier locations.
The archival review found that from 1835–1912, the project location is consistently depicted straddling
the Acequia Madre or Alamo Ditch, and it was part of the Labor de los Adaiseños or the Upper Labor
(agricultural field) of the Alamo. Sanborn Fire Insurance maps dating to 1888, 1892, and 1896 indicate that
the project area was within property once owned by the Avenue C Street Car Line Company and later the
San Antonio Electric Street Rail Yard Company. By 1912, the acequia is no longer evident and the street
car property has been parceled out. It was divided into a storage property, and stables for the San Antonio
Gas and Electric Company, which are confined to the northeastern corner of the project area.
SWCA’s intensive archaeological monitoring was performed during construction activities that occurred
during May 2012, February 2013, and April–September 2013. The monitoring activities were conducted
in order to identify and record any existing cultural resources within the project area. The construction
monitoring identified cultural debris dating to the late-nineteenth to early-twentieth century within the 2acre substation. A brick lens was identified across the western portion of the project area, exposed by a
trench and pier locations. The lens covered an area that was approximately 12 m (40 feet) in length. A
large building labeled as the car shed and engine house is depicted on the Sanborn maps near the same
location as the current excavations. The building is no longer evident on the 1912 Sanborn map
suggesting it was destroyed or removed from the property. Given the age of the bricks and associated
materials, the brick layer likely represents construction fill after the removal and destruction of buildings
associated with the street car property. No evidence of the Acequia Madre was encountered within any of
the excavations within the substation. Overall, no definitive evidence suggested by artifacts or features
was observed in the project area that could be associated with the Spanish Colonial or the Republic of
Texas eras. Thus, all work within the 2-acre substation was conducted within extensively disturbed
deposits predominantly dating to the late-nineteenth and early twentieth-centuries.
SWCA made a reasonable and good faith effort to identify historic properties within the project area.
Based on the results of the monitoring efforts, the excavation within the Tenth Street Substation had no
effect on significant cultural properties.

INTRODUCTION

However, CPS Energy requested all excavations
associated with the Tenth Street Substation be
included under Antiquities Permit No. 6249, as
additional work associated with upgrades to the
facility were anticipated. Within the substation,
construction work involved removing the old
switchgear and transformer slab foundations and
associated conduits. Block excavations with
trenches for the new switchgear and transformer
locations and associated duct bank work were
conducted almost entirely within the western
boundary of the Tenth Street Substation facility. In
addition, a total of 12 piers were installed for the
new switchgear and transformer locations. Lastly,
another 100-foot conduit trench was installed
within the ROW of N. Alamo Street at its
intersection with Ninth Street. The Tenth Street
Substation is an irregularly shaped 2-acre tract.
Thus the area of potential effects (APE) for these
modifications
within
the
substation
is
approximately 2 acres, with depth of impacts up to
6.1 m (20 feet) deep at pier locations.

On behalf of City Public Service (CPS) Energy,
SWCA Environmental Consultants (SWCA)
conducted additional cultural resources monitoring
of a construction project at the Tenth Street
Substation in Bexar County, Texas (Figure 1). The
project area is bounded by Ninth and Tenth Streets
and by North Alamo Street and Interstate Highway
(IH) 37. The project involved the excavation of a
trench for the installation of conduit in the existing
right-of-way (ROW) of North Alamo Street,
removal of existing slabs within the substation to
prepare it for the replacement of a transformer and
switchgear, and the installation of pier beam
locations and trenches associated with conduit and
duct bank work.
The investigations began with a reexamination of
the historic archival and map research for the
property encompassing the Spanish Colonial
period up through the 1950s as reported in Galindo
et al. (2013). A portion of the Acequia Madre (also
known as Alamo Madre, Alamo Ditch, and
archaeological site 41BX8) traverses the Tenth
Street Substation (Cox 1985) (Figure 2).
Subsequent to the archival research, the
construction activities were monitored. The goal
of the work was to examine and assess any
cultural deposits revealed in the construction,
adequately document the cultural resources, and
provide sufficient information to make
determinations on age and significance. All work
was done in accordance with the standards and
guidelines of the Texas Historical Commission
(THC) and the Council of Texas Archeologists
(CTA) under Texas Antiquities Permit No. 6249.

PROJECT AREA DESCRIPTION
Located in downtown San Antonio, Texas, the
project area is in a highly developed urban setting
on a level floodplain of the San Antonio River,
about 0.6 mile northeast of the Alamo and three
blocks east of the river in Bexar County, Texas.
This location is in the heart of downtown San
Antonio and within an area of continuous
occupation since the city’s historic beginnings. It
is currently covered with transformers and CPS
Energy buildings that have been constructed at
various times since CPS Energy acquired the
property in 1921. SWCA initially conducted a
series of monitoring investigations associated with
some of the construction within the Tenth Street
Substation on behalf of CPS Energy under
Antiquities Permit 5604 (Galindo et al. 2013;
Figure 3).

The monitoring occurred during a series of site
visits beginning in May 2012, and terminating in
September 2013. Construction activities initially
consisted of installing a new pole and 100-foot
utility trench at N. Alamo Street and Tenth Street.

ENVIRONMENTAL SETTING

of the archival work are not repeated here except
for specific information about the Acequia Madre
(site 41BX8), a portion of which is within the
Tenth Street Substation Project.

GEOLOGY
Geologically, the project area is mapped as 100
percent Pleistocene Fluviatile terrace deposits,
which are made of predominately gravel,
limestone, dolomite, and chert (Fisher 1983). The
deposits also consist of sand, silt, and clay. Most
low terrace deposits along entrenched streams are
above flood level (Fisher 1983).

SPANISH ACEQUIAS
As the Spanish established missions in Bexar
County, they also devised an irrigation and water
supply system using spring water. Friars
supervised the labor of Indians, settlers, and
soldiers to construct acequias, or canals, and dams
(Cox 2005). The system distributed water for
agriculture, personal consumption, and other
household uses (Porter 2009:48). Thus, the system
represents the first municipal water system in what
would become the United States.

SOILS
The project area is mapped as 100 percent
Houston Black clay (Taylor et al. 1991:Map Sheet
54). Houston Black terrace soils with 1–3 percent
slopes generally occupy long, narrow slopes,
adjacent to the larger drainage ways (Taylor et al.
1991:21). The surface layer is about 34 inches
thick, while the subsurface layer is about 20 inches
and blocky (Taylor et al. 1991:21).

The first canal dug at the San Antonio Springs
between 1718 and 1744 was the Acequia Madre. It
diverted water from the east side of the headwaters
of the San Antonio River, just below San Antonio
Springs in present-day Brackenridge Park (Cox
2005). The CPS Energy Tenth Street Substation
project area straddles a portion of the Acequia
Madre, which is a contributing element of the San
Antonio Missions National Historic Park (National
Register of Historic Places [NRHP] 78003147).
The Acequia Madre continued to supply water
until the early 1900s.

CULTURAL SETTING AND ARCHIVAL
REVIEW
Prior to any ground disturbing activities and
monitoring, SWCA reviewed a report of 2010
monitoring (Galindo et al. 2013), which contains a
comprehensive examination of available historic
maps, records, and archives that reconstruct the
history of the Tenth Street Substation from the
earliest Spanish Colonial period to present. The
research concentrated on historic ownership and
occupation of the project area and developed a
general history to guide the identification of any
significant landmarks or places that should be
considered during the monitoring. Galindo et al.
(2013) focused on the Spanish Colonial period, but
also included the history of the tract through the
1950s. The research was conducted at several local
repositories, including the Texas Archeological
Research Laboratory (TARL) and the THC
library. Additional sources of information that
were consulted included published reports, aerial
photographs, records at the Texas Natural
Resources Information Systems (TNRIS) archives,
and geo-referenced maps contained in the Texas
Historic Overlay (Foster et al. 2006). The results

The Spanish missions consumed spring water
exclusively until 1761, when a well was dug at the
Alamo in anticipation that hostile Indians would
block access to the river (Cox 2005). Around
1776, a dam was built to divert spring water into a
second canal, the Upper Labor ditch, which was
associated with the San Pedro Springs.
As the population of San Antonio grew during the
nineteenth century, the acequias could not meet
the demand and eventually became a source of
disease as people increasingly used them to
dispose of waste (Porter 2009:96). The canals also
required constant maintenance to keep them
functioning properly. The Espada Acequia is the
only acequia that still flows today.

METHODS

archaeologist complied with all applicable
Occupational Safety and Health Administration
(OSHA) safety regulations and wore all required
safety equipment (e.g., hardhat, steel-toed boots,
and eye protection). Monitoring consisted of a
qualified archaeologist observing the excavation
process, the excavation area, and the resulting fill;
frequently inspecting it for cultural remains. If
encountered, artifacts were examined, quantified,
and assessed as to age and origin, and generally
were not collected. Diagnostic artifacts or those of
particular interest were to be collected for further
study in SWCA labs. Particular attention was
given to any cultural resources that might have
dated to the Spanish colonial era or to the early- to
mid-nineteenth century.

BACKGROUND REVIEW
SWCA performed a cultural resources file records
review to determine if the proposed APE has been
previously surveyed for cultural resources or if
any archaeological sites have been recorded within
or adjacent to the APE. To conduct this review, an
SWCA archaeologist reviewed the San Antonio
East (2998-133) U.S. Geological Survey (USGS)
7.5-minute topographic quadrangle map at TARL
and searched the THC Texas Archeological Sites
Atlas (Atlas) and site files at TARL. These sources
provided information on the nature and location of
previously conducted archaeological surveys,
previously recorded cultural resource sites,
locations of NRHP properties, sites designated as
State Antiquities Landmarks (SALs), Official
Texas Historical Markers (OTHMs), Registered
Texas Historic Landmarks (RTHLs), cemeteries,
and local neighborhood surveys. The Texas
Department of Transportation (TxDOT) Historic
Overlay and other resources were also reviewed
and a comprehensive history of the project area is
contained in Galindo et al. (2013), as described
above. While this prior archival review was
mainly relied upon, additional research was also
undertaken and focused on the historic Sanborn
Fire Insurance maps.

When intact cultural resources were revealed in
the construction process, the archaeologist
attempted to make a determination as to potential
significance. At this point, construction was
temporarily halted so that the archaeologist could
better examine the cultural materials or features,
take photographs, and thoroughly document the
finds. Once the materials were assessed,
construction recommenced and continued as
planned. Only if the materials were assessed as
extremely significant (mainly human remains or
burials) was construction in the immediate area to
be halted. If a localized work stoppage was
required, the monitoring archaeologist would have
immediately called all involved parties (CPS
Energy, THC, HPO, etc.) to discuss the find and
formulate a plan of action. However, over the
course of the project it was not necessary to
implement this emergency contingency plan.

FIELD METHODS
As part of the compliance process, the San
Antonio Historic Preservation Office (HPO)
requested that an archaeologist monitor the
excavation at the CPS Energy Tenth Street
Substation. The goal of the monitoring was to
gather information on the nature and types of
cultural resources possibly buried in the project
area, with a focus on potentially significant
resources related to the Spanish Colonial era, the
Acequia Madre, and the Alamo.

SWCA conducted a non-collection survey.
Artifacts were tabulated, analyzed, and
documented in the field, but not collected. Had
temporally diagnostic artifacts been encountered,
they would have been described in detail and
photographed in the field.

RESULTS OF BACKGROUND REVIEW

The archaeologist coordinated all field activities
with appropriate personnel and any on-site
construction foreman regarding scheduling and
safety. The monitoring archaeologist attended a
pre-construction meeting to ensure full
coordination prior to construction. The

As mentioned, a thorough background literature
review was conducted by Galindo et al. (2013),
and revealed that three previously conducted
archaeological surveys, three previously recorded
sites, one NRHP district, 10 NRHP properties
6

straddling the Acequia Madre. The land between the
San Antonio River and the Acequia Madre is
alternatively labeled, “Upper Labor of the Alamo”
or “Labor de los Adaiseños.” By 1869, this area
began to fill in with streets and lots, but the area near
the project area is still an open area labeled
“Watermelon Field.” By 1883, the space between
the river and the acequia now contains streets and
platted lots to the exclusion of open fields, with the
exception of Milam Square, which is a block north
of the project area (Galindo et al. 2011:24).

(three of which include a historical marker), nine
historical markers (besides the three associated
with an NRHP property), and a multitude of
neighborhood surveys identifying historic
resources are located within or adjacent to the
project area or within a 0.5-mile radius. The entire
results of the background review are not repeated
here except for information about the prior
excavation of the portion of the Acequia Madre
that is within the Tenth Street Substation.
The University of Texas at San Antonio’s Center
for Archaeological Research (UTSA-CAR)
investigated the portion of the Acequia Madre (site
41BX8) within the substation in 1984, on behalf of
the City of San Antonio Public Service. The
project involved archival research and the
excavation of a cross section of the Acequia
Madre, which dates to 1745. This portion of the
acequia traverses the substation from northeast to
southwest, from the substation’s northern corner
along Tenth Street to about 35 m north of its
southern corner along Ninth Street (see Figure 2).
The UTSA-CAR trench was 0.61 m wide, 5.5 m
long, and 2.4 m deep. The acequia was
encountered under 0.76 m of asphalt and fill (Cox
1985). The unlined ditch was approximately 4.6 m
wide and 1.5 m deep when it was filled; however
in profile, the channel appeared as wide as 6.4 m.
The extreme width probably reflects the
meandering and rechannelization of the ditch
during it long life (Cox 1985:3). The artifacts
encountered represent several dumping episodes
and included metal fragments, glass shards and
bottles, and ceramic sherds dating to the latenineteenth and early-twentieth century (Cox
1985). The acequia would have been regularly
cleaned and repaired during its use and
consequently, all artifacts from this time period
would have been removed. Only after the acequia
ceased to function would trash begin to
accumulate (Cox 1985:7).

Several cultural features surrounding the project
area are notable. A mill is depicted along the San
Antonio River northwest of the project area, and as
early as 1835 it is characterized as old. Cannon
ramparts are depicted in 1836 near the mill and
another cannon rampart is east of the project area.
Finally, the Galveston, Harrisburg and San Antonio
Railway (GH&SAR) is first depicted in 1889 along
Avenue C (present-day Broadway), Tenth, and
Austin streets. The GH&SAR depot is depicted
northeast of the project area.
For this project, the Sanborn Fire Insurance maps
were reviewed in detail to assess previous historic
resources dating to the late-nineteenth and earlytwentieth centuries within the project area. Outlined
below, maps dating to 1888, 1892, 1892, and 1912
indicate that the project area was within property
once owned by the “Ave. C Street Car Line” and
later the “San Antonio Electric Street R.Y. [Rail
Yard] Co.”
1888 SANBORN MAP
The project location is depicted straddling the
acequia and shown as a linear ditch intersecting
the street block between Ninth Street and Tenth
Street (Appendix A-1). Alamo Street is depicted as
Avenue D and several buildings are identified
within the substation boundaries, including
residential dwellings, a bowling alley, and the
Avenue C Street Car Line Company property. The
street car property is entirely within the substation
boundaries east of acequia location and associated
buildings, including an office, a lamp house,
carpenter and blacksmith shops, an auto garage,
and a print shop.

HISTORIC MAP REVIEW
Seven maps from the TxDOT Historic Overlay
(Foster et al. 2006) dating from 1835–1921, were
reviewed for a recent Tenth Street Substation
monitoring report (Galindo et al. 2011). From 1835–
1912, the project location is consistently depicted
7

ADDITIONAL ARCHAEOLOGICAL MONITORING INVESTIGATIONS
for the Tenth Street Substation Project, Bexar County, Texas

The monitoring occurred at two locations and
during several periods of construction activity
within the substation. Specifically, these involved
the installation of a new pole and 100-foot trench
at North Alamo and Tenth Streets (Figure 4);
block excavations of test pits to determine existing
duct bank locations within the substation; initial
removal of soil, existing beams, and slabs within
the target area for the replacements of the
transformer and switchgear in the western portion
of the project area; the drilling of 12 piers in the
same location for the transformer and switchgear;
and the excavation of trenches for utility
connections that varied between 1.2–2.7 m (4–9
feet) deep (Figure 5).

1892 SANBORN MAP
The project location continues to be depicted
straddling the “Alamo Ditch” and the name of the
property east of the acequia changes to the Power
House and Car Shed of San Antonio Electric Street
Rail Yard Company (Appendix A-2). Some of the
buildings within the street car property depicted on
the 1888 map were either moved or destroyed.
Additions include a repair shop, a car shed, and an
engine house. These buildings are directly east of
the acequia location. The acequia itself is labeled
as “covered,” indicating that the channel has been
filled in. The other buildings depicted within the
project area are relatively unchanged.

The trench within North Alamo and Tenth Streets
was completed in May 2012. The excavations
within the substation facility were monitored
during February 2013 and between May–July
2013. According to the UTSA-CAR report (Cox
1985), the Acequia Madre traverses the substation
on the western side, and some of the current
excavations were monitored directly atop a portion
of the acequia as mapped by Cox (1985); however,
the canal was not encountered. The mechanical
excavations revealed disturbed sediments from the
surface to 2 m (6.5 feet) deep. Cultural materials
observed within the substation excavations
consisted of a range of artifacts from the latenineteenth century to the mid-twentieth century,
and all were within mixed contexts.

1896 SANBORN MAP
The project location is still depicted with the
covered acequia and a street car company
(Appendix A-3). The repair shop has been
removed but the office location, the street car
shed, power house, and blacksmith building
remain. The blacksmith building has been changed
to an oil house. The other dwellings and buildings
within the project area outside of the street car
company, including a bowling alley, remain
relatively unchanged.
1912 SANBORN MAP
By 1912, the acequia is no longer evident on the
map (Appendix A-4). The property east of the
acequia’s former location has been divided into a
storage property, and stables for the San Antonio
Gas and Electric Company, which are confined to
the northeastern corner of the project area. A few
additional buildings are included in the project
area, and the bowling alley remains at the same
location Results of Archaeological Monitoring

The archaeologist monitored the construction
activities from near the edge of the excavation,
frequently assessing both the excavation profiles
and spoils for cultural remains. Special attention
was paid to the horizons of disturbance and
development directly atop the native clay soil,
usually found approximately 1.2–2.1 m (4–6.5
feet) below the surface.

RESULTS OF ARCHAEOLOGICAL
MONITORING
MAY 2012 MONITORING
On May 4, 2012, monitoring began near the
intersection of North Alamo and Tenth Streets for
excavation of a 100-foot conduit trench. The
trench would allow for a connection from man
hole (MH) 1195 to a new pole (Figure 6). The
trench was oriented east from MH 1195 across the
North Alamo ROW towards an existing pole
location. An unmarked pipeline, possibly an
abandoned water line, intersected the trench at 6 m
(19.7 feet) east from MH 1195. An existing utility
line parallels the water line and both pipelines
were encountered at approximately 1.2 m (4 feet)
below the surface. The upper 0.4 m (1.3 feet) of
the trench consisted primarily of asphalt and
concrete fill. Disturbed soils extended down to the
base of the trench at 1.5 m (5 feet), consisting of
tan (10YR6/4) clay loam with a high percentage of
gravel.

Figure 6. May 2012 trench overview, facing east.

A dark brown (10YR2/2) clay loam surrounds the
abandoned water line and extends for 2 m (6.6
feet) across the length of the trench before
returning to tan clay loam (Figure 7). Monitoring
investigations were not conducted for the new pole
replacement as crews used the existing pole
location for the new pole installation. Upon its
completion, the trench measured 30 m (100 feet)
long, 0.9 m (3 feet) wide, and 1.5 m (5 feet) deep.
Overall, the excavations revealed disturbed
sediments and no cultural materials were
encountered.

excavations.

Monitoring of construction activities within the
substation initially began on February 7, 2013.
The work consisted of the excavation of six test
pits ranging in depth and size to identify existing
duct bank locations within the western portion of
the substation, in preparation for the subsequent
removal and replacement of the switchgear and
transformer foundation slabs (see Figure 5). The
transformer slab is located just north of the larger
switchgear location. Test Pits 1 and 4 were
excavated adjacent the western and eastern walls
of the switchgear, respectively. Test Pits 2 and 3
were excavated through the asphalt layer that
covers the substation, between the new control
room and switch gear locations. Test Pits 5 and 6
were excavated along the eastern and western
walls of the transformer slab, respectively.

Figure 8. Test Pit 1 location, facing eastsoutheast.

Test Pit 1 measured approximately 3 m (9.8 feet)
long by 2 m (6.6 feet) wide (Figure 8). The
existing duct bank was encountered at 1.2 m
below surface. The stratigraphy revealed highly
disturbed contexts related to previous construction
activities of the duct bank work within the
substation. Excavations revealed a layer of asphalt
10 cm (0.32 feet) thick, overlaying a brownish
yellow (10YR6/6) sandy loam with 60 percent
gravel inclusions down to 40 cmbs (1.31 feet),
which is designated as Zone 1. Beneath Zone 1 is
Zone 2, consisting of grayish brown (10YR5/2)
sandy clay loam with 40 percent gravel inclusions
from 40–70 cmbs (1.31–2.3 feet). Brick fragments
were observed at the base Zone 2 and extended to
Zone 3 from 70–90 cmbs (1.31–2.9 feet) in a
matrix of brown (10YR4/3) sandy clay with 20
percent gravels (Figure 9). Zone 4 consisted of
dark brown (10YR3/3) sandy clay with 60 percent
gravel inclusions from 90–120 cmbs (2.9–3.9
feet). Zone 5 was black (10YR2/1) clay with 50
percent gravel inclusions and it terminated at 150
cmbs (4.9 feet). Artifacts were encountered within
the zones including bottle glass shards, milk glass
shards, a horseshoe, metal cans, railroad ties,
metal fragments, an insulator, and a possible
millstone fragment (Figure 10). The materials
were encountered within the disturbed layers
revealed by the excavations. No intact features or

Test Pits 2 and 3 were excavated to 150 cmbs (4.9
feet) and were similar in stratigraphy to Test Pit 1.
The excavations were situated between the control
room and an existing switch gear location (Figure
11). Test Pit 2 was 2 m (6.6 feet) by 2.7 m (8.9
feet) in size and contained artifacts including
bottle glass shards, a horseshoe, miscellaneous
metal fragments, nails, ceramic white ware, pieces
of ceramic pipe, and faunal bone fragments. The
materials were dispersed within the disturbed
layers of the test pit. Test Pit 3 measured 3 m (9.9
feet) by 1 m (3.3 feet) in size and no cultural
materials were encountered. No intact features
were observed in either test pit during excavations.

prior to excavations with switchgear in
background, facing north.

Test Pits 4 and 5 were similar and size and
stratigraphy as Test Pit 1. They were excavated
adjacent to the northeastern corners of the former
switchgear and transformer locations. No cultural
materials or intact deposits were observed during
these excavations.

APRIL–JULY 2013 MONITORING
FOUNDATION REMOVAL

Test Pit 6, excavated adjacent to the northwestern
corner of the transformer slab, measured 2 m (6.6
feet) by 1 m (3.3 feet) in size. The stratigraphy
was consistent with all previous excavations.
Artifacts observed during the excavations
consisted of two glass bottle fragments,
miscellaneous metal fragments, and ceramic white
ware sherds. No diagnostic materials or intact
features were observed during excavations.

Following the test pit excavations, removal of the
switchgear and transformer slabs occurred
between April 29–May 1, 2013. The transformer
slab measured 2.1 m (7 feet) by 3.9 m (13 feet)
and the switchgear measured 4 m (13.2 feet) by 8
m (26.5 feet) in size.
Trenches were excavated along each of the walls
of the transformer slab (Figure 12). The trenches
were 70 cm (2.29 feet) wide and 1.1 m (3.6 feet)
deep. The stratigraphy consisted of 0–10 cm of
asphalt, over a 10–25 cm lens of gravel fill,
underlain by black (10YR2/1) clay loam with a
very high gravel content (Figure 13). The conduit
pipes were exposed and removed from the eastern
trench along the slab. Several brick fragments
were observed in the backfill of the excavations,
primarily from the western and southern trenches.
The bricks were either light yellow or red in color.
They were scattered within the trenches with no
distinct concentration. The slab was then broken
apart, revealing the underlying concrete pillars and
rebar, and completely removed.

Overall, the test pits revealed the locations of the
duct banks and disturbances related to their
installation. Test pits 1, 2, and 6 contained artifacts
generally dating to the late-nineteenth and earlytwentieth centuries that were in very disturbed
sediments. Incidentally, the test pits were
excavated adjacent to the location of Acequia
Madre; however, the channel was not encountered.

The switchgear slab consisted of several concrete
walls with exposed duct bank pipes (Figure 14).
The walls were broken apart as were the existing
conduits (Figure 15). The switchgear was
excavated down to 1.1 m (3.6 feet) and the matrix
consisted of a construction fill mix of sand and
gravel. No cultural materials were encountered
during the switchgear slab removal. Once the
foundations of both the transformer and
switchgear were removed, the open areas were
then filled in with gravel.

Monitoring resumed within the same area for pier
excavations for the replacement transformer and
switchgear as well as for the new duct bank
locations. The monitoring occurred intermittently
between May–July 2013, due to weather and
construction delays. The three transformer drill
holes were excavated on May 13–14, 2013, while
the nine switchgear drill holes were excavated
between June 17–26, 2013. The duct bank work
for the switchgear was conducted between June
17–July 22, 2013.

A total of nine pier locations were excavated
within the switchgear. A column of four pier
locations was aligned along the former western
length of the switchgear with another four
paralleling the former eastern length (see Figure
5). One pier location was excavated between the
columns just south of the new transformer base.
The drill holes were all excavated to a depth of 6.1
m (20 feet) deep, but unlike the transformer drill
holes, the water table was encountered at
approximately 4.6 m (15 feet) in depth. This
encounter delayed excavations as the water had to
be removed and the hole re-drilled to proceed with
installation of the concrete. The profile was typical
of the previous drill holes; however, a layer of
brick fragments approximately 0.70–1 m (2–3
feet) thick was observed in the western drill holes
at 1 m (3 feet) below the surface. The bricks were
loose and exhibited no distinct patterns, indicating
they were probably used as fill (Figure 17). The
bricks were primarily yellow to light red in color
with maker’s marks of “V. N. Ortiz Laredo,”
“Valdez,” and “Evens & Howard St Louis,” all of
which date to the late-nineteenth century (Cook
1998). Other materials observed within the
excavated matrix of the drill holes consisted of a
cast iron pot, ceramic white ware fragments, and
glass shards.

For the pier locations, the construction crew used a
drilling rig with an auger bit to excavate the 12
holes for concrete piers. The holes were 1 m (3
feet) in diameter and 6.1 m (20 feet) deep. Each
time the auger bit was withdrawn from the hole,
the operator would spin it in reverse, releasing the
matrix from the bit onto the ground. The
archaeologist observed each resulting pile before it
was moved to a larger spoil pile at the margin of
the substation.
Initially, three drill holes were excavated within
the old transformer location. The upper 1.1 m (3.6
feet) consisted of the construction fill, followed by
black clay loam with high gravel content up to
approximately 2.1 m (7 feet) in depth. The lower
stratigraphy was indistinguishable but generally
consisted of highly mottled brownish yellow
(10YR6/4) silty clay loam with high percentage of
gravel inclusions. No cultural materials were
observed from the matrix of the auger holes. An
additional small trench was excavated within the
transformer location exposing the construction fill
used to fill the former slab location (Figure 16). A
few artifacts including a porcelain sherd, a brick
fragment, a painted glass fragment, and a
miscellaneous metal fragment were observed in
the trench. Subsequently, a new concrete slab was
installed on top of the piers to serve as the new
transformer base.

The brick lens along with other fill was observed
during the excavation a 27 m (90 foot) long trench
from the existing control room to the switchgear
location for the new duct bank. The control room
trench was 1 m (3 feet) wide and 1.2 m (4 feet)
deep, and began at the northwest corner of the
control room and extended northeast towards the
switchgear (Figure 18). The stratigraphy was
generally the same as all previous excavations
within the substation, consisting of a gravel layer
followed by clay with a high percentage of gravel
inclusions. However, 7.5 m (25 feet) north of the
start of the trench, a concrete fence curb was
encountered running diagonally across the trench,
indicating a former boundary or fence within the
substation (Figure 19). The brick lens began just
after the fence curb was exposed along with other
fill material (Figure 20). Artifacts observed within
the brick layer consisted of window pane glass,
ceramic white ware fragments, railroad spikes,
nails, domestic ceramic pieces (saucer and cup),
wire ties, electric wiring, cast iron pipe, and a
ceramic electric socket (Figure 21 and Figure 22).
The brick layer and materials were present across
the length of the trench from the fence curb to its
terminus within the switchgear location.

Figure 18. Trench from control room (visible in
the background) to former switchgear location,
facing south-southwest.

Once the control room trench reached the
switchgear location, a series of smaller trenches
and block excavations were conducted between
the pier locations. The work was conducted to
connect the various conduits within the switchgear
and adjacent to MH 1192. These excavations were
completed to various depths entirely within
construction fill (Figure 23). A block excavation
adjacent to MH 1192 and between two pier
locations was excavated to 2.7 m (9 feet) in depth
to connect the conduit. Another trench was
excavated diagonally towards the new transformer
base to connect to another existing conduit
northwest of the switchgear. Excavations revealed
no cultural material and the same stratigraphy that
had been encountered in previous trenches within
the substation.

SEPTEMBER 2013 MONITORING
On September 3–10, 2013, monitoring began near
the intersection of North Alamo and Ninth Streets
for excavation of a 100-foot conduit trench. The
trench would allow for a connection from man
hole (MH) 462 to an existing pole (Figure 24). The
trench was oriented southwest from MH 462
across the North Alamo ROW towards an existing
pole location on the west side of the ROW (Figure
25). A total of five existing utility lines intersected
the trench at various depths. Soils throughout the
trench consisted of an upper layer of asphalt and
yellow, silty clay construction base, followed by
highly disturbed very dark gray, yellow, and
grayish brown mottled silty clays mixed with 80
percent gravels and cobbles of chert and limestone
materials (Figure 26). Upon its completion, the
trench measured 30 m (100 feet) long, 0.9 m (3
feet) wide, and 1.4 m (4.5 feet) deep. Overall, the
excavations revealed disturbed sediments and no
cultural materials were encountered.

MONITORING SUMMARY
Although some of the construction activities were
conducted over the mapped location of the
Acequia Madre, the channel was not encountered
during excavations. The majority of cultural
material observed within the excavations dated to
the late-nineteenth and early-twentieth centuries.
A brick layer was encountered within the western
pier locations of the switchgear and the control
room trench. The brick lens appears to be
concentrated between an old fence curb and the
switchgear location, measuring approximately 12
m (40 feet) in length (Figure 27). The lens lacked
any sort of uniformity or design, suggesting that
the brick and associated artifact materials are the
toppled remains of a former building or have been
used as construction fill.

Figure 25. General location of N. Alamo and
Ninth Street conduit trench, facing northeast.

The historic map review revealed that the current
construction activities are within the former
location of the San Antonio Electric Street Rail
Yard Company. A large building labeled as their
car shed and engine house is depicted near the
same location as the current excavations. Given
the date range that the building is depicted (1892–
1896) and the manufacturing dates of the bricks
encountered (late-nineteenth century), it is likely
that the brick lens is debris associated with the
former building; however, the type of building
material is not specified on the Sanborn maps. The
building is no longer evident on the 1912 Sanborn
map suggesting it was destroyed or removed from
the property before that date. The building was
either destroyed and the brick used as fill, or the
building was entirely removed and brick fill was
used from another source.

excavations, facing southeast.

Overall, the excavations revealed very disturbed
contexts dating to the late-nineteenth and earlytwentieth centuries. Subsequent work within the
substation after CPS purchased the property in
1921 appears to have completely disturbed any
natural sediments. No cultural resources associated
with the Spanish Colonial or Republic of Texas
periods were encountered.

SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS

are no longer present. In addition, the Acequia
Madre is depicted as being filled in or covered
since 1892. Smaller buildings and dwellings are
scattered within Tenth Street Substation property
until CPS Energy acquired the property in 1921.

On behalf of CPS Energy, SWCA conducted
archival research and cultural resources
monitoring of a construction project at the Tenth
Street Substation in Bexar County, Texas. All
work was conducted in compliance with the City
of San Antonio HPO project requirements due to
the sensitivity of nearby cultural resource sites, the
most notable being the portion of the Acequia
Madre that traverses the substation from southwest
to northeast. The Acequia Madre is a contributing
element of the San Antonio Missions National
Historic Park.

Spanning more than a year, the construction
monitoring identified cultural debris dating to the
late-nineteenth and early twentieth centuries
within the 2-acre substation. A brick lens was
identified across the western portion of the project
exposed by a trench and pier locations. The lens
covered an area that was approximately 12 m (40
feet) in length. Given the age of the bricks and
associated materials, the brick layer likely
represents construction fill after the removal and
destruction of buildings associated with the street
car property. No evidence of the Acequia Madre
was encountered in any of the excavations within
the substation.

The work performed by SWCA included a review
of the previous in-depth historical and archival
research followed by intensive archaeological
construction monitoring in an effort to identify,
record, and characterize any extant historic
resources or deposits within the 2-acre substation.
The focus of the study was the Spanish Colonial
period
through
the
1950s,
particularly
concentrating on the Spanish Colonial period
when the acequia would have been constructed
and in use.

Overall, no definitive evidence suggested by
artifacts or features were observed in the project
area that could be associated with the Spanish
Colonial or the Republic of Texas eras. All work
within the 2-acre substation was conducted within
extensively disturbed deposits predominantly
dating to the late-nineteenth and early-twentieth
centuries.

SWCA’s intensive archaeological monitoring was
performed during construction activities that
occurred in May 2012, and from May–September
2013. The goal of the work was to examine and
assess any cultural deposits revealed in the
construction, adequately document the cultural
resources, and provide sufficient information to
make determinations on age and significance. All
work was done in accordance with the standards
and guidelines of the THC and the CTA.

SWCA made a reasonable and good faith effort to
identify historic properties within the project area.
Based on the results of the monitoring efforts, the
excavation within the Tenth Street Substation had
no effect on significant cultural properties.

The archival review found that from 1835–1896,
the project location is consistently depicted
straddling the Acequia Madre, or “Alamo Ditch,”
and it was part of the “Upper Labor of the Alamo”
or “Labor de los Adaiseños.” By 1882, this area
began to fill in with streets and lots and the project
area contained buildings associated with the
Avenue C Street Car Line Company and the San
Antonio Electric Street Rail Yard Company.
Sanborn maps dating from 1888, 1892, and 1896
depict a large building within the general location
of the recent construction activities. By 1912, the
buildings associated with the street car company
