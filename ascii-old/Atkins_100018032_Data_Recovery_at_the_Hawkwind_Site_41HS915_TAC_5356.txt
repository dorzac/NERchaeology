Abstract
Between August 9 and September 19, 2009, Atkins conducted data recovery operations at the
Hawkwind site (41HS915) under Texas Antiquities Permit No. 5356. Data recovery at the site was
initiated as the location was subject to proposed highway improvements. The field effort included
mechanical and manual unit excavation within a single 24-unit excavation block. Mechanical
excavation was conducted with a Grade-All, and fill was passed through a motorized screening
bucket affixed to a Bobcat Skid Steer Loader. Approximately 139 cubic meters (m3) of fill was
removed in the excavation block during data recovery operations at site 41HS915. About 123 m3 of
sediment was mechanically excavated, and 66 m3 of fill was mechanically screened. Sixteen cubic
meters of sediment was manually excavated, and 12.50 m3 of sediment was screened by hand. The
use of mechanical excavation equipment and motorized screen at Hawkwind was a strategy that
was aimed at maximizing data return at a relatively low-density, poorly stratified archeological site
while avoiding the cost and time-consumption associated with traditional excavation methods.

Atkins archeologists collected over 3,800 artifacts during the data recovery effort at the site. This
total includes 3,253 pieces of lithic manufacturing debris and 184 chipped stone tools. Included in
the chipped stone tool total are 105 projectile points. In addition to 6 indeterminate dart points, the
following types were identified: Catahoula arrow point (n = 1), Friley arrow point (n = 1), Ellis dart
point (n = 3), Ensor dart point (n = 1), Gary dart point (n = 73), Godley dart point (n = 1), Morrill
dart point (n = 1), and Yarbrough dart point (n = 18).

One-hundred sixty-six ceramic artifacts were recovered from the Hawkwind site during data
recovery. This assemblage consists of 157 prehistoric sherds, 7 burned clay fragments, and 2
modified raw clay fragments. The primary research objective of the ceramic analysis was to expand
our knowledge of Woodland period ceramics in the Mill Creek culture area of east Texas and to
assess how the ceramics from the Hawkwind site compare to other known sites in the Middle
Sabine River basin. The study began with a detailed technological and decorative analysis of the
ceramics recovered at the site. Next, employing the same suite of attributes used to characterize the
Hawkwind ceramics, a sample of the ceramics recovered at the Resch site and the entire Folly site
ceramic assemblage were reanalyzed, thus enabling comparability of the ceramic attributes
associated with all three sites. These data, along with Perttula’s (2001) detailed analysis of the
ceramics from the Herman Ballew site, assured that the ceramic assemblages from four of the major
middle Sabine River basin sites were examined in a similar manner, therefore enabling a more
accurate comparative analysis of the ceramics recovered from each site.
Sixteen radiocarbon dates were obtained from samples including carbonized material found on a
thermally altered stone, 10 botanical specimens retrieved during screening at the site and from
flotation, 4 samples of carbonized residue found adhering to pottery, and the bulk organics from

one ceramic sherd. The 16 radiocarbon dates ranged from 1260 B.C. to A.D. 970; however, all but
two align with Woodland period occupations at the site.

In addition to radiocarbon dating, a number of special studies were performed, including
macrobotanical analysis of plant remains from flotation samples, ceramic petrography,
instrumental neutron activation analysis (INAA), microwear analysis of selected stone tools, and
residue analysis.

Acknowledgments
The successful completion of the investigations at the Hawkwind site (41HS915), presented in this
report, represent the efforts of a number of individuals. Atkins is especially grateful to Dr. James
Abbott, Waldo Troell, Scott Pletka, and Dennis Price of the Archeological Studies Program at the
Texas Department of Transportation (TxDOT) Environmental Affairs Division for their guidance
through all stages of the work. Special thanks are also offered to John Callison and the staff of
TxDOT’s Atlanta District office for providing skilled operators for the mechanical equipment used at
the site.

Robert Rogers served as Principal Investigator until his retirement in 2012, after which Linda W.
Ellis assumed the role of Principal Investigator. Damon Burdon served as Project Archeologist, and
the field crew included Haley Rush, Julie Shipp, Bob Beckwith, Katie Canavan, Doug Jones, and Kirby
Farah.

Artifact processing and analyses were performed in the Atkins Archeology Laboratory under the
direction of Laboratory Supervisors Linda W. Ellis and Candace Wallace. Artifact processing was
performed by Kathleen Canavan, Haley Rush, and Chris Heiligenstein. Michael Nash analyzed the
faunal assemblage. Figures were produced by Candace Wallace and Ryan Fennell. Linda Nance
served as technical editor, and word processing was performed by Chris Vidrick. Clell Bond
provided Quality Control.

We would also like to thank TxDOT for their willingness to fund this level of research. Studies such
as this enable us to more fully characterize Woodland period assemblages and expand the database
of technological and decorative attributes associated with Woodland period ceramic and lithic
assemblages in East Texas. We would also like to thank the staff at the Texas Archeological
Research Laboratory for all their assistance during the reanalysis of the Resch and the Folly site
collections and for granting permission to submit samples of the sherds from both collections for
petrographic thin section and INAA. Finally, Linda Ellis would like to thank Tim Perttula for his
valuable input during numerous conversations, as well as the loan of several out-of-print and hardto-find publications.

INTRODUCTION AND HISTORY OF INVESTIGATION
AT THE SITE
by Robert Rogers, Damon Burden, and Linda W. Ellis

This report documents the results of data recovery excavations at the Hawkwind site (41HS915).
The site is located within the existing Farm-to-Market Road (FM) 2625 right of way (ROW), in the
Potter’s Creek and Potter’s Creek Relief floodplain, in south central Harrison County, Texas (Figure
1). The Hawkwind site was discovered during a pedestrian survey of FM 2625 at Potter’s Creek and
Potter’s Relief by GeoMarine, Inc., when shovel testing in the FM 2625 ROW in the location of
proposed bridge widening resulted in the recovery of six flakes (Tiné 2009). Following the survey,
this material was initially believed to be associated with previously recorded site 41HS13 (the Susie
Slade site), a Late Caddo site that is located nearby. However, the artifacts found in the shovel tests
were completely unlike the artifact assemblage reported from that site and were spatially distinct
from it by a distance of more than 100 meters (m). Therefore, in consultation with the Texas
Department of Transportation, Environmental Affairs Division (TxDOT ENV), the materials were
recorded as a distinct site, 41HS915 (Abbott et al. 2009).

Although Tiné (2009) revised her report to include the new site designated 41HS915, she
concluded that the site was sparse, appeared to be heavily disturbed in the cleared areas, and did
not merit further work. She further noted that backhoe trenching for deeply buried cultural
deposits was not conducted because undisturbed soils in the ROW of FM 2625 were confined to a 5m-wide strip inside the tree line and would be detrimental as it would require the removal of the
trees and would also remove proportionally large segments of the proposed ROW. TxDOT ENV
disagreed with these conclusions, but at the same time did not believe the site merited the time and
expense of “full-blown testing.” Thus, TxDOT staff, along with a small crew supplied by Atkins,
conducted mechanical survey of the site and limited hand excavations of 50-x-50-cm columns off
the side of the trenches (Abbott et al. 2009).
The TxDOT field investigation was “. . . designed to address the APE [area of potential effect] in
sufficient detail that an eligibility determination for 41HS915 might be possible” (Abbott et al.
2009:22). Toward that end, eight backhoe trenches were excavated on the north and south sides of
FM 2625 between Potter’s Creek and Potter’s Creek Relief (Figure 2). A ninth trench was located in
an area west of the relief channel that was considered to be associated with 41HS13. The trenches
were located on higher sections of the Potter’s Creek floodplain. A basic profile consisting of

modern fill and postconstruction fill sediments above natural floodplain sediments was identified
in most of the trench walls. Judgmental 50-x-50-centimeter (cm) units were opened off the sides of
each trench and excavated in arbitrary levels to obtain quantifiable artifact samples throughout the
investigated area. A total of 2.56 m3 of natural sediment was manually excavated during this effort
(Abbott et al. 2009:23).
A small number of lithic artifacts were recovered from the hand unit excavated off Trench 4. TxDOT
ENV considers this material to be associated with the nonmortuary component at site 41HS13.
Additionally, TxDOT ENV found that proposed highway improvements would not impact eligible
deposits at that site and recommended that no further work is warranted in that portion of the
FM 2625 ROW.

TxDOT investigations of 41HS915 identified low-density archeological material throughout the
upper meter of exposed natural sediments. A small number of prehistoric ceramic sherds, formal
and expedient chipped stone tools, moderate amounts of lithic debitage, and burned rocks were
recovered. A pitted stone, two fragments of carbonized nutshell, and small amounts of burned clay,
red ochre, and faunal bone were also found. TxDOT ENV felt that the ceramics and a small Gary
projectile point were indicative of a Woodland period occupation. The radiocarbon assays of the
nutshell fragments returned Late Archaic (3510 B.P.) and Late Woodland (1430 B.P.) ages, although
the dates were in reverse stratigraphic order (Abbott et al. 2009:22).

A comparison of vertical artifact distributions suggested that one or more occupation surfaces may
have once been present at the site, between depths of about 50 to 100 cm below the surface (cmbs).
However, variation in the vertical distributions of smaller and larger (and heavier) artifacts noted
in the sample columns was indicative of extensive bioturbation within the sandy floodplain
sediments. The reversed radiocarbon dates were interpreted as being exemplary of this process.

The TxDOT investigations at 41HS915 also included a geoarcheological study (Abbott 2009). By
examining trench profiles, two basic geological contexts were identified. The first, termed Unit 1,
consists of sandy alluvium that has been subjected to limited pedogenesis, and is broadly consistent
with the description of Iuka soils. This fill consists of a massive to bioturbated yellowish-brown
loamy fine sand with a slightly melanized A horizon and a weak cambic B horizon that grades into
pale brown fine sand with a few relatively subtle redox features. The second context is artificial
construction fill.
Abbott (2009) found that a typical profile of the valley fill exhibited an A-Bw-C or A-Bw-Cg profile
developed in sandy alluvial sediments. Both the A horizon and the Bw horizon consisted of massive,
friable to loose, dark yellowish-brown (typically 10YR 4/4) loamy fine sand. At a depth of
approximately 1 m, the profile grades into a C or Cg horizon composed of somewhat lighter-colored
fine sand. This horizon is typically wetter, contains less fine material, and exhibits more-subtle
redox features than the overlying horizon. Based on the geoarcheological assessment and

1. Introduction
evaluation of vertical artifact distributions, TxDOT ENV concluded that the site’s archeological
deposits were mixed and retained little stratigraphic integrity (Abbott 2009:7–9).

Although the vertical and spatial integrity of the archeological deposits appeared to be
compromised, TxDOT ENV considered the evidence of a Woodland period occupation in the site’s
deposits important for its potential to contribute to a poorly understood time period in northeast
Texas (Abbott 2009:10). At the assemblage level, they believed that the site had the potential to
address questions important to prehistory, and considered the site to be eligible for designation as
an archeological historic property (36 CFR 800.16(l)) and for formal designation as a State
Archeological Landmark (13 TAC 26.12). However, site 41HS915’s eligibility was believed to be
dependent on the compositional integrity of the assemblage as a whole and the ability of the
investigating parties to process a sufficient volume of site matrix to recover a large enough
assemblage to convincingly demonstrate that integrity.

Data recovery at the site was initiated because the location was subject to proposed highway
improvements that involved bridge widening and paving the shoulders at the approaches. The
horizontal area of potential effect (APE) for these improvements had a total length of 1,410 feet (ft)
(430 m), were confined to the existing 145-ft (44-m)-wide ROW, and encompassed approximately
4.70 acres. The vertical APE was generally confined to 3 ft (90 cm) below modern surface levels, but
the installation of additional bridge-support columns at the stream crossings required boring up to
at least 16 ft (5 m) below the existing ground surface.

In July 2009, a Scope of Work for Data Recovery excavations at 41HS915 was submitted to TxDOT
ENV by Atkins. Between August 9 and September 19, 2009, Atkins conducted data recovery
operations at the Hawkwind site under Texas Antiquities Permit No. 5356. The results of that study
are contained in this document.

The report is divided into 7 chapters and 11 appendices. Following this introduction, Chapters 2
and 3 present the physical and cultural settings of the site, with the latter emphasizing the
Woodland cultural period, which forms the primary archeological component at the site. Chapter 4
details the basic research topics addressed in this report, discusses the field and laboratory
methods employed in the study, and presents a summary of the data recovery excavations. Chapter
5 presents a detailed technological and decorative analysis of the ceramics recovered at the
Hawkwind site (41HS915). This is followed by a reexamination of a sample of the Resch (41HS16)
site ceramic assemblage and the Folly (41RK26) site ceramic assemblage. The data from these three
sites are then compared to the ceramic assemblage from the Herman Ballew site (41RK222). Stone
artifacts are described in Chapter 6, including an analysis of the numerous Gary dart points found
during the excavations. A summary and synthesis of the investigations and a discussion of the
radiocarbon dates are presented in Chapter 7. This is followed by the references cited and 11

ENVIRONMENTAL SETTING
by Andrea S. Burden

The Hawkwind site is located in a region characterized by sandy, rolling hills and temperate pinehardwood forests that feature scattered areas of cropland and pasture. Beneath this landscape lies
sandstone bedrock, indicative of the substantial sedimentation that occurred in this area during the
last 66 million years. This chapter presents an overview of the physical setting and natural
resources of the area surrounding the Hawkwind site to provide a basis for interpreting how the
site’s inhabitants utilized local resources.

CLIMATE

The climate of Harrison County is warm, moist, humid, and subtropical in nature. The area is
characterized by mild winters and hot and humid summers. Average temperatures range from a
low of 46 degrees Fahrenheit (°F) in winter to a high of 81 °F in summer. Annual rainfall averages
46.9 inches, with about half falling between April and September. The annual growing season for
most crops also coincides with this period of rainfall (Golden et al. 1994:3).

GEOLOGY AND GEOMORPHOLOGY

Harrison County is located within the West Gulf Coastal Plain physiographic province. The county is
crossed by wide lowlands associated with the Sabine River, which forms the southern boundary of
the county, Big Cypress Bayou, and Little Cypress Bayou. Moving across the county, the landscape is
characterized as nearly level in the east and gradually becomes more undulating and rolling until
definite hills are noted in the western extent. Topographic elevations range from about 570 to
170 ft above mean sea level (amsl) (Golden et al. 1994:159). Eastern Harrison County features the
western edge of a prominent geologic feature known as the Sabine Uplift that stretches into
southeastern Arkansas and northwestern Louisiana. The Sabine Uplift is a large flat-topped dome
approximately 80 miles in diameter, which crests near Caddo Lake, Louisiana.

The Hawkwind site is situated within the floodplain of a tributary of the Sabine River known as
Potter’s Creek. Here site deposits lie within Holocene-aged alluvium, which overlies Eocene-aged
Recklaw Formation and Wilcox Group bedrock (Figure 3). Recklaw Formation bedrock is exposed
in large areas of the north-central and southwestern portions of the county and is composed of
micaceous clay and minor amounts of sand and silt. Ironstone, in the form of seams and pebbles, is

Atkins 100018032/120087

2. Environmental Setting
found at or near the surface within the Recklaw Formation (Golden et al. 1994:159). Wilcox Group
bedrock is exposed on the surface in the eastern portions of the county and is composed of fine and
medium, cross-bedded sand, shale, clay, lignite, and certain amounts of siderite, pyrite, and
glauconite (Golden et al. 1994:159; Pieper et al. 1965).

Both the Recklaw Formation and the Wilcox Group feature resources utilized by both modern and
prehistoric peoples. For example, clay found in the association with the Recklaw and Wilcox
Formations is a modern economic resource that is mined and used in the production of fired bricks,
pottery, tile, and fillers (Golden et al. 1994:3). It was also used by prehistoric potters. Gravels found
within the Recklaw Formation are also mined by contemporary industry and were used by native
peoples for stone tools. Sandstone found in the area was used for ground stone tools and
hearthstones.

SOILS AND STRATIGRAPHIC INTEGRITY

The soils in and around the Hawkwind site have been mapped as belonging to the Iuka series,
specifically Iuka fine sandy loam, frequently flooded (U.S. Department of Agriculture, Natural
Resources Conservation Service [USDA, NRCS] 2009a). Iuka soils are very widely occurring,
minimally developed sandy soils formed on floodplains and low terraces in the southeastern United
States. They are classified as Aquic Udifluvents. The type section is located in Franklin County,
Alabama, but Iuka soils are also mapped in many other states, particularly in the south. The NRCS
Official Soil Series describes Iuka soils as having an Ap-A1-C-Cg profile developed in acidic fine
sandy loam alluvium. The Harrison County soil survey (Golden et al. 1994) description of Iuka soils
suggests slightly more intensive soil development, with development of a cambic B horizon.
Otherwise, this description (A-Bw1-Bw2-Bg1-Bg2-C1-C2 profile) of the typical pedon of Iuka soils is
similar to the national description, differing only in minor details (Abbott 2009).

Abbott (2009) described the lack of stratigraphic integrity at 41HS915 based on the results of
trenching and unit excavations conducted at the site by TxDOT in February 2009. He found that
although none of the trenches or excavation units yielded dense cultural debris, prehistoric
materials were ubiquitous throughout the natural deposits. However, he noted that no high
concentrations of artifacts were encountered, nor were they consistent between units or
associated. Several trends were noted, particularly in the vertical distribution of burned rock. First,
burned rocks tend to occur deeper in the profile than the lighter lithic debris, which is consistent
with vertical movement of artifacts by burrowing animals. Second, the average weight of individual
artifacts exhibits trends that are consistent with a degree of sorting by burrowing organisms.
Collectively, these distributions suggest that the original occupation surface (or surfaces) lies 50 to
100 cm below the modern ground surface, and that the deposit has been heavily bioturbated and
has little vertical integrity. Abbott also conducted a comparison of these site deposits with those at
the nearby Resch site (Webb et al. 1969) and concluded that similar effects from bioturbation were
Atkins 100018032/120087

Hawkwind Site (41HS915)
evident and that the slightly darker sediment designated a midden deposit is in fact a natural A-B
horizon sequence at both sites.

The lack of stratigraphic integrity that Abbott (2009) found at 41HS915 governed the use of
mechanical excavation and motorized screening equipment, as well as the excavation methods
employed in the data recovery excavations at the site.

HYDROLOGY

Ground water in Harrison County originates from the Carrizo-Wilcox and Queen City aquifers. The
Carrizo-Wilcox aquifer is stratigraphically the lowest, largest, and most productive of the two. The
aquifers feed numerous springs and creeks throughout the county (Brune 1975:12; Golden et al.
1994:159). Several springs occur in the vicinity of the Hawkwind site. One area, approximately 18
miles northwest of the Hawkwind site, is home to over 100 individual springs with names that
include Hynson, Marshall, Noonday Camp, and Iron Springs, and reportedly was visited by French
explorer René Robert Cavelier, Sieur de la Salle in 1686 (Brune 1975:43). The other location,
approximately 18 miles northeast of the Hawkwind site, is known as Coushatta Spring, which
reportedly lies along an old Caddo trail that ran from the Caddo Prairie to a Coushatta village
(Brune 1975:44). Yet another location, known as Indian Springs, was noted by L.F. Duffield during
recording of site 41HS13 in 1962 within the immediate vicinity of the Hawkwind site along the
south side of Cave Springs Road, known today as FM 2625. Duffield described site 41HS13 as a Late
Prehistoric cemetery, and the site map depicts the springs and a cave (Duffield 1962).
Surface water in the county is dependent upon a drainage network of small streams that feed the
Sabine River and Little Cypress Creek. Records of annual runoff along the entire 555-mile Sabine
River between 1941 and 1967 indicate an average water flow of 640 acre-feet per square mile
(Long 2012). The Hawkwind site is located within the floodplain between Potter’s Creek and its
relief channel, approximately 6.5 kilometers (km) from the confluence of the creek with the Sabine
River.

FLORAL RESOURCES

Harrison County lies within the Pineywoods ecoregion (Gould 1975), an area of approximately
54,400 square miles (140,900 square kilometers) extending from Texarkana in the north to
Palestine in the west and Houston to the south (Texas Parks and Wildlife Department 2012)
(Figure 4). The east Texas Pineywoods are defined as a temperate coniferous forest dominated by
pine and hardwoods. There are three nonurban vegetation areas within Harrison County. These
areas are defined as (1) Pine-Hardwood Forest, (2) Native or Introduced Grasslands, and (3)
Willow Oak-Water Oak-Blackgum Forests (Frye et al. 1984). Each of these areas is examined in
detail below followed by an examination of wild plant species that may have been utilized by
inhabitants of the Hawkwind site.

Hawkwind Site (41HS915)

Pine-Hardwood Forests
Pine-Hardwood Forests, like that in the vicinity of the Hawkwind site, are commonly found
throughout the Pineywoods in forested floodplain, terrace, and upland settings. Plant species found
here include shortleaf pine (Pinus echinata), water oak (Quercus nigra), white oak (Q. alba),
southern red oak (Q. falcata), winged elm (Ulmus alata), beech (Bidens discoidea), blackgum (Nyssa
sylvatica), magnolia (Magnolia grandiflora), American beautyberry (Callicarpa americana),
American hornbeam (Carpinus caroliniana), flowering dogwood (Cornus florida), yaupon (Ilex
vomitoria), hawthorn (Crataegus spp.), supplejack (Berchemia scandens), Virginia creeper
(Parthenocissus quinquefolia), wax myrtle (Myrica cerifera), red bay (Persea borbonia), sassafras
(Sassafras albidum), southern arrowwood (Viburnum detantum), poison oak (Rhus toxicodendron),
greenbriar (Smilax spp.), and blackberry (Rubus louisianus) (McMahan et al. 1984:25). Areas of the
county along deep sand ridges also feature loblolly pine (P. taeda), black hickory (Carya texana),
sandjack oak (Q. incana), common persimmon (Diospyros virginiana), sweetgum (Liquidambar
styraciflua), beaked panicum (Panicum anceps), spranglegrass (Chasmanthium sessiliflorum),
indiangrass (Sorghastrum avenaceum), switchgrass (P. virgatum), three-awn (Aristida spp.),
bushclover (Lespedeza spp.), and tickclover (Desmodium spp.) (McMahan et al. 1984:25).

Native or Introduced Grasslands

This vegetation area is found along smaller drainages. This area displays a mix of native and
introduced grasses and forbs where woody vegetation has been cleared, often for agriculture
(McMahan et al. 1984:29). This would include areas of improved pasture consisting of coastal
bermudagrass, common bermudagrass, and bahiagrass (Golden et al. 1994:2).

Willow Oak-Water Oak- Blackgum Forests

This vegetation area is found among the lower floodplains along the two major drainages of
Harrison County: the Sabine River and Little Cypress Bayou. Plant species common to these areas
consist of beech, overcup oak (Q. lyrata), chestnut oak (Q. prinus), cherrybark oak (Q. falcata var.
pogodaefolia), elm (Ulmus spp.), sweetgum, sycamore (Platanus occidentalis), southern magnolia,
white oak, black willow (Salix nigra), bald cypress (Taxodium distichum), swamp laurel oak (Q.
laurifolia), hawthorn, bush palmetto (Sabal minor), common elderberry (Sambucus canadensis),
southern arrowwood, poison oak, supplejack, trumpet creeper (Campsis radicans), crossvine
(Bignonia capreolata), greenbriar, blackberry, rhomboid copperleaf (Acalypha rhomboidea), and St.
Andrew’s Cross (Ascyrum hypericoides) (McMahan et al. 1984:19).

Potentially Utilized Plant Species

Pollen evidence for this area indicates the climate has been relatively stable for approximately the
last 6,000 years (Delcourt and Delcourt 1985). This suggests that many modern plant species, like
those discussed above, have persisted in the vicinity of the Hawkwind site. Ongoing research into
Atkins 100018032/120087

2. Environmental Setting
the subsistence habits of Caddo and pre-Caddo peoples have suggested that native floral resources
constituted a large part of the indigenous diet compared to domesticated plant species, which may
in turn have been an important factor in settlement patterns (Keller 1989). Based on historic
ethnographic accounts, archeological research, and a biological survey in the area, Table 1 presents
some native plants that would have been available and likely utilized by prehistoric inhabitants in
the vicinity of the site (Espey, Huston & Associates 1994). Most of these resources are found only in
the floodplains in contrast to the dry uplands, which are dominated by pine forest that crowds out
most other plants including grasses and trees.

FAUNAL RESOURCES

The Hawkwind site lies within the Austroriparian biotic province defined by Blair (1950), which
encompasses an area from eastern Texas through the southeastern United States to the Atlantic
Ocean. Vertebrate fauna in the vicinity of the site are typical of those found throughout the
Austroriparian province. Particular taxa are common to each of the specialized habitats described
above: upland hardwood and pine forests, native and introduced grasslands, and bottomland
hardwood forests. Species associated with each of these habitats are examined in the following
paragraphs based on the findings of an environmental assessment from neighboring Rusk County
(Espey, Huston & Associates 1996). Certain species from these habitats that were likely important
faunal resources for indigenous peoples near the Hawkwind site are also discussed.
The upland hardwood and pine forested areas support reptiles such as the ornate box turtle
(Terrapene ornata ornata), green anole (Anolis carolinensis), northern fence lizard (Sceloporus
undulatus hyacinthinus), ground skink (Scincella lateralis), and the Texas rat snake (Elaphe obsoleta
lindheimeri). Avian species in this habitat include the red-bellied woodpecker (Melanerpes
carolinus), blue jay (Cyanocitta cristata), Carolina chickadee (Parus carolinensis), tufted titmouse
(Parus bicolor), Carolina wren (Thryothorus ludovicianus), pine warbler (Dendroica pinus), and
northern cardinal (Cardinalis cardinalis). Mammal taxa in these areas include Virginia opossum
(Didelphis virginiana), nine-banded armadillo (Dasypus novemcinctus), fox squirrel (Sciurus niger),
cotton mouse (Peromyscus gossypinus), eastern woodrat (Neotoma floridana), gray fox (Urocyon
cinereoargenteus), and white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus) (Espey, Huston & Associates
1996:3-117).

Many of the species found in upland habitats are also found in the bottomland forests of the region.
Typical amphibian and reptile species consist of the green treefrog (Hyla cinerea), east Texas toad
(Bufo woodhousii velatus), common musk turtle (Sternotherus odoratus), five-lined skink (Eumeces
fasciatus), broad-banded water snake (Nerodia faciata confluens), and western cottonmouth
(Agkistrodon piscivorus leucostoma). Avian species in this habitat include the downy woodpecker
(Picoides pubescens), Carolina wren, tufted titmouse, red-eyed vireo (Vireo olivaceus), Carolina
chickadee, northern parula (Parula americana), and prothonotary warbler (Prothonotaria citrea).

Mammals include the Virginia opossum, swamp rabbit (Sylvilagus aquaticus), gray squirrel (Sciurus
carolinensis), fox squirrel, white-footed mouse (Peromyscus leucopus), golden mouse (Ochrotomys
nuttalli), eastern woodrat, common raccoon (Procyon lotor), mink (Mustela vision), and white-tailed
deer (Espey, Huston & Associates 1996:3-117, 3-118).

Grasslands in this area, both native and introduced, are home to several bird species and mammals.
Birds found in this habitat include the northern mockingbird (Mimus polyglottos), mourning dove
(Zenaida macroura), scissor-tailed flycatcher (Tyrannus forficatus), dickcissel (Spiza americana),
painted bunting (Passerina ciris), savannah sparrow (Passerculus sandwichensis), eastern
meadowlark (Sturnella magna), and brown-headed cowbird (Molothrus ater). Mammals here
include Virginia opossum, nine-banded armadillo, eastern cottontail (Sylvilagus floridanus), fulvous
harvest mouse (Reithrodontomys fulvescens), hispid cotton rat (Sigmodon hispidus), and coyote
(Canis latrans) (Espey, Huston & Associates 1996:3-118).
Species that may have been important to native peoples in this area include the fox squirrel,
raccoon, Virginia opossum, white-tailed deer, rabbit, beaver (Castor canadensis), muskrat, mink,
and many common rodents. The Louisiana black bear (Ursus americanus luteolus), although rarely
sighted in Harrison County, was once common in the forests of east Texas prior to Anglo-American
colonization (House 1978; Texas Parks and Wildlife 2005:3–4) and would have been a valuable
food source for aboriginal inhabitants. Additionally, fish would have been gathered in abundance
from freshwater sources like the Sabine River nearby. Common fish would have included minnows,
sunfish, topminnows, darters, and pirate perch (Rogers et al. 1990:14–15). Most of these resources,
like the vegetal species on which they feed, would have been found largely within the floodplain.

CULTURAL SETTING

by Linda W. Ellis and Michael Smith
WOODLAND PERIOD CULTURAL SETTING
The Hawkwind site lies within the Northeast Texas Archeological Region (NTAR) as delineated by
the Texas Historical Commission (Kenmotsu and Perttula 1993; see Figure 1). The criteria used to
define this region are based on internal similarities in cultural patterns that generally reflect ties to
the southeastern Woodland cultures (see Black and Story 2003, Perttula 2001 and 2004, and Story
1990 for more-detailed syntheses of archeological research in the region). In this region, the end of
the Archaic and the beginning of the Woodland period (or Early Ceramic period) is marked by
significant changes in technology, subsistence, and settlement patterns. The archeological evidence
suggests that these changes were characterized by the gradual addition of new technologies to an
Archaic base that arrived from several different directions over a millennium or more (Cliff
1998:100).

During the 1,300 years between ca. 500 B.C. and A.D. 800, the Woodland people living in East Texas
were primarily hunter-gatherers or small-scale horticulturists who lived in increasingly larger
groups for longer periods of time, maintaining longer-term (re)occupations at single sites (Black
and Story 2003; Perttula and Nelson 2004). The archeological evidence suggests that drainage
basins may have served as geographically based social boundaries (Figure 5). While there is some
evidence of possible daubed pole and thatch structures, habitation features such as midden
deposits, the remains of earth ovens, storage pits, and/or burned rock concentrations are often
found in Woodland period sites (Black and Story 2003; Perttula 2004). Changes in the subsistence
regimes are indicated by ground stone tools such as “nutting” stones, manos, grinding slabs,
mullers, and anvils that appear in assemblages in increasing numbers (Webb et al. 1969:67).
Throughout much of the Woodland period, lithic raw material utilization remained similar to that of
the Late Archaic; however, after ca. A.D. 700, the use of dart points such as Gary and Kent gave way
to the later expanding-stem arrow points. Excavations at burial mounds sites such as the Coral
Snake Mound site (16SA48) (Jensen 1968a, 1968b; McClurkan 1966; McClurkan et al. 1980) and
Jonas Short Mound site (41SA25) (Jelks 1965) and their accompanying nonlocal burial goods such
as translucent quartz, copper beads, ear spools, and marine shells suggest that Woodland sites were
part of a much broader regional cultural pattern. These broad-scale cultural interaction spheres are
also reflected in the presence of Lower Mississippi Valley (LMV) Tchefuncte and Marksville
ceramics, as well as Williams Plain pottery, that accompany the introduction of ceramic technology

3. Cultural Setting
to the region. LMV ceramics occur with some frequency in early to middle Woodland period sites
(ca. 400 B.C. to A.D. 500) (Story 1990; Webb et al. 1969); however, sometime after 200 B.C., the use of
locally made pottery became more widespread, albeit in relatively small numbers (Perttula 2004;
Schambach 2001). Researchers have suggested that a shift to more-intensive occupation and
decreased residential mobility may have led to locating of sites closer to significant plant food
resources whose processing was facilitated by the increasing use of ceramic vessels (Cliff
1998:104–105; Corbin 1998:115; Moore 1995). While the reasons for these shifts in subsistence,
technology, and settlement patterns are still the subject of discussion, the archeological evidence
shows that Woodland period sites in East Texas share certain similarities to sites extending from
eastern Oklahoma, southwestern Arkansas, northwestern Louisiana, and into Southeast Texas. At
the same time, there are also certain key differences (Table 2). Based on this range of variability,
three major Woodland traditions, whose boundaries partially overlap, have been identified in East
Texas (Perttula and Nelson 2004; Schambach 2002; Story 1990) (Figure 6). These traditions have
been summarized by several researchers with various cultural chronologies. Although relatively
similar in description, these chronologies often attribute different names and dates to similar
periods and subperiods (Table 3). In addition, these descriptions are based on prehistoric cultural
characteristics and physical settings that were (and are) dynamic and often fluctuate through time
(Stahman et al. 2012). Even given their variances, these three cultural traditions appear to be
temporally contemporaneous, dating from around ca. 500 B.C. to A.D. 800 (Schambach 2002; Rogers
et al. 2001; Perttula, ed. 2008).
The most distinctive of these are the Fourche Maline cultural tradition that encompasses portions
of southwestern Arkansas and adjacent areas of Oklahoma, Louisiana, and Texas (Schambach 1998,
2002) and the Mossy Grove cultural tradition that covers an area extending from the southwestern
corner of Louisiana, southwest along the upper Texas Gulf Coast to around the Brazos Delta, and
inland into the southern part of the Texas Piney Woods (Aten 1983; Aten and Bollich 2011; Moore
1995; Story 1990). Between these two more-well-defined cultural traditions lies what Perttula and
Nelson (2004) (see also Story 1990:279) have termed the Mill Creek culture, an area centered in
east Texas to the west and south of the Red River and its tributary, the Sulphur River.

MILL CREEK CULTURE/TRADITION

Our knowledge of the Mill Creek culture comes primarily from sites located in the Big Cypress and
Sabine River basins and the upper portion of the Angelina River basin in east Texas (Perttula, ed.
2008; Perttula and Nelson 2004; Rogers et al. 2001; Webb et al. 1969). Woodland period
components found at these sites possess distinct similarities amongst one another, but there are
discernible contrasts with the neighboring and likely contemporary Fourche Maline culture to the
north and the Mossy Grove culture to the south. Several sites, located within a few miles of the
Hawkwind site, have ceramic assemblages that indicate the presence of more than one pottery
tradition. One of these is 41HS231. Situated atop a high interfluve along the eastern side of Hatley

Creek just north of its confluence with the Sabine River, it is located only a few miles southeast of
41HS915 (Dockall et al. 2008:57). This multicomponent site covers approximately 60,000 m2 along
the bluff top. A rather ephemeral late Woodland occupation was located at the southern end of the
site and included one sherd tentatively identified as Coles Creek Incised and fragments of two thick,
grog-tempered, Williams Plain vessel sections exhibiting characteristic flowerpot shapes. Four test
units yielded 13 additional sherds that also fit the general definition of Williams Plain. The vessel
sections were recovered near the bottom of a trash pit, and a radiocarbon date obtained from
charred wood found in the lower portion of the pit yielded a 2-sigma calibrated date of A.D. 660–
810.

Several sites within the relative vicinity of the Hawkwind site—Resch, Folly, Haddens Bend,
Herman Ballew, and Broadway—have been the focus of extensive archeological excavations, and
their distinctive assemblage variations set them apart from similarly aged sites in the Fourche
Maline and Mossy Grove areas (Bryan 1984; Jarvis 1972; Jensen 1968b; Perttula and Nelson 2004;
Rogers et al. 2001). Although similar to Mossy Grove and Fourche Maline sites in the predominance
of Gary dart points and Friley arrow points, Mill Creek sites possess ceramics in much lower
numbers, but the ceramics that are present exhibit a much wider variety of temper and paste types.
Although primarily undecorated wares, Mill Creek ceramic assemblages usually possess higher
percentages of decorated sherds than do Mossy Grove assemblages and most often exhibit broad
U-shaped design elements reminiscent of LMV decorative motifs. Generally lacking in features and
evidence of architecture, the sites of the Middle Sabine River basin suggest that their inhabitants
were “more residentially mobile than were Fourche Maline groups” (Perttula and Nelson
2004:156). The following discussions briefly summarize five key Mill Creek sites. The Resch site is
located less than 1 mile from the Hawkwind site. The Folly site and the Herman Bellew site are
located in the Middle Sabine basin within a 30–40-mile radius of the Hawkwind site. The Broadway
site is located roughly 55 miles west of the Hawkwind site. The Haddens Bend site is located
approximately 127 miles downstream and lies at the edge of the Mill Creek culture area.

Resch (41SH16)

The Resch site is also located on Potter’s Creek roughly 600 m (1,970 ft) to the northeast of the
Hawkwind site. It occupies an area of “only a few acres” atop a terrace above the floodplain (Webb
et al. 1969). Work at the site was conducted between 1965 and 1968, resulting in the excavation of
670 m2 (7,200 ft2), or 700 m3 (25,000 ft3). While artifacts attested to various occupations between
the Middle Archaic and Caddo periods, the Woodland period was particularly well represented. The
investigations produced 1,541 sherds with a wide diversity of mostly pre-Caddo ceramics, as well
as ceramics closely resembling one or more of the LMV ceramic traditions. Lithics found at the site
included 464 dart and 48 arrow points, with more than 64 percent and almost 50 percent of the
identified types being Gary and Friley points, respectively.

Hawkwind Site (41HS915)
Several carbon samples provide dates from 400 B.C. to A.D. 300, but the site’s poor stratigraphic
preservation precludes secure identification and dating of specific components. Within a 1-acre
midden, Webb found no prepared hearths or ash beds, but several large fire-blackened stone
clusters composed of burned sandstone cobbles and pebbles, and other larger stone objects, as well
as eight concentrations of ash and charcoal (Webb et al. 1969:15–16, Figure 5). A subsequent
reevaluation of the site’s original soil profile (Webb et al. 1969:Figure 4a) by Abbott (2009)
identified this slightly darker sediment, originally termed a midden deposit, as a natural A-B
horizon sequence. With the exception of a few possible post molds and five small pieces of daub, the
site lacked any evidence of architecture, and there was no sign of more-permanent, formal features
such as mounds or cemeteries. It is thus probable that the site was occupied seasonally over
thousands of years by returning small family groups whose primary activity at the site was the
gathering of nuts, an abundant local food source (Webb et al. 1969:103).

Folly (41RK16)

The Folly site occupied an area of roughly 370 m2 (4,000 ft2) on two knolls overlooking Dry Creek in
northeastern Rusk County (Jarvis 1972), approximately 5.3 km (33 miles) southwest of the
Hawkwind site. In conjunction with the Texas Department of Highways and Public Transportation
(now TxDOT), the Texas Archeological Salvage Project (TASP) of The University of Texas (UT)
performed 17.4 m2 (187.5 ft2) (or 11.3 m3) of test excavations at the site in 1972 before it was
flooded by Martin Lake. These investigations produced 26 ceramic sherds (17 after refitting).
Temper was highly variable among the recovered sherds, with eight combinations of temper being
noted. Jarvis notes the similarity of pottery from this site with the ceramics recovered at the Resch
site, with the presence of an unusual style of rim notching being present at both sites. Five dart
points were identified, all of which fit the morphological definition of the Gary type, as well as a few
unidentifiable point fragments. Two pitted stones were also recovered. The only feature identified
was a single rock hearth. Although three small fragments of daub were also recovered, their small
size and number would be more consistent with temporary rather than permanent structures.
Although no charcoal was recovered for dating, the small size of the assemblage and the types of
artifacts recovered suggest a brief Woodland period occupation by a small, possibly family, group
(Jarvis 1972).

Herman Ballew (41RK222)

Located above Mill Creek in Rusk County, the Herman Ballew site lies approximately 65 km
(43 miles) west-southwest of the Hawkwind site. Measuring roughly 2,700 m2 (29,000 ft2) across a
sandy toeslope, the site was subjected to data recovery investigations in 1993 and 1994 (Rogers et
al. 2001). Eleven backhoe trenches were excavated, covering almost 1,500 m2 (16,000 ft2), and
182 m2 (1,959 ft2) was excavated by hand. Paleoindian to Caddo artifacts and features were found,
but the site also possessed a large Woodland component, which included the majority of the site’s
225 ceramic sherds (Perttula 2001). Lithic artifacts included 104 dart points, of which 67 percent
Atkins 100018032/120087

3. Cultural Setting
were classified into eight varieties of the Gary type. Sixty-two percent of the 45 arrow points were
typed as Friley. In addition to chipped stone artifacts, 69 ground stone artifacts were recovered,
including a sizable number of pitted manos and “nutting stones” (Rogers et al. 2001).

While there were no midden deposits, mounds, cemeteries, or indications of architecture, 16
features were recorded, including burned rock scatters, rock-lined hearths, and storage or cooking
pits (Rogers et al. 2001). Unfortunately, it could not readily be determined whether these features
could be attributed to the Woodland period occupation. Radiocarbon analysis dates the Woodland
period occupations at Herman Ballew to between ca. 200 B.C. and A.D. 800 (Perttula and Nelson
2004:156), with Perttula observing ceramic sherds falling into pre- and post-400 A.D. categories
(Perttula and Nelson 2004:159). These sherds are of a variety of pastes and tempers, much more
similar to neighboring Mill Creek sites within the Middle Sabine River basin than those found at
sites associated with the Fourche Maline or Mossy Grove cultures (Perttula 2001).

Broadway (41SM273)

The Broadway site was located on Mud Creek, a tributary of the Angelina River, roughly 85 km
(53 miles) west of the Hawkwind site. The site was subjected to data recovery excavations in 2002
as a result of improvements within the City of Tyler, Texas (Perttula and Nelson 2004). Excavations
occurred within an approximately 1,000 m2 (10, 706 ft2) section of the site, and included a series of
backhoe trenches and a total of 97 m2 (1,044 ft2) of hand excavations. The site comprised both
Woodland and Caddo components but was dominated by the latter. Of the over 2,000 ceramic
sherds recovered, only about 130, primarily grog-tempered and relatively thin, were judged to be
associated with the Woodland period. Among these 130 sherds, a significant number contained
bone and hematite inclusions; however, the bone-tempered sherds were not as thick or as coarsely
tempered as Cooper Boneware, the Fourche Maline type described by Schambach (1998). Very few
coarse sandy paste sherds were recovered, and no obvious LMV ceramics were found.
Approximately 13 percent were decorated, a rather high number when compared to
contemporaneous sites (Perttula and Nelson 2004:159). Four ground stone tools were recovered
from the Woodland component, including bi-pitted manos and a grinding slab. Twenty-eight dart
points were recovered; eight of these were recovered from the Woodland period component, and
all were classified as Gary, var. Camden.
Special analyses indicated that the site was initially occupied between ca. A.D. 300 and 800 by
Woodland peoples, then abandoned and subsequently reoccupied by the Caddo around A.D. 900
(Perttula and Nelson 2004:38). Perttula suggests that the site was occupied periodically over
centuries by mobile hunter-gatherers, owing to the low density of artifacts, the lack of
contemporary midden deposits, and the absence of features other than occasional charcoal stains
(Perttula and Nelson 2004:155).

Hawkwind Site (41HS915)

Haddens Bend (16DS203)
The Haddens Bend site is located in the southwestern corner of De Soto Parish, Louisiana,
approximately 204 km (127miles) southeast of the Hawkwind site. It was situated on the eastern
cut bank side of a prominent bend in the Sabine River at the margins of the Mill Creek culture area.
What remained of the site was a 20-m (66-ft)-wide strip extending roughly 100 m (328 ft) along the
riverbank (Bryan 1984). The site was first tested in 1962 by TASP (Scurlock 1964). After 7 m2
(75 ft2) of hand excavation and numerous shovel tests, the site was recommended for further
investigation. Southern Methodist University (SMU) picked up work at the site in 1966, excavating
56 m2 (183 ft2) by hand and five mechanical trenches totaling 92 m (301 ft) in length (Jensen
1968a; see also Story 1990:315). The SMU collections were subsequently reexamined by Bryan
(1984) at UT.

Dating of the site’s prehistoric component was based on the relative dating of diagnostic artifacts,
which indicated multiple occupations ranging from Paleoindian to the historic period. The
Paleoindian occupation appears to have been brief and rather ephemeral. Occupation during the
Middle and Late Archaic is more intensive based on the presence of a range of contracting-,
straight-, and expanding-stemmed dart points such as Gary, Kent, and Palmillas (Bryan 1984;
Jensen 1968b).

Ceramics at the site are quite varied. Jensen’s (1968a) investigations produced 350 sherds, which
he separated into categories based on paste, surface treatment, and decoration. Subsequent
reanalysis by Bryan (1984) confirmed the variability in the ceramic assemblage. Some clearly had
the well-worked paste, tempering, and decorative techniques typical of Middle Caddo pottery.
However, roughly 60 percent of the collection bore similarities to the technologically earlier
ceramics found at the Resch site. In addition, the paste characteristics and decorative techniques
(e.g., Tchefuncte-like nontempered pastes and Marksville-like decorative motifs) found on many of
these earlier Haddens Bend ceramics point to LMV influences, while the sandy paste ceramics
suggest ties to the southern Gulf Coast (Mossy Grove) cultures.

FOURCHE MALINE CULTURAL TRADITIONS

To the north of the Hawkwind site and the Mill Creek culture area, the Woodland period cultures
known as the Fourche Maline cover an area lying south of the Arkansas Valley in western Arkansas
that extends into the Ouachita Mountains of eastern Oklahoma and southeast into northwestern
Louisiana (Schambach 2002:91 and Figure 5.1). In East Texas, the Fourche Maline culture extends
into the area south of the Red River and its tributary, the Sulphur River. Schambach (1998, 2001,
2002:Figure 5.1) sees the Fourche Maline culture area as being much more extensive, including
sites as far south as the George C. Davis (41CE19) site and the lower reaches of the Trinity River,
inclusions that are deemed highly conjectural by Black and Story (2003) and Story (1990:277, 293).
Atkins 100018032/120087

3. Cultural Setting
The Fourche Maline tradition has its beginnings in preceramic Archaic times, with pottery making
its first appearance somewhere around 300 B.C. in Oklahoma (Leith 2011) and around 400 B.C. in
Arkansas (Schambach 1982). Sites recognized as part of the Fourche Maline tradition are typically
relatively large, with deep middens, often containing burials, suggesting possibly continuous
occupation based on horticulture and a less-mobile lifestyle (Schambach 2001:21–22) (see Table
2). Artifacts commonly found at Fourche Maline sites include Gary dart points and its many
variants, seed-grinding stones, boatstones, double-bitted axes (probably hoelike gardening tools),
modeled-clay platform pipes, and Poole clay pipes. Evidence of contact with LMV peoples is
represented by small quantities of Tchefuncte, Marksville, and Coles Creek pottery types from many
of the larger sites. However, the hallmark of Fourche Maline culture is the “robust, but mostly plain,
ceramic assemblages consisting of flat-bottomed, often flower-pot shaped jars tempered with
crushed bone, grit, sand, or grog, with the most common types being Williams Plain, Cooper
Boneware, and Ouachita Plain” (Schambach 2002:91–93).
Named for Fourche Maline Creek, a tributary of the Poteau River, in the Wister Valley of
southeastern Oklahoma, some of the earliest evidence of the Fourche Maline culture comes from
sites in the Ouachita and Red River valleys in southwestern Arkansas and the Great Bend area of
northwestern Louisiana (Bell 1980; Schambach 2002; Sharrock 1960). Work in this area was
originally done in the 1930s by archeologists working with the Works Progress Administration
(WPA) on several sites in the valley (e.g., the Wann, Scott, and Sam sites) that were typified by deep,
black Archaic and Woodland period middens, burial mounds, a high percentage of Gary dart points,
and large numbers of grog-tempered ceramics.

One of the notable sites is the Wann (34Lf-27) site in east central Oklahoma. The site occupies a low
knoll in the bottomland between two creeks in the Poteau River basin. The site, when initially
excavated by the WPA in the fall of 1940, was believed to consist of the entire mound, measuring
46 m (150 ft) by 23 m (75 ft), only approximately 38 m (125 ft) by 15 (50 ft) of which was
excavated (Sharrock 1960). The initial investigations revealed 27 burials within a dark midden fill,
with ash deposits located throughout. The investigations produced 1,547 projectile points, 1,037 of
which were typed as Gary, and 2,932 sherds, 92.4 percent of which were grog tempered and
categorized as Williams Plain (Sharrock 1960:38). Among the 2,932 sherds found at the site, over
92 percent were categorized as Williams Plain (Sharrock 1960:38). The paste was described as
poorly mixed, with an unpulverized, granular clay temper. Paste color varied from gray to dark
brown. Rims were normally straight with predominantly rounded, then tapered lip edges, but rims
with flattened lip edges were present. Thicknesses were highly variable but averaged around
12 millimeters (mm). Bases were overwhelmingly flat, thick, and circular in outline; however, a
small number of square bases were also recovered. No complete pots were found, but the primary
form was apparently large bowl-shaped vessels. The remaining 8 percent of the ceramics included
an array of variously tempered wares. Unfortunately, the mixed stratigraphy of the midden
deposits at the Wann site (as well as those found at other sites in the area) makes it extremely
difficult to separate the Fourche Maline component from the Archaic component.

Hawkwind Site (41HS915)
The first to identify the Fourche Maline tradition outside of Oklahoma was W. Raymond Wood
(1981) in his report on the Poole site (3GA3), located on the upper Ouachita River in southwestern
Arkansas. The site was first formally excavated by the University of Arkansas Museum in 1931 and
later more fully by the WPA from 1939 to 1940 (Wood 1981). The full extent of the site was not
recorded, but it likely occupied much of the terrace, which measured roughly 750 m (2,460 ft) along
the river and 200 m (656 ft) wide. Two mounds, measuring 30 m (98 ft) and 10 m (32 ft) in
diameter, were located close to the edge of the terrace, but were not formally excavated so it is
uncertain if they were manmade or natural. The WPA excavated three plots across an alluvial
terrace and found burials in each area, as well as the remains of a large rectangular house in one
area, but there was no evidence of the typical Fourche Maline black midden (Wood 1981). Thirtyseven burials were uncovered. The majority date to the Caddo period; however, as Wood (1981:54)
notes, the mortuary features assigned to the Fourche Maline period were somewhat speculative
given the nature of the excavations. Thus, the two sets of burials represented at the Poole site may
simply represent alternative treatments of socially different members of the same cultural group
rather than burials associated with two different occupations at the site.

The range of artifacts suggests two different Fourche Maline occupations consisting of a major
middle period component and a significantly smaller, ephemeral late component. Of the nearly 600
sherds found at the Poole site that were associated with the Fourche Maline occupations, over
92 percent were assigned to the Williams Plain type, with an additional 6 percent categorized as
Williams Incised (Wood 1981:33–34). A few modified platform pipes were also recovered. Over
60 percent of the site’s total 251 dart points were typed as Gary.

South of the Poole site, Fourche Maline components have been identified and described at the
Means (3HS3), and Cooper (3HS1) sites (Schambach 1998). In the Great Bend region, Fourche
Maline components have been identified at several key sites such as Johnny Ford (3LA5), where
diagnostic artifacts include the LeFlore variety of Gary projectile points, double-bitted chipped
stone axes, and Cooper Boneware and Williams Plain pottery (Schambach 2001). At Fourche Maline
sites in these areas, ceramics are abundant and compose a significant proportion of the artifact
assemblage.
In the Red River Valley, Fourche Maline period mound sites appear around ca. 200–100 B.C. The
first were small domed mounds built atop crematoria such as that at the Shane’s Village and Mound
site (3LA75 and 3LA6, respectively). These small domed mounds were common to Early and Middle
Woodland sites in the Eastern Woodlands (Perttula 2003); however, sometime between A.D. 100–
300, mound construction changed, incorporating secondary deposits of cremations and caches of
exotic material. These types of mounds are known from excavations at the Red Hill mound site
(3LA21). The Jonas Short Mound (41SA101), located 150 miles to the southwest shares similarities
with both of these early mound types (discussed in more detail later). Post–A.D. 600, mounds were
being built in stages, with offerings placed atop each stage then covered by a thin cap of clay. The
Crenshaw site (3MI6) exemplifies this type of mound (Schambach 1982).

3. Cultural Setting
In nearby northwestern Louisiana, the earliest pottery is irregularly distributed and appears to
have been fairly sporadic until the Middle Woodland period (ca. 100 B.C.). Cultural influences from
the LMV Tchefuncte (ca. 500 B.C.–A.D. 1) and Marksville (ca. A.D. 1–400) groups are evident in the
technological similarities observed in the local wares. While many of the ceramics recovered here
are characterized by crude, poorly wedged, and nontempered pastes, the majority of Middle
Woodland period ceramics are relatively thick, undecorated wares with coarse grog- and/or bonetempered pastes. Late Woodland period pottery was dominated by jars and simple bowls with
relatively thick walls. Although grog-, grit-, and bone-tempered vessels occur, assemblages are
usually dominated by grog-tempered wares, and bone-tempered wares are rare (Girard 2012).

Sites with discrete Woodland components are not numerous in the far northeastern part of Texas,
and our knowledge of such sites comes in large part from salvage excavations in the Sulphur River
basin carried out in anticipation of the Texarkana and Cooper Reservoirs (Story 1990:303–309).
The Cooper Reservoir area is located in the Middle to South Sulphur River drainage in the upper
portion of the basin. In this area, sites with Woodland components include such sites as Arnold
(41HP102) and 41HP137 (Fields et al. 1997; Gadus et al. 1991; McGregor et al. 1996). The presence
of three distinctive groups of ceramic artifacts at the Arnold site include a number of thick-walled
base and body sherds from flowerpot-shaped vessels reminiscent of Williams Plain, and ceramics
with decorative techniques reminiscent of one or another of the Coles Creek types common in the
LMV (Doehner and Larson 1978).

The Texarkana Reservoir area is located in the lower portion of the Sulphur River basin.
Archeological investigations in this area have identified a number of sites, one of the most notable
being the Snipes (41CS8) site (Jelks 1961), with both Williams Plain and Coles Creek incised vessels
(Table 4). Many of the more significant sites (e.g., Bert Davis [41HP3] and W.A. Ford [41TT2])
outside the reservoir areas were investigated over a period of 60 years by archeologists from UT,
but have never been fully examined or formally reported on (Story 1990:303). A few sites outside
the reservoir areas, such as Tankersley Creek (41TT108) and Yarbrough (41VN6), have been the
subject of more-intensive evaluation (Johnson 1962; Young 1981) (see Table 4).

Unfortunately, more-extensive excavations at many of the known sites with Woodland/Early
Ceramic components has proved them to be disturbed either by agricultural activities, pot hunters,
or early less-rigorous archeological excavation techniques. For example at the Arnold site
(41HP102), located on a low rise in the Sulphur River floodplain, the results of several excavations
at the site indicate multiple components dating to the Late Woodland period and Early to Middle
Caddo periods (Doehner and Larson 1978; Gadus et al. 1991). The various excavation strategies
employed at the sites made it difficult to separate the various components; however, it was still
possible to obtain general information about the nature of the Early Ceramic artifact assemblage.
The relevant distribution of artifacts and the radiocarbon dates are all consistent with occupations
during these time periods, as are the large number of Gary dart points (n = 74) and the presence of
three distinctive groups of ceramics artifacts. The Woodland period occupation is discernible by the

number of sherds consisting of thick-walled base and body junctures representing flowerpotshaped vessels reminiscent of Williams Plain, and ceramics with decorative techniques reminiscent
of one or another of the Coles Creek types common in the LMV. Gadus et al. (1991:95) believe a
reanalysis of the entire site assemblage is warranted in order to coordinate data from the various
excavations done at the site and more-systematically address questions of overall site patterning,
ceramic and lithic typology, and bioarcheological analyses of human skeletal remains. This is an
effort that needs to be pursued at more sites in the region in order to more fully understand
Woodland period occupations at sites in this area of East Texas.

MOSSY GROVE CULTURE/TRADITION

The Mossy Grove culture/tradition lies to the south of the middle Sabine River basin, occupying an
area that extends from the Brazos River Delta up the Texas coast to the Sabine River Delta and
adjacent southwestern Louisiana (see Figure 6). During the preceramic cultural sequence, there
appears to have been some degree of interaction between the early southeast Texas cultural groups
and the southeastern Woodland populations; however, many of the critical hallmarks and key
chronological indicators of the southeastern cultures are missing (e.g., villages with moderately
large sedentary populations, horticulture, large platform mounds, and ceremonial centers). The
earliest ceramics appear in and around the Sabine Lake and the Galveston Bay area and are
technologically related to the Tchefuncte and Marksville types of the LMV. The introduction of
ceramics brought with it significant post-Archaic manifestations that served to further differentiate
the cultural groups of southeastern Texas from the Mississippian cultures of western Louisiana and
the emerging Caddo cultures to the northeast (Aten and Bollich 2011). The archeological evidence
shows that the technological traditions and adaptive strategies evinced during the Woodland/Early
Ceramic period represent regionally distinct manifestations that Story (1990) has labeled the
"Mossy Grove Culture/Tradition.” Story (1990:Figure 39) presented this designation as a heuristic
concept to link and facilitate discussion of a number of similar yet locally distinct cultural
manifestations. In general, the Mossy Grove tradition defines the broad context of the late
prehistoric cultures in which sites depict both a general cultural pattern and a regional cultural
tradition that partly parallels the later Caddo tradition/culture to the north and encompasses the
archeological remains of what were probably different ethnic and linguistic groups (Moore 1995;
Perttula 1993; Story 1990).

Within the Mossy Grove tradition, regional variations in settlement and subsistence patterns,
technology, and ethnic affiliations indicate the presence of two subregions: the Coastal margins and
the Inland Coastal Plain. Not surprisingly, each region roughly corresponds to natural
physiographic regions, with the adaptive strategies of the coastal groups being geared toward the
Gulf Coast Prairies and Marshes and adaptive strategies of the inland groups being geared toward
the Piney Woods. Research indicates that both temporal and spatial differences existed between the
two subregions (Aten 1983; Ellis and Ellis 1995; Ricklis 2004; Story 1990), with the presence of
sandy paste ceramics being the most unifying trait.

Atkins 100018032/120087

3. Cultural Setting
Beginning around 2,500 years ago, the inland Mossy Grove culture encompassed Woodland period
archeological sites that extended as far inland as the Neches and Angelina River basin and into the
upper portions of Attoyac Bayou in east Texas (Perttula 2010; Perttula, ed. 2008; Story 1990). Sites
in this area point to a people who were primarily “hunting-gathering foragers” with relatively
mobile settlements and a material culture dominated by plain sandy paste ceramics and dart points.
By about A.D. 500–600, there appears to be a shift in settlement location from the uplands/high
ridge tops to the low sandy ridges overlooking the confluence of small drainages and river
floodplains. Archeologists have suggested that this hints at developing sedentism possibly tied to a
shift in subsistence strategies (Cliff 1998; Corbin 1998; Moore 1995; Perttula, ed. 2008).

Compared to Fourche Maline assemblages in the Great Bend region of the Red River (Schambach
2002), the cultural material found at Woodland period Mossy Grove sites is much less impressive.
Material from habitation sites in the Neches-Angelina area such as Deshazo (Story 1995) and sites
in the Lake Naconiche area, such as Boyette (41NA285) and Naconiche Creek (41NA236), are not
nearly as rich or the artifacts nearly as varied (Perttula, ed. 2008) (see Table 4). In general,
archeological deposits at inland Mossy Grove sites are marked by small lithic scatters, small
numbers of sandy paste sherds, a few ground stone tools, and fire-cracked rocks. No midden
deposits have been recognized, and there is a general dearth of features (Perttula, ed. 2008).

Several sites in the Livingston Reservoir area, such as Jones Hill (41PK8), 41PK21, and Crawford
(41PK69), also have Woodland period components (Ensor and Carlson 1988; McClurkan 1968).
The earliest occupation at the Jones Hill site has been dated to A.D. 540, and the artifact assemblage
is in line with similarly aged Mossy Gove sites given the presence of plain sandy paste pottery, Gary
dart points, and contracting-stem dart points (McClurkan 1968). At 41PK21, the assemblage also
includes Gary and Kent dart points and plain sandy paste or sand-tempered pottery; however,
Marksville Stamped sherds were also recovered.

The shifting/partially overlapping nature of the Fourche Maline, Mill Creek, and Mossy Grove
cultural traditions is exemplified by a site whose physical locations place it within the boundaries of
the Mossy Grove cultural tradition, but whose artifact assemblage more closely matches aspects of
Fourche Maline cultural traditions or shares similarities with LMV assemblages. The Jonas Short
Mound (41SA101) is a distinctive site located by Jelks (1965) while doing salvage archeology in the
proposed McGee Bend Reservoir. Located in San Augustine County, Jelks (1965:44) notes that
besides the presence of Gary and Kent dart points, the artifact assemblage at the Jonas Short Mound
is quite different from assemblages present at other sites in the then-proposed McGee Bend
Reservoir (now Sam Rayburn Reservoir). The principal feature identified at the site was an earthen
mound, measuring approximately 29 m in diameter at the base and rising to a maximum height of
approximately 2.15 to 2.45 m above the surface of the alluvial terrace. Two burials were found, only
one of which was found within the mound. Burial 1, was a semiflexed inhumation encountered in an
oval grave located approximately 61 m due west of the mound. Two Perdiz points were found
Atkins 100018032/120087

39

Hawkwind Site (41HS915)
resting on the right fibula. A small flake and a third Perdiz point were recovered from the burial fill.
Jelks (1965) believed this burial was affiliated with later occupations at the site.

Burial 2 was a cremation found at the base of the mound in a shallow saucer-shaped depression
that had been excavated into the alluvial terrace. The cremated remains of two or more individuals
were scattered over an area of burned soil measuring roughly 183 x 61 cm. Resting among the bone
fragments were two copper bracelets, including one reel-shaped in the Hopewellian form. Bits of
charcoal were scattered over the area, and patches of burned organic material adhered to the bone
fragments, suggesting the bodies had been cremated in place. The mound had then been erected
atop the cremation (Jelks 1965; McClurkan et al. 1980). Random artifacts were included in the
mound fill; however, five artifact caches were also found in the mound fill. Since no intrusive pits
were discernible in the mound, the caches appeared to have been purposely placed. Artifacts in the
caches included two boatstones made of horneblend syenite, a number of grooved and ungrooved
quartz crystals, perforated elks teeth, Gary and Kent dart points, flakes of silicified wood, and a
copper reel-shaped gorget. At least two of the caches also contained human bone fragments.

As noted previously, construction of the Jonas Short Mound is similar to the small domed mounds
found at Fourche Maline sites in the Red River Valley (ca. 200 to 100 B.C.). However, given the
incorporation of secondary human remains and artifact caches of exotic materials, the construction
techniques employed on the Jonas Short mound are similar to Fourche Maline mound construction
techniques dating between A.D. 100 and 300. It’s construction techniques also parallel those used to
construct the Coral Snake Mound, located 400 m east of the Sabine River in Sabine Parish, Louisiana
(McClurkan et al. 1980); however, there are also a number of differences (Jensen 1968b).

The Coral Snake Mound (16SA48) site is located on a terrace remnant in the floodplain of the
Sabine River, in Sabine Parish, Louisiana, roughly 65 km (40 miles) to the northeast of the Jonas
Short Mound and 94 km (58 miles) downstream from the Hawkwind site. The Coral Snake Mound
site represents a single mortuary mound without evidence of contemporaneous habitation. It was
excavated by TASP in 1965 (McClurkan 1966), and then again in 1966–1967 by SMU (Jensen
1968a). The records of both projects were later reexamined by Pegi Jodry at UT (1983).

The roughly conical-shaped mound, 24 m (79 ft) in diameter and 2.5 m (8 ft) in height, had been
constructed in three distinct stages: an excavated pit, an inner mound fill, and a mound cap (Jensen
1968a). During the first phase of construction, a basin-shaped depression measuring 1.2 m deep
and 6 m in diameter was excavated into the existing floodplain. Subsequent to excavation of the
depression, several fire “basins” and cremations had been dug into the depression. During the
second stage, the primary mound was constructed, consisting of a low conical structure that
measured 90 cm high and 12 to 15 m in diameter. Much of this primary mound was composed of
borrow from the first stage. Profiles of the primary mound indicate that fill from the original basin
had been piled around the edges of the basin-shaped depression and left in place when the primary
mound was built over it. This fill formed the outer edge of the primary mound. During the third and
Atkins 100018032/120087

40

3. Cultural Setting
final stage of the process, the primary mound was then covered completely with sand. Interspersed
within this fill were more than 70 features, including fire basins, cremations, bundle burials, and
artifact caches. The completed mound measured roughly 3 m high and 30 m in diameter (Jensen
1968a:78–79; Story 1990:283).

A wide array of artifacts was found, including boatstones, copper items, an incised quartz pendant,
red ochre, and various lithic artifacts, including several large knives (Jodry 1983:16). Fifty points, of
which 15 were typed as Gary, and 141 ceramic sherds were recovered from the excavations.
Ceramics included LMV wares and Fourche Maline types, as well as a small number of Late Caddo
types that had been incorporated with the mound fill (Jodry 1983:Appendix B).
Citing radiocarbon dates between 1260 B.C. to A.D. 300, Jensen (1968b:106) believed these to be
built over time (Jensen 1968b:39–40). However, based on the assemblage of offerings, Jodry
(1983:22) estimated that the maximum time interval between the last two stages of the Coral Snake
Mound construction dated to ca. A.D. 1 to 200/250, prompting Story to posit that the mound could
have equally been built during a single event (Story 1990:283). However, given its multistage
construction techniques, it seems more likely that it was built over a span of time, albeit it a
relatively short one. Even so, the radiocarbon dates suggest that the Coral Snake Mound and the
Jonas Short Mound were roughly contemporaneous.

Thus, the archeological evidence from the Woodland components at the Jonas Short Mound site
suggests that the groups occupying this site during the Early Ceramic were more closely aligned
with Fourche Maline or LMV cultural traditions than Mossy Grove cultural traditions. This begs the
question, how closely connected were the Woodland period populations associated with the
Fourche Maline, the Mill Creek, and the Mossy Gove traditions? Further, what level of social
interaction existed among the various Woodland period groups? And, to what degree do the
differences we see at various sites simply result from within-group variability in the adoption of
specific technologies? It will take the identification and excavation of more Woodland period sites
to fully investigate these questions.

SUMMARY

As discussed above, the archeological evidence from sites with Woodland period components
points to a changing cultural landscape that is marked by lifestyle changes occurring in tandem
with technological changes. The accumulated evidence seems to suggest that most, if not all, of the
technological changes associated with the beginnings of the Woodland/Early Ceramic period in
East Texas, did, in fact, enter the region after the end of the Archaic period (Cliff 1998:105).
However, one of the most notable of these technological changes was the introduction of ceramics,
which ironically may actually predate the beginning of the Early Ceramic period. Thus, as pointed
out at the beginning of this chapter, the Early Ceramic period may simply represent the gradual
addition of new technologies to an Archaic base that was precipitated by the “combined pressures

of increasing within-group populations and increasing between-group packing” (Cliff 1998:105).
We see the evidence of this in the subtle, and not so subtle, differences among assemblages
associated with each of the three major cultural traditions recognized in East Texas.

DATA RECOVERY: RESEARCH TOPICS, FIELD METHODS,
AND LABORATORY METHODS

by Damon Burden, Robert Rogers, Linda W. Ellis, and Ardi J. Kalter
Field investigations at site 41HS915 in Harrison County, Texas, were conducted by Atkins between
August 9, 2009, and September 19, 2009. This chapter begins with a brief discussion of the
sequence of events. This is followed by a presentation of the research topics that guided data
recovery investigations at the site. The chapter concludes with a summary of the field and
laboratory methods employed.

Based on the results of testing (Abbott et al. 2009), TxDOT ENV considered the evidence of a
Woodland period occupation in the site’s deposits important for its potential to contribute to a
poorly understood time period in East Texas. Although the vertical and spatial integrity of the
archeological deposits appeared to be comprised, TxDOT ENV believed that the site had the
potential to address questions important to prehistory, and thus, considered it to be eligible for
designation as an archeological historic property (36 CFR 800.16(l)) and for formal designation as a
State Archeological Landmark (13 TAC 26.12). However, the site’s eligibility was believed to be
dependent on the compositional integrity of the assemblage as a whole and the ability of the
investigating parties to process a sufficient volume of site matrix to recover a large enough
assemblage to convincingly demonstrate that integrity. A Scope of Work for data recovery
excavations relevant to this goal was formulated. This document was submitted to and approved by
the Texas Historical Commission (THC) in 2009.

Following field investigations at the site, an interim report discussing the results of the data
recovery efforts was submitted to TxDOT ENV in November of 2009. This report presented a
preliminary artifact analysis, evaluated the assemblage with respect to potential research
questions, and presented a National Register of Historic Places (NRHP) eligibility recommendation
for site 41HS915. In 2011, a Research Design for the analysis of data recovery investigations of the
Hawkwind site was submitted and subsequently approved (Rogers 2011).

RESEARCH TOPICS

The Hawkwind site lies within the Mill Creek cultural area, an area that encompasses Woodland
period occupations that occurred in the Sabine River, Big Cypress Creek, and upper Angelina River
basin between ca. 2,400 and 1,150 years ago (Perttula and Nelson 2004:155). To date, this cultural
area is best identified at the Herman Ballew site (41RK222), excavated by Atkins in 1994 (Rogers et
Atkins 100018032/120087

43

Hawkwind Site (41HS915)
al. 2001); however, other important sites with Woodland period components include the Folly
(41RK26), Resch (41HR16), and Broadway (41SM273) sites.

As previously described, spatial and stratigraphic integrity of the Hawkwind site was recognized to
be poor prior to data recovery, but compositional integrity appeared relatively high. In other words,
while the materials were clearly jumbled in the site matrix, the initial artifact sample suggested that
practically all the material was of Woodland age with only some overprinting of later (Caddo)
artifacts and/or an earlier (Archaic) component. Thus, the Hawkwind site had the potential for
yielding a reliable Woodland period assemblage. Consequently, analysis focused on diagnostic
artifacts (ceramics and lithic tools, including chipped and ground stone). Other parts of the
assemblage (e.g., lithic debitage, faunal, and floral material) were described but not analyzed in
detail. Based on findings at the Hawkwind site and comparisons made with other site assemblages
in the Middle Sabine River basin and adjacent areas, the following questions were proposed in
order to assess Woodland period adaptations in the Middle Sabine River basin.

Research Topic 1

How do the ceramics at Hawkwind compare with those at Middle Sabine River basin sites such as
Folly, Resch, and Herman Ballew?
The Herman Ballew site was reported on relatively recently (Rogers et al. 2001), and the analysis of
the ceramic assemblage from the site was thorough and in-depth (Perttula 2001). The Folly and
Resch sites, on the other hand, were excavated and analyzed roughly 40 years ago (Jarvis 1972;
Webb et al. 1969), though the ceramics from both sites were later given a cursory examination by
Dee Ann Story (Story et al. 1990). The assemblages from both sites are curated at the Texas
Archeological Research Laboratory (TARL). It was proposed that the Woodland ceramic
assemblage from these two sites be reexamined using the same ceramic analytical techniques used
at the Herman Ballew site and the Hawkwind site. The ceramic assemblage (n = 17) from the Folly
site was small; therefore, it was examined in its entirety. The size of the Resch ceramic assemblage
(n = 1,541) required a sampling strategy. As with so many older collections, the organizational state
of the collection, as well as the mixed stratigraphy at the site, heavily influenced the sampling
strategy and the selection of samples for reanalysis. In general, sherds were selected on the basis of
vessel groups and were designed to maximize heterogeneity of the sample. Preference was given to
sherds with appreciable organic residue and sherds large enough to be broken to submit
subsamples for instrumental neutron activation analysis (INAA), petrography, and dating. Given
these criteria, roughly 10 percent of the Woodland sherds from the Resch site were reanalyzed. The
character of the ceramics from the Resch, Folly, and Herman Ballew sites was then compared and
contrasted with the Hawkwind ceramic assemblage.
It was proposed that representative samples of sherds from the analytical groups from each site be
submitted for ceramic petrography and INAA. Following analyses of all sherds at the macro scale,
Atkins 100018032/120087

44

4. Data Recovery: Research Topics,
Field Methods, and Laboratory Methods
17 sherds from the Resch site, 1 raw clay sample collected ¼ mile southwest of the Resch site, 2
sherds from the Folly site, and 20 sherds from the Hawkwind site were submitted for special
studies. The completion of these studies provided additional information relevant to each
assemblage and their possible relationships to one another.

As part of this task, a program of direct radiocarbon dating of ceramic sherds would also be
conducted. The sampling strategy included targeting Hawkwind sherds with charred residue
and/or sherds with a high organic content that could be submitted for bulk organic dating. Initially,
it was proposed that at least one or two Caddo sherds recovered from the Hawkwind site would be
dated for comparison; however, no Caddo sherds were found among the recovered sherds.

Research Topic 2

Given its close proximity to Resch, is there evidence in the materials at Hawkwind that the two sites
may have been occupied by the same Woodland group(s)?
The Resch site lies about 675 m north of Hawkwind. While the total site assemblage there included
Late Archaic and Caddo components, most of the materials recovered were Woodland in age. Webb
et al. (1969:98) interpreted the site as having been reoccupied on numerous occasions by native
peoples who were exploiting the natural resources in the area, especially hardwood nuts. The
materials they left behind included 1,525 ceramic sherds (2.15 per m3), 460 projectile points
(0.65 per m3), and 38,400 pieces of debitage (54.2 per m3). Preliminary analysis of the Hawkwind
site assemblage from the TxDOT ENV investigations (Abbott et al. 2009) and the current study
indicates relatively similar recovery rates, with approximately 137 ceramics (1.75 m3), 95 projectile
points (1.7 m3), and 3,449 pieces of debitage (42.5 m3).

Radiocarbon dates (obtained in reverse stratigraphic order) of 1430 B.P. (Late Woodland) and
3510 B.P. (Late Archaic) have been secured for Hawkwind from TxDOT excavations. Both were
taken from charred nutshell (Abbott et al. 2009). Unfortunately, the radiocarbon evidence from
Resch is limited to dates of 410, 300, and 200 B. C. and A. D. 100. These were obtained from charred
nutshell, which Webb (1969:95) did not believe accurately reflected the age of the levels they
originated from (they were largely reversed), and he attributed this to aboriginal churning and
subsequent heavy gopher disturbance. Additional absolute dates for the Hawkwind site were
needed to determine whether occupations at the Hawkwind site may have overlapped those at
Resch site.

Addressing this research topic centered on comparing the characteristics of the Woodland period
ceramic assemblages of the Resch and Hawkwind sites. Ceramic types, paste constituents,
manufacturing techniques, and firing characteristics of the ceramics recovered at both sites would
be examined on a macro scale. Ceramic petrography compared the mineral suites, paste
characteristics, and inclusions for similarities. INAA would be useful in further identifying
Atkins 100018032/120087

45

Hawkwind Site (41HS915)
elemental compositions and possible shared clay source areas. It was proposed that a sample of
sherds from the Resch site would be submitted for INAA and petrographic analysis. It was further
proposed that should this analysis identify sherds that appear to share a common origin, bulk
radiocarbon dating be used to further substantiate possible relationships. It was estimated that 5 to
10 sherds exhibiting similarities in the above-mentioned characteristics be submitted for bulk
radiocarbon dating.

The characterization of the Woodland ceramic sample from the Resch site used in addressing
Research Topic 1 was also used in assessing whether the Resch and Hawkwind sites share a
common occupational history.

Research Topic 3

What does the presence of LMV ceramics at the Hawkwind, Resch, Herman Ballew, and other Middle
Sabine River basin sites tell us about interregional exchange and interaction between the two areas?
While only a sparse amount of LMV pottery has thus far been identified at the Hawkwind site,
substantial amounts were recovered from the nearby Resch and Herman Ballew sites in the Middle
Sabine River basin of Texas, as well as sites such as Swan Lake (16BO11) and Coral Snake Mound in
the basin in northwestern Louisiana. These ceramics indicate that contacts existed between the
LMV and the Middle Sabine River basin during Tchefuncte, Marksville, and Coles Creek times.
The goal of this research topic was to try to assess the nature of these contacts. Did networks exist
between the LMV and this part of east Texas that were based on the trade of natural resources? Are
the LMV items in the Middle Sabine River basin found at specific kinds of sites? To address these
types of questions, the locations of all known Woodland sites in the Middle Sabine River basin
would be examined in detail with regard to environmental and cultural characteristics. This
included plotting the sites on U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) topographic maps to see whether
patterns emerge related to their location, such as proximity to rivers or high-order streams.
Plotting the site locations on geological and soil maps may result in further patterns emerging, such
as their locations with regard to proximity to chert- or quartzite-bearing formations, or other useful
rock or mineral outcrops, and well-drained soils. The location of the sites on vegetation maps or
their position relative to biotic zones may also provide insight regarding the importance of plant
communities such as hardwood forests.

The cultural characteristics of the Woodland sites in the Middle Sabine River basin that contain
LMV ceramics would also be assessed. These characteristics included the site type, function, activity
areas, cultural features, artifact types and densities, and subsistence evidence.

Research Topic 4
What are the characteristics of the chipped stone tool assemblage at the Hawkwind site? Is the
assemblage similar to other Woodland period sites, and what do these tools tell us about the types of
activities that occurred there?
It was presumed that ascertaining the function(s) of the tools at the Hawkwind site could
contribute to our understanding of subsistence practices and activities performed there. Based on
the presence of numerous projectile points, it was obvious that hunting played an important role,
though it was less certain what the remainder of the chipped and ground stone tool assemblage
could reveal about the kinds of activities that occurred at the site. In order to address this topic, it
was proposed that use-wear analysis be performed on the complete nonprojectile point tools from
the site.
It has been noted by other researchers that one of the characteristics of the Woodland period in the
Sabine River valley is that the utilization of nonlocal lithic raw material is lower than at any other
time in the prehistoric occupation of the basin (Perttula et al. 1993:117). While a preliminary
examination of the chipped stone tool assemblage from the Hawkwind site seemingly supports this
observation), attributing all of these materials to the Woodland period was thought to be
problematical, as the stratigraphic context at the site had been severely impacted from
postdepositional disturbances.
Despite the perceived lack of stratigraphic integrity, it was believed that it might be possible to
address this topic by focusing on the single stone artifact type that, while temporally not entirely
limited to the Woodland period, can nonetheless be primarily associated with this period in
northeast Texas and surrounding areas: the Gary dart point (Perttula and Nelson 2004; Rogers et al.
2001; Story 1990). Gary points are also the most commonly occurring dart point at Woodland
period sites. At the Hawkwind site, for example, Gary points compose just over one-half of the dart
point assemblage, while at Resch they constituted 65 percent of the dart points, and at Herman
Ballew they accounted for 67 percent. At the Folly site, probably the only single-component
Woodland period site yet found in northeast Texas (Story 1990:279), Gary points account for five of
the six identifiable dart points, with the sixth being a Yarbrough point. It was proposed that the
Gary dart point assemblage from the Hawkwind site be compared with those of the Resch, Folly,
and Herman Ballew sites to determine whether the predominance of locally obtained materials in
the Hawkwind assemblage is typical of the period in the area.

Research Topic 5

What are the advantages and disadvantages of the unusual method of investigation employed at
Hawkwind? How do the results compare with a standard excavation of similar cost? Should the
method be used again in the future? If so, what improvements or changes should be made?

Atkins 100018032/120087

47

Hawkwind Site (41HS915)
Data recovery at the Hawkwind site primarily focused on mechanical excavation with a Gradall
excavator and a motorized mechanical screen. This method was designed to maximize artifact
return from the site. Although it was recognized that this strategy prevented collection of detailed
provenience information, the method was selected because previous work had established that
spatial and stratigraphic integrity was so compromised that detailed provenience was largely
irrelevant.

This research topic represents a post hoc evaluation of the method used at Hawkwind. It first
considers the assumptions used to justify the method in the first place, and evaluates whether they
were warranted. To do this, a reexamination was made of the site setting in the context of its
stratigraphy and sedimentology. As part of this examination, limited provenience data on
diagnostics and dated artifacts would be used to the extent that was feasible to further evaluate the
stratigraphic integrity of the assemblage.

Site data would be used to predict the size of the recovered collection if standard methods had been
used and the field budget had been comparable. This would be accomplished by arriving at an
estimated excavation volume using typical budgeting guidelines for data recovery projects, and
contrasting that volume with that achieved with the current method.

Finally, Atkins would provide a discussion of the potential of mechanical excavation and motorized
screening as an optional excavation method for other sites in the future. This discussion would also
include recommended changes and lessons learned.

FIELD METHODS

The Hawkwind site is located within existing FM 2625 ROW, in the Potters Creek and Potters Creek
Relief floodplain, in south central Harrison County. The locations of site 41HS915 and the proposed
highway improvements project are depicted on the attached portion of the 1983 U.S. Geological
Survey Darco [3294-133], Provisional Edition, 7.5-minute topographic quadrangle (see Figure 1).

The proposed highway project was to consist of widening the existing bridges and bridge
approaches, and the addition of paved shoulders at the approaches. The horizontal APE for these
improvements would have a total length of 1,410 ft (430 m), would be confined to the existing
145-ft (44-m)-wide highway ROW, and would encompass approximately 4.7 acres. The vertical APE
generally would be confined to 3 ft (90 cm) below modern surface levels, but the installation of
additional bridge support columns at the stream crossings would require boring up to at least 16 ft
(5 m) below the existing ground surface.
TxDOT ENV recommended data recovery operations be conducted on the portion of the site within
existing highway ROW to mitigate future construction impacts and to allow for a better-informed
NRHP eligibility recommendation. Atkins conducted data recovery operations at the site under
Texas Antiquities Permit No. 5356. The field effort included mechanical and manual unit excavation

48

4. Data Recovery: Research Topics,
Field Methods, and Laboratory Methods
within one excavation block located between the previously noted stream channels, south of the
FM 2625 fill section. The excavation block was located between trenches and test units excavated
during previous TxDOT field investigations (Abbott et al. 2009), and oriented such that its south
side abutted the existing tree line in this segment of highway ROW. The proposed block was 100 ft
(30 m) long (east-west) by 15 ft (4.5 m) wide, and included thirty 10-ft-long by 5-ft-wide units
arranged in three rows of 10 units each. Due to repeated heavy rains during September, six of the
planned units were not excavated (Figure 7).

Mechanical excavation was conducted with a Gradall equipped with a 60-inch-wide bucket, and fill
slated to be screened was passed through a mechanical screening device affixed to a Bobcat
(Figures 8 and 9). The industrial grade mesh on the mechanical screening device was set on a ¼inch grid. Mechanical excavation moved from west to east, beginning at the block’s southwest
corner (Unit 1) (see Figure 1). Excavation of each north-south-oriented column of three units was
completed prior to beginning the next column of units to the east (Figure 10).

While an initial attempt was made to excavate one unit at a time, it quickly became apparent that
this strategy needed to be changed because of considerable slumping derived from excavating
loosely consolidated sediments with the Gradall. The modified effort consisted of excavating one
level at a time across a north-south-aligned column of three units. Slumping still occurred using this
approach, but it was reduced to a level that could be better managed by a monitor in the excavation
block.
As per the stipulations provided in the Scope of Work, unit excavation initially was divided into
three broad levels. The first level included modern overburden or disturbed natural sediments to a
depth of 15 cmbs. The second level extended from 15 cmbs (or the base of modern overburden, if
deeper) to 60 cmbs, and the third level extended from 60 cmbs to a depth of 140 cmbs (if possible).
Seven units (1–6 and 9) were excavated in this manner.

TxDOT ENV archeologists Jim Abbott and Waldo Troell visited the site on August 25, 2009. In the
discussion of work up to that point, it was agreed to end unit excavation at 120 cmbs due to low
artifact returns below that level in the previously excavated units, and because the moisture
content of the last 20–30 cm of sediment in those units slowed the passage of sediment through the
mechanical screen. TxDOT archeologists also agreed to split Level 3 into Levels 3 (60–90 cmbs) and
4 (90–120 cmbs) in an effort to separate a zone of higher artifact densities (between 60 and
90 cmbs as noted in units 1–6) from lower artifact densities below 90 cmbs (Jim Abbott, personal
communication 2009). Thus, the 17 other units that were completed during the field effort were
excavated in four levels.

Figure 10. Looking west across the excavation block at the end of
the second 10-day field session. Part of the block’s west
end was previously backfilled.
Atkins archeologists completed 24 of the 30 units called for in the Scope before the field effort was
cut short due to repeated heavy rains (Figures 11–15). Eight of these units were excavated to
average depths that ranged from 130 to 159 cmbs, and 16 units were excavated to average depths
that ranged from 117 to 123 cmbs. The six unexcavated units (25–30) composed the last two northsouth unit columns at the east end of the 100-ft (30-m)-long excavation block. Thus, Atkins
archeologists completed about 80 ft (24 m) of the originally proposed 100-ft (30-m)-long
excavation block (see Figures 11 and 12). The excavation block was backfilled on October 12, 2009
(see Figures 13 and 15).

The Scope stipulated that sediment from 60 cmbs to the base of the excavation block be
mechanically screened in all of the block units. Level 2 sediments were to be screened in six of the
units in order to obtain a screened artifact sample from the base of disturbed sediment to the base
of the excavation block in 20 percent of the block. These six units were to be spaced on the block’s
margins, along the length of the excavation block.
During the field excavations, Level 2 sediments were screened in 4 of the 24 units completed during
the data recovery effort (Units 1, 7, 15, and 21). In the remaining 20 units, only sediments in Levels
3 and 4 were screened (from 60 cmbs to the base of the excavation block). In these units, Level 2
unscreened sediment was slowly dumped adjacent to the excavation block so that Atkins
archeologists could monitor the sediment for artifacts as it was deposited. In general, few artifacts
were collected from unscreened sediment.

Figure 15. Looking west during backfilling of the excavation block. The pile of
dirt in the foreground marks the location of the southeast corner of
block excavation (southeast corner of Unit 22).
Although the field effort was supposed to primarily consist of mechanical excavation and screening,
equipment malfunction and wet conditions prevented use of the Gradall or the Bobcat and
necessitated some manual excavation and screening. These efforts were limited to portions of Units
1, 5, and 6 and all of Unit 2 at the block’s west end, and Units 22–24 at the block’s east end. In
addition, a 1-x-1-x-0.5-m control unit was excavated within Level 3 of Unit 3 (see Figure 7).
Designated Unit 31, this unit was excavated in an effort to recover a better-controlled sample from
the artifact concentration noted in the same level in adjacent portions of the surrounding units (2,
5, and 6). Mechanical excavation of Unit 3, Level 3 was conducted after the completion of Unit 31.

Periodic heavy rainfall and surface runoff accelerated by surface grade north of the excavation
block caused undercutting of the block’s north wall and cut channels in unexcavated sediments in
block Units 7–9 and units 22–24 (see Figures 11 and 12). Sediment in the lower halves of these
units were mixed and dispersed into adjacent, completed units. Thus, cultural material collected
from these contexts in these units is likely mixed.

Approximately 139 m3 of fill was removed in the excavation block during data recovery operations
at site 41HS915. About 123 m3 of sediment was mechanically excavated, and 66 m3 of fill was
mechanically screened. Sixteen cubic meters of sediment was manually excavated, and 12.50 m3 of
sediment was screened by hand. These numbers are approximations based on a standard unit size
Atkins 100018032/120087

55

Hawkwind Site (41HS915)
of 3.05 m by 1.50 m, and the totals take into account the 30-cm (12-inch)-wide balk that was left at
the west end of Unit 1. However, it should be noted that the volume estimates are somewhat
smaller than the actual amount of fill that was removed from the 80-ft (24-m)-long block since the
Gradall operator consistently pulled northward while excavating along the block’s north edge. This
effort created an uneven north wall starting at the Unit 6/Unit 9 boundary, with the north sides of
Units 9, 12, 15, 21, and 24 oriented on various southwest to northeast alignments. By contrast, the
block’s south wall was relatively straight.
The Scope of Work allowed for 11 m3 of hand excavation. In this instance, the volumetric overages
for manually excavated and screened fill were incurred during the manual excavation of the lower
halves of Units 22–24. The decision was made to complete these three units by hand prior to halting
fieldwork since soil in the ROW was too wet to support the Gradall and too wet to pass efficiently
through the mechanical screen (Jim Abbott, personal communication 2009).

Concurrent with block excavation, Atkins archeologists excavated five 20-x-20-cm fine-screen
column samples off the edges of the larger block (see Figure 7). Column Samples 1–4 were
excavated off the walls of the four full-screen block units (1, 7, 15, and 21). Column Sample 5 was
excavated off the south wall of Unit 22, which was technically out of sequence from the Scope that
called for column samples to be excavated off the walls of full-screen block units. Column Sample 5
was placed south of Unit 22 because of the high concentration of carbon throughout the excavation
of this unit. For this reason, Atkins archeologists also felt this would also be an ideal location for a
flotation sample to be taken as well, but were unable to so at the time of the block excavation due to
poor weather and lack of time. All five column sample units were excavated in arbitrary 20-cm
levels from the base of overburden to the floor of the excavation block, and all sediment from these
units was hand-screened through ⅛-inch construction mesh. All artifacts and charcoal were
collected and inventoried, and no soil samples were collected from any of the five fine-screen
column samples.

Two 20-x-20-cm flotation sample columns were also taken off the edges of the larger block (see
Figure 7). Flotation Sample Column 1 was excavated immediately east of Column Sample 2 due to
the persistence of carbonized material throughout the sediment profile in that unit. On October 5,
2009, when TxDOT archeologist Waldo Troell visited the site to oversee backfilling of the
excavation block, he collected Flotation Sample Column 2 at the desired location in the south wall of
Unit 22 immediately east of Column Sample 5 utilizing the collection techniques from the first
sample. Both flotation sample columns were collected in arbitrary 20-cm levels from the base of
overburden to the floor of the excavation block. All fill from the flotation sample columns were
bagged and returned to the Atkins laboratory for processing.

A transit was used to establish comparable datum elevations relative to an arbitrary 100.00-m
elevation. Although infrequent, some of the artifacts, stains, and root casts exposed in the
excavation block were mapped and provenienced. Mapping was completed on a unit-by-unit basis,
Atkins 100018032/120087

56

4. Data Recovery: Research Topics,
Field Methods, and Laboratory Methods
and individual unit maps were used to generate a plan of the entire excavation block. The south
wall of the excavation block was cleaned and photographed by unit, and a continuous profile of the
block’s south wall was created from several smaller profiles. Five optically stimulated luminescence
(OSL) samples were extracted from the block’s south wall for chronometric dating. Three of the
samples were removed from C horizon sediments at the base of the profile, and two were removed
from overlying Bw horizon sediments. These samples were collected at the east and west ends of
the block, and the sample locations were recorded on the south wall profile.

Atkins archeologists collected 3,768 artifacts during the data recovery effort at site 41HS915 (see
Appendix I). The artifacts consist of 3,253 lithic debitage and other nontool chipped stone artifacts
(hereafter referred to as lithic debitage), 184 lithic chipped stone tools, 157 prehistoric ceramic
sherds, 41 ground stone items, 63 faunal bone fragments, 7 burned clay pieces, 61 ochre pieces, and
2 raw clay samples.

A look at the artifact assemblage indicates that 86.3 percent of the collection consisted of lithic
debitage. Chipped stone tools composed 4.9 percent of the assemblage, and prehistoric ceramics
accounted for 4.2 percent. Ground stone artifacts, faunal bone, and ochre represented minor
percentages of the total artifact count (1.9 percent, 1.7 percent, and 1.6 percent, respectively). Total
artifact returns per cubic meter for all of the block’s excavated and screened sediment are
presented on the first row of Table 5.

Review of the total artifact counts by unit revealed two high to moderately high density artifact
concentrations in the excavation block. The first was centered on Units 4–6 near the block’s west
end (see Figure 7). When Unit 31 is combined with Unit 3, then Units 2–6 each had total artifact
counts of 139 or greater and 116 artifacts were collected in Unit 8. A total of 147 artifacts were
retrieved from Unit 7, but 31 percent of that count was collected in Level 2, which was mechanically
screened. Level 2 sediments were not screened in Units 2–6 and Unit 8, and only about 2 percent of
the artifacts collected in these units were derived from Level 2.

The second artifact concentration was located in the east half of the excavation block and included
Units 12–24. Artifact counts in 8 of the 13 units in this area totaled 176 or higher, but the counts for
all of the excavation units totaled over 100. The fact that Level 2 sediments were screened in Units
15 and 21 elevated the total artifact counts in these units relative to the 11 other units in this group.
Among the block of five units consisting of Units 19, 20, and 22–24, Units 22 and 23 exhibited the
highest artifact counts ranging from 176 to 237, almost entirely excavated below 60 cmbs. Of note,
when the Level 2 artifact totals are deducted from the Units 15 and 21 assemblages, these units still
have respective counts of 104 and 150.
High counts of lithic debitage corresponded well with the general boundaries of the two artifact
concentrations, which is not surprising since this artifact group composes just over 90 percent of
the recovered artifact assemblage. The highest concentrations of chipped stone tools were found in

Field Methods, and Laboratory Methods
Units 19–22 in the east artifact concentration (where tool counts ranged from 9 to 15 in each unit),
and in Units 4–7 in the west artifact concentration (where tool counts ranged from 12 to 16
artifacts per unit). Three of the 18 tools recovered in Unit 7 and 7 of the 11 tools recovered in Unit
21 were collected from screened Level 2 sediment. Another chipped stone tool (a Friley arrow
point) was recovered in the first level below overburden in Column Sample 2, and a modified flake
and scraper were recovered from Flotation Sample Column 1, both of which were excavated off the
south wall of Unit 7. While the highest chipped stone tool counts were located within the east and
west artifact concentrations, this artifact class was well-represented across the excavation block.
Sixteen of the block’s 24 units contained at least 5 chipped stone tools, and the remaining units
contained at least 2 to 4 such artifacts.
The largest prehistoric ceramic sherd counts were located in Units 13 and 19 in the east artifact
concentration (n = 19 and 8, respectively) and in Units 4, 5, 7, and 8 in the west artifact
concentration (these units contained 12 to 15 sherds each). In addition, Units 2, 3/31, 6, and 9
contained 5 to 10 sherds each. Two of the 12 sherds recovered from Unit 7 were retrieved from
screened Level 2 sediment in that unit. The distribution of high-number sherd counts at the west
end of the excavation block corresponded relatively well with the limits of the west artifact
concentration. Units 13 and 19 were located within the east artifact concentration, together with
Units 14, 15, and 20–22, which contained 5 to 7 sherds each. Sixteen of the block’s 24 units
contained at least five prehistoric sherds. Units 10, 16, and 18 were the only block units where
ceramics were not recovered.

The small size of the ground stone assemblage does not lend itself particularly well to the
identification of artifact concentrations, but Units 1, 4, 5, 6, 7, 10, 11, 14, 15, and 18 did have ground
stone artifact counts of 2 to 4 each. Thirty of the 41 ground stone artifacts collected in the
excavation block were recovered from its west half, with the highest per unit counts located in or
on the edges of the west artifact concentration. Units 14 and 15 in the east artifact concentration
contained 3 and 4 ground stone artifacts, respectively. Individual ground stone artifacts also were
recovered in Units 2, 3, 12, 17, and 24, and a large anvil stone weighing 580 g was recovered from
Level 1 of Column Sample 4.

Sixty-five fragments of faunal bone were recovered from the excavation block, with 42 fragments
recovered from the block’s east half in Units 17–19 and 21–24. In the east half of the block, the
highest per unit counts were recovered in Units 18, 20, and 22 (n = 9, 9, and 7, respectively).
Between 3 and 5 fragments were recovered from each of Units 17, 19, 21, 23, and 24. In the west
half of the block, Units 4 and 11 yielded the highest per unit counts with 10 and 8 fragments,
respectively, while Units 7, 8, and 12 each yielded one bone fragment and Unit 6 yielded two
fragments. Units 8, 11, and 12 were located between the densest artifact concentrations at the east
and west ends of the excavation block.

Hawkwind Site (41HS915)
A total of 81.72 kilograms (kg) (n = 989) of thermally altered rocks (TAR) were recorded in the
field, but were not collected. High counts of TAR corresponded with the previously noted artifact
concentrations, with the highest counts appearing in Units 3/31 (units combined), 4, 7, and 19–21.
Again, total counts in Units 7 and 21 are elevated by the fact that Level 2 sediment was screened in
each of these units. Unit 20 had the highest TAR count encountered in the excavation block
(n = 138), and 75 percent of this material was recovered in Level 3 (61–91 cmbs). During the
mechanical scrape of Unit 20, several fragments of TAR, a piece of hematite, a prehistoric sherd, and
several flakes were observed together in a roughly 80-cm-diameter area in the lower half of Level 3
(see Figure 7). While no indication of a feature was evident during the scrape, the loose association
of this material coupled with the large number of thermally altered rock fragments recovered from
Unit 20 in general (and Level 3 in particular) suggests that a thermal feature might have been
located in this unit. This was the best evidence of a possible cultural feature identified in the
excavation block during the data recovery effort.

Lithic debitage was relatively common in all units. The highest counts were located in Units 4–6 in
the west side of the block and in Units 19, 20, and 22–24 in the east side of the block. Both unit
groups are located within the previously noted artifact concentrations.

Level 2 sediment was mechanically screened in Units 1, 7, 15, and 21, and the total Level 2 artifact
counts from these units appears to be correlated in part with level thickness (as determined by
overburden depth relative to the modern surface and the 60-cmbs arbitrary depth used as the base
of Level 2). Not surprisingly, artifact counts in most of these units were much higher than the total
artifact counts in those units where Level 2 sediment was only subjected to grab sampling.
However, the total artifact count from Unit 1, Level 2 (n = 6) is on par with some of the higher Level
2 grab sample totals in the rest of the excavation block. In this instance, the small artifact return is
likely derived from overburden depth that reduced the thickness of the level to 20 cm, and from
lower than average artifact densities in this unit relative to the rest of the block. In addition, the
30-cm-wide balk left at the west end of this unit might have affected the total artifact return in
Unit 1.
A total of 250 artifacts were recovered from Level 2 in the four units in which this level was
mechanically screened. Combined cubic meters of excavated and screened sediment, artifact
counts, and artifact counts per cubic meter for this context are presented in Table 5. Grab sample
totals ranged from 1 to 8 artifacts per unit. No artifacts were collected in Level 2 in Units 18–20.

Comparison of level-specific artifact totals in the 17 block units where the lower half of the soil
profile was split into Levels 3 (average 60–90 cmbs) and 4 (average 90–120 cmbs) revealed that,
with the exception of ground stone, the majority of the artifacts and unmodified lithic material
collected from these levels were recovered from approximately 60–90 cmbs (see Table 5).
Collectively, sherd counts per cubic meter dropped by 72 percent between Levels 3 and 4 in these
units, and the per cubic meter counts of lithic debitage and chipped stone tools decreased by about
Atkins 100018032/120087

60

4. Data Recovery: Research Topics,
Field Methods, and Laboratory Methods
54 and 37 percent, respectively. Likewise, the counts for thermally altered rock dropped by
approximately 25 percent in these units. While the decrease in frequency of smaller, lighter items,
such as lithic debitage, over increased depth is expected, the decrease in frequency of heavier items
over increased depth (while relatively small for some artifact and item classes) is inconsistent with
the concentration of heavier items deeper in the sediment profile as forecast by Abbott et al.
(2009). In the case of the thermally altered rock, however, the large amount of this material
encountered in Unit 20, Level 3 might have biased a vertical gradation more typical of previous
expectations. The frequency of ground stone per cubic meter increased by 23 percent between
Levels 3 and 4 in these units, which is consistent with earlier predictions about artifact movement
in sandy deposits. However, it should be noted that more ground stone artifacts (11 total) were
recovered above 60 cmbs (6 of these from only three units) as were found from 90 to 120 cmbs in
17 units (9 total). In addition, the per cubic meter count for ground stone in screened Level 2
sediment was 54 and 39 percent higher than per cubic meter counts for ground stone from Level 3
(60–90 cmbs) and Level 4 (90–120 cmbs) contexts, respectively. Counts by cubic meter for all other
artifact classes in units where Level 2 was mechanically screened were lower than those in Level 3
in the 17 noted units. While Units 1–6 and 9 were only excavated in three levels, field observations
strongly suggest that the concentration of artifacts in Level 3 and the subsequent drop in artifact
densities (between Levels 3 and 4) that was demonstrated in 71 percent of the block’s units held
true across the excavation block.
Lithic debitage constituted 90 percent of the material collected in the five fine-screen column
samples excavated on the block’s margins (see Appendix I). A Friley arrow point was collected in
the first level of Column Sample 2. One sherdlet and a pitted anvil stone were collected from
Column Sample 4, while Column Sample 5 yielded three sherdlets. A total of nine carbon samples
were collected in Column Samples 2 and 5. Flotation Sample Column 1 was excavated immediately
east of Column Sample 2, and Flotation Sample Column 2 was excavated immediately east of
Column Sample 5 in an effort to collect samples of the carbonized material identified in those units.

Figure 16 presents profiles of the five column and two flotation sample columns excavated in
arbitrary 20-cm levels from the base of overburden to the floor of the excavation block (see Figure
7). The profiles reflect the undulating nature of the site’s sediments, and the numbers of artifacts
recovered from each 20-cm level. The presence of the Friley arrow point, which dates between
A.D. 700 and 1100, in Level 1 of Column Sample 2 seems to be stratigraphically in place. More
interesting are the radiocarbon dates obtained from charred nutshells recovered from Column
Samples 1 and 2 and Flotation Samples 1 and 2. While there is some elevational variation from one
sample to another, the dated materials within each column are stratigraphically in order. This
suggests that at least portions of the site were still relatively intact.
In summary, data recovery investigations conducted at 41HS915 succeeded in excavating
80 percent of the originally proposed 100-ft (30-m)-long by 15-ft (4.5-m)-wide excavation block.

4. Data Recovery: Research Topics,
Field Methods, and Laboratory Methods
Approximately 139 m3 of sediment was mechanically and manually removed from the block during
this effort, and 56 percent of this sediment was screened through ¼-inch construction mesh. In
addition, Atkins archeologists excavated five 20-x-20-cm column samples on the block’s margins,
screening the fill of each through ⅛-inch construction mesh. The sediment in two flotation sample
columns was collected and returned to the Atkins Archeology Laboratory for processing. These
efforts recovered 3,768 artifacts. In addition, approximately 81.72 kg of TAR were weighed and
counted in the field. No discrete features were identified during block unit excavation, but elevated
counts of TAR in Unit 20 and a loosely associated concentration of rocks and artifacts in this unit
are suggestive of a dispersed thermal feature (see Figure 7).

Review of unit-specific artifact assemblages revealed two spatially distinct artifact concentrations
within the excavation block. The smaller of the two is centered near the block’s west end. The
second artifact concentration encompasses most of the east half of the block. In addition to the
material noted above, Atkins archeologists recovered prehistoric ceramic sherds, chipped stone
tools, ground stone tools, lithic debitage, and small fragments of burned or calcined bone.

Stratigraphically, artifact counts and counts of unmodified stone per cubic meter were highest in
the lowest 30–40 cm of the Bw soil horizon, which is consistent with the movement of heavier
items downward in the sediment profile as discussed by Abbott et al. (2009). Except for ground
stone, artifact counts per cubic meter dropped below the approximate level of the Bw-C horizon
transition. Ground stone artifact densities increased between Level 3 and Level 4 by just over
50 percent in the 17 block units where the lower half of the block was divided into Levels 3 and 4
(which loosely correspond with the Bw-C transition). However, ground stone artifact densities per
cubic meter were in fact higher in those screened Level 2 sediments than they were in Levels 3 or 4
in the 17 noted block units. The presence of higher than anticipated numbers of ground stone
artifacts in the screened Level 2 sediments and the presence of the large pitted anvil stone in Level
1 of Column Sample 4 could indicate less artifactual sorting than anticipated. Based on field
observations, the stratigraphic distribution of artifacts demonstrated in 71 percent of the block’s
units was likely replicated in the seven units where the lower half of the block was excavated as one
level (Units 1–6 and 9).

ARTIFACT PROCESSING, ANALYTICAL TECHNIQUES, AND CURATION

Upon arrival at the Atkins Archeological Laboratory, all recovered cultural remains were sorted,
labeled, and catalogued by provenience. During processing, inorganic remains were washed in
distilled water. Organic faunal remains were dry-brushed.
Charred botanical specimens recovered in the excavation screens were collected in foil pouches for
potential radiocarbon dating and species identification. Samples were inventoried and weighed in
the Atkins Laboratory. Selected samples were submitted to Dr. Leslie Bush at Macrobotanical
Analysis of Manchaca, Texas, for species identification.
Atkins 100018032/120087

63

Hawkwind Site (41HS915)
Flotation samples were collected from nonfeature contexts. Samples were catalogued then
processed in the Atkins Laboratory using a Flote-Tech flotation device in order to retrieve organic
remains and artifacts smaller than 1/16th-inch in size. Samples of both heavy and light fraction
organic remains were bagged and sent to Dr. Leslie Bush at Macrobotanical Analysis for
macrobotanical analysis.
All analyses of recovered artifacts were performed by qualified Atkins analysts according to the
project treatment plan. Methods employed for each artifact category are detailed in Chapters 5 and
6. Methods for the special studies appear in the relevant appendices. The specimen inventory
appears in Appendix I.

Analytical Techniques
Ceramic Analysis

Studies of prehistoric ceramic assemblages provide valuable information about Native American
cultural adaptations and offer a means of addressing chronology and cultural-temporal
frameworks. To speak to this broad range of issues, an analysis must be comprehensive enough to
capture the array of stylistic and technological diversity found on any one group of ceramics. When
whole vessels or sherds large enough to exhibit overall design motifs are present in the assemblage,
typological classifications are possible. In the absence of whole vessels or vessel sections large
enough to discern typologically distinct decorative motifs, one way to distinguish subtle differences
between relatively similar ceramics is to look at the technological variations found on individual
sherds (see Brown 1998; Lechtman 1977; Livingood 2007; van der Leeuw 1984). Research
indicates that for prehistoric potters, variations in key technological attributes such as temper,
surface treatment, and thickness bear a direct relationship to the desired use of the pot (see
Bronitsky 1986; Perttula 2000, 2004, 2009a, 2009b; Rogers and Perttula 2004; Schiffer and Skibo
1987). Thus, sherds recovered from each site were characterized according to a suite of key
technological and stylistic attributes. Each of these attributes provides information about the
abstract (i.e., the technical knowledge) and the concrete (i.e., the raw materials) components of the
pottery-making process, which in turn tells us something about the different choices made at
various stages in that process. These differences, in turn, provide a basis for comparing the
technological and stylistic variability of specific ceramic assemblages to the technological and
stylistic variability found in other ceramic assemblages.
Sherds from the site were characterized according to a suite of key technological and stylistic
attributes. The attributes recorded for each sherd in the analyzed sample followed established
TxDOT ceramic protocols and include (1) paste category (i.e., paste constituency and paste texture),
(2) basic exterior and interior surface treatment, (3) exterior and interior decorative treatment, (4)
forming attributes (including morphological class [i.e., body, base, or rim], diameter, and average
thickness), and (5) firing environment (i.e., oxidizing or nonoxidizing). This information enabled
Atkins 100018032/120087

64

4. Data Recovery: Research Topics,
Field Methods, and Laboratory Methods
finer-grained typological and technological distinctions, which in turn allowed the analyst to more
fully characterize the assemblage even in the absence of whole pots and identifiable types, thereby
providing a basis for placing the ceramics within a broader regional ceramic context.

Because many paste and surface treatment attributes can be ambiguous when observed under lowpower binocular magnification, petrographic analyses and INAA were also performed. These
studies provided valuable information about the intra- and intersite spatial patterning of the
ceramics recovered at 41HS915 relative to other ceramic assemblages in the region.

Ceramic Petrography

Ceramic petrography is a replicable, quantifiable approach for identifying ceramic paste
composition, and involves the method of point counting and grain-size measurements from ceramic
thin sections. The analysis is designed to count 200 points, a number determined to statistically
represent all elements present in a sample. Grain size is determined by measuring a number of
nonplastic inclusions at their maximum width. General grain-size characteristics are identified
based upon the range, mode, and mean of each sample in relationship to the Wentworth Size Scale.
The general shape of the inclusions in the samples is based upon categories of roundness and
sphericity presented in Folk (1980). Pore space and surface treatment are additional ceramic
characteristics that can be used to study differences in clay resource procurement and
manufacturing.

Characteristics of sherds from the Hawkwind site such as grain size and abundance, pore space,
surface treatment, and cultural inclusions were used in a comparative approach in an attempt to
recognize intersite and regional patterns in ceramic production. Because clays are particulate
sediments, they are highly variable from deposit to deposit in their chemical and mineralogical
constituents. This variability is heightened by the introduction of natural variables (weathering,
redeposition, etc.), as well as those introduced during the manufacturing process (Rice 1987:418–
419). While these variables represent confounding factors in provenience studies, the procedures
used in petrographic analyses allow reliable statistical comparisons by taking into account aspects
of manufacturing behavior such as paste texture, particle size, and orientation, as well as suggesting
the mineral basis for the chemical constituents. Because local and nonlocal groups are
distinguished largely by color, isotropy (a general optical property of most minerals), paste density,
voids, and the presence or absence of clay-resident silt-sized particles, these attributes provide
direct indicators of the original clay minerals.

To date, the ceramic assemblage from Herman Ballew is the only other Woodland period site in the
Middle Sabine basin for which ceramic petrography has been performed. During the current study,
ceramic petrography was conducted on sherds from two other Woodland sites, Resch and Folly, to
help establish a regional pattern for the Middle Sabine basin (Appendix C).

Instrumental Neutron Activation Analysis
INAA is an analytical technique useful for performing both qualitative and quantitative analysis of
major, minor, and trace elements in archeological samples. Samples are irradiated with thermal
neutrons in a nuclear reactor. Neutrons are absorbed in the nuclei of constituent atoms, and these
atoms emit radiation with energy and quantity unique to each particular element. Analysis of the
spectrum of gamma rays emitted by the sample allows a determination of the elemental
composition of the sample.
INAA can be used to characterize the elemental composition of prehistoric ceramic pastes and draw
conclusions regarding intensity and location of resource procurement and production loci and
spheres of trade and regional exchange. The Archaeometry Laboratory at the University of Missouri
Research Reactor (MURR), Columbia, Missouri, performed this analytical technique.

A total of 20 sherds from the Hawkwind site were submitted for INAA. In addition, 39 sherds from
the Resch and Folly sites were also analyzed in an attempt to establish a regional pattern for
Woodland period ceramics in the Middle Sabine basin (Appendix C).

Lithic and Microwear Analysis

The Lithic Analysis Protocol developed by TxDOT is referenced and incorporated into the analysis
of the stone tools from 41HS915.

Analysis of the stone artifacts recovered from the data recovery at 41HS915 followed a two-step
process of compilation. The lithic artifacts were initially divided into tool and nontool categories,
with the former containing both chipped stone tools and ground stone tools, and the latter
containing all forms of lithic manufacturing debris.

The stone tools were categorized as either chipped stone or ground stone. Each tool was further
categorized by raw material, tool type, form, and the presence or absence of thermal alteration.
Metric measurements, use-wear identification, and any additional tool-specific attributes were
recorded. Selected stone tools were examined under high-power microscopy to identify use-wear.
Microscopic examination of the complete formal tools from the site was done in order to identify
the key mechanical processes and the subsequent wear patterns still visible on the tool. Because
any specific tool can be used in a range of activities, multifunctional tools were categorized on the
basis of the predominant type of wear still visible on the tool. Marilyn Shoberg at The University of
Texas performed the microwear analysis (Appendix D).

Ground and battered stone tools are generalized tools in the sense that a single tool may not be
functionally specific with regard to the manner in which it is used or the things it is used to process
or prepare (Adams 1988, 1996; Barr 1960; Kraybill 1977). To systematically classify these tools, it
is important to use well-defined criteria for recognizing their diverse nature and possible function.
Atkins 100018032/120087

66

4. Data Recovery: Research Topics,
Field Methods, and Laboratory Methods
Since a variety of processes can produce distinctive wear, tools were assigned to specific analytical
categories on the basis of several key variables: the mechanical processes, the outcome of those
processes, and the material being processed.

Nontool artifacts consist of unmodified lithic debitage and cores. The detailed analysis of this
material was restricted to complete flakes and consisted of noting the raw material from which
each flake is derived. By limiting the analysis to complete flakes rather than including flake
fragments and shatter, a considerable amount of time and effort was saved while still conveying the
basic data present in the debitage. Identification of the raw material addresses the research topic
concerned with the apparent lack of nonlocal raw material in Woodland lithic assemblages in the
Middle Sabine River valley. Determining local vs. imported raw material can be somewhat
subjective, in that most local materials are likely derived from lag gravel deposits, which can
contain rock types from multiple sources. However, these deposits typically contain various shades
of brown, tan, and gray cherts and fine-grained quartzite.

Residue Analysis

Gas chromatography and gas chromatography/mass spectrometry analysis of the compositions of a
residue extracted from the hafting area of a biface was performed. The study also included analysis
of an asphaltum reference material. Residue identifications were based on fatty acid decomposition
patterns of experimental residues, lipid distribution patterns, and the presence of biomarkers. The
analyses were performed by M.E. Malainey, Ph.D. and Timothy Figol at Brandon University
(Appendix F).

Faunal Analysis

Although relatively few specimens of animal bone were recovered from the Hawkwind site, the
analysis provided taxonomic identification of all faunal remains to the species level, or the most
specific taxon possible, based on limitations of specimen completeness. Minimum number of
individuals (MNI) of all species were identified when possible. Other attributes of the bone
assemblage such as age distribution of species, observed pathology, differential preservation of
various skeletal parts, taphonomy, or butchering evidence were tabulated when possible
(Appendix B).

Macrobotanical Analysis

Macrobotanical samples retrieved from the data recovery excavations and from flotation were
examined. However, because of the amount of mixing at the site, the analysis was restricted to a
scan of all samples for the presence of cultigens, and a taxonomic identification of all botanical
carbon samples (from nonceramic contexts) that were submitted for radiocarbon dating. Leslie L.
Bush, Ph.D. with Macrobotanical Analysis in Manchaca, Texas performed the analysis (Appendix A).

Radiocarbon Dating
A relatively robust radiocarbon dating effort was performed as part of the Hawkwind site analysis.
All material was dated using accelerator mass spectrometry and included 16 samples (Appendix G).
One date was obtained from carbonized material found adhering to one of the thermally altered
rocks. Five of the dates were obtained from ceramic sherds and included dates on the charred
residue adhering to four of the sherds and the dating of the bulk organics found in another sherd. (A
sixth sherd was submitted to Beta Analytic; however, the amount of residue obtained from the
sherd was not sufficient to obtain a date.) The 10 remaining dates were obtained from charred
organic material.

Curation

All cultural materials recovered at the Hawkwind site (41HS915) including lithic materials,
prehistoric ceramic objects, burned clay, faunal, charcoal samples (excluding those submitted for
radiocarbon dating), ochre, unprocessed OSL samples, and TAR are curated at Texas State
University in San Marcos, Texas. Any INAA residue and all petrographic thins sections from the
Folly (41RK26) and the Resch (41HS16) site ceramic samples were returned to TARL.

WOODLAND PERIOD CERAMICS
by Linda W. Ellis

Woodland period developments depict both a general cultural pattern and a regional cultural
tradition that began as a developmental stage and is now used as a major time period that
manifests somewhat differently from region to region (Black and Story 2003). Sometime between
1000 and 400 B.C., the use of pottery spread across the Eastern Woodlands and was accompanied
by increasingly settled villages and a suite of new cultural patterns whose specific nature and
timing varied considerably across the Southeast. Along the southwestern edge of the Eastern
Woodlands lay the east Texas cultural frontier that eventually became home to the Caddo.

The chronology of Woodland period ceramics in east Texas is poorly known except by general
comparison to the LMV sequence. Somewhat clearer is the geographical distribution of some of the
major Woodland cultural patterns in east Texas. Three Woodland cultures, whose boundaries
partially overlap, have been identified (see Figure 6). The most distinctive of these are the Fourche
Maline cultural tradition that encompasses portions of southwestern Arkansas and adjacent areas
of Oklahoma, Louisiana, and Texas (Schambach 1998, 2001) and the Mossy Grove cultural tradition
that covers an area extending from southwestern Louisiana, southeastward along the upper Texas
Gulf coast, and inland into the southern part of the Texas Piney Woods (Aten 1983; Aten and Bollich
2011; Story 1990). Between these two more-well-defined cultural traditions lies what Perttula
(2001; see also Perttula and Nelson 2004) has termed the Mill Creek culture, an area centered in
east Texas to the west and south of the Red River and its tributary, the Sulphur River. Our
knowledge of Mill Creek ceramics comes primarily from sites located in the Big Cypress and Sabine
River basins and the upper portion of the Angelina River basin in east Texas (Perttula and Nelson
2004; Rogers et al. 2001’ Webb et al. 1969).

The Mill Creek culture appears to be temporally contemporaneous with both the Fourche Maline
and Mossy Grove cultures, dating from around 500 B.C. to A.D. 800 (Schambach 2002; Perttula, ed.
2008; Rogers et al. 2001); however, there are certain key differences. The Fourche Maline culture
had a well-developed ceramic tradition known for its plain and minimally decorated vessels, with
the most common form being flat-bottomed jars often shaped like flowerpots. Ceramics typically
are thick walled and tempered with a variety of materials including clay/grog, bone, and/or sand.
The most common pottery type is Williams Plain, followed by Cooper Boneware and Ouachita Plain
(Schambach 1998, 2002). While Marksville and Coles Creek pottery are also found at Fourche
Maline sites, many of the ceramics appear to be locally made variants of these LMV pottery types
Atkins 100018032/120087

Hawkwind Site (41HS915)
that may or may not be temporally contemporaneous with these types as they were defined in the
LMV.

Most characteristic of the Mossy Grove culture is its sandy paste ceramic tradition. In contrast to
the thick-walled, flat-bottomed Fourche Maline wares, Mossy Grove ceramics are typically thinner
and more often decorated with narrow incised lines and punctations. Mossy Grove ceramic
assemblages are dominated by sandy paste wares with thin walls, floated surfaces, and rounded or
conical-shaped bases. Bone- and/or grog-tempered wares do not appear until late in the Mossy
Grove ceramic sequence (ca. A.D. 800–1000) (Aten 1983; Aten and Bollich 2011; Moore 1995; Story
1990).

The earliest pottery in the Mill Creek culture area dates to around 500 B.C., but at Mill Creek sites,
ceramic assemblages are quite small when compared to Fourche Maline or Mossy Grove sites
(Perttula and Nelson 2004; Rogers et al. 2001). They are also more technologically variable,
exhibiting a mix of plain sandy paste wares, bone-tempered wares, and thinner grog-tempered
wares. Since thinner grog-tempered wares occur early in the Mill Creek culture area, they are more
likely to be related to LMV wares than to the later-occurring grog-tempered Mossy Grove ceramics.
There is also a high representation of ceramics with laminated and contorted paste textures,
reminiscent of LMV Tchefuncte and Marksville wares that date to between ca. 800 B.C. and A.D. 200
(Girard 1995; Hays and Weinstein 2010; Story 1990). The relatively thick bone-tempered sherds
found at several Mill Creek sites may be related to the Fourche Maline type Cooper Boneware
(Schambach 1998, 2002). Similarly, the sandy paste wares with smoothed surface treatments may
be analogous to the Ouachita Ironware type (Schambach 1998, 2002). While bone-tempered
ceramics do not appear until late in the sequence in the Mossy Grove culture area (post–A.D. 900 in
the Conroe-Livingston area), the presence of sandy paste ceramics exhibiting floated surface
treatments would more comfortably fit with the Goose Creek sandy paste tradition of the Mossy
Grove area (Ellis 1992, 1995; Winchell and Ellis 1991). In fact, the cultural remains recovered from
sites in the upper Neches-Angelina area, the northernmost extension of the Mossy Grove culture
area, show a clear affinity with Mossy Grove material in the Conroe-Livingston Reservoir area,
where sandy paste ceramics with floated surfaces are quite common (McClurkan 1968; Shafer
1968). One of the main differences between ceramic-bearing assemblages at sites in this part of the
Mossy Grove cultural area and ceramic assemblages in Middle Sabine River basin sites such as Folly
(Jarvis 1972), Resch (Webb et al. 1969), Herman Ballew (Perttula 2001), and Hawkwind are the
presence of large quantities of bone-and-grog-tempered ceramics that suggest closer ties to the
LMV (Story 1990:279). Distinguishing which ceramic tradition specific Mill Creek assemblages are
more temporally or spatially affiliated with will require more systematic comparative analyses of
collections that focus on technological attributes such as rim and base characteristics, paste
constituency, paste texture, thickness, and surface treatment modes.
The same holds true for the locally made variants of the Tchefuncte-like pottery recovered at Mill
Creek sites (Perttula 2001; Webb et al. 1969:33–35, and Figure 9). In the LMV, this highly

Atkins 100018032/120087

70

5. Woodland Period Ceramics
distinctive pottery type is defined on the basis of its relatively soft, clay-tempered paste (Ford and
Quimby 1945; Phillips 1970; see also Gertjejansen and Shenkel 1983). While the type descriptions
of this early ware consider these angular clay particles to be “temper,” Weaver (1963) questions
whether the clay lumps represent intentional inclusions in the paste or whether they result from
carelessness in grinding and sifting the clay during primary forming. (This assumption is
investigated more fully in later discussions pertaining to the INAA analysis of a raw clay sample
found in the Resch collection housed at TARL; see also Appendix C.) The ware’s loosely
consolidated and distinctive laminated or contorted appearance in cross section tends to support
this supposition; however, the clay lumps often differ in color and texture from the surrounding
paste matrix, which seems to denote some intentional mixing of clays (this tempered vs.
untempered dilemma is discussed in more detail below). Tchefuncte sherds tend to be very light
weight due to the large voids in the paste. Usually poorly fired, pastes sometimes contain small
amounts of fine sand, bits of carbonized vegetal material, and/or crushed hematite. Exterior
surfaces are usually floated and often decorated with stamped designs, incised lines, and/or
punctations. The most common vessel forms are simple globular jars. Also common are “teatshaped” or “wedge-shaped” basal supports, often occurring in sets of four.

Although what appear to be Tchfuncte-like ceramics are found in Mill Creek assemblages, these
distinctive ceramics also occur frequently in Mossy Grove assemblages (Aten 1983; Aten and
Bollich 2011; Story 1990). In both areas, however, the technological attributes of these locally made
variants only loosely fit the standard type description of LMV Tchefuncte and date later in time
(circa 3000 B.C.–A.D. 100) (Aten 1983; Aten and Bollich 2011; Ellis and Ensor 1998; Perttula 2001;
Phillips 1970; Webb et al. 1969; Winchell and Ellis 1991). Their contorted or laminated pastes are
the defining characteristics; however, their paste fabrics often contain higher proportions of sand
inclusions. By contrast, Tchefuncte vessels manufactured in the LMV have less sand, and the base
and rim forms differ (Aten and Bollich 2011; Ellis and Ensor 1998; Winchell and Ellis 1991). This
begs the question as to whether using the type name “Tchefuncte” to classify similar-looking
ceramics found in east and southeastern Texas only confuses the issue.

Thus, while the Mill Creek ceramics share some elements of both the Fourche Maline and Mossy
Grove ceramic traditions, Mill Creek ceramic assemblages also show conspicuous variations. It has
been argued that these and other site differences suggest that a distinct cultural pattern existed in
the western frontier of the Eastern Woodlands in the Pineywoods of East Texas and the Post Oak
Savanna (Perttula and Nelson 2004). Sorting out the spatial and temporal implications of these
cultural patterns will take consistent and detailed analyses of key technological ceramic attributes
from more Woodland ceramic-bearing sites.

HAWKWIND CERAMIC RESEARCH OBJECTIVES

The Hawkwind site lies within the Mill Creek cultural area (see Figure 6). Research at this site
provides an opportunity to expand our knowledge of Woodland period occupations that occurred
Atkins 100018032/120087

71

Hawkwind Site (41HS915)
in the Sabine River, Big Cypress Creek, and upper Angelina River basin between ca. 2,500 and 1,200
years ago (see Perttula and Nelson 2004). One of the primary research objectives in reporting on
the excavations at the Hawkwind site is to assess how the ceramics from this Middle Sabine River
basin site compares to other Woodland period ceramic assemblages in the Middle Sabine River
basin, as well as other Woodland sites in east Texas and adjacent parts of Louisiana, Arkansas, and
Oklahoma (Rogers 2011:Figure 2). To date, Woodland period ceramics are best identified at the
Herman Ballew site (Rogers et al. 2001), but other important Texas ceramic-bearing Woodland
sites include the Folly (Jarvis 1972), Resch (Webb et al. 1969), and Broadway (Perttula and Nelson
2004) sites. The Hawkwind site’s ceramic assemblage provides valuable comparative data to these
studies. In particular, the site’s relatively close proximity to three of the major Middle Sabine River
basin sites provides an excellent opportunity to compare the ceramic assemblages at these four
sites in particular.

Ceramic Methods

To speak to this broad range of issues, an analysis must be comprehensive enough to capture the
array of stylistic and technological diversity found on any one group of ceramics. In Woodland
assemblages where plain wares predominate and in the absence of whole vessels or vessel sections
large enough to discern typologically distinct decorative motifs, one way to distinguish subtle
differences between relatively similar ceramics is to look at the technological variations found on
individual sherds (see Lechtman 1977; Livingood 2007; van der Leeuw 1984). Research indicates
that for prehistoric potters, variations in key technological attributes such as temper, surface
treatment, and thickness bear a direct relationship to the desired use of the pot (see Bronitsky
1986; Perttula 2000, 2009a, 2009b; Rice 1987; Winchell and Ellis 1991). Thus, the ceramics in this
study were characterized according to a suite of key technological and, when possible, stylistic
attributes. Each of these attributes provides information about the abstract (i.e., the technical
knowledge) and the concrete (i.e., the raw materials) components of the pottery-making process,
which in turn tells us something about the different choices made at various stages in that process.
These differences, in turn, provide a basis for comparing the technological and stylistic variability of
specific ceramic assemblages to the technological and stylistic variability found in other ceramic
assemblages.
Following the Council of Texas Archeologists (CTA) ceramic protocols, the key attributes recorded
for each sherd in the analyzed samples include (1) paste category (i.e., paste constituency and paste
texture), (2) basic exterior and interior surface treatment, (3) exterior and interior decorative
treatment, (4) forming attributes (including morphological class [i.e., body, base, or rim], diameter,
and average thickness), and (5) firing environment (i.e., oxidizing or nonoxidizing). This
information enables finer-grained typological and technological distinctions, which in turn allows a
fuller characterization of the assemblage even in the absence of whole vessels and identifiable
types, thereby providing a basis for placing the ceramics within a broader regional ceramic context.

Sampling Strategy for Reanalysis of Resch and Folly Site Ceramics
The Herman Ballew site was reported on relatively recently (Rogers et al. 2001), and analysis of the
ceramic assemblage was thorough and in-depth (Perttula 2001). The Folly and Resch sites, on the
other hand, were excavated and analyzed roughly 40 years ago (Jarvis 1972; Webb et al. 1969),
although the ceramics from both sites were later given a cursory examination by Professor Dee Ann
Story (personal communication, Darrell Creel 2011; see Story 1990). The ceramic assemblages
from both sites are curated at TARL, and permission was obtained from TARL to conduct a
reanalysis of the ceramics from both the Folly and the Resch sites.
Ceramic analytical techniques used to reanalyze the Woodland ceramic assemblages recovered
from both the Resch and the Folly sites followed the existing CTA ceramic protocols and the
analytical methods used at both the Herman Ballew site and the Hawkwind site. This assured that
the ceramic assemblages from four of the major Middle Sabine River basin sites in Texas were
examined in a similar manner, therefore enabling a more accurate comparative analysis of the
ceramics recovered from each site.

The ceramic assemblage (n = 17) from the Folly site was small; therefore, it was examined in its
entirety. The size of the Resch ceramic assemblage (n = 1,541) required a sampling strategy. As
with so many older collections, the organizational state of the collection, as well as the mixed
stratigraphy at the site, heavily influenced the sampling strategy and the selection of samples for
reanalysis.

The Resch site collection was submitted to TARL prior to the stipulation that artifacts be bagged by
analytical category. In an attempt to organize the collection for her 1990 synthesis of the region
(see Story et al. 1990), Dee Ann Story and a group of her students attempted to sort the collection
(personal communication, Darrell Creel 2011). Referencing the figures and tables in the Webb et al.
(1969) publication, they grouped the reconstructed vessel sections and the decorated ceramics into
categories. All of the plain rim sherds and bases, regardless of paste, were bagged together, and the
plain body sherds were roughly sorted by paste category. Given this loose organization and the
characteristically high representation of plain wares found in Woodland ceramic assemblages (see
Perttula 2004; Rogers et al. 2001; Story 1990), it was decided that the sample would focus on the
plain rim sherds and bases because they are the most diagnostic. A sample of the Woodland period
decorated rim and body sherds was also examined. A grab bag approach was taken with the plain
body sherds. Roughly 10 percent (n = 161) of the Woodland ceramics recovered at the Resch site
were reanalyzed, with the intention of maximizing sample heterogeneity (Table 6).
Given the highly variable pastes and “disconcerting diversity” of the ceramics found at the Resch
site (Webb et al. 1969), paste attributes were important elements of the reanalysis of all sherds in
the sample, especially since this diversity is mirrored in the assemblages found at the Folly, Herman
Ballew, and Hawkwind sites. Thus, individual observations were made on two aspects of paste

Atkins 100018032/120087

73

Hawkwind Site (41HS915)
morphology: (1) paste constituency—the type of nonplastic inclusions (i.e., sand, bone, grog) and
the predominant size range of nonplastic inclusions (i.e., medium sand, fine sand, very fine sand),
and (2) paste texture—the general morphology and configuration of the crystalline components,
amorphous material, and voids as observed in cross section (i.e., irregular, laminated, contorted).
When viewed in tandem with the characteristics of certain ceramic classes such as rims and bases,
paste attributes enable us to make finer-grained distinctions with regard to technological
variability, which in turn allows the analyst to more fully characterize the assemblage even in the
absence of identifiable types. Thus, each analyzed sherd was assigned to a paste category/group
according to the presence or absence of specific tempering agents.

A visual assessment of the plain rim sherds recovered at the Resch site showed marked differences
in rim profiles and thicknesses. Rims with direct profiles and flat lips appeared thicker, while rims
that were thinned in profile with rounded flat or rounded lip edges appeared thinner. When all rims
were laid side by side, there was an obvious continuum with regard to rim characteristics and
overall thickness (see Figures 28 and 29 later in this chapter). These variations have implications
not only for changes in manufacturing techniques through time, but also speak to the spatial
distribution of ceramics influenced by different culture areas. For example, thick rims with flat lip
edges are common on Fourche Maline vessels, while thinned rims are more indicative of Mossy
Grove vessels. Thus, systematically recording paste attributes along with other diagnostic attributes
such as thickness and rim form may shed light on Perttula and Nelson’s (2004) suggestion that
ceramics in this region are locally made variants that represent a distinct cultural pattern. To
address this, representative samples of rim sherds from points along this continuum were selected
for reanalysis. Paste constituency and paste texture, thickness, basic exterior and interior surface
finish, decorative treatment, and rim characteristics were recorded for each rim sherd in the
reanalyzed sample.
A similar strategy was taken with the bases. Since variations in basal forms are indicative of
Fourche Maline (i.e., flat, flowerpot), Mossy Grove (i.e., rounded or conical), and LMV (i.e., teats or
Atkins 100018032/120087

74

wedge-shaped) vessels, samples from both the reconstructed bases and lower body sherds
exhibiting different basal forms were selected. Once again, paste constituency and paste texture,
thickness, basic exterior and interior surface finish, and decorative treatment were recorded for
each base in the sample.

In addition to the rims and bases chosen for reanalysis, a sample of the decorated sherds was also
reexamined. Decorative attributes similar to those observed at the Hawkwind site and the Herman
Ballew site were targeted (i.e., trailed design elements, punctations). In addition, samples of
ceramic types identified at the Resch site were included in the reanalysis in order to compare
similarly identified types at the four sites. For example, Webb typologically identified several
sherds and vessel sections that he believed to be Tchefuncte (Webb et al. 1969). Some were claytempered sherds with contorted paste textures, and some had contorted paste textures but sandy
pastes. Sherds with sandy pastes and contorted or laminated texture were also identified at the
Herman Ballew site, but Perttula (2001) stops short of calling them Tchefuncte. Similar sherds were
observed in the ceramics of the Hawkwind site. Quantifying the differences in these Tchefuncte-like
ceramics may shed light on the variability in manufacturing techniques and/or the sitewide
distribution of this early ceramic type. Other ceramic types found at the Resch site and one or more
of the other four sites include Churupa Punctated and various Marksville-like sherds including
Marksville Incised, variety Yokena. Examples of these types were included in the sample.
Finally, detailed analyses were performed on a sample of the plain body sherds. Representative
samples from each paste category were chosen. Thickness, exterior and interior surface finish, and
firing characteristics were also recorded for each plain body sherd.

Following analysis at the macro scale, 17 sherds from the Resch site and 2 sherds from the Folly site
were selected for INAA and petrographic analysis (see Appendix C). Ceramic petrography compares
the mineral suites, paste characteristics, and inclusions for similarities, while INAA is useful in
further identifying elemental compositions and possible shared clay source areas. With this in
mind, a raw clay sample collected 400 m (¼ mile) southwest of the Resch site was also submitted
for petrographic analysis and INAA. Compositional data obtained from this sample may prove
useful in identifying source localities or boundaries that can be compared to specific ceramic
specimens.

The sherd samples from the Resch and Folly sites were chosen on the basis of their similarity to
sherds recovered from the Hawkwind and Herman Ballew sites, in particular, similarities in paste,
rim attributes, and decorative attributes. A representative sample of the sherds from the Hawkwind
site was also submitted for ceramic petrography and INAA (see Appendix C). Analyses of the 39
sherds from these three sites and the one raw clay sample will provide the beginnings of a
comprehensive database for Woodland period ceramics in East Texas, enhance the information
relevant to each assemblage, and provide valuable information about the intra- and intersite spatial

patterning of the ceramics recovered at 41HS915 relative to other ceramic assemblages in the
region.

DESCRIPTION AND ANALYSIS OF THE HAWKWIND SITE CERAMIC
ASSEMBLAGE

Data recovery excavations at site 41HS915 yielded 166 prehistoric ceramic artifacts. This number
includes 157 ceramic sherds, 7 burned clay fragments, and 2 small raw clay fragments. Included
among the 157 ceramic sherds is a small fragment whose unusual shape suggests that it may be a
possible flange from a boat-shaped bowl or small effigy vessel (Figure 17a). The burned clay
fragments are very small, measuring less than a centimeter in diameter. The raw clay fragments are
both flat, smooth, triangular-shaped pieces that exhibit striations across at least one face
(Figure 17b and c). One fragment (Lot 78; Figure 17c) was recovered from Unit 4. It measures 2.2
cm at its maximum point and is pink (5YR 7/3) in coloration. The other fragment (Lot 80; Figure
17b) was recovered from Unit 3. It has a maximum length of 2.3 cm and is light red (2.5YR 7/6) in
coloration. Interestingly, a similar small object of “pinkish clay with smooth surfaces” was also
recovered at the Resch site (Webb et al. 1969:44).

Analysis of the 157 ceramic sherds from the site proceeded in two phases. The first phase involved
an initial sort in which all the sherds in the assemblage were examined in order to identify those
that could be conjoined or confidently be determined to be part of the same vessel (i.e., fitters).
Identifications were made on the basis of similarity in paste, decorative motifs, and/or distinctive
surface modifications. When fitters were identified, they were treated as single sherds for purposes
of analysis. Treating conjoined sherds as single sherds avoids skewing the analysis toward
attributes overrepresented by multiple fragments of a single vessel. During the initial sort, 36
sherds could be matched with one or more sherds. After fitters were identified, all undecorated
Atkins 100018032/120087

76

5. Woodland Period Ceramics
body sherds less than 2 cm in diameter were culled (n = 29), leaving 92 sherds in the Hawkwind
analyzed sample.
The second phase of the analyses involved a detailed characterization of the ceramic sample
according to the six key attributes listed above (for detailed discussions of the analytical methods
and definitions of the individual attributes, see Ellis 1992, 2002, 2010; Ellis et al. 2010; Perttula
2001, 2004, 2009a, 2009b, 2010; Perttula and Nelson 2004; Rogers and Perttula 2004).

Paste Attributes

As Rice (1987:350) observes, “the microstructural characteristics of a ceramic underlie virtually all
its use-related properties,” and in low-fired pottery, the primary determinants of microstructure
are the raw materials and the fabricating techniques used to produce the pot (see Rice 1987:348).
For example, a vessel’s porosity and permeability are directly related to the size, shape, and
position of the pores, or voids, existing between the solid particles in the clay body, which, by
implication, bear a direct relationship to the particular fabricating techniques used to shape the pot
(Bronitsky 1986:223–224; Rice 1987:350–354; Saffer 1979; Vandiver 1988:142). Although the
present study does not specifically address ceramic use-wear, it is presumed that paste choice was
not random because potters knew from experience what physical characteristics and
manufacturing techniques produced the most desirable pot given its intended use. This
technological knowledge underlies the potters' selection of raw materials for paste preparation,
vessel form, and specific forming techniques (see Bronitsky 1986; Livingood 2007; Rice 1987; Rye
1981; van der Leeuw 1984).

With this in mind, each of the 92 ceramics in the analyzed sample was assigned to a paste category
according to the general character of its fired clay fabric. To facilitate these observations, a fresh
break along the edge of each sherd was microscopically examined at 10x power binocular
magnification. In particular, individual observations were made on two aspects of overall paste
morphology: (1) paste texture—the general morphology and configuration of the crystalline
components, amorphous material, and voids as observed in cross section (i.e., smooth, laminated,
contorted), and (2) paste constituency—the type of nonplastic inclusions (i.e., sand, bone, grog) and
the predominant size range of nonplastic inclusions (i.e., medium sand, fine sand, very fine sand).
Determinations of grain size were made by comparing a freshly broken edge to a grain-size
template based on the Wentworth Scale (Wentworth 1922, 1933). For those sherds having sand
inclusions, distinctions were made as to whether or not sand had been intentionally added to an
otherwise nonsandy clay (i.e., tempered) or the potter simply chose sandy clays that contained
naturally occurring sand inclusions (i.e., untempered). This distinction was made on the basis of a
major discontinuity in size distribution between the overall sandy-to-silty clay matrix and the sand
inclusions (see Aten 1983, Connaway 1980, Rafferty 1986, Rice 1987, Saffer 1979, Shepard 1976,
and Weaver 1963 for more-lengthy discussions of the tempered vs. untempered issue). Paste
categories established for this study are based on a consideration of those employed by Ambler

Atkins 100018032/120087

77

Hawkwind Site (41HS915)
(1970, 1973), Aten (1967, 1971, 1983), Aten and Bollich (2011), Ellis (1992, 1995), Ellis and Ensor
(1998), Perttula (2001, 2004, 2009a, 2009b), Perttula and Nelson (2004), and Rogers and Perttula
(2004).

Paste Texture: The specific categories of paste texture were established on the basis of two
criteria: (1) overall arrangement and orientation of the grains observed in the paste fabric, and (2)
the presence or absence of any intervening pores or voids. Observations about the textural aspects
of a sherd’s general morphology and overall configuration provide information on the extent to
which the clay was manipulated during paste preparation (e.g., wedging, kneading) and primary
forming (e.g., the fusion of coil joints). To adequately assess this attribute, it is important that the
freshly broken cross section show the vertical (i.e., perpendicular to the direction of coiling) rather
than horizontal orientation of the sherd.

Variability of paste texture is influenced primarily by the amount, shape, and size of nonplastic
inclusions and the manufacturing techniques employed by the potter during primary forming
(Shepard 1976:117–120). Some additives are used in their natural state (i.e., coarse sand), and
others (i.e., sherds, bone, shell) are ground, crushed or pulverized. Some materials break into
relatively uniform grain size or natural planes (i.e., disintegrated sandstone or shell), while other
materials have no natural planes or cleavage (i.e., potsherds or bone) to determine the size of the
particles that will be formed. Thus, paste texture is directly related to (1) the type of added or
naturally occurring inclusion found in the paste, and (2) the potter’s method of paste preparation
(see Shepard [1976:117–120] for a more detailed discussion of the issues related to paste texture).
In all, four categories of paste texture are represented at the Hawkwind site.

(1) Fine – Pastes assigned to this category have small, closely spaced irregularities across
the face of the cross section. The irregularities are generally due to the presence of
larger than average sand grains, small chunks of hematite, or carbonized pieces of
vegetal material; however, the overall appearance of the paste fabric is still relatively
uniform, and rarely are coil junctures still visible. Only one of the analyzed sherds has a
fine paste texture, and it occurred on one of the untempered sherds (see discussion
below).
(2) Irregular – The cross-section surface of sherds with this paste texture have large, widely
spaced irregularities such as hematite nodules, occasional coarse-sized sand grains, and
small gravels, crushed charcoal fragments, or burned-out chaffs of vegetal material. The
paste fabric appears uneven, and the coil junctures are sometimes visible. Twenty-three
percent (n = 21) of the sherds in the analyzed sample have paste textures that appear
irregular in cross section.

(3) Blocky – The cross-section surface of pastes assigned to this category have textures that
are similar to those classified as irregular except that the irregularities are larger and
the paste fabric appears even more uneven. Coil junctures are often visible and loosely
consolidated due to the large inclusions. Ten sherds (11 percent) have paste textures
that appear blocky in cross section.

Atkins 100018032/120087

78

5. Woodland Period Ceramics
(4) Laminated – Pastes assigned to this category have a stepped or platy look. In cross
section, the relatively straight laminas are oriented at an oblique angle rather than
being parallel or perpendicular to the sherd surface. Coil junctures usually appear
beveled. The direction of the laminas, as well as the alignment of the coil junctures,
provides information about forming techniques. For example, when laminas are angled
toward the interior, this suggests that scraping was done in an upward motion on the
exterior of the vessel and in a downward motion on the interior. By far, the largest
number of sherds (n = 60; 65 percent) have pastes textures that appear laminated in
cross section.

Thus, if the various textural categories represent locations on a continuum that moves from loosely
worked clay (i.e., contorted) to more thoroughly worked clay (i.e., fine), then the preponderance of
the Hawkwind sherds fall toward the loosely worked end of the continuum. These textural
differences also suggest the variable use of different “paste recipes” (see Ellis and Ellis 1996a,
1996b; Ellis and Ensor 1998; Livingood 2007; Winchell and Ellis 1991) in that different “recipes”
require different aplastic inclusions be added to the paste, which in turn affects the manipulation of
the basic clay fabric during primary forming. In effect, the larger the inclusions, the more difficult it
is to work the clay and achieve a more consistent paste fabric. Conversely, silty sand with finely
crushed inclusions allows for better working of the basic paste fabric, thereby enabling the potter
to produce a finer-textured paste fabric.

Paste Constituency: Microscopic examination of a freshly broken cross section of each sherd in the
sample revealed basic paste fabrics that began with nontempered, fine sandy-to-silty clays to which
a range of tempering agents had been added. These tempering agents occurred as single additives
or in combinations of additives that included one or more of the following: clay/grog, bone, shell,
discontinuously larger-sized sand grains, crushed hematite, and/or crushed charcoal or other
organic material. Six primary paste groups were identified, with group designation based on
whether or not the paste fabric contained (1) nontempered sandy pastes, (2) tempered sandy clays,
(3) only clay/grog, (4) only bone, (5) both bone-and-clay/grog, or (6) only shell. Within each
primary paste group, subgroups were defined on the basis of predominant grain size and any
additional tempering agents observed in the paste fabric (Table 7).

Paste Group 1

PG1 includes only 4 percent of the analyzed sherds (n = 4). The sherds assigned to this category
consist of a relatively heterogeneous blend of untempered sands. One sherd with a paste fabric
consisting primarily of fine-sized sands was assigned to PG1a. Three sherds whose basic paste
fabric consists primarily of very fine-sized sands were assigned to PG1b. All four sherds have
laminated paste textures.

Paste Group 2
PG2 includes four tempered sherds that were assigned to two subgroups. Subgroup PG2a includes
two sherds with very fine sandy pastes that had been tempered with crushed hematite. Both of
these sherds stand out from the rest of the collection in that they have decorative elements that
resemble one or another of the LMV types. Specimen 80.6 is a rim sherd with a laminated paste
texture that resembles the type Marksville Incised, var. Yokena (Figure 18), and specimen 83.3 has
a fine paste texture and appears to be a local variant of a Marksville type (see Figure 18).

Subgroup 2b includes two sherds with laminated paste textures whose paste fabric is composed of
predominantly silt-sized particles that had been tempered with crushed hematite. Lot 74.1 (see
Figure 18) is a small, decorated body sherd that was typologically indistinct. Specimen 113.1 is
unusual as it appears to be a flange fragment from a boat-shaped bowl or possibly even an effigy
vessel.

The paste matrix of the sherds assigned to Paste Groups 3, 4, 5, and 6 also contains large amounts of
natural sand inclusions; however, the paste fabric of the sherds assigned to these four paste groups
had been tempered with a variety of nonplastic inclusions such as clay/grog, bone, shell, crushed
hematite, charred organic material, and/or larger-sized sand grains. The presence of clay/grog,
bone-and-clay/grog, bone, or shell served as the main criteria for group membership.

Paste Group 3 – Clay/Grog-Tempered

This paste category denotes a paste that includes detectable amounts of clay/grog (i.e., raw
clay/crushed potsherds). Often the terms “clay tempered” and “grog tempered” are used
interchangeably to describe ceramics to which “claylike” inclusions had been added to the basic
paste fabric; however, there are subtle distinctions between the two in that “clay tempered”
generally implies the mixing of different types of unfired clay lumps, whereas “grog tempered”
implies the addition of fragments of fired potsherds. The latter, of course, also raises the question of
intentionality (discussed below).
At the Hawkwind site, both types of inclusions were observed. In some sherds, grog is recognizable
as relatively angular fragments that stand out from the surrounding paste matrix. The fragments
can be recognized by their distinct texture, lineations, and/or surface variability that are oriented
differently than the overall paste matrix. In other sherds, the inclusions appear as rounded clay
lumps that often differ in color and texture from the surrounding paste matrix. Their differential
presence denotes the mixing of multiple clays or the addition of lumps of dried clay during primary
forming, which points to the “intentional” blending of clays to achieve a particular consistency.
There are, in fact, ethnographic examples of potters who mix two parts of relatively coarse clays
“tempered” with one part finer clay (Rye and Evans 1976:20). Such mixing of clays occurs more
often in areas where large deposits of relatively coarse residual clays are common (Bishop et al.
1982:317). While some researchers suggest that these rounded clay lumps result from carelessness

Atkins 100018032/120087

81

5. Woodland Period Ceramics
in grinding and sifting of the clay during primary forming rather than being intentional additions to
the paste (see Weaver 1963), Rice (1987:408) makes a valid point when she notes that whether the
potter consciously chose to modify the properties of the clay by adding specific tempering agents
(or in this case mixing different clays), simply adding them to the overall clay matrix clearly
modifies the original clay’s workability, drying, firing, and use-related properties. Thus, regardless
of how the additives came to be in the paste matrix, “temper” has a quantitative implication simply
because it is present in sufficient amount(s) to modify the properties of the clay matrix. Therefore,
given the general characteristics of the ceramics with clay lump inclusions and the frequency with
which they occur, these ceramics are considered to be tempered. Since both clay lumps and grog
often occur in the same sherd, the term clay/grog is used to denote the presence of fired or unfired
clay and/or grog in the paste.

PG3 includes 32 sherds. The largest number (n = 30) of those have clay/grog paste constituencies
to which varying combinations of crushed hematite, discontinuously larger-sized sand grains,
and/or charred organic material had also been added. Three subgroups were defined (see Table 7).

PG3a (n = 3) has clay/grog embedded in a paste matrix that consists primarily of very fine sand.
PG3b includes 28 sherds whose basic paste fabrics consist primarily of silt-sized particles, and the
one sherd assigned to PG3c has a clay paste. Further subdivisions were made based on the variety
of additional tempering agents (i.e., crushed hematite, discontinuously larger-sized sand grains,
and/or charred organic material) observed in the paste. In all, eight different combinations of
tempering agents were noted.

Paste textures among the clay/grog-tempered sherds varied somewhat. Although the majority have
paste fabrics that appear laminated in cross section (n = 17, 52 percent), sherds with irregular
paste textures are relatively common (n = 10, 30 percent). Six sherds have blocky textures.

Paste Group 4 – Bone-and-Clay/Grog-Tempered

PG4 (n = 20) includes sherds that had been tempered with both bone and clay/grog. Based on the
predominant grain size observed in the basic paste fabric, three subgroups were defined (see
Table 7). PG4a (n = 5) contains bone and clay/grog embedded in a paste matrix composed
predominantly of fine-sized sand. The paste fabric of the sherds assigned to PG4b (n = 8) contains
primarily very fine-sized sand, and PG4c (n = 7) includes sherds whose paste matrices are
composed primarily of silt-sized particles. Again, a variety of other tempering agents, such as
crushed hematite, coarse-sized sand grains, and/or charred organic material, had also been added
to the paste matrix. In all, 11 different combinations of tempering agents were found in PG4.

Paste textures among the clay/grog-tempered sherds were fairly equally distributed between those
with irregular pastes (n = 9) and those with laminated pastes (n = 8). Three sherds exhibit blocky
paste textures.

Hawkwind Site (41HS915)

Paste Group 5 – Bone-Tempered
PG5 includes 30 sherds that had been tempered with bone. Three subgroups were identified, with
membership in the subgroups again being defined on the basis of the predominant grain size
observed in the paste fabric (see Table 7). PG5a (n = 13) includes sherds in which the bone temper
was embedded in a paste matrix composed predominantly of fine sand. PG5b (n = 15) includes
sherds whose basic paste fabric consists primarily of very fine sand, and PG5c includes two sherds
whose paste matrix contains primarily silt-sized particles. In addition to the bone inclusions,
47 percent (n = 14) of the sherds in this paste group also contain discontinuously larger-sized sand
grains or crushed hematite. In all, eight different combinations of tempering agents were observed.

Paste textures among the bone-tempered sherds are overwhelmingly laminated in cross section
(n = 27). Two sherds have irregular paste textures, and one has a blocky paste texture.

Paste Group 6 – Shell-Tempered

PG6 includes two shell-tempered sherds. In both sherds, the shell is embedded in a paste matrix of
primarily silt-sized particles. No additional tempering agents had been used. Both sherds appear
laminated in cross section.

These two sherds are possibly the only non-Woodland sherds in the assemblage; however, there is
considerable spatial and temporal diversity in the manufacture and use of shell-tempered vessels in
East Texas (Perttula 2012). While shell-tempered vessels did not become a ubiquitous part of
ceramic assemblages until sometime after ca. A.D. 1300, there is some evidence for the early use of
shell-tempered ceramics before its later more common use during Caddo times. The Woodland
period use of shell-tempered pottery has been documented at two sites in the Trinity River basin,
Bird Point Island (41FT201) (Bruseth and Martin 1987) and Adams Ranch (41NV177) (Reimer et
al. 2004). At Bird Point Island, shell-tempered pottery was recovered from zones dating between
A.D. 100 and 700. At Adams Ranch, calibrated radiocarbon dates suggest that the first use of shelltempered pottery occurred at the site between A.D. 257 and 675. Thus, the presence of two shelltempered sherds at the Hawkwind site may simply be another aberrant Woodland period
occurrence.

Summary

In summary, both paste textures and paste constituencies among the Hawkwind ceramics are
highly variable. Six major paste groups were identified, with 32 different combinations of
tempering agents having been used to manufacture the vessels found at the site. These highly
variable paste constituencies and paste textures indicate that several different paste preparation
and/or fabricating techniques had been used to manufacture the vessels used at 41HS915. This
variability is further confirmed by results of the INAA (see Appendix C).

5. Woodland Period Ceramics
A closer look at the distribution of paste textures across paste groups suggests that there are
distributional differences associated with different paste groups (Figure 19). While the majority of
the sherds in PG5 have laminated paste textures, irregular and blocky paste textures are
proportionately greater among the clay/grog-tempered sherds (PG3), and among the bone-andclay/grog-tempered sherds (PG4). The sherds with irregular paste textures slightly outnumber
those with laminated textures.

Figure 19: Distribution of paste textures across paste groups at the Hawkwind site (41HS915)
With a few exceptions, the distribution of paste groups across excavation units appears fairly
random (Figure 20). However, the excavation techniques and the small sample size make sitewide
comparisons challenging.

Exterior and Interior Surface Treatment

When the vessel reaches its final shape, modifications are made to the surface. These modifications
are supplemental to the basic manufacture of the vessel and are performed after the vessel has
attained its final shape. They affect only the outermost surface of the vessel and often effectively
obliterate earlier primary-forming attributes. Techniques that affect the surface characteristics of a
vessel can be carried out during all stages of pottery manufacturing; however, it is useful for
analytical purposes to differentiate between surface modifications that are carried out on wet
pliable clay (i.e., wet-smoothing) from those that figure in the finishing of dry vessels (i.e., drysmoothing and burnishing), and those that add to the detail of the overall surface (i.e., decorative
elements such as slips, incised lines) (see Reina and Hill 1978:22–25).

Hawkwind Site (41HS915)
For each sherd in the analyzed sample, the basic finish of the exterior and interior surfaces,
irrespective of decorative technique, was noted. Visual inspection of the 92 sherds in the analyzed
sample determined that four different techniques had been used to finish the surface of vessels
found at the Hawkwind site (Table 8). Among the sherds in the analyzed sample, 16 percent
(n = 15) of the exterior surfaces and 18 percent (n = 17) of the interior surfaces are too weathered
to accurately determine their surface finish.

5. Woodland Period Ceramics
Among the 77 sherds with recognizable exterior surfaces, surface finish seems fairly equally
distributed between floated/unburnished (n = 39) and dry-smoothed/unburnished (n = 36). Two
sherds have dry-smoothed/burnished exteriors.

Floating is a process whereby the surface of the pot is repeatedly moistened, then lightly stroked to
redistribute the finer particles. Sometimes referred to as a self-slip, this process levitates the fine
clay particles to the surface leaving a fine coating of clay on the surface. This surface treatment
technique is most prevalent at Mossy Grove sites and has demonstrated spatial and temporal
variability (Ellis and Ellis 1996a, 1996b, 1999; Hamilton 1988; Wheat 1953; Winchell and Ellis
1991). On two sherds, red pigment had been added to the water used to moisten the surface during
the floating process, resulting in a distinctive red-floated surface.
By contrast, the majority of interior surfaces are dry-smoothed/unburnished (n = 46; 50 percent),
and one sherd is dry-smoothed/burnished. Twenty-seven sherds (29 percent) have floated/
unburnished exterior surfaces, and one sherd has a red-floated interior surface.

Burnishing was not a preferred technique at the Hawkwind site as only three sherds had been
burnished. Burnishing is a finishing technique that requires a great deal of effort and is affected by
factors such as the properties of the clay, the mechanical operations of the burnishing technique
itself, and firing. Ethnographic evidence also indicates that burnishing was often done in stages: (1)
initial burnishing with one hard tool, and (2) a finer burnishing with a different hard tool (Dietler
and Herbich 1989). Thus, it may be that any functional significance or aesthetic appeal these
surfaces may have had was not enough to outweigh the extra effort. Or, it may be that attempts at
burnishing were more cursory. Thus, any surface luster produced during the attempt was simply
lost during the firing process.
Although dry-smoothed and floated exterior surfaces are fairly equally distributed across the sherd
sample, there appear to be distinct preferences for one technique over the other when looking at
particular paste groups (Figure 21). Dry-smoothed exterior surfaces are more common to the clay/
grog-tempered sherds (PG3), and this surface finish occurs somewhat more frequently on the boneand-clay/grog-tempered sherds (PG4). However, floated surfaces are much more common on
sherds that contain only bone temper. In addition, dry-smoothed burnished surfaces only occur on
grog-tempered sherds, and red floated surfaces only occur on those sherds that contain bone (PG5)
and/or clay/grog and bone (PG4) temper. Floated surfaces also appear to be the favored surface
finish among the nontempered sandy paste (PG1) and sand-tempered (PG2) sherds. Of course, this
could simply be due to the small sample sizes in these two paste groups; however, this same
correlation was also noted by Webb et al. (1969:21) among the sandy paste sherds found at the
Resch site. Thus, this association does hint at some meaningful differences in the distribution of the
various surface treatment modes.

Decorative Attributes
Once the basic finish of the vessel’s surface has been established, the potter may choose to further
enhance or decorate that surface. This enhancement could include one or more techniques that
either displace or penetrate the surface (such as incising, brushing, or stamping) or are added to the
surface (such as slips, veneers, or washes).

Nine percent (n = 8) of the sherds recovered at the Hawkwind site are decorated (Table 9), and all
involve techniques that displace or penetrate their surfaces. All but one of the 41HS915 decorated
ceramics are body sherds. Two body sherds have fields of closely spaced fingernail punctations (see
Figure 18, Lots 110.3 and 134.1), but neither is typologically distinct.
Four body sherds exhibit broad U-shaped lines (see Figure 18, Lots 80.6, 91.2, 110.2, and 142.1).
One small body sherd has two opposing curved lines and what appear to be the remnants of small
punctations (see Figure 18, Lot 91.2). Although the sherd is small, its design elements suggest that
it may be a local variant of the Churupa Punctated type.

The broad U-shaped designs on the remaining three sherds appear to be local variants of one or
another of the Marksville types. Specimen 80.6 has four closely spaced lines that intersect the
remnants of a diagonal line (see Figure 18, Lot 80.6). This sherd resembles Marksville Incised, var.
Yokena. Specimen 110.2 (see Figure 18, Lot 110.2) has what appears to be a modified triangle motif
executed on a wet paste. Bulk sherd organics in this sherd dated it to a calibrated 2-sigma age range
of A.D. 390 to 540. Specimen 142.1 has remnants of two widely spaced curved lines executed on a
leather-hard paste (see Figure 18, Lot 142.1).

The low percentage (9 percent) of decorated sherds is consistent with other Woodland period sites
in the region (Perttula and Nelson 2004; Rogers et al. 2001, Webb et al. 1969); however, it is more
than the percent of decorated sherds found at the Resch site (5.8 percent) and the Herman Ballew
site (5.9 percent), but less than the 29 percent of decorated sherds found at the Folly site (discussed
in more detail below). The broad U-shaped design elements observed on the Hawkwind sherds are
typical of those found on other Woodland period ceramics.

Vessel Form
In the absence of whole vessels, the general aspects of vessel form can be assessed through
attributes such as thickness, diameter, and gross morphological category (i.e., body, base, and rim
fragments). The 92 sherds in the analyzed sample include 10 rim sherds, 65 body sherds, 5 bases
and 11 lower body sherds, and 1 possible flange fragment from a boat-shaped bowl or possibly
even an effigy vessel (see Figure 17a).

In general, thicknesses are highly variable both within the same sherd, as well as among different
sherds in the sample. The body sherds range in thickness from 5.3 to 11.1 mm, with an average
thickness of 7.472 ± 1.091 mm. Comparing the average thickness of the plain body sherds (7.471 ±
1.075 mm) to the average thickness of the decorated rims (7.367 ± 1.389 mm), the decorated body
sherds are somewhat thinner and exhibit a higher standard deviation, while the mean thickness of
both the plain and decorated rims is virtually the same at one and two standard deviations.

There are, however, some noticeable differences in the average thickness of body sherds associated
with particular paste groups (Table 10). Since the thickness of the vessel wall is directly related to
the intended appearance and function of the vessel (see Rice 1987:227–228), it may be that the
bone-and-clay/grog-tempered wares may have served a different function(s) than those tempered
only with bone or only with clay/grog. While these variations may simply result from the small
sample size, this same pattern was also observed at the Resch site where sherds having only bone
temper were the thickest and those with clay/grog temper were the thinnest (Webb et al. 1969:19).
This supports the use of different “paste recipes” (discussed above) and strengthens the argument
that there may be some functional difference among the vessels associated with these three paste
groups.

The base fragments are also highly variable, ranging in thickness from 13.29 to 8.2 mm, with an
average thickness of 11.278 ± 1.866 mm. Most appear to have been rounded or rounded flat, with
no abrupt change in contour. The average thickness of the lower body sherds (9.964 ± 0.641 mm) is
thinner and exhibits a lower standard deviation than the bases. However, it is not unexpected that
the lower body sherds would be somewhat thinner than the bases, but definitely thicker than the
body sherds.

Rim Characteristics

The analysis of rim characteristics is important because the rim reveals more about the vessel
shape than do body sherds (i.e., orifice diameter), and when elaborated, they are indicative of style.
Because the rim strengthens the vessel orifice, modifications of rim form often have functional
implications (i.e., pouring, lifting, retaining liquids). For example, a thinned rim edge would be
better for pouring than would a flat lip edge. Thus, the rim is an important element of both function
and style (Shepard 1976:245–248).

The 10 rim fragments recovered at the Hawkwind site appear to be from small to medium-sized
bowls or jars; however, only one of the sherds had a sufficiently large enough radius to measure
orifice diameter. This sherd (see Figure 18, Lot 83.3), the only decorated rim sherd recovered at the
site, has an average thickness of 8.5 mm, and its diameter was estimated at around 15 cm. The 10
plain rim sherds range in thickness from 6.1 to 10.2 mm, with an average thickness of 7.45 ±
1.278 mm. When possible, four additional attributes were recorded for each rim in the assemblage,
including rim profile, rim form, lip profile, and lip decoration.

Rim Profile: The rim is the margin of the vessel orifice. This margin is distinctive only when it is set
off by some change in contour or thickness. When the wall of the vessel is carried to the rim without
a break in contour or a change in thickness, the rim is said to be “direct” (Shepard 1974:245). When
the rim is set off from the wall of the vessel by a curve or an angle, the rim is described as
articulated. Where this change exists, the rim is said to either be expanding or contracting (i.e.,
thinned). The majority (n = 7) of the rims recovered at 41HS915 are direct in profile. Three are
thinned in profile.
Rim Form: The form of the rim is distinguished by the change in orientation between the wall or the
neck of the vessel and lip. An articulated rim is set off by a curve or an angle while a direct rim is
straight with no change in orientation (Rice 1987:214). At the Hawkwind site, the majority of rims
(n = 8) are straight with no significant change in orientation, indicating the presence of simple jars
or bowls. One rim is slightly outflaring and one is slightly inward curving.
Lip Profile: The lip is the edge or margin of the rim bordering the mouth of the vessel. The shape of
the lip varies depending on the position of the thumb and the fingers. If finished entirely by hand,
the lip edge will be rounded, tapered, or rounded and somewhat flattened. A flat lip edge is

Atkins 100018032/120087

91

Hawkwind Site (41HS915)
distinguishable from other forms because it results from the use of a straight-edged tool rather than
manipulation by the fingers alone (Shepard 1974:247).

Among the 10 recovered rim sherds, the shape of the lip edge was highly variable. Lip edges varied
around two specific techniques: rounding and flattening. The majority had been rounded (n = 3),
tapered then rounded (n = 2), or rounded toward the interior (n = 1). One rim had a flattened lip
edge, and three had been rounded and then flattened.
Lip Decoration: None of the rim sherds recovered at the site had decorated lip edges.

Summary

The vessels in use at the Hawkwind site were fairly simple, straight-walled bowls or jars. This is
reflected in the straight rim forms; however, lip profiles were highly variable. Since the only
distinctive feature of a direct rim is the lip, the variability in lip profiles suggests some functional
distinctions among the vessels. If the overall vessel shape is controlled by the need for containers
that serve particular purposes (Shepard 1976:344), then the vessels at the Hawkwind site appear
to include a narrow range of small to medium-sized simple vessels that, given their highly variable
lip edges, served a broad range of functions.

Firing Attributes

The conditions under which a vessel was fired include such variables as temperature, duration of
firing, and amount of available oxygen. Variability in clay composition is also a factor. In low-fired
ceramics, the configuration of the vessel’s firing core reflects variations in these conditions and the
degree to which any organic matter in the clay has been oxidized. Thus, variation in color generally
provides an indication of whether or not pottery was fired in an oxidizing (lighter colors such as
those in the tan, orange, light brown, to red range) or nonoxidizing (dark colors such as dark
brown, gray, or black) environment (see Rice [1987], Shepard [1976], and Teltser [1993] for moredetailed discussions of firing attributes).

At the Hawkwind site, the general variation in color development observed on surfaces and paste
cores clustered more toward the darker end of the color spectrum (Table 11). This firing pattern
indicates that most of the vessels found at the site were fired in less-controlled atmospheres with
insufficient or reduced amounts of oxygen. This could have resulted from several factors such as (1)
the firing temperature being too low, (2) the maximum temperature not being sustained long
enough, (3) the firing atmosphere having insufficient oxygen, or (4) some combination of all three
variables.

DESCRIPTION AND ANALYSIS OF THE FOLLY SITE CERAMIC ASSEMBLAGE
The Folly site ceramic assemblage is currently housed at TARL and includes a total of 17 sherds
(Figure 22). While the original Folly site report indicates that 26 sherds were recovered (Jarvis
1972), examination of the assemblage by TARL staff resulted in the refitting of several sherds that
were determined to be part of the same vessel, thereby reducing the total number of recovered
sherds to 17. Treating conjoined sherds as single sherds helps avoid skewing the analysis toward
attributes overrepresented by multiple fragments of a single vessel, an effect that is illustrated in
the differing artifact counts and percentages reported in the original Folly site report (Jarvis 1972).
Detailed reexamination of the 17 sherds involved the same ceramic methods outlined above.

Paste Attributes

Microscopic examination of a freshly broken cross section of each sherd revealed five paste groups
(Table 12). The presence or absence of specific sets of tempering agents determined group
membership.

Paste Group 1

The three sherds assigned to PG1 had been manufactured from nontempered sandy to silty clays
with no additional tempering agents observed in the paste. Two subgroups were defined on the
basis of the predominant grain size of the basic paste fabric (see Table 10). PG1a includes two
sherds whose basic paste fabrics contain a heterogeneous mixture of sand predominantly in the
fine size range (Wentworth 1933). One has an irregular paste texture and one has a laminated paste
texture (Figure 23). The one sherd included in PG1b has a silty paste fabric with a texture that
appears fine in cross section.

Paste Group 2

PG2 includes one sherd whose basic paste fabric is composed predominantly of sands falling within
the very fine size range and tempered with finely crushed hematite. Its paste texture appears fine in
cross section (see Figure 23).

Paste Group 3
The eight sherds assigned to PG3 had been manufactured with very fine to silty clays to which clay/
grog temper had been added. PG3a includes one body sherd with a very fine sandy paste matrix to
which clay/grog and larger-sized sand grains had been added. This sherd has an irregular paste
texture.

PG3b includes seven sherds with clay/grog inclusions embedded in a basic paste fabric consisting
of predominantly silt-sized particles to which at least one additional tempering agent (i.e., charred
organic material or crushed hematite) had been added. Paste textures appear either irregular
(n = 6) or laminated (n = 2) in cross section.

Paste Group 4

PG4 includes four sherds tempered with both bone and clay/grog that are embedded in a
predominantly silty paste. Two of the sherds contain no additional tempering agents, while crushed
hematite or charred organic material had been added to the paste of the other two sherds. The
majority appear irregular in cross section (n = 3). One has a laminated paste texture (see Figure
23).

Paste Group 5

PG5 includes one bone-tempered sherd whose basic paste fabric consists primarily of silty clay, and
has a loosely consolidated paste fabric that appears curvilinear in cross section. This paste texture
is similar to laminated; however, rather than being straight, the laminas appear curved or circular
in cross section and the coil junctures appear distended, indicating less-thorough manipulation of
the clay during primary forming. This sherd may be an example of Cooper Boneware as described
by Schambach (1998).

Summary

Both paste textures and paste constituencies among the Folly site ceramics are highly variable. Five
major paste groups were identified, with 11 different combinations of tempering agents having
been used to manufacture vessels found at the site. These highly variable paste constituencies and
paste textures indicate that several different paste preparation and/or fabricating techniques had
been used to manufacture the 17 sherds found at the site.

Basic Exterior and Interior Surface Treatment

Visual inspection of the 17 sherds identified two different techniques used to finish the surface of
vessels found at the Folly site (Table 13). Among the sherds in the analyzed sample, 35 percent
(n = 6) of the exterior surfaces and 41 percent (n = 7) of the interior surfaces are too weathered to
accurately determine their surface finish. Among the sherds with recognizable exterior surfaces,
Atkins 100018032/120087

96

5. Woodland Period Ceramics
dry-smoothed/unburnished surfaces are somewhat more prevalent than floated/unburnished
surfaces. Since floated surfaces weather more quickly than dry-smoothed surfaces, it may be that
floated surfaces are underrepresented, especially given the high percentage of sherds with
weathered surfaces. None of the sherds had been burnished.

Decorative Attributes
Twenty-nine percent (n = 5) of the sherds recovered at the Folly site are decorated (Table 14), and
all involve techniques that displace or penetrate their surfaces. Two are body sherds and three are
rim sherds. One small body sherd exhibits two broad U-shaped lines framing a field of fine
crosshatched lines (Figure 24, 41RK26-05). Unfortunately, not enough of the design motif is
present to assign it to a particular type. The second decorated body sherd (see Figure 24,
41RK26-42.1) has a single broad U-shaped line that runs horizontally across the face of the sherd.
Given its thickness, this clay-/grog-tempered sherd may be from a Williams Incised vessel.

Three rim sherds also exhibit decorative attributes. On two rim sherds, the decorative elements
were confined to the lip. Both displayed lip notches that had been impressed rather than cut into
the lip edge (see Figure 24, 41RK26-32.1 and 41RK26-43); however, the depth, width, and spacing
between the notches vary. The third rim has an unusual crenellated decorative element (see
Figure 24, 41RK26-38). Rather than crosscutting the lip edge, the crenellations are wide, shallow,
and angled downward onto the body as if suspended from the lip edge. None of the decorated rims
are typologically distinct.

Vessel Form

In the absence of whole vessels, the general aspects of vessel form can be assessed through
attributes such as thickness, diameter, and gross morphological category (i.e., body, base, and rim
fragments). Additional attributes recorded for each rim in the assemblage include rim profile, rim
form, lip profile, lip decoration, and diameter (Table 15). The 17 sherds recovered at the Folly site
include 11 plain body sherds, 2 decorated body sherds, 3 decorated rim sherds, and 1 plain lower
body sherd. These totals differ from those reported in the original Folly site report in that several
sherds fit together, thereby reducing the total count of body and rim sherds.

In general, thicknesses are highly variable both within the same sherd as well as among different
sherds in the sample. The body sherds range in thickness from 4.8 to 10.4 mm, with an average
thickness of 7.031 ± 1.398 mm. The one lower body sherd is 13.0 mm thick. The three rims range in
thickness from 6.9 to 7.0 mm, with an average thickness of 6.933 mm ± 0.058 mm. Two of the rims
were sufficiently large to measure their orifice diameters. The diameter of specimen 41RK26-32.1
was estimated at 10.5 cm, and the diameter of specimen 41RK26-38 was estimated at 14 cm.

Firing Attributes

At the Folly site, the general variation in color development on sherd surfaces includes a range of
dark and light colors; however, paste cores suggest that the vessels found at the Folly site had been
fired in less-controlled firing atmospheres with insufficient or reduced amounts of oxygen (Table
16). This firing pattern could have resulted from several factors such as (1) the firing temperature
being too low, (2) the maximum temperature not being sustained long enough, (3) the firing
atmosphere having insufficient oxygen, or (4) some combination of all three variables.

Summary
Based on their overall decorative and technological attributes, the 17 sherds recovered at the Folly
site exhibit a great deal of technological variation. The percentage of decorated sherds (29 percent)
represented in the assemblage is relatively high when compared to other Woodland sites in the
region, and the range of decorative elements is considerable given the small size of the collection.
The possible Williams Incised sherd suggest links to the Fourche Maline culture. The three
nontempered sandy paste sherds, the one sand-tempered sherd, and the distinctive lip notching
found on two of the rim sherds (see Figure 24, RK26-32.1 and RK26-43) are attributes closely
related to Mossy Grove ceramics. Similar lip-notched rim sherds were also recovered at the Resch
site (see discussion below).

DESCRIPTION AND ANALYSIS OF THE RESCH SITE CERAMIC SAMPLE

The Resch site ceramic assemblage is currently housed at TARL and includes a total of 1,541 sherds.
Based on the sampling strategy outlined above, roughly 10 percent (n = 161) of the Woodland
period ceramics recovered at the site were reanalyzed. The sample included a selection of plain rim
sherds, bases, and decorated sherds. A grab bag approach was taken when choosing the sample of
Atkins 100018032/120087

100

5. Woodland Period Ceramics
plain body sherds from the various paste categories. Examination of the 161 sherds in the analyzed
sample followed the ceramic methods outlined above.

Paste Attributes

As with the two previous analyses presented in this report, each of the 161 sherds in the analyzed
sample was assigned to a paste category according to the general character of its fired clay fabric. A
fresh break along the edge of each sherd was microscopically examined at 10x power binocular
magnification in order to determine overall paste texture and paste constituency.

Paste Texture: Five categories of paste texture are represented among the 161 sherds in the
reanalyzed sample (Table 17). This diverse array of textures ranges from loosely worked (i.e.,
contorted) to fairly well worked (i.e., irregular); however, the majority cluster toward the more
loosely worked end of the spectrum, with 71 percent of the sample being either laminated,
curvilinear, or contorted.

Paste Constituency: Microscopic examination of a freshly broken cross section of each sherd
revealed five paste groups (Table 18). The presence or absence of specific sets of tempering agents
determined group membership.

Paste Group 1

The one sherd assigned to PG1 had been manufactured with a heterogeneous mixture of sand that
is predominantly in the very fine size range, containing no additional tempering agents. Due to the
relatively uneven mixing of the sands, its paste texture appears irregular in cross section.

Paste Group 2

Paste Group 2 includes nine tempered sandy paste sherds. Three subgroups were identified (see
Table 18). PG2a includes two sherds whose basic paste fabrics contain primarily sand in the very
fine size range, both of which had been tempered with crushed hematite. One has a laminated paste
texture, and one has an irregular paste texture.

Subgroup PG2b includes six sherds whose paste fabric is composed of predominantly silt-sized
particles to which crushed hematite, coarse-sized sand, and/or charred organic material had been
added. Paste textures varied from irregular (n = 1) to laminated (n = 3) to curvilinear (n = 2).

One sherd was assigned to subgroup PG2c. The basic paste fabric of this sherd is composed
primarily of silty clay tempered with fine-sized sand. It has a loosely consolidated paste fabric that
appears laminated in cross section.

The paste matrix of the remaining sherds assigned to Paste Groups 3, 4, 5, and 6 also contain large
amounts of natural sand inclusions; however, the paste fabric of the sherds in these four paste
groups had been tempered with a variety of inclusions such as clay/grog, bone, shell, crushed
hematite, charred organic material, and/or discontinuously larger-sized sand grains. The presence
of only clay/grog, only bone-and-clay/grog, or only bone served as the main criteria for group
membership.

Paste Group 3 – Clay/Grog-Tempered

This paste category denotes a paste that includes detectable amounts of clay/grog (i.e., clay lumps
and/or crushed potsherds). At the Resch site, both types of inclusions were observed in the paste
fabric. In some sherds, grog is recognizable as relatively angular fragments that stand out from the
surrounding paste matrix. The fragments can be recognized by their distinct texture, lineations,
and/or surface variability that are oriented differently than the overall paste matrix. In other
Atkins 100018032/120087

103

Hawkwind Site (41HS915)
sherds, the inclusions appear as rounded clay lumps that often differ in color and texture from the
surrounding paste matrix.

PG3 includes 68 sherds. Three subgroups were defined (see Table 18). PG3a includes two sherds
with clay/grog embedded in a paste matrix consisting primarily of fine sand. PG3b includes 13
sherds whose basic paste fabrics consist primarily of very fine sand. The sherds assigned to PG3c
include those whose basic paste fabrics are composed primarily of silt-sized particles. Further
subdivisions were made based on the variety of additional tempering agents (i.e., crushed hematite,
discontinuously larger-sized sand grains, and/or charred organic material) observed in the paste.
In all, 10 different combinations of tempering agents were noted.

Paste textures among the clay/grog-tempered sherds also varied considerably. The majority have
paste fabrics that appear laminated in cross section (n = 35). Sherds with irregular (n = 13) and
blocky (n = 13) paste textures are the next most common. Four sherds appear curvilinear in cross
section, and three sherds have contorted paste textures.

Paste Group 4 – Bone-and-Clay/Grog-Tempered

PG4 (n = 35) includes sherds that had been tempered with both bone and clay/grog. Based on the
predominant grain size observed in the basic paste fabric, two subgroups were defined (see Table
18). PG4a (n = 8) contains bone and clay/grog embedded in a paste matrix composed
predominantly of very fine-sized sand. The paste fabric of the sherds assigned to PG4b (n = 27)
contain primarily silt-sized particles. Again, a variety of other tempering agents, such as crushed
hematite, coarse-sized sand grains, and/or charred organic material, had also been added to the
paste matrix. In all, eight different combinations of tempering agents were observed among the
sherds assigned to PG4.

Paste textures among the clay/grog-tempered sherds are quite varied and include all texture types.
Sherds with laminated paste textures (n = 18) are the most prevalent. Sherds with blocky (n = 8)
and irregular (n = 4) paste textures are the next most common. Curvilinear (n = 2) and contorted
(n = 3) textures were also observed.

Paste Group 5 – Bone-Tempered

PG5 includes 48 sherds that had been tempered with bone. Four subgroups were identified, with
membership in the subgroups again being defined on the basis of the predominant grain size
observed in the paste fabric (see Table 18). PG5a (n = 7) includes sherds in which the bone temper
was embedded in a paste matrix composed predominantly of fine-sized sand. PG5b (n = 12)
includes those sherds whose basic paste fabric consists primarily of very fine sand. PG5c (n = 27)
includes sherds whose paste matrix consists primarily of silt-sized particles. PG5d (n = 2) includes
sherds with a paste matrix consisting primarily of silty-clay paste. In addition to the bone
inclusions, 44 percent (n = 21) of the sherds in this paste group also contain discontinuously largerAtkins 100018032/120087

104

5. Woodland Period Ceramics
sized sand grains, charred organic material, and/or crushed hematite. In all, 12 different
combinations of tempering agents were observed.

Paste textures among the bone-tempered sherds are overwhelmingly laminated in cross section
(n = 35); however, all texture types were observed. Four sherds have irregular paste textures, and
two sherds have blocky paste textures. Curvilinear (n = 3) and contorted (n = 4) paste textures
were also observed.

Summary

Both paste textures and paste constituencies are highly variable. Five major paste groups were
identified among the reanalyzed sample of sherds, with at least 35 different combinations of
tempering agents having been used to manufacture the vessels at the site. Five different paste
textures were identified. While the overwhelming majority of textures appear laminated in cross
section, the presence of multiple textures indicates that more than one paste preparation and/or
fabricating technique was used to manufacture the vessels at the Resch site (see Ellis and Ensor
1998; Livingood 2007; Winchell and Ellis 1991). Because different paste “recipes” require different
aplastic inclusions be added to the paste, this affects the manipulation of the basic clay fabric during
primary forming. A closer look at the distribution of paste textures across paste groups provides
some evidence for this in that there are proportional differences in the paste textures associated
with different paste groups (Figure 25).

textures. If we think of the various textural categories as representing locations on a continuum
that moves from poorly worked clay (i.e., contorted) to more thoroughly worked clay (i.e.,
irregular), then pastes containing clay/grog-temper (PG3) and bone-and-clay/grog-temper (PG4)
are closer to the more thoroughly worked end of the spectrum. This may in part be due to the fact
that a large percentage of the bone and/or grog used to temper the paste had been crushed, which
makes it easier to work the clay and achieve a more consistent paste fabric.

Different “paste recipes” may also have functional and/or temporal implications. Since a large
percentage of the bone used to temper the sherds in PG5 had also been crushed, the overwhelming
majority of laminated paste textures associated with bone-tempered sherds suggests a more
consistent manipulation of the clay during primary forming. If a vessel’s porosity and permeability
are directly related to the size, shape, and position of the pores, or voids, existing between the solid
particles in the clay body (see Rice 1987), then the high frequency of bone-tempered sherds with
laminated paste fabrics may represent vessels manufactured to serve some specific purpose. In any
event, the highly variable paste constituencies and paste textures found in the reanalyzed sample
indicate that several different paste preparation and/or fabricating techniques were used to
manufacture vessels found at the Resch site. These findings mirror Webb et al.’s (1969) original
assessment of the “disconcerting diversity” of the ceramics found at the site.

Basic Exterior and Interior Surface Treatment

Visual inspection of sherds in the reanalyzed sample determined that five different techniques had
been used to finish the surface of vessels found at the Resch site (Table 19). Among the sherds in
the analyzed sample, 4 percent (n = 7) of the exterior surfaces and 12 percent (n = 20) of the
interior surfaces are too weathered to accurately determine their surface finish.

5. Woodland Period Ceramics
Among the sherds with recognizable exterior surfaces, the majority of surfaces had been drysmoothed (n = 87; 54 percent), and the surfaces of 33 of those had also been burnished. The
surfaces of 61 sherds are floated/unburnished, while 5 sherds had been floated and then burnished.
In finishing the surface of one reconstructed vessel section (Webb et al. 1969:Figure 7o), red
pigment had been added to the water used to moisten the surface during the floating process
resulting in a distinctive red-floated surface that had then been burnished.

The majority of interior surfaces had also been dry-smoothed (n = 93); however, fewer of the
interior surfaces had been burnished (n = 12; 7 percent). Forty-five sherds (28 percent) have
floated/unburnished interior surfaces, and one sherd has a floated/burnished interior surface. Two
sherds had red-floated/unburnished interior surfaces.

Although dry-smoothed surfaces are the most prevalent surface finish, their distribution varies
disproportionately among paste groups (Figure 26). Among the clay/grog-tempered sherds (PG3)
and the bone-tempered sherds (PG5), the split between dry-smoothed surfaces and floated surfaces
is relatively equal, while among the bone-and-clay/grog-tempered sherds in PG4, dry-smoothed
surfaces are roughly three times as prevalent as floated surfaces. By contrast, floated surface
finishes are overwhelmingly preferred among the sand-tempered (PG2) sherds. Of course, this
could simply be due to the small sample size in this paste group.

Figure 26: Distribution of basic exterior surface treatment modes
across paste groups at the Resch site (41HS16)
Just as different “paste recipes” have functional and/or temporal implications, it may be that
particular surface treatment modes offer some functional advantage. The distribution of sherds
with dry-smoothed/burnished surfaces hints at this. While dry-smoothed surfaces are differentially
distributed across paste groups, so too are dry-smoothed surfaces that had been burnished. This is
especially true of the sherds in PG5 where the frequency of sherds with dry-smoothed/burnished
Atkins 100018032/120087

107

Hawkwind Site (41HS915)
surfaces actually outnumbers those whose dry-smoothed surfaces had been left unburnished. Since
vessel porosity and permeability are directly related to the size, shape, and position of the pores, or
voids, existing between the solid particles in the clay body, one way to influence or offset any
adverse effects created by large inclusions in the paste fabric is to burnish the surface of the vessel.
Because burnishing smooths and compacts surface particles, this finishing technique not only helps
to reduce permeability and porosity, but it also renders the vessel more serviceable by making its
surface harder and more resistant to abrasion (Rice 1987:350–355). Thus, the higher frequency of
sherds in PG5 that have dry-smoothed/burnished surfaces may be related to some specific function
that bone-tempered vessels served. This assumption also seems to support the earlier argument
that the high frequency of bone-tempered sherds with laminated paste fabrics may represent
vessels manufactured to serve some specific purpose because roughly half of the sherds in this
category also have dry-smoothed/burnished surfaces.

Thus, it appears that different surface-finishing modes are associated with different paste groups,
and that these differences may be related to some functional differences among vessels
manufactured with different tempering agents. Alternatively, difference in surface treatment modes
may have temporal implications, as has been demonstrated at several sites in the Mossy Grove
culture area (Ellis and Ensor 1998; Winchell and Ellis 1991).

Decorative Attributes

Once the basic finish of the vessel’s surface has been established, the potter may choose to further
enhance or decorate the surface. This enhancement could include one or more techniques that
either displace or penetrate the surface (such as incising, brushing, or stamping) or are added to the
surface (such as slips, veneers, or washes).

Twenty percent (n = 32) of the sherds in the reanalyzed sample are decorated (Table 20 and
Figures 27, 28, and 29). This relatively high percentage is a factor of the sampling strategy as only
5.8 percent of the 1,541 sherds recovered at the Resch site were decorated (Webb et al. 1969). This
does, however, provide a more representative sample of the decorative attributes associated with
the Woodland period sherds found at the site.

The decorative elements on the 32 decorated sherds in the reanalyzed sample all involved
techniques that displaced the surface. On 66 percent of those (n = 21), decorative techniques
involved the use of broad U-shaped lines, and on four sherds, broad lines had been used in
combinations with punctations. On another six sherds, punctations (n = 4) and pinched (n = 2)
elements were the sole decorative elements. Decorative techniques executed on a wet paste were
equally as common as those executed on leather-hard pastes (see Table 20).

Lip decoration was the sole decorative element on three rims. Two bone-tempered rims with
rounded lip profiles have a series of fairly deep diagonal notches or tick-marked incisions cut into

their lip edge (see Figure 28, E7-S4-5). The third rim, from a small bone-and-clay/grog-tempered
bowl, has a crenellated lip edge (see Figure 28, E13-N14-3). On a fourth rim, decorative elements
occur on both the rim and the upper body (see Figure 28, E1-S2-5). This unusual direct rim has a
flat lip edge with diagonal incisions crosscutting the lip edge, and is framed by a shallow, horizontal,
incised line that encircles the rim immediately below the lip. Similar tick-marked and crenellated
rims were found at the Folly site (see Figure 24, 41RK26-32.1 and 41RK26-43), and one direct/flat
rim with lip notching was also recovered at the Herman Ballew site (Rogers et al. 2001:Appendix F).
Lip notching is an attribute frequently found on Mossy Grove ceramics.

Vessel Form

In the absence of whole vessels, the general aspects of vessel form can be assessed through
attributes such as thickness, diameter, and gross morphological category (i.e., body, base, and rim
fragments). The 161 sherds in the reanalyzed sample included 50 body sherds, 80 rim sherds, 2
upper body/near-rim sherds, 15 lower body sherds, and 14 bases (Table 21).

Thicknesses are highly variable both within the same sherd, as well as among different sherds in
the reanalyzed sample, supporting the pattern observed by Webb et al. (1969:19) in their original
analysis of the Resch site ceramic assemblage. The body sherds in the reanalyzed sample (n = 50)
range in thickness from 4.1 to 10.9 mm, with an average thickness of 7.982 ± 1.639 mm. When the
average thickness of the plain body sherds (7.96 ± 1.582 mm) is compared to the average thickness
of the decorated body sherds (8.015 ± 1.763 mm), there is only a slight difference between the two.
However, the decorated body sherds also exhibit a slightly higher standard deviation so this
perceived difference is probably insignificant.
The 15 lower body sherds were identified on the basis of their curvature and their proximity to the
actual base. They range in thickness from 6.5 to 12.8 mm, with an average thickness of 9.593 ±
1.816 mm. Several of these represent large vessel sections illustrated and described in Webb et al.

5. Woodland Period Ceramics
(1969) (Table 22). Among those are three lower body sherds that Webb et al. (1969:32–33, Figure
10b-c) classified as Tchefuncte Plain. However, during examination of these sherds during the
reanalysis, their basic paste fabric and surface finish indicate that they more closely resemble the
Tchefuncte types found in Mossy Grove ceramics (Aten and Bollich 2011; Ellis and Ensor 1998;
Winchell and Ellis 1991). Once again, this raises the question of how useful it is to attach typological
names to probably what are local variants that only loosely fit the standard typological
descriptions. There is, however, one reconstructed lower body section (Figure 30, E15-N14-4) that
does seem closely related to the standard typological description of Tchefuncte. The sherd was not
described or illustrated in Webb et al. (1969), but was reexamined in 2011. Its paste consists of
grog and crushed hematite embedded in a silty paste, and the large voids in its contorted paste
texture make it extremely light in weight. It had been fired in a high-oxygen environment, but
perhaps its most telling attribute is an attached “teat-shaped” basal support. Thus, the presence of
two technologically different Tchefuncte-like sherds at this site suggests the presence of two
distinctive early ceramic traditions, each with their own version of Tchefuncte ceramics.

The 14 reanalyzed bases are highly variable, with thicknesses ranging from 4.4 to 19.9 mm, with an
average thickness of 12.0 ± 4.293 mm. This variability was due to the range of basal forms present
at the site (Webb et al. 1969:26–27, and Figure 7o–q and 7w). Four of the bases reconstructed by
Webb (1969:26–27) are among those reanalyzed. These four basal sections measured 9.2 cm,

interior and gently rounded or convex on the exterior (Webb et al. 1969:26–27, and Figure 7o–q).
Basal fragments in the reanalyzed sample also include similar shapes. In all, five different basal
forms were recognized (Table 23). The majority are rounded or rounded flat in contour (see Figure
31, E11-N8-4); however, several interesting other forms were also observed. One small fragment
with a remnant podal support (see Figure 30, E1-N4-7) is a variation of the “teat-shaped” node
observed on the lower body sherd discussed above (see Figure 30, E15-N14-4). Also found was an
annular base with a ventral concavity (see Figure 31, W6-N3-5) and two bases with distinctive
flowerpot shapes (see Figure 30, E15-N9-2 and E5-S8-4).

Rim Characteristics
A total of 80 rim sherds were analyzed, and 68 were plain (Figures 32 and 33) and 32 were
decorated (see Figures 28 and 29). The rim sherds range in thickness from 4.2 to 11.8 mm, with an
average thickness of 7.129 ± 1.676 mm; however, the decorated rims are noticeably thicker that the

5. Woodland Period Ceramics
plain rim sherds. The decorated rims range in thickness from 5.5 to 9.8 mm, with an average
thickness of 7.967 ± 1.203 mm. The plain rims are thinner, ranging from 4.2 to 11.8 mm in
thickness. The average thickness is 6.981 mm, but they exhibit a slightly higher standard deviation
(± 1.711 mm).

In general, the rim of a vessel serves a number of functions. It may be a means of strengthening the
orifice, and modification of its form may have functional implications, such as ease of pouring,
more-secure lifting, or better retention of liquids. Or, it may simply have decorative appeal that is
totally unrelated to its intended function (Shepard 1976:245–248). In order to better address these
issues, five additional attributes were recorded for each of the sampled rims. They included rim
profile, rim form, lip profile, lip decoration, and orifice diameter.

Rim Profile

The rim is the margin of the vessel orifice. This margin is distinctive only when it is set off by some
change in contour or thickness. The majority of the rims in the reanalyzed sample (n = 38) are
thinned in profile (Table 24); however, direct rims (n = 26), those having no distinctive break in
contour or change in thickness, are also quite common. When the rim is set off from the wall of the
vessel by a curve or an angle, the rim is said to either be expanding and/or contracting. Seventeen
percent (n = 13) of the reanalyzed rims exhibited some variation of this rim profile.

*Three rims weren’t measured.

Rim Form
The form of the rim is distinguished by the change in orientation between the wall or the neck of
the vessel and lip. An articulated rim is set off by a curve or an angle, while a direct rim is straight
with no change in orientation (Rice 1987:214). At the Resch site, 47 percent of the rims are straight
with no significant change in orientation, indicating the presence of a large number of simple fairly
straight-walled bowls or open-mouthed jars (Table 25). Thirty-six percent of the rims are
articulated, with outflaring or slightly outward-curving forms. Slightly inverted rims (n = 13) were
also found, indicating vessels with somewhat-restricted orifaces.

Lip Profile
The lip is the edge or margin of the rim bordering the mouth of the vessel. The shape of the lip
varies depending on the position of the thumb and the fingers. If finished entirely by hand, the lip
edge will be rounded, tapered then rounded, or rounded and somewhat flattened. A flat lip edge is
distinguishable from other forms because it results from the use of a straight-edged tool rather than
manipulation by the fingers alone (Shepard 1976:247).

Among the rim sherds, the shape of the lip edge is highly variable, differing around two specific
techniques: rounding and flattening (Table 26). The majority (53 percent) are either flat or had
been rounded slightly and then flattened; however, 44 percent have lip edges that had been
rounded or tapered and then rounded. Several rims have folded lip edges. On one interesting plain
rim (see Figure 33, E2-N1-6), the process had created a distinct ridge that overlaps both the
exterior and interior margins of the rim.

Two rims have beveled lip edges. On one plain rim (Lot W9-N1-2), the beveled edge is angled
toward the interior. On one decorated rim, classified as Alexander Pinched, the beveled edge is
angled toward the exterior (see Figure 29, E11-N14-5).

Lip Decoration

Only four of the rim sherds have decorated lip edges (see above discussion). Three have diagonal
tick marks that crosscut the lip edge (see Figure 28, E1-S2-5 and E7-S4-5). One has a series of
closely spaced impressed notches that form a distinctive crenellated lip edge (see Figure 28, E13N14-3).

Orifice Diameter

Diameters were obtained from 32 of the 80 rims in the reanalyzed sample. The rim sherd with the
smallest diameter (4.5 cm) appears to be from a small bone-tempered cup (see Figure 33, Lot W1N2-3). The rim sherds with the largest diameter (15 cm) are both plain wares. One is a bone-andclay/grog-tempered bowl (see Figure 29, E7-N10-9) and one is a clay/grog-tempered bowl (Lot
W2-S6-6, not illustrated). The mean vessel diameter for the 32 rims was 10.28 cm ± 2.99 cm, with
diameters randomly scattered along a fairly narrow continuum. This suggests that the vessels in
use at the Resch site included small to medium-sized bowls and jars that probably served an array
of purposes (i.e., cooking, storage, serving, etc.).
As Figure 34 illustrates, the range of vessel orifice is relatively similar among the major paste
groups. This suggests that orifice diameter was not necessarily dependent on the type of paste used
to manufacture the vessel and supports the notion that individual pots were probably
multipurpose.

Summary

The vessels in use at the Resch site were fairly simple, straight-walled bowls and jars having
primarily unrestrictive orifices. This is reflected in the large percentage (47 percent) of vessels
whose straight rim forms exhibit no significant change in orientation. However, the large number of
articulated rims (n = 28) with their outflaring forms suggest vessels that may have been designed
for pouring. Further, the highly variable lip profiles may indicate some functional distinctions
among vessels. This assumption is also loosely supported by the large number of plain rims and the
fact that only four of the rims have decorated lip edges (i.e., rims were designed for functional
purposes rather than for decorative appeal). If it is assumed that overall vessel shape is controlled
by the need for containers that serve particular purposes (Shepard 1976:344), then the vessels at
the Resch site appear to include a fairly narrow range of simple pots that served a range of
functions.

Firing Attributes
The conditions under which a vessel was fired include such variables as the temperature, the
duration of firing, and the amount of available oxygen. Variability in clay composition is also a
factor. In low-fired ceramics, the configuration of the vessel’s firing core reflects variations in these
conditions and the degree to which any organic matter in the clay has been oxidized. Thus,
variation in color generally provides an indication of whether or not pottery was fired in an
oxidizing (lighter colors such as those in the tan, orange, light brown to red range) or nonoxidizing
(dark colors such as dark brown, gray, or black) environment (see Rice [1987], Shepard [1976], and
Teltser [1993] for more-detailed discussions of firing attributes.)

Surface and core coloration of the sherds indicate variations in firing atmospheres, a condition also
noted in the analysis conducted by Webb et al. (1969). The general variation in color development
observed on surfaces and paste cores clustered more toward the darker end of the color spectrum
(Table 27). This firing pattern indicates that most of the vessels found at the site were fired in lesscontrolled atmospheres with insufficient or reduced amounts of oxygen. This could have resulted
from several factors: (1) the firing temperature being too low, (2) the maximum temperature not
being sustained long enough, (3) the firing atmosphere having insufficient oxygen, or (4) some
combination of all three variables.

One other firing attribute noted by Webb et al. (1969:21–22) was the presence of smudged interior
surfaces on 33 percent of the sherds in the Resch assemblage. Smudging is a distinctive variant of
open-air firing, most likely resulting from the vessel having been packed with some type of vegetal
material then fired in an inverted position. This specific firing technique creates an extreme
reducing atmosphere wherein carbon is deposited on the surface and in the pores of the vessel,
producing a characteristic dark gray to black finish. This surface results from the firing process
itself and differs from the blackened surfaces that result from using clays containing large amounts
of organic material (Hally 1983; Hamilton 1988; Rice 1987:158; Shepard 1976:88–90). This firing
variant was also noted on 3 percent of the sherds in the reanalyzed sample. Interestingly, smudging
is a firing technique that occurs with some frequency in the Mossy Grove area.

CONCLUSIONS

The primary research objective of this study has been to expand our knowledge of Woodland
period ceramics in the Mill Creek culture area of East Texas and to assess how the ceramics from
the Hawkwind site compare to other known sites in the Sabine River basin, in particular. The study
began with a detailed technological and decorative analysis of the ceramics recovered at the
Hawkwind site. This was followed by a reanalysis of a sample of the ceramics recovered at the
Resch site and an analysis of the entire Folly site ceramic assemblage. Reexamination of the 1960sera analysis of the Resch site ceramics and the 1970s-era analysis of the Folly site ceramic
assemblage enabled comparability of the ceramic attributes associated with each collection. The
data from these three sites, along with Perttula’s (2001) detailed analysis of the ceramics from the
Herman Ballew site, represent four of the major Woodland period ceramic-bearing sites in the
Middle Sabine River basin of East Texas. All are located within a 25-mile radius of the Hawkwind
site. Drawing also on supporting evidence from other Woodland period ceramic-bearing sites in the
region, this study provided an excellent opportunity to compare early ceramic assemblages from
known sites.
Most of the decorative and technological attributes initially recognized by Webb et al. (1969) in the
analysis of the Resch site ceramic assemblage remain important in the analysis of Woodland period
ceramics in East Texas. Primary among these are paste constituency, paste texture, basic surface
finish, vessel shape, and thickness. While the majority of Woodland period ceramics are
overwhelmingly plain wares, decorative elements, when present, also display certain similarities.

Thus, the decorative and technological ceramic data from the Hawkwind, Resch, and Folly sites, as
well as the ceramic data from the Herman Ballew site (Perttula 2001), provides an excellent
opportunity to compare and expand our database of technological and decorative attributes
associated with Woodland period ceramics in the region.

Paste Comparisons

Analyses of paste attributes at the Hawkwind, Folly, and Herman Ballew sites have identified the
same highly variable pastes and “disconcerting diversity” observed by Webb et al. (1969) at the
Resch site. Reanalysis of a representative sample of the Resch site ceramics supports this early
assessment. Microscopic examination of paste cross sections identified five major paste categories,
indicating at least 35 different combinations of tempering agents were used to manufacture the
vessels at the Resch site (see Table 18 and Figure 35). This same diversity can be seen in the
Hawkwind ceramic assemblage where six major paste groups and 32 different combinations of
tempering agents were identified (see Table 7 and Figure 35). Even at the Folly site with its
relatively small ceramic assemblage, five major paste categories and 11 different combinations of
tempering agents were identified (see Table 12 and Figure 35).

This diversity is also supported by the results of the INAA performed on 39 ceramic sherds and one
raw clay sample from the Resch, Hawkwind, and Folly sites (see Appendix C). The raw clay sample
(Specimen 41HS16-18) was collected approximately a quarter mile from the Resch site during the
1960s excavation and was part of the collection curated at TARL (Webb et al. 1969). Because there
are no temporally comparable samples from Woodland contexts in the region, comparisons were
made to the East Texas Caddo database. The results show similarities between the Resch,
Hawkwind, and Folly samples and the main Caddo group for Subregion 7, as well as a more general
similarity to samples from the Sabine River drainage. The submitted raw clay sample could also be
assigned to Subregion 7 (Group 1), and it clusters with a small group from the Hawkwind and Resch
sites that show elevated levels of chromium and zirconium. As the INAA report concludes, these
new Woodland period ceramic samples show a slightly greater compositional variability than do
the later Caddo samples from an ever larger area, suggesting increased movement of ceramics
and/or greater variability in raw material.
It also hints at the developmental stage of pottery production during the Woodland Period.
Activities involved in the procurement of suitable clays for pottery are as variable as the raw
material itself, and ethnographic evidence suggests that the distance a potter will travel is highly
variable (Arnold 1980:149, 1985:39–49; Nicklin 1979:442–443; Rice 1987:115–116). Further, no
clear causal relationship can be reliably inferred between resource location and potting location
simply because so many factors are involved (e.g., scale of production, the presence of suitable fuel,
etc.) (Nicklin 1979:442–443; Rice 1987:115–116; van der Leeuw 1977:70–71). Among Woodland
potters, pottery making was relatively in its infancy. Rather than involving large-scale intensive
production, pottery making was a sporadic endeavor that probably did not involve proscribed

taboos and rituals about where to procure clay. The variability noted in the INAA analyses also
suggests that pottery-making locations were probably based on necessity (i.e., replacing broken
pots). Thus, pottery production at any given site would more than likely be a random occurrence
and production locales would probably be relatively ephemeral and difficult to identify.

At the Herman Ballew site, Perttula (2001) describes the ceramic assemblage as being low in
number (n = 225 and two vessel sections) and overall density (Perttula 2001:Table 18), but the
diversity of paste classes was quite impressive, including 12 different paste and/or temper classes
(Perttula 2001:Table 19). Because the classification criteria for individual paste classes was
somewhat different from those used to define paste classes at the Hawkwind, Resch, and Folly sites
(Perttula 2001:98–109), the following comparisons were based on roughly equivalent categories
that enabled overall comparisons among the various paste groups from each site. The data
presented on Figure 35 exclude the small number of Caddo sherds recovered at the Herman Ballew
site. Proportionately speaking, the diversity of paste groups at the Herman Ballew site is similar to
those identified in ceramic assemblages at the Resch, Folly, and Hawkwind sites, even though the
distribution of specific paste groups varies from site to site.

As can be seen on Figure 35, the frequency of untempered sandy paste wares is proportionately
higher at the Herman Ballew and Folly sites, while these wares have only negligible representation
at the Resch and Hawkwind sites. There are high proportions of sand present in the paste matrix of
many of the tempered paste groups found at all four sites, and in a large percentage of these, the
discontinuous size ranges of the sand suggests that sand had been added to the predominantly silty
clay matrix (see Tables 7, 12, and 18). This relatively sandy constituency of pastes is supported by
the petrographic analyses performed on selected sherds from the Hawkwind, Folly, and Resch sites,
where measurable quartz was the predominant mineral identified in every sample (see Appendix
C).

Bone-tempered wares are fairly well represented at the Resch site and the Hawkwind site, but
occur proportionately less frequently at the Herman Ballew site, and this paste group has only
minor representation at the Folly site. Conversely, bone-and-clay/grog-tempered sherds have only
negligible representation at the Herman Ballew site, but have proportionately similar
representation at the other three sites.

Clay/grog-tempered sherds represent the major paste group in all four ceramic assemblages. While
this paste group is the most prevalent, there is also a great deal of internal variability in the
clay/grog-tempered sherds found at each site (see Tables 7, 12, and 18). At three sites, however,
many of the sherds found in this paste group also contained large amounts of sand inclusions. This
is also true at the Herman Ballew site where 31 of the recovered grog-tempered sherds have sandy
constituencies.

5. Woodland Period Ceramics
One interesting characteristic of the clay/grog-tempered ceramics is the presence of both grog and
“clay-like” inclusions in sherds. Possible “rounded clay pieces” or grog inclusions were observed in
the paste matrix of sherds recovered at the Herman Ballew site (Perttula 2001:107). At the
Hawkwind and Resch sites, these same grog and “clay-like” inclusions were observed in the basic
paste fabric of many of the sherds. As discussed previously, the grog stands out from the
surrounding paste matrix and can be recognized by its distinct texture, lineations, and/or surface
variability that are oriented differently than the overall paste matrix. In other sherds, the inclusions
appear as rounded clay lumps that often differ in color and texture from the surrounding paste
matrix. In some instances, both grog and clay lumps occur in the same sherd. The use of fired and
crushed clay as an additive may introduce multiple clays in a paste during primary forming (Rogers
and Heffington 1985:88–90, 92). Such mixing of clays occurs more often in areas where large
deposits of relatively coarse residual clays are common (Bishop et. al. 1982:317). This phenomenon
has been noted in Fourche Maline ceramics recovered from Miller County in Arkansas (Stahman et
al. 2012), and has been a source of debate in the LMV for some time (Phillips 1970; Rogers and
Heffington 1985; Weaver 1963).

To speak to this issue, the raw clay sample (41HS16-18) was submitted for INAA and petrographic
analysis. Results of these analyses provide interesting new insight that hopefully sheds new light on
the ongoing debate. Petrographic analysis of the raw clay sample shows that among its many
constituents it also contained 8 percent clay lumps and 2 percent opaque material (possibly
hematite). If the raw clay itself contains clay lumps, then it may be that the clay lumps occurring in
the paste matrix of many of the Resch and Hawkwind ceramics result from carelessness in grinding
and sifting of the clay during primary forming, a hypothesis long ago asserted by Weaver (1963).
Even so, microscopic analysis of many of the clay/grog-tempered sherds from the Resch and the
Hawkwind sites shows large numbers of clay lumps that differ in color and texture from the
surrounding paste matrix, which could indicate that Woodland potters were mixing two types of
clays whose constituents included clay lumps.
The same holds true for the opaque material (probably hematite) observed in the raw clay. If
hematite constituents are naturally present in the clay, the small randomly dispersed hematite
(assumed to be finely crushed) that was observed in the paste matrix of many of the analyzed
ceramics may in fact be natural inclusions rather than added ones. However, as pointed out earlier,
regardless of intentionality, its presence in the clay may modify its properties. In short, the
presence of naturally occurring clay lumps and opaque material (probably hematite) in the raw clay
poses some very intriguing questions about the variability in paste constituency and further
illustrates the need for collecting more raw clay samples. If, in fact, Woodland settlement patterns
followed particular drainage basins, then systematically targeting the collection of clay samples
along the various drainages might provide valuable data for tracking the movement of pots across
the landscape (cf. Reese-Taylor 1993, 1997).

Atkins 100018032/120087

129

Hawkwind Site (41HS915)
Analysis of paste texture at the Resch, Hawkwind, and Folly sites also revealed some interesting
variabilities. As Figure 36 illustrates, the dispersal of paste textures is differentially distributed
across paste groups, which in turn suggests that more than one paste preparation and/or
fabricating technique was used to manufacture the vessels at each of the three sites.

As noted above, the classification criteria used by Perttula (2001) to record individual ceramic
paste classes at the Herman Ballew site differed somewhat from those used here. Thus, the only
paste textures specifically quantified for the Herman Ballew ceramics were those that were either
laminated (n = 16, 7 percent) or contorted (n = 17, 8 percent). While sherds with laminated and
contorted pastes aren’t proportionately as high at the Herman Ballew site as they are at the
Hawkwind, Resch, and Folly sites, this is not necessarily unexpected given the large number of
nontempered sandy paste sherds found at Herman Ballew. If the various textural categories are
viewed as representing locations on a continuum that moves from loosely worked clay (i.e.,
contorted) to more thoroughly worked clay (i.e., fine), then the absence of large, irregular
inclusions such as bone or grog allows for better working of the clay during primary forming,
thereby enabling the potter to produce a finer-textured paste. Not surprisingly, the paste matrix of
many of the sherds with contorted and laminated pastes have possible “rounded clay pieces” or
grog inclusions (Perttula 2001:107).

Another interesting observation relates to the distribution of sherds with laminated (n = 60) and
irregular (n = 21) paste textures at the Hawkwind site. If pastes become better worked through
time, then one would expect an increase in irregular textures with a more or less corresponding
decrease in pastes exhibiting laminated textures; however, this does not necessarily appear to be
the case given the results of the radiocarbon analyses of residue found on the interior of four
clay/grog-tempered sherds from the site.
Dating of these four sherds yielded date ranges spanning a 700-year period of time (Table 28; see
also Appendix G). Two of the four were plain body sherds with laminated paste textures. The
residue on one of these two sherds (Lot 80.7) yielded a 2-sigma calibrated date range of A.D. 20 to
130, and the residue found on the other sherd (Lot 110.1) returned a 2-sigma calibrated date range
of A.D. 600 to 660. The other two plain body sherds have irregular paste textures. The residue from
one of these sherds (Lot 98.1) has a range of A.D. 60 to 210 (2-sigma calibrated), and the residue
from the other sherd (Lot 132.1) has a 2-sigma calibrated range of A.D. 720 to 890. If the residue
actually dates the last use of the pot, then the pots having laminated pastes were in use throughout
much of the Woodland period. Thus, it may be that the continued long-term use of pots with
laminated pastes may reflect consistent manipulation of the clay during primary forming to create a
specific texture that was functionally related rather than temporally related.

Surface Treatment
Just as different “paste recipes” have functional implications, it also appears that different surfacefinishing modes may be functionally related. At the Hawkwind, Resch, and Folly sites, dry-smoothed
surfaces are the most common surface treatment modes; however, at the Hawkwind and the Resch
sites, floated surfaces were almost as common. As Figure 37 and earlier discussions illustrate,
different surface-finishing techniques are differentially associated with particular paste groups, and
these differences are likely related to functional variations among vessels. At the Folly site, surface
treatment varied little, but this may simply be a factor of the small sample size and the weathering
of many sherd surfaces. At the Herman Ballew site, surface treatment modes are somewhat difficult
to quantify because both dry-smoothed and burnished surfaces were lumped together so it was not
possible to separate the prevalence of one technique over the other (Perttula 2001). Perttula did,
however, note that approximately 34 percent (n = 30) of the sherds from Area 1 and 39 percent
(n = 52) of the sherds from Area 2 had surfaces that had been either smoothed or burnished, which
represents around 37 percent of the sherds at the site. The remainder were classified as
unsmoothed. This suggests that dry-smoothed and burnished surface treatment modes were not as
common at Herman Ballew as they were at the other three sites. As an aside, it may be that many of
the surfaces that were defined as unsmoothed had actually been floated. These surfaces, which are
quite common on sandy paste ceramics found in the Mossy Grove culture area (Ellis and Ellis
1996a, 1996b, 1999; Hamilton 1988; Wheat 1953; Winchell and Ellis 1991), weather quite easily so
it is quite possible that the Herman Ballew sherds with unsmoothed surfaces were floated surfaces
that had simply weathered away.

Hawkwind Site (41HS915)
Burnishing is another surface-finishing technique that has differential representation at all four
sites. None of the sherds at the Folly site and only three of the sherds at the Hawkwind site had
been burnished. Less than 37 percent of the sherds at the Herman Ballew site had been burnished,
but, by far, the use of vessels with burnished surfaces was most prevalent at the Resch site. If this
finishing technique renders a vessel more serviceable by making its surface harder, less permeable,
and more resistant to abrasion, then the prevalence of vessels with burnished surfaces hints at
some functional difference in the use of vessels at the Resch site. Or, it may simply be that surface
luster was better preserved there than at the other sites. In summary, similar surface treatment
modes were used to finish the surfaces of vessels manufactured at all four sites; however, specific
techniques were differentially distributed across paste groups both within particular sites and
among sites. These differences may indicate different groups of people who had different ceramicmanufacturing traditions. Alternatively, they could indicate the same group of people who were
manufacturing functionally specific pots that were used for the extraction and/or processing of
different resources.
Pairing paste and surface treatment attributes with decorative attributes and other attributes such
as thickness, vessel shape, and rim characteristics further highlights the overall ceramic variability
within and among sites. The Resch ceramic assemblage, by sheer density and variety of ceramics,
differs from the ceramic assemblages at the other three sites. Apart from the sheer volume of
ceramics, the array of ceramic attributes found in the Resch ceramic assemblage is more
technologically variable than those found in the Hawkwind, Folly, and Herman Ballew ceramic
assemblages (Table 29). This notable variability could be because Resch was more intensively
occupied and/or excavations at the site were extensive enough to recover a larger sample of
ceramics.

Decorative treatments at all four sites cluster around a relatively narrow range of techniques that
primarily involve broad U-shaped incised lines and punctations (Table 30). Lip decoration is
infrequent, but when it does occur, it usually involves notches or crenellations cut or impressed
into the lip edge. This type of decoration is especially prevalent at the Folly site where three of the
five decorated sherds are rims with notched or crenellated lip edges (see Figure 24). The possible
Williams Incised sherd was the only decorated sherd that was typologically distinct.

At the Hawkwind site, four of the eight decorated sherds were assigned tentative typological
identifications (see Figure 18). The only decorated rim found at the site was a sandy paste sherd
with two parallel U-shaped incisions that are reminiscent of those found on LMV Marksville types,
but the row of shallow circular depressions just below the rim is unusual. Other identified types
included two Marksville Incised, var. Yokena body sherds and one possible Churupa Punctated
sherd.

At the Herman Ballew site, decorative elements included lip-notched rim sherds and a variety of
incised, stamped, and punctated specimens (Perttula 2001:114–117, Figures 39 and 40). Among the

15 decorated sherds, one distinctive Marksville Stamped body sherd was found. Eleven of the
remaining sherds were tentatively identified as Marksville Incised, Churupa Punctated, Alexander
Pinched, Coles Creek Incised, French Fork Incised, and Evansville Punctated. These types all suggest
links to both the Fourche Maline culture area and the LMV.

Decorated ceramics at the Resch site included a broader range of design elements than did the
decorated sherds found at the other three sites. Approximately 90 of the recovered sherds were
decorated and included a variety of pinched and punctated design elements, wide or narrow incised
lines, or some combination of incised lines and punctations. One unusual drag-and-jab motif was
also found (see Figure 27, E10-N9-7), as well as a number of rims with lip decoration only. Roughly
33 percent of the decorated sherds were typologically classified during the original ceramic
analysis; however, included in this total were decorated sherds from the later Caddo component
(Webb et al. 1969). During the 2011 reanalysis, the sample of decorated sherds (n = 32) included
only Woodland period ceramics (see Table 30; see Figures 27, 28, and 29). Fourche Maline types

5. Woodland Period Ceramics
Were identified, including Williams Plain and several thick bone-tempered sherds that fit the
typological definition of Cooper Boneware as defined by Schambach (1998). Early LMV types such
as Alexander Pinched, Churupa Punctated, Tchefuncte Plain and Tchefuncte Stamped, Marksville
Incised, var. Yokena, Marksville Stamped, and Coles Creek Incised were also found.

As the previous discussion highlights, there are definite technological similarities between the
Hawkwind ceramic assemblage and the Resch, Folly, and Herman Ballew ceramic assemblages;
however, there were also a number of differences. In many cases, however, these differences are
more quantitative than qualitative in that the same sets of ceramic attributes are differentially
represented at different sites. Results of these analyses suggest that this differential representation
not only has functional implications for the activities carried out at each site, but it also represents
the presence of different groups with different ceramic-manufacturing traditions. Given their close
proximity to each other, the question arises as to whether the Hawkwind site could have been
occupied by the same Woodland group(s) that occupied Resch, Folly, and Herman Ballew. By
implication, this question must take into consideration the temporal span of the site.

Webb et al.’s (1969) research at the Resch site included four radiocarbon dates that yielded dates of
410 B.C., 300 B.C., 200 B.C., and A.D. 100. A reevaluation of these earlier dates was done by Perttula
(1997:330) in which the radiocarbon dates were corrected for isotopic fractionation and then
calibrated at a 20-year-interval scale for calendric dates using CALIB 3.3c, Test 10 (Stuiver and
Reimer 1993a, 1993b). This yielded calibrated dates ranging between 555 B.C. and A.D. 325,
effectively extending the documented age range of the Resch site occupation by more than 300
years. The presence of early Fourche Maline and LMV types and Mossy Grove sandy paste rims with
lip decoration fit well with this time span; however, the presence of several later LMV types and a
small Caddo component indicate that the radiocarbon dates do not reflect the entire occupation
sequence at the site. It does, however, suggest that the Resch site had a wide interaction sphere that
included contacts with groups representing a number of ceramic-manufacturing traditions.
At the Herman Ballew site, three of the radiocarbon dates obtained from Area 1 fall within a
calibrated date range of 70 B.C.– A.D. 230, and the fourth has a calibrated date range of A.D. 910–
1020. Perttula (2001:119–124) felt that the Woodland sherds in this area could confidently be
associated with the first date range. Area 2 was more intensively occupied and appears to have only
Woodland period ceramics. The radiocarbon dates obtained for Area 2 suggest that the site was
occupied at two different time periods, with the most likely temporal interval dating between
A.D. 77 and 685.

The early Woodland period ceramics at Herman Ballew could be differentiated based on the
presence of plain ceramics with contorted and laminated pastes, the plain bone-tempered wares
believed to be the Fourche Maline type Cooper Boneware (Schambach 1998), and the large number
of plain, sandy paste wares. Also associated with this early Woodland period component are the
Atkins 100018032/120087

139

Hawkwind Site (41HS915)
Marksville Stamped and the possible Churupa Punctated sherds, which span an age range of ca.
200 B.C. to A.D. 400 (Perttula 2001:122; Story 1990:Table 66).

A later post–A.D. 400 Woodland period component is exemplified by thick grog-tempered, probably
Williams Plain sherds, the thinner grog-tempered sandy paste pottery, and the large number of
nontempered sandy paste wares. While dominated by plain wares, the presence of possible
Evansville Punctated, var. Rhinehart and French Fork Incised, var. Larkin sherds also suggests a
later Woodland period component (Perttula 2001:122).

Unfortunately, no radiocarbon dates have been obtained for the Folly site; however, the presence of
the one possible Williams Incised sherd and the one bone-tempered sherd resembling the Cooper
Boneware type as defined by Schambach (1998) suggests to at least one occupation during the
early Woodland period. Further, the proportions of relatively thin sandy paste sherds, the
clay/grog-tempered sherds, and the lip-notched/crenellated rims more closely resemble the
Herman Ballew ceramic assemblage than the Hawkwind ceramic assemblage.

At the Hawkwind site, radiocarbon dates obtained from both organic remains (primarily hickory
nuts), sherd residue, and sherd bulk organics indicate multiple occupations dating from the Late
Archaic to the end of the Woodland period (see Appendix G and Table 28). Most intriguing are the
dates obtained from the residue found on the interior of four of the sherds. If it is assumed that
these residues actually date the last use of these four vessels, then the direct dating of the sherds
indicates occupations during the middle and late Woodland periods. In the case of Specimen132.1,
the calibrated 2-sigma date range place it between A.D. 720 and 740 and A.D. 770 and 890. This plain
rim sherd is technologically similar to the other Woodland sherds in the sample; thus, the A.D. 720–
740 date range seems more plausible. Although A.D. 800 is the estimated end date of the Woodland
period, it may be that the Woodland period actually extended somewhat later or simply is later in
the middle Sabine River area. Further, all four of the sherds are grog-tempered plain wares, but two
have sandier pastes (Specimens 80.7 and 98.1) and two have silty pastes (Specimens 110.1 and
132.1). The two sandier paste sherds date earlier than those with silty pastes (see Table 28). As
previously discussed, if the laminated vs. irregular textures are tied more closely to function, then it
may be that sandy paste constituencies are more closely tied to earlier assemblages than later
assemblages, possibly due to shifting social/group interactions. For example, if Woodland potters in
the Sabine River basin were borrowing from other ceramic technologies, then it may be that
contacts with the sandy paste potters of the Mossy Grove culture tradition influenced their choice of
clay sources during the early Woodland period.
In addition to the sherds with dated residues, an A.D. 390–540 date derived from the bulk dating of
the organic material in a Marksville Incised, var. Yokena sherd (Specimen 110.2) (see Figure 18)
was also obtained. The date on this sherd is consistent with the post–A.D. 400 Woodland
components at the Herman Ballew site where a probable Marksville Incised, var. Yokena sherd was
also recovered. Similarly, several Marksville Incised, var. Yokena sherds were also recovered at the
Atkins 100018032/120087

140

5. Woodland Period Ceramics
Resch site. If the corrected and calibrated dates for the Resch site extend the age range of the site to
A.D. 325 (Perttula 1997:330), then the presence of this type at the Resch site may be somewhat
earlier than expected. However, given the date on the Marksville Incised, var. Yokena sherd
recovered at the Hawkwind site, it may be that this type dates somewhat earlier than A.D. 400 in the
middle Sabine River basin. This is said with some caution because bulk sherd dating is a relatively
new technique that has often yielded inconsistent dates (Darden Hood, personal communication
2011). In general, the ceramic types recovered at the Hawkwind site fit well with the radiocarbon
dates obtained on both the organic remains and the sherds.

In summary, what does this analysis tell us about these four Woodland period sites located in the
middle Sabine River basin? First, analyses of the technological and decorative attributes at the
Hawkwind site illustrate the same technological variation noted at the other three sites. Second,
reanalysis of the Resch and Folly site ceramics, as well as the results of the petrographic and INAA
on selected sherds from both sites, confirmed the technological variability of ceramic paste
characteristics recovered from both sites and provided more-comparable data about these two key
Woodland period sites.

Finally, comparisons among the ceramic assemblages at the Hawkwind, Resch, Folly, and Herman
Ballew sites show a mix of plain sandy paste sherds and various temper types whose proportional
representation varies from one site to another. All four ceramic assemblages include primarily
simple vessels with straight walls and highly variable lip edges. They vary in thickness from one
paste category to another, but rims with flat lip edges are generally much thicker than rims with
rounded or tapered rounded lip edges, and it appears that this change from flat, thick rims to
rounded, thinner rims may be temporally related. Bases were incredibly variable, ranging from flat
disc-shaped and flowerpot styles to round or rounded flat to nodal supports. All of which point to
broad-scale interactions with neighboring groups.

Surfaces are primarily dry-smoothed, but floated surfaces and burnished surfaces have differential
representation at each site. While primarily undecorated plain wares, when decorated, motifs
generally include broad U-shaped lines that were as likely to have been executed on leather-hard
pastes as on wet pastes. Incised lines are primarily straight, but curved incisions seem to be more
closely associated with tempered wares resembling LMV types. Fingernail, stylus, and tool
punctations were also common. Many of the more complicated designs mimic motifs common to
LMV or Fourche Maline ceramics, but the technological attributes of the vessels suggest they are
locally made variants.
Thus, the variability in technological and decorative attributes found on the ceramics from the
Hawkwind, Resch, Folly, and Herman Ballew sites reveal a Woodland ceramic technology that
incorporated aspects of several technological traditions. From the thick grog-tempered Fourche
Maline wares with their plain flat bases, to the nontempered sandy paste Mossy Grove wares with
their round bases, to the LMV wares with their podal supports, Woodland period ceramic

assemblages point to a time of experimentation during which potters in this area of East Texas
incorporated an array of technological attributes derived from other ceramic-bearing groups with
whom they interacted.

LITHIC ANALYSIS

by Candace L. Wallace, Linda W. Ellis, and Chris Heiligenstein
Analysis of the stone artifacts recovered from the Hawkwind (41HS915) site followed a six-step
process: (1) compilation of an initial inventory identifying basic artifact categories of lithic nontool
and tool for the NRHP testing and data recovery materials; (2) minimal analysis of all nontool data
recovery materials in accordance with the Scope of Work; (3) further classification and analysis of
all lithic tools from both the testing and data recovery investigations, in accordance with the TxDOT
Lithic Analysis Protocol; (4) low-power microscopic examination of all tools to further identify any
possible use-wear; (5) submission of selected tools to a technical analyst for high-power
microscopy; and (6) comparison to other collections from nearby sites with similar assemblages.

ANALYSIS METHODS
Raw Material Type

All analyzed lithic specimens were categorized by raw material type. A total of 3,484 artifacts,
consisting of debitage (n = 3,165), cores (n = 88), chipped stone tools (n = 190), and ground stone
tools (n = 41), were categorized by raw material. Raw materials recognized in the analyzed
assemblage sample include chert (n = 1,746, 50.1 percent), hematite (n = 48, 1.4 percent), hematitic
sandstone (n = 53, 1.5 percent), metaquartzite (n = 944, 27.1 percent), novaculite (n = 5,
0.1 percent), quartz (n = 3, 0.09 percent), quartz arenite (n = 18, 0.5 percent), silicified wood
(n = 666, 19.1 percent), and tuff (n = 1, 0.03 percent). Very clearly, chert was the predominant
choice for tool production at the site. Hematitic sandstone was the predominant choice for ground
stone tools. The properties of the individual material types are discussed in further detail below.
Chert is a siliceous microcrystalline aggregate of quartz, which consists of granular microcrystalline
quartz formed as nodules or discontinuous beds in limestone. Thus, the chemical formula remains
SiO2 and the specific gravity is 2.65. Chert has a hardness of 7, a colorless streak, a dull to waxy
luster, and a conchoidal or splintery fracture. The color in hand sample is typically dark gray, light
gray, gray-brown, brown, or red, although a range of colors is possible depending on the percentage
of impurity inclusions (Nesse 2000).

Hematite has the chemical formula Fe₂O₃ and is produced by the weathering of ferromagnesian
minerals. Hematite is a very stable mineral and as a result can be found in abundance in arid and

Atkins 100018032/120087

143

Hawkwind Site (41HS915)
humid environments. The color of the specimen includes shades of reddish brown, leaves a reddishbrown streak, has a hardness ranging between 5.5 and 6.5, and has a metallic luster (Nesse 2000).

Hematitic sandstone is a quartz arenite composed of greater than 95 percent SiO₂ with a matrix
comprised primarily of hematite. Hematite has the chemical formula Fe₂O₃ and is produced by the
weathering of ferromagnesian minerals. Hematite is a very stable mineral and as a result can be
found in abundance in arid and humid environments. The color of the hematitic sandstone includes
shades of reddish-brown, leaves a reddish brown streak, has a hardness ranging between 4 and 7,
and has a metallic luster (Nesse 2000).

Novaculite is a variety of microcrystalline chert containing very few mineral impurities and is
formed in Garland and Hot Springs Counties, Arkansas. The mineral has a hardness of 7, a colorless
streak, a dull to waxy luster, and a conchoidal fracture. The color commonly ranges from blue-white
to light gray and white (Dake et al. 1938).
Quartz has a chemical formula of SiO₂ and is categorized in the mineral group of framework
silicates in which every O2 atom is shared between two tetrahedrals, forming a three-dimensional
unit cell structure. The open framework system of quartz means that the mineral has a relatively
low specific gravity of 2.65 and as a result is not stable at high pressures. Quartz does not exhibit
cleavage, and the fracture patterns can be described as conchoidal. The mineral’s hardness is 7
according to Moh’s scale, and the streak on a ceramic plate is colorless. The color in a hand sample
is commonly colorless to gray, and the luster can be described as vitreous in nature (Nesse 2000).

Metaquartzite is sandstone composed of more than 90 percent SiO2 and has been subjected to
metamorphism under conditions of increased heat and pressure. The intergranular spaces of the
metaquartzite have been filled as the intense tectonic conditions deformed the mineral grains and
recrystallized the cementing agent forming a consolidated mass. Metaquartzite has a hardness of 7,
a specific gravity range of 2.65–2.7, a colorless streak, and a waxy luster. The fracturing of
quartzites is unique in that the specimen will break smoothly through the grains in a subconchoidal
to conchoidal manner. The color depends on the types of mineral inclusions and cementing
agents. For example, a metaquartzite formed from the consolidation of quartz grains and quartz
cement will be nearly white, while sandstone with quartz grains and hematitic cement will result in
a brown to red or yellow specimen (Nesse 2000).

Quartz arenite is composed of approximately 99 percent SiO₂ formed by the deposition of silica
through solution, creating a homogenous mass. Unlike metaquartzite, the quartz grains of quartz
arenite have not endured metamorphic deformation and are simply interlocked by a matrix of
quartz cement. The mineral has a hardness of 7, a colorless streak, a waxy luster, and tends to
fracture across the grain in a subconchoidal or conchoidal manner with respect to grain size. The
color of a specimen in hand sample is typically pale gray to pale brown or white. Under a thin

Atkins 100018032/120087

144

6. Lithic Analysis
section, the quartz grains will appear subhedral or well rounded, while the cement matrix will
exhibit the optical properties of quartz (Nesse 2000).

The distinction between metaquartzite and quartz arenite can become more complicated as the
constituent grains become finer in size. Discerning the presence of impurities is the key to
distinguishing between the two, as color is never a reliable physical property. For example, the
presence of impurities such as sheet silicates (biotite, chlorite, or muscovite), hornblende, and
hematite are diagnostic of metaquartzite.

Silicified wood has a chemical formula SiO₂ and can include impurities such as hematite, copper,
and manganese oxides. Silicified wood has a hardness of 7, a colorless streak, a dull/earthy to
vitreous luster, and a subconchoidal to conchoidal fracture. The color in hand sample is typically
tan to brown, although a range of colors is possible depending on the presence of trace minerals
(Nesse 2000). The key identifier for silicified wood is the preservation of the plant structure
following the mineral replacement of the original material.

Tuff is formed from materials ejected from a volcanic eruption and is composed mainly of ash. This
rock forms when these ejected materials fall to the ground. It has a high silica content, and the
hardness and color are determined solely by the constituent minerals. The color in a hand sample is
typically gray to yellow (Nesse 2000). This material is not local and is more of an anomaly, as it is
only represented by a single flake in the entire lithic assemblage.

Thermal Alteration

All lithic tools were examined for evidence of thermal alteration. Thermal alteration was identified
based upon the following attributes: color, luster, and fracturing. In particular, specimens exhibiting
hues of red, increased luster, and/or fracture patterns consistent with exposure to heat were
considered thermally altered.

Heat-treated materials can be easier to work and may fracture more conchoidally than unheated
specimens as the point-tensile strength of the mineral is reduced upon heating caused by the fusing
of impurities and microcrystals within the rock, thus allowing the material to fracture with less
pressure and in a more even and conchoidal manner. This fusing also results in a surface that is
more lustrous and evenly appearing (Purdy and Brooks 1971). Studies have shown that introducing
materials to controlled temperatures produced color change beginning at approximately
240 degrees Celsius (°C), with increased luster and reduction in tensile strength occurring generally
between 350 °C and 400 °C (Purdy and Brooks 1971). Additional work by Frederick and Ringstaff
(1994) in Bell and Coryell Counties, Texas, has shown an increase in workability of chert,
predominantly between the temperatures of 330 °C and 460 °C. These temperature-range limits
will vary somewhat depending on the chemical make-up of the particular raw materials.

Exposure of materials to much higher temperatures for longer periods of time results in abrupt
fracturing and an increase in friability. All of the material types recovered at the site are composed
of quartz crystals, which undergo disintegrative effects at temperatures in excess of about 575 ±
2 °C (Rogers 1928). These effects can be reached at lower temperatures if the impurities in the raw
material have lower temperature limits than that of quartz. Any materials introduced directly to an
open-air fire, such as those necessary for successful firing of pottery between 600 °C and 850 °C,
would exhibit such breakdown (Rice 1987).

Nontools

Nontool materials recovered at site 41HS915 consist of unmodified lithic debitage and cores.
Nontool items were further categorized by raw material and form. Each nontool category is
discussed in more detail below.

Debitage

Lithic debitage includes all unmodified, detached manufacturing debris. Debitage from the data
recovery investigation was further categorized only by form.

Following Sullivan and Rozen (1985), debitage was categorized by morphology into complete flake,
broken flake, flake fragment, and debris. Complete flakes are debitage with a discernible single
interior surface that retains a point of applied force and has intact margins. Broken flakes are
distinguished from complete flakes only by their lack of intact margins. Flake fragments have a
discernible single interior surface but do not retain a point of applied force or intact margins.
Debris includes all debitage that lacks all of the above morphology.

Cores

A core includes any relatively large stone or cobble that shows negative flake scarring resulting
from intentional detachment. Cores were further categorized by reduction and source material size.

The reduction of cores refers to the direction from which flakes were removed and was recorded as
either unidirectional or multidirectional. Unidirectional cores have flakes removed in the same
direction from a single point or area, whereas multidirectional cores have flakes removed in
varying directions and from multiple points of applied force. The size of the source material, when
determinable, includes boulder (diameter greater than 256 mm), cobble (diameter greater than
64 mm and less than 256 mm), or pebble (diameter less than 64 mm). Those specimens for which
their source material size could not be determined due to excessive flake removal are referred to as
exhausted cores.

Tools
All stone tools recovered from site 41HS915 were initially categorized as either ground stone or
chipped stone. All tool specimens were further categorized by raw material, presence or absence of
thermal alteration, and mass in grams. Each tool category is discussed in detail below.

Chipped Stone Tools

Chipped stone tools were first categorized by their initial manufacturing technique and were
recorded in one of the following categories: simple detachment-based, complex detachment-based,
and core-based. Detachment-based tools are derived from larger cores. Simple detachment-based
tools include flakes and blades that show minor modification and/or use-wear. Complex
detachment-based tools undergo more-intense modification and were categorized by production
stage. Core-based tools are derived from the core itself, often pebbles or cobbles. It is difficult to
discern between complex detachment-based tools and core-based tools. Such distinctions can be
based upon evidence from the source material itself, such as ventral surfaces, bulbs of percussion,
and/or striking platforms. Due to such difficulties, complex detachment-based and core-based tools
are evaluated and presented together utilizing the same analysis criteria.

Simple Detachment-based Tools

Simple detachment-based tools are initially separated by class into flake or blade. Blades refer to
specimens specifically produced through blade technology. Such specimens were removed from
blade cores. These items are typically long and often distinguished by being at least twice as long as
they are wide, and they retain parallel lateral edges. Flakes include all other materials detached as a
result of the reduction process.

Both flakes and blades in this assemblage are subclassified as bifacially modified, unifacially
modified, or utilized. Bifacial modification refers to intentional modification along one or more
opposing edges, often evidenced by patterned microchipping. Unifacial modification refers to
intentional modification along one or more edges, also often evidenced by microchipping. These
tools often show evidence of wear along the modified edge(s). Utilized specimens exhibit use-wear
on one or more edges but lack intentional modification. Wear patterns were used to further
evaluate tool use and the material(s) the tool was used on.

Flakes and blades were further categorized by morphology. For modified blades, this information
was recorded based upon the modification form, for example backed or stemmed. For unmodified
(utilized) blades, this information is recorded based upon the morphology, such as dihedral or
polyhedral. Form for both modified and utilized flakes was categorized following Sullivan and
Rozen (1985) as complete flake, broken flake, flake fragment, and debris, as previously discussed in
the debitage section.
Atkins 100018032/120087

Hawkwind Site (41HS915)
All specimens were further categorized by size grade and percentage of cortex present. Size grade
was determined using a series of nested sieves with the following sizes being recorded: 4 inches,
3 inches, 2 inches, 1 inch, and <1 inch. Percentage of cortex present was recorded within one of the
five following ranges: 0 percent, 1–25 percent, 26–50 percent, 51–75 percent, and 76–100 percent.
This percentage refers to the approximate amount of cortex remaining on the entirety of the
specimen.
All simple-detachment based tools were then categorized by use-wear type(s). This assemblage
expressed a maximum of four different wear locations/types. For each location, the following
information was recorded: alteration type, alteration location, alteration shape, alteration length,
and alteration utilization.

Alteration type refers to the specific tool utilization. The following utilizations were observed within
this assemblage: adzing, cutting, perforating, planing, sawing, and scraping. Both cutting and sawing
activities require the flake be held with the working edge parallel to the direction of use. The
difference between the two is that sawing is generally used on harder materials such as bone or
wood (Keeley 1980). Both planing and scraping activities involve the flake being held with the
working edge approximately at a right angle to the direction of use; however, with planing the flake
edge is pushed, while with scraping the flake edge is pulled (Keeley 1980). Adzing activities require
the flake to be held at a low angle towards the material surface and involve multiple, quick strikes
against the material (Keeley 1980). Perforation activities require the flake to be held at an
approximate 90-degree angle against the working surface, whereby the flake is utilized for a rotary
action such as boring (Keeley 1980).

Alteration location refers to the portion of the flake where the wear occurred. Such locations
include proximal edge, distal edge, and lateral edge. Alteration shape refers to the modified location
shape and includes beaked, concave, convex, recurved, and straight. Alteration length refers to the
length in millimeters of the entirety of the utilized edge. Alteration utilization refers to the material
the flake was used against. Such materials are recorded as soft, medium soft, medium hard, and
hard. Broad terminology for these materials was selected due to the microscopic limits.

Metric measurements for maximum length, width, and thickness were also recorded for each
specimen.

Complex Detachment-based and Core-based Tools

Both complex detachment-based and core-based tools were initially separated by class into biface
or nonbiface. Both bifaces and nonbifaces were then further subclassified as formal or informal.
Formal specimens follow a clear trajectory of reduction towards a final tool form, represented in
stages of production. Informal tool specimens are expedient in nature.

Atkins 100018032/120087

6. Lithic Analysis
Tool type for complex detachment-based and core-based tools refers specifically to the function of
the tool. Types recorded for this assemblage are adze, chopper, drill, knife, perforator, planer,
projectile point, and scraper. Specimens for which a specific type could not be discerned were
simply listed as indeterminate.
Tool types were initially analyzed based upon morphological attributes and macroscopic use-wear
observations. Tools were then submitted for microscopic use-wear analysis, and upon such
analysis, some tools were reassessed and identified as other tool types. Morphological
characteristics for each type are listed below.

Adzes are identified as bifacial tools with a unifacial beveled edge, which requires the tool to be held
at a low angle towards the material surface and involves multiple, quick strikes against the material
(Keeley 1980). Choppers are identified as larger cobbles with minimal evidence of reduction along a
single bit edge, with such reduction being unifacial or bifacial and wear indicative of heavy use
(Turner and Hester 1999). Drills are bifacially worked formal tools exhibiting patterned wear
consistent with use in full rotary motions and are often manufactured from exhausted dart point
bases, and therefore maintain all or most of the original dart point base (Turner and Hester 1999).
These tools are larger than perforators and are generally made from other tools such. Knives are
unifacial or bifacial specimens that require the tool to be held with the working edge parallel to the
direction of use for cutting or sawing either soft or hard tissues (Keeley 1980). Perforators are
unifacial or bifacial tools held at an approximate 90° angle against the working surface, whereby
the tool is utilized for a rotary action such as boring (Keeley 1980). Perforators are generally
smaller than drills (Turner and Hester 1999). Both planers and scrapers are unifacial or bifacial
tools that are held with the working edge approximately at a right angle to the direction of use;
however, with planers the edge is pushed, while with scrapers the edge is pulled (Keeley 1980).
Projectile points are identified as bifacially formed tools and contain a hafting element, allowing for
attachment to a spear or arrow shaft. Such tools may exhibit signs of being reworked and could
have been reused during multiple occupation periods.

All materials were then categorized by subtype/identity, which refers to how they are generally
identified typologically. The following specific subtypes were identified within the assemblage:
Catahoula arrow point, Friley arrow point, Ellis dart point, Ensor dart point, Gary dart point, Godley
dart point, Morrill dart point, Yarbrough dart point, and Harvey-Mineola biface. Additionally,
materials that could not be categorized by subtype but could be identified as a dart point are listed
as indeterminate dart point. Specific qualifications for these types are listed below.

Catahoula arrow points are characterized by concave to recurved lateral edges with outflaring
shoulders with the primary attribute of large rounded, often squared, barbs. Catahoula arrow
points in this collection include all specimens that retain the following attributes: corner notches,
short base/stem ratio, straight basal edge, 70° shoulder angles, bifacial-bilateral edge construction,
flared shoulders, squared barbs, and average edge angles of 25°.
Atkins 100018032/120087

149

Hawkwind Site (41HS915)
Friley arrow points are characterized by expanding stems, barbs, and prominent, outflaring/
recurved shoulders. Additionally, specimens in this collection retain the following characteristics:
recurved lateral edges, random flake scar patterning, bifacial-bilateral edge construction, short base
to stem ratio, straight basal edge, and 75° shoulder angles.
Ellis dart points are characterized by triangular-shaped bodies, shallow corner notches, and
expanding stems. Specimens in the collection share the following characteristics: straight to convex,
sometimes serrated lateral edges; random or collateral flake scare patterns; bifacial-bilateral edge
construction; edge angles between 60° and 65°; short base to stem rations; convex basal edges;
expanding stems; and 70°–75° shoulder angles.

Ensor dart points are characterized by slender, triangular-shaped blades with broad stems and
shallow to moderately deep side notches. Additionally, specimens in this collection retain the
following characteristics: convex basal edge, short base/stem ratio, bifacial-bilateral edge
construction, edge angles of 70°, and convex lateral edges.

Gary dart points are characterized predominantly by triangular-shaped blades and contracting
stems. There is much variation in the remainder of the Gary point characteristics. For this reason,
all Gary dart points were further evaluated by variety, applying Johnson’s varieties utilized at the
Yarbrough site (Johnson 1962). These varieties consist of Alsa, Colfax, Emory, Hobson, Kaufman,
Kemp, Kenedy, Panna Maria, and Runge. Basic attributes of these varieties are presented in Table 31.

Godley dart points are characterized by small, triangular-shaped blades, prominent shoulders
without barbs, and a narrow slightly expanding stem with a convex basal edge. Additionally,
specimens in this collection retain the following characteristics: 70° edge angles, straight lateral
edges, collateral flake scar pattern, bifacial-bilateral edge construction, long base to stem ratio, and
70° shoulder angles. The Godley dart point does bear similarity to the Delhi point. However, the
Godley point’s expanding stem with its convex basal edge is slightly different than the Delhi point’s
more-rectangular stem with its often concave basal edge (see Webb 1981).

Morrill dart points are characterized by slender, triangular-shaped blades, straight lateral edges,
indistinct to squared shoulders, and long and wide rectangular stems. Additionally, specimens
within this collection retain the following characteristics: 65° edge angle, collateral flake scar
pattern, bifacial-bilateral edge construction, proximal edge grinding, long base to stem ratio, and
70° shoulder angles.

Yarbrough dart points are characterized by slender, triangular-shaped blades, prominent shoulders
without barbs, and parallel to expanding stem edges. There is some variation in lateral edges, stem
form, and basal edges. Therefore, all Yarbrough dart points were further evaluated by variety,
applying Johnson’s varieties utilized at the Yarbrough site (Johnson 1962). These varieties consist
of Dike, Lindale, and Mabank. Basic attributes of these varieties are presented in Table 32.

Harvey-Mineola bifaces are characterized as knives made from flat, tabular sections of silicified
wood. These tools are utilized along one long edge, and sometimes both, but rarely on three edges.
The beveling on the utilized edges is steep, and the faces of the tool often retain cortex.

Metric measurements for maximum length, width, and thickness were recorded in millimeters for
each specimen. In addition, the average working edge angle was recorded to the nearest 5° interval
using a goniometer.

Stage was evaluated for all complex detachment-based and core-based tools utilizing the five-stage
trajectory presented by Goode (2002). Stage 1 refers to initial package reduction, which is
evidenced by specimens that are irregular in shape, retain large amounts of cortex, and exhibit
minimal to no thinning along the edges. Stage 2, blank preparation, is evidenced by specimens that
have more-regularized shapes, retain minimal to no cortex, and exhibit minimal thinning and some
lateral refinement. Stage 3, preform shaping and thinning, is evidenced by specimens that have
regularized shapes, retain no cortex, and exhibit secondary thinning. Stage 4, final edge trimming
and sharpening, includes specimens that have reached their intended final form. Most tools of this
stage represent specimens that were broken during use, cached, lost, or abandoned. Stage 5,
rejuvenated forms, is evidenced by reworked edges, reduction in size, and has been reworked.
Some specimens were too fragmentary to have a stage assigned and are simply listed as
indeterminate.

6. Lithic Analysis
Portion refers to the extant amount of each individual tool, especially the large number of
fragmented specimens. Portion is classified as indeterminate, complete, distal, distal-medial,
medial, proximal-medial, proximal, lateral edges missing, fragment, barb/shoulder, ear/tang, or
stem. Fragment was used to describe specimens that were too fragmentary to determine portion.
Indeterminate was used to describe specimens whose portion cannot be distinguished between
other known portion options, such as proximal and distal.

Failure/Discard was recorded for all specimens with the following categories: indeterminate,
snap/end shock, impact/bending, perverse, hinge/step, overshot, material flaw, platform loss,
excessive heating, exhausted, and cached.

Material alterations were also recorded for all specimens. Such alterations can include the
following: none observed, indeterminate, thermal, white patina, black patina, oxide
staining/yellowing, pigment staining, carbonate buildup, and other. The only alteration type
observed within the assemblage was thermal. The attributes representing thermal alteration are
discussed above.
Edge morphology was recorded for all specimens, focusing only on the working edge of the tool. The
following categories were recorded for this evaluation: indeterminate, straight (outward or inward
edge projection less than 2 mm), concave (outward edge projection greater than or equal to 2 mm
and less than or equal to 4.9 mm), convex (inward edge projection greater than or equal to 2 mm
and less than or equal to 4.9 mm), recurved (outward and inward edge projection of greater than or
equal to 2 mm), serrated, very concave (inward edge projection greater than or equal to 5 mm),
very convex (outward edge projection greater than or equal to 5 mm), and not applicable.

A variety of flake scar patterns was recorded for each tool type, including indeterminate (pattern
cannot be discerned and often used for fragmented specimens), collateral (parallel flaking from
each edge reaching the middle of the tool, forming a medial ridge), horizontal transverse
(horizontal parallel flakes beginning on one lateral edge, traversing a single face of the tool, and
terminating on the opposite lateral edge), oblique transverse (diagonal parallel flakes beginning on
one lateral edge, traversing a single face of the tool, and terminating on the opposing lateral edge),
and random (unpatterned flake removal).
Complex detachment-based and core-based tools can have edges prepared in many different
fashions. The primary distinction is between unifacial and bifacial preparation. Edge construction
type was categorized as indeterminate, bifacial-distal, bifacial-bilateral, bifacial-unilateral, bifacialdistal-bilateral, bifacial-distal-unilateral, bifacial-circumferential, unifacial-distal, unifacial-bilateral,
unifacial-unilateral, unifacial-distal-unilateral, unifacial-circumferential, and other.
While many of these tool types were submitted to a technical analyst for more-intensive use-wear
analysis, all specimens were examined under low-power microscopy for the following types of usewear: flaking attrition, crushing and smoothing, polish, and etching/pitting.

Atkins 100018032/120087

153

Hawkwind Site (41HS915)
Flaking attrition is evidenced by the removal of small flakes in a feathered or stepped manner,
which results from tool use. These flakes are often more obtuse and have sharper facets than
regular trimming flakes found on the preparatory edge of a tool. Flaking attrition is locationdependent and classified as not present, bifacial-distal, bifacial-bilateral, bifacial-unilateral, bifacialdistal-bilateral, bifacial-distal-unilateral, bifacial-circumferential, unifacial-distal, unifacial-bilateral,
unifacial-unilateral, unifacial-distal-bilateral, unifacial-distal-unilateral, unifacial-circumferential,
unifacial-bilateral-oppositional, and other.

Crushing and smoothing are attributes most often associated with ground and battered stone tools,
but can occasionally occur on chipped stone tools. If identified, the following categories describing
the location were recorded: not present, distal, distal-lateral, unilateral, bilateral, facial smoothing,
facet smoothing, circumferential, primary proximal, and secondary proximal.
Polish is evidenced by luster/shine on a working edge of a tool. Polish does not include any wear
attributed to hafting or thermal alteration. Polish is recorded by location and extent. Shallow refers
to polish extending less than 5 mm from the tool edge, while deep refers to polish that extends
beyond 5 mm from the tool edge. The following categories were employed for location and degree
of polish: not present, shallow distal, deep distal, shallow lateral, deep lateral, unifacial-medial,
bifacial-medial, bipolar, and proximal.

Etching/pitting refers to the striations and depressions that result from grinding and/or pecking.
The location and extent of this attribute were recorded, with shallow referring to wear less than
5 mm from the tool edge and deep referring to extension beyond 5 mm from the edge. The
following categories were used to describe the location and degree of etching/pitting: not present,
shallow distal, deep distal, shallow lateral, deep lateral, unifacial-medial, distal-medial,
circumferential, medial-bifacial, and bipolar.
All specimens were categorized by the presence or absence of a hafting element. Evidence
suggesting hafting includes any of the following attributes observed on the proximal end of the tool:
lateral edge dulling, lateral edge polish, facial facets, and presence of a mastic.

Projectile points were further categorized by point class. Recorded point class types are corner
notched, side notched, stemmed, triangular, and lanceolate. Metric data recorded for all cornernotched and side-notched points include point length, point width, point ratio, left and right blade
lengths, base/stem length or basal inflection, base/stem width, neck thickness, neck width, left and
right notch depths, notch ratios, base to blade length ratio, base to blade width ratio, base/stem
ratio, base form, left and right blade curvature, and left and right shoulder angles. Metric data
recorded for all stemmed points include point length, point width, point ratio, left and right blade
lengths, base/stem length or basal inflection, base/stem width, neck thickness, neck width, base to
blade length ratio, base to blade width ratio, base/stem ratio, base form, stem form, left and right
blade curvature, and left and right shoulder angles. Metric data recorded for triangular points

6. Lithic Analysis
consist of point length, point width, point ratio, left and right blade lengths, base/stem length or
basal inflection, base to blade length ratio, distal base form, left and right blade curvature, and left
and right base angles. Metric data recorded for lanceolate points consist of point length, point
width, point ratio, left and right blade lengths, base/stem length or basal inflection, neck thickness,
neck width, base to blade length ratio, distal base form, lateral base/stem form, and left and right
blade curvature.

Ground Stone Tools

Ground and battered stone tools are generalized tools in the sense that a single tool may not be
functionally specific with regard to the manner in which it is used or the things it is used to process
or prepare. To systematically classify these tools, it is important to use well-defined criteria for
recognizing their diverse nature and possible function. Since a variety of processes can produce
distinctive wear, tools were assigned to specific analytical categories on the basis of several key
variables: the mechanical processes, the outcome of those processes, and the material being
processed. Microscopic examination of each tool aided in the identification of the key mechanical
processes and the subsequent wear patterns still visible on the tool. Because any specific tool can
be used in a range of activities, multifunctional tools were categorized on the basis of the
predominant type of wear still visible on the tool.
The primary mechanical operations involved while using a ground stone tool are rubbing and
pounding. Rubbing combines pressure and friction in order to reduce mass through abrasive action,
such as the grinding down of coarse particles into finer particles, by scouring or scraping away the
surface, or by sharpening, smoothing, or refining. The mechanical operation of rubbing can be used
to reduce the mass of vegetal material (such as corn kernels, roots, or seeds) or nonplant material
(such as clay or ochre). In this case, the material(s) to be ground are placed on the hard stationary
surface or platform, and processing occurs when the upper hand-held stone slides across the lower
anvil stone (see Carter 1977 and Kraybill 1977). However, the same mechanical operation is
performed when ground stone tools are used to rub across a soft surface, such as hides or wood.
Thus, the mechanical operation (rubbing) is the same, but surface to surface contacts vary
depending on the type of material being processed, thereby resulting in wear patterns with
different characteristics.
Pounding is a process of forceful impact. It is a pulverizing or crushing action that dehulls (as in the
case of seeds and nuts) or reduces volume through the exertion of pressure (as in the case of roots
and/or nutmeats). Pounding can also be used to reduce the mass of nonplant materials such as the
pulverizing of old potsherds for use as temper. Pounding can be employed to roughen the surface,
as when the surface of a grinding slab is pecked; however, pounding can also be used as a means of
softening, such as pounding the inner side of hide blankets (see Opler 1941:378).

Atkins 100018032/120087

Hawkwind Site (41HS915)
Pounding and rubbing are processes that produce certain outcomes. Apart from the objective of the
process (such as dehulling nuts or grinding grass seeds), the process itself (i.e., rubbing or
pounding) results in certain types of wear on the tool. Depending on the surface to surface contacts
(i.e., hard-object-to-hard-object or hard-object-to-soft-object), rubbing can produce at least five
different types of wear. (1) Grinding is wear that results from surface fatigue associated with the
pressure and friction generated when two objects are repeatedly rubbed together (see Adams
1996; Teer and Arnell 1975). (2) Polishing is a form of tribochemical wear that occurs when surface
fatigue and abrasive wear produce surfaces that are flat enough and smooth enough for the buildup
of films and/or oxides. These smooth, shiny, glossy, or greasy surface(s) can result from actions
such as rubbing a fine-grained piece of stone against a coarser-grained piece of stone, from friction
against a softer material such as a hide, or from the residual buildup of the materials being ground
(Adams 1996; Semenov 1964; Vaughan 1975). (3) Striations are fine, thin lines that occur on the
working edge and/or surface of the tool. They can occur as sets of lines that run parallel to one
another in the same direction, as sets of crosscutting multidirectional lines, or as circular swirls.
This type of wear is often used to infer the direction of use. (4) Grooves, by contrast, are broad
furrows or channels characterized by linear, often parallel, troughs that have been cut into the
surface of the tool. (5) Notches are indentations that occur at or close to the edge of a tool. These
indentations can be shallow or deep, but differ from striations and grooves in that they are
generally wider and shorter and occur as V-shaped or U-shaped troughs close to the edge of the tool
(see Vaughan 1975).

Pounding also results in distinctive wear patterns that differ from those produced by the
mechanical operation of rubbing. (1) Battering is wear that results from forceful impact. This type
of wear is characterized by irregular indentations in the stone or crushed areas usually on the ends
or sides (see Bell and Cross 1980). (2) Pecking is a special form of battering related to the
refurbishing or roughening of a hand stone and/or the surface of an anvil stone. Wear associated
with pecking is characterized by small random indentations or dimples across the ground or
polished face or along the edges. (3) Pitting occurs when large sections of a stone’s surface are
displaced during repeated pounding in the same area. These larger pitted areas are often
characterized by jagged depressions or holes on the working surface.

LITHIC ANALYSIS RESULTS

All analyzed lithic specimens were subject to the aforementioned analysis criteria. A total of 3,484
lithic materials from the site were analyzed. This total comprises the 6 lithic tools recovered during
NRHP testing and 3,478 specimens from data recovery (all lithic materials). These lithic materials
are composed of 231 tools and 3,253 nontool specimens. Lithic tools include both chipped stone
(n = 190) and ground stone (n = 41) specimens. Nontools consist of cores (n = 88) and debitage
(n = 3,165).

Nontools
A total of 3,253 specimens comprise the nontool collection, originating only from the data recovery
investigation. These materials were further subdivided into cores (n = 88) and debitage (n = 3,165).
Raw material types encountered in the nontool assemblage sample include chert (n = 1,648,
50.7 percent), hematite (n = 42, 1.3 percent), hematitic sandstone (n = 34, 1.1 percent),
metaquartzite (n = 901, 27.7 percent), quartz arenite (n = 14, 0.4 percent), silicified wood (n = 612,
18.8 percent), and quartz (n = 1, 0.0 percent). Based upon the materials observed in the collection,
it is suggested that availability, rather than material type, was the primary concern for selection of
materials for lithic production.

Cores

Raw material types recorded for the analyzed cores are chert (n = 48, 54.6 percent), metaquartzite
(n = 23, 26.1 percent), quartz arenite (n = 4, 4.6 percent), and silicified wood (n = 13, 14.8 percent).
All attributes recorded for the analyzed cores are also presented in Appendix H, Table H-1. Thirtynine of the specimens exhibited multidirectional reduction, while 49 exhibited unidirectional
reduction. Only a single specimen had a source material large enough to be identified as a cobble,
36 specimens were identified as pebble source materials, and 51 specimens were utilized to
exhaustion, prohibiting source material identification. It can be inferred from the information that
source materials were selected based upon availability, likely from nearby river pebbles. Once
selected, it can also be assumed that these materials were fully utilized and discarded only upon full
exhaustion.

Debitage

Raw material types recorded for debitage are chert (n = 1,600, 50.6 percent), hematite (n = 42,
1.3 percent), hematitic sandstone (n = 34, 1.1 percent), metaquartzite (n = 878, 27.7 percent),
quartz (n = 1, <0.01 percent), quartz arenite (n = 10, 0.3 percent), silicified wood (n = 599,
18.9 percent), and tuff (n = 1, <0.01 percent). All attributes recorded for the analyzed debitage are
presented in Appendix H, Table H-2.
The 3,165 pieces of unmodified debitage were categorized by morphology into complete flakes,
broken flakes, flake fragments, and debris. This assemblage includes 1,645 complete flakes
(52.0 percent), 889 broken flakes (28.1 percent), 590 flake fragments (18.6 percent), and 41 pieces
of debris (1.3 percent). The high proportions of complete flakes and debris along with the low
proportions of broken flakes and flake fragments would suggest that this assemblage resulted more
from primary core reduction rather than tool production, use, and maintenance. However, this
collection contains a small number of cores and a large number of lithic tools, many of which show
evidence of rejuvenation. This evidence suggests that Sullivan and Rozen’s (1985) theory alone
cannot be applied to the debitage in this collection, as the remainder of this lithic assemblage does
not agree with this theory.

Tools
A total of 231 lithic tools were recovered from the testing and data recovery investigations at the
site. This assemblage is composed of 190 chipped stone tools and 41 ground stone tools. Each
technology was evaluated differently, and the data are presented in further detail below.

Chipped Stone Tools

Chipped stone tools were further categorized and evaluated separately as simple detachment-based
(n = 9), core-based (n = 27), and complex detachment-based (n = 154). It was not always possible to
confidently distinguish between core-based and complex detachment-based tools. Consequently,
data for these materials are evaluated and presented together.

Simple Detachment-based Tools

Simple detachment-based tools represent a minor component of the tool types recovered at the
site, accounting for only 3 percent (n = 9) of the total tool assemblage. Subclasses recovered from
the site include a bifacially modified flake (n = 1), unifacially modified flakes (n = 7) and a utilized
flake (n = 1). The simple detachment-based tools included in this section of the lithic analysis
include chert (n = 8) and silicified wood (n = 1), while six specimens exhibit signs of thermal
alteration. Patterned use-wear observed within this assemblage was consistent with scraping,
planing and cutting activities, which presumably resulted from plant and animal processing. All
attribute data for the simple detachment-based tools can also be located in Appendix H, Table H-3.

Bifacially Modified Flake

The single bifacially modified flake (Lot 130) is a flake fragment composed of silicified wood that
has been bifacially modified along the concave distal edge. The flake exhibits 16.89 mm of edge
modification on the ventral surface, while modification of the flake is consistent with utilization for
planing medium-soft materials, such as soft animal tissues. Lot 130 has a mass of 11.74 grams (g)
and extends 45.57 mm in length by 20.30 mm in width, with a maximum thickness of 10.50 mm.

Unifacially Modified Flakes

Unifacially modified flakes were the most common simple detachment-based tool type recovered
from the site (n = 7). The basic attributes of the unifacially modified flakes are presented in
Appendix H, Table H-4.

Based on wear patterns present in this assemblage, it is probable that these expedient tools were
utilized for multiple activities including cutting, planing, and scraping. A total of 10 modified edges
were identified in the tool assemblage, exhibiting patterned wear consistent with scraping (n = 3),
planing (n = 2), and cutting (n = 5). Scraping and planing utilizes the working edge of the flake at an
approximately 90° angle to the direction of use; however, with planing the working edge is pushed,
Atkins 100018032/120087

158

6. Lithic Analysis
whilst the working edge is pulled during scraping activities (Keeley 1980). Cutting utilizes the flake
edge in a manner that is parallel to the direction of use and is performed on soft to medium-soft
materials, such as soft animal tissues (Keeley 1980).

Utilized Flake

The single bifacially modified flake (Lot 127) is a chert flake fragment that has been utilized along
the concave distal edge. The flake exhibits 4.64 mm of edge wear on the ventral surface and is
consistent with utilization for planing medium-soft materials. Lot 27 has a mass of 3.93 g and
extends 29.52 mm in length by 13.49 mm in width, with a maximum thickness of 10.30 mm.

Core-based and Complex Detachment-based Tools (Figures 38 and 39)

After being categorized as core-based or complex detachment-based, all 181 specimens were then
classified either as biface or nonbiface. Bifaces include all bifacially constructed tools, and within
this assemblage nonbiface refers to all unifaces. Bifaces were the predominant tools in the
assemblage of core-based and complex detachment-based tools (n = 180, 99.5 percent). Both
bifaces and nonbifaces were classified as formal (n = 177, 97.8 percent) or informal (n = 4,
2.2 percent) tools. All formal tools represent a stage in production and suggest a trajectory towards
a recognizable tool type; all informal specimens are expedient in nature and show very little
reduction prior to use. All attribute data for the core-based and complex-detachment based tools
are also presented in Appendix H, Table H-5.

Tool type was recorded based upon morphology and use-wear. In general, the indeterminate tools
were too fragmentary to determine the nature of tool use. Twenty-two indeterminate tools were
incomplete specimens. Only 4 were complete; these 4 specimens were all in the initial stages of
production. Tool types recorded within the assemblage consist of the following: chopper (n = 1),
drill (n = 2), knife (n = 24), perforator (n = 1), planer (n = 4), projectile point (n = 107), and scraper
(n = 16). All specimens are further categorized and described within their respective types below. It
is clear from the collection that the core-based and complex detachment-based tools follow a more
formalized and clear reduction plan.

Chopper

One chert core-based tool, Lot 83, was identified as a chopper (see Figure 38). This specimen is
stage 1 and complete and exhibits convex lateral edges and bifacial unilateral edge construction.
Further use-wear studies, presented in Appendix D, identify that this tool was utilized as a
butchering tool on soft and hard animal tissues. The chopper has a mass of 61.47 g and extends
66.99 mm in length by 38.97 mm in width, with a maximum thickness of 22.66 mm.

Drill
Two formal, complex detachment-based tools in the assemblage were identified as drills, and both
specimens (Lots 104 and 145) retain bases of Gary dart points (see Appendix E, Figures E-1 and
E-7). Both exhibit collateral flake scar patterning, no evidence of alteration, and have indeterminate
reasons for failure/discard. Additional attributes of these materials are illustrated in Table 33. Usewear analysis on these tools, presented in Appendix D, did not identify any utilization along the
distal tips. While the overall form of each of the specimens would indicate use as a drill, there is no
evidence to suggest that these tools were utilized for drilling activities. There is potential that one
or both specimens may have been discarded prior to their intentional use, which is why they
remain in the drill category.

Knife
With the exclusion of projectile points, knives were one of the most prevalent tool types utilized at
the site. A total of 24 specimens were identified in the assemblage (see Figures 38 and 39). Of these
24 specimens, a single tool, Lot 51, was further assigned to the subtype of Harvey-Mineola biface
(see Figure 38). Lot 51 is a complete core-based, stage 4 biface that has a mass of 11.02 g and
extends 35.03 mm in length by 28.51 mm in width with a maximum thickness of 9.09 mm. This
specimen is constructed on a tabular fragment of silicified wood, and the working edge angle/bit
edge is 55°. This tool has convex lateral and distal edges, collateral flake scar patterning, and
unifacial-circumferential edge construction. Wear suggesting utilization as a knife, in the form of
unifacial flaking attrition, occurs bilaterally along the distal edge. As suggested by Turner and
Hester (1999), it is believed that the Harvey-Mineola bifaces, such as this one, date to the Late
Archaic to Late Prehistoric and are common in east and southeast Texas. More specifically, when
compared to the Yarbrough site collection, these biface types represent Group VII, which places this
tool within the Woodland component at the site (Johnson 1962). Use-wear presented in Appendix D
further suggests this tool was used for cutting animal tissue. Eleven specimens analyzed for useAtkins 100018032/120087

wear also showed activities related to butchering and cutting soft and hard animal tissue. Attributes
for the remainder of these materials are illustrated in Appendix J, Table J-3.

Perforator

A single silicified wood perforator (Lot 80) was identified in the collection at 41HS915 (see Figure
39). This tool was identified as a perforator based upon its use-wear alone, presented in more detail
in Appendix D. Use-wear indicated this tool was utilized for piercing and twisting soft animal tissue.
This specimen retains the following attributes: biface, formal, stage 4, proximal fragment, convex
lateral edges, random flake scar patterning, and bifacial-circumferential edge construction. It has a
mass of 5.10 g and extends 27.57 mm in length by 20.97 mm in width with a maximum thickness of
11.99 mm. Reason for discard is indeterminate.

Planer

A total of four specimens in the collection were identified as planers based upon form (see Figure
39). All four specimens are complex detachment-based, bifacial formal tools. Attributes of these
materials are illustrated in Table 34. High-power microscopy did not identify any areas of specific
use on specimens 80, 82, 91, and 116.

Projectile Points

Projectile points were the most common tool type at the site, accounting for over 46 percent of the
overall tool assemblage with a total of 107 specimens. These specimens represent the following
subtype categories: Catahoula arrow point (n = 1), Friley arrow point (n = 1), Ellis dart point
(n = 3), Ensor dart point (n = 1), Gary dart point (n = 75), Godley dart point (n = 1), indeterminate
dart point (n = 6), Morrill dart point (n = 1), and Yarbrough dart point (n = 18). These materials are
further described below within each subtype. All additional metric data for each of the projectile
points not presented below can be located in Appendix H, Table H-6. Included in this table are
metric data recorded for the two drill specimens that retain Gary dart point stems. In addition, a
photographic catalog showing all recovered projectile points is included as Appendix E.

Catahoula Arrow Point

The single Catahoula arrow point (Figure 40, Lot 114) recovered at the site is identified as the
proximal fragment of a stage 4 specimen, which exhibits an impact/bending failure and thermal
alteration. Additional morphological characteristics consist of bifacial-bilateral edge construction,
short base to stem ratio, a straight basal edge, and 70° shoulder angles. This specimen has a mass of
0.53 g and extends 11.95 mm in length by 19.45 mm in width with a maximum thickness of
2.38 mm and a working edge angle of 25°. Expanding-stem arrow points, such as the Catahoula, are
sometimes identified as Alba, Colbert, or Scallorn. What sets this type apart is its large rounded or

squared barbs. It could even be argued that some of the Alba arrow point specimens illustrated
from the Herman Ballew site (Lots 651 and 817) would be more accurately described as Catahoula
arrow points (Roger et al. 2001:49). The same holds true for some of the Colbert arrow points
(specimens “r” and “s”) illustrated from the Resch site (Webb et al. 1969:53). Catahoula arrow
points generally date to the Late Prehistoric between A.D. 700 and 1100 (Turner and Hester 1999),
but as suggested by Rogers et al. (2001), it is believed that Catahoula arrow points were phased out
towards the end of the Woodland period and were likely in use at the same time as Gary dart
points.

Friley Arrow Point

The single Friley arrow point (see Figure 40; Lot 156) recovered at the site is identified as a
complete chert, complex detachment-based stage 5 specimen, which exhibits thermal alteration,
recurved edge morphology, random flake scar patterning, bifacial-bilateral edge construction, a
short base to stem ratio, an expanding stem with a straight basal edge, outflaring shoulders that
project towards the distal end, and 75° shoulder angles. This specimen has a mass of 0.52 g and
extends 18.47 mm in length by 15.28 mm in width with a maximum thickness of 2.07 mm and a 30°
working edge angle. This specimen also exhibits use-wear in the form of unifacial flaking attrition
bilaterally along the distal edge. Friley arrow points generally date to the Late Prehistoric from
A.D. 700 to 1100 and are common in east Texas and Louisiana (Turner and Hester 1999). As with
the Catahoula points, Friley arrow points also are suggested to have been phased out towards the
end of the Woodland period and were likely in use at the same time as Gary dart points (Rogers et
al. 2001).

Ellis Dart Points

All three Ellis dart points recovered at the site are complex detachment-based stage 4 specimens
(see Figure 40). As mentioned previously, there are a variety of attributes these points share,
including triangular-shaped blades, shallow corner notches, expanding stems, bifacial-bilateral
edge construction, short base to stem ration, and convex basal edges. Variations in the attributes
are presented in Table 35.

6. Lithic Analysis
One of these specimens (Lot 87) exhibits use-wear in the form of unifacial flaking attrition along a
single lateral edge. In East Texas, Ellis dart points generally date to the Woodland period between
300 B.C. and A.D. 700 (Turner and Hester 2011). These specimens are likely contemporaneous with
the other expanding-stem-tradition points at the site, such as Ensor and Godley.

Ensor Dart Point

The single Ensor dart point (see Figure 40; Lot 74) recovered at the site is identified as a complete
chert, complex detachment-based stage 5 specimen, which exhibits convex lateral edges, random
flake scar patterning, bifacial-bilateral edge construction, short base to stem ratio, and an
expanding stem create by shallow side notches with a convex basal edge and 55° shoulder angles.
This specimen has a mass of 3.20 g and extends 25.46 mm in length by 17.87 mm in width with a
maximum thickness of 6.57 mm and a 70° edge angle. This specimen also exhibits use-wear in the
form of crushing/smoothing along the distal-lateral edge. Ensor dart points generally date to the
Woodland period from 200 B.C. to A.D. 600 or later and are widespread across central and south
Texas (Suhm et al. 1954; Turner and Hester 2011). As stated previously, this point type is likely
contemporaneous with the other expanding-stem dart points at the site.

Gary Dart Points

Gary dart points are the most common projectile point type recovered at the site, accounting for
approximately 70 percent of the projectile point assemblage. All specimens recovered exhibited
contracting stems and triangular-shaped blades, but as stated previously, much variation occurred
in their morphological characteristics. Each variety applied to the collection is presented in more
detail below and is shown on Figure 41. Included in this discussion are the two drills that retain
Gary dart point stems; therefore, 109 Gary dart points are discussed below. Generally Gary dart
points date to the Late Archaic from 1000 to 300 B.C. and are very common in east Texas and
Louisiana (Turner and Hester 2011). However, based upon comparative data discussed in further
detail below, it is suggested that the majority of the Gary assemblage dates more specifically to the
Woodland period. In addition, similarities should be noted among certain varieties of Gary dart
points and other dart points not identified in the collection. For example, the Emory and Colfax
varieties are similar to Dawson or Kent dart points and even some Woden dart points, with their
more-rectangular expanding stems and straight to slightly convex bases. With Dawson, Kent,
and/or Woden dart points being found at some of the nearby sites such as Resch, Yarbrough, and
Herman Ballew, there is the possibility that one or more of these varieties could be ascribed to one
of the aforementioned types. In addition, it should also be noted that some of the varieties could
potentially be reworked/resharpened versions of other varieties.

Atkins 100018032/120087

6. Lithic Analysis
Gary var. Alsa. Five of the Gary points are assigned to the variety Alsa. These specimens retained
all of most of the following morphological characteristics: overall medium size, crude workmanship,
short triangular stem, triangular blade, heavy weight, and great thickness (Johnson 1962).
Attributes for Alsa variety Gary dart points are presented in Table 36.

Gary var. Colfax. Seven Gary points are assigned to this variety. These specimens retained all or
most of the following characteristics: overall small size, prominent shoulders, short blade, and a
contracting but rather square stem with a flattened base (Johnson 1962). Attributes for the Colfax
variety Gary dart points are presented in Table 37.

Gary var. Emory. Five of the Gary points conform to the variety Emory. These specimens retained
all or most of the following characteristics: overall small size and a long contracting stem with a flat
base (Johnson 1962). Attributes for the Emory variety Gary dart points are presented in Table 38.

Gary var. Hobson. Six Gary points are assigned to the variety Hobson. These specimens retained all
or most of the following characteristics: overall small to medium size, short triangular blade, large
and wide contracting stem, and a rounded base (Johnson 1962). Attributes for the Hobson variety
Gary dart points are presented in Table 39.

Gary var. Kaufman. The Kaufman variety occurred in the greatest frequency at the site, accounting
for a total of 12 specimens. These specimens retained all or most of the following characteristics:
overall medium size, wide triangular blade, prominent shoulders, triangular stem, pointed base,
and careful workmanship (Johnson 1962). Attributes for the Kaufman variety Gary dart points are
presented in Table 40.

Gary var. Kemp. A total of eight specimens were identified as Kemp variety Gary dart points. These
specimens retained all or most of the following characteristics: overall small size, long and narrow
overall outline, long stem, and a pointed base (Johnson 1962). Attributes for the Kemp variety Gary
dart points are presented in Table 41.
Gary var. Kenedy. Five of the Gary points are assigned to the Kenedy variety. These specimens
retained all or most of the following characteristics: overall small size, small triangular stem,
pointed base, very prominent shoulders, and lozenge-shaped outline (Johnson 1962). Attributes for
the Kenedy variety Gary dart points are presented in Table 42.

Gary var. Panna Maria. Nine specimens were identified as Panna Maria variety Gary dart points.
These specimens retained all or most of the following characteristics: overall medium size,
indistinct shoulders, and long and narrow overall outline (Johnson 1962). Attributes for the Panna
Maria variety Gary dart points are presented in Table 43.

Gary var. Runge. Seven Gary points are identified as belonging to the Runge variety. These
specimens retained all or most of the following characteristics: overall medium size, long narrow

stem, and relatively short blade (Johnson 1962). Attributes for the Runge variety Gary dart points
are presented in Table 44.
Indeterminate Gary Variety. A total of 13 Gary dart point specimens were either too fragmentary
and/or early in stage to determine variety. Attributes for these materials are presented in Table 45.

Godley Dart Point

A single Godley dart point (see Figure 40; Lot 82) recovered at the site is identified as a complete
silicified wood, complex detachment-based stage 4 specimen, which exhibits straight lateral edges,
collateral flake scar patterning, bifacial-bilateral edge construction, a long base to stem ratio,
convex basal edge, and 70° shoulder angles. This specimen has a mass of 7.07 g and extends
40.46 mm in length by 21.92 mm in width with a maximum thickness of 8.38 mm and a working
edge angle of 70°. This specimen also exhibits use-wear in the form of bifacial flaking attrition
bilaterally along the distal end and shallow polish along the same distal end. Godley dart points
generally date from the Late Prehistoric to Woodland period and are common in east central Texas
(Turner and Hester 2011). As stated previously, this point type is likely contemporaneous with the
other expanding-stem dart points at the site.

Morrill Dart Point

A single Morrill dart point (see Figure 40; Lot 94) recovered at the site is identified as a complete
chert, complex detachment-based stage 5 specimen, which exhibits straight lateral edges, collateral
flake scar patterning, bifacial-bilateral edge construction, a long base to stem ratio, an expanding
stem with a straight basal edge, and 70° shoulder angles. This specimen has a mass of 8.01 g and
extends 46.28 mm in length by 21.98 mm in width with a maximum thickness of 9.78 mm with a
working edge angle of 65°. This specimen also exhibits use-wear in the form of bifacial polish and
etching/pitting along the medial portion section with additional polish along the proximal section.
Morrill dart points generally date to the Middle Archaic and are common in central east Texas
(Turner and Hester 2011). This specimen is potentially contemporaneous with the other
expanding-stemmed points at the site based upon style alone.

Yarbrough Dart Points

Yarbrough dart points were the second most common projectile point recovered at the site,
accounting for a total of 18 specimens, approximately 17 percent of the overall projectile point
assemblage. All specimens recovered exhibit expanding or parallel stems and slender triangularshaped blades, but as stated previously, some variation occurred in their morphological
characteristics. Each variety applied to the collection is presented in more detail below and shown
on Figure 42. Generally, Yarbrough dart points date to the Late Archaic and are common in east
Texas (Turner and Hester 2011). It is believed that the varieties discovered at 41HS915 represent a

smaller Archaic component that is characterized by slightly expanding and parallel-stemmed dart
points.

Yarbrough var. Dike. A total of three specimens were identified as Dike variety Yarbrough dart
points. These specimens retained all or most of the following characteristics: narrow and long
outline, sharply expanding stem with concave edges, and a flattened base (Johnson 1962).
Attributes for the Dike variety Yarbrough dart points are presented in Table 46.

Yarbrough var. Lindale. The Lindale variety was the most common Yarbrough variety
encountered at 41HS915, accounting for a total of 11 specimens. These specimens retained all or
most of the following characteristics: medium size, slightly expanding stem with straight edges, and
a straight base (Johnson 1962). Attributes for the Lindale variety Yarbrough dart points are
presented in Table 47.

It should be noted that this variety does bear similarity to the Delhi dart point. However, as with the
Godley dart point mentioned earlier, this variety has an expanding stem and relatively straight
basal edge, and the Delhi dart point has a more rectangular stem and slightly convex basal edge (see
Webb 1981). The analyst would even suggest that the point identified by Webb at the Resch site as
a Delhi point (See page 53, specimen “aa”), more closely resembles that of the Yarbrough var.
Lindale than a Delhi point (Webb 1969).
Yarbrough var. Mabank. Only a single Mabank variety point was identified in the Yarbrough
assemblage. This specimen retained all of the following characteristics: medium size, lanceolate
blade, narrow expanding stem, and a markedly concave base (Johnson 1962). The single Mabank
variety Yarbrough dart point has a mass of 8.18 g and extends 41.54 mm in length by 22.25 mm in
width with a maximum thickness of 10.87 mm. This specimen is complete, silicified wood, and
rejuvenated and exhibits straight lateral edges, collateral flake scar patterning, and bifacial-bilateral
edge construction. This specimen also exhibits use-wear in the form of unifacial-unilateral usederived flaking attrition and shallow lateral polish. This specimen was originally identified as an
Edgewood dart point in the interim report, but upon closer examination was deemed to be a
Yarbrough var. Mabank.

Indeterminate Yarbrough Variety. A total of three specimens could not be assigned to a specific
variety due to fragmentary portion and/or level of completion/stage. Attributes for these materials
are presented in Table 48.

Indeterminate Dart Point

A total of six specimens could be identified as dart points, but due to fragmentary nature or level of
completion/stage, the specific type could not be evaluated. Attributes for these materials are
recorded in Table 49.

Scraper
Scrapers were one of the more popular core-based/complex detachment-based tool types
recovered at 41HS915. A total of 16 bifacial specimens were recovered in a variety of shapes and
sizes. Morphological attributes for these specimens are presented in Appendix J, Table J-4. A single
specimen, Lot 82, exhibited use-wear indicating it was utilized briefly for scraping wood. The
remainder of the scrapers were identified based upon morphology alone.

Indeterminate

A total of 26 bifacial tools could not be further categorized by type due to their fragmentary nature,
stage, or lack of use-wear. A variety of morphological attributes are represented within the
indeterminate type, and all such attributes are presented in Table 50.

Specimens Submitted for High Power Microscopy

A total of 80 complex detachment-based and core-based tools were submitted to a technical analyst
for high-power microscopy. In addition, 101 projectile points were submitted for the same analysis.
Of these materials, the analyst narrowed the sample down to a total of 80 specimens (39 Gary dart
points and 41 complex detachment-based and core-based tools), eliminating specimens of
metaquartize or other crystalline raw materials and cobble fragments with no visible wear at low
magnification. A complete analysis of these materials is presented in Appendix D.

While the purpose for use-wear of nonprojectile point tools may appear self-evident, reasoning for
use-wear studies on Gary dart points is more complex. One can imagine that most dart points
would show evidence of use as a projectile point, and perhaps the occasional secondary use. This
particular assemblage of Gary dart points, which has Johnson’s (1962) varieties applied, provides
an opportunity to look for use-wear patterns in the varieties that may show specific uses, a pattern
of reworking/resharpening, and even patterns suggesting certain varieties to be preforms.

A total of 39 Gary dart points were analyzed. Of these materials, 1 was identified as a hafted
butchering tool, 9 were identified as unused preforms, 26 were utilized as projectile points, 1
complete dart point was unused, 1 is the unused proximal fragment of a larger dart point, and 1 has
an unknown use prior to fracture. In addition, 5 of the specimens utilized as projectile points also
showed evidence of wear indicative of other activities such as cutting soft tissues and skin-working.
Unfortunately, while the use-wear indicated additional activities, there are no patterns with regard
to the varieties, as can be seen in Appendix D, Table D-1. In regard to rejuvenated specimens, three
varieties (Colfax, Emory, and Kemp) show a higher likelihood for being reworked. The only flaw
with this extrapolation is that some varieties in the collection, such as Alsa, Hobson, Kemp, Panna
Maria, and Runge, are dominated by material types that were not analyzed. The single variety most
likely to be identified as a preform is Panna Maria. With the majority of the specimens analyzed for

6. Lithic Analysis
use-wear, and overall in the collection being identified as preforms, one can conclude that this
particular variety may actually represent a preform to another variety.

Summary

Prior to the site’s mitigation, it was determined that the site possessed little or no stratigraphic
integrity. However, the recovery of such a large lithic assemblage did allow for adequate
comparison to the data from the aforementioned sites. In the absence of more-detailed analysis of
the lithic nontool assemblage, no attempt was made to assign these materials to any one
component.

Utilizing these comparative data, it is suggested that the lithic tool assemblage represents two
distinct occupations at the site: one smaller Archaic component, represented by slightly expandingstemmed to parallel-stemmed dart points such as Yarbrough and Morrill and the Alsa variety Gary
dart point; and the larger, more-prevalent Woodland component, represented by the remainder of
the Gary varieties, the expanding-stemmed Ellis, Ensor, and Godley dart points, the Friley and
Catahoula arrow points, and the Harvey-Mineola biface. It should also be noted that use-wear
studies conducted on the Harvey-Mineola biface (presented in Appendix D) may have shed some
light on the utilization of bifaces of this type. Microscopic examination of material identified that it
was used for cutting soft animal tissue. While this is only a single specimen, perhaps this
identification can lead to future studies on use-wear of Harvey-Mineola bifaces.
With a Woodland occupation, it could be expected that Bristol bifaces, Bronson bifaces, and/or
Gossett unifaces would be recovered. There was only one uniface recovered in the entire
assemblage, Lot 94, and this specimen does not resemble a Gossett uniface. With regard to the
Bristol biface, it can be noted that the following specimens resemble this subtype, but all such
specimens are early in reduction stage and cannot be confidently assigned to the subtype of
Bronson biface: Lot 80, silicified wood scraper (see Figure 39); Lot 114, Chert scraper (see Figure
39); and Lot 132, silicified wood indeterminate biface (see Appendix D, Figure D-3).The same can
be noted for the Bronson biface. Both silicified wood knives from Lot 100 are very similar to
Bronson bifaces (see Figure 38).

While Johnson’s (1962) Gary varieties were employed with this collection, it is important to
consider the similarities with those utilized by Schambach at the Cooper and Means sites
(Schambach 1998). Schambach identifies six varieties of Gary consisting of Gary, Malvern, Le Flore,
Bodcaw, Manice, and Camden. The correlations drawn by the analyst between Schambach’s and
Johnson’s varieties are illustrated in Table 51.

The Archaic collection is very similar to Johnson’s Period 2, which is marked by the expanding-stem
tradition. Johnson does not include any Gary varieties in his Period 2, but he does identify this
period as being entirely preceramic (Johnson 1962). Schambach describes the Gary variety Gary
dart point as being entirely preceramic, and based upon the similarities drawn between the Gary
and Alsa varieties, it is suggested that the Alsa variety be placed within the preceramic or Archaic
component (Schambach 1998). The Gary variety is presented as the earliest of the Gary dart points,
which date to between the Archaic and ceramic periods, and is marked as a larger example with a
very wide stem. It is suggested that these points are most similar to Johnson’s Alsa variety, due to
the broad width of the stems. This suggestion would place the Alsa variety points at 41HS915
toward the latter end of the Archaic occupation at the site.
The Woodland component assemblage is very similar to Johnson’s Periods 4 and 5, which are
marked by an abundance of contracting-stemmed points (namely the remainder of the Gary
varieties), the appearance of the arrow point, although infrequent, and bifacial tools such as the
Harvey-Mineola knife (Johnson 1962). While a small amount of overlap from the Archaic tradition
is not uncommon, the Archaic materials are believed to phase out as the popularity of contractingstemmed points rises. The Woodland component lithic assemblage is similar to Schambach’s Lost
Bayou, Oak Grove, and Dutchman’s Garden phases (Schambach 1998). The Lost Bayou phase shows a
high presence of Gary var. Leflore, Bodcaw, and Manice with some Gary var. Malvern; the Oak Grove
phase shows a high presence of Gary var. Camden with some overlap of Gary var. Leflore, Bodcaw,
and Manice; and the Dutchman’s Garden phase see the same dart point assemblage as the Oak Grove

phase, but sees the introduction of arrow points, such as Scallorn and Alba (Schambach 1998). Due
to the overlap between point varieties in both Schambach’s and Johnson’s periods/phases, the
materials from 41HS915 are presented simply as Woodland. It is likely that the Kaufman-Camden
varieties represent a later tradition than the other varieties, as these materials arrive only in the
later Oak Grove and Dutchman’s Garden phases (Schambach 1998).

It can be said, however, that the arrow points recovered likely represent the later periods/phases,
such as Schambach’s Dutchman’s Garden phase. While Catahoula arrow points were not identified
in collections from the Yarbrough and Miller sites (Johnson 1962), the Cooper and Means sites
(Schambach 1998), and the Herman Ballew site (Rogers et al. 2001), and Friley arrow points were
only present at the Herman Ballew site, they could align with the end of the Woodland period or be
associated with subsequent Caddo culture. It is quite likely that there was some overlap with use of
these arrow points, and some of the later Gary varieties. Also, as stated previously, it can be argued
that some points identified as Alba at Herman Ballew’s (Rogers et al. 2001) and Colbert at the Resch
site (Webb 1969) should be identified as Catahoula arrow points.

In conclusion, the lithic assemblage at 41HS915 aligns primarily with the Woodland period, though
some Archaic and possibly Caddo elements are also present. The lithic assemblage suggests
activities related primarily to tool manufacture and maintenance and animal processing. Only a
single chipped stone, the Lot 82 drill, showed limited and brief utilization for plant processing, and
in contrast, the remainder of the materials recovered suggest hunting and subsequent processing of
animals. This is evidenced by the large projectile point assemblage and the additional chipped stone
tools, which show use-wear indicative of cutting, sawing, planing, and scraping of both soft and
hard animal tissues.

Ground, Battered, and Polished Stone Tools

Forty-one ground, polished, and battered stone tools were recovered from the Hawkwind site (see
Appendix H, Table H-7). Many of the stones are weathered; however, based on microscopic
examination, the 41 tools could be assigned to 10 morphological (functional) categories: Abrader
(n = 6), pitted anvil stone (n = 8), pitted mano (n = 3), mano/abrader (n= 1), mano fragments
(n = 5), hammerstone/mano (n = 1), knife/abrader (n = 1), celt/adze (n = 1), paint pallet (n = 3),
and polishing stone (n = 2). Ten indeterminate grinding stones were also recovered. These 10
stones include either broken fragments from larger tools or small stones that exhibit wear patterns
that could not confidently be assigned to a particular functional category.

Among the 41 ground, battered, and polished stone tools, six raw material types were observed
(Table 52). Stones made from hematite (n = 6) or hematitic sandstone (n = 17) are, by far, the most
common, with 56 percent of the tools being made from these materials.

Recognizing the range of use-related activities associated with any particular tool can be difficult;
however, certain key attributes aid in identifying the different actions (or processes) and the range
of materials that produced the distinctive wear found on specific tools. Examination under 10x
power binocular magnification revealed the presence of eight types of wear, with more than one
type of wear usually occurring on the same tool. The observed wear types included grinding,
pecking, polishing, pitting, battering, grooves, notches, and striations.

Among the tools that could be assigned a morphological (functional) category, 16 were classified as
lower anvil stones, or the tool that absorbs the pressure of pounding and rubbing (see Carter 1977;
Kraybill 1977). Fifteen were classified as upper hand-held stones, and most of the 10 indeterminate
grinding stones also appear to be upper stones. These are the stones that are the most easily
manipulated and supply pressure during the two primary mechanical operations of pounding and
rubbing (see Carter 1977; Kraybill 1977). As with all classification systems, there are always those
tools that could easily fit into more than one morphological category. For example, the
knife/abrader (Specimen 148.1) recovered at the site was a multipurpose tool. Its wear patterns
indicate that it was used as both a lower stone that absorbed abrasive pressure, and as an upper
stone that supplied the pressure of rubbing or sawing. Because any specific tool can be used in a
range of activities, this analysis categorized multifunctional tools on the basis of the predominant
type of wear still visible on the tool. Thus, the knife/abrader was classified as an upper stone.

Lower Anvil Stones (n = 17)

On the basis of microscopic examination, the 17 lower anvil stones or stone fragments were
assigned to three functional categories: pitted anvil stone (n = 8), paint pallet (n = 3), and abrader
(n = 6).

Pitted Anvil Stones (n = 8)

The eight pitted anvil stones recovered at the site are platform stones that exhibit one or more
cupped depressions indicating a distinctive grinding and/or pounding operation. They range in size
Atkins 100018032/120087

192

6. Lithic Analysis
from large stationary platforms (Figure 43) to those that are small enough to be held in the hand.
All but two of the pitted anvil stones exhibit wear on multiple surfaces (Table 53), and most exhibit
jagged and irregular pitted areas, suggesting forceful areas of impact (such as dehulling nuts).

Specimen 114.1, a fragment of a much larger anvil stone, suggests a different use-related wear
pattern (see Figure 43). The remaining portion of the tool is plano-convex in profile and exhibits
wear on both surfaces. The flat face is ground and polished. On the convex side, pitted areas appear
as small, shallow dimples or relatively deep depressions with smoothly ground edges, rather than
deep, conical-shaped pits with jagged edges. Intensive grinding has smoothed and polished the
surface surrounding the pits, and polish extends into the pit areas. This suggests a circular motion
that was intended to crush or reduce mass rather than pulverize it. The highly polished, relatively
smooth edges of the pits suggest rubbing or grinding rather than pounding (such as reducing the
mass of nut kernels).

Paint Pallet (n = 3)

Three of the smaller anvil stones are heavily stained with ocher and appear to have been used as
pallets for grinding and mixing pigments. Specimen 79.1 is an irregular-shaped stone of hematitic
sandstone. A thick layer of ochre coats one of its surfaces (Figure 44).

Two of the stones are made of limonite, a raw material choice that would also have incorporated
the natural pigments in the stone into the mixing process. Specimen 118.2 is a small corner
fragment with a thick stain of red ochre on one surface. Specimen 113.1 is a roughly rectangular
stone that is bi-plano in profile (see Figure 44). Grinding has worn a wide basin-shaped depression
in one face. A heavy coating of yellow ochre fills the basin and extends over the edge of the basin.
Patches of red ochre are visible in several areas.

Abraders (n = 6)

All of the tools assigned to this category have at least one or more grooves cut into their surfaces.
All are relatively small, tabular fragments composed of rather distinct varieties of silicified wood
that have unusually large quartz crystals embedded in the silicified layers. On most, the crystals are
fairly large, clearly visible, and distributed over the working face of the tool. Intensive grinding and
abrasive wear has caused differential wear in the large quartz inclusions layered between the
lamina. For example, on Specimens 103.1 and 118.1 (see Figure 44), the tool has been so
thoroughly ground that nearly all traces of the quartz crystal layers have been obliterated, while on
Specimen 115.1 the crystals are only partially obliterated (see Figure 44).

6. Lithic Analysis
In general, the wear noted on these six tools resulted from the abrasive use of the stone to grind,
smooth, shape, or sharpen a variety of implements such as grinding the base of a projectile point,
straightening and polishing an arrow shaft, and/or sharpening the tip of a bone awl. Although they
are all small enough to comfortably be held in the hand, functionally they all serve as stationary
platforms that absorb the pressure of rubbing.

Upper Hand Stones (n = 14)

The Hawkwind ground stone assemblage includes 14 upper hand-held stones. On the basis of
microscopic examination, the stones were assigned to seven functional categories: pitted mano,
mano/abrader, mano fragments, hammerstone/mano, knife/abrader, celt, and polishing stone.

Pitted Mano (n = 3)

In addition to evidence for generalized grinding, the stones in this category also have pitted areas
on at least one surface. The shape of the stone and the depth of the pits vary in overall appearance.
On two stones, the pitted areas appear as shallow indentations with rough edges. Specimen 60.1 is
a globular-shaped stone with wear on multiple surfaces. It is plano-convex in cross section and has
well-worn flake scars making it easier to grip its irregular shape. A smooth shallow depression is
situated on both the flat surface and the convex face. The tool has weathered, but patches of
grinding are still visible on the high-relief areas. Microscopic examination of these ground patches
shows the high-relief grains to be flattened and opaque, with the interstices between the grains
obliterated giving the surfaces a mottled appearance. This wear pattern suggests that the
substance(s) being ground was relatively hard.

Specimen 117.1 is a small oval-shaped mano (see Figure 44). The tool is bi-plano in profile and
encircled by wide, thick, and well-used edges. Two flake scars situated on the end of the tool
suggest intentional shaping to create comfortable finger holds. The location of the finger holds
would have made it easy to reposition the tool in order to take advantage of different areas of the
working surfaces. Not surprisingly, heavy battering occurs on the edges opposite the finger holds.
Along another 46-mm section of its wide edge, grinding has flattened the area and patches of polish
are still visible. Intensive grinding has flattened both faces. A shallow, polished depression is
located roughly in the center of one plane surface. Heavy grinding in this area has obliterated the
interstices between the grains, leaving highly polished areas. This type of wear suggests that the
substance(s) being ground was relatively hard, with repeated grinding having produced a heavy
buildup of debris.

Specimen 63.2 has a smooth shallow depression located roughly in the center of the stone (see
Figure 44). A thick coating of ochre fills the depression, spreads over the entire surface, and even
coats portions of the sides, suggesting that the primary use of this stone was to pound and grind
ochre nodules.
Atkins 100018032/120087

Hawkwind Site (41HS915)

Mano Fragments (n = 5)
Five mano fragments were recovered at the site. As a group, these five fragments are relatively
diverse. Two of them (Specimens 91.1 and 125.1) are thin, transverse slices from much larger
stones. One end fragment and one corner fragment are heavily eroded with only patches of wear
still visible. The only stone that exhibits distinctive wear is Specimen 86.1 (see Figure 44). This
metaquartzite stone is the corner fragment of a large wedge-shaped mano. A shallow, polished
depression along one side appears to be a well-worn finger hold. The stone is highly polished, and
faint striations are randomly distributed across its remaining surfaces. The polish occurs on the
high-relief areas and between the interstices; however, there is little micro-fracturing of the
interstices between the grains, which suggests that this stone was probably used to grind softer
vegetal material such as fruits or nutmeats or was used in tandem with a softer grinding platform
such as a basket (see Smith 1986). This type of sheen could also result from adding water during
the grinding process (see Kraybill 1977).

Manos/Abrader (n = 1)

Specimen 126.1 is a large multipurpose tool (see Figure 44). It is plano-convex in profile and
exhibits wear on multiple surfaces. On the convex side of the tool, the wear patterns vary. One half
of its rounded surface has three distinct ground, pecked, and polished areas located on both ends
and along the side. The other half of this surface has remnant patches of grinding that give this half
of the tool a frosted appearance due to the scratches and cracks created by surface fatigue and
abrasive wear. The presence of peck marks on both sides indicates an attempt to rejuvenate the
surface in order to maintain grinding efficiency (see Adams 1988). Battering occurs around the
sides and on the ends of the tool. Its opposite flat surface is also battered, and a series of
lengthwise-running grooves covers most of this face. The wear patterns on this tool suggest that in
addition to generalized pounding, its flat face was used as an abrader and its convex surface was
used for grinding relatively hard substances.

Hammerstone/Mano (n = 1)

This irregular-shaped fragment represents the end and the edge of a small tool (Lot 94.1). Remnant
portions of its ground and polished surface are still visible around the edges of the stone, while the
end is heavily battered.

Celt/Adze (n = 1)

Specimen 118.3 is a hematite celt/adze that measures roughly 123 mm in length by 68 mm in width
and is 24 mm thick (see Figure 44). This tool exhibits multiple wear patterns that point to its use in
grinding, pounding, and cutting activities. Its attributes suggest that it may have begun its use-life
serving as a celt in one capacity and subsequently functioned in another. It is plano-convex in
profile. Heavy grinding has polished its rounded sides and both surfaces. Multidirectional striations
Atkins 100018032/120087

198

6. Lithic Analysis
cover both faces and are visible even with the naked eye. Its unifacially beveled working end
measures 63 mm. A series of shallow notches occurs along this edge, and a single flake scar
emanates from the working edge onto the flat side of the tool. Opposite the cutting edge, the tool
ends abruptly in a flat edge. On the convex side of the tool near the flat edge is a fan-shaped
depression that extends approximately 24 mm up onto the convex area. There is a slight depression
on the opposite face that suggests that the tool may have been hafted on this end. The wear on this
tool suggests that it was probably used to cut and process different types of materials.

Knife/Abrader (n = 1)

Specimen 148.1 is a wedge-shaped segment of silicified wood that appears to have been used
primarily as a knife, the tip of which is missing (see Figure 44). Based on overall coloration of the
petrified wood lamina and the color and size of the remaining quartz crystals, this tool closely
resembles those in the abraders category discussed above. Heavy use in the form of grinding and
abrasion has nearly obliterated the quartz grains embedded in both sides, and notches occur along
the pointed edge. A few patches of polish are visible in the grooves on one side, suggesting use on a
soft material such as wood.

Polishing Stone (n = 2)

Fragments of two small polishing stones were also recovered. Specimen 80.2 is approximately half
of an oval-shaped metaquartzite pebble that exhibits ground and polished areas on multiple
surfaces. Rejuvenation of the working surfaces is indicated by the peck marks dotting its surfaces.

Specimen 100.1 is an irregular-shaped fragment of chert that has split laterally leaving only one flat
face and the remnants of its edges. Similar to the other polishing stone, it exhibits ground and
polished areas on its flat face and rounded edges.

Both ethnographic and archeological evidence suggest that these small, smooth stones were often
elements in potters’ tool kits (see Cosgrove and Cosgrove 1932; Price and Griffin 1979; University
of Arizona 2007). However, both tools are too fragmented and the wear patterns still visible on
each tool suggest that they could have been used in a range of activities.

Summary

The ground stone assemblage found at the Hawkwind site included an array of stationary
anvil/platform stones and upper hand-held stones. Their general morphology and associated wear
patterns point to their use in a diverse range of activities such as food processing, tool
manufacturing and maintenance, woodworking, and the pounding and grinding of nonfood
substances such as ochre. As such, the ground, battered, and polished stone tools recovered at the
site provide a unique opportunity to link artifacts with actual resource utilization at the site.
Atkins 100018032/120087

199

Hawkwind Site (41HS915)
First, the recovered tools provide a direct link to the plant resources actually being used at the site.
In general, the wear patterns preserved on the various tools point to the processing of both hard
and soft vegetal material. For example, the presence of a large number of pitted anvil stones with
relatively jagged, uneven pitting (n = 7), the two pitted manos, and other tools exhibiting
battered/pitted areas point to an emphasis on foods processed by pounding (such as nuts or
tubers) rather than milling. This assumption is further supported by Leslie Bush’s macrobotanical
analysis presented in Appendix A, which identified nutshell as being more common even than wood
charcoal (2.45 g; 332 fragments). Thick-shelled hickory was the most common nut resource
represented, and it was present in all submitted samples. Black walnut (one sample) and acorn (five
samples) were also recovered. The presence of large quantities of nutshell also has seasonality
implications, suggesting that at least some of the occupations at the Hawkwind site occurred during
the fall and/or winter months.
Second, grinding of nonplant substances also occurred at the site. For example, the grinding and
mixing of pigments is evidenced by the presence of the three heavily stained paint pallets and seven
other tools with patches of red and/or yellow ochre staining. This is also supported by the 61 ochre
nodules collected at the site and the large percentage of those that exhibit obvious modifications
(Table 54).
Finally, a number of nonfood-related activities are also indicated. The six abraders, the knife/
abrader, the mano/abrader, the celt/adze, and the polishing stones point to the manufacture and
maintenance of a variety of wood, stone, and/or possibly bone implements.

In summary, information gained from the analysis of these 41 ground, battered, and polished stone
tools add an interesting dimension to our understanding of the activities carried out at the
Hawkwind site.

Modified Ochre

The term “ochre” is loosely applied to a geochemically and mineralogically complex suite of earth
materials suitable for use as pigments. Its use as a pigment was widespread prehistorically, and
red-pigmented artifacts are frequently recovered at sites throughout Texas (e.g., Highley et al.
1978:170; Perttula 1992:192, 2012; see also Ellis et al. 1997 for a more-detailed discussion). Ochre
nodules (e.g., Ellis 2009:333; Lukowski 1988:72) and bars of ochre (Pearce and Jackson 1933:55–
56) have also been recovered from sites. Pearce and Jackson (1933:55) suggest that the linear
striations may result from wear associated with use of a fiber brush.

Sixty-one fragments of ochre were recovered at the Hawkwind site (see Table 54). Among those,
75 percent (n = 46) exhibited obvious signs of modification. The striations, grooves, and modified
edges observed on these 46 fragments point to their use as a source of pigment. This assumption is
also supported by the paint pallets and other ground stone tools recovered at the site that have
ochre staining.

Thermally Altered Rock
A substantial amount of burned and thermally altered rocks (TAR) was recovered at the Hawkwind
site. Thermally altered rock specimens were identified by the presence of at least one of the
following characteristics: increased luster and/or color change associated with heat alteration
and/or fracture patterns consistent with heat alteration. While a total of 91 specimens of TAR were
collected and subsequently analyzed, the majority of the TAR recovered at the site was counted,
weighed, and discarded in the field. A total of 989 specimens with a total of mass of
81.721 kilograms were recorded in the field but not collected, and raw material was not recorded
for these materials. With the majority of the collection being discarded in the field, it is difficult to
discern the use of these materials. In addition, while no cultural features were observed at the site,
the abundance of TAR recovered suggests the presence of burned rock features. A total of
2,031.01 g (n = 76) of TAR was collected, and the remaining fragments were recovered from
flotation (n = 15; 33.15 g) (Table 55). Raw material types represented in the assemblage include
chert, silicified wood, hematite, hematitic sandstone, and two varieties of quartzite—metaquartzite
and quartz arenite. The predominant types appear to be metaquartzite, quartz arenite, or silicified
wood.

SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS
by Linda W. Ellis and Robert Rogers
SUMMARY OF THE DATA RECOVERY
Between August 9 and September 19, 2009, Atkins conducted data recovery operations at the
Hawkwind site under Texas Antiquities Permit No. 5356. The field effort included mechanical and
manual unit excavation within a single excavation block located between the channels of Potter’s
Creek and Potter’s Relief, south of the FM 2625 fill section. Mechanical excavation was conducted
with a Gradall equipped with a 60-inch-wide bucket. Fill that was slated to be screened was passed
through a Precision Farm Machinery Series 70-20 Screening Bucket affixed to a Bobcat Skid Steer
Loader. The use of mechanical excavation equipment and a motorized screen at Hawkwind was a
strategy that was aimed at maximizing data return at a relatively low-density, poorly stratified
archeological site while avoiding the cost and time consumption associated with traditional
excavation methods.

As per the stipulations provided in the Scope of Work written for the data recovery fieldwork,
(PBS&J 2009), unit excavation initially was divided into three broad levels. The first level included
modern overburden or disturbed natural sediments to a depth of roughly 15 cmbs. The second
level extended from 15 cmbs (or the base of modern overburden, if deeper) to 60 cmbs. The
sediments in this level were mechanically screened in only six of the units in order to obtain a
screened artifact sample from the base of disturbed sediment to the base of the excavation block. In
the remaining block units, a grab sample was collected. The third level extended from 60 cmbs to a
depth of 140 cmbs (if possible). All of the sediments recovered from block units in this level were
mechanically screened. Seven units (1–6 and 9) were excavated in this manner. Later in discussions
with TxDOT representatives, it was agreed to end unit excavation at 120 cmbs and to split Level 3
into Levels 3 (60–90 cmbs) and 4 (90–120 cmbs) in an effort to separate a zone of higher artifact
densities (between 60 and 90 cmbs as noted in Units 1–6) from lower artifact densities below
90 cmbs. Thus, the other 17 units that were completed during the field efforts were excavated in
four levels. Atkins archeologists completed 24 of the 30 units, or about 80 ft (24 m) of the originally
proposed 100-ft (30-m)-long excavation block. Approximately 139 m3 of fill was removed from the
excavation block during data recovery operations at the site. Roughly 123 m3 of sediment was
mechanically excavated and 66 m3 of fill was mechanically screened.

RESULTS OF DATA RECOVERY INVESTIGATIONS
Organic remains recovered from the site included both charred botanical material and faunal
specimens. Eleven samples recovered from two flotation sample columns were submitted for
identification and analysis of macrobotanical remains. Ninety-six liters of soil matrix was processed
and analyzed. A total of 151 fragments of wood charcoal weighing 0.95 g were recovered from the
Hawkwind site. Several taxa were noted, including pine, oak, and holly or yaupon. Nutshell was
more common than wood charcoal on the site, with a total of 2.45 g (332 fragments) recovered.
Thick-shelled hickory was the most common nut resource represented, and it was present in all 11
samples. Black walnut (1 sample) and acorn (5 samples) were also recovered. Seeds of croton and
dewberry and pine needles were recovered in the flotation samples; however, these plant taxa were
also found in uncarbonized form on the site. They may represent recent burning in the area rather
than ancient plant use.

Sixty-three faunal specimens were recovered during investigations at the site; however, the
condition of preservation is very poor. The assemblage exhibits extensive erosion and calcification,
as well as burning and postdepositional breakage. A total of 34 specimens (54 percent) could not be
identified at any taxonomic level. The remaining 29 fragments (46 percent) include 26 mammalian
fragments and 3 reptile (turtle) fragments.

Atkins archeologists collected 3,770 artifacts during the data recovery effort at the site. Six
additional tools recovered during NRHP testing were also included in the analyses done for this
report. Included in this total are 157 prehistoric ceramic sherds, 7 burned clay pieces, 2 raw clay
samples, and 61 ochre pieces, many of which had been modified. The lithic assemblage includes 41
ground stone tools, 88 cores, and 3,165 pieces of unmodified debitage. The chipped stone tools
numbered 190 (this number includes the tools recovered during NRHP testing) and comprised 9
simple detachment-based tools (1 bifacially modified flake, 7 unifacially modified flakes, and 1
utilized flake), and 181 core-based and complex detachment-based tools. Within this assemblage
were 1 chopper, 2 drills, 24 knives, 1 perforator, 4 planers, and 16 scrapers. The chipped stone tool
assemblage also included 107 projectile points consisting of single specimens of Catahoula and
Friley arrow points, and dart points of the types Gary (77), Yarbrough (18), Ellis (3), Ensor (1),
Godley (1), and Morrill (1). Six typologically indeterminate dart points were also recovered.
Raw materials recognized in the analyzed chipped stone assemblage sample include chert,
metaquartzite, novaculite, quartz, quartz arenite, silicified wood, and tuff. Very clearly, chert was
the predominant choice for tool production at the site.
Microwear analysis of a selected sample of 181 chipped stone tools was performed by Marilyn
Shoberg at The University of Texas. The sample included 80 core-based complex and detachmentbased tools and 101 projectile points. All 80 lithic tools in the sample were scanned at a
magnification of 10X, and notes were made on tool form, visible polish, edge flaking, or probable

7. Summary and Conclusions
areas of wear. The sample for high magnification microwear analysis was reduced by the
elimination of projectile point fragments, artifacts of metaquartzite or other crystalline raw
materials, and cobble fragments with no visible wear at low magnification. Forty-one tools from the
tool category were selected for high magnification microwear analysis.

Among the 41 core-based complex and detachment-based tools from this sample, 16 were
determined to have been used, and 25 were determined not to have been used. Fourteen of the
tools with use-wear were used in butchering or cutting animal tissue. All 14 have evidence of
cutting animal tissue, and 7 of the 14 have clear evidence of contact with hard tissue as well. A
butchering tool has evidence for both soft and hard tissue contact. Artifact 88-54 (1) (see Figure
D-20 in Appendix D), a small rectangular tool of silicified wood, is the most well-used butchering
tool in this assemblage.

Also found among these 80 core-based complex and detachment-based tools is a group of 8 tools
that are roughly triangular in outline and made of silicified wood. They all taper to a rounded,
thinned point at one end and are truncated by a transverse fracture at the thicker end. Most have an
axial ridge on one face and are relatively flat on the other. Seven of the eight are unused, and the tip
of one was used to cut animal tissue. It is possible that they were the proximal ends of larger tools
since transverse fractures are the natural breakage pattern of the raw material. It is possible to
distinguish polish on other tools of silicified wood, but the lack of use-wear evidence on this group
is a mystery (see Appendix D).

While there is some animal food processing reflected in the stone tool assemblage, Shoberg believes
that manufacturing and retooling were primary activities at the Hawkwind site. Eight of the 41
tools examined are manufacturing failures or discards, and 7 were judged to be performs, so that
altogether 15 artifacts were discarded at some point in the manufacturing process.

The microwear analysis of projectile points concentrated on the 77 Gary dart points in the
assemblage. All 77 points were scanned at a magnification of 10X for evidence of microwear, and
sorted into categories by raw material. The raw material types noted were chert, novaculite,
silicified wood, metaquartzite, quartz, and quartz arenite. The points made of silicified wood,
metaquartzite, quartz, and quartz arenite have highly reflective crystalline surfaces and were
judged unsuitable for microwear analysis since it is extremely difficult to visually distinguish
microwear polish from the crystalline facets in the raw material. Thus, only 39 of the 77 Gary points
(those made of chert or novaculite) were analyzed at high magnification for microwear attributes.

Of the 39 Gary dart points analyzed, 9 are judged to be probable preforms and showed no evidence
of use. Of the remaining 29 dart points, 26 were used as projectile points. This determination was
made primarily on the presence of impact fractures, evidence of reshaping or resharpening, and
size, particularly the ratio of body length to stem length. Only 2 of the 26 points have clear
microscopic evidence of impact striations in polish on the axial ridge. One of the remaining 3 dart

points is a complete point, apparently unused. One dart point is the proximal fragment of a large
point, and the cause of the fracture was unclear. Four of the dart points were also used as cutting
tools on soft animal tissue. One of the tools, judged to be a hand-held biface (Lot 125; Figure D-47 in
Appendix D), had been used as a butchering tool.

During the high magnification analysis of one of the Gary dart points (Lot 128; Figure D-48 in
Appendix D), Shoberg detected a black residue on the stem that appeared to be pitch or mastic. The
specimen was submitted to Mary Malainey of the Department of Anthropology at Brandon
University, Manitoba, Canada, for residue analysis. Also submitted was a sample of asphaltum
collected from the Texas coast provided by TxDOT archeologist Dr. James Abbott. Asphaltum is
known to have been used by native peoples as a hafting material. The practice of using asphaltum
as a hafting glue became common in Late Archaic times after around 1000 B.C. Substantial
quantities of this material were sometimes carried inland (Calhoun 1964). Residue identifications
were based on fatty acid decomposition patterns of experimental residues, lipid distribution
patterns, and the presence of biomarkers. Trace amounts of anthracene, which is a major
component of asphaltum, were confirmed in the biface residue; however, other components of
asphaltum were probably masked by food lipids. Animal sterol cholesterol occurs in the residue,
but because the level of C18:0 is quite low, it is unlikely that a large herbivore, such as a bison or
deer, was the source. The level of medium chain fatty acids approaches 10 percent and the level of
the very long chain saturated fatty acid C20:0 is elevated, which suggests the presence of plant
products. Thus, the resin found on this tool suggests a mastic recipe that included animal fat and
plant resins with an asphaltum binder (see Appendix F).

The ground stone assemblage included an array of stationary anvil/platform stones and upper
hand-held stones. Their general morphology and associated wear patterns point to their use in a
diverse range of activities such as food processing, tool manufacturing and maintenance,
woodworking, and the pounding and grinding of nonfood substances such as ochre for use as
pigment. In general, the wear patterns preserved on the various tools point to the processing of
both hard and soft vegetal material. The presence of a large number of pitted anvil stones with
relatively jagged, uneven pitting (n = 7), the two pitted manos, and other tools exhibiting
battered/pitted areas points to an emphasis on foods processed by pounding (such as nuts or
tubers) rather than milling. This assumption is further supported by results of the macrobotanical
analysis that identified nutshell as being more common even than wood charcoal. Thick-shelled
hickory was the most common nut resource represented. Black walnut (one sample) and acorn
(five samples) were also recovered.
A number of nonfood-related activities are also indicated. The recovery of six abraders, a
knife/abrader, a mano/abrader, and a celt/adze point to the manufacture and maintenance of a
variety of wood, stone, and/or possibly bone implements.

7. Summary and Conclusions
One-hundred sixty-six ceramic artifacts were recovered from the site during data recovery. Within
this assemblage are 157 sherds, 7 burned clay fragments, and 2 raw clay fragments. The analysis of
the ceramic assemblage constitutes a major part of this report and served to address three of the
Research Topics discussed below.

The primary research objective of the ceramic analysis was to expand our knowledge of Woodland
period ceramics in the Mill Creek culture area of East Texas and to assess how the ceramics from
the Hawkwind site compared to other known sites in the Sabine River basin. Variations in ceramic
assemblages and other site differences suggest that a distinct cultural pattern existed in the Mill
Creek culture area of East Texas. Sorting out the spatial and temporal implications of these
variations will take consistent and detailed analyses of ceramic attributes from well-excavated
ceramic-bearing Woodland sites. With this in mind, this report compares the Hawkwind site
assemblage to the ceramic assemblages from three key sites located within the Sabine River
drainage basin of the Mill Creek culture area: the Resch (41HS16), Folly (41RK26), and Herman
Ballew (41RK222) sites. All of these sites have been the focus of extensive archeological
investigations, and their distinctive assemblage variations set them apart from similarly aged sites
in the Fourche Maline and Mossy Grove areas (Ellis et al. 2012; Jarvis 1972; Rogers et al. 2001;
Webb et al. 1969). All are located in the middle Sabine basin within a 40–60-km radius of each
other. Thus, they provided an excellent opportunity to not only compare early ceramic assemblages
from known sites but to expand our database of technological and decorative attributes associated
with Woodland period sites in East Texas.
The ceramic study began with a detailed technological and decorative analysis of the ceramics
recovered at the Hawkwind site. This was followed by a reanalysis of a sample of the ceramics
recovered at the Resch site and an analysis of the entire Folly site ceramic assemblage. Following
this, comparisons were made between the Hawkwind ceramic assemblage and the assemblages
found at the Resch, Folly, and Herman Ballew sites. Results of the comparisons indicate definite
technological similarities, but there are also a number of differences. In many cases, however, these
differences are more quantitative than qualitative in that the same sets of ceramic attributes are
differentially represented at the different sites, which suggests that this differential representation
may have functional implications for the activities carried out at each site.

In addition to the technological analyses of the Hawkwind, Resch, and Folly site assemblages,
petrographic and INAA analyses of ceramic sherds from data recovery at Hawkwind were also
performed in order to compare the ceramic composition of the ceramics found at the Hawkwind
site with those found at the Resch and Folly sites. Prior to submission for petrographic thin
sectioning, the selected Hawkwind, Resch, and Folly sherds were split, with half being sent for
sectioning and the other half being sent for INAA. Petrographic comparisons were based on
similarities and differences in the composition and grain-size distribution of the natural inclusions
and purposefully added temper.

Hawkwind Site (41HS915)
Twenty sherds were selected from the Hawkwind ceramic assemblage for petrographic analysis;
however, four of the thin sections made from the sherds were cut too thick to successfully analyze.
Seventeen sherds and one raw clay sample were selected from the reexamined ceramics from the
Resch site for ceramic petrography. Sixteen of the thin sections made from the sherds were
analyzed; one thin section was too thickly cut for analysis. Two sherds from the Folly site were
subjected to petrographic analysis. The analysis found that the three sites displayed similar
characteristics with regard to their mineral inclusions and temper. Differences in the percentages of
the various constituents’ assemblages were relatively minor. The only measurable difference
between the assemblages was in overall grain size of quartz, which at Resch and Folly was in or
near the medium sand size, while Hawkwind overall grain size was smaller, being contained almost
entirely within the fine sand grain size.

The goals of the INAA research were to examine both the internal compositional variability with the
hope of determining local production signatures, as well as comparing the samples to the larger
East Texas Caddo database. Although the Woodland samples predate the samples in the East Texas
Caddo database, this is the only material that shows any similarity in a Euclidian search of the
MURR (University of Missouri Research Reactor Center) master database. Analysis of the
Hawkwind samples proved to be similar to samples in the main East Texas Caddo Group. In general,
the interpretation of Caddo compositional data is complicated by three major factors: (1) the largescale similarity of raw clays in the region, (2) the frequent use of grog as temper, and (3) the likely
frequent long-distance trade of morphologically similar pottery throughout the region. While these
factors all contribute to the difficulty in identifying the areas of production, the results of the study
did demonstrate the similarity among the samples from Hawkwind, Resch, and Folly with each
other. Further, the ceramic samples from the Hawkwind, Resch, and Folly sites suggest that there is
a dominant affiliation with Caddo samples from Subregion 7 and a more general similarity to
samples from the Sabine River drainage. The submitted raw clay sample could also be assigned to
Subregion 7, and it clusters with a small group of the samples from the Hawkwind and Resch that
show elevated levels of chromium and zirconium. As the INAA report concludes, these new
Woodland period ceramic samples show a slightly greater compositional variability than do the
later Caddo samples from an ever larger area, suggesting increased movement of ceramics and/or
greater variability in raw material. It also hints at the developmental stage of pottery production
during the Woodland period. Because pottery making was relatively in its infancy, pottery making
was a sporadic endeavor that probably did not involve proscribed taboos and rituals about where
to procure clay. Overall, the variability in technological and decorative attributes noted on the
ceramics from the Hawkwind, Resch, Folly, and Herman Ballew sites points to a time of
experimentation during which Woodland potters incorporated aspects of multiple technological
traditions. From the thick grog-tempered Fourche Maline wares with their plain flat bases, to the
nontempered sandy paste Mossy Grove wares with their round bases, to the LMV wares with their
podal supports, Woodland period ceramic assemblages point to a time of innovation during which
Atkins 100018032/120087

7. Summary and Conclusions
potters in this area of East Texas incorporated an array of technological attributes derived from
other ceramic-bearing groups with whom they interacted.

DATING OF THE HAWKWIND SITE

The recovered artifact assemblage indicates that the Hawkwind assemblage is consistent with a
Woodland period occupation. The lithic assemblage at Hawkwind aligns primarily with the
Woodland period, although the broad age ranges represented by many of the diagnostic projectile
point types suggest that some Late Archaic elements are also present. While the recovery of a Friley
and a Catahoula arrow point could indicate a possible Caddo component, both types can date as
early as A.D. 700 and would also fit comfortably with a Late Woodland occupation.

Given their overall technological attributes, all of the ceramics recovered at the Hawkwind site align
with the Woodland period, and four of the eight decorated sherds were assigned tentative
Woodland period typological identifications (see Figure 18). The only decorated rim found at the
site has a sandy paste, and its decorative elements include two parallel U-shaped incisions with a
row of shallow punctations located immediately below the incisions. Both its technological and
decorative attributes are reminiscent of those found on LMV Marksville types. Other identified
types include two Marksville Incised, var. Yokena sherds and a possible Churupa Punctated sherd.
Since the technological attributes associated with each of these sherds suggest they were probably
locally manufactured variants, they may or may not correlate precisely with the date ranges for
these types in the LMV.

Sixteen radiocarbon dates were obtained from samples recovered during data recovery
investigations (Table 56, Figure 45, see Appendix G). These 16 radiocarbon dates range from
1260 B. C. to A.D. 970. All but two align with Woodland period occupations at the site. One date was
obtained from carbonized material found adhering to one of the thermally altered rocks. This
fragment of TAR was found in Level 2 of Unit 1 and yielded a 2-sigma calibrated date range of
A.D. 600–660.

Five of the dates were obtained from ceramic sherds and included dates on the charred residue
adhering to four sherds and the dating of the bulk organics in another sherd (see Figure 45). Dating
of the residue on the four sherds yielded date ranges spanning a 700-year period of time from the
Middle and Late Woodland periods. The sherd (Lot 132.1) with the latest date (A.D. 712–936) was
recovered from the screened Level 2 of Unit 21. Its stratigraphic position is well placed, putting it
near or at the end of the Woodland occupation. The two sherds recovered from Level 3 of Unit 13
had date ranges that were within a few hundred years of each other. The bulk organic date obtained
on the Marksville, var. Yokena sherd (Lot 110.2) has a 2-sigma calibrated age range of A.D. 358–538.
The residue found adhering to a plain sherd from the same unit and level returned a 2-sigma date
range of A.D. 581–660. If the plain sherd was recovered from the top of this 33-cm level, and the

Marksville, var. Yokena sherd was recovered from the base of that level then these dates would also
be stratigraphically consistent. This is said with some caution because bulk sherd dating is a
relatively new technique that has often yielded inconsistent dates (Darden Hood, personal
communication 2011).

The 2-sigma calibrated dates obtained on residue found adhering to the two remaining sherds place
them in the early portion of the Middle Woodland period. Both were recovered from Level 3 of
units located in the western end of the block. Sherd 80.7 was found in Unit 4 and dates to A.D. 20–
130. Sherd 98.1 was recovered from Unit 9 and dates between A.D. 60 and 210.

Dates were also obtained on 10 charred nutshell specimens retrieved from screening (n = 3), from
the two flotation samples (n = 4), and from column sample 2 (n = 3). The seven samples recovered
from the flotation and column samples exhibit calibrated date ranges between 1260 B.C. and
770 A.D. When these dates were plotted on profiles of each of the column and flotation sample
column (Figure 45; see also Figure 16), the dated materials within each column appeared to be
stratigraphically well placed; however, the three samples recovered from the screened sediments
(Lot 93, Lot 108, and Lot 127) yielded a broad range of dates. Specimen 127, recovered from Level
3 of Unit 19, yielded the oldest date (1192–938 B.C.). Specimen 108, recovered from Level 4 of Unit
12, yielded a 2-sigma calibrated age range of A.D. 776–966. Specimen 93 was recovered from Level
4 of Unit 7 and yielded a 2-sigma calibrated age range of A.D. 404–540. These three samples are the
most problematic and suggest mixing of the sediments in these units; however, given the
reasonably stratified placement of the samples recovered from the column samples, it could be that
these samples were displaced during excavation and/or associated with the slumping that resulted
from excavating loosely consolidated sediments with the Gradall.

Two radiocarbon assays were also obtained during TxDOT’s test excavation of the site. Sample
41HS915-2 dates yielded a 2-sigma calibrated date range of A.D. 583 to 655 and fits comfortably
within the Woodland period sequence demonstrated by the 16 dates recovered during data
recovery. The second TxDOT date (Sample 41HS915-1) represents the oldest date (2-sigma
calibrated range of 1903–1751 B.C.) obtained from the site. Because it was collected from test unit 6
(TP6) at a depth of 20–30 cmbs, its presence in the upper levels of the site pointed to stratigraphic
mixing of the site’s sediment. TP6 was located at the far eastern edge of the data recovery blocks
(see Figure 2).
In summary, radiocarbon dating at the Hawkwind site produced some interesting results. The date
ranges of the 18 dated samples recovered from the site indicate fairly consistent occupation of the
site during the Middle and Late Woodland periods, with sporadic occupations occurring during the
Late Archaic and Early Woodland periods (see Figure 45). Among the dates spanning the Middle
and Late Woodland periods, the five dated sherds and seven of the dates obtained from column and
flotation samples appear to be reasonably in place, while the three samples recovered from
mechanical screening of the block units are problematic. This raises some interesting questions

Atkins 100018032/120087

7. Summary and Conclusions
about the excavation technique. Do the dates obtained on the three screened samples represent
true mixing of the site sediments or does the excavation of large blocks of soil with a Gradall bucket
simply introduce or amplify mixing of site sediments?

Having summarized the overall results of the data recovery efforts at the Hawkwind site, the
remainder of this chapter addresses the research topics.

RESEARCH TOPICS

As previously noted, the primary goal in reporting on the excavations at the Hawkwind site was to
assess the site in terms of Woodland period adaptations in the Middle Sabine River basin. Five
research topics were presented that were believed to be relevant to achieving this goal, as well as
the methods that were proposed to address them.

Research Topic 1

How do the ceramics at Hawkwind compare with those at Middle Sabine River basin sites such as
Folly, Resch, and Herman Ballew?
The archeological evidence from East Texas sites having Woodland period components points to a
changing cultural landscape that is marked by lifestyle changes occurring in tandem with
technological changes, the most notable of these being the introduction of ceramics (Cliff 1998).
Broad-scale cultural interaction spheres are reflected in the presence of LMV Tchefuncte and
Marksville ceramics that occur with some frequency in Early to Middle Woodland period sites (ca.
500 B.C. to A.D. 500) (Story 1990). In East Texas, Woodland period sites share certain similarities to
sites covering a broad geographic area extending from eastern Oklahoma into southwestern
Arkansas and northwestern Louisiana, and into southeast Texas. We see the evidence of this in the
subtle, and not so subtle, differences among assemblages associated with each of the three major
cultural traditions recognized in East Texas. For example, ceramic assemblages at Mill Creek sites
are quite small in number when compared to Fourche Maline or Mossy Grove sites. They are also
more technologically variable, exhibiting a mix of plain sandy paste wares, bone-tempered wares,
and thinner grog-tempered wares that are more likely to be related to LMV wares than to the lateroccurring grog-tempered Mossy Grove ceramics. The relatively thick bone-tempered sherds found
at some Mill Creek sites are more likely to be related to the Fourche Maline type defined as Cooper
Boneware, as bone-tempered ceramics do not appear until late in the ceramic sequence in the
Mossy Grove culture area (post–A.D. 900). Similarly, the sandy paste wares with smoothed surface
treatments may be analogous to the Ouachita Ironware type; however, the presence of sandy paste
ceramics exhibiting floated surface treatments would more comfortably fit with the Goose Creek
sandy paste tradition of the Mossy Grove area. There is also a high representation of ceramics with
laminated and contorted paste textures, reminiscent of LMV Tchefuncte and Marksville wares that
date to between ca. 800 B.C. and A.D. 200. Thus, East Texas Woodland period ceramic assemblages
often exhibit a blend of ceramics whose attributes represent multiple technological traditions.

Hawkwind Site (41HS915)
Distinguishing which ceramic tradition specific Mill Creek assemblages are more temporally or
spatially affiliated with will require more systematic comparative analyses of collections that focus
on technological attributes. This study represented just such an approach.

What does this analysis tell us about these four Woodland period sites located in the middle Sabine
River basin? First, analyses of the technological and decorative attributes at the Hawkwind site
illustrate the same technological variation noted at the Resch, Folly, and Herman Ballew sites.
Second, reanalysis of the Resch and Folly site ceramics, as well as the results of the petrographic and
INAA on selected sherds from these two sites, confirmed the technological variability of ceramic
paste characteristics recovered from both sites. Comparing the paste attributes of the ceramics from
Hawkwind, Resch, and Folly with those found on the Herman Ballew ceramics confirms the highly
variable nature of the ceramics from all four sites. In addition to grog, clay lumps, and/or bone
temper, both sand-tempered and nontempered sandy paste wares were also identified. High
proportions of sand were present in the paste matrix of many of the tempered paste groups found
at all four sites, as were various other additives such as crushed hematite and charcoal.
Proportionately speaking, the diversity of paste groups in all four assemblages is similar, even
though the distribution of specific paste groups varies from site to site (see Figure 35).
All four ceramic assemblages include primarily simple vessels with straight walls and highly
variable lip edges. They vary in thickness from one paste category to another, but rims with flat lip
edges are generally much thicker than rims with rounded or tapered-rounded lip edges, and it
appears that this change from flat, thick rims to rounded, thinner rims may be temporally related
(see Figures 18, 24, 28, and 29). Bases were incredibly variable, ranging from flat disc-shaped and
flowerpot styles to round or rounded flat to those having nodal supports (see Figures 30 and 31).
When taken together, these variations point to broad-scale interactions with neighboring groups.
Surfaces are primarily dry-smoothed, but floated surfaces and burnished surfaces have differential
representation at each site. While the ceramics in these assemblages are primarily undecorated
plain wares, when decorated, motifs generally cluster around a narrow range of techniques that
included broad U-shaped lines that were as likely to have been executed on leather-hard pastes as
on wet pastes. Incised lines are primarily straight, but curved incisions seem to be more closely
associated with tempered wares resembling LMV types. Fingernail, stylus, and tool punctations
were also common. Lip decoration occurs infrequently, but when it does, it usually involves notches
or crenellations cut or impressed into the lip edge (see Figures 18, 24, and 37).

Many of the more complicated designs mimic motifs common to LMV or Fourche Maline ceramics,
but the technological attributes of the sherds suggest they are locally made variants. This is
supported by the results of the INAA performed on 39 ceramic sherds and one raw clay sample from
the Resch, Hawkwind, and Folly sites. The results show similarities among the samples from these
three sites and the main Caddo group for the middle Sabine River basin in East Texas, indicating
they were locally manufactured.
Atkins 100018032/120087

7. Summary and Conclusions
Petrographic analysis of the raw clay sample shows that among its many constituents were clay
lumps and opaque material (possibly hematite). Since the paste matrix of many of the analyzed
sherds appear to have been tempered with clay lumps and/or crushed hematite, the appearance of
both constituents in the raw clay itself suggests that they may in fact be natural inclusions rather
that added ones. That being said, microscopic analysis of many of the clay/grog sherds show large
numbers of clay lumps that differ in color and texture from the surrounding paste matrix, which
could indicate that Woodland period potters were mixing two types of clays whose constituents
included clay lumps.

In conclusion, comparisons among the ceramic assemblages at these four sites show definite
technological similarities, as well as a number of differences. This differential representation not
only has functional implications for the activities carried out at each site, but it also represents the
presence of multiple technological traditions. From the thick grog-tempered Fourche Maline wares
with their plain flat bases, to the nontempered sandy paste Mossy Grove wares with their round
bases, to the LMV wares with their podal supports, Woodland period ceramic assemblages point to
a time of innovation during which potters in this area of East Texas incorporated an array of
technological attributes derived from other ceramic-bearing groups with whom they interacted.
This begs the question: how closely connected were the Woodland period populations associated
with the Fourche Maline, the Mill Creek, and the Mossy Grove traditions? Further, what level of
social interaction existed among the various Woodland period groups? And, to what degree do the
differences we see at various sites simply result from within-group variability in the adoption of
specific technologies? It will take the identification and excavation of more Woodland period sites to
fully investigate these questions.

Research Topic 2

Given its close proximity to Resch, is there evidence in the materials at Hawkwind that the two sites
may have been occupied by the same Woodland group(s)?
As previous discussions illustrate, there are definite technological similarities between the
Hawkwind and Resch ceramic assemblages, as well as a number of differences. In many cases,
however, these differences are more quantitative than qualitative in that the same sets of ceramic
attributes are differentially represented at different sites. Given their close proximity to each other,
the question arises as to whether the Hawkwind site could have been occupied by the same
Woodland group(s) that occupied the Resch site? By implication, this question must take into
consideration the temporal span of each site.
Webb et al.’s (1969) research at the Resch site included four radiocarbon dates that yielded dates of
410, 300, and 200 B.C. and A.D. 100. A reevaluation of these earlier dates was done by Perttula
(1997:330) in which the radiocarbon dates were corrected for isotopic fractionation and then
calibrated. This correction yielded calibrated dates ranging between 555 B.C. and A.D. 325,
Atkins 100018032/120087

217

Hawkwind Site (41HS915)
effectively expanding the dated occupation at the Resch site by more than 300 years; however,
several later LMV types and a small Caddo component indicate that the radiocarbon dates do not
reflect the entire occupation sequence at the Resch site. The presence of early Fourche Maline and
LMV types and Mossy Grove sandy paste rims with lip decoration fits well with this time span. It
also suggests that the Resch site had a wide interaction sphere that included contacts with groups
representing a number of ceramic-manufacturing traditions.

At the Hawkwind site, radiocarbon dates obtained from both organic remains (primarily hickory
nuts), sherd residue, and sherd bulk organics indicate multiple occupations dating from the Late
Archaic to the end of the Woodland period (see Figure 43). The A.D. 3–206 date obtained from the
residue found on one of the Hawkwind sherds (Lot 80.7) and the A.D. 390–540 date derived from
the bulk dating of the organic material in a Marksville Incised, var. Yokena sherd (Specimen 110.2)
fit well with the date ranges at the Resch site and are consistent with several Marksville Incised,
var. Yokena sherds recovered at the Resch site. Thus, it is quite plausible that the Hawkwind site
could have been variably occupied by the same Woodland group(s) that occupied the Resch site.

It is also interesting to note that the historic Trammel’s Trace, which follows the path of the older
Hasinai Trace, runs along the east side of the Susie Slade site, past the Hawkwind site, and just to
the south of the Resch site (Gadus and Fields 2012; Figure 10). Trammel’s Trace runs roughly north
and south and connects with the Camino de Arriba at Nacogdoches that travels west and east into
Louisiana (McGraw et al. 1998). While it is unknown if these historic trails reach as far back as the
Woodland period, it is known that an extensive system of Indian trails traversed the countryside
and have considerable time depth (Pupo-Walker 1993). If this trail were in place during Woodland
times, it could have connected the Fourche Maline, Mill Creek, and Mossy Grove areas and explain
the repeated use of the Resch and Hawkwind sites, possibly by the same Woodland group(s).

Research Topic 3

What does the presence of LMV ceramics at the Hawkwind, Resch, Herman Ballew, and other Middle
Sabine River basin sites tell us about interregional exchange and interaction between the two areas?
Addressing this research topic was to involve identifying the physical and cultural environments at
those sites in the Middle Sabine River basin that yielded LMV ceramics, with the intention of
identifying trends that might help identify trade networks or other types of settlement patterns.
This topic was based on the premise that true LMV ceramics were recovered at the Hawkwind,
Resch, and Herman Ballew sites. However, the results of the ceramic analysis, the INAA, and the
petrographic analysis indicate that while many complicated designs that mimic motifs common to
LMV-manufactured ceramics are present at each site, the technological attributes suggest they do
not represent LMV pottery, but rather are locally made variants of recognizable LMV types that may
or may not correlate precisely with the date ranges for these types in the LMV.

7. Summary and Conclusions
A comparison of the cultural characteristics of six Woodland sites located within a 60-mile radius of
the Hawkwind site are presented in Table 57. Four of the six had ceramic assemblages that
contained LMV ceramics. In addition to the Resch and Herman Ballew site ceramics (discussed in
detail above), LMV ceramics were recovered at 41HS231 and the Holmes site (41SM282). At
41HS231, Coles Creek Incised sherds were recovered (Dockall et al. 2008). Radiocarbon dates
obtained from 41HS231 indicate multiple occupations, the earliest of which ranged from A.D. 540 to
810 (Dockall et al. 2008:86–89). No INAA or petrographic analyses were conducted on the sherds
so it isn’t possible to speculate as to whether they were locally made or not. At the Holmes site,
however, INAA analysis performed on one of the LMV Coles Creek sherds suggests that it was a
locally made variant, leading Perttula (2003:40) to surmise that the LMV-looking sherds found at
the Holmes site represented ceramics “whose stylistic decorative attributes were borrowed by local
potters from other aboriginal groups, probably in Northwest Louisiana rather than the more distant
LMV.”
Evidence from these four sites and the Hawkwind site illustrates the complex issues related to the
movement of ceramics and peoples across the landscape. The presence of LMV-looking ceramics
that were apparently locally made variants illustrates that complexity. However, the mere presence
of LMV design elements on Woodland period ceramics is evidence of contact with other groups and
the presence of a wide social interaction sphere. Understanding the variables at play in this sphere
will take the excavation of more Woodland period sites.

Research Topic 4

What are the characteristics of the chipped stone tool assemblage at the Hawkwind site? Is the
assemblage similar to other Woodland period sites, and what do these tools tell us about the types of
activities that occurred there?
The assemblage of chipped stone tools found at Hawkwind contains an assortment of tools that
includes dart points, arrow points, biface or biface fragments, choppers, and modified flakes.
Ground stone artifacts were also recovered. While these artifacts are believed to primarily align
with the Woodland period, some of the dart points were left behind by Late Archaic peoples, and
the few arrow points could be associated with use of the location by the early Caddo. It is, of course,
impossible to assign nondiagnostic artifacts to specific time periods. However, the cultural deposits
at the site appear to be primarily Woodland in age.

The projectile point assemblage is typical of Woodland period sites in the Middle Sabine River
Valley and is dominated by the dart point type Gary, as are Woodland projectile point assemblages
at the Herman Ballew, Resch, and Folly sites. Table 58 lists the percentages of the Gary dart point
varieties recovered from each site. Of the four sites, only Hawkwind yielded specimens of each
variety. The disparities among the percentages of Gary varieties at Hawkwind was not great, with
the predominant variety (Gary var. Kaufman) represented by 16 percent. Interestingly, this variety

is also represented by 17 percent at Resch and nearly the same percentage (19 percent) at Herman
Ballew. None of this type were recovered at the Folly site. The predominant variety at both Resch
and Herman Ballew was Gary var. Emory, represented by 35 percent and 23 percent, respectively. It
also represents 20 percent of the dart points recovered at the Folly site. It is a minor variety at
Hawkwind, occurring at the same frequency (6 percent) as Gary var. Alsa and Gary var. Kenedy.
These two varieties also occur in low frequencies or are absent entirely at Resch and Herman
Ballew. However, at the Folly site, Gary var. Kenedy represents 20 percent of the recovered Gary
points.

There is little evidence for the importation of nonlocal stone in any of the chipped stone tool
categories at the Hawkwind site, a characteristic that is shared with other Woodland sites in the
region. In the overall Hawkwind lithic assemblage, approximately 4 to 5 percent of the assemblage
was made with nonlocal raw material such as quartz, black chert, white chert, and volcanic tuff.
This is also evinced in the Gary dart point assemblages recovered from all four sites (Table 59),
where raw material types are dominated by local raw materials, mainly cherts and silicified wood.
Although quartzites were classified as foreign materials at the Resch site, it is likely that they were
once part of cobbles collected from nearby rivers and streams. Thus, they should probably be
identified as a local material rather than originating from foreign sources. In general, all four
collections are dominated by Gary points made of relatively poor quality materials, the majority of
which were collected locally.

Based on the predominance of projectile points in the assemblage, it is clear that hunting was a
major pursuit for the site’s occupants. That animal food processing occurred there is not surprising,
as is the evidence of manufacturing and retooling, which based on the results of the microwear
analyses seems to have been one of the principal activities carried out at the site (see Appendix D).

It is clear that other activities also took place at Hawkwind. This is evidenced by the ground stone
artifacts, whose general morphology and associated wear patterns point to their use in a diverse
Atkins 100018032/120087

222

7. Summary and Conclusions
range of activities such as food processing, tool manufacturing and maintenance, woodworking, and
the pounding and grinding of nonfood substances such as ochre.

In summary, the chipped and ground stone assemblages indicate that a range of activities took
place at the site. Add to this the presence of a possible thermal feature, the seemingly functionally
diverse ceramic assemblage, and the presence of subsistence remains, albeit few in number, and the
cumulative evidence suggests that the Hawkwind site was an intensively used habitation site with
repeated occupations spanning the entire Woodland period.

Research Topic 5

What are the advantages and disadvantages of the unusual method of investigation employed at
Hawkwind? How do the results compare with a standard excavation of similar cost? Should the
method be used again in the future? If so, what improvements or changes should be made?
Employing mechanical excavation equipment and a motorized screen at the Hawkwind site was a
strategy aimed at maximizing data return on what was believed to be a relatively low density,
poorly stratified archeological site while avoiding the cost and time consumption associated with
traditional excavation methods. Although it was recognized that this strategy prevented collection
of detailed provenience information, the method was selected because previous work had
established that spatial and stratigraphic integrity was so compromised that detailed provenience
was largely irrelevant.
Discussing the advantages and disadvantages of this unusual method of investigation must take into
consideration a number of concerns involving the efficacy of the method itself and all its related
issues such as the objectives of the effort, the collection strategy employed to achieve those
objectives, controlling for the various biases introduced when employing a gross method of
recovery, and the logistics and safety concerns surrounding the operation of heavy machinery and
the mechanical screening device. Drawing attention to some of the methodological differences
between this technique and more traditional methods will help clarify some of these issues. Using
traditional excavation techniques to mitigate a site requires the development of a cost-effective
sampling strategy that allows for maximum coverage of the site given the available time and
resources. The nature of the site determines the most effective strategy for addressing related
research questions. Depending on the sampling strategy employed (e.g., systematic, random,
judgmental), a certain amount of sampling bias will be introduced. Note that it is the collection
method used to create the sample and not the actual sample itself that defines the bias.
In the case of the Hawkwind site, using an excavation strategy that targeted the collection of an
entire site assemblage eliminated the need for a traditional hand-excavated sampling strategy;
however, it did not eliminate the need for a recovery strategy that maximized data return while
minimizing collection bias, especially if the site’s eligibility was believed to be dependent on the
compositional integrity of the assemblage as a whole. If the goal of the project is to collect the
Atkins 100018032/120087

223

Hawkwind Site (41HS915)
largest possible sample from the site, then the collection strategy should be systematic and
consistent, especially if the method involves mechanical excavations with a Gradall and a motorized
screening device. Even if sediments were removed in broad levels, any remaining spatial or
stratigraphic integrity would be compromised simply because any time-sensitive diagnostics would
also be compromised. Thus, maintaining a rigorous and consistent collection strategy throughout
the excavations is critical to retaining any stratigraphic integrity that does still remain. Otherwise
another layer of imprecision is introduced into a sampling method that is already imprecise by its
nature.

The drawbacks to this unusual excavation technique are obvious, but several changes in the
Hawkwind collection strategy would have enabled the collection of a better controlled sample.
First, the decision to screen only selected units in Level 2 introduced a collection bias. The “grab
sample” approach that was taken with the unscreened Level 2 sediment resulted in the collection of
fewer artifacts in those units. Alternatively, when Level 2 was screened, it contained a sizable
number of artifacts, many of which were datable (see Table 5 and Figure 16). The discrepancy in
the artifact totals between the screened and unscreened sediments suggests that many artifacts
were missed (see Table 5). If one of the goals of this excavation method was to maximize data
return, then all levels below the overburden should have been systematically screened. By
screening only selected units, many datable artifacts were probably missed. Second, even if
potentially datable objects are recovered, maintaining a consistent collection strategy throughout
the excavations is the only way to assure that we have roughly comparable slices across the site. A
good example of this relates to the limitations imposed on the analysis of the Gary dart points.
While information gleaned from the column samples and the ceramic dates suggests that at least
portions of Hawkwind still maintained some degree of stratigraphic integrity (see Table 28 and
Figure 16), the Gary dart points were all recovered from the mechanically screened unit/levels
encompassing depths and elevations ranging from as much as 30 to 80 cm. When Level 3 was split
into two levels part way through the excavation, this further compromised the already broad strata,
making it difficult to compare one unit/level to another or even the relevant position of dart points
found within the same units. This is important because many of the time sensitive variables
associated with specific Gary dart point varieties are subtle. For example, in previous excavations at
other Woodland occupation sites, such as the Yarbrough site Johnson 1962), it was possible to
segregate several Gary dart point varieties belonging to specific periods or phases; however,
identifying these subtle changes through time required uniformly excavated units in order to
interpret their subtle changes through time. While the stratigraphic mixing of sediments at the
Hawkwind site may have been such that even traditional hand-excavated units would have been
unable to tease out this data, the fact that portions of the site still appeared reasonably stratified
suggests that at least some of the broad mechanically excavated strata may have also been
reasonably intact. The dates obtained on the ceramics recovered from mechanically excavated
unit/levels support this. Thus, had the mechanically excavated unit/levels maintained more
consistency across the site, it may have been possible to recognize at least some of the timeAtkins 100018032/120087

sensitive changes in the different Gary dart point varieties and their time-sensitive placement
within the site.

As the above examples illustrate, maintaining more-consistent recovery methods from one
unit/block to another would have assured a greater degree of comparability that quite possibly
could have added more temporally related information to our knowledge of the Hawkwind site.
Even given the slumping of loosely consolidated alluvial sediments, relatively consistent levels
would have been possible in those units excavated prior to the heavy rainfall and surface runoff
that impacted the eastern end of the block excavations.

In addition to the issues relating to collection strategy methods, there are also issues revolving
around the logistical and safety concerns inherent in the use of heavy equipment. Under optimum
conditions, mechanical excavations allow for a smaller crew to excavate a site, as much of the
physical labor is borne by the machinery. At Hawkwind, the Gradall used to excavate the units in
the block was operated by a single technician and monitored by a staff archeologist. While some
difficulties arose from slumping when attempts were made to excavate one unit at a time in the
loosely consolidated sediments, modifications were made that largely alleviated the problem. The
Gradall continued to be successfully utilized throughout the duration of the site excavations.

The motorized screening device was less effective. The usefulness of the device was compromised
by the high moisture levels in the sandy alluvium at the site. The heavy rains that occurred during
the excavations at Hawkwind restricted the ability of the device to properly function without the
aid of two to three staff archeologists, who forcefully pushed the sediment through the screen. This
was a necessary but relatively ineffective use of manpower. In addition to limitations in the field, it
was later learned during the microwear analysis of stone tools from the site that the galvanized
screen fitted on the motorized screening device left a permanent residue on some stone artifacts
that hindered analysis.

Further examination of the effectiveness of mechanical excavation and screening at the site can be
approximated by comparing the excavations with one using standard nonmechanical techniques.
The following comparison looks at the rate of excavation at the Hawkwind site as compared with
excavation rates at the Santa Maria Creek site (41CW104) in Caldwell County, Texas. Atkins
conducted data recovery excavations at the site in 2007 (Rogers et al. 2013). The Santa Maria Creek
site was chosen for comparison because, like Hawkwind, it was located in a restricted TxDOT ROW
and contained Late Prehistoric archeological materials buried in sandy alluvial sediments.
Table 60 contains the data gathered from excavation units at both sites for comparative purposes.
The unit selected from the Santa Maria Creek site is typical of one of the over 30 units in the
primary excavation area. Two units have been selected from Hawkwind. One (Unit 2) was hand
excavated and screened. The second unit (Unit 18) was mechanically excavated and screened using
the motorized screening device.

From the above data, it appears that at Hawkwind there was little difference in the time required to
manually excavate and screen a unit compared to the time involved in mechanically excavating and
screening one. While this may seem odd given the amount of sediment that can be mechanically
excavated versus removal by hand in a given time, it was the screening of the sediment that was the
restraining factor. As mentioned above, the motorized screening device was unable to sift the wet
sediments at the site, and thus the time spent in screening offset any time gained by mechanical
excavation. However, the mechanical excavation equipment was very useful in removing
overburden and backdirt, two onerous tasks that if performed manually would have slowed the
excavations considerably. Indeed, it was these two tasks that occupied much of the time during
which mechanical excavation equipment was in use at the site.
The lower rate of excavation at 41CW104 undoubtedly reflects the additional time expended in
excavating in 10-cm levels that was necessary at that site. The use of heavy machinery at Hawkwind
for removing overburden and backdirt likely contributed somewhat to the increased rate of
excavation there.
Further, it is always necessary to consider the potential hazards of using heavy machinery during
archeological investigations. While such equipment is commonly employed at excavations, there
always exists the potential for accidents. Typically, this is largely alleviated by restricting the use of
machinery to areas of a site away from the manual excavations. At Hawkwind, such was not the
case. To begin with, the excavations took place in a narrow ROW, adjacent to a high-speed roadway.
Within this confined area, a Gradall, backhoe, and motorized screening device were utilized, all in
close proximity to the archeological crew. While standard safety equipment was always worn and
monitoring of the machinery was constant, the use of heavy machinery around workers in a
confined space always creates a hazardous environment. Fortunately, no accidents occurred.

In summary, the use of mechanical excavation equipment at Hawkwind was not particularly
effective in expediting the work performed there. This was primarily because of the wet conditions
Atkins 100018032/120087

226

7. Summary and Conclusions
that severely hindered the usefulness of the motorized screening device. Changes to the equipment,
such as replacing the carbon alloy steel mesh with aluminum, may prevent damage to stone
artifacts, and reducing the thickness of the screen itself may be beneficial. Because the screen is
designed for maximum vibration to screen large rocks and rubble, artifacts tend to bounce around
and off the screen. Additional modifications, such as adding a metal flat bar to act as a lip to the
front edge of the scoop, could help keep artifacts from vibrating out of the screen. However, even
with these modifications, adjusting the overall design to accommodate the screening of smaller,
more-delicate cultural materials will always be problematic. Enlarging the mesh size of the screen
from ¼ inch to ½ inch would of course help, but at the expense of a loss of recovery of smaller-sized
cultural materials, such as faunal fragments and the modified ochre and raw clay samples.

While the mitigation was designed to mechanically recover a relatively robust assemblage of
artifacts quickly and with only limited controls on provenience, the excavation revealed portions of
the site that still retained a reasonable degree of compositional integrity. With a consistent
collection strategy that employed a few more controls, it might have been possible to identify more
time-sensitive artifacts. Thus, the usefulness of this technique to provide a viable alternative in
future excavations will be site specific. Ultimately, any modification to the screening device, or the
collection methods, will depend on the objectives of the study, the research topics being addressed,
and how much of the assemblage we wish to capture? If the objective is recovery of the largest
possible sample from the site, then a larger screen size would not be an option. If the objective is to
maximize meaningful data from the site, then a uniform and consistent collection strategy should
be implemented and maintained.

CONCLUSION

As stated previously, the Hawkwind site was excavated with the intent of contributing to a poorly
understood time period in East Texas. Although the vertical and spatial integrity of the
archeological deposits appeared to be compromised, TxDOT ENV believed that the site had the
potential to address questions important to prehistory, and thus considered it to be eligible for
designation as an archeological historic property (36 CFR 800.16(l)) and for formal designation as a
State Archeological Landmark (13 TAC 26.12). However, the site’s eligibility was believed to be
dependent on the compositional integrity of the assemblage as a whole and the ability of the
investigating parties to process a sufficient volume of site matrix to recover a large enough
assemblage to convincingly demonstrate that integrity. With this in mind, research questions were
devised to answer questions about a stratigraphically mixed assemblage that was interpretable at
the assemblage level. To this extent, the excavation techniques employed at the site achieved this
goal.
Despite the above-discussed shortcomings of the mechanical equipment and the collection strategy
employed, investigations at the Hawkwind site succeeded in recovering a relatively robust artifact
assemblage that when accompanied by the radiocarbon dates and the numerous special samples

performed on the recovered ceramic and lithic artifacts confirmed the compositional integrity of
the site as representing a largely Middle to Late Woodland period assemblage, with ephemeral Late
Archaic, Early Woodland, and a possible Late Prehistoric occupations. Further, the data from this
site has added tremendously to our knowledge of Woodland period sites in East Texas.

AFTERWORD

by TxDOT Staff, Environmental Affairs Division, Texas Department
of Transportation
This brief afterword is not intended to critique or provide alternative interpretations to the overall
Hawkwind site report, which we believe makes significant contributions to our understanding of
the Woodland period in northeast Texas. Rather, our purpose here is to address two specific,
related aspects of the authors’ closing arguments. First, we address the notion that the stratigraphy
of 41HR915 might in fact be better preserved than TxDOT originally believed. Second, we provide
our own evaluation of the methodology that was used, which TxDOT developed and imposed on
Atkins’ crew.

The preceding site report describes analysis of an artifact assemblage from a site that we initially
judged to have very little spatial and stratigraphic integrity, based on a limited suite of
chronological information. Such sites are all too common in northeast Texas, where deep sandy
soils are common, and pose significant challenges to practitioners and sponsors of public-sector
archeology. TxDOT’s methodology was based on the assumption that the stratigraphy of the
Hawkwind site was highly compromised by various forms of postdepositional disturbance. This is a
very common occurrence, and makes investigation of east Texas sandy sites a challenging
proposition. Time-diagnostic artifacts can be sorted out and dealt with, but other parts of the
assemblage (e.g., lithic debitage, faunal and floral remains) pose significant difficulties. Although
one could conceivably attempt to sort such assemblages into components based upon the
characteristics of the artifacts, in most cases we find such attempts to be both dangerously circular
and far too costly for routine application. This is the reason that TxDOT typically places such a
premium on spatial and stratigraphic integrity, which we use as an objective proxy of the degree to
which a prehistoric site exhibits integrity of “location, design, setting, materials, workmanship,
feeling, and association” as is required for a site to be considered eligible to the NRHP (36CFR60.4).
Given this reasoning, why, then, would we go to the time and expense of data recovery at the
Hawkwind site at all?

The answer is that while spatial and stratigraphic integrity of a prehistoric site provide a useful
proxy for integrity as defined under the National Historic Preservation Act, it is not the same thing.
In this case, examination of the artifacts recovered from 41HS915 during the evaluation phase
suggested that while the sediments and associated artifacts had almost certainly been mixed, in
aggregate they appeared to represent a relatively discrete period of time (the Woodland and
possibly Late Archaic). More importantly, it was a time period that has seen relatively little study,

Atkins 100018032/120087

229

Hawkwind Site (41HS915)
primarily because most Woodland sites are overprinted with material from the Caddo period.
TxDOT felt that if the diagnostics and dated materials from the site indeed proved to primarily be
Woodland, then analysis of the collection as a whole could advance our knowledge of the period,
even if fine-grained stratigraphic information was lacking. Although we did not believe the
stratigraphy could be trusted to reliably subdivide the assemblage, we did believe that there was a
good chance that reasonable integrity in location, materials, and association (sensu Little et al.
2000) could be demonstrated for the collection as a whole by a combination of typological analysis
of diagnostic materials and radiocarbon dating. Even if that failed, we would obtain a sample of
diagnostic artifacts that we could date to the Woodland period, and the effort would still provide
useful data.

Importantly, TxDOT argued that the methods used should be scaled appropriately to the nature of
the site. Because we believed that stratigraphic integrity was compromised, and that obtaining as
large a sample size as practical was a critical goal, we developed and imposed a mechanically-based
excavation strategy rather than using the classic hand excavation strategy in which all archeologists
are trained. We believed that by doing this, we could dramatically increase the scale of the
excavation block without causing costs to spiral out of control. In addition to Gradall-based
excavation, we proposed a mechanical screen to process the sediments more rapidly and efficiently.
Although the proposed methods involved a significant loss of locational precision, we did
implement a degree of spatial and stratigraphic control by subdividing the block into discrete
sampling units and broad levels, so that some degree of spatial and stratigraphic control existed in
the collection process.
In their evaluation of the methods used at Hawkwind, Rogers and Ellis reach some unflattering
conclusions. In their discussion of the dating program in Chapter 7, the authors of the report
conclude with this statement:
“. . . among the dates spanning the Middle and Late Woodland periods, the five dated
sherds and seven of the dates obtained from column and flotation samples appear to
be reasonably in place, while the three samples recovered from mechanical
screening of the block units are problematic. This raises some interesting questions
about the excavation technique. Do the dates obtained on the three screened
samples represent true mixing of the site sediments, or does the excavation of large
blocks of soil with a Gradall bucket simply introduce or amplify mixing of site
sediments?”(pp. 214–215, this document).

We have reviewed the radiocarbon data and Atkins’ Figure 16, and disagree with this premise.
Figure 46 illustrates the conventional, δ13C-corrected age of each dated radiocarbon sample from
41HS915 in conventional years BP. The Y-axis of the graph is the depth below ground surface. The
symbol indicates the midpoint of the depth range, and the associated error bar indicates the range
of possible depths for each sample, which is a function of the thickness of the sample units. The two
green circles represent the original TxDOT dates, and the three blue circles are the three ages that

8. Afterword

Figure 46: Radiocarbon ages from 41HS915, showing the relationship between age
and depth. See text for description of symbols.
Atkins identifies as likely displaced during Gradall excavation. Atkins argues that the three ages
with blue circles are from more questionable context because they originate from machine-dug
levels, and essentially exclude them from consideration. They also do not consider TxDOT’s samples
from the testing, even though they represent recovery at 10-cm stratigraphic resolution. They then
assert that the remaining ages “spanning the Middle and Late Woodland periods” are “reasonably in
place” (pg. 214, this volume). We do not agree.

In an ideal situation, a scatter plot of radiocarbon ages vs. depth would define a curve representing
the rate of sedimentation. However, as Binford (1981) pointed out many years ago, sites are rarely
perfectly preserved, and a certain level of spatial and stratigraphic disturbance is inevitable. In
practice, the inclusion of older materials and inevitable levels of bioturbation will always introduce
scatter about that curve. The real question arises when one considers how much disturbance (i.e.,
noise) is tolerable in an archeological assemblage, and that is always a judgment call on the part of
the investigator (and the sponsoring and regulatory entities). While we recognize that there is a
reasonable correlation between age and depth, particularly when the questioned ages are excluded
(which we will concede for argument’s sake, even though the two TxDOT ages have 10-cm

231

Hawkwind Site (41HS915)
resolution— better than any of Atkins’ ages), we believe that the remaining ages still exhibit a
highly problematic “signal-to-noise ratio.”

Let us consider the column data presented in Atkins’ Figure 16 in detail. Considering only the data
presented, the samples in Flotation Sample Column 2 exhibit a stratigraphic reversal, while those in
CS2 and Flotation Column Sample 1 also show a reversal when you consider that the two units are
immediately adjacent and should be considered a single column for stratigraphic purposes (see
Figure 7 for the column locations). Also relevant but unexplored by Atkins is the stratigraphic
distribution of diagnostic artifacts, which show only the vaguest tendency to exhibit stratigraphic
order (Figure 47). Although we acknowledge that there is a tendency for the unexcluded samples in
Figure 46 to increase in age with depth, we do not believe that the data, considered in aggregate,
support the notion that the sequence could have been subdivided into meaningful components.

subdivided by type and approximate age and ordered by shallowest possible depth.

8. Afterword
This brings us to Atkins’ critiques of the method, which can be divided into three main threads.
First, much of this critique is based on the assumption that the method was too coarse to gather the
type of meaningful stratigraphic information that would have been available from standard block
excavation. As discussed above, we have examined the available chronometric data, and reject this
critique. Although hand excavation would have produced higher precision stratigraphic data,
meaningful information would not have been forthcoming because the stratigraphic integrity of the
deposits is compromised. Any attempt to interpret the data as if that wasn’t the case would yield
unjustified archeological conclusions, and might set our understanding of chronological issues back
rather than pushing it forward.
A second thread of critique concerns the mechanics of the field process. In this regard, we agree
that the methods could have been improved in any number of ways. In particular, the screening
process was terribly inefficient; given that the heavy gauge screen used in the mechanical
attachment was so coarse that sieving was significantly impeded (the ratio of mesh surface to hole
across the screen was almost 3:1). However, this is not a reasonable critique of the broader
approach, only of its specific application. We would also note that many of the specific criticisms,
such as the lack of a “rigorous and consistent collection strategy” (pg. 224), reflect field decisions
made by Atkins personnel. We concurred with these changes, which had reasons behind them, but
we did not impose them.

It is the third thread of the critique on which we wish to focus. Table 60 (pg. 226, this document)
presents a comparison of two units excavated at 41HS915 with a hand-excavated unit from site
41CW104. Citing this table, the authors conclude that “there was little difference in the time
required to hand excavate and screen a unit compared to the time involved in mechanically
excavating and screening one.” We find this argument, using as its support a small group of cherrypicked units, to be misleading. We do not believe that hand excavation is a reasonable surrogate for
mechanical excavation if the goal is rapid, efficient recovery of artifacts

Although there are many factors that influence the rate of excavation, we believe that a better
comparison looks at the level of effort for sites as a whole. The Hawkwind site was excavated over a
6-week period (August 9–September 19, 2009) by a crew of seven archeologists, supplemented by
the Principal Investigator and TxDOT machine operators. Excluding intangibles such as illnesses
and rain days, this equates to 210 person days (30 field days x 7 archeologists). Despite the
problems recognized with the screening process, this crew was able to excavate, by machine and by
hand, a total of 155 m3 (approximately 0.74 m3/person/day) and fully screen and process 78 m3
(approximately 0.37 m3/person/day). In comparison, at 41CW104 a crew of nine (plus Principal
Investigator) worked for 12 weeks (August 8–October 31, 2007; approximately 60 field days) and
hand excavated a total of 34 m3. This equates to a sustained excavation rate of roughly 0.063
m3/person/day, which is far more in line with our experience with overall rates of hand excavation
on a data recovery. This metric suggests that mechanical excavation and screening at 41HS915 was
six times more time efficient than hand excavation at 41CW104.
Atkins 100018032/120087

233

Hawkwind Site (41HS915)
Comparison of the Hawkwind site against other data recovery projects provides another, relatively
robust measure of its efficiency. Figure 48 plots the inflation-corrected cost of fieldwork (calculated
from prefield mobilization through interim reporting) against the volume of sediments excavated
and screened for 18 other TxDOT data recovery projects conducted since 2000. Although this data
set excludes three anomalous sites (41AN38, 41DL436, and 41HR796), it provides a good picture of
the general relationship between field cost and excavation volume. Despite the issues in screening
and rain delays, these data suggest that the volume of excavation is roughly four times what could
be expected from a typical project with the same level of expenditure, and one-third the cost of a
hand excavation of equivalent volume.

Figure 48: Plot of inflation-adjusted cost vs. excavation volume on the Hawkwind site project and
18 other TxDOT data recovery projects since the turn of the 21st century. The Hawkwind data
is based on the volume of sediment that was screened (78.5 m3). The correlation coefficient
and regression line were calculated for the other 18 projects, and exclude Hawkwind.
In summary, while we do not view this methodological experiment as an unqualified success,
neither do we see it as a failure. The rate of recovery was in the predicted range, and resulted in an
assemblage including several hundred potsherds and more than 100 projectile points, most of

which date to the latest Archaic or Woodland periods. Atkins has converted these artifacts to data,
and made a significant contribution to our understanding of this interval of time in Northeast Texas.
A similar investment in a more traditional approach would have clearly resulted in a much smaller
sample. Although the provenience information associated with this sample would have been more
precise, we do not believe that the precision would be behaviorally or temporally meaningful. Thus,
the three- to sixfold reduction in the artifact sample size would have come without any concomitant
benefits.

Plant Remains from Flotation Samples

Appendix A: Plant Remains from Flotation Samples
by Leslie L. Bush, Ph.D., R.P.A.

Eleven flotation samples from the Hawkwind site (41HS915) were submitted for identification and
analysis of macrobotanical remains. The samples represent five or six levels from each of two
columns. A total of 96.0 liters of soil matrix was processed and analyzed.

METHODS

Flotation samples from the Hawkwind site were processed at Atkins’ Austin offices in a Flot-Tech
closed flotation system. Light fractions were caught in a 0.212-mm mesh, and heavy fractions were
caught in 1.0-mm bottom mesh before being sorted through a stack of geologic mesh with square
openings of 19 mm, 9.5 mm, and 4.75 mm to remove larger rocks. Larger carbonized botanical
material picked from the heavy fractions and all heavy fraction material smaller than 4.75 mm was
sent to Macrobotanical Analysis along with the light fractions. Heavy fractions were scanned under
the microscope, and all carbonized botanical material was removed and added to the light fractions
prior to sorting. Two heavy fractions included lithic flakes that were bagged and labeled for transfer
to the appropriate analyst (Lots 152 and 175).
In the laboratory, all samples were subject to full radiocarbon protocols to retain suitability for
radiocarbon dating. Samples were sorted on freshly cleaned glassware and handled only with latex
gloves and metal forceps. Screens used to size-sort material were cleaned between samples.
Contact with paper and other plant products was avoided. Only one sample was open at a time in
the laboratory. Writing instruments used for data recording of samples were plastic mechanical
pencils.

Flotation samples were sorted according to standard procedures at the Macrobotanical Analysis
laboratory in Manchaca, Texas (Pearsall 2000). Each sample was weighed on an Ohaus Scout II 200
x 0.01 g electronic balance before being size-sorted through a stack of graduated geologic mesh.
Material that did not pass through the No. 10 mesh (2-mm-square openings) was completely
sorted, and all carbonized botanical remains were counted, weighed, recorded, and labeled.
Uncarbonized botanical material larger than 2 mm (roots and rootlets) was weighed, recorded, and
labeled as “contamination.” Material that fell through the 2-mm mesh (“residue”) was examined
under a stereoscopic microscope at 7–45 X magnification for carbonized botanical remains. Any
identifiable plant material that had not been previously identified in the material larger than 2 mm
was removed from the residue, counted, weighed, recorded, and labeled. Uncarbonized
macrobotanical remains were recorded on a presence/absence basis on laboratory forms.
Botanical materials were identified to the lowest possible taxonomic level by comparison to
materials in the Macrobotanical Analysis comparative collection and through the use of standard
reference works (Core et al. 1979; Davis 1993; Hoadley 1990; Martin and Barkley 2000; Musil
Atkins 100018032/120087

A-1

Appendix A, Cont’d
1963; Panshin and de Zeeuw 1980). Botanical nomenclature follows that of the PLANTS Database
(U.S. Department of Agriculture, Natural Resources Conservation Service 2011).

RESULTS

Table A-1 shows carbonized and semicarbonized botanical material from flotation samples.
Uncarbonized seeds and leaves are shown on a presence/absence basis in Table A-2.

DISCUSSION

Archeological versus modern plants. Uncarbonized seeds were present in all samples (see Table
A-2). The ubiquity of carpetweed in the samples in notable since it indicates that flotation
techniques were sufficient to routinely recover this small seed (0.7 mm diameter). Uncarbonized
seeds are a common occurrence on most archeological sites, but they usually represent seeds of
modern plants that have made their way into the soil either through their own dispersal
mechanisms or by faunalturbation, floralturbation, or argilliturbation (Bryant 1985:51–52;
Miksicek 1987:231–232). In all except the driest areas of North America, uncarbonized plant
material on open-air sites can be assumed to be of modern origin unless compelling evidence
suggests otherwise (Lopinot and Brussell 1982; Miksicek 1987:231). Uncarbonized seeds at the
Hawkwind site consist of weedy annuals and trees common in the area, and there is a negative
correlation between number of uncarbonized taxa and level at the site (r = –0.64). Uncarbonized
macrobotanical remains are interpreted as modern.

The semicarbonized plant remains and their overlap with both carbonized and uncarbonized plant
taxa indicate recent burning activity in the site area. Semicarbonized remains were more common
in the samples from Column 6 (Lots 174–180), but they were also present in the uppermost level of
the other column (Lot 150). Pine wood was present in carbonized, uncarbonized, and
semicarbonized form, suggesting that it was the main fuel of the recent fire(s). Croton and
dewberry seeds, however, were noted in both carbonized and uncarbonized forms. The carbonized
seeds may also be the product of recent burning. Nutshell, which was recovered only in carbonized
form, would be the preferred material for radiocarbon dating of the archeological deposits.
Wood charcoal. A total of 151 fragments of wood charcoal weighing 0.95 g was recovered from the
Hawkwind site. Although wood charcoal was not formally identified for this project, several taxa
were noted during sorting. These include pine, oak, and holly or yaupon. All of these trees would be
expected in the vicinity of the site.

Nutshell. Nutshell was more common than wood charcoal on the site, with a total of 2.45 g (332
fragments) recovered. Thick-shelled hickory was the most common nut resource represented, and
it was present in all 11 samples. Black walnut (1 sample) and acorn (5 samples) were also
recovered.

Faunal Analysis
by Michael Nash

Appendix B: Faunal Analysis
by Michael Nash

INTRODUCTION
The faunal analysis sought to identify all remains to the most specific taxonomic level possible,
based on limitations of specimen completeness. Minimum number of individuals (MNI) of all
species identified was to be calculated if possible. However, no taxonomic class exhibits an MNI
greater than 1. Other attributes of the bone assemblage, such as age distribution of species,
observed pathology, differential preservation of various skeletal parts, taphonomy, or butchering
evidence, were to be identified and interpreted when possible. However, due to the poor
preservation, none of these attributes could be utilized.
During NRHP eligibility testing and data recovery investigations at 41HS915, 63 faunal remains
were recovered (Table B-1). The condition of preservation is very poor. The assemblage exhibits
extensive erosion and calcification as well as burning and postdepositional breakage.
A total of 34 specimens (54 percent) could not be identified at any taxonomic level. The remaining
29 fragments (80 percent) include 26 mammalian fragments (90 percent) and 3 reptile fragments
(10 percent).

MAMMALIAN REMAINS

Of the 26 mammalian remains, 25 fragments (96 percent) are attributed to one or more mediumsized mammals that could not be identified more specifically. Of identified medium-sized mammals
occurring on prehistoric sites in this region, white-tailed deer is by far the most common. Other
possible species that occurred in the area prehistorically include black bear, canines, or postprehistoric animals of European origin such as sheep, goats, or swine. The medium-sized mammal
bone fragments include 24 longbone diaphyseal fragments and 1 cranial fragment and the
remaining 24 bones are longbone diaphyseal fragments. The only other mammalian bone fragment
identified is a longbone diaphyseal fragment from a small mammal.

REPTILE REMAINS

The three reptile specimens identified are turtle carapace or plastern fragments that could not be
identified more specifically.

CULTURAL MODIFICATION
The only evidence of cultural modification in the faunal assemblage from 41HS915 is burning,
which is present on nine bone fragments, or 14 percent of the total assemblage. Evidence of other
types of cultural modification such as butchering marks or spiral fracturing to extract marrow were
not identifiable because of the intensive degradation that the faunal remains have undergone. No
other cultural modification is apparent on any of the specimens.

CERAMIC PETROGRAPHY

Introduction
The petrographic analysis of ceramic sherds from the Hawkwind (41HS915), Resch (41HR16), and
Folly (41RK26) sites was performed to compare the ceramics from each site in terms of the
composition and grain‐size distribution of the natural inclusions and purposefully added temper in
the paste. The samples selected for petrographic analysis were chosen following the examination of
the total ceramic assemblage from Hawkwind and Folly, and selected sherds from Resch. During
that analysis, the technological attributes of each sherd in the analyzed sample was examined under
10X binocular magnification, and typologically distinct sherds were identified. Untyped utility and
fine ware sherds with distinctive paste constituencies and/or surface treatment modes were also
noted. Upon completion of the analysis, representative samples from this group were chosen for the
petrographic analysis, with 20 sherds selected from Hawkwind, 17 from Resch, and 2 from Folly
(Table C‐1).

Methods

The methods employed in this study closely follow those developed by Atkins analysts to evaluate
ceramics at other sites in the northeast Texas (Reese‐Taylor 1993; Rogers 2010; Skokan and
Perttula 1998). The methods employed are designed to produce descriptions of the ceramic thin
sections that are detailed, quantified, and replicable. The analysis followed the definitions provided
by Shepard (1976:25) and Rice (1987:411) in which nonplastics in the paste refer to tempering
inclusions and naturally occurring inclusions.
The presence or absence of tempering materials such as sand, grog (crushed fired ceramics), and
bone typically define the paste composition of ceramics. Of these materials, sand remains
problematical as it is difficult to distinguish naturally occurring sand from sand intentionally added
as temper. Thus no attempt is made here to distinguish one from the other. Past studies have relied
on characteristics of the mineral suite to help determine whether constituents were intentionally
added. Rice (1987:411) noted that grain shape and size can sometimes be useful indicators. If
larger‐sized sand grains were crushed before adding as temper, the grains would appear angular in
contrast to the smaller, rounded grains naturally occurring in the paste. Rice also notes that these
are merely guidelines, and it may be impossible to distinguish natural and added inclusions.
Skokan‐Switek (2005) in her petrographic analysis of ceramics from the Oak Hill Village site
(41RK214) in Rusk County, Texas, noted that most naturally occurring nonplastics are typically
smaller than 0,125 millimeters (mm) (very fine sand and smaller). Neff (et al. 1988) found that the
“real world proportion” or amount of a component is typically less than about 30 percent.

Appendix C, Cont’d
As will be seen in the following sample descriptions from the Hawkwind, Resch, and Folly sites,
nonplastics larger than 0.125 mm are quite common and often occur in percentages that exceed
30 percent. Thus, in addition to bone and grog being used as temper, sand may well have been
utilized. However, given the sandy nature of the soils in east Texas, clay sources are likely to have a
considerable admixture of sand sizes. An analysis of raw clay sources would be of great benefit in
addressing this issue. One sample (Sample 41HS16-8) retrieved in the 1960s from an upland source
in the vicinity of the Resch site is described in this study, but many others are needed. Interestingly,
INAA of the clay sample found it to be typical of clays in the region and a possible source for pottery
from the three sites. Unfortunately, INAA does not consider the size of mineral constituents in
pottery, and thus those findings cannot be applied to the issue of sand temper vs. sandy paste. It is
recommended that in future investigations efforts be made to secure additional raw clay samples
from a variety of geomorphological settings in both upland and floodplain environments. The
mineral suite in the examined samples is composed almost entirely of monocrystalline quartz,
though lesser amounts of chert, feldspar, polycrystalline quartz, and muscovite were also noted.
Only those grains larger than 0.06 mm were counted or measured, as grains smaller than 0.06 mm
fall within the silt size ranges and are considered to be a natural part of the paste or groundmass.
Opaque grains occur in several sherds. This substance may be hematite and/or organics but is
simply listed as opaque material.

Thin sections were prepared by Spectrum Petrographics. Each thin section consisted of a prepared
slide containing a single ceramic sherd oriented perpendicular to the vessel wall. The samples were
impregnated with blue-dyed epoxy and ground to a standard thickness of 0.03 mm. An Olympus
BH-2 polarizing microscope was used in the thin-section analysis. Initially, each slide was scanned
and evaluated for general composition and porosity characteristics and using a 4x objective. A point
count, intended to statistically quantify the composition of each sample, was then made using a 10x
objective. Ideally a 200-grain count was made, though some of the specimens were too small for
this total to be obtained. During the point count, the thin section was advanced 0.5 to 1 mm, and the
points along a line were counted. Following the point count, the long axis of 40 randomly selected
grains was measured.

Descriptive Petrography
Hawkwind (41HS915)

Twenty sherds were selected from the 41HS915 ceramic assemblage for petrographic analysis
(Figures C-1 and C-2). Four of the thin sections made from the sherds were too thick to cut for
analysis. The remaining 16 thin sections were examined and are described below.

Summary

Ceramic petrography was performed on selected sherds from the Hawkwind, Resch, and Folly sites.
The analysis included grain counts and grain-size measurements. The following summary, focusing
on mineral constituents, grain size, and temper is provided for the ceramic petrography of the three
sites.

Mineral Constituents
Quartz

Measurable quartz was the predominant mineral and was identified in every sample from each of
the three sites. It occurs primarily in monocrystalline form, with only traces of polycrystalline
quartz. At Hawkwind quartz ranges from 5 to 47 percent (mean = 24.75 percent). The minimum
average quartz grain size for any of the samples at Hawkwind was 0.126 mm (fine sand) obtained
in Sample 41HS915-6 (Lot 82.1). The maximum average quartz size at the site is 0.293 mm
(medium sand) obtained in samples 41HS915-11 (Lot 80.7) and 41HS915-16 (Lot 132.2). The mean
grain size for the quartz in all of the Hawkwind samples is 0.196 mm, which is within the fine sand
size range.

Quartz at Resch varies from 3 to 35 percent (mean = 18.25 percent). The minimum average quartz
grain size at Resch is 0.154 mm (fine sand) obtained in sample 41HS16-16 (Lot E4-S7-7). The
maximum average quartz grain size at the site is 0.398 mm (medium sand) obtained in sample
41HS16-13. The mean grain size for quartz in all of the analyzed thin sections at Resch is near the
upper limit of fine sand at 0.224 mm.

The two thin sections examined from Folly contained quartz at averages of 10 and 33 percent. The
minimum average quartz grain size was 0.225 mm (medium sand) in sample 41RK26-2
(Lot RK26-38). The largest average quartz grain size of 0.326 mm (medium sand) was obtained in
sample 41RK26-1 (Lot RK26-43).

Chert
Chert plays a minor role as a constituent in the mineral suites at the three sites. At Hawkwind it was
recorded as a counted grain in nine (56.25 percent) of the samples, where it ranged from 1 to
4 percent. It was recorded as a trace mineral in four of the remaining thin sections. At Resch chert
was counted in 12 (70.5 percent) of the samples and ranged from 1 to 6 percent. It appeared as a
trace mineral in four of the remaining samples. It was found in one of the two thin sections from
Folly.

Trace Minerals

In addition to chert, measurable (i.e., greater than silt sized) examples of feldspar, muscovite, and
opaque material were often observed. At Hawkwind, feldspar occurred as a trace mineral in five
(31.35 percent) of the samples, muscovite was seen in six (37.5 percent) of the samples, and
opaque material was noted in three (18.75 percent) of the samples. At Resch, feldspar occurred in
seven (43.75 percent) of the samples, and muscovite and opaque material each occurred in two
samples (12.5 percent). At Folly, feldspar was observed in one thin section.

Temper

The two primary temper types observed in the examined thin sections were grog and bone. The
identification of sand as a temper type was not attempted because of the poorly defined criteria for
recognizing sand intentionally added as temper from naturally occurring sandy paste.

Grog is present in 8 (50 percent) of the samples from 41HS915. At Resch it occurred in 12
(75 percent) of the samples, though only as a trace element in 2 samples. It occurred in both
samples from Folly, but was trace only.
Bone was found in nine (56.25 percent) of the thin sections made from sherds from 41HS915. In
two of these it was a trace element. Samples from Resch with bone totaled seven, or 43.75 percent.
Bone was found in one (50 percent) of the Folly samples.

The thin sections from the three sites displayed similar characteristics in their mineral inclusions,
and temper. Differences in the percentages of various constituents’ assemblages were relatively
minor. The only measurable difference between the assemblages was in overall grain size of quartz,
which at Resch and Folly was in or near the medium sand size, while 41HS915 was smaller,
contained almost entirely within the fine sand grain size.

INSTRUMENT NEUTRON ACTIVATION ANALYSIS (INAA)
by Jeffrey R. Ferguson and Michael D. Glascock

Introduction
This report describes the preparation, analysis, and interpretation of 37 pottery samples from two
sites in Harrison County, an additional 2 pottery samples from Rusk County, Texas, and a single clay
sample from near 41HS16 (see Figures C-1, C-2, C-5, and C-6). The goals of the research were to
examine both the internal compositional variability with the hope of determining local production
signatures as well as compare these samples to the larger east Texas Caddo database. Sample IDs
and some basic descriptive information are provided in Table C-2.

The University of Missouri Research Reactor (MURR) has a large sample of data from Caddo
ceramics from east Texas, primarily submitted by Tim Perttula; however, this region exhibits
remarkable uniformity in raw clay composition over vast areas. This uniformity in the chemical
composition of the raw materials has limited the potential for INAA to distinguish likely ceramic
production locations (Ferguson et al. 2008). The current samples fit the usual Caddo pattern of
minimal patterned variability; thus, it is not surprising to find little difference among the samples
from the three sites. The samples from this project show similarity to one of the two main groups
established for the region.

Sample Preparation

Pottery samples were prepared for INAA using procedures standard at MURR. Fragments of about
1 square centimeter (cm2) were removed from each sample and abraded using a silicon carbide
burr in order to remove glaze, slip, paint, and adhering soil, thereby reducing the risk of measuring
contamination. The samples were washed in deionized water and allowed to dry in the laboratory.
Once dry, the individual sherds were ground to powder in an agate mortar to homogenize the
samples. Archival samples were retained from each sherd (when possible) for future research.

Two analytical samples were prepared from each source specimen. Portions of approximately
150 milligrams (mg) of powder were weighed into clean high-density polyethylene vials used for
short irradiations at MURR. At the same time, 200 mg of each sample was weighed into high-purity
quartz vials used for long irradiations. Individual sample weights were recorded to the nearest
0.01 mg using an analytical balance. Both vials were sealed prior to irradiation. Along with the
unknown samples, Standards made from National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST)
certified standard reference materials of SRM-1633b (coal fly ash) and SRM-688 (basalt rock) were
similarly prepared, as were quality control samples (e.g., standards treated as unknowns) of SRM278 (obsidian rock) and Ohio Red Clay (a standard developed for in-house applications).

Irradiation and Gamma-Ray Spectroscopy
Neutron activation analysis of ceramics at MURR, which consists of two irradiations and a total of
three gamma counts, constitutes a superset of the procedures used at most other INAA laboratories
(Glascock 1992; Neff 1992, 2000). As discussed in detail by Glascock (1992), a short irradiation is
carried out through the pneumatic tube irradiation system. Samples in the polyvials are
sequentially irradiated, two at a time, for 5 seconds by a neutron flux of 8 x 1013 n cm-2 s-1 The
720-second count yields gamma spectra containing peaks for nine short-lived elements: aluminum
(Al), barium (Ba), calcium (Ca), dysprosium (Dy), potassium (K), manganese (Mn), sodium (Na),
titanium (Ti), and vanadium (V). The samples are encapsulated in quartz vials and are subjected to
a 24–hour irradiation at a neutron flux of 5 x 1013 n cm-2 s-1. This long irradiation is analogous to the
single irradiation utilized at most other laboratories. After the long irradiation, samples decay for
7 days, and then are counted for 1,800 seconds (the “middle count”) on a high-resolution
germanium detector coupled to an automatic sample changer. The middle count yields
determinations of seven medium half-life elements, namely arsenic (As), lanthanum (La), lutetium
(Lu), neodymium (Nd), samarium (Sm), uranium (U), and ytterbium (Yb). After an additional threeor four-week decay, a final count of 8,500 seconds is carried out on each sample. The latter
measurement yields the following 17 long half-life elements: cerium (Ce), cobalt (Co), chromium
(Cr), cesium (Cs), europium (Eu), iron (Fe), hafnium (Hf), nickel (Ni), rubidium (Rb), antimony (Sb),
scandium (Sc), strontium (Sr), tantalum (Ta), terbium (Tb), thorium (Th), zinc (Zn), and zirconium
(Zr). The element concentration data from the three measurements are tabulated in parts per
million (ppm).

Interpreting Chemical Data

The analyses at MURR, described above, produced elemental concentration values for 33 elements
in most of the analyzed samples. Data for Ni in many samples was below detection limits (as is the
norm for most New World ceramics) and was removed from consideration during the statistical
analysis. Calcium levels were found to be high enough (up to 7.4 percent) in many specimens to
require a calcium correction of the dataset. Because calcium has the potential to affect (dilute) the
concentrations of other elements in the analysis, all samples were mathematically corrected to
compensate for any possible calcium included effects (the data were examined before and after
Atkins 100018032/120087

Appendix C, Cont’d
calcium correction and the results were similar). The following mathematical correction was used
as it has been proven to be effective in other calcium-rich datasets (Cogswell et al. 1998:64;
Steponaitis et al. 1996):

e' =

106 e
106 − 2.5c

where e′ is the corrected concentration of a given element in ppm, e is the measured concentration
of that element in ppm, and c is the concentration of elemental calcium in ppm. After the calcium
correction, calcium was generally removed from the statistical analyses. Statistical analysis was
subsequently carried out on base-10 logarithms of concentrations on the remaining 31 elements.
Use of log concentrations rather than raw data compensates for differences in magnitude between
the major elements, such as calcium, on one hand and trace elements, such as the rare earth or
lanthanide elements (REEs). Transformation to base-10 logarithms also yields a more normal
distribution for many trace elements.

The interpretation of compositional data obtained from the analysis of archeological materials is
discussed in detail elsewhere (e.g., Baxter and Buck 2000; Bieber et al. 1976; Bishop and Neff 1989;
Glascock 1992; Harbottle 1976; Neff 2000) and is summarized here. The main goal of data analysis
is to identify distinct homogeneous groups within the analytical database. Based on the provenance
postulate of Weigand et al. (1977), different chemical groups may be assumed to represent
geographically restricted sources. For lithic materials such as obsidian, basalt, and cryptocrystalline
silicates (e.g., chert, flint, or jasper), raw material samples are frequently collected from known
outcrops or secondary deposits, and the compositional data obtained on the samples is used to
define the source localities or boundaries. The locations of sources can also be inferred by
comparing unknown specimens (i.e., ceramic artifacts) to knowns (i.e., clay samples) or by indirect
methods such as the “criterion of abundance” (Bishop et al. 1982) or by arguments based on
geological and sedimentological characteristics (e.g., Steponaitis et al. 1996). The ubiquity of
ceramic raw materials usually makes it impossible to sample all potential “sources” intensively
enough to create groups of knowns to which unknowns can be compared. Lithic sources tend to be
more localized and compositionally homogeneous in the case of obsidian or compositionally
heterogeneous as is the case for most cherts.
Compositional groups can be viewed as “centers of mass” in the compositional hyperspace
described by the measured elemental data. Groups are characterized by the locations of their
centroids and the unique relationships (i.e., correlations) between the elements. Decisions about
whether to assign a specimen to a particular compositional group are based on the overall
probability that the measured concentrations for the specimen could have been obtained from that
group.

Atkins 100018032/120087

C-24

Appendix C, Cont’d
Initial hypotheses about source-related subgroups in the compositional data can be derived from
noncompositional information (e.g., archeological context, decorative attributes, etc.) or from
application of various pattern-recognition techniques to the multivariate chemical data. Some of the
pattern recognition techniques that have been used to investigate archeological data sets are
cluster analysis (CA), principal components analysis (PCA), and discriminant analysis (DA). Each of
the techniques has its own advantages and disadvantages, which may depend upon the types and
quantity of data available for interpretation.
The variables (measured elements) in archeological and geological data sets are often correlated
and frequently large in number. This makes handling and interpreting patterns within the data
difficult. Therefore, it is often useful to transform the original variables into a smaller set of
uncorrelated variables in order to make data interpretation easier. Of the above-mentioned
pattern-recognition techniques, PCA is a technique that transforms the data from the original
correlated variables into uncorrelated variables most easily.

PCA creates a new set of reference axes arranged in decreasing order of variance subsumed. The
individual principal components are linear combinations of the original variables. The data can be
displayed on combinations of the new axes, just as they can be displayed on the original elemental
concentration axes. PCA can be used in a pure pattern-recognition mode, i.e., to search for
subgroups in an undifferentiated data set, or in a more evaluative mode, i.e., to assess the coherence
of hypothetical groups suggested by other criteria. Generally, compositional differences between
specimens can be expected to be larger for specimens in different groups than for specimens in the
same group, and this implies that groups should be detectable as distinct areas of high point density
on plots of the first few components. It is well known that PCA of chemical data is scale dependent
(Mardia et al. 1979), and analyses tend to be dominated by those elements or isotopes for which the
concentrations are relatively large. This is yet another reason for the log transformation of the data.

One frequently exploited strength of PCA, discussed by Baxter (1992), Baxter and Buck (2000), and
Neff (1994, 2002), is that it can be applied as a simultaneous R- and Q-mode technique, with both
variables (elements) and objects (individual analyzed samples) displayed on the same set of
principal-component reference axes. A plot using the first two principal components as axes is
usually the best possible two-dimensional representation of the correlation or variance-covariance
structure within the data set. Small angles between the vectors from the origin to variable
coordinates indicate strong positive correlation; angles at 90 degrees indicate no correlation; and
angles close to 180 degrees indicate strong negative correlation. Likewise, a plot of sample
coordinates on these same axes will be the best two-dimensional representation of Euclidean
relations among the samples in log-concentration space (if the PCA was based on the variancecovariance matrix) or standardized log-concentration space (if the PCA was based on the
correlation matrix). Displaying both objects and variables on the same plot makes it possible to
observe the contributions of specific elements to group separation and to the distinctive shapes of
the various groups. Such a plot is commonly referred to as a “biplot” in reference to the
Atkins 100018032/120087

C-25

Appendix C, Cont’d
simultaneous plotting of objects and variables. The variable interrelationships inferred from a
biplot can be verified directly by inspecting bivariate elemental concentration plots. (Note that a
bivariate plot of elemental concentrations is not a biplot.)
Whether a group can be discriminated easily from other groups can be evaluated visually in two
dimensions or statistically in multiple dimensions. A metric known as the Mahalanobis distance (or
generalized distance) makes it possible to describe the separation between groups or between
individual samples and groups on multiple dimensions. The Mahalanobis distance of a specimen
from a group centroid (Bieber et al. 1976; Bishop and Neff 1989) is defined by:

Dy2, X =
[ y − X ]t I x [ y − X ]

where y is the 1 x m array of logged elemental concentrations for the specimen of interest, X is the
n x m data matrix of logged concentrations for the group to which the point is being compared, with
X being its 1 x m centroid, and I x is the inverse of the m x m variance-covariance matrix of group
X. Because Mahalanobis distance takes into account variances and covariances in the multivariate
group, it is analogous to expressing distance from a univariate mean in standard deviation units.
Like standard deviation units, Mahalanobis distances can be converted into probabilities of group
membership for individual specimens. For relatively small sample sizes, it is appropriate to base
probabilities on Hotelling’s T 2 , which is the multivariate extension of the univariate Student’s t .
When group sizes are small, Mahalanobis distance-based probabilities can fluctuate dramatically
depending upon whether or not each specimen is assumed to be a member of the group to which it
is being compared. Harbottle (1976) calls this phenomenon “stretchability” in reference to the
tendency of an included specimen to stretch the group in the direction of its own location in
elemental concentration space. This problem can be circumvented by cross-validation, that is, by
removing each specimen from its presumed group before calculating its own probability of
membership (Baxter 1994; Leese and Main 1994). This is a conservative approach to group
evaluation that may sometimes exclude true group members.

Small sample and group sizes place further constraints on the use of Mahalanobis distance: with
more elements than samples, the group variance-covariance matrix is singular, thus rendering
calculation of I x (and D 2 itself) impossible. Therefore, the dimensionality of the groups must
somehow be reduced. One approach would be to eliminate elements considered irrelevant or
redundant. The problem with this approach is that the investigator’s preconceptions about which
elements should be discriminate may not be valid. It also squanders the main advantage of
multielement analysis, namely the capability to measure a large number of elements. An alternative
approach is to calculate Mahalanobis distances with the scores on principal components extracted
from the variance-covariance or correlation matrix for the complete data set. This approach entails
only the assumption, entirely reasonable in light of the above discussion of PCA, that most groupseparating differences should be visible on the first several PCs. Unless a data set is extremely

Atkins 100018032/120087

C-26

Appendix C, Cont’d
complex, containing numerous distinct groups, using enough components to subsume at least
90 percent of the total variance in the data can be generally assumed to yield Mahalanobis distances
that approximate Mahalanobis distances in full elemental concentration space.
Lastly, Mahalanobis distance calculations are also quite useful for handling missing data (Sayre
1975). When many specimens are analyzed for a large number of elements, it is almost certain that
a few element concentrations will be missed for some of the specimens. This occurs most
frequently when the concentration for an element is near the detection limit. Rather than eliminate
the specimen or the element from consideration, it is possible to substitute a missing value by
replacing it with a value that minimizes the Mahalanobis distance for the specimen from the group
centroid. Thus, those few specimens that are missing a single concentration value can still be used
in group calculations.

Results

As is typical for east Texas Caddo ceramics, there is limited compositional patterning. This difficulty
recently led to the attempt by Jeff Ferguson and Tim Perttula to reanalyze the entire east Texas
Caddo database (Ferguson et al. 2008). The reanalysis was moderately successful at finding core
groups for each of the 11 subregions that divided the area (Figure C-9), but there was such
significant overlap between the core groups that it is rare to confidently assign unknown samples to
a likely production region. The attempt to project these new data from Harrison and Rusk Counties
against the east Texas Caddo database as well as the larger MURR ceramic database is described
below, but first internal variability and differences among the samples from the three sites is
addressed.

Internal Compositional Variability

Treating these new data as an isolated dataset is complicated by the small number of samples, but
an attempt was made to find some internal variability and assess this variability relative to the site.

There are no obvious compositional differences among the assemblages from the three sites
(Figure C-10); however, a cluster of similar samples that is primarily from 41HS915 (Figure C-11)
and that is most apparent in plots of chromium and other transition metals was identified. None of
the samples from 41RK26 belong to Group A, but four samples (22 percent) from 41HS16 and eight
samples (45 percent) from 41HS915 are assigned to the group.

Comparison with the East Texas Caddo Database

As described previously, the East Texas Caddo database has been the focus of a recent study
(Ferguson et al. 2008). This reinterpretation did not result in the determination of region-specific
production areas as initially hoped, with the possible exception of material from the northern

portion of the study area along the Red River. Figure C-9 is the subregional map used by Ferguson
et al. (2008). The sample sizes of the subregions vary considerably. Region 7 includes Harrison and
Rusk Counties and has one of the largest samples and includes both a large core group and a second
group (Group 1) that separate slightly in chromium concentrations. Unfortunately, almost all of the
subregional core groups almost completely overlap with each other, with the notable exception of
Subregions 1 and 2. In order to facilitate the comparison with the east Texas Caddo subregional
groups, the new data were calcium corrected and concentrations for Ni, Sr, and Ca were removed.

These six subregions are considered together here because they all have very similar core groups
and they all have sufficient number of samples to allow the projection of group membership
probabilities using almost all of the elements (Na, Al, K, and Ti were not included). Subregion 7

The ellipse represents a 90% confidence level for membership in the group.
Group 1 also had a large number of group members, so it is also included in the comparison. These
groups represent the most challenging portion of the east Texas Caddo database reanalysis project
because of the overlap. At this point it is difficult to address how much of this overlap is due to
large-scale similarities in the clay deposits, the use of grog temper, and/or long-distance exchange
of vessels. As shown in Table C-3, there are almost no samples with a high probability of
membership in only one of these subregional core groups. There is clearly a stronger similarity
between these new samples and the Subregion 7 Group 1. This group is slightly separate from the
Region 7 Core Group and this minimal overlap is apparent in Table C-3. Interestingly, the groups
with the second and third greatest similarity are the two core groups from farther up the Sabine
River drainage. Ferguson et al. (2008) note the possibility of a chromium gradient in the drainage
with increasing levels downstream, but this has yet to be confirmed by studies of the regional clays.

are more likely produced within the region than the samples with higher affinity to the subregional
core groups from Subregions 5 and 6.

Long-term Resource Use
The samples included in this study predate the majority of samples included in the east Texas
Caddo database. Unfortunately, there are no temporally comparable samples from Woodland
contexts in the region. The similarity of these older samples with the later Caddo ceramics suggests
the use of similar raw materials and paste preparation techniques, but it is important to keep in

analyzed to date. There does appear to be slightly greater variability in the Woodland samples
when compared to all of the Caddo samples from Subregion 7 (see Figure C-12).

Clay Sample Comparison

One sample (LWE081) included in this study is a raw clay sample found among archival materials
from site 41HS16. The clays throughout the region (east Texas) tend to be very chemically similar,
and this, combined with the use of bone and grog temper, results in large overlapping groups. All of
the samples have been adjusted to eliminate the compositional contribution of the calcium-based
temper; thus, most local clays will likely match most local sherds. This match is clearly the case with
this single clay sample. Not only do the samples from both 41HS915 and 41HS16 overlap, but the
clay fits well within this range of variation. The clay sample (LWE081) does have elevated Cr and
Zn, but still within the range of variation for the sherds in this sample.

Conclusions

The interpretation of Caddo compositional data is complicated by three major factors: (1) the largescale similarity of raw clays in the region, (2) the frequent use of grog as temper, and (3) the likely
frequent long-distance trade of morphologically similar pottery throughout the region. These
factors all contribute to the difficulty in identifying the areas of production at multiple scales.
Although these samples predate the samples in the east Texas Caddo database, this is the only
material that shows any similarity in a Euclidian search of the MURR master database. The
similarity among the new samples and the main group from the subregion has been demonstrated,
and it is suggested that there is a dominant affiliation with samples from Subregion 7 and a more
general similarity to the samples from the Sabine River drainage. Interestingly, the Woodland
period samples included here show slightly greater compositional variability than the later Caddo
samples from an even larger area, suggesting increased movement of ceramics and/or greater
variability in raw material.
We acknowledge Tim Ferguson for his role in preparing the samples for irradiation.

Microwear Analysis of Selected Stone Tools

Appendix D: Microwear Analysis of Stone Tools
by Marilyn Shoberg, Digital Microscopy Laboratory
The University of Texas at Austin

The chipped stone tools from the Hawkwind site, 41HS915, submitted for microwear analysis
included 80 tools entitled “Complex and Core Detachment-based Tools” and 101 projectile points.
The analysis was conducted at TARL between January 18 and June 4, 2012.

The functional analysis of the stone tools in this report follows the traceological method pioneered
by Semenov (1964), comparing a complex of wear traces including edge damage, polishes, and
striations on archeological specimens to those on experimental tool analogs. This general approach
was enhanced by the rigorous approach to experimentation and microwear analysis developed by
Keeley (1980) who detailed the visual attributes of polish and related the orientation of striations
to the kinematics of tool motion using relatively high magnification. The comprehensive
experimental microwear project of Vaughn (1985) is a valuable resource. Impact wear traces on
projectile points are described by Dockall (1997).
Ultimately, the interpretation of wear traces on archeological stone tools is made by comparison
with wear traces on experimental tools used on a variety of contact materials, and using the same
microscope and optics.

All 80 lithic tools in this sample were scanned at a magnification of 10x, and notes were made on
tool form, visible polish, edge flaking, or probable areas of wear. The sample for high-magnification
microwear analysis was reduced by the elimination of projectile point fragments, artifacts of
metaquartzite or other crystalline raw materials, and cobble fragments with no visible wear at low
magnification. The sample selected for high-magnification microwear analysis from the tool
category consists of 41 lithic tools.

The microwear analysis of projectile points concentrated on 77 Gary dart points in this assemblage.
This group of artifacts was reduced to 39 points made of chert or novaculite.

The stone tools from this site are made from a variety of raw materials including chert cobbles,
metaquartzite, silicified wood, hematitic sandstone, novaculite, and quartz. Much of the raw
material is of relatively poor quality for making flaked stone tools. In particular, silicified wood
flakes off in sheets or in rectangular pieces that reflect the cellular structure of the original wood. In
the initial examination of the tools, it was not possible to distinguish microwear polish on the
crystalline surfaces of artifacts made of metaquartzite, quartz, and quartz arenite, so tools of those
materials were eliminated from the sample.

Appendix D, Cont’d
In this report the artifacts are identified by lot number, field specimen (FS) number, and an
additional number in parentheses, (1), (2), etc. to distinguish multiple artifacts with the same lot
and FS numbers, and this last number comes from their order on the original spreadsheet.

The total number of tools from 41HS915 analyzed at high magnification is 80, 41 tools and 39 Gary
dart points. All 41 tools are illustrated on Figures D-1, D-2, and D-3. The 39 Gary dart points are
illustrated later in this appendix as Figure D-42.

CHIPPED STONE TOOLS

The 41 tools were washed individually in plastic bags with a few drops of ammonia, suspended in
an ultrasonic water bath, rinsed in distilled water, and air dried. Drawings were made of both faces
of each artifact for recording the location of specific wear attributes such as edge flaking, polish, and
striations observed at magnifications between 50X and 500X using a reflected-light differentialinterference Olympus BH-2 microscope with Nomarski optics.

Artifact 51 (no FS No.) is a Harvey-Mineola biface tool made on a small thin cobble of silicified
wood (see Figure D-1). Both lateral edges are minimally bifacially flaked, with only one series of
flakes removed from each edge. Cortex remains on most of both faces and both ends of the artifact.
The longitudinal grain of the silicified wood is aligned with the long axis of the tool.

At high magnification, invasive polish extends from both retouched edges onto interior surfaces, on
ridges, and in flake scar depressions. Single striations with multidirectional orientations are in the
polish (Figure D-4). The surface characteristics and distribution of polish and orientation of
striations reflect cutting motions in soft tissue. Both lateral edges of this tool were used for cutting
animal tissue.

Figure D-4: Microwear Artifact 51. A crosshatch pattern of single striations
is in invasive polish on the lateral edge (Image 51 side 1b @ 500X).

Appendix D, Cont’d
Artifact 63-6 (2) is a small tool made on a small chert cobble (see Figure D-1). The raw material is
red and tan banded chert. One long edge of the cobble was bifacially flaked to produce a thin,
sinuous, sharp edge. Bifacial flaking just beyond the apex of each end produced sharpened
projections at both ends. Smooth cobble cortex remains opposite the cutting edge of the tool.

At high magnification, invasive polish is present along both faces of the utilized edge. The pointed
projection at one end is rounded, smoothed, and polished (Figure D-5). The invasive polish at both
tips and on projections along the flaked edge has a crosshatch pattern of single striations
characteristic of cutting soft tissue (Figure D-6). This is a small butchering tool used to cut and
pierce soft animal tissue.

Figure D-5: Microwear Artifact 63-6 (2). The pointed projection
at the end is rounded and polished from use
(Image 63-6 side 1a @ 50X).

striations are at the edge (right) of the projection

Appendix D, Cont’d
Artifact 74-16 is an indeterminate projectile point preform of brown chert (see Figure D-1). Cobble
cortex remains on the rounded base on both faces. The artifact has been bifacially thinned, but the
axial ridge has a marked curve so that the distal tip is considerably off center.
At high magnification, there is weak generic polish from handling on the axial ridge, but no wear
traces on the tip or lateral edges. The biface appears to be a preform for a dart point, and was
abandoned in manufacture. The biface was not used.

Artifact 80-27 (1) is a biface of brown chert with multiple flake scars and remnants of cobble
cortex on the dorsal surface (see Figure D-1). There is no edge flaking to indicate purposeful intent
in fashioning a tool.
At high magnification, there is slight abrasive polish on the bulb of percussion and no evidence of
use on any edges or ridges. The artifact was not used.

Artifact 80-30 (3) is a biface fragment of brown chert (see Figure D-1). It resembles the distal end
of a dart point. A transverse fracture runs through the body of the biface. Remnants of cobble cortex
are on both faces. There is some abrasion on ridges, but no wear traces on the tip, lateral edges, or
fracture edges. The artifact was not used.

Artifact 80-30 (4) is a core-based chert fragment of indeterminate form (see Figure D-1). The raw
material was a thin cobble of red chert, and cobble cortex remains on two faces and both ends of
this long, thin lithic fragment. There is slight high-point abrasion but no visible use of edges or
ridges at high magnification. The artifact was not used.

Artifact 80-30 (5) is a tool fragment made of silicified wood (see Figure D-1). It is relatively flat on
one surface and has a prominent ridge on the other. The rounded end has been thinned, and the
thicker end terminates in a smooth transverse fracture. The cross section at the fracture is
triangular. The form resembles a prismatic blade. The axis of the tool is parallel to the predominant
longitudinal grain of the silicified wood.

At high magnification, abrasive polish is visible on ridges on both faces of the tool fragment. The
longitudinally grooved cellular structure of the silicified wood is readily seen at a magnification of
500X (Figure D-7) at right. The general abrasive polish seen on ridges and high points is
distinguished from the overall pattern of the raw material. Very fine single striations (arrows) are
at oblique angles to the grooves in the raw material. The fine striations in abrasive polish are
consistent with finger abrasion while the tool was used.
The artifact appears to be the proximal fragment of a tool. The edges of the fracture surface were
not used after the break and discard of this fragment. Because the “working end” of the tool is
missing, the specific use cannot be determined.

Figure D-7: Microwear Artifact 80-30 (5)
(Image 80-30 (5) va @ 500X).
Artifact 80-30 (6) is the proximal fragment of a tool made of silicified wood (see Figure D-1). It is
similar to the artifact 80-30 (5) in form, flat on one surface, a prominent axial ridge on the other,
triangular in cross section, a rounded thinned proximal end, with the long axis of the tool parallel to
the longitudinal grain of the silicified wood. The smooth fracture plane is oblique to the long axis of
the tool. A pointed tip was left on one lateral edge after the fracture. At high magnification, invasive
polish is well-developed on this projection (Figure D-8).

Single striations in the polish are aligned both parallel and perpendicular to the tip, reflecting both
piercing and twisting motions (Figure D-9) below.
This artifact is the proximal end of a tool, and after fracture a fortuitous projection was used in both
piercing and twisting motions on soft animal tissue.

Artifact 80-30 (7) is a fragment of a tool of unknown form made of silicified wood (see Figure D-1).
The pointed tip has been thinned on the flat face. At high magnification, there are no wear traces on
the tip, lateral edges, fracture edges, or high points. This is not the utilized end of a tool.

Appendix D, Cont’d
Artifact 82-41 (2) is a complete biface of fine-grained brown chert (see Figure D-1). Cobble cortex
remains on the midline of one face and at the rounded end of the artifact. The opposite end on the
longitudinal axis of the biface was shaped to a blunt point. It is not clear if the artifact originally had
a longer tip. A thick stack on one face suggests incomplete thinning of the biface in the
manufacturing process. There are metal streaks on the narrow tip of the artifact on this domed face,
from the motorized screening device used in artifact recovery during excavation.
At high magnification, there is no evidence that the narrow tip or lateral edges were used. One
triangular facet on the rounded end of the biface, on side 1 (cobble cortex face), has very bright
smooth, textured, undulating polish wrapping over a ridge (Figures D-10 and D-11).

The small high point at the edge appears to have been used briefly to scrape wood. There is no
evidence that the edges or pointed tip were used. This may be an unfinished tool that was used
briefly for one task and then discarded.
Artifact 82-41 (3) is the proximal fragment of a tool made of silicified wood (see Figure D-1). It is
similar to artifacts 80-30 (5) and (6) in raw material and in form, with one flat surface, a prominent
ridge on the other, triangular cross section, and a thinned proximal end. The flat fracture plane is
approximately perpendicular to the long axis of the tool.

Polish is on the prominent midline ridge and on flake scar rises along the lateral edges of the
artifact (Figure D-12). Similar invasive polish is found on high points on the ventral surface. This
polish is equally well developed on all surfaces, not more well developed at the edges. This polish
over all high-point surfaces is interpreted as abrasive polish from handling. There are no striations
on the edges to indicate cutting or scraping use. This is the proximal end of a tool, and the fractured
edge did not have secondary use.
Artifact 82-41 (4) is a fragment of a unifacial tool made of light gray novaculite (see Figure D-1).
The artifact is roughly triangular in outline. The straight edge is the surviving utilized edge of the
tool. The two other edges are fractures. The form of the original complete tool is unknown. The
straight edge was thinned on the rounded dorsal face by the removal of a large flake. The origin and
termination of this flake are not visible on the fragment. Small shallow flakes originate at the edge
and are not continuous, patterned, or regular in shape. A few large and small shallow flakes on the
ventral flat surface may be intentional thinning, or the result of use. The corners where the tool
edge is terminated by fractures are sharp and appear unused. At high magnification, flake scars and
ridges along the retouched and utilized edge are rounded and smoothed (Figure D-13).

There are multidirectional striations in invasive polish along this edge (Figure D-14). One edge of
this fragment is the retouched edge of a tool of unknown form. This edge was used to cut soft
animal tissue. The edge does not have the intense rounding and patterned striations of a hide
scraper.

striations are in invasive polish along the retouched
edge of the tool (Image 82-41(4) da @ 500X). This
pattern is characteristic of cutting soft animal tissue.
Artifact 82-43 (1) is a fragment of a biface made of red chert (see Figure D-1). No evidence of use
was found on edges, ridges, projections, or the fracture edges. If this is a fragment of a utilized tool,
then this is not the utilized portion of the tool. This appears to be a fragment of an unfinished biface,
discarded after fracture in the manufacturing process, and this fragment was not used.

Artifact 82-43 (2) is a fragment of silicified wood (see Figure D-1). The fragmentary tools of
silicified wood in this assemblage tend to fracture along the longitudinal grain of the raw material
or cleanly across the grain. Both kinds of fracture reflect the cellular structure of the silicified wood.
This lithic fragment has both a longitudinal fracture and a cross-grain fracture and cortex from the
weathered surface of the raw material. The pointed tip of the artifact is most likely fortuitous and
not related to intentional tool manufacture. There is no evidence of use on this artifact, and no clear
evidence that it was intentionally manufactured to be a tool.

Artifact 83-36 is a crudely manufactured oval bifacial tool made on a chert cobble (see Figure D-1).
The cobble was split, and then more than half of the circumferential edge was bifacially flaked to
produce the sinuous edge characteristic of early stage biface reduction.

At high magnification, one area of the longer sinuous edge has the most evidence of use. Fine
multidirectional striations are in soft-tissue polish along with smooth sleeks from hard-tissue
contact on both sides of this edge (Figure D-15). This combination of soft- and hard-tissue contact
and multidirectional cutting motions is consistent with use of the edge in animal butchering
activities. No specific evidence of use was found on the highly reflective surfaces of crystals on the
narrow end of the cobble tool. This is a crude biface made on a chert cobble and was used as a
butchering tool.

sleeks from cutting hard tissue are visible in the
image at right (Image 83-36 @ 500X).
Artifact 88-53 is a small tool made on an irregular fragment of a chert cobble (see Figure D-1).
Cortex remains on two edges. The long edge opposite a remnant of cortex has been unifacially
thinned by the removal of five flakes.

At high magnification, the thinned edge is rounded, nicked, and polished (Figure D-16). Invasive
polish is relatively well-developed on both faces of the edge and corner, and both multidirectional
single striations and smooth sleeks are found in the polish (Figure D-17). The sleeks are from
contact with hard tissue, and invasive polish on high and low microtopography of the chert surface
is from contact with soft animal tissue. This combination of wear attributes is characteristic of use
in butchering activities.
Artifact 88-54 (1) is a small tool on a flake of silicified wood (see Figure D-1). The outline is
roughly rectangular. Three edges have been shaped by the removal of flakes, and the fourth edge is
truncated by a transverse fracture. It is not clear if this break is after use. If the truncated end is
proximal, then the thinned end with a corner projection is distal.

At high magnification, there is well-developed polish on surfaces and edges around the distal end of
the tool. The features in this polish do not mirror the underlying grain of the silicified wood and are
clearly related to use. There is random microflaking along the utilized edges (Figure D-18).

Smooth sleeks from contact with hard tissue (Figure D-19) and multidirectional narrow deep
striations from grit particles dragged across the surface in cutting motions (Figure D-20), both in

with overlapping groups of striations reflecting multiple use events (Figure D-21). This small biface
is a well-used butchering tool.

Artifact 91-78 (1) is a biface of tan-brown chert (see Figure D-1). It has been bifacially thinned, is
relatively flat on one face, and thick and domed on the opposite face. Cortex remains on the blunt
end of the artifact. The biface appears unfinished, discarded in manufacture. The thick edge that has
not been systematically thinned has a crack or flaw in the chert, and this may have influenced the
decision to leave the tool unfinished. All edges and surfaces were examined at high magnification,
and there is no evidence that any part of the artifact was used.
Artifact 91-78 (2) is a biface made from a small thin chert cobble (see Figure D-1). Cobble cortex
remains on both faces and the proximal rounded end of the artifact. The red, crumbly interior may
be thermal damage from heat treatment of the raw material before attempted bifacial reduction.

At high magnification, abrasive polish is visible on flake scar ridges and diffuse generic polish is on
edges. The artifact has considerable surface abrasion from handling. No evidence of use was found
on edges or pointed tip. The artifact was not used.

Artifact 91-80 (2) is a biface made on a thick chunk of silicified wood (Figure D-2). Because edge
thinning flakes on this raw material come off in sheets that terminate in abrupt step fractures, the
finished artifact has a rugged stepped appearance from the edges inward to the thick central ridge.
Nevertheless, this artifact was successfully bifacially thinned, and a thin sinuous edge was produced
around the pointed distal end of the tool. The undulating surface of the raw material, silicified
wood, makes it difficult to capture photomicrographs at 500X with the entire field in focus;
nevertheless, it was clear during microscopic analysis that the observed striations do not mimic the
directional features in the cellular structure of the raw material.
At high magnification, multidirectional single striations are in invasive soft tissue polish on ridges
and edges on both faces around the pointed tip of the tool (Figure D-22). Embedded abrasive
particles are visible at the termination of some striations. The microwear evidence is consistent
with use in multidirectional cutting motions on soft animal tissue.
Artifact 93-86 (1) is a complete chert biface (see Figure D-2). Cortex remains on the flat base and
one face. The biface is crudely shaped, lacking bilateral and bifacial symmetry. At high
magnification, there is no evidence of use on any edges. This incomplete tool was not used.

Artifact 93-86 (2) is a fragment of a chert biface with continuous overlapping fine scalar retouch
flaking along one edge (see Figure D-2). The opposite face is almost flat. Cortex remains on the flat
base. An oblique fracture runs through the body of the biface. A spall on the flat face has the
cratered surface typical of thermal damage. One edge on the flat face has a small series of polished
auto retouch flaking typical of a utilized edge.
At high magnification, the area of auto retouch flaking has multidirectional striations in invasive
polish (Figure D-23). This pattern is characteristic of cutting soft animal tissue. The flake scars on
the intentionally retouched edge are smoothed and polished (Figure D-24).

Figure D-24: Microwear Artifact 93-86 (2). Multidirectional striations
are in invasive polish along this edge, characteristic of use in
cutting soft animal tissue (Image 93-86 da @ 50X).
The sequence of use events is difficult to reconstruct. The use of the intentionally retouched edge
may have been before the tool fractured. The thermal damage probably preceded the use of the tip.
The small tool was used to cut soft animal tissue.

Artifact 94-66 (1) is a small biface fragment of chert with a transverse fracture across the body
(see Figure D-2). Remnants of cobble cortex are on the base and both lateral edges. A large crystal
“flaw” in the chert is visible at the fracture, and may be the cause of the fracture. No microwear
evidence was found at high magnification on any peripheral edges or the fracture edges. The
artifact probably fractured during manufacture and was discarded. It was not used.

Artifact 94-66 (3) is a chunk of silicified wood that has been minimally shaped into a tool with a
thin pointed tip (see Figure D-2). At high magnification, there is well-developed invasive soft tissue
polish around the tip. A crosshatch pattern of multidirectional single striations is characteristic of
cutting motions (Figure D-25). This tool was used to cut soft animal tissue.
Artifact 98-61 is a fragment of a biface made of brown chert (see Figure D-2). Cortex remains on
one lateral edge, and an oblique fracture extends across the body of the biface. This appears to be a
manufacturing failure. All bifacial edges, fracture edges, and the projection produced by the fracture
were examined for evidence of use. No wear traces in the form of microflaking, polish, or abrasion
are present on any edges or surfaces. The biface fragment was not used.

Artifact 100-100 (1) is a large oval biface of medium brown silicified wood (see Figure D-2).
Remnants of cortex are on both faces and both ends. An investment in time and effort was made in
the manufacture of this tool from a raw material that is difficult to shape. Sharp bifacial edges are
rare because of the inherent tendency of the material to fracture in blocks.

Multidirectional single striations indicate cutting motions (Figures D-26 and D-27).

perpendicular and parallel to the edge are in invasive polish at the tip.
This pattern is characteristic of cutting motions in soft tissue
(Image 100-100 (1) side 2b @ 500X).
Similar evidence in the form of invasive polish and cutting striations is along one edge of the biface.
This tool was used to cut animal tissue. The thick middle of the biface precludes positioning the
high magnification objectives for photomicrographs on the lateral edges.

Artifact 100-100 (2) is a biface of dark brown silicified wood (see Figure D-2). Cortex is on one
face and on the thick straight “base” opposite the pointed tip. One lateral edge is made up of the
coarse crystals often seen in the interstitial spaces of silicified wood. The cellular structure of this
raw material as seen in Figure D-28 is highly reflective. Unless polish from use is very well
developed and has linear striations that clearly cut across the linear divisions between cells, then it
is virtually impossible to distinguish this polish on tools of silicified wood.
All edges were examined at high magnification for evidence of wear, but no clear wear traces were
found. This biface had no significant use.

Artifact 101-105 is a roughly triangular biface fragment made of very dark brown silicified wood
(see Figure D-2). A transverse fracture is across the body of the biface, and cortex is retained on one
face. The raw material has large areas composed of quartz crystals. The tip, lateral edges, and
fracture edges were examined at high magnification, and no wear traces were found. The biface was
not used.

Artifact 108-111 is the basal fragment of a biface made of heavy hematitic sandstone (see Figure
D-2). The tool has a complex history of use and misuse. Multiple fractures through the body of the
biface are visible at 10X (Figure D-29). This may be thermal damage. It seems unlikely that the
biface could have survived heavy impact use like adzing with the currently visible internal
fractures.

Patches of metallic residue are visible on edges and ridges all over both sides of the biface from the
motorized screening device used in the recovery of artifacts from this site. This residue looks like
polish but has a bright flat surface with long subparallel grooves and embedded abrasive particles
(Figure D-30).

Figure D-30: Microwear Artifact 108-111. Metal residue with
embedded abrasive particles is on ridges and high points
(Image 108-111 side 2 e @ 200X).
Although the artifact was cleaned in an ultrasonic bath before microwear analysis, sandy sediments
still adhered to surfaces and were certainly present during mechanical screening, so that there is
obvious recent surface abrasion, particularly on side 1 of the biface.
The biface has a transverse fracture across the body, bifacially shaped lateral edges, and a narrow
basal stem and one shoulder. The “old” lateral edges and the edges of the fracture plane are worn
smooth and polished (Figure D-31).

Despite the recent damage to the artifact in recovery that left metal residue on edges and surfaces,
the old wear traces are clear and indicate that the tool had significant use after the fracture. The
worn and smoothed edges have well-developed invasive polish crosscut by multidirectional sharp
single striations in the pattern typical of cutting motions (Figures D-32 and D-33).

The lateral edges and edges of the fracture are worn, polished, and striated from cutting soft and
hard animal tissue. The last prehistoric use of the tool is as a butchering tool. There is no evidence
to indicate how this tool may have been used before the transverse fracture across the body of the
biface.

Artifact 109-115 is a large biface with a roughly oval shape made of light yellow silicified wood
(see Figure D-2). One end is pointed, the other is rounded. The silicified wood is coarsely crystalline
in some places and laminate in others, so that a potentially useful bifacial edge was achieved at the
narrow ends; however, the midline mass was not removed. At high magnification, no wear traces in
the form of polish, edge flaking, or abrasion were found on this biface. The tool was not used.

Artifact 110-130 (2) is a fragment of a biface made of metaquartzite (see Figure D-2). Cobble
cortex is retained on the narrow tip. A transverse fracture runs across the thickest part of the
biface. A midline axial ridge is on one face. Random edge flakes are not associated with polish or
linear features. No wear traces were found at high magnification. The biface was not used. The axial
ridge and cortex on the thin narrow tip suggest that this may be the stem of a dart point.
Artifact 114-127 is a bifacial tool made on a cobble of brown chert (see Figure D-2). One edge was
bifacially flaked to produce a thin, sinuous, curved sharp edge. The rounded bottom surface of the
cobble tool is gone, and this may be recent damage, since the edges of this fracture are irregular and
very sharp.

Continuous fine auto retouch flaking is associated with well-developed polish along the bifacially
flaked working edge of the tool (Figure D-34). Multidirectional single striations are in invasive
polish on both faces of this edge (Figure D-35). Sleeks from contact with hard tissue were observed
on the utilized edge as well. This small tool was used as a butchering tool.

The narrow end is wedge shaped, and the opposite end is truncated by a transverse fracture. The
flat side of the tool is very coarse-grained sandstone. The edges and ridges are relatively sharp.
Typically, an adze has polish on ridges at the working or bit end, but no such evidence is present on
this tool.

A circular hole is in the center of the domed side of the biface. The sandstone below the surface here
is loose, so there are no visible clues as to how this hole was made. Speculatively, the tool could
have been placed on the end of a stick and secured with rope or cordage over the flat side and tied
below. This hole seems too shallow for that interpretation, but maybe it is an early-stage attempt.
The hole may just be an anomaly, but it begs for an explanation.

Several areas on the flat side of the biface have abrasive polish with multidirectional long deep
striations (Figure D-37). These smoothed areas may be related to how the tool was hafted. This
wear is not directly associated with use of the edges. This artifact is a purposefully shaped tool, very
likely used, but there is no microwear evidence of use on edges or ridges.

Artifact 116-120 (1) is the distal fragment of a chert biface (see Figure D-3). Cobble cortex
remains on one face. The lateral edges are sharp. A transverse fracture runs obliquely across the
body of the biface. At high magnification, there is no evidence that the tip or lateral edges or
fracture edges were used. The biface was not used. This appears to be a manufacturing failure.
Artifact 120-164 is a biface fragment of tan and red chert (see Figure D-3). A longitudinal fracture
extends from the tip through the base. Cobble cortex remains on the proximal end on both faces.
The artifact has been bifacially thinned on the distal half of the surviving lateral edge. A sharp tip is
left at the distal end. At high magnification, there is no evidence that the tip, lateral edge, or fracture
edges were used. This fragment is likely a manufacturing failure and was not used.

Artifact 120-165 (2) is a well-made biface of silicified wood (see Figure D-3). The biface tapers
and thins to a fine point at one end, and is truncated by a transverse snap fracture. At high
magnification, the long linear features observed around the pointed tip are the intrinsic cellular
structures in silicified wood. No high-point abrasive polish or edge-wear traces are visible on this
artifact. The biface has no evidence of use. The function of these well-made pointed bifaces with
transverse fractures made of silicified wood is one of the unsolved mysteries of the tools from this
site.
Artifact 125-156 is a biface of brown chert (see Figure D-3). The raw material looks weathered,
degraded, and may be just beneath the exterior surface of a cobble. It has poor flaking qualities with
unpredictable results. The biface is rounded at one end and has an irregular fracture at the other
end. At high magnification, there is some abrasive polish on ridges, but no visible wear traces on the
rounded end. The minimal abrasive polish is likely from handling during manufacture. The biface
was not used.

Artifact 132-183 is a biface fragment of reddish-tan silicified wood (see Figure D-3). One narrow
end is rounded with smoothed, abraded step-fracture flake scars. One lateral edge is a sharp
longitudinal fracture parallel to the grain of the silicified wood. The other narrow end is a
transverse fracture, and the remaining thin lateral edge appears to be a thermal fracture.

One face of the artifact is very smooth with coarse multidirectional abrasive scratches over the
surface (Figure D-38). The abrasive scratches do not extend down into the flake scars on this
surface. The opposite face has the glossy, irregular, bubbly surface characteristic of thermal
damage. The fractured surfaces are dull, not polished, and have no evidence of use.

Figure D-38: Microwear Artifact 132-183. Coarse multidirectional scratches are
on this face (Image 132-183 side 1a @ 50X).
The origin of the very smooth abraded surface is unclear. It may be the exterior surface of a streamrolled cobble, or the stone may have been used as an abrader. The three fractured surfaces limit the
analytical assessment of this fragment. If this is a purposefully shaped tool, then the complete form
is unknown. None of the edges that resulted from fracture events were used.
The use of this biface is indeterminate. It may have been some kind of abrader, but without the
complete tool, this assessment is speculative.

Artifact 136-228 (1) is a biface made on a small chert cobble (see Figure D-3). Cobble cortex
remains on the rounded base on both faces and extends to the pointed tip on one face. There has
been some bifacial thinning of both lateral edges. This may be a preform for a dart point or a cobble
cutting tool similar to artifact 63-6 in this assemblage. At high magnification, there is some highpoint abrasion on the axial ridge on one face, but no edge flaking or polish on the noncortical edges.
This biface was not used.

Artifact 136-228 (3) is a biface fragment of dark silicified wood (see Figure D-3). The coarsegrained, blocky raw material with large crystal inclusions has a natural sheen. Cracks extend
through the body of the artifact. This may be the base of a large dart point. There are no obvious

wear traces on the edges at 10X. At high magnification, there is some high‐point abrasion but no
evidence that the lateral edges or the fracture edges were used. The biface fragment was not used.

Artifact 142‐241 (2) is a complete small biface of fine‐grained brown chert (see Figure D‐3).
Microflaking with rounded, polished flake scars is visible on both lateral edges at a magnification of
10X (Figure D‐39). At high magnification, a crosshatch of multidirectional single sharp striations
are in invasive soft tissue polish along both lateral edges (Figures D‐40 and D‐41).

Summary
A sample of 41 chipped stone tools was selected for high-magnification microwear analysis from
the larger group after the initial 80 tools were scanned at 10X for the potential of evidence of
having been used. Of this sample, 16 were used and 25 were not used. Fourteen of the tools with
use-wear were used in butchering or cutting animal tissue. All 14 have evidence of cutting animal
tissue, and 7 of the 14 have clear evidence of contact with hard tissue as well. A butchering tool has
evidence for both soft and hard tissue contact. Artifact 88-54 (1), a small rectangular tool of
silicified wood, is the most well-used butchering tool in this assemblage.
Artifact 82-41 (2) is a small chert preform and was used very briefly for scraping wood with a high
point at the rounded end.

It is difficult to interpret the wear on Artifact 132-183, a very smooth fragment of silicified wood.
One face of the artifact is a thermal fracture, and one lateral edge and one end are truncated by
fractures. The oldest surface is smooth, polished, and striated and may have been some kind of
abrader, but the other fractured surfaces are not worn, so that the complete tool form is unknown.

There is a group of seven (80-30 [5], 80-30 [6], 80-30 [7], 82-41 [3], 100-100 [2], 101-105, 120-165
[2]) tools in this assemblage that are roughly triangular in outline made of silicified wood. They all
taper to a rounded thinned point at one end and are truncated by a transverse fracture at the
Atkins 100018032/120087

thicker end. Most have an axial ridge on one face and are relatively flat on the other. Six of the seven
are unused, and the tip of one was used to cut animal tissue. It is possible that they are the proximal
ends of larger tools, or what have been interpreted here as transverse fractures are the natural
breakage pattern of the raw material. It is possible to distinguish polish on other tools of silicified
wood, but the lack of use‐wear evidence on this group is a mystery.
While there is some animal food processing reflected in the stone tool assemblage, it appears that
manufacturing and retooling are primary activities at this site. Eight of the 41 tools examined are
manufacturing failures or discards, and 7 are judged to be preforms, so that altogether 15 artifacts
were discarded at some point in the manufacturing process.

GARY POINTS

The 77 Gary dart points were scanned at a magnification of 10X for evidence of microwear and
sorted into categories by raw material. The raw materials are chert, novaculite, silicified wood,
metaquartzite, quartz, and quartz arenite. The points made of silicified wood, metaquartzite, quartz,
and quartz arenite have highly reflective crystalline surfaces and are judged unsuitable for
microwear analysis since it is extremely difficult to visually distinguish microwear polish from the
crystalline facets in the raw material. The 39 Gary points made of chert or novaculite were analyzed
at high magnification for microwear attributes (Figures D‐42 and D‐43). Summaries stating that
points were used refer to utilization as a projectile point.
Gary point var. Emory 58 is a complete dart point made of tan chert (see Figure D‐42). The point is
comparatively small and thin in the range of Gary points in this assemblage. The basal surface is
cobble exterior surface. The distal lateral edges are sharp. Diagonal parallel oblique flaking on one
lateral edge on side 1 extends past the midline, left to right. The transverse fracture at the tip is
likely an impact fracture.

At high magnifications from 50X to 500X, no polish is found on distal ridges or the midline axis.
High‐point abrasion is present on the proximal or stem surfaces from the lateral shoulders to the
base. No polish or directional indicators are visible at high magnification.

Factors such as the small size of this point, the body to stem length ratio, and the impact fracture at
the tip suggest that the point was used and resharpened. No microscopic evidence of the last use
survives on the point.

Gary point var. Hobson 63‐7 is a small complete dart point made on a flake of fine‐grained brown
chert. A remnant of cobble cortex remains on the midline of the rounded side of the point, the
dorsal side of the parent flake (see Figure D‐42). The flat ventral surface has had minimal edge
flaking. The distal tip is gone, a probable impact fracture, with step‐termination fractures on the
ventral surface. Fragments of flake scars with weak generic polish are truncated by this impact
fracture. Flake scar ridges are worn and smoothed on both faces. At high magnification, this generic

Appendix D, Cont’d
high-point polish lacks patterned linear features. The point has been used and likely resharpened,
but no impact striations or polish survive from the last use.

Gary point var. Hobson 74-16 is a dart point made on a cortical flake from a coarse-grained chert
cobble (see Figure D-42). Remnants of cobble cortex remain on the proximal end. The artifact has
one shoulder and a twisted form. It is not bifacially symmetrical, retaining a flat ventral face from
the parent flake. Weak generic polish is on ridges; however, at high magnification, there is no
evidence of having been used as a hafted projectile point or that the lateral edges were used. This is
an unfinished projectile point and was not used.

Gary point 78-55 is a small dart point made of brown chert (see Figure D-42). A large flake scar on
one lateral edge may be excavation damage or may predate recovery. Metallic residue from the
motorized screening device is on many ridges on both faces of the artifact. General abrasive polish
is on the central axis and the thick point where the midline and transverse axis cross at the level of
the shoulders. At high magnification, there is no wear on the tip or lateral edges. No linear features
reflect the last use event. The presence of high-point abrasive polish indicates considerable
handling, the tip of one shoulder projection is missing, and the small size of the point suggests that
the point was used and resharpened.

Gary point var. Kaufman 80-27 (1) is a well-made almost complete dart point of brown chert,
missing the distal tip and one shoulder (see Figure D-42). The missing distal tip is likely from an
impact fracture. Metal residue is on the midline ridge on side 1. At high magnification, weak generic
polish from general handling is on all surfaces. There are no specific areas of polish development on
ridges, edges, or the tip remnant. The lateral edges appear to have been resharpened.

Gary point var. Colfax 80-27 (2) is a complete point of dark red and black chert (see Figure D-42).
Cobble cortex remains on the base of the stem. There is no haft abrasion and no evidence of use of
the tip or lateral edges. The artifact was not used and, considering the irregular form, may be an
unfinished point.
Gary point var. Colfax 82-41 (1) is a well-made dart point of good-quality red and tan chert (see
Figure D-42). The concave lateral edge and tip were likely damaged in use, and the point was
reshaped and resharpened, ready to be used. There is no microscopic evidence in the form of polish
or striations on ridges or edges to indicate the last use event. Metal residue is on ridges.

Gary point var. Kemp 82-41 (2) is a dart point of red chert (see Figure D-42). The tip and part of
the stem are missing. There are thermal fractures all over the surface, and the break across the tip
has the irregular bubbly surface associated with heat damage. It is not clear whether the point was
heat treated before manufacture or heat damaged after discard. The point was well made,
symmetrically thinned, and the remaining lateral edges are sharp. At high magnification, there is
evidence of light use cutting soft tissue on the point at the convergence of the distal fracture and
one lateral edge. This use event was after the fracture.

D-36

Appendix D, Cont’d
Gary point var. Hobson 82-41 (3) is a “complete” point of metaquartzite (see Figure D-42). The
point has an irregular outline, is missing one shoulder, and is bilaterally asymmetrical. It appears to
be an unfinished point. There is no evidence at high magnification that the tip was used as a graving
or piercing tool, and the lateral edges were not used.
Gary point var. Kemp 82-41 (4) is a very small point made of tan chert (see Figure D-42). The
length of the body from tip to shoulders is less than the length of the stem, suggesting that the point
has been extensively resharpened during its use-life. The shoulders are almost gone, but the point
has retained good bilateral symmetry. There is generic diffuse high-point polish over all surfaces.
This polish is not well developed at the edges and is interpreted as general abrasion from handling.
There are no patterns in linear features observed at high magnification to indicate specific use.

Gary point var. Alsa 82-43 is a fragmentary artifact of red chert. Cobble cortex is present on both
faces (see Figure D-42). This looks like a “learning” piece. It is made on a thin cobble of heat-treated
chert. No successful bifacially thinned edges are present, so the theoretical template for a finished
point is unknown. There is no evidence that any of the projections were used.

Gary point 87-48 is the proximal fragment of a large dart point made of relatively fine-grained
brown chert (see Figure D-42). A transverse fracture extends at an oblique angle across the point
just above the level of the shoulders and could be an impact fracture. High-point and ridge abrasion
are present; however, at high magnification, there is no evidence of use of the fractured edge. If the
fracture across the body is from impact, then the point was used. The fragment was not used postfracture.
Gary point var. Kaufman 88-53 is a dart point made from a very small, thin cobble of heat-treated
chert (see Figure D-42). Exterior surfaces of the original cobble are present on both faces and the
stem base and distal tip of the point. The “interior” of the cobble has a chalky, degraded texture
with poor flaking qualities, resulting in step termination flake scars. The point appears unfinished,
and there is no evidence that is was used.

Gary point var. Emory 90-74 is a very small dart point made of brown chert (see Figure D-42).
Cobble cortex is on the stem basal surface. Diffuse abrasive high-point polish is present on all ridges
and surfaces. At high magnification, smooth sleeks parallel to the long axis are on the midline ridge
(Figure D-44) and are typical of contact with hard tissue during impact. Multidirectional striations
are in invasive polish along the left edge, side 2, just distal to the shoulder. This is wear from cutting
soft tissue.
This tiny point was resharpened, probably more than once, and a symmetrical form was
maintained. Impact striations from last use as a projectile point are on the midline, and use as a
cutting tool is on one lateral edge.

Figure D‐44: Microwear Analysis: Gary point var. Emory 90‐74.
Long smooth impact sleeks are on the midline ridge
(Image 90‐74 side 2a @ 500X).
Gary point var. Kemp 93‐84 is a complete dart point made of red and tan chert with an abundance
of crystal inclusions (see Figure D‐42). The point is bilaterally symmetrical but not bifacially
symmetrical. There is a prominent midline ridge on side 1, which is much thicker than relatively flat
side 2. This kind of bifacial asymmetry is found on points made on thin flakes. Oblique thinning
flakes originating just lateral to the tip on side 1 end in abrupt hinge terminations at the thick
central axis. Lateral edges and the tip are sharp. There is abrasive polish on the midline ridge. The
variability in diffuse polish development on “older” and “newer” flake scars along the edges is
evidence of resharpening. There is no specific evidence at high magnification of use as a projectile
point or cutting tool.
Gary point 93‐86 is a crude biface of coarse‐grained tan chert (see Figure D‐42). Edges and ridges
are rounded and abraded. Some generic ridge polish from handling is present, but there is no well‐
developed polish on any edges to indicate use. This may be a point preform, but it has no stem or
shoulders and does not appear to be a finished point.

Atkins 100018032/120087

D‐38

Appendix D, Cont’d
Gary point var. Kaufman 94-64 is a well-made complete dart point of medium-grained gray chert
(see Figure D-42). Bilateral asymmetry and convex lateral edges indicate the point has been
resharpened. Also, lateral edge surfaces have variable amounts of generic polish from handling, so
that newer flake scars from resharpening have less polish than older flake scars. Surfaces with
generic polish lack patterned striations that would indicate specific uses such as cutting or impact.
The tip and edges are sharp. Metallic residue is on both faces. The point has had considerable
handling during manufacture, curation, hafting, and resharpening.

Gary point var. Kaufman 95-70 is a complete dart point of tan chert (see Figure D-42). Cobble
cortex is on the stem base. Metal residue is on one face. There is weak generic polish from handling
on high points and ridges. At high magnification, there is no well-developed polish or striations on
midline or edges to indicate specific use. There is no clear evidence of resharpening. The point was
not used.

Gary point var. Colfax 104-97 is a dart point made of black chert (see Figure D-43). The distal tip
is missing, a probable impact fracture. The lateral edges are convex, evidence of considerable
resharpening. At high magnification, there is no haft polish, no use of the tip after the break, no use
of lateral edges, and no impact striations. Weak generic polish from handling is present on high
points and ridges.

Gary point var. Runge 105-108 is a well-made dart point of fine-grained light gray chert (see
Figure D-43). The tip is missing from a probable impact fracture. There is weak generic polish from
handling on all surfaces and ridges, but no evidence that the edges or tip were used and no impact
striations. The point was used and resharpened.

Gary point var. Alsa 125-156 is a thick triangular biface with a rounded base and pointed tip
made of medium-grained red chert (see Figure D-43). Ridges and high points are smoothed and
polished (Figure D-45). At high magnification at the pointed tip, multidirectional striations are in
invasive polish along the edge, indicating cutting of soft tissue (Figure D-46). There is evidence of
multidirectional cutting motions and contact with hard tissue on a lateral edge near the pointed tip
of the biface (Figure D-47). This combination of cutting motions on both soft and hard tissue is
characteristic wear from animal butchering. The biface was hand held and used as a butchering
tool.

Gary point var. Emory 126-175 is a complete dart point made of red and tan chert (see Figure
D-43). The point lacks bilateral symmetry in that one lateral edge has an exaggerated convex curve,
while the other is almost straight. The tip is not aligned with the central axial ridge. This suggests
that the point was reshaped and resharpened after losing its original tip and one shoulder
projection. There is weak generic polish on the midline at the shoulder ridge. At high magnification,
there are no wear attributes to indicate last use as a projectile point or use of the lateral edges.

(Image 125-156 side 2c @ 200X).
Gary point var. Kaufman 127-202 is a dart point made of red and black chert (see Figure D-43).
The distal tip is missing, likely an impact fracture. At high magnification, there are no impact
striations on the midline, no evidence of edge use, no use of the fracture edge, and no haft abrasion.

Gary point 127-203 (1) is a stem fragment of a dart point made of brown chert (see Figure D-43).
The extreme proximal tip is missing, likely an impact fracture. A potlid near the tip looks like
thermal damage. One edge appears to have been resharpened. There is no microwear evidence at
high magnification to reflect use of the edges.

Gary point var. Kemp 127-203 (2) is the proximal end of a dart point made of chert (see Figure
D-43). A transverse fracture extends across the body of the point distal to the shoulder axis. Overall
generic high-point and surface abrasion is from handling during manufacture and use of the point.
No patterned wear attributes were found. A small area of autoretouch flaking is along the fracture
edge. No specific polish or linear features are associated with this flaking. Use was minimal, or the
edge flaking is the result of the fracture event. The point was used, fractured, and the stem fragment
was discarded.

Gary point 128-207 is the proximal fragment of a dart point made of fine-grained red and tan
chert (see Figure D-43). Cobble cortex is on the stem base. One distal lateral edge is an oblique
fracture, and the other has a lot of step fracture damage from heavy bashing. The fracture surface
has a bubbly surface like thermal damage. At high magnification, there is no polish on the stepfractured surfaces to indicate if this damage is from postfracture use or what the contact material
was that caused this damage. There is weak abrasive polish on ridges and high points. The point
was used and discarded, but the cause of the heavy pounding damage to the distal tip is unknown.

Appendix D, Cont’d
Gary point 128‐208 is the proximal fragment of a dart point made of tan chert (see Figure D‐43). A
transverse fracture is across the body of the point, approximately midway between the shoulders
and the missing distal tip, and ended the use‐life of this point. A considerable amount of shiny black
residue is on the stem of the point (Figure D‐48). This may be a mastic material like pitch for
securing the point in the haft (see Appendix F to this report). At high magnification, there is generic
abrasive polish over the surface and ridges from handling during manufacture, hafting,
resharpening, and general use. No specific impact striations or use of edges was found. The point
was used, broken, and discarded.

Figure D‐48: Microwear Analysis: Gary point 128‐208. The arrow indicates the limit of the
black residue just below the shoulders of the point (Image 128‐208 side 2 stem @ 10X).
Gary point 130‐197 is a biface of tan chert (see Figure D‐43). This biface may be an unfinished
Gary point. A thick central “stack” has not been removed from side 1, and no stem or shoulders have
been shaped. Cobble cortex remains on side 2. An irregular surface lateral to the tip on side 2 is
problematic to the creation of a bifacial edge here. There is no evidence at high magnification that
the biface has been used in this form. The biface was not used and is not a finished dart point.
Gary point var. Colfax 132‐182 is a tiny well‐made dart point of translucent white novaculite (see
Figure D‐43). The point has been resharpened, probably many times, and good bilateral and bifacial
symmetry has been maintained. The length to thickness ratio is approximately 3 to 1. The raw
material has numerous surface crystals. At high magnification, there are no wear traces in the form
Atkins 100018032/120087

Appendix D, Cont’d
of polish or linear features on the tip, ridges, or edges. There is some metallic residue from
screening on ridges.

Gary point var. Panna Maria 132-183 (1) is a biface of brown chert with cobble cortex on the
basal surface (see Figure D-43). This diamond-shaped biface may be a preform for a Gary dart
point. It does not appear to have ever had a sharp distal point or the typical parallel oblique shallow
edge flaking. The body is thick, domed at the midsection. Veins of crystals run through the chert. At
high magnification, there is weak generic polish on ridges and high spots from handling, but no
evidence of the edges or tip having been used. There is metal on one edge at the tip. The biface was
not used and may be a preform discarded in manufacture.

Gary point var. Panna Maria 132-183 (2) is a dart point of fine-grained brown chert (see Figure
D-43). The overall form is crude with irregular surfaces, the body lacks bilateral symmetry, and
cobble cortex remains on the dorsal surface. At high magnification, there is microflaking around the
irregularly shaped tip on the ventral surface with well-developed invasive polish on all surfaces and
in flake scars (Figure D-49), and multidirectional single striations in the polish. This wear is typical
of cutting soft tissue.

Figure D-49: Microwear Analysis: Gary point var. Panna Maria 132-183 (2).
Microflaking is around the ventral surface of the tip with well-developed invasive
polish on all surfaces and in flake scars. Multidirectional single striations
(not visible at this magnification) are all over the tip (Image 132-183(2) vb @ 50X).
On the dorsal side, well-developed invasive polish covers the tip and extends from the edge to the
midline ridge. Striations both oblique and parallel to the ridge are visible (Figure D-50).
Atkins 100018032/120087

D-43

Appendix D, Cont’d
Multidirectional striations were observed all around the tip. This is all wear consistent with cutting
soft tissue. This is a well-used cutting tool. It is not clear if it was a finished projectile point, and
there is no direct evidence of use as a projectile point.

Figure D-50: Microwear Analysis: Gary point var. Panna Maria 132-183 (2).
Invasive polish on the midline ridge (at left) has visible striations both oblique
and parallel to the ridge, marked by arrows (Image 132-183(2) da @ 500X).
Gary Point var. Kenedy 132-183 (3) is a very small dart point of dark red fine-grained chert (see
Figure D-43). The blade has been resharpened so that it is approximately half as long as the stem.
The entire distal end of the point, tip, edges, and shoulders are severely rounded (Figure D-51). The
rounded edges of the blade are in sharp contrast to the stem, which has retained the original sharp
edges (Figure D-52).
The contrast between the severely rounded edges of the blade and the sharp edges of the stem
indicate that the point was hafted during use. Both faces of the point are abraded and polished
(Figure D-53).

At magnifications of 100X and 200X, the severely rounded edges of the tip, edges, and shoulders are
uniformly polished with invasive soft tissue polish and crosshatched with fine and coarse single
striations from grit particles (Figures D-54 and D-55).

The severely worn surfaces of this point are from working soft animal tissue in the presence of grit,
exactly like the wear found on hide- or animal skin-working tools. The point was probably once
much larger and may have been used as a projectile point; however, all evidence of any previous
use has been obliterated from edges and surfaces. This small point was hafted during use as a skinworking tool.
Gary point var. Kemp 133-193 is a very small complete dart point of coarse-grained tan chert (see
Figure D-43). Cobble cortex is on the base of the stem. The point has been resharpened and is no
longer bilaterally symmetrical. The midline ridge is off-center, one lateral edge is slightly concave,
and the other is straight or slightly convex. At high magnification, there is no polish or wear on
ridges, tip, or lateral edges.

Gary point var. Kaufman 136 is a well-made complete dart point of pink novaculite (see Figure
D-43). The relatively fine-grained material has abundant surface crystals. There is metallic residue
on ridges. The point lacks bilateral symmetry. The midline longitudinal ridge is off-center, the
lateral blade edges are convex, and the tip has been reshaped. At high magnification, there are no
wear attributes in the form of polish or linear features on the tip, midline ridge, transverse ridge, or
edges. The point was used and resharpened.

Gary point var. Kaufman 136-229 (1) is the proximal fragment of a large dart point made of tan
chert (see Figure D-43). Microscopically, high-point abrasive polish over all surfaces suggests
significant handling during the use-life of the point. There is no specific polish and no linear
features on the remaining lateral edge to indicate use of the edge. The fracture edge was not used.
Atkins 100018032/120087

Appendix D, Cont’d
This stem and shoulder fragment was not used after the fracture event. Any use before fracture is
unknown.

Gary point var. Hobson 136-229 (2) is a complete dart point of tan chert (see Figure D-43). One
face of the point is flat, and cobble cortex remains on this surface. The extreme distal tip is missing,
likely an impact fracture. One lateral edge and shoulder are missing. The remaining convex lateral
edge is sharp. The tip may have been reshaped at least once, since the convex edge has an irregular
concavity before straightening out to the existing tip. Microscopically, there is weak generic highpoint polish on ridges. There is no polish or wear on the tip or lateral edges to indicate use. The
point was used, reshaped, and discarded.

Gary point var. Colfax 137-231 is the proximal fragment of a dart point made of tan chert (see
Figure D-43). A long bending fracture extends across the point from one lateral edge to the
shoulder of the opposite edge. At high magnification, there is no evidence of use as a projectile point
and no evidence of edge flaking or polish on the fracture edge. This proximal fragment was not used
after the fracture event. The bending fracture across the body is very likely an impact fracture,
meaning the point was used before discard.

Gary point var. Emory 144-245 is a complete dart point made of medium-grained brown chert
with cobble cortex at the base of the stem (see Figure D-43). The point is well made, with bifacial
and bilateral symmetry. There is considerable metallic residue on ridges and high points on both
faces. At high magnification, the midline ridge on side 1 has continuous invasive polish from tip to
transverse ridge and has multiple smooth “impact” striations parallel to the long axis (Figure D-56).
Well-developed invasive polish is on projections along the straighter lateral edge on side 2, and
multidirectional single striations in this polish reflect cutting actions with this edge (Figure D-57).

This dart point has clear microwear evidence for use as a projectile point and as a cutting tool on
soft animal tissue. In contrast to the majority of Gary points examined in this assemblage, this point
was not resharpened after its last use, so that wear traces of impact and edge use were retained.
Because of the shape of the point, it was not possible to capture images of the edge polish at 500X,
so that the observation of multidirectional striations was made from multiple focal points during
microscopic analysis.

Gary point var. Panna Maria 145-252 is a biface of coarse-grained light tan chert (see Figure D43). The biface has a long, ovoid shape, is relatively flat on side 2, with a domed thick central axis
ridge on side 1. Cobble cortex is retained on the proximal end. There is a possible fracture on one
lateral edge, and the biface does not have shoulders or a transverse ridge. It is an unusual form for a
Gary point. At high magnification, there is some high-point polish on the central ridge, but no wear
traces on other ridges, the tip, or edges. This may be a preform or unfinished dart point. The biface
was not used.

Summary
Of the 39 Gary dart points analyzed, 1 specimen (125‐156) was used exclusively as a butchering
tool. Nine are judged to be probable preforms and were not used. Of the remaining 29 dart points,
26 were used as projectile points. This determination was made primarily on the presence of
impact fractures, evidence of reshaping or resharpening, and size, particularly the ratio of body
length to stem length. Only 2 of the 26 points have clear microscopic evidence of impact striations
in polish on the axial ridge. One of the remaining 3 dart points is a complete point, apparently
unused. One dart point is the proximal fragment of a large point, and the cause of the fracture is
unclear. Four of the dart points were also used as cutting tools on soft animal tissue. A summary of
the analyses results is presented in Table D‐1.
The most unusual microwear is found on Gary point var. Kenedy 132‐183 (3). The complete distal
portion of the point is severely worn, rounded, polished, and striated in contrast to the sharp edges
of the stem. The wear on the body is very much like the wear on hide‐scraping tools. This point was
used hafted performing a skin‐working task, and any previous use as a projectile point has been
obliterated. The kind of skin‐working task is unknown.
One of the points (128‐208) has a black residue on the stem that may be pitch or mastic (see
Appendix F to this report).

INTRODUCTION
One biface and a reference sample of asphaltum were submitted for analysis. Absorbed lipid
residues were extracted from the biface with organic solvents; the asphaltum was dissolved in the
same solvents. The lipid extract was analyzed using gas chromatography (GC), high temperature GC
(HT-GC), and high temperature gas chromatography with mass spectrometry (HT-GC/MS). Residue
identifications were based on fatty acid decomposition patterns of experimental residues, lipid
distribution patterns, and the presence of biomarkers. Procedures for the identification of
archeological residues are outlined below; following this, analytical procedures and results are
presented.

THE IDENTIFICATION OF ARCHEOLOGICAL RESIDUES
Identification of Fatty Acids

Fatty acids are the major constituents of fats and oils (lipids) and occur in nature as triglycerides,
consisting of three fatty acids attached to a glycerol molecule by ester-linkages. The shorthand
convention for designating fatty acids, Cx:yωz, contains three components. The “Cx” refers to a fatty
acid with a carbon chain length of x number of atoms. The “y” represents the number of double
bonds or points of unsaturation, and the “ωz” indicates the location of the most distal double bond
on the carbon chain, i.e., closest to the methyl end. Thus, the fatty acid expressed as C18:1ω9, refers
to a monounsaturated isomer with a chain length of 18 carbon atoms with a single double bond
located nine carbons from the methyl end of the chain. Similarly, the shorthand designation, C16:0,
refers to a saturated fatty acid with a chain length of 16 carbons.

Their insolubility in water and relative abundance compared to other classes of lipids, such as
sterols and waxes, make fatty acids suitable for residue analysis. Since employed by Condamin et al.
(1976), gas chromatography has been used extensively to analyze the fatty acid component of
absorbed archeological residues. The composition of uncooked plants and animals provides
important baseline information, but it is not possible to directly compare modern uncooked plants
and animals with highly degraded archeological residues. Unsaturated fatty acids, which are found
widely in fish and plants, decompose more readily than saturated fatty acids, sterols, or waxes. In
the course of decomposition, simple addition reactions might occur at points of unsaturation
(Solomons 1980), or peroxidation might lead to the formation of a variety of volatile and
nonvolatile products that continue to degrade (Frankel 1991). Peroxidation occurs most readily in
fatty acids with more than one point of unsaturation.

Attempts have been made to identify archeological residues using criteria that discriminate
uncooked foods (Marchbanks 1989; Skibo 1992; Loy 1994). The major drawback of the

distinguishing ratios proposed by Marchbanks (1989), Skibo (1992) and Loy (1994) is they have
never been empirically tested. The proposed ratios are based on criteria that discriminate food
classes on the basis of their original fatty acid composition. The resistance of these criteria to the
effects of decompositional changes has not been demonstrated. Rather, Skibo (1992) found his fatty
acid ratio criteria could not be used to identify highly decomposed archeological samples.

In order to identify a fatty acid ratio unaffected by degradation processes, Patrick et al. (1985)
simulated the long-term decomposition of one sample and monitored the resulting changes. An
experimental cooking residue of seal was prepared and degraded in order to identify a stable fatty
acid ratio. Patrick et al. (1985) found that the ratio of two C18:1 isomers, oleic and vaccenic, did not
change with decomposition; this fatty acid ratio was then used to identify an archeological vessel
residue as seal. While the fatty acid composition of uncooked foods must be known, Patrick et al.
(1985) showed that the effects of cooking and decomposition over long periods of time on the fatty
acids must also be understood.

Development of the Identification Criteria

As the first stage in developing the identification criteria used herein, the fatty acid compositions of
more than 130 uncooked Native food plants and animals from Western Canada were determined
using gas chromatography (Malainey 1997; Malainey et al. 1999a). When the fatty acid
compositions of modern food plants and animals were subject to cluster and principal-component
analyses, the resultant groupings generally corresponded to divisions that exist in nature (Table
F-1). Clear differences in the fatty acid composition of large mammal fat, large herbivore meat, fish,
plant roots, greens, and berries/seeds/nuts were detected, but the fatty acid composition of meat
from medium-sized mammals resembles berries/seeds/nuts.

Samples in cluster A, the large mammal and fish cluster, had elevated levels of C16:0 and C18:1 (see
Table F-1). Divisions within this cluster stemmed from the very high level of C18:1 isomers in fat,
high levels of C18:0 in bison and deer meat, and high levels of very long chain unsaturated fatty
acids (VLCU) in fish. Differences in the fatty acid composition of plant roots, greens, and
berries/seeds/nuts reflect the amounts of C18:2 and C18:3ω3 present. The berry, seed, nut, and
small mammal meat samples appearing in cluster B have very high levels of C18:2, ranging from 35
to 64 percent (see Table F-1). Samples in subclusters V, VI, and VII have levels of C18:1 isomers
from 29 to 51 percent as well. Plant roots, plant greens, and some berries appear in cluster C. All
cluster C samples have moderately high levels of C18:2; except for the berries in subcluster XII,
levels of C16:0 are also elevated. Higher levels of C18:3ω3 and/or very long chain saturated fatty
acids (VLCS) are also common except in the roots that form subcluster XV.

Secondly, the effects of cooking and degradation over time on fatty acid compositions were
examined. Originally, 19 modern residues of plants and animals from the plains, parkland, and
forests of Western Canada were prepared by cooking samples of meats, fish, and plants, alone or
combined, in replica vessels over an open fire (Malainey 1997; Malainey et al. 1999b). After 4 days
at room temperature, the vessels were broken and a set of sherds analyzed to determine changes
after a short term of decomposition. A second set of sherds remained at room temperature for
80 days, then were placed in an oven at 75 degrees Celsius (°C) for a period of 30 days in order to
simulate the processes of long-term decomposition. The relative percentages were calculated on
the basis of the 10 fatty acids (C12:0, C14:0, C15:0, C16:0, C16:1, C17:0, C18:0, C18:1w9, C18:1w11,
and C18:2) that regularly appeared in Precontact Period vessel residues from Western Canada.
Observed changes in fatty acid composition of the experimental cooking residues enabled the
development of a method for identifying the archeological residues (Table F-2).

It was determined that levels of medium chain fatty acids (C12:0, C14:0, and C15:0), C18:0, and
C18:1 isomers in the sample could be used to distinguish degraded experimental cooking residues
(Malainey 1997; Malainey et al. 1999b). Higher levels of medium chain fatty acids, combined with
low levels of C18:0 and C18:1 isomers, were detected in the decomposed experimental residues of
plants, such as roots, greens, and most berries. High levels of C18:0 indicated the presence of large
herbivores. Moderate levels of C18:1 isomers, with low levels of C18:0, indicated the presence of
either fish or foods similar in composition to corn. High levels of C18:1 isomers with low levels of
C18:0 were found in residues of beaver or foods of similar fatty acid composition. The criteria for
identifying six types of residues were established experimentally; the seventh type, plant with large
herbivore, was inferred (see Table F-2). These criteria were applied to residues extracted from
more than 200 pottery cooking vessels from 18 Western Canadian sites (Malainey 1997; Malainey
et al. 1999c; 2001b). The identifications were found to be consistent with the evidence from faunal
and tool assemblages for each site.

Work has continued to understand the decomposition patterns of various foods and food
combinations (Malainey et al. 2000a, 2000b, 2000c; Malainey, Malisza et al. 2001; Quigg et al.
2001). The collection of modern foods has expanded to include plants from the Southern Plains.
The fatty acid compositions of mesquite beans (Prosopis glandulosa), Texas ebony seeds
(Pithecellobium ebano Berlandier), tasajillo berry (Opuntia leptocaulis), prickly pear fruit and pads
(Opuntia engelmannii), Spanish dagger pods (Yucca treculeana), cooked sotol (Dasylirion wheeler),
agave (Agave lechuguilla), cholla (Opuntia imbricata), piñon (Pinus edulis) and Texas mountain
laurel (or mescal) seed (Sophora secundiflora) have been determined. Experimental residues of
many of these plants, alone or in combination with deer meat, have been prepared by boiling foods
in clay cylinders or using sandstone for either stone boiling (Quigg et al. 2000) or as a griddle. In
order to accelerate the processes of oxidative degradation that naturally occur at a slow rate with
the passage of time, the rock or clay tile containing the experimental residue was placed in an oven
at 75 °C. After either 30 or 68 days, residues were extracted and analyzed using gas
chromatography. The results of these decomposition studies enabled refinement of the
identification criteria (Malainey 2007).

Using Lipid Distribution and Biomarkers to Identify Archeological Residues

Archeological scientists working in the United Kingdom have had tremendous success using high
temperature-gas chromatography (HT-GC) and gas chromatography with mass spectrometry (HTGC/MS) to identify biomarkers. High temperature gas chromatography is used to separate and
assess a wide range of lipid components, including fatty acids, long chain alcohols and
hydrocarbons, sterols, waxes, terpenoids, and triacylglycerols (Evershed et al. 2001). The molecular
structure of separated components is elucidated by mass spectrometry (Evershed 2000).

Triacylglycerols, diacylglycerols, and sterols can be used to distinguish animal-derived residues,
which contain cholesterol and significant levels of both triacylglycerols, from plant-derived
residues, indicated by plant sterols, such as β-sitosterol, stigmasterol, and campesterol, and only
traces of triacylglycerols (Dudd and Evershed 1998; Evershed 1993; Evershed, Mottram et al.
1997;). Barnard et al. (2007), however, have recently suggested that microorganisms living off
residues can introduce β-sitosterol into residues resulting from the preparation of animal products.
Waxes, which are long-chain fatty acids and long-chain alcohols that form protective coatings on
skin, fur, feathers, leaves, and fruit, also resist decay. Evershed et al. (1991) found epicuticular leaf
waxes from plants of the genus Brassica in vessel residues from a Late Saxon/Medieval settlement.
Cooking experiments later confirmed the utility of nonacosane, nonacosan-15-one, and nonacosan15-ol to indicate the preparation of leafy vegetables, such as turnip or cabbage (Charters et al.
1997). Reber et al. (2004) recently suggested n-dotriacontanol could serve as an effective
biomarker for maize in vessel residues from sites located in Midwestern and Eastern North
America. Beeswax can be identified by the presence and distribution of n-alkanes with carbon
chains 23 to 33 atoms in length and palmitic acid wax esters with chains between 40 and 52
carbons in length (Evershed, Vaugh et al. 1997; Heron et al. 1994;).

Appendix F, Cont’d
Terpenoid compounds, or terpenes, are long chain alkenes that occur in the tars and pitches of
higher plants. The use of GC and GC/MS to detect the diterpenoid, dehydroabietic acid, from conifer
products in archeological residues extends over a span of 25 years (Heron and Pollard 1988;
Shackley 1982;). Lupeol, α- and β-amyrin and their derivatives indicate the presence of plant
materials (Regert 2007). Eerkens (2002) used the predominance of the diterpenoid, Δ–8(9)isopimaric acid, in vessel residue from the western Great Basin to argue it contained piñyon resins.
Other analytical techniques have also been used to identify terpenoid compounds. Sauter et al.
(1987) detected the triterpenoid, betulin, in Iron Age tar using both 1H and 13C nuclear magnetic
resonance spectroscopy (NMR), confirming the tar was produced from birch.

METHODS

Lipids were extracted from the intact biface using a variation of the method developed by Folch et
al. (1957) with a 2:1 mixture, by volume, of chloroform and methanol (2 × 25 mL) using
ultrasonication (2 × 10 min). A small portion of the asphaltum reference sample (0.106 g) was
dissolved in an equal amount of the extraction solvents. Solids were removed by filtering the
solvent mixture into a separatory funnel. The lipid/solvent filtrate was washed with 13.3 mL of
ultrapure water. Once separation into two phases was complete, the lower chloroform-lipid phase
was transferred to a round-bottomed flask and the chloroform removed by rotary evaporation. Any
remaining water was removed by evaporation with 2-propanol (1.5 mL); 1.5 mL of chloroformmethanol (2:1, v/v) was used to transfer the dry total lipid extract to a screw-top glass vial with a
Teflon®-lined cap. The resulting total lipid extract was flushed with nitrogen and stored in a –20 °C
freezer.

Preparation of FAMES

A 50 µL aliquot of the asphaltum extract and a 200 µL aliquot of the total lipid extract solution from
the biface were placed in screw-top test tubes and dried in a heating block under nitrogen. Fatty
acid methyl esters (FAMES) were prepared by treating the dry lipid with 3 mL of 0.5 N anhydrous
hydrochloric acid in methanol (68 °C; 60 min). Fatty acids that occur in the sample as di- or
triglycerides are detached from the glycerol molecule and converted to methyl esters. After cooling
to room temperature, 2.0 mL of ultrapure water was added. FAMES were recovered with petroleum
ether (2 × 1.5 mL) and transferred to a vial. The solvent was removed by heat under a gentle stream
of nitrogen; the FAMES were dissolved in 75 µL of iso-octane then transferred to a GC vial with a
conical glass insert.

Preparation of TMS Derivatives

A 50 µL aliquot of the asphaltum extract and a 100 µL aliquot of the total lipid extract solution from
the biface were placed in screw-top vials and dried under nitrogen. Trimethylsilyl (TMS)
derivatives were prepared by treating the lipid with 70 µL of N,O-bis(trimethylsilyl)
trifluoroacetamide (BSTFA) containing 1% trimethylchlorosilane, by volume (70 ºC; 30 min). The

sample was then dried under nitrogen and the TMS derivatives were redissolved in 100 µL of
hexane.
Solvents and chemicals were checked for purity by running a sample blank. Traces of fatty acid
contamination were subtracted from sample chromatograms. The relative percentage composition
was calculated by dividing the integrated peak area of each fatty acid by the total area of fatty acids
present in the sample.

In order to identify the residue on the basis of fatty acid composition, the relative percentage
composition was determined first with respect to all fatty acids present in the sample (including
very long chain fatty acids) and second with respect to the 10 fatty acids utilized in the
development of the identification criteria (C12:0, C14:0, C15:0, C16:0, C16:1, C17:0, C18:0,
C18:1w9, C18:1w11, and C18:2) (not shown). The second step is necessary for the application of
the identification criteria presented in Table F-2. It must be understood that the identifications
given do not necessarily mean that those particular foods were actually prepared because different
foods of similar fatty acid composition and lipid content would produce similar residues (Table
F-3). It is possible only to say that the material of origin for the residue was similar in composition
to the food(s) indicated. High temperature gas chromatography and high temperature gas
chromatography with mass spectrometry is used to further clarify the identifications.

Gas Chromatography Analysis Parameters
The GC analysis was performed on a Varian 3800 gas chromatograph fitted with a flame ionization
detector connected to a personal computer. Samples were separated using a VF-23 fused silica
capillary column (30 m × 0.25 mm I.D.; Varian; Palo Alto, CA). An autosampler injected a 3 µL
sample using a split/splitless injection system. Hydrogen was used as the carrier gas with a column
flow of 1.0 mL/min. Column temperature was increased from 80oC to 140oC at a rate of 20oC per
minute then increased to 185oC at a rate of 4oC per minute. After a 4.0-minute hold, the
temperature was further increased to 250oC at 10oC per minute and held for 2 minutes.
Chromatogram peaks were integrated using Varian MS Workstation® software and identified
through comparisons with external qualitative standards (NuCheck Prep; Elysian, MN).

High Temperature Gas Chromatography and Gas Chromatography with Mass
Spectrometry

Both HT-GC and HT-GC-MS analyses were performed on a Varian 3800 gas chromatograph fitted
with a flame ionization detector and a Varian 4000 mass spectrometer connected to a personal
computer. For HT-GC analysis, the sample was injected onto a DB-1HT fused silica capillary column
(15 m × 0.32 mm I.D.; Agilent J&W; Santa Clara, CA) connected to the flame ionization detector,
using hydrogen as the carrier gas. The column temperature was held at 50oC for 1 minute then
increased to 350oC at a rate of 15oC per minute and held for 26 minutes. For HT-GC-MS analysis,
samples were injected onto a DB-5HT fused silica capillary column (30 m × 0.25 mm I.D.; Agilent
J&W; Santa Clara, CA) connected to the ion trap mass spectrometer in an external ionization
configuration using helium as the carrier gas. After a 1-minute hold at 50oC, the column
temperature was increased to 180oC at a rate of 40oC per minute then ramped up to 230oC at a rate
of 5oC per minute and finally increased to 350oC at a rate of 15oC per minute and held for 27.75
minutes. The Varian 4000 mass spectrometer was operated in electron-impact ionization mode
scanning from m/z 50–700. Chromatogram peaks and MS spectra were processed using Varian MS
Workstation® software and identified through comparisons with external qualitative standards
(Sigma Aldrich; St. Louis, MO and NuCheck Prep; Elysian, MN), reference samples, and the National
Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) database.

RESULTS OF ARCHEOLOGICAL DATA ANALYSIS

Description of the biface and the composition of the residue extracted from it, 12ATK 2, are
presented in Table F-4. The term, Area, represents the area under the chromatographic peak of a
given fatty acid, as calculated by the Varian MS Workstation ® software minus the solvent blank.
The term, Rel%, represents the relative percentage of the fatty acid with respect to the total fatty
acids in the sample. Hydroxide or peroxide degradation products can interfere with the integration
of the C22:0 and C22:1 peaks; these fatty acids were excluded from the analysis. The asphaltum

The presence of lipid biomarkers and identification of other components in both residues were
determined using HT-GC and HT-GC-MS. The data obtained are useful for distinguishing plant
residues, animal residues, and plant/animal combinations in archeological food residues. The sterol
cholesterol is associated with animal products; β-sitosterol and stigmasterol are associated with
Atkins 100018032/120087

plant products. No TAGs were detected in either residue. If present, amounts of TAGs in plant
residues tend to decrease with increasing numbers of carbon atoms (Malainey et al. 2010). The
peak arising from the C48 TAG is largest, and peak size (and area) progressively decreases with the
C54 TAG being the smallest. A line drawn to connect the tops of the C48, C50, C52, and C54 TAG
peaks slopes down to the right. In animal residues, amounts of TAGs tend to increase with carbon
numbers, with the C52 or C54 TAG being the largest (Malainey et al. 2010). A line drawn to connect
the tops of the C48, C50, C52, and C54 TAG peaks appears as a hill or the line slopes up to the right.
A parabola-like pattern, such as the shape of a “normal distribution,” can also occur in the residues
of oil seeds that contain high levels of C18:1 isomers.

As shown in Table F-4, the level of C18:1 isomers in residue 12ATK 2 is high, 42.00%. Similar levels
are observed in the decomposed residues of animal fat and high fat content seeds or nuts (see Table
F-3). The animal sterol cholesterol occurs in the residue, but because the level of C18:0 is quite low,
it is unlikely that a large herbivore, such as bison or deer, was the source. The level of medium chain
fatty acids (sum of C12:0, C14:0 and C15:0) approaches 10% and the level of the very long chain
saturated fatty acid C20:0 is elevated, which suggests the presence of plant products. The plant
sterol β-sitosterol may occur in the residue, but its presence could not be absolutely confirmed. The
occurrence of anthracene, which is a major component of asphaltum, was confirmed in the biface
residue. Other components of asphaltum were probably masked by food lipids (Table F-5). Other
major asphaltum components occur precisely at the same time as fatty acids and monoacylglycerols
(MAG) that are present in residue 12ATK 2. Since only a trace of the most prominent asphaltum
component was detected when it eluted without interference, it is not surprising that the presence
of lesser components eluting at the same time as food lipids cannot be verified.

Radiocarbon Data Sheets

Appendix G: Radiocarbon Dating
At total of 17 radiocarbon samples were submitted to Beta Analytic for radiocarbon dating.
Samples submitted included a sample of carbonized material found on a thermally altered stone,
ten botanical specimens retrieved during screening at the site and from flotation, five samples of
carbonized residue on pottery, and one date derived from the bulk organics present in one ceramic
sherd. Unfortunately, not enough residue remained on one sherd to obtain a date. Therefore,
radiocarbon dates were obtained on only 16 samples.
The following table summarizes the radiocarbon dating at the Hawkwind site. It is followed by data
provided by Beta Analytic.

Bifacial tools with a unifacial beveled edge, which requires the tool to
be held at a low angle towards the material surface, and involves
multiple, quick strikes against the material

Area of potential effect is the geographic area or areas within which
an undertaking may cause changes in the character or use of historic
properties, if any such properties exist there. This area always
includes the actual site of the undertaking and may also include other
areas where the undertaking will cause changes in land use, traffic
patterns, or other factors that could affect historic properties.
A collection of artifacts from a particular component, site, or group of
sites.
A flake or blade that has undergone intentional modification along
one or more opposing edges, often evidenced by patterned
microchipping

Debitage retaining a discernible interior surface that retains a point of
applied force, but lacks intact margins
A popular method of roughening the surface of a ceramic vessel. It is
considered a decorative treatment as well as a functional one.
Brushing was often done with a stiff bundle of grass or frayed sticks;
brushing may have been used to create a surface bond between the
coils used in pottery manufacture.
Larger cobbles with minimal evidence of reduction along a single bit
edge, with such reduction being unifacial or bifacial and wear
indicative of heavy use
Centimeters below datum

Centimeters below surface

Debitage retaining a discernible single interior surface that retains a
point of applied force and has intact margins

Tools that undergo intense modification, and originate as flakes or
blades that have been detached from a larger core and are categorized
by production stage
A site or portion of a site that is spatially and chronologically discrete

Tools derived from the core itself, often as pebbles or cobbles, and are
categorized by production stage
Debitage lacking a discernible interior surface, point of applied force,
and intact margins

Bifacially worked formal tools exhibiting patterned wear consistent
with use in a full rotary motion, often manufactured from exhausted
dart point bases, therefore maintaining all or most of the original dart
point base

A decorative technique on ceramic vessels executed with a sharp
instrument such as bone, shell, or stone tool when the vessel is wet or
still plastic
Unifacial or bifacial specimens that require the tool to be held with
the working edge parallel to the direction of use for cutting or sawing
either soft or hard tissues
A material made of stone or pertaining to stone

Any relatively large stone or cobble that shows negative flake
scarring, resultant from intentional detachment
All unmodified detached manufacturing debris.

The prepared mass of clay that is transformed into a material used in
the construction of pottery; paste can be described as fine, medium, or
coarse grained, but also in terms of porosity, quality of temper, or
organic material
Unifacial or bifacial tool, generally smaller than a drill, held at an
approximate 90° angle against the working surface, whereby the tool
is utilized for a rotary action such as boring
The technique of observing thin sections of a rock or ceramic sample
under a petrographic microscope to determine the mineral
composition of the sample
Unifacial or bifacial tool that is held with the working edge at an
approximate right angle to the direction of use with the tool edge
being pulled
Bifacially formed tool containing a hafting element, allowing for
attachment to a spear or arrow shaft.

Presumed decorative marks impressed into the clay surface of a
ceramic vessel

1. Right of way is a general term denoting land, property, or interest
therein, usually in a strip, acquired for or devoted to transportation
purposes.

2. Right of way is a general term denoting land, property, or interest
therein, usually in a strip, acquired for or devoted to a highway for
the construction of the roadway. Right of way is the entire width of
land between the public boundaries or property lines of a highway.
This may include purchase for drainage.
Unifacial or bifacial tool that is held with the working edge at an
approximate right angle to the direction of use with the tool edge
being pushed

The coarse components of a paste. Materials deliberately added to the
clay during the formation of a ceramic vessel prior to firing in order to
modify the properties of the basic clay fabric. Temper can include a
variety of materials such as grog (crushed pottery), dried clay lumps,
crushed bone, sand, hematite, or crushed shell.
Stone that exhibits signs of heating including color change, increased
luster, and fracturing
Flakes or blades that have undergone intentional modification along
one or more edges, often evidenced by patterned microchipping

Flakes or blades that exhibit use-wear on one or more edges but lack
intentional modification
