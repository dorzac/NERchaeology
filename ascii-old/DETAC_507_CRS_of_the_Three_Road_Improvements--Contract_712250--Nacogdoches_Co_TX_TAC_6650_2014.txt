ABSTRACT
On the 9th of September 2013 Deep East Texas Archaeological Consultants
(DETAC) conducted a cultural resource management survey of three road improvements
(Red Tip Road, West Loop, and East Loop) for Nacogdoches County (Contract 712250)
southwest of Melrose, Texas. The pedestrian survey was conducted with a combination
of visual examination of the existing unimproved road surfaces and shovel testing near
drainage ditches and culverts for the 2.6 kilometers (1.6 miles) of the road surfaces. A
surface inspection of all three existing unimproved road surfaces found most of the
surfaces eroded with deep ruts well below the natural ground surface everywhere except
along the existing drainages where culverts were in place under the road surface. No
artifacts were recovered in the 12 shovel tests excavated in the near proposed ditch
locations; therefore, no artifacts were curated.
No further investigations are
recommended; however, if any cultural material is recovered during construction, then
excavation should stop and DETAC contacted to evaluate the impact. DETAC is
requesting concurrence with the determination of “no effect” on NRHP eligible
properties for the proposed project area.

INTRODUCTION
In Septembers 2013, Deep East Texas Archaeological Consultants (DETAC)
conducted a cultural resources survey of three road improvements for Nacogdoches
County (Contract 712250) southwest of Melrose, Texas (Figure 1).

Proposed

construction includes clearing and grading existing unimproved dirt roads followed by
adding a gravel surface where needed. Ditches and culverts will be excavated at existing
drainages. The archaeological survey was conducted under Texas Antiquities Permit
#6650.
The purpose of this survey was to locate, describe and record any cultural
resources within the project area boundaries. No cultural resources were found during
the surface inspection or shovel testing of the project area; therefore, no artifacts were
curated. The pedestrian survey did find existing culverts with ditches in some locations.
Most of the road surfaces were heavily rutted. The report was prepared following the
short report format outlined by the Council of Texas Archaeologist (CTA) (2005a) with
modifications requested by the Texas Historical Commission (THC) (Martin 1999).
DETAC requests concurrence with a determination of “no effect” to properties listed or
eligible for the National Register of Historic Places (NRHP).

DEFINITION OF STUDY AREA
The project included clearing and grading three existing unimproved dirt roads
(Red Tip Road, West Loop, and East Loop) followed by adding a gravel surface where
needed. Ditches and culverts were excavated at existing drainages. The total project
length is roughly 2.6 kilometers (km) (1.6 miles (mi)).

Each road right-of-way is

approximately 20 meters (m) (66 feet (ft) wide. Red Tip Road connects CR 411 and John
Hall roads. It crosses an intermittent stream which flows roughly 2 kilometers (km) (1.3
miles (mi)) west to Puento Suelas Creek. West Loop and East Loop (Melrose South
Circle) are on opposite sides of John Hall Road. These roads are on the shoulder of an
upland ridge overlooking two intermittent drainages. All three roads are lined with
buried utilities and homes. Vegetation bordering the roads ranges from kept yards with
grasses, bushes, and shrubs to stands of mixed soft and hard wood trees with a dense
understory of various bushes and shrubs.

PREVIOUS RESEARCH AND CULTURAL HISTORY
Overall, Nacogdoches County has been part of broad studies and investigated in
both larger examinations and numerous small surveys. A majority of these investigations
have focused on property in the City of Nacogdoches, Lake Nacogdoches, Lake
Naconiche, property owned by the U.S. Forest Service, and properties around Sam
Rayburn Reservoir. The surveys that have successfully documented archaeological sites
were conducted along larger streams with well-developed floodplains where the toe
slopes and shoulders of the adjacent ridges were not previously impacted by
development. For example, Corbin (1986) of the Stephen F. Austin State University
Anthropology Department conducted a survey and assessment of archaeological sites in
the city limits. Many of the sites recorded along the La Nanna Creek floodplain during
Corbin’s survey were found along tow slopes and ridges overlooking the creek floodplain
similar to those found in 1972 (Prewitt et al. 1972) along Bayou Loco for the Lake
Nacogdoches survey.

Perttula (2000, 2002, 2008) conducted a survey and testing

investigations for Lake Naconiche. This survey documented 61 archaeological sites in a
508 hectare (ha.) (1,254 acre (ac.)) area along the Naconiche floodplain and adjacent
uplands. The testing excavations focused on 10 of the sites and found an intact Late
Caddoan midden, carbon datable material from other sites and a sample of ceramic
sherds, bone and other artifacts. Closer to the project area, the original survey of Sam
Rayburn Reservoir in 1948 documented a variety of sites from various cultural periods.
More recently, Ecological Communications Corporation (EComm) surveyed 536 ha
(1324 ac) in six parcels around the Sam Rayburn Reservoir for the Corps of Engineers,
Ft. Worth District, timber sales. A total of six previously recorded sites were revisited
and 21 new sites were documented during the EComm survey (Jones 2009).
In addition to the fieldwork referenced above, several documents have added
significantly to available information on the archaeological record in this region. The
documents of primary importance are D.A. Story's (1990) and J.A. Guy's (1990)
discussions of the Gulf Coastal Plain. Additionally, the THC, Department of Antiquities
Protection developed a document for the eastern Texas portion of the Texas State Plan
(Perttula and Kenmotsu 1993). More recently, Perttula (2004:370-407) describes the

3

Caddoan archaeology of northeast Texas which encompasses the area between the Red
River in the north, the Trinity River in the west and the Angelina River in the south.
This overview synthesizes the most recent significant research in the area.
The occupation of the area ranges from the Paleo-Indian (ca. pre-7000 B.C.),
Archaic foraging cultures (ca. 7000-200 B.C.), Early Ceramic Period groups (ca. 200
B.C. - A.D. 800), to the sedentary Caddoan occupation (A.D. 800 - 1680), and ends with
historic Euro American settlement (Perttula and Kenmotsu 44:1993). The Paleo-Indian
period (ca. pre-7000 B.C.) is characterized by small, mobile bands of hunters and
gatherers that consumed a variety of native plants and animals (Story 1990). The Archaic
(7000-200 B.C.) refers to hunter-gatherers who implemented more regionally specialized
approaches toward exploiting their environment (Story 1990). The Early Ceramic (200
B.C.-A.D. 800) stage, also referred to as the Woodland period, represents an increasing
utilization of the environment by local groups to include a greater reliance on cultigens,
prolonged occupations at specific locales (indicating an increasingly sedentary lifestyle)
and the emergence of social and ritual ceremonies (Story 1990). Populations throughout
the region attempted to utilize plant resources along valley margins as sites were located
along increasingly larger landforms and covered larger areas (Corbin 1998:115). In the
Late Prehistoric period (A.D. 800-1680) this portion of east Texas serves as a boundary
between the Caddoan culture to the north and the Atakapain Bidias to the south. The
Caddo culture was an indigenous development strongly influenced by the Mississippian
tradition of the Lower Mississippi Valley (Story 1990:323; Wycoff 1971) while the
Bidias cultural development was strongly influenced by the Gulf Coast Goose Creek
tradition around 200 B.C. or from the Tchefuncte complex in western Louisiana (Ricklis
2004:200). The Caddo culture is divided into Formative, Early, Middle and Late phases.
The phases indicate changes in socio-political, habitation and material culture with a
stratified social structure developed, corresponding to the chiefdom level as first defined
by Service (1962, 1975). Smith (1995:14) describes the Bidias as less advanced as the
Caddo in material culture and subsistence strategies relying less on agriculture and more
on the hunting/gathering traditions of their Atakapain ancestors. The Historic period
(1680-present) marks a transition from the native population’s domination of the area, to
the European immigrant’s establishment of farms, towns, and counties. The earliest

4

Anglo habitation occurred to the north of the project area in Nacogdoches along the El
Camino Real in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries. The immigration of Americans
in the early nineteenth century lead to Texas Independence and is incorporation into the
United States. Agriculture and Logging dominated the early economy. Today, the area
remains largely agricultural and the timber and oil industries currently play a prominent
role in the area’s commercial enterprises (Long 2011).

RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODOLOGY
The investigations were performed in compliance with the Texas Antiquities
Code following survey standards described by the THC (2013) and report guidelines set
forth by the CTA (2005b). All fieldwork and reporting comply with the ethics standards
of the Texas Archaeological Society and the Register of Professional Archaeologists.
Before initiating fieldwork, DETAC conducted a records and literature review
using the Texas Archaeological Site Atlas (THC 2013). The atlas contains a current
database with published and unpublished data regarding cultural resource surveys, location
maps, and cultural resources records. In addition, these records show State Archaeological
Landmarks (SAL) and NRHP eligibility of previously recorded sites.
DETAC conducted a intensive pedestrian survey of the area using shovel testing
(near proposed ditches and culverts) and visual examination of the existing road surface to
locate sites (Martin personal communication 2013). Shovel testing included excavating an
area approximately 30 centimeters (cm) in diameter in 10 cm (4 inch (in)) levels down to
the clay substrate or 90 cm (35 in). Shovel test locations were recorded with Ashtech GPS
units with sub-meter post-processing accuracy. Notes were made about soil color, texture,
and shovel test depth.

RESULTS
The literature search and records review of the Texas Archaeological Site Atlas
(2013) found the closest archaeological survey was for a pipeline roughly 2.9 km (1.8 mi)
southeast of the project area (Turpin 2010). The closest documented archaeological site
is 41NA348, a standing 1920s farmhouse roughly 1.9 km (1.2 mi) southwest of the
project area. There is also the Taliaferro Barret historical grave marker in the Melrose
Baptist Cemetery roughly 3.2 km (2.0 mi) northeast of the project area. There are no
previously recorded archaeological sites, archaeological surveys, or historical markers
within one mile of the project area.

Red Tip Road
Red Tip Road extends 540 m (1780 ft) between CR 411 at the west end and John
Hill Road on the east end. Construction will include grading the existing road surface
and adding gravel. Drainage ditches may be necessary on the upslope side of the road
near an intermittent drain crossing. Soils east and west of the drainage are Lilbert loamy
fine sand (35) while soils in the drainage are Sacul fine sandy loam (56) with steep slopes
between 5 and 20 percent. Lilbert series soils are described as 70 cm (28 in) of loamy
fine sand over sandy clay loam. Sacul series soils are described as fine sandy loam
approximately 50 cm (20 in) deep over clay (NRCS 2013).
The visual inspection of Red Tip road found the current road surface eroded with
deep ruts well below the natural ground surface everywhere except for where the road
crosses a sandstone outcrop near Shovel Test 8 and at the culvert over the drainage. The
stream crossing is built up approximately 5 m (17 ft) above the stream channel. Shovel
Tests 5-8, 11, and 12 were excavated near the drainage on the upslope side of the road
where ditches will be necessary. Shovel testing found red and yellowish brown clay
loam 20 to 30 cm deep over red clay. Most of the top soil was a secondary deposit of
material eroded from nearby uplands (Table 1 and Figure 2). No cultural resources were
found in the shovel testing or the surface inspection. No further work is recommended
for the proposed road improvements.

West Loop
West Loop of Melrose South Circle is a 913 m (3000 ft) loop at the south end of
John Hill Road. Construction will include grading the existing road surface and adding
gravel where needed. Drainage ditches may be necessary on the upslope side of the road
at the northwest corner of the loop and at a draw along the northern portion of the loop.
Soils are described as Lilbert loamy fine sand (35) with 70 cm (28 in) of loamy fine sand
over sandy clay loam (NRCS 2013).
The visual inspection of West Loop found the current road surface eroded with
deep ruts along the west and north ends of the loop. The south side of the loop is a dirt
surface, but a gravel surface was observed adjacent to the dirt surface. New gravel will
be added to the gravel surface and traffic redirected to the gravel surface. Exposed soil
profiles along the edges of the road revealed the loamy fine sand A horizon was only 20
cm (8 in) deep. The road surface was mostly exposed B horizon or C horizon (parent
material).

The drainage crossing is built up approximately 50 cm (20 in) above the

channel; there is a small culvert underneath the road surface and new gravel on the road
surface. Shovel Tests 1-4, 9, and 10 were excavated near the drainage on the north side
of the loop and at the northeast corner of the loop where a second drainage culvert and
ditch may be necessary. Shovel testing found 20 to 30 cm (8 to 12 in) of brown and
reddish brown loamy sand and sandy clay loam over red clay (Table 1 and Figure 2). No
cultural resources were found in the shovel testing or the surface inspection. No further
work is recommended for the proposed road improvements.

East Loop
East Loop of Melrose South Circle is a 1,196 m (3,924 ft) loop at the south end of
John Hill Road. Construction will include grading the existing road surface and adding
gravel. Drainage ditches will not be necessary along the road as the only drainage
observed (along the north side of the loop) has a large culvert with an asphalt surface and
adequate drainage on the up-slope side. Soils are described as Lilbert loamy fine sand
(35) with 70 cm (28 in) of loamy fine sand over sandy clay loam (NRCS 2013).
The visual inspection of East Loop found the south side of the loop paralleling a
gravel surface and the east and north sides of the loop eroded to expose parent material.

9

New gravel will be added to the gravel surface and traffic redirected to the gravel surface
on the south side of the loop. The north and east sides of the loop will be graded and
gravel added to the surface. No shovel tests were excavated as the existing culvert and
ditches are adequate (Figure 2). No cultural resources were found during the surface
inspection of the exposed ground surface. No further work is recommended for the
proposed road improvements.

SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS
The proposed Nacogdoches County road improvements include clearing and
grading existing unimproved dirt roads followed by adding a gravel surface where needed
to three existing unimproved dirt roads (Red Tip Road, West Loop, and East Loop).
Ditches and culverts will be excavated at existing drainages. Combined, these three
roads are approximately 2.6 km (1.6 mi) long. A surface inspection of all three existing
unimproved road surfaces found most of the surfaces eroded with deep ruts well below
the natural ground surface everywhere except along the existing drainages where culverts
were in place under the road surface. The excavation of 12 shovel tests near proposed
ditch locations found soils similar to the NRCS descriptions but shallower or sediments
that were secondary deposits from erosion upslope.
No cultural resources were documented during the surface inspection and no
artifacts were found in the shovel testing effort. Based on the shovel test results and the
visual examination, there is little chance of encountering undiscovered cultural resources
in the project area; however, in the event that human remains and/or archaeological
materials are discovered during construction, then the project activity will immediately
cease and the THC shall be notified of the discovery. DETAC requests concurrence with
a determination of “no effect” to properties listed or eligible for the NRHP as defined by
the National Historic Preservation Act.
