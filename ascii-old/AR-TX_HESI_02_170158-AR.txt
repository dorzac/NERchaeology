MANAGEMENT SUMMARY

Horizon Environmental Services, Inc. (Horizon) was selected by Kalahari Resorts, on
behalf of the city of Round Rock, to conduct a cultural resources inventory survey and assessment
for the proposed development of an approximately 77.3-hectare (191.0-acre) tract in Round Rock,
Williamson County, Texas. The proposed tract consists of a largely undeveloped agricultural
parcel bounded on the northwest by US Highway (US) 79, on the southwest by Kenney Fort
Boulevard, and on the southeast by the channel of Brushy Creek. The 77.3-hectare (191.0-acre)
tract represents the proposed site of a hotel, convention center, water park, and ancillary facilities
(e.g., parking lots, driveways, and associated utilities).
The 77.3-hectare (191.0-acre) tract that is currently proposed for development is part of a
larger 141.6-hectare (350.0-acre) tract that Horizon archeologists surveyed for cultural resources
in December 2015 and January 2016 as part of a due diligence effort for Bury, Inc., on behalf of
Kalahari Resorts, to determine if any significant cultural resources were present. At that time, the
property was privately owned, and no federal or state lands, permits, licenses, funds, or agency
involvement had been identified in connection with the proposed development of the project area.
During the prior survey, Horizon archeologists recorded eight cultural resources sites within the
larger 141.6-hectare (350.0-acre) tract, including five historic-age farmsteads, a scatter of historicage domestic debris in a plowed field, a linear historic-age agricultural feature, and a portion of
one previously recorded prehistoric archeological site (41WM12).
The proposed development of the 77.3-hectare (191.0-acre) tract currently under
consideration is being sponsored by the city of Round Rock, which also now owns the property.
As the city of Round Rock is a political subdivision of the state of Texas, the proposed project falls
under the jurisdiction of the Antiquities Code of Texas (Natural Resources Code, Title 9,
Chapter 191). At this time, no federal agency permits, licenses, or funding have been identified
in connection with the project. As the proposed project represents a publicly sponsored
undertaking, the project sponsor is required to provide the Texas Historical Commission (THC),
which serves as the State Historic Preservation Office (SHPO) for the state of Texas, with an
opportunity to review and comment on the project’s potential to adversely affect historic properties
considered eligible for designation as State Antiquities Landmarks (SAL) under the Antiquities
Code of Texas.

Management Summary

While no state or federal laws applied to the project at the time the cultural resources
survey of the larger 141.6-hectare (350.0-acre) tract was performed in December 2015 and
January 2016, the survey was conducted in conformance with state guidelines for cultural
resources surveys. Since that time, the city of Round Rock has purchased the 77.3-hectare
(191.0-acre) tract currently proposed for development. This smaller tract falls entirely within the
boundaries of the larger tract that was previously surveyed for cultural resources, and no
additional field investigations were warranted in connection with the proposed undertaking. The
THC therefore issued an “after the fact” Texas Antiquities Permit (no. 8380) for the project under
which the SAL eligibility assessments for the previously recorded cultural resources and the
technical report would be prepared and reviewed.
From December 28 to 30, 2015, Horizon archeologists Briana Smith and Elizabeth Sefton,
under the overall direction of Russell K. Brownlow, Principal Investigator, performed an intensive
cultural resources survey of accessible portions of what were then known as the Bison, Doyle,
and Keller tracts (the western and central portions of the original survey area). Due to recent
heavy rains, a portion of this area was covered in standing water and was largely inaccessible for
survey. From January 19 to 20, 2016, Horizon archeologists Elizabeth Sefton and Jacob Lyons
conducted an intensive cultural resources survey of what was then known as the Krienke tract
(the eastern portion of the original survey area). The majority of the project area was covered in
plowed agricultural fields, though the fields were not planted at the time of the survey, affording
100% visibility of the modern ground surface in most areas. The northernmost portion of the
Krienke tract consisted of a meadow covered in medium-tall grasses, though this portion of the
original survey area falls largely to the east of the current project area. The southern margin of
the project area along the banks of Brushy Creek was characterized by a lightly wooded band of
deciduous forest. Visibility of the modern ground surface in the latter areas ranged from 50% to
75% depending on the density of vegetative ground cover.
In addition to pedestrian walkover, the Texas State Minimum Archeological Survey
Standards (TSMASS) require a minimum of 1 shovel test per 1.2 hectares (3.0 acres) for project
areas measuring between 40.8 and 80.9 hectares (101.0 and 200.0 acres) in size. As such, a
total of 64 shovel tests would be required within the 77.3-hectare (191.0-acre) project area.
Horizon excavated 81 shovel tests within the project area, thereby exceeding the TSMASS
requirements for a project area of this size. Shovel testing revealed the presence of dense, wet,
clayey sediments throughout the project area. Most sediments exhibited signs of disturbance
from plowing, and limestone gravels derived from underlying bedrock were observed in a few
shovel tests at depths ranging from 10.0 to 40.0 centimeters (3.9 to 15.7 inches) below surface.
Shovel testing was capable of fully penetrating Holocene-age sediments with the potential to
contain archeological deposits.
The 77.3-hectare (191.0-acre) tract currently proposed for development includes all or
portions of four of the cultural resources sites previously recorded during Horizon’s 2015-2016
survey, including three historic-age farmsteads (41WM1379, 41WM1380, and 41WM1381) and a
portion of a previously recorded prehistoric archeological site (41WM12). At the Texas
Archeological Research Laboratory’s (TARL) request, a historic-age cultural component
consisting of a scatter of domestic debris and a linear agricultural feature was incorporated within

vi

Archeological and Historical Investigations of the Proposed
191.0-acre Kalahari Resorts Tract, Round Rock, Williamson County, Texas

previously recorded prehistoric archeological site 41WM12 instead of being recorded as a
separate archeological site.
Based on the results of the survey-level investigations of the project area documented in
this report, no potentially significant cultural resources would be affected by the proposed
undertaking. In accordance with 36 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) 800.4, Horizon has made
a reasonable and good-faith effort to identify historic properties within the project area. No cultural
resources were identified that meet the criteria for designation as SALs according to 13 TAC 26,
and no further archeological investigations or historical research are recommended in connection
with the proposed undertaking. However, it should be noted that human burials are protected
under the Texas Health and Safety Code. In the event that any human remains or burial objects
are inadvertently discovered at any point during construction, use, or ongoing maintenance in the
project area, even in previously surveyed areas, all work should cease immediately at the location
of the inadvertent discovery until a qualified archeologist can assess the find, and the THC should
be notified of the discovery.

Archeological and Historical Investigations of the Proposed
191.0-acre Kalahari Resorts Tract, Round Rock, Williamson County, Texas

1.0 INTRODUCTION

Horizon Environmental Services, Inc. (Horizon) was selected by Kalahari Resorts, on
behalf of the city of Round Rock, to conduct a cultural resources inventory survey and assessment
for the proposed development of an approximately 77.3-hectare (191.0-acre) tract in Round Rock,
Williamson County, Texas. The proposed tract consists of a largely undeveloped agricultural
parcel bounded on the northwest by US Highway (US) 79, on the southwest by Kenney Fort
Boulevard, and on the southeast by the channel of Brushy Creek. The 77.3-hectare (191.0-acre)
tract represents the proposed site of a hotel, convention center, water park, and ancillary facilities
(e.g., parking lots, driveways, and associated utilities) (Figures 1-1 and 1-2).
The 77.3-hectare (191.0-acre) tract that is currently proposed for development is part of a
larger 141.6-hectare (350.0-acre) tract that Horizon archeologists surveyed for cultural resources
in December 2015 and January 2016 as part of a due diligence effort for Bury, Inc., on behalf of
Kalahari Resorts, to determine if any significant cultural resources were present. At that time, the
property was privately owned, and no federal or state lands, permits, licenses, funds, or agency
involvement had been identified in connection with the proposed development of the project area.
During the prior survey, Horizon archeologists recorded eight cultural resources sites within the
larger 141.6-hectare (350.0-acre) tract, including five historic-age farmsteads, a scatter of historicage domestic debris in a plowed field, a linear historic-age agricultural feature, and a portion of
one previously recorded prehistoric archeological site (41WM12).
The proposed development of the 77.3-hectare (191.0-acre) tract currently under
consideration is being sponsored by the city of Round Rock, which now owns the property. As
the city of Round Rock is a political subdivision of the state of Texas, the proposed project falls
under the jurisdiction of the Antiquities Code of Texas (Natural Resources Code, Title 9,
Chapter 191). At this time, no federal agency permits, licenses, or funding have been identified
in connection with the project. As the proposed project represents a publicly sponsored
undertaking, the project sponsor is required to provide the Texas Historical Commission (THC),
which serves as the State Historic Preservation Office (SHPO) for the state of Texas, with an
opportunity to review and comment on the project’s potential to adversely affect historic properties
considered eligible for designation as State Antiquities Landmarks (SAL) under the Antiquities
Code of Texas.

Chapter 1.0: Introduction

While no state or federal laws applied to the project at the time the cultural resources
survey of the larger 141.6-hectare (350.0-acre) tract was performed in December 2015 and
January 2016, the survey was conducted in conformance with state guidelines for cultural
resources surveys. Since that time, the city of Round Rock has purchased the 77.3-hectare
(191.0-acre) tract currently proposed for development. This smaller tract falls entirely within the
boundaries of the larger tract that was previously surveyed for cultural resources, and no
additional field investigations were warranted in connection with the proposed undertaking. The
THC therefore issued an “after the fact” Texas Antiquities Permit (no. 8380) for the project under
which the SAL eligibility assessments for the previously recorded cultural resources and the
technical report would be prepared and reviewed.
From December 28 to 30, 2015, Horizon archeologists Briana Smith and Elizabeth Sefton,
under the overall direction of Russell K. Brownlow, Principal Investigator, performed an intensive
cultural resources survey of accessible portions of what were then known as the Bison, Doyle,
and Keller tracts (the western and central portions of the original survey area, which compose the
majority of the current project area). Due to recent heavy rains, a portion of this area was covered
in standing water and was largely inaccessible for survey. From January 19 to 20, 2016, Horizon
archeologists Elizabeth Sefton and Jacob Lyons conducted an intensive cultural resources survey
of what was then known as the Krienke tract (the eastern portion of the original survey area, which
composes only the northeastern corner of the current project area). The investigation consisted
of an archival review, an intensive pedestrian survey, and the production of a report suitable for
review by the SHPO in accordance with the THC’s Rules of Practice and Procedure, Chapter 26,
Section 27, and the Council of Texas Archeologists’ (CTA) Guidelines for Cultural Resources
Management Reports.
Following this introductory chapter, Chapters 2.0 and 3.0 present the environmental and
cultural backgrounds, respectively, of the project area. Chapter 4.0 describes the results of
background archival research, and Chapter 5.0 discusses cultural resources survey methods.
Chapter 6.0 presents the results of the archeological survey, and Chapter 7.0 summarizes cultural
resources management recommendations for the project. Chapter 8.0 lists the references cited
in the report, and Appendix A summarizes shovel test data.

2.0 ENVIRONMENTAL SETTING

2.1

PHYSIOGRAPHY AND HYDROLOGY

The project area is located in south-central Williamson County, Texas. Williamson County
is situated near the southern end of the Lampasas Cut Plain (Hill 1901; Hill and Vaughn 1900;
Johnson 1931:125) in Central Texas and close to the common junction of three significant
physiographic provinces—the Lampasas Cut Plain, the Edwards Plateau, and the Blackland
Prairie. The Blackland Prairie, the narrow physiographic zone situated between the Edwards
Plateau to the west and the Gulf Coastal Plain to the east, is a low, rolling land that extends in a
narrow band along the eastern edge of the Balcones Fault Zone from the Red River Valley in
northeastern Texas to the southern edge of the Edwards Plateau. This is an area of low
topographic relief and poor drainage in which water often ponds after rainstorms and streams flow
at very gentle gradients. The Edwards Plateau and Balcones Escarpment are associated with a
great fault system that arcs across Texas to form a distinct boundary between uplands composed
primarily of limestone bedrock and lower plains composed mostly of softer rocks. In places, this
boundary is marked by an abrupt scarp (the Balcones Escarpment) and in others by a more
gradational ramp, but the entire length of this transition zone is a major ecotone in terms of
topography, bedrock, hydrology, soil, vegetation, and animal life.
The Lampasas Cut Plain is a roughly triangular area of rolling hill country in central and
north-central Texas situated between the Brazos and Colorado rivers ranging in elevation from
230.0 to 400.0 meters (754.0 to 1,312.0 feet) above mean sea level (amsl). The Lampasas Cut
Plain forms a limestone upland that has been dissected by the Brazos River and its tributaries,
resulting in landforms characterized by generally rounded uplands cut by moderately broad,
shallow valleys. Soil is thin to absent on the bedrock and supports a mixed savanna flora,
whereas soil is moderately deep in valley floors, where it supports mixed riparian woodlands and
forests. Karst features include sinks, caves, and rockshelters, but such are neither common nor
extensive. Edwards chert is locally abundant but not widespread across the Lampasas Cut Plain
and is of high quality in some places.
Hydrologically, the project area is situated within the Brazos River basin. The project area
is located on a paleoterrace that forms an interfluve between the channels of Brushy Creek to the
south and Chandler Branch to the north. Chandler Branch discharges into Brushy Creek a short
distance east of the project area near the intersection of US 79 and Red Bud Lane, and Brushy

HJN 170158 AR

Chapter 2.0: Environmental Setting

Creek continues Brushy Creek flows generally northeastward to its confluence with the Little River
in Milam County. The Little River, in turn, flows a short distance eastward and empties into the
Brazos River. The Brazos River flows southeastward across the Blackland Prairie and Gulf
Coastal Plain, ultimately discharging into the Gulf of Mexico a short distance northeast of East
Matagorda Bay.

2.2

GEOLOGY AND GEOMORPHOLOGY

Geologically, the project area is situated on Late Pleistocene fluviatile terrace deposits
(Barnes 1974). Geomorphologically, the project area encompasses a mosaic of Pleistocene-age
Holocene-age terrace settings (Table 2-1; Figure 2-1) (NRCS 2017). The terraces of Brushy
Creek are characterized by the Oakalla soils, 0 to 1% slopes, channeled, frequently flooded (Oc),
soil unit, which consists of deep deposits of alluvial silty clay loam sediments of Holocene age.
The remainder of the project area is characterized by various clayey and gravelly soil units that
are composed of Pleistocene-age alluvial fills. Other things being equal, the Holocene-age
sediments on the floodplain and lower terraces of Brushy Creek along the southeastern margin
of the project area have the potential for buried archeological deposits, whereas archeological
materials in the paleoterrace/upland settings that characterize the rest of the project area would
be expected to occur in surficial or shallowly buried contexts that likely would have experienced
some degree of erosion and disturbances from historical farming practices and therefore lack
integrity.

CLIMATE

Evidence for climatic change from the Pleistocene to the present is most often obtained
through studies of pollen and faunal sequences (Bryant and Holloway 1985; Collins 1995). Bryant
and Holloway (1985) present a sequence of climatic change for nearby east-central Texas from
the Wisconsin Full Glacial period (22,500 to 14,000 B.P.) through the Late Glacial period
(14,000 to 10,000 B.P.) to the Post-Glacial period (10,000 B.P. to present). Evidence from the
Wisconsin Full Glacial period suggests that the climate in east-central Texas was considerably
cooler and more humid than at present. Pollen data indicate that the region was more heavily
forested in deciduous woodlands than during later periods (Bryant and Holloway 1985). The Late
Glacial period was characterized by slow climatic deterioration and a slow warming and/or drying
trend (Collins 1995). In east-central Texas, the deciduous woodlands were gradually replaced by
grasslands and post oak savannas (Bryant and Holloway 1985). During the Post-Glacial period,
the east-central Texas environment appears to have been more stable. The deciduous forests
had long since been replaced by prairies and post oak savannas. The drying and/or warming
trend that began in the Late Glacial period continued into the mid-Holocene, at which point there
appears to have been a brief amelioration to more mesic conditions lasting from roughly 6,000 to
5,000 B.P. Recent studies by Bryant and Holloway (1985) indicate that modern environmental
conditions in east-central Texas were probably achieved by 1,500 years ago.
Williamson County is located within the south-central climatic division. The modern
climate is typically dry to subhumid with long, hot summers and short, mild winters. The climate
is influenced primarily by tropical maritime air masses from the Gulf of Mexico, but it is modified
by polar air masses. Tropical maritime air masses predominate throughout spring, summer, and
fall. Modified polar air masses are dominant in winter and provide a continental climate
characterized by considerable variations in temperature.
On average throughout the past century, precipitation and temperature manifest regional
clines with mean annual precipitation totals declining fairly regularly from east to west and mean
annual temperature declining equally evenly from northwest to southeast (Larkin and Bomar
1983:18, 50). Climate has fluctuated from subtropical humid to subtropical subhumid in western
Williamson County. Average annual precipitation totals 81.3 centimeters (32 inches) and
temperature averages 19°C (67°F) annually, ranging from 36°C (96°F) in August (the warmest
month) to 15°C (59°F) in January (the coldest month). During this time, however, drier periods
lasting from three to seven years, when total annual rainfall ranged from 30.5 to 63.5 centimeters
(12.0 to 25.0 inches) were followed by abnormally wet years with 114.3 to 127.0 centimeters
(45.0 to 50.0 inches) of rainfall.
Two annual precipitation peaks, which typically occur in May and September, are
associated with frontal storms that form when southward-moving cool air masses collide with
warm, moist air masses moving inland from the Gulf of Mexico (Bomar 1983; Carr 1967). The
topographic discontinuity along the Balcones Escarpment lies directly in the path of the Gulf storm
trace and increases the lift in convective storms to produce extreme amounts of rainfall (Baker
1975). Two extreme examples are the excess of 91.4 centimeters (36.0 inches) of rain that fell
within an 18-hour period in the vicinity of Thrall, Texas, in September 1921, and the 55.9-

centimeter (22.0-inch) deluge that fell in less than three hours near O’Harris, Texas, in May 1935
(Baker 1975). Lower rainfall amounts are characteristic of winter and late summer. In winter,
frontal storms pass so frequently that there is little time for moisture to increase, and prevailing
upper-level winds from west to east often dominate over meridional flow, meaning that much of
the available moisture is derived from the Pacific rather than from the Gulf of Mexico. In summer,
cool fronts rarely penetrate into the region, and rainfall occurs primarily as localized, thermal
convective storms.

FLORA AND FAUNA

The project area is in the southwestern portion of the Texan biotic province (Blair 1950),
an intermediate zone between the forests of the Austroriparian and Carolinian provinces and the
grasslands of the Kansan, Balconian, and Tamaulipan provinces. Some species reach the limits
of their ecological range within the Texan province. The boundary, characterized as
“approximate,” between Blair’s (1950) Texan and Balconian provinces passes through western
Williamson County in the vicinity of the project area.
The fauna associated with this region are represented by a mixture of species from the
Austroriparian, Tamaulipan, Chihuahuan, Kansan, Balconian, and Texan biotic provinces.
Common mammalian species include white-tailed deer, opossum, eastern cottontail rabbit,
raccoon, striped skunk, hispid cotton rat, white-footed mouse, nine-banded armadillo, and fox
squirrel. Common bird species include northern bobwhite, eastern meadowlark, mourning dove,
killdeer, field sparrow, red-tailed hawk, turkey vulture, belted kingfisher, and mockingbird. Reptile
and amphibian species common to this biotic zone include six-lined racerunner, rat snake, eastern
hognose snake, Gulf Coast toad, Texas spiny lizard, rough green snake, copperhead, western
diamondback rattlesnake, green treefrog, Blanchard’s cricket frog, diamondback water snake,
Houston toad, and green anole. Although small herds of bison and antelope were common during
the late prehistoric and early historic periods, these species are no longer native to this region
(Jurney et al. 1989:13-14).

3.0 CULTURAL BACKGROUND

The project area is located within the Central Texas archeological region. The indigenous
human inhabitants of Central Texas practiced a generally nomadic hunting and gathering lifestyle
throughout all of prehistory, and, in contrast to much of the rest of North America, mobility and
settlement patterns do not appear to have changed markedly through time in this region.

3.1

PALEOINDIAN PERIOD (9,200 TO 6,000 B.C.)

The initial human occupations in the New World can now be confidently extended back
before 10,000 B.C. (Dincauze 1984; Haynes et al. 1984; Kelly and Todd 1988; Lynch 1990;
Meltzer 1989). Evidence from Meadowcroft Rockshelter in Pennsylvania suggests that humans
were present in Eastern North America as early as 14,000 to 16,000 years ago (Adovasio et al.
1990), while more recent discoveries at Monte Verde in Chile provide unequivocal evidence for
human occupation in South America by at least 12,500 years ago (Dillehay 1989, 1997; Meltzer
et al. 1997). Most archeologists have historically discounted claims of much earlier human
occupation during the Pleistocene glacial period. However, recent investigations of the Buttermilk
Creek Complex in Bell County, Texas, have raised the possibility that a pre-Clovis culture may
have been present in North America as early as 15,500 years ago (Waters et al. 2011).
The earliest generalized evidence for human activities in Central Texas is represented by
the PaleoIndian period (9,200 to 6,000 B.C.) (Black 1989). This stage coincided with ameliorating
climatic conditions following the close of the Pleistocene epoch that witnessed the extinction of
herds of mammoth, horse, camel, and bison. Cultures representing various periods within this
stage are characterized by series of distinctive, relatively large, often fluted, lanceolate projectile
points. These points are frequently associated with spurred end scrapers, gravers, and bone
foreshafts. PaleoIndian groups are often inferred to have been organized into egalitarian bands
consisting of a few dozen individuals that practiced a fully nomadic subsistence and settlement
pattern. Due to poor preservation of floral materials, subsistence patterns in Central Texas are
known primarily through the study of faunal remains. Subsistence focused on the exploitation of
plants, small animals, fish, and shellfish, even during the PaleoIndian period. There is little
evidence in this region for hunting of extinct megafauna, as has been documented elsewhere in
North America. Rather, a broad-based subsistence pattern appears to have been practiced
throughout all prehistoric time periods. In Central Texas, the PaleoIndian stage is divided into
two periods based on recognizable differences in projectile point styles. These include the Early
PaleoIndian Period, which is recognized based on large, fluted projectile points (i.e., Clovis,

HJN 170158 AR

11

Chapter 3.0: Cultural Background

Folsom, Dalton, San Patrice, and Big Sandy), and the Late PaleoIndian period, which is
characterized by unfluted lanceolate points (i.e., Plainview, Scottsbluff, Meserve, and Angostura).

3.2

ARCHAIC PERIOD (6,000 B.C. TO A.D. 800)

The onset of the Hypsithermal drying trend marks the beginning of the Archaic stage
(6,000 B.C. to A.D. 800). This climatic trend marked the beginning of a significant reorientation
of lifestyle throughout most of North America, but this change was far less pronounced in Central
Texas. Elsewhere, the changing climatic conditions and corresponding decrease in the big game
populations forced people to rely more heavily upon a diversified resource base composed of
smaller game and wild plants. In Central Texas, however, this hunting and gathering pattern is
characteristic of most of prehistory. The appearance of a more diversified tool kit, the
development of an expanded groundstone assemblage, and a general decrease in the size of
projectile points are hallmarks of this cultural stage. Material culture shows greater diversity
during this broad cultural period, especially in the application of groundstone technology.
Traditionally, the Archaic period is subdivided into Early, Middle, and Late subperiods. In
Central Texas, the Early Archaic subperiod extends from 6,000 to 3,000 B.C., the Middle Archaic
subperiod extends from 3,000 to 1,000 B.C., and the Late Archaic subperiod covers the
1,000 B.C. to A.D. 800 timeframe. Changes in projectile point morphology are often used as
markers differentiating these three subperiods, though other changes in material culture occurred
as well. Perhaps most markedly, burned rock middens appear during the Middle Archaic
subperiod, continuing into the Late Archaic subperiod, and large cemeteries appear during the
Late Archaic subperiod. In addition, the increasing density of prehistoric sites through time is
often considered to constitute evidence of population growth, though differential preservation
probably at least partially accounts for the lower numbers of older sites.

3.3

LATE PREHISTORIC PERIOD (A.D. 800 TO 1600)

The onset of the Late Prehistoric period (A.D. 800 to 1600) (Black 1989) is defined by the
appearance of the bow and arrow. In Central Texas, pottery also appears during the Late
Prehistoric period (though ceramics appear earlier in Southeast Texas). Use of the atlatl (i.e.,
spearthrower) and spear was generally discontinued during the Late Prehistoric period, though
they continued to be used in the inland subregion of Southeast Texas along with the bow and
arrow through the Late Prehistoric period (Patterson 1980, 1995; Wheat 1953). In Texas, unifacial
arrow points appear to be associated with a small prismatic blade technology. The Late
Prehistoric period is generally divided into the Austin and Toyah phases. Austin phase sites occur
earliest to the north, which has led some researchers (e.g., Prewitt 1985) to suggest that the
Austin phase populations of Central Texas were migrants from the north who lacked the ceramic
industry of the later Toyah phase.

3.4

HISTORIC PERIOD (A.D. 1600 TO PRESENT)

The first European incursion into what is now known as Texas was in 1519, when Álvarez
de Pineda explored the northern shores of the Gulf of Mexico. In 1528, Cabeza de Vaca crossed
South Texas after being shipwrecked along the Texas Coast near Galveston Bay. However,

12

170158_arch_survey_report (rev)

Archeological and Historical Investigations of the Proposed
191.0-acre Kalahari Resorts Tract, Round Rock, Williamson County, Texas

European settlement did not seriously disrupt native ways of life until after 1700. The first half of
the 18th century was the period in which the fur trade and mission system, as well as the first
effects of epidemic diseases, began to seriously disrupt the native culture and social systems.
This process is clearly discernable at the Mitchell Ridge site, where burial data suggest population
declines and group mergers (Ricklis 1994), as well as increased participation on the part of the
Native American population in the fur trade. By the time that heavy settlement of Texas began in
the early 1800s by Anglo-Americans, the indigenous Indian population was greatly diminished.
The earliest known historical occupants of Williamson County were the Tonkawa Indians.1
The Tonkawa traditionally followed buffalo herds on foot and periodically set fire to the prairie to
aid them in their hunts. During the 18th century, however, they made the transition to a horsebased culture and used firearms to a limited extent. Decimated by European diseases and by
warfare with the Cherokee and Comanche, the Tonkawa were generally friendly toward the early
settlers of Williamson County, but were nevertheless removed from Central Texas by the 1850s.
Lipan Apaches and Comanches were also associated with the area that would become
Williamson County. Before the arrival of Europeans in the area, the Lipan Apaches ranged
through the western part of present-day Williamson County, and, after Spanish missions were
established on the San Gabriel River in the 18th century, the Indians frequently raided the
missions for horses. Their enemies, the Comanches, arrived in the area in the 18th century and
lived in parts of the territory of Williamson County until as late as 1838. After they were crowded
out by Anglo settlers, the Comanches continued to raid settlements in the county until the 1860s.
There also appear to have been small numbers of Kiowa, Yojuane, Tawakoni, and Mayeye
Indians living in the county at the time of the earliest Anglo settlements.
While Álvar Núñez Cabeza de Vaca may have traveled through the area in the 16th
century, it was probably first explored by Europeans in the late 17th century, when Capt. Alonso
De León sought a route between San Antonio and the Spanish missions in East Texas that would
serve as a drier alternative to the more southerly Camino Real. The new route passed through
the area of Williamson County along Brushy Creek and the San Gabriel River and was called
Camino de Arriba. In 1716, two explorers in the Spanish service, Louis Juchereau de St. Denis
and Domingo Ramón, led an expedition that passed through the area and camped on Brushy
Creek and the San Gabriel River, naming them respectively Arroyo de las Bendítas Ánimas and
Rio de San Xavier. The San Xavier missions, which were founded in the mid-18th century and
occupied a series of sites along the San Gabriel River, were just across the eastern border of
Williamson County in present-day Milam County, and the area was extensively explored by the
Spanish. During the Mexican period, parts of the county were awarded as land grants, first to
several Mexican families, then as part of Robertson’s colony, but no settlement resulted from
these grants.
Anglo settlement began during the Texas Revolution and the early days of the Republic
of Texas, when the area was part of Milam County. In 1835, in an attempt to strengthen the
frontier against Indian attack, a military post was built near the headwaters of Brushy Creek in

what would become southwestern Williamson County and was named for Capt. John J.
Tumlinson, Jr., the commander of the company of Texas Rangers who garrisoned the post. The
post was abandoned in February of 1836, when its garrison was withdrawn to deal with the
Mexican invasion. In 1838, the first civilian settlement was established by Dr. Thomas Kenney
and a party of settlers who built a fort, named Kenney’s Fort, on Brushy Creek near the site of the
present-day crossing of the Missouri-Kansas-Texas Railroad. Several other sites on Brushy
Creek were settled soon after, but Indian raids kept Anglo settlement in check, and a number of
the early pioneers, including Kenney, were killed by Indians over the next few years.
In 1842, many of the early farms were abandoned when Governor Sam Houston advised
settlers to pull back from the frontier. The Indian threat eased after 1846, and part of the influx of
settlers who came to Texas after its annexation traveled to the frontier along Brushy Creek and
the San Gabriel River. By 1848, there were at least 250 settlers in what was then western Milam
County, and, in the early months of that year, 107 of them signed a petition to organize a new
county. Recognizing that the petitioners needed a seat of local government that was considerably
closer to them than Milam County, the Texas legislature established Williamson County on
March 13, 1848, naming it for prominent judge and soldier Robert M. Williamson. Georgetown,
the county seat, was laid out during the summer of that year, and the district court was in session
by October. According to the census of 1850, Williamson County had a population of
1,379 Anglos and 155 slaves living in agricultural communities on Brushy Creek and the San
Gabriel. As was common in other frontier counties, most of the improved acreage was used to
grow corn. Three families owned 15 or more slaves in 1850, but family farms and subsistence
agriculture remained the norm prior to the Civil War. While most of the settlers had moved to
Texas from other southern states, particularly Tennessee, a substantial contingent came from
Vermilion County, Illinois, and this latter group remained pro-Union and Republican in its political
orientation during the secession crisis.
On the eve of the Civil War, Williamson County had moved beyond the frontier stage and
was a populous, agriculturally diverse county. The Anglo population tripled between 1850 and
1860 to 3,638, while the slave population grew even more dramatically to 891, six times the
number of slaves in 1850. Agricultural pursuits were quite varied and reflected the county’s
geographical diversity. Farmers used the rich blackland soils in the eastern half of the county to
grow wheat and corn. Cotton was introduced in the 1850s, but only 271 bales were grown in
1860, and it was not an important cash crop for most farmers. The early settlers had found large
herds of wild cattle in the 1840s, and cattle ranching for both home consumption and the market
was widespread throughout the county by 1860. The number of cattle on county ranches had
more than tripled from 11,973 head in 1850 to 38,114 head in 1860. Similarly, the number of
sheep grew from 2,937 producing 3,499 pounds of wool in 1850 to 16,952 sheep and
32,994 pounds of wool in 1860.
Williamson County was marked by political divisions during the secession crisis, divisions
that were carried over into the Civil War and Reconstruction. Unionist sentiment was strong in
the county, and a resolution denouncing secession was adopted by a Texas Constitutional Union
party meeting in Round Rock in 1860. One of the county’s delegates to the secession convention,
Thomas Proctor Hughes, was among the 8 who voted against the ordinance of secession. When

14

170158_arch_survey_report (rev)

Archeological and Historical Investigations of the Proposed
191.0-acre Kalahari Resorts Tract, Round Rock, Williamson County, Texas

the ordinance was referred to a statewide election, Williamson County was one of 19 counties to
oppose it, rejecting secession by 480 to 349 votes. When the war came, most of the citizens of
Williamson County supported the Confederate cause, and at least five companies were raised in
the county; an independent “spy” company under James O. Rice, a company of Texas Rangers
for border defense under William C. Dalrymple, and companies in the Fourth, Seventh, and
Sixteenth Texas Cavalry regiments. While some of those who had opposed secession became
active Confederate supporters, others remained loyal to the Union and fled to Mexico or the North,
and a number enlisted in the Union army. In July 1863, eight Williamson County men were caught
by Confederate troops while traveling to Mexico and were hanged near Bandera, Texas, and
other Unionists were persecuted during the war. The pattern of violence within the community
continued into the summer following the end of the war, when several men were arrested for
“flagrant crimes” and “illegal persecution of Union men.” In September 1865, a mass meeting of
the citizens of Williamson County was held on the San Gabriel River near Georgetown, and the
gathering set a general tone of reconciliation, which seems to have characterized the
Reconstruction period in Williamson County, a period that ended with the return of county
government to conservative Democratic control in 1869. Freed slaves formed several new
communities, and the county seems to have been free of much of the political and racial strife
that occurred in other Texas counties during Reconstruction. On the other hand, there was a
great deal of crime, much of it violent, in the latter 19th century. Horse and cattle thieves and
some of the more famous outlaws of the day, such as Sam Bass and John Wesley Hardin, preyed
on the property of citizens, and long-term family feuds and drunken brawls at the various saloons
in the towns added to the toll of homicides.
Though the Civil War had caused little material damage in the area, the county was a
much poorer place in 1870 than it had been in 1860. The total value of farms had fallen from
$833,418 to $389,239 and the value of livestock from $823,653 to $341,794. The economic
recovery in the 1870s was aided by the growth of the cattle and sheep industries and a dramatic
expansion of cotton farming. Various feeder routes to the Chisholm Trail passed through
Williamson County, and many cattle drives passed through or originated in the county from the
1860s through the early 1880s. With the coming of the railroads to the county in the 1870s,
Taylor, in the eastern part of the county, became an important rail center for the cattle trade.
Cattle-raising, after declining somewhat in importance in the early 20th century, was again a major
part of the agricultural economy by 1950, and, in 1969, ranchers owned a record 65,093 cattle.
Sheep- and goat-raising followed a similar pattern. Sheep ranching recovered its pre-war level
by 1880 and peaked at 39,961 sheep and 171,752 pounds of wool in 1890, then declined in the
late 19th and early 20th centuries to 13,397 sheep and 39,458 pounds in 1920. The industry
revived in the 1930s and reached a new high of 59,919 sheep and 336,494 pounds of wool in
1959. Mohair became a significant agricultural product by 1930 and reached a peak in 1959,
when 44,668 goats produced 209,098 pounds of mohair. Cotton, the second boom industry in
Williamson County, developed at about the same time as the cattle industry. As early as 1869,
the editor of the Georgetown Watchman was advising farmers to “make cotton, but do not, by any
means, neglect the grain crop-diversity.” Cotton production, which had been insignificant before
the war, rose to successive heights of 4,217 bales in 1880, 33,945 bales in 1890, and
80,514 bales in 1900. From 1900 to 1901, Williamson County ginned more cotton than any county

HJN 170158 AR

15

Chapter 3.0: Cultural Background

in Texas except Ellis County. The number of improved acres increased almost tenfold from 1870
to 1880 and doubled again to 306,881 acres by 1890. The proportion of cropland used for cotton
production moved from about one-third of the total in 1880 to a high of 77% in 1910, and cotton
was grown on 73% of the cropland as late as 1930. Dramatic changes in land tenure attended
the shift to cotton production. As late as 1880, 1,183 of the 1,538 farms, or 77%, were still worked
by owners. By 1890, only 43% of the farms were operated by owners, and the percentage of
owner-operators remained at 40% until the 1920s, when it dropped still further to 29% in 1930.
Farm tenancy rates began to decline during the Great Depression with the shift away from cotton
and other staple crops and by 1959 had dropped to 36% of the county’s farmers.
Both the cattle and the cotton booms were aided by the improved communications
available in the county in the later 19th century. The International-Great Northern Railroad, which
later was consolidated with the Missouri Pacific, was built across the eastern part of the county in
1876 and led to the founding of Taylor (now Williamson County’s third largest city) and Hutto and
to the relocation of Round Rock. It also opened up large areas in eastern Williamson County to
commercial farming. The Taylor, Bastrop, and Houston Railway, which was eventually
consolidated with the Missouri, Kansas, and Texas Railway, was built in the 1880s and aided in
the development of Taylor, Granger, and Bartlett. Roads were generally poor throughout the
county in the early 20th century. There were 11,882 automobiles in the county by 1930, and
extensive improvements, including blacktopping, of all major roads took place in the 1930s.
The county also became more ethnically diverse in the later 19th and early 20th centuries.
While there were only 111 inhabitants of foreign birth out of a population of 6,368 in Williamson
County in 1870, significant numbers of Scandinavians, Germans, Czechs, Wends, and Austrians
moved to the county in the 1880s and 1890s. The proportion of foreign-born in the county
population remained at about 10% from 1890 to the 1930s. Mexican immigration reached a
significant level by about 1910, just as Europeans stopped arriving in the county. There were
294 Hispanics in 1900, 732 in 1910, and 4,967, or 11% of the population, in 1930. In 1980,
9,693 residents, or again 11%, were of Hispanic origin. The immigrants added their distinctive
customs and architectural styles to the mix of county life and introduced new religious
denominations. By the time of the Civil War, Williamson County had a number of Baptist and
Methodist churches and several different factions of the Presbyterian Church. Churches of other
denominations were built after the war, and the new emigrants established Lutheran, Catholic,
and Czech Moravian congregations. By 1930, Williamson County had a culturally diverse
population of 44,146 inhabitants. The economy was still overwhelmingly agricultural; only
29 manufacturing establishments employed 347 workers that year. While cotton production was
near its peak in terms of percentage of cropland, the cotton industry was already undergoing a
rapid transformation.
The combined effects of soil depletion, overproduction, and the influx of the boll weevil
had already injured the profitability of the industry by the late 1920s, and the situation of cotton
growers was further worsened by the Great Depression. The black population seems to have
been particularly hard hit by the depression. Of the 944 county families on relief in 1933, 442,
almost half, were black, though blacks constituted only 16% of the population. Various federal
relief programs benefited farmers with farm loans and subsidies, and, in 1936, a total of $204,000

16

170158_arch_survey_report (rev)

Archeological and Historical Investigations of the Proposed

in subsidy checks was issued. The Depression encouraged diversification among farmers and a
shift away from staple crops to livestock. Between 1930 and 1940, the number of acres used for
cotton-growing fell by almost half, and cotton production went from 68,266 to 36,890 bales.
Cropland acreage used for corn production increased over the same period by about half, and
wool and mohair production more than doubled to 342,983 and 102,517 pounds, respectively.
While cotton continued to be an important crop in eastern Williamson County, farmers increasingly
turned to other crops like sorghum and wheat and to livestock-raising in the latter 20th century.
Along with such traditional livestock as sheep and cattle, poultry farming played a significant role
in the economy by 1950, when the county was fifth in the state in the production of eggs and
chickens. In 1980, it was 10th in the state in the production of turkeys.
The agricultural diversification of the middle decades of the 20th century was followed by
significant social and economic changes in the 1960s, 1970s, and 1980s. The black population,
which had remained at between 15 and 18% of the total in the early and mid-20th century, began
to decline, both proportionately and in real numbers, from the 1940s on and had fallen to 4,111,
or about 5%, by 1980. As in other areas of Texas, blacks were relegated to segregated and
inferior housing and educational facilities until the 1960s, when some improvements were brought
about by federal desegregation policies. Along with changes in racial composition, Williamson
County experienced a dramatic increase in population during this period, growing from 37,305
inhabitants in 1970 to an estimated 85,700 inhabitants in 1982, making it 34th in population growth
among counties in the US in the 1970s.

4.0 ARCHIVAL RESEARCH

Prior to initiating fieldwork, Horizon personnel reviewed the THC’s online Texas
Archeological Sites Atlas (TASA), the National Park Service’s (NPS) online National Register
Information System (NRIS), the Texas Archeological Research Laboratory’s (TARL) files, and the
Texas State Historical Association’s (TSHA) The Handbook of Texas Online for information on
previously recorded cultural resources sites and previous archeological investigations conducted
within a 1.6-kilometer (1.0-mile) radius of the project area. This archival research revealed that
31 previously recorded archeological sites and two cemeteries occur within 1.6 kilometers
(1.0 mile) of the project area (Figure 4-1; Table 4-1) (NPS 2017; THC 2017). The 31 previously
recorded archeological sites include 16 aboriginal sites, eight historic-age sites, six multiplecomponent sites containing both aboriginal and historic-age cultural materials, and one site for
which no information is available. Aboriginal cultural components typically consist of lithic artifact
scatters or campsites of unknown prehistoric age, though temporally diagnostic artifacts
associated with the Early Archaic to Late Prehistoric periods were observed on some of the sites.
Historic-age components typically consist of the remnants of late 19th- to early 20th-century
homesteads and farmsteads, both with and without extant architectural features. One of the
previously recorded archeological sites, 41WM465 (Kenney’s Fort), is a historic property that has
been listed on the NRHP and designated as an SAL.
One of the previously recorded archeological sites, 41WM12, falls partially within the
boundaries of the current project area. Originally investigated by E.B. Jelks and E.M. Davis in
1958, site 41WM12 consists of a largely surficial scatter of aboriginal lithic artifacts that traverses
a series of plowed agricultural fields on the northern terrace of Brushy Creek. The site extends
in a long, northeast-to-southwest-oriented band through the southeastern portion of the project
area and continues to the west. The site has been officially investigated multiple times between
1958 and 2007. Cultural materials observed on the site over the years consist of a sparse scatter
of lithic cores, bifaces, scrapers, and projectile point fragments. E.M. Davis mentions on the
original site form that the base of a Folsom point was reportedly found on the site by a local artifact
collector, but temporally diagnostic artifacts subsequently found on the site have been limited to
a Fresno or Young arrow point and a Bulverde dart point, suggesting prehistoric occupations
ranging from the Late PaleoIndian to Late Prehistoric periods.. Cultural materials are reportedly
constrained to the modern ground surface and to shallowly buried, disturbed contexts within
actively plowed fields. All prior assessments have concluded that site 41WM12 is ineligible for
listing on the NRHP due to the extent of prior disturbances and lack of distinctive characteristics.

All of the remaining previously recorded cultural resources sites are located well beyond
the boundaries of the project area and would not be impacted by the proposed undertaking.
Numerous prior cultural resources surveys have been performed in the vicinity of the
current project area, including three surveys that covered portions of the current project area (see
Figure 4-1). The western margin of the project area was surveyed in 2007 by SWCA
Environmental Consultants in connection with the proposed construction of the right-of-way of the
Arterial “A” roadway (Lawrence 2007). An earlier survey, conducted in 1981 for the US
Environmental Protection Agency, covered a portion of the terraces of Brushy Creek in the
southwestern corner of the project area. A more recent linear survey for a proposed sewer line
traversed the southeastern margin of the project area near Brushy Creek. Collectively, these
prior surveys covered approximately 10% to 15% of the project area. The remainder of the project
area has not been previously surveyed for cultural resources.

Chapter 4.0: Archival Research

In Central Texas, aboriginal cultural resources are relatively common on alluvial terraces
adjacent to prominent streams and springs and in upland settings typically associated with
exposures of gravel deposits containing Edwards Formation chert. Away from streams, clayey
and gravelly sediments are common on and near the modern ground surface throughout Central
Texas. While significant aboriginal sites may occur adjacent to streams that contain deep
Holocene-age alluvial packages, intact aboriginal sites are rare in the uplands. Based on the
physiographic setting of the project area on an interfluve between Brushy Creek to the south and
Chandler Branch to the north, together with the presence of previously recorded aboriginal
archeological sites within the project area and in the surrounding area, the archival research
suggested that the project area has a high potential to contain unrecorded aboriginal cultural
resources. However, due to the relative antiquity of the Pleistocene-age alluvial fill sediments
that comprise the majority of the project area, any aboriginal cultural materials within the project
area would be expected to occur on the modern ground surface or in shallowly buried contexts.
Furthermore, the majority of the project area consists of agricultural fields that have been actively
plowed, planted, and harvested throughout the historical past; as such, any aboriginal cultural
resources likely would occur in disturbed contexts within plowed fields and lack integrity of
context.
Historic-age cultural resources may occur in virtually any physiographic setting and are
especially common in urban settings. At least two historic-age farmsteads are visible within the
project area on historical US Geological Survey (USGS) topographic maps and aerial
photographs. The 1925 USGS topographic map depicts three standing structures within the
project area, including two off the main driveways to the north and one closer to Brushy Creek to
the south (Figure 4-2). The 1949 USGS topographic map shows three standing structures
associated with two separate farmsteads (Figure 4-3). The two northern farmsteads continued to
grow through time, and many of the buildings associated with them are still present within the
project area. The southernmost structure shown on the 1925 USGS map does not appear on any
subsequent USGS maps, though it is visible on a 1954 aerial photograph. It is no longer present
by 1964, the date of the next chronologically sequent aerial photograph examined. As such, the
single structure at this location appears to have been demolished or moved between 1954 and
1964. The two northern farmsteads were documented during the current survey as sites
41WM1379 and 41WM1380, and the southern former structure located was included within
previously recorded site 41WM12 at TARL’s request. Based on the archival data, the proposed
project area was considered to possess a high potential to contain historic-age archeological and
architectural resources.

5.0 SURVEY METHODOLOGY

From December 28 to 30, 2015, Horizon archeologists Briana Smith and Elizabeth Sefton,
under the overall direction of Russell K. Brownlow, Principal Investigator, performed an intensive
cultural resources survey of accessible portions of what were then known as the Bison, Doyle,
and Keller tracts (the western and central portions of the original survey area). Due to recent
heavy rains, a portion of this area was covered in standing water and was largely inaccessible for
survey. From January 19 to 20, 2016, Horizon archeologists Elizabeth Sefton and Jacob Lyons
conducted an intensive cultural resources survey of what was then known as the Krienke tract
(the eastern portion of the original survey area). The majority of the project area was covered in
plowed agricultural fields, though the fields were not planted at the time of the survey, affording
100% visibility of the modern ground surface in most areas (Figures 5-1 and 5-2). The
northernmost portion of the current project area consisted of a meadow covered in ankle-high
grasses (Figure 5-3). The southern margin of the project area along the banks of Brushy Creek
was characterized by a lightly wooded band of deciduous forest (Figure 5-4). Visibility of the
modern ground surface in the latter areas ranged from 50% to 75% depending on the density of
vegetative ground cover.
In addition to pedestrian walkover, the Texas State Minimum Archeological Survey
Standards (TSMASS) require a minimum of 1 shovel test per 1.2 hectares (3.0 acres) for project
areas measuring between 40.8 to 80.9 hectares (101.0 and 200.0 acres) in size. As such, a total
of 64 shovel tests would be required within the 77.3-hectare (191.0-acre) project area. Horizon
excavated 81 shovel tests within the project area, thereby exceeding the TSMASS requirements
for a project area of this size (Figure 5-5). Shovel tests generally measured approximately
30.0 centimeters (11.8 inches) in diameter, and excavated sediments were screened through
0.64-centimeter (0.25-inch) hardware cloth or were trowel-sorted if sediments were too wet and/or
clayey to pass through the screen mesh. Shovel testing revealed the presence of dense, wet,
clayey sediments throughout the project area. Most sediments exhibited signs of disturbance
from plowing, and limestone gravels derived from underlying bedrock were observed in a few
shovel tests at depths ranging from 10.0 to 40.0 centimeters (3.9 to 15.7 inches) below surface.
Shovel testing was capable of fully penetrating Holocene-age sediments with the potential to
contain archeological deposits. The Universal Transverse Mercator (UTM) coordinates of all
shovel tests were determined using hand-held Garmin ForeTrex Global Positioning System (GPS)
devices based on the North American Datum of 1983 (NAD 83). Specific shovel test data for all
81 shovel tests excavated during the survey are summarized in Appendix A.

Three newly recorded archeological sites (41WM1379, 41WM1380, and 41WM1381) and
one previously recorded archeological site (41WM12) were documented during the survey. In
the field, standard site recording forms were used to record pertinent information on location,
physiographic setting, and local environmental characteristics; types and quantities of artifacts
observed; distribution and densities of artifacts; artificial and natural impacts; and the condition of
surface and subsurface archeological deposits. Scaled sketch maps were drawn that illustrated
site boundaries; locations of shovel tests, cultural features, and/or material concentrations; as well
as notable features of the landscape. The sites were thoroughly photo-documented using color
digital photography, and photographic logs were maintained of all photographs taken. Based on
the information recorded on the standard archeological site recording forms in the field, Texas
Archeological Data Site Forms (for newly recorded sites) or Texas Archeological Data Site Update
Forms (for previously recorded sites) were completed by Horizon’s laboratory personnel using the
most current version of the Texas Archeological Research Laboratory’s (TARL) TexSite
archeological data collection software, and the forms were submitted to TARL to obtain
permanent trinomials and/or to update the existing site files, as appropriate.
During the survey, field notes were maintained on terrain, vegetation, soils, landforms,
survey methods, and shovel test results. Digital photographs were taken, and a photographic log
was maintained. Horizon employed a non-collection policy for cultural resources. Diagnostic
artifacts (e.g., projectile points, ceramics, historic materials with maker’s marks) and nondiagnostic artifacts (e.g., lithic debitage, burned rock, historic glass, and metal scrap) were to be
described, sketched, and/or photo-documented in the field and replaced in the same location in
which they were found. No cultural materials were collected during the survey.
The survey methods employed during the survey represented a “reasonable and goodfaith effort” to locate significant archeological sites within the project area as defined in 36 Code
of Federal Regulations (CFR) 800.3.

6.0 RESULTS OF INVESTIGATIONS

The 77.3-hectare (191.0-acre) project area includes all or portions of four of the cultural
resources sites recorded during Horizon’s 2015-2016 survey, including three historic-age
farmsteads (41WM1379, 41WM1380, and 41WM1381) and a portion of a previously recorded
prehistoric archeological site (41WM12) (Figure 6-1). In addition, a scatter of 20th-century
domestic debris and a linear agricultural feature were recorded during the survey that have been
incorporated as a historic-age cultural component within previously recorded prehistoric
archeological site 41WM12 at TARL’s request instead of being recorded as a separate
archeological site. Each site is described individually below. The results of supplemental
architectural evaluations and historical research on sites 41WM1379, 41WM1380, and
41WM1381 provided by Horizon’s historian, Eugene Foster, are included within the appropriate
site descriptions.

6.1

SITE 41WM1379 (BELL-TELANDER FARM)
General Description

Site 41WM1379 consists of the remains of an early to late 20th-century farmstead located
in the north-central portion of the project area approximately 170.0 meters (557.6 feet) west of
site 41WM1380 (Figure 6-2; also see Figure 6-1). The farm is accessed from US 79 to the north
via a private gravel driveway that splits off to the east to provide access to other farmsteads within
the project area (41WM1380 and 41WM1381) as well as outside of the project area to the east.
The 1925 USGS topographic map shows a single building standing on site 41WM1379,
presumably the primary residence at that time (see Figure 4-2). The farm continued to grow
through the 20th century and was occupied and in use at the time of Horizon’s 2015-2016 survey,
though it has since been abandoned. Currently, standing structures on the farm consist of a twostory, wood-frame farm house with a wrap-around porch (Resource A); a small wooden wash
house/shed adjacent to the main house (Resource B); a large, corrugated metal shed with an
adjacent, fenced-in equipment yard behind it (Resource C); a rudimentary shack or agricultural
building with an attached, covered porch (Resource D); an agricultural pole barn with a collapsing
roof (Resource E); a small, wood pump house (Resource F); and a concrete block pump house
(Resource G). The farmstead also contains three concrete foundation features that presumably
represent the locations of former structures that are no longer present. Foundations 1 and 2 are
small, poured concrete slab foundations that may have supported small outbuildings.
Foundation 3 consists of a poured concrete staircase three courses high with an adjacent poured

concrete sidewalk that presumably marks the location of a former house that is no longer present.
Examination of historical maps and aerial photographs suggests that Foundation 3 represents the
former location of a large Folk Victorian house (Resource L) (built ca. 1900) that has been moved
to site 41WM1381 approximately 200.0 meters (656.0 feet) to the northeast (this house was likely
the original house on site 41WM1379 before it was moved). Associated ancillary features on the
farmstead include a covered concrete well and a water pump set within a decorative rubber tire
border. A gravel driveway winds generally north to south through the site, terminating at the
current main house in the southeastern portion of the site. Vegetation on the site at the time of
the survey consisted of mowed grass and scattered oak trees, and the site is surrounded by
agricultural fields. The site is situated on a relatively flat paleoterrace landform at an elevation of
approximately 202.7 meters (665.0 feet) amsl.
US 79 is located roughly 225.0 meters
(738.0 feet) north of the site, and Brushy Creek is located approximately 680.0 meters
(2,230.4 feet) south of the site.
Horizontal and Vertical Extents of Cultural Materials
Based on the extent of cultural features and associated debris, site 41WM1379 measures
approximately 195.0 meters (639.6 feet) north to south by 125.0 meters (410.0 feet) east to west.
Cultural materials on site 41WM1379 appear to be constrained largely or entirely to the
modern ground surface. While no shovel tests were excavated within the site boundaries out of
courtesy to the occupants of the site at the time of the survey, shovel tests excavated in the
surrounding area revealed no evidence of subsurface archeological deposits.
Observed Cultural Features

Resource A—House (ca. 1950)
Resource A, the current primary dwelling on the site, is a square-plan, two-story, woodframe farm house with a two-story bay at the southeastern corner, a single-story wrap-around
porch at the southwestern corner, and a low-pitched hip roof covered in composition shingles
(Figures 6-3 to 6-5). The structure is located in the southeastern portion of the site at the end of
the gravel driveway that provides access to the site. Though the corner bay and the wrap-around
porch with turned wooden porch columns resemble architectural features found on many Folk
Victorian dwellings from the late 19th- to early 20th-century period, this dwelling appears to date
to ca. 1950 and lacks the irregular floor plan and elaborate roof form typical of older Folk Victorian
dwellings. The horizontal siding is synthetic material not original to this dwelling, and all windows
and doors have been replaced in recent years. Associated landscape elements include a
prefabricated metal car shed; a small, decorative windmill; and a storm fence enclosing an animal
pen beneath a grove of large oak trees.

Resource B—Wash House/Shed (ca. 1920)
Resource B, a small domestic outbuilding, is located in the yard area a short distance west
of the current primary dwelling (Resource A) but appears to be older (ca. 1920) (Figure 6-6; also
see Figure 6-5). Architecturally, it features wooden board-and-batten siding (now covered in
places with plywood panels), a side-gabled roof, and a central vent pipe near the roof ridge. The

entry door is located on the western (front) wall, and a more recent shed extension covered in
plywood and sheet metal has been added to the eastern (rear) wall. Functionally, this outbuilding
appears to have originally served as a detached wash house, though it was likely converted to
serve as a general storage building when the shed extension was added in the mid- to late
20th century. Based on the estimated date of construction (ca. 1920), this structure appears to
be the oldest surviving structure on the site.

Resource C—Equipment Shed (ca. 1940s)
Resource C, a metal storage shed, is located on the western margin of the yard area
associated with the current primary dwelling (Resource A) (Figures 6-7 and 6-8). This simple
storage shed is constructed of corrugated metal panels with a low-pitched shed roof and a former
entry centered on the southern façade. A fenced equipment yard extends off the northern side of
the shed. This structure appears to have been constructed in the 1940s, making it older than the
current primary dwelling (Resource A—ca. 1950 to 1970), though not quite as old as the small
wash house/shed (Resource B—ca. 1920).

Resource D—Shack (ca. 1985 to 1995)
Resource D is a rudimentary outbuilding in poor condition that was constructed in several
phases using a variety of construction materials located in the southwestern portion of the site
(Figures 6-9 and 6-10). The building’s core is a small plywood shed with a flat roof covered in
metal panels. A pole shed addition on the northern side is enclosed with metal screening,
suggesting it served as a poultry pen. However, a plywood shed added to the southern side has
windows and plumbing vent pipes, suggesting that the building may have served as a rudimentary
dwelling, possibly for farm workers. The structure is first visible at its current location on the 1995
aerial photograph, so a tentative construction date of ca. 1985 to 1995 has been assigned to this
structure, making this one of the most recently constructed buildings on the farm. It is also
possible that this structure is an older outbuilding that was moved to this location within this
timeframe from elsewhere on the farm.

Resource E—Pole Barn (ca. 1973 to 1985)
Resource E, an agricultural pole barn located along the main driveway in the southwestern
portion of the site, is situated to the west of the site’s current domestic area (Figure 6-11). It is
the largest of the site’s equipment storage barns, with four large bays opening to the east beneath
an asymmetrically pitched, side-gabled roof and storage shed additions on the southern end and
western (rear) walls Remnants of corrugated metal paneling cover the partially collapsed roof,
the western (rear) wall, and the northern and southern end walls. The design and construction of
the structure and aerial photographic evidence suggest a construction date in the late 20th century
(ca. 1973 to 1985).

Resource F—Wooden Pump House (ca. 1954 to 1964)
Resource F is a small, wooden pump house located along the main driveway in the westcentral portion of the site, northwest of the current domestic area (Figure 6-12). It is a simple

wood-frame structure with a side-gabled roof covered in corrugated metal panels and horizontal
wood siding. Plywood has been used to repair the southern (front) entry door and the eastern
and western side walls. Construction materials, the condition of the building, and aerial
photographic evidence place the construction date in the mid-20th century (ca. 1954 to 1964).

Resource G—Concrete Block Pump House (ca. 1987 to 1995)
Resource G is a small, concrete block pump house located along the main driveway in the
northern portion of the site, northwest of the current domestic area (Figure 6-13). It features a
concrete slab, a side-gabled roof, and a metal entry door on the western (front) wall. Based on
the construction materials and the comparatively good condition of the building, Resource G
appears to date from the late 20th century (ca. 1987 to 1995), which makes it one of the most
recently constructed standing architectural features on the site.

Ancillary Cultural Features
Site 41WM1379 also contains three concrete foundation features that presumably
represent the locations of former structures that are no longer present. Foundations 1 and 2 are
small, poured concrete slab foundations that may have supported small outbuildings (Figures 614 and 6-15). Foundation 1 measures approximately 4.0 meters (13.1 feet) square, and
Foundation 2 measures approximately 5.0 meters (16.4 feet) east to west by 2.0 meters (6.6 feet)
north to south. No structures are currently associated with either foundation. Both are overgrown,
with tree saplings growing within them or adjacent to them, and the slabs appear to have been
abandoned for some time. These foundations presumably supported former small farm
outbuildings that have either been moved from these locations or demolished.
Foundation 3 consists of a poured concrete staircase three courses high with an adjacent
poured concrete sidewalk that presumably marks the location of a former house that is no longer
present (Figures 6-16 and 6-17). A foundation slab is not present at this location, suggesting that
the structure that once stood here had a pier-and-beam foundation. This is believed to be the
former location of the large Folk Victorian farmhouse (Resource L) currently standing on site
41WM1381 to the northeast (see discussion below).
Associated ancillary features on the farmstead include a covered concrete well (Figure 618) and a water pump set within a decorative rubber tire border (Figure 6-19).
Observed Cultural Materials
Cultural materials observed on the modern ground surface of site 41WM1379 consist of
various pieces of domestic debris, including stoneware and whiteware ceramic sherds, pieces of
bottle glass of various colors (brown, green, and clear), and pieces of metal scrap. Observed
cultural materials are generally diagnostic of the 20th century. The bulk of the materials observed
on the site are modern, dating from the late 20th century to the present (the farm was occupied
and in use at the time of Horizon’s 2015-2016 survey).

Historical Research
Williamson County tax appraisal records indicate that site 41WM1379 is located within a
47.6-hectare (117.5-acre) tract (WCTAD Parcel No. R367590) that correlates with the Telander
farm (Table 6-1) (TDA 2017). The Telander brothers (Bertil, Clarence, and Arnold) purchased
this land as part of a larger 64.7-hectare (160.0-acre) tract in 1969 from Lula Miller, et al. (WCDR
517/556), which included all of Lot 8 and part of Lots 6 and 7 out of S.M. Swenson’s subdivision
of the P.A. Holder League (WCDR vol. 13, p. 119). Miller, et al. appear to be the heirs of Axel
Werner, who acquired the same 64.7 hectares (160.0 acres) with improvements from Adolph
Engstrand and his wife in 1904 (WCDR 106/589). The Engstroms had acquired the same
64.7 hectares (160.0 acres) with existing improvements from Barclay T. Bell, wife of James H.
Bell, in 1890 (WCDR 55/179). The dates of the Engstrom and Bell conveyances suggest that the
noted improvements may correlate with the large Folk Victorian farmhouse (Resource L) formerly
located on site 41WM1379, which has since been moved and is currently located on site
41WM1381.
The site 41WM1379 farmstead complex incudes a fair number of residential buildings,
agricultural structures, and remnant features that appear to represent multiple generations of
occupation and agricultural use by the Telander family and a series of unrelated predecessors.
The earliest evidence of built improvements on the farm appears to occur ca. 1890 during the
period of ownership by Adolph and C.A. Engstrand., though the improvements may have been

constructed previously between 1886 and 1890 by Barcley T. Bell. The only recorded building of
that age is the large Folk Victorian farmhouse (Resource L) currently located on site 41WM1381
to the northeast. Most of the surviving domestic buildings on site 41WM1379 appear to have
been built during the period of ownership by the Werner-Miller family between 1904 and 1969,

though a few of the ancillary structures on the site appear to have been constructed by the
Telander brothers in the post-1969 period.
One structure appears at the location of site 41WM1379 on the 1925 USGS topographic
map, the earliest historical image examined, which presumably represents the primary house at
that time (see Figure 4-2). This structure is depicted in the approximate location of Foundation 3,
which is believed to be the former location of the large Folk Victorian house (Resource L) that is
currently located on site 41WM1381 to the northeast. It is not until the 1982 USGS map that a
second structure, an outbuilding, is depicted on the site, though the farmstead is known to have
actively grown in the intervening years based on inspection of historical aerial photographs. On
the 1987 USGS map, numerous buildings are visible on the site.
Historical aerial photographs are more informative (NETR 2017). The earliest available
aerial photograph, dating to 1954, shows a large house with a complex pattern of roof gables and
shadows off the western side of the main driveway in the northern portion of the site at
approximately the location of Foundation 3. This is believed to be the former location of the large
Folk Victorian house (Resource L) currently standing on site 41WM1381 to the northeast. A
secondary house (Resource A) and one or two nearby outbuildings (possibly Resources B
and/or C) are dimly visible in the southeastern portion of the site on the 1954 aerial photograph.
In addition, at least two additional outbuildings are visible on the 1954 aerial photograph, neither
of which appear to be currently standing on the site.
Many of the currently extant structures on the site are clearly visible on the 1964 and 1973
aerial photographs, including the current primary dwelling (Resource A), the two outbuildings
located near the current main house (Resources B and C), the wooden pump house
(Resource F), an outbuilding at the location of Foundation 1, and one additional outbuilding north
of Resource C that does not correlate with any of the currently standing outbuildings or
foundations. The large primary house formerly located in the northern portion of the site was still
present at this time.
On the 1985 aerial photograph, all of the structures on the 1964 and 1973 aerial
photographs remain visible, and the pole barn (Resource E) is now visible as well. Notably, the
1985 aerial photograph is the last image on which the former primary dwelling on the site, a large
house at the location of Foundation 3, is visible. At that time, no structures were yet present at
the location of site 41WM1381 to the northeast of site 41WM1379; that area was characterized
by an agricultural field. By 1995, the next aerial photograph in the sequence, the large house at
the location of Foundation 3 was no longer present on site 41WM1379, but a structure with a
similar complex roof pattern appeared at the location of site 41WM1381 to the northeast. As
such, the aerial photographic evidence strongly suggests that the large Folk Victorian house
(Resource L) currently standing on site 41WM1381 was formerly the primary residence on site
41WM1379. Steve Pine, the Director of Development for Kalahari Resorts, confirmed this
inference in a discussion with Jeffrey D. Owens, the author of this report, stating that the large
Folk Victorian house (Resource L) on site 41WM1381 had been moved to that location from
“somewhere farther south on the property” (personal communication 2017).

HJN 170158 AR

Chapter 6.0: Results of Investigations

The farmstead remained largely unchanged following 1985, with the only notable addition
being the addition of the small shack or agricultural building (Resource D) between 1985 and
1995, though it is also possible that this is an older outbuilding that was moved to its current
location from elsewhere on the farm. The concrete block pump house (Resource G) also first
appears on the 1995 map. One or more outbuildings in the southeastern portion of the site appear
to have been removed by this time as well, though these former structure locations do not
correlate with any extant remains on the site.
Site 41WM1379 and site 41WM1380 to the east are interrelated and date from their late
19th-century origins as components of S.M. Swenson’s subdivided farm tracts along Brushy
Creek. The original farm building on site 41WM1379, a large Folk Victorian house (Resource L)
that was subsequently moved to site 41WM1381 to the northeast, was probably constructed by
Barclay Bell between 1886 and 1890, or possibly by the Engstrands between 1890 and 1904.
The farm continued to grow through the 20th century. After the Werner-Miller farm was acquired
by the Telander brothers in 1969, it appears the large Folk Victorian house was moved to site
41WM1381 to the northeast and set aside as the life estate of Mrs. Arnold Telander and her
daughter, Grace Telander (see discussion of site 41WM1381 below).
Summary and Recommendations
Overall, the extant structures on site 41WM1379 are in poor to fair condition, none are
constructed in a particularly unique or distinct architectural style or design and do not convey
architecturally or stylistically significant features. Furthermore, many of the structures have been
modified from their original form. The structures do not embody distinctive characteristics of a
type, period, or method of construction; do not represent the work of a master architect; and do
not possess high artistic values. Therefore, the property is not significant based on architectural
merits. Most of the resources do appear to be in their original locations (with the exception of the
original Folk Victorian House [Resource L], which has been moved to site 41WM1381 to the
northeast). Furthermore, site 41WM1379 retains a substantial number and variety of domestic
and agricultural improvements and remained in used at the time of Horizon’s 2015-2016 cultural
resources survey, though the site has since been abandoned. However, the apparent removal
and relocation of the large Folk Victorian farmhouse (Resource L) has diminished the site’s
historical integrity as well as its ability to convey historical associations and patterns of agricultural
development within this farm and within S.M. Swenson’s larger plan for Swedish agricultural
development of the Palm Valley community. As a result of these considerations, site 41WM1379
is recommended as ineligible for designation as an SAL.

6.2

SITE 41WM1380 (JOHNSON-KELLER FARM)
General Description

Site 41WM1380 consists of the remains of an early to late 20th-century farmstead located
in the north-central portion of the project area approximately 170.0 meters (557.6 feet) east of site
41WM1379 (Figure 6-20; also see Figure 6-1). The farm is accessed from US 79 to the north via
a private gravel driveway that continues westwards and eastwards to provide access to other
nearby farmsteads. The 1925 USGS topographic map shows a single building standing on site

Chapter 6.0: Results of Investigations

41WM1380, presumably the primary residence at that time (see Figure 4-2). The farm continued
to grow through the 20th century, though it never reached the size of its neighbor to the west (site
41WM1379). The farmstead was moderately overgrown at the time of Horizon’s 2015-2016
survey and appeared to have been abandoned for some time. Currently, standing structures on
the farm consist of two single-story, wood-frame farm houses (Structures H and K); an enclosed,
poured-concrete structure with an adjacent windmill that probably served as a water-storage
feature (Structure I); and an open-side equipment shed (Structure J). A gravel driveway enters
the site from the northwest. Vegetation on the site at the time of the survey consisted of ankleto knee-high grasses and scattered oak trees, and the farm is surrounded by agricultural fields.
The site is situated on a relatively flat paleoterrace landform at an elevation of approximately
202.1 meters (663.0 feet) amsl. US 79 is located roughly 320.0 meters (1,049.6 feet) north of the
site, and Brushy Creek is located approximately 790.0 meters (2,591.2 feet) south of the site. A
private access road formerly passed north to south along the western margin of the site that
continued southward to a ford across Brushy Creek (see Figures 1-1 and 4-2), though this feature
is now overgrown and is no longer passable.
Horizontal and Vertical Extents of Cultural Materials
Based on the extent of cultural features and associated debris, site 41WM1380 measures
approximately 100.0 meters (328.0 feet) in diameter.
Cultural materials on site 41WM1380 appear to be constrained largely or entirely to the
modern ground surface. While only one shovel test was excavated within the site boundaries,
shovel tests excavated in the surrounding area revealed no evidence of archeological deposits.
Observed Cultural Features

Resource H—House (ca. ca. 1920)
Resource H is one of two unstyled, one-story farm dwellings on site 41WM1380 (Figure 621 to 6-23). Resource H is located just north of its neighbor, Resource K, adjacent to the driveway
that formerly provided access to the site. This dwelling appears to date from the Johnson’s
original acquisition of the property in 1919 and probably correlates with a building depicted at this
location on the 1925 USGS topographic quadrangle (see Figure 4-2). It is rectangular in plan and
is of wood-frame construction with a veneer addition of concrete blocks parged with stucco
coating on its exterior walls. The roof appears to be non-original, is covered with asphalt
composition shingles, and features a brick flue located centrally near the roof ridge. The floor is
raised on low piers over a shallow crawl space. The northern (front) wall, currently enclosed with
concrete blocks and fitted with a wooden doorway and flanking metal sash windows, appears
once to have had a central porch, though the porch has been removed. A screened-in porch of
wooden construction extends across the southern (rear) façade of the dwelling. A few one-overone wooden sash window units survive, especially on the rear porch, though most windows and
doors have been replaced with manufactured units of smaller dimensions. Small casement
windows have been fitted beneath the eastern and western gable ends, possibly to replace
original gable-end vents for the attic space.

Resource I—Concrete Cistern and Windmill (pre-1954)
Resource I is a large, concrete storage tank set on grade located east of the two farm
dwellings (Resources H and K) and just north of an equipment barn (Resource J) (Figure 6-24).
This agricultural structure is approximately 3.0 meters (10.0 feet) square in plan and
approximately 1.5 meters (5.0 feet) tall. It is constructed entirely of poured concrete. Its proximity
to an adjacent metal lattice windmill (Figure 6-25) suggests that it functioned as an above-ground
water storage tank or cistern related to domestic and agricultural needs at the farm. Remnants
of an elevated water tank of wooden construction with metal hoops are also located in close
proximity to the concrete water tank. While the construction materials and techniques are not
temporally distinctive, aerial photographic evidence indicates that this structure was present on
the site by 1954.
Resource J—Pole Barn (pre-1954)
Resource J is a rectangular, three-bay equipment shed of pole barn construction located
east of the two farm dwellings on site 41WM1380 (Figures 6-26 and 6-27). It is side-gabled, clad
with corrugated metal panels, and includes a shed addition, also clad in corrugated metal, across
its eastern (rear) wall. Aerial photographic evidence indicates that the pole barn was present on
the site by 1954.

Resource K—House (ca. 1940s)
Resource K is one of two unstyled, single-story farm dwellings on site 41WM1380
(Figure 6-28 to 6-30). Resource K is located just south of its somewhat older neighbor,
Resource H, adjacent to the driveway that formerly provided access to the farm. This house
appears to be a secondary farm dwelling that dates from the 1940s and probably correlates with
a building depicted at this location that appears on the 1949 USGS topographic map (see
Figure 4-3). It is rectangular in plan and is of wood-frame construction with some areas of
horizontal wood siding and a veneer addition of concrete blocks parged with stucco coating that
probably dates from the 1950s. The roof is gabled with gable-end vents and covers an integrated
porch set into the building’s southwestern corner. Notably, the corner porch support posts are of
reinforced-concrete construction. The roof is covered with original metal panels and features
exposed rafter tails and a brick flue located centrally near the roof ridge. The gabled ends are
vented. Windows are single one-over-one wood sashes positioned irregularly along the northern
(front) and southern (rear) walls. Remnants of a screened-in porch extend across the eastern
façade of the building.
Observed Cultural Materials
Cultural materials observed on the modern ground surface of site 41WM1380 consist of
various pieces of domestic debris, including stoneware and whiteware ceramic sherds, pieces of
bottle glass of various colors (brown, green, and clear), and pieces of metal scrap. Observed

cultural materials are generally diagnostic of the 20th century. Modern materials, including a
plastic lawn chair, aluminum cans, and other plastic objects, were also observed.
Historical Research
Williamson County tax appraisal records indicate that site 41WM1380 is located within a 0.4hectare (1.0-acre) parcel (WCTAD Parcel No. R051819) that is part of a larger 24.5-hectare (60.6acre) tract (Table 6-2) (WCTAD Parcel No. R055809) (Table 6-2). Together, these two tracts
were known as the 24.5-hectare (60.6-acre) Johnson and Keller tract. Two farmstead residences
and several outbuildings appear to have been developed by John N. Johnson, who acquired the
land without improvements from C.H. Gilberg and his wife in 1919 (WCDR v. 189, pp. 132-133).
The Gilbergs had acquired the property without improvements three years earlier in 1916 (WCDR
v. 179, p. 451) from the heirs of Swen Larson, who acquired the same unimproved tract in 1874
as Lot 9 of S.M. Swenson’s original subdivision of the P.A. Holder Survey (Abstract 211).
Sites 41WM1380 and site 41WM1379 to the west are interrelated and date from their late
19th-century origins as components of S.M. Swenson’s subdivided farm tracts along Brushy
Creek. One structure appears at the location of site 41WM1380 on the 1925 USGS topographic
map, the earliest historical image examined, which presumably represents the primary house at
that time (Resource H) (see Figure 4-2). A second structure appears alongside the original
structure on the 1949 USGS topographic map (see Figure 4-3). The earliest aerial photograph
examined dates to 1954 and depicts both primary structures as well as numerous outbuildings.

Chapter 6.0: Results of Investigations

While only two outbuildings (Resources I and J) currently remain on the site, four or more
distinct outbuildings are visible on the 1954 aerial photograph. It is unclear when the farm was
abandoned. Aerial photographs suggest the farm was maintained in good condition until at least
1985 or 1995, though subsequent aerial photographs show that vegetation may have begun to
overtake the site by 2004.
Summary and Recommendations
Overall, the extant structures on site 41WM1380 are in poor condition, none are
constructed in a particularly unique or distinct architectural style or design and do not convey
architecturally or stylistically significant features. Furthermore, many of the structures have been
modified from their original form. The structures do not embody distinctive characteristics of a
type, period, or method of construction; do not represent the work of a master architect; and do
not possess high artistic values. Therefore, the property is not significant based on architectural
merits. Most of the resources do appear to be in their original locations, and the site retains
several domestic and agricultural improvements. However, the poor condition of the resources
diminishes the site’s historical integrity as well as its ability to convey historical associations and
patterns of agricultural development within this farm and within S.M. Swenson’s larger plan for
Swedish agricultural development of the Palm Valley community. As a result of these
considerations, site 41WM1380 is recommended as ineligible for designation as an SAL.

SITE 41WM1381 (TELANDER LIFE ESTATE)
General Description

Site 41WM1381 consists of a late 20th-century farmstead that was established as a life
estate for Mrs. Alfred Telander and her daughter, Grace Telander, by her three sons—Bertil,
Clarence, and Arnold—who owned and operated the surrounding parcel as a farm following their
purchase of the property in 1969. Currently, the only historic-age standing structure on the farm
is a large Folk Victorian house (Resource L). While this house was originally built in ca. 1900, it
was moved to its current location after 1985 from its original location on site 41WM1379, the main
Bell-Telander farmstead, to the southwest. Other structures on the site are non-historic buildings
of recent (post-1985) construction, including a garage/workshop, a concrete-block well house,
and a gazebo (Figure 6-31; also see Figure 6-1). Vegetation on the site consists of mowed
grasses and young oak trees. The site is situated on a relatively flat paleoterrace landform at an
elevation of approximately 202.7 meters (665.0 feet) amsl. A private gravel driveway provides
access to the site from US 79 from both the east and west, passing east to west along the northern
margin of the site.
Horizontal and Vertical Extents of Cultural Materials
Based on the extent of cultural features and associated landscaping, site 41WM1381
measures approximately 90.0 meters (295.2 feet) in diameter.

Chapter 6.0: Results of Investigations

As site 41WM1381 was established after 1985, no cultural materials of historic-age are
present on the site; consequently, no shovel tests were excavated on the site. Shovel tests
excavated in the surrounding agricultural fields revealed no evidence of subsurface archeological
deposits.
Observed Cultural Features

Resource L—House (ca. 1900)
Resource L represents of the only historic-age resource on site 41WM1381. This dwelling
is a large, two-story Folk Victorian-style farmhouse, originally built in ca. 1900, that was relocated
to this site between 1985 and 1995 (Figure 6-32). The house features an irregular floor plan, a
wrap-around porch, and a combination of hipped and gabled roof sections, all of which represent
typical design features of Folk Victorian houses built in America’s post-railroad era. While the
building retains its historical form, fenestration, and some decorative details (e.g., classical porch
columns and shingle siding on the front gable), the building’s exterior has been extensively
renovated in recent years with metal roofing, synthetic siding, and metal replacement windows.

Ancillary Features
The only other structures on site 41WM1381 are non-historic buildings constructed after
1985, including a garage/workshop, a concrete-block well house, and a gazebo.

Observed Cultural Materials
No cultural materials of historic age were observed on site 41WM1381.
Historical Research
Williamson County tax appraisal records indicate that site 41WM1381 is located within a
0.6-hectare (1.5-acre) parcel currently associated with Bertil Telander (Table 6-3) (WCAD Parcel
R305858). This parcel correlates with a 0.2-hectare (0.5-acre) tract that was set aside by the
Telander brothers (Bertil, Clarence, and Arnold) in 1977 as a life estate to be occupied by their
mother, Mrs. Alfred Telander, and their sister, Grace Telander (WCDR 668, p. 650). A
subsequent 1986 affidavit (WCDR Vol. 1419, page 419) clarifies that the house and the 30.5-by30.5-meter (100.0-by 100-foot) life estate tract is not a part of the surrounding 65.0-hectare
(160.7-acre) tract that the Telander Brothers acquired in 1969 from Lula Miller, et al. (see Table 61; also see discussion of site 41WM1379 above). The 1986 affidavit notes instead that the life
estate occupied by Mrs, Alfred Telander and her daughter, Gracie, was part of a 48.6-hectare
(120.0-acre) tract owned separately by Clarence and Arnold Telander. While no record was
located that specifically confirms the location of the separate 48.6-hectare (120.0-acre) tract
WCDR vol. 849, page 807, describes an earlier exchange of property farther east in the P.A.
Holder League between Bertil Telander and his brothers Arnold and Clarence. It is possible that
the 48.6 hectares (120.0 acres) described in the 1986 affidavit are part of the Telander brothers’
additional acreage in Lots 10 and 11 of the S.M. Swenson survey.
Historical USGS topographic maps and aerial photographs indicate that site 41WM1381
consisted of nothing but an active agricultural field until at least 1985 (NETR 2017). The earliest

Chapter 6.0: Results of Investigations

available aerial photograph of the area, dating to 1954, shows a large house with a complex
pattern of roof gables and shadows off the western side of the main driveway in the northern
portion of site 41WM1379, the main Bell-Telander farmstead, to the southwest. This is believed
to be the former location of the large Folk Victorian house (Resource L) currently standing on site
41WM1381. The house remained at its former location until at least 1985. By 1995, the house
had been moved from its former location to its current location, and the small life estate farmstead
designated as 41WM1381 had been established. Steve Pine, the Director of Development for
Kalahari Resorts, confirmed this inference in a discussion with Jeffrey D. Owens, the author of
this report, stating that the large Folk Victorian house (Resource L) on site 41WM1381 had been
moved to that location from “somewhere farther south on the property” (personal communication
2017).
Summary and Recommendations
Site 41WM1381 consists of a late 20th-century farmstead complex that features a ca.
1900 Folk Victorian dwelling (Resource L) that has been moved to its current location and
extensively renovated in recent decades. The main Bell-Telander farmstead, 41WM1379, is
located approximately 200.0 meters (656.0 feet) to the southwest, and the location of site
41WM1381 coincides with the 0.2-hectare (0.5-acre) life estate established for the matron of the
Telander family, Mrs. Alfred Telander, and her daughter, Gracie. The farmstead on site
41WM1381 was not established until sometime between 1985 and 1995; as such, site 41WM1381
as a whole is a late 20th- to early 21st-century occupation and is not of historic age. The
associated outbuildings all date from the late 20th century and have no relation to the building’s
prior history and association with the main Bell-Telander farmstead to the southwest. Originally
built in ca. 1900, the house (Resource L) was the primary dwelling on the Bell-Telander Farm (site
41WM1379) since its inception until it was moved to its current location on site 41WM1381
between 1985 and 1995. Though the building generally retains the form and character of
vernacular Victorian-era farmhouses that were once quite common across rural Williamson
County, the relocation of the building from its original site has compromised its integrity of setting,
and the alterations that have been made to the building have greatly diminished its historical and
architectural integrity. As a result of these considerations, site 41WM1381 is recommended as
ineligible for designation as an SAL.

6.4

SITE 41WM12
General Description

Site 41WM12 was originally inspected in 1958 by archeologists E.B. Jelks and E.M. Davis,
but it was only officially recorded in 1960 as the Palm Valley Site. At that time, the site was
described as a surface scatter of aboriginal lithic artifacts in a plowed field, including projectile
points, knife fragments, a burin, and numerous lithic cores and flakes. Temporally diagnostic
artifacts observed included a Fresno or Young arrow point and a Bulverde dart point, suggesting
prehistoric occupations ranging from the Late Archaic through Late Prehistoric periods. According
to the original site recorder, a Folsom dart point had been reported as being found on this site by
a Mr. Rydell of Hutto, which would suggest a Late PaleoIndian component as well.

While the site initially appeared to hold some promise, site 41WM12 has been
reinvestigated by professional archeologists at least three times subsequent to its original
recording in connection with various cultural resources management projects. C.J. Jurgens
examined the portion of the site that fell within the proposed right-of-way (ROW) of a sewer line
in 1981, and Espey, Huston & Associates surveyed the proposed ROW of another sewer line
through the site in 1986. Most recently, SWCA Environmental Consultants investigated the
portion of the site located within the proposed ROW of Arterial A (now known as Kenney Fort
Boulevard) in 2007 (Lawrence 2007). On all three occasions, the site was described as consisting
of a sparse scatter of prehistoric artifacts in disturbed, largely surficial contexts. No temporally
diagnostic artifacts have been found on the site since the initial recording, and no cultural features
have ever been observed on the site. Site 41WM12 was recommended as ineligible for listing on
the NRHP during all three recorded site visits by professional archeologists.
Horizon reinvestigated the portion of site 41WM12 that falls within the boundaries of the
current project area. Horizon’s observations were consistent with previous studies conducted on
the site. The aboriginal component of site 41WM12 consists of a sparse, surficial scatter of
aboriginal lithic artifacts, including cores, flakes, and a crude biface in a plowed agricultural field
on a paleoterrace north of Brushy Creek (Figure 6-33; also see Figure 6-1). The site is located
within an active agricultural field that had not yet been planted for the season, and very little
vegetation was present within the investigated site boundaries at the time of the survey (Figure 634). Elevations on the site range from approximately 201. 8 to 204.6 meters (662.0 to 672.0 feet)
amsl, sloping down gradually to the south toward Brushy Creek.
In addition to the aboriginal component, Horizon documented a minor historic-age
component on site 41WM12 during the 2015-2016 survey. Horizon initially recorded the historicage component as a separate archeological site, but TARL requested that the historic-age
component be incorporated within the existing site 41WM12 as the historic-age component has
substantial spatial overlap with the previously documented boundaries of the site.
The historic-age component of site 41WM12 consists of a localized moderate- to highdensity scatter of 20th-century domestic debris in a plowed field (Figures 6-35 and 6-36). The
scatter is located along the southeastern edge of the agricultural field adjacent to an elevated,
linear berm that represents the right-of-way of a former private road that provided access from
US 79 to the north to a low-water ford across Brushy Creek to the south (Figure 6-37). This
roadway appears to have been abandoned by the 1960s or 1970s in favor of an at-grade field
road that runs along the western margin of the linear embankment. At some point following the
abandonment of the linear embankment as a road, a linear agricultural feature was constructed
along the spine of the embankment. This feature consists of various materials arranged in linear
alignments, including concrete slabs, a metal trough, and metal piping.
Horizontal and Vertical Extents of Cultural Materials
Based on the extent of aboriginal cultural debris observed on the modern ground surface,
the prehistoric component of site 41WM12 extends approximately 800.0 meters (2,624.0 feet)
northeast to southwest by 140.0 meters (459.2 feet) northwest to southeast within the south-

eastern portion of the project area. The previously delineated site boundaries extend farther
westward beyond the boundaries of the current project area.
The highly localized scatter of historic-age cultural materials on the modern ground
surface of site 41WM12 measures approximately 30.0 meters (98.4 feet) in diameter. The scatter
of negative shovel tests depicted on Figure 6-35 represents the location of the historic-age artifact
scatter. The linear agricultural feature constructed atop the earthen embankment measures
approximately 240.0 meters (787.2 feet) by a maximum of 20.0 meters (65.6 feet) in width (though
in truth the linear feature atop the berm measures only a few feet in width).
Cultural materials on site 41WM12 are constrained to the modern ground surface. None
of the 20 shovel tests excavated within the site boundaries revealed any subsurface archeological
deposits, though it is likely that some cultural materials have been incorporated into the shallow
plowzone that characterizes the majority of the investigated area of the site.
Observed Cultural Features
No prehistoric cultural features or other cultural materials suggestive of cultural features,
such as burned rocks, were observed on site 41WM12. Similarly, no historic-age cultural features
are directly associated with the localized scatter of 20th-century domestic debris located on the
site.

Chapter 6.0: Results of Investigations

The sole cultural feature observed on site 41WM12 consists of a linear feature erected
along the ridge of a prominent, linear earthen embankment that formerly served as an elevated
roadway, providing access from US 79 to the north across the nearby agricultural fields to a lowwater crossing on Brushy Creek to the south. Currently, this feature consists of various materials
arranged in linear alignments, including concrete slabs, a metal trough, and metal piping. The
majority of the feature consists of fragments of flat, broken concrete slabs set vertically into the
ground in two parallel rows set approximately 1.0 meter (3.3 feet) apart (Figures 6-38 to 6-40).
This segment of the feature measures approximately 100.0 meters (328.0 feet) in length north to
south and comprises more than half of the length of the feature. Extending from the southern end
of the parallel alignments of concrete slab fragments is an aluminum trough that extends for
approximately 40.0 meters (131.2 feet) along the top of the earthen embankment (Figure 6-41).
A metal pipe extends from the southern end of the aluminum trough and runs the rest of the length
of the earthen embankment. The metal pipe is visible on the modern ground surface in some
areas, though not in others, eventually emanating from the southern end of the berm and
continuing down into the ground near the Brushy Creek channel (Figures 6-42 to 6-43). The rows
of vertically inset concrete slabs presumably served to brace some kind of trough that is no longer
present; however, the aluminum trough segment of the feature is not braced by external supports.
While the function of the feature is not entirely clear, it would appear to be associated with the
historical agricultural use of the surrounding fields.
Observed Cultural Materials
Aboriginal cultural materials observed on site 41WM12 consist of a sparse, surficial scatter
of aboriginal lithic artifacts, including cores, flakes, and a crude biface (Figure 6-44). No
temporally diagnostic prehistoric artifacts or floral or faunal remains were observed on the site.
Historic-age cultural materials observed on site 41WM12 consist of a variety of highly
fragmented historic-age domestic debris, including whiteware ceramic sherds; shards of clear,
amber, and milk glass; a metal nail; and a ceramic insulator (Figure 6-45).
The agricultural feature that runs along the crest of the earthen embankment is composed
chunks of flat concrete slabs, a metal water trough, and metal piping. No other cultural materials
were observed in association with this feature.
Historical Research
Examination of historical USGS topographic quadrangles and aerial photographs indicate
that a single historic-age structure was once present at the location of the scatter of historic-age
domestic debris observed on site 41WM12. This structure is visible on the 1925 USGS
topographic map (see Figure 4-2) and on an aerial photograph dating to 1954 (NETR 2017), which
represents the earliest aerial image examined. The structure is not present on the next aerial
photograph in the sequence dating to 1964; as such, it would appear that this structure was moved
or demolished between 1954 and 1964. The structure would have been located off the western
side of a private access road that crossed the surrounding agricultural fields, providing access
from US 79 to the north to a low-water crossing of Brushy Creek to the south.

The scatter of historic-age domestic debris on site 41WM12 is located on the same parcel
as the Bell-Telander farm, herein designated as site 41WM1379 (see discussion above). The full
history of property ownership for this parcel is discussed above in connection with site
41WM1379, the main Bell-Telander farmstead. As the former structure on site 41WM12 had been
removed prior to 1964, it would not have been associated with the Telander family as the property
was not purchased by the Telander brothers until 1969. Rather, the structure probably would
have been extant during the tenure of the Bell (ca. 1886 to 1890), Engstrand (ca. 1890 to 1904),
and/or Werner (ca. 1904 to 1952) families on the property. It is not entirely clear based on the
blurry 1954 aerial photograph what the function of the structure may have been. It may have
been an agricultural outbuilding associated with the early to mid-20th-century farm on this
property, or it may have served as a small dwelling for farmhands or seasonal workers.
The 1925 USGS topographic map depicts a north-to-south-oriented roadway that
traversed the agricultural fields that characterize the project area, running from US 79 to the north
to a low-water crossing on Brushy Creek to the south. This roadway ran along the property line
between the Bell-Telander tract to the west (associated with site 41WM1379) and the JohnsonKeller tract to the east (41WM1380) (see discussions of these sites above) (see Figure 4-2). This
roadway is clearly visible on historical aerial photographs dating to 1954 and 1964, and it would
appear the roadway and low-water crossing on Brushy Creek remained in use through the mid20th century. The low-water crossing is still visible on modern USGS topographic maps (see
Figure 1-1) and remains clearly visible on historical aerial photographs at least until 1985. After
1985, the low-water crossing itself appears to have become increasingly overgrown, and it is not
clear whether or not it continued to be used. The north-to-south-oriented field road continues to
be in use, though it now diverges to the west, providing access to a former quarry area. However,
between 1964 and 1973, the field road appears to have been shifted slightly to the west of its
original position and now runs along the western margin of the elevated earthen embankment
that represents the original alignment of the roadway. As such, it would appear that the
agricultural feature constructed along the crest of the former roadway embankment would postdate 1964, when the roadway shifted to the west. It is likely that the feature is associated with
the Telander tenure on the tract to the west (the Telander brothers purchased that tract in 1969)
(see Table 6-1) and/or the Johnson-Keller tenure on the tract to the east (see Table 6-2). While
it is possible the feature was constructed slightly earlier, most of the improvements on the adjacent
farmsteads date to the mid- to late 20th-century timeframe, which suggests a mid- to late 20thcentury date of construction for the feature on site 41WM12 by association.
Summary and Recommendations
The aboriginal component of site 41WM12 consists of a low-density, surficial scatter of
aboriginal lithic artifacts in a plowed field on a paleoterrace overlooking Brushy Creek to the south.
No temporally diagnostic artifacts, preserved floral or faunal remains, or evidence of cultural
features were observed on the site, and the aboriginal occupation of the site can only be dated to
an undetermined prehistoric timeframe. Cultural materials are constrained to the modern ground
surface (and possibly within the shallow plowzone). The aboriginal archeological deposits have
been disturbed via decades of seasonal plowing and crop harvesting cycles. The site lacks
integrity and possesses minimal potential to contribute to an understanding of the prehistoric past.

HJN 170158 AR

75

Chapter 6.0: Results of Investigations

As such, the portion of the aboriginal component of site 41WM12 that falls within the boundaries
of the current project area is recommended as noncontributing to the overall eligibility of the
aboriginal component of site for designation as an SAL, and no further investigations are
warranted in connection with the proposed undertaking.
Site 41WM12 also contains a highly localized, moderate- to high-density scatter of 20thcentury domestic debris in a plowed field on a paleoterrace north of Brushy Creek. Historical
USGS topographic maps and aerial photographs indicate that there was a single structure at the
location of the scatter from at least 1925 to approximately 1954, but the structure had been
removed by 1964. Currently, this area consists only of a surficial scatter of historic-age domestic
artifacts, including ceramic sherds, glass shards, and metal debris, in a plowed field, but the site
may once have contained an agricultural outbuilding associated with the Bell, Engstrand, and/or
Werner farms, and/or the structure may have served as a dwelling for farm workers. While the
scatter is associated with early 20th-century farming practices and the early Swedish settlement
of the area, the lack of any extant architectural or cultural features or intact archeological deposits
severely diminishes the significance of the site. As a result of these considerations, this portion
of the historic-age component on site 41WM12 is recommended as ineligible for designation as
an SAL.
Finally, site 41WM12 also contains a single historic-age cultural feature—the remnants of
a linear feature with a presumably agricultural function constructed on top of a linear, elevated
embankment that runs from north to south along the property boundary between the Bell-Telander
tract to the west (associated with site 41WM1379) and the Johnson-Keller tract to the east
(associated with site 41WM1381). The feature has been constructed on the crest of a former
roadway berm that appears to have fallen into disuse sometime after 1964, which suggests the
feature was associated with the post-1969 tenure of the Telander brothers on site 41WM1379 to
the west and/or the latter portion of the post-1919 tenure of the Keller-Johnson families on site
41WM1380 to the east. As most of the currently standing buildings on the adjacent farmsteads
date to the mid- to late 20th century, the agricultural feature on site 41WM12 is assumed to date
to this timeframe by association.
The feature is composed of parallel, linear alignments of broken concrete slab fragments
vertically inset into the ground, presumably to brace a water tray or trough between them; a
segment of semi-cylindrical aluminum trough or tray; and a metal pipe that runs all the way south
into the ground on the floodplain adjacent to Brushy Creek. It is possible that a water pump
formerly may have been present at the southern end of the feature to pump water up onto the
linear embankment for distribution to neighboring fields, though no evidence of a pump was
observed on the site, and the exact function of the feature is not entirely clear. While the feature
is presumably associated with the historically agricultural use of the surrounding fields and is
therefore indicative of the broadly agricultural land use of the project area, the feature is not itself
architecturally or archeologically significant. As a result of these considerations, the historic-age
agricultural feature on site 41WM12 is recommended as ineligible for designation as an SAL.

7.0 SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS

7.1

CONCEPTUAL FRAMEWORK

The archeological investigations documented in this report were undertaken with three
primary management goals in mind:



Locate all historic and prehistoric archeological resources that occur within the
designated survey area.



Evaluate the significance of these resources regarding their potential for designation
as SALs.



Formulate recommendations for the treatment of these resources based on their SAL
evaluations.

At the survey level of investigation, the principal research objective is to inventory the
cultural resources within the project area and to make preliminary determinations of whether or
not the resources meet one or more of the pre-defined eligibility criteria set forth in the state and/or
federal codes, as appropriate. Usually, management decisions regarding archeological
properties are a function of the potential importance of the sites in addressing defined research
needs, though historic-age sites may also be evaluated in terms of their association with important
historic events and/or personages. Under the Antiquities Code of Texas, archeological resources
are evaluated according to criteria established to determine the significance of archeological
resources for designation as SALs.
Analyses of the limited data obtained at the survey level are rarely sufficient to contribute
in a meaningful manner to defined research issues. The objective is rather to determine which
archeological sites could be most profitably investigated further in pursuance of regional,
methodological, or theoretical research questions. Therefore, adequate information on site
function, context, and chronological placement from archeological and, if appropriate, historical
perspectives is essential for archeological evaluations. Because research questions vary as a
function of geography and temporal period, determination of the site context and chronological
placement of cultural properties is a particularly important objective during the inventory process.

ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA FOR LISTING AS A STATE ANTIQUITIES LANDMARK

The criteria for determining the eligibility of a prehistoric or historic cultural property for
designation as an SAL are presented in Chapter 191, Subchapter D, Section 191.092 of the
Antiquities Code of Texas, which states that SALs include:
Sites, objects, buildings, artifacts, implements, and locations of historical, archeological,
scientific, or educational interest including those pertaining to prehistoric and historical
American Indians or aboriginal campsites, dwellings, and habitation sites, their artifacts
and implements of culture, as well as archeological sites of every character that are located
in, on, or under the surface of any land belonging to the State of Texas or to any county,
city, or political subdivision of the state are state antiquities landmarks and are eligible for
designation.

For the purposes of assessing the eligibility of a historic property for designation as an
SAL, a historic site, structure, or building has historical interest if the site, structure, or building:
1. [W]as the site of an event that has significance in the history of the United States or
the State of Texas;
2. [W]as significantly associated with the life of a famous person;
3. [W]as significantly associated with an event that symbolizes an important principle or
ideal;
4. [R]epresents a distinctive architectural type and has value as an example of a period,
style, or construction technique; or,
5. [I]s important as part of the heritage of a religious organization, ethic group, or local
society.

The Antiquities Code of Texas establishes the THC as the legal custodian of all cultural
resources, historic and prehistoric, within the public domain of the State of Texas. Under Part II
of Title 13 of the Texas Administrative Code (13 TAC 26), the THC may designate a historic
building, structure, cultural landscape, or non-archeological site, object, or district as an SAL if it
meets at least on one of following criteria:
A. [T]he property is associated with events that have made a significant contribution to
the broad patterns of our history, including importance to a particular cultural or ethnic
group;
B. [T]he property is associated with the lives of persons significant in our past;
C. [T]he property embodies the distinctive characteristics of a type, period, or method of
construction, represents the work of a master, possesses high artistic values, or
represents a significant and distinguishable entity whose components may lack
individual distinction;
D. [T]he property has yielded, or may be likely to yield, information important in Texas
culture or history.

Furthermore, the THC may designate an archeological site as an SAL if the site meets
one or more of the following criteria:
1. [T]he site has the potential to contribute to a better understanding of the prehistory
and/or history of Texas by the addition of new and important information;
2. [T]he site’s archeological deposits and the artifacts within the site are preserved and
intact, thereby supporting the research potential or preservation interests of the site;
3. [T]he site possesses unique or rare attributes concerning Texas prehistory and/or
history;
4. [T]he study of the site offers the opportunity to test theories and methods of
preservation, thereby contributing to new scientific knowledge; or,
5. [T]he high likelihood that vandalism and relic collecting has occurred or could occur,
and official landmark designation is needed to ensure maximum legal protection, or
alternatively further investigations are needed to mitigate the effects of vandalism and
relic collecting when the site cannot be protected.

HISTORIC CONTEXT FOR AGRICULTURAL FARMSTEADS WITHIN PROJECT AREA

The project area is located in Palm Valley, one of Central Texas’s earliest Swedish
settlements. The community was named for Anna Palm, who arrived in 1853 along with a group
of Swedish immigrants and was a pioneer of the community, then called "Brushy." The community
developed around the Palm Valley Lutheran Church, which also served as the community’s first
school. The Palm Valley Lutheran Congregation was formally organized on November 27, 1870,
and continues to worship today within its Gothic Revival style church, the Palm Valley Lutheran
Church, which was erected in 1894 (this church is a Recorded Texas Historic Landmark). The
following summary of Palm Valley’s history, several of its most prominent settlers, and its
development into the 20th century is drawn from Severin (1994:299-300).
The beautiful Palm Valley, intersected by the Brushy Creek, has gotten its name from one
of the oldest pioneers, the Palm family which settled here in the fifties. Palm Valley next
to Austin is the oldest Swedish community in Texas. The first Swede who settled in the
area was S.M. Swenson’s sister, Mrs. Dyer and her husband, by Kinney’s Fort, south of
the creek where they moved from Swenson’s plantation in Fort Bend County in 1852. The
second Swede who settled here was Johannes Palm with his mother, Mrs. Anders Palm,
and the brothers Andrew, William and Henry, in 1853. The place where they first settled
was later sold to Mr. Caldwell, and has been known since then as the Caldwell Place,
located north of the Brushy Creek. It was to this place that many of the first immigrants
came and where they worked to pay for their passage. This property, which was first
bought by the oldest son of the Palm family, is now owned by the youngest son, William
Palm. The following year, 1854, Arvid Nelson, the forefather of the well-known and wealthy
Nelson family, came from Sweden with his family. With this family the foundation was laid
for the largest Swedish community in Texas. Among other Swedes who arrived in the 50’s,
were the Larsons, the Christersons, the Andersons, the John Johnsons, etc., and more is
mentioned about them elsewhere.

Chapter 7.0: Summary and Recommendations

At the time when our first Swedes settled in Palm Valley in 1852-54, there were only
20 miles of railroad in Texas. The Buffalo Bayou, Brazos & Colorado Railroad, the first in
Texas, was built between 1852-53 from Harrisburg on the east coast to the Brazos River.
Until the 70’ s, there was no railroad closer than Hempstead, and later Brenham, to where
the railroad was built in 1860, and to Austin in 1872. The first railroad through the area
was the International & Great Northern line in 1875-76, and in 1878, the spur from Round
Rock to Georgetown was built. During the first twenty years, ox cart was therefore the only
means of communication for the pioneers.
The main industry was cattle-ranching. In the 70’ s, Williamson County could send other
products than cattle to the marketplace. The Swedes farmed more than the Texans who
considered it less profitable. With the railroad a new era began, and only with a statistical
comparison can you get an idea of the rapid growth of the area to which the Swedes have
contributed to such a large extent. In 1850 the number of whites in Williamson County
were only 4,529; in 1870, 6,368; in 1880, 15,155; in 1890, 25,909; in 1900, 38,072 whites
with 4,332 negroes; and in 1910, 42,228 whites. In 1870, Williamson County had a taxable
value of $1,839,900, and in 1913, $32,344,520. Its cotton crops has in some years given
Williamson County the second place in cotton production in the entire U.S.
The community has grown in all directions through the years, and it now reaches all the
way to the city of Round Rock where the population almost exclusively consists of Swedes.
Here we find the Swedish Lutheran college, Trinity College, and the best stores belong to
Swedes. Regarding commerce, we can say that Round Rock has gained importance
because of the energy and enterprise of the Nelson family. Among Swedish businesses
we find the John A. Nelson & Company bank, hardware, lumberyard and broom factory,
the stock-company, Round Rock Mercantile Company, Gustafson’s drugstore, Jackson’s
furniture store, Carlson’s shoe store, Bradys’ grocery, Söderberg’s bakery, and
Adolphson’s garage and auto repair. The customers in Round Rock are almost exclusively
Swedish. No Swedish church has been built in the city, but the people attend the countrychurch in Palm Valley where most of them are members, and there are services in Swedish
at Trinity College. The city has many beautiful Swedish homes. Among them are the
palatial residences of the bankers Carl and John Nelson, the home of the presidents of
Trinity College, J. C. Jackson, J. E. Gustafson, Dr. J. A. Stamline, etc. The wealthy
Swedish population live in the country around the city. The bitter pioneer days with its fight
for survival, are gone. A log cabin here and there reminds us of what used to be. There
are also some well-known historical sites: The beautiful manor where Arvid Nelson set
down his tent poles in 1854, and not far from there, the Caldwell place so well known from
earlier days where so many of the immigrants first came and worked for the first time, a
place that now belongs to William Palm, brother of Johannes Palm, who as we mentioned
earlier, first owned it and who was the only Swede to settle in the area with his mother and
siblings. Kinney’s Fort, or the Dyer Place, is another historical site. Through this place,
the Swedes are particularly connected with the history of Williamson County. As we have
described in more detail elsewhere, this place was the first Anglo-American colony in
Williamson County. It was bought by S.M. Swenson, was given to his sister, Mrs. Dyer, in
1852, and is still lived in and farmed by her son, Sven Dyer.

Among the historical people, places, and events identified by the Swedish heritage
committee in 1918, several properties survive at present to represent the Palm Valley Swedish
community as it developed over time. Most notable, perhaps, is the Palm Valley Lutheran Church

80

170158_arch_survey_report (rev)

Archeological and Historical Investigations of the Proposed
191.0-acre Kalahari Resorts Tract, Round Rock, Williamson County, Texas

and its associated cemetery, both of which date from the community’s earliest period of
development and are located west of the project area, Palm Valley Boulevard off US 79. The
earliest Swedish homestead of Anna Dyer (1853) was located near the earlier frontier site of
Kenney’s Fort, located south of the project area across Brushy Creek. A 1936 Centennial marker
commemorating this frontier fort as well as The Double-File Trail historical subject marker are
located approximately 0.5 kilometer (0.3 mile) west of the project area along the southern side of
Palm Valley Boulevard (US 79).
Several historic residential and commercial properties associated with the local Swedish
community are located in and around Round Rock’s downtown historic district, approximately
4.0 kilometers (2.5 miles) west of the project area. In addition, the Texas Family Land Heritage
property listings for Williamson County (TDA 2017) include several surviving agricultural
properties in Palm Valley that, based on the family surnames, appear to represent Swedish
farming and ranching in Palm Valley between 1854 and 1894. Among these, the former Telander
farm extends into the project area and includes two farmstead sites recorded during the current
survey (41WM1379 and 41WM1381).
The farmsteads recorded within the project area are components of the Palm Valley
settlement, a particularly influential Swedish immigrant community that developed in the late
19th to mid-20th centuries along Brushy Creek in south-central Williamson County. As noted by
Myers (et al. 1996) during their survey of agricultural properties in adjacent Travis County:
Swedish settlement in Texas [and the project area] began when Sven Magnus Swenson
emigrated to Texas in 1838. He was followed by his uncle, Swante Palm, in 1844. Palm,
in turn, brought his sister [Anna Palm] to live with him in 1847 and the following year, his
brothers Anders and Gustav Palm brought 25 Swedish immigrants to Texas. S.M.
Swenson and Anna Palm were founding members of Palm Valley, with Anna Pam’s home
site located across Brushy Creek from the project area. S.M. Swenson subdivided a large
swath of prime farmland along Brushy Creek into a series of long lots that were sold, most
often to other Swedish or German immigrant farmers…. In fact, northeast Travis and
southeast Williamson counties contained most of the state's exclusive Swedish
communities including Kimbro, Manor, Round Rock, Manda, New Sweden, Palm Valley
and Lund.

The following characterization of historic-period farmstead sites on the Blackland Prairie
of central Texas, as adapted from Myer et al.’s (1996) multi-property nomination of agricultural
properties in adjacent Travis County, applies equally well to the farmsteads recorded within the
project area:
In the historic period, the rural agricultural landscape of the Blackland Prairie typically
featured a farmstead situated on high ground and connected to the nearest public roadway
by a gravel or dirt driveway…. Typical early 20th-century farmsteads were family
operations with several generations of a single family living and working on the site. Some
family farms included long-term tenants or other non-related hired help within the
household. Swedish farmers grew cotton for cash, corn to feed livestock and draught
animals, and garden crops for family consumption. Fully developed farmsteads often
included a primary family dwelling with a variety of domestic and agricultural outbuildings,
including privy, a domestic cistern or well, a smokehouse, and a hot water house for

HJN 170158 AR

81

Chapter 7.0: Summary and Recommendations

laundry. Outside the domestic yard area were agricultural equipment barns or sheds,
livestock barns, poultry houses, pig sties as well as larger water tanks and windmills. Some
farms included separate dwellings and outbuildings for tenant farmers or sharecroppers….
Larger operations sometimes had buildings with numerous rooms or cribs to shelter
seasonal farm workers. Building complexes were usually set back but within sight of the
nearest county road.

As Swedish agricultural communities grew from the late 19th century into the mid20th century, thousands of such farmsteads were established across the Blackland Prairie of
Central Texas. Among these, the farmstead sites recorded in the project area reflect the farming
practices of the immigrant farmers, particularly Swedish and German immigrants, and the
evolution of their farm properties over time in southern Williamson County. However, as noted
by Vaughan (2010) during her survey of agricultural properties in northeastern Travis County, the
predominance of such farms across the rural landscape of Central Texas creates a problem of
over-abundance when evaluating such properties for historical significance. To the extent that
the farmsteads recorded within the project area reflect patterns of agricultural development and
land usage that were ubiquitous across Central Texas, they are not unique and lack sufficient
integrity to distinguish them from other rural farmsteads in Central Texas or in Williamson County.
The Texas Department of Agriculture’s Texas Family Land Heritage (TFLH) program
offers a somewhat more focused sample of registered Texas “Century Farms” for use in
evaluating the farmsteads recorded in the current project area. Among those Williamson County
registered TFLH farms selected for comparison based on similar ethnic affiliation and location
along Brushy Creek, the farmsteads in the project area are representative in the sense that their
land use remains agricultural; however, they have lost all or almost all of the built improvements
that were key elements of their history and character. Comparison of five registered TFLH farms
along Brushy Creek using aerial photography, public property records, and TFLH application
records revealed that none retains a fully intact complex of domestic and agricultural
improvements in association with the surrounding agricultural lands. In the case of the BellTelander farm (site 41WM1379) in the project area, a substantial number of domestic and
agricultural improvements still exist amid surrounding agricultural tracts; however, the central, key
element of the site, the original farmhouse, has been relocated to a separate homestead parcel
(41WM1381) and no longer retains its spatial and functional relationship to the remainder of the
farm’s domestic and agricultural complex. By comparison, its neighbor, the Johnson-Keller farm
(41WM1380), is more intact in the sense that it retains its original dwellings. However, those
dwellings and the overall complex of buildings are not directly associated with founding members
of the Palm Valley community and are, at best, a very modest representation of historical or
ethnically specific patterns for which the Swedes of Palm Valley and Central Texas are known.
Individually, sites 41WM1379 and 41WM1380 are interrelated and date from their late
19th-century origins as one of S.M. Swenson’s subdivided farm tracts along Brushy Creek. The
original farm dwelling, currently located on site 41WM1381, was first constructed by Barclay Bell
and her husband about 1900 on site 41WM1379, the Bell-Telander farm. This farm continued to
develop and operate until the early 21st century but is now abandoned. Between 1985 and 1995,
however, the large Folk Victorian farmhouse was moved from its original location on the BellTelander farm (site 41WM1379) to a small parcel carved out of the larger farm that was set aside

82

170158_arch_survey_report (rev)

Archeological and Historical Investigations of the Proposed
191.0-acre Kalahari Resorts Tract, Round Rock, Williamson County, Texas

as the life-estate of Mrs. Arnold Telander and her daughter, Grace Telander, herein designated
as site 41WM1381. Though the original Bell-Telander farm (site 41WM1379) retains a large
number and variety of domestic and agricultural improvements, the removal of the large
farmhouse has diminished the site’s historical integrity as well as its ability to represent historical
associations and patterns of agricultural development within this farm and within S.M Swenson’s
larger plan for development of the Palm Valley community. Most of the remaining buildings on
this farm date from the mid- to late 20th century.
The Johnson-Keller farm (site 41WM1380) is also located on one of S.M. Swenson’s
original subdivided tracts within the heart of Palm Valley. However, review of public property
records indicate that the property remained unimproved well into the 20th century when John N.
Johnson purchased the property from a short-term, absentee owner, C.H. Gilberg, in 1919. The
current complex of buildings on the site probably represents the site’s evolution after 1919,
including two residences, one built in the 1920s and another built in the 1940s, both of which have
been remodeled with stuccoed concrete block siding. The presence of two dwellings suggests
that the site was occupied by two families, possibly interrelated families, or by an owner with a
sharecropper or tenant farmer occupying the second dwelling. In either case, the site lacks the
usual array of older domestic dependencies (outhouses, chicken coops, pig sties, etc.) and the
array of agricultural outbuildings appear to date from the latter 20th century. Consequently, the
site does not appear to represent in a clear way the typical pattern of well developed Swedish
farmsteads that are historically associated with palm Valley.
The Telander Life Estate farm (site 41WM1381) represents a late 20th-century domestic
complex that features a ca. 1900 Folk Victorian dwelling that has been relocated and extensively
renovated in recent decades. Associated outbuildings all date from the late 20th century and
have no relation to the building’s prior history and associations with the Bell, Engstrand, Werner,
or Miller families who owned and operated the surrounding farmland. Though the building
generally retains the form and character of vernacular Victorian-era farmhouses that were once
very common across rural Williamson County, the recent relocation and alteration of this building
has greatly diminished its historical and architectural integrity.
Site 41WM12 consists of a low-density, surficial scatter of aboriginal lithic artifacts; a
localized moderate- to high-density scatter of 20th-century domestic debris; and a mid- to late
20th-century agricultural feature. The aboriginal component of site 41WM12 was originally
recorded by E.B. Jelks and E.M. Davis in 1960. At that time, the site was described as a surface
scatter of aboriginal lithic artifacts in a plowed field, including projectile points, knife fragments, a
burin, and numerous lithic cores and flakes. Temporally diagnostic artifacts observed included a
Fresno or Young arrow point and a Bulverde dart point, suggesting prehistoric occupations
ranging from the Late Archaic through Late Prehistoric periods. According to the original site
recorder, a Folsom dart point had been reported as being found on this site by a Mr. Rydell of
Hutto, which would suggest a Late PaleoIndian component as well. Subsequent investigations
on site 41WM12 have failed to document any additional temporally diagnostic cultural materials.
Currently, the prehistoric component of this site consists only of a low-density scatter of lithic
debris in a plowed field. No temporally diagnostic artifacts, preserved floral or faunal remains, or
evidence of cultural features were observed on the site, and the aboriginal occupation of the site

HJN 170158 AR

83

Chapter 7.0: Summary and Recommendations

can only be dated to an undetermined prehistoric timeframe. Cultural materials are constrained
to the modern ground surface (and possibly within the shallow plowzone). The aboriginal
archeological deposits have been disturbed via decades of seasonal plowing and crop harvesting
cycles. The site lacks integrity and possesses minimal potential to contribute to an understanding
of the prehistoric past.
The historic-age component of site 41WM12 consists of a scatter of 20th-centry domestic
debris and a linear agricultural feature. The scatter of domestic debris coincides with the former
location of a structure depicted on historical USGS topographic maps and aerial photographs
from at least 1925 to approximately 1954. This structure was removed by 1964. This former
structure is located on the same tract as the Bell-Telander farm and may have served as an
agricultural outbuilding or seasonal dwelling for farm workers associated with the Bell, Engstrand,
and/or Werner tenures of the farm. Currently, the site consists only of a surficial scatter of historicage domestic artifacts, including ceramic sherds, glass shards, and metal debris, in a plowed
field, but the site may once have contained an agricultural outbuilding associated with the Bell,
Engstrand, and/or Werner farms, and/or the structure may have served as a dwelling for farm
workers. While the site is associated with early 20th-century farming practices and the early
Swedish settlement of the area, the lack of any extant architectural or cultural features or intact
archeological deposits severely diminishes the significance of the site.
The linear agricultural feature consists of an alignment of broken concrete slabs, an
aluminum trough, and metal piping constructed on the crest of an elevated linear embankment
that formerly served as a private roadway the traversed the agricultural fields between US 79 to
the north and a low-water crossing on Brushy Creek to the south. This roadway appears to have
been abandoned by the 1960s or 1970s in favor of an at-grade field road that currently runs along
the western margin of the linear embankment. The agricultural feature was constructed along the
spine of the embankment at some point in the mid- to late 20th century following the abandonment
of the embankment as a roadway. While the feature is presumably associated with the historically
agricultural use of the surrounding fields and is therefore indicative of the broadly agricultural land
use of the project area, the feature is not itself architecturally or archeologically significant.

7.4

SUMMARY OF INVENTORY RESULTS

The 77.3-hectare (191.0-acre) tract currently proposed for development includes all or
portions of four of the cultural resources sites previously recorded during Horizon’s 2015-2016
survey, including three historic-age farmsteads (41WM1379, 41WM1380, and 41WM1381) and a
portion of a previously recorded prehistoric archeological site (41WM12). At TARL’s request, a
historic-age cultural component consisting of a scatter of domestic debris in a plowed field and a
linear agricultural feature was incorporated within previously recorded prehistoric archeological
site 41WM12 instead of being recorded as a separate archeological site (Table 7-1).

7.5

MANAGEMENT RECOMMENDATIONS

Based on the results of the survey-level investigations of the project area documented in
this report, no potentially significant cultural resources would be affected by the proposed
undertaking. In accordance with 36 CFR 800.4, Horizon has made a reasonable and good-faith

that meet the criteria for designation as SALs according to 13 TAC 26, and no further
archeological investigations or historical research are recommended in connection with the
proposed undertaking. However, it should be noted that human burials are protected under the
Texas Health and Safety Code. In the event that any human remains or burial objects are
inadvertently discovered at any point during construction, use, or ongoing maintenance in the
project area, even in previously surveyed areas, all work should cease immediately at the location
of the inadvertent discovery until a qualified archeologist can assess the find, and the THC should
be notified of the discovery.
