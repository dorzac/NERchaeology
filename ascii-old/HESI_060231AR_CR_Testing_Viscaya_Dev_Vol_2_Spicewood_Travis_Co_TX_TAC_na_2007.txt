MANAGEMENT SUMMARY

During the early months of 2007, Horizon Environmental Services, Inc. (Horizon)
conducted National Register of Historic Places (NRHP) eligibility testing on 2 prehistoric sites
(41TV2263 and 41TV2265) located in areas under the jurisdiction of the US Army Corps of
Engineers (USACE) within the proposed 1060-acre Vizcaya development near Spicewood,
Travis County, Texas. Although the development is privately funded and located on private
property, the development of the property within the USACE jurisdictional areas will require a
Section 404 permit issued by the USACE. As such, the development within these jurisdictional
areas falls under the regulations of Section 106 of the National Historic Preservation Act
(NHPA) of 1966, as amended. Horizon conducted the NRHP eligibility testing investigations on
sites 41TV2263 and 41TV2265 at the request of the Lake Travis Ranch, LLC in compliance with
Section 106 of the NHPA. The purpose of the NRHP eligibility testing investigations was to
determine if sites 41TV2263 and 41TV2265 possessed cultural deposits eligible for inclusion in
the NRHP.
Site 41TV2263 was originally recorded as an aboriginal open campsite straddling a
drainage above the Colorado River. Visible cultural features on the site included 3 burned rock
middens aligned in a triangle. Artifact frequencies on this site appeared to be densest in the
area contained within the triangle formed by the 3 middens. Areas of the site beyond the
middens consisted of exposed limestone bedrock and shallow rocky soils with no apparent
potential to contain buried deposits. During the NRHP testing investigations, 2 extensive
backhoe trenches were placed on the site. These trenches revealed that the 3 middens are
composed almost solely of burned rock and black midden soil. Very few other artifacts were
observed within the excavated matrix, suggesting that these 3 middens represent “kitchen
middens” where plant baking was the primary activity rather than “trash middens” that would
have accreted from repeated episodes of refuse dumping during the Late Archaic I and Late
Prehistoric periods based on humate dates. Due to the lack of materials aside from copious
amounts of burned rock within the 3 burned rock middens on this site, the lack of floral and
faunal preservation, and the general lack of buried deposits in the associated areas surrounding
the middens, it is Horizon’s opinion that site 41TV2263 is not eligible for inclusion in the NRHP.
Horizon recommends that cultural resources clearance be granted for this location.
Site 41TV2265 is also an aboriginal site situated in what prehistorically was an upland
ridgeline above the confluence of Bee Creek and the Colorado River. Due to the extensive

nature of this site, it was subdivided into 2 areas during the investigations: the Upper Midden
area above the conservation pool of Lake Travis and the Lower Midden area, which is typically
inundated within the conservation pool of Lake Travis. Testing investigations in both of these
areas consisted of backhoe trenching efforts and hand-excavated test units. Based on the
recovered data, the Upper Midden area of this site appears to represent the remnants of
communal oven baking activities between the Late Archaic I and Late Prehistoric periods, while
the Lower Midden area is interpreted as the actual encampment or living area associated with
the development of the upper middens. Because of its upland setting, the Upper Midden area
of the site was found be entirely lacking in deeply buried, stratified cultural deposits with the
exception of the deposits within the 2 investigated burned rock middens. Unfortunately, these
middens were found to contain only sparse cultural debris other than burned rock (perceived as
a result of keeping the area free from daily domestic refuse) and no floral and faunal
preservation. Due to this, it is Horizon’s opinion that the Upper Midden area does not contribute
to the overall NRHP eligibility status of site 41TV2265 and that no further investigations are
warranted in this area.
The Lower Midden area of site 41TV2265 is situated in an area that is routinely
inundated by Lake Travis. Prehistorically, it consisted of an upland area that would typically not
contain deeply buried, stratified deposits. After its inundation, whatever deposits the area once
contained have now been stripped away and deflated over the vast majority of the surface of
this area of the site via wave action. The exception to this is the BRM-5 pit feature that was
found to retain a considerable amount of subsurface cultural deposits indicative of occupations
at the site between the late Paleo-Indian period up through the Late Prehistoric period, with the
most intensive utilization of the area during the Austin phase of the Late Prehistoric period.
Although this feature appears to be the remnants of an aboriginal refuse midden or “landfill,” the
deposits have been heavily disturbed by bioturbation. Additionally, the portions of this feature
that remained after the current testing investigations have been effectively dissolved by the
rising waters and destroyed by the recent re-inundation of the site. With this in mind, it is
Horizon’s opinion that, like the Upper Midden area, the Lower Midden area of site 41TV2265 is
not a contributing element to the overall NRHP eligibility status of the site and the site as a
whole is considered to be ineligible for inclusion in the NRHP. Horizon therefore recommends
that the granting of the necessary USACE permit for the undertaking be allowed to proceed
because, after the 2007 testing investigations, none of the sites appear to be eligible for
inclusion in the NRHP.

1.0 INTRODUCTION

This document reports the results of National Register of Historic Places (NRHP)
eligibility testing on 2 prehistoric sites (41TV2263 and 41TV2265) located in areas under the
jurisdiction of the US Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) within the proposed 1060-acre Vizcaya
development near Spicewood, Travis County, Texas (Figures 1 through 3). The development
will consist of a luxury residential golf-course community in the Hill Country with up to 500
custom homes, hiking trails, a marina, and an 18-hole Reese Jones-designed golf course.
Although the development is privately funded and located on private property, the development
of the property within the USACE jurisdictional areas will require a Section 404 permit issued by
the USACE. As such, the development within these jurisdictional areas falls under the
regulations of Section 106 of the National Historic Preservation Act (NHPA) of 1966, as
amended. Horizon Environmental Services, Inc. (Horizon) conducted the NRHP eligibility
testing investigations on sites 41TV2263 and 41TV2265 at the request of the Lake Travis
Ranch, LLC in compliance with Section 106 of the NHPA. The purpose of the NRHP eligibility
testing investigations was to determine if sites 41TV2263 and 41TV2265 possessed cultural
deposits eligible for inclusion in the NRHP.
The cultural resources investigations reported herein consisted of testing level
investigations on sites 41TV2263 and 41TV2265, geomorphological/geoarcheological
assessments on each, and the production of a report suitable for review by the State Historic
Preservation Officer (SHPO) in accordance with the Texas Historical Commission’s (THC)
Rules of Practice and Procedure, Chapter 26, Section 27, and the Council of Texas
Archeologists’ (CTA) Guidelines for Cultural Resources Management Reports. Russell
Brownlow (Horizon’s cultural resources director) served as the project’s Principal Investigator.
Ron Ralph (archeological subconsultant) supervised the field crew consisting of Reign Clark,
Jared Wiersema, Michael Mudd, Abigail Weinstein, and Diamond Kapanday.
Horizon originally conducted the survey of the USACE jurisdictional areas within the
Project Area on the 11th and 12th of March 2007. The survey level investigations and results
are reported in Volume 1. The survey of the USACE jurisdictional areas resulted in the
documentation of 3 prehistoric sites (41TV2263, 41TV2264, and 41TV2265). Of these 3 sites,
41TV2264 was found to consist of sparse amounts of cultural material situated in an area of
exposed bedrock, and, as such, was considered to be ineligible for inclusion in the NRHP. The

remaining 2 sites, 41TV2263 and 41TV2265, were both documented as prehistoric
encampments, each with multiple burned rock middens. As the survey level data was not
deemed adequate to assess the NRHP eligibility of these sites, the NRHP eligibility status of
each was considered to be undetermined. Horizon recommended testing investigations on
these sites in order to formally determine the NRHP status of each. These NRHP testing
investigations were conducted between 29 March and 1 April 2007.
Site 41TV2263 was originally recorded as an aboriginal open campsite straddling a
drainage above the Colorado River (Figure 4). Visible cultural features on the site included 3
burned rock middens aligned in a triangle (see Figure 4). Based on observed surface materials,
artifact frequencies on this site appeared to be densest in the area contained within the triangle
formed by the 3 middens. Areas of the site beyond the middens consisted of exposed
limestone bedrock and shallow rocky soils with no apparent potential to contain buried deposits
and few visible artifacts on the site surface. During the NRHP testing investigations, 2 extensive
backhoe trenches were placed on the site. One trench, measuring 38.0 meters (m) in length,
extended from near the center of the largest midden on the site (BRM-1) across the
southeastern end of the site into BRM-2. While this trench was initiated near the center of
BRM-1, dense tree growth prohibited trenching across the entire midden. As such, although the
trench was placed as close as possible to the center of the midden and no visible outline of a
central depression was noted, the presence of such a depression within BRM-1 is
undetermined. The second trench, measuring 40.0 m in length, initiated in the center of BRM-3
and extended to the southeast across the central portion of the site. These 2 trenches formed
an upside down “T” over the central portion of the site between the middens. Like BRM-1, no
visible central depressions were observed in the trenches through BRM-2 and BRM-3. During
the trenching efforts on site 41TV2263, all excavated matrices were only visually monitored and
trowel/shovel-sorted. No excavated matrices were screened. Based on the low amounts of
observable cultural materials within the excavated trench matrices, the hand-excavation of test
units was deemed to be unwarranted. However, a column of soil samples was extracted from
the central portion of BRM-1 for later humate dating and flotation.
Generally speaking, the NRHP testing investigations on site 41TV2263 revealed that the
3 middens are composed almost solely of burned rock and black midden soil. Very few other
artifacts were observed during the trowel/shovel-sorting of the excavated trench matrix,
suggesting that these 3 middens represent “kitchen middens” where plant baking was the
primary activity rather than “trash middens” that would have accreted from repeated episodes of
refuse dumping during the Late Archaic I and Late Prehistoric periods indicated by humate
dates produced from soil samples taken from BRM-1. The trenches across the central portion
of the site revealed generally sparse and shallow cultural deposits overlying the marl
substratum. The few observed cultural materials consisted of mano fragments, metate
fragments, and a nutting stone fragment. Based on the presence of these plant processing
implements in association with the 3 “kitchen” middens, as well as the general lack of other
domestic debris, it would appear that site 41TV2263 represents a plant processing activity area
that was perhaps situated away from an associated encampment. As this site is located just
above the current levels of Lake Travis, any associated encampments could be located in
submerged areas closer to the actual channel of the Colorado River. Due to the lack of

observed cultural materials aside from copious amounts of burned rock within the 3 burned rock
middens on this site, the lack of floral and faunal preservation, and the general lack of buried
deposits in the associated areas surrounding the middens, it is Horizon’s opinion that site
41TV2263 is not eligible for inclusion in the NRHP. Horizon recommends that cultural
resources clearance be granted for this location.
Site 41TV2265 was initially recorded as an extensive aboriginal campsite located on
what currently is a peninsula that extends into Lake Travis (Figure 5). Low-lake levels at the
time of the original survey allowed for the documentation of portions of the site that have been
submerged by the lake for roughly the past 70 years. The site consists of upland locations
entirely lacking in alluvial deposits. As such, cultural debris was scattered on the surface over a
large area. Observed projectile points on the site suggested that the site was occupied
potentially as early as the Paleo-Indian period up through the Late Prehistoric period. In
addition to the observed surface materials, 5 burned rock middens were observed at various
locations on this large site. Three of the middens are located in an upland area along the ridge
of the peninsula (Upper Midden area), while 2 are located on a finger of the peninsula that has
been submerged by the lake (Lower Midden area). While all 5 middens appeared to be
composed of dense amounts of burned rock situated on shallow soils or limestone bedrock, a
probe or “pokey rod” pressed into the midden closest to the lake (BRM-5) during the survey
level investigations extended to a depth of 1.5 meters below surface, suggesting some sort of
pit or karst feature beneath the midden deposits.
During the NRHP eligibility testing of the Upper Midden area of site 41TV2265, 3
backhoe trenches were excavated over 2 of the upper middens (2 trenches over BRM-1 and 1
trench over BRM-2), and two 1 x 1-m test units were hand-excavated off the resulting trench
profiles in BRM-1. These 2 hand-excavated test units were placed over the thickest portions of
the BRM-1 revealed in each of the 2 trenches on this feature and were excavated to the bedrock
underlying the midden. The investigations revealed that the upper middens on site 41TV2265
also appear to be “kitchen” middens similar to those documented on nearby site 41TV2263.
While relatively large, the upper middens consist primarily of spent burned rock and black
midden soil. Other recovered artifacts include only a small amount of chert debitage, freshwater
mussel shell, 1 Darl dart point, and 2 Pedernales dart point bases. These specimens suggest
that the upper middens were in use during Johnson and Goode’s (1994) Late Archaic I and II
periods. The general sparseness of domestic refuse within these middens again points to the
use of this location as an activity area were the baking of plants (and mussels) occurred away
from an associated living area. In fact, the density of materials documented in the vicinity of the
lower middens suggest that the Lower Midden area may represent such a possible living area
found a short distance from the upper “kitchen” middens. However, due to the sparseness of
cultural materials other than spent cooking rock, the Upper Midden area is not considered to be
a contributing element to the overall NRHP eligibility of site 41TV2265.
The Lower Midden area of site 41TV2265 is located on a small peninsula that is
normally submerged within the conservation pool of Lake Travis. During prehistory, this location
would have been an elevated ridge above the confluence of the Colorado River and Bee Creek.
As this portion of the site had been submerged for roughly the past 70 years, the entire landform

had been completely eroded/deflated by wave action, leaving behind a considerable amount of
cultural material on the cobbled limestone surface of the site. However, as noted above, at
least 1 area of the site appeared to possess potential subsurface deposits based on the
placement of a “pokey rod” within what appeared to be a deflated midden. To assess this
portion of the site, a total of 7 backhoe trenches were excavated over the extent of the landform.
These trenches revealed the presence of an extensive natural basin that appears to have
resulted from a tree throw event. A total of twenty-one 1 x 1-m test units were placed within the
confines of the pit feature and in areas immediately adjacent to it. Although the majority of the
site was found to consist of exposed limestone bedrock, cultural deposits were documented
within the pit feature and copious amounts of cultural materials were recovered from its upper
extents. The deposits appear to reflect the usage of the pit as a possible refuse midden (trash
pit), followed by the later accretion of dense amounts of additional cultural refuse (inclusive of
burned rock) over the surface of the feature. The historic submersion of the site by lake waters
appears to have then dissolved the midden deposits into a thin, yet concentrated, drape of
cultural materials over the pit. A variety of projectile points recovered over the peninsula
suggest a usage of the area throughout prehistory, while numerous Scallorn and Edwards arrow
points suggest that the pit feature is most heavily utilized by occupations during the Late
Prehistoric period. Toward the end of the field investigations, heavy rains doused the Colorado
River drainage basin and lake levels began a drastic rise. Waters began to seep into the
excavated trenches and test units, dissolving the few remaining intact portions of the pit
deposits. In the final day of fieldwork, lake waters completely covered this portion of the site
well below 6 to 8 feet of water.
Generally speaking, the vast majority of site 41TV2265 is lacking in buried deposits due
to its upland setting. The only areas found to retain buried deposits consist of the 5 middens
documented at various locations on the site. Of these 5 middens, 4 appear to represent
“kitchen” middens that are relatively void of associated artifacts within their matrices of burned
rock and black soil. While these locations appear to represent activity areas within an overall
larger settlement, the absence of intact deposits surrounding these features (due to exposed
bedrock) serves to nullify their significance as they lack associated contexts. The exception to
this is BRM-5, a midden that appears to have accreted over a large pit that was utilized as a
refuse disposal area by the inhabitants of the site. Investigations within this feature did produce
ample amounts of domestic refuse consisting of, in large part, temporally diagnostic materials
and at least a minute amount of preserved charred plant remnants. Unfortunately, the deposits
within this relatively unique feature appear to have been considerably churned by rodent and
clam burrowing, as well as by probable Late Prehistoric group scavenging within the deposits.
In addition, the bulk of the deposits within this feature were excavated via trenching and handexcavated units during the testing investigations. Although portions of the deposits were left
intact, the final days of the investigations witnessed the infilling of the excavated areas with lake
waters welling up from below the site and the subsequent melting and destruction of the
remaining portions of the feature matrices. With this in mind, while the Lower Midden area
originally contained 1 area of subsurface deposits, the current investigation removed the bulk of
these deposits and the remaining deposits have since been destroyed. This suggests that the
Lower Midden area retains no additional intact data capable of addressing the prehistory of the

HJN 060231 AR

area. With this in mind, it is Horizon’s opinion that, like the Upper Midden area, the Lower
Midden area of site 41TV2265 is not a contributing element to the overall NRHP eligibility status
of the site and the site as a whole is considered to be ineligible for inclusion in the NRHP.
Horizon therefore recommends that the granting of the necessary USACE permit for the
undertaking be allowed to proceed because, after the 2007 testing investigations, none of the
sites appear to be eligible for inclusion in the NRHP.

2.0 RESEARCH DESIGN

Due to the varying settings of sites 41TV2263 and 41TV2265, the research questions
posited for the current investigations vary in pertinence between the 2 sites as well as between
the different areas on site 41TV2265 (i.e., the Upper and Lower Midden areas). Site 41TV2263
and the Upper Midden area of site 41TV2265 are both located in upland areas where shallow
soils and exposed limestone bedrock are prevalent, and, as such, are generally lacking in
buried deposits beyond those of the actual burned rock middens. Therefore, the research
questions addressing these 2 areas are generally vaguer, focusing more on questions that the
specific feature contexts can address. The Lower Midden area of site 41TV2265 has been
submerged for most of the past 70 years by the waters of Lake Travis. The recent exposure of
this portion of site 41TV2265 due to drought conditions and associated low lake levels afforded
the opportunity to assess the impacts of inundation to prehistoric sites within the conservation
pool of the lake. As such, while numerous research questions are posited for the 2 sites, fewer
pertain to 41TV2263 and the Upper Midden area of 41TV2265, while all of them, including those
regarding the inundation of sites and the results of such impacts to their cultural deposits,
pertain to the Lower Midden area of site 41TV2265. Indications of the relevance of each
research question to the sites or the site areas are discussed within the text of each research
question below.

2.1

TEMPORAL PERIODS

Two of the most basic questions posited for both sites are when were the sites occupied
during prehistory and when did the midden features on each develop. Currently, the lack of
diagnostic implements from site 41TV2263 prohibits the delineation of when this site was
utilized. On the other hand, varying projectile points recovered from 41TV2265 during the
survey-level investigations indicate a utilization of the area potentially as early as the PaleoIndian period up through the Late Prehistoric period. However, these temporal indicators serve
to predominantly reflect the periods when the site was occupied and not necessarily what period
or periods that the midden accretion occurred. As such, the recovery of additional temporally
diagnostic materials from both sites and their midden features was necessary during the
investigations to adequately place their occupations into a temporal framework as well as to
delineate when their features developed and were utilized. Materials necessary for this included
formal tools with distinctive styles that have been associated with the various temporal periods,

HJN 060231 AR

11

Chapter 2.0: Research Design

as well as preserved carbonized materials, humate samples with preserved organic contents,
and even land snail shells for radiometric dating.

2.2

MIDDEN TYPE/FORMATION

As burned rock middens are the premiere features noted so far on both sites 41TV2263
and 41TV2265, obvious questions about these features include what type of middens are they
(communal oven remnants or refuse dumps) and how did they form. Are they dome, annular, or
sheet middens? What types of materials are included within their contexts? Are they
composed solely of burned rock and primarily lacking in other debris, suggesting more of a
communal oven or “kitchen” midden, or do they contain a variety of domestic debris suggestive
more of a refuse dump? Did they accrete on a flat surface or around a central basin or even
over a karst feature? Also, did later folks rummage within the midden contexts while
scavenging for lithic materials? To determine the answers to this variety of questions, backhoe
trenches and hand-excavated units within the midden contexts will be necessary as will
subsequent radiocarbon assays for dating and flotation analysis to determine if preserved
botanicals are present.

2.3

RESOURCE EXPLOITATION

As the development of burned rock middens is attributable to the use of heated rock as a
heating element within earth ovens and the subsequent discard of “spent” rock that has broken
into fragments incapable of holding heat, it is only logical that the middens on both sites have
the potential to harbor remains of the food sources that were being baked within the ovens
alongside the rock. Whether the middens on the sites represent annular middens with a central
baking pit or dome middens resulting from the repeated dumping of spent cooking rock that has
been removed from oven basins, it was assumed that the potential existed for charred food
fragments to have also found their way into the middens alongside the disposed rock. As such,
investigations within the midden deposits had the potential for the recovery of such food
remains that would shed additional light on the resource exploitation practices of groups in the
region. Namely, the remains of various types of geophytes, including camas bulbs and sotol
tubers, have been found in increasing numbers amidst the contents of burned rock features,
leading archeologists to reason that most middens resulted from extended baking periods
necessary to reduce the indigestible starches and inulin in the geophytic plants into digestible
simple sugars. To address the question of resource exploitation, the investigated features
needed to contain preserved floral and faunal materials.

2.4

SITE UTILIZATION AND INTRA-SITE PATTERNING

While a basic question, it is still relevant to address how each of the sites was utilized
during prehistory. Were they merely open campsites, or were they specialized activity sites
such as plant processing locales? Site 41TV2265 is an extensive site that appears to reflect
repeated episodes of occupation based on the variety and density of observed tool forms and
features, while 41TV2263 appears to possess a generally sparse artifact assemblage flanking
its 3 large middens. It seems unlikely that such middens could have accreted without a series
of extended associated occupations.
However, if 41TV2263 functioned as a plant

12

060231_arch_testing_report

Volume 2: NRHP Testing Investigations within the Proposed 1060-Acre Vizcaya Development

processing/baking location and the occupations occurred at a different but nearby location, then
a sparser assemblage is easier explained. As such, one of the basic questions addressed by
the testing investigations is what types of sites do 41TV2263 and 41TV2265 represent.
Much like determining differences between the activities conducted at each of the 2
sites, the extensive nature of site 41TV2265 also suggests the potential for differing activity
areas within the site itself. While the limited nature of testing-level investigations were not
adequate to address intra-site patterning over the full extent of site 41TV2265, the fact that the
Lower Midden area of the site appeared to be completely deflated by wave action was viewed
as an opportunity allow for such determinations in this portion of the site. The deflation
appeared to have resulted in a washing away of soil matrices, leaving behind larger and denser
materials such as hammer stones, groundstone, and larger flaked implements visible on the
stripped surface of this portion of the site and amidst the deposits of shell hash the remained
over portions of the site. A quantification of these materials and their distribution over the site
had the potential to allow for the delineation of activity areas. Moreover, the actual types of
materials also allowed for a generalization regarding the division of labor on the site. For
example, if one area retained a significant number of manos and metates, while another
retained a higher quantity of hammer stones and cores, such materials might indicate that
women conducted more activity in the area of the metates while men focused their efforts in the
area containing the lithic reduction materials.
In addition to the delineation of activity areas, the potential existed that an assessment of
the intra-site patterning could also reveal evidence of aboriginal structures. Although generally
rare, aboriginal structures have been documented at the Graham-Applegate and Lion Creek
sites upstream on Lake Buchanan (Johnson 1997). Others have been documented at the Slab
site in Llano County (Patterson 1987) and the Turkey Bend Ranch site in Concho County (Lintz
et al. 1995). All are represented by circular alignments of stone surrounding a central hearth
feature. With the deflation of the deposits in the Lower Midden area on site 41TV2265, the
potential existed that such a feature or features could be exposed on this site as well.

2.5

CULTURAL INTERACTION AND TRADE

Evidence of interaction between different cultural groups and the trading of goods would
presumably manifest itself via the presence of exotic materials and non-local objects such as
marine shell or imported lithic materials within the artifact assemblages of both sites. For
example, a groundstone implement of Packsaddle schist was recovered from the surface of site
41TV2265 during the earlier survey efforts. This suggests some degree of trade or perhaps an
extended range of aboriginal yearly rounds into areas where such materials were available
during prehistory. As such, the field investigation sought to recovery additional samples of nonlocal materials that further indicate potential areas of trade or interaction.

2.6

HUMAN INTERMENTS

Although somewhat rare, the potential existed for the presence of human interments
within the 3 middens on site 41TV2263 and 5 middens on site 41TV2265. As such, one aspect
of the investigations was to determine the presence/absence of human burials and associated

HJN 060231 AR

13

Chapter 2.0: Research Design

burial furniture within the middens. This required, at a minimum, the placement of backhoe
trenches within/across each midden and the examination of the resulting profiles and spoil to
determine if preserved human bone is present and/or if any indications of deliberate grave
arrangement were visible.

2.7

ASSOCIATION OF THE LOWER MIDDEN AREA WITH THE UPPER MIDDEN AREA

On site 41TV2265, 3 of the observed burned rock middens are located on the upland
ridge of the landform, while 2 are located on a lower ridge closer to the confluence of Bee Creek
and the Colorado River. The differing locales of the middens on this site begged the question of
whether all 5 of the middens accreted during the same temporal period(s) or whether different
groups during various temporal periods selected different locations over the site to conduct their
plant processing activities and waste disposal. In addition, if the middens formed earlier in
prehistory, the potential existed that later groups rummaged through all of the middens for lithic
materials, leaving behind evidence such as diagnostic arrow points and later charcoal. As a
result, the middens had the potential to retain evidence of earlier, unrelated accumulations as
well as a later temporal association resulting from the “mining” of their deposits by scavenging
groups. The recovery of temporally diagnostic materials and preserved, datable carbonized
plant remains from within the midden contexts was necessary to determine if the middens at the
various locations on the site are associated.

2.8

COMPARISON OF 41TV2265 WITH 41TV22

Prior to the construction of Mansfield Dam and the flooding of the reservoir, A.T.
Jackson and A.M. Woolsey conducted archeological investigations on a nearby midden site,
41TV22 (Woolsey 1938). Their investigations focused on a burned rock midden that appeared
to be anywhere from a short distance to the west of 41TV2265 up to 1.5 miles up Bee Creek
from 41TV2265 (see Vol. 1). Although their recording methods somewhat differed in intensity
from those of today, consisting primarily of a laundry list of recovered materials, the relative
proximity of the 2 sites suggested that both may have been occupied by the same groups over
time. As such, at a minimum, a comparison of the recovered assemblages had the potential to
reveal similarities in tool styles, lending evidence to settlement patterns in the area. Differences
in the assemblages also had the potential to reflect differing types of activities that possibly
occurred at each site.

2.9

HIGH SURFACE ARTIFACT DENSITY = BURIED MIDDENS

During excavations on sites 41WM312 and 41WM632 in nearby Williamson County,
Voellinger and Gearhart (1987) addressed the relationship between surface and subsurface
assemblages. They noticed that surface artifact densities had a tendency to increase by
varying degrees in the vicinity of visible burned rock middens. Subsequently, they reasoned
that areas of high surface artifact density that were not adjacent to a visible midden may
indicate the presence of a buried midden. Although they noted that this did not prove to be a
highly reliable indicator due to their lack of adequate sensitivity in their surface collecting
technique as well as the variable factor of post-occupational soil deposition, they did
recommend that future investigations in the area should take this into consideration.

14

060231_arch_testing_report

Volume 2: NRHP Testing Investigations within the Proposed 1060-Acre Vizcaya Development

With Voellinger and Gearhart’s (1987) recommendation in mind, Brownlow (2004) set
out to test this hypothesis on site 41WM650, another midden site that had also been
documented within the Block House Creek development by Voellinger and Gearhart (1987).
During testing investigations on site 41WM650, Brownlow (2004) noted an area of the site with
a high density of surface lithic materials (i.e., chert debitage and flaked stone implements) and
subsequently placed a series of backhoe trenches and test units over the area. These
investigations revealed the presence of a buried annular midden, suggesting that Voellinger and
Gearhart’s (1987) original hypothesis was correct.
In regard to the current investigations, the Lower Midden area of site 41TV2265 was
documented as having an area of high surface artifact density over an area where a pokey rod
extended to a considerable depth during the survey-level investigations. Based on the results of
the investigations of Voellinger and Gearhart (1987) and Brownlow (2004), this area on site
41TV2265 was suspected to also represent a potential buried midden and lended itself to the
further testing of Voellinger and Gearhart’s (1987) hypothesis that high surface artifact densities
equate to buried middens. To accomplish this, a series of surface collections over the site were
necessary to delineate the area possessing the greatest surface density. Following this,
subsurface trenching at the location of the highest surface density was determined to be an
effective method of revealing a buried midden, if present.

2.10

USE OF DEPRESSIONS, PITS, AND SINKHOLES AS MIDDENS

While testing Voellinger and Gearhart’s (1987) buried midden hypothesis on site
41WM650, Brownlow (2004) also assessed the makeup of a large dome midden on the same
site. Although the visible extents of this midden suggested a mound of burned rock measuring
approximately 50 centimeters (cm) thick, a series of backhoe trenches within the midden
contexts revealed that the midden had actually accreted over a large karst feature/solution
cavity and possessed an overall thickness of roughly 1.5 m thick. A similar phenomenon was
noted by Voellinger and Gearhart (1987) on nearby site 41WM312. However, the solution
cavities below the midden on this site were small holes and not a large cavity like that on
41WM650. Mehalchick et al. (2003) documented a large domed midden that had accreted over
a small gulley on site 41BL349, and Trierweiler (1995 and 1996) noted the presence of
sinkholes on sites 41BL740, 41CV71, and 41CV1165. However, none of the sinkholes on these
3 sites were covered with midden deposits.
The Lower Midden area of site 41TV2265 appeared to consist of a deflated area that
had been eroded down to limestone bedrock by wave action in many places. In most flat to low
slope areas in this portion of the site, the surface was mantled with gravel armor that precluded
seeing the actual soil surface, if present. However, a pokey rod placed over a suspected
deflated midden in this area met no resistance from bedrock and extended to a depth of almost
1.5 m.
This suggested another possible sinkhole/pit/gully over which the presumed midden
had accreted. As such, the Lower Midden area on site 41TV2265 afforded the opportunity to
potentially document another midden that developed over a natural depression and possibly
shed light on an aboriginal practice that has not been thoroughly documented by previous
researchers.

2.11

EROSIONAL EFFECTS ON INUNDATED SITES

The Lower Midden area of site 41TV2265 is located between the elevations of
approximately 655 and 665 feet above mean sea level (amsl), an elevation that corresponds
closely with the 671 feet amsl average elevation of Lake Travis. This places the site in what can
be considered a shoreline or beach zone setting. In their National Reservoir Inundation Study,
Lenihan et al. (1981) stated:
Unfortunately, the “effective” beach zone of most reservoirs is significantly
increased by seasonal fluctuations in the reservoir pool level, which may significantly
enhance the destructive potential of wave action. As the reservoir pool level draws down,
breaking waves strike the saturated and unconsolidated sediments of the reservoir basin
which have already been deprived of a protective vegetative cover. These fragile
sediments are susceptible not only to wave erosion but also to subsequent wind and
water runoff erosion within the exposed drawdown zone.

This suggested that the cultural deposits within the Lower Midden area of site 41TV2265, as
well as other archeological sites within shoreline settings along Lake Travis, have endured a
considerable amount of erosion from wave action, wind, and runoff. The actual degree of
erosion remained to be determined, although the presence of exposed limestone bedrock in this
zone indicated rather extreme erosion, which in turn had likely severely impacted the cultural
deposits.
Lenihan et al. (1981) summarized numerous assessments of archeological sites within
shoreline zones of reservoirs in their study.
1. Wave action on sites near the maximum pool elevation has resulted in the
erosion and redeposition of loosely consolidated soils, charcoal, bone, and other
light-weight materials and the consolidation of heavier cultural materials.
2. In most assessed sites, small, lightweight materials were generally sparse, while
large, dense artifacts (e.g. groundstone) were overabundant.
3. Wave generated mechanical impacts to several assessed sites revealed
deflation rates of over 2 cm per year. On certain sites, wave action had
completely stripped all original site matrices, some in excess of 1 m in depth
based on exposed tree stumps still rooted in the substrate.
4. Midden deposits appear to be the most susceptible to adverse impacts by
inundation. In several observed instances, mounded midden deposits were
completely leveled at shoreline locations. In addition, burrowing ground squirrels
and rodents were found to commonly target the loosely consolidated midden
deposits when exposed, while burrowing clams acted similarly when the middens
were submerged. In turn, raccoons and other scavengers then targeted the
clams within the exposed midden deposits.
Based on Lenihan et al.’s (1981) study, it appeared that the Lower Midden area of site
41TV2265 is situated in a highly dynamic setting where the potential for intact deposits is

16

060231_arch_testing_report

Volume 2: NRHP Testing Investigations within the Proposed 1060-Acre Vizcaya Development

decreased. One question to be addressed by the current investigations was whether this
portion of the site reflects similar qualities to those presented by Lenihan et al. (1981), and, if
not, why. Also, if it did, can it be assumed that other sites along the shoreline of Lake Travis
have also undergone significant impacts and are likely lacking intact deposits?

2.12

PRESERVATION OF ORGANICS AFTER INUNDATION

The Lower Midden area of site 41TV2265 has been submerged for the majority of the
last 70 years since the construction of Mansfield Dam. As such, the potential existed that
various processes have served to deplete or destroy any preserved organic remains that may
have once existed within the site’s deposits. Based on both laboratory experiments and field
assessments, Lenihan et al. (1981) concluded that sites within reservoir settings possess
differential degrees of preservation. They noted that, in the laboratory studies, all material
categories, with the exception of lithics, exhibited some degree of deterioration after exposure to
normal and concentrated chemical solutions. Similarly, samples of the same materials exhibited
similar degrees of deterioration when placed in a reservoir setting. However, they noted that
data from assessed archeological sites that had been inundated were inclusive. This was
primarily due to the lack of investigations on the sites prior to inundation in order to develop a
baseline of the preservation at each. Although some sites exhibited no preservation after being
submerged for 20 years, it remained unclear if these sites even possessed preserved materials
prior to their inundation.
With no pre-inundation baseline established for the Lower Midden area of site
41TV2265, the potential for determining whether the inundation of the Lower Midden area on
site 41TV2265 has served to deplete or destroy any preserved organic remains was believed to
be generally impossible. However, one avenue thought to have the potential to aid in this
assessment consisted of first determining if preserved organic materials existed within the
Lower Midden area deposits AND within the deposits in the vicinity of the Upper Midden area. If
no organic materials were recovered from either of the Upper or Lower Midden areas, it could
be argued that organic preservation did not exist at the site prior to inundation. Similarly, if
preserved organics were present at both, it would be argued that the inundation of the Lower
Midden area of the site has not completely destroyed all organic materials. If no organic
materials were recovered in the Lower Midden area but they were recovered from the Upper
Midden, it could be argued that inundation has in fact impacted the preservation of organic
materials in the submerged portion of the site.

2.13

CONTAMINATION OF PRESERVED CARBON

One question pertaining to the Lower Midden area of site 41TV2265 as well as other
archeological sites within the conservation pool of Lake Travis is whether datable carbonized
plant remains, if preserved, have been contaminated by biochemical processes resulting from
inundation. Put simpler, have biochemical processes affected the Carbon-14 (C-14) dating of
preserved materials? In their National Reservoir Inundation Study, Lenihan et al. (1981)
indicated that freshwater immersion should not alter the potential of samples to yield usable
dates, with the exception of freshwater shell. They supported this with the results of C-14

HJN 060231 AR

17

Chapter 2.0: Research Design

assays from 4 reservoirs where carbonized materials were collected in association with
temporally diagnostic artifacts. In all cases, the resulting assays corresponded with the
anticipated date of the sites based on diagnostic projectile point styles. They concluded that the
results from this limited sample argue strongly for the continued viability of C-14 as a dating
technique in reservoir areas. The Lower Midden area of site 41TV2265 offered the chance to
support or refute their findings as they relate to archeological sites on Lake Travis. To do this,
the recovery of carbonized plant remains and temporally diagnostic implements was a
necessary result of the investigations.

3.0 METHODOLOGY

This chapter describes the field, geoarcheological, collection, recording, and laboratory
methods utilized during the NRHP testing investigations on sites 41TV2263 and 41TV2265.

3.1

FIELD METHODS

The field methods utilized during NRHP testing investigations varied by site as well as by
location in the case of 41TV2265.
Generally speaking, the initially established field
methodology was to employ the use of both backhoe trenches and hand-excavated test units on
both sites in order to assess the deposits on each. While backhoe trenching was utilized on
both sites, decisions regarding whether the hand-excavation of test units was warranted as well
as their placement were left to the discretion of the field director. This resulted in the excavation
of no test units on site 41TV2263 due to the lack of areas warranting further assessment. Due
to the varying types of investigations, the field methods employed on each site/area are
described separately below.
3.1.1

Site 41TV2263

During the initial survey-level documentation of this site, observed visible cultural
features on the site included 3 burned rock middens aligned in a triangle over a small drainage,
and artifact frequencies appeared to be densest in the area contained within the triangle formed
by the 3 middens (see Figure 4). Areas of the site beyond the middens consisted of exposed
limestone bedrock and shallow rocky soils with no apparent potential to contain buried deposits.
To assess the deposits, 2 extensive backhoe trenches were placed on the site. One trench
(BHT 2263B) extended from the center of the largest midden on the site (BRM-1) across the
southeastern portion of the site into BRM-2. This trench measured 38.0 m by 0.6 m and was
excavated down to the subsurface marl deposits on the site. Generally speaking, the
subsurface marl deposits in BHT 2263B were encountered at depths between 10 and 20 cmbs
with the exception of the portion of this trench in BRM-1 where midden deposits were 1.1 m
thick. The second trench (BHT 2263A) initiated in the center of BRM-3 and extended to the
southeast across the central portion of the site. This trench measured 40.0 m by 0.6 m and was
also excavated down to the subsurface marl deposits which were again encountered between
10 and 20 cmbs. These 2 trenches formed an upside down “T” over the central portion of the
site between the middens. A map of the trenches in relation to the 3 middens is presented in
Figure 6.

During the trenching efforts on site 41TV2263, all excavated matrices were only visually
monitored and trowel/shovel-sorted. No excavated matrices were screened. In the case of the
middens, only burned rock and black midden soil containing generally few other artifacts were
documented within the mechanically excavated matrices and midden profiles. As such, the
excavation of hand-excavated units was assessed as being unwarranted. Similarly, the trench
profiles across the central portion of the site produced evidence of only very shallow soils over
subsurface marl. In this case, the lack of potential for deeply buried deposits also resulted in
the assessment that hand-excavated units were unwarranted. Although hand-excavated units
were not conducted on this site, a soil column was collected from the 1.1 m profile of BHT
2263B in the central portion of BRM-1. This soil column was collected in 10 cm levels (11
levels) from the top of the midden down to bedrock. For each 10 cm level, a 25 x 25 cm area
was excavated. All soil was collected while burned rocks were discarded. The resulting matrix
samples were divided into flotation samples and humate samples, each consisting of the matrix
removed from a 25 x 25 x 10 cm level. Following the trench excavation, the resulting profiles
(both within the midden deposits and across the center of the site) were assessed by the Project
Geomorphologist.
3.1.2

Site 41TV2265 (Upper Midden Area)

Of the 5 burned rock middens documented on this large site during the initial survey
efforts, 3 are located in an upland oak and cedar covered area along the ridge of the peninsula
(see Figure 5). This area was labeled as the Upper Midden area. As areas surrounding these
features generally lacked any potential to contain buried deposits associated with the features
due to the upland, erosional setting and presence of exposed limestone bedrock, the testing
investigations focused on determining the makeup of the middens (kitchen middens or trash
middens), the nature of their formation, and the time periods associated with their formation.
BRM-3 had been heavily impacted by a road cut or borrow activities, so no investigations were
conducted on this feature. Instead, all investigations in the Upper Midden area occurred on the
2 undisturbed middens, BRM-1 and BRM-2.
The first trench, BHT A, was placed across the width of BRM-1 in a generally east/west
direction. It measured 8.0 m in length by 0.6 m in width and was excavated to bedrock or
subsurface marl. Trench B was placed at the west end of BHT A, over the western end of BRM1. This trench measured 10.0 m north/south by 0.6 m in width. BHTs A and B formed a “T”
over BRM-1. The third trench, BHT C, was excavated in an east/west direction over BRM-2,
which was located only a few meters southwest of BRM-1. BHT C measured 15.0 m in length
by 0.6 m in width. It was also excavated down to the shallow bedrock.
Following the trenching efforts, the resulting profiles were assessed and documented
by the Project Geomorphologist. As the profile in BRM-2 revealed only a relatively shallow
midden deposit void of artifacts other than burned rock, hand-excavated units in this midden
were deemed unwarranted. However, the profile of BRM-1 measured approximately 75 cm
thick and appeared to contain diagnostic materials based on a recovered Pedernales dart point
base from the excavated spoil. As such, two 1 x 1-m test units were placed on this midden.
The first test unit, TU A-1, was placed on the north wall of BHT A over the thickest portion of the

HJN 060231 AR

21

Chapter 3.0: Methodology

midden. The second, TU B-1, was placed on the west wall of BHT B over a similarly thick
deposit. Both of these test units were excavated in arbitrary 10-cm levels to a depth of 70 cm.
In all, a total of 1.4 m3 were hand-excavated in the Upper Midden area. Datum elevations,
trench ends, and test unit corners were shot in later with a Total Data Station (TDS). A map of
the investigations over the Upper Midden area is presented in Figure 7.
In addition to the 2 hand-excavated units, soil samples were also collected from the
resulting profiles of these 2 test units. These soil columns were collected in 10-cm levels from
areas measuring 25 x 25 cm square. All soil was collected while burned rocks were discarded.
In all, 7 soil samples were collected from each unit for a total of 14 soil samples in the Upper
Midden area.
3.1.3

Site 41TV2265 (Lower Midden Area)

Two of the 5 documented middens on site 41TV2265 are located on a small peninsula
that is normally submerged within the conservation pool of Lake Travis. This area was labeled
as the Lower Midden area. BRM-4 was observed as a small mound of burned rock on the
surface of the site, while BRM-5 was not as obvious, appearing more as a dense scatter of
cultural debris (a presumed deflated midden resulting from years of inundation). During the
initial survey of this portion of the site, a soil probe or “pokey rod” was placed within the
perceived center of BRM-5 and extended to a depth of 1.5 m without encountering resistance
from bedrock. As the visible surface over the landform consisted entirely of exposed bedrock, it
was surmised that some sort of pit lay below the layer of limestone cobbles, burned rock, and
other cultural debris covering the surface of the site at this location.
To assess the Lower Midden area, the field crew first set out to reestablish the location
of the possible pit via the “pokey rod.” Several areas were probed until the probe extended
again to the depth of 1.5 m. A metal stake was placed in the ground at this location and was
assumed to be the center of the mysterious feature. After this central area had been defined, a
total of 7 backhoe trenches were excavated over the extent of the landform containing the 2
middens. Four of the trenches were placed in the cardinal directions around the central stake,
leaving an approximately 1 x 1-m balk in the center of the trenches (Figure 8). The western
trench, BHT D, measured 4.0 m in length, while the southern trench, BHT E, measured 3.0 m in
length. The eastern trench, BHT F, measured 4.0 m in length, and the northern trench, BHT G,
measured 29.0 m in length. BHT G, the longest of the trenches, extended along the length of
the peninsula from the center BRM-5 to a location just south of BRM-4. A fifth trench, BHT H,
was placed over BRM-4. This trench measured 7.0 m in length and is basically an extension of
BHT G (Figure 8).
After the excavation of these 5 trenches, the Project Geomorphologist assessed the
profiles and determined that this feature consisted of a large basin that was either a natural
swale in the landform or was aboriginally excavated. To determine if it was actually a drainage
swale extending over the landform, 2 additional trenches, BHTs I and J, were excavated
southeast of the feature where slopes suggested such a drainage may lead (Figure 8). These 2
trenches each measured approximately 5.0 m in length.

Volume 2: NRHP Testing Investigations within the Proposed 1060-Acre Vizcaya Development

Following the assessment of the trenches by the Project Geomorphologist, a total of six
1 x 1-m test units were excavated off of the trench walls within the large basin feature. Two test
units, TUs D-1 and D-2 were placed on the south wall of BHT D. Three test units, TUs F-1
through F-3, were placed on the walls of BHT F (TU F-1 on the south wall, and TUs F-2 and F-3
on the north wall). One test unit, TU G-1, was placed on the east wall of BHT G. Again, these
6test units were placed within the basin feature, and served to explore the vertical extent and
nature of the basin deposits (see Figure 8).
During the excavation of the test units within the basin feature, burned rock
concentrations were revealed in the upper elevations of the 2 units (D-1 and D-2) on BHT D. To
chase out the horizontal extent of the concentrations, additional test units were placed to the
south of BHT D. Initially, it was thought that 2 or 3 test units would suffice to expose the extent
of the concentrations. However, as work progressed, a considerable extent of burned rock was
encountered that appeared to comprise a large ring of rock. This ring of rock was thought to
potentially be the remnants of a sizeable aboriginal house on the edge of the basin feature, and,
as such, additional test units were excavated southward in an attempt to expose the extent of
the ring. A total of 15 additional test units (TUs D-3, D-4, D-5, D-6, D-7, D-8, D-9, D-10, D-11,
D-12, D-13, D-16, D-18, D-19, and D-21) were excavated south of BHT 2265D in order to
expose the feature (see Figure 8). As these test units were placed beyond the limits of the
basin feature, all were generally shallow due to the presence of limestone bedrock at shallow
depths below surface. With the 6 test units within the basin feature and 15 test units excavated
to expose the perceived circular alignment of burned rock, a total of 21 test units were handexcavated in the Lower Midden area on site 41TV2265 totaling 6.5 m3 of excavated matrix.
In addition to the excavation of the backhoe trenches and test units, several other field
methods were employed in attempts to provide data relevant to several of the research topics.
The first method consisted of a series of 10 “dog leash” surface scrapes over the surface of the
Lower Midden area to test the hypothesis that high surface artifact densities equate to buried
midden deposits. To accomplish this, 10 points over the lower portion of the site were
delineated. The first consisted of the central stake in the center of the suspected basin feature.
The remaining 9 consisted of a series of 4 points along the eastern north/south alignment of the
peninsula (DL-1 through 4), 4 points along the western north/south alignment of the peninsula
(DL 5 through 8), and 1 (DL-9) in the southern portion of the peninsula (Figure 9). These points
all measured roughly 10 m apart over the extent of the peninsula. Following the delineation of
the points, a 1.0-m length of twine (the “dog leash”) was staked at each point and then used to
scribe a 1.0-m radius around each point, resulting in a 2.0-m diameter circle around each point.
The surface “hash” within each 2.0-m circle, measuring between 2 and 10 cm in depth over
bedrock, was scraped off and then screened. Due to the ubiquitous quantities of debitage over
the deflated surface of the site, it was decided to test the hypothesis based on the quantities of
formally flaked stone tools within each “dog leash” rather than the total amount of all artifacts.
As such, only flaked tools and tool fragments were collected from the 10 “dog leash” areas.
The second field method employed consisted of controlled surface collection over the
Lower Midden area of the site in an attempt to delineate activity areas. To accomplish this, the
excavated backhoe trenches were utilized as lines that divided the Lower Midden area into 4

quadrants (NW, NE, SW, and SE) (Figure 9). Following this delineation of quadrants, each area
was thoroughly surface inspected for exposed tools such as flaked implements, hammer stones,
manos, and metates (lithic debitage, burned rock, and shell were excluded from the inspection).
Exposed tools from within each quadrant were gathered from the deflated surface of the site
and bagged according to the appropriate quadrant designation for later quantification.
Finally, a third method of collection consisted of skimming of the hash zone over the
surface of the BRM-5 pit feature. The hash zone consisted of roughly the upper 10 cm of
deposits that had experienced considerable deflation and sorting via wave action. As this hash
zone over the midden contained a high density of cultural materials, it was seen fit to remove
this layer toward the end of the investigations in order to salvage the artifacts prior to oncoming
inundation as well as future looting of the deposits during low lake level events. The extent of
the midden hash zone was determined based on the outline of the BRM-5 pit revealed in the
trench profiles. Subsequent to the excavation of the trenches, the outline of the pit was painted
on the ground with orange spray paint. During the excavation of the six 1 x 1-m test units within
the pit, the surface hash was collected as Level 1 for each unit. Following the test unit
excavations, the remaining surface hash was divided into 4 quadrants based on the backhoe
trench locations. Then, each quadrant was shovel skimmed, and the skimmed hash was
screened through 0.6-millimeter (mm) hardware mesh. Only lithic tools and tool fragments were
collected from the scraped hash. Mussel shell and debitage were not collected or tabulated.

3.2

GEOARCHEOLOGICAL INVESTIGATIONS

Geoarcheological field assessments consisted of 2 parts: 1) the inspection and
description of backhoe trench exposures, and 2) the assessment of the effects of inundation on
41TV2265.
Documentation of the trenches involved cleaning of 1 or more walls of the trench
exposures by picking with a knife or shaving with a trowel, then subsequently establishing a
string line, and then drawing a long wall profile if there was significant stratigraphic variation
within the trench exposure. The profiles were subsequently described in general accordance
with Schoeneberger et al. (2002), and a photomosaic of each trench was made using a Canon
Powershot G3 digital camera. In some instances the photomosaic was used to augment the
long wall profile prepared in the field.
An evaluation of the effects of inundation on 41TV2265 was made by making
measurements of the apparent soil loss, and by examining the nature of the impoundment
deposits. The soil loss measurements were based on observations of modern cedar trees hat
were present across the frequently inundated part of this site as stumps. On living cedars, the
point where the first roots leave the trunk and enter the soil is nearly always just below the soil
or very slightly above it. This observation was used as the basis for evaluating soil loss on the
site. For each observation, the gravel and sand reservoir sediment armor was scraped away to
reveal the top of the former soil A-horizon, and then the distance between this point and 1 or 2
of the uppermost horizontal roots was measured. If more than 1 was measured, the average
value is the reported number.

HJN 060231 AR

27

Chapter 3.0: Methodology

In addition to this, a single 50 x 50-cm square was cleaned in arbitrary levels within the
excavated backhoe trenches in order to examine the structure of the post-impoundment
sediments that had been deposited across 41TV2265. For each one of these levels, the
sediment was collected and subsequently examined.

3.3

COLLECTION METHODS

All artifacts, including those recovered from screened matrices, trench profiles, backdirt
piles, and surface contexts, were collected in plastic bags of various sizes. Charred botanical
specimens were collected in plastic vials and then placed within a plastic bag. Fragile bone
specimens, if encountered, were to be wrapped with tissue paper and placed within plastic vials
and then placed inside plastic bags. When deemed appropriate, 20 x 20-cm or 50 x 50-cm soil
columns were collected from select test units and midden profiles for flotation. These soils
columns were collected in gallon-sized plastic freezer bags.
Flotation samples were also
collected from encountered feature contexts in the same manner. All burned rock from each
excavated unit level was weighed and discarded on the site. In the case of freshwater mussel
shells, only complete specimens or fragments containing the shell “umbo” were collected in
order to determine the number of mussels processed on the site. Incomplete mussel shell
fragments lacking an umbo were noted on the level forms and discarded. It should be noted
that no Asian clam (Corbicula fluminea) specimens were collected. Asian clams are an
introduced species to Texas waters and were not present during prehistory and, as such, were
discarded and not considered during the investigations.
Every plastic bag containing artifacts or matrices was labeled on the outside with the
pertinent provenience information, date, content, and collector. Every bag received a unique
Field Sack (FS) number that was labeled on the bag itself and recorded in an FS log.
Location data was collected via a Total Data Station (TDS). The TDS data was collected
based on an arbitrary datum on the peninsula containing the lower middens of site 41TV2265
that was assigned the coordinates N 1000 E 1000.
Photographic data was collected via digital cameras. Collected images included general
views of the sites, views of the various aspects of the field effort, views of the base of each
excavated unit level (if in situ materials were present), views of trench profiles, and broader
views of horizontal exposures resulting from block excavations.

3.4

RECORDING METHODS

Following the excavation of each backhoe trench, the Project Geomorphologist
assessed each trench profile. This included a detailed description of the profile, followed by a
sketch map and 1 or more digital photographs of the profile. When significant lateral variation
was present within the trench, 2 additional forms of recording were employed: 1) a series of
overlapping digital photographs were subsequently digitally “stitched” together to form a
composite image or mosaic of the assessed length of each profile; and 2) a string line was

28

060231_arch_testing_report

Volume 2: NRHP Testing Investigations within the Proposed 1060-Acre Vizcaya Development

established, and the profile strata were recorded. Following the fieldwork these 2 forms of
recording were merged into a single profile line drawing.
Following the completion of each unit level within the excavated test units, standard unitlevel excavation forms were completed. These forms contained provenience data, recorder
name and date, photograph numbers, burned rock count and weight, collected materials and FS
numbers, soil descriptions, notes and observations, and a sketch map of the unit level. Each
unit level was also photographed with a digital camera.
The field director kept a daily log of all activities at the sites and maintained appropriate
field notes regarding the investigations. The field director also maintained an FS log, updating it
with the issuance of each new FS number. Similarly, a photo-log of all digital photographs was
maintained throughout the field work, as was a TDS log of all collected TDS data.

3.5

LABORATORY METHODS

Following the field investigations, all collected artifacts and matrices were transported to
Horizon’s lab for processing. All artifacts were washed, sorted, and labeled according to their
provenience. Materials from each distinct provenience were assigned unique catalog numbers.
Unique items such as lithic tools, tool fragments, groundstone specimens, and charcoal
samples were further assigned a unique specimen number in addition to the catalog number.
Bulk materials such as lithic debitage and mussel shells were not assigned unique specimen
numbers. After the recovered materials were catalogued, the data were input into a Microsoft
Access spreadsheet to aid in analysis.
The recovered lithic tools were rudimentally assigned to known types and styles by the
lab staff. These lithic tools were then analyzed by Russ Brownlow of Horizon, and the styles,
types, and descriptions were revised as necessary.
Recovered debitage was only counted and weighed. As the research questions for the
project had no need for a breakdown of the debitage into typical categories (i.e., primary,
secondary, and tertiary flakes, corticate/decorticate chips, angular chunks, etc.), no in-depth
breakdown and analysis of the debitage was conducted.
All recovered mussel shells were counted and weighed. As the recovered mussel shells
consisted only of 2 obvious species, Amblema plicata (Threeridge) and Tritogonia verrucosa
(Pistolgrip), with the vast majority being Amblema plicata, no samples were sent off for species
identification.
Flotation samples were processed at Horizon’s office using a manual flotation system
(Pearsall 2000:29-41). Soil was gently agitated in a tub, and materials that rose to the surface
were skimmed from the surface in fine-meshed nets. For site 41TV2263, a total of 22 soil
samples were floated. These included the original 11 flotation samples extracted from BRM-1
as well as the remainder of the 11 humate samples from the same midden once the requisite
amount of soil was removed for humate dating. For the Upper Midden area of site 41TV2265,

HJN 060231 AR

29

Chapter 3.0: Methodology

a total of 13 soil samples were floated (6 from TU A-1 and 7 from TU B-1). For the Lower
Midden area of site 41TV2265, a single sample from BRM-5 was floated. The resulting light
fractions were then analyzed by Dr. Leslie Bush in the Macrobotanical Analysis laboratory in
Manchaca, Texas. Due to rising lake waters, time did not allow for the extraction of additional
soil samples from the Lower Midden area of site 41TV2265 aside from the single sample noted
above.
Each flotation sample was weighed on an electronic balance with a sensitivity of 0.01
grams (g) before being size-sorted through a stack of geologic mesh with openings of 2 mm, 1.4
mm, and 0.71 mm. The division into size fractions facilitated microscopic examination by
allowing more consistent lens focus for each tray of material examined. Material was examined
carefully under a stereoscopic microscope at 7-30 X magnification for carbonized botanical
remains of any size. For the current sites, this material consisted only of wood charcoal.
Materials other than carbonized plant remains in the > 2 mm size fraction were weighed,
recorded, and labeled, but not counted. In the > 2 mm size fraction, this material is referred to
as “contamination.” Materials that fell through the 2-mm mesh are referred to as “residue.” The
presence of plant taxa that were not carbonized was recorded on laboratory forms, but these
materials were not removed from contamination or residue.
Wood charcoal identification was attempted for all fragments recovered from the
samples. Fragments were snapped to reveal a clean section and examined under a
stereoscopic microscope at 45 X magnification. Wood fragments and uncarbonized plants were
identified to the lowest possible taxonomic level by comparison to materials in the
Macrobotanical Analysis comparative collection and through the use of standard reference
works (Davis 1993; Hoadley 1990; Martin and Barkley 1961; Musil 1963; Panshin and de Zeeuw
1980).
Although charred remains within the samples were sparse to non-existent, Dr. Bush did
thoroughly assess 4 of the samples under a microscope to determine if smaller particles were
present. After poor results from these 4 samples, Dr. Bush abandoned the assessment due to
the unproductive nature of the initial 4 samples.
A total of 9 samples were submitted to Beta Analytical for accelerator mass
spectrometer (AMS) and/or radiocarbon dating. These included 3 land snails, 4 humate
samples, and 2 charcoal samples. The resulting assays were calibrated (2 Sigma) using the
INTCAL 98 calibration database. In addition, the resulting assays on the land snails were
further calibrated as per Ellis (2003). Beta Analytical’s report is presented in Appendix A.

4.0 RESULTS OF THE NRHP TESTING INVESTIGATIONS

This chapter presents the results of Horizon’s NRHP eligibility testing investigations
within the proposed Vizcaya development. The results from site 41TV2263 and the Upper and
Lower Midden areas on site 41TV2265 are presented separately below.

4.1

SITE 41TV2263

4.1.1

Description

Site 41TV2263 was originally documented as an aboriginal campsite located on the
western end of a small peninsula that extends easterly into Lake Travis. In prehistory, this
location would have consisted of the ridgeline of a hill located west of the Colorado River.
During the survey of the property, this site was originally documented as a generally small area
encompassed by 3 burned rock middens (BRMs 1 to 3) that formed a triangle straddling a small
drainage that drained the area to the northeast (see Figure 4). As this site is situated in an
upland setting, shallow soils and exposed limestone bedrock were prominent over the entire
landform. An intensive surface inspection revealed a general absence of surficial materials over
the landform with the exception of the area contained within the triangular area formed by the 3
burned rock middens. In this area, artifacts quantities were also generally sparse, consisting of
several sandstone mano fragments, a few chert cores, and a minimal amount of lithic debitage.
General photographs of the site and the 3 burned rock middens are presented in Figures 10
though 13.
As the area beyond the middens consisted primarily of shallow soils or exposed
bedrock, the NRHP eligibility testing efforts on this site were focused on the 3 burned rock
middens and the area contained between them. A total of 2 extensive backhoe trenches were
excavated over the site. The first, BHT 2263B, was initiated just north of the center of BRM-1
and extended northward across the site into BRM-2. The second trench, BHT 2263A, was
excavated near the center of BRM-3 and extended to the southeast where it connected with
BHT 2263B. These 2 trenches formed a “T” over the site, exposing both internal midden
composition as well as profile views across the central portion of the site (Figure 13.1; see also
Figure 6). Photographs of the trenching efforts are presented in Figures 14 though 16.

As can be seen in Figures 14 though 16, subsurface marl deposits were encountered at
generally shallow depths within the excavated trenches. Because of this, hand-excavated test
units were deemed to be unwarranted within the central area of the site between the middens.
Regarding the middens, BRM-1 was found to consist almost solely of spent burned rock and
black midden soils. Artifacts within the midden matrix were considerably sparse, consisting only
of the occasional chert flake. BRMs 2 and 3 were found to be shallow sheet middens with little
depth. Like BRM-1, both BRMs 2 and 3 also consisted almost solely of spent burned rock and
black soil with few associated artifacts. As such, hand-excavated test units within the midden
deposits were also determined to be unwarranted, limiting the investigations on site 41TV2263
to only backhoe trenching and geomorphological documentation.
4.1.2

Burned Rock Middens

Of the 3 burned rock middens on site 41TV2263, BRM-1 can be described as a domed
midden (Black et al. 1997) comparable to Weir’s (1976) Type I midden (see Figures 11 and 16).
It measured roughly 20.0 m in diameter and 1.1 m thick at the center. The backhoe trenching
efforts within this midden revealed a composition of dense amounts of burned rock and black
soil. Observed lithic artifacts within the excavated matrix were almost non-existent, consisting
only of 1 biface. However, numerous freshwater mussel shell fragments were noted. A review
of the midden profile (Figure 17) revealed no obvious internal pit features, suggesting that BRM1 consists more of a jumbled mound of fractured and angular burned rock (domed midden)
rather than an annular midden with a central basin feature (Black et al. 1997) that would

Chapter 4.0: Results of the NRHP Testing Investigations

correspond with Weir’s (1976) Type II midden. However, due to dense tree growth, trenching
within the center of the midden was not possible and the presence of a central pit feature cannot
be ruled out. If such a central pit is present, this would obviously place BRM-1 into the annular
midden (Type II) category. This distinction may be a moot point since Black et al. (1997)
hypothesize that domed middens (Type I) are actually annular middens (Type II) that are not
recognizable as such due to erosion and disturbance. In his differentiation, Weir (1976) notes
that Type I (domed) middens commonly include bone, shell, and faunal debris but are generally
lacking in charred plant remains, while Type II (annular) middens do contain charred plant food
but are barren of diagnostic artifacts. In the case of BRM-1 on site 41TV2263, mussel shell was
relatively common and charred plant food remains (e.g., charred bulb fragments) were not
observed within the flotation samples taken from the soil column within the central portion of this
midden (suggestive of a Type I or domed midden), but the deposits were barren of diagnostic
implements (suggestive of a Type II or annular midden). This lends credence to Black et al.’s
(1997) hypothesis that domed middens developed from eroded/disturbed annular middens.
Generally speaking, the presence of mussel shell (food stuffs) within the midden coupled with
the overall lack of domestic detritus suggests that BRM-1 formed as a result of the use of the
location as a communal oven that was kept free of trash rather than from use as a domestic
refuse heap associated with an intensive occupation of the area.
BRM-2 and BRM-3 on site 41TV2263 were both found to consist of thin lenses of burned
rock that had accreted on 2 different slopes on the site. BRM-2 is located on the northern
boundary of the site where it begins to dip down toward the drainage leading to Lake Travis
(see Figures 12 and 15). It measured approximately 20.0 m in diameter with a thickness of
roughly 10.0 cm. BRM-3 is situated on the northwestern boundary of the site on a slope that
dips southeasterly toward the drainage (see Figures 13 and 14). This smaller midden
measured roughly 12.0 m in diameter with a thickness of 20.0 cm. Like BRM-1, both BRM-2
and BRM-3 were also found to consist almost solely of burned rock and black soil with few other
associated artifacts. The thin nature of each characterizes them as sheet middens (Black et al.
1997), comparable to Weir’s (1976) Type IV midden. Both appear to be incipient burned rock
middens with no visible evidence of internal baking pits. Their locations on the site’s slopes
suggest they likely resulted from dumping episodes of spent cooking rock at these sloping
locations rather than the use of each area as a baking locale. As with BRM-1, the absence of
domestic debris in each suggests that the dumping episodes were associated with the use of a
nearby communal oven rather than general trash dumps.
4.1.3

Geomorphological Observations

Site 41TV2263 is situated in a predominantly upland landscape around the head of a
low-order drainage. This channel-less water gathering slope has a relatively steep gradient
through the site where it traverses a hard limestone ledge that forms a low bluff immediately
east of BRM-2 and BRM-3. BRM-1 is constructed upon this ledge. The scarp formed by this
ledge appears to have experienced some spring sapping in the past and it may have served as
a water source in the distant past.

38

Volume 2: NRHP Testing Investigations within the Proposed 1060-Acre Vizcaya Development

The presence of flotsam considerably upslope of BRM-1 clearly demonstrates that this
entire site has been submerged by Lake Travis at some time in the past, but it is apparent that
most of the time Lake Travis has remained below the level of BRM-1. The other 2 features
appear to have been adversely affected by the fluctuating water levels of Lake Travis, with
BRM-3 having suffered the greatest damage.
As previously noted, the low-order drainage separating BRM-1 from BRM-3 was the only
portion of this site that appeared to have any significant geological deposition. It was for this
reason that BHT 2263A was excavated. This trench revealed the presence of at least 2
different age bodies of alluvium. Unconformably resting upon bedrock was a brown gravelly
clay that appears to be a Early to Middle Holocene alluvial deposit that is presumably correlative
with the Fort Hood Alluvium identified by Nordt (1992) (Table 1; Figure 18). A significant
amount of burned rock was scattered across the top of this deposit (Zone 3) and this may have
been deposited upon the top of this deposit after it had been truncated by erosion, presumably
in the Middle Holocene. Another alluvial deposit, presumed to be of Middle to Late Holocene
age is represented by Zones 1 and 2, with Zone 2 probably dating to the period between 3000
BC and about AD 1000, and Zone 1 most likely representing the last millennium. The
concentration of burned rock within this trench near the interface, between Zones 1 and 2, is
most likely related to prehistoric activity in the Late Archaic or early part of the Late Prehistoric
periods.
The southwestern end of Trench BHT 2263B started almost halfway through northeast
side of BRM-1, and was extended downslope to BRM-3. The section of this trench that
exposed BRM-1 was drawn and described (Table 1; Figure 19). The midden appears to have
been constructed upon an A-R soil profile with none of the rubified clayey soil visible in the
Early-Middle Holocene alluvial deposits in the adjacent drainage present beneath the feature.
The absence of a red clay soil beneath the midden would support a late Holocene age for its
construction, assuming that the general soil erosion chronology identified by Toomey (1993)
and Cooke (2005; Cooke et al. 2003) from Hall’s cave is applicable to this area. The Late
Pleistocene and Holocene sediments that were deposited in Hall's cave were strong brown red
in the late Pleistocene and gradually changed color to brown and then black by the Middle
Holocene, which, in conjunction with the changes in the vertebrate fauna, led Toomey to
speculate that this sequence of deposits reflected progressive soil erosion throughout this
period, and the emergence of the present-day thin stony soils by the middle Holocene. Cooke
(2005; Cooke et al. 2003) tested Toomey's hypothesis of progressive soil erosion by examining
the Strontium isotopes within hackberry seeds and the bones of fossorial rodents that were
collected from the stratified deposits within Hall's cave by Toomey. This work supported
Toomey's hypothesis, and Cooke was able to calculate an estimated soil loss for the period
between 15,000 and 5,000 years BP.
The fact that there are rubified alluvial sediments in the small drainage immediately
adjacent to the midden at this site suggests that red soils were present on the site in the Early
Holocene and were being stripped at that time. The absence of such soils beneath the midden
would, if the chronology identified at Hall's cave applies to this region, suggests that the midden

was constructed sometime after 5,000 years BP. This conclusion is consistent with the
radiocarbon dates obtained from the feature (see below).
Inspection of Figure 19 also reveals that the natural topsoil or A-horizon appears to have
been stripped from near the center of the feature (north end of the trench) where the burnt rock
midden rests directly upon bedrock. This may have been due to excavation near the center of
the feature associated with its use. Unfortunately, owing to the dense tree growth on the site, it
was not possible to trench completely through this midden, and the presence of a central
feature is unknown.
4.1.4

Lithic Tools

Although 3 burned rock middens were present on the site, suggestive of a relatively
intense usage of the area, only 15 lithic tools were recovered during the investigations, all from
surface contexts and from within the mechanically excavated spoil. These 15 lithic tools consist
of 4 bifaces/biface fragments, 4 sandstone mano/mano fragments, 2 metate fragments, 3
hammer stones, 1 nutting stone, and 1 polished stone. A representative photograph of select
artifacts from 41TV2263 is provided in Figure 20. The types of recovered lithic tools, coupled
with the 3 burned rock middens that appear to represent the remnants of communal ovens or
“kitchen” middens, suggest that the primary activities at site 41TV2263 consisted of the
preparation of foodstuffs with an emphasis on plant baking. The 4 mano/mano fragments, 2
metate fragments, and the nutting stone all reflect plant milling activities. The 4 bifacial
specimens could represent items used in the processing of meat resources as well as for the
preparation of plant materials, while the 3 hammer stones can be viewed as implements used in
the reduction/sharpening of the bifaces or as the cracking implement utilized in concert with the
nutting stone. The polished stone appears to be a flat, oblong fine-grained quartize cobble
whose exterior has been rubbed to a smooth polish. Its function is currently undetermined
although it could have acquired the polished areas as a result of its use as a grinding implement
akin to the sandstone mano specimens. Again, all these specimens appear to reflect activities
related to food processing, suggesting that the site potentially functioned as a communal
“kitchen” rather than a domestic living area.
4.1.5

Debitage

No hand-excavated units were placed on this site due to the shallow nature of the soils
as well as the fact that the midden deposits were generally devoid of artifacts. In addition, as
indicated in the Methodology, excavated backhoe trench matrices were only shovel/trowelsorted and were not screened. As such, no debitage was collected for quantification. However,
it can be stated that visible debitage amounts on the surface of the site and within the
mechanically excavated spoil were considerably low, amounting to approximately less than 20
specimens. The general absence of debitage at this site suggests that lithic reduction activities
at this location were minimal, further supporting the observation that this site potentially
functioned as a clean “kitchen” rather than an encampment.

4.1.6

Faunal Remains

As no test unit excavation was undertaken on site 41TV2263, no faunal remains were
recovered. However, freshwater mussel shells were observed within the midden spoil during
backhoe trenching efforts. No preserved bone material was documented.
4.1.7

Macrobotanical Remains

A total of 11 column samples were taken from the central portion of BRM-1 during the
investigations (1 from each 10-cm level within the center of the midden at the southeastern end
of BHT 2263B; see Figure 17). After flotation, the 11 resulting light fractions were analyzed by
Dr. Leslie Bush. After a visual examination of the samples, it was determined that charred
macrobotanical remains were generally absent in the samples. However, Dr. Bush did
thoroughly analyze the light fraction from the 30 to 40 centimeters below surface (cmbs) level
within the midden (Table 1.1). During this analysis, 1 carbonized wood fragment was
recovered. This recovered fragment measured less than 1 mm in diameter. When snapped, the
fragment exhibited parenchymous tissue and a medium-small vessel. It was recorded as a
hardwood, but more specific identification was not possible on such a small fragment. Due to
the unproductive nature of this sample, analysis of additional samples from the midden was
abandoned as further analysis was deemed unlikely to yield significant information.
As the solitary carbonized fragment from BRM-1 was assessed as a hardwood, it
undoubtedly represents the remains of the fuel used to fire the earth oven(s) that ultimately
resulted in the formation of BRM-1 rather than the foodstuffs that were baked within the oven(s).
Based on the general absence of preserved, carbonized materials within the midden deposits, it
seems unlikely that the deposits are capable of yielding data pertaining to the plant resources
exploited for food at the site and that the site as a whole can be characterized as lacking in
preserved floral remains.
4.1.8

Radiocarbon Assays

Two humate samples from site 41TV2263 were submitted to Beta Analytical for dating.
The first humate sample was taken from Level 2 (10 to 20 cmbs) of the larger and thicker
midden (BRM-1) on the site. The second humate sample was taken from Level 11 (100 to 110
cmbs) of the same midden. These 2 samples were selected for radiocarbon assaying in an
attempt to determine the temporal periods associated with use of the midden. Obviously, the
lower sample was meant to determine the earliest usage of the midden, while the upper sample
was to determine the latter usage of the midden.
The lower sample (Beta-229550) resulted in a conventional radiocarbon age of 2650+60
BP or a 2 Sigma calibrated age range of 910 to 760 BC, while the upper sample (Beta-229549)
resulted in a conventional radiocarbon age of 930+60 BP or a 2 Sigma calibrated age range of
AD 1000 to 1230 (Appendix A). These 2 age ranges indicate an initial accretion of the midden
deposits during the Late Archaic I (Johnson 1995) period and a later usage of the midden during
the Austin phase of the Late Prehistoric period. As only 2 samples were submitted for dating, it
is unclear if the midden experienced gradual accretion over the roughly 2100-year time span
indicated by the assays or if the midden is more of a Late Archaic feature that was later

scavenged in by Austin phase groups that frequented the area. Based on previous research
including Black et al. (1997) and Brownlow (2004), Austin phase groups seem to have had a
penchant for rummaging around in earlier middens for lithic materials as well as using the
middens themselves for baking areas. As such, the later Austin phase date within the upper
levels of BRM-1 likely reflects some form of midden scavenging as opposed to a continued
accretion of burned rock from off-midden baking pits.
4.1.9

Summary

Although site 41TV2263 was originally recorded as an aboriginal open campsite, the
recovered data from the NRHP testing investigations on the site suggest that the site likely
functioned as more of a specialized activity area where food processing and baking occurred
rather than an area utilized as an encampment. This is supported by the presence of 3 burned
rock middens with few associated artifacts. The 3 middens are all composed almost solely of
burned rock and black midden soil with no observed artifacts suggestive of the use of the ovens
as general domestic refuse heaps, and the few artifacts recovered from the area between the 3
middens all appear to reflect plant processing activities. If the site had functioned as an
encampment or living area, one would expect to find a considerable amount of associated
domestic refuse within the deposits. However, this was not the case, and, in fact, associated
artifacts were generally sparse. As the 3 middens are composed of copious amounts of spent
cooking rock that could only have resulted from numerous extended and repeated baking
episodes, it is clear that the area was utilized rather intensively at periods during prehistory.
Due to the lack of general domestic refuse on the site, the documented features and artifacts all
point to the use of the location as a communal oven or “kitchen” that was possibly located in an
area away from the actual living area where the site occupants camped. The positioning of a
“kitchen” area away from the living area would serve 2 purposes. First, it would serve to keep
the kitchen and the foodstuffs being prepared free from undesirable refuse such as lithic
reduction debris that would be more prominent at the encampment. Second, as communal
ovens often served to cook certain plant foods over an extended period of time in order to
convert starches into digestible sugars, it is quite probable that the ovens also produced a
considerable amount of smoke and soot during the baking process. As such, positioning the
kitchen away from the living area would keep the living area free of smoke and keep the food
relatively free of undesired bits of refuse. As for the location of the presumed separate living
area associated with the midden area, this remains to be determined. No occupational
evidence was observed on the upland ridge where the 3 middens are located. However, as will
be discussed later in the text pertaining to the Upper and Lower Midden areas of nearby site
41TV2265, such a living area is hypothesized to be located downslope to the east, closer to the
channel of the Colorado River in an area that now lies beneath the waters of Lake Travis.
While no temporally diagnostic artifacts were recovered from this site during the initial
survey or the current testing investigations, the geomorphological investigations on the site
suggest that cultural materials began accreting on the site during the Middle Holocene and
continued into the Late Holocene, presumably between 3000 BC and AD 1000. Two
radiocarbon assays produced from humate samples taken from BRM-1 support the
geomorphological assessment, reflecting an initial accretion of BRM-1 between 910 and 760 BC

Chapter 4.0: Results of the NRHP Testing Investigations

[2 Sigma calibration] and a later use of the midden between AD 1000 and 1230 [2 Sigma
calibration]. These dates reflect a usage of the site during Johnson’s (1995) Late Archaic I
period as well as a later Austin phase utilization of the site during the Late Prehistoric period.
As indicated earlier, the Austin phase presence at the site may reflect midden scavenging rather
than continued midden accretion.
Unfortunately, while associated artifacts were generally sparse on this site, preserved
floral and faunal remains were even sparser. The only preserved faunal remains observed
consisted of freshwater mussel shells within the midden deposits. This suggests that freshwater
mussels comprised at least a portion of the aboriginal diet at this site, although undoubtedly a
variety of other animals were consumed. As far as processed plant resources, no preserved
materials were recovered aside from 1 small fragment of charred hardwood from within BRM-1.
This solitary specimen undoubtedly represents wood used as fuel within the ovens that resulted
in the midden accumulations rather than food. Although no other preserved plant remains were
recovered, it is assumed that the middens likely developed, at least in part, as a result of the
extended baking of geophytic plants such as camas bulbs, yucca/sotol bulbs, or other starchy
roots. With the dismal state of preservation at this site, only assumptions can be made
regarding the prepared foodstuffs aside from indication that freshwater mussels comprised a
portion of the diet.

4.2

SITE 41TV2265 (UPPER MIDDEN AREA)

4.2.1

Description

Site 41TV2265 was originally recorded as an extensive aboriginal campsite covering an
area both above and below the conservation pool of Lake Travis (see Figure 5). The portion of
the site above the conservation pool was labeled as the Upper Midden area. This location
consists of the ridgeline of a hill located north of Bee Creek and west of the Colorado River
where a total of 3 burned rock middens (BRMs 1 to 3) were documented during the earlier
assessments of the site. BRM-1 and BRM-2 are situated in relative proximity to one another
within the central portion of the Upper Midden area, while BRM-3 is located a short distance to
the southwest (see Figure 5). As this area of the site consists entirely of an upland ridgeline,
shallow soils and limestone bedrock exposures were prolific across the site, providing no areas
with the potential for deeply buried deposits. However, at least 2 of the middens (BRM-1 and
BRM-2) were features on the landform with obvious potential to contain cultural deposits.
To assess whether the Upper Midden area was a contributing element to the overall
NRHP eligibility status of site 41TV2265, the investigations in this area focused entirely on
BRM-1 and BRM-2, as these were the only features within the Upper Midden area capable
possessing intact, stratified deposits. Three backhoe trenches (BHTs A, B, and C) were
excavated over these 2 middens, and two 1 x 1-m test units (TUs A-1 and B-1) were handexcavated off the resulting trench profiles within BRM-1 (Figure 20.1; see also Figure 7). Due to
the shallow nature of BRM-2, no test units were excavated within this midden. Photographs of
the activities conducted within the Upper Midden area are presented in Figures 21 though 24.

4.2.2

Burned Rock Middens

Much like BRM-1 on site 41TV2263, BRM-1 on site 41TV2265 can also be described as
a domed or Type I midden (Black et al. 1997; Weir 1976) (Figures 21 through 24). This midden
measured roughly 12.0 m in diameter and 0.7 m thick at the center. The backhoe trenching
efforts within this midden (BHTs 2265A and 2265B) revealed a composition of dense amounts
of burned rock and black soil with few observed artifacts. A thorough assessment of the
mechanically excavated spoil produced only 1 Pedernales point fragment, 1 blade or lame’, and
several specimens of freshwater mussel shell. Other visible artifacts were generally lacking. A
review of the midden profile revealed no obvious internal pit features, suggesting that BRM-1
consists more of a jumbled mound of spent cooking rock rather than an annular midden that
formed around a central oven.
To further assess this midden, 2 test units (TU A-1 and TU B-1) were excavated off of
the resulting trench profiles. The recovered materials from the test pits are broken down and
described further in the following sections, although they can be summarized as generally
sparse. Lithic tools from both test units were few with only 1 additional Pedernales point, 1 Darl
point, and 4 biface fragments recovered for the 2 test units. Lithic debitage was also relatively
sparse with fewer than 200 specimens collected from each 0.7 m deep test unit. Freshwater
mussel shell was by far the most prolific artifact type encountered within the midden deposits.
Recalling that only umbos were collected, these amounted to a total of 1476.7 grams from the 2
test units. The presence of foodstuffs (mussels) and the generally low numbers of other
domestic debris within the midden matrices suggest that BRM-1 formed as a result of the use of
the location as a communal oven that was kept free of trash rather than from use as a domestic
refuse heap similar to BRM-1 on nearby site 41TV2263.
BRM-2 within the Upper Midden area of site 41TV2265 is located immediately southwest
of BRM-1 (Figure 25). It was evidenced by a slight rise in grass-covered topography. During
the trenching of BRM-1, it was decided to place another trench (BHT C) over the rise to
determine if it also represented a burned rock midden. This trench immediately produced dense
amounts of burned rock and black midden soil also lacking in visible amounts of other artifact
types, similar to the deposits of BRM-1. Although no definite horizontal termination of burned
rock was documented within the trench profile, this midden is assumed to measure 8.0 to 10.0
m in diameter based of visible topography and 0.4 m thick based on the trench profile. While
this area was labeled as BRM-2, its immediate proximity to BRM-1 may suggest more of an
increased horizontal extent of BRM-1 rather than 2 separate middens. Due to the general lack
of cultural materials within the matrix in BHT C as well as the shallow nature of the deposits, no
hand-excavated test units were placed within BRM-2 as it was assumed that these would
produce results similar to those in TUs A-1 and B-1. The absence of cultural materials other
than mussel shell within the excavated midden spoil again suggests that the deposits
accumulated as a result of a communal oven that was kept free of debris.

Later in the investigations, BRM-3 was observed about 50.0 m southwest of BRMs 1 and
2. This smaller midden, measuring approximately 3.0 to 4.0 m in diameter, was found during
the examination of an earlier dozer scrape on the landform. It consisted of a thick scatter (sheet
midden) of burned rock and chert flaking debris over a small rise. Increased amounts of lithic
debitage were observed within the dozer scrape and over the surrounding area. Due to the
shallow nature of this midden, as well as time constraints, no formal investigations were
conducted in this area. However, the amounts of visible lithic debitage within the matrix of this
midden suggests that it potentially accreted as a refuse heap as opposed to use as a communal
oven. Its presence away from BRM-1 and BRM-2, which are assumed to represent a
communal baking area, may represent an actual living area where the occupants of the site
camped away from the “clean” kitchen.
4.2.3

Geomorphological Observations

The Upper Midden area is situated on a convex upland landform that has clearly been a
dominantly erosional landform for much of the Holocene. No geomorphological work was done
in association with these features, but inspection of the trench profiles revealed that, like
41TV2263, the middens in this area were constructed directly upon bedrock. There was no
trace of a red clay soil beneath them, which suggests that they may have been constructed in or
after the Late Archaic period.

Lithic Tools

As noted previously in the description of BRM-1, recovered tools from the midden matrix
were relatively few. During the initial trench excavation, 1 Pedernales dart point and 1 chert
blade or lame’ were recovered from the excavated spoil. The test unit excavation produced an
additional Pedernales dart point specimen, a Darl dart point, 4 biface fragments, and 1 ochre
specimen. Table 2 presents the stratigraphic levels of the recovered specimens, while Figure
26 presents a photograph of select specimens.
Regarding the dart points, the Darl specimen suggests a probable Late Archaic II
(Johnson and Goode 1994; Johnson 1995) association with a potential age range of 600 BC to
AD 600 for the midden deposits. The 2 Pedernales dart point fragments also suggest a Late
Archaic I (Johnson and Goode 1994; Johnson 1995) association with an anticipated age range
of 2300 to 600 BC (Johnson and Goode 1994; Johnson 1995). The stratigraphic relationship of
the specimens recovered during test unit excavation (see Table 2) appears to reflect some
degree of stratigraphic integrity within the midden, with the earlier Pedernales specimen being
recovered from near the base of the midden and the later Darl specimen coming from contexts
higher within the midden.

As can be seen in Figure 26, the 2 Pedernales specimens exhibit central snap/bend
breaks as opposed to impact fractures. This type of fracture suggests that the recovered
specimens may have served as knives during food processing rather than projectiles used to
take down the food. In addition, the larger of the 2 Pedernales specimens appears to retain an
area of edge attrition along one of its lateral edges that may further reflect the usage of this tool
as a cutting implement. As BRM-1 appears to reflect more of a communal oven area or
“kitchen” void of domestic refuse, these 2 specimens could conceivably have been used as
knives during plant processing activities. The blade/lame’ specimen recovered from the
excavated matrix spoil also exhibits evidence of edge attrition along its concave lateral edge,
appearing to also reflect possible plant processing activities.

4.2.5

Debitage

The recovered debitage counts and weights from the 2 test units within BRM-1 are
presented in Table 3. As can be seen in the table, overall debitage densities within the columns
excavated within the midden are generally low and increase towards the upper extents of the
midden. This generally low amount of debitage could be viewed as evidence that the midden
originally resulted from use of the area as a communal oven or kitchen where intensive lithic
reduction activities were avoided in order to ensure that these materials did not become
incorporated into the prepared foods. The actual debitage specimens within the midden may
reflect the refurbishing and resharpening of lithic tools utilized during food processing activities.
The observed increase in debitage counts and weights as one moves upward through the
midden deposits could also reflect a change in its use later in time. As will be discussed later in
the text of this section, the radiocarbon assay produced from the upper extent of this midden
reflects an Austin phase presence on the midden. The increased debitage counts and weights
within the upper 2 levels of this midden could reflect later Austin phase scavenging within or
reutilization of the midden deposits that could have been accreting as early as the Late Archaic I
period based on the recovered Pedernales points.

Faunal Remains

During the testing investigations within the Upper Midden area of site 41TV2265,
recovered faunal materials consisted solely of freshwater mussel shells. This would suggest
that either preservation is essentially non-existent within the midden deposits or that 1 of the
activities associated with the midden accumulations was the baking of freshwater mussels. As
can be seen in Table 4, the umbos from freshwater mussels were recovered from almost every
level of BRM-1 with the exception of Level 1 in TU B-1. However, there does not appear to be
an observable increase or decrease in densities with depth as concentrations of mussel shell
seem to be scattered at various levels within the midden. These varying densities of mussel

56

060231_arch_testing_report

Volume 2: NRHP Testing Investigations within the Proposed 1060-Acre Vizcaya Development

shell amounts likely reflect distinct and repeated episodes of mussel baking wherein certain
occasions witnessed increased amounts of processed mussel while others witnessed lesser
amounts, thereby accounting for the varying frequencies.

Macrobotanical Remains

A total of 13 column samples were recovered from BRM-1 on site 41TV2265 during the
investigations. Six of these samples were recovered from each of the 10 cm levels in TU A-1,
and 7 were recovered from each 10 cm level in TU B-1. As with the samples from 41TV2263,
the 13 resulting light fractions were first visually examined after which it was determined that
charred macrobotanical remains were again generally absent in the samples. However, Dr.
Bush did thoroughly analyze the light fraction from the 20 to 30 cmbs level in TU A-1 and the
30-40 cmbs level in TU B-1 (Table 4.1). Her analysis of these 2 samples under the microscope
failed to document any carbonized fragments. Due to the unproductive nature of these 2
samples, analysis of additional samples from the midden was abandoned as further analysis
was deemed unlikely to yield significant information. Based on the lack of recovered carbonized
remains from the 2 samples, it can be concluded that the Upper Midden area of site 41TV2265
is generally lacking in preserved floral remains.
4.2.8

Radiocarbon Assays

Two humate samples from BRM-1 in the Upper Midden area of site 41TV2265 were
submitted to Beta Analytical for dating. The first humate sample was taken from Level 2 (10 to
20 cmbs) of TU A-1 in the center of this midden, and the second humate sample was taken from
Level 6 (50 to 60 cmbs), the base of the midden within the same test unit. These 2 samples
were selected for radiocarbon assaying in an attempt to further define the temporal periods
associated with use of this midden.

Volume 2: NRHP Testing Investigations within the Proposed 1060-Acre Vizcaya Development

As reported in Volume 1, a Darl dart point was recovered from nearby surface contexts
during the initial survey of the site, while a second Darl specimen was recovered from the
midden contexts during the testing investigations. These specimens suggest a probable Late
Archaic II (Johnson and Goode 1994; Johnson 1995) association with a potential age range of
600 BC to AD 600 for the midden deposits. In addition, one will recall that 2 Pedernales dart
point fragments were recovered during the testing investigations within BRM-1, also suggesting
a Late Archaic I (Johnson and Goode 1994; Johnson 1995) association with another anticipated
age range of 2300 to 600 BC (Johnson and Goode 1994; Johnson 1995).
The lower humate sample (Beta-229552) resulted in a conventional radiocarbon age of
1670+50 BP or 2 Sigma calibrated age ranges of AD 250 to 450, AD 450 to 460, and AD 480 to
530 or essentially AD 250 to 530 (Appendix A). The upper sample (Beta-229551) resulted in a
conventional radiocarbon age of 1200+40 BP or 2 Sigma calibrated age ranges of AD 690 to
900 and AD 920 to 950 or essentially AD 690 to 950 (Appendix A). These 2 age ranges
indicate an accretion of the midden deposits during the Johnson’s (1995) Late Archaic II period
in agreement with the associated Darl points and a later usage of the midden during the Austin
phase of the Late Prehistoric period, both of which are later than the Late Archaic I association
suggested by the 2 Pedernales points.
The presence of the earlier Pedernales points within the midden deposits can be
explained in a couple of ways. First, as the midden could have accreted via countless “dumps”
of spent cooking rock over time, the sampled portion of the midden may have only contained
later materials with material associated with earlier dumping episodes by Pedernales pointusing groups being located elsewhere on the midden beyond the sampled area. This may be
reflected by the presence of a Pedernales specimen recovered from near the base of the
midden in TU A-1. Second, the later date range indicates that Austin phase groups were
utilizing the midden area. As stated earlier, these groups were notorious for rummaging within
existing midden deposits (Black et al. 1997; Brownlow 2004). The 2 recovered Pedernales
specimens could have been introduced into the midden deposits by later groups that had
scavenged the points from elsewhere on the site. With the available data, neither scenario can
be confirmed, and, as such, BRM-1 and the Upper Midden area of site 41TV2265 are assumed
to have been utilized primarily within the Late Archaic (inclusive of subperiods I and II) and Late
Prehistoric periods.
4.2.9

Summary

Site 41TV2265 was originally documented as an extensive aboriginal open campsite
located along the ridgeline of a hill located northwest of the confluence of Bee Creek and the
Colorado River. Due to the extensive nature of the site, it was divided into 2 areas, the Upper
Midden area and the Lower Midden area. The Upper Midden area consists of the portion of the
site above the conservation pool of Lake Travis in an erosional setting where shallow soils and
exposed limestone bedrock are prominent. Although this upland setting is overall lacking in
buried deposits, 2 of the 3 burned rock middens within this area were assessed to determine if
their matrices contained significant cultural deposits. Much like the testing investigations on
nearby site 41TV2263, the testing investigations within the 2 middens in Upper Midden area of

HJN 060231 AR

59

Chapter 4.0: Results of the NRHP Testing Investigations

site 41TV2265 produced only minimal amounts of domestic debris attributable to a
living/occupation area. Again, as discussed with site 41TV2263, the recovered data appear to
reflect usage of the 2 middens as a communal baking area or “kitchen” that was potentially
located a short distance away from an actual living area in an attempt to keep the area free of
domestic detritus that would be an undesirable inclusion within any foodstuffs. The size of the
middens and the volumes of spent cooking rock comprising them would again suggest a rather
intensive utilization of the area that would require associated extended encampments in the
general vicinity in order to account for the accretion of the middens. Such an associated
extended encampment is suspected of being represented by the Lower Midden area of the site,
discussed later in the text.
Although only a cursory geomorphological assessment of the Upper Midden area was
conducted, this assessment did conclude that, based on the lack of red clay soil beneath BRM1, this midden developed in or after the Late Archaic period. This is supported by the recovery
of 2 Pedernales dart point fragments (Late Archaic I) and 1 Darl dart point (Late Archaic II).
Radiocarbon assays produced from humate samples extracted from BRM-1 indicated an initial
accretion of the midden around AD 250 to 530, a Late Archaic II age range correlating with the
recovered Darl dart point, and later activities on the midden between AD 690 and 950 during the
Austin phase of the Late Prehistoric period. Although no temporally diagnostic materials
attributable to an Austin phase utilization of the site were recovered, it is suspected that this
later date may again indicate a re-use of the midden by later scavenging groups. As will be
discussed in the next section, ample Austin phase materials (i.e., Scallorn arrow points) were
recovered from the Lower Midden area, suggesting that Austin phase groups camping in the
Lower Midden area utilized the existing middens in the Upper Midden area either as baking
locales or as areas for gathering lithic implements for reworking.
As with the middens on nearby site 41TV2263, the middens within the Upper Midden
area of site 41TV2265 were also found to have an overall lack of preservation. Again, the only
preserved faunal remains recovered from this site consisted of freshwater mussel shells within
the midden deposits, suggesting that freshwater mussels also comprised at least a portion of
the aboriginal diet at this site, although undoubtedly a variety of other animals were consumed.
Also like 41TV2263, only 1 small fragment of charred hardwood was recovered from within
BRM-1, again likely representing wood used as fuel within the ovens that resulted in the midden
accumulations. The overall size of the middens on this site leads to the assumption that the
middens likely developed, at least in part, as a result of the extended baking of geophytic plants.
Based on the contents of the documented burned rock middens within the Upper Midden
area, as well as the overall lack of associated domestic refuse, the Upper Midden area appears
to represent a specialized activity area devoted to the processing of foodstuffs (i.e., a kitchen).
Again, its location away from a living area would keep food free of detritus and keep the living
area free of smoke. As suggested earlier, the Lower Midden area of site 41TV2265 is
suspected of representing the living area associated with the Upper Midden area. This portion
of the site is discussed in detail below.

SITE 41TV2265 (LOWER MIDDEN AREA)

4.3.1

Description

The Lower Midden area of site 41TV2265 is located on a small peninsula that is
normally submerged within the conservation pool of Lake Travis (see Figures 3 and 5). During
prehistory, this location would have been an elevated ridge above the confluence of the
Colorado River and Bee Creek. As this portion of the site had been submerged for roughly the
past 70 years, the entire landform had been eroded/deflated by wave action, leaving behind a
considerable amount of cultural material on the limestone surface of the site (Figure 27).
However, during the initial survey-level investigations, at least 1 area of the site appeared to
possess potential subsurface deposits based on the placement of a “pokey rod” within what
appeared to be a deflated midden (Figure 28). As several middens that have accreted over
karst features or depressions have been documented over roughly the last 20 years in Texas
(Voellinger and Gearhart 1987; Trierweiler 1995 and 1996; Mehalchick et al. 2003; Brownlow
2004), it was suspected that use of the “pokey rod” on the Lower Midden area had indicated
another instance of midden accretion over a possible karst feature or depression. Therefore,
the main goal of the NRHP testing level investigations on this portion of the site was to assess
whether it actually retained a burned rock midden with intact, stratified deposits within a possible
karst feature/depression after being subjected to roughly 70 years of wave action and erosion.
To assess the Lower Midden area of the site 41TV2265, a total of 7 backhoe trenches
(BHTs D, E, F, G, H, I, and J) were excavated over the extent of the landform (see Figure 8).
The first 4 of these trenches (BHTs D, E, F, and G) were excavated in the cardinal directions
around the center stake placed on the suspected midden over a karst feature/depression (BRM5) in an attempt to define the horizontal and vertical extents of the feature, if actually present.
BHT G was actually an extensive trench that extended along the north/south axis of the
landform in order to discern if any intact deposits were present over the ridge of the Lower
Midden area. BHT H was placed at the northern extent of the landform over a small mound of
rocks suspected of being another midden (BRM-4). Following the assessment of these first 5
trenches, the Project Geomorphologist requested 2 additional trenches (BHTs I and J) in the
southeastern portion of the landform in order to determine if a natural drainage extended over
the landform, possibly accounting for deeper sediments on the site indicated by the “pokey rod.”
General photographs of the backhoe trenches are presented in Figures 29 through 32.
The excavation of the backhoe trenches within the Lower Midden area did in fact reveal
the presence of either an extensive natural basin or an extensive aboriginally excavated pit
below BRM-5 where the “pokey rod” indicated soil depth. To assess the deposits within the
BRM-5 pit feature, six 1 x 1-m test units (TUs D-1, D-2, F-1, F-2, F-3, and G-1) were placed
within the confines of the pit feature off of the trench profiles (see Figure 8). When these
excavations began to reveal subsurface burned rock concentrations south of BHT D, an
additional 15 contiguous test units were placed south of BHT D to chase out the edges of the
concentrations outside of the BRM-5 pit feature (see Figure 8). General photographs of the test
unit excavations are presented in Figures 33 and 34.

Chapter 4.0: Results of the NRHP Testing Investigations

In addition to the backhoe trenching and test unit excavations, the field crew also
employed several other collection methods within the Lower Midden area in an attempt to
address various research questions. The first method consisted of a series of 10 “dog leash”
surface scrapes over the surface of the Lower Midden area to test the hypothesis that high
surface artifact densities equate to buried midden deposits. Within these 10 “dog leash”
scrapes, the surface hash at each spot was collected from within a 2.0-m diameter circle and
then screened. During the screening, only formal lithic tools were collected for tabulation. The
second method consisted of a collection of the larger artifacts left resting on the surface of the
site by wave action in an attempt to discern discrete activity areas over the site. And finally, the
third method consisted of the removal of all the surface hash from over the BRM-5 pit feature in
order to collect the numerous formal tools present within the hash. While the resulting
tabulations of the artifacts recovered during all of the investigations within the Lower Midden
area are presented in the following text, the interpretations made from the data from the “dog
leash” collection and surface collection are presented later during the addressing of the
research questions in Section 5.0.
Toward the end of the field investigations, heavy rains doused the Colorado River
drainage basin and lake levels began a drastic rise. Waters began to seep into the excavated
trenches and test units, dissolving the few remaining intact portions of the pit deposits. In the
final day of fieldwork, lake waters completely covered this portion of the site well below 6 to 8
feet of water (Figures 35 and 36).
4.3.2

Burned Rock Middens (and other features)

During the initial assessments conducted within the Lower Midden area of site
41TV2265, 2 features were identified (see Figure 5). The first consisted of a small mound of
burned rock on the northern portion of the landform. This feature appeared to be the remnants
of a small, somewhat deflated burned rock midden and was subsequently labeled as BRM-4
(BRMs 1 to 3 are located in the Upper Midden area). The second feature was more ambiguous,
consisting of an oval-shaped area containing burned rock and a visibly concentrated area of
lithic tools and debris. Although the materials in this feature were found in a generally flat area
rather than an obvious mound suggestive of a typical burned rock midden, dense quantities of
lithic debitage and broken tools left sitting next to several looter holes within this feature
suggested that it was quite possibly a burned rock midden that had been deflated and
condensed by wave action during the roughly 70 years that this portion of the site was
inundated. With this thinking in mind, this oval-shaped area of concentrated cultural materials
was labeled as BRM-5. In addition, the center of this feature is where the previously discussed
“pokey” rod had been inserted, revealing the potential for a subsurface karst feature or
depression below the concentrated surface materials. As such, the feature was also termed the
BRM-5 pit feature. A photograph depicting the locations of BRM-4 and BRM-5 is presented in
Figure 37.

During the testing efforts, the smaller of the 2 features, BRM-4, was bisected length-wise
with BHT H (Figure 38; see also Figure 8). The trenching of BRM-4 revealed a relatively
shallow deposit of burned rock and black midden soil measuring approximately 30.0 cm thick.
Like the trenches within the Upper Midden area and on site 41TV2263, the resulting spoil was
generally devoid of associated artifacts aside from a few mussel shell specimens and 1 Darl
dart point. The shallow nature of the deposits as well as its contents (or lack thereof) suggested
that the feature may represent an incipient burned rock midden that began accreting as a result
of the use of the location as a small oven similar to those in the Upper Midden area during the
Late Archaic II period. As this type of feature had been investigated within the Upper Midden
area and on nearby site 41TV2263 with minimal results, no further investigations were
conducted on BRM-4 aside from the initial trenching. Rather, efforts were focused the BRM-5
pit feature in hopes of garnering new, and possibly unique data pertaining to the use of the site
and its potential pit feature.
As previously indicated, 4 backhoe trenches (BHTs D, E, F, and G) were excavated in
the cardinal directions over the BRM-5 feature in an attempt to determine if a subsurface karst
feature or depression was present beneath the concentrated surface deposits, and if so, to
determine both its horizontal and vertical extents (see Figures 29 and 30; see also Figure 8).
As can be seen in Figures 39 and 40, some form of depression was in fact present within the

marly limestone deposits beneath the concentrated surface deposits as was suggested early on
by the “pokey” rod investigations. This is evidenced in the aforementioned figures by the
distinct boundary between the upper deposits of brown silty loam overlying the orangish-beige
marl. After the 4 backhoe trenches were excavated within this feature, it became obvious that
the depression was rather extensive, measuring roughly 12.0 m east/west by 7.0 m north/south,
with a central depth of 1.1 m. At this point, the pit feature was thoroughly examined by the
Project Geomorphologist in an attempt to determine its formation and use. The results of the
geomorphological/geoarcheological investigations are presented in detail in the following
section.
With the suspected depression below the BRM-5 surface concentration suggested by
the initial “pokey” rod investigations now confirmed, the field crew set out to gather additional
data in hopes of adding to the geomorphological data in an attempt to adequately define this
relatively rare feature. This was done by excavating a total of six 1 x 1-m test units off the
resulting trench profiles within the BRM-5 pit feature (see Figure 33). The excavation of these 6
test units produced a considerable amount of cultural materials from throughout each of the 6
excavated vertical columns (discussed in the following sections). Burned rock was prolific
throughout all excavated units, although no obvious concentrations were documented that
would suggest internal features within the overall pit feature. Typical views of the burned rocks
within the pit are presented in Figures 41 and 42. Moreover, the pit feature was not completely
filled with burned rock like another similar pit feature documented by Brownlow (2004) on site
41WM650. Rather, the burned rock and other cultural materials were generally scattered

throughout the horizontal and vertical extents of the pit. This may be due to the considerable
amount of rodent burrowing documented within the feature matrix that served to jumble the
deposits, erasing any intact internal features (see Figure 39 for example of burrowing).
However, it may also suggest that the pit did not serve strictly as a burned rock disposal area
that would eventually fill with burned rock over time. Instead, it would appear that depression
may have served as a possible refuse disposal area for all discarded materials and not just
burned rock. As a result, a variety of cultural materials became incorporated within the deposits
during repeated occupations at the site. These sporadic refuse dumping episodes coupled with
natural in-filling (of both soil and cultural materials from surrounding areas) may have resulted in
the eventual filling of the depression. Once the depression did fill in, it would appear that refuse
dumping continued at this same location, resulting in potentially mounded midden deposits as
evidenced by the dense amount of concentrated cultural materials observed over the surface of
the feature. These concentrated materials are assessed as being the remnants of a midden
that deflated once the landform was inundated by the waters of Lake Travis. Wave action and
other forces served to strip the midden of all lighter matrices, leaving behind the deflated and
condensed remains of the midden over the underlying pit feature.
As work progressed within the BRM-5 pit feature, heavy rains within the upper Colorado
River basin were causing lake levels to visibly rise, endangering continued testing efforts.
During the excavation and screening of the deposits from the upper 10 cm of each test unit
within the BRM-5 pit, a considerable amount of lithic tools were recovered. This upper 10-cm
level equated to the “hash” zone over the entire site that had been reduced by wave action.
More specifically, this 10-cm “hash” zone over the BRM-5 pit feature appeared to be the
remnants of a deflated burned rock midden that had eventually accreted over the BRM-5 pit
feature once it had completely in-filled with sediment and cultural deposits. In an attempt to
salvage as much data as possible prior to the rapidly approaching inundation of the site, a
decision was made to scrape up the 10-cm “hash” zone remaining over the BRM-5 pit feature in
areas that were not sampled via the test units. This was done by subdividing the surface over
the BRM-5 pit feature into 4 quadrants (NW, NE, SW, and SE) delineated by the 4 backhoe
trenches within the feature. The results of the “hash” zone removal are discussed in the
following Lithic Tools section. After completing the “hash” zone removal, a clearly visible outline
of the horizontal extents of the deflated midden and the subsurface pit were produced as can be
seen in Figure 43.
Following the removal of the “hash” zone over the BRM-5 pit feature, a concentration of
burned rocks was noticed within the southwest quadrant of the feature, south of BHT D and
west of BHT E (Figure 44). This concentration of burned rocks was located outside, but on the
edge of the BRM-5 pit feature and was resting just above the subsurface marl at the modern
surface of the site. As this was the only discrete concentration of burned rocks noted in
association with the BRM-5 pit feature, additional test units were placed over the concentration
in order to expose it further. These additional test units continued to expose a horizontal
arrangement of burned rocks that appeared to be aligned in a large circular pattern (Figures 45
through 47). As test unit expansion continued, the resulting pattern of burned rock appeared to
be the northern portion of a large circle of burned rock suggestive of a potential prehistoric
house feature similar to those reported at several central Texas sites including the Lion Creek

Figure 47. View of exposed burned rock cluster south of BRM-5 pit feature (facing north)
site (Johnson 1997). As such, additional test units were opened in an attempt to follow out and
expose the circular pattern and prospect for a central hearth feature that is common in similar
features. In all, a total of 21 test units were excavated on this portion of the site, 6 within the
BRM-5 pit feature and 15 over the exterior burned rock concentration (see Figure 8). While the
6 test units within the pit feature extended to some depth, the 15 test units excavated to
exposed the burned rock cluster were all generally shallow (10 to 20 cm) due to shallow
subsurface marls underlying the site outside of the pit feature.
While the early exposure of the burned rock cluster created a general buzz at the
prospect of unearthing the remnants of a relatively rare prehistoric house feature in central
Texas, the excitement gradually died down as continued horizontal test unit expansion failed to
expose a continuation of the presumed circular arrangement or a central hearth feature. As can
be seen in Figures 48 through 51, the burned rock concentration decreased in density to the
south until it terminated about 1.5 m south of the BRM-5 pit feature. Although the initial
exposure of the concentration presented itself as an arcing alignment, increased exposure
revealed that the presumed arc was merely a predetermination of the pattern that was quickly
dispelled as the concentration was fully exposed. Contrary to the initial assessment of
southward arching arrangement, the exposed concentration actually consisted more of a
northward arcing arrangement that appeared to follow the outline of the pit feature rim. In
addition, the concentration also dipped to the north, down into the pit feature, as can be seen in
Figures 48 through 51. One will note an absence of burned rock on the northern edge of the
concentration within the 2 excavated test units on the edge of the trench in Figures 45 through

51. This is due to the removal of pedestaled burned rocks in preparation of continued unit
excavation prior to the exposure of the concentration. A view of these 2 units prior to burned
rock removal can be seen in Figure 41.
With the concentration now exposed, it became evident that the burned rock
concentration likely represented the southwestern edge of the lowest layer of the deflated
burned rock midden that capped the BRM-5 pit feature. Earlier in the discussion above, it was
hypothesized that, as the pit feature in-filled over time, a burned rock midden accreted over the
filled pit due to continued usage of the location as a refuse dump. This refuse midden was then
deflated and condensed once Lake Travis inundated the site, leaving behind the concentrated
cultural materials that comprised the “hash” zone over the pit feature and that first evidenced the
feature during the early investigations on the site. It would appear that as the midden accreted
over the pit feature, the outer fringes (or perhaps more) of the midden became incorporated into
the surrounding sediments (i.e., buried) over time. Once the location was flooded by lake
waters, the upper extents of the midden melted and condensed over the pit feature and over the
lower extents of the midden that lay buried/anchored in the sediment, effectively capping both
the pit feature and the base of the midden that rested over the pit feature. The current
investigations served to expose the southwestern portion of the basal remnant of the burned
rock midden that lay draped over the pit feature and that lay protected within the sediment
beneath the melted midden capping.
4.3.3

Geomorphological Observations

Like the Upper Midden area, the Lower Midden area of site 41TV2265 is situated on a
convex upland surface, but unlike the Upper Midden area, this convex surface is a discrete,
relatively narrow ridge that is now located beneath the conservation pool of Lake Travis. Areas
of locally steeper slope on this ridge are now barren bedrock, and it is not clear how much this
condition has been aggravated by wave erosion associated with Lake Travis. Most gentle
slopes across this landform are armored with a limestone gravel pavement which has formed
since Lake Travis was formed (discussed in more detail below).
Geomorphic work in this part of the site focused upon the pit-like depression (BRM-5 pit
feature), revealed by BHTs D, E, F and G, near the end of the ridge, and on assessing the
degree of soil erosion that has occurred on the site since Lake Travis was formed.
Assessment of BRM-5 Pit Feature
This pit-like feature is situated on the relatively flat crest near the end of the ridge,
immediately below a gentle scarp formed by the leading edge of a hard dolomitic bed within the
Glen Rose Limestone. The depression was approximately 8.0 m long by 4.0 m wide, and has
formed within a marly bed of the Glen Rose Limestone. The depression is approximately 1.10
m deep at its maximum, and the margins of this feature are relatively steep on the north and
east sides and more gradual on the west and south. Illustrations of the internal stratigraphy of
this feature are presented in Figures 52 and 53.

Volume 2: NRHP Testing Investigations within the Proposed 1060-Acre Vizcaya Development

The deposits within the depression were stratified, and 4 distinct sedimentary units were
recognized (Zones 2, 3, 4, and 5) (Table 5; see also Figures 52 and 53). These deposits, with
the exception of Zone 4, were generally of similar texture, specifically silty clay to slightly
gravelly silty clay, and appeared to differ from one another in terms of their organic matter
content. The deposits within the depression were organically enriched to a much greater depth
than the adjacent natural soils, and burned rock and other artifacts were present throughout the
organically enriched deposit. Zone 4 was considerably more coarsely textured than the others,
was present adjacent to the upslope (north) side of the pit, and appeared to represent colluvial
or slope sedimentation into the depression. On the east end of BHT F (Figure 52), there
appears to be a crude scatter of burnt rock dipping westward into the depression, which
considered in light of the presence of Zone 4, suggests that this depression stood open for
some period of time, which allowed cultural material and other natural rock to roll into and
accumulate on its floor. In addition to this evidence, on the shoulder of the depression on the

north, south, and west sides there are fragments of a calcium carbonate duricrust (or petrocalcic
horizon), which is often found at the top of the bedrock in limestone soils in Central Texas (cf.
Wilding 1997; Rabenhorst and Wilding 1986a; 1986b; 1986c). This duricrust was about 2 to 3
cm thick, and often fractured into discrete plate-like fragments. In BHT’s G and E, fragments of
this duricrust were observed dipping down into the depression, which may also be indicative of
this having been an open depression at one time. Interestingly, there was no trace of a rubified
B horizon within the depression, which would be expected if this structure were a natural feature
that had formed prior to the beginning of the Holocene.
Following detailed inspection of the 4 backhoe trenches that cross-cut the depression,
another 2 trenches were excavated from the end of BHT F to just beyond the end of BHT E in
order to be certain that this depression was not a natural linear feature such as a gully. These
trenches (BHTs I and J) conclusively demonstrated that the depression was a discrete structure,
but it also revealed a smaller, but similar depression immediately SE of the southern end of BHT
E. This depression was not as deep or as large as the first one, and was not examined in
detail.
A column of small soil samples were collected for magnetic susceptibility analysis in
hopes of finding evidence of cultural use of this depression, as the presence of cultural material
throughout the deposit suggested. Soils and sedimentary deposits in archeological sites may
exhibit enhanced magnetic susceptibility owing to the concentration of magnetic minerals
created during human habitation, mostly in association with burning. A column of 22 samples
were collected from BHT G and the mass corrected low frequency and high frequency magnetic
susceptibility were determined on a Bartington MS2 meter and an MS2b sensor (Table 6).
Figure 54 shows how the magnetic susceptibility varies through the pit at the sample column
collected in BHT G. In general terms, the values increase slightly with depth, peaking around
75.0 cmbs, after which the values decline dramatically toward the base of the pit. The absence
of any prominent peaks in magnetic susceptibility, and the lack of an abrupt change at the base
fail to provide evidence supporting extensive use of this pit, and especially for the disposal of
thermal refuse.
Discussion
The soil survey of the project area identifies the soils in this area as the Brackett Series,
which have formed on the stair-step topography typical of the Glen Rose Formation. This
topography is the result of differential erosion of alternating hard dolomite beds and soft marls.
Over time the more resistant dolomite beds form shelves or steps, and the more easily
weathered marls erode out to form the steep slope segments between the steps that are often
termed risers. Wilding (1997), working in conjunction with geologist Chock Woodruff near
Austin, re-evaluated the Brackett Series and determined that earlier concepts of the soil,
specifically those used by Werchan et al. (1974) in the mapping of the soils of Travis County,
Texas, failed to appreciate the small-scale variation of the soils that comprise the typical Glen
Rose Formation stair step topography. In particular, Wilding (1997) found that Bracket soils are,
somewhat counterintuitively, deepest along the steepest slope segments, where the soils are
formed on marl and water infiltration is greatest.

The BRM-5 pit feature discussed here is located immediately below a small bedrock
scarp formed by the leading edge of a resistant dolomite bed, and this general setting is
precisely the one where Wilding describes the thickest Brackett Series soils. Although this may
seem to be a good potential explanation, the pit feature is a discrete depression, not a linear
feature like Wilding describes. Secondly, the Brackett soils found beneath the risers generally
exhibit rubified B horizons, and are not merely organically enhanced marl. So it seems unlikely
that this pit is simply a common micro-expression of the Brackett Series soils.
Another possible explanation is that this feature is a solution depression or small doline.
Dolines are common on flat limestone surfaces in Central Texas, but this setting is an unlikely
one for a number of reasons. First, this is not really a flat surface, but a convex one that would
tend to shed water. Second, dolines require a drain of some form beneath them in order to form
(White 1988), and this seems unlikely in the marl, which, given its clayey texture, is probably
less permeable than the hard dolomitic bed immediately upslope. Finally, a doline would
require a considerable time to form, and it seems unlikely that this could have occurred in the
geologically brief Middle-Late Holocene. If this feature were older than Middle Holocene, it
should contain evidence of a better-developed soil, and it does not.
From the field and archeological evidence, there seem to be several significant
observations that may be critical in understanding the evolution of this feature.
1. It stood open during the last 2000 years.
Evidence:
a) Zone 4, a clear colluvial deposit that has accumulated at the foot of a
steep slope at the back or upslope edge of the depression;
b) the apparent line of burned rock dipping into the depression from the
east, visible on the BHT F profile;
c) the deposits appear to be chronologically stratified beginning in the Late
Holocene.
2. Although stratified, the deposits have been disturbed.
Evidence:
a) the presence of voids within the deposits, as well as distinct burrows;
b) variation in the radiocarbon ages from the base of the pit; a radiocarbon
date on a piece of charcoal from the base of the deposit in BHT G was
found to be approximately 830 years younger than a Rabdotus snail in a
similar stratigraphic position in BHT F.
3. In soil-geomorphic terms, this is a young feature.
Evidence:

HJN 060231 AR

87

Chapter 4.0: Results of the NRHP Testing Investigations

a) an old feature should have exhibited a better developed soil (e.g., have a
rubified B horizon, and/or a calcic horizon); the A-R soil exhibited by this
profile is consistent with a Late Holocene age.
b) if this depression had been present for much of the Holocene, it should
have contained a wide range of artifact ages similar to the upland surface
around it, and yielded radiocarbon ages with a similarly wide age range.
4. Whatever created the depression removed marly soil only a short distance upslope,
so that the same soil filled the depression back in.
Evidence:
a) the bedrock immediately upslope of the pit is a hard limestone bed, not
marl, and if this depression had filled by means of local slopewash then
its fill would be considerably coarser textured (more like Zone 4); instead
it is largely marl.
b) if the soil had been removed downslope, then the depression would likely
have been more pronounced because half or more of it would have been
lost to slopewash down slope and away from the depression; this
probably would have resulted in a prominently mixed textured fill as well
with coarser, stonier fill on the upslope side and marly fill encroaching
from the downslope side.
These observations fail to provide a smoking gun on the origin of this depression, and
can be explained by both cultural and natural processes. Of the potential natural origins, it is
unlikely to be a solution feature because its geologic attributes are not consistent with such a
process. However, 3 possible scenarios are described below, 1 anthrogenic, 1 natural, and 1 a
combination of the 2.

An Anthrogenic Explanation
Reasons for favoring an anthrogenic origin begin with the coincidence of the large
number of projectile points in the sandy swash deposits immediately above the pit. Although
these artifacts are clearly out of their primary context, it seems too coincidental that they arrived
at this location by chance. It is considered more likely that they were winnowed from their
original depositional context by wave action but not moved very far laterally. Second, the
dimensions of the depression are significantly larger than “typical” tree throws but consistent
with early human habitations such as pit houses. Although this feature bears none of the
diagnostic attributes of such a structure (specifically post holes and a central hearth) its size and
dimensions are consistent with such a feature. Likewise, the marly beds of the Glen Rose
Formation are relatively soft and easily excavated with rudimentary digging tools and whatever
process created the depression did so by placing the removed sediment on the upslope or north
side because the fill within the pit is basically the same material as was removed. Although the
distribution of cultural material throughout the pit could be created by a natural process, cultural
use of such a depression would appear to be a more likely explanation. Granted, the absence

88

060231_arch_testing_report

Volume 2: NRHP Testing Investigations within the Proposed 1060-Acre Vizcaya Development

of a clear floor deposit would seem to be a major problem here, but such a deposit could be
dispersed if there was moderate post-depositional disturbance of the deposit.

A Natural Explanation
Given Wilding’s (1997) revelation that the Brackett Series soils are more complex at a
smaller scale than usually investigated by pedologists, if this structure is a natural feature, then
perhaps others will be discovered in the future without the complicating presence of cultural
material. The most likely natural processes that could account for this feature is excessive
pedoturbation by plants and animals that would both deepen the soil profile and mix cultural
material deep below the surface. The fact that this feature contains a considerable amount of
projectile points and other lithic tools suggests that it might have started around a tree or
perhaps as a tree throw (an uprooted tree). However, pedoturbation around a tree seems to be
at odds with evidence that this depression stood open for some time, and that it contained semistratified deposits.
Tree throw, however, may be the natural process capable of explaining many of the
observed attributes of this depression. Uprooted trees often create depressions when soil
clinging to the roots (known as a root plate) is lifted upright as the tree falls over. The soil
removed by the root plate leaves a depression on the ground, and through time the soil falls
from the root plate to form a small mound adjacent to the depression. In landscapes where this
process is common (typically stony and clayey landscapes), this process may result in a
widespread form of microtopography known as cradle and knoll topography. Tree throws are
renowned for their mixed soils as the clods of soil that fall from the upturned root plate tend to
jumble and interrupt the original soil horizons, and for this reason tree throw is considered a
form of proisotropic pedoturbation (one that promotes disorder or randomness; Schaetzl and
Anderson 2005). Tree throw is easily capable of mixing larger stones from the surface into the
subsurface. Likewise, the microtopography created by tree throw would create a depression
that could gradually fill in over time with the same sediment removed from the hole, and this
depression would create conditions favorable for organic enrichment of the depression because,
in a clayey substrate, such a depression would be likely to hold water for longer, thereby
favoring plant growth and elevated organic contributions to the soil. Where this explanation is
problematic is its size (4.0 x 8.0 m is a very large root plate for central Texas trees, perhaps only
possible with a live oak motte) and depth (1.1 m is a very thick root plate). If this depression is
the result of tree throw, it is unlikely to be a unique feature in this landscape, and future work
should reveal similar depressions, but at this time we are unaware of another feature of this type
in Central Texas.

A Third Way?
Alternatively, it is possible that the depression may have been created by tree throw and
then was subsequently utilized by the aboriginal occupants of the site. The cultural deposits
within the depression are not consistent with dumping per se, but rather appear to be more
consistent with scattered refuse. This might suggest that some of the earlier cultural materials
within the pit itself were incorporated into the deposits during the gradual in-filling of a natural
depression with materials from adjacent aboriginal occupations. This may also be due to the

Chapter 4.0: Results of the NRHP Testing Investigations

high level of pedoturbation within the feature’s deposits that has served to disperse the cultural
materials throughout. While the cultural deposits within the actual pit are not consistent with the
use of the feature for extensive refuse disposal/dumping, the density of cultural materials within
the surface “hash” overlying the pit feature (inclusive of burned rock and lithic implements)
appears to be attributable to the later use of the location as a refuse midden (see Lithic Tools
section in the following text). As such, it is conceivable that a natural depression such as one
created by a tree throw gradually in-filled with scattered refuse from adjacent aboriginal
occupations and/or served as a occasionally used refuse disposal pit by the site occupants. It is
further conceivable that, over time, use of the location for refuse disposal intensified, resulting in
a burned rock midden accretion over the in-filled depression. Such a hypothesized sequence of
events is presented in Figure 55.
Effects of inundation on 41TV2265
Given that both 41TV2263 and 41TV2265 have been within the fluctuating zone of
inundation of Lake Travis, some observations were made on the effects of inundation on the
sites. It was apparent that the deeper the inundation, the greater the sites appeared to have
been affected, with the Lower Midden area of 41TV2265 exhibiting the greatest impacts.
Although a wide range of effects could be described (e.g., algae growth on clasts, effects on
vegetation, etc.), field observations on 2 processes were collected: soil erosion and the
formation of an armored surface.

Soil Erosion
Soil erosion is one of the most commonly discussed effects of reservoirs on
archeological sites, and the presence of numerous cedar stumps on the site presented an
opportunity to assess the degree of soil loss that had occurred there. As was noted in the
Methods section, an examination of cedar growing in stable (non-eroding) settings
demonstrates that the soil level is usually just about at the point that the main roots start to flare
away from the trunk. Measurement of the distance between this point on the trunk and the top
of the truncated soil provides a measure of how much soil has been lost from around the tree.
Not all cedar stumps were suitable for this measurement, given that some had clearly been
dislodged from their growth position, and a few were observed growing out of bedrock. The
amount of soil erosion was measured for a total of 7 trees, 3 of which were situated on the ridge
crest, and 4 of which were located on the lake-facing slope (Table 7). The cedar trunks on the
ridge crest revealed an average soil loss of 17.3 cm, whereas the lake-facing slope of the site
exhibited a greater degree of soil loss, with an average value of 21.75 cm. Given that the lakefacing slope was most likely exposed to more damaging wave action, it makes sense that a
greater degree of soil erosion has occurred in this setting. Overall, this equates to about 2.5 to
3.1 mm of soil loss per year, assuming that the soil removal occurred gradually over a 70-year
period of impoundment. Within their study, Lenihan et al. (1981) report an estimated soil
removal rate of approximately 2.0 cm per year on inundated sites. This would suggest that the
bulk of soils could have eroded from the site approximately 10 years after its inundation. The
current findings coupled with those of Lenihan et al. (1981) would suggest a range between 0.3
cm and 2.0 cm of soil removal per year.

Surface Armoring
Although much less discussed, one of the most apparent processes to have affected this
site is the development of a variable thickness sedimentary cover across the inundated portion
of the site. This thin veneer of lake margin sediment was internally structured and consisted of
4 distinct depositional zones that from the surface down were:
1) a coarse gravel lag on the surface;
2) a medium gravel lag;
3) a sandy swash zone; and
4) a zone of embedded cobbles at the top of the eroded soil.
The first 3 deposits constitute a prominent coarsening-upward (or reverse-graded) bed.
Modern bivalve shells were occasionally found disarticulated upon the coarse lag, but
articulated shells in their life position were found within both the medium gravel and the sandy
swash zones. Numerous disarticulated shells were found in these zones as well.
One reason there probably has not been more soil erosion at this site was the formation
of the gravel armor, which appears to effectively protect the surface, as well as trap sediment.
The surface roughness presented by the coarse gravel appears to trap finer sedimentary
particles, specifically sand and fine gravel, between the larger clasts.

Lithic Tools

Unlike the Upper Midden area of site 41TV2265, where lithic implements were generally
sparse, the Lower Midden area produced a considerable amount of lithic tools from both surface
and subsurface contexts. Table 8 presents a tabulation of all recovered lithic tools and tool
fragments from the Lower Midden area.
Of the 107 recovered projectile points and projectile point fragments, 67 are arrow
points/preforms/fragments. These arrow point specimens represent 63% of all recovered

projectile point specimens in the Lower Midden area, suggesting that the bulk of the
occupations within the Lower Midden area occurred during the Late Prehistoric period. The
majority of the recovered arrow point specimens are Scallorn points (n=26), followed by
Edwards points (n=9), Perdiz points (n=2), Cuney points (n=2), and 2 untyped specimens. Also
included are 11 arrow point preforms and 15 fragmented specimens that were not assignable to
a specific style. Based on the recovered arrow point styles, it is clear that the site was utilized
throughout the Late Prehistoric period and possibly into the Historic period, with specific
occupations attributable to both the Austin and Toyah phases via the Scallorn and Perdiz
specimens (Turner and Hester 1999). The earliest specimens (i.e., the Scallorn points) reflect
Late Prehistoric period occupations at the site as early as AD 600 or 700, while the Cuney
points could extend the occupations into the Historic period post AD 1600 (Turner and Hester
1999). A photograph of select recovered arrow point specimens is presented in Figure 56.
The remaining 40 projectile points (37%) are all dart points/preforms/fragments that
represent occupations of lesser intensities at the site from the Late Paleo-Indian period (ca.
6800 BC) up through the Late Archaic II period (ca. AD 600) (Turner and Hester 1999; Johnson
and Goode 1994). The Late Paleo-Indian period is represented by 2 Angostura basal
specimens, while the Early Archaic period is evidenced by 2 Martindale and 2 Nolan specimens
(Turner and Hester 1999). Two Pedernales specimens, 1 Marshall specimen, 1 Lange
specimen, and 1 Edgewood specimen all comprise the Late Archaic I assemblage, followed by
1 Montell specimen and 2 Ensor specimens that reflect the period around the transition of the
Late Archaic I into the Late Archaic II period (Johnson and Goode 1994). Finally, 4 Marcos
specimens and 8 Darl specimens complete the span into the Late Archaic II period (Johnson
and Goode 1994). These last 12 Marcos and Darl specimens comprise 30% of the recovered
dart points/preforms/fragments and may reflect an intensification of site utilization during the
Late Archaic II period that continued to intensify into the Late Prehistoric as is evidenced by the
even higher number of recovered arrow points. In addition to these specimens, recovered
materials also include 3 untyped dart points, 1 dart point preform, and 6 dart point fragments. A
photograph of select recovered dart point specimens is presented in Figure 57.
Of the recovered 286 lithic tools and fragments recovered during the testing
investigations on the Lower Midden area of site 41TV2265, 179 consist of an assortment of
bifaces, unifaces, manos, metates, hammer stones, etc. that would be anticipated on an
aboriginal campsite. The vast majority of the recovered non-projectile point implements are
bifaces and biface fragments (n=85) that represent the various phases of lithic reduction on site
as well as the use of such bifacial tools as knives and scrapers during day-to-day life at the site.
The various choppers, unifaces, scrapers, and drills likely reflect the processing of both plant
and animal materials for food and clothing, while the recovered 1 Guadalupe biface may also
evidence woodworking activities on site. Behind bifaces/biface fragments, manos and metates
comprise the next highest frequency of non-projectile lithics recovered from the site and clearly
reflect a considerable amount of plant processing on the site. Similarly, the recovered hammer
stones and cores, as well as the debitage reported in the next section, denote lithic reduction
activities on site inclusive of the fabrication and rejuvenation of lithic implements. A photograph
of select non-projectile lithics is provided in Figures 58 and 59.

While most of the recovered lithic implements from the Lower Midden area are those
typical of most prehistoric sites and represent the general array of domestic items, several of the
recovered lithics potentially reflect activities that are less mundane and that are more in the
realm of ceremonial or art. First, 2 small ochre specimens are remnants of mineral pigment that
was likely used to decorate items or possibly skin. Such specimens are generally common and
are not unanticipated. However, 1 recovered lithic specimen from the surface of the site did
possess a quality that is generally less commonly preserved, that quality being artistic design.
This specimen is a large secondary flake of brown chert measuring 11.3 x 9.2 x 2.1 cm that
retains an area of cortex on its dorsal face. Within this area of cortex, numerous thin lines have
been engraved (Figure 60). These lines consist of 3 sets of parallel lines that connect to form a
triangle. Hash marks were then engraved within the interior of each set of parallel lines.
Several other extraneous lines are present adjacent to the triangular design and may represent
intentional lines or possibly unintentional slips during the etching process. The design on the
specimen is not readily identifiable as a known object or living thing and may represent
something completely stylized or symbolic. It may also reflect something as simple as a bored
aborigine’s doodling or just a decorative touch on a large flake tool. Its true nature will likely
never be known beyond that of mere artistic expression. While such examples of preserved
aboriginal artwork are generally rare in Central Texas, similar specimens have also been
recovered from 41LE59 in Lee County (Rogers and Kotter 1995), 41WM989 in Williamson
County (Feit personal communication 2007), and the Gault site in Bell County (Collins and
Hester 2006). The specimens from both 41LE59 and 41WM989 where recovered from Late
Paleo-Indian and Early Archaic contexts, while the numerous Gault site specimens are
associated with Clovis era Paleo-Indian deposits. Although the specimen from the Lower
Midden area of site 41TV2265 was recovered from mixed, deflated surface contexts, it could
conceivably be associated with the late Paleo-Indian and Early Archaic occupations at the site
based on the temporal contexts from which the other aforementioned specimens were
recovered.
While most of the recovered “larger” lithic implements (i.e., manos, metates, hammer
stones, etc.) were collected from the deflated surface of the Lower Midden area, the majority of
the lithic tools were recovered from within the BRM-5 pit feature and from the “hash” zone
directly over the BRM-5 pit feature. In this area, the “hash” zone appeared to be the remnants
of a once-mounded burned rock midden that had deflated after inundation. A breakdown of the
vertical proveniences of the recovered lithic implements is presented in Table 9. In addition, a
breakdown of lithics recovered solely from the scraped “hash” zone over the BRM-5 pit is
presented in Table 10. The materials from the “hash” zone correspond with the 0 to 10 cm level
of those units excavated within the BRM-5 pit feature (i.e., TUs D-1, D-2, F-1, F-2, F-3, and G-1)
as well as unexcavated areas over the pit feature that were scraped for maximum recovery prior
to inundation of the site again by rising lake waters. The “hash” zone results are presented in
Table 10 in accordance with the quadrant over the pit feature from which they were recovered
based on the location of the backhoe trenches within the feature (NW, SW, NE, SE).

Volume 2: NRHP Testing Investigations within the Proposed 1060-Acre Vizcaya Development

Looking first at the vertical distribution of recovered lithic implements from within the test
units placed in BRM-5 pit feature (i.e., TUs D-1, D-2, F-1, F-2, F-3, and G-1), it is clear that tools
and tool fragments are distributed throughout the vertical columns, with the vast majority being
concentrated in the upper few levels. Again, as BRM-5 is assessed as being a deflated midden,
a concentration of once-mounded deposits is expected within the upper levels. The sole
recovered Martindale dart point from the lower extents of the pit feature in Level 6 of TU G-1
may hint that materials began accreting within the pit during the Early Archaic period. However,
as can be seen in Table 9, arrow points/preforms/fragments are by far the most prolific tool type
within the vertical columns, extending down even toward the base of the pit feature as
evidenced in TU G-1. This suggests 3 possible scenarios, the first being that the pit feature was
present early during prehistory as indicated by the Martindale point and later deposits have
become interspersed throughout the deposits by bioturbation (i.e., clams and rodents). The
second scenario is the same as the first except that later materials became interspersed
throughout the pit feature during midden scavenging by later groups. This scenario is
somewhat supported by the radiocarbon dates presented in the following text. The third
scenario is that the pit feature represents a later Late Prehistoric feature wherein earlier
deposits from the site’s surface became incorporated during the excavation and use of the
feature by Late Prehistoric groups. This scenario is also supported by the radiocarbon dates
extracted from the pit feature. The presence of both earlier and later dart and arrow point
specimens within the upper levels of the feature appears to more strongly support the second
scenario where later groups served to churn the deposits during scavenging activities. If an
earlier midden had been present, complete with earlier dart point specimens within its matrices,
then the variety of dart point styles and arrow point styles found within the feature’s upper
extents and the “hash” zone over the feature (see Table 10) can be readily accounted for. Later
groups would have deposited their materials alongside earlier materials while digging in the
midden deposits. Then, when the midden deposits deflated during inundation, all these
materials would become concentrated at or near the surface of the flattened feature.
4.3.5

Debitage

The recovered debitage counts and weights from all excavated test units within the
Lower Midden area of site 41TV2265 are presented in Table 11. Unlike the low debitage counts
and weights documented within BRM-1 of the Upper Midden area of the site, those of the Lower
Midden area are markedly increased with 1231 debitage specimens recovered (10,435.8 g).
This is likely attributable to the observation that the Upper Midden area appears to represent a
communal oven/kitchen that was kept free of debris while the Lower Midden area is suspected
of representing the actual area where the most intensive encampments on the site are located,
and, as such, where the densest amount of debris would be located. As can be seen in the
table, the uppermost level of each excavated test unit retained the highest density of lithic
debitage within each excavated vertical column. Recalling that the entire surface of the Lower
Midden area has been stripped of all soil matrices via wave action, leaving behind deflated and
condensed cultural deposits, the upper “hash” layer over the site (i.e., the upper 10 cm)
contained denser quantities of most materials, including lithic debitage. As such, the debitage
densities within the upper limits of the site clearly do not reflect an intensification of site usage

later in time, but rather a condensation of debitage from the years of repeated usage of the site
that were once contained in the stripped-away soil deposits.
While the debitage densities within the upper level of the Lower Midden area are
condensed, there does appear to be a relative pattern of vertical debitage distribution within the
columns of the 4 test units (TUs F-1, F-2, F-3, and G-1) that were excavated to the base of the
BRM-5 pit feature. In looking at the debitage counts and weights for these units in the following
table, one will note lower debitage counts/weights within the lower extents of each test unit that
gradually increase as one moves upward. For example, debitage frequencies in TUs F-2 and F3 increase from the lower extents up to Level 4 where they peak. Frequencies then drop
sharply in Level 3, but then begin increasing again in the upper 2 levels. A similar pattern is
seen in TUs F-1 and G-1, except the pattern repeats twice from bottom to top. This suggests
some degree of stratification within the BRM-5 pit deposits rather than jumbled midden deposits.
Although no formal analysis of the debitage was conducted for the testing level
investigations as they were not deemed relevant to address the research questions, an informal,
untabulated review of the debitage was conducted. Generally speaking, the vast majority of the
recovered debitage assemblage from the Lower Midden consists of tertiary flakes. However,
both primary and secondary flakes are also present, suggesting that all phases of lithic

reduction occurred on-site. Several large specimens were noted and appear to reflect the use
of chert materials present on the site that were observed within the eroding limestone deposits.
In addition to the expedient reduction phase assessment, a general patination assessment was
requested by the Project Geomorphologist to aid in the determination of theage and function
of the BRM-5 pit feature. The bags of recovered debitage were separated based on whether
they were recovered from within the BRM-5 pit feature or from outside the feature. Then, each
bag was visually assessed to determine the relative percentage of patinated specimens (i.e., >
or < 50%). Assuming that the pit feature was more attributable to later groups as suggested by
the radiocarbon dates (see Radiocarbon section in the following text), one would expect to see
less patination on the materials within the pit feature since they would be younger. However,
based on the visual examination, the debitage assemblage from within the pit feature appeared
to contain higher percentages of patinated specimens compared to the assemblage from
outside the pit. This would suggest that the pit may in fact be older than the dates indicated by
the resulting radiocarbon assays, and that these later assays may represent materials
introduced into the feature deposits by later scavenging groups or via rodent/clam turbation.
This would also account for the earlier dart point styles recovered from within the pit feature as
indicated in the previous section.
4.3.6

Faunal Remains

During the testing investigations within the Lower Midden area of site 41TV2265,
recovered faunal materials consisted solely of freshwater mussel shells. Again, this would
suggest that either preservation is essentially non-existent within this area of the site or that 1 of
the primary activities associated with the Lower Midden area was the gathering, baking, and
consumption of freshwater mussels. As can be seen in Table 12, the umbos from freshwater
mussels were recovered from almost every excavated test unit level in the Lower Midden area
with the exception of six 10-cm levels that were excavated south of BRM-5. All unit levels (TUs
D-1, D-2, F-1, F-2, F-3, and G-1) excavated within the BRM-5 pit feature produced mussel shell
fragments. Generally speaking, mussel shell weights and frequencies were relatively constant
throughout the vertical extents of the test units within the BRM-5 pit feature, with slight
variations at varying depths. These varying densities of mussel shell amounts may reflect
distinct and repeated episodes of mussel baking wherein certain occasions witnessed increased
amounts of processed mussel while others witnessed lesser amounts, thereby accounting for
the varying frequencies. One rather obvious spike in mussel shell counts and weight is noted
within Level 1 of TU G-1. Within this 10-cm level, recovered mussel shell counts and weights
are roughly 5 to 7 times greater than the majority of the other excavated unit levels. TU G-1
was excavated near the estimated center of BRM-5, and as such, the excavation could have
conceivably captured the remnants of a distinct baking or dumping episode at the center of the
midden feature. However, as BRM-5 is a deflated midden where vertical deposits have been
condensed downward, the increased frequency of mussel shells within Level 1 of TU G-1 could
also have resulted from the condensation of once-stratified deposits within a mounded midden
that contained multiple baking or dumping episodes.

Macrobotanical Remains

Only 1 bulk matrix sample was recovered from the Lower Midden area on 41TV2265.
This matrix sample was taken from a cluster of burned rocks that ranged between levels 1
through 3 (0-30 cm) within the BRM-5 pit feature. After flotation, Dr. Leslie Bush examined the
sample for carbonized remains. Her analysis produced only 1 fragment of carbonized wood
from the sample (Table 12.1). This fragment, measuring greater than 2 mm in diameter, was
snapped to reveal a transverse section. The surface was distorted by carbonization and
exhibited high reflectance, indicating carbonization at high temperature (Scott 2001). Pores
were all of a similar, medium-small size. The fragment was identified as a diffuse-porous
hardwood. Aside from this specimen, no other carbonized materials were recovered from the
sample.
The single carbonized fragment from within the BRM-5 pit was assessed as a hardwood
that likely represents the remains of the fuel wood burned within a hearth of baking pit/earth
oven rather than the food remains that were prepared at the site. Based on the general
absence of preserved, carbonized materials within the deposits, it seems unlikely that the
deposits within the Lower Midden area of site 41TV2265 are capable of yielding data pertaining
to the plant resources exploited for food at the site and that the Lower Midden area can be
characterized as generally lacking in preserved floral remains.

Radiocarbon Assays

A total of 5 samples from within the BRM-5 pit were submitted to Beta Analytical for
dating. These included 3 Rabdotus snail shells from various levels within the pit as well as 2
specimens of charred material. The first specimen of charred material (Beta-229553) was
recovered from a depth of 115 cmbs within the pit, roughly 10 cm above the bedrock base of the
pit in BHT G. The second specimen of charred material (Beta-229557) was recovered from
Level 3 (20-30 cmbs) in TU-D1. The 3 snail specimens were recovered from depths of 25 cmbs
(Beta-229554), 55 cmbs (Beta-229555), and 81 cmbs (Beta-229556) in the profile of BHT F.
The resulting assays are presented in Table 13 with respect to the arbitrary 10-cm levels from
which they were recovered from within the pit. Beta Analytical’s report is provided in Appendix
A.
Regarding the assays produced from recovered snail shells, Ellis (2003) indicates that
the average age anomaly for Rabdotus shells in central and south Texas is 700+210 years too
old. Thus, the 2 Sigma calibrated assays provided by Beta Analytical are essentially anywhere
from 910 to 490 years too old. As such, Ellis’s (2003) age anomaly has been applied to the
Beta Analytical assays and the corrected ranges are included with the conventional ages and 2
Sigma calibrated age ranges in Table 13.

Based on the resulting assays, it would appear that the BRM-5 pit was utilized primarily
late in prehistory between Johnson’s (1995) Late Archaic II subperiod and the Toyah phase of
the Late Prehistoric period (i.e., between 290 BC and AD 1300), with the most intense usage
during the Austin phase of the Late Prehistoric period. This age range corresponds quite nicely
with the variety and density of temporally diagnostic projectile points recovered from within the
midden. The recovered Marcos, Ensor, Edgewood, and Darl dart points reflect the Late Archaic
II usage (and possible excavation) of the pit, while the Edwards and Scallorn arrow points reflect
the Austin phase usage and the Perdiz and Cuney arrow points reflect the Toyah phase and
perhaps later usage. The earlier projectile point styles such as Angostura, Martindale, Nolan,
Pedernales, Marshall, Montell, and Lange clearly reflect earlier occupations on the landform
during the late Paleo-Indian, Early and Middle Archaic, and the Late Archaic I periods. Their
association with the BRM-5 pit deposits may be a result of later groups scavenging earlier
points from the site and incorporating them into midden contexts or the results of wave action
deflating and redepositing materials over the site as no earlier dates resulted from the assayed
materials.
Of the recovered projectile points, Scallorn (n=26) and Edwards (n=9) are the most
prolific styles with Darl points (n=8) coming in third. The density of Scallorn and Edwards points
would appear to reflect a more intense utilizing of the midden during the Austin phase, an
assumption that is supported by the fact that 3 of the 5 assays also reflect Austin phase dates.
In reviewing the stratigraphic location of the 5 resulting assays within the BRM-5 pit
feature, it is clear that essentially all the dates are juxtaposed to some degree and that the
cultural deposits within the feature, at best, can only be characterized as semi-stratified. One of
the latest dates (AD 1020 to 1200) came from the lowest extent of the pit, below the 290 BC to
AD 500 date. Similarly, Austin phase and Toyah phase dates resulted from materials in the
same level (Level 3). However, with the exception of the AD 1020 to 1200 date from the lowest
extent of the pit, the remaining 4 dates generally trend from oldest to youngest as one moves up
through the feature matrix (see Table 13). Clearly there has been a relatively significant amount
of churning of the deposits from bioturbation. As has been stated previously, it is not
uncommon for later Austin phase groups to have rummaged through midden deposits.
However, in the case of the BRM-5 pit, numerous large rodent burrows were documented
throughout the pit deposits. Some of these were large cavities that collapsed when
encountered. Lenihan et al. (1981) note that burrowing animals often target the softer exposed
midden deposits on inundated sites during periods of low reservoir levels. As such, it is not
unreasonable to assume that rodent turbation contributed a fair amount to the mixing of the
deposits. In addition, Lenihan et al. (1981) also indicate that freshwater clams also target
submerged midden deposits, resulting in a mixing of the deposits. This issue is further
exasperated by animals such as raccoons burrowing in the midden deposits in search of clams
during low lake levels. The mixing of the deposits in the BRM-5 pit is likely the result of all these
factors: humans, rodents, clams, and clam scavenging animals.
Based on the 5 resulting assays from the BRM-5 pit, it would appear that the pit feature
itself was most heavily utilized between the Late Archaic II and the Late Prehistoric periods.
Although the pit feature is lacking in earlier dates, the presence of earlier dart point styles within

HJN 060231 AR

111

Chapter 4.0: Results of the NRHP Testing Investigations

the pit feature suggests that it may have been an open depression on the landform at least as
early as the Early Archaic period. The lack of earlier dates from the pit feature may be a
product of preservation. Only a few small fragments of charred materials were recovered from
the pit, producing later age ranges. This dismal state of preservation on the site could suggest
that earlier specimens have since deteriorated and that only minute remnants of the latest
materials currently exist. As such, while the radiocarbon assays reflect later usage of the pit
feature, the recovered projectile specimens clearly reflect usage of the overall area throughout
most of prehistory. Early specimens within the pit matrices could reflect earlier use of the
feature or simply the erosion of early materials into the pit once it formed. Regardless, it would
appear that later groups are responsible for the most intensive use of the pit for various
purposes throughout the Late Prehistoric period, presumably most intensively during the Austin
phase based on the number of Scallorn arrow points within the feature as well as the fact that 3
of the 5 dates reflect this temporal period.
4.3.9

Summary

The Lower Midden area of site 41TV2265 consists of the portion of the site along a lower
ridgeline that sat above the confluence of Bee Creek and the Colorado River during prehistory.
Following the creation of Lake Travis in the 1930s, this portion of the site has been routinely
inundated over roughly the last 70 years. During this time, wave action and other erosional
forces have served to deplete the Lower Midden area of the majority of its soils matrices,
leaving behind a deflated surface of limestone cobbles and cultural materials over the horizontal
extent of the landform. Generally speaking, this has resulted in an extreme loss of context for
the cultural materials on the site, concentrating any once-stratified deposits on the eroded
surface. In most cases, such an eroded site lacking in buried, stratified cultural deposits would
be considered relatively insignificant due to the loss of context and its resulting inability to
address specific questions pertaining to the prehistory of the region. However, in the case of
the Lower Midden area, a prime opportunity was provided to address the effects of inundation
on prehistoric sites within the conservation pool of Lake Travis. In addition, the deflation of the
site’s deposits by inundation also, quite fortuitously, served to cap the BRM-5 pit feature
beneath the resulting armor mantle of limestone cobbles and burned rocks that now cover the
site’s surface. This in turn allowed for the recovery of a considerable amount of data relevant to
the occupation of this portion of the site, and perhaps to the Upper Midden area of the site as
well.
Recalling the discussion of the Upper Midden area of site 41TV2265 and nearby site
41TV2263, it was hypothesized that these 2 locations possibly represented communal ovens or
“kitchen” areas located away from the main encampments in an attempt to keep the foodstuffs
free from everyday refuse, as well as to keep the main encampments free of smoking ovens.
This suggestion was developed based on the overall lack of domestic detritus in association
with the burned rock middens at these locations. Conversely, it was reasoned that, based on
the copious amounts of burned rocks comprising the middens, evidence of substantial
occupations should be present somewhere in the general vicinity as it would have taken a
considerable amount of time or a considerable number of repeated occupations to fire the ovens
enough times to produce the amounts of spent cooking rock within the middens. Based on the

112

060231_arch_testing_report

Volume 2: NRHP Testing Investigations within the Proposed 1060-Acre Vizcaya Development

recovered materials, it would appear that the Lower Midden area was the home of numerous
encampments throughout prehistory and likely represents the hypothesized encampment or
living area associated with at least the Upper Midden area of the site.
From within the Lower Midden area, the recovered artifact assemblage appears to
reflect the day to day activities commonly associated with an actual living area. A variety of
mano/metate fragments and choppers reflect the processing and milling of plant materials, while
the recovered hammer stones, biface fragments, projectile point preforms, and lithic debitage
reflect lithic reduction activities and tool production and refurbishing. Several recovered
drills/perforators and scrapers also suggest that hide working and preparation also took place
on site. The burned rock littered over the site suggests that hearths, griddles, and possibly
baking pits were also constructed in this area. And then the recovered ochre specimens as well
as the engraved chert flake also suggest that more leisurely activities such as artwork also
occurred within the Lower Midden area. In all, these materials clearly reflect repeated
occupations in this area of the site that may represent the encampments associated with the
“kitchen” area in Upper Midden area of the site.
By far the most interesting feature within the Lower Midden area is the BRM-5 pit
feature. As discussed earlier in the text, this feature may have initially formed by tree throw,
presumably when a small motte of trees toppled during high winds or another natural process.
This resulted in a relatively significant pit within this portion of the site. Over time, the pit filled
with cultural materials, either via erosion or by the intentional dumping of refuse within the
depression (or possibly by both). This in-filling could have initiated as early as the Early Archaic
period as is evidenced by a lone Martindale point recovered from the lower extremities of the
feature. As time wore on and the pit filled to capacity, it would appear that the location
continued to be used as a refuse disposal area and that a midden deposit composed of both
burned rock and general detritus (e.g., broken tools, projectile points, etc.) gradually formed
over the top of the filled depression. The fact that a midden accreted over the pit suggests that
the location may have served as a specific refuse disposal area during prehistory and that the
infilling of the depression possibly resulted more from intentional dumping episodes rather than
natural erosional processes. Regardless, based on the density of cultural materials over the pit
feature, it would appear that a sizeable aboveground midden accreted over the feature. When
the waters of Lake Travis inundated this portion of the site, the soil matrices over the site, as
well as those within the midden, were gradually washed away, leaving behind exposed and
concentrated cultural materials over the site. During this process, the midden over the pit
feature essentially melted radially, capping (and preserving) the pit feature and the basal
portions of the midden that had become buried prior to inundation.
Regarding the temporal periods associated with the overall occupation of the site, the
recovered projectile points suggest that the site was first occupied as early as the late PaleoIndian period (indicated by recovered Angostura specimens) up through the Late Prehistoric
period (indicated by the numerous arrow point specimens). In looking at the numbers of
recovered projectile points, it would appear that the most intensive utilization of the site occurred
later in time during the Late Prehistoric period. This assessment is made based on the recovery
of 67 arrow points/fragments/preforms compared to the 40 recovered dart

Chapter 4.0: Results of the NRHP Testing Investigations

points/fragments/preforms. However, this difference in projectile point frequency could also be
produced if later groups retained more arrows in their arsenal compared to earlier groups who
may have had fewer large darts readily available.
As noted above, the BRM-5 pit feature within the Lower Midden area could conceivably
have been present during the Early Archaic period based on the recovery of a Martindale point
from its lower extents. Other dart point specimens within the feature matrices also suggest
continued cultural deposition within the Middle and Late Archaic periods. However, the 5
radiocarbon assays produced from materials extracted from the pit feature all reflect primarily a
Late Prehistoric presence within the feature deposits with the exception of 1 Late Archaic II
subperiod date. Similarly, arrow point specimens were also found throughout the vertical extent
of the pit feature. The younger materials throughout the feature matrix could reflect the
scavenging of later groups within the midden deposits for lithic materials. They could also
reflect the extreme degree of turbation that has occurred within the feature deposits as a result
of burrowing animals such as rodents and clams. However, the lack of older datable material
within this feature could suggest that the feature is in fact younger than is indicated by the dart
point specimens contained within it. This latter scenario is considered to be more suspect for 2
reasons. First, investigations on a similar midden/pit feature on site 41WM650 produced
evidence of midden accretion within a karst feature from the Early Archaic through the Late
Archaic periods based on recovered dart point styles (Brownlow 2004). However, both
radiocarbon assays produced from the investigations within the feature resulted in Late
Prehistoric (Austin phase) dates (Brownlow 2004). These later dates again appear to be
attributable to scavenging within midden deposits by later groups. Secondly, preservation within
the Lower Midden area of site 41TV2265 (and the Upper Midden area as well) was essentially
non-existent. The age ranges produced for the pit deposits were derived from 3 snail shells and
2 samples of preserved carbon. Aside from these samples, only a few additional flecks of
charred material were recovered during the investigations. Based on the later dates of the few
preserved specimens, it is conceivable that any earlier materials have since deteriorated, and all
that remains are the few surviving remnants of the youngest materials on the site, which also
appear to be almost completely destroyed.
In addition to the lack of preserved charred materials within the Lower Midden area, the
lack of overall preservation also precluded the recovery of any faunal remains in this portion of
the site aside from freshwater mussels. Again, this suggests that freshwater mussels
comprised at least a portion of the aboriginal diet at this site, although it is probable that a
variety of other animal proteins were consumed.
Although BRM-4 within the Lower Midden area was not investigated beyond the
excavation of a backhoe trench along its axis, it would appear to be a smaller, incipient kitchen
midden similar to those in the Upper Midden area based on the lack of domestic refuse
materials within its matrices. As such, while it is hypothesized that the Upper Midden area of
the site represents a communal oven area or kitchen located away from the encampment, it is
possible that smaller scale baking operations also occurred within the Lower Midden area at
some point in time. However, BRM-5 does not appear to have accreted from its use as a

114

communal oven. Rather, the densities of domestic debris within this feature would suggest that
it resulted more from refuse disposal (trash heap/midden) than from baking.

5.0 DISCUSSION (RESEARCH QUESTIONS)

This chapter addresses the posited research questions developed for the testing
investigations on sites 41TV2263 and 41TV2265. The research questions below are addressed
separately utilizing the synthesized data compiled in the previous chapter.

5.1

TEMPORAL PERIODS

One of the basic goals of the investigations on sites 41TV2263 and 41TV2265 was to
firmly determine the temporal periods in which the sites were utilized. The initial survey level
efforts failed to produce any temporally diagnostic implements from site 41TV2263, while they
did produce several temporally diagnostic projectile points from 41TV2265. These included a
possible lanceolate specimen (Paleo-Indian), a Nolan dart point (Middle Archaic), a Darl dart
point (Late Archaic II), and an Edwards arrow point (Late Prehistoric). These projectile points
suggested repeated occupations at site 41TV2265 over most of the span of prehistory with the
exception of the Early Archaic period. Due to the proximity of site 41TV2265 to nearby
41TV2263, it seems logical that both sites in general would represent similar occupational
periods. However, the bigger question of what temporal periods the midden features on each
site belonged to remained.
Regarding site 41TV2263, a humate sample taken from the lower level of BRM-1 during
the testing investigations produced assays indicating that the midden began accreting between
910 and 760 BC during Johnson’s (1995) Late Archaic I period. A second humate sample
extracted from the upper extent of the midden indicated a later use of the midden between AD
1000 and 1230 during the Austin phase of the Late Prehistoric period. As discussed in the
previous chapter, the later Austin phase date could potentially represent the use of the existing
middens as baking pits by the later groups or merely their rummaging within the middens for
useful materials. Aside from the 2 humate dates, no other temporal indicators were recovered
from site 41TV2263.
Moving to the Upper Midden area on site 41TV2265, the previous survey level efforts
produced a Darl point from surface contexts near BRM-1. This specimen suggested a possible
usage of the midden during Johnson’s (1995) Late Archaic II period. In addition, 2 Pedernales
dart point fragments recovered during the testing investigations within the midden also
suggested midden accretion during Johnson’s (1995) Late Archaic I period. A humate sample
from the lower extent of BRM-1 produced an age range of AD 250 to 530, suggesting that the

117

Chapter 5.0: Discussion (Research Questions)

base of the midden dates to the Late Archaic II period, consistent with the recovered Darl point,
while a humate sample for the upper limits of the midden produced an age range of AD 690 to
950, indicative of a Late Prehistoric usage of the midden. No dates reflective of a Late Archaic I
usage were produced that would be attributable to the presence of the 2 Pedernales dart points
within the midden deposits. The lack of Pedernales-age dates may be a result of sampling
error. If the midden resulted from a series of dumping episodes of spent cooking rock, the
sampled portion of the midden may have only contained later materials with material associated
with earlier dumping episodes by Pedernales point using groups being located elsewhere on the
midden beyond the sampled area. However, since the upper humate date reflects Austin phase
groups utilizing the midden area, the 2 recovered Pedernales specimens could have been
introduced into the midden deposits by later groups that had scavenged the points from
elsewhere on the site. With the available data, neither scenario can be confirmed, and, as such,
BRM-1 and the Upper Midden area of site 41TV2265 are assumed to have been utilized
primarily within the Late Archaic (inclusive of subperiods I and II) and Late Prehistoric periods.
Finally, the survey level efforts within the Lower Midden area of site 41TV2265 produced
an Edwards arrow point and a Nolan dart point, indicating Late Prehistoric and Middle Archaic
surface expressions on this area of the site. During the testing efforts, recovered projectiles
from the exposed limestone surface of the site as well as the BRM-5 pit feature revealed prior
occupations at the site dating throughout most of prehistory: late Paleo-Indian period (Angostura
points); Early Archaic period (Martindale points); Middle Archaic period (Nolan points); Late
Archaic I period (Pedernales, Marshall, and Montell points); Late Archaic II period (Marcos,
Ensor, and Darl points); Austin phase of the Late Prehistoric period (Scallorn and Edwards
points); Toyah phase of the Late Prehistoric period (Perdiz points). Radiocarbon assays from
the BRM-5 pit feature indicate that this feature was utilized between Johnson’s (1995) Late
Archaic II subperiod and the Toyah phase of the Late Prehistoric period (i.e., between 290 BC
and AD 1300), with its most intensive usage during the Austin phase. However, a Martindale
point recovered from the lower extents of the BRM-5 pit feature suggests that the depression
could have been present as early as the Early Archaic period. If so, earlier materials could have
begun being incorporated within the pit, either intentionally or via natural in-filling, considerably
earlier than the Late Archaic II subperiod. The presence of a variety of projectile point styles
spanning most of prehistory within and overlying the BRM-5 pit feature suggests that this is
likely the case and that the most intensive usage of the feature occurred after the pit filled,
leaving the majority of the Late Prehistoric materials within the feature’s upper extents.
However, Late Prehistoric materials were also recovered throughout the vertical extent of the pit
feature. These may have become incorporated into the vertical extents of the feature via
natural processes such as bioturbation as the feature matrices were riddled with rodent
burrows. They may also have been incorporated into the depths of the pit feature
anthrogenically if later groups scavenged within the midden deposits for lithic materials. Both
processes would serve to churn the deposits, resulting in the current, apparently jumbled,
stratigraphy.
With the dates and materials from both the Upper and Lower Midden areas of site
41TV2265, it can be concluded that site 41TV2265 was occupied repeatedly throughout most of
prehistory between the late Paleo-Indian period and the Toyah phase of the Late Prehistoric

118

060231_arch_testing_report

Volume 2: NRHP Testing Investigations within the Proposed 1060-Acre Vizcaya Development

period. However, the middens themselves on the site, at least BRM-1 and BRM-5, appear to
reflect more intensive utilization of the site during the Late Archaic I and II subperiods and the
Austin and Toyah phases of the Late Prehistoric periods.

5.2

MIDDEN TYPE/FORMATION

The current investigations reported herein almost exclusively focused on the midden
features present on sites 41TV2263 and 41TV2265. On site 41TV2263, backhoe trenches were
excavated within the 3 observed burned rock middens (BRMs 1 through 3). On site 41TV2265,
hand-excavated units and/or backhoe trenches were used to assess 2 of the 3 middens (BRMs
1 and 2) within the Upper Midden area, as well as the 2 middens (BRMs 4 and 5) located in the
Lower Midden area. Obviously, the investigation into 7 burned rock middens presented an
opportunity to compare and contrast the form and function of each. It also allowed for a
determination of the types of surfaces that each was constructed upon, leading to
generalizations pertaining to aboriginal refuse disposal. And, as one man’s trash is another
man’s treasure, the midden investigations also served to add to the growing number of
examples of aboriginal scavenging within earlier midden deposits. A brief discussion of these
various midden aspects follows.
Midden Form
In their discussion of midden forms, Black et al. (1997) discuss 3 forms of middens
commonly found in Central Texas: domed, annular or ring-shaped, and sheet. The domed form
coincides with Weir’s (1976:34) Type I midden, which is described as “oval and mounded in
shape with no surface indication of subsurface features.” The annular form coincides with
Weir’s (1976) Type II midden, also called a ring midden and described as having a central oven
pit. Finally, the sheet form coincides with Weir’s (1976) Type IV midden. This form is described
as a burned rock scatter that is typically no more than 1 layer thick that may be the incipient
form of the Type I midden.
Questioning whether domed and annular middens are
fundamentally 2 different forms, Black et al. (1997) posit an alternate hypothesis, suggesting
that the annular midden is the archetypal midden form and most middens having a domed or
structureless appearance are actually annular middens that were not recognized as such due to
a variety of reasons, including erosion and disturbance.
While Black et al. (1997) and Weir (1976) have delineated midden forms by general
shape, Weir (1976) has also described the contents of his Type I and Type II middens in a
further attempt to differentiate between the 2 types. He notes that, within Type I (domed)
middens, bone, shell, and faunal debris are common. However, such materials are rarely found
in Type II (annular) middens. He further notes Type II (annular) middens are almost always
barren of diagnostic artifacts, but commonly contain the charred remains of plant foods.
Weir’s (1976) differentiation between the midden types appears to reflect different uses
for the 2 midden types. In Type II (annular) middens, charred plant foods are common, clearly
reflecting the use of the midden’s central depression as an oven where plant materials were

HJN 060231 AR

119

Chapter 5.0: Discussion (Research Questions)

baked. The observed lack of diagnostic materials within the Type II (annular) middens may be
reflective of the “clean kitchen” notion posited earlier in the text where the ovens are kept free of
general domestic debris in order to keep such materials out of the prepared foodstuffs.
Similarly, it may also reflect the probability that such midden accumulations did not serve as
general refuse heaps where rotting animal remains and other refuse were discarded since such
contamination would be undesirable within one’s oven.
Conversely, Weir (1976) does indicate that bone, shell, and faunal debris are common in
the Type I (domed) midden. While these materials may reflect the type of fauna baked within
ovens that resulted in the formation of the midden, they may also reflect discarded faunal
elements left over after the meat was consumed. In such instances, it could be argued that
such deposits reflect more of a refuse disposal area or trash heap rather than an annulus
around a cleaned-out oven feature. Furthermore, while Weir (1976) notes that Type II (annular)
middens are barren of diagnostic artifacts, his lack of such indication for the Type I (domed)
midden can be inferred to suggest that the opposite is true for the Type I (domed) variety. If so,
diagnostic implements such as projectile points and their fragments would be anticipated in
such a midden deposit, resulting from their general disposal on a refuse heap as well as from
their inclusion in animal carcasses disposed of on the refuse heap.
Although Black et al. (1997) and Weir (1976) all present similar midden forms, Weir’s
(1976) differentiation of midden contents appears to reflect the accumulation of midden from
different functions, plant baking in central ovens (kitchen middens) and general refuse heaps.
With these earlier studies in mind, each of the 7 middens assessed during the current
investigations are delineated below in accordance with the descriptions devised by Black et al.
(1997) and Weir (1976) in an attempt to shed light on the formation of each.
BRM-1 (Site 41TV2263)
Shape:

Domed with no obvious central depression (Type I)

Contents:

Generally lacking in artifacts, no diagnostics (Type II); observed mussel
shells (Type I)

Interpretation: BRM-1 appears to be possible example that supports Black et al.’s (1997)
hypothesis of a domed (Type I) midden being an eroded example of an
annular (Type II) midden. First, its overall lack of observed artifacts within
the midden matrices suggests that it functioned more as a clean oven
rather than a refuse heap. Although mussel shells were observed in this
midden, indicative of possible refuse on a Type I midden, these
specimens may also reflect food that was actually baked within the
central oven feature alongside plant foods rather than discarded remains.
Due to dense tree growth on this midden, trenching of the central portion
was not possible, and as such, it could not be determined if a central pit
feature was present. The observed “dome” shape could be a product of
the eroded and looted nature of the midden. However, this midden could

120

060231_arch_testing_report

Volume 2: NRHP Testing Investigations within the Proposed 1060-Acre Vizcaya Development

also be a dump pile of spent cooking rock from a baking pit located offmidden, and, as a result, would have no central pit.
BRM-2 (Site 41TV2263)
Shape:

Thin scatter of burned rock on a slope (sheet; Type IV)

Contents:

Generally lacking in artifacts, no diagnostics (Type II); observed mussel
shells (Type I)

Interpretation: Here is an example of a midden expressing the characteristics of 3
different midden types. Clearly, the sheet-like formation of this midden
suggests that it is an incipient midden that began forming on a slope. The
lack of artifacts within the deposits may reflect that it began accreting as a
result of plant baking activities in the vicinity, while the mussel shells may
also reflect other materials being baked on site. The fact that this midden
forms a point on a triangle made by the 3 middens on this site may
indicate more of a central oven pit in the area between the middens, and
that all 3 formed from clean-out episodes within such an oven. The fact
that this midden appears to be incipient may suggest that BRM-1 grew to
a large size and that subsequent dumps of spent cooking rock were
placed in the areas containing BRM-2 and BRM-3.
BRM-3 (Site 41TV2263)
Shape:

Thin scatter of burned rock on a slope (sheet; Type IV)

Contents:

Generally lacking in artifacts, no diagnostics (Type II); observed mussel
shells (Type I)

Interpretation: BRM-3 is another example of a midden expressing the characteristics of
3 different midden types. Like BRM-2 above, this midden is a point on a
triangle formed by the 3 middens on this site. Again, this may indicate
more of a central oven pit in the area between the middens, and that all 3
formed from clean out episodes within such an oven. Overall, the 3
middens on this site are generally lacking in any cultural materials aside
from burned rock. This suggests that the area served as more of a
communal baking area or kitchen, and that the middens resulted from
such an activity rather than from general refuse disposal.
BRM-1 (Upper Midden Area of Site 41TV2265)
Shape:

Domed with no obvious central depression (Type I)

Contents:

Generally sparse artifacts (Type II), although several diagnostics
recovered (Type I); observed mussel shells (Type I)

HJN 060231 AR

121

Chapter 5.0: Discussion (Research Questions)

Interpretation: BRM-1 possesses characteristics of both domed (Type I) and annular
(Type II) middens and again appears to be a possible example that
supports Black et al.’s (1997) hypothesis of a domed (Type I) midden
being an eroded example of an annular (Type II) midden. Again, its
overall lack of observed artifacts within the midden matrices suggests that
it functioned more as a clean oven/kitchen rather than a refuse heap.
Although mussel shells were observed in this midden, indicative of
possible refuse on a Type I midden, these specimens may also reflect
food that was actually baked within the central oven feature alongside
plant foods rather than discarded remains. While no obvious central
depression was documented on this midden, such a depression within
this sizable midden could have been missed due to the limited
investigations on the midden. However, as with the middens on site
41TV2263, BRM-1 may also be a product of dumping episodes from an
off-midden oven feature. However, this midden also contained several
dart point specimens. While the midden appears to be more reflective of
a kitchen midden, it is conceivable that general refuse was also deposited
on the midden by groups moving through the area but not utilizing the
location for plant baking.
BRM-2 (Upper Midden Area of Site 41TV2265)
Shape:

Domed with no obvious central depression (Type I)

Contents:

Generally sparse artifacts (Type II); observed mussel shells (Type I)

Interpretation: BRM-2 was only minimally investigated with 1 backhoe trench. However,
its contents, or lack thereof aside from burned rock and an occasional
mussel shell, suggest that it, too, formed from the disposal of spent
cooking rock from a nearby baking pit similar to the adjacent BRM-1. As
the area containing BRM-1 and BRM-2 appears to be a specialized plant
baking area generally lacking in domestic refuse, it is conceivable that
BRM-2 is another possible example of an eroded annular (Type II)
midden. Again, its overall lack of observed artifacts within the midden
matrices suggests that it functioned more as a clean oven/kitchen rather
than a refuse heap.
BRM-4 (Lower Midden Area of Site 41TV2265)
Shape:

Domed with no obvious central depression (Type I)

Contents:

Generally sparse artifacts (Type II); observed mussel shells (Type I)

Interpretation: BRM-4 was also only minimally investigated with 1 backhoe trench.
However, its general lack of contents aside from burned rock and an
occasional mussel shell, suggest that it, too, formed from the disposal of
spent cooking rock from a nearby baking pit rather than use as a refuse

122

060231_arch_testing_report

Volume 2: NRHP Testing Investigations within the Proposed 1060-Acre Vizcaya Development

heap. No evidence of a central pit was noted within the backhoe trench
through the center of this midden.
BRM-5 (Lower Midden Area of Site 41TV2265)
Shape:

Melted/deflated midden presumed to have once been a domed (Type I)
midden over a natural depression

Contents:

Dense amounts of artifacts (Type I); observed mussel shells (Type I)

Interpretation: Unlike all of the aforementioned middens, BRM-5 was found to contain
dense amounts of diagnostic artifacts scattered amongst considerably
sparser amounts of burned rock. The midden appears to have formed via
the natural and intentional deposition of cultural materials at this location
within the natural depression. In essence, the feature appears to be an
example of an aboriginal landfill as opposed to mounded accretions of
spent cooking rock. As the natural depression filled, a mound deposit
accreted over the pit, forming BRM-5. The main difference between this
midden and the 6 other assessed middens is the quantity of materials. In
this midden, artifact volumes were high, while burned rock, while present,
was only scattered throughout the feature matrices. In the other 6
middens, burned rock comprised the bulk of each midden and associated
artifacts were few. As such, BRM-5 is interpreted as being more of a
refuse heap (or landfill) that resulted from the deposition of waste
materials (including smaller amounts of burned rock) at this location. In
opposition, the other middens appear to have accreted almost solely from
the disposal of spent cooking rock resulting from baking activities.
In looking at the 7 investigated middens above, it is clear that 6 of the examples likely
resulted from plant baking activities and represent kitchen middens as opposed to general
refuse heaps. However, BRM-5 in the Lower Midden area of 41TV2265 contained copious
amounts of domestic debris and lesser amounts of burned rock, suggesting that it formed from
the use of the BRM-5 pit feature as a general refuse dump. If it had formed from plant baking
activities, one would expect to see considerably more burned rock within its matrices and
presumably fewer examples of domestic refuse. As such, while Black et al. (1997) and Weir
(1976) have delineated the various forms of documented middens as well as their contents, it
would appear that the overall shape of the midden is a relative thing given that various forces
serve to modify the deposits into the domed form with the exception of documented annular
middens that still retain their ring shape. It would also appear that the overall contents of
specific middens are more important in regard to discerning their function since a mound of
spent cooking rock and a mound of domestic refuse (inclusive of lesser amounts of spent
cooking rock) both appear as, simply put, mounds. What the current investigations have shown
is that yes, a large percentage of burned rock middens in Central Texas clearly accreted from
hot rock cooking. However, they have also shown that some also resulted from general refuse
disposal. And in this current case, from general refuse disposal in subsurface depressions. As
such, future investigations on Central Texas middens would do well to forego the assumption

HJN 060231 AR

123

Chapter 5.0: Discussion (Research Questions)

that an observed midden merely represents another mound of spent cooking rock and go to
greater lengths to determine whether it formed as a “kitchen” midden or as a general refuse
heap or trash midden.
Kitchen Midden vs. General Refuse Heap
During the midden investigations on site 41TV2263 and within the Upper Midden area of
site 41TV2265, all middens were found to be generally devoid of cultural materials aside from
the obvious spent cooking rock comprising the bulk of their matrices. In addition, the areas
surrounding these middens were also found to contain only sparse amounts of associated
artifacts. Assuming that the formation of the middens in these areas would have been
accompanied by numerous repeated or intense occupations at each site in order to account for
the volumes of exhausted cooking rock, it was hypothesized these 2 locations possibly
represented specialized activity areas (i.e., communal ovens or “kitchens”) that were located
away from a main encampment a short distance away. In doing so, the “kitchens” and the
prepared foodstuffs would be kept free from domestic refuse that would accrete within the living
area. Also, the actual living areas would be kept free of the smoke and soot produced by the
ovens. The location of these middens away from an obvious encampment, as well as the
overall lack of domestic detritus within them, suggests that they formed strictly from the
preparation and baking of foodstuffs within earth ovens or communal baking pits and the
subsequent disposal of spent cooking rock that would no longer hold heat rather than via
repeated disposal of daily refuse. If they had formed as general refuse heaps, one would
obviously expect to find considerable amounts of such materials in these middens, which was
not the case.
However, such domestic debris was found to comprise a large portion of the BRM-5 pit
feature matrices within the Lower Midden area of site 41TV2265, leading to the assessment that
this area may actually represent the encampment or living area associated with the
aforementioned off-site “kitchen” in the Upper Midden area of 41TV2265. The recovered artifact
assemblage from the Lower Midden area appears to reflect the day-to-day activities commonly
associated with an actual living area, and the materials from the BRM-5 pit feature, consisting of
both burned rock and general detritus (e.g., broken tools, projectile points, etc.), suggest that
the feature may have served as a specific refuse disposal area (i.e., a trash dump) during
prehistory. Unlike the middens in the Upper Midden area, the BRM-5 pit feature contained only
scattered burned rock rather than feature matrices consisting almost solely of burned rock. This
suggests that it did not form strictly from the discard of spent cooking rock. Also, while the
Upper Middens contained few associated artifacts, the BRM-5 pit feature contained a wide
variety of associated artifacts. These differences indicate that the BRM-5 pit feature represents
a general refuse heap or trash dump associated with the encampment rather than a feature
resulting from the use of the area as a “kitchen.”
Midden Substrate
As will be discussed in more detail in a later section, several middens documented in
Central Texas were found to have accreted over natural depressions, gullies, or karst features
(see 5.10). The lack of resistance met during the probing of BRM-5 within the Lower Midden

124

060231_arch_testing_report

Volume 2: NRHP Testing Investigations within the Proposed 1060-Acre Vizcaya Development

area of site 41TV2265 during the current investigations also suggested the potential for a similar
feature. As such, one avenue of investigation during the assessment of 7 middens was to
determine the types of surfaces on which these particular features accreted.
In the case of 41TV2263, the largest of the 3 middens onsite (BRM-1) was found to have
been constructed on the limestone bedrock of the site’s surface. The other 2 middens (BRM-2
and BRM-3) were also constructed on the surface of the site, although these 2 features were
located on the edges of slopes above the low order drainage that extends through the site. No
evidence of subsurface depressions was noted.
Similarly, the investigations on BRM-1 and BRM-2 within the Upper Midden area of site
41TV2265 also revealed that both middens were constructed on the limestone bedrock surface
of the site. Again, no evidence of subsurface depressions was noted.
In contrast, BRM-5 within the Lower Midden area of site 41TV2265 was found to actually
consist of a subsurface depression below a concentrated midden deposit. As posited earlier in
the text, the feature appears to have formed via natural tree throw. Over time, natural forces
and intentional refuse deposition within the depression served to completely fill in the feature.
Continued refuse disposal at this location eventually resulted in a mounded midden deposit over
the depression. As noted above, the middens on 41TV2263 and 41TV2265 appear to represent
2 differing types of middens: kitchen middens associated with plant baking in communal ovens
and general domestic refuse heaps. In the case of BRM-5, the presence of general domestic
detritus within the deposits (compared to the lack thereof in the other investigated middens)
suggest that the BRM-5 pit feature actually represents a general trash pit that the site occupants
utilized for the disposal of daily refuse: in essence, an aboriginal “landfill.”
Scavenging
In their documentation of the Heard Schoolhouse site (41UV86), Black et al. (1997)
suggest that Austin phase tool knappers had a penchant for scavenging and recycling Archaic
period artifacts from existing burned rock midden deposits. As middens often contain broken
and discarded tools within their matrices, it makes sense that later groups would seek out
concentrations of pre-thinned lithic specimens for further reduction and shaping into useful
implements. Such a practice would: 1) take advantage of existing resources present at prime
campsites scattered over the landscape; 2) save a trip to a raw lithic source or quarry; 3)
diminish the need for the initial stages of the biface thinning process (as well as the potential for
hard-hammer fracturing and wasted effort on a broken implement); and 4) serve to introduce
later materials into earlier middens. One such example of this practice was noted by Brownlow
(2004) during the investigations on site 41WM650. On this site, a sizeable burned rock midden
was found to have formed over a large, subsurface karst feature. Recovered projectile points
from the vertical extents of this midden feature indicated that the roughly 2.0-m thickness of
midden deposits had begun accreting as early as the Early Archaic period up through the Late
Prehistoric period. However, the 2 specimens of charred material recovered from the midden,
one of which was recovered from near the base of the karst feature, both produced Austin
phase age ranges. These 2 later specimens of charred materials found amidst considerably

earlier lithic implements was interpreted as evidence at the site that further supported Black et
al.’s (1997) Austin phase scavenging notion.
This phenomenon appears to also have manifested itself at both sites 41TV2263 and
41TV2265. In the case of 41TV2263, an Austin phase age range was produced from a humate
sample taken from the 10-20 cmbs level in BRM-1. Similarly, another humate sample from the
10-20 cmbs level of BRM-1 in the Upper Midden area of site 41TV2265 also produced an Austin
phase age range. As humate samples from the lower levels of both of these middens indicated
an earlier initiation of the midden deposits, the later Austin phase age ranges from their upper
extents would suggest some degree of either continued deposition or scavenging by later Austin
phase groups.
While Austin phase scavenging is somewhat inferred in the aforementioned middens
based on the produced radiocarbon assays, it appears to be considerably less subtle within the
BRM-5 pit feature within the Lower Midden area of site 41TV2265. In this feature, ample
evidence of an Austin phase presence was evidenced by 26 recovered Scallorn arrow points.
The bulk of these were recovered from the upper extents of the feature near or in the “hash”
zone covering the feature, although 1 specimen was recovered from a depth of 20 to 30 cmbs
within the pit feature. Other arrow points and arrow point preforms were also found scattered
throughout the vertical extent of the pit feature along with earlier dart points. In addition to the
temporally diagnostic Scallorn points, 3 of the 5 radiocarbon assays produced from materials
within the pit feature also produced Austin phase age ranges. These materials were recovered
from depths of 20 to 30 cmbs, 50 to 60 cmbs, and at the base of the feature at a depth of 110 to
120 cmbs. While the earlier dart point styles within the pit feature suggest an earlier inception of
the overall feature usage/formation, the presence of later Austin phase dates throughout its
vertical extent (and at its base) appear to reflect substantial Austin phase rummaging within the
depths of this feature and add further evidence to Black et al.’s (1997) conclusion regarding
Austin phase midden scavenging.

5.3

RESOURCE EXPLOITATION

The testing investigations on site 41TV2263 assessed the deposits of the 3 burned rock
middens on this site, while the investigations on site 41TV2265 assessed the deposits of 4 of
the 5 burned rock middens present on the site (2 of the 3 middens in the Upper Midden area
and the 2 middens within the Lower Midden area). As the development of burned rock middens
is primarily attributable to the use of heated rock as a heating element within earth ovens or
baking pits and the subsequent discard of “spent” rock that has broken into fragments incapable
of holding heat, it was anticipated that the middens on both sites would harbor remains of the
food sources that were being baked within the ovens alongside the rock.
Unfortunately, preservation was dismal in all of the assessed middens. No evidence of
any vertebrate faunal remains was recovered from any of the midden deposits during the
investigations. As such, while it can be assumed that the site inhabitants likely dined on deer,
rabbits, snakes, turtles, fish, and essentially any other animal that could be brought down or

126

060231_arch_testing_report

Volume 2: NRHP Testing Investigations within the Proposed 1060-Acre Vizcaya Development

caught, no direct evidence of this is contained within either of the sites’ deposits. However,
invertebrate remains (i.e., freshwater mussel shells) were quite common in the deposits of all
the assessed middens, suggesting that mussels comprised at least a portion of the protein
intake of the inhabitants of the site. In looking at Tables 4 and 11 in the previous chapter, it is
clear that mussel shell densities are dispersed throughout the levels of the middens, suggesting
that freshwater mussels were a sought-after and processed food source throughout the
occupations at the sites, at least during the periods of midden formation.
As far as exploited plant remains, only 2 small charred hardwood fragments comprise
the recovered macrobotanical remains. One specimen was recovered from BRM-1 on site
41TV2263, while the other was recovered from within the BRM-5 pit in the Lower Midden area
of site 41TV2265. These charred hardwood specimens undoubtedly represent fuel wood used
during the baking process that resulted in the burned rock midden accumulations rather than
actual food remains. As such, the plant materials consumed at the site can only be guessed at,
although the size of the middens on the sites suggest that geophytic plants likely comprised a
good portion of the diet. As geophytes require extended baking periods in order to reduce the
indigestible starches and inulin in the geophytic plants into digestible simple sugars, the
considerable amounts of burned rocks comprising the middens potentially represent numerous
such extended baking periods.
While the exploited resources at sites 41TV2263 and 41TV2265 can be assumed based
on those recovered from other sites in the region, the lack of preservation at these 2 sites
prohibits a detailed account of the resources exploited during their occupation.

5.4

SITE UTILIZATION AND INTRA-SITE PATTERNING

Although only testing investigations were conducted on sites 41TV2263 and 41TV2265,
the available data seem to have some potential to address how each site was utilized and also
suggest intra-site and inter-site patterning that may be relevant to future research. Because the
investigations focused on 2 distinct areas of site 41TV2265 (i.e., the Upper and Lower Midden
areas), this site will be addressed first in order to present a backdrop over which site 41TV2263
can be assessed.
Figure 61 depicts the Upper and Lower Midden areas on site 41TV2265 (see also Figure
5). The testing investigations within the Upper Midden area focused solely on BRM-1 and BRM2, with the bulk of the efforts placed over BRM-1. As discussed in Section 4.2 of this report, the
testing efforts on these 2 middens produced minimal amounts of domestic debris attributable to
a living/occupation area. Rather, the recovered data appear to reflect usage of the 2 middens
as a communal baking area or “kitchen” that was potentially located a short distance away from
an actual living area in an attempt to keep the area free of domestic detritus that would be an
undesirable inclusion within any foodstuffs. The size of the middens and the volumes of spent
cooking rock comprising them would suggest a rather intensive utilization of the area that would
require associated extended encampments in the general vicinity in order to account for the
accretion of the middens. So if the site occupants were not camping directly around the

middens (i.e., the kitchen), where were the associated encampments located? The initial
survey of site 41TV2265 did, in fact, document lithic debris and burned rock scattered over the
upland ridge comprising the Upper Midden area. Granted, as the site appears to have been
occupied throughout most of prehistory based on recovered projectile point styles, the debris
over the upland ridge undoubtedly represents the remnants of repeated short-term
encampments. However, the surface materials in the Upper Midden area were generally sparse
and scattered with the exception of areas in proximity to the middens and did not appear to
reflect encampments in the Upper Midden area that were intensive enough to account for the
midden accumulations. However, as exhibited in Section 4.3 in this document, considerable
quantities of domestic debris were recovered from the Lower Midden area of site 41TV2265.
This suggests that the Lower Midden area may actually represent the portion of the site where
the inhabitants camped and conducted most of the day-to-day activities, while the Upper
Midden area represents the communal oven or kitchen where foodstuffs were prepared. Again,
this separation of activity areas may reflect the desire to keep the prepared foods free of debris,
while it may also reflect the additional desire to place large earth ovens that potentially produced
smoke for extended periods away from the actual living areas.
The investigations within the Upper Midden area of 41TV2265 only addressed the
midden deposits and did not extend onto upland areas away from the middens. As such, it
cannot be firmly stated that associated encampment debris is not located around the upper
middens. However, the Upper Midden area is situated on an erosional upland ridge where
exposed limestone bedrock interspersed with only shallow soils is prolific. With this in mind, it is
likely that any associated encampments around the middens, if present, would have been
evidenced by dense surface deposits, which they were not. Conversely, the Lower Midden
area, which lies within the conservation pool of Lake Travis, has been completely stripped of
almost all soil deposits by wave action, leaving behind dense amounts of deflated cultural
deposits. This variance in visible artifact densities between the Upper and Lower Midden areas
is what led to the suggestion that these different portions of the site 41TV2265 may represent
distinct activity areas. While possibly being able to shed light on distinct activity areas over site
41TV2265 as a whole, the stripped surface of the Lower Midden area also presented a unique
opportunity for attempting to discern even more specific intra-site patterning within the Lower
Midden area itself.
During the testing investigations within the BRM-5 pit feature within the Lower Midden
area of site 41TV2265, numerous large artifacts were observed over the site’s surface
surrounding BRM-5. These larger artifacts consisted of manos, metate fragments, hammer
stones, and chert cores/blanks that were left resting on the deflated site surface once wave
action had filtered away all soil matrices. After stumbling over these artifacts for the majority of
the field effort, it was noticed that certain areas appeared to contain larger quantities of certain
artifacts such as manos, while other areas possessed larger quantities of different artifacts such
as hammer stones. This led to the notion that these observed differences of artifacts quantities
may actually represent specialized activity areas within the Lower Midden area. To test this
idea, the Lower Midden area was first divided into 4 arbitrary quadrants (NW, NE, SW, and SE).
These quadrants were delineated based on the 4 trenches placed in the cardinal directions over
BRM-5 (see Figure 61). Once the quadrants were established, each area was intensively

HJN 060231 AR

129

Chapter 5.0: Discussion (Research Questions)

surface-inspected and all of the larger artifacts (i.e., manos, metates, hammer stones,
cores/blanks) were collected for tabulation. Items such as debitage and non-descript lithic tool
specimens were not collected. The types and number of recovered artifacts are presented in
Table 14 and graphically presented in Figure 62.
As can be seen in Table 14 and Figure 62, by far the largest amount of plant-processing
implements (i.e., manos, metates, and choppers) were recovered from the eastern half of the
Lower Midden area, while hammer stones, cores/blanks, and projectile points were more
prevalent across the western half of the site. More specifically, the vast majority of recovered
artifacts are plant-processing artifacts recovered from the NE quadrant of the site. This
suggests that the bulk of plant-processing activities that occurred within the Lower Midden area
of site 41TV2265 took place in the northeastern portion of this area, with slight spill-overs into
the NW and SE quadrants. Conversely, the data appear to reflect that lithic reduction activities
occurred more in the western half of the site in the NW and SW quadrants. While quartzite
hammer stones occurred at the same frequency within the SW, NW, and NE quadrants, it is
quite conceivable that some of the specimens could also have been utilized as plant-processing
implements as well as lithic reduction tools, accounting for their frequency in the NW quadrant
where plant-processing activities appear to have been most prolific. Their presence in the
various quadrants could also be a factor of being dropped at various locations on the site during
shorter-term encampments during prehistory when distinct activity areas were not utilized.
Regardless, the artifact frequencies as a whole can be interpreted as rather distinct activity
areas on opposing sides of the Lower Midden area of the site. In addition, if one were to
assume that plant-processing activities were more of a female-dominated activity and lithicreduction activities were those dominated by males, the relative segregation of the implements
across the site could also be interpreted as evidence of a division of labor. If such were the
case, the increased amounts of plant-processing implements versus the lower amounts of lithicreduction implements would suggest that women spent a greater percentage of time camped at
the site, conceivably while males were away hunting. However, it should be reiterated that only
large, obvious artifacts were tabulated for this assessment, and no efforts were made to recover
and tabulate smaller artifacts such as debitage and other lithic implements that could reflect a
completely different scenario.
Utilizing the theory that the Upper Midden area of site 41TV2265 represents a separate
communal oven or kitchen activity area on the site while the Lower Midden area represents the
associated living area, the discussion now turns to nearby site 41TV2263 in an attempt to
determine its function. Recalling the discussion of 41TV2263 in Section 4.1, this site closely
resembles that of the Upper Midden area of site 41TV2265. A total of 3 burned rock middens
were documented on this site, all of which were essentially devoid of domestic debris. In
addition, very few associated artifacts were documented in the areas around and between the
middens aside from a few manos and metate fragments. In essence, the site lacked
considerable amounts of domestic refuse that one would anticipate with an intensive occupation
of the area. Rather, the site conforms more to the clean kitchen notion posited for the Upper
Midden area of site 41TV2265 and, as such, appears to be a specialized activity area
(communal oven/kitchen) that may also be located a short distance away from the actual living

area where denser amounts of domestic debris would be expected. In looking at Figure 63, it is
obvious that site 41TV2263 is located on the upland ridge of a landform immediately north of the
Upper Midden area of 41TV2265 across what once would have been a drainage (see also
Figure 3). Could its similar location on an adjacent landform suggest that this midden complex
is yet another “Upper Midden area” associated with an encampment (or “Lower Midden area)
located down slope to the east toward the channel of the Colorado River? Surface inspection
along the eastern portion of the upland ridge containing site 41TV2263 failed to produce any
additional cultural materials on the exposed limestone surface of the ridge. However, as can be
seen in Figure 63, the landform begins to slope sharply toward the channel of the river a short
distance east of the middens. Unfortunately, lake waters now cover the down slope areas, and
it cannot be currently ascertained whether lower terraces are present where aboriginal groups
utilizing the midden area may have made camp. If the Upper and Lower Midden areas of site
41TV2265 do, in fact, represent an established site patterning employed by the prehistoric
groups occupying the region, then it can be assumed that a similar “Lower Midden area” or at
least an encampment may be located somewhere near the middens on site 41TV2263. As
such, it may be prudent for future research pertaining to upland midden concentrations in this
area to also employ additional survey methods in an attempt to locate associated living areas.

5.5

CULTURAL INTERACTION AND TRADE

Evidence of interaction between different cultural groups and the trading of goods would
presumably manifest itself via the presence of exotic materials and non-local objects such as
imported lithic materials within the artifact assemblages of the sites. While the vast majority of
all recovered materials from both sites were local in nature, several specimens of Packsaddle
schist were recovered from site 41TV2265 during the investigations. These include a raw chunk
of the material recovered from the surface of the Lower Midden area during the testing
investigations, a groundstone specimen of the material recovered from the surface of the Lower
Midden area during the survey (see Figure 31 in Volume 1), and a small fragment recovered
from BRM 1 in the Upper Midden area during the survey. Packsaddle schist outcrops in Central
Texas are predominantly found in Llano County, primarily in the vicinity of Packsaddle
Mountain. Site 41TV2265 is located approximately 53 kilometers (km) southeast of Packsaddle
Mountain as the crow flies or 102 km downstream of Packsaddle Mountain on the Colorado
River.
The presence of specimens of Packsaddle schist on site 41TV2265 can be explained in
several ways. The specimens could suggest:
1. that the occupants of site 41TV2265 conducted seasonal rounds over a relatively
extensive area that included areas surrounding Packsaddle Mountain where
schist outcrops were present;
2. that special excursions to the source material were made either overland on foot
or possibly via canoes or boats up the Colorado River;

3. that the occupants of site 41TV2265 interacted and traded with other groups that
occupied areas containing the schist; or
4. that samples of the material were naturally transported downstream of
Packsaddle Mountain during high flows of the Colorado River.
Although the actual manner of how the schist specimens arrived on the site can never be
definitively stated, their presence does suggest the possibility of interaction and trade with
groups occupying the area where outcrops of the schist are present. However, the other 3
possibilities for explaining the material’s presence on site 41TV2265 seem equally plausible.

5.6

HUMAN INTERMENTS

No evidence of human interments within any of the investigated middens was
documented during the testing investigations on sites 41TV2263 and 41TV2265. Extensive
trenching through each midden was conducted, and, if burials had been present, it is likely that
they would have been exposed during the investigation. As such, it can be surmised that the
groups occupying the sites elected not to dispose of their dead within the midden deposits. It
could be argued that the lack of preservation may have erased any visible bone if interments
had been present. However, during the last period of low lake levels, the remains of a
prehistoric woman were exposed at site 41TV2242 within the conservation pool of Lake Travis
(Malof personal communication 2007). Similarly, preserved bison bones and human remains
were also documented at 41BT1, another submerged site on Lake Travis near Spicewood
(Malof personal communication 2007). This suggests that even inundated sites within the
conservation pool of Lake Travis retain some level of preservation and that the lack of human
remains within the middens of 41TV2263 and 41TV2265 (especially the middens in the Lower
Midden area of 41TV2265) may not be due to preservation factors.

5.7

ASSOCIATION OF THE LOWER MIDDEN AREA WITH THE UPPER MIDDEN AREA

During the initial survey-level assessment of site 41TV2265, a total of 5 burned rock
middens were observed on the site. Three of these (BRM-1, BRM-2, and BRM-3) are located
on the upland ridge of the landform above the conservation pool of Lake Travis (the Upper
Midden area), while the remaining 2 are located on a lower ridge closer to the confluence of Bee
Creek and the Colorado River within an area that is predominantly inundated by the lake waters
(the Lower Midden area). With the midden groupings at 2 different locations/settings on site
41TV2265, questions arose concerning their association. Did all 5 middens accrete at different
times during prehistory, potentially indicating varying landscape utilization patterns over time,
OR did they accrete during the same time periods but reflect differing uses (e.g., communal
ovens in 1 area of the site and refuse middens in other areas)?

134

060231_arch_testing_report

Volume 2: NRHP Testing Investigations within the Proposed 1060-Acre Vizcaya Development

The 2 radiocarbon assays produced from humate samples extracted from BRM-1 in the
Upper Midden area reflect the usage of this midden as early as Johnson’s (1995) Late Archaic II
period as well as a later Austin phase utilization. In addition, the recovery of 2 Pedernales
points from the BRM-1 contexts also suggests a possible Late Archaic I association. The
composition of BRM-1 and BRM-2 in the Upper Midden area was documented as consisting
almost entirely of burned rock and black midden soil with very few associated artifacts other
than mussel shell. The general lack of domestic detritus within these 2 middens suggests that
they functioned more as communal oven areas rather than dumps for general waste. The
presence of mussel shell within the midden contexts also suggests that mussels were a
common food source baked within the ovens. Unfortunately, preservation of other organic
materials within the midden deposits was essentially absent, disallowing for a determination of
what other types of plant and animal materials were cooked via the burned rocks.
In comparison, samples extracted from BRM-5 within the Lower Midden area also
produced radiocarbon assays reflective of a use of the midden during the Late Archaic II period
as well as the Austin and Toyah phases during the Late Prehistoric period. Although projectile
points styles recovered from the overall site indicate usage of the area sporadically over much
of prehistory, the similarities in the assays from BRM-1 and BRM-5 appear to reflect the
accretion and usage of the actual middens in both the Upper and Lower Midden areas during
the Late Archaic II and Late Prehistoric periods with a possible earlier use of BRM-1 during the
Late Archaic I period. However, as repeatedly stated in the earlier text, the perceived Late
Prehistoric association between the middens within the Upper and Lower Midden areas could
more accurately reflect a “mining” of their deposits by later scavenging groups that essentially
hit all the obvious middens on the site in search of lithic material or previously accumulated
stores of rock for baking. The same applies for the middens on nearby site 41TV2263, where
an Austin phase date was also recovered from the upper extents of BRM-1 on that site.
In contrast, the make-up of the BRM-1 and BRM-5 may reflect differing uses of the areas
on site 41TV2265. While BRM-5 within the Lower Midden area did contain evidence of mussel
baking amidst the burned rock similar to BRM-1 in the Upper Midden area, BRM-5 contained a
dense amount of domestic debris including lithic debitage, lithic tool fragments, and over 100
projectile points and point fragments. This suggests that, while some degree of mussel cooking
can be associated to BRM-5, it possibly served primarily as a refuse disposal area. This
differentiation between the 2 middens could further suggest that the Lower Midden area served
as more of a living area on the site with an available disposal area, while the Upper Midden area
potentially served as a communal baking area out of the way of the day-to-day activities.
Similarly, BRM-1 on site 41TV2263 was also found to be lacking in overall domestic debris,
suggesting that it too functioned as a communal oven rather than a refuse heap. The
associated areas on site 41TV2263 were found to also be generally lacking in overall domestic
debris aside from a few plant processing artifacts (i.e., manos, metate fragments, and nutting
stones). The lack of associated domestic debris suggests that the 3 middens at this nearby site
also served as a separate communal oven area away from a common living area, lending
support to the argument that the middens within the Upper and Lower Midden areas of site
41TV2265 represent differing functions as well as differing activity areas during the same
temporal periods.

COMPARISON OF 41TV2265 WITH 41TV22

Prior to the construction of Mansfield Dam and the flooding of the reservoir, A.T.
Jackson and A.M. Woolsey conducted archeological investigations on a nearby midden site,
41TV22 (Woolsey 1938). Their investigations focused on a burned rock midden that appears to
be anywhere from a short distance to the west of 41TV2265 up to 1.5 miles up Bee Creek from
41TV2265 (see Vol. 1). In all, their excavations totaled 10,000 cubic feet of midden deposits
and immediately surrounding areas. Their investigations of the midden on site 41TV22
produced a variety of artifact types from within the midden deposits, suggesting that the midden
itself served as a possible refuse midden like that of BRM 5 on site 41TV2265, rather than a
communal oven generally void of artifacts other than burned rock like the other 4 middens of
41TV2265 and those of 41TV2263. This suggests that a comparison of the 2 middens is
plausible.
Unfortunately, projectile point typology was only in its preliminary stages in the 1930s,
and the recovered projectile points from site 41TV22 were only assigned to 5 classes: Type 1
(indented base), Type 2a (constricted base with rudimentary barbs), Type 2b (constricted base
with definite barbs), Type 3 (expanded base), and Type 4 (triangular). These types appear to
be based solely on base shape, and there was no differentiation between dart and arrow point
styles or temporal affiliation. Similarly, their grouping of artifacts included certain categories like
“war club spikes” whose correlation with modern categorizations is questionable. However,
Woolsey’s (1938) report of the investigations on 41TV22 does provide totals of each recovered
artifact type that may at least be partially comparable to those of the current investigations. The
recovered materials from both sites are listed together in Table 15. In addition, although the
report is more of a laundry list of recovered materials, the final few pages do provide a brief
synopsis of the findings and allow for a few correlations to be drawn.
As can be seen in Table 15, the amount of recovered manos was quite similar at both
sites, although only 1 metate was recovered from 41TV22 while 25 metates/fragments were
recovered at 41TV2265. The number of manos (and the presumably the metate and “hoe
blades”) led Woolsey (1938) to conclude that the occupants of site 41TV22 relied on corn to
some degree as a dietary staple. He postulated that the specimens may have been used for
acorns or mesquite beans, but were likely used for corn. In light of the modern data, the use of
these implements for milling corn in Central Texas is doubtful at best, and they were likely used
for processing a variety of vegetal materials for consumption. Although the numbers of manos
at both sites is similar, the difference in the number of metates suggests that plant-milling
activities were more prominent at 41TV2265. This might correlate to the number of kitchen
middens or communal oven middens also present on site 41TV2265.
As is noted above, the 277 projectile points recovered from 41TV22 were grouped into 5
types based on shape. As the modern projectile point typologies were still in the preliminary
stages in the 1930s, it is essentially impossible to compare the point styles between the 2 sites,
as the points from 41TV22 were not even broken down into dart and arrow categories.
However, with a total of 277 recovered projectile points from 41TV22, it seems likely that the
styles spanned a good portion of prehistory. Woolsey (1938) does note that his specimen 115

is Folsom-like, reflecting a potential Paleo-Indian occupation at the site. In addition, Woolsey
(1938) also included line drawings of 2 recovered projectile points in his report. His specimen
28, if drawn to scale, appears to be a side-notched dart point with an expanding stem, similar to
a Late Archaic Ensor point. The second specimen, Specimen 19, is a parallel-sided lanceolate
point with a concave base that looks Plainview-like in shape. His illustration, along with a
similar example recovered from 41TV2265 during the survey efforts, are presented in Figure 64.
The similarities between these 2 specimens suggest that the person or group utilizing this style
of point possibly frequented both 41TV22 and 41TV2265, which is quite probable given the
relative proximity of the 2 sites.

Figure 64. Woolsey’s drawing of Specimen 19 and a similar specimen from 41TV2265
In the Table 15, Woolsey (1938) lists a total of 56 war club spikes. At first glance, this
author presumed that “spikes” possibly referred to small arrow points, since no differentiation of
arrows or darts was made in the assessment of the projectile points. However, Ed Baker of the
THC (personal communication 2007) indicated war club spikes were noted in several early
publications, including Jackson’s (1939) inventory of river basin sites. Baker (personal
communication 2007) added that Jackson’s inventory failed to list any thick bifaces, preforms, or
quarry blanks, and that a photo of a war club spike actually appeared to be a thick biface/blank.
However, Woolsey did list 57 “blanks” in addition to his 56 war club spikes. While the difference
between the 2 is currently unclear, the total of 113 blanks/war club spikes does somewhat
correspond to the total of 85 bifaces/biface fragments recovered from 41TV2265. Regardless,
bifaces of various forms would be expected at a repeatedly occupied campsite and obviously
reflect some degree of similarly anticipated lithic reduction on the site.
Woolsey (1938) reported the recovery of 16 net sinkers from 41TV22. It is unclear if
these were possible Waco sinkers or other types of rocks with indications of notches or grooves
capable being wrapped with netting cordage. However, the presence of net sinkers suggests
that the groups occupying site 41TV22 practiced some level of aquatic resource exploitation
requiring the use of nets (e.g., turtles and fish). By way of comparison, no examples of net
sinkers were recovered from 41TV2265, possibly suggesting less of a focus on such resources
at this site. The discrepancy of this type of artifact between the 2 sites could be due to Woolsey
(1938) assigning this label to specimens that were not actually net sinkers (akin to “war club
spikes”), an actual difference in resource exploitation practices represented at each site, or the
limited amount of excavation at site 41TV2265.
Although a discrepancy in the number of net sinkers between the 2 sites exists and
suggests possible differences in resource exploitation, Woolsey (1938) noted that “plenty of
mussel shells indicating a mussel diet were found.” The presence of large amounts of mussel
shells at both sites does reflect the fact that mussels were a prominent part of the diet at both
sites. As such, one could surmise that the exploitation of mussels at both sites would also
suggest a probable harvesting of other aquatic resources such as turtles and fish and that the
lack of net sinkers on 41TV2265 is due to other reasons other than differing resource
exploitation practices.

While briefly discussing the mussels on site 41TV22, Woolsey (1938) noted that “plenty
of mussels . . . were found, but no bones were encountered.” He concluded that either the
inhabitants of the site ate no meat or that the site was inhabited so long ago that they bones had
decayed. He opted for the latter explanation. Similarly, no faunal materials other than mussel
shell were recovered from 41TV2265. Initial assumptions were that the inundation of the site
had led to an increased rate of decomposition for such materials, leaving behind no remains.
However, as the work on 41TV22 occurred prior to the construction of Lake Travis, that site had
never been inundated but still lacked preserved skeletal materials. This suggests that the
deposits of site 41TV2265 may have also been lacking in preservation even before the site’s
inundation.
One of the biggest discrepancies in the recovered assemblage is between the numbers
of scrapers, gouges, drills, spokeshaves, choppers (fist axes), and hammer stones. While this
could be due to differences in typologies, these tool types are generally straight forward and
more likely suggest a difference in the types of domestic activities performed at each site. In the
case of 41TV22, essentially all of these tool types (with the exception of hammer stones and
drills) greatly outnumber those found at 41TV2265. The scrapers, gouges, spokeshaves, and
choppers may all suggest that hide working and woodworking were prominent activities during
certain periods at 41TV22, but were less common at 41TV2265. Similarly, the number of net
sinkers from 41TV22 also suggests that fishing was possibly a popular activity. By way of
comparison, the decreased numbers of the same materials at 41TV2265 coupled with the large
amount of metate fragments as noted above may suggest that plant-milling activities were more
prominent at some point during the occupation of 41TV2265.
Finally, Woolsey (1938) notes that 1 pendant of Packsaddle schist with a hole drilled in it
for suspension was recovered during the investigations on site 41TV22. Although no pendants
were recovered from 41TV2265, a small specimen of Packsaddle schist was recovered from the
Upper Midden area of 41TV2265 during the survey, as was a groundstone specimen of the
material from the Lower Midden area. In addition, a raw chunk of Packsaddle schist was
recovered from the surface of the Lower Midden area of 41TV2265 during the testing
investigations. This suggests that the same groups utilizing the material frequented both sites
or that different groups at the sites sought after this material to some degree. Its presence at
both sites, as well as the distance to the outcroppings of the material, also suggests some level
of value or desire for this particular material during prehistory.

5.9

HIGH SURFACE ARTIFACT DENSITY = BURIED MIDDENS

One of the questions that the Lower Midden area of site 41TV2265 was thought most
capable of addressing was whether a high density of surface artifacts suggests a buried
midden. This hypothesis had originally been posited by Voellinger and Gearhart (1987)
following their investigations on sites 41WM312 and 41WM632 in nearby Williamson County.
They noticed that surface artifact densities had a tendency to increase by varying degrees in the
vicinity of visible burned rock middens. Subsequently, they reasoned that areas of high surface
artifact density that were not adjacent to a visible midden may indicate the presence of a buried
midden. With Voellinger and Gearhart’s (1987) recommendation in mind, Brownlow (2004) set

HJN 060231 AR

139

Chapter 5.0: Discussion (Research Questions)

out to test this hypothesis on site 41WM650, another midden site that had also been
documented within the Block House Creek development by Voellinger and Gearhart (1987).
During testing investigations on site 41WM650, Brownlow (2004) noted an area of the site with
a high density of surface lithic materials (i.e., chert debitage and flaked stone implements) and
subsequently placed a series of backhoe trenches and test units over the area. These
investigations revealed the presence of a buried annular midden, suggesting that Voellinger and
Gearhart’s (1987) hypothesis was correct.
During Horizon’s earlier survey efforts on the Lower Midden area of site 41TV2265, an
area of high surface artifact density was observed over an area where a pokey rod extended to
a considerable depth. To again test Voellinger and Gearhart’s (1987) hypothesis, Horizon first
conducted a series of 10 “dog leash” surface scrapes to determine the densities of surface
artifacts at select locations over the surface of this portion of the site. These dog leash scrapes
were placed over the center of the suspected buried midden where a visible high density of
surface artifacts was observed as well as at 9 other locations over the surface of the Lower
Midden area (see Figure 9).
As stated in the Methodology chapter, only flaked stone
implements were tabulated to establish densities due to the overwhelming nature of debitage
and other artifacts present on the surface of the deflated site. The results of the dog leash
scrapes are summarized in Table 16 and graphically presented in Figure 65.
As can be seen from Table 16 and Figure 65, the greatest density of surface artifacts
were documented around the Center Stake of what was then a suspected buried midden (and
later labeled BRM-5). In all, a total of 16 flaked lithic implements were recovered from the
surface of the Center Stake location, more than double that of the next largest density of 7
implements from DL-5. It should be noted that DLs 1 to 9 all utilized a 2.0-m diameter (3.14 m2)
dog leash scrape, while only a 1.0-m diameter (0.79 m2) dog leash scrape occurred around the
Center Stake. With this in mind, an area roughly 1/4 the size of each of the other 9 dog leash
scrapes produced more than twice the amount of artifacts than the next nearest quantity.
Furthermore, it can be surmised that, had an equivalent area been scraped around the Center
Stake, then 4 times the amount of artifacts (64) might have been produced. Regardless of the
actual total, the highest density of surface artifacts clearly rested over an area suspected to
contain a buried midden.
To confirm or deny the presence of the suspected buried midden, a total of 4 backhoe
trenches were excavated in the cardinal directions around the Center Stake (see Figure 9). As
discussed in the results of the investigations on the Lower Midden area of site 41TV2265, these
4 trenches in fact revealed the presence of the extensive pit/midden feature labeled BRM-5.
The presence of the buried midden confirms Voellinger and Gearhart’s (1987) hypothesis that
high surface artifact densities may equate to a buried midden. This represents the second test
case in which this hypothesis has been proven, the first case being that presented by Brownlow
(2004) during the investigations on site 41WM650.
Turning to the surface artifact densities of the dog leash scrapes away from the Center
Stake location, the next highest density was recovered from DL-5.
DL-5 is located
approximately 30 m north northeast of the Center Stake and could conceivably be identified as

a second location where the potential for a buried midden exists. However, the surface scrape
at this location revealed only the presence of shallow limestone bedrock with no potential for
buried deposits. However, BRM-4, a small burned rock midden on this landform, is located only
a short distance northeast of DL-5 and northwest of DL-4 (see Figure 9). During investigations
within the Block House Creek Development, Voellinger and Gearhart (1987) noticed that
surface artifact densities had a tendency to increase by varying degrees in the vicinity of visible
burned rock middens. With this in mind, second (DL-5) and third (DL-4) highest surface artifact
densities within the Lower Midden area can be attributed to their proximity to BRM-4.

5.10

USE OF DEPRESSIONS, PITS, AND SINKHOLES AS MIDDENS

The disposal of domestic refuse is a common daily occurrence. Today, most citydwellers deposit refuse in a trash can or other receptacle. This refuse is then collected on a
larger scale and typically dumped into city landfills, which in essence are large pits in the ground
that are eventually covered to encapsulate the rubbish. Similar, smaller scale features also dot
the rural landscape on farms and ranches where, historically and in modern times, no collection
service was/is available. In these instances, refuse is often deposited in mechanically
excavated pits, natural gullies, cave openings, and other karst features, where it is then either
burned or merely left to decompose. While the aboriginal groups in Central Texas undoubtedly
tossed a large portion of their refuse across the natural landscape during periods of movement,
one would think it logical that groups that camped in one location for an extended period of time
would have a refuse disposal area rather than littering the entire encampment with detritus.
Clearly, the ubiquitous nature of burned rock middens in Central Texas touts the fact that the
spent rock was often dumped on an ever-accreting heap/middens. Certain burned rock
middens also often contain other general domestic detritus, suggesting that refuse disposal in
select areas was a common aboriginal practice. While many of these middens are evidenced
by mounded deposits of burned rock and refuse that are often visible, small scale topographic
features on the landscape, at least a handful of the documented burned rock middens in Central
Texas appear to have developed from the use of a natural pit, depression, or sinkhole as,
basically, small landfills.
In his documentation of 3 prehistoric sites on Fort Hood (41BL740, 41CV71, and
41CV1165), Trierweiler (1995 and 1996) documented associated sinkholes on each of these 3
sites, although none were covered with midden deposits. However, investigations at 41BL349,
also on Fort Hood, did document a large, domed burned rock midden that had accreted over a
small natural gully (Mehalchick et al. 2003). This feature at 41BL349 was assessed as having
originated on the bank of the gully with materials naturally eroding downslope and gradually
filling the gully. Over time, subsequent use of the location for refuse disposal resulted in
additional deposition episodes on the midden that eventually completely covered the underlying
gully with a mounded deposit of burned rock and other cultural materials.
Closer to 41TV2265, Voellinger and Gearhart (1987) documented 2 small solution
cavities filled with burned rock and discarded lithic tools below Midden 1 on site 41WM312
within the Block House Creek Development. These 2 solution cavities below the midden on this

142

060231_arch_testing_report

Volume 2: NRHP Testing Investigations within the Proposed 1060-Acre Vizcaya Development

site were small holes rather than large cavities, but it is conceivable that the incipient stages of
the overlying midden resulted from the initial use of the small solution cavities as refuse disposal
areas. As refuse deposition continued, the cavities filled in. Subsequent use of the location for
disposal eventually resulted in the formation of the overlying midden.
A similar phenomenon, although on a much larger scale, was also documented by
Brownlow (2004) on site 41WM650 located only a short distance from Voellinger and Gearhart’s
(1987) Midden 1 on site 41WM312. On site 41WM650, backhoe trenching efforts within a large
domed midden revealed the presence of an underlying karst feature measuring roughly 8.0 m in
diameter and 1.5 m deep. This natural karst feature had become completely filled with burned
rock and other domestic lithic debris, and continued dumping episodes at this location resulted
in the formation of a roughly 0.5-m-high mound of midden deposits over the in-filled karst
feature. Recovered projectile point styles from within the midden deposits suggested that the
karst feature had been utilized for refuse disposal as early as the Early Archaic period and had
continued to accrete over time. However, 2 radiocarbon assays produced from materials
recovered within the karst feature produced Late Prehistoric (Austin phase) age ranges. The
presence of materials with these later dates was attributed to the scavenging of later groups
within the midden deposits for recyclable materials.
Regarding the current investigations, the BRM-5 pit feature within the Lower Midden
area of site 41TV2265 appears to represent another example of the aboriginal use of a natural
pit for refuse disposal. As presented within the text, the BRM-5 pit feature is assessed as
having formed via the toppling of a small motte of trees. This tree throw episode resulted in the
creation of a natural crater left when soil and substrate tangled within the uprooted tree roots
were ripped away (see Figure 55). Subsequent aboriginal occupations on the landform
produced domestic debris that likely washed into the void naturally and that was also
deliberately deposited into the depression by the site occupants. Much like the middens
documented by Mehalchick et al. (2003) and Brownlow (2004), continued use of the area for
refuse disposal resulted in the eventual in-filling of the depression as well as the subsequent
formation of a mounded midden deposit over the depression. Then, as discussed previously,
the historic inundation of the feature resulted in a melting of the mounded midden deposits into
more of a “midden pancake” over the surface of the depression.
As can be seen from the earlier documented instances of midden accretion of natural
depressions or cavities, as well as from the example of the BRM-5 pit feature assessed during
the current investigations, aboriginal groups in Central Texas, at least in certain instances,
practiced the disposal of refuse (inclusive of spent cooking rock) within what can be termed as
“natural landfills.” Clearly, the countless burned rock middens that dot the landscape reflect
aboveground examples of this aboriginal practice, but documented subsurface examples are
considerably rarer. Given the few prehistoric examples in Central Texas presented above, as
well as the observable historic and modern usage of large “holes in the ground” for refuse
disposal, it seems evident that the disposal of trash in either natural or manmade
holes/depressions/gullies/etc. is a practice relatively common to human groups. As such, it is
hoped that the examples of the use of natural subsurface depressions for refuse disposal
presented above will add to the development of future research designs and investigation

HJN 060231 AR

143

Chapter 5.0: Discussion (Research Questions)

strategies pertaining to burned rock middens, and that the resulting documentation will produce
additional examples of this increasingly evident aboriginal practice.

5.11

EROSIONAL EFFECTS ON INUNDATED SITES

One of the key research questions that the Lower Midden area of site 41TV2265 was
primed to address is in regard to the erosional effects that fluctuating reservoir levels have on
archeological sites inundated within the conservation pool of Lake Travis. The Lower Midden
area of site 41TV2265, located between the elevations of approximately 655 and 665 feet amsl,
has been routinely inundated over the last 70 years since the construction of Mansfield Dam.
This inundation originally resulted in a deterioration of all protective vegetative cover across the
site. Fluctuating lake levels over time then caused this portion of the site to become exposed to
both wave action and surface runoff, essentially resulting in a complete denuding of the area of
any intact soil/cultural deposits that may have once existed on the site. In their National
Reservoir Inundation Study, Lenihan et al. (1981) sum these actions up by stating:
Unfortunately, the “effective” beach zone of most reservoirs is significantly
increased by seasonal fluctuations in the reservoir pool level, which may significantly
enhance the destructive potential of wave action. As the reservoir pool level draws down,
breaking waves strike the saturated and unconsolidated sediments of the reservoir basin
which have already been deprived of a protective vegetative cover. These fragile
sediments are susceptible not only to wave erosion but also to subsequent wind and
water runoff erosion within the exposed drawdown zone.

Within their reservoir inundation study, Lenihan et al. (1981) compiled the results of
numerous studies on archeological sites within the shoreline zones of 15 different reservoirs
across the county including 3 in California, 2 in New Mexico, 2 in Missouri, and 1 each in
Washington, Utah, Texas, Montana, Iowa, West Virginia, Arkansas, Tennessee. Several of the
broader conclusions derived by their study are presented below, followed by a discussion of
how these relate to the Lower Midden Area of site 41TV2265.
1) Wave action on sites near the maximum pool elevation has resulted in the erosion and
redeposition of loosely consolidated soils, charcoal, bone, and other light-weight materials and
the consolidation of heavier cultural materials.
Although the Lower Midden area of site 41TV2265 is not located near the maximum pool
elevation of Lake Travis (i.e., 681 feet amsl), it is located just below the average pool elevation
of 671 feet amsl. As Lake Travis is typically not full, the location of the Lower Midden area near
the average pool elevation can be viewed as comparable to those sites studied near the
maximum pool elevations of other reservoirs.
As can be seen in Figure 66, essentially all soil and light-weight materials have been
eroded from the site, leaving behind only the larger/heavier/denser materials. The sifting away
of the lighter soils and materials has produced a deflated site surface covered with a
condensation of all lithic materials (both cultural and natural) that were once contained within

BRM-4

BRM-5

Figure 66. General view of the eroded surface in the Lower Midden area on site 41TV2265

the stratigraphy of the soils. As a result, any cultural materials that were once temporally
stratified have become intermingled on the deflated surface. In addition, any smaller cultural
features have also been disintegrated. In the case of any larger features such as mounded
burned rock middens, one would be hard pressed to identify either of the 2 burned rock middens
within the Lower Midden area of site 41TV2265 seen in Figure 66 if they had not been
delineated on the figure. This is due to the fact that even the middens on this site have been
severely deflated by wave action, leaving behind “melted” midden areas consisting of generally
flat areas with dense quantities of burned rock, lithic tools, and debitage. For an idea of the
degree of surface artifact concentration resulting from such “melted” middens, the reader is
referred back to Section 5.9 where surface artifact densities are discussed. The fact that the
surface deposits within the Lower Midden area of site 41TV2265 exhibited intensive erosion and
deflation down to bedrock affirms Lenihan et al.’s (1981) conclusions that wave action causes
severe erosion and redeposition on inundated sites and suggests that other sites within beach
zone settings along Lake Travis have also experienced similar detrimental impacts.
Generally speaking, the erosion of all soil from an archeological site and the co-mingling
of all the previously stratified deposits would initially suggest that sites within the beach zone of
a reservoir are likely to have been reduced to relatively useless concentrations of intermingled
deposits. However, in rare cases such as BRM-5 within the Lower Midden area of site
41TV2265, the deflation and concentration of heavier surface materials may have actually

HJN 060231 AR

145

Chapter 5.0: Discussion (Research Questions)

resulted in the capping and preservation of a unique feature. As discussed earlier in the text,
BRM-5 within the Lower Midden area of site 41TV2265 appears to have accreted over a large
pit feature within the site. Although soil deposits over the surface of the site were stripped away
by wave action, the deflation and concentration of the midden materials over the pit effectively
formed a rock armor over the deposits within the pit, sealing them inside and deterring any
erosional effects. This would at first appear to bode well for the deposits within the pit as well as
those within pits on other inundated sites, if present. However, as will be discussed shortly in
the following text, remnant soils on inundated sites are often the primary target of both terrestrial
and aquatic burrowing animals, and, as such, are almost as jumbled as the deflated surface
contexts.
2) Midden deposits appear to be the most susceptible to adverse impacts by inundation. In
several observed instances, mounded midden deposits were completely leveled at shoreline
locations. In addition, burrowing ground squirrels and rodents were found to commonly target
the loosely consolidated midden deposits when exposed, while burrowing clams acted similarly
when the middens were submerged. In turn, raccoons and other scavengers then targeted the
clams within the exposed midden deposits.
As noted above and exhibited in Figure 66, BRM-4 and BRM-5 within the Lower Midden
area of site 41TV2265 were documented as essentially “melted” middens that had been
reduced to flattened areas of concentrated burned rock and artifacts. It is presumed that these
2 middens once were more mounded in nature given the fact that other middens on the site
above the conservation pool were of the domed variety. As large portions of this type of midden
consist of dense amounts of black midden soil, it seems safe to assume that such midden soils
were stripped away along with all the other soil on the site, leaving behind the melted remains of
burned rock and other lithic materials. These 2 leveled middens again affirm the first part of this
conclusion presented by Lenihan et al. (1981).
As for the second portion of their conclusion (i.e., burrowing animals commonly target
midden deposits on inundated sites), the test unit excavation within the BRM-5 pit deposits
within the Lower Midden area produced evidence of numerous rodent burrows throughout the
pit deposits (Figures 67 through 69). In fact, these burrows were so pervasive throughout the
deposits that large areas within the test units often collapsed during excavation. In 1 instance, a
large area within the central balk left within the pit collapsed during the excavation of the
backhoe trenches within the pit (Figure 67). These burrows were often infilled with loose, sandy
deposits that differed from the surrounding loamy clay soils. While terrestrial animal burrows
were prolific within the midden deposits, countless specimens of Asian clam were also
recovered throughout the vertical extent of the pit during test pit excavation. As Asian clams are
an introduced species to the region, their presence within the pit matrices is a modern
occurrence and attests to the targeting of the midden deposits by this aquatic species. With this
in mind, the second part of Lenihan et al.’s (1981) conclusion is also confirmed within site
41TV2265. It was noted above that subsurface pit features had the potential to become capped
by the heavy materials that deflated over the surface of the feature. While this may actually be
the case, such capping appears to be relatively ineffective against the onslaught of burrowing
animals, and, as such, it is surmised that any similar features within the conservation pool of
Lake Travis have also suffered similar bioturbation.

3) In most assessed sites, small, lightweight materials were generally sparse, while large,
dense artifacts (e.g. groundstone) were overabundant.
After considerable surface inspection over the Lower Midden area of site 41TV2265, the
observed surface assemblage tends to support Lenihan et al.’s (1981) conclusion that
lightweight materials are generally sparse and larger artifacts are overabundant on inundated
sites. Based solely on a visual assessment of the site’s surface, it was obvious that larger
implements such as manos, metate fragments, hammer stones, and larger flake tools such as
choppers were prolific across the site amongst the limestone cobbles covering the surface.
These materials were so abundant that they were collected toward the end of the field session
and then tabulated in an attempt to define activity areas within the site (see Section 5.4). Of the
recovered materials, the vast majority are indeed groundstone specimens.
While groundstone implements and other larger domestic artifacts were prevalent on the
site’s surface, large projectile points were clearly lacking, although several were recovered from
subsurface contexts. The absence of such larger points on the deflated site surface is
undoubtedly the result of their collection by looters, as looting evidence was plainly visible on
portions of the site, especially in the vicinity of BRM-5. As such, while Lenihan et al.’s (1981)

148

060231_arch_testing_report

Volume 2: NRHP Testing Investigations within the Proposed 1060-Acre Vizcaya Development

conclusion above is primarily correct, it can also be further concluded that, in addition to small
lightweight materials, large projectile points are also generally sparse on eroded inundated sites
due to their visibility to looters on the site surfaces.
In regard to the general sparseness of small, lightweight materials on deflated sites, the
test excavations within the Lower Midden area of site 41TV2265 produced amble evidence of
small lightweight lithics in surface or near surface contexts, including numerous small arrow
points. Clearly, botanicals and other lightweight specimens such as bone likely floated away
during the inundation of the site. However, it can be firmly stated that a good percentage of the
lithic materials, including small flakes, may actually settle in place. Their lack of visibility is likely
due to their deposition among larger cobbles that obscure them from view as well as their
inclusion within the “hash” zone on the surface of the site resulting from wave action.
4) Wave generated mechanical impacts to several assessed sites revealed deflation rates of
over 2 cm per year. On certain sites, wave action had completely stripped all original site
matrices, some in excess of 1.0 m in depth based on exposed tree stumps still rooted in the
substrate.
As can be seen in Figure 70, the surface of the Lower Midden area of site 41TV2265
can be at least in part be described by Lenihan et al.’s (1981) statement that wave action has
completely stripped all original site matrices, leaving behind only a deflated surface covered by
limestone cobbles. As for how much matrix once covered the site and contained the cultural
deposits, this remained undefined until the Project Geomorphologist noticed the presence of
numerous cedar stumps still rooted in the substrate of the site during the geomorphological
investigations. Upon an examination of the stumps, it became obvious that they represented
the remnants of cedar stands that had been intentionally sawn down prior to the flooding of the
reservoir. Since these stumps were present on the landform prior to inundation, the Project
Geomorphologist first assessed the soil level on extant cedar stands within the upland portion of
the site and then applied the same estimated soil level to those of the cedar stumps within the
Lower Midden area. Figures 71 and 72 show a comparison of mature cedar in a non-inundated
upland setting (note the level of the soil at the point where the roots start to diverge from the
trunk) with cedar stumps on the eastern side of the Lower Midden area that show clear
evidence of soil erosion. The horizontal lines in Figure 72 show the approximate position of the
point on the roots where the measurement was made to estimate soil loss associated with wave
erosion. However, to make this measurement, the gravel armor clearly visible around these
stumps was removed by excavation until the top of the remaining soil was exposed.
Measuring down from the estimated soil level on the cedar stumps to the current
deflated surface, it was deduced that approximately 17.0 to 22.0 cm of soil had been removed
from this portion of the site by wave action since its initial inundation in the 1930s (see
Geomorphological Observations in Section 4.3.3). Utilizing Lenihan et al.’s (1981) estimated
deflation rate of 2 cm per year, it can be assumed that the entire surface of the site had been
completely deflated in roughly 10 years (late 1940s), leaving the surviving cultural materials to
be washed over the site (or off the site), picked over by surface collectors, and destroyed by

exposure. Conversely, if one assumes a gradual stripping of the site over the last 70 years of
inundation, the loss of 17.0 to 22.0 cm of soil from the site equates to about 2.5 to 3.1 mm of
soil loss per year over the approximately 70-year period of impoundment. Since the original
depth of the soil deposits on the site prior to inundation is an unknown, the actual rate of soil
removal cannot be firmly determined, although the current findings coupled with those of
Lenihan et al. (1981) would suggest a range between 0.3 cm and 2.0 cm of soil removal per
year.
As this location was an upland ridge prior to inundation, the removal of 17.0 to 22.0 cm
of soil from the sites seems to be an acceptable, if not slightly high estimate of the depth of the
soil deposits on the site. Other upland ridges in the overall project area generally consisted of
extremely shallow soils over limestone bedrock or exposures of limestone bedrock as is typical
of the Texas Hill County. The generally shallow depth of roughly 20 cm would suggest that the
majority of the Lower Midden area of site 41TV2265 (aside from the BRM-5 pit feature) could
have only contained shallow to surficial cultural deposits that would likely have exhibited little to
no temporal stratification even prior to inundation. The documented co-mingling of cultural
materials spanning most of prehistory on the modern site surface, while exacerbated by
deflation, was potentially already present early during the site’s history due to the lack of alluvial
deposits within the upland, erosional setting of the site. This would suggest that, in the absence
of the BRM-5 pit feature, site 41TV2265 would likely have been considered to be yet another

surficial upland site with little potential to add to our knowledge of the prehistory of the area.
However, the presence of the BRM-5 pit on this particular site can serve as an eye-opener to
future researchers who might choose to nonchalantly ignore such upland sites with the
assumption that they have little to offer. While the BRM-5 pit feature on this inundated site
appears to have lost a considerable degree of integrity due to clam and rodent burrowing after
inundation, its presence posits the question of whether other similar pit features are present on
un-inundated upland landforms in the region and if such features should be prospected for prior
to determining surficial upland sites as insignificant.

5.12

PRESERVATION OF ORGANICS AFTER INUNDATION

Because the Lower Midden area of site 41TV2265 has been routinely inundated over
roughly the last 70 years since the construction of Mansfield Dam, this portion of the site would
appear ideal to address whether inundated sites within the conservation pool of Lake Travis
retain any preservation of organic materials. Has the inundation of the sites led to an
accelerated deterioration of organic remains, or has it served to preserve them? Based on both
laboratory experiments and field assessments, Lenihan et al. (1981) concluded that sites within
reservoir settings possess differential degrees of preservation. They note that, in laboratory
studies, all material categories, with the exception of lithics, exhibited some degree of
deterioration after exposure to normal and concentrated chemical solutions. Similarly, samples
of the same materials exhibited similar degrees of deterioration when placed in a reservoir
setting. However, they note that data from assessed archeological sites that had been
inundated were inconclusive. This was primarily due to the lack of investigations on the sites
prior to inundation in order to develop a baseline of the preservation at each. Although some
sites exhibited no preservation after being submerged for 20 years, it remained unclear if these
sites even possessed preserved materials prior to their inundation.
Unfortunately, no baseline data pertaining to the degree of preservation prior to
inundation exists for the Lower Midden area of site 41TV2265, since the site is newly recorded.
As such, proffering any sort of conclusion regarding the effects of inundation on organic
materials within this area of the site based on the currently recovered data is not logical.
However, the recovered data can specifically address the current status of preservation at the
site and how it affects the overall significance of the site’s deposits. Moreover, the data from the
Lower Midden area can be compared to those of the Upper Midden area of site 41TV2265 and
nearby site 41TV2263, both of which are in typically un-inundated areas, in an attempt to
discern whether preservation factors differ among the areas above and below the conservation
pool of Lake Travis, at least at this general locality on the lake.
Looking first at faunal material, no vertebrate faunal remains (i.e., bone) of any sort were
recovered during the investigations within the Lower Midden area of site 41TV2265, although
freshwater mussel shells were common. This would at first suggest that inundation may have
served to decompose any bone specimens that might have once been present in this area of
the site, leaving behind only mussel shell. However, investigations within BRM-1 in the Upper
Midden area of site 41TV2265 and within BRM-1 on site 41TV223 also failed to produce any

152

060231_arch_testing_report

Volume 2: NRHP Testing Investigations within the Proposed 1060-Acre Vizcaya Development

animal bone specimens but did similarly produce mussel shell specimens. This suggests that
either mussels were the primary protein processed/consumed at these locations and vertebrate
fauna were not on the menu (unlikely) or that preservation factors at all 3 locations were similar
(similarly low) regardless of inundation. As aboriginal peoples of the area are known to have
dined on a wide variety of vertebrate fauna, it seems evident that the lack of preserved bone at
the 3 locations is due to similar preservation factors and that the inundation of the Lower Midden
area of site 41TV2265 cannot be viewed as the cause. A more probable cause of the poor
preservation is the fact that all 3 locations once consisted of upland hilltops/ridges in erosional
settings throughout prehistory and up until the construction of Mansfield Dam in the 1930s.
None of the 3 locations possess deeply buried alluvial deposits capable of covering and sealing
the cultural deposits and subsequently preserving them. The exposure of the deposits to the
elements (and to later occupants of the sites) is seen as the probable cause of the poor
preservation that is consistent between the 3 locations both above and below the conservation
pool in this specific area. However, this cannot be expanded to all sites within the reservoir.
While 41TV2263 and 41TV2265 exhibit poor preservation, as did nearby site 41TV22 (Woolsey
1938), other sites within the reservoir do appear to retain higher levels of bone preservation. As
noted previously, the remains of a prehistoric woman were exposed at site 41TV2242 within the
conservation pool of Lake Travis (Malof personal communication 2007) and preserved bison
bones and human remains were also documented at 41BT1, another submerged site on Lake
Travis near Spicewood (Malof personal communication 2007). It is unclear at this time if the
preserved bone specimens at these 2 sites were recovered from upland settings similar to those
of 41TV2263 and 41TV2265 or if they were found within sealed alluvial settings.
Turning to the preservation of charred plant remains, only 1 charred hardwood fragment
was noted within the matrix sample extracted from within BRM-5 in the Lower Midden area of
site 41TV2265. While a few charcoal samples were also recovered during the excavation of the
test units within the BRM-5 pit, these specimens were all small and extremely sparse within the
deposits. As charred plant materials are typically light-weight and buoyant, it is suspected that a
large percentage of any preserved, charred specimens that may have once been present
floated out of the deposits during inundation, with burrowing clams and wave action serving to
agitate the deposits and bear them away akin to a giant flotation machine used to process
matrix samples. However, like the bone material, it is unclear how much, if any, charred
materials were present within the deposits prior to inundation. Two analyzed matrix samples
from BRM-1 in the Upper Midden area of site 41TV2265 failed to produce any preserved,
charred remains. Similarly, only 1 small charred specimen was recovered from BRM-1 on site
41TV2263. As these 2 areas are never inundated (or at least are not often inundated), this
suggests that organic preservation is extremely poor at all locations on sites 41TV2265 and
41TV2263 and was likely so even prior to inundation. Again, as stated previously, the erosional
upland setting of the sites is the probable cause of the poor preservation.
The cultural deposits within the Lower Midden area of site 41TV2265 demonstrate an
extremely poor level of preservation, being devoid of any vertebrate remains and retaining only
an extremely sparse amount of charred material. However, the Upper Midden area of site
41TV2265 and site 41TV2263 exhibit identical levels of preservation, indicating that the lack of
preservation within the Lower Midden area of site 41TV2265 is not a product of inundation, but

HJN 060231 AR

153

Chapter 5.0: Discussion (Research Questions)

rather a result of other factors such as the erosional upland setting of each of the 3 locations.
As such, these findings cannot be utilized to address the question of whether inundation has a
detrimental impact on the preservation of organic deposits within the conservation pool of Lake
Travis, as the Lower Midden area of site 41TV2265 likely lacked preserved materials prior to
inundation. Obviously, inundation likely does produce some degree of impact to cultural
deposits, as lighter materials would tend to float out of any agitated deposits. However,
preserved vertebrate remains have been recovered from other inundated sites within the
reservoir, suggesting that while some sites are lacking in preservation, others actually retain
some level of preservation. These findings echo those of Lenihan et al. (1981), who concluded
that sites within reservoir settings possess differential degrees of preservation.

5.13

CONTAMINATION OF PRESERVED CARBON

One of the questions that the Lower Midden area of site 41TV2265 was deemed capable
of addressing was whether datable materials such as carbonized plant remains and snail shells
from archeological sites within the conservation pool of Lake Travis have been contaminated by
biochemical processes resulting from inundation. In their National Reservoir Inundation Study,
Lenihan et al. (1981) indicate that freshwater immersion should not alter the potential of
samples to yield usable dates, with the exception of freshwater shell. They support this with the
results of C-14 assays from 4 reservoirs where carbonized materials were collected in
association with temporally diagnostic artifacts. In all cases, the resulting assays corresponded
with the anticipated date of the sites based on diagnostic projectile point styles. They concluded
that the results from this limited sample argue strongly for the continued viability of C-14 as a
dating technique in reservoir areas.
A total of 5 radiocarbon assays were acquired from 2 samples of charred material and 3
snails that were recovered from the BRM-5 pit feature within the Lower Midden area of site
41TV2265. This area had been inundated for most of the past 70 years since the construction
of the Lake Travis. The 5 resulting assays reflected periods of BRM-5 pit usage between the
Late Archaic II and Late Prehistoric period, corresponding with the Late Archaic II and Late
Prehistoric projectile points recovered from the feature contexts. These data confirm Lenihan at
al.’s (1981) determination that freshwater immersion should not alter the potential of samples to
yield usable dates. As such, it can be surmised that carbonized plant remains and snail shells
from other archeological sites within the conservation pool of Lake Travis will also yield viable
dates reflective of the temporal periods associated with their occupation.

6.0 CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS

6.1

CONCLUSIONS

During the months of March and April 2007, Horizon conducted NRHP eligibility testing
on 2 prehistoric sites (41TV2263 and 41TV2265) located in areas under the jurisdiction of the
USACE within the proposed 1060-acre Vizcaya development near Spicewood, Travis County,
Texas. The development will consist of a luxury residential golf-course community in the Hill
Country with up to 500 custom homes, hiking trails, a marina, and an 18-hole Reese Jonesdesigned golf course. Although the development is privately funded and located on private
property, the development of the property within the USACE jurisdictional areas will require a
Section 404 permit issued by the USACE. As such, the development within these jurisdictional
areas falls under the regulations of Section 106 of the National Historic Preservation Act
(NHPA) of 1966, as amended. Horizon conducted the NRHP eligibility testing investigations on
sites 41TV2263 and 41TV2265 at the request of the Lake Travis Ranch, LLC in compliance with
Section 106 of the NHPA. The purpose of the NRHP eligibility testing investigations was to
determine if sites 41TV2263 and 41TV2265 possessed cultural deposits eligible for inclusion in
the NRHP.
Site 41TV2263
Site 41TV2263 was originally recorded as an aboriginal open campsite straddling a
drainage above the Colorado River. Visible cultural features on the site included 3 burned rock
middens aligned in a triangle. Artifact frequencies on this site appeared to be densest in the
area contained within the triangle formed by the 3 middens. Areas of the site beyond the
middens consisted of exposed limestone bedrock and shallow rocky soils with no apparent
potential to contain buried deposits. During the NRHP testing investigations, 2 extensive
backhoe trenches were placed on the site. One trench extended from the center of the largest
midden on the site (BRM-1) across the southern end of the site into BRM-2. The second trench
initiated in the center of BRM-3 and extended to the southwest across the central portion of the
site. These 2 trenches formed an upside down “T” over the central portion of the site between
the middens.
Generally speaking, the NRHP testing investigations on site 41TV2263 revealed that the
3 middens are comprised almost solely of burned rock and black midden soil. Very few other
artifacts were observed within the excavated matrix, suggesting that these 3 middens represent

HJN 060231 AR

155

Chapter 6.0: Conclusions and Recommendations

“kitchen middens,” where plant baking was the primary activity, rather than “trash middens” that
would have accreted from repeated episodes of refuse dumping during the utilization of the site
between Late Archaic I and Late Prehistoric periods, as is suggested by the humate dates from
the site. The trenches across the central portion of the site revealed generally sparse and
shallow cultural deposits overlying the marl substratum in this upland setting. The few observed
cultural materials consisted of mano fragments, metate fragments, and a nutting stone
fragment. Based on the presence of these plant-processing implements in association with the
3 “kitchen” middens, as well as the general lack of other domestic debris, it would appear that
site 41TV2263 represents a plant processing activity area that was perhaps situated away from
an associated encampment. As this site is located just above the current levels of Lake Travis,
any associated encampments could be located in submerged areas closer to the actual channel
of the Colorado River.
The investigations on this site revealed that the 3 burned rock middens on the site are
generally lacking in cultural deposits aside from the copious amounts of burned rock that
comprise the middens. While a few associated artifacts were observed within the midden
deposits, these were extremely sparse, and no temporally diagnostic implements were
recovered. In addition, the midden deposits on this site were also found to possess essentially
no floral or faunal preservation, making a determination of the baked foodstuffs that resulted in
the midden accumulations impossible beyond mere assumptions. The associated areas
surrounding the middens consist of upland areas exhibiting exposed limestone bedrock and
shallow soils that prohibit deeply buried and stratified cultural deposits. Like the midden
deposits, the associated areas of the site around the middens also contained only sparse
cultural deposits that were also lacking in temporally diagnostic artifacts and preserved floral
and faunal remains. As such, there appears to be little additional data relevant to the prehistory
of the area that this site can provide.
Site 41TV2265
Site 41TV2265 was initially recorded as an extensive aboriginal campsite located on
what currently is a peninsula that extends into Lake Travis. Low lake levels at the time of the
original survey allowed for the documentation of portions of the site that have been submerged
by the lake for roughly the past 70 years. The site consists entirely of upland locations lacking
in alluvial deposits. As such, cultural debris was scattered on the surface over a large area.
Observed projectile points on the site suggested that the site was occupied potentially as early
as the Paleo-Indian period up through the Late Prehistoric period. In addition to the observed
surface materials, 5 burned rock middens were observed at various locations on this large site.
Three of the middens are located in an upland area along the ridge of the peninsula (Upper
Midden area), while 2 are located on a finger of the peninsula that has been submerged by the
lake (Lower Midden area). While all 5 middens appeared to be composed of dense amounts of
burned rock situated on shallow soils or limestone bedrock, a probe or “pokey rod” pressed into
the midden closest to the lake (BRM-5) during the survey level investigations extended to a
depth of 1.5 meters below surface, suggesting some sort of pit or karst feature beneath the
midden deposits.

Volume 2: NRHP Testing Investigations within the Proposed 1060-Acre Vizcaya Development

The Upper Midden Area of Site 41TV2265
During the NRHP eligibility testing of the Upper Midden area of site 41TV2265, 3
backhoe trenches were excavated over 2 of the upper middens (BRM-1 and BRM-2), and two 1
x 1-m test units were hand-excavated off the resulting trench profiles. The investigations
revealed that the upper middens on site 41TV2265 are “kitchen” middens similar to those
documented on nearby site 41TV2263. While relatively large, the upper middens consist
primarily of spent burned rock and black midden soil. Other recovered artifacts include only a
small amount of chert debitage, freshwater mussel shell, 1 Darl dart point, and 2 Pedernales
dart point bases. These specimens suggest that the upper middens were in use during
Johnson and Goode’s (1994) Late Archaic I and II periods. The general sparseness of
domestic refuse within these middens again points to the use of this location as an activity area
where the baking of plants (and mussels) occurred away from an associated living area. In fact,
the density of materials documented in the vicinity of the lower middens suggest that the Lower
Midden area may in fact represent such a possible living area found a short distance from the
upper “kitchen” middens.
The investigations within the Upper Midden area of site 41TV2265 revealed that the 2
assessed burned rock middens in this area are generally lacking in cultural deposits aside from
the copious amounts of burned rock that comprise the middens. While a few associated
artifacts were observed within the midden deposits, these were extremely sparse, and only 3
temporally diagnostic implements were recovered. Like the middens on nearby 41TV2263, the
midden deposits within the Upper Midden area of site 41TV2265 were also found to possess
essentially no floral or faunal preservation, making a determination of the baked foodstuffs that
resulted in the midden accumulations impossible. The associated areas surrounding the
middens consist of upland areas exhibiting exposed limestone bedrock and shallow soils that
prohibit deeply buried and stratified cultural deposits. As such, there appears to be little
additional data relevant to the prehistory of the area that this Upper Midden area of site
41TV2265 can provide.
The Lower Midden Area of Site 41TV2265
The Lower Midden area of site 41TV2265 is located on a small peninsula that is
normally submerged within the conservation pool of Lake Travis. During prehistory, this location
would have been an elevated ridge above the confluence of the Colorado River and Bee Creek.
As this portion of the site had been submerged for roughly the past 70 years, the entire landform
had been completely eroded/deflated by wave action, leaving behind a considerable amount of
cultural material on the limestone surface of the site. However, at least 1 area of the site
appeared to possess potential subsurface deposits based on the placement of a “pokey rod”
within what appeared to be a deflated midden. To assess this portion of the site, a total of 7
backhoe trenches were excavated over the extent of the landform. These trenches revealed the
presence of an extensive natural basin that appears to have resulted from a tree throw event. A
total of twenty-one 1 x 1-m test units were placed within the confines of the pit feature and in
areas immediately adjacent to it. Although the majority of the site was found to consist of
exposed limestone bedrock, cultural deposits were documented within the pit feature and
considerable amounts of cultural materials were recovered from its upper extents. The deposits

HJN 060231 AR

157

Chapter 6.0: Conclusions and Recommendations

appear to reflect the usage of the pit as a possible refuse midden (trash pit), followed by the
later accretion of dense amounts of additional cultural refuse (inclusive of burned rock) over the
surface of the feature. The historic submersion of the site by lake waters appears to have then
“melted” the midden deposits into a thin, yet concentrated, drape of cultural materials over the
pit. A variety of projectile points recovered over the peninsula suggest a usage of the area
throughout prehistory, while numerous Scallorn and Edwards arrow points suggest that the pit
feature is primarily associated with occupations during the Late Prehistoric period. Based on
the recovered materials, the Lower Midden area of site 41TV2265 appears to be an aboriginal
encampment that may represent the living area associated with the hypothesized “kitchen”
believed to be represented by the middens documented in the Upper Midden area of the site.
Toward the end of the field investigations, heavy rains doused the Colorado River
drainage basin, and lake levels began a drastic rise. Waters began to seep into the excavated
trenches and test units, dissolving the few remaining intact portions of the pit deposits. In the
final day of fieldwork, lake waters completely covered this portion of the site well below 6 to 8
feet of water. At the time of the writing of this specific paragraph (late June 2007), months after
the actual field investigations, additional tropical weather systems continued to fill Lake Travis to
elevations over 691 feet amsl (10 feet above full). This water elevation places the Lower
Midden area of site 41TV2265, which is situated between 655 and 665 feet amsl, below
approximately 30 feet of lake water.
The investigations within the Lower Midden Area of site 41TV2265 revealed that this
normally inundated portion of the site is generally lacking in buried, stratified deposits over the
majority of the landform due to erosion and deflation from wave action. This has served to strip
the surface of the site of the majority of its original matrices, leaving behind a surface covered
within an armor of limestone cobbles and condensed cultural materials. This alone would
suggest that the Lower Midden area lacks intact cultural deposits that could potentially be
significant. However, the destruction of the upper extents of the site resulting from inundation
did actually result in the fortuitous preservation of the BRM-5 pit feature, suggesting that at least
a portion of this area did retain some integrity. Investigations within this feature did produce
ample amounts of domestic refuse consisting of, in large part, temporally diagnostic materials
and at least a minute amount of preserved charred plant remnants. Unfortunately, the deposits
within this relatively rare feature appear to have been considerably churned by rodent and clam
burrowing, as well as by probable Late Prehistoric group scavenging within the deposits. In
addition, the bulk of the deposits within this feature were excavated via trenching and handexcavated units during the testing investigations. Although portions of the deposits were left
intact, the final days of the investigations witnessed the infilling of the excavated areas with lake
waters welling up from below the site and the subsequent melting and destruction of the
remaining portions of the feature matrices. With this in mind, while the Lower Midden area
originally contained 1 area of subsurface deposits, the current investigation removed the bulk of
these deposits, and the remaining deposits have since been destroyed. This suggests that the
Lower Midden area retains no additional intact data capable of addressing the prehistory of the
area.

6.2

ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA FOR INCLUSION IN THE NATIONAL REGISTER OF HISTORIC
PLACES

Ultimately, management decisions regarding cultural resource properties are a function
of the potential importance of the sites in addressing defined research needs. Cultural
resources are usually evaluated according to criteria established to determine their eligibility for
inclusion in the National Register of Historic Places (NRHP). Determinations of eligibility for
inclusion in the NRHP are based on the criteria presented in the Code of Federal Regulations
(CFR) in 36 CFR §60.4(a-d). The 4 criteria of eligibility are applied following the identification of
relevant historical themes and related research questions:
The quality of significance in American history, architecture, archeology, and culture is
present in districts, sites, buildings, structures, and objects that possess integrity of
location, design, setting, materials, workmanship, feeling, and association, and:
a. [T]hat are associated with events that have made a significant contribution to the
broad patterns of our history; or,
b. [T]hat are associated with the lives of persons significant in our past; or,
c.

[T]hat embody the distinctive characteristics of a type, period, or method of
construction, or that represent a significant and distinguishable entity whose
components may lack individual distinction; or,

d. [T]hat have yielded, or may be likely to yield, information important in prehistory
or history (U.S. Department of the Interior, National Park Service (36 CFR §60.4).

The first step in the evaluation process is to define the significance of the property by
identifying the particular aspect of history or prehistory to be addressed and the reasons why
information on that topic is important. The second step is to define the kinds of evidence or the
data requirements that the property must exhibit to provide significant information. These data
requirements in turn indicate the kind of integrity that the site must possess to be significant.
This concept of integrity relates both to the contextual integrity of such entities as structures,
districts, or archeological deposits and to the applicability of the potential database to pertinent
research questions. Without such integrity, the significance of a resource is very limited.
For a cultural resource to be eligible for inclusion in the NRHP, it must meet legal
standards of eligibility that are determined by 3 requirements: (1) properties must possess
significance, (2) the significance must satisfy at least 1 of the 4 criteria for eligibility listed above,
and (3) significance should be derived from an understanding of historic context. As discussed
here, historic context refers to the organization of information concerning prehistory and history
according to various periods of development in various times and at various places. Thus, the
significance of a property can best be understood through knowledge of historic development
and the relationship of the resource to other, similar properties within a particular period of
development. Most prehistoric sites are usually only eligible for inclusion in the NRHP under
Criterion D, which considers their potential to contribute data important to an understanding of
prehistory. All 4 criteria employed for determining NRHP eligibility potentially can be brought to
bear for historic sites.

MANAGEMENT RECOMMENDATIONS
Site 41TV2263

Site 41TV2263 is an aboriginal site found to be: 1) situated in an upland setting lacking
in deeply buried, stratified cultural deposits; 2) lacking in temporally diagnostic artifacts; and 3)
lacking in preserved floral and faunal remains. Although 3 burned rock midden features are
present on the site, these features are also lacking cultural materials aside from spent cooking
rock. Based on these qualities, it is Horizon’s opinion that site 41TV2263 does not retain
characteristics capable of furthering our knowledge of prehistory, and, as such, is considered to
be ineligible for inclusion in the NRHP and warrants no further investigations. Therefore,
Horizon recommends that cultural resources clearance be granted for site 41TV2263.
Site 41TV2265
Site 41TV2265 is also an aboriginal site situated in what prehistorically was an upland
ridgeline above the confluence of Bee Creek and the Colorado River. The Upper Midden area
of this site appears to represent the remnants of communal oven baking, while the Lower
Midden area is interpreted as the actual encampment or living area associated with the
development of the upper middens. Because of its upland setting, the Upper Midden area of
the site was found be entirely lacking in deeply buried, stratified cultural deposits with the
exception of the deposits within the 2 investigated burned rock middens. Unfortunately, these
middens were found to contain only sparse cultural debris other than burned rock (perceived as
a result of keeping the area free from daily domestic refuse) and no floral and faunal
preservation. Due to this, it is Horizon’s opinion that the Upper Midden area does not contribute
to the overall NRHP eligibility status of site 41TV2265 and that no further investigations are
warranted in this area.
The Lower Midden area of site 41TV2265 is also an upland area that would typically not
contain deeply buried, stratified deposits. Whatever deposits the area once contained have now
been stripped away and deflated over the vast majority of the surface of this area of the site.
The exception to this is the BRM-5 pit feature that was found to retain a considerable amount of
subsurface cultural deposits. Although this feature appears to be the remnants of an aboriginal
refuse midden or “landfill,” the deposits have been heavily disturbed by bioturbation.
Additionally, the portions of this feature that remained after the current testing investigations
have been effectively dissolved and destroyed by the recent re-inundation of the site. With this
in mind, it is Horizon’s opinion that, like the Upper Midden area, the Lower Midden area of site
41TV2265 is not a contributing element to the overall NRHP eligibility status of the site and the
site as a whole is considered to be ineligible for inclusion in the NRHP. Horizon therefore
recommends that the granting of the necessary USACE permit for the undertaking be allowed to
proceed because, after the 2007 testing investigations, none of the sites appear to be eligible
for inclusion in the NRHP. However, in the unlikely event that human skeletal materials or burial
furniture are encountered during the development, maintenance, and use of the property,
construction at the specific location of the find(s) should cease, and the THC and USACE
should be notified immediately.
