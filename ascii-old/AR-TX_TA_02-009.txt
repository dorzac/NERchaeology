Abstract
Medina Consultants, Inc., San Antonio, Texas contracted with Tierras Antiguas Archaeology to
conduct a cultural resources survey of the footprint of a proposed AT&T cellular tower with
accompanying access and utility rights-of way in the City of Natalia, Medina County, Texas. The
Federal Communications Commission’s Nationwide Programmatic Agreement (PA; 47 CFR
Part 1) requires that a cultural resources survey be conducted prior to such an undertaking. No
Antiquities Permit was required, but subsequent review of this archaeological report was
provided by the Texas Historical Commission’s Archeology Division.
Tierras Antiguas conducted the survey on January 10th, 2009. A thorough pedestrian survey of
the surface area was concluded before six shovel tests were excavated. No cultural material of
a prehistoric nature, or historic artifacts earlier than A.D. 1950 were observed on the surface.
Although two presumably prehistoric tertiary flakes were observed in the upper 10 cm of two
shovel tests, they were within the contexts of a plow zone, a 20th century road fill, and a 1980s
trash dump. No artifacts were collected or curated.
As such, Tierras Antiguas Archaeology recommended that Medina Consulting, Inc. be allowed
to oversee development of the tract as planned. However, Tierras Antiguas further recommended
that if any previously undiscovered cultural resources were encountered during development,
work should immediately be halted in the vicinity until such finds could be examined and
evaluated by Tierras Antiguas, or by any qualified archaeological consultant, and by the Texas
Historical Commission.

Introduction
Medina Consulting, Inc. is the consulting firm
employed to acquire clearance for the erection of a
celluar telephone tower to be constructed by AT&T in
Natalia, Medina County, Texas (Figures 1 and 2).
Medina contracted with Terras Antiguas to conduct an
archaeological investigation of the proposed tower site.
Although no public funding was involved in the
proposed development of the property, the Federal
Communications Commission’s Nationwide
Programmatic Agreement (PA; 47 CFR Part 1) requires
that a cultural resources survey be conducted prior to
such an undertaking.
In December, 2008 Tierras Antiguas Archaeology Figure 1. Location of the project area
conducted an on-line review of the Archaeological Site and Medina County.
Atlas (Atlas) of the Texas State Historic Preservation
Office (SHPO). The purpose of this review was to identify any listed or potential archaeological
resources within the Area of Potential Effect (APE) .
The review of a modern (2008) aerial
photograph, as well as vintage and
topographic maps dating to as early as
1922 revealed that other than
cultivation, the immediate APE had
undergone little impact during the 20th
century.
In addition, a detailed architectural
drawing of the tower site and access
road, a geological map, and a USDA
soils map of the proposed project area
were reviewed.

Although the preliminary review of the
Texas Historical Commission’s Atlas
indicated that there were no
archaeological sites recorded within the
proposed tower site, there are five
archaeological sites recorded along
Fort Ewell Creek in close proximity to
the proposed tower site, most notably

41ME19, a Late Prehistoric campsite. Even though the proposed tower site area may have been
cultivated, the site is situated on an apparent 2nd terrace (T2) of the creek where there is good
potential for an archaeological site to exist, and with possibly intact cultural deposits below the
plow zone. Therefore, Tierras Antiguas recommended that an on-site surface survey and shovel
testing would be an adequate and appropriate method for further evaluating the APE, and for
determining the existence of cultural materials within the project area.
On January 10th, 2009 Tierras Antiguas Archaeology conducted a 100% pedestrian survey of
the footprint of the proposed impact area, as well as access and utility rights-of way. In addition
to the surface survey, Tierras Antiguas excavated six shovel tests. The survey was conducted
under the guidelines of the Texas Historical Commission (THC) and Council of Texas
Archeologists (CTA), and the Texas State Historical Preservation Office (SHPO). Although no
Texas Antiquities Permit was required, this report of findings was reviewed by the (SHPO).

Project Setting
Geology and Soils
The project area where the cellular tower is to be located is further illustrated in Figures 3 and
4. It is to be situated on Leona Formation (Qle) fine calcareous silty alluvium terrace deposits
that are made up of soils that range from Pleistocene to Pliocene Pleistocene/Quaternary in age
(> 30,000 years). The surface consists of fine calcareous silt that grades into coarse gravel with
depth (Figure 3).

Figure 4. Soils within the project area.

Figure 3. Geological formation underlying
the project area (Barnes 1982).

As shown in Figure 4, the soil type within the project area is the Caid series (Dittmar et al. 1977).
These soils are deep, and well-drained terrace deposits, formed along old streams as a
combination of alluvial (stream-deposited) and eolian (wind-blown) deposits. They are typically
made up of dark grayish to very dark grayish sandy clay loam from the surface to about 13 inches
(33 centimeters), underlain by brown clay loam with lime threads, lime concretions, and soft
lime masses. This typical profile is what was observed in shovel testing within the project area
(see Table 1).

Cultural Context and Chronology
Introduction
The project area lies within the South Texas archaeological region. The most basic chronology
of the South Texas region can be divided into either: (1) prehistoric cultural groups with no
specific tribal affiliation, or; (2) historically documented groups with a designated tribal or band
name. Before Spanish soldiers and Catholic missionaries arrived in Texas, the cultural activities
of the groups of prehistoric Native Americans who inhabited the region can only be surmised
from what we can glean from the archaeological records at undisturbed, and well-documented
sites. Historic cultural groups are those observed firsthand by the Spanish soldiers and priests
beginning in the late 1600s. The Spanish then began recording the names, numbers, and living
conditions of the many groups of Native Americans who lived in the region. However, there is
a significant transition era between the least archaeologically known prehistoric cultural groups,
and the historic Native Americans that the Spanish documented; the transition era occurs in the
1500s when Spanish explorers and treasure seekers ventured through Texas.
The Prehistoric Chronology
Based on research in Texas over the past 70+ years, beginning with professionals from the
University of Texas at Austin, archaeologists have been able to segregate the prehistoric period
in South Texas into the Paleoindian, Archaic, and Late Prehistoric periods. Although other
archaeologists have made significant foundational contributions to our current understanding of
how past cultures changed through time, perhaps the most current and widely recognized
chronologies are those offered by Dr. Thomas Hester (1995).
Refining a cultural chronology for south Texas is problematic, due to the compressed nature of
the archaeological record and the scarcity of stratified sites excavated within the region. Hester
(1995:433) acknowledges the paucity of information that exists for south Texas and as such
offers only a “general framework” for prehistoric periods particular to the region. All dates are
given as approximate years before present (B.P.), i.e., before 1950.
Paleoindian (11,200 - 7950 B.P.)
This period spans the period estimated at between ca.11,200–7950 B.P. in south Texas (Hester
3

1995:433–436). The Paleoindian period began toward the close of the Pleistocene. Diagnostic
artifacts of the early Paleoindian interval include Clovis and Folsom projectile points, with the
first stemmed (as opposed to lanceolate) points, Angostura, Wilson, Golondrina, St. Mary’s Hall,
and Barber (among a few others) appearing during the late Paleoindian interval. The wide
distribution of Clovis-type points across most of North America and even into Central America
suggests a wide dispersal and interaction of the people who made them. Other artifacts associated
with the Clovis culture include bifaces and prismatic blades, engraved stones, bone and ivory
points, stone bolas, ochre, and shaft straighteners.
In general, the Paleoindian adaptation has been considered to be one of small bands of nomadic,
big-game hunters following herds of Late Pleistocene fauna, including mammoth, mastodons,
bison, camel, and horse, across North America (Black 1989). More recently, emphasis has been
placed on the wide diversity of plants and animals used for subsistence by these early Americans,
such as turtles and tortoises, alligators, mice, badgers, and raccoons, although they undoubtedly
hunted the large animals as well (Collins 1995:381). Known Clovis sites include killsites,
quarries, caches, open campsites, ritual sites, and burials (Hester 1995:433–436). A Folsom
interval follows the Clovis. Folsom artifacts are fairly common in south Texas; however, no
camp sites or killsites have been found south of a large workshop, Pavo Real (41BX52), in Bexar
County (Hester 1995:434–435). Most Paleoindian finds in south Texas have consisted of surface
lithic scatters on upland terraces and ridges (Black 1989).
As the warming that marks the transition from Pleistocene to Holocene climates began to take
effect in Texas, prehistoric inhabitants adapted with changes in lifestyle. This climatic shift is
also marked by the decline and extinction of mammoth, mastodon, horse, camel, and giant bison
(Bison antiquus). Large gregarious game animals were perhaps extinct in Texas. Human hunters
were forced to concentrate on deer, antelope, and other medium-size or smaller game. Changes
in the subsistence base required technological shifts that mark the beginning of a new cultural
period known as the Archaic.
Early Archaic (7950 - 4450 B.P.)
Hester (1995:436–438) identifies the Early Archaic, with Early Corner Notched and Early Basal
Notched dart points, as roughly dating between 7950 to 4450 B.P. The extinction of large herds
of megafauna and the changing climate at the beginning of the Holocene stimulated a behavioral
change by the Prehistoric inhabitants of south Texas (McKinney 1981). While the basic huntergatherer adaptation probably remained intact, an economic shift away from big game hunting
was necessary. In general, more intensive exploitation of local and smaller resources such as
deer, fish, and plant bulbs is indicated by greater densities of ground-stone artifacts, fire-cracked
rock cooking features, and more specialized tools. Weir (1976) speculates that Early Archaic
groups were small and highly mobile, an inference based on the fact that Early Archaic sites are
thinly distributed and that diagnostic projectile point types are seen across a wide area, including
most of Texas and northern Mexico. Story (1985) believes that population densities were low
during the Early Archaic, and that groups consisted of related individuals in small bands with
“few constraints on their mobility” (Story 1985:39). Their economy was based on the utilization
of a wide range of resources, especially such year-round resources as prickly pear and lechugilla,
as well as rodents, rabbits, and deer.
4

Middle Archaic (4450 - 2350 B.P.)
Hester (1995:438–441) suggests that the period between 4450 and 2350 B.P. reflects the Middle
Archaic in south Texas. The Middle Archaic appears to have been a time of increased
population, based on the large number of sites from this period (Story 1985:40; Weir 1976:125,
128). On the South Texas Plains, exploitation of widely scattered, year-round resources such as
prickly pear continued (Campbell and Campbell 1981:13–15), as did hunting deer and rabbit.
Weir (1976) believes that the widely scattered bands prevalent in the Early Archaic now began
to coalesce, at least during the acorn-gathering season, into larger groups who shared the
intensive work of gathering and processing the acorn harvest (Weir 1976:126). Many researchers
believe burned rock middens are a result of this endeavor. The common presence of deer remains
in burned rock middens encourages the view that deer processing took place at burned rock
midden sites. Bison bone is encountered in archaeological sites in south Texas, at least
occasionally, during all but the earliest part of the Middle Archaic (Dillehay 1974). Cemeteries
make their first appearance during this period, suggesting a movement toward less mobility and
perhaps territorialism. One of the earliest occurrences dating to the south Texas Middle Archaic,
is Loma Sandia in Live Oak County, which dates between ca. 2550 and 2750 B.P. (Taylor and
Highley 1995).
Late Archaic (2350 - 1250 B.P.)
Hester believes the Late Archaic in south Texas may be defined as between 2350–1250 B.P,
Some researchers believe populations increased throughout the Late Archaic (Prewitt 1985),
while others feel populations remained the same or fell during this period (Black 1989a:30).
Subsistence is assumed to have become less specialized on acorns, in favor of a broad spectrum
subsistence base (Black 1989:30). Story (1985:44–45) believes the presence of cemeteries
indicates that Late Archaic populations in central and south Texas were increasing and becoming
more territorial. Although inhabitants of the South Texas Plain near Brownsville and Rockport
had begun to make pottery by about 1750 B.P., the northern part of the plain was still “preceramic” until 1,000 years later (Story 1985:45–47). Late Archaic points tend to be much smaller
than Middle Archaic points.
Transitional Archaic (2250 - 1250 B.P.)
A late subperiod or interval of the Late Archaic is frequently referred to as the Terminal Archaic
or Transitional Archaic. Turner and Hester (1993) cite data placing the Transitional Archaic as
2250–1250 B.P. Although Hester may lump current data into a Late Archaic period, he cautions
that more evidence will likely result in what may be termed as a “Terminal Archaic” period
during the latter part of the Late Archaic in south Texas. This Terminal Archaic period is
represented by diagnostics such as Ensor, Frio, and Matamoras points which appear to overlap
the Late Archaic and Late Prehistoric periods (Hester 1995:442). Weir (1976) believes this
marked a transition period to localized area sites, a disappearance of burned rock middens and
bison, and a reappearance of highly mobile hunters and gatherers. Others argue that in some
locations burned rock middens did not disappear and sites were more intensely occupied during
the Transitional Archaic period.
Late Prehistoric (1250 - 420 B.P.)
The term “Late Prehistoric” is commonly used to designate the period following the Late Archaic
in south Texas. Generally, the Late Prehistoric period is thought of as spanning the period
5

between A. D. 700 - 1530 ([1250 - 420 B.P.] [Hester 1995]). A series of distinctive traits marks
the shift from the Archaic to the Late Prehistoric period, including the technological shift to the
bow and arrow and the introduction of pottery to central Texas and the northern South Texas
Plain (Black 1989:32; Story 1985:45–47). Two distinct phases recognized within the Late
Prehistoric are the Austin and Toyah. During the Austin phase, there appears to be a subtle
transition from expanding stem projectile points that may have been used as dart points, as well
as early arrow points. The most prevalent point found in Austin phase sites is the Scallorn arrow
point. Settlement shifts into rockshelters such as Scorpion Cave in Medina County and Classen
Rockshelter in northern Bexar County have been noted. Cemeteries from this period often reveal
evidence of conflict (Black 1989:32).
Beginning rather abruptly at about 650 B.P., a shift in technology occurred. The Perdiz arrow
point may best represent the appearance of a distinct culture in south-central Texas lasting for
about 300 years, which archaeologists have labeled the Toyah phase. Hester (1995:444)
recognizes this phase as the “best documented Late Prehistoric pattern” throughout south Texas,
with dates ranging between ca. 650/700 to 300/350 B.P. (A.D. 1250/1300 to 1600/1650).
In addition to Perdiz points, evidence of a Toyah culture is manifested as bone-tempered pottery,
bone spatulates, awls, and beads, stone endscrapers, beveled knives, and expediently utilized
flakes. Briefly, expedient lithic technology involves removing flakes from a core in a
nonstandard manner; the purpose is to knock off sharp flakes for immediate use, selecting the
ones that best suit the need at the time. This technology differs from formal, standardized core
reduction and the manufacturing of formal, usually bifacial tools. Expedient lithic technology
is a continent-wide phenomonon indicative of increased sedentism, and is observed in Toyah
assemblages in Texas.
Whether the Toyah phase seen in the south-central Texas archaeological record is a result of a
group of people moving into the region, or adapted technologies from the region’s periphery is
a matter of conjecture. Steele and Assad-Hunter (1986) argue for the occurrence of a distinct
change in diet between the Late Archaic and the Late Prehistoric components in two sites in the
Choke Canyon Reservoir area in south Texas. Analysis of the number of identified specimens
(NISP) shows a marked increase in artiodactyla elements present during the later part of the Late
Prehistoric, an increase largely due to the addition of bison to the “menu” (Steele and AssadHunter 1986:468).
Whether or not agriculture was practiced during this period in south Texas has not been
documented. There simply is not enough evidence to postulate there was ever a significant
presence of maize in the area. The later arrival of the Spanish during the later
Protohistoric/Historic period brought significant cultivars to south Texas.
Protohistoric/Historic (420 B.P. - present)
The end of the Late Prehistoric and beginning of the Historic period in south Texas is
characterized by written accounts of European contact with indigenous groups. The Protohistoric
period begins in 1528 when Spanish explorer Cabeza de Vaca traversed parts of southeast and
south Texas and left a diary of his five years spent traveling among the hunter-gatherers of Texas
and northern Mexico. Cabeza de Vaca’s account of his stay with the Miriami in 1533-34
6

indicates that groups of Native Americans would normally tether themselves to the easily
exploitable riverine environments in the fall, winter and summer, occasionally sending a hunting
party onto the grasslands to hunt deer. In the summer, many groups would live near each other
in the semiarid environs of South Texas to harvest prickly pear pads and other succulents
(Campbell and Campbell 1981:13-37).
Linguistically, early protohistoric accounts of the late 1500s indicate that a large group which
spoke Cohuilteco inhabited the area now known as south-central Texas. Coahuiltecan is a term
coined by Mexican linguists in the 1800s, and the name refers to the many small bands of Native
Americans who lived in northeastern Coahuila, Mexico and south Texas. The Coahuiltecans
were rapidly dispersed or killed during the Protohistoric period.
By the 1540s and 1550s Spanish ranchers had established large ranches in northern Mexico, with
several hundred thousand cattle, using Indian slaves as labor. Large mining ventures in northern
Mexico did the same. This encroachment from the south forced Native Americans to escape into
the south-central Texas region.
The period between de Vaca’s written account and the advent of Spanish missions in the late
1600s and early 1700s is referred to as the Protohistoric; a time when few, scant written
documents exist detailing Native American life outside the missions. The Historic period then,
is generally thought of as beginning in the 1700s.

Project Goals and Methods
Goals
The project goals focused on archaeological issues that could be addressed by the types of data
obtained through pedestrian survey, along with limited shovel testing. The topics addressed were
site type, distribution, density, size, depth, and stratigraphy. The theoretical framework is
structured around patterns of settlement, mobility, subsistence, and social systems for the South
Texas region.
The goals of the project were to (1) locate and record any cultural artifacts in the project area
using a systematic survey methodology, (2) quantify site size, as well as depth, and stratigraphy,
and (3) place any diagnostic artifacts within the regional time frame.

7

Methods
Prior to the archaeological survey, the
area to be impacted had been staked
with survey stakes, thus clearly
delineating the area to be further
disturbed. In Accordance with Texas
Historical Commission (THC) and
Council of Texas Archeologists (CTA)
Archaeology Survey Standards, a
systematic, 100% pedestrian survey of
the delineated tract was conducted.
Particular attention was paid to an
abandoned county road right-of-way
that had been cut to an average depth of
30 cm below the surface (Figure 5).

to be impacted. Shovel tests were dug
in 10-cm levels, and all sediments were screened through 1/4-inch wire mesh. In accordance with
a designed research plan, all artifacts recovered from shovel tests were not to be collected, but
were placed in the upper 10 cm of the backfilled shovel test.

Results of the Investigations
Surface Examination and Shovel
Testing
Surface visibility ranged from 60-100%.
Although scattered modern debris
consisted of plastic, metals fragments,
clear glass, modern dinnerware sherds,
and PVC pipe, no artifacts of historic
significance were observed on the
surface, and no prehistoric artifacts
were observed. In the six shovel tests,
two tertiary flakes were found in mixed
contexts (Shovel Tests 1 and 5), and
modern trash was found in one. The
results of shovel testing are shown in
Table 1. Locations of the shovel tests
within the project area are shown in
Figure 6.

Summary, Conclusions, and Recommendations
According to the landowner, the rectangular area where the tower is to be located had been
artificially terraced, cultivated for many years, and deep-plowed to approximately 28 cm below
the surface (personal communication, Mr. H. E. Willenberg, January 10, 2009). The linear area
designated as an access and utility right-of-way leading to FM471 had once been a county road,
since abandoned.
A 100-percent pedestrian survey of the surface that offered up to 100% visibility within the
project area was conducted, but no evidence of neither prehistoric nor significant historic
occupation was found. Although two presumably prehistoric tertiary flakes were recovered from
shovel tests, they were in mixed contexts. The faunal material, glass, metal, and charcoal
recovered from Shovel Test 5 are the remains of a household trash and garbage dump from the
1970s and 1980s. According to the landowner, that entire area was piled with trash and garbage
before being set afire in the 1980s.
Therefore, we recommend that the project should proceed as currently designed by the project
sponsor. The project should be considered as having “no effect” on any properties considered
as eligible for nomination to the National Register of Historic Places or inclusion in the State
Archeological Landmarks Program. As such, the project should proceed without further
archaeological work. However, if any cultural resources are encountered during construction
within the APE, work should immediately be halted in the vicinity until such finds are examined
and evaluated by Tierras Antiguas, or by any qualified archaeological consultant, and by the
Texas Historical Commission.
