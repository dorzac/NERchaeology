A Native American Dragonfly Effigy
By James Coverdale
Recently, a Courson Archaeological Research volunteer recovered a rare and unique example of Native
American metalworking at a Native American camp along Wolf Creek. What he had unearthed was a dragonfly effigy made from sheet brass (Figure 1). In a handful of plains tribes, specifically among the Cheyenne,
Arapaho, and Kiowa, dragonfly symbols were frequently used by warriors to signify their spiritual connection
to this animal. To anyone who has ever watched a dragonfly as it hovers and
darts around erratically can imagine why native warriors chose to have a
mystical connection with this particular animal. Those who used this effigy
on their regalia believed that it would protect them from being struck during

battle.
As a part of our ongoing replication experiments, I decided to make a reproduction of this ornament for
our collection. Using a full-sized pattern of the ornament, I cut out the outline from a thin piece of brass using
a scissors and a small chisel made from a broken tang of a file.
The final shaping was accomplished using various sized and
shaped files. The four holes were punched out using a small nail
and small piece of steel rod. The rough edges on the backside of
the holes were smoothed with a file. Finally, any scratches and
dents were removed using different grades of sandpaper. The final
product (Figure 2) represents a dragonfly effigy that could have
adorned a war bonnet, pipe bag, shield, lance, bow case, horse or
numerous other objects used by a Southern Plains warrior.

Weathering Rock Art Treasures in
Briscoe County’s Dark Valley
Rock Art such as found in Dark Valley (41BI530) in Briscoe County is losing a battle with nature and other formindable foes such as the upright
walking, two legged Homo sapien species. The often well intentioned but uninformed use of chalk, soap stone, paint or some other substance to
highlight petroglyphs for photography can jeopardize these valuable historical records.
