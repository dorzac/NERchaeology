ABSTRACT
Sphere 3 Environmental, Inc. (Sphere 3) conducted an intensive pedestrian cultural
resources survey of approximately 106.4 hectares (263 acres) of land designated as the
Area of Potential Effects on November 21-22 and 25-27 and December 3 and 4, 2019, in
response to the proposed undertaking to construct a new middle school in Forney, Texas.
Huckabee & Associates, Inc., under contract with the Forney Independent School District
(ISD), retained Sphere 3 to conduct a cultural resources survey of the proposed school
location. The project area is situated wholly within the City of Forney, Texas. The
cultural resources survey was conducted to identify properties eligible for inclusion in the
National Register of Historic Places (NRHP) or listing as a State Antiquities Landmark
(SAL). A total of 310 shovel tests were excavated across the project area. Four historic
archaeological sites (41KF189, 41KF190, 41KF191, and 41KF192) were identified as a
result of the survey. All cultural objects recovered from shovel testing and all documents
associated with this investigation were curated at the Texas Archeological Research
Laboratory in Austin, Texas. Site 41KF192 is recommended as ineligible for inclusion in
the NHRP or for listing as a SAL. Sites 41KF189, 41KF190, and 41KF191 may all
extend beyond the limits of the project area. The portion of Sites 41KF189, 41KF190,
and 41KF191 within the project boundaries have been evaluated as not eligible for
inclusion in the NRHP or for listing as a SAL, and the uninvestigated areas outside of the
project area remain unevaluated. Sphere 3 therefore recommends that construction of the
Forney ISD’s new middle school proceed as planned without further cultural resource
investigations.

INTRODUCTION
Huckabee & Associates, Inc. (Huckabee) was contracted by the Forney Independent School
District (ISD) to construct a new middle school campus on approximately 106.4 hectares (263
acres) of land in Forney, Texas (Figures 1 and 2). Sphere 3 Environmental, Inc. (Sphere 3) was
retained by Huckabee to determine whether any cultural resources eligible for inclusion in the
National Register of Historic Places (NHRP) and/or eligible for designation as a State Antiquities
Landmark (SAL) will be adversely impacted by the proposed construction activities. The
maximum depth of proposed soil disturbance is 42 to 48 feet for placement of drilled foundation
piers and geotechnical borings.
This Phase I cultural resources investigation was developed for this project area, as owned by a
subdivision of the State of Texas, to assure that Forney ISD remains in compliance with the
provisions of the Antiquities Code of Texas. Since no federal funds, permits, or lands are
involved, this construction undertaking is not subject to Section 106 of the National Historic
Preservation Act 1966, as amended. The field documents, reports, and artifacts and other field
specimens collected during the field survey will be permanently curated at the Texas
Archeological Research Laboratory (TARL), University of Texas at Austin, located in Austin,
Texas.
To identify any historic and/or archaeological properties existing within the project area, Sphere 3
developed a scope of work proposing a Phase I intensive cultural resources survey. The Texas
Historical Commission (THC) accepted this proposed scope and issued Texas Antiquities Permit
Number (No.) 9168 on behalf of Forney ISD. Fieldwork was conducted on November 21-22 and
25-27 and December 3 and 4, 2019 under the direction James S. Belew, RPA, who served as
Principal Investigator, Michael Ryan, Brooke Dillon, Jared Jorgensen, and Adam Black.
The project area was visually inspected by pedestrian survey at a maximum of 30 meter (m) (98.4
feet [ft]) transect intervals. A total of 310 shovel tests were excavated across the project area
(Figure 3). These field survey operations resulted in the identification of four historic era sites;
41KF189, 41KF190, 41KF191, and 41KF192. Site 41KF192 is recommended as ineligible

for inclusion in the NHRP or for listing as a SAL. Sites 41KF189, 41KF190, and
41KF191 may all extend beyond the limits of the project area. The portion of Sites
41KF189, 41KF190, and 41KF191 within the project boundaries have been evaluated as
not eligible for inclusion in the NRHP or for listing as a SAL, and the uninvestigated
areas outside of the project area remain unevaluated. Sphere 3 recommends that

construction of the Forney ISD New Middle School proceed without further cultural resource
investigations.

DEFINITION OF STUDY AREA
The project area consists of an irregularly shaped tract measuring 106.4 ha (263 ac) bordered on
the north by a private road extending off Valley View Road and Farm to Market (FM) 740 North
to the south. The central and northern portions of the project area are composed of an agricultural
field overgrown with sunflowers. Topographically, this field is comprised of a wide terrace
sloping very gently to the northeast. The small rectangular portion of the project area on the
southeastern side, just south of the agricultural field and north of FM 740 North, consists of a

level field overgrown with various grasses and brush as well as several rows of cotton plants.
The western arm of the project area consists of open grassy fields with sporadic tree cover of
mostly cedar and other hardwoods along a north/south ridge line. The landscape slopes steeply to
the west of this ridgeline. The project area as defined above is considered the Area of Potential
Effect (APE).
The project area lies within the Texan biotic province, one of seven recognized by Blair (1950)
and Dice (1943) for the state of Texas based on ecological associations of a relatively stable
assemblage of plants and animals. This ecotone describes a region characterized by tall grass
prairies supported by clay soils or sandy soils and oak hickory forests; the dominating species
being post and blackjack oaks, and hickory.
According to the Natural Resources Conservation Service’s Web Soil Survey, the project is
located on: Altoga silty clay, 5 to 12 percent slopes, eroded; Ferris clay, 5 to 12 percent slopes,
eroded; Houston black clay, 0 to 1 percent slopes; and Houston black clay, 1 to 3 percent slopes.


Altoga soils are very deep, well drained soils that formed in calcareous clayey alluvium
derived from mudstone. Altoga soils consist of silty clay from 0 cm to 168 cm (0 in to 66
in) (USDA 2017).



Ferris soils are deep to mudstone, well drained soils that formed in clayey residuum
weathered form calcareous mudstone. These soils are clay from 0 cm to 102 cm (0 in to
40 in) and noncemented calcareous mudstone bedrock sandy clay loam from 102 cm to
203 cm (40 in to 80 in) (USDA 2017).



Houston soils are moderately well drained cyclic soils that formed in alkaline clays and
chalk of the Blackland Prairies. These soils consist of clay from 0 to 183 cm (0 to 72
inches) (USDA 2018).

PREVIOUS INVESTIGATIONS
Based on a site file search of the Texas Archaeological Sites Atlas database and literature search
and records review, the proposed project area will not impact any previously recorded
archaeological sites or other recorded cultural resources. There are no recorded archaeological
sites within a one mile radius of the project area. Additionally, there are no historic properties
listed on the National Register of Historic Places within a one mile radius of the project.
The Texas State Historical Marker Number 9421, located 0.97 mile south of the project area,
commemorates the Brooklyn Lodge No. 386. A.F. and A.M. This local Masonic Lodge was
organized in 1873 during which the community was known as Brooklyn, prior to its being
renamed Forney. The all-male fraternal organization met in a building that also served as the
school and union church, which apparently no longer stands. The current lodge hall at which the
marker is situated was completed in 1966.
Four previously conducted archaeological surveys are mapped within one mile of the project area
(Figure 4). No archaeological sites or other cultural resources were recorded by any of these
investigations.

RELEVANT CULTURAL HISTORY (1830S TO PRESENT)
During the late 1830s, the United States government carried out mass-deportation of Cherokees
from several southeastern states to that which eventually became known as eastern Oklahoma.
This forced march became known as the “Trail of Tears.” Along the way, many Cherokees
escaped and attempted to settle among local groups of indigenous people. An especially large
group of Cherokees established villages among the Caddo in the future Kaufman County.
However, by 1840, the Caddo of this area had pushed most of these Cherokees eastward into the
Piney Woods (Hart 2019).
In that year, another group of outsiders, frontier settlers from the Southeastern United States,
thrust themselves among these sedentary Caddo agriculturalists having inhabited the area
eventually organized as Kaufman County. A group of 40 people from Holly Springs, Mississippi
led by William P. King established a fortified settlement called King’s Fort. These settlers
inhabited lands approximately 72 kilometers (45 miles) south of Peter’s Colony, an earlier
frontier community noted for especially fertile soils in Fannin County (Minor 2019). This area
was widely publicized back east for its especially productive farmland. King and fellow
Mississippians had “purchased certificates for headrights” to occupy lands in this area. This
“rapidly” growing Euro-American settlement was variously called “Kingsboro” and “Fort de
Kingsboro” during the remaining years under Texas Republic governance. The Caddo appear to
have departed this area prior to annexation of Texas into the United States in 1845 (Hart 2019).
The United States granted statehood to Texas on April 21, 1845, causing Mexico to sever
diplomatic relations and to declare war. By 1847, the Americans had won the Mexican-American

8

war. In 1848 Mexico signed the terms of peace with the United States in the Treaty of Guadalupe
Hidalgo (Hoig 1993:171). By this action, all Euro-American settlers in Texas fell under legal
jurisdiction of the United States and of the State of Texas.
The last half of the 1840s represents a particularly rapidly changing world for this open prairie
area west of the Piney Woods and east of the Cross-Timbers. The King’s Fort colony fell under
the governing jurisdiction of Henderson County, with Athens as the seat of government, which
had been organized by the newly created State of Texas. Within Henderson County, “King
patented the survey that included King’s Fort with the new state government…on July 27, 1846”
(Hart 2019). The area’s earliest Euro-American settlers established farmsteads “near streams,
where water and wood were easily obtained”. These family-owned farms “produced mostly
wheat and corn”. With no mechanized farm equipment, farmers largely avoided the thick clays
of the Blackland Prairie. Thus, most of the county’s rural land remained out of production
throughout the 1840s through 1860s (Minor 2019).
In February 1848, state officials formed Kaufman County wholly from Henderson County in
honor of David Spangler Kaufman, an elected representative in the Republic of Texas Congress
and noted diplomat. During the next three years, indecision characterized community identities
and roles in the new government. The process of four successive elections resulted in the
establishment of the county seat at the original settlement in March 1851. Its residents finally
settled on the name “Kaufman” (Hart 2019).
With Comanche and their allies raiding settlers and otherwise ignoring concessions made in
recent treaties, the 1850s continued to be a violent period in areas not too far west of Kaufman
County. The United States Army installed several forts in the Southern Plains (Hoig 1993:171).
The Second Regiment, under Colonel Robert E. Lee and several other future Civil War generals,
launched several punitive strikes against the Comanche, providing them invaluable training
(Ibid:184). Settlers in Kaufman County and surrounding areas by the 1850s were experiencing
“no extended period of conflict” with Native Americans (Minor 2019).
No further mention can be found of Caddo in Kaufman or Henderson counties by the late 1840s.
Starting in that decade, most of Texas’ indigenous people groups, including Caddo, had gathered
in growing numbers in an area more than a hundred miles west of Kaufman County to escape
persecution and extermination in their original homelands.
During the 1850s, Kaufman County steadily grew. Settlers arrived in greatest numbers from
Tennessee, Arkansas, and Missouri. Some brought enslaved people of African heritage. Due to
relatively low interest in growing cotton prior to the Civil War, slavery never did dominate the
socioeconomic landscape of Kaufman County. By 1860, 533, or 15 percent, of the county’s
approximately 3,500 inhabitants were enslaved African Americans (Hart 2019).
The nearest market town with regional transportation into the rest of the United States was
Jefferson, Texas, located more than 177 kilometers (110 miles) east of Kaufman County. Neither
the Trinity River and its perennial branches, nor the Red River were navigable. Consequently,
the shipping of cash crops such as cotton, representing the agricultural and slave-based economy
that characterized most of the American South, was not feasible from such a remote area. Thus,
farming families with relatively little experience in slaveholding and cotton production were
attracted to settle this frontier area of North Texas (Minor 2019).
In 1861, three-fourths of Kaufman County voters supported secession from the Union. Elkanah
B. Greer organized the county’s largest regiment of Confederate soldiers from the area. Local

9

taxes were used to underwrite military supplies. Slave patrols were established throughout the
area. During subsequent Reconstruction, relatively few incidents of violence occurred. Rockwall
County was carved out of the northwest portion of Kaufman County in 1873 (Hart 2019).
Completion of the Texas and Pacific Railway between Longview and Dallas in 1873 suddenly
provided nationwide access for Kaufman County. This line stretched east-west across the county
several miles to the north of the county seat. One of the areas served was Forney (Hart 2019).
Nationally and internationally produced food products, pharmaceuticals, cosmetics, recreational
toys and goods, and building materials became more available and less expensive.
During the middle 1890s, a second rail line, the Texas Midland (T-M) Railroad was constructed
along a north-south orientation through Kaufman County, connecting the towns of Paris and
Garret, Texas. This provided rail access to the county seat of Kaufman and crossed the Texas and
Pacific in Terrell. The latter city became home to the T-M shops and offices. T-M Railroad
owner, Edward T. R. Green, personally established these facilities, thus strengthening the nonagricultural economy of Kaufman County (Hart 2019).
With such diverse markets suddenly made available and by economic delivery of modern
mechanical equipment, farmers began cultivating the challenging but extremely fertile Blackland
clays (Minor 2019). The economy of Kaufman County remained focused on agriculture
throughout the late 19th and early 20th centuries. The number of working farms tripled from 1,594
in 1880 to 5,131 in 1930. The leading crop throughout the 19th century was corn, which hit its
zenith in 1910 of 855,933 bushels. Wheat, which experienced considerable fluctuation, hit its alltime maximum of 175,405 bushels in 1920. Cotton steadily expanded productivity throughout
the period, eclipsing corn and wheat in becoming the dominant agricultural product by 1930. In
direct opposition to cotton trends were those projected by beef and dairy cattle. After having hit a
high-water mark in 1880, cattle production declined to lows in 1930 of 950 beef and 7,282 dairy
(Hart 2019).
From 1860 to 1880, population exploded more than four-fold, from 3,500 to 15,448. The relative
absence of violence in North Texas combined with the richness of the Blackland Prairie to draw
large throngs of persons having been displaced throughout the American South during the Civil
War and Reconstruction. During the next half-century, overall population further expanded more
than two and a half times, from 15,448 in 1880 to 40,905 in 1930. The African American
population disproportionately increased, with the overall percentage of African Americans more
than doubling from 13 to 29 percent over this timespan. During those early decades following the
Civil War, educational opportunities for freedmen had remained limited in Kaufman County
(Hart 2019) but gradually increased with this influx of settlement to work the fields of the
growing farming operations in the Blackland Prairie during the late 19th century.
By 1930, fifteen manufacturing firms employed 106 workers in the economy still dominated by
agriculture. Another non-farming component of the local economy was the Terrell State
Hospital, established in 1883 as the state’s second institution serving as full-time residence for
mentally ill citizens. In 1903, the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) established
an experimental farm under the direction of Seaman A. Knapp for developing methods in
combatting the boll weevil that was decimating cotton production across Texas. The result was
development of America’s first privately owned and operated demonstration farm north of Terrell
(Hart 2019).
The Great Depression took a considerable toll on the Kaufman County economy. Following
steady growth over half a century, the number of active farms plummeted from 5,131 in 1930 to

10

less than 3,930 in 1940. During that decade, farm values fell by 56 percent, and unemployment
skyrocketed from 2 percent to more than 16 percent. To restore economic stability, the
Administration of President Franklin D. Roosevelt, as part of the New Deal, established a
Civilian Conservation Corps camp near Kaufman, and a machine shop in Kaufman maintained by
the National Youth Administration. The Works Progress Administration spent more than $1
million on roads, bridges, and other construction projects in Kaufman County. Under
sponsorship of the Rural Electrification Administration, the Kaufman County Electrical
Cooperative made electricity widely available throughout the county beginning in 1938 (Hart
2019). Quality of life for farm families increased as a result of these federal programs instituted
to end the Great Depression (Minor 2019).
Overall population numbers dropped from 40,905 to 29,931 in 1960. The number of farms
continued to drop, reaching approximately 2,360 in 1970 but slightly rose to 2,438 by 2002.
Agricultural jobs dominated until after 1970. By this time, Kaufman County began experiencing
urbanization, as the main towns of Terrell and Kaufman gradually became part of the Dallas-Fort
Worth Metroplex. Agriculture remained a significant economic factor, with 48 percent of rural
land being devoted to row crops, 43 percent to pasture for livestock, and 7 percent to woodlands
in 2002. The opening of Interstate Highway 20 connecting Dallas and Shreveport stimulated
steady increased commercial development. Persons employed in factories, service, and other
non-agricultural industries dramatically increased at the expense of farming and supporting
agricultural jobs (Hart 2019).
Kaufman County became highly integrated into the Dallas-Fort Worth Metroplex over the past
three decades. Between 1990 and 2014, the county’s population doubled from 52,220 to 111,263.
In that year, Forney with 16,943 eclipsed Terrell (at 16,287) as the county’s largest city. Terrell
had held that distinction for more than a century. The county seat of Kaufman remained the
county’s third largest city with 6,829 residents in 2015. To provide water for the D/FW
Metroplex and to provide flood control, Cedar Creek Reservoir and Lake Ray Hubbard had been
developed in the county during the mid-20th century and emerged after 2000 as popular
recreational destinations (Hart 2019).

RESEARCH DESIGN
Sphere 3 performed all necessary cultural resources investigations in connection with the
proposed Forney ISD new middle school campus. These investigations were conducted to locate
prehistoric and historic cultural resources sites within the property, delineate the vertical and
horizontal extent of each site, and make preliminary evaluations of each site's integrity and
potential for SAL designation and/or NRHP eligibility.
Prior to initiating the fieldwork, Sphere 3 acquired a Texas Antiquities Permit. Sphere 3
conducted a records search for SALs, Historic Markers, properties listed on or eligible for
inclusion in the NRHP, previously recorded sites documented at TARL, as officially managed by
THC, previous survey reports available online through the Texas Archeological Site Atlas
(TASA). Topographic maps, aerial images, and Google Earth imagery from the past 101 years
was analyzed for modern and historic impacts to the property.
The pedestrian cultural resources survey relied on both visual examination at 30 m (100 ft)
intervals and shovel testing. The visual examination focused on areas with exposed soil surfaces
(e.g., tire tracks, animal disturbances, etc.). The survey of the large ploughed agricultural field

11

that makes up the central and northern portions of the project area was planned to focus primarily
on visual examination with limited shovel testing; however, the field became increasingly more
overgrown as one traveled east and thus the methodology was switched to shovel testing at a 90 x
100 m (295.3 x 328 ft) grid. The small rectangular field on the south side of the project area was
shovel tested at an interval of 110 x 110 m (360.9 x 360.9 ft). The western arm of the project area
was shovel tested at 30 m intervals along streams and a 110 x 110 m (360.9 x 360.9 ft) grid in all
other areas. All shovel tests were excavated in 10 cm levels down to the clay substrate with the
deepest test at 55 cmbs to reach the clay layer. The excavated matrix was screened through a
0.635 cm (0.25 in) wire mesh screen. Shovel test locations were recorded with a GPS capable of
one m (3.28 ft) accuracy. For each shovel test unit, notes were made in the shovel test form of
soil color, texture, and extent of soil layers and of the maximum depth.
Upon finding an artifact, shovel tests were excavated solely within the project area boundaries at
approximately 20.0 m (65.6 ft) intervals or less until the site limits could be delineated using
surface features/artifacts or two consecutive negative shovel tests. Surface features were mapped
with a GPS. Photos were taken of the site area. A soil profile was described and photographed
from a positive shovel test on the site, and a State of Texas Archeological Site Data Form was
completed for each new site discovered. Sub-surface artifacts were collected by shovel test
number and 10 cm (3.9 in) level.
In the case of a historic site for which an unusual abundance of certain classes of non-diagnostic
fragments of bottle glass, iron, brick, or other common material are found on the surface, only
representative samples shall be required to be collected and curated in accordance with State
Antiquities Permit guidelines. All diagnostic historic and other historic cultural objects recovered
during investigations that do not meet these criteria, as well as all prehistoric cultural objects,
were collected.
Following completion of the field survey, all collected artifacts were washed, cataloged and
analyzed to determine cultural affiliation. Site forms, artifacts, maps and photographs, along with
documents containing other field data shall be curated at TARL.

RESULTS
This cultural resource investigation was conducted under the Antiquities Code of Texas. No
federal funding or permitting was involved. The cultural resources investigations for the
proposed development included an analysis of topographic maps and aerial imagery from the past
101 years followed by an intensive pedestrian survey. Soil profiles of all excavated shovel tests
are found in Appendix A: Table 1. Field specimens collected during the investigation are
recorded in Appendix A: Tables 2-5. The investigations were successful in documenting four
archaeological sites.

IMAGERY AND TOPOGRAPHIC ANALYSIS
Google Earth aerial imagery, historic aerial imagery from 1953, and topographic maps from:
1919 and 1963 (Photoinspected 1973), (Figures 5, 6, and 2 respectively), illustrate the modern use
of the project area and its immediate surroundings.
The project area appears to have been largely used for agricultural purposes or was otherwise
undeveloped in 1919. The 1919 topographic map indicates the presence of three structures within
the project area; two in the western arm of the project area and one along the north border. Two

of these structures are mapped in the location of the newly discovered 41KF189 and 41KF191. A
1953 aerial image reveals the project area is still primarily used for agricultural purposes. The
aerial image does not show any trace of the two structures that had been mapped in the western
arm; however, it does show the structure that had been mapped along the northern border of the
project area. The image also shows activity along eastward along the northern border that
coincides with the location of Site 41KF190. It is unclear if the aerial image shows the structure
itself or perhaps the clearing of the house location. A third area of activity is shown on the aerial
in the northeastern most corner of the project area. It is unclear whether this is another structure
or if it is the beginnings of the large pond currently in that area. A topographic map published in
1963 and photoinspected in 1973 reveals the presence of the two structures along the northern
border of the project area. An additional outbuilding has been constructed near the western most
structure. A new structure also appears in the southeastern corner of the western arm of the
project area. The two structures that had been shown on the 1919 map in the western arm are not
present on this newer map.
Google Earth aerial imagery from 1995 to the present was also reviewed. Imagery from 1995
reveals the presence of one structure at the mapped location of the two westernmost structures
shown on the 1963 and 1975 map. The second structure eastward along the northern border of
the project area is also shown on the 1995 aerial. No other structures are visible within the
project area at this time. The westernmost northern structure disappears in 2001. The other
northern structure remains standing to the present day. The pond in the northeastern corner of the
project area appears in the 1995 aerial. In the following 2001 aerial, a small shed has been
constructed on the west side of the pond and the beginnings of what is presently a large modern
trash pile can be seen just to the southwest of the storage shed.

PROPERTY DEED RECORDS RESEARCH
A search was conducted at the office of the Kaufman County Clerk, as located in the Kaufman
County Courthouse, Kaufman, Texas, of documents of real property deeds of land areas within
and adjacent to the project area (Kaufman County Clerk [KCC] 2019). Forney ISD purchased
approximately 230 acres of the 263 acre tract from the West family trust, as documented in the
property deed Volume (V) 5929, page (pp) 337 following (ff) (2/7/2019). Soon following the
land purchase by Gordon T. West, various children, grandchildren, in-laws, and corporate or trust
organizations of the West family held title to these approximately 230 acres of mostly farmland.
Family members resided in the area of Wichita Falls, Texas and in Nebraska but not in Kaufman
County. They appear to have made few changes to the landscape as they apparently collected
rental income from farmers and residents occupying the two dwellings situated along the
northeast boundary (i.e. sites 41KF189 and 41KF190). The dwelling of the former site location
was demolished several years ago. The latter site’s dwelling was occupied until recently. It
presumably was abandoned when Forney ISD acquired this land. These internal family
transactions are documented in six successive real property deeds: V4985 pp421ff (2/24/2016),
V3769 pp284ff (5/11/2010), V3526 pp618ff (1/20/2009), V1207 pp772ff (3/4/1996), V879
pp419ff (1/12/1987), and V666, pp283ff (11/16/1961). From exhaustive examination of each
deed record, no mention could be found of any buildings or other improvements anywhere on this
property.
On October 20, 1961, Gordon T. West of Wichita County, Texas purchased these approximately
230 acres from Frank and Sinia Jane Nehrmeyer of Kaufman County. These lands were
transferred under two separate deed transactions: a 117.79-acre rectangular tract to the northeast
(V444 pp 639ff [10/20/1961]), and a 114-acre tract comprising two rectangular areas forming a
six-sided polygon to the southwest (V444 pp614ff [10/20/1961]). It is curious that Mr. and Mrs.

15

Nehrmeyer on the same day sold this land under separate property deed transactions. For the
117.79-acre rectangular northeast portion, which contains archaeological sites 41KF189 and
41KF190, the Nehrmeyers had obtained the tract from descendants of Pinson sometime during
the 1930s, 40s, or 50s. The actual deed documenting the date of this acquisition was not located
and is not referenced anywhere in Nehrmeyer’s deeds.
Interestingly, in the Nehrmeyer-to-West 117.79-acre deed (V444 pp614ff [10/20/1961]) is found
cited an earlier deed transferring this tract, as part of a 316.67-acre tract of land from R. P. Pinson
et al. conveyed to Vesta K. Jordan (V183 pp607ff [2/23/1922]). This deed, in turn, referenced a
deed in which R. P. Pinson gave the land to his son, J. W. Pinson a 200-acre tract of land that
appears to contain these 117.79 acres (V177 pp29ff [2/4/1909]). This is the oldest deed identified
as associated with lands within this project area. This document was found to be devoid of
information regarding any previous owners, other than the original landowner, Juan Lopez. This
lack of detail may suggest that the land had been under Pinson ownership for many decades well
back into the 19th century. Several deeds of adjoining lands were researched, and none of them
revealed any hint as to the owner of this tract prior to 1909. In none of these deeds were found
any mention of dwellings or other buildings, including the two early to middle 20th century
residential dwellings from which developed the subsurface expression forming those two
aforementioned newly recorded archaeological sites.
For the 114-acre six-sided southwest portion, which contains archaeological sites 41KF191 and
41KF192, no trace of property owners previous to Frank Nehrmeyer could be found in any deed
records. The deed records tracking this property from the most recent transaction by Forney ISD
back to the 1961 deed contained no mention of earlier owners. All other property deed records of
adjacent tracts going back to the 1920s were examined, and none mentioned the owner of this
tract, other than the original land survey having been deeded to Juan Lopez in the 1830s or 40s,
which consisted of a huge tract encompassing much of the area north and west of the present
town of Forney. This absence of information about previous owners may suggest the possibility
that the 114-acre portion of the Nehrmeyer farm had remained under Nehrmeyer ownership for
many years going back to before the turn of the 20th century, during which the Pinsons owned the
neighboring farm to the northeast. The substantial ridgecrest farmstead constituting site 41KF191
may indeed have been occupied by the Nehrmeyer family and/or tenants working their land. In
all of the deed records examined, no reference was found of any buildings on this tract.
The approximately 34-acre tract forming the west squarish tract of the Forney ISD project area
was never owned by either the Nehrmeyer or West families. It was acquired from Pacific PinsonForney Company and its chain of deeds also fades into obscurity during the 1920s. As far as can
be determined from USGS topo maps and aerial imagery, this tract, as bordered on the southwest
by FM 740, never has had a building or domestic dwelling located on it.

INTENSIVE PEDESTRIAN SURVEY SUPPORTED BY SHOVEL TESTING
Visual inspection was supported by shovel testing at set intervals, in accordance with guidelines
issued by the THC. For the purposes of discussion, the project area is divided into three main
areas. The first is the large ploughed agricultural field that forms the central and northern
portions of the project area. The second is the smaller rectangular field south of the ploughed
field. The third is the western arm extending off the side of the ploughed field (Figure 7).
Detailed soil profiles of all shovel tests can be found in Appendix A: Table 1. The pedestrian
survey succeeded in documenting four new archaeological sites; 41KF189, 41KF190, 41KF191,
and 41KF 192. Detailed site descriptions can be found at the end of the Results section.

Large Agricultural Field
The agricultural field was initially planned to be largely focused on visual examination.
Transects were to be walked at 30 meter intervals with sporadic shovel testing. Shovel testing
was tightened to 30 meter intervals along a swale resulting from a tributary of Buffalo Creek that
extends into the field from the west. Shovel tests were also placed at the locations of the two
houses mapped on the topographic maps along the northern border. As the visual pedestrian
transects were walked beginning in the west and moving eastward, visibility became increasingly
impaired by a dense overgrowth of sunflowers. The shovel testing was therefore altered to a 90 x
100 m (295.3 x 328 ft grid). Shovel testing within the agricultural field found mainly shallow
dark clay with an occasional thin layer of clay loam overtop. Shovel testing conducted at the two
locations of marked structures succeeded in locating remnants of both historic occupations.
These two new archaeological sites were then delineated at 10 and 20 m (32.8 and 65.6 ft)
intervals. The western most location was designated as 41KF189 and the eastern location as
41KF190. Outside of the two archaeological sites, no shovel tests were found to contain cultural
materials.
A trash pile containing 20th century materials was observed in the southwestern area of the
agricultural field along a tree line/property boundary extending into the field from the south. The
trash pile contained materials such as plywood, asphalt shingles, foam insulation, rubber garden
hose, plastic storage crate, and shoes. The shovel test placed right next to the pile (M13) and all
others around it proved negative for any buried materials in the area. The trash pile may be
related to a house mapped on the 1963/1973 topographic map beyond the tree line/property
boundary in the western arm section of the project area. No trace was found at the mapped
location suggesting perhaps this trash pile may represent remains moved and/or piled up
elsewhere by farming activities.
A second trash pile containing modern materials likely late 20th to 21st century materials was
observed in the northeast corner of the agricultural field approximately 10 meters outside the
project area to the east. Materials observed in the pile included modern brick, tires, plastic
bottles, tennis shoes, and a Lowes gift card. North of the trash pile and still beyond the project
area boundary to the east was observed a green telephone electrical box. All shovel tests dug
along the project boundary in this area (A17, A18, and A19) proved to be negative. Due to the
modern nature of the materials observed and the absence of any cultural artifacts extending into
the project area, no archaeological site was recorded in this area.
A third, very large, trash pile of modern materials less than 50 years old was found along the
northern border of the project area just west of the pond in the northeast corner. This pile
contains materials such as furniture, food containers, beer bottles, mattresses, ceiling fans,
cardboard, suitcases, and three broken down trucks. Google Earth aerial imagery shows the
development of this pile of trash beginning sometime between 1995 and 2001.
Southern Rectangular Field
This section of the project area is located south of the large agricultural field and north of FM
740. This area is comprised of an open field overgrown with various grasses and brush. Several
rows of cotton plants were observed along the eastern side of the section suggesting this area had
once been a cultivated field as well. Shovel testing in this area was conducted at a 110 x 110 m
(360.9 x 360.9 ft) grid. Soils in this section were similar to the large agricultural field consisting
of shallow dark clay with an occasional thin layer of humus/clay loam overtop. No shovel tests

18

were found to be positive for cultural materials in this section. No cultural materials were
observed on the surface of this section aside from modern road garbage from FM 740.

Western Arm
The western arm section consists of a north/south oriented ridge line that slopes steeply
downward to the west, north, and south. Vegetation in this area was mostly short grasses with
occasional cedar and mixed hardwood forest along two tributaries of Buffalo Creek that extend
into the project area in the northwestern and southeastern corners the section. Shovel testing was
conducted at a 110 x 110 m (360.9 x 360.9 ft) grid tightened to 30 m (100 ft) intervals along the
tributaries and extra shovel tests excavated in locations of mapped structures. A pile of rusted
metal was found in the creek bed of the southeastern tributary. These metal pieces contained no
intrinsic diagnostic information and were not associated with any positive shovel test and were
thus no recorded as an archaeological site. Similarly, a large motor of some kind was found
dumped in this section. It is unclear what the motor may have been a part of or when it was
dumped in its current location and nearby shovel tests proved to be negative, thus it was not
recorded as an archaeological site. Soils in this section consisted mostly of shallow dark clay
with an occasional thin layer of humus/sandy clay overtop. The 1963/1973 topographic map
contains a mapped structure in the southeastern corner of the section. Two shovel tests, N59 and
M14, were excavated at this location but did not find any evidence of the structure. Shovel tests
in the surrounding area also proved negative for cultural materials. The previously discussed
trash pile found in the southwestern corner of the large agricultural field may represent remains
from this structure that may have been moved and piled up elsewhere by farming activities over
the years. Shovel testing in this area located two new archaeological sites, 41KF191 at the
location of a structure mapped on the 1919 topographic map and 41KF192 approximately 20
meters (65.6 feet) east of 41KF191.
Site 41KF189
Site 41KF189 is a medium- to high-density historic farmstead located along a once-public county
road that recently has become a private gravel road (Figure 8). The site is “D-shaped” and
consists of thirteen contiguous positive shovel tests and a surface expression containing a wide
variety of cultural objects associated with a demolished residence constructed prior to 1919. The
site is approximately 150 m (493 ft) northwest-southeast by 63 m (205 ft) northeast-southwest.
The following visible remnants from cultural activities were mapped:






Debris pile containing corrugated iron siding and roof material, bricks, concrete blocks,
and other cultural materials piled up in the northwest area of the site;
Brush pile containing recently shredded underbrush and tree limbs;
Surface and subsurface archaeological feature comprising a circular cropmark and a
vertical pipe emerging from beneath the surface;
Large, dense artifact surface scatter feature including numerous vessel glass shards,
window glass shards, whiteware, stoneware, and various metal components of machinery
and furniture;
Three small artifact surface scatters, each containing fewer than five cultural objects.

The house is depicted on the 1919 and 1963 USGS topo maps. The latter map also reveals an
outbuilding situated to the northwest of the house. Neither structure is present on aerial images
dating to the past decade. The debris pile, archaeological feature, and four surface scatters are

likely the result of daily occupation followed by demolition of these two structures found mapped
on the 1963 USGS Topo. Vegetation consisted of short grasses in the main open area and a thick
stand of sunflowers in the cultivated field comprising the Large Agricultural Field Section the
project area. To the north and the south of the manicured lawn area lie two areas of cedars and
other hardwood trees associated with moderately thick greenbriers and other underbrush.
Soils in the site consisted mainly of loamy clay to thick clay underlying layer, extending to depths
of between 17 and 55 cmbs. There is little variation in the soil profiles of the shovel tests
excavated in the site.
The limits of the site’s subsurface expression were delineated by excavating shovel tests 20 and
then 10 meters along the NW-SE 45-degree angle orientation directions from each positive shovel
test location. The thirteen positive locations triggered a total of twenty-five negative delineation
shovel tests, including preliminarily excavated standard-program units, for a total of 38 shovel
test units within the site.
Positive shovel test, B18, was selected to be photographed to provide a visual representation of
the soil stratigraphy of the unusually intact cropmark-vertical pipe archaeological feature
(Appendix B, Photograph #24). This especially diverse collection of artifact classes and types
(Appendix A, Table 2) was found to contain an extremely dense concentration of 44 cultural
objects between 0 and 38 cmbs. The unusually high artifact density strengthens the argument that
this feature was intensively utilized for some as-of-yet unidentified cultural function during the
lifetime of the associated residential building, as depicted in the 1919 and 1963 USGS Topo
maps. The uncommon diversity of classes, including slag, may indicate that this feature was used
relatively early in the house’s active years, followed by abandonment and subsequent gradual
backfill with garbage from daily domestic activities. Because of the generally shallow depths
below which the subsurface cultural expression of site 41KF189 did not penetrate, it was
unnecessary to extend the unit for providing an unobstructed view of the 48-cm south wall profile
of shovel test B18. One suspects that the most likely function of this circular feature with vertical
pipe is sewage disposal.
The subsurface expression consists of the single partially buried archaeological feature and
thirteen positive shovel test units. A total of 117 historic-area cultural objects were collected
(Appendix A: Table 1). Chronologically diagnostic artifacts included:







Twelve wire nails, late 1870s – present (Wells 1998: 92, 96);
One solarized vessel shard, 1885 – 1920 (Horn 2005);
One aqua shard, one vessel glass, early 19th C – 1920s (Lindsey 2017; Horn 2005);
One stoneware – Albany slip, 1850 – 1940 (Potter et al. 2006; Stelle 2001);
One burned salt-glazed stoneware (Potter et al. 2006);
One plastic fragment, modern.

Non-diagnostic finds included: brick fragments, modern Portland cement fragments, wire nails,
whiteware vessel sherds, colorless windowpane and vessel glass shards, milk glass – Mason jar
cap liner, mussel shell, mirror shard, slag, indeterminate ferrous metal wire, ferrous metal flat and
irregular fragments, brass fragments, synthetic vinyl fragments, rubber straps, charred wood, and
charcoal fragments interpreted as reflective of cultural activity associated with the residential site.

21

The site’s surface expression is documented by the presence of two archaeological features and
one pile of corrugated iron siding and roofing materials, concrete fragments, and bricks, as
mapped in Figure 8. Chronologically diagnostic artifacts included:
 Two solarized vessel shards, 1885 – 1920 (Horn 2005);
 Four aqua shards (one windowpane and three vessel glass), early 19th C – 1920s (Lindsey
2017; Horn 2005);
 One stoneware – Bristol slip exterior/Albany slip interior, 1850 – 1940 (Potter et al.
2006; Stelle 2001);
 One automotive drain valve, circa 1920s (found in an eBay search of automotive parts);
 One shotgun shell, modern.
The non-diagnostic finds collected from the ground surface included: modern Portland cement
fragment, whiteware vessel sherd, porcelain sherd, milk glass – Genuine Boyd Mason jar cap
liner shard (Genuine Boyd liners first patented in 1869), amber vessel shard, sickle bar mower
blade, and ferrous metal gear (Lockhart et al 2014).
Based on historic maps, aerial images, two archaeological features, and 34 diagnostic artifacts,
Site 41KF189 is a farmstead comprising a residential building, a major agricultural out-building
in its northwest area near the massive debris pile, and assorted supporting facilities and structures.
The presence of twelve wire nails suggests that this farmstead began to be constructed after wire
nails had become dominant, i.e. around or just after 1900 but prior to ca. 1920. The widespread
presence of solarized and aqua vessel glass and windowpanes suggests that this habitation was
well established by the 1920s. The presence of multiple stoneware and the 1920s automobile
drain valve reinforce this early 20th century domestic activity prior to 1940. The presence of this
farmstead on the 1963 USGS Topo map and an early aerial image from 1953 and of multiple
cultural objects of “modern manufacture” combine to indicate continued presence of domestic
activity well into the mid-20th century. However, absence of any buildings on recent USGS Topo
maps and aerials suggests the abandonment and complete demolition of this farmstead sometime
between 1963 and the 1990s.
In the Blackland Prairie agricultural areas of North Texas, numerous farmsteads and associated
archaeological contexts listed in and eligible for inclusion in the NRHP and eligible for
designation as a SAL exist. No trace of the actual buildings comprising this farmstead were
identified during surface inspection and shovel testing. In contrast to other well preserved
existing late 19th and early 20th century farmsteads, this site presents limited research value. Site
41KF189 may extend beyond the limits of the project area. The portion of the site within the
project boundaries is recommended as not eligible for inclusion in the NRHP or for listing as a
SAL, and the uninvestigated area outside of the project area remain unevaluated.
Site 41KF190
Site 41KF190 is a low-density historic residential architectural and archaeological site located
along a once-public county road that recently has become a private gravel road (Figure 9). This
site is situated approximately 259 meters (850 feet) southeast of Site 41KF189. The centerpiece
of this site is a residence which appears to have been in continuous use in this location since the
1920s or 1930s. This estimate of age of the dwelling is based upon architectural elements, such
as “Novelty” siding and distinctively steep pitched roof. Based on the topo and aerial maps it was
constructed sometime between 1919 and 1963, as no conclusive aerial data could be found to
establish a more refined age bracket. The site is an irregular “D-shaped” form consisting of ten
contiguous positive shovel tests and the recently abandoned house and associated scatter of

modern materials. The site is approximately 100 m (329 ft) northwest-southeast by 59 m (192 ft)
northeast-southwest.
Several recently manufactured items were observed throughout the yard, including a basketball
goal, trampoline, soccer ball, VHS tapes, and markers. These recent items were not mapped.
Somewhat older visible elements included a small cavity exposing buried horizontally oriented
polyvinyl (PVC) pipe along the southeast side of the dwelling and another cavity further to the
south revealing a large plastic casing. Both of these features are less than 50 years of age, as
PVC and other synthetic materials for plumbing functions did not come into general use until the
1970s.
A mechanical device associated with a vertical pipe (likely 50 to 100 years old) was mapped in
the southeast corner of the site, approximately 35 meters (115 feet) from the east corner of the
dwelling. The machine features a large wheel accommodating a belt for being operated by a
gasoline engine, likely for a water pump for a water well (Appendix B, Photograph #28).
The house is not depicted in the 1919 USGS Topo Map but is in existence on every map and
aerial image of this area beginning with the 1963 USGS Topo Map. The aerial image from 1953
shows some activity at this location but it is unclear whether the image shows the actual house or
perhaps some sort of clearing of the area. No outbuildings or additional structures are found on
any of these depictions. The only structural feature is a dog kennel associated with a fenced dog
run. It is unlikely more than 50 years of age.
Vegetation consisted of tall grass growing throughout yard around the abandoned house. A field
of sunflowers is located in the northwest and southwest part of the site. To the southeast of the
house is an area of cedars and other hardwood trees associated with moderately thick greenbrier
and other underbrush.
Soils in the site consisted mainly of loamy clays to a thick clay underlying layer, extending to
depths of between 15 and 42 cm (Appendix B: Photograph #26). There was little variation in the
soil profiles throughout the site.
The limits of the site’s subsurface expression were delineated by excavating shovel tests 20 and
then 10 meters along the NW-SE 45-degree angle orientation directions from each positive shovel
test location. The ten positive locations triggered a total of nineteen negative delineation shovel
tests, including preliminarily excavated standard-program units, for a total of 29 shovel test units
within the site.
Seventy-one historic-era cultural objects were collected from the ten positive shovel tests
(Appendix A: Table 2). Chronologically diagnostic artifacts included:




One machine-cut square nail, 1830s – present (Nelson 1968) but drastically reduced after
1910s;
One foil wrapper, modern;
Six plastic fragments, modern.

Non-diagnostic finds included: brick fragments, modern Portland cement fragments, asphalt
shingle fragment, wire nails, metal crown bottle cap, whiteware vessel sherd, porcelain vessel
sherd, colorless vessel glass shards, animal bone fragments, mussel shell, mirror shard, ferrous
metal fragments, threaded metal ring, metal hose or tube connector, rubber straps, polished

granite fragment, and charcoal fragments interpreted as reflective of cultural activity associated
with the residential site.
In the Blackland Prairie agricultural areas of North Texas, numerous farmsteads and associated
archaeological contexts listed in and eligible for inclusion in the NRHP and eligible for
designation as a SAL exist. The standing house is in poor condition and there are many
residential buildings of similar age and architectural style in North Texas that are in far better
condition and have more structural integrity. In contrast to those well-preserved buildings and
intact archaeological contexts, this building has poor integrity and is associated with a very lowdensity archaeological site. Consequently, this site is assessed as having limited research value.
Site 41KF190 may extend beyond the limits of the project area. The portion of the site within the
project boundaries is recommended as not eligible for inclusion in the NRHP or for listing as a
SAL, and the uninvestigated area outside of the project area remain unevaluated.
Site 41KF191
Site 41KF191 is a large, medium- to high-density historic farmstead site located in the western
part of the project area (Figure 10). The site is a large, irregularly-shaped polygon consisting of
twenty contiguous positive shovel tests and surface expression containing a wide variety of
cultural objects associated with a demolished residential dwelling constructed prior to 1919 atop a
nose ridge. The unusually dense positive shovel test B70 located due south of the hilltop dwelling
location possibly indicates an associated smaller dwelling downslope.. The site appears to extend
beyond the project area to the south/southwest of the project area. The site area is approximately
151 meters (497 feet) north-south by 137 meters (449 feet) east-west as delineated within the
boundaries of the project area
The location of the north house mapped on the 1919 USGS topo map would appear to have been
confirmed by the relatively heavy ground surface and subsurface expressions atop this rise
(Appendix B, Photograph #34). Just to the east of ST 53 lies a small debris pile, which is the
only feature identified at site 41KF191. A tenant residential dwelling or other agricultural outbuilding may have existed in association with unusually dense shovel test B70 situated 80 meters
(262 feet) south of shovel test B53, regarded as the site’s centroid atop the finger nose ridge. The
1919 topographic map illustrates the presence of another structure approximately 182.9 meters
(600 feet) south/southeast of the structure atop the hill. The spike in artifact density around B70
may represent remains from this southern structure or an unmapped structure. The presence of
two machine-cut square nails and three wire nails in B70 suggests that this farmstead began to be
constructed prior to the near-complete domination of the construction nail market by massproduced fasteners from wire by circa 1910. Both buildings are absent on the 1963 USGS topo
map and all aerial images from the past 60 years. No outbuildings or other supporting facilities
are shown on any of these cartographic and aerial documents.
Vegetation consisted of short to tall grasses growing between several scattered mottes of cedar
and hardwood trees. According to study of past aerial photographs and USGS topographic maps,
the project area was never covered by dense woodlands that are found to characterize low-lying
areas northwest of the project area. No ornamental bulbs or other exotic or intrusive vegetation
were observed throughout the environs of the site. Some of these mottes are associated with
sufficiently thick greenbriers and other underbrush so as to hinder effective inspection of the
ground surface, especially along the southern margins of the site.
Soils in the site’s flat-topped finger ridge and upper slopes consisted mainly of loamy clay to a
thick clay underlying layer, extending to depths of between 28 and 37 cm as observed in the

initial positive shovel test, B53 (Appendix B: Photograph #35). Shovel test B53 was selected to
be photographed to provide a visual representation of the soil stratigraphy at the site. This
especially dense unit was found to contain seven cultural objects between 0 and 28 cmbs.
Because of the generally shallow depths below which the subsurface cultural expression of site
41KF191 did not penetrate where tested across this site area, it was unnecessary to extend the unit
for providing an unobstructed view of the 35-cm west wall profile of shovel test B18. Soils
inshovel tests along the western slopes and in the south are a bright yellow clay loam to clay.
None of the black to very dark brown waxy clays exist in these lower-slope areas of the site.
The limits of the site’s subsurface expression were delineated by excavating shovel tests 20 and
then 10 meters along the cardinal directions from each positive shovel test location. The twenty
positive locations triggered a total of 50 negative delineation shovel tests, including preliminarily
excavated standard-program units, for a total of 70 shovel test units within the site.
The subsurface expression of Site 41KF191 consists of twenty positive shovel test units. A total
of 90 subsurface historic-era field specimens were collected (Appendix A: Table 1).

One Moroline colorless glass vessel base shard, Patented 1931 by Plough Inc. (19311991) (U.S. Patent Office: 297; Valk et al. 211);
One Stoneware – Bristol slip exterior/Albany slip interior, 1850 – 1940 (Potter et al.
2006; Stelle 2001).

Non-diagnostic finds collected from the ground surface included: two colorless windowpane
shards, two vessel glass shards, three whiteware vessel sherds, amber vessel shard, cast iron
pot/other vessel fragment, metal screw, synthetic vinyl fragment, and multi-color glass marble
gaming piece.
Based on historic maps, aerial images and 34 diagnostic artifacts, Site 14KF191 is a farmstead
comprising a residential building likely constructed during the late 19th century atop the nose
ridge and a possible second building of similar age located downslope to the south. Widespread
presence of solarized and aqua vessel glass and windowpanes combine with the Western New
Chief shotgun shell suggest that this habitation and agricultural operation was well established by
the 1910s. The presence of stoneware and other early 20th century diagnostics and the absence of
any modern manufactured items reinforce suggest abandonment and demolition or physical
moving of the main building had occurred prior to the 1960s. No building or structure appears in
this location on the 1963 USGS topo map nor in any aerial images of the middle 20 th century.
This farmstead appears to have been developed a few decades prior to the development of Site
41KF189.
In the Blackland Prairie agricultural areas of North Texas, numerous farmsteads and associated
archaeological contexts listed in and eligible for inclusion in the NRHP and eligible for
designation as a SAL exist. No trace of the actual buildings comprising this farmstead could be
identified through this surface inspection or shovel testing. No archaeological features were
identified. In contrast to these well preserved existing late 19th and early 20th century farmsteads,
this site presents limited research value despite exhibiting moderately high densities on the
ground surface and in several shovel tests. No location within this large farmstead site appeared
to exhibit any reasonable potential for containing thick, intact architectural contexts preserved
below the ground surface. Site 41KF191 may extend beyond the limits of the project area. The
portion of the site within the project boundaries is recommended as not eligible for inclusion in
the NRHP or for listing as a SAL, and the uninvestigated area outside of the project area remain
unevaluated.
Site 41KF192
Site 41KF192 is a low-density historic artifact scatter located in the western part of the project
area (Figure 11). The site is a small, irregularly-shaped ovoid consisting of three positive shovel
tests and surface expression containing two large piles of ferrous metal objects near the site’s
central positive unit. These components appear to be remnants of long abandoned tractor and/or
other agricultural equipment. Little evidence exists for a domestic activity area within this site.
The site is approximately 74 m (244 ft) north-south by 64 m (209 ft) east-west.
Vegetation consisted of short to tall grasses growing in relatively open areas. Several dense
mottes of cedars and other hardwood trees with thick greenbrier and other underbrush are present
making accessibility for ground surface inspection challenging.
Soils in the site consisted mainly of black to dark brown loamy clay to thick clay underlying
layer, extending to depths of between 19 and 30 cm (Appendix B, Photograph #54). Soil profiles
were similar across this site.

None of the USGS topo maps or any of the aerial images depict any hint of a building or structure
ever having stood in this area. . These piles were possibly created about the same time as was the
smaller debris pile of nearby Site 41KF191, and were most likely the result of abandonment of a
tractor and other farm equipment. The limits of the site’s subsurface expression were delineated
by excavating shovel tests 20 and then 10 meters along the cardinal directions from each
positive shovel test location. The three positive locations triggered a total of eighteen negative
delineation shovel tests for a total of 21 shovel test units within the site.
Site 41KF192 consists of a subsurface expression as indicated by three positive shovel test units.
From these contexts were recovered and collected a total of nineteen field specimens that are
certain or likely to be historic-era cultural objects (Appendix A: Table 1). The chronologically
diagnostic artifacts were:



One Aqua vessel glass shard; early 19th C – 1920s (Lindsey 2017; Horn 2005);
2 Colorless bottle screw-threaded rim shard; likely post 1920s (Lindsey 2019).

Non-diagnostic finds included: fourteen colorless glass vessel shards, one colorless glass vessel
shard with raised linear decoration, and one yellow-green flat glass shard.
The site’s surface expression includes two piles of rusted ferrous metal, one colorless glass vessel
shard with raised linear decoration, and one sickle bar mower blade. None were chronologically
diagnostic. Artifact density throughout the site is low. No features were identified.
Based on the three diagnostic artifacts, Site 41KF192 is most likely composed of garbage from
the nearby farmsteads. Site 41KF191, also newly recorded by this investigation, is located
approximately 20 meters to the west of Site 41KF192 and likely contained two residential
dwellings. A residence is observed as mapped on the 1963 USGS topo map approximately 25
meters (82 feet) east of the site; however, no evidence of this was discovered during surface or
subsurface investigations. This site, a thinly scattered distribution of mostly colorless glass and
ferrous metal objects, is most likely a garbage deposition from either or both nearby residential
dwelling locations.
In the Blackland Prairie agricultural areas of North Texas, numerous farmsteads and associated
archaeological contexts listed in and eligible for inclusion in the NRHP and eligible for
designation as a SAL exist. No trace of any building or other facility or object could be identified
through this surface and subsurface investigations. No archaeological features were identified.
This small, low-density site presents almost no research value. No location within this large
farmstead site appeared to exhibit any reasonable potential for containing thick, intact
architectural contexts preserved below the ground surface. This site thus is recommended as not
eligible for inclusion in the NRHP and not eligible for designation as a SAL.

SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS
In summary, approximately 106.4 ha (263 ac) was surveyed to assess for existing cultural
resources in the proposed Forney ISD New Middle School in Forney, Kaufman County, Texas.
The goal of the survey was to identify cultural resources and to make a preliminary evaluation of
the documented cultural resources as to their eligibility for inclusion in the NRHP and their
worthiness for being listed as a SAL.

30

The investigations conducted by Sphere 3 included an examination of previous archaeological
and other cultural resources investigations within one mile of the project area, an historical sketch
of each prehistoric, protohistoric, and historic period of Kaufman County and the northeast Texas
region, an analysis of aerial imagery and topographic maps over the past 101 years, a search of
documents of real property deeds of land areas within and adjacent to the project area, and an
intensive pedestrian archaeological survey supported by systematic shovel testing of the project
area. A total of 310 shovel tests were excavated. Shovel testing led to the discovery and
recordation of four archaeological sites.
Site 41KF189 is a medium- to high-density historic artifact scatter located along an improved
gravel road having existed since before 1919, forming the project area’s northeast boundary. A
large debris pile likely represents the demolished remnants of the dwelling and an agricultural
outbuilding. A circular feature with a vertical metal pipe was identified to have especially high
artifact density below the ground surface. Site 41KF190 is an abandoned residential dwelling
devoid of agricultural outbuildings surrounded by a low-density subsurface historic artifact
scatter located along the same gravel road approximately 259 meters (850 feet) southeast of Site
41KF189. The possible water well feature located in its southeast corner at one time may have
supplied water to the homestead. All other features were determined to be less than 50 years old.
Site 41KF191 is a medium- to high-density historic artifact scatter located along and slightly
beyond the project area’s southwest boundary. A small debris pile likely represents the
demolished remnants of the main dwelling atop the unusually flat nose ridge, from which on three
sides one can observe the Trinity River floodplain and in the distance the skyline of the City of
Dallas. An impenetrably thick motte and underbrush area along the project area’s southwest
boundary likely is the location of a smaller dwelling and/or one or more agricultural outbuildings.
Site 41KF192 is a low-density historic artifact scatter located in the western part of the project
area situated as close as 30 meters (98 feet) across a swale from the east margins of Site
41KF191. Two large debris piles appear to have resulted from abandonment of a tractor and
other agricultural equipment during the early to middle 20th century. This farming operation
likely was based at the farmstead represented by site 41KF191 or a mapped structure 25 meters
(82 feet) east of the site.
Site 41KF192 is recommended as ineligible for inclusion in the NHRP or for listing as a SAL.
Sites 41KF189, 41KF190, and 41KF191 may all extend beyond the limits of the project area.
The portion of Sites 41KF189, 41KF190, and 41KF191 within the project boundaries have been
evaluated as not eligible for inclusion in the NRHP or for listing as a SAL, and the uninvestigated
areas outside of the project area remain unevaluated.
With regard to the aboveground
architectural building of site 41KF190, the circular subsurface feature of site 41KF189, and the
unusually flat pad forming the central part of site 41KF191, it has been determined that
sufficiently large numbers of farmsteads and associated outbuildings and other structures remain
preserved intact and, in many cases have been listed in the NRHP and designated as SALs that
these cultural resources have insufficient research value to merit enactment of measures for their
preservation, in accordance with the Antiquities Code of Texas. Therefore, Sphere 3
recommends that the Forney ISD New Middle School project proceed without further cultural
resource investigations.
Sphere 3 requests the Texas Historical Commission, which serves as the State Historic
Preservation Office for Texas, to concur with the evaluation of non-eligibility and thus to concur
with the determination of no effect to historic properties listed on or eligible for inclusion in the
NRHP and those listed as or worthy of being included as a SAL.
