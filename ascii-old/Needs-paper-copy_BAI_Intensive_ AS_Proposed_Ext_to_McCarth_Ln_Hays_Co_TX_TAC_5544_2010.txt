On February 12, 2010 Blanton & Associates, Inc. (B&A), at the request of KBR, Inc. and on behalf of the
City of San Marcos, conducted an intensive archeological survey of existing and proposed McCarty Lane
right-of-way (ROW) for a proposed extension to the planned McCarty Lane Improvement Project. In
2009, B&A conducted an intensive archeological survey for the proposed McCarty Lane Improvement
Project (from 1,000 feet east of IH 35 to approximately 5,170 feet east of IH 35) under antiquities permit
No. 5320. A summary of findings report recommending no further studies was submitted by B&A to the
Texas Historical Commission (THC). The State Historic Preservation Officer (SHPO) provided clearance
on September 18, 2009. In early 2010 subsequent to B&S’s survey, the City of San Marcos extended the
planned improvement project approximately 1,364 feet by proposing additional improvements from
approximately 5,170 feet east of IH 35 to approximately 6,534 feet east of IH 35.
B&A’s 2010 survey of the 1,364 additional feet included surface and subsurface investigations and
resulted in the recording of historic archeological site 41HY472. The site encompasses parts of a midtwentieth century house, associated outbuildings, and water well. Shovel testing within the proposed
construction area discovered no subsurface artifacts. No artifacts were collected and curation was
unnecessary. The site continues an unknown distance south of the project area and could not therefore be
investigated. Based on alterations to the house, the dilapidated conditions of the associated outbuildings
(e.g., barn and garage), a previous historic resource investigation that assessed the house and
recommended that it was not eligible for inclusion to the National Register of Historic Places (NRHP), a
lack of subsurface artifacts, and the geologic and soil characteristics of the project area that are not
conducive to the preservation of intact buried archeological deposits, it is B&A’s opinion that the parts of
site 41HY472 in the planned construction are not worthy of formal State Archeological Landmark (SAL)
designation. As such, B&A recommends that the proposed construction should be allowed to proceed as
planned without additional investigations as no SALs would be impacted. However, as the parts of the
site south of the project area could not be investigated, it is currently unknown if the southern parts of the
site contain deposits worthy of formal SAL designation.

PROJECT TITLE: An Intensive Archeological Survey of a Proposed Extension to the McCarty Lane
Improvement Project from 5,170 Feet East of IH 35 to 6,534 Feet East of IH 35 in Hays County, Texas.
PROJECT DESCRIPTION: McCarty Lane is expected to become the southern section of Loop 110 (LP
110) around the eastern side of San Marcos that would bypass traffic around the city east of IH 35. On
February 12, 2010 Blanton & Associates, Inc. (B&A), at the request of KBR, Inc. and on behalf of the
City of San Marcos, conducted an intensive archeological survey of existing and proposed McCarty Lane
right-of-way (ROW) for a proposed extension to the planned McCarty Lane Improvement Project. In
2009, B&A conducted an intensive archeological survey for the proposed McCarty Lane Improvement
Project (from 1,000 feet east of IH 35 to approximately 5,170 feet east of IH 35) under antiquities permit
No. 5320. A summary of findings report for no further studies by B&A was submitted to the Texas
Historical Commission (THC). The State Historic Preservation Officer (SHPO) provided clearance on
September 18, 2009. In early 2010 subsequent to B&S’s survey, the City of San Marcos extended the
planned improvement project approximately 1,364 feet by proposing additional improvements from
approximately 5,170 feet east of IH 35 to approximately 6,534 feet east of IH 35.
The existing McCarty Lane right-of-way (ROW) is approximately 195 feet wide and contains a two-lane
undivided roadway. The proposed extension would reconfigure McCarty Lane to a four-lane roadway
with a raised median, curbs and gutters, a 12-foot wide sidewalk, and landscaping. Included in the
construction is a curve to the northeast connecting the previously proposed McCarty Lane improvements
to a separately proposed Hays County improvement project. The addition of the curve would eliminate
access for two privately-owned parcels; therefore, a cul-de-sac is proposed to provide access for the
landowners. In addition, a 25-foot wide utility easement along the southern edge of the ROW is
planned. The overall project area would be approximately 1,364 feet long and vary from 195 feet to 495
feet wide. The proposed construction would encompass 4.3 acres and extend a maximum of three to four
feet below the ground surface.
PROJECT LOCATION: The project area is in the City of San Marcos east of IH 35. The study area is
mapped on the San Marcos South, TX (2997-332) USGS 7.5-minute topographic quadrangle.
TOTAL ACREAGE: Approximately 4.3 acres
DATE OF WORK: February 12, 2010
PURPOSE OF WORK: B&A was assisting the project sponsor in their compliance with the Antiquities
Code of Texas

PREVIOUSLY RECORDED SITES: None
COMMENTS: Based on alterations to the house, the dilapidated conditions of the associated
outbuildings (e.g., barn and garage), a previous historic resource investigation that assessed the house and
recommended that it was not eligible for inclusion to the National Register of Historic Places (NRHP), a
lack of subsurface artifacts, and the geologic and soil characteristics of the project area that are not
conducive to the preservation of intact buried archeological deposits, it is B&A’s opinion that the parts of
site 41HY472 in the planned construction are not worthy of formal State Archeological Landmark (SAL)
designation. As such, B&A recommends that the proposed construction should be allowed to proceed as
planned without additional investigations as no SALs would be impacted. However, as the parts of the
site south of the project area could not be investigated, it is currently unknown if the southern parts of the
site contain deposits worthy of formal SAL designation.

I NT R ODUC T I ON
On February 12, 2010 Blanton & Associates, Inc. (B&A), at the request of KBR, Inc. and on behalf of the
City of San Marcos, conducted an intensive archeological survey of existing and proposed McCarty Lane
right-of-way (ROW) for a proposed extension to the planned McCarty Lane Improvement Project
(Figures 1 and 2). Prior to the recent survey, in July 2009 B&A conducted an intensive archeological
survey for the proposed McCarty Lane Improvement Project (from 1,000 feet east of IH 35 to
approximately 5,170 feet east of IH 35) under antiquities permit No. 5320. A summary of findings report
for no further studies by B&A was submitted to the Texas Historical Commission (THC). The State
Historic Preservation Officer (SHPO) provided clearance on September 18, 2009. In early 2010
subsequent to B&S’s survey, the City of San Marcos extended the planned improvement project
approximately 1,364 feet by proposing additional improvements from approximately 5,170 feet east of IH
35 to approximately 6,534 feet east of IH 35.
The existing McCarty Lane ROW is approximately 195 feet wide and contains a two-lane undivided
roadway. The proposed extension would reconfigure McCarty Lane to a four-lane roadway with a raised
median, curbs and gutters, a 12-foot wide sidewalk, and landscaping. Included in the construction is a
curve to the northeast connecting the previously proposed McCarty Lane improvements to a separately
proposed Hays County improvement project. The addition of the curve would eliminate access for two
privately-owned parcels; therefore, a cul-de-sac is proposed to provide access for the landowners. In
addition, a 25-foot wide utility easement along the southern edge of the ROW is planned.
The overall project area would be approximately 1,364 feet long and vary from 195 feet to 495 feet
wide. The proposed construction would encompass 4.3 acres and extend a maximum of three to four feet
below the ground surface. However, given the geologic and soil conditions, as well as previous
agricultural plowing in the proposed extension ROW north of the existing McCarty Lane, survey was not
necessary, as per the Texas Historical Commission (THC), because that area has little to no potential to
contain archeological resources worthy of formal State Archeological Landmark (SAL) designation.
Because the planned construction would occur on property owned by the City of San Marcos, the
proposed project is subject to the provisions of the Antiquities Code of Texas, now subsumed in Title 13,
Part II of the Texas Administrative Code. Protection of archeological sites under state law is tied to
eligibility for formal SAL status pursuant to 13 TAC 26.8. This legislation defines the necessary
conditions for recognition and preservation of SALs and requires that any state agency must identify
potential SALs through survey of public lands prior to actions that could potentially damage those SALs.
The THC’s Division of Archeology administers the code’s provisions. Archeological surveys must be
conducted under a Texas Antiquities Permit issued by the THC in accordance with the provisions of the
code. This project was conducted under Texas Antiquities Permit No. 5544 issued to Principal
Investigator Brandon S. Young.
The intent of the survey was to identify and describe all archeological resources discovered within the
project area, evaluate their potential eligibility for formal SAL designation and should significant cultural
resources be located, make recommendations for future cultural resource management options such as
avoidance, preservation, or further investigations.

The proposed construction area is Blackland Prairie—a rolling upland grassland covering approximately
11.5 million acres from Grayson and Red River Counties in northeast Texas to Bexar County in the
south−central region of the state (Figure 3). The area covers approximately 44,500 square kilometers.
Elevations range from 300 to 800 feet above mean sea level. Blackland Prairie soils are so named for the
ubiquitous, dark-colored calcareous clays throughout the area. Land use adjacent to the project area is
agricultural.

Figure 3. Project area conditions
G E OL OG Y
Geology of the project area consists of Upper Cretaceous Pecan Gap Chalk that is described as chalk to
chalky marl with some clay. There is no Holocene alluvium mapped in the project area (Barnes 1981).
SOI L S
Soils in the study area belong to the Heiden-Houston Black General Map Unit. This unit consists of
primarily upland soils that developed in situ from clayey sediments and shale. Individual soils within the
include Branyon clay, 1 to 3 percent slopes; Heiden clay, 3 to 5 percent slopes; Houston Black clay, 1 to 3
percent slopes; and Tinn clay, frequently flooded (Batte 1984).
Branyon series soils developed in place from clayey sediments found on ancient terraces and exhibits a
profile consisting of 100 centimeters plus of calcareous clay. Tinn clay, frequently flooded, is found on
floodplains, developed from clayey alluvium, and has a representative profile that exhibits 100
centimeters plus of dense calcareous clay. There is no Tinn clay, frequently flooded, within the proposed
construction area.

Heiden soils are on uplands, developed in situ from clay and shale, and exhibits a typical profile of 100
centimeters plus of dense clay. Soils of the Houston series are also found in the uplands and developed in
situ from clay and shale. Heiden and Houston Black soils occupy the majority of the proposed
construction area. Based on the above data, the geology and soil conditions throughout the majority of the
study area are not conducive to the preservation of intact buried archeological deposits.

The existing ROW supports typical maintained roadside grasses while the adjacent existing ROW
consists of pasture and previously plowed agricultural fields with scattered residences.

A review of data available on the THC’s online Texas Archeological Sites Atlas (TASA) was conducted
to determine the presence of any previously recorded sites and/or previous project areas in or adjacent to
the study area. The background review indicated that there are three previously recorded archeological
sites (41HY336, 41HY403 and 41HY409) and three previous project areas adjacent to the study area.

The Lower Colorado River Authority (LCRA) sponsored a cultural resources survey of an existing
transmission line prior to proposed re-construction. The northeast to southwest trending transmission line
crosses McCarty Lane approximately 700 feet east of Cottonwood Creek (TASA 2010).

Site 41HY336 was recorded during a 2002 survey for the City of San Marcos’ Cottonwood Creek
Wastewater Interceptor (Jones and Oksanen 2002). As mapped on TASA, the site is approximately 130
meters south-southwest of the McCarty Lane crossing of Cottonwood Creek and should not be impacted
by the proposed construction. The site consists of debris of an early 20th century homestead structure that
appears on a 1906 map. The debris consists of various structural components (e.g., sheet metal roofing
material, wooden support beams, and metal supports) that had apparently been burned. Approximately 10
concrete supports for wooden beams were noted in proximity to the structural debris. Cattle guards,
fences, and holding pens were noted immediately south of where the structure would have stood and
appear to have been constructed over some portions of the site. The soils in proximity and within the area
where the structure once stood are ashy in appearance and have moderate amounts of charcoal. The site
was not recommended as eligible for inclusion to the NRHP or for formal SAL designation (Jones and
Oksanen 2002).
PR OPOSE D L P 110 I NV E ST I G A T I ONS: 41H Y 403 A ND 41H Y 409
Site 41HY403 is a multi-component prehistoric and historic site consisting of a historic well and
associated domestic scatter (sparse), as well as four chipped-stone debitage specimens recorded during the
survey for the Texas Department of Transportation’s (TxDOT) proposed LP 110 corridor north of, and
adjacent to, McCarty Lane on the south bank of Cottonwood Creek (Rogers et al. 2006). Given a lack of
intact structural features, the lack of prehistoric materials, and the soil and geologic context, the site was
not recommended as eligible for inclusion to the NRHP or formal SAL designation.
Historic site 41HY409 consists of structural remains of a wooden house with a surface and subsurface (0
to 20 centimeters below ground surface) scatter of pieces of wood (some with wire nails), unidentified
wire fragments, tile, and miscellaneous glass and metal fragments. A small concrete driveway leads onto
McCarty Lane. Given a lack of intact structural features, few prehistoric materials, and soil and geologic
contexts, the site was not recommended as eligible for inclusion to the NRHP or formal SAL designation
(Rogers et al. 2006).

During cultural resource investigations for the proposed LP 110, PBS&J completed reconnaissance and
limited intensive surveys for historic architectural and engineering resources (PBS&J 2004). Their report
of investigations documents 52 resources at 39 separate locations. Pertinent to the currently proposed
survey area on McCarty Lane are Historic Site Location 136 (2200 McCarty Lane) and Historic Site
Location 137 (across the street from 1600 McCarty Lane). Site 136 consists of a circa 1900 domestic
dwelling of unknown style. Due to replacement windows, the resource was not recommended eligible for
inclusion to NRHP. Historic Site Location 137 was described as 1950 domestic dwelling that due to
renovations, which included a front and back porch, additional rooms, and eventually vinyl siding, the
resource was recommended not eligible for inclusion to NRHP. Although parts of McCarty Lane were
encompassed by the proposed LP 110 corridor alternatives and therefore subjected to a historic
reconnaissance, right-of-entry (ROE) to the properties containing Historic Sites 136 and 137 was not
granted for archeological investigations. Historic Site Location 137 (e.g., the house, outbuildings, and
fence lines) would be destroyed by the planned McCarty Lane extension project.

In July 2009, B&A conducted an intensive archeological survey of McCarty Lane from 1,000 feet east of
IH 35 to 5,170 feet east of IH 35. The survey was conducted on behalf of the City of San Marcos prior to
the proposed McCarty Lane Improvement Project. Investigations discovered no archeological resources
(Young 2009). The eastern terminus of the 2009 project area is also the western terminus of the proposed
2010 extension to the McCarty Lane Improvement Project.

B&A conducted an intensive 100 percent pedestrian archeological survey of the proposed construction
area with surface and subsurface investigations as necessary. Surface investigations consisted of an
inspection of the ground surface within existing and proposed ROW and utility easement, as well as areas
visible from the proposed ROW on adjacent private property.
Given a lack of alluvium, as well as previous disturbances within existing ROW from utilities and
roadway construction, as well as plowing in proposed ROW, backhoe trenching was unwarranted and
subsurface investigations were accomplished with shovel testing. Shovel tests were 30 to 40 centimeters
in width and excavated with a square-head shovel to a maximum depth of 40 centimeters below ground
surface or until soil conditions prohibited further excavation. Deeper shovel tests were deemed
unnecessary in the upland clay soils of the study area, which developed in situ and have therefore, little to
no potential to contain intact buried archeological deposits. All sediments removed from shovel tests were
screened through 0.25-inch wire mesh and shovel test data was recorded on B&A shovel test form and
plotted with hand-held GPS receivers.
The survey was designed to comply with appropriate archeological survey methods as defined in the
Department of the Interior's Standards and Guidelines (NPS 1983), the Guidelines of the Council of
Texas Archeologists (1987), and survey standards developed by the THC in conjunction with the Council
of Texas Archeologists (THC n.d.).

R E SUL T S OF I NV E ST I G A T I ONS
Intensive archeological survey investigations for the proposed extension to the McCarty Lane
Improvement Project revealed that the planned construction area has been impacted by historic and
modern land use. Impacts include plowing, livestock activities, construction of various farm structures,
land leveling for the construction of structures, and the previous construction of McCarty Lane
(Figure 4). Because of previous plowing and soil characteristics that are not conducive to containing
buried intact archeological deposits, the proposed construction north of the existing roadway was not
surveyed, as per discussions with the THC. The survey discovered no prehistoric resources but, given the
presence and age of the farm related materials within the proposed construction area, investigations
resulted in the recording of historic site 41HY472.
SI T E 41H Y 472
In the proposed construction area this site consists of the remains of a mid-twentieth century farmstead
that includes a vacant circa 1920 single story house with an associated concrete sidewalks, a barn, a
garage with an attached, covered work and storage area, and a water well (Figure 5). Property fencelines,
fenced pasture, and other fencelines associated with the farmstead extend in and outside of the proposed
project area (see Figure 4).
Surface and subsurface investigations across the part of the site in the planned construction area indicated
that the site has been impacted by the re-grading/leveling of areas for the construction of the various
structures, fencelines, buried water pipes, livestock, and plowing in some locations. The excavation of
Shovel Tests (STs) 1–9 only discovered artifacts (e.g., one piece of white china/porcelain; three clear
glass shards, and two pieces of plastic) in ST 4 that were randomly dispersed from 0 to 20 centimeters
below ground surface (Table 1 and see Figures 4 and 5). Shovel testing across the site revealed no
evidence of a continuous buried artifact scatter.

The single-story house on site has pier-and-beam foundation and is approximately 75 feet by 50 feet in
size (Figure 6). The structure is covered in vinyl siding, but cracks in the vinyl reveal that the original
wood clapboard siding remains beneath the modern siding. The roof has asphalt shingles and there is no
indication of a fireplace. Windows on the house are covered with wood frame screens or aluminum frame
screens. Inspections around the house discovered no trace of an associated privy or cistern. However, as
the site continues south beyond the proposed construction impacts there is a possibility for a cistern
and/or privy feature to be located in that direction away from the house itself.

The single-story barn measures approximately 60 feet by 90 feet and is of the open crib type. The
structure has a wood frame consisting of modern milled lumber frame with corrugated sheet metal walls
and roofs. Several cedar roof support posts were also utilized in the construction of the structure
(Figure 7).
The single-story garage and covered work/storage structure measures approximately 20 feet by 40 feet in
size. The garage portion of the structure has a concrete slab floor while the three-sided storage area has a
dirt floor. The garage has a wood frame with milled lumber, wire nails, and corrugated sheet metal roof
and walls. Electrical outlets and light fixtures indicate the structure was wired for electricity. The southern
quarter of the structure consists of an enclosed 10-fot by 20-foot work shop with two windows
(Figure 8).

The water well is approximately six feet in diameter and, above ground, consists of 13 brick courses with
constituent bricks being older pale limestone bricks and more recent red machined bricks (Figure 9). A
veneer of concrete applied to the above ground bricks is spalled and cracked, exposing the underlying
bricks. Although the limestone slabs that define the interior of the water well are relatively intact, it has
been altered by the addition of a pump and pipes to deliver water to the house (Figure 10). During site
recording, the well contained water so the depth of the well could not be determined.

Figure 9. Exterior of water well on 41HY472
Discussions with the former house and property owner indicated that she (Ms. Ellen Jaster) and her
husband purchased the property (and house) through the Federal Land Bank in 1948. They raised their
family there until moving in the mid- to late 1990s. According to Ms. Jaster, the house was altered over
the decades with the addition of a front sidewalk, several rooms, front and back porches, and the use of
vinyl siding (amongst other improvements). The house was assessed in 2004 during a historic resources
reconnaissance survey for the proposed LP 110 project (PBS&J 2004). The structure was identified by
PBS&J as Historic Site Location 137 and, based on construction modifications, was not recommended as
eligible for inclusion to the NRHP. In a 2007 letter, historians from the TxDOT and THC concurred and
no additional work was necessary (2007, letter on file at TxDOT Environmental Affairs and THC).
Based on the above data, it is the opinion of B&A that the part of site 41HY472 in the proposed
construction area is not worthy of formal SAL (13 TAC 26.12) designation. The house has been
extensively altered by remodeling and additions. The outbuildings are simple wood frame and corrugated
sheet metal structures that exhibit no unusual construction techniques that could not provide any new or

important information. The water well has been modified with modern pipes. Further, it is B&A’s opinion
that the geologic and soil conditions throughout the study area are not conducive for containing buried
intact archeological deposits and therefore, have little to no potential to contain previously unidentified
SALs. However, the site continues south of the project area an unknown distance and because
investigations south of the proposed construction area were not possible, it is unknown if that part of the
site 41HY472 contains deposits worthy of SAL designation.

Intensive archeological survey of the proposed extension to the planned McCarty Lane Improvement
Project resulted in the recording of historic site 41HY472. The remains of the homestead/farmstead
within the project area consist of a vacant, circa 1920s house with wood clapboard siding (beneath
modern vinyl siding) on pier-and-beam foundation with an associated front concrete sidewalk, barn,
garage with an attached covered work/storage area, and water well. Discussions with the former house
and property owner indicated that she and her husband purchased the property (and house) through the

The barn and garage structures on the parts of 41HY472 in the project area consist of modern milled
lumber frames with corrugated sheet metal walls and roofs. The garage structure also has a concrete slab
floor. Several cedar roof support posts were also utilized in the construction of the various structures. The
water well on site is lined with limestone slabs but above ground consists of 13 brick courses, with
constituent bricks being older limestone bricks mixed with more recent red machined bricks. A veneer of
concrete applied to the above ground bricks is spalled and cracked, exposing the underlying bricks.
Although the limestone slabs that define the interior of the water well are relatively intact, it has been
altered by the addition of a pump and pipes to deliver water to the house. Survey investigations
discovered no trace of an associated privy or cistern. The site continues an unknown distance south of the
proposed construction area, where several fenced enclosures, pasture, and other fence lines are present.
The surface and subsurface of the site in the study area has been impacted by the re-grading/leveling of
areas for the construction of the various structures, fence lines, pipe connecting the water well to the
house, livestock, and probable plowing in some areas. The excavation of STs 1–9 discovered minimal
artifacts (e.g., one piece of white china/porcelain; three clear glass shards, and two pieces of plastic) in ST
4 that were randomly dispersed from 0 to 20 centimeters below ground surface.
Based on the above data, it is the opinion of B&A that the part of site 41HY472 in the proposed
construction area is not worthy of formal SAL (13 TAC 26.12) designation. Because investigations
outside of the proposed construction area were not possible, it is unknown if the part of site 41HY472
south of the planned construction area contains deposits worthy of formal SAL designation. The house
has been extensively altered by remodeling and additions. The outbuildings are simple wood frame and
corrugated sheet metal structures that exhibit no unusual construction techniques that could not provide
any new or important information. The water well has been modified with modern pipes. Further, it is
B&A’s opinion that the geologic and soil conditions throughout the study area are not conducive for
containing buried intact archeological deposits and therefore, have little to no potential to contain

previously unidentified SALs. B&A recommends therefore that because no SALs would be impacted, the
proposed construction should be allowed to proceed as planned without additional investigations.
If it is determined that additional ROW or utility easement is required, then additional archeological
investigations may be necessary in those areas, particularly south of the proposed ROW where site
41HY472 continues. In the event that previously unidentified cultural materials are discovered during
construction, work in the immediate area of discovery would cease and the THC will be contacted to
initiate accidental discovery procedures.
