DEWEYVILLE BEDS, TERRACES, DEPOSITS, OR FORMATION
Saul Aronow
The Deweyville terraces were reported on by H.A. Bernard (1950)
in a now much-xeroxed and referred-to Ph.D. dissertation on the
Quaternary geology of southeast Texas between the Sabine and Neches
Rivers. These terraces, intermediate in elevation between the
Holocene floodplains of major streams and the super-adjacent
Beaumont (or Prairie) upland, were originally named by Bernard
(1950, p. 131) as the "Deweyville beds (7)" from their occurrence
near the town of Deweyville in Newton County along the Sabine river,
about 12 miles north of Orange, Texas.
One of the earliest, if not the earliest, references to them in
the published geologic literature, was in Kane's paper on Sabine
Lake (1959). Later the name "Deweyville Formation" was adopted by
the Texas Bureau of Economic Geology in the several sheets of the
Geologic Atlas of Texas (e.g., Barnes 1968a, 1968b), as well as by
the Louisiana Geological survey in the recent geologic map of
Louisiana (Snead and McCulloh, 1984) where the name "Deweyville
Terrace" is used. The Deweyville as a "formation" has never been
formally defined and seems to be used now as a kind of generic name
for terraces immediately below the level of the Beaumont (or
Prairie) upland. upstream beyond the area of outcrop of the
Beaumont as a coastal terrace, they may occur below the level of the
stream terrace correlatives of the Beaumont and the Prairie. The
terraces are still considered "Deweyville" even upstream from the
Beaumont and Prairie stream terrace correlatives where they are
recognized by the relict fluvial forms on their surfaces which have
channel widths, meander radii and arcuate point-bar complexes much
larger than those of the sub-adjacent Holocene streams in the modern
floodplains. In many places the Deweyville sediments are
considerably coarser than the sediments in the Holocene deposits.
Thus in southeastern Texas, the Deweyville deposits along the
Trinity River are major sources of gravel.
Terraces with these characteristics have been identified along
the sabine, Calcasieu (in Allen Parish), Red, Pearl and Ouachita
Rivers in Louisiana (see Snead and Mcculloh, 1984), the Arkansas and
Ouachita Rivers in Arkansas (Saucier, 1974), and in Texas along the
Sabine, Neches, Trinity, San Jacinto, Guadalupe, and Nueces.
Gagliano and Thorn (1967) note Deweyville terraces along the Brazos
River but cite no localities. The writer does not know of any
except perhaps some large Deweyville-sized meander scars cut into
Pleistocene uplands and Tertiary uplands (Epps, 1973) but no
terraces. Baker and Penteado-Orellana (1977) and Looney and Baker
(1977) suggest that some of the younger terraces along the Colorado
just south of Austin are contemporaneous with Deweyville of Saucier
and Fleetwood (1970) along the Ouachita River of Arkansas and
Louisiana. No Deweyville terraces on Colorado near the coast have
been reported.

1

In addition to these localities for the Deweyville, Gagliano
and Thom (1967) note generic Deweyville terraces along the Pearl and
Pascagoula Rivers in Mississippi, and along streams in the Pee Dee
River basin (Horry and Marion counties) in South Carolina.
The terraces disappear below sea level, for example, in the
lower reaches of the Sabine, Neches, Trinity, and San Jacinto Rivers
where the adjacent uplands have been scalloped by Deweyville-sized
meander scars. The lower reaches of the Calcasieu River, before it
enters Calcasieu Lake has large meanders, possibly Deweyvilledetermined, but no terraces.
The large fluvial forms and the coarser sediments of the
Deweyville probably indicate flow under higher discharge regimes
than present, resulting from higher runoff and, possibly,
ultimately, higher precipitation. Lower evaporation, the type of
materials in which the meanders form, and rates of sea level changes
have been suggested as contributing or major factors in the
formation of the larger meanders (see Baker, 1983; Saucier, 1977;
Goudie, 1983; Gagli~no and Thom, 1967; Alford and Holmes, 1985).
The apparent descent of the Deweyville surface beneath present
sea level suggests that the conditions leading to the large fluvial
features and coarse sediments began after the great post-l8,OOO-year
BP transgression, and possibly persisted into early Holocene time
prior to the attainment of present-day sea level. Bernard and
LeBlanc (1965, p. 149), give radiocarbon dates for the Deweyville as
ranging from more than 30,000 years BP to as young as 17,000 years
BP. The writer has some dates as young as 13,500 years BP. Even
younger are dates given by Alford and Holmes (1985)--less than
10,000 years BP. The oldest Deweyville ages begin to overlap the
youngest Beaumont ages. The writer suspects that some of these very
old Deweyville dates may actually he Beaumont-age organic remains on
the surface of the Beaumont substrate or reworked Beaumont fossil
materials.

STOP 10
DEWEYVILLE TERRACE--NIBLETT BLUFF PARK
AND
CORBELLO SAND PIT
Saul Aronow
This stop has two purposes: one, a brief look at one of the
lower Deweyville terrace levels, and two, a view of sand pit
developed in the Deweyville. The general context of the stop is
shown on figure 3, a portion of the Orange 1S-minute quadrangle. LA
Highway 109 which we took north from IH 10 traverses the fairly flat
Prairie surface. Upon turning west from the intersection of LA 109
and LA 3063 within a quarter of a mile we dropped down onto the
Deweyville terrace surface as we crossed Gum Slough which for
several miles flows at the base of the Deweyville/Prairie contact.
The road to the west to Niblett Bluff Park is uneven as we pass
through a point bar swell-and-swale topography of greater magnitude
thaIl the Holocene Sabine. The Bluff at the end of the road rises
less than 12 feet above the subadjacent Holocene alluvium to the
west. The bluff is bordered by the discontinuous Old River,a former
Holocene channel of the Sabine river. Within the Holocene swamps of
the Sabine River lowland are many ridges that rise less than 10 feet
above the marsh. These are abandoned Deweyville point-bar deposits.
About 2 miles to the southeast in the vicinity of Beef Ridge and
Pine Ridge (see figure 3) is a large, gullied Deweyyille meander
scar cut into the edge of the Prairie upland.
Across the river just
north of Orange is another large meander scar cut into the Texas
Beaumont upland and occupied by Holocene swamp deposits. East Cane
Island and west Cane Island in this feature are high remnants of
point bar deposits, similar to Beef Ridge and Pine Ridge in
Louisiana. The flooding of the base of these surfaces bounded by
meander scars is indicative of the gradual down-to-the-coast
inundation of the Deweyville by the post-18,OOO-year BP
transgression.
The sand exposed in the Corbello pit near the Park is unbedded
or massive suggesting possible eolian reworking of the surface as
well as disturbance by burrowing organisms and windthrows.
The area
of the pit in the new as yet unpublished Calcasieu parish SCS Soil
Survey was mapped as the Bienville-Cahaba-Guyton complex. Most of
the soils exposed in the pit area seem to belong to the well-drained
Cahaba Series with its predominently yellowish-red lower horizons.
A soil profile for the Cahaba Series is reproduced (courtesy of the
Soil conservatipn Service) in the following pages. The similar
Bienville is also given.

Cahaba series
The Cahaba series consists of well drained, moderately
permeable soils. They formed in loamy and sandy alluvium on stream
terraces. Slopes range from 1 to 3 percent.
Soils of the Cahaba series are fine-loamy, siliceous, thermic
Typic Hapludults.
Cahaba soils commonly are near Bienville and Guyton soils. The
somewhat excessively drained Bienville soils are on slightly higher
positions and are sandy throughout. The poorly drained Guyton soils
are on lower lying positions on flats and along drainageways.

STOP 11
DEWEYVILLE/BEAUMONT ROSE CITY SAND PIT
Saul Aronow
As we left IH 10 on the DeWitt Avenue exit and proceeded west
on the service road we descended a la-foot scarp:
we passed from
the higher Beaumont surface to the lower Deweyville terrace surface
(see figure 4).
In the pit are exposed medium to very coarse sands with a minor
gravelly component. Cross-bedding can be seen in some places. The
water in the pit is being pumped out and the base of the pit (and
the water level) is about 15 feet below sea level. The main feature

of intere6t in thi6 pit, other than the Deweyville 5and, i5 the
oyster reef exposed in some places in the bottom of the pit (see
figure 5). The reef in the exposure seen today is about 2.5 to J
feet thick and rests upon a dense plastic grey clay (CH in the
engineering classification) which is probably the Beaumont (see
figure 5).
In other exposures in the pit, now gone, the clay
enclosed the reef, and probably accumulated as the reef grew upward.
Oysters were reported in several Texas Highway Department boreholes
along the adjacent IH 10 as well as in an abandoned sand pit on the
south side of the Interstate.
Seven radiocarbon dates were obtained for the shell material
that was exposed ·in another part of the ree fin this pi t.
The only
"finite" date was 35,300 years BP. The remainder of the dates were
alt greater than 20,000 years BP, 22,500 years BP, 24,200 years BP,
36,000 years BP, 36,800 years BP, and 41,000 years BP.,
respectively.
Unclear at present is (a) whether the reef was in an estuarine
setting just prior to burial by Deweyville fluvial sediments or (b)
whether the reef was an episode in the accumUlation of a thicker
section of Beaumont whose upper part was scoured away by a
Deweyville-age paleo-Neches River.
The writer intends to pursue all
this in a later more "formal" publication.
This part of IH 10 is located on a southwestward prong or
salient of the Deweyville left as the terrace was nibbled away by
both younger Deweyville-age and Holocene scouring. The stream
deposits of the Deweyville-Age downcutting are buried for the most
part beneath Holocene sediments whose surface is graded to presentday sea level. To the southwest, Deweyville sediments are absent on
the other side of the river which is bounded by a 15-foot to la-foot
high bluff cut into the Beaumont. This extension of the Deweyville
prong into the Holocene of the Neches provides one of several local
but not numerous narrowings of the marshy Holocene deposits and
hence an exc~llent place for the location of stable bridge
.:\pproaches.

FISKIAN SURFACES IN SOUTHEAST TEXAS
Saul Aronow
H. A. Bernard's Ph.D. dissertation (1950) represents the first
major attempt to map Fisk's Louisiana Pleistocene surface in Texas.
Bernard's area is to the east of the field trip area, between the
Sabine and Neches rivers. A second large-scale attempt is recorded
on several Sheets of the Geologic Atlas of Texas (e.g. Barnes,
1968a, 1968b). Later (Barnes, 1982), the Sheets reverted to the
traditional three-fold Texas, youngest-coastal-plain-formation
sequence: Willis, Lissie, and Beaumont. The main purpose of this
part of the trip is to look at the several surfaces and review the
criteria for their recognition, and especially the boundaries that
separate them.
The writer (Aronow, 1971), p. 1244), reviewed some
of the criteria, specifically with reference to the BeaumontPrairie. Criteria include presence or absence of (a) relict
depositional patterns and of (b) diagnostic solIs, regional slopes,
and (d) the presence of bounding scarps or transitional zones in
which the regional slope changes.
(a) Fluvial-deltaic depositional patterns and accompanying
low-relief topography seem to be confined to the Beaumont-Prairie
and younger Pleistocene units (i.e., the Deweyville). ~ On the older
surfaces, the patterns have been lost through a complex of processes
about which we might speculate briefly.
Though the older surfaces
are considerably more dissected by streams than the Beaumont, but
the loss of the relict fluvial topography and soil patterns is not
necessarily related to stream erosion. Probably the major factors
in this "homogenization" of the surface include slow mass-wasting
effects, sheet flood erosion and deposition, wind erosion and
deposition during arid times of the Pleistocene, the small-scale but
cumulative effects of burrowing organisms, the displacement of soil
by tree root expansion, and surface disturbance by windthrows.
On the Beaumont-Prairie itself contemporaneous loss of fluvial
topography was probably mainly accomplished during the successive
lateral course changes of the meandering paleo-rivers. With a major
change of course ("avulsion"), now abandoned, inactive meander belts
were buried by flood basin deposits of a nearby active meander belt
in the form of parent materials of vertisols.
After pimple mounds the next most populous small-scale relief
features on the Pleistocene surfaces are undrained depressions.
On
the Beaumont-Prairie and Deweyville in most places they have some
systematic occurrence on or near areas of meander belt ridges and
abandoned channels. On the older units, this relationship has been
lost.
The undrained depressions, or the flatwood ponds of forested
areas are shallow, usually less than 5 feet in depth, circular to
elongate in ground plan, and usually less than 1,500 feet in longest
dimension; intermittently they may contain lakes; some will be
permanently marshy or wet, others may completely desiccate in the
summer rnonths.
Because of the absence of trees, they are most

8

conspicuous in forested areas. They are best developed on the
Montgomery and Bentley surfaces.
Theories of origin include their genesis as (1) segmented parts
of stream channels or point bar swales, (2) blow-outs or windexcavated deflated hollows, and (3) subsidence or collapse features
resulting from subsurface solution of soluble materials or the
subsurface erosion of material (piping).
Some of the depressions on the Beaumont and Deweyville surfaces
can be recognized as segmented parts of fluvial topography, thus
recording an early stage in the loss of depositional topography.
This view was proposed for the bagols or baygalls of Louisiana by
Fisk (1940) who thought they were the last unfilled remnants of the
deepest parts, or thalwegs of river channels or point bar swales as
they were filled by sediment-laden floodwaters. This may be true
for the flatter, higher surfaces--the last level surfaces of a oncecontinuous coast-wise terrace. In a few places, however, the
depressions are on the gentle slopes below the level of the highest
adjacent flat surface remnant. This means that the depressions
formed after the erosion and mass-wasting of the slopes. Windexcavation under more arid climates is plausible. Similar features
can be traced southward into the low rainfall regions of Texas where
they are clearly deflationary in origin.
(b) Among the diagnostic or characteristic soils are the
vertisols which seem curiously restricted to the Beaumont-Prairie
surfaces, among the Pleistocene units. They seem to be developed
mainly on flood-basin deposits, deposits in interdistributary
"lows," and more rarely, on relict mudflat and lagoonal parent
materials. Lateral movements of coarser surficial materials during
surface "homogenization" processes may lead to the formation of
vertic soils on the older units.
(c)
Some representative regional slope data is given in
Bernard and LeBlanc (1965, p. 145) for southeast Texas (Bernard's
area between the Sabine and Neches rivers) which can probably fit
most of the field trip area:

STOP 12
BEAUMONT/MONTGOMERY CONTACT NORTH OF BEAUMONT
Saul Aronow
As we leave the parking lot, we head north on U.S. Highways 69,
96 & 287.
We are mostly on the Beaumont surface until we cross Pine
Island Bayou (see figure 6) which is a convenient place to divide
the younger Beaumont from the older Montgomery. Pine Island Bayou
is flanked by low terraces and/or floodplain deposits. The first
high ground north of these has been mapped as Montgomery. This
surface has a slightly greater Gulfward slope (1 to 2 feet/mile for
the Beaumont vs. 2 to 5 feet/mile for the Montgomery). Except near
this southern edge, in this part of Texas, the Montgomery Is leached
of carbonates to depths penetrated by shallow road cuts and soil
profiles. The Montgomery surface has also lost any systematic or:
clearly defined relict depositional topography.
Pimple mounds are
numerous and random--no relationship to any depositional topography.
Undrnined depressions are present but sparse.

STOP 13
MONTGOMERY/BENTLEY CONTACT SOUTH OF KOUNTZE
Saul Aronow
The scarp marking the contact between the Montgomery and
Bentley is here rathet ptominent. This stop ("a" on figure 7) does
not correspond to the contact on the Beaumont Sheet of the Geologic
Atlas of Texas (Barnes, 1968a) which uses Cypress Creek about 2.5
miles to the northwest ("b" on figure 7) along this highway as the
contact, possibly because the hilly terrain north of the creek is
more characteristic of the Bentley surface.
But note the similarity
of elevations on the upper parts of this scarp with that of the
terrain just north of the creek--see especially the 75-foot contour.
This is clearly a judgment call in the absence of subsurface
stratigraphy (buried soils, continuity of linear sand bodies, and
radiocarbon or other radiometric dating).
The surface of the Bentley, regardless of the precise locations
of the contact is more dissected, the flatter areas with better
rounded slopes, and undrained depressions on the topographic flats
and slopes more numerous.

STOP 14
WILLIS ROAD CUT NORTH OF WARREN
Saul Aronow
We have now passed the Bentley/Willis scarp. The low, flat
area south of Warren is through the north-south floodplain of Black
Creek (see figure 8). The community of Warren is located on the
Willis.
The Hockley scarp, named after its prominent occurrence near
the town of Hockley in northwestern Harris County to the west is the
"traditional" name for the usually well-defined contact of the
younger Lissie (or Bentley) and the older Willis in Texas.
Unfortunately it is not outstanding along this highway.
In Harris
county, it is an active fault scarp which still does not precludeits utility as the topographic expression of a contact.
The road cut in the Willis is about 0.8 miles north of the
intersection of U.S. Highway 69 and the part of FM 1943 that
proceeds to the west. Though the Willis is usually thought of as
sandy and gravelly, this road cut is fairly typical of the uppermost
part of the Willis as seen in road cuts and soil profiles. A few
critical features of interest here are:
(a)

lack of bedding for most of the cut; towards the north end
of the cut a few iron-oxide-rich laminations appear at the
base of the cut. The lack of bedding might be attributed
to disturbance by burrowing organisms and wind-throws;
disruption of bedding, especially laminations, by
hydration effects in the formation of "limonite" either as
ironstone concretions, or in disseminated plinthitic iron
oxide-rich zones; eolian effects (hard to justify with
uppermost pebbly horizons); lateral mass movement down
even gentle slopes.

(b)

The high clay content of both pebbly and sandy portions of
the cut may be anomalous. The sandy and silty clays, or
the clayey sands and silts, are poorly sorted for fluvial
deposits that elsewhere boasts siliceous clasts several
inches in diameter. This could be a kind of overbank
deposit of a braided stream. The clays could also be the
weathering products of the breakdown feldspars and ferromagnesian minerals--another change that might partly
obliterate bedding and laminations. Bernard (1950) notes
the local usage of the term "soapstone" for clay clasts in
the Willis which can be up to a foot in diameter. They
also occur along with gravel and sand in cross-bedded
de~oslts.
Should these clay clasts be numerous and break
down, they could form the clayey sands and sandy clays.
The clasts are probably derived locally from Willis-age

12

overbank deposits and from clayey Tertiary deposits to the
north (e.g., Fleming and Catahoula).
(c)

The variegated pattern of oxidized and reduced sediments
may be a surface pattern developing upon the opening of a
road cut, or related to root penetration, both recent and
ancient.

(d)

The source of the iron oxides in these deposits is
puzzling. The sands are mostly quartzose, the gravels,
"petrified" wood, cherts vein quartz, and quartzites.
Was
the iron oxide derived from the breakdown of ferromagnesian minerals or is it a concentration of iron oxides
from a now vanished super-adjacent part of the Willis, now
eroded or mass-wasted away or both?

(e)

The local near-surface concentrations of ironstone
concretions are a source of road surfacing material known
locally as "iron ore gravel." According to local
operators of such shallow pits, after the "iron ore" is
scraped away, the surface is allowed to weather for a few
years and another surface layer is harvested.
The surface
exposure apparently converts the underlying plinthite to
concretionary form.
A special soil series, the Sunsweet
Series, has been described to identify these areas of
shallow surface excavations in which the upper parts of
the soil profiles have been removed. Their reclamation is
difficult in that the subsoils are highly acid and pine
trees, shrub vegetation, and grasses do not readily
encroach on these "Sunsweet" surfaces.

STOP 15
BENTLEY/WILLIS CONTACT WEST OF SPURGER
Saul Aronow
Since our stop at the Willis road cut we have been on the
Willis surface on a more or less east-west road.
Most of the
drainage is perpendicular to the road and flowing to the south, down
the surface of the southward sloping Willis in consequent (?)
fashion.
The surface is well dissected, though many flat, sloping
surfaces remain as uplands, held up in many places by iron oxidecemented sediments and plinthitic soils.
The local non-spectacular
version of the Hockley scarp is approximately at the junction of the
northbound FM 2992 and our east-west road, FM 1013. As can be seen
on figure 9, the topography to the south is less dissected than that
to the north and west.
At Spurger, we will head south on Texas
state Highway 92 to Silsbee.
The Bentley surface between Spurger
and Silsbee, as perceived from the highway is rather well-dissected
and resembles the Willis surface.
A glance at figure 9 shows that
the highway is along the eroded and gullied edge of the scarp
bounding the Neches River terraces and floodplain and that the
topography to the west of the highway is comparatively less
dissected.
A few low but locally abundant pimple mounds dot on the Bentley
surface.
They are less "well-developed" than mounds on the Beaumont
(or Prairie); many are elongate.
Some unanswered questions include:
are they contemporaneous with the mounds on younger surfaces? Did
each surface have a mound-formation phase? Was mound formation
renewed on the older surfaces as they developed on the younger?

STOP 16
MONTGOMERY/BENTLEY CONTACT NORTH OF SILSBEE
Saul Aronow
state Highway 92 between Spurger and the northern part of
Silsbee lies on the Bentley surface much of the relief of which is
due to gullied drainage over the edge of the Neches River lowland to
the east.
The contact to be seen here is rather definite on the ground
but seems to be elusive on the topographic map (figure 10). The
contact here 15 best described as "shredded" and covers a zone of
over a half mile to two miles--not quite as decisive as that of
stop 13.
This is the last stop--State Highway 92 joins U.S. Highway 96
which leads into the combined U.S. Highways 69 and 287--and on to
IH 10.

INGLESIDE STRANDPLAIN-BARRIER IN TEXAS--SOME BRIEF OBITER DICTA
Saul Aronow
The Ingleside was first named and identified by Price (1933)
who named the feature after the community of Ingleside in Aransas
County in south rexas. Figures 11 and 12 of the northern and
southern parts of the Texas coastline show all or most of the
various segments that have been placed in this unit.
In south Texas
and northward to the vicinity of San Luis Pass and west Bay (of
Galveston Bay) the seaward edges are about at sea level and has much
the same relationship to sea level as the present-day barrier
islands. Beginning with the segment on the south side of Galveston
Bay (near Texas City) the feature rises until the segment in
Louisiana (Houston Burrier) is about 30 to 35 feet ubove sea level.
These northernmost parts, at least in Texas, are embedded in and
surrounded by the Beaumont Formation, which in detail show fluvial
depositional patterns "engulfing" surrounding the segments. Seaward
the edge of the Beaumont from East Bay (of Galveston Bay) displays a
digitate deltaic pattern of several small deltas that are continuous
with meander belts on the Beaumont surface (see Aronow, 1971, 1983).
In this region the Ingleside seems just a little older than this
last stack of Beaumont-age fluvial deposits. The contrast of the
two relationships to the coast: extra-Beaumont and intra-Beaumont
suggest either tilting and uplift of the northern part or
downwarping of the southern part on the assumption that the several
segments were contemporaneous.
As can be seen from the list of critical features in the lower
left corner of figure 12 (items 2, 5, and 7) surface of the
Ingleside gradually loses its "mature soils" and beach-ridge
patterns to the south, probably under eolian influences. Oddly
enough the Ingleside also loses its beach-ridge pattern in
Louisiana. Perhaps, disturbance by windthrows or burrowing
organisms is responsible for this.
