ABSTRACT
On November 29, 2006 archeologists from Blanton & Associates, Inc. (Blanton & Associates) conducted
an intensive archeological survey on CR 640 at Mulberry Creek in Taylor County, Texas prior to
proposed bridge replacement and roadway improvement construction (CSJ: 0908-33-072). The survey
was performed at the request of Chica & Associates, Inc., on behalf of the Texas Department of
Transportation’s (TxDOT) Abilene District. Field investigations found no cultural materials and curation
was unnecessary.

MANAGEMENT SUMMARY
PROJECT TITLE: Archeological Investigations on CR 640 at Mulberry Creek in Taylor County,
Texas.
PROJECT DESCRIPTION: The project involved an archeological records review and an intensive
archeological survey with shovel testing prior to proposed roadway and bridge improvements on CR 640
at Mulberry Creek (CSJ: 0908-33-072). Surface and subsurface investigations discovered no cultural
resources within the project area.
The proposed construction would occur only within the existing CR 640 right-of-way (ROW), which is
approximately 40 to 50 feet wide. The existing roadway is unpaved, 16 to 20 feet wide, and consists of a
one-lane, two-way road with no shoulders. The existing 1945 two simple span steel stringer bridge is 60
feet long and 20 feet wide. Available construction schematics indicate that the proposed bridge would be
an 80-foot long and 26-foot wide pre-stressed concrete I-beam structure with two 12-foot wide lanes. The
123-foot long approach roadway would also be widened and repaved to match the width of the new
structure. Vertical impacts would extend approximately 20 feet below the existing ground surface.
According to construction plans, no new ROW or temporary or permanent easements would be necessary
for the project. The overall Area of Potential Effect (APE) for archeology consists only of the locations of
planned construction impacts. For this project then, the APE is approximately 326 feet long, 50 feet or
less wide, and extends about 20 feet below the ground surface.
PROJECT LOCATION: The project area is located in northwest Taylor County approximately three
miles southeast of Merkel, Texas
TOTAL ACREAGE: Approximately 0.37 acres
DATE OF WORK: November 29, 2006.
PURPOSE OF WORK: Blanton & Associates, Inc. is assisting the project sponsor in their compliance
with Section 106 of the National Historic Preservation Act of 1966 (and subsequent amendments) and the
Antiquities Code of Texas.
PRINCIPAL INVESTIGATOR: Brandon S. Young
TEXAS ANTIQUITIES PERMIT NUMBER: 4319
NEWLY RECORDED SITES: None.
PREVIOUSLY RECORDED SITES: None.
COMMENTS: Based on the lack of archeological deposits within the project area, Blanton &
Associates, Inc. recommends that the proposed construction be allowed to proceed as planned within the
existing CR 640 ROW without additional cultural resource investigations. As the proposed project area
has been extensively modified by roadway construction and maintenance, as well as buried utilities, it is
unlikely that intact buried cultural resources would be discovered during construction. If the planned
construction should require additional work space outside of the existing ROW, then additional cultural
resource investigations in those areas would be necessary.

INTRODUCTION
On November 29, 2006, archeologists from Blanton & Associates, Inc. (Blanton & Associates), at the
request of Chica & Associates, Inc., and on behalf of the Texas Department of Transportation’s (TxDOT)
Abilene District, conducted an intensive archeological survey on CR 640 at Mulberry Creek, Taylor
County, Texas prior to proposed bridge replacement and roadway improvement construction (CSJ: 090833-072). The project area is located approximately three miles southeast of the community of Merkel in
northwest Taylor County (Figures 1.1 and 1.2).
The proposed highway improvements would involve replacing the existing concrete bridge with a wider
and longer pre-stressed concrete span capable of handling current and future traffic load. In addition to
the bridge replacement, roadway improvements on CR 640 would involve the widening of the 123-foot
long approach roadways on the north and south ends of the bridge to match the width of the new
structure. The proposed bridge construction would occur only within the existing CR 640 right-of-way
(ROW). No new ROW or temporary or permanent easements are planned for the construction.
The existing CR 640 ROW is 40 to 50 feet wide with an existing roadway approximately 34 feet wide.
The existing roadway is unpaved, 16 to 20 feet wide, and consists of a one-lane, two-way road with no
shoulders (Figure 2). The existing 1945 two simple span steel stringer bridge is 60 feet long and 20 feet
wide. Available construction schematics indicate that the proposed bridge would be an 80-foot long and
26-foot wide pre-stressed concrete I-beam structure with two 12-foot wide lanes (Figure 3). The 123-foot
long approach roadway would also be widened and repaved to match the width of the new structure.
Vertical impacts would extend approximately 20 feet below the existing ground surface. According to
construction plans, no new ROW or temporary or permanent easements would be necessary for the
project. The overall Area of Potential Effect (APE) for archeology consists only of the locations of
planned construction impacts. For this project then, the APE would be approximately 326 feet long, 50
feet wide, extend about 20 feet below the ground surface, and encompasses 0.37 acre.
As the planned construction would occur on property owned by the State of Texas and administered by
TxDOT, the project is subject to the provisions of the Antiquities Code of Texas, now subsumed in Title
13, Part II of the Texas Administrative Code. This legislation defines the necessary conditions for
recognition and preservation of State Archeological Landmarks (SALs) and requires that any political
subdivision of the State of Texas, defined as a “local governmental entity created and operating under the
laws of this state, including a city, county, school district, or special district created under the Texas
Constitution, Article III, §52(b)(1) or (2), or Article XVI, §59” in 13 TAC §26.5 of the code, must
identify potential SALs through survey of public lands prior to actions that could potentially damage
those SALs.
It is assumed that funding for the proposed highway construction will come in part from the Federal
Highway Administration (FHWA) and, as such, the proposed project is also subject to the provisions of
Section 106 of the National Historic Preservation Act of 1966 (NHPA). The intent of the NHPA is to
protect significant cultural resources that might be threatened by actions that are federally funded or

permitted, or which occur on federal property. The act, which created the National Register of Historic
Places (NRHP) and the Advisory Council for Historic Preservation (ACHP), states that the ACHP must
be afforded the chance to comment when any cultural resources eligible for inclusion on the NRHP are
present in an area affected by federal agency actions or actions funded or permitted by federal agencies.
The federal regulatory process is described in detail in the ACHP regulations (36 CFR 800) and in the
regulations of the agencies and federal divisions engaged in historic preservation. Protection of cultural
resources under federal law is tied to eligibility for the NRHP that depends on site significance as defined
by National Park Service (NPS) rules 36 CFR 60. Although the ACHP is the final arbiter of the Section
106 process, in practice, the process is typically limited to review and concurrence by the involved agency
and the State Historic Preservation Officer (SHPO), represented in Texas by the THC.
Investigations were conducted in accordance with the First Amended Programmatic Agreement (PA)
among the FHWA, the THC, the ACHP, and TxDOT, as well as the Memorandum of Understanding
(MOU) among TxDOT and THC. The survey was designed to comply with appropriate archeological
survey methods as defined in the Department of the Interior's Standards and Guidelines (NPS 1983), the
Guidelines of the Council of Texas Archeologists (1987), and the survey standards developed by the THC
in conjunction with the Council of Texas Archeologists (THC n.d.). The primary intent of the survey was
to identify and describe all cultural resources discovered within the APE, evaluate their potential
eligibility for nomination to the NRHP or for formal SAL designation, and should significant cultural
resources be located, make recommendations for future cultural resource management options such as
avoidance, preservation, or further investigations.

DEFINITION OF STUDY AREA
The proposed project area is located in the Rolling Plains ecological region of Texas, which is
characterized by a gently undulating to rolling plain. Elevations across the Rolling Plains range from
approximately 1,000 feet in the eastern margins of the region to 2,200 feet at the base of the Cap Rock
Escarpment on the region’s western edges (Jordan et al. 1984). Climatic conditions in Taylor County are
semi-arid with long, hot summers and mild winters. Rainfall is heaviest in the spring and fall, with
roughly 23 inches of annual rainfall. Surrounding the project area, land use consists of pasture and ranch
land.
GEOLOGY
The CR 640 study area is underlain by Quaternary (Holocene) Alluvium consisting of gravel, sand, silt,
and silty clay floodplain and low terrace deposits (Barnes 1972). In terms of the potential for
archeological preservation, Quaternary alluvium found along local and regional drainages has consistently
been shown to contain buried cultural deposits.
SOILS
Soils in the project area consist of Colorado soils, frequently flooded, which are deep, nearly level loamy
soils formed on benches above creek channels in calcareous loamy alluvial sediment. Clairemont silty
clay loam is mapped west of the project area and is described as a deep, nearly level loamy soil on
bottomlands astride creek channels formed in calcareous alluvium. Just east of, and adjacent to, the APE
is an area of Owens-Badland complex, 3 to 12 percent slopes. The Owens series consists of clayey,
sloping upland soils that formed in clayey shale, while Badland consists of exposed redbed shaly clay on
or below escarpments. The Owens-Badland complex, 3 to 12 percent slopes, is found on steep knolls,
escarpments, and ridges (Conner 1976).
VEGETATION
Taylor County lies in the Kansan biotic province (Blair 1950). The majority of vegetation within the
project was composed of grasses, including rescuegrass (Bromus sp.), johnsongrass (Sorghum halepense),
and windmillgrass (Chloris verticillata). Sagebrush (Artemisia sp.) also present. Honey mesquite
(Prosopis glandulosa) was the dominant tree species, and other woody plants included lotebush (Zizyphus
obtusifolia) and buttonbush (Cephalanthus occidentalis). Other vegetation included yucca (Yucca sp.) and
various cacti.

PREVIOUS INVESTIGATIONS
A review of records available at the Texas Archeological Research Laboratory (TARL) and on the THC’s
online Texas Archeological Sites Atlas (TASA) was conducted to determine the presence of any
previously recorded sites or previous project areas within 1,000 meters of the project area. The online
review indicated that there is one previously recorded site on Mulberry Creek approximately 1,100 meters
north-northwest (upstream) of the project area. Unfortunately, there is no site number and minimal data
concerning the site on TASA or in the site file at TARL. This site is one of many recorded in Texas in the
1920s by E. B. Sayles (1935) during his statewide archeological survey. The site form does indicate
however, that the site’s provenience was extrapolated in 1982 and 1985 by TARL from Sayles’ original
field notes.
A second previously recorded site, 41TA77, is located on Mulberry Creek roughly 1,500 meters northnortheast and upstream of the study area. E.B. Sayles recorded 41TA77 in 1929 and described it as
containing a number of large hearths and burned rock. The site form provides no discussion of artifacts,
subsurface components or site size. It is very likely that the site is incorrectly plotted on TARL’s maps
and on TASA, as the brief site form indicates that the site’s location on TARL’s maps was extrapolated in
1982 and 1985 from Sayles’ field notes and not from an original map plotting.

METHODS
The intensive archeological survey on CR 640 at Mulberry Creek involved surface and subsurface
investigations of sufficient intensity to determine the nature, extent, and if possible, the significance of
any discovered cultural resources. Investigations adhered to THC survey standards (n.d.), as well as the
guidelines of the Council of Texas Archeologists (1987), and the Secretary of the Interior’s Standards and
Guidelines (NPS 1983). Moreover, the survey was designed and executed in accordance with the PA
among the FHWA, the THC, the ACHP, and TxDOT, as well as the MOU between TxDOT and the THC.
Surface investigations consisted of a 100 percent pedestrian survey of the project area by two
archeologists systematically examining the ground surface for cultural remains. Where possible, cutbank
profiles were inspected for the presence of any buried cultural materials. Blanton & Associates had
arranged backhoe trenching to prospect for buried cultural deposits because of the presence of recent
alluvium along Mulberry Creek. However, due to an extremely narrow and steep ROW, backhoe
trenching was not conducted, as the backhoe operator was concerned that: 1) because of the narrow
ROW, the backhoe and backfill would have been forced to occupy the road during excavations,
(2 excavations would have undercut and impacted the existing fill section and road base, and (3 buried
utilities occupied the center of the narrow south side of the ROW. Subsurface investigations were
therefore limited to shovel testing.
Shovel tests were 30 to 40 centimeters in width and excavated with a square-head shovel. All sediments
removed from shovel tests were screened through ¼-inch wire mesh. All appropriate shovel test data was
recorded on Blanton & Associates shovel test forms and plotted with hand-held global positioning system
(GPS) receivers. Field investigations were thoroughly documented with digital cameras. No cultural
materials were collected so curation was unnecessary.

RESULTS OF INVESTIGATIONS
Archeological investigations at Mulberry Creek indicated that the existing CR 640 ROW is extremely
narrow and has been disturbed by erosion, buried and overhead utilities, as well as roadway construction
and maintenance activities (Figures 4 and 5). North of the roadway, the distance between the ROW
boundary fence and the edge of the pavement is only six to 10 feet, while south of the road the width is
three to 10 feet (Figures 6 and 7). Paralleling the south side of the roadway is a buried
telecommunications cable with an overhead span that crosses the creek. Additionally, the south side of the
ROW between the edge of the pavement and the fence line is a steeply sloped ditch. Ground surface
visibility throughout the APE was approximately 40 to 50 percent.
Surface and subsurface investigations within the APE revealed no prehistoric or historic cultural
resources, only modern roadside debris and trash. Subsurface investigations consisted of preparing and
describing a stepped cutbank profile on the east bank of Mulberry Creek near the northeast corner of the
bridge and the excavation of three shovel tests (see Figure 4). Because of the narrow ROW and the
presence of a buried utility cable south of the roadway, shovel testing was limited to the north side of the
road.
Shovel Tests 1–3 revealed very dry, hard, and compacted clayey construction fill with crushed limestone
rock overlying dry and hard clay strata truncated by roadway construction. Shovel Tests (ST) 1 and 2
were excavated in the northwest quadrant of the creek crossing and exhibited extremely compacted
reddish construction fill to a maximum depth of 33 centimeters below ground surface overlying extremely
firm silty clay strata. In ST 1 the upper zone of construction fill extends to 23 centimeters and overlies
brown silty clay truncated by highway construction from 23 to 44 centimeters below ground surface. The
third strata observed in ST 1 consisted of reddish-brown silty clay between 44 and 100 centimeters. In
ST 2 the brown silty clay strata was absent and the fill zone overlies reddish-brown silty clay truncated by
highway construction extending from 33 to 100 centimeters.
Shovel Test 3 was located in the northeast quadrant of the project area and revealed three distinct strata
between 0 and 100 centimeters below ground surface. As with STs 1 and 2, ST 3 contained an extremely
firm and compact zone of construction fill from 0 to 27 centimeters overlying partially intact to intact clay
soils. Between 27 and 57 centimeters was extremely hard and dry reddish-brown silty clay loam overlying
extremely hard and firm reddish-brown silty clay from 57 to 100 centimeters below ground surface.
The stepped cutbank profile revealed intact alluvium as opposed to the construction fill encountered in the
shovel tests excavated away from the bank of the creek (see Figure 4). Two broad soil zones were
identified in the profile. Zone I (0 to 68 centimeters below ground surface) consisted of dry and hard
reddish-yellow (5YR 6/8) silty clay loam with a granular structure, occasional rootlets, and a gradual
wavy lower boundary (Figure 8). Zone II (68 to 160 centimeters below ground surface) consisted of dry,
very hard reddish-brown (5YR 4/4) sandy clay loam with a blocky subangular structure. The lower
boundary was not observed as the profile terminated at the creek bed.

Based on the results of field investigations, no cultural resources would be impacted within the CR 640 at
Mulberry Creek APE by the proposed bridge replacement and roadway improvement construction. Given
the narrow and disturbed conditions throughout the APE resulting from buried utilities, erosion, and
highway cut and fill construction, it is unlikely that any intact cultural resources would be impacted
within the APE by the planned roadway improvements.

SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS
Intensive survey efforts found no cultural resources within the existing CR 640 ROW at Mulberry Creek.
Shovel testing revealed only construction fill and soils disturbed by buried utilities, erosion, and highway
cut and fill construction. Blanton & Associates recommends therefore, that as no prehistoric or historic
cultural resources will be impacted by the proposed construction, the project should be allowed to proceed
as planned without additional cultural resource investigations.
If it is determined that TxDOT requires additional workspace or ROW for the proposed construction or
for future construction projects, then additional cultural resource investigations are recommended for
those areas. In the event that previously unidentified cultural materials are discovered during construction,
work in the immediate area would cease and the TxDOT archeological staff would be contacted to initiate
accidental discovery procedures in accordance with the aforementioned PA and MOU.
