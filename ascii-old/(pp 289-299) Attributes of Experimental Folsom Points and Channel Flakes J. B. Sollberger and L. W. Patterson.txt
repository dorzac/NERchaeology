Attributes of Experimental Folsom
Points and Channel Flakes

ABSTRACT
Physical attributes of large samples of experimental Folsom points and channel flakes are
presented and discussed in regard to related manufacturing technology. Comparison with archeological specimens is limited by data availability. The use of lever devices for pressure flaking to produce channel flakes is described.

INTRODUCTION
The Folsom fluted projectile point was one of the first point types identiffed as Paleoindian (Wormington, 1957:23-41). It is of wide interest both
because of its antiquity and fine workmanship. Folsom points are described
in several works (Bell, 1958:26; Judge, 1973:165; Suhm and Jelks,
1962:193; Wilmsen, 1974:Table 5.9; Wilmsen and Roberts, 1978:Table
43). Articles on Folsom point replication also are available (Crabtree, 1966;
Flenniken, 1978; Sollberger, 1977).
Not much quantitative data are available on the attributes from large
samples of Folsom points in order to establish what is typical and what variations can be expected. For example, regional variations may exist in average
dimensions. Variations might be caused by raw material types, work of individual craftsmen, or by localized cultural preferences.
Data are presented on physical attributes of large samples of experimental
Folsom points and channel flakes made by the senior author. These data
could be useful for the following reasons: 1) provides quantitative data to
supplement limited data available from archeological sites; 2) gives the basis
for comparison of an experienced replicator’s product with archeological
materials; 3) a large statistical sample is presented not previously available in
the literature; 4) may be useful to others in future replication work; and 5)
experimental data may be useful in determining aboriginal manufacturing
methods.

Channel flakes are specialized flakes produced to form the long
longitudinal flake scars that are the flutes on Folsom points. Except for
Lindenmeier (Wilmsen and Roberts, 1978) and Hanson (Frison and
Bradley, 1980), little site information is available on the physical attributes of
channel flakes removed from Folson point preforms. Several reports
(Hester, 1972:134; Judge, 1973: Fig. 14; Tunnell, 1977:152) illustrate only fragments of folsom channel flakes although sample sizes are fairly large.
At Lindenmeier (Wilmsen and Roberts, 1978:101), there are 948 channel
flake specimens and only one is unbroken.
The senior author experiences breakage of most channel flakes during
replication of Folsom points. This breakage occurs because these thin flakes
bend away from the preform while still under load during the fracture time
interval. Breakage of these fragile flakes also could occur rather easily from
fortuitous causes. A large collection of experimental Folsom channel flakes
resulted from this replication work. Most complete specimens of these channel flakes were reconstructed by gluing fragments together. A summary of
the attributes of this collection is presented; Lindenmeier (Wilsen and
Roberts, 1978) and Hanson (Frison and Bradley, 1980) data are summarized for comparison.
MEASUREMENT METHODS
Attributes of Folsom points and channel flakes (Fig. 1) were made using
the same methods as for the measurement of prismatic blades (Sollberger
and Patterson, 1976:518). A dial caliper with an accuracy of 0.1 mm was
used to obtain linear dimensions. A 10 power magnifier was used to examine qualitative attributes.
An optical comparator was used to measure striking platform and proximal end angles of channel flakes. This instrument is a 7 power magnifier
with a protractor reticle. The striking platform angle is the angle of the striking platform surface to the main preform face. The bevel at the striking platform edge formed during platform preparation was ignored. This short bevel
does not represent the overall geometry involved in flake removal
mechanics. The proximal end angle is the total angle included between
lateral edges as these edges flare out from the striking platform. This attribute is a distinctive feature of channel flakes. This angle is generally clearly
defined, with little curvature of the lateral edges at this location. After full
width is reached, lateral edges become parallel or taper gradually toward the
distal end.

KNAPPING TECHNIQUES
Force application techniques to produce long, relatively narrow Folson
channel flakes are varied. Crabtree (1966) replicated Folsom points by both
pressure and indirect percussion and more recently by direct percussion
(Crabtree, 1979:10). Flenniken (1978) used indirect percussion and
Sollberger (1977) used level pressure from two types of mechanical devices.
These experimental knappers agree that the preform must be securely held
during channel flake removal. Striking platforms for channel flakes must be
well isolated by pressure flaking and well smoothed by grinding. The

Sollberger and Patterson - Experimental Points and Hakes

preform must be uniformly thinned for successful channel flakes to be produced. Dorsal ridges are not present to act as force guides as on prepared
cores used to make long, narrow prismatic blades.
For the Folsom replicates described, two level pressure methods were used. In both methods, the striking platform angle employed averages about
80°. Approximately 90% of the replicates were fluted with a device specially made for this purpose. The preform is held in a vertical position by a
wood clamp that presses against both lateral edges, with the distal end of the
preform resting on a wood anvil. The hooked end of a level arm is placed on
the striking platform that has been prepared for channel flake removal, and
uniform pressure is applied to remove the flake (Fig. 2).
The other level pressure method used involves use of a two pronged fork
(Fig. 3). The fork notch serves as a fulcrum point for a separate pointed
pressure flaking tool that is used as a level to apply force. Use of a fork for
pressure flaking was previously described (Sollberger and Patterson,
1976:524; Sollberger, 1978).
Regardless of which force application technique is used, the process of
fluting Folsom points requires exacting knapping procedures. Folsom fluted
points are more difficult to manufacture than Clovis fluted points since
Folsom points are much thinner and subject to breakage. Folsom flutes
generally are relatively much longer in proportion to point length than
Clovis flutes.
The exact techniques used by aboriginal knappers to flute Folsom points
is still subject to speculation. However, a tool made from the first brow tine
of an elk antler from the Agate Basin site (Frison, 1980) suggests that a lever

device was used at least sometimes. A distinctive notch in the tip may indicate that this was the pressure contact point with the Folsom preform for
the fluting operation. Frison (1980) proposed that the base of this antler tine
would have been fastened to some type of level pole.

FOLSOM POINT ATTRIBUTES
Data presented on attributes of Folsom point replicates (Fig. 4) are based
on 36 points (Table 1). Data on individual points are given in Tables 2 and
3. Table 2 shows replicates where flutes on both faces extend the entire
length of the point. Table 3 shows replicates where a flute on only one face
extends the entire length of the point, with the flute on the other face terminating short of the distal end.
The minimum thickness of a completed Folsom point is related to the
preform thickness after removal of the first flute. This relationship is because
the second flute flake cannot be generally thicker than the thickness between
the two channel flake scars without causing breakage. Replicates for this
study have thicknesses of 2.6 to 4.7 mm (Table 1). This range can be compared with Lindenmeier Folsom point thicknesses of 3.3 to 4.3 mm
(Wilmsen and Roberts, 1978:Table 43) and some New Mexico Folsom
point thicknesses of 3.4 to 4.3 mm (Judge, 1973:165, 213). Three Folsom
points from Hanson (Frison and Bradley, 1980:Table 4) have thicknesses of
4.10, 3.85, and 3.80 mm.
Because of the small published archeological data base, modern
replicators do not know if they are really replicating typical Folsom points. A
few skillful flintknappers can do well, however, in replicating the few Folsom
specimens generally available for study. One of the main values in Folsom
point replication has been to demonstrate the amount of skill needed to produce this point type. Making flutes on Folsom points is a highly specialized
process.
A better summary of archeological data on dimensions of large numbers
of Folsom points is needed in order to judge what is typical and what may
represent regional variations. There can be considerable variation in Folsom
point dimensions. Suhm and Jelks (1962:193) give a range of 3 to 8 cm for
lengths of Texas Folsom points. Hester (1972:124) gives a length range of
2.5 to 5.0 cm for Folsom points from Blackwater Draw Locality No. I in
New Mexico. Roberts (1943:Fig. I) illustrates a Folsom point with a length
of 11.9 cm and two others of 4.5 cm length. Wilmsen and Roberts
(1978:Table 43) show lengths of 2.9 to 3.6 cm for 31 specimens, but a
number of these may have been shortened by resharpening.
In describing Folsom point replicates, Flenniken (1978:474) selected five
specimens from 100 made as a random sample for tabulation of quantitative
attributes. This set, however, is not a statistically significant sample. Large
samples should be used, when available, to minimize errors that can result
from small samples (Arkin and Colton, 1970:160).
Since the Folsom point replicates summarized in Tables 2 and 3 were
made over a long time period, data are not available on corresponding
preform dimensions. The majority of these replicates are made of chert from
Georgetown, Lake Belton, and other miscellaneous Edwards Plateau
sources.

CHANNEL FLAKE ATTRIBUTES
The attributes of 66 complete experimental Folsom channel flakes (Fig. 5)
are summarized in Table 4. Data are not available to match individual channel flakes with finished point specimens. Many of the attributes are predictable from the technology involved. For example, the dorsal faces of flakes
are covered with fine, roughly parallel flake scars formed during uniform
thinning of the preform. Channel flakes have striking platform isolation flake
scars starting at the platform edge on the dorsal face. Striking platforms
show evidence of grinding. These channel flakes are characteristically long
and narrow with parallel or gradually tapering lateral edges. Striking platforms are small, relative to flake width. In the replicate collection, the ratio of
average flake width to average striking platform width is 4:1.
Striking platforms tend to be nearly perpendicular to the dorsal faces, with
an average striking platform angle of 79°. The angle of force application
used generally was approximately 15° from the dorsal face, applied toward
the dorsal face. Over 2/3 of these flakes are lipped at the proximal end on
the ventral face. Specimens have diffuse bulbs of force. Concentrated bulbs
of force were not observed, as are common when using direct percussion.
Almost all specimens had radiating (undulating) force lines on the ventral
faces. Fine grained chert fractures cannot be produced without force lines at
channel flake thicknesses.

There are almost equal numbers of channel flakes with parallel lateral
edges and with lateral edges tapering toward the distal ends. Over 2/3 of
these flakes were broken during original detachment from the preforms. The
residual striking platforms generally are roughly rectangular, and the striking
platform width averages about twice the thickness. Lateral edges flare out
sharply from the striking platform. This condition is caused by the nature of
the platform isolation geometry. This flare is the Hertzian Cone force-flare,
but modified by platform isolation and preform facial convexity. There are
about equal numbers of flakes with feathered or abrupt (snapped or hinged)
terminations on the distal ends. These channel flakes do not have much
curvature because of the nature of flake removal (from flat faces of
preforms).

Widths and thicknesses of Folsom channel flakes are compared-in Table 5
for replicates (Table 4), Hanson (Frison and Bradley, 1980: Fig. 67), and
Lindenmeier (Wilmsen and Roberts, 1978:Table 38). The average dimensions in these collections seem to be fairly close. This situation may indicate
some consistency in the overall technology involved.

SUMMARY
Information is presented on various attributes of experimental Folsom
points and channel flakes from relatively large samples. Some of the most
significant attributes of channel flakes could be predicted from the
technology involved in the fluting process. Since most Folsom channel

flakes found on archeological sites will probably be broken, it is recommended that emphasis be placed on proximal end fragments. Many of the
significant attributes of channel flakes are on this type of fragment.
Information presented represents the results of a single flintknapper, using
two pressure techniques for channel flake removal. Other flintknappers who
replicate Folsom points should publish similar data on large samples for
comparison. Of most importance is the need to publish more data on
Folsom points and channel flakes from archeological sites in order to
establish a better picture of the quantitative nature and variability of these artifacts.
