MANAGEMENT SUMMARY

This document reports the results of an intensive cultural resource survey of a proposed
pipeline reroute for Brigham Oil & Gas, L.P. (Brigham) in Matagorda County, Texas. Following
the completion of the cultural resources survey of Brigham’s Green Ranch Well #1 well pad,
access road, and pipeline (Weinstein 2005), a reroute of a portion of the pipeline was deemed
necessary in order to avoid oyster habitat and significant wetland areas. In total, the proposed
pipeline reroute is approximately 5.3 miles (mi) (8.5 kilometers [km]) long with a 75.0-foot- (ft)
(23.2-meter- [m]) wide construction easement.
The pipeline reroute right-of-way (ROW) will require a Section 404 permit issued by the
US Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) for impacts to USACE jurisdictional areas. As such, the
undertaking falls under the regulations of Section 106 of the National Historic Preservation Act
(NHPA) of 1966, as amended. The USACE was specifically concerned with those portions of
the proposed pipeline reroute that might impact the previously recorded historic Palacios Town
site, 41MG113. Because the eastern boundaries of site 41MG113 have never been clearly
defined, the USACE requested that investigations be concentrated within those portions of the
proposed pipeline that would have the potential to impact any undocumented components of
site 41MG113. As such, Horizon’s efforts were restricted to the central portion of the proposed
pipeline reroute, as it ran the highest risk of intersecting with site 41MG113.
The cultural resources survey was conducted on 7 May 2007. In all, 13 shovel tests
were excavated within the central segment of the proposed pipeline reroute, exceeding the
Texas State Minimum Archeological Survey Standards (TSMASS). Intensive surface inspection
and shovel testing regimen failed to produce any evidence of archeological sites within the
proposed pipeline reroute ROW. In particular, no artifacts associated with 41MG113 were
observed within the ROW.
Based on the lack of intact cultural materials and the overall disturbance of the area, it is
Horizon’s opinion that the proposed reroute will have no adverse impact on the previously
recorded site 41MG113. Horizon therefore recommends that cultural resources clearance be
granted for the proposed pipeline reroute ROW. However, in the unlikely event that any cultural
materials (including human remains or burial features) are inadvertently discovered at any point
during construction, use, or ongoing maintenance of the pipeline, even in previously surveyed

1.0 INTRODUCTION

This document reports the results of an intensive cultural resource survey of a proposed
pipeline reroute for Brigham Oil & Gas, L.P. (Brigham) in Matagorda County, Texas. Following
the completion of the cultural resources survey of Brigham’s Green Ranch Well #1 well pad,
access road, and pipeline (Weinstein 2005), a reroute of a portion of the pipeline was deemed
necessary in order to avoid oyster habitat and significant wetland areas (Figures 1 and 2). This
pipeline reroute initiates at a point on the previously surveyed right-of-way (ROW) located on
the southern banks of Oyster Lake and proceeds westward traversing a series of large spoil
piles associated with the dredging of the old Gulf Intracoastal Water Way (GIWW). The
proposed pipeline will then be installed underneath the old GIWW and continue northward
traversing high marsh wetlands to intersect with an existing access road. The pipeline will be
directionally drilled or bored under the pass for Oyster Lake and then will parallel the county
road northward to uplands. Once in uplands and agricultural land, the pipeline will continue
northward to intersect an existing gathering line. In total, the proposed pipeline reroute is
approximately 5.3 miles (mi) (8.5 kilometers [km]) long with a 75.0-foot- (ft) (23.2-meter- [m])
wide construction easement.
The cultural resources investigation consisted of an archival review, an intensive
pedestrian survey of the proposed pipeline reroute, and the production of a report suitable for
review by the State Historic Preservation Officer (SHPO) in accordance with the Texas
Historical Commission’s (THC) Rules of Practice and Procedure, Chapter 26, Section 27, and
the Council of Texas Archeologists (CTA) Guidelines for Cultural Resources Management
Reports. Abigail Peyton (Horizon project archeologist) served as the Principal Investigator for
the project and conducted all the fieldwork.
The pipeline reroute ROW will require a Section 404 permit issued by the US Army
Corps of Engineers (USACE) for impacts to USACE jurisdictional areas. As such, the
undertaking falls under the regulations of Section 106 of the National Historic Preservation Act
(NHPA) of 1966, as amended. The USACE was specifically concerned with those portions of
the proposed pipeline reroute that might impact the previously recorded historic Palacios Town
site, 41MG113. Because the eastern boundaries of site 41MG113 have never been clearly
defined, the USACE requested that investigations be concentrated within those portions of the

site 41MG113. As such, Horizon’s efforts were restricted to the central portion of the proposed
pipeline reroute, as it ran the highest risk of intersecting with site 41MG113.
The cultural resources survey was conducted on 7 May 2007. This primarily entailed
intensive surface inspection as well as shovel testing. For linear projects, the Texas State
Minimum Archeological Survey Standards (TSMASS) require the excavation of a minimum of
16 shovel tests per mile within linear project corridors with a ROW width of 100.0 ft (30.2 m). At
the request of the USACE, only the central segment of the proposed pipeline reroute was
assessed. As the proposed pipeline ROW measures 75.0 ft (23.2 m) in width, the number of
required shovel tests along the 0.5 mi (0.9 km) central segment of the proposed pipeline reroute
totaled 6. No shovel tests were excavated within the southern segment because the ROW had
been previously surveyed in order to secure access for construction vehicles to the well pad
locations (Weinstein 2005). This access corridor consequently coincides with the southern
segment of the proposed pipeline. Additionally, severe modern disturbances have significantly
reduced the potential for the discovery of intact, significant cultural resources in this area due to
the presence of large successive spoil piles that line the southern shores of Oyster Lake.
Furthermore, investigations were not pursued within the ROW of the northern segment as a
majority of the proposed pipeline reroute parallels an existing road and traverses primarily
upland environments.
Survey efforts were primarily targeted at the central segment of the proposed pipeline at
the request of the USACE in order to determine if the proposed ROW traverses any
undocumented portion of the previously recorded historic site 41MG113. In all, 13 shovel tests
were excavated within the central segment of the proposed pipeline reroute, thus exceeding the
TSMASS. Intensive surface inspection and shovel testing regimen failed to produce any
evidence of additional archeological sites within the proposed pipeline reroute ROW. In
particular, no artifacts associated with 41MG113 were observed within the ROW.
Based on the lack of intact cultural materials and the overall disturbance of the area, it is
Horizon’s opinion that the proposed reroute will have no adverse impact on the previously
recorded site 41MG113. Horizon recommends that cultural resources clearance be granted for
the proposed pipeline reroute ROW. However, in the unlikely event that any cultural materials
(including human remains or burial features) are inadvertently discovered at any point during
construction, use, or ongoing maintenance of the pipeline, even in previously surveyed areas,
all work should cease immediately, and the THC should be notified of the discovery.

2.0 PROJECT AREA DESCRIPTION

The proposed pipeline reroute is located in southwestern Matagorda County
approximately 8.0 mi (11.4 km) south of the town of Palacios, Texas. Specifically, the pipeline
reroute is located on Palacios Point, a small peninsula surrounded by Matagorda Bay to the
west and south, Oyster Lake to the southeast, and Palacios Bayou to the north. The proposed
pipeline reroute ROW can be segregated into 3 primary segments: the southern, central, and
northern segments. The southern segment begins on the southern banks of Oyster Lake and
travels westward across a series of large spoil piles. The southern segment of the proposed
pipeline coincides with the previously surveyed ROW associated with a road designed to
provide access to nearby oil well pads (Weinstein 2005).
The central segment crosses the old GIWW and continues in a northeasterly direction
traversing open grasslands with a relatively high surface visibility (ca. 60 to 90%) throughout.
The proposed pipeline reroute eventually intersects with an existing 2-tract road that runs
parallel to the shoreline. In general, the central segment traverses a flat and featureless
lowland area dominated by wetland vegetation as well as scrub mesquite and cactus. Dense
clays were frequently encountered at depths ranging from 4.0 to 12.0 inches below surface
(inbs) (10.0 to 30.4 centimeters below surface [cmbs]). Intermittent sand bars were also found
to skirt the edges of expansive wetland area to the east. Overview photographs of the central
segment of the proposed pipeline are provided in Figures 3 and 4.
The northern segment parallels the existing 2-tract road, which eventually turns into
County Road 3221. The proposed pipeline reroute ROW follows County Road 3221 and
subsequently diverts west across upland fields toward the gathering point. The northern
segment proposes to traverse primarily upland environments devoid of wetlands or oyster
habitat.

2.1

PHYSIOGRAPHY AND HYDROLOGY

The proposed pipeline reroute is located in southwest Matagorda County within the
Coastal Prairie region of the Gulf Coastal Plains physiographic province (Fenneman 1938). The
Coastal Prairie consists of young deltaic sands, silts, and clays that erode to nearly flat
grasslands with little or no slopes. Trees are uncommon except along streams. Hydrologically,
the pipeline is situated within Matagorda Bay and the Colorado-Lavaca River Basin. The
pipeline reroute is underlain by the Gulf Coast Aquifer, which forms a broad belt along the

Gulf of Mexico from Florida to Mexico. In Texas, the aquifer consists of a complex of
interbedded clays, silts, sands, and gravels of the Cenozoic Age (Baker 1979).

2.2

GEOLOGY AND GEOMORPHOLOGY

Matagorda County soils are underlain by Pleistocene formations that dip gently toward
the Gulf of Mexico. Specifically, the Beaumont Formation, which consists of clay, silt, and sand
situated in stream channels, point bars, natural levees, swamps, and marshes, underlies the
APE (Barnes et al. 1974).
The proposed reroute traverses 3 soil units: Livia loam, 0 to 1% slopes (LvA), Palacios
loam, 0 to 1% slopes (PaA), and Veston loam, strongly saline, frequently flooded (Vs) (NRCS
2007a). These soils are prone to frequent flooding due to their proximity to the ocean and
generally lack permeability.
The Livia Loam, 0 to 1% slopes, (LvA) is poorly drained, very slowly permeable soil that
is formed in loamy and clayey alluvial sediments and is found on nearly level coastal plains with
elevations less than 15.0 ft (4.6 m) (NRCS 2006b). A typical profile consists of a dark grayishbrown saline silt loam to a depth of 5.0 inches (in) (13.0 centimeters [cm]) followed by black
saline silty clay to a depth of 14.0 in (36.2 cm) underlain by 31.0 in (79.4 cm) of dark gray saline
silty clay. Below 45.0 in (114.3 cm), the substratum consists of olive-brown and yellowishbrown saline silty clay and saline red clay.
Palacios loam, 0 to 1% slopes, (PaA) consists of very deep and poorly drained clayey
loam. The Palacios soil series is generally found on low coastal plains and is occasionally
inundated by seawater from gulf storms. A typical profile consists of a very dark grayish-brown
loam to a depth of 7.0 in (17.4 cm) followed by very dark gray clay that extends to 40.0 in (101.4
cm) underlain by a grayish-brown to light brownish-gray silty clay loam to a depth of 70.0 in
(178.0 cm).
Veston loam, strongly saline, frequently flooded (Vs) consists of very deep and poorly
drained saline soils located very near sea level in coastal lowlands. A typical profile consists of
dark gray saline loam to a depth of 12.0 in (30.4 cm) underlain by saline gray loam to a depth of
24 in (61.0 cm). A saline gray silty clay loam stratified with loam, silt loam, and fine sandy loam
is located below 24 in (61.0 cm).

2.3

CLIMATE

Located in the Upper Coast Texas climatic division, Matagorda County has a humid,
subtropical climate characterized by warm to hot summers and mild winters.
Temperatures in
the county vary from an average low of 44° Fahrenheit in January to an average high of 92°
Fahrenheit in July (Handbook of Texas 2007). The nearby Gulf of Mexico provides the county
with a mild, marine-like climate.

2.4

FLORA AND FAUNA

Matagorda County is located within the Gulf Prairies and Marshes ecological zone
(Correll and Johnston 1979). The Gulf Prairies and Marshes region has high humidity and
warm temperatures that allow for a long growing season, more than 300 days. The climax
vegetation of the Gulf Prairies is mostly tall grass prairie, with some post oak savannah. Much
of the area has been invaded by trees and brush. Examples of these are mesquite, live oaks,
prickly pear, and acacias. The principal prairie grasses are big bluestem, seacoast bluestem,
Indiangrass, eastern gamagrass, gulf muhly, species of Panictum and others. Introduced
grasses, such as bermudagrass and carpet grass, are common in pastures and have escaped
into uncultivated areas.
The families Amaranthaceae and Chenopodiaceae are wellrepresented in the Coastal Prairies and Marshes (Correll and Johnston 1979). Carex, Cyperus,
Eleocharis, Juncus, Scirpus, and several cordgrasses and seashore saltgrass are found in the
salt marshes (Correll and Johnston 1979).
Matagorda County is in the southern portion of Blair’s (1950) Texan biotic province. The
Texan Biotic Province is a broad, ecologically transitional region between the Tamaulipan
Province to the west and the Austroriparian Province to the east. Because of its ecotonal
nature, the Texan Province supports a mixture of plant and animal species characteristic of
Tamaulipan and Austroriparian provinces. The area harbors a variety of wildlife, including
bobcats, coyotes, otters, white-tailed deer, and numerous smaller mammals, as well as oysters,
shrimp, fish, snakes, and waterfowl (Handbook of Texas 2007).

3.0 CULTURAL BACKGROUND

The general temporal framework for most prehistoric archeological sites in Texas is
based on the seriation of projectile point types originally established by Suhm et al. (1954) and
later revised by Suhm and Jelks (1962), Prewitt (1981, 1985), and Turner and Hester (1993).
This temporal framework consists of a tripartite system based on technological changes in
diagnostic artifacts that occurred as a result of indigenous adaptation to changing environments
and subsistence strategies. The framework is broken down into 3 main periods: PaleoIndian
(pre-8500 BP), Archaic (8500 to 950 BP), and Late Prehistoric (950 to 250 BP). The Archaic
period is further subdivided into the Early Archaic (8500 to 4200 BP), the Middle Archaic (4200
BP to 3100 BP), and the Late Archaic (3100 to 950 BP).

3.1

PALEOINDIAN PERIOD (CA. 12,000 TO 8500 B.P.)

The PaleoIndian period is characterized by highly mobile groups hunting over large
areas. Although now-extinct megafauna, such as mammoth and bison, are often found
associated with sites of this time period, smaller game, such as deer and turtles, were also likely
utilized as food items. Undoubtedly, plant foods made up a portion of the diet, as well. Coastal
resources of the central Texas gulf coast were also likely exploited by PaleoIndian groups;
however, according to Ricklis (1994), there are presently no intact subsurface coastal sites from
this time period as the shoreline was situated a considerable distance seaward due to lower
global sea levels. Thus, the potential of finding buried sites from this period along the present
day coast are more likely representative of terrestrial and riverine adaptations. Additionally, the
Clovis and Folsom points that are indicative of Early PaleoIndian occupations, and Plainview,
Golondrina, Scottsbluff, Meserve, Eden, Dalton, San Patrice, and Angostura points
characteristic of the later span of the period, are merely found as sporadic surface finds in this
coast region.

3.2

ARCHAIC PERIOD (CA. 8500 TO 950 B.P.)

3.2.1

Early Archaic (ca. 8500 to 4200 B.P.)

Like the PaleoIndian period, Early Archaic population densities remained low, still
consisting of small, mobile bands. Artifact assemblages from the Early Archaic period are
rather meager, consisting mainly of oyster shell, some Rangia shell during the later part of the
Early Archaic, and significantly lesser quantities of lithic debris, scrapers, utilized flakes, and a

small assortment of projectile points including Bell, Early Triangular, Tortugas, and Gower
points. Little to no faunal material has been recovered from these sites due to complete decay
of bone. A few fish otoliths have been recovered from Early Archaic sites, though not in
significant quantities that would indicate fishing was significant to the subsistence economy
(Ricklis 1994). Ricklis (1994) defines 2 separate periods of shoreline occupation of the central
Texas coast during the Early Archaic, ca. 7500 to 6800 BP and ca. 5800 to 4200 BP. Based on
Ricklis’s (1994) assessment of seasonality studies for the Early Archaic occupations along the
central Texas coast, these sites were utilized during the winter through the early spring, when
plant and game foods were more scarce.
3.2.2

Middle Archaic (ca. 4200 to 3100 BP)

During the Middle Archaic, the trend toward bottomland exploitation increased, with
fewer sites found along minor tributaries. Population densities remained relatively low, but
obviously increased over prior periods, with broad-spectrum hunting and gathering represented
at larger sites where food sources were more abundant. Interestingly, along the central Texas
gulf coast, this period of occupation appears to be all but absent from the archeological record
(Ricklis 1994).
3.2.3

Late Archaic (ca. 3100 to 950 B.P)

In contrast to earlier time periods, the Late Archaic represents a period of increased
population and site density. It also marks the stabilization of the sea level to its modern
position. During the Late Archaic period on the central Texas coast, the size of archeological
sites increased, middens became thicker, and the artifact assemblage became more diverse
and abundant. The assemblage from the Late Archaic period contains various dart points, such
as Kent and Ensor, knives, scrapers, Clear Fork Gouges, and Olmos Bifaces. Shells were
utilized as tools as well as decorated for adornment. There is also evidence for the use of
basketry. There is also a dramatic increase of otoliths at sites, revealing fish as a significant
resource that supplemented the harvesting of a wider range of shell. According to Ricklis
(1994), in this period one can see well-defined group territories and a systematic response to
growing population density through the use of cemeteries, which appear for the first time in the
region.

3.3

LATE PREHISTORIC PERIOD (CA. 950 TO 250 B.P.)

The Late Prehistoric, in general, is characterized by the advent of the bow and arrow, as
well as ceramics, in Texas. Hunting and gathering continued, with an emphasis on deer and
small game. Ricklis (1994) identifies 2 distinct times within the Late Prehistoric period: the
Initial Late Prehistoric and the Final Late Prehistoric. The Initial Late Prehistoric is represented
by the increased presence of small arrow points, such as Scallorn points, and the increased use
of plain, sandy-paste ceramics. The Final Late Prehistoric is essentially the Rockport Phase.
The artifact assemblage for the Final Late Prehistoric, or Rockport Phase, is dominated by the
Perdiz point. Ceramics from this period include Rockport Incised and Rockport Black on Gray,
which was decorated using asphaltum. Resources and resource zones exploited during the
Late Prehistoric increased from the use of the coastal shoreline, hunting and gathering, fishing,

Survey of a Pipeline Reroute Right-of-Way for Brigham Oil and Gas, L.P., Matagorda County, Texas

and ultimately the addition of horticulture. Most Late Prehistoric components along the central
Texas coast overlie Late Archaic occupations. The Rockport Phase is believed to be culturally
affiliated with the Karankawa Indians, whose traditions may have developed during the Late
Prehistoric period and lasted into the Historic.

3.4

HISTORIC PERIOD (CA. 250 B.P. TO PRESENT)

The Karankawa Indians occupied the central Texas coastal region into the Historic
period. They have been described as fierce, war-like peoples. A closer inspection reveals a
nomadic native group well adapted to life in their coastal prairie environment. Archeological
evidence suggests that they were drawn to the Texas barrier islands in pursuit of a seasonal
marine subsistence base. Karankawas utilized dugout canoes to travel with their families and
belongings between the mainland and islands.
Evidence suggests that this culture’s
cannibalistic practices were more ceremonial in nature than a source of nutrition. Small
amounts of human flesh were consumed to exact revenge on or obtain the courage of their
enemies (Handbook of Texas 2007). The first mention of contact with the Karankawa peoples
was made by Álvar Nuñez Cabeza de Vaca in 1528. Continued contact with Europeans
explorers and eventually early Americans let to the extinction of the group by the mid-1800s.
Exploration of the Central Texas gulf coast for the Spanish begins with the arrival of
Cabeza de Vaca in 1528 and later by the French in 1685 by the explorer La Salle. Cabeza de
Vaca has been considered the chronicler of initial contact with the Karankawa, which has
provided archeologists with historic and ethnohistoric perspectives on this aboriginal group. La
Salle, through visions of colonizing the mouth of the Mississippi for France, found his way
mistakenly to the Texas Gulf Coast and has left his mark in Texas history.
The Spanish Colonial period in Texas begins in 1750 with colonization in the lower Rio
Grande area. These developments exploded into the cattle ranching industry, which has played
an important role in shaping Texas history through Mexico’s occupation of Texas, the Republic
of Texas Period (1836-1845), Antebellum Statehood (1846-1861), the Civil War (1861-1865),
and the Reconstruction period (1865-1876) on into the late 19th century. In the coastal bend
area between 1825 and 1840, a developmental phase occurred in the ranching industry when
the Martín de León colony met with southern Anglos and their slaves. They encountered the
tradition of Mexican coastal cattle-horse culture (Jordan 1993). Anglo-American influences in
the ranching system were slow at the start but dominated the industry in the region by the
1880s. Other European settlers latched onto the ranching lifestyle as well from early German
settlers to eventually freed slaves, making the historic period in the central Texas coastal area
an interesting blend of cultural traditions.

4.0 ARCHIVAL RESEARCH

Horizon conducted archival research at the map files maintained by the THC, the Texas
Archeological Research Laboratory (TARL), and the State Marine Archeologist to delineate the
locations of previously recorded archeological sites and shipwrecks, the boundaries of areas
previously surveyed for cultural resources in the vicinity of the proposed pipeline reroute, and
sensitive lease tracts within the bay system that contain known or potential historic shipwrecks.
This research found 1 archeological site recorded within a 1.2-mi (2.0-km) radius of the
proposed pipeline reroute.
Site 41MG113 is a historic site known as the Palacios Town site and is located at the
western end of a short peninsula at the juncture of Tres Palacios Bay and Matagorda Bay
proper. The representation of the town's extent and the location of specific town features that
appear on early maps of the Texas coast from 1846 through 1888 indicate that the site could
have covered up to 600 ac at Palacios Point. The site was originally documented by Barto
Arnold in 1998 as part of the 1998 INA/TAMU Surveys, Texas Operations, and was revisited by
Eloise Gadus in 2000 during the Gulf Intracoastal Waterway Survey, Brazos River FloodgatesPalacios Point, for the USACE, Galveston District. The only feature identified at the site
consists of the concrete foundation found by Barto Arnold in 1998. Arnold found the concrete
foundation sill at the northeast corner of the peninsula and reported associated ceramics, glass,
bricks, clay, and iron fragments. The town site has been affected by both man-made and
natural disturbances. The old channel of the GIWW slices through the center of the peninsula,
cutting the town site in 2. Additional impacts to the site include maintenance of the channel by
dredging, wave erosion, and natural destructive forces such as hurricanes. Despite these
impacts, professional archeologists still consider the site potentially eligible for inclusion in the
National Register of Historic Places (NRHP) (Atlas 2007), though the actual NRHP status of this
site is unknown.
No other sites, including those currently listed on the NRHP or designated as State
Archeological Landmarks (SALs), occur within or immediately adjacent to the proposed pipeline
reroute ROW.

5.0 METHODOLOGY

A single archeologist completed the pedestrian survey of the proposed pipeline reroute
ROW on 7 May 2007. This primarily entailed intensive surface inspection as well as shovel
testing. For linear projects, the TSMASS require the excavation of a minimum of 16 shovel
tests per mile within linear project corridors with a ROW width of 100.0 ft (30.2 m). At the
request of the USACE, only the central segment of the proposed pipeline reroute was assessed.
As the proposed pipeline ROW measures 75.0 ft (23.2 m) in width, the number of required
shovel tests along the 0.5-mi (0.9-km) central segment of the proposed pipeline reroute totaled
6. No shovel tests were excavated within the southern segment because the ROW had been
previously surveyed in order to secure access for construction vehicles to the well pad locations.
This access corridor consequently coincides with the southern segment of the proposed
pipeline. Additionally, severe modern disturbances have significantly reduced the potential for
the discovery of intact, significant cultural resources in this area due to the presence of large
successive spoil piles that line the shores of Oyster Lake. Furthermore, investigations were not
pursued within the ROW of the northern segment as a majority of the proposed pipeline reroute
parallels an existing road and traverses primarily upland environments.
Survey efforts were primarily targeted at the central segment of the proposed pipeline at
the request of the USACE in order to determine if the proposed ROW traverses any
undocumented portion of the previously recorded historic site 41MG113. In all, 13 shovel tests
were excavated within the central segment of the proposed pipeline reroute, thus exceeding the
TSMASS.
Field notes were maintained on terrain, vegetation, soils, land forms, shovel tests,
cultural material observed (if any), etc. Standardized shovel test forms were completed for
every shovel test. These forms included location data, depth, soil type, and notations on any
artifacts encountered. Digital photographs with a photo log were also completed as appropriate.
The locations of all shovel tests were recorded via handheld GPS units utilizing the UTM
coordinate system and the NAD 27 map datum. Shovel test locations are presented in Figure 5.
Shovel test data are presented in Appendix A.

6.0 RESULTS AND RECOMMENDATIONS

6.1

RESULTS

The survey of the central segment of the 5.3-mi (8.5-km) pipeline reroute ROW resulted
in entirely negative findings. No cultural materials were observed on the surface or within any of
the 13 excavated shovel tests. In particular, no historic artifacts, features, or undocumented
components associated with site 41MG113 were encountered.

6.2

RECOMMENDATIONS

Based on the negative results of the cultural resources survey of the proposed pipeline
reroute ROW, it is Horizon’s opinion that the proposed reroute will have no adverse impact on
the previously recorded site 41MG113. Horizon therefore recommends that cultural resources
clearance be granted for the proposed pipeline reroute ROW. However, in the unlikely event
that any cultural materials (including human remains or burial features) are inadvertently
discovered at any point during construction, use, or ongoing maintenance of the pipeline, even
in previously surveyed areas, all work should cease immediately, and the THC should be
notified of the discovery.
