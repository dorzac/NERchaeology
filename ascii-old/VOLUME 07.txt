TEXAS ARCHEOLOGICAL PROGRESS
Prior to the organization of Texas Archeological
and Paleontological Society there was very little
known concerning Texas archeology as a whole.
It is true that a few investigators widely scattered
over the vast domain of Texas had been quietly
collecting materials and data and preserving them
against the future day when some cultural urge would
be born in the minds of Texans to preserve to
posterity both the remnants of its historic past, and
the artifacts of the strange races which inhabited
Texas in the remote mists of antiquity.

Perhaps the thought therefore that little
spectacular was to be found in the Plains area, while
a pot hunter’s paradise awaited just beyond,
influenced trained scientists to pass over the area
as not worth the time and trouble of an investigation.

How mistaken they were has been abundantly
proved in the past issues of this Bulletin. The
discoveries in the Abilene Region have been
especially startling. Among these are age-old

The Society’s Income
The publications of The Society are financed
solely by the dues payments of members, sales of
Bulletins to museum, college, and university
libraries and by voluntary donations of scientific
minded individuals to the publication fund of The
Society. Neither officers nor editor receive any pay
for their work, nor are manuscripts paid for. The
whole income of the Society, less postage and
stationery costs, may thus be devoted to publication
costs. None of the officers of The Society are
professionally engaged in nor derive any income
whatever from archeology; their interest is purely

for the encouragement of the proper collection and

and their study and classification and the publication
of the results of the researches incident thereto.”
The field of activity outlined above proved to be
too great for one Bulletin and publication has
therefore been almost exclusively devoted to
archeological research and discussion of faunal
remains dating from Pleistocene times or such as
possibly may be found with man’s artifacts and
remains.

beads were found.
In the discussion of shell ornaments, frequent
reference must be made to the T. M. Sanders site.
More shellwork came from those 21 graves than
from all other East Texas excavations. Of the 7,067
beads from this site, the types represented were as
follows:

The greatest number of European beads found
in a midden deposit was at an old Spanish mission—
Espiritu Santo—near Goliad. Here were many glass
beads, most of them of the small type. The colors
were blue, red and white.
It is interesting to note the positions in which
beads were found in graves. Many were around
the neck. Others were in a variety of positions, some
tending to show the possible uses to which they
had been placed in the adornment of the deceased.

Burial AC-1 in the Caplen Mound on Bolivar
Peninsula, Galveston County, had 46 conch shell
beads, ½ inch long, around the waist. There was
red paint on the beads. The beads probably had been
attached to a belt or on a skin garment. One skeleton
had a number of beads on and around the skull,
apparently having adorned the hair at the time of
interment. Another burial had 90 small beads under

In burial B-17 was a redware bottle

shell (Oliva gracilis) beads about 3/8
inch long. Apparently the beads were
on a coverlet of some kind. Around a
conch shell in burial B-20 were 316
small beads made from the columella of
the conch shell. In a large bowl in the
latter burial were two disc shell beads,
an undrilled shell disc and four small
pendant-like bone ornaments.
Pendants are comparatively scarce.
But the few found are of various
materials—bone, shell, animal teeth and
stones. The most artistic and best
decorated is a bone pendant from burial
AC-44 at Caplen Mound. It was of the
bull-roarer type, 4 1/8” x ¾” x 1/16”,
with notched edges and band lines
paralleled by punctate decoration. The
ornament rested over the left ear and
may have been worn in the hair.
An interesting type of insect effigy
shell pendant is represented by five
specimens. One of these, from a midden
deposit on L. L. Winterbauer farm,
Wood County, is made from the shell
of a fresh water mussel (Unio sp.). It is
2 ½ inches long and has a maximum
width of one inch. It is carved in the
general shape of a locust or grasshopper.
On the obverse side it bears incised lines
and dots representing the tail, wings,
head and eyes. The notches and groove
that gave shape to the head also served
for suspending the pendant.
Three of the specimens came from
camp refuse, at the edge of a cemetery,
on the Clements Bros. farm, Cass
County. They are made from a split
columella of the conch shell. The incised
lines are on the convex side. The reverse
shows half of a drilled hole, running
longitudinally, as if a long bead had been
split. The designs are almost identical
with those on the mussel shell pendant.

The differences are in size and that the conch shell,
being thicker, permitted the drilling of a suspension
hole through the head of the insect. The pendants
vary in length from 2 to 2 ½ inches; in width from
7/16 to 9/16 inch. Another specimen, of the same
shape, design and workmanship, came from the C.
H. Coley collection in Titus County.
In burial M-l at the Oso site, Nueces County,
were eight small pendants, made from mussel shells.
They were to the south and partly beneath the skull
of an adult female. Each was triangular in shape
and had a small drilled hole in the apex. In length
they varied from 1 3/8” to 1 3/16 inches; in width
from 1 to 1 1/8 inch. Around the edges were delicate
notches, ranging in number from 40 to 90. The
notches show more prominently on the concave
side. The position in which found indicates that the
pendants were worn in the ear.
In the midden deposit at the T. M. Sanders place
was a mussel shell pendant 4 3/8” x l 3/8”. The
specimen is symmetrical, the edges having been
ground down. The suspension hole, near the edge
in the thick end, is neatly drilled and has a diameter
of about 1/10 inch.
With burial AA-5, in Morhiss Mound on
Guadalupe River, Victoria County, was a triangular
pendant made of conch shell. It was beneath the
chin. There is one suspension hole, near the edge
opposite the apex. The hole is ¼ on the concave
and 3/16 inch in diameter on the convex side. The
decayed edges show to have been well shaped, but
there is no carving now visible on the specimen.
On the convex side are remains of shallow pits or
punctate decoration. This specimen is of more than
passing interest, due to its having been found in an
isolated earthen mound that bears earmarks of the
Mississippi Valley Mound-Builder culture.
Animal teeth occasionally were converted into
pendants, by the simple process of drilling a hole
through the large end. Such a pendant is that of a
drilled bear’s tooth from a midden deposit on the
E. H. Moores’ plantation on Red River, Bowie
County. The length of the pendant is 2 ¾ inches.
The hole, which has a diameter of 3/16 inch, is very
near the edge. Alligator teeth pendants sometimes
are found in Southeast Texas.

13

In a midden deposit on the Stubbs farm on Old
River, a former channel of Trinity River, in
Chambers County, was found a rudely shaped
pendant. It has been identified by Dr. E. H. Sellards
as a calcareous nodule resembling fired clay. The
specimen has a very rough, irregular surface,
showing no attempt at smoothing or polishing. It is
2 7/8 inches long, with a maximum diameter of 1 1/8
inch. From the center it tapers gradually toward the
ends. At the smaller end is a perforation 3/8 inch in
diameter at the outside and 1/8 inch at the center—
it having been drilled from both sides.
Several highly polished stone ornaments, of the
so-called plummet type, are reported to have been
found by a disinterested fisherman in a grave on
Oso Creek, Nueces County. One of these specimens
is included in the John B. Dunn collection in the
University museum. It is 1 7/8 inches long, slightly
triangular, with a maximum diameter of 1 1/8 inches.
It tapers toward the grooved end, terminating in a
node 7/16 inch in diameter. There are three grooves
spaced 3/16 inch apart. The stone, which is very
highly polished, is of a brownish-black color, with
an occasional yellow splotch. It has been identified
by Dr. Sellards as a very fine, hard siltstone.
An outstanding type of ornament is the shell
gorget. The Handbook of American Indian 4
describes them as “objects worn in some proximate
relation with the gorge or throat. They may be
suspended from a string encircling the neck, or may
be attached to the dress.” Some are engraved, others
plain. All specimens here classed as gorgets are
round and bear two small holes, closely spaced,
near the margin. Triangular and rectangular shell
and bone ornaments, classed as pendants, bear only
one suspension hole; while the typical gorget bears
two.
It is interesting to note that at the T. M. Sanders
place, in Lamar county—several hundred miles
from the source of supply—conch shell gorgets
were much more numerous and highly decorated
than at the Caplen and Oso sites, in Galveston and
Nueces counties, where such shells were plentiful.
Of 21 gorgets from the Sanders place, 13 are
whole.

stated, they are from the T. M. Sanders farm.
The decoration of one gorget embodies five
On two of the gorgets an open-work or “cutaway” cross constitutes the sole decoration. One
of these, 2 ¾ inches in diameter, lay a few inches
back of the skull in burial B-2. The cross was formed
by cutting out four small segments, each
representing ¼ of a circle. The resultant holes were
so located as to form the outlines of an equal-arm
cross in the central or uncut portion. The curved
outer edges of the holes are equidistant from the
rim of the gorget, thus giving the effect of a cross
enclosed in a circle. This is the same type of design
as that incised on certain earthenware vessels in
Northeast Texas.5 It too is almost identical with a
painted design on the bottom of a water bottle from
Scott County, Missouri (Yale Collection), as
pictured by MacCurdy.6 But the crosses on the
Missouri gorgets7 differ greatly from the Texas
specimens.

crosses and five human heads. It is one of the most
intricate designs used. The large central cross,
enclosed in a circle, has a small cross adjoining each
arm. The four small crosses join, and are enclosed
by, the circular rim. Thus there are two concentric
circles. Each cross is formed by cutting away four
roughly triangular pieces of the shell. The central
cross forms a background against which the inner
head rests. The other four heads are so arranged
that one arm of each small cross forms a part of the
neck of the adjoining head. The heads themselves
are faintly engraved, requiring close scrutiny to
decipher the details. Each has a large, hooked nose;
thick, protruding lips; short, thick neck; long, sharppointed eyes; a crown-like headdress; ear plug and
pendant. The above described gorget, with a small
undecorated one, came from beneath the chin of
one of five skulls in group burial B-12.

The other specimens of this type came to light
in an unusual manner. A laboratory worker in
removing the dirt from a skull— burial B-17—
found the small gorget inside. It is in a bad state of
preservation, the edges being greatly decayed. The
four cut-out sections are triangular in shape. The
outline of a cross is thus formed; but the shape of

The heads on this engraved gorget have several
features in common with that of a human figure on
a shell gorget from Eddyville, Kentucky.8 The lips
on the two specimens are identical; the eyes and
noses are almost exactly the same; the headdresses
are very similar.

Texas Archeological and Paleontological Society
An outstanding specimen is a gorget bearing a
human head carved in relief. It represents a very
successful attempt at portraiture. The ornament was
under a chin in group burial B-5 containing seven
skeletons. The gorget, 2 ½ inches in diameter, was
in a soft, crumbly condition when uncovered. It was
treated at once with preservative, consisting of
celluloid mixed with equal parts of acetone and amyl
acetate. The equal-armed cross appears in the
background. The arms consist of three parallel
engraved lines. Considerable skill was displayed in
the carving of this portrait. Even the details are
realistically brought out. The eyes are long and
narrow; the nose wide and prominent; the lips thick
and protruding. Hair and ear ornaments may be seen
in place. Here is a picture of a prehistoric MoundBuilder as he was seen and portrayed by a member
of his tribe.
Just below the chin, on skeleton No. 1 in burial
B-13, was part of a gorget bearing a bird design.
The bird has a long, graceful neck and a sharp beak.
The body of the bird was missing. Another gorget,
plowed up by the landowner, bears—among other
intricate cut-away designs—four conventionalized
bird heads. They may represent the crane.
There is one bird gorget so realistically carved
as to leave no doubt about its identity. The tail,
outspread wings, spurred legs, wattle and other
familiar features label it as a proud turkey cock. It
was with burial B-20. The diameter is 4 ¾ inches.
An equal-armed cross is prominent in the
background. The gorget, with a pearl bead just
above it, rested beneath the chin of the central
skeleton.
One of the gorgets is decorated with a swastika
design enclosed in concentric circles. The edge is
badly decayed, the central portion in a fair state of
preservation. The gorget measures 2 ¾” x 2 ½”.
The swastika or cross variant—formed by the
“open-work technique”— is inside the small
engraved circle. Connecting the first and second
circles are spoke-like elements. The base of each
“spoke” bears a small drilled dot, thus forming a
punctate circle. The “spokes” themselves—
numbering 17—result from an equal number of
holes or cut-away portions just inside the second

15

circle. Between the second and the remains of a
third concentric circle are “spokes” with somewhat
larger bases. Instead of merely a dot in the center
of each spoke-base, there is an incised diamond, or
lozenge-shaped, design, with the dot in its center.
These diamonds are placed end to end, thus forming
a circle or chain. This is suggestive of a painted
diamond-back rattlesnake design on a bottle,
pictured by Moore 9, from Cunningham place,
Poinsett County, Arkansas. The diamond with a dot
in its center is also found on East Texas pottery.10
Originally this Texas gorget must have been a
perfect example of symmetry.
A fragment of a gorget, beneath the chin of
skeleton No. 3 in burial B-5, contained an unusual
design in the center of which appears an eye. At
the outer edge was a band of five engraved
concentric circles. Adjoining the band of lines was
what appeared to be a webbed foot. Since a part of
the gorget was missing, one cannot be sure what
type of bird or conventionalized animal this may
have been. Next to the broken edge, and not far
from the center of the ornament, was a so-called
eye. It consisted of two small concentric circles—
the pupil—surrounded by an elliptical element,
representing the outline of the eye.
With a single skeleton in burial B-8 were two
gorgets. One rested above the other, on the right
jaw. The upper one was 4 ½ inches in diameter and
without decoration. The other, 3 1/8 inches in
diameter, was badly decayed but bore the remains
of a scalloped edge and an engraved design. The
design is not legible.
In burial B-19, disturbed by the plow, were two
fragmentary gorgets. They bore scalloped edges but
had no other decoration.
On the chest of the lone occupant of grave B-l
were two gorgets, one beside the other. One was
undecorated; the other, with a diameter of 4 inches,
bears no carved design but a circular hole 1 11/16
inch in diameter was cut in the center.
In a grave on the Jess Alford plantation, on a
former channel of South Sulphur River, Hopkins
County, a conch shell gorget was found. It measured
4 ¼” x 4” x 3/16” and was in an excellent state of

preservation. It bears no carved design,
the sole decoration being a circular hole,
¾ inch in diameter, in its center. The edge
of the hole has been beveled and highly
polished. The differences between this
gorget and the above described one are
a better state of preservation and a
smaller central hole.
From a burial in the Caplen Mound,
Galveston County, came a well preserved
conch shell gorget. The diameter is 4 ½
inches. An attempt at punctate decoration
consists of 23 lightly gouged dots,
arranged without apparent design, near
the four suspension perforations. Four
holes in this gorget, instead of two, is
unusual. Two of them are 1/8 inch in
diameter, with the two alternate ones 3/
16 inch. The small holes are ¾ inch apart,
the large ones, one inch. All are 3/16 inch
from the edge of the shell.
Another specimen from the Caplen
Mound is of the gorget type, although
slightly elliptical and bearing only one
hole for suspension. The ornament is 2
¼” x 2 ¾” x 1/8” and without decoration.
No sets of three engraved shell
ornaments—“one elongated triangular
pendant going together with two
discoidal ones,” presumably a “breastornament” and two “ear discs”—such as
reported from Mexico by Beyer11, have
been found in East Texas. No gorget-like,
engraved shell discs without suspension
holes have been discovered in this region.

Stone plaques are rare in East Texas. Fewer are
found there than in the upper levels of the burntrock mounds of Central Texas. Specimens of this
type are variously classed as stone plaques, pierced
tablets, and two-hole “shuttle gorgets.”
An outstanding find in this class is from the W.
J. Dorsett farm, Wood County. This plaque, with
dimensions of 3 5/16” x 2 ¼” x 5/16”, was picked
up on the surface of a campsite. It is made of iron
clay-stone or limonite, and bears two perforations,
one near each end. The holes are 3/16 to 5/16 inch
outer diameter; drilled from both sides, meeting at
the center. The reverse side of the specimen presents
a flat surface; the obverse side is convex, the
thickness decreasing gradually from the center
toward the ends. The natural coloration, with its
ringed or banded effect, forms the sole decoration.

17

One of the earthenware plugs is like a spool with
an end cut off. The disc-end is one inch in diameter
and 1/8 inch thick. The cylindrical portion, which
bears near its outer end a perforation 1/10 inch in
diameter, is 5/8 inch long and ½ inch in diameter.
The total length is 7/8 inch. The specimen is made
of yellow clay; rudely shaped and unpolished, except
on the large end. It came from a midden deposit on
the Earl Jones farm, Wood County; and is the only
plug with a single enlarged end and the stem
perforated.

Two specimens of the same shape, from a mound
on the Rose place, Cross County, Arkansas, are
reported by Moore12, who makes the following
statement regarding the find: “Burial No. 43, a child,

THE PLACE OF TEXAS IN PRE-COLUMBIAN RELATIONSHIPS
BETWEEN THE UNITED STATES AND MEXICO
BY DR. J. ALDEN MASON
The question of pre-Columbian influences in the
United States, and especially in the mound region
of the southern and southeastern states, has always
attracted considerable attention. Possibly no
problem of American archeology, except that of the
origin of the American Indian himself, has
occasioned so much loose thinking, jumping at
conclusions on the basis of superficial resemblances,
and disregard of temporal elements. It is time that
more sound logical thinking were brought to bear
upon this interesting and important problem. Some
little has been done, on minor phases, but the
question needs a thoroughgoing analysis, preferably
by a number of experts in different fields. It is not
my intention to attempt this at present, even were I
qualified to do so, for want of space for such an
extended disquisition, but rather to point out the
key position that Texas holds in the solution of the
problem, in the hope that an exposition of its status
to date will awaken interest in the question and lead
to further information and investigation that will
aid in its elucidation.
There are three possible routes by which
Mexican influences could have reached the southern
states: via Yucatan, Cuba and Florida; along the
Gulf coast of Mexico and Texas; and indirectly up
the Mexican Cordillera to the Pueblo region and
then from there eastward.
The Antillean route may be disposed of quickly.
That there are Antillean influences in the
southeastern states is generally admitted. Miss
Gower1 regards them as “too great to be purely
fortuitous” and considers them as due to “a series
of not extremely intimate contacts occurring at
intervals during a long period of time,” together
with “the existence of a common primitive culture.”
But, despite the relatively short distance separating
Yucatan from Cuba, there is no evidence that it was
ever traversed in pre-Columbian days. Antillean and
mainland cultures differed widely; I know of no
object ever found that would indicate pre-

Columbian migration or trade between these
regions, and agree with Miss Gower’s conclusion
that “So far there are no satisfactory indications of
Central American influence on the culture of the
Antilles.”
Both of the other possible routes traverse the
state of Texas.
The only feasible route by which immigration
and cultural influences may have passed from the
Pueblo region to the Mississippi Valley is by the
drainage of the Arkansas River, especially along its
southern tributary, the Canadian. The sources of
these rivers lie in New Mexico, close to the
easternmost Pueblos, such as Taos. This area has
been especially studied by Moorehead2 who has
incorporated in his conclusions some of the work
of Holden, Studer and other investigators in this
region. Holden and Studer have also published in
this Bulletin the results of some later researches.
It is certain that the Canadian River was used as
a highway for bison-hunting bands of the Pueblo
Indians. Potsherds of typical Pecos wares were, for
instance, found just south of Amarillo in the Texas
Panhandle by the expedition from the University
Museum in 1929. On the upper reaches of the
Canadian, such as at Watrous on the Mora, typical
Pueblo, probably Pueblo III, ruins are found.
On the lower Arkansas River, in the state of
Arkansas and in eastern Texas, domiciliary and
mortuary mounds exist in which are found very well
made pottery vessels, with smooth, plain, painted
or incised surfaces. They show no connection with
Pueblo wares, or with Pueblo culture in any respect,
and not much more with eastern Mound ceramics.
These remains are ascribed to the ancestors of the
Caddoans.
It might be expected that in the intervening
region an intermediate type would be found, but
this seems to be not the case. Instead, in the Texas
Panhandle region, we find a culture different from

either and exceedingly difficult to classify,
apparently a separate culture. In architecture its
connections are much closer with the Pueblo region,
for rooms are found with mud walls and floors,
semi-subterranean, with wattle-and-mud roofs
supported on poles, and walled with large stones
which are, however, generally placed vertically
instead of in horizontal masonry as typical in Mexico
and the Pueblo region. Artifacts and potsherds are
few, but the latter differ from both Pueblo and
Mississippi types, being rude and undecorated
except for a rough surface as if made by corn-cobs
or similar methods. It is Plains rather than either
Pueblo or Mississippi Valley in type. Except for the
superficial resemblance to Pueblo culture in
architecture, this Texas Panhandle culture has
practically nothing in common with Mexico. Its
temporal relationships with the adjacent cultures
are still uncertain but Kidder considers it as
relatively late. It could, therefore, hardly have
served as the medium through which elements of
Pueblo culture passed to the Mississippi Valley. At
the time of discovery, this region was inhabited by
Plains tribes of apparently different culture; Kiowa,
Comanche, Osage, Kansas, and Caddo, and there
is no evidence that any other people, ancient or
modern, could have served as carriers of Pueblo
culture eastward.
Furthermore, this question is a more or less
academic one, since Mexican influence in the Pueblo
region seems to be nowhere near so great as it
appears at first. At first blush, intimate relationships
seem to be obvious, but the more closely the details
are examined, the less certain this connection
becomes. The archeology of the Southwest is now
better known than that of any other region in
America, with all its sequences and temporal
relationships; that of Mexico, especially of the
Archaic Culture of the Valley of Mexico, is
becoming well known, but the region between,
stretching for nearly a thousand miles from the
Tarascan region to the Arizona border, is only
superficially known and this important region must
be carefully investigated by archeologists before the
question of Mexican-Puebloan relationships can be
solved.3

23

Apparently an unbroken chain of archeological
remains continues through the Sierra Madre of
Western Mexico from Jalisco to Utah, with cliffdwellings and other masonry constructions of
Southwestern type. Many elements of religion and
of material culture are common to the sedentary
Pueblo region, the semi-nomadic agricultural
peoples of the Southwest such as the Piman groups,
and the peoples of northern Mexico. Among these
may be mentioned the method of preparing corn
by grinding on the metate and toasting corn-cakes,
a developed priesthood with use of prayer-sticks,
and standardized prayers and ritual. The linguistic
connections are also close and certain. Moreover
trade relations were certainly maintained, at least
in later times, throughout this region. Bronze bells
of the type characteristic of the Tarascan region,
and mirrors of pyrite mosaic identical with those
characteristic of the Old Maya Empire, have been
found in Arizona, and the earliest travelers in the
Southwest, such as Cabeza de Vaca and Fray
Marcos de Niza, found trade, for instance in
turquoise and parrot feathers, and mutual
knowledge of distant regions, general on the
Mexican-United States border.
It would seem obvious, then that in this region
at least, Mexican influence would be constant and
strong. But the best authorities on Southwestern
archeology, as a result of careful comparisons and
studies, see little evidence of Mexican influence in
Pueblo material culture on any late horizon. The
resemblance between Pueblo and Aztec is extremely
slight indeed, that with the earliest known Mexican
culture, the Archaic of the Valley of Mexico, hardly
any greater, at least as far as ceramics are concerned,
almost the sole criterion that we possess for this
Archaic Culture. It would seem probable that most
of such resemblances and common elements of
material culture and religion that we find are
inheritances from a common elemental culture
which obtained from the Pueblo region to southern
Mexico and which is probably best exemplified
today by the primitive peoples of northern Mexico
such as the Tarahumare, and that upon this were
built up, independently and with very slight
interchange of influences, the higher cultures of

Texas Archeological and Paleontological Society
Careful search in the neighborhood of
Brownsville has, in the last thirteen years, resulted
in the discovery of the broken fragments of five
pottery vessels. In every case the majority of the
vessel was found and the shape and type of
decoration were evident; most of them have been
restored. Each was found in a separate locality but
within a radius of fifty miles of Brownsville, four
of them within five miles of each other. At least
two were found in connection with interments, and
probably all were funerary in purpose. Ornaments
of shell were found with two of them.
Four of these vessels are ollas of considerable
size, fourteen to fifteen inches in height and ten to
fourteen inches in diameter; the fifth is a bowl. The
ollas are of three different shapes, one of them very
unusual and differing markedly from the other two.
The ware is of a very high grade, hard baked
and thin. It is nowhere over three-eighths of an inch
in thickness, averaging less than one-quarter inch,
and much of one of the largest ollas is only oneeighth of an inch in thickness. The paste is fine and
of a cream-buff color. One is painted entirely with
bright red on the exterior; the two ollas of similar
shape are dichrome, painted in red and sepia designs
on the cream ware; and the olla with handles and
the bowl are painted with designs in sepia.
Mr. A. E. Anderson in his article on “The
Artifacts of the Rio Grande Delta Region,” this
Bulletin, Volume four, September, 1932, pages 29
to 31, distinguishes five types of potsherds in this
region:
1. Grey colored, thin, decorated with asphalt
lines and coated with asphalt internally.
2. Buff colored, thin, not decorated, fire
blackened.

25

Probably not all of these types are intrinsically
different. Decorated and undecorated portions of
the same vessel may be included in different classes,
and frequently, due to uneven baking, the nature of
the ware and color of the same vessel may differ in
different parts. The five vessels apparently might
belong to one or several of the first four types.
The forms and decorations of these five vessels
are shown on plate 6. Outlines of only four of them
are shown since two are of practically the same
shape and size, that shown in Figure 22.
The olla shown in Figure 21 is about fourteen
inches in height and ten inches in maximum
diameter. The shape is unusual with base very
convex. The two vertical loop handles are eccentric
and asymmetrical, as if a third one were intended
and never placed. The ware is a creamy buff, slightly
reddish in places, and not coated with asphalt on
the inside. The painted designs in sepia are very
much eroded, but seem to be as indicated in Figure
23. There are two zones, one on the neck and one
on the body, the horizontal lines being at the junction
of body and neck. The designs are mainly
curvilinear, and if at all pictorial are
conventionalized beyond identification.
Figure 22 shows the shape of two ollas of similar
size, about fourteen inches in height and maximum
diameter. The bases are concave and the rims not
everted. The paste is light cream color, well kneaded
and evenly kilned, and very thin considering the
size of the vessel, some parts being only one-eighth
of an inch in thickness, and nowhere over threeeighths of an inch. The base and the lobe were made
first, the neck being then made and built on with a
lap-joint.

The decorations of these two ollas are similar in
plan, though differing considerably in detail. Both

alternate in pairs; in Figure 25 they alternate singly.
The neck above the decorative zones is painted a

in different proportions.

Pottery vessels of the shape of those from the
region of Brownsville are not common, if known,
in Huaxtec archeological collections. But it must
be admitted that collections from this area are few
and small, and that vessels of the size of those from
Brownsville would rarely be preserved intact and
enter into collections. They must have served as
utilitarian water-containers and consequently not
have been so ornately decorated and desirable to
pot-hunters as the smaller mortuary vessels that
form the greater part of most archeological
collections. Prieto mentions and figures (Plate 2,
Figure 1, opposite page 20) an olla of the general
shape of these, which he found in his excavations
in Sierra la Palma in the Huaxtec region. It is,
however, more elongated; Prieto gives the
dimensions as 50 centimeters in height and 15 in
maximum diameter, about 20 by 6 inches; this would
make it taller and narrower than any of the
Brownsville vessels. If the proportions given in the
drawing of it are correct, however, and the height
given correctly, the diameter would be about nine
and one-half inches. It resembles one of the
Brownsville ollas in having two vertical loop
handles on one side.
Smaller vessels of the general shape of the
Brownsville ollas are known in Huaxtec
archeological collections, generally more squat,
with the diameter exceeding the height, and it is
probable that the ancient Huaxtecs made vessels
very similar to the Brownsville ones. In Figure 36
on plate 6 is shown one of these squat ollas, though
this was selected for decoration rather than for
shape; others resemble slightly more the
Brownsville vessels. This Figure, as well as the
Huaxtec decorations in Figures 30 and 31 were
copied from the most important article upon
Huaxtecan archeology, “Die Huaxteca-Sammlung
des Kgl. Museums fur Volkerkunde,” by Caecilie
Seler, Baessler Archiv, V, 1916, pp. 98-136.

is a yellowish-gray or cream-colored ware with
brown patterns; this is made at the Aztec town of
Huejutla in the State of Hidalgo. The other ware is
made into similar ollas, but is coarser, red in color,
and with white decoration; it is made at Panuco.
Both these wares are unglazed.” The shapes of these
vessels, copied from the above publication, are
shown in Figures 32 to 36; the decoration from
Figure 32 is shown as Figure 29. These vessels are
now in Field Museum, Chicago, and their paste and
pigments suggest that the modern potters are
carrying on the ancient Huaxtec pottery traditions,
presumably also in shapes. As an interesting side
light, Dr. Starr remarks that these “in form and
decoration more nearly resemble the wares of the
Pueblos of New Mexico and Arizona than any other
Mexican pottery we have seen.” The modern vessel
in. Figure 34 resembles closely the Brownsville olla
in Figure 28 in shape; both of these are of red ware
or slip. The loop handles of the modern vessel in
Figure 35 are almost identical with those of the
Brownsville olla in Figure 21, but set in a different
plane.

As regards decoration, the resemblance between
the ancient Huaxtec, modern Huaxtec, and
Brownsville vessels is superficially obvious but
evanescent. Much of this is probably due to the
pigment and ware. Some ancient Huaxtec ceramic
decoration is geometrical, but most of it is extremely
stylized naturalistic, conventionalized almost
beyond the point of recognition. Typical decorations
are shown in Figures 30, 31 and 36 on plate 6.
Occasional animal figures are but slightly
conventionalized, as in Figure 36. The same remarks
apply to modern Huaxtec ceramics and to the
Brownsville vessels, though in detail the three types
are unmistakably different. Floral designs, certainly
a post-Spanish introduction, have crept into the
modern Tampico pottery. Among the elements

Texas Archeological and Paleontological Society
As a result of our comparisons we may probably
conclude with reasonable confidence that the
Brownsville vessels were not made by Huaxtecs as
was certainly the vessel from San Fernando not far
to the south, but show Huaxtec influence to a
moderate degree. As no objects of European culture
were found with them they were probably
contemporary with pre-Cortesian Huaxtec ceramics
and, being of a relatively high degree of ceramic
technique, were probably made by a people above
the cultural level of the miserable hunting tribes
living there within the last few centuries. It is
possible, however, that these specimens antedate
the classic Huaxtec period. If they date from about
the time of the Conquest, they were presumably
made by one of the Coahuiltecan tribes; if much
older, their affiliations will be in doubt until much
farther work is done in this region.
Coming farther north to Rockport, about one
hundred and fifty miles north of Brownsville, Mr.
George C. Martin and several colleagues have in
recent years studied the archeology of the coastal
region and have found evidence of a culture rather
higher than, and different from, that found farther
inland. In the central part of Texas the archeological
ruins consist mainly of “burnt-rock mounds” which
were probably remains of cooking hearths and
which contain flint objects but no pottery, or pottery
of a crude Plains type. In the coastal sites the rock
mounds seem to be unknown, but in the sand dunes
are found fragments of pottery of a much higher
type.
The pottery of the Rockport region has been
described in several articles in this Bulletin: “Notes
on some Texas Coast Camp-sites and Other
Remains,” by George C. Martin, Volume 1, pages
55, 56, 1929; “Ornamentation on the Pottery of
the Texas Coastal Tribes,” by Wendall H. Potter,
Volume 2, pages 41-44, 1930; “Texas Coastal
Pottery” by George C. Martin, Volume 3, pages
53-56, 1931. These three articles afford a
considerable body of data on the ceramics of the
Corpus Christi-Rockport region.
Potter groups the ceramics into three types: a
coarse, heavy cooking ware, a lighter cooking ware,

29

and a thin liquid-containing ware. The first two
groups are undecorated and not coated with asphalt.
The shell tempering used in the first type is obvious
but not so evident in the second type. Shell
tempering is undetectable with the unaided eye in
the third class of ware, and a microscopic
examination would be required to determine the
nature of the tempering. It may be very finely
pulverized shell; if of another material it might
indicate that this ware belongs to a different culture
from the cooking ware. At any rate the first two
classes are so lacking in characteristics, in the
absence of complete or restorable vessels, as to be
of no present value for comparative purposes.
The vessels of the third class are of extremely
thin ware, from two to four millimeters in thickness.
Potter mentions one of a thickness of one and onehalf millimeters. The vessels could not have been
large; Martin estimates them as from three to ten
and one-half inches in diameter. Probably bowls and
small ollas of simple shapes were typical, but not
enough of any vessel has been found to restore it.
The ware is light in color, generally a pinkish cream.
They are often coated with asphalt, generally inside,
occasionally also outside. In addition there are
simple decorations on the exterior, apparently also
in asphalt. Wavy lines and dots comprise the typical
decorations. Some sherds are decorated with
incised lines, and the rims of some are notched or
scalloped.
Comparing these ceramics with those from the
Huaxtec region and from Brownsville it will be seen,
as expected, that they bear even less resemblance
to Huaxtec than do the Brownsville vessels. The
additional untypically Huaxtec characteristics of
incised decoration and notched rims are introduced.
The former is found in Huaxtec ceramics but is not
characteristic: decorated rims are unknown and unMexican. The vessels are smaller; the shapes, so
far as we can determine, are different, as are the
designs. But the Huaxtecan characteristics of fine,
thin creamy ware decorated in black pigment
derived from asphalt remain, and we are probably
justified in deciding that they indicate Huaxtec
influences this far north and east.

The identity of the manufacturers of this fine
grade of Texas Coast pottery is far from certain. In
historic times this region was occupied by the
Karankawan tribes, a non-agricultural people of low
culture. Reports credit them with having
manufactured only a poor grade of pottery or
cooking vessels, and the identification of the makers
of this fine pottery with the Karankawan seems
incredible. Gatschet6, almost our only authority
upon the Karankawa, reports “Asphaltum was often
washed ashore and used by the Indians for black
paint, after mixing it with oil (p. 54). They prepared
but one kind of pottery from clay, the vases having
a globular bottom so that they had to be placed in a
hole in the sand. They had no handles and measured
in diameter about twelve inches. Mrs. Oliver
observed their manufacture but once; then it was a
man who made some pots and ornamented them
on the outside with little designs, faces, scrolls,
scallops, etc., in black paint” (p. 59).
The probable explanation has lately been given
me in correspondence from George C. Martin of
Rockport. According to his latest researches,
Karankawan sites can be distinguished from
Coahuiltecan, though in certain regions sites of the
two tribes are found in the same localities. Little
pottery is found in the distinctly Karankawan
territory of Matagorda and San Antonio Bays.
Much more is found in the region of Copano,
Aransas, Corpus Christi, and Nueces Bays, territory
which was occupied by both tribes, and south of
the Nueces pottery is most plentiful on land
occupied only by Coahuiltecan and Lipan tribes.
However, such sherds as are found in the Matagorda
Bay region are identical with those found south of
the Nueces. We can hardly hesitate, therefore, in
assigning the fine pottery of the Texas Coast to the
tribes of the Coahuiltecan or Pakawan group whose
territory extended for an uncertain distance south
of the Rio Grande into Tamaulipas. That they had
more or less intimate contacts and trade relations
with the Huaxtec is quite probable. Between the
two, however, tribes of the Tamaulipecan group
apparently intervened. These have long been extinct
and almost nothing is known of them. The
Coahuiltecans also probably became extinct about
fifty years ago.7

The geographical and temporal relations of the
Coahuiltecan and Karankawan tribes are uncertain,
but the evidence of the pottery indicates that the
Coahuiltecans at one time ranged as far northeast
as Matagorda Bay. Mr. Martin believes, on
stratigraphic evidence, that the Karankawans were
the earlier population, later partially displaced by
infiltration of Coahuiltecan peoples. At any rate,
apparently through the medium of the
Coahuiltecans, we have traced Mexican, and
specifically Huaxtec, influences to this point on the
Texas coast.
Between Rockport and the Mound region of
Louisiana the coast region seems to be
archeologically almost unknown8 and there are no
reports of any evidences of higher culture. Mr. H.
E. Elrod of Houston, whom I visited in 1932, knows
of no sites of any importance on the coast east of
Rockport. This is disappointing, but we should
remember that it was not until very recently that
anything was archeologically known of the Gulf
coast north of Tampico. If discoveries of pottery

Texas Coast, it would extend the area of proved
Mexican influence that much farther toward the
Mississippi River. Having set in evidence the data
suggesting that certain Mexican, and specifically
Huaxtec, elements are found on the Texas Coast at
least as far north as Rockport, it would be pertinent
now to inquire whither these traces point, and in
what region are found the greatest number of
apparent Mexican elements and resemblances.
Without going into the question in detail, I may say
that most of the apparent Mexican traits in the
mound region of the southeastern states and the
Mississippi Valley appear, on careful examination,
to be superficial or non-existent. There are certain
resemblances that point to a cultural connection
on a very ancient horizon, certain traits that may at
one time have been common to the entire MexicanMississippi area, and other resemblances in art so
close, and with such complexes, combinations and
associations of elements as to suggest the influence
of trade or the migration of a small band on a very

unavoidable hypothesis. There would seem
therefore to be a continuous connective line from
Central American through Maya, Huaxtec and the
Texas Coast to the Caddoan region. This awaits
further investigation, but it is probable that we are
dealing with several different temporal and cultural
horizons. The resemblances between Mayan and
Caddoan are mainly in pottery shapes, though also
to some extent in pottery decoration. This
decoration is, however, very different from that of
the Huaxtec and the Texas Coast. The buff ware of
the Huaxtecs, painted with black and with asphalt
in curvilinear designs, is characteristic of the
Huaxtec alone and not of the Mayan peoples in
general. On the other hand the ware of the Texas
Coast shows little resemblance to that of the
Caddoans. But the fact that we have strongly
indicated that the influence of the Huaxtec, a people
linguistically Mayan, extended far up the Texas
Coast to peoples in contact with the Caddoans
makes the larger extension of influence from the
typical southern Maya to the Caddoans themselves
highly probable. It is likely that we are here dealing
with two temporal horizons, an earlier one in which
generalized Mayan elements extended to the
Caddoans, and a later one in which specifically
Huaxtec elements spread to the Coahuiltecans of
the Texas Coast.
For more definite conclusions on this important
problem we need farther careful investigations of
the Mexican and Texas Gulf Coast, especially east
of Rockport and south of Brownsville, far more
archeological and ethnological knowledge of
northern Mexico, more comparisons such as the
recent work of Vaillant, especially that between the
archeology of the Caddoan mounds and the protoMaya, particularly that of the Guatemalan
highlands, and certain specific studies of
fundamental elements of Mexican, Puebloan and
Mound cultures, such as the extent of the metate

ARCHEOLOGY OF A SECTION OF UPPER RED RIVER DRAINAGE
BY ADOLPH HENRY WITTE
The following article will describe artifacts found
in Indian camp sites situated within a radius of fifty
miles of Henrietta, Texas. The region is mostly
prairie which is in places broken by low rolling hills
and wide river valleys. Big Wichita River, Little
Wichita River, and their tributaries are the main
streams. Both rivers empty into Red River, and
campsites along that stream were investigated. The
surface geological formation is typical Permian,
with red clays, blue shales, gray sandstone outcrops
and sparse beds of water-worn pebbles and
boulders. There are many sand dunes. No deposits
of flint are known locally, but silicified wood,
quartzite and fine granular conglomerate are
plentiful.

margins of depressions that once were lakes, and
along dry branches.
A majority of all known campsites are in the
valleys on elevations above the high water mark.
These elevations occasionally are sand dunes which
are highly retentive of moisture, and no better soils
could have been found for agricultural use.
Successive tribes, coming into this locality always
occupied the same sites. The artifacts found on one
of these spots often range from thick paleolithic
axes and leaf shaped points to tiny pressure flaked
arrowheads of the finest technique.

Ninety-five per cent of the small points, awls,
and scrapers are made of imported materials, mostly
of fine flint. The local deposits did not provide a
suitable stone. Certain patterns are always
patinated. Pigmy tools are plentiful at the few sites
containing pottery. Of the dozen or more patterns
found, some are quite small. These must have been
used as dart heads for the blow-gun, as Dr. Ray
has suggested. Some groups received an
unnecessary amount of flaking. Was this extra effort
expended upon thin small flakes in order to further
lighten them and make possible their use in the blow
gun? One triangular shaped type has no notches,
and on another, although it is shouldered, the tang
tapers. The shaft would become detached, instantly,
once these became embedded in wounds.
Awls
Awls are from ¼” to 3” in length, oval, round,
or rhomboidal in section. The base as a rule is a
thin flake, sometimes sharpened into a knife. There
are several types. Projectile points reworked into
awls are not uncommon.
Copper Ore
A few small pieces of copper ore have been
found at some of the pottery sites. Local deposits
of this mineral are common.
Obsidian
Part of one medium sized projectile point of this
uncommon mineral and a few unworked flakes
came from a sand dune site.

Quartz Chips
Clear quartz flakes are found on many sites.
Occasionally the small pebbles from which the chips
were removed are found. None of these show that
any attempt to fashion them into tools has been
made and no artifacts of this particular mineral are
known locally. Ceremonial use is the probable
explanation. Quartz crystals play an important part
in certain phases of the ceremonial life of the modern
Pueblos. The crystal is used by the medicine men
at Acoma. (L. A. White).2 Fewkes mentions their
use among the Hopi.3 Frank H. H. Roberts Jr. found
quartz crystals in early pueblo mortuary bowls in
Southwestern Colorado. (Bureau of American
Ethnology, Bulletin 96). John P. Herrington found
these crystals in excavations on the Burton Mound,
and describes methods of attaching quartz crystals
to wands and pendants. (44th Annual Report of
Bureau of American Ethnology, pp. 92, 93).
Hematite Objects
Nodules of red hematite, the size of a man’s
thumb or smaller are found locally. Lumps of
hematite have been picked up on many campsites
with one or more sides ground off. Only one nodule
showed attempts at flaking. There seems to be an
absence of chipped artifacts of this material. A site
near Denton, Texas, furnished a large chipped gouge
of hematite. Gouges from East Texas are often of
this mineral. A small celt, beautifully polished, was
found locally, also part of another, (the cutting edge
only).

REPORT ON POTTERY SHERDS FROM NEAR ABILENE, TEXAS
BY JAMES B. GRIFFIN
The material discussed in this report was
obtained from thirteen sites near Abilene, Texas.
The pottery has been described according to the
type of tempering material, texture of the paste and
aplastic, surface hardness and finish, color, and the
rim and lip shape where present. Only one site had
any significant amount of decoration. An interesting
feature of the report is the identification of the white
aplastic so common in many of the sherds, by Mr.
Frederick R. Matson. Each site is considered
separately. The total number of the sherds is listed,
and a distinction made between those donated to
the Ceramic Repository and those to be returned.

The tempering material appears to be very fine
grit, which may have been inclusive in the clay from
which the pottery was made. The texture is fine
and the hardness1 is between 2-2.5. All of the sherds
can be scratched on the outer surface by the finger
nail. The paste is black. Both surfaces of all sherds
are smoke discolored. There appears to be charred

The interior surfaces have been smoothed, and

sherd has medium wide (.4 cm.), rather shallow,
incised lines which are about 1. cm. apart.
The lip on two of the sherds is rounded and
slightly narrower than the rim. On one, the rim
appears to be straight until just below the lip, where
it is slightly everted. The incomplete rim section on
the second sherd appears to be straight. The two
lips are .5 to .6 cm. thick, while the base of the two
rims is .7 to .8 cm. thick.

The first impression of these sherds is that all
are very similar. While it is improbable that they
are from the same vessel, they almost certainly
represent the same type of container. The tempering
material is very small and is white. (See Mr.
Matson’s report). From experiments made in the
Ceramic Repository, I should estimate that the
proportion of aplastic to clay would be 1 to 3. The
texture is fine and compact. All of the sherds can
be scratched by the finger nail. The color of the
paste is bluish gray, while the exterior surface has
turned a light tan due to oxidation during firing.

The exterior surface finish is smooth with little
evidence of the type of implement used. The interior
surface also shows smoothing but not to such an
extent as on the exterior. Narrow, horizontal
striations made by a smoothing implement, perhaps
a pebble, are visible on some of the sherds. There
is no decoration on any of the sherds, and there are

Three of the sherds in the Ceramic Repository
group are tempered with a fine grit. One has a
hardness of 2-2.5, and the other two have a hardness
of 2.5. The texture is fine. The texture of the one
fair-sized sherd in the collection (to be returned) is
very fine. The tempering material for this sherd has
not been determined, and it is probable that none
was used. It is a portion of a small “child’s” bowl.
The rest of the sherds contain as aplastic material
the Calcium Phosphate substance discussed by Mr.
Matson. The exterior surface of these sherds show
tiny holes caused by the weathering of the tempering
material. Both the exterior and interior surfaces are
smoothed, and again the exterior received the most
attention. None of the sherds are decorated. Sherd
68, referred to above, has a pronounced shoulder,
a short contracting rim, and the lip is narrowed
almost to a point. The pot was probably not more
than 4 cm. high, yet it has a body thickness of 1 cm.
The hardness of the sherds containing white aplastic
is 2-2.5, except for one sherd which is 2.5.

The sherds from this site can be considered two
different types. The first group is grit-tempered,
and contains 14 sherds. Of these, seven have a
hardness of 2-2.5; five have a hardness of 2.5; one
is 3, and one is 3.5. The surface finish is smoothed,
and the texture is predominantly medium fine,
although four of the sherds have a fine texture.
Three have straight rim sections. Two of the lips
are rounded, while the third is flattened. The color
is grayish black, or grayish tan, and is distinctly
darker than the second group.

The tempering material consists of very fine
particles of grit and the white Calcium Phosphate.
The texture is fine. The hardness of the sherds is
2.5. The exterior and interior surface colors are
various shades of grayish tan. The paste is
sometimes a light bluish gray, but most often it
approaches the color of the surface. Both the
exterior and interior surfaces are smoothed, with
the exterior showing the most careful treatment.

The other group of sherds frequently has as its
aplastic the tampering material discussed by Mr.
Matson, but two of the sherds have what I believe
is crushed shell. Two of the group have a hardness
of 2., one has a hardness of 2.5, while the rest are
2-2.5. This group, then, is softer than the first. All
these sherds have a fine texture. The surface finish
is smoothed, and the predominating colors are tan
and brownish tan.
The two groups are quite distinct as far as can
be ascertained from the material at hand.

As may be seen by examining the chart, the
tempering material at this site is largely a Calcium
Phosphate material. Nine sherds are grit-tempered.
About half the sherds have a hardness of 2-2.5; two
have a hardness of 3; one is 3.5, and the remainder
are 2.5. The surface color ranges from a light red
through light tan and browns, to dark grays and

SITE 8
This is the only site that furnishes pottery
containing cultural determinates beyond the bare
pottery skeleton of paste, temper, and surface finish.
The tempering material is predominantly grit, the
texture is 75 per cent medium fine, with the
remainder of the sherds having a fine texture. This
site furnishes the highest degree of hardness in
sherds in the collection, as shown on the
accompanying chart. Almost a third of the sherds
have a hardness of 4. The surface finish is striated
or roughened, as a rule, and the color is grayish
brown and gray. The thickest sherds also come from
this site, most of them being .5 to 1 cm. thick.
The sherds are so small that unfortunately no
adequate idea of any designs can be obtained. The
technique of decoration is incising. One sherd has
two intersecting diagonal lines, .25 cm. wide and
medium deep, which were apparently made with a
rounded point. Another sherd has three shallow,
incised chevrons, .2 cm. wide. Sherd No. 13 has a
series of small, slightly curvilinear incisions rather
closely spaced, which may have been made with
the finger nail. The other decorated sherds are listed
and described in the chart for the site.
In addition to the collections from the foregoing
sites, the following sherds, which are to be returned,
were examined.

The aplastic in this sherd consists of small white
Calcium Phosphate particles. The texture is fine,
and the hardness is 2-2.5. Both surfaces are
smoothed, and are tannish in color. The paste is a
bluish gray. The sherd is .6 cm. thick.
SITE 11
The tempering material is the same as in the
preceding sherd, and the texture and hardness also
correspond. The surface finish is smoothed on both
the exterior and interior, particularly so on the
former. The surface coloration is a slightly grayish
tan, while the paste is grayish blue. The thickness
is .35 cm.
SITE 10
The tempering material of these two sherds is
grit; the texture is medium fine; and the hardness
2.5. The surface color appears to be brown, but
both sherds are blackened from firing or cooking.
They have a roughened exterior surface, one having
narrow striations. The interiors are smoothed. Sherd
No. 53 is 1.1 cm. thick, and No. 54 is .7 cm. thick.
It would be difficult to arrive at any accurate
conclusions regarding cultural relationships on the
basis of the pottery represented in this collection.
The sherds are few and small, and there is little
comparative material of a similar nature in the

Ceramic Repository. For that reason, only tentative
relations between the sites represented can be
suggested at this time. The sites from which there

characterized by the presence of Calcium Phosphate

IDENTIFICATION OF APLASTIC PRESENT
IN POTTERY SHERDS FROM TEXAS
BY FREDERICK R. MATSON
The white tempering material appearing in the
sherds is not limestone. Qualitative chemical tests
show that it contains Calcium and the Phosphate
radical, indicating that it is a Calcium Phosphate.
The optical properties of the aplastic closely
resemble those of the mineral Collophanite
(3 Ca3(PO4)2 .n Ca(CO3). x H 2O) which is an
amorphous material. Collophanite is usually found
in beds of coral limestones which have been covered
by beds of guano. The action of the ground waters
has carried Phosphates from the guano beds down
into the limestones. Collophanite may often show
the organic structure of bones, mollusks,
brachiopods, corals, etc.
Collophanite occurs in sedimentary phosphatic
limestones, in phosphorites or so-called phosphate
rocks as the chief constituent, and in phosphate
nodules. It is the dominant material in fossil bone,
in which the microstructure of the original bone is
usually preserved. Such microstructure was noted
on a few fragments of the aplastic.

to the Indians of Texas. The clay used contains quite
a little Calcite, which would indicate that there were
sedimentary calcareous deposits in the region in
which this pottery was made. Some of the aplastic
may quite possibly be predominantly Calcite instead
of Calcium Phosphate, as indicated by effervescence
upon the addition of Hydrochloric acid.
I do not believe that bone was purposely calcined
and then added to the clay as an aplastic, for two
reasons:
1. The optical properties of bone are somewhat
different from those of the aplastic, which more
closely resembles Collophanite.
2. When bone is heated in a crucible by means
of a Meeker burner, it turns black due to the
presence of carbon, and remains black or gray even
when fired to a red heat for some time. As the
carbon gradually burns out, the bone turns gray,
and eventually white.

The aplastic is uniformly white in color. The

THE POTTERY COMPLEX ARTIFACTS OF THE ABILENE REGION
BY CYRUS N. RAY
Pottery is not abundant in the Abilene region,
and it has only been found thus far in relatively few
sites. The writer’s collection contains sherds from
all but three, of the twenty pottery sites listed, and
in two of the latter sites only one sherd was found
in each by an associate while both were examining
the sites. Several other pottery sites have been
reported but in the absence of personal examination
they will not be listed.
There is no doubt that many more sites
containing pottery exist than have yet been found
because of the fact that most of the local pottery
sherds are of nearly a soil color, and are very small
in size. It therefore takes both sharp vision and
trained eyes to see them even where sherds are
known to exist. Only one known instance of the
finding of a complete pot occurred sixty miles
northwest of Abilene where a small pottery cup was
found in Site No. 12. Most of the sherds found are
only from one to two inches in diameter.
Samples of all the local forms of pottery were
sent to the Ceramic Repository at Ann Arbor,
Michigan, and were studied there by authorities on
pottery; James B. Griffin, Fellow in Aboriginal
North American Ceramics, in The Museum of
Anthropology, of The University of Michigan, and
by Frederick R. Matson, Ceramic Engineer, of the
same place. Two sherds, which had an appearance
different from any others found here, and which
resembled pueblo pottery, were sent to Dr. H. P.
Mera, Staff Archeologist of The Laboratory of
Anthropology, Santa Fe, New Mexico. All three of
these scientists have completed reports, which will
be printed with this article. The pottery sites will
be numbered separately for this report and the same
site numbers will also be used in the scientists’
reports on the sherds.

occur so regularly in pottery sites that they may
correctly be termed pottery culture artifacts. While
some of these, such as pear shaped flint scrapers,
do occur in many sites where pottery has not yet
been found, they always occur in pottery sites. Some
of the tools are so distinctive that the writer always
begins to search for pottery when one of them is
found. The large, pear shaped, keel backed scraper
type found in pottery sites is usually made of bluishgray flint but sometimes of black, and of pink flint.
A larger proportion of pottery artifacts than usual
is unpatinated. This scraper is either flat or slightly
curved on the bottom and chipped to a rounded or
keel backed shape on the back. The cutting end is
usually larger, rounded, and retouched to a sharp
edge. Typical pottery site scrapers usually vary
between 2 ½ and 3 inches in length, and 1 ½ to 1 ¾
inches in width, although some are larger and some
smaller. (P. scraper A.). The only pottery site where
the large form of this does not predominate is Site
No. 17, where another form was used. What
probably is a variant of this type is not so common
and it usually is broader, more rounded, and either
chipped down on the back to make it nearly flat or
it usually has been made so by taking two
longitudinal flakes out of the center of the back to
make two channels where the convexity has been.
Occasionally only one channel was removed from the
center, giving a Folsom appearance. (P. scraper B.).
In Site No. 17 a distinctive form of very small, finely
flaked, narrow, keel backed scraper occurs. Many
of these have the ends opposite to the rounded
cutting ends brought to sharp points, so that such a
tool could be used as a scraper on one end, and as
a graver on the other. This scraper will be known
hereafter as (P. scraper C.).
Pottery Types of Arrow Heads

The type of arrow head which occurs most
frequently in all pottery sites except site 17 is from
With a few notable exceptions, the artifacts 1 ½ inches long and ¾ inch or less wide at the barbs,

broad at the barbs. It is shaped like a spruce tree in
outline and usually has many minute serrations along
both edges; it is finely pointed, sharply barbed, the
tang long, slender, and brought to a sharp point.

face is flat except for a minute retouch on the edges.

points are stemmed and barbed and the blades are
thick and deeply bevelled so that they rotated in
flight. These arrows are usually about 2 ¼ inches
long and 7/8 inch broad. (P. arrow F.).

Another pottery type arrow head is small, thin,
usually minutely chipped on both faces, but
sometimes flat on one face, it has an elongated
triangular shape, and is usually slightly recessed at
the base. This arrow head has three notches in it,
one notch in each edge near the base, and another
notch at the end in the middle of the base. This
type is found to some extent in pottery sites but
usually not so abundantly as other types. This form
will be known as (P. arrow D.).

probably is the leaf shaped or Solutrean double
pointed knife. These are usually finely chipped on
both faces down to sharp points at both ends. (P.
knife A.). Occasionally however one of this shape
is entirely flat on one face, and beautifully chipped
all over the other, like the Mousterian knives, of
European Paleolithic sites. (P. knife B.). The knife
found second in numbers to the leaf or Solutrean
blade is the bevelled four edged knife. “The bevelled
knives are larger at one end, and are bevelled from
the place of maximum width, which is from a fourth
to a third of the distance from one end, in each
direction on each side to the points at the ends.
This bevelling in opposite directions produces four
different cutting edges on each knife.” (Note 1).
Hereafter in this article it will be listed as (P. knife
C.). These double pointed knives are usually from
4 ¼ to five inches in length and from 7/8 of an inch
to 1 ¾ inches wide, but a few are larger and smaller.

A number of other types of projectile points have
been found in pottery sites, of the larger forms
suitable for dart or atlatl heads, these include
stemmed and barbed and shouldered forms as well
as channeled points. Whether any of these forms

In the East Texas historic Caddo region A. T.
Jackson found the four edged bevelled knife in a
grave containing pottery, flints, and glass beads.
Jackson states: “In this historic grave also were
some flint knives, arrow points, etc. One flint knife
five and three-fourths inches long, was of the
bevelled, double pointed or four edged type, very
similar to knives found associated with potsherds
in certain sites in Central and West Texas.” (Note

Asinai—which, as you know, is closely related to
the Caddo. No, we do not find a great many fouredged knives in Caddoan graves. When they are so
found, they seem to be more recent. I do not recall
a single find of the bevelled knife in a prehistoric
Caddo grave. Hence I think you are right in your
conclusion that they are not very old. But I am
inclined to think that their center of distribution is
outside of East Texas; although their makers
undoubtedly had contact with East Texas tribes.
That might account for the presence of pottery in
West Texas and bevelled knives in East Texas.”

he made. He wrote that “The Panhandle Indians
made many double bevelled knives with four edges,
shaped something like an airplane propeller. These
knives varied in length from three to five inches.”
(Note 3). Floyd V. Studer wrote concerning
artifacts of the same region. “The types occurring
most frequently were the well bevelled four edged
knives. It appears to be a Texas Panhandle culture
type.” (Note 4). In a book on the Arkansas River
Region Warren K. Moorehead illustrated five four
edged knives from Kansas. (Note 5). He stated that
“Students will note that the “four edged” knives
are more common in the Great Plains and Texas
Panhandle than in the Pueblo Country. These knives
are very interesting and their distribution should be
ascertained. Seldom do they occur south of Central
and Southern Oklahoma and the type is not found
to the south and east, but rather extends through
the buffalo country.”

top level (111.). It also appears that the arrow heads
and most of the other flint criteria of that level are
very similar to the Texas pottery makers flint work.
Nebraska may have obtained the bevelled four
edged knives through Southern influences brought
in by her tribes of Caddoan stock.7
It is evident from Jackson’s observation that the
four edged knives were either made by the Asinai,
a Caddoan tribe, in historic times, or by some
contemporary tribe with whom the Asinai traded.
We also see that the four edged bevelled knives are
found in a vast area of Nebraska, Kansas, Oklahoma
and Texas which in the past has been occupied by
Caddoan tribes.

Most of the pottery and the pottery complex

includes the mano and metate. Fewer of the artifacts

usually have been used on only one side, but
sometimes on both. The pottery sites are situated
on sandy loam soils which would have been the
most suitable for corn or other crop growing.
However these soils are also usually covered, before
being cleared, with a thick growth of oak trees or
brush. In this connection, a Texas pioneer stated to
the writer that when he helped a party of early
settlers drive the last Indians out of this section,
that the Indians always carried a sack of meal made

of branches of the Clear Fork of the Brazos, which

Before this section was settled the old Butterfield
Stage Trail followed a branch of the Brazos up
Mulberry Canyon and over the Plateau to a tributary
of the Colorado on the south side and there passed
near the high conical Church Peak which may be
seen as a landmark for many miles in each direction.
There is evidence that the prehistoric Indians
probably traversed the same route, for there are
three pottery sites on Mulberry Creek and one site,
No. 15, contained the two Pueblo sherds which Dr.
Mera reported on, However no obsidian has been
found on Mulberry Creek.
Pottery Users Worked Flint Mines
On the top of the Plateau in the same region
near the little hamlet of Dora, on the headwaters of
Elm Creek, which is another tributary of the Brazos,
lie extensive prehistoric flint mines. Both E. B.
Sayles and the writer heard of these for several years
and knew the general area in which they were
situated but our informants always avoided giving
the true location thinking them to be Spanish metal
mines until W. A. Riney conducted Mr. Sayles to
the site. (Note 9). Apparently the Indians came up
all of the near branches of the Brazos and the
Colorado Rivers to work these mines. The Elm
Creek rises near the mines and flows for about
twenty miles east between the mountains, where it
turns north across the plains at Buffalo Gap and at
a distance of about thirty miles northeast of where
it leaves the mountains it joins the Clear Fork of
the Brazos. Along its course nine pottery sites have
been found and three of these sites contained either
obsidian flakes or obsidian artifacts. In Site No. 5
an arrow point of obsidian was found (P. arrow A.)
and two flakes of obsidian. In Site No. 6 located
north of the mountains a small kidney shaped
obsidian knife of a type not typical of this region
was found. In Site No. 8 situated near the mouth
of Elm Creek another obsidian flake was found by
the writer.
Site No. 1 is situated on a small branch of the
Colorado River several miles south of the Dora flint

mines, and in this site, besides the usual pottery
flint criteria the writer found seven obsidian flakes,
and a sea shell.
The owner of the land has also found several
smaller sea shell beads in Site 1.
A number of miles south of Site 1 Dr. Otto O.
Watts found an obsidian flake on top of Church
Mountain.
Apparently the route up branches of the
Colorado to the Dora flint mines, and then down
Elm Creek to the Clear Fork of the Brazos, was
the preferred trade route through the region to the
southwestern sources of obsidian, and sea shell
beads. Doubtless a considerable commerce in Taylor
County flint was carried on to regions not
possessing this easily worked true flint. However,
it seems like carrying coals to Newcastle to
transport obsidian over such long distances to the
vicinity of these extensive mines of high quality flint.
Doubtless prehistoric man also thought that other
pastures were always greener, or it is possible that
its color pleased him and it may have been of
ceremonial use.
Obsidian from New Mexico
A piece of obsidian from pottery site 1 was sent
to Dr. H. P. Mera, Staff Archeologist, of The
Laboratory of Anthropology, of Santa Fe, New
Mexico, for identification and with a request that
he name the probable source of the flake. He
reported as follows:
“I am returning herewith the specimen sent for
identification which proves to be obsidian. There
has also been included an example of our local type
to illustrate the great similarity and which has been
marked with a patch of white in order to distinguish
it from the one you sent. The Abilene specimen
appears to have been derived from the Jemez
Mountains area.”
The sample of New Mexico obsidian sent by
Dr. Mera apparently is indistinguishable from the
thirteen pieces of obsidian found by the writer in
sites of the Abilene region.

Red Paint Mines Attract Pottery Users
Doubtless another source of
prehistoric commerce which brought
pottery into the Abilene region was the
trade in red paint from the prehistoric red
oxide of iron (rouge) mines in the
southeast end of Taylor County. Here we
found two pottery sites on branches of
the Colorado River leading to these
mines. (Note 10). However no obsidian
has been found in either of these sites,
Nos. 17 and 18. All of the sites containing
obsidian in this region except one lie
along the prehistoric trade route across
the Edwards Plateau to the southwest.
Frequency of Different Types of
Artifacts in Sites
The numbers of sherds, and the
relative frequency of the different types
of artifacts found with pottery, will be
listed by sites in the text following.
Site One
In this site there were 415 scrapers,
of which 367 were of (P. scraper A.) type,
and 48 were of (P. scraper B.) type. Of
the total number 207 had some original
crust, and 208 were without crust. There
were 40 completely or white patinated,
212 gray patinated, and 163 unpatinated
scrapers. Of other artifacts there were,

Site Two
Site 2 is located near the flint mines previously
referred to. On a visit to the site, with the finder, E.
B. Sayles, one piece of sherd which had a painted
decoration was found by Sayles. Apparently it was
of Pueblo origin. The soil surface was covered, and
the soil was full to some depth, of flint flakes where
a vast number of artifacts had been made, during a
long period of time. However, there was a dearth
of formed artifacts on the unbroken sod surface.

This site has little flint in it. Its pottery is of the
plain, thin, brown, fossil bone tempered type,
described by Dr. Griffin. Eight sherds were found,
(P. scraper A.) 1, (P. knife C.) 1. In a site a short
distance across the creek, a small nicely flaked
obsidian knife, and many “Sand Dune” artifacts
were found. (See Vol. 1, 1929, Society’s Bulletin).

pointed. Of the intermediate gray patination, there
were 96 scrapers, of which 13 were graver pointed.
Of the white, thickly patinated scrapers, there were
75, and there were eight graver pointed among
these.
Doubtless many more scrapers had been
equipped with graver points, which had been broken
off, as nearly all had been brought down to narrow
pointed ends opposite to the rounded cutting ends.
While most of the scrapers had ridges down the
backs, 52 of them had been made quite thin, and
flattened on the backs, by taking the ridge out in
one central longitudinal flake. The scrapers of this
site were pictured and described under “Small
Scraper Culture” in Vol. 1, 1929 Bulletin Texas
Arch. & Pal. Society, see (Note 14). Scrapers of a
very similar type, although apparently none were
brought to graver ends, nor of so exquisite
workmanship as those of Site 17, are shown as
“Folsom Complex” scrapers in a 1935 Smithsonian
Bulletin. (Note 15). Along the highest portion of
this campsite remains of the plowed down rings of
a row of low Texas Burnt Rock mounds occur. The
associated artifacts found in this site set in motion
these thoughts. Is this a site of Folsom Culture? If
so, are the peculiar scrapers, the fine small arrow
heads, the bevelled knives and the plain undecorated
pottery of two types, also Folsom criteria, or the
work of other later occupants of the site? There is
no doubt that the small fine arrow heads, the pottery,
the scrapers, and the bevelled blades are all plowed
up together, mainly in one part of the site on the
slight slope of the southwest portion. These artifacts
will be kept together and available for future study
by a limited number of those doing serious scientific
research.
Site Eighteen
This site was found by E. B. Sayles, who
collected from it until he left here nearly four years
ago, but the writer has no data concerning the
artifacts obtained, other than that many pottery
sherds were found. From it the writer has since
collected 53 sherds. Also 49 scrapers of which 19
contained some original crust, and 30 no crust, 29
were patinated, 20 were unpatinated. Of scraper

59

types there were (P. scraper A.) 44, (P. scraper C.)
4, (P. scraper B.) 1; the latter has a deep channel
down the center. Considering that this site is not
over two miles from Site No. 17, the finding of
only four (P. scraper C.) type is significant. There
were 4 P. flake drills, paddle drills 1, barbed and
tanged drill 1, portions of knives which probably
are (P. knife A.) 15, (P. knife C.) 8, almond shaped
knives 3, flake knives 2, (P. arrow A.) 3, (P. arrow
B.) 1, (P. arrow C.) 1, many buffalo bones and teeth,
flint ball hammerstones, manos, and metates, and
red paint stones were found.
Site Nineteen
In this site a few (P. scraper A.) and 12 sherds
were found. The usual proportion of unpatinated
flints existed in the site.
Site Twenty
(P. scraper A.) 13, (P. scraper B.) 1, (P. knife

those in P. site 5). One portion of a used disk of red
oxide of iron paint stone was found.

A REPORT ON THE ARCHEOLOGY OF
TITUS COUNTY IN EAST TEXAS
BY WALTER R. GOLDSCHMIDT
This paper is a discussion of the most important
data obtained last season by a field crew of the
University of Texas, operating under the direction
of the writer in Titus County, in the northeastern
portion of Texas. Space does not permit me to say
more of the general culture traits of the East Texas
pottery region than to point out that it forms the
southwestern periphery of the Southeastern
Woodland Culture Area, and of the Mississippi
Valley Mound Culture. Village dwelling,
agriculture, pole huts finished in mud and thatch,
mounds, extended burials, pottery decorated with
engraved and applique designs, ground celts and
grooved axes, fine arrow-points and crude chert
and flint implements, shell and bone tools and
ornaments are all typical of the entire area.

and a culture, important as it may be in the vast
semi-arid region of the Southwest, cannot be
considered significant in the humid, flat, wooded
region with which we are dealing. The grouping of
materials, first by counties and then by river systems,
without previously determining whether this
grouping is established by the plotting of the
distribution of the various culture traits and
complexes and by statistical analysis, is not, in the
opinion of the writer, justified.

In the following pages we shall indicate, first,
the existence within a single area of two separate
phases of East Texas culture, and second, the
distribution of a single continuous phase over two
separate drainage systems. Let it be clear that we
do not discard entirely the previous classification,

Ten burials were found at each site, but in each
case some burials may have been destroyed. Both
cemeteries were small—about forty feet in
diameter—and the graves were close together,
being irregularly placed but nearly parallel. Only in
a few graves on the Williams site were there any
traces of skeletal material, while no remains were
discovered at the Caldwell site, and none of the
bones was strong enough to be taken from the
ground.
The total absence of skeletal material from many
East Texas graves has puzzled Texas archeologists.
Three separate solutions have been offered, which
may well be recorded here. The first is that the
remains had been cremated and were interred as
ashes which have since washed away. There are,
however, several objections to this suggestion;
namely, ashes are seldom found in these graves and
yet are often preserved in other places; the holes
are almost always of such a size and shape as to
contain an extended human body; there are all
gradations of decayed bones, and the poorly
preserved but discernible specimens of skeletons
show no traces of having been burned; and the
distribution of a culture trait of incineration would
find no correlation with the distribution of other
culture traits. A second suggestion is that in a given
degree of humidity the bones will disintegrate at a
constant rate, and that the extent of disintegration
is a result of the duration of inhumation. If this could
be proved, it would make an invaluable
chronometer. However, we find prehistoric sites
containing better preserved specimens than some
in which trade articles were found. As a matter of
fact, this explanation should not be employed until
definitely proved, since it leads to a relative dating
of sites which may prove confusing. A third
explanation is that the state of preservation is
dependent on the chemical and physical condition
of the soil and that it can indicate neither a culture
trait of cremation nor a relative chronology. Such
variable factors as the acidity of the soil, its chemical
nature, drainage, surface flora, and the subsurface
life, are all to be considered. Though East Texas is
superficially a unit in most of these factors, empirical
evidence must be had that only time and humidity

are important before relative age can be determined
from the condition of the skeletal remains.
The Caldwell graves were located at
approximately fifty degrees east of north, with a
single exception; this was headed due east. The
Williams burials were aligned more directly east and
west, varying as much as twenty degrees in one
case. The graves at the Caldwell site were rather
shallow, due probably to the erosion of surface soil
from the slope of the hill. At the Williams place
they had a depth of two and a half to three feet,
which is probably the average for burials in East
Texas. The graves varied a great deal in size.
The mortuary deposits in these graves were
similar in many respects, and represent a type widely
distributed in the central portion of East Texas.
There were ninety-five vessels in the graves at the
Caldwell site, and eighty-one at the Williams. There
was no especial arrangement of the vessels within
the graves, they were simply placed around the
body.
There is a general similarity in the types of vessels
and in their numerical distribution; that is, at each
site the bowl form is the most frequent and the pot
next, while less than one bottle per grave was found.
There are in each case a few unusual forms. The
most common form of bowl found in East Texas is
one with a flat base, a conical body, and an almost
vertical rim, the type called cazuela by Harrington.2
(Plate III, Nos. 4, 5, 6.) This form was abundant at
the Caldwell site but less so at the Williams. The
design, usually incised on the rim, is most often a
scroll in some conventionalized form. A more
frequent form of bowl at the Williams farm was the
type designated by Harrington as the intermediate
form.3 (Plate III, No. 8). The bottom is flat, the
sides conical, but curve abruptly inward at the top,
whereas the rim at the margin is curved outward.
The design is found either on the rim or on the
inturned ledge of the sides. The pot is usually a
utilitarian vessel. Some are large and were used for
storage, while others are smaller and were employed
in cooking. They were usually left undecorated
except for punctate marks around the rim and
vertical striations hastily scratched on the body with

a crude whisk on the soft clay. The pots from the
two sites were similar, only occasional variations
occurring. There was little that was distinctive about
the bottles from the Caldwell site. The designs
around the body consist of circles, scrolls and
diamonds or lozenges in various combinations. A
rather unusual feature at the Williams site was the
finding of three well-made bottles which were
similar in workmanship and design. The bodies were
four-cornered, i.e. approximately square, although
the neck and base were round, and the designs were
almost identical. The other Williams site bottles
were also better formed than those from the
Caldwell site. A single effigy bowl was found. Its
handles were conventionalized representations of
a bird’s head and tail, very similar to two specimens
in the University of Texas collections from the
Taylor farm, and to others from the Russell site.
The pottery from East Texas was usually made by
coiling, but one small piece from the Caldwell site
was shaped out of a lump of clay. At the Williams
site there was an egg-shaped bowl with nicely
finished scroll designs. Several pieces of redware
were found at the Williams site, but there was none
at the Caldwell site. These were colored by the
application of a red slip, the only type of slip
represented at these sites.
In East Texas, in Titus, Morris, Camp, Upshur
and Harrison counties, there is found in the graves
a peculiar type of arrowpoint, which is seldom if
ever found on the surface. They are finely chipped
chert points of triangular form with keen edges,
smooth surfaces and no tang. About eighty-five of
these typical specimens came from the Caldwell
burials. The forms found at the Williams site are
similar, but vary in that, first, they always have a
tang, second, they are less evenly formed, and third,
both flint and chert were used in making them. Celts
are often found in graves in East Texas, while
grooved axes have never yet been found buried with
the dead. Three celts were found at the Williams
site and one at the Caldwell. The occasional finding
of paint and ground clay in vessels in the graves is
typical of the region, and was found at both places.

63

This similarity is expected since the two sites are
only about two miles apart. They both appear to be
examples of a sub-culture of wider distribution in
East Texas, the prototype of which is found in the
Taylor site, an extensive cemetery in northeastern
Harrison County. Its distribution is not yet
determined, nor is it probable that lines of
demarcation will ever be clear. The pottery from
this region has been called Sabine River Ware by
Mr. Jackson,4 but its distribution is not limited to
the valley of that river. A culture complex with such
outstanding features as (1) abundant mortuary
deposits, (2) Cazuela and intermediate type bowls,
(3) scroll and circle designs, (4) utility pots, and
(5) the fine mortuary arrowpoint is found over a
large area in the central region of East Texas, and
represents a phase from which a majority of our
East Texas pottery at the University of Texas is
derived.
In the middle of August the crew moved to the
bank of the Sulphur River in the northwest corner
of Titus county, near Talco, Texas. Two sites were
investigated here, only one of which was completed.
The first of these was the William Farrar site, and
the latter the W. A. Ford. Both were on the very
edge of the Sulphur bottom lands, above flood level.
They were about two miles apart.
The entire terrace of the river is covered with
surface material consisting of crude chert artifacts
and sherds of various grades of pottery. Some pieces
of finer workmanship were found but most of the
material was crude. The Farrar site was on a natural
rise, and the small hill was covered with a midden
deposit about one foot deep, in which there were
several burials. Below the midden, which probably
had been thicker before the land was brought under
cultivation, was a hard, gray clay. Several graves
and some pottery vessels had been removed by the
tenant.

Seven burials were found on the hill during the
short stay at this site. Trenches were dug in three
separate locations not forty feet apart, yet different
types of burials were found in each of these three
places. At one place there were two badly jumbled

with these. Two other skeletons, flexed on their

right sides, were found at the second
location. Only flint artifacts were with
these. At the third location three extended
burials were found, two of which
contained one vessel each, while the third
had three vessels.
Unfortunately the mystery of the
existence of three distinct types of burials
within a radius of fifty feet remained
unsolved, as the crew was obliged to
leave the site on account of differences
between the owner and tenant over the
right to permit investigation.
The Ford site proved most interesting
in the light of our special problem, for
here we found burials of two separate
types. One of these bore similarities to
the extended burials (those containing
pottery) at the Farrar site, and will be
called Farrar type burials. The other can
be identified with the sites to the south
previously described, and will be called
Sabine type burials. The eight Farrar type
burials found at the Ford site were
shallow, averaging about eighteen inches
in depth. Several of these contained no
vessels, although as many as three were
found in one grave. The fragmentary
skeletal material was sufficient in most
cases to indicate the supine positions of
the bodies. None of the fine flint work
previously described was in any of these
burials, but only larger and relatively
crude pieces, and there was no polished
stone work. The molding of the vessels
is rather uneven; the typical cazuela and
intermediate forms are missing; and there
are no examples of the scroll motif.
Punctate designs, nodes, and straight
lines were employed in decorating the
vessels. These generalizations apply as
well to the vessels from the Farrar site.
The simplicity of form and design, as well
as the similarity between the Farrar site
vessels and those from the Farrar type
graves at the Ford site, is striking.

Three of the burials at the Ford site and their
mortuary deposits do not conform to the above
description. These three burials bear a close
resemblance to those at the Caldwell farm, and may
be considered a part of the same phase of East Texas
culture. They contained twenty-eight vessels and
thirty-one arrowpoints of the finely chipped type.
There was also a single celt. The skeletal material
was well preserved, in contrast to the bones in the
other graves at the site. There are many bowls of
the cazuela and intermediate forms, two bottles,
and several pots. The scroll motif and its
modifications were frequently employed, and
several pieces of redware were obtained.

examples of such situations being numerous. The
Sanders site (Lamar county) had two, the Clements
site (Cass county) had one involving three separate
graves, and the Taylor farm (Harrison county) had
a questionable example.5 None of these show any
evidence of having been made by two groups of
people and hence are not significant to students of
culture successions. Harrington describes intrusive
burials from several sites, and at the Washington
group of sites he finds either two separate peoples
or the same at different times.6 Unfortunately he
does not clearly distinguish either group. He also
believes that intrusive burials indicate a lapse of
time. In our case, the intrusive burial is valuable in
indicating the relative age of the two groups which

preceded the one of greater development, though
the length of the intervening time is not

Several successive building stages are apparent. The

creek, which then must have flooded at a higher
level than it now does, or it may have been mound

We will next describe the Keith
mound, a large earthwork about three
miles east of Mt. Pleasant, in the valley
of Hart’s Creek. The culture trait of
mound building extended into Texas as
far south as the Guadalupe River,
however we have as yet no positive
evidence that the mounds in Texas were
built by the Caddo Indians, but this is
probable, since no great differences in
culture existed between the people who
built the mounds and those who
occupied historic sites.
The Keith mound was probably a
ceremonial mound. It is fifteen feet high,
oval, with axes of 240 and 160 feet, the
longer axis being on a north-south line.
The sides, especially the east one, are
rather steep, and the top is flat. It has
been under cultivation about twelve
years, and the present owner claims that
it was originally about three feet higher,
had steeper sides, was clearly
rectangular, and had a large flat top.
These statements seem quite plausible,
as there is a great deal of earth around
the sides that must have been carried
down from above by the plow and by
erosion incident to plowing.
A wide trench was cut along the short
diameter. From this a cross-section was
obtained which indicated how the
mound had been built. A midden deposit
formed the floor of the mound. Red
clayey loam had been piled over this
shallow midden to form a small mound.
After a period of building inactivity
indicated by the finding of a fine
laminated sand layer around the sides,
this low mound was increased in size.

THE SPLIT STITCH BASKET, A DISTINGUISHING CULTURE TRAIT
OF THE BIG BEND IN TEXAS
BY VICTOR J. SMITH

Possibly the most valuable and
important results of research in the Big
Bend area have been obtained by a study
of parallel culture traits shown in a part of
the Trans-Pecos area and in that of the
Southwestern Basketmakers. These
similarities have been rather fully discussed
in a series of articles which have appeared
in the Texas Archeological and
Paleontological Society Bulletins, 1932 to
1934, inclusive, to which a valuable
addition has recently been made by Mr. F.
M. Setzler1 of the U. S. National Museum.
At the moment, however, I am
interested not in the Basketmaker evidence
in the Big Bend, but rather in the items of
difference between the two cultures. These
points of difference lie chiefly:
1. In the use of small reed arrows in
western Texas, sometimes fitted with
bunt points.
2. Differences in sandal technique, and
3. Differences in basketry technique.
Until further competent research throws
light upon the use of atlatl and arrows in
the Big Bend, there can be little profit in
discussing the first of these items.
As to the sandal types and techniques, I
have already reported in the Bulletins above
mentioned.
We may, therefore, center our attention
upon the basketry problem. Scattered
throughout the area under discussion we
have the following types of baskets
assembly:

relates to basketry, we find that true Basketmaker

in their basketry.
In conclusion, we may say that great progress
has been made during recent years with respect to
the archeological riddle presented by the Big Bend.
But many unsolved questions remain and new ones
are constantly arising. At the moment we are
confronted with Jackson’s discovery of pottery
associated with the Big Bend culture types and an
arrow shaft with bunt point. Recently Roberts has
suggested that the culture herein discussed may not
be an ancient one after all, yet the nature of the
deposits indicate clearly to field workers that the
caves of western Texas have been occupied for a
great length of time, the extent of which, it is
predicted, will be partially solved by a tree ring
study. The problem of the Big Bend should continue
to hold the interest of Southwestern students and
is worthy of continued investigation.

AN ARCHEOLOGICAL SURVEY OF
THE NUECES CANYON OF TEXAS
BY VANE HUSKEY
The Nueces Canyon extends from the head
waters of the Nueces River in Edwards County
south through Real and a part of Uvalde County.
This Canyon gradually becomes broader and more
level from the headwaters of the river, until at places
it reaches a width of five miles. In the Canyon are
many springs, which gave a plentiful supply of good
water at all times. There were also several varieties
of wild fruits and nuts, and an abundance of wild
game.
This, with its mild dry climate tended to make
the Canyon an ideal hunting ground for prehistoric
man, which can be attested by the large number of
burnt rock mounds found there. Three distinct types
of sites are to be found relatively, mounds, middens,
and rock shelters. These shall be dealt with in the
order named above.
Mounds

are still greasy. The rocks being of a soft texture,
when subjected to intense heat for any length of
time, broke up into smaller pieces then more slabs
were brought up. Through the years of more or
less continuous inhabitation these mounds were
built. The large central mound, being the community
center, is where one makes the greatest finds.
Of the relatively few mounds found where the
ash deposit has been left undisturbed by man and
the elements, four mounds were excavated, two
completely and two partially. In these mounds, the
ash deposit, with one exception, was found only
upon the north and northwest sides. The location
of this ash deposit has been found to be the same in
mounds type “B”, and in the camp middens. This
ash deposit in some instances was found to run a
distance of seventy feet from the outer circle of
rocks, and in depth from four and one-half feet at
this circle to eight inches on the outer edge.

The burnt rock mounds, while of the same
structural materials, seem to be of two separate
cultures. These mound cultures, I shall designate
as mounds “A” and “B”, and describe them in the
order named. Mounds of the type designated by
the letter “A” are numerous, while mounds of the
type designated by the letter “B” are scarce and
are found in widely separated localities.

Three strata of habitation are found. Between
the middle and lower levels the stratum is very
clearly defined. In some instances a layer of earth
and gravel approximately one-half inch thick
separates the two levels, while between the upper
and middle only a humus line separates the two.

Mounds of this type, with the exception of a
few variant forms, such as the sotol pit or mound,
generally consist of one very large central mound,
with a number of smaller ones scattered around with
no uniformity. Smaller tepee hearths can also be
found around these groups. It seems that the
inhabitants entertained no fixed idea of building a
mound or mounds, but merely carried limestone
slabs and rocks, and placing these in a circle, built
a fire in the center and when the rocks became
heated, placed chunks of meat upon them to roast.
This is further substantiated by the fact that the ashes
found deep down near the centers of the mounds

Great quantities of snail shells, some burned and
blackened by fire, are found at all levels. This leads
one to the conclusion that the snail was one of the
principal food supplies and that a good number were
eaten raw. Only an occasional fresh water mussel
shell is found, and as no living mussels are in the
streams of the Canyon at the present time, this leads
one to believe that mussels were very scarce at the
time the inhabitants were here. Crushed and
battered bones of deer and buffalo are usually in all
levels, in the majority of the mounds; in others only
small quantities were found.

Artifacts

No evidence of the use of tobacco,
other than the finding in close conjunction
of two pieces of deer horn which may have
been used as tubular pipes. The two pieces
were from the butt or end of the horn.
Both pieces were about two and one-half
inches in length, the butt having a small
hole drilled through the end, while the
hollow end was charred and burned. As
these were in the ashes there is a possibility
of their having come in contact with the
fire, thereby becoming charred. As only
two were found, others will have to be
found before any definite conclusions can
be reached as to their use for the purpose
of smoking. No potsherds are found
around mounds of this type.
That contact and trade was carried on
between these and other tribes, is
evidenced by the finding in one of the
mounds richest in artifacts of one threequarter grooved axe of gray granite or
similar stone, three celts, two of hematite,
and one highly polished of a fine dark
green stone three and three-quarter inches
long and two inches wide at the sharp
cutting end, from which it tapered to a
small rounded head. These celts are
suggestive of those found farther north.
These artifacts were found in the middle
stratum and are entirely foreign to this
locality.
While it is apparent that the inhabitants
went through a period of considerable
transition in the making of flint artifacts,
from the lower levels into the middle
where one finds artifacts that show
complete mastery of flint work. From the
middle to and in the upper levels one finds a marked
change. The artifacts in this upper level are generally
of one form and show a marked degree of
crudeness.

of those of the other mounds were screened.
Metates, manos, fist axes, (Coup de poings) and
knives of similar type are found, as well as side and
duck bill scrapers, and the so-called war club points
or heads, which were too large for hafting as

through all levels. While there is a noticeable degree
of variation in the form of the projectile points, this
is not sufficiently pronounced to lead one to think
of another culture, but merely to indicate that the
inhabitants may have passed through a period of
transition, thereby becoming more skilled in the art
of flaking and working flint, creating changes in
the forms which showed improvement over the
older ones. While a very large percentage of broken
knives and projectile points occur at all levels, the
artifacts as a whole run about twenty per cent for
the lower level, seventy per cent for the middle level,
and ten per cent for the upper. Awls and punches of
various sizes and lengths, while not rare, are not
plentiful. Some have rounded and flat bases, others
were reworked from projectile points, which could
be hafted.
Lower Level
The artifacts from this level, while not crude in
workmanship, are thick, heavy and very sharp
pointed. The projectile points are of two distinct
forms and do not vary from these types. In both,
the end of the tang is rarely square across, but
always has one corner lower than the other. The
knives are of uniform pattern, many of which still
retain their sharp cutting edges; and some are
notched for hafting. One triangular shaped slate
pendant with two holes drilled in the tip, and two
close to the bottom of the triangle for the suspension
of shell or other ornaments was found at this level.
Middle Level
Five different types of knives and projectile
points are found in this level which are perfect in
workmanship, and show complete mastery of
secondary chipping. The knives, while of the same
shape and pattern as those of the lower level, are
much thinner and have sharp cutting edges. Four
of the corner tanged knives were in this level, three
of them were taken from one mound. Of these three,
one was in contact with a fist axe and an unnotched
triangular shaped knife. These three artifacts were
so placed as to lead one to believe that they were
being used by the owner to complete some piece
of work. It is the writer’s opinion that these corner

73

tanged knives, fist axes, and other artifacts were
used for several different purposes. The projectile
points are very thin, are worked to a sharp point,
and are perfectly notched. Fist axes are much better
shaped and have sharp cutting blades.
Upper Level
The change from the middle to the upper level
can only be discerned by a humus line and the radical
change in shape and form of projectile points. One
form seems to dominate. The flaking shows a
carelessness in workmanship. The bottom point of
the tang projects farther than the points of the barb,
all of which seems to indicate that these points were
only made or used when the user could not procure
more suitable material, such as iron or steel.
Mounds “B”
Mounds of this type, while of the same structural
materials are of such an entirely different nature as
to form of artifacts, and mode of burial as to lead
one to believe that the inhabitants were of an entirely
different culture from those of mounds type “A”.
Only one stratum of habitation is found. This type
consists of only one large conical mound. Very few
of the kind are found in this locality, and of those,
only three were suitable for excavation. Of these
three, one was completely, and two partially
excavated. All artifacts were entirely different from
those found in type “A”. Only very small arrow
and bird points three-eighths to one and one-half
inches in length were found. While of some variation
as to form, all were of the same type. Not one large
knife nor projectile point was found. A very small
combination knife and punch, along with these small
arrow points, a few scrapers, and rough bone
crushers comprised the artifacts found. In the one
mound completely excavated, all of the ash deposit
was screened and over three hundred unbroken
artifacts were found. Very few animal bones were
found; those consisted chiefly of the bones of deer,
turkey and other small game. No buffalo bones were
found. A few potsherds, tempered with bone, were
found upon the surface. The artifacts are very similar
to those of the Gulf Coast, but the absence of shell
ornaments and other artifacts, such as those usually

74

Texas Archeological and Paleontological Society

associated with the Coast tribes, is
very confusing. Other similar sites
must be studied and marginal cultures
found before definite conclusions can
be drawn concerning the status of this
culture.

MOUND BURIALS
Mounds Type “A”
Two forms of burials associated
with this type of mound have been
found. Namely, flexed and bundle
burials. Of the former, four were
found, three of infants or very small
children and one of an adult female.
Those of the infants or children were
in the ash deposit around the mound.
A round hole of approximately
eighteen inches in width was dug to a
depth of about twenty inches below
the surface of the undisturbed earth,
the body was then placed in the hole
and large flat stones placed over it.
These rocks were then covered with
about one foot of soil, then a metate,
(in one burial there were three
metates) was placed horizontally in
the earth, and the rest of the hole
filled. The burial of the adult was in a
deep wash where the water had cut

be sure that there was no variation in this mode of
burial. The exact number of burials in each one of
these caves or crevices could not be ascertained.
In two cases only one skeleton was found, while in
another thirty-two skulls are known to have been
taken. This was a very large fissure, running
horizontally in the face of a cliff some sixty feet
high. The fissure penetrated the face of the cliff a
distance of approximately thirty-five feet. In the
fissure were cracks or openings running parallel to
the larger opening. The skeletons had been pushed
back into these cracks, then rocks were placed so
as to close the openings. Another place contained
a large number of skeletons. This was in a large
cave, entrance to which was gained by removing a
very large rock, and it was necessary to use a rope
to go down a distance of about twenty feet to get
into the cave proper. This cave was found by the
land owner, who noticed that the earth was washed
from one side of the rock covering the entrance,
leaving a hole. Upon exploration the skeletons were
found. Only one inspection was made, and this was
of very short duration, owing to the extreme danger
from the large rock in the top of the ceiling which
was very loose. Unfortunately a few days after this
visit, following a very heavy rain, the entrance caved
in, covering the skeletons with rocks and earth.
From the one inspection it was apparent that the
skeletons were brought to the opening and thrown
in, as all of the bones were directly below the
opening.
Burials, Mounds Type “B”

75

The artifacts found were of the same type and
consisted of two rubbing stones of gray quartz, or
other similar stone, showing much use and one
hammerstone of the same material. Stones of this
material are foreign to the locality. Also one mano
and one metate were found. In this instance the
metate was placed in the grave flat, with the bowl
or depression side up, with the mano placed in the
bowl, as in use. Twenty-seven perfect arrow and
bird points were found in one burial and the other
contained ten. These arrow points were of the same
variety as those screened from mounds of this type.
Two shell pendants were found, one in each grave.
These were elliptical in shape and were one and
one-half inches in width, and two and one-quarter
inches in length; two holes were drilled in the top
for suspension. The same symbols had been carved
on each, upon one side only. In one of these graves
a piece of white stone of a soft material, resembling
alabaster, was found; this was about two inches
square and it had the same symbols, as those found
on the pendants, carved on one side. One confusing
point was noticed, namely, the presence in one grave
of a finely chipped very thin knife, two and threequarter inches in length, and one and one-eighth
inches in width at the base. In the other grave, no
knife was found.
Middens
Kitchen middens, other than the mound types,
described in the preceding pages are found in this
locality, but not abundantly. Artifacts and potsherds
in these middens seem to denote a much later
culture. That these camp sites were used by different
tribes from time to time is evidenced by the artifacts.
The midden deposits around the campsites are
rather small, the deposits varying from depths of a
few inches to two feet. Bones of the buffalo and
deer are found in abundance. No burials have been
found in association with these middens, therefore,
no information could be obtained upon this subject.

Only two burials have been found thus far in
mounds of this type, both of which were found in
mounds widely separated, although the manner of
burial and artifacts were practically the same. These
were in the top of the mound and were discovered
by reason of the fact that some seven or eight large
flat stones had been placed in an extended
formation; these were evidently uncovered by rains.
In both instances a hole had been excavated

those found in mounds of type “A,” all of which
leads one to believe that people of the same culture
inhabited both the mounds and shelters.

Steel or iron projectile points are found very
frequently upon the surface.

Pictographs

With the exception of the work done by Mr. A.
T. Jackson of the University of Texas, in which
seven rock shelters were completely excavated, very
little work has been done in the shelters of this
locality. The writer, with the assistance of Mr. E.
A. Althaus, excavated one small shelter on the
Wallace Ranch, from which the following
information and artifacts were secured: This shelter,
while very small (fifteen feet in length and twenty
feet in width, with an eight foot opening at the
entrance) was very dry and dusty. Excavation was
started at the entrance, and a deposit of ashes and
refuse three inches deep, which ran to a depth of
eighteen inches at the center was found. Two very
young children or infant burials were found close
to the entrance. These burials were of the same type
as those in mounds type “A”, and described under
that heading with the exception that one painted
pebble was taken from one of these burials.

snakes, animals and unrecognizable types.
Shelters
Mortar holes were found in but one place, this
in a rock shelter on the Weaver Ranch, Lost Creek,
Kinney County, Texas, thirty miles west of this
canyon. The round-shaped holes, five in number,
were shallow and did not show use over a long
period of time.
Summary
It appears that the inhabitants of Mounds of type
“A” were of a Sedentary Group, moving to new
sites only when necessity dictated, while on the
other hand these mounds do not differ greatly from
those found elsewhere in the State.

As for the location of the ash deposits being only
upon the north and northwest sides of both types
of mounds, and middens, it would seem to be a
very probable conclusion to make that during the

The crudeness and the marked degree of
carelessness shown in the making of the artifacts
found in the upper level of mounds “A” leads one
to believe that the inhabitants of this level had made
contact with white men, thereby procuring iron and
steel to replace the flint artifacts. This contention
cannot be substantiated by any known facts other
than the finding of an occasional steel or iron

REPORT ON FOUR SHUMLA CAVE PACKETS
BY GEORGE C. MARTIN
In the “Archeological Exploration of the Shumla
Caves” (Southwest Texas Archeological Society,
Witte Museum, 1933, page 23) are mentioned four
small packets which had not been opened and
examined at the time that report was written. These
have recently been investigated, opened as a
courtesy to the Texas Archeological and
Paleontological Society so that the contents could
be described in an article in the “Bulletin.” For the
benefit of those readers to whom the original report
is not available some little information concerning
the finding of these specimens is given here.

In the basketry pouch before mentioned was
found a (willed weave scabbard which has been
pictured by J. Walker Davenport, Witte Museum
staff artist, as Plate 17, No. 167, in the illustrations.
The scabbard measures three inches in length and
two and five-eighths inches in breadth. Within it
was the flint flake knife pictured as No. 168, and
the packet No. 169. The latter specimen is three
and a half inches in length, and is slightly under a
half inch in width. It is composed of fiber of the
lechugilla (Agave lechugilla), the strands laid

PLATE 16.
Nos. 169 to 172 show a packet and objects which it contained found in Shumla Cave. (See text).
The packet depicted as No. 173 was formed
much as were the two described above. It is three
and a quarter inches in length and has an irregular
width varying under and over a half inch. In the
forming of this bundle the fibers were laid parallel,
the contents were placed among the strands, then
one end of the fiber mass folded back upon itself
and the contained materials. It was then wrapped
with a half inch wide strip of untanned hide. The
contents consisted of cactus thorns which had been
artificially recurved to serve as fishhooks, No. 175.
Twelve have been removed from the package and
it apparently contains as many more. The hide
wrapping is stiff and brittle, and the removal of the
entire contents would necessitate the destruction
of the container. The identification of the recurved

thorns as fishhooks is positive. Other specimens
found at Shumla still retain the fiber wrappings with
which they were attached to line or leader, and one
cluster of hooks is tied in the form of a lure with
fiber “fly” attached.
The fourth packet is pictured as No. 174. It
consists of a small sheet of animal hide, the fur still
on it. Originally the skin was four inches or more
square, but has shrunk and hardened until it is brittle.
Its contents proved to be a vegetable wool, possibly
from the milkweed. The wool had been laid on the
furry side of the skin which had then been bundled
up around it and tied with a narrow strip of
lechugilla leaf. A square or reef knot was used.

This work by Dr. Pearce briefly deals with many
of the diverse fields interwoven with the study of
archeology, such as geology, organic evolution,
sociology, ethnology and psychology.
Dr. Pearce has produced a very readable book
from which the non-professional archeologist can
get a short somewhat connected idea of human
progress and evolution, and some valuable
suggestions as to the reasons why such civilizations
as those of China reached a certain stage, and then
“fossilized” into a certain unchangeable pattern, a
“conditioning” of the mind against all new ideas or
change as either wicked or dangerous, which
operates to “freeze” a civilization into whatever
pattern seemed desirable in the beginning.

aspirations. We are the products of all the racial
experiences of the past. He shows the evil effects
of false beliefs and superstitions in retarding the
progress of civilization. By a study of archeology
man learns why he is as he is. Some of Dr. Pearce’s
observations on the effects of superstitions
doubtless will offend some of the Texas brands of
Whirling Dervishes. The book will make one think,
and to many that is an unforgivable offense. When
we knock on the door of an empty house all we get

that time assured the writer that both flints were
forgeries, after asking whether or not the writer
found them. One of them assured the writer that
the principle of the saw was utterly unknown to
the American Indian and that some white man made
them. As the writer had found neither of them he
could not contradict such statements although he
believed that the gentlemen were badly mistaken.
Not more than thirty days after his return the writer
found an almost exact duplicate of the serrated flint
disk condemned by the professionals and it also
was covered with white patina. While not common,
such disks are occasionally found in the Abilene
region; however any one who has either collected
near Colorado, Texas, or examined local collections
in that area, can testify to the fact that serrated
knives are often found in that region.

Folsom Sites
The Smithsonian Bulletin by Roberts reviewed
elsewhere brings up many questions of interest. One
of the two main local channeled point sites is
discussed as pottery site 17, elsewhere in this
Bulletin. That site bears little evidence of age.
However there is another local site which shows
considerable signs of age. It is in the deeply eroded
banks of a small dry branch between two mountains.
Embedded in a bank at a depth of eight feet from
the original surface the writer found a flake knife.
Embedded in another bank a generalized channeled
point. Other typical points of that type were found
on its deeply eroded surfaces as well as one of the
beautifully chipped true Folsom Points.

Culture Complex were found. It would appear that
flake knives, graver points and spokeshaves are
common to both cultures, or are so mixed as to be
hard to separate. At any rate all seem to be equally
patinated. The mano and metate have not thus far
been found in that eroded area, and the later forms
of end scrapers have been found but rarely, and
then only one in a place. Nor have the small graverscrapers of site 17, nor Roberts similar type of end
scrapers been found; of the latter type only one
scraper has been found in many years search of this
area. The small thin arrow points of site 17 are not
found in the camp sites of this area. Nearly all of
the artifacts found in the area are heavily patinated
and nearly all of the projectile points are large
enough for either dart or spear points.
The forms of projectile points may be separated
into many distinct types which apparently are not
at all related. The erosion of the area probably has
exposed several ancient culture types on a common
level. The mass of the evidence would indicate that
all probably date from a period of greater rainfall
than exists in the region at the present time. Whether
the Folsom Criteria are the older, or those of the
Clear Fork, the writer cannot definitely determine,
but inclines to the belief that the latter are the oldest.
During the summer of 1935 the writer found
four teeth and the decayed bones of a mammoth’s
skeleton embedded in the same reddish-tan light
wind blown soil in this site. The teeth were
excavated with the assistance of Dr. Otto O. Watts
of Hardin-Simmons University and Dr. E. H.
Sellards of Texas University. Apparently the flints
in this site erode out of the same wind blown
deposit, but whether they extend below or as low
in the deposit as the mammoth bones we could not
determine from the small amount of digging done
thus far in the site.

From the finds here and elsewhere the writer
takes no stock in the theory that stemmed and

PLATE 17.
The artifacts shown on this plate came from an eroded area where both the large generalized
Folsom type, and the smaller, finer worked, true Folsom points have been found. Nos. 179, 180
and 182, are of the generalized type and No. 199, is of the true Folsom type. Nos. 195, 196 and
197 are broad based shouldered points, from this site, which have channels extending from beneath
the shoulders diagonally across the faces of the blades to end on the opposite cutting edges near
the points. This same technique was used in two square based points, Nos. 180 and 182. The long
(3 ¾ inches) flint drill, No. 183, is the only one of that type found in this region. The nearest to it
in type are two much smaller drills with rounded, thickened bases from Pottery Site 17. Nos. 208,
and 218 are spokeshaves. No. 209 is a typical planer of a type which is usually found in this eroded
area with No. 233; both are part of the “Clear Fork Culture Complex” which probably belongs
somewhere near to, or is older than the Folsom Criteria. Nos. 210, 212, 213, 214 and 215, are
gravers. No. 216, a side scraper, was found in 1929 embedded in a vertical bank at a depth of 8
feet below the soil surface, across the dry creek branch from where a mammoth’s skeleton was
exposed by erosion in the same chocolate colored wind blown deposit during the summer of 1935.
Nos. 217, and 219, are side scrapers of an ancient type. The bottom row are dart or spear heads of
ancient types. Nos. 223, 224, 225, and 226 have a peculiar form of bevelled base; this type always
erodes from deeply buried sites. Nos. 227, 228 and 229 are quite thin and straight edged; No. 227
is 3 ½ inches in length, and 1 2/16 inches in width. Nos. 195, 196 and 197 are thick, roughly
fractured, shouldered and channeled; others of this type with the exception of not being channeled,
have been found deep in gravel deposits in this region and under conditions elsewhere which
indicate that they are of a very old type. No. 180 was found embedded in the side of a gully in the
wind blown deposit from which these artifacts erode; it is channeled on both faces, and is covered
with a thick white patina. There is a rather uniform white coating of patina on nearly all of the
artifacts shown on this page. Only a few have only progressed to the gray stage of patination.

extending down the centers to near the points. Other
similar points, not channeled, have been found deep
in gravel deposits on other creeks near Abilene, and
the writer has found them in the loose gravel
immediately below the deeply buried Gibson site,
where it is probable that they had eroded from those
superimposed strata. (See plate 15, Vol. 2, 1930
Bulletin Texas Arch. and Pal. Society). Typical
artifacts of this deeply eroded area are shown in
plate 17 of this issue.

In Appreciation
We wish to herewith express our thanks for
prompt identification of specimens and courteous
co-operation to the University of Michigan
authorities, Dr. James E. Griffin and Frederick R.
Matson; to Dr. Carl E. Guthe of The Committee
on State Archeological Surveys of The National
Research Council; to Dr. Ernest A. Hooten of
Harvard; to Dr. Warren K. Moorehead of Phillips
Academy, Andover, for advice and valuable
literature; and especially to Mr. Albert G. Ingalls,
Associate Editor of The Scientific American
Magazine, for a mass of information and good
advice cheerfully given, as well as much valuable
literature made available to the Editor of this
Bulletin without cost. This particular issue of The
Bulletin is indebted to Dr. H. P. Mera of The
Laboratory of Anthropology, Santa Fe, New
Mexico, for his kindness and very unusual
promptness in making identifications of materials
sent to him. We wish also to acknowledge with
thanks the receipt of a collection of marked New
Mexican Pueblo pot sherds from J. Charles Kelly.
The assistance of such scientists has added many
facts to the Bulletin and materially reduced the
editorial burden.

On Artifact Forgers
In the writer’s opinion some of the most
contemptible characters infesting the good earth are
those who forge antique furniture, paintings or any
artifact of past ages and palm their productions off
on the unwary as genuine products of the past.

87

The writer knows of certain private collectors
who have bought beautifully chipped, suspiciously
long spear, arrow and dart points and drills which
apparently are either of a beautiful ruby red, or of
an equally fine shade of green glass. The sellers of
these must enjoin secrecy on the buyers as the only
information obtainable is that the alleged “finder”
found them in “graves” high up in the western
mountains. The buyer is led to believe that they are
of some rare form of obsidian or some other
mysterious red stone.
The source of these glass artifacts, supposedly
made from the colored glass of switch lights, should
be ascertained and their originator should be
prosecuted. If there is now no adequate law on the
books, in the various states, which will stop such
counterfeiting, or at least the sale, or offer to sell,
or transportation of fraudulent antiques, such laws
should be enacted. The writer knows of one farmer
in this region who has practiced flint chipping until
he is now able to duplicate any of the small delicate
Indian arrow heads in flint or any color of bottle
glass. He showed the writer arrow points of onehalf to one inch in length in amber, blue and green
bottle glass and one made from the milk colored
glass of a Mason fruit jar top. His work is perfect,
but in so far as the writer knows he has not
attempted to deceive anyone thereby. However,
while his intentions are doubtless innocent, when
once these arrow heads leave his possession they
are then likely to fall into the hands of unscrupulous
antique store proprietors who may invent a “bear
story” to fit them.
* * * *
Some Unusual Cremated Burials
Until the year 1935 the writer has had to rely
entirely on his own funds with which to finance
excavation, and on week end periods for the time
to do the work. This year a contribution toward
the formation of an “Excavation Fund” was made
by J. L. Bridwell who is interested in Texas scientific
research. Part of this fund was used to make three
trips to a site in Mitchell County, 105 miles west of
Abilene.

Here a stone grave situated on a high hill top
above a campsite containing many boat shaped
mortar holes (the site previously described in Vol.
2, 1930 Bulletin Texas Arch. and Pal. Society, p. p.
52 to 58, plate 13) was excavated, and in it were
found five stone pendants, one shell pendant, one
shell bead, one stone problematical object, probably
a head band ornament, three large dart points, and
two polished gray-green stones shaped like a
portion of the moon when only about a third is
visible on the horizon. The rounded edges of each
were notched. A stone ring was also found. The
grave had been partially cut into bed rock like
another one excavated on the banks of the Colorado
River in 1932, described in Vol. 4, 1932 Bulletin of
this Society, pp. 67 to 69, plate 14. The body had
been cremated with all of its ornaments. Two teeth
indicated it was that of a young child. There was

little left but a few very small charred bone
fragments. Considerable broken shell fragments
indicated that the fire had probably destroyed many
shell ornaments.
On a later trip excavation in a small cave on the
south side of the same mountain showed that the
bodies of two adults had been flexed, and then
cremated. However the fire had not been so hot
and the bones, with the exception of the skulls, were
not greatly damaged, and were still partly in flexed
position. Four deeply serrated, small arrow heads
were found with the bones. No ornaments similar
to these have previously been found in the region
with the exception of an Abalone shell pendant
found on the same hill by J. H. Lowry when the
writer first visited the site in 1930.
