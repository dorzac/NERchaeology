MANAGEMENT SUMMARY

The project consists of intensive survey of approximately 2 miles of proposed new alignment for
the SH 276 Bypass at Quinlan in Hunt County, Texas. The project area of potential effect and the
construction right-of-way (ROW) will vary from 130 feet wide for the urban section to 160 feet
wide through the rural section. The urban section is approximately .8 miles long and extends
south of Quinlan, and the rural section makes up the remainder of the project west of town. All
of this area to be surveyed is newly proposed ROW, none of which has been acquired by the
state. Rights-of-entry (ROE) had been acquired for most of the properties at the time this survey
was conducted.
The proposed construction project consists of a new five-lane rural/urban highway section that
will match previous sections. The rural portion of the project will consist of four traffic lanes
with a center turning lane and soft shoulders. The urban portion will consist of four traffic lanes
with a center turn lane, and curbs and gutters. The alignment will cross two small drainages
requiring the placement of concrete box culverts. The deepest depth for the box culvert will be
the depth of the drainage, or 6 to 8 feet. All of the remaining alignment will be at grade, and the
depth of impact will between the surface and 3 feet.
The purpose of the cultural resources investigation in this construction project area was to
determine the presence/absence of archeological resources and to evaluate identified resources for
their eligibility for inclusion in the National Register of Historic Places, as per Section 106 of the
National Historic Preservation Act of 1966, as amended, or as a designated State Archeological
Landmark under the Antiquities Code of Texas.
Geo-Marine, Inc., archeologists initiated fieldwork on 12 June 2007 and concluded on 13 June
2007 (GMI project # 30575.00.01). In summary, a total of 56 shovel tests was excavated, all
revealing either disturbed context or the absence of cultural remains. Five nonsite localities were
identified, but all were structures of modern age and considered to have no research potential.
Therefore, it is recommended that the proposed new alignment for the SH 276 Bypass will have
no adverse effect on historic properties in or near the APE and construction may proceed. All
notes, forms, and photographs obtained from the project are on file at the Texas Archeological
Research Laboratory curation repository, the University of Texas in Austin.

CHAPTER 1
INTRODUCTION

This report describes the results of an intensive pedestrian survey conducted along the proposed
route of approximately 2 miles of new alignment for the SH 276 Bypass near Quinlan in Hunt
County. Geo-Marine, Inc. (GMI), under subcontract with Michael Baker Jr., Inc., conducted the
archeological survey of this new alignment in the Paris District of the Texas Department of
Transportation (TxDOT). The purpose of the cultural resources investigation was to identify and
inventory cultural resources contained within the proposed project area and to evaluate their
potential for inclusion in the National Register of Historic Places (NRHP) or for designation as a
State Archeological Landmark (SAL).
GMI was contracted to conduct an intensive pedestrian survey of 2 miles of new alignment for
SH 276. The proposed project consists of a new five-lane rural/urban highway section that will
match previous sections to the east and west. The proposed right-of-way (ROW) varies from 130
feet wide for the urban section to 160 feet wide through the rural section (Figure 1). The urban
section will consist of four traffic lanes with a center turn lane, and curbs and gutters. It is
approximately 0.8 miles long and extends south of Quinlan. The rural section, which consists of
four traffic lanes with a center turning lane and soft shoulders makes up the remainder of the
project to the west of town. The alignment will cross two small drainages requiring the
placement of concrete box culverts. The deepest depth for the box culvert will be the depth of the
drainage, or 6 to 8 feet. All of the remaining alignment will be at grade, and the depth of impact
will between the surface and 3 feet. This 2-mile long, maximum 160-foot wide corridor
comprises the area of potential effect (APE). All of the area surveyed is new proposed ROW, on
private property, none of which has been acquired by the state, but at the time of survey, right-ofentry (ROE) had been obtained for the majority of the project area. Though a full parcel map of
landowners was not available, an aerial map showing those parcels where access was granted was
supplied by the district before going to the field. The project area was examined through shovel
tests and photo-documentation.
The work for this project was completed 12â13 June 2007. This work was undertaken in order to
satisfy federal requirements governing cultural resources treatment under Section 106 of the
National Historic Preservation Act (NHPA) of 1966, as amended through 2000 [16 U.S.C. Â§ 470
et seq.; P.L. 89â665; 80 Stat. 915] and the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) of 1969
[42 U.S.C. Â§Â§ 4321â4347; P.L. 91â190; 83 Stat. 852]. TxDOT, the ultimate client, created under
1

enabling state legislation and thus a political entity of the State of Texas, must comply with the
Antiquities Code of Texas [Title 9, Chapter 191, the Natural Resources Code of Texas];
therefore, the cultural resources investigation was carried out under Texas Antiquities Permit
Number 4509.
The following discussion provides information on the environmental setting (Chapter 2) and the
cultural setting of the project area (Chapter 3). The research goals and methodology used during
the survey (Chapter 4), the research results (Chapter 5), and the recommendations concerning the
project area (Chapter 6) complete the report. Following the main body of the report are a list of
references cited and a list of the curated materials (Appendix A).

CHAPTER 2
ENVIRONMENTAL SETTING

The project area is located in the southern uplands of Hunt County west of Lake Tawakoni. Hunt
County is part of the Western Gulf Coastal Plain, but the project area lies more specifically within
a subdivision of this zone commonly referred to as the Blackland Prairie Ecoregion. This chapter
summarizes the modern natural environmental conditions of the survey area by providing
information about the topography and hydrology, geology, soils, climate, flora and fauna, and
concludes with a synthesis of the regional paleoenvironmental sequence.
TOPOGRAPHY AND HYDROLOGY
The western portion of the project area begins approximately .7 kilometer (.4 mile) east of the
intersection of SH 36 and SH 276 in the uplands west of Lake Tawakoni at elevations from 450â
510 feet above mean sea level. The APE runs eastward passing through two of the northern
dendritic reaches of Jones Creek west of Quinlan and eventually concludes at the intersection of
SH 34 and SH 276 (see Figure 1). This area is part of the upper reaches of the Sabine River
drainage and lies just east of the East Fork of the Trinity River basin.
GEOLOGY
Hunt County is part of the Western Gulf Coastal Plain, a physiographic province derived from
Upper Cretaceous marine and deltaic processes of the Gulf of Mexico (Fenneman 1938:100â102;
Sellards et al. 1932). The project area can be further subdivided into the Blackland Prairie
Ecoregion (Texas Parks and Wildlife [TPWD] 2007a), and narrowly defined as being underlain
by primarily Kemp Clay and Corsicana Marl (Kkc) undivided. These are described as follows:
âmostly clay, calcareous, locally silty, compact, thinly laminated, subconchoidal fracture,
medium dark gray; weathers light gray and fissile; some interbeds of fine-grained sandstone near
base; marine megafossils; thickness 300-400 feetâ (Bureau of Economic Geology [BEG]1987).
In addition, a small area containing the Pisgah and Littig Members of the Kincaid Formation
undivided (PAKp; part of the Midway Group) may intrude into the project area. This formation
is described by BEG (1987) as being â. . . sand and clay. Sand, glauconitic, argillaceous, poorly
sorted, medium gray to greenish gray, some hard sandstone beds near top; clay, sandy, silty,
phosphatic pebbles and nodules present in lower part, medium gray to dark gray; weathers to
yellow and yellowish brown soil with a thickness of 150Â± feet.â

SOILS
USDA (1981) has mapped seven soils within the project area: Axtell loam, 2 to 5 percent slopes;
Crockett loam, 1 to 3 percent slopes; Ferris-Heiden complex, 2 to 5 percent slopes, eroded; Leson
clay, 1 to 3 percent slopes; Lufkin-Rader complex; Nahatche loam, frequently flooded; and
Wilson silt loam, 0 to 1 percent slopes.
Axtell loam, 2 to 5 percent slopes, forms along ridge tops and on the side slopes of uplands above
drainages. The representative soil profile begins with a dark grayish brown loam about 10
centimeters (cm; 4 inches [in]) thick, that is underlain by a light yellowish brown loam from 10 to
20 cm (4â8 in) below surface. The subsoil begins with a clay zone found between 20 and 86 cm
(8â34 in) below surface that is yellowish red in the upper part, grayish brown in the middle part,
and light grayish brown in the lower part. There are reddish and brownish mottles throughout
this zone. This is underlain by a grayish brown clay loam with yellowish brown mottling from 86
to 135 cm (34â53 in) below surface, which in turn is underlain by a light brownish gray sandy
clay loam with olive yellow mottling from 135 to 203 cm (53â80 in) below surface (USDA
1981:9â10).
Crockett loam, 1 to 3 percent slopes, is a gently sloping soil found on uplands. The soil profile
typically begins with a dark grayish brown loam approximately 18 cm (7 in) thick. The subsoil
begins with a dark reddish brown clay from 18 to 30 cm (7â12 in) below surface, which is
underlain by a mottled yellowish brown, dark grayish brown, and reddish brown clay from 30 to
56 cm (12â22 in) below surface. Below this is a dark grayish brown clay with yellowish mottles
from 56 to 104 cm (22â41 in) and a clay zone composed of light olive brown soils in the upper
part and mixed brownish, grayish, and olive soils in the lower part from 104-165 cm (41â65 in)
below surface (USDA 1981:11).
The Ferris-Heiden complex, 2 to 5 percent slopes, eroded, are gently sloping soils found on ridges
and on the side slopes of uplands above drainages. Rill and shallow gullies are common. The
complex is composed of roughly 50 percent Ferris soil and 35 percent Heiden soil, while the
remaining portion may include small area of Leson, Houston Black, or Crockett soils. The
representative Ferris soil profile begins with a surface layer of dark olive gray clay approximately
10 cm (4 in) thick, beneath which is an olive clay from 10 to 76 cm (4â30 in) below surface. This
is underlain by a light yellowish brown clay with olive mottles and dark olive gray streaks from
76 to 132 cm (30â52 in) below surface, and mottled light gray, yellowish brown, and light olive
brown shaly clay from 142 to 165 cm (52â65 in) below surface. Heiden soils begin with a very
dark gray clay about 13 cm (5 in) thick, below which is a dark grayish brown and olive clay from
13 to 147 (5-58 in) below surface. This is, in turn, underlain by mixed brownish, grayish, and
yellowish clay from 147 to 165 cm (58â65 in) below surface (USDA 1981:14-15).
Leson clay, 1 to 3 percent slopes, is a gently sloping soil found on uplands. The representative
soil profile begins with a very dark gray clay about 71 cm (28 in) thick. A dark grayish brown
clay lies from 71 to 147 cm (28â58 in) below surface and is underlain by a mottled grayish
brown, light gray, and light olive brown shaly clay from 147 to 183 cm (58â72 in) below surface
(USDA 1981:21â22).
The Lufkin-Rader complex consists of nearly level soils that formed on old terraces. It is
composed of 50 to 60 percent Lufkin soils and 25 to 40 percent Rader soils, with the remaining
portion containing small areas of Axtell soils or other similar series. A representative Lufkin
6

profile begins with an A horizon consisting of grayish brown loam in the upper 10 cm (4 in) and
brownish gray loam from 10 to 20 cm (4â8 in) below surface. The B horizon begins with grayish
brown clay from 20 to 64 cm (8â25 in) below surface, beneath which is a dark grayish brown
clay from 64 to 127 cm (25â50 cm) below surface. This is underlain by a light brownish gray
clay from 127 to 188 cm (50â74 in) below surface and a light olive gray clay from 188 to 203 cm
(74â80 in) below surface. Rader soil begins with a brown loam approximately 15 cm (6 in) thick,
with yellowish brown loam from 15 to 28 cm (6â11 in) below surface. A strong brown loam is
found from 28 to 51 cm (11â20 in) below surface. A mottled yellowish red, red, and brown clay
loam lies between 51 and 69 cm (20â27 in) below surface, which is underlain from 69 to 203 cm
(27â80 in) below surface by a clay horizon that is mottled gray and red in the upper part and
grades to light brownish gray in the lower part (USDA 1981:24).
Nahatche loam, frequently flooded, is a nearly level soil found on flood plains. The
representative soil profile begins with a dark grayish brown loam with strong brown mottling
about 10 cm (4 in) thick, which is underlain by a brown loam with dark yellowish brown and
strong brown mottling from 10 to 23 cm (4â9 in) below surface. The B horizon begins with clay
loam from 23 to 94 cm (9â27 in) below surface that is dark grayish brown in the upper part and
mottled gray and brown in the lower part. Finally, a grayish brown sandy clay loam with
yellowish brown mottling is found from 94 to 203 cm (27â80 in) below surface (USDA 1981:24â
25).
Wilson silt loam, 0 to 1 percent slopes, is a nearly level soil that forms on old terraces. The
typical profile begins with a dark grayish brown silt loam approximately 15 cm (6 in) deep. This
is underlain by clay deposits from 15 to 163 cm (6â64 in) below surface that are very dark gray in
the upper part, black in the middle part, and dark grayish brown in the lower part. Finally, a light
gray clay is found from 163 to 203 cm (63â80 cm) below surface (USDA 1981:27â28).

CLIMATE
The modern climate of this region is characterized by a warm temperate, subtropical, and humid
climate that is generally mild, with brief periods of extremely hot and cold weather. The
prevailing winds are southerly with temperatures remaining above 0Â°C (32Â°F) approximately 240
days each year (USDA 1981). Summers are hot and prone to drought, with temperatures often
reaching and exceeding 37Â°C (100Â°F). Yearly rainfall is fairly evenly distributed, with the
maximums occurring in April, May, and September and the minimum in August. Much of this
rainfall is in the form of heavy thunderstorms, resulting in rapid runoff limiting absorption by the
soil. Snowfall is rare, generally lasting less than one week and averaging less than 2.5 cm (1 in)
per year.

FLORA AND FAUNA
The West Gulf Coastal Plain Section of Texas consists of series of relatively narrow, north-south
alternating vegetation bands of oak-hickory forests and open grasslands. A west-to-east cross
section of the region indicates transitions beginning in the Western Cross Timbers, crossing into
the Grand Prairie, followed by the Eastern Cross Timbers, and concluding in the Blackland
Prairie. The project area occurs in the Blackland Prairie portion of the region, which is one of
several tall grass prairies in this part of Texas. The region is also assigned to the Texan biotic
7

province, which is representative of its intermediate location between the grasslands of the
Southern Plains to the west (Kansan Balconian and Tamaulipan biotic provinces) and the
deciduous forests of the Southeast (Austroriparian and Carolinian biotic provinces) (Blair 1950;
Fenneman 1931, 1938; Kier et al. 1977).
No endemic vertebrate species are in the Texas biotic province, but 47 species of mammals are
common in the region. These mammals include several animal species, such as white tail deer,
bison, bear, squirrel, rabbit, muskrat, and raccoon, of particular economic benefit to present and
past human populations. Other important faunal resources in this region prior to European
contact included bear, bison, and antelope. Additional species of limited benefit include a range
of turtle, snake, frog, fish, and freshwater mussel, along with bird species such as bobwhite, quail,
and pheasant. Other species associated with this region include the meadowlark, field sparrow,
sage grouse, lark bunting, gray fox, and red fox (Schmidly 1983; USDA 1981).
Blackland Prairie vegetation is dominated by grasses in the uplands, and woodlands are restricted
to streams and river bottoms. Prior to the historic period, the project area was covered with a
water oak-elm-hackberry forest, with occasional grassy clearings and shallow water marshes and
ponds (McMahan et al. 1984). Where it exists today, and possibly through the majority of the
Holocene, this bottomland forest can include cedar elm, American elm, willow oak, southern red
oak, white oak, black willow, cottonwood, red ash, sycamore, pecan, bois dâarc, flowering
dogwood, dewberry, coralberry, dallisgrass, switchgrass, Virginia wild rye, Johnsongrass, giant
ragweed, yankeeweed, and Leavenworths eryngo (McMahan et al. 1984:22),. Cherry, sweetgum,
hawthorn, blackberry, sedge, Indiangrass, giant cane, and beaked panicum were probably also
present (USDA 1981).
The upland portion of this project area typically consists of tall grass prairies, with wooded areas
generally restricted to stream courses. Dominant floral species include little bluestem, big
bluestem, and Texas wintergrass. The Blackland Prairie proved to be exceptionally fertile
cropland and today few areas of native prairie remain due to extensive European agricultural
practices (Jurney et al. 1989:13â14, TPWD 2007b).
SYNTHESIS OF THE REGIONAL PALEOENVIRONMENTAL SEQUENCE
The regional paleoenvironmental synthesis compiled by Bryant and Holloway (1985) stands as
one of the main sources of information for this region of Texas. They compiled data spanning the
Wisconsin Glacial to the present and identified three major paleoenvironmental shifts, beginning
with the Wisconsin Glacial period (20,500â12,000 B.C.). They defined this period as possessing a
cooler, moister climate than present. The pollen data for the subsequent Late Glacial period
(12,000â8,000 B.C.) signifies an increase in mean temperature due to the rise in grass pollen and
decrease in arboreal pollen. Finally, the Holocene period (8,000 B.C.âpresent) is generally
considered a continuation of the drying trend, but there are undoubtedly punctuations of brief
mesic periods.
The continuing efforts of geologists and paleobotanists have provided more-refined data for the
events leading to the establishment of the regionally modern floral and fauna (Bousman 1991). It
appears there are three periods of greater aridity as represented through increased grass pollen
rates from 5550â1050 B.C., 450 B.C.âA.D. 450, and A.D. 1550â1650 (Kenmotsu et al. 1993).
These data need to be further tested against new regional data sets, but it does offer some insight
into the complexity of the regionâs paleoenvironmental research and may provide a useful backup
for understanding cultural change.

Geoarcheological studies in the Trinity River basin have identified a series of Holocene-age cutand-fill alluvial sequences that seem to correlate across the river basin and potentially correlate
with events identified in the Colorado and Brazos rivers. During the periods of terrace
construction, the vegetation cover (probably grasslands) contributed organic carbon at a rate
faster than sediment deposition, resulting in a series of buried soils and the accumulation of soils
as the terrace treads aggraded. These soils have been named and radiocarbon-dated at several
locales across the Trinity River basin, and a similar phenomenon is likely present in the Sabine
River drainage. The following is an overview of the geomorphic progression for the region.
It is likely that as many as three alloformational stratigraphic units comprise the Holocene terrace
(Ferring 2001:28â39). Each is marked by an erosional unconformity at the top and pedogenic or
soil development. Along the Elm Fork, these consist of the Aubrey Alloformation, dating ca.
14,200 to perhaps 13,400 years ago, at the bottom; the Sanger Alloformation dating between
10,900 and 5,700 years ago; and capped by the Pilot Point Alloformation that dates from 4,525 to
about 700 years ago (Ferring 1990:47â48). The Arlington paleosol developed in the upper part of
the Sanger Alloformation depositional unit, whereas the West Fork paleosol developed in the
Pilot Point Alloformation. In some places, an unnamed recent alluvium measuring up to 1.5
meters (m; 4.9 ft) thick caps the Pilot Point alluvium, and it too has developed a pronounced soil
in some places. The sequence of soils is not as clearly defined for the Sabine River, but this
research from the Trinity River provides a general framework for understanding the phenomena
governing soil formation in the Sabine River basin.

CHAPTER 3
CULTURAL SETTING

This chapter is subdivided into two sections: Previous Investigations and Regional Culture
History. The first section, Previous Investigations, provides an overview of the archeological
research conducted throughout eastern Texas, and emphasizes the Prairie-Savanna Archeological
Study Region, in which Hunt County is included (Kenmotsu et al. 1993). As a result of this
grouping and the paucity of cultural materials in the headwaters of the Sabine River, the culture
history of the East Fork of the Trinity River generally supplants that of Hunt County. The
presentation of the regional culture history in this chapter follows this traditional model, but also
includes a discussion of the unique cultural units associated with Northeast Texas that may be
presently undiscovered in Hunt County. This area is largely unknown archeologically and will
require considerable research to more accurately define.

PREVIOUS INVESTIGATIONS
Archeological research in northeast Texas began in 1911 with the explorations of the Red and
Sulphur rivers by Clarence B. Moore of the Philadelphia Academy of Natural Sciences (Moore
1912). During the late 1910s and 1920s, extensive investigations of the Red and Sulphur rivers
were undertaken by J. E. Pearce of the University of Texas under the auspices of the Bureau of
American Ethnology (Barnard 1939; Guy 1988). Intensive professional and avocational
investigation were initiated in eastern Texas beginning in 1931 with the University of Texas
conducting reconnaissance surveys and excavations at major Caddo sites (Barnard 1939; Davis
1970; Dickson 1941; Gardner 1931; Goldschmidt 1935; Harris 1964; Jackson 1932, 1933, 1935;
Kreiger 1946; Lewis 1987; Miroir n.d.; Pearce 1932; Scurlock 1962, 1965; Suhm et al. 1954;
Turner 1978). Between 1938 and 1941, archeological investigations throughout the country were
funded by the Works Progress Administration and in northeast Texas consisted of excavations at
the Hatchel and Mitchell Farm sites (Creel 1982; Davis 1970).
Following the end of World War II and the establishment of the River Basin Survey, intensive
archeological investigations were focused on proposed reservoirs. Regionally important
examples include Jim Chapman Lake/Cooper Lake (Duffield 1959; Gilmore and Hoffrichter
1964; Harris 1955; Hatzenbuehler 1953; Johnson 1962; Moorman and Jelks 1952) along the
Sulphur River; Lake Lavon (Dawson and Sullivan 1973; Lynott 1975; Stephenson 1949, 1952)
11

and Lake Ray Hubbard (Harris and Suhm 1963; Lorrain and Hoffrichter 1968) along the East
Fork of the Trinity River; Lake Bob Sandlin on Big Cypress Bayou (Driggers 1985; Flaigg 1982;
Herrington 1979; Hsu 1969; McCormick 1973, 1974; Sullivan 1975; Thurmond 1981, 1985); and
Lake Tawakoni (Duffield 1961; Duffield and Jelks 1961; Johnson 1957; Johnson and Jelks 1958;
Skiles et al. 1980; Thurmond 1985) and Lake Fork (Bruseth 1975; Bruseth and Perttula 1981;
Bruseth et al. 1976; Crane 1982; Perttula and Bruseth 1983; Skiles 1978; Skiles et al. 1980;
Skinner 1975a; Thurmond 1985) in the Sabine River basin.
The delay of the construction of Cooper Lake until the 1980s contributed to a more intensive
investigation of Cooper Lake than of other reservoirs. This work was conducted in three phases:
(1) the early investigations mentioned above, (2) a return to Cooper Lake in the 1970s (Doehner
et al. 1978; Doehner and Larson 1978; Hyatt and Doehner 1975; Hyatt and Skinner 1971; Hyatt
et al. 1974), and (3) mitigation efforts in the 1980s and early 1990s (Bailey et al. 1991; Bousman
et al. 1988; Cliff et al. 1994; Fields et al. 1991; Fields et al. 1993; Fields and Gardner 1991;
Gadus et al. 1991; Gadus, Fields, and Bousman 1992; Gadus, Fields, Bousman, and Howard
1992; Jurney and Bohlin 1993; Jurney et al. 1993; Lebo 1988; McGregor and Roemer 1989; Moir
and Jurney 1988; Moir et al. 1989; Perttula 1988a, 1988b, 1989a, 1989b; Shepard et al. 1994;
Winchell et al. 1990). The construction of Cooper Lake also spawned investigations at the White
Oak Creek Mitigation Area slightly downstream along the Sulphur River (Cliff and Peter 1992,
1994; Cliff and Hunt 1995; Cliff, Green, Hunt, Shanabrook, and Peter 1996; Cliff, White, Hunt,
Pleasant, and Shaw 1996; Hunt and Cliff 1998; Largent et al. 1997).
Despite all of this research, three major reports concerning the archeology of the upper Trinity
River basin remain critical to the understanding of the regional culture history (Peter and
McGregor 1988; Prikryl 1987; Yates and Ferring 1986). These three reports aptly summarize the
history of archeological investigations within the upper Trinity River drainage and the culturehistorical framework for the area. Although the combined efforts of professional and avocational
archeologists have resulted in the recording of numerous sites, it is apparent that much research
remains to be done.
The database of project abstracts maintained by the Texas Historical Commission lists 52 projects
for Hunt County. Five of these projects are of special interest due to their proximity to the
current APE. In 1981, the Texas Department of Water Resources (TPWR) conducted an
archeological survey of 2 acres for the Quinlan Water Treatment Plant (Fox 1981). In 1984,
TPWR conducted a survey of a 250-m-long proposed sewer line for the City of Quinlan (Long
1984). No sites were found on either TPWR project. In 1988, William Westbury (1988)
surveyed a proposed water pipeline route between West Tawakoni and Quinlan. No sites were
encountered. In 1992, AR Consultants undertook a survey for the West Munson-QuinlanWeiland 138 Kv Transmission Line (Skinner and Whorton 1992). A small lithic scatter
(41HU46) was discovered during this survey. Most recently, GMI conducted a survey in 2004
for the portion of SH 276 beginning on the western border of this project area stretching
westward for 8.5 miles to the Rockwall/Hunt county line (Phillips et al. 2007). Two low density
twentieth-century sites, 41HU76 and 41UR77, were identified during this survey, both of which
were recommended as ineligible for inclusion in the NRHP or for designation as an SAL.
Other area projects that have occurred near Quinlan are associated with Lake Tawakoni. In 1994,
TPWD conducted archeological investigations of a small portion of the Lake Tawakoni shoreline
(Black et al. 1994). Two sites (41HU39 and 41HU40) were investigated during this work.
During 1997, Galvan Eling Associates, Inc., conducted an intensive survey and geomorphic
12

investigation at Lake Tawakoni State Park. Although six sites (41HU39, 41HU40, 41HU58,
41HU59, 41HU60, and 41HU61) were investigated during the project, all were extensively
disturbed by erosion associated with Lake Tawakoni (Turpin and Caran 1997). In 2006, AR
Consultants surveyed 31 acres in West Tawakoni City Park (Todd 2006a). No sites were
discovered during this investigation. Also in 2006, AR Consultants surveyed the Lake Tawakoni
pipeline through Rockwall, Kaufman, Hunt, and Van Zandt counties (Todd 2006b), and two
historic sites (41FK137 and 41VN123) were discovered.

Paleo-Indian Period
The Paleo-Indian occupation of the upper Trinity River basin is known primarily through
diagnostic projectile points from surface collections or stratigraphically mixed contexts. The
Field Ranch site (Jensen 1968) along the upper Elm Fork is a primary example of typical site
contexts. Clovis and Plainview points are commonly found along both Denton and Clear creeks
in the Cross Timbers. The Lewisville Lake site (Crook and Harris 1957, 1958, 1961) is the bestknown Paleo-Indian site within the region. Although the original radiocarbon dates (ca. 37,000
B.P.) contributed to the significance of the site, more recent work (Stanford 1981) has resolved the
controversy concerning the date of the occupation. It appears that the presence of naturally
occurring lignite as either a fuel in these hearths or an inadvertent inclusion contaminated the
13

radiocarbon samples. Consequently, the usually accepted date of 12,000â10,000 B.P. for Clovisperiod occupation is probably a reasonable estimate for the first human occupation of the region.
Knowledge of the settlement-subsistence strategies used by these early occupants is extremely
limited. However, recent excavations at the Aubrey site, a well-preserved Clovis-period site in
Denton County, has indicated that subsistence efforts did not focus on big-game animals alone;
rather, the entire range of prairie and forest species was used (Ferring 2001). Whether this pattern
of a more generalized foraging subsistence system is characteristic of Clovis adaptations in the
Eastern Woodlands and the focus on now-extinct, big-game species is more characteristic of a
Plains adaptation remains to be documented.
The examination by Story (1990:176â210) of the distributions of finds of Paleo-Indian projectile
points has revealed some interesting spatial and chronological trends. Clovis points cluster along
the Red River, within the Upper Trinity River drainage, and in southeastern Texas. Folsom
points, probably indicative of a plains adaptation are not well represented; rather, Dalton or
Dalton-like points are well represented in the Ouachita Mountains and the adjacent Gulf Coastal
Plain. Story (1990:196) postulates that this concentration may reflect ecological or territorial
factors between 8500 and 7500 B.C. San Patrice points, occurring within the same time span, are
represented but are fewer in number.

Archaic Period
The Archaic period in the region is tentatively dated between 6550 B.C. and A.D. 700. As is true
for many areas, a threefold division of the Archaic period, consisting of Early, Middle, and Late
subperiods, has been applied (Prikryl 1990). Thus, the Early Archaic has been dated from 6550
to 4050 B.C., the Middle Archaic from 4050 to 1550 B.C., and the Late Archaic from 1550 B.C. to
A.D. 700. Archaic remains are usually found in upland settings and are frequently mixed with
later material. In fact, the initial treatment of the Archaic period (Crook and Harris 1952) that
defined the Carrollton and Elam foci was based upon materials from such mixed terrace contexts.
Consequently, these time-space constructs are no longer recognized as being applicable for this
area of Texas (Peter and McGregor 1988; Prikryl 1990; Yates and Ferring 1986). General trends
proposed as characterizations of the Archaic period include an increasing complexity of
settlement systems, increasing population size and density, decreasing mobility, and the
development of distinct group territories (Prikryl 1990; Story 1985:52).
During the Early Archaic (ca. 6550â4050 B.C.), in general, the occurrence of small and widely
distributed sites has been suggested as reflecting high group mobility within large and poorly
defined territories, with a generalized hunting-and-gathering economy (Prikryl 1990; Story
1985:). Unfortunately, Early Archaic occupations in Northcentral Texas are poorly documented,
and no sites with isolated Early Archaic components in this area are known (Prikryl 1990).
Projectile point forms that may be associated with the Early Archaic include Early Split Stemmed
and possibly Angostura points (Prikryl 1990; Story 1990:Figure 31).
In comparison to the Early Archaic, the Middle Archaic period (4050â1550 B.C.) is even less well
known. Fewer sites are known with Middle Archaic components than for any other period, but
the few surface collections available suggest the beginnings of regional cultural differences by the
end of the period (Prikryl 1990). Diagnostic dart points that may be associated with the Middle
Archaic include the Basal Notched group (which includes Calf Creek, Bell, and Andice), Wells,
Dawson, Carrollton, and Bulverde (Prikryl 1990; Story 1990:Figure 31). Recently, the Calvert
14

site (41DN102) at Lake Ray Roberts has provided insight into the Middle Archaic lifeway
(Ferring and Yates 1997:305):
Hearths, a burial, an unmixed assemblage of artifacts and fauna provide new evidence of adaptations to
a drier middle Holocene landscape. Artifact types are similar to those from adjacent regions (Story
1990) suggesting broad cultural interactions. The foraging economy emphasized procurement of small
game and deer. It is assumed that these people were quite mobile, as repeated occupations of the site
during the Middle Archaic period are evident.

Population density may have reached a peak during the Late Archaic period (ca. 1550 B.C.âA.D.
700), as indicated by an apparent increase in the number of sites, a greater distribution of sites
over the landscape, and evidence of decreasing mobility (Prikryl 1990). At the same time, as
group mobility may have become more limited, interregional contact may have also diminished.
If greater spatial dispersal of sites is not a result of sampling error due to unequal destruction or
burial of earlier sites, it may reflect an economic system making increasing use of all available
floral and faunal resources. Throughout the region, Late Archaic period occupation sites are
relatively common in the uplands, and a relatively large number of shallowly buried sites are also
known from the Trinity River flood plain (Ferring 1990a:51). Dart points potentially diagnostic
of the Late Archaic include Castroville, Marshall, Edgewood, Ellis, Trinity, Palmillas,
Yarbrough, Dallas, Godley, Elam, and Gary (Prikryl 1990; Story 1990:Figure 31). This cultural
pattern appears to have persisted into the Late Prehistoric period throughout most of the region.
Investigations at Joe Pool Lake (Peter and McGregor 1988) and Lake Ray Roberts (Ferring and
Yates 1997) indicate that Late Archaic period remains are characterized by assemblages
apparently left by small bands of foraging hunters and gatherers who occupied a locality for a
limited time and then moved to another locality. These sites were apparently reoccupied
numerous times on a seasonal basis. Faunal remains indicate that Late Archaic populations
exploited a mix of prairie, forest, and riparian species, with white-tailed deer, rabbit, turtle, and
mussel being primary food resources (Ferring and Yates 1997:6).

Formative (Early Ceramic and Woodland)
In Northeast Texas there is a major Formative (also called Early Ceramic and Woodland)
presence following the Archaic period, although the recognition and formal definition of this
period are not well-developed (Bell 1984; Jelks 1961; Story 1981; Perttula et al. 1989). It is
undetermined at present if this cultural stage is represented in Hunt County, but Formative
components have been recognized at several sites in the Sulphur and South Sulphur river basins
(Perttula and Nathan 1989). Formative materials recovered during Southern Methodist
University investigations at Cooper Lake are not characterized by the same styles of ceramics as
those found in Formative contexts along the Red River and in southeastern Oklahoma, but are
nonetheless technologically similar (Brown 1971; McGregor 1988). Important Formative sites
within the Red River drainage basin include the Viper Marsh and Mahaffey sites in Oklahoma
and the A.C. Maklin, Cundleff, and T.M. Saunders sites in Texas (Story 1990:298).
The Formative period in the region was a period of increasing sedentism, social complexity, and
potentially, early forms of agriculture. Formative settlement patterns consist of villages and
hamlets on flood plains or terraces of larger streams, and upland logistical components (Jelks
1961; Schambach 1982). Formative burial mounds that contain nonlocal cherts, copper, and
15

ceramics are known along the Middle Sabine, Angelina, Neches, and Red rivers, reflecting wellestablished long-distance trade routes. Although it has often been assumed that plant
domestication occurred during this period, there is presently very little evidence of the use of
domesticated plants during the Formative period within the Red River drainage basin. Only site
41HP137 at Cooper Lake has yielded evidence of domesticates in the form of a squash rind from
a feature that yielded a date of 2090 Â± 30 B.P. (McGregor 1988:8â29). Presently, there are more
questions than answers, and much research is needed to clearly define this period.

Late Prehistoric Period
The beginning of the Late Prehistoric period (ca. A.D. 700â1700) in the upper Trinity River basin
is marked by the initial appearance of arrow points. The A.D. 700 date for the start of this period
is based upon dated contexts for similar material in the Brazos River drainage to the west. Both
Lynott (1977) and Prikryl (1990) propose that the Late Prehistoric period be divided into an early
and a late phase, with the early phase reflecting a continuation of the foraging subsistence system
of the preceding Late Archaic period and the late phase reflecting Southern Plains influences. In
this view, the early phase dates between A.D. 700 and 1200 and is characterized by sand- and
grog-tempered ceramics and by Scallorn, Steiner, Catahoula, and Alba arrow points (Lynott
1977; Prikryl 1990). The late phase dates from A.D. 1200 to 1700 and is associated with the
appearance of Nocona Plain ceramics of the Henrietta focus, various unstemmed triangular points
(e.g., Maud, Fresno, Harrell, Washita), and the Perdiz point (Lynott 1977; Prikryl 1990).
Evidence of horticulture and bison procurement also appears in sites of this period.
Investigations at the Cobb-Pool site (41DL148) at Joe Pool Lake (Peter and McGregor 1988)
have resulted in a reformulation of the Late Prehistoric period. The Cobb-Pool site has yielded
house structures, roasting pits, Alba points, grog-tempered ceramics, and charred corn cupules.
Radiocarbon dates from several features indicate the site was occupied during the late twelfth or
early thirteenth century. Present evidence suggests that the site does not represent an intrusive
Caddo occupation; consequently, a significant adaptive change appears to have occurred, in at
least some areas, during a middle phase of the Late Prehistoric period. It is also likely that
ceramics were not introduced to the region before this time.
In regard to the Late Prehistoric components investigated at Lake Ray Roberts, Ferring and Yates
(1997:305) summarize the results of that research:
There are no woodland-like sites in north central Texas, suggesting that Plains Woodland influence or
contact did not characterize the transition to the Late Prehistoric period. No ceramics were found with
LPI [Late Prehistoric I] assemblages, which have Scallorn, Alba and small Gary points. These appear
to be short-term occupations that took place under conditions of reduced precipitation compared to the
Late Archaic. Except for the replacement of darts with bow-arrow weaponry, these occupations are
essentially similar to the Late Archaic. Regional exchange of technological information, rather than
environmental change, probably is the factor behind the Late Archaic to Late Prehistoric shift.
Late Prehistoric II occupations are characterized by multiple, short-term use of probably logistic sites,
which lack ceramics and architecture. The architectural remains at 41DN102 are the only ones in the
project area. At best, this was a small hamlet, occupied ca. 500â650 yr b.p. No evidence of
horticulture was recovered, and the LPII faunas indicate a foraging strategy that emphasized deer
procurement, and occasionally bison as well. Transport and curation of chert raw materials was about
as frequent as in the LA, and long-distance raw material acquisition (e.g., Edwards, Alibates) is not
16

evidenced. Ceramic traditions are dominated by locally produced shell-tempered wares, which by this
time were being produced in the Southern Plains region generally. As recorded by previous synthesis
(Story 1990), little if any interaction with the Caddoan area is indicated. Thus, the Ray Roberts
prehistoric data suggest that regional traditions emerged at the end of the LP period largely
independent of the Plains or East Texas Woodlands.

In light of these results, the status of the Cobb-Pool site is even more striking. Whether the CobbPool site merely represents a local experiment or reflects a regional adaptive change separate
from that emerging to the north remains to be fully documented; however, recent analysis of a
Native American burial salvaged along Spring Creek (site 41DL373) in Dallas County also
suggests maize consumption. The individual was a female around 50 years old. Radiocarbon
dating indicates that this individual lived between A.D. 1155 and 1275; a carbon isotope ratio
of -17.7 â° suggests that maize was consumed, but it did not form a major part of her diet (Peter
and Clow 1999). These indications of maize consumption contrast with a small grouping of
disturbed human remains recovered from the Harbor Pointe site (41DL369) in Dallas County.
This site, located on Rowlett Creek (a tributary of the East Fork of the Trinity River), yielded
remains of at least four individuals, dated by tree-ring calibrated radiocarbon dates on bone
collagen to cal A.D. 1010 (1035) 1165. No pottery was recovered with these remains, although
shell beads and a shell gorget were present; a carbon isotope ratio of -21.6 â° suggests that the
groupâs diet was not high in maize (Cliff et al. 1996). Given the slightly earlier date of the
Harbor Pointe burials compared to Cobb-Pool and 41DL373, it is possible that maize agriculture
was introduced to the Dallas area ca. A.D. 1200; conversely, this same evidence may indicate that
divergent subsistence patterns were practiced by groups in the Dallas area. Presently, the degree
or extent of Caddo influence in the area is unclear, because there is an ephemeral Caddo
component present within the East Fork of the Trinity River basin that requires further research
(Naumann 2006). Continued research in the Hunt County area maybe able to shed additional
light on this topic.

Caddo Period
The Caddoan period (A.D. 800â1650), succeeding the Formative period, represents the local
fluorescence of Native American culture in Northeast Texas. It is characterized by increasing
levels of population, sedentism, and social complexity. The increasing social complexity is
reflected by the presence of mound-centered villages. An increasing use of tropical cultigens
such as maize and squash is also assumed for this period; however, an increasing number of
flotation analyses have revealed that the dependence on cultigens may be more variable than
commonly thought. Three main population centers are noted for the Caddo population: the
Arkansas, Red, and Neches-Angelina basins (Bell 1984:239; Story 1990:322). Some differences
are noted in the cultural sequences of these basins, with the most glaring difference being the
development of the Spiro site in eastern Oklahoma. Caddo settlement patterns include mound
centers and midden mounds along major drainages, hamlets, villages, and farmsteads on
floodplains and terraces of major tributary streams of the main drainages (Perttula and Nathan
1989). One such mound center, the Harling Morgan Mound (41FN1) in Fannin County was the
westernmost Caddo mound recorded along the Red River. Unfortunately, it has since been
destroyed. One of the critical archeological questions for the region relates to understanding the
level of influence Caddoan culture exerted on the regional local Late Prehistoric populations.
Since so little research has been conducted in Hunt County, further research is required to address
these questions.

Historic-Era Native American Groups
The Historic Indian period dates between A.D. 1700 and 1850 (Prikryl 1993). Prior to the
founding of New Mexico in 1598, the European presence in the Southwest and on the Southern
Plains had been sporadic at best (e.g., Coronado in 1540â1541, the Rodriguez-Chamuscado party
in 1581, Espejo in 1582â1583). Although there are only brief records of journeys through the
area, Spanish influence was never absent from the Southern Plains after 1598, but contact
between Europeans and Native Americans continued to be limited (Hofman 1989; John 1975). It
was not until the beginning of the nineteenth century that the physical presence of Europeans in
this region became commonplaceâthe result of increasingly peaceful relations between the
Spanish in Texas and the Plains Indians to the north and the acquisition of Louisiana by the
United States in 1803. Prior to about 1725â1750, Apache groups appear to have dominated the
western portion of the Southern Plains, known as the High Plains, but after this time, the area was
increasingly controlled by the Comanche and Kiowa. On the eastern portion of the Southern
Plains, within the area now known as the Lower Plains and Northcentral Texas, the Wichita tribes
became dominant (Bell and Bastian 1967; Hofman 1989b:91).
Unfortunately, since good historical documentation is very sparse for the upper Trinity River
basin during the early historic period, it is not clear which specific aboriginal groups occupied the
region at the start of this period. However, the early historic period in Northcentral Texas was a
time of population fluctuation, movement, and amalgamation (Newcomb 1993). Available data
suggest that many, if not all, of the aboriginal occupants of the eastern margin of the Great Plains,
including Northcentral Texas, were Caddoan language speakersâfrom the Arikara in the north to
the Wichita and Kichai in the south. Some researchers suggest that the Socoatino, encountered
by the survivors of the de Soto expedition in the sixteenth century, were Caddoan speakers and
were the same group as the Canohatino, identified by the French in the latter part of the
seventeenth century, who lived âon the Blackland Prairies between the Guadalupe and Trinity
rivers to the east of present-day San Antonio, Austin, and Wacoâ (Newcomb 1993:24). If the
prehistoric occupants of the eastern margin of the plains in Texas were indeed Caddoan speakers,
it would explain how they were absorbed very early by other Caddoan-speaking groups (such as
the Yojuane, Kichai, Tawakoni, Taovayas, Iscani, and Wichita proper) who arrived in the region
in the late seventeenth and early eighteenth centuries. Most of these groups, in turn, amalgamated
to form the historic Wichita Tribe, but some were probably absorbed by the united Caddo Tribes,
and some may even have joined amalgamations of a variety of groups, such as the Tonkawa,
during the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries.
Archeological remains that can be associated with these early historic groups are rare compared
to the remains of earlier periods. Within the upper Trinity River basin, and in the region itself,
little evidence of these historic-era Native American groups has been found, except for a few
Native American sites with European items (Sollberger 1953). Some accounts suggest that, by
the nineteenth century, the area was considered a neutral, shared hunting ground for a number of
tribes (Caldwell and Fitzhugh 1986), but it was likely occupied by Caddoan speakers until the
early nineteenth century (Webb 1952)

Anglo-American Historic Period
Although some authorities believe that Luis de Moscoso may have passed through Northeast
Texas in 1542, Anglo-American interest in the region began with the Freeman-Custis expedition
up the Red River in 1806 (Flores 1984). This expedition was sent by President Jefferson to
18

explore the Louisiana Purchase. By 1814â1815, two settlements, Jonesborough and Pecan Point,
had been established in present-day Red River County (Jordan 1981; Steely 1986; Strickland
1937). Until the mid-1820s, Anglo-American settlement was confined to the Red River, but by
1830, the prairies between the Sulphur River and the Red River began to be colonized (Strickland
1937:99).
Anglo-American settlement of Hunt County began in 1839. Despite the fertile soils present
within the county, cotton production was minimal during the antebellum period due to the
difficulties in transporting the cotton to market; only 22 bales of cotton were produced in 1860.
Instead, the region developed a yeoman farmer economy that aimed for local self-sufficiency.
Due to this type of localized economy, slavery was of minor importance within the county: in
1860, there were 6,053 whites and 577 African Americans living in Hunt County (Texas State
Historical Association [TSHA] 2006).
Opinions regarding secession were evenly divided, with county residents voting 416 to 339 in
favor of secession. Once the decision was made for secession, county residents supported the
new government and many fought in the war. The number of African Americans in Hunt County
grew rapidly during the Civil War, as slave owners from other parts of the South moved their
slaves to Texas, in order to make it more difficult for them to escape and to prevent them from
being confiscated by Union troops. Considerable violence erupted after the warâs end, partially to
repress the newly freed African Americans and partly as feuds between pro-Union and proConfederate forces. Eventually, U. S. Army troops were called in to restore order (TSHA 2006).
Economic conditions improved in the late nineteenth century with the arrival of the railroads in
Northeast Texas. The East Line and Red River Railroad arrived in Greenville in 1876, followed
by the Missouri, Kansas and Texas in 1877, the Santa Fe in 1886, the Cotton Belt in 1887, and
the Texas Midland in 1893 (Webb 1952). In 1882, the Texas Central Railroad purchased land in
southern Hunt County for its Northeastern Branch. The town of Roberts was founded at the
terminus of the Northeastern Branch. The railroad was later extended (as the Texas Midland
Railroad) to Greenville and Paris. In 1892, the railroad abandoned the Roberts depot and founded
a new community, Quinlan, 1.5 miles to the north (TSHA 2001).
Cotton became an important cash crop after the arrival of the railroads. By 1900, over 50,000
bales of cotton were harvested in Hunt County. Many of the farmers, however, did not own the
land they farmed: tenants and sharecroppers formed 31 percent of the farming population in
1880, 58 percent in 1900, and 72 percent in 1930. This prosperity was reflected in the
development of Quinlan, which by 1925 had an elementary school, a high school, and 35
businesses. The Great Depression had an adverse impact on all of Hunt County, but the economy
rebounded in the late 1940s and 1950s. Agriculture remains important, and the effort by Hunt
County in the 1960s to 1980s to attract additional business and population has been only
marginally successful compared to other surrounding counties such as Dallas County (TSHA
2001, 2006)

CHAPTER 4
RESEARCH GOALS AND METHODS

INTRODUCTION
The cultural resources investigations were designed to identify prehistoric and historic
archeological sites and all other cultural resources located within the approximately 2 miles of
new alignment for the SH 276 Bypass at Quinlan in Hunt County, Texas. This work was
undertaken with two primary management goals in mind:
1. to locate cultural resources occurring within the designated survey area
2. to assess the significance of those resources in regard to their potential for inclusion in the
NRHP and for SAL designation
All cultural resources were identified through a program of background research for potential
sites and an intensive pedestrian survey with shovel testing, using the field methods described
below.

BACKGROUND RESEARCH
Prior to undertaking intensive pedestrian survey, historic maps of the area, including the 1934 soil
survey map and 1956 USGS quadrangle, were reviewed. The Texas Historical Commissionâs
Texas Archeological Sites Atlas online electronic records were consulted, in conjunction with a
literature search. These two efforts identified five previously conducted surveys within a 1-mile
radius of the project area (see Chapter 3): a 2-acre survey for the Quinlan Water Treatment Plant
(Fox 1981) and a 250-m-long survey for the proposed Quinlan sewer line (Long 1984), both for
TPWR; survey for a proposed water pipeline route between West Tawakoni and Quinlan
(Westbury 1988); survey for the West Munson-Quinlan-Weiland 138 Kv Transmission Line
(Skinner and Whorton 1992); and the GMI 2004 survey of SH 276 for TxDOT (Phillips et al.
2007). The GMI survey abutted the westernmost edge of the APE and continued westward for
8.5 miles along SH 276 to the Rockwall/Hunt county line. Two sites (41HU76 and 41UR77)
were identified at that time, but only site 41HU76 falls within the 1-mile search radius for this
project. Site 41HU76 is about 450 m (1,500 feet) west of the current project area and is a lowdensity concentration of surface and subsurface historic architectural materials (wire nails) and
21

two domestic items (one piece of clear glass and a white slipped crockery sherd), which are likely
the remains of a small outbuilding dating to the twentieth century. The site was recommended as
ineligible for inclusion in the NRHP or for designation as an SAL.

INTENSIVE PEDESTRIAN SURVEY
Two GMI archeologists conducted pedestrian survey by walking a single transect or two parallel
transects, as determined by the Project Archeologist. On single transects, shovel tests were
excavated in leapfrog fashion, and on parallel transects each archeologist excavated shovel tests
along the transect. Prior to fieldwork, the APE was translated from a CADD file into a Shapefile
and was then uploaded onto a Trimble global positioning system (GPS) backpack unit. This
Trimble unit was referenced during fieldwork to determine and document the location of shovel
tests since the proposed route was not clearly marked on the ground. Upon completion of
fieldwork, collected GPS data were downloaded and used as the basis for the maps presented in
this report. The Project Archeologist maintained field notes that documented survey conditions,
vegetation cover, area covered daily, and initial interpretations of cultural properties, and kept a
photograph log that documented each photograph taken.
Examination of topographical maps, basic knowledge of regional archeological site distribution
patterning, and visual inspection of the landforms at the time of survey in combination with the
observed soil profiles from shovel tests formed the basis for determining the intensity of
investigation and the placement of judgmental shovel tests within the project area. The entire
project area is considered to be of low probability because it is composed almost entirely of
upland deposits. Therefore, it was recommended that shovel tests be judgmentally placed, but in
accordance with current survey standards for linear projects (e.g., a minimum of 16 shovel tests
per linear mile) as approved by the Texas Historical Commission. It was also agreed that shovel
tests would be excavated in areas where ground cover hindered site detection or in areas of high
site probability such as along creek margins. Should areas along the project corridor be identified
as having been previously altered or impacted (e.g., urban sprawl, buried utilities, highway
construction, etc.) or exhibiting large areas of bedrock at the surface, shovel tests were not
excavated but the areas were photo-documented. All excavated shovel test units were recorded
with a GPS unit to ensure accurate placement on a map of the survey area. During fieldwork, all
exposed surface areas such as road cuts, animal burrows, and plowed fields were closely
inspected for cultural material.
A total of 56 shovel tests was excavated during this survey. The location of each shovel test was
recorded as a GPS point throughout the survey area. The 56 excavation units exceed the
minimum of 32 shovel tests required by Texas Historical Commission guidelines for a project of
this size and configuration. In all cases, shovel tests measured approximately 30 cm in diameter
and were excavated either to the top of the Bt-horizon (subsoil) or to 80 cm below ground
surface. The soil from each shovel test was screened through 0.635-cm (0.25-in) hardware cloth,
and each shovel test was backfilled.
No artifactual material and no archeological sites were identified during this present survey.
Nonetheless, had cultural resources been encountered, GMI would have followed standard
procedures to delineate site boundaries. When a cultural artifact is encountered, either surface or
subsurface, a series of four shovel tests in a cruciform pattern (one in each cardinal direction)
around the initial find is excavated. If no further cultural remains are located, the original artifact
is recorded as an isolated find (or locality), photographed, recorded in field notes, and plotted on
applicable topographic maps, and the survey continues.
22

If cultural material is located in any of the additional shovel tests, the find is recorded as a site,
and shovel testing continues in the cruciform pattern until two sterile shovel tests are encountered
to fully delineate the site extent within the project corridor. The additional shovel tests are used
to obtain estimates of the site depth, contents, and integrity. Site designation is applied only to
clusters of surface artifacts (i.e., greater than 10 artifacts), clusters of subsurface artifacts (two or
more positive shovel tests), or significant architectural properties. Each recorded site is identified
with a permanent datum marker consisting of a 5/8-inch-diameter metal rebar stake placed on the
site. This marker is topped with an aluminum cap bearing the siteâs temporary GMI field
number, and the site datum location is recorded using GPS. A scaled pace-and-compass map
with shovel test locations, cultural and topographic features, generalized contour intervals, and
vegetation boundaries is prepared. The site is photographed from several viewpoints with a
digital camera; any damage from vandalism, construction, or earth disturbances is also photodocumented. These photographs are recorded in a photo log. A State of Texas site recording
form is prepared, noting locational information, vegetation cover, contextual integrity, estimated
period of occupation, and artifactual material (both surface and subsurface). The site location is
plotted on the appropriate project and topographic maps.
All artifacts recovered from shovel tests on both site and nonsite (isolated occurrence) areas are
collected. Wherever possible, limited surface collections of temporally and/or functionally
diagnostic artifacts are also made to expand the sample of materials used in evaluating the
cultural affiliation, age, and other research-potential issues about the site.
ARTIFACT ANALYSIS
No artifactual material was recovered during this project. However, had material been found, all
artifacts would have been transported to the GMI laboratory, processed, and analyzed. In the
laboratory, all artifactual material is subjected to standard procedures. Each artifact is cleaned,
labeled, and analyzed for specific traits. Artifacts are first divided into prehistoric, historic, and
ecofact (faunal bone, shell, charcoal, wood, seed) categories, and then further subdivided into
prehistoric lithic or ceramic subcategories; historic use subcategories; and ecofact type
subcategories.
Prehistoric lithics are analyzed for specific attributes, defining chipped stone tools (biface
[including projectile points], uniface, edge modified flake, utilized/modified cobble tool),
debitage (flake, shatter, core), and ground stone (mano, metate, pestle, pendant, etc.). Prehistoric
ceramics are analyzed for identification of vessel portion (body, rim, base), temper, decoration,
etc., to allow placement of each sherd into named types when possible, or to define a ceramic
fragment as baked clay or daub.
Ecofacts represent material onsite that was likely altered in some way to reflect human
occupation. Such material may be shell, faunal bone, or seed representing food consumption or
personal decoration, charcoal remains from hearths, wood remains used as food, shelter, or fuel.
When possible, ecofacts are analyzed to the species level to help in determining specific time
periods of site occupation.
Historic materials are analyzed to determine objects for domestic (e.g., ceramics, glass, tableware,
lamp fragments), architectural (nails, brick, window glass), activities (farm-, transportation-,
weapons-related), or personal (e.g., doll/doll parts, perfume bottles, comb) consumption.
Unidentifiable fragments of metal and glass are classified as âunidentifiedâ and simply counted as
present among the assemblage.
23

After analyses of artifactual material are complete, all recorded attributes for each artifact are
entered into an ACCESS database on an IBM network system. Computer printouts are compiled
and archived with the permanent project files.

CURATED MATERIAL
Although no artifacts were recovered, all records and materials generated from this project were
returned to the GMI laboratory facilities in Plano, Texas, and labeled or recorded in compliance
with TARL standards. All documents and materials related to this project will be permanently
curated at the Texas Archeological Research Laboratory (TARL) in Austin, Texas, upon
completion of the project (Appendix A).

CHAPTER 5
SURVEY RESULTS

INTRODUCTION
As a result of the present survey, a total of 56 shovel tests was excavated within the newly
proposed alignment for the SH 276 Bypass; no archeological sites were documented. Several
properties investigated contained occupied or recently vacated buildings not indicated on the
property maps provided by the client, but these buildings are all of modern origin and classified
as nonsite localities. In addition, examination of topographical maps, basic knowledge of
regional archeological site distribution patterning, and visual inspection of the landforms at the
time of survey in combination with the observed soil profiles from shovel tests formed the basis
for determining the intensity of the investigation and the placement of judgmental shovel tests
within the project area. The entire project area is considered to be of low probability because it is
composed almost entirely of upland deposits and have been impacted by road-building activities,
utility construction, private development, and erosion.
This chapter provides an overview of the survey corridor, work conducted, and a brief discussion
of the findings by segment of corridor beginning from the west end and continuing to the east.
Following this discussion is a presentation of the nonsite localities by area and individual
property.

OVERVIEW OF SURVEY CORRIDOR
At the time of this survey, the entire survey corridor was still in private hands; none of the land
had been obtained by the state. Though a full parcel map of landowners was not available, an
aerial map indicating the parcels where right-of-entry (ROE) access had been granted was
supplied by the district before going to the field; this was a partial list of all landowners.
Likewise, several locations within the project corridor were not accessible due to ROE
restrictions (Figure 2). Three of these inaccessible areas spanned the entire width of the project
corridor, providing convenient points to subdivide the survey into segments. Hence, the survey
was subdivided into four separate areas, lettered sequentially from A to D (Table 2), beginning
from the westernmost terminus of the project corridor (see Figure 2). These four areas are
composed of one or more individual properties, with each property requiring different survey
treatment predicated on their observed condition.
25

Area A
Survey Area A was assigned to the Binary Ranch property and began at the westernmost terminus
of the project corridor and continued to the western boundary of Inaccessible Area #1 (see Figure
2). A total of 33 shovel tests was excavated in this segment; no cultural resources were found.
After some initial difficulty gaining access to the property because of the high fence surrounding
the ranch perimeter, ranch foreman Mr. Demko granted entry. Mr. Demko revealed that the
section of property paralleling SH 276 had been extensively impacted by previous road
construction activities. He related that the ranch allowed TxDOT to use the nearby hills along the
northern border of the ranch to borrow soil for the road in return for grading and pond-building
activities. This information was confirmed through excavation of shovel tests paralleling SH 276
that mostly indicated disturbed contexts (Figure 3).
The section of property beginning at the point where the proposed SH 276 corridor splits from the
present location of SH 276 and turns to the southeast revealed intact deposits. This area also
passes through the northern dendritic reaches of Jones Creek, which has been recently
channelized. The soils in this area were the typical upland soils of the area (Figure 4).

Inaccessible Area #1
The first inaccessible location was likely used as grazing property at some point in the past.
There was no visible evidence of any cultural remains at the time of survey. The property is
extremely level and lies entirely in the uplands. Presumably, it contains shallow upland soils,
based on the results of shovel tests immediately to the west and east (Figure 5). Because of its
upland position and based on adjacent shovel tests, the area has a low potential for yielding
cultural materials.

Area B
Survey Area B was assigned to the area containing the Figueroa, Epperson, Three Feathers Farm,
B. and P. Taylor, J. and G. Taylor, Gaona, Jones, Lowers, and Young properties and spanned the
distance between the Inaccessible Area #1 and Inaccessible Area #2. This segment includes the
properties surrounding the east-to-west running segment of CR 2300, and the properties to its
west and east (see Figure 2). A total of 19 shovel tests was excavated in this area. These shovel
tests indicated the majority of the area was intact and sterile, but there were four different
properties observed in this area containing disturbances. These properties are discussed, in turn,
beginning from west to east.
The Figueroa and Epperson properties are on a continuation of the landform observed in the
eastern portion of Area A and assumedly in Inaccessible Area #1. The area is an intact upland
dominated by upland sandy loams or sandy clay loams and is sterile for cultural material. Several
barbed wire fences were observed, including one associated with a pushpile and rotting fence
posts (Figure 6), but no evidence of any structures were observed on either property.

The section of the Epperson property paralleling the northern side of CR 2300 is largely
disturbed. The construction of CR 2300 and associated utilities along the north side of this road
has adversely impacted sediments in this location (Figure 7). In addition to the byproducts of
utility construction, overgrown two-track roads run through this section of the property (Figure 8)
associated with push piles.

The B. and P. Taylor property occupies the easternmost portion of the north side of CR 2300.
The property has a well-manicured lawn with several large trees on its eastern boundary. A
judgmental shovel test in this area was intact but sterile with an overlying layer of fill, likely a
result of road building activities for CR 2300 (Figure 9).
The Three Feather Ranch property parallels the entire stretch of the southern boundary of CR
2300 and continues eastward to the upper western edge of the second intermittent creek basin.
The section of property immediately adjacent to CR 2300 is dominated by a line of old oak trees
and was considered to have a high potential of yielding cultural materials (Figure 10). As a
result, four shovel tests were conducted along this tree line. One produced a piece of modern
barbed wire fencing; the remaining units revealed intact but sterile deposits.

The area east of CR 2300 is roughly divided into two halves by an east-to-west running power
line that serves as a boundary for several properties. The property north of the power line to the
east of CR 2300 is owned by J. and G. Taylor. This property contains a well-manicured lawn,
and two judgmental shovel tests were excavated near two separate old stands of trees (Figure 11).
These two shovel tests both indicated intact upland soils but were sterile.

Figure

11.

Area B: overview of J. and G. Taylor property from eastern property boundary

Figure 11. Area B: overview of J. and G. Taylor property from eastern property boundary.

A small area to the east of the J. and G. Taylor property is inaccessible, but it does not stretch
across the entire corridor. The area to the south of this area is owned by N. Gaona and is
composed of the western terrace edge of the second unnamed dendritic creek associated with
Jones Creek. The area is completely overgrown with thick vegetation, including numerous large
old oak trees, which increased its initial potential for yielding cultural resources. A total of two
shovel tests was excavated on this property, both of which were sterile but indicated intact upland
deposits (Figure 12).
The unnamed creek in this area runs from northeast to southwest through the project corridor and
occupies a more extensive area than expected due its configuration (Figure 13). The creek bed
itself is choked with recent alluvial sediment and a gradually rising flood plain is observed on its
eastern side. The western side is more typical of an upland creek because it has steeply sloping
sides. The Jones property abuts the eastern portion of the creek.

The Jones property is a corner lot occupying the west side of a âTâ intersection involving CR
2333 and an unnamed private drive extending northward from it across the project corridor. Mrs.
Jones provided extensive information about the property, including a history of their recent
construction of a log cabin kit home, garage, and associated outbuildings. This property contains
Locality #1, discussed later in this chapter. Upon review of the property and the excavation of a
shovel test along its western border, it was clear the soil was disturbed due to the construction that
is also likely the cause for the perceived gently sloping eastern creek bank (Figure 14).

The Lowers property lies across the unnamed private drive to the east of the Jones property. It is
a lot containing a mobile home, two vehicles, and an Aqua Texas pump station (Figure 15). The
western portion of the property is disturbed despite the existence of large oak trees; the eastern
portion contains intact sterile upland deposits. The property contains Locality #2, discussed
further in the next section. Survey Area B ends on the eastern border of this property due to ROE
restrictions.
A small section of property directly to the north of the Lowers property and owned by a Young is
composed almost entirely of a large erosional gulley. The property was photographed, but no
shovel tests were excavated due to this disturbance (Figure 16).

Inaccessible Area #2
This inaccessible location is a small fenced-in section of property that is used for grazing. The
area lies entirely in the uplands and based on the results of surrounding investigations, it is
considered to have a low potential for yielding cultural materials (Figure 17).

Area C
Survey Area C is composed of the Sexton property on the west side of Spur 264, and a small
section of Quinlan ISD property on the east side of Spur 264 (see Figure 2). After speaking with
Mrs. Sexton, it was apparent that her property has been extensively disturbed. She described the
land use of the property as being a combination of filled-in pit from graveling operations, a
location for family disposal, and grazing. A single judgmental shovel test was excavated at the
edge of the APE confirming this suspicion, as a cigarette wrapper as recovered 30 cm below
surface. The property contains Locality #3, discussed later in this chapter.
The small section of Quinlan ISD property is located adjacent to a baseball diamond (Figure 18).
One shovel test excavated in this location was sterile, but indicated an intact sequence of upland
soils. The properties to the south and east are inaccessible and mark the end of Survey Area C.

Inaccessible Area #3
The final inaccessible location due to ROE restrictions in this project corridor occupies the entire
corridor between the Quinlan ISD property and the Hickman property. ROE was secured for the
Hickman property, but the area to the north of it and the power line from this point to the western
border of the Skirmish, LLC, property is restricted. The area to the west of the Hickman property
(Figure 19) contains one residence and a section of pasture. The residence appears to be modern,
and no other structures lie within the APE on that property. The soils within Inaccessible Area #3
are assumed to be similar to those observed on each side of it: that is, sterile shallow upland soils
interspersed with patches of Houston Black clay. The eastern extension of this inaccessible area
north of the Hickman property appears to be disturbed as a result of utility construction that
included pushpiles and a small excavated pond (Figure 20). The entirety of this inaccessible area
has a low potential for yielding cultural resources.

Area D
Survey Area D is composed of three properties near the eastern terminus of the APE (see Figure
2). The two easternmost properties are the J. and L. Whitehead property occupied by a strip mall,
and the Skirmish, LLC, property occupied by an Exxon gas station. These two properties are
classified as Localities #4 and #5, respectively, discussed in greater detail in the next section of
this chapter. The Hickman property contains the only intact sediments as observed through two

LOCALITIES
A locality is considered to represent an ephemeral use area lacking substantial cultural materials
or to be of modern affiliation and consequently fails to meet the criteria for a site. Localities are
not assessed for eligibility for inclusion in the NRHP or for designation as an SAL, but are
documented in reports. A total of five localities was documented during this survey, and they are
discussed in turn beginning with the westernmost locality and concluding with the easternmost
(see Figure 2). The following presents a brief discussion of each locality, which is summarized in
Table 3.

Locality #1 (Area BâJones Property)
The eastern boundary of the Jones property is situated along the western edge of a deadâend,
private road extending northward from CR 2333 (see Figure 2). The Joneses purchased the
property and constructed a kit log home, a shop, and several outbuildings such as a garage in the
late 1990s (Mrs. Jones, personal communication 2007) before being notified of the pending
construction of the SH 276 Bypass. Construction of these buildings has adversely impacted the

integrity of the deposits on this property (see Figure 14). One shovel test along the western edge
of the property indicated the area contained mixed deposits resulting from the combination of
recent alluvium and disturbed sediment from construction activities.

Locality #2 (Area BâLowers Property)
The Lowers property lies to the east of the Jones property and across the dead-end private road
(see Figure 2). The property is presently unoccupied (Mrs. Jones, personal communication 2007)
but two structures are extant: a dilapidated mobile home and an Aqua Texas pump station (see
Figure 15). The mobile home is surrounded by modern trash and construction debris. Two
vehicles of unknown functionality are in a driveway near the mobile home. The Aqua Texas
pump station is assumed to be functional based on the constant whirring noise emitted from
within the building. Two shovel tests on this property indicated the western portion was
disturbed, and the east side of the property was sterile.

Locality #3 (Area CâSexton Property)
The Sexton property is located along the western margin of Spur 264 (see Figure 2). The
property has been used as a personal family disposal site, a gravel pit, and grazing lands (Mrs.
Sexton, personal communication 2007). An occupied double-wide mobile home presently sits on
the westernmost portion of the property (see Figure 17). A second mobile home in the
southwestern corner of the property is used as temporary hay storage for four horses (Figure 22).
A filled-in gravel pit is near the center of the property, partially underneath a huge burn pile
composed of furniture and construction debris (Figure 23). One shovel test placed outside the
boundary of the APE indicated extensive disturbance, as modern cigarette wrappers were
observed at 20â30 cm below surface.

Locality #4 (Area DâWhitehead Property)
The Whitehead property is located at the eastern terminus of the project area along the western
edge of SH 34 (see Figure 2). The property has been developed into a modern strip mall with a
large U-shaped driveway and parking lot (Figure 24). The rear of the property contains a borrow
pit and a spoil pile assumed to be related to the construction of the strip mall (Figure 25). The
entire property has been adversely impacted as a result of this construction activity.

SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS

The archeological survey of the 2 miles of new alignment for the SH 276 Bypass was designed to
investigate the project area for previously undocumented cultural resources, reassess any
previously recorded archeological sites within the project area, and collect sufficient data for the
evaluation of the eligibility of each property for inclusion in the National Register of Historic
Places and for designation as a State Archeological Landmark. No archeological sites were found
during this survey, but five nonsite localities were documented (see Chapter 5). This chapter
provides a more detailed discussion of the NRHP and SAL criteria and presents recommendations
for future treatment of these resources.

ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA

Eligibility for Inclusion in the NRHP
âHistoric propertyâ means any prehistoric or historic district, site, building, structure, or object included
in or eligible for inclusion in the National Register. This term includes . . . artifacts, records, and
remains that are related to and located within such properties. The term âeligible for inclusion in the
National Registerâ includes both properties formally determined as such by the Secretary of the Interior
and all other properties that meet National Register listing criteria [36 CFR 800.2].

The cultural resources discussed in this report were evaluated according to criteria based on
federal regulations for determining the significance of those resources for inclusion in the NRHP.
Determinations of eligibility for inclusion in the NRHP are applied following the identification of
relevant historical themes and related research questions:
The quality of significance in American history, architecture, archeology, and culture is present in
districts, sites, buildings, structures, and objects that possess integrity of location, design, setting,
materials, workmanship, feeling, and association, and:
(a) that are associated with events that have made a significant contribution to the broad patterns
of our history; or
(b) that are associated with the lives of persons significant in our past; or

47

(c) that embody the distinctive characteristics of a type, period, or method of construction, or that
represent a significant and distinguishable entity whose components may lack individual
distinction; or
(d) that have yielded, or may be likely to yield, information important in prehistory or history [36
CFR Â§ 60.4].

Usually, Criterion âdâ is applied to most prehistoric and many historic sites. Important
information is generally recognized to refer to scientific importance. However, scientific
importance is partially driven by the research perspectives of the time and in part by the state of
available information regarding a particular research topic in a specific research area. The
purpose for conducting archeology should not be to fill museum drawers with relics, but rather to
fill informational gaps relating to specific research domains. As research progresses within a
region, well-excavated sites contribute information to some of those research domains. Through
time, data needs for some research questions may be addressed to various degrees, even though
complementary data are often needed from different periods, seasons, settings, and site types to
fully understand the diversity of activities. As data required to address specific questions
approach redundancy, such information may diminish the priority of that kind of repetitive
information needed from nearby sites. This suggests that the identification criteria of important
historic properties are tied to both a specific geographical area, reflecting a cultural adaptation or
region, and a state of accumulated knowledge about a research domain. Archeological sites with
integrity containing artifacts and features that can contribute information toward addressing
research issues are regarded as significant and are eligible for inclusion in the NRHP.
Archeological sites that exist on static landforms, such as bedrock surfaces or ancient upland
hilltops that lack eolian sands, can contain concentrated densities of artifacts and feature remains.
Such âpalimpsestâ remains of occupations are generally regarded as having very little or no
research potential for contributing useful information toward the understanding of prehistory,
because the artifact assemblages are mixed and not interpretable. In such cases, the sites are not
regarded as scientifically important, and in general, these kinds of sites are not eligible for
inclusion in the NRHP.
The most ideal kinds of archeological remains are those left in rapidly aggrading settings, where
there is a chance for non-cultural sediments to separate a series of materials and residues
representing brief, short-term activities. Usually, aggrading alluvial, wind-blown or eolian sand
sheets and dunes, and sometimes colluvial slopewash are the kinds of settings and events that are
apt to quickly bury archeological remains and preserve the discreteness of activities. The
evaluation of the depositional potential is one of the key characteristics for distinguishing the
integrity of deposits.
Information is useless in a vacuum. Thus, the first criterion of significance for any archeological
property within the APE is considered to be its capability to yield relevant information. Whether
or not specific archeological properties exhibit such potential or contain data relevant to any
particular historic context or research theme is dependent upon a precondition of contextual
integrity of the archeological deposits. For example, a prehistoric site buried by sediment within
an aggrading river levee has a far greater potential for containing undisturbed deposits than one
located on an eroding upland surface. The nature of contextual integrity as it affects research
potential of a property, must, however, also be viewed as relative, since different research
problems require different types of data.

48

Eligibility for Inclusion in the SAL Program
At the state level, archeological sites may be considered significant and be recognized or
designated as an SAL, provided that at least one of the following conditions is met:
1. The archeological site is situated on lands owned or controlled by the State of Texas or one of its
political subdivisions; or
2. The archeological site is situated on private lands which has been specifically designated as an SAL
. . . and fits at least one of the following criteria:
(A) Preservation of materials must be sufficient to allow application of standard archeological
techniques to advantage;
(B) The majority of artifacts are in place so that a significant portion of the siteâs original
characteristics can be defined through investigation;
(C) The site has the potential to contribute to cumulative culture history by the addition of new
information;
(D) The site offers evidence of unique or rare attributes; and/or
(E) The site offers a unique and rare opportunity to test techniques, theory, or methods or
preservation, thereby contributing to scientific knowledge [Texas Natural Resources Code
1977; Title 9, Chapter 191, Texas Antiquities Committee, Section 191.094 and Chapter 41.7,
Antiquities Code of Texas].

The 2 miles of newly proposed alignment for the SH 276 Bypass at Quinlan is being developed
by TxDOT, whose existence is due to State of Texas enabling legislation. Thus, the condition as
an entity of the State of Texas means that the first condition of the SAL designation is met. The
five criteria of the second condition are very generalized, occasionally ambiguous, and might
apply to virtually any archeological site. For example, the first criterion of sufficient preservation
of materials to âallow application of standard archeological techniques to advantageâ is vague as
to the meaning of the use of âtechniques to advantage.â Clearly, some kinds of surface recording
techniques could be applied to preserved chipped stone remains in a highly disturbed and shallow
archeological site for the advantage of illustrating methods in a classroom teaching exercise. But
we would argue that without some degree of context, such sites are neither worthy of nor warrant
SAL designation simply because they contain archeological remains. We tend to place greater
emphasis on the SAL criteria for sites with integrity (criterion B), addition of new information
(criterion C), and/or unique or rare attributes (criterion D), over the criteria for the preservation
sufficient to apply archeological techniques (criterion A) or the mere opportunity to test
techniques, theories, and methods (criterion E). In so doing, the SAL criteria strongly resemble
the NRHP criteria involving the criteria of site integrity and potential to contain information
significant to prehistory or history.

RECOMMENDATIONS
Roughly 70 percent of the proposed new alignment for the SH 276 Bypass near Quinlan was
investigated through intensive pedestrian survey and shovel testing. No archeological sites or
cultural materials were found within the investigated areas. The remaining portions of the project
corridor were inaccessible because of lack of entry rights. The inaccessible areas, however, have
little or no potential for yielding cultural materials based on observations and extrapolations made
from data collected from neighboring properties. Additionally, review of historic maps showed
no potential for historic structures within the project corridor. Investigations did, however,
identify five nonsite localities that are structures of modern affiliation or less than 50 years in age
and are considered to have no research potential.
49

In accordance with 36 CFR 800.4, GMI has made a reasonable and good faith effort to identify
archeological historic properties within the APE. Shallow soil conditions and development
disturbance extant in the unsurveyed portions of the APE suggest that any sites potentially present
in these areas would not contain the data resources necessary to warrant NRHP (36 CFR 60.4) or
SAL (13 TAC Â§ 26.8) eligibility. Therefore, construction of the proposed SH 276 Bypass at
Quinlan will have no adverse effect on any historic properties, and no further cultural resources
investigations are recommended for the project area.
