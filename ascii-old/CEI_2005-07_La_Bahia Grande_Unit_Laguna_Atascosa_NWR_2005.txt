Abstract

An archaeological survey within the Bahia Grande Unit of the Atascosa National
Wildlife Refoge was conducted by Coastal Environments, Inc. under contract with Ocean
Trust The survey, carried out under ARPA Permit No. LA-04-020, involved pedestrian
inspection of ground along the center lines of proposed channel excavations. Where
ground surface visibility was obscured by vegetation cover, hand-dug shovel tests were
excavated to test for subsurface archaeological materials. The survey results indicate that
low-lying mud flat areas are devoid of archaeological materials and sites. Remnants of
an historic railroad bed and two prehistoric sites were found within the survey area, both
situated at or above five feet above mean sea level on or within cumulic, eolian clay dune
sediments. Both sites were previously recorded by A E. Anderson, an avocational
archaeologist from Brownsville, Texas. Site 41CF138 (Anderson Site #00.9) is on a clay
dune that barely impinges on the right of way of proposed Channel A This site was
evidenced only by sporadic small burned clay nodules and scattered rabdotus land snail
shells. Site 41CF136 (Anderson Site #2. 7) was noted as a scatter of artifacts and fish
otoliths that extended for some 500-600 meters along the eroded edge of clay dune
sediments along the eastern shoreline of Bahia Grande. Inspection of the site indicated
that these materials had eroded from a thin archaeological zone within the dune at 210230 cm below the present surface. Materials collected include two Tortugas dart points,
four shell artifacts, and 31 fish otoliths, mostly from black drum (Pogonias cromis). The
range of materials found and their vertically discrete source within cumulic clay dune
sediments initially suggested that this site might be eligible for listing on the National
Register of Historic Places and as a State Archeological Landmark. However, farther
carefol inspection of this site, requested by the US. Fish and Wildlife Service and
discussed in the Appendix of this report, indicated that cultural materials are very diffose
within the source clay dune and that their relative concentration on the swash zone is
merely the result of natural winnowing processes. Based on these observations, a revised
conclusion is that subsurface excavation would produce little usefol information and for
this reason the site should not be considered likely to be eligible for the National
Register. No further archaeological work is recommended. Materials collected are
curated at the Texas Archeological Research Laboratory, The University of Texas at
Austin .

The Area
The Bahia Grande Unit of the Laguna Atascosa National Wildlife Refuge is part
of the Rio Grande Delta area, both in terms of its biophysical environment and as an
archaeological area. Topography is low and nearly flat, with the significant exception of
the many clay dunes that are found along shorelines. Within the Bahia Grande Unit are
almost entirely enclosed shallow lagoonal areas and associated wind-tidal flats (i.e.,
Bahia Grande, Laguna Larga and Laguna Madre). The surrounding level terrain,
generally around 5 ft (1.5 m) or less above mean sea level (MSL), is part of the extensive
sediment deposit that comprises the Rio Grande Delta. The many long, relatively narrow
clay dunes are adjacent and parallel to the lagoona! shorelines and rise 5-10 m above the
surrounding land surface .
Vegetation in the area is generally sparse, reflecting climatic aridity. With the
exception of algae, the tidal flats are barren. Various grasses and salt-tolerant weeds are
found on the level deltaic plain. Clay dunes support dense stands of scrub trees, most
commonly mesquite. Margins of the clay dunes are extensively eroded, exposing
geologic (and potentially archaeologically relevant) soil/sediment profiles .
Land animal species native to the district occur in all non-inundated areas.
Terrestrial fauna particular to the study region include several species of snake, including
the speckled racer (Drymobius margaritiferus), the black-striped snake (Coniophanes
imperialis), and the Mexican hooknose snake (Ficimia streckeri).
Also from the
Tamaulipan zone only, the Texas tortoise (Gopherus berlandier) is known. There are
also several species of lizards in this pronouncedly reptilian fauna! assemblage.
Amphibians are rare, however (even on the mud flats, due to frequent droughts), and
include the black-spotted newt (Notophthalmus meridionalis). Mammals endemic and
unique to the area tend to be small rodents, including the Mexican spiny pocket mouse
(Liomys irroratus) and the Coue's rice rat (Oryzomys couesi) .
Geologic History
The Bahia Grande Unit, as seen today, is the result of physical processes active
since the end of the Pleistocene. During the last glacial maximum, ca. 20,000 years
before present (b.p.), global sea level was 100 or more meters below its present position,
and the Gulf shoreline was some 80 km east of its present location. The Rio Grande thus
flowed in a broad valley eastward across the now-submerged continental shelf (Brown et
al. 1980). As sea level rose during the Holocene (after ca. 11,000 b.p.), the lower reaches
of the Rio Grande valley were inundated by transgressive marine waters, ultimately
forming a long embayment that extended some 45 km inland from the present shoreline .
By the middle Holocene, the Rio Grande was depositing alluvial sediments and
infilling the embayed valley and eventually creating prograding delta lobes that, at their
maximum extent, reached some 15 km east of the present shoreline. As sea level reached
its modern position by ca. 3, 000 b. p., erosion by wave action reworked the deltaic lobes,
pushing them landward. Wave action and longshore drift combined to deposit near-shore
sediments that formed south Padre Island, which ultimately coalesced with northern
Padre Island to largely separate lower Laguna Madre from the open Gulf of Mexico .

speculated on a trade network between the native hunting-gathering-fishing populations
of the Delta area and lower Rio Grande and the intensively agricultural peoples of the
Huastecan area (cf. Eckholm 1944; MacNeish 1958). Hester (1995) has suggested that
the many marine-shell ornaments found in surface collections from the Rio Grande Delta
may reflect intensive production and exchange for Huastecan pots, obsidian and limited
quantities of jadeite ornaments .
The only consistently used cultural-historical term applied to prehistoric
archaeology of the Texas portion of the Delta area is that of the "Brownsville Complex"
(MacNeish 1958; Hester 1969, 1980, 1995; Bousman et al. 1990; Ricklis 1995; Ricklis
and Weinstein 2005). Very generally, the term designates an assemblage of artifacts
surface collected from area sites (mostly by A E. Anderson betweem 1908 and the
1930s) and, to a more limited degree, reported from cemetery burials (e.g., Hester 1969,
1980), consisting of a variety of marine shell ornaments, tools manufactured from
conches and other marine shells, bone beads and other ornaments, diminutive chipped
stone tools such as scrapers and drills or perforators, and small, thin triangular and
subtriangular arrow points. No indigenous ceramics are ascribed to the Brownsville
Complex, though, as mentioned, sherds and some whole vessels ofHuastecan pottery are
reported in limited quantities. Generally the Brownsville Complex has been thought to
fall into the Late Prehistoric period (after ca. AD. 1000 or so), though recently acquired
radiocarbon dates on certain human burials from the lower Rio Grande valley may
establish a direct antecedent in the preceding Archaic period (T. Terneny, pers. comm .
2003). Aside from the information provided by extensive surface collection and a limited
number of human burials, little is understood about the lifeways or adaptive patterns of
the people who left behind the Brownsville Complex materials .
Earlier cultures are even less well understood. Occasional archaeological
investigations (e.g., Prewitt 1974; Mallouf et al. 1977; Collins et al. 1989; Bousman et al.
1990; Eling et al. 1993) have produced evidence for human occupation during the
Archaic period. Stone tools and dart point forms have been noted. A very limited
number of radiocarbon dates have been reported from camp and burial sites that place
occupation as far back as at least ca. 3,500 b.p. (e.g., Collins et al. 1989). Only very
limited information on Archaic artifact assemblages and zooarchaeological data is
available, though a generalized hunter-gathering, and in places fishing, subsisitence
economy appears to be indicated. Despite the limited data gathered on early subsistence
practices, the potential for using analysis of fish otoliths for seasonality of fishing and
shoreline site occupation was successfully tested at the Horse Island Site to the north of
the Bahia Grande Unit (Eling et al. 1993). This analytical technique, which has proven
highly useful farther north along the Texas coast (e.g., Ricklis 1996; Weinstein 2002) can
surely be well utilized in the Rio Grande Delta.
At this point, then, the research issues in the Rio Grande Delta area that need
investigation are quite fundamental, and it is the potential for a given archaeological site
to address these issues that should form, in large part, the basis for site assessment of
potential eligibility to the NRHP. These basic issues are:
1. Culture chronology, as evidenced by a definable sequence of archaeological
material assemblages (i.e., specific artifact types and forms for discrete time
periods) .

2. Subsistence economic patterns and their continuity and change through time,
as evidenced by specific strategies of resource exploitation and the
interlinkage of these strategies with naturally changing/evolving
environmental resource mosaics .
3. Settlement patterns, or how prehistoric peoples used and moved to and from
preferred locations in their environment. This issue encompasses questions of
intensity of site occupation and specific resource zones according to the
relative abundances of key subsistence resources, the relative size of groups
residing at specific kinds of sites within specific environmental zones, and the
duration and periodicity/seasonality of occupations.
4. The origins and development of the Brownsville Complex, and its possible
relationship to Mesoamerican cultures to the south .

Archaeological Survey Field Methods and Findings

The archaeological survey of transects along the proposed routes of channels A,
Bl-2, Cl-3, and D on Bahia Grande in Cameron County, Texas were conducted over a
week-long period in May of 2004 by for purposes of archaeological site detection,
definition, or clearance (in the absence of archaeological material) for proposed channel
cuts within the aforementioned transects .
Field methods for the survey consisted of a combination of ground surveillance of
surfaces within 100 meters of the centerlines of the proposed channel cuts. Shovel tests
were excavated along survey transects where ground-surface visibility was obscured by
vegetation cover that was more than an estimated 30 percent of the surface. Observations
of erosional banks and gullies were also made to detect the presence of buried
archaeological materials .
Shovel tests
Areas of reltively low surface visibility due to vegetation cover were subjected to
shovel testing so that the presence/absence of archaeological sites might be determined .
Shovel tests were dug approximately 100-meter intervals along all survey transects as
defined by the planned Bahia Grande channel cuts (A, Bl-2, Cl-3, and D), and dug to a
depth of 100-120 cm below ground surface or to water table. Whichever was closest to
the surface.
Shovel tests reaching the modern water table were terminated where
saturated conditions were encountered.
Such conditions occurred exclusively in
Salicomia- and Batis maritima-dominated, low-lying mud flats along Transect A
Because of the consistently water-saturated conditions found along Transect A,
no further shovel tests were placed in similar, low-lying mud-flat areas. Better-drained
locales that would have been suited to prehistoric occupation, namely lomas (clay dunes),
were scarcely intersected by the proscribed survey transect limits. Terrestrial flats

(Buried A-Horizon)

A total of 15 shovel tests were dug during the course of archaeological survey at
Bahia Grande. Although unproductive of archaeological materials, information on the
nature of sediments in different landforms was obtained (see Table 1). Interestingly, a
buried palaeosol was observable in a number of shovel tests as well as along erosional
exposures of the strandline at Bahia Grande. The upper contact of this palaeosol is
encountered relatively uniformly at a depth of 100-120 cm across the project area, and
must reflect the sedimentary outcome of certain regional environmental conditions.
These regional (paleo-) conditions most likely include the development of ground
vegetation with a better-developed rhizosphere than that of today (preventing erosion and
encouraging a "loamy" A-horizon development of relatibely art color) .
In addition to the definition of this extensive buried soil horizon, a uniformly silty
clay matrix encountered in all shovel tests above the buried soil suggests that clay dune
formation in the region has been relatively continuous since the formation of the
palaeosol. Such sediments are the primary products of mud-flat erosion, which leads to
eolian deposition into clay dunes or lomas .

Pedestrian Ground Survey
The ground surface along survey transects was visually inspected by the field
crew, with participating individuals walking in parallel lines spaced at 10-meter intervals .
Pedestrian ground survey on non-eroded, less-vegetated surfaces found no evidence of
archaeological materials, except in the surface of one previously recorded site (Anderson
site "# 00.9", or 41CF138, near Channel A), which may be heavily deflated. Surface
exposures were also examined at the historic railroad recorded on the southern shore of
Bahia Grande and photographs were taken of this feature (see Figures 3-6) .
Importantly, all erosional exposures of deeper sediment deposits were visually
inspected. Such exposures include rills and gullies, Bahia Grande shoreline banks, and
the eroded edges of clay dunes found within the survey transects. This field procedure
made possible the finding of site 41CF136 (see below).
From such an examination of erosional exposures, a significant finding during
the pedestrian survey program was the relocation and definition of the Anderson site #
2.7" (site trinomial designation is 41CF136) within survey transect C2, along the eastern

strand-line of Bahia Grande. It was determined after cleaning and excavation into the
cut bank of this site along the strand line exposure this that materials deposited along the
eastern Bahia Grande "beach" actually derived from a depth of two meters, and not from
shallower, overlying sediments.
This interpretation was confirmed by a complete
absence of archaeological materials in the upper surface exposures, and by a similar
absence of archaeological materials in 1.2-meter-deep shovel tests performed along the
western aspect of the C2 Transect (namely, shovel tests 1 and 5, see below) .
Archaeological Sites
Archaeological sites identified during the survey work include an already
mapped historic railroad line partially preserved on the southern shore of Bahia Grande
and two prehistoric sites already encountered by A. E. Anderson (#00.9 and #2.7,
41CF138 and 41CF136 respectively as recorded in site files at the Texas Archeological
Research Laboratory) .
Historic Railroad Platform
A photographic record was made of a historic railroad platform intersecting the
southern shore Bahia Grande that consists of oak uprights and iron stakes (see photos,
Figures 3-6). Preserved sections of the wooden uprights continue for a distance of
several hundred meters into the middle of Bahia Grande.

41CF138, Anderson Site #00.9
The Anderson site #00.9 (41CF138) was briefly examined on the western edge of
Transect A (Figure I). The clay dune on which the site is located does not extend into
the proposed channel right of way, as indicated by negative findings in Shovel test l
within this transect. Remains observed on the surface of the site on the clay dune to the
west of Channel A include rare small burned clay nodules and very common Rabdotus
land snail shells which may reflect prehistoric food gathering and shell discard. The
surface distribution of the latter remains suggests that the site (on the end of the clay
dune) is significantly deflated. No time-diagnostic artifacts were discovered from the
site .

41CFB6, Am:lerson Site #2.7
The A.E. Anderson site #2.7 (41CF136) was relocated and intensively examined by
the CEI survey crew.
Archaeological materials at 41 CFJ36 were found along an
approximately 400-500-meter north-south-trending line running along the strand of the
eastern shore of Bahia Grande (Figures 7 and 8), centered south of the western terminus
of the proposed Channel cut C2 (see Figure 2). This strand-line deposit was initially
thought to have originated from some upper aspect of the erosional exposure formed
along the strand, but intensive pedestrian survey along the entire shoreline failed to find
any materials within the upper reaches of the exposed sediments, even though the strand
itself was quite productive of artifacts of various classes (although Rabdotus land snail
shells were most common). Shovel tests to a depth of 1.2 meters along the western
aspect of Transect C2 also proved to be negative, indicating greater depth for the source
of the exposed materials .
A complete vertical section of the erosional exposure was examined. In its upper
aspect, a thin buried soil horizon was discovered at a depth of 1 meter, underlying a
massive silty clay eolian sediment deposit. Below the soil horizon, sediment was a
sandy clay. Importantly, a definitive Rabdotus lens and a lithic flake were found in situ
2. 1 meters below the top surface of the erosional exposure, indicating that many of the
archaeological remains strewn across the strand line at 41CF13 6 actually originate at this
depth (suggesting considerable antiquity). This inference is further supported by the
discovery of two well-made triangular Tortugas dart points from the 4JCF136 strand,
both of fine-grained, dark-brown chert (see Figure 9). Lithic tools and debitage collected
from eroded surfaces at 41CF136 are discussed in detail below.
At present, the
stratigraphy (see Figures 8 & A-1) of the 41CF136 erosional profile can be summarized
as follows:
1. Upper stratum (0-100 cm): silty clay, light brown (10YR5/3), contains no

archaeological materials;
2. Buried soil horizon (100-120 cm): clay loam, dark brown (!OYR3-4/2) in in color,
contains no archaeological materials;
3. Lower stratum (120-220 cm): sandy loam, light brown (10YR5/4) in color.
Archaeological materials originating at approximately 210 cm below the surface
include 2 chert Tortugas points, a small chert uniface, 6 pieces of chert debitage, 2
pieces of pumice, 31 fish otoliths, 2 sunray venus clamshell tool fragments, and a
possibly modified whelk shell fragment .
Lithic Artifacts
Flaked stone artifacts recovered from 41CF136 include the two Tortugas points, a
thin uniface, probably a scraper fragment, and six pieces of debitage. One of the
Tortugas points is complete, while the other is a proximal or basal fragment. The
complete specimen exhibits strong right-edge alternate edge beveling; the proximal
fragment may also have had alternate beveling but the piece is too fragmentary for this to
be determined .

Tortugas points are extremely common in South Texas (Turner and Hester 1999; Prewitt
1995) and have been dated to as early as the sixth millennium b.p. (i.e, 3,000-4,000 B.C.;
e.g., Hester 1980; Ricklis 1988). The type clearly was in use for a considerable time,
since it has been dated at the Loma Sandia site in Live Oak County to as late as ca. 800600 B.C. (Taylor and Highley 1995). The presence of two Tortugas points at 41CF136
indicates that the level from which the archaeological materials came represents an
Archaic occupation, and a rough and tentative estimate of the possible time range of
occupation would be ca. 6,000-2,000 b.p .

The small uniface is a flake of brown chert on which one edge has been beveled
by a series of short flake removals. This flaking created a piano-convex edge section that
would have served well for scraping tasks .
The small sample oflithic debitage is instructive simply in terms of the scarcity of
these materials. Since six flakes were recovered during our surface inspection along with
three formal tools (2 dart points, l probable scraper), the flake-tool ratio at the site is a
very low 2: 1. Research conducted on the central Texas coastal to the north of the present
project area indicated that such a low flake-to-tool ratio should be expected at sites
located some considerable distance from the source of stone raw material used in tool
production (Ricklis and Cox 1993). This should be expected in the Rio Grande delta
wherein the local geology consists of fine-grained alluvial and deltaic sediments and
chert cobbles would have had to be procured at some distance inland (see discussion by
Tomka and Bousman 1991).

Figure 10. Piece of unmodified pumice from 41CF136.

The remainder of the lithic material from 41CF136 consists of two pieces of
pumice, a light-weight volcanic rock that preumably washed up on Gulf of Mexico
beaches. The two specimens from 41CF136, one cobble-sized (Figure 10) and the other
pebble-sized, have no apparent use modifications and the shapes appear natural. The
finding of shape-modified (i.e., flattened or faceted) pumice pieces at other
archaeological sites along the Texas coast suggests that this material was sometimes used
in abrading tasks (e.g., Ricklis 1994:83).
Shell Artifacts
Four shell artifacts (Figure 11) were found at 41CF136. Three specimens are
fragments of sunray venus (lvlacrocallista nimbosa) clam shells with flaked edges, a
common artifact form along the central and lower Texas coast (e.g., Prewitt et al. 1987;
Ricklis 1995, 2004) where sunray venus shells were modified as scraping/cutting tools
and served as a substitute raw material for chert or other flakable stone. The fourth
artifact is a small rectangular piece of lightning whelk (Busycon perversum) shell that
may have been artificially shaped; the weathering of this specimen precludes a confident
assessment as to whether it was intentionally shaped .

Fish Remains
No fauna! bones were found at 4JCF136, presumably due to decay over some
undetermined long time since the site was occupied. However, an abundance of fish
otoliths was found at the site, suggesting that fishing was a major, if not the primary,
economic activity performed there. The distinctive morphology of these small objects
(see Figure 12), comprised of calcium carbonate and protein, and which grow in fish
skulls and aid in balance, allow identification of the species of fish. A total of 31
specimens were collected from the site, with the overwhelming majority (N=3 l, or 94%)
representing black drum (Pogonias cromis), and the remainder representing redfish or red
drum (Sciaenops ocellata) and spotted sea trout (Cynoscion nebulosis) .
The near-pure assemblage of black drum at 41CF136 is suggestive of a somewhat

conditions for black drum fishing during the Late Winter to Early Spring spawning
season, it is likely that the seasonality of site occupation includes at least this portion of
the year (e.g., Ricklis 1996; Eling 1993)). Significantly, the appearance of black drum,
redfish and trout in the bahia also suggests that the Bahia Grande was a marineinfluenced embayment during the period of site occupation .

Conclusions and Recommendations
Careful surface inspection and shovel testing along the rights of way of the
proposed Bahia Grande channels found no evidence of archaeological materials on low
ground subject to tidal indundation. The two sites that were found during our survey are
both located on/within ground that is at five or more feet in elevation above mean sea
level; in both cases the containing sediment matrix consists of fine silty clays that
accumulated through eolian deposition as clay-dune deposits. This is in keeping with
expectations based on previously recorded information in the immediate area, especially
the locations of archaeological sites recorded by A E. Anderson which are commonly on
the clay dunes or lomas that are common within the Rio Grande delta area. lnferably,
these locations were preferred by prehistoric peoples for campsites because they provided
well-drained ground that was above the reach of tidal fluctuations and thus suitable for
habitation .
Site 41CF136, located on slightly elevated ground along part of the eastern
shorline of Bahia Grande produced a range of artifacts of stone and shell and a goodsized sample of fish otoliths. While our limited investigation of the site does not provide
much data for interpretation, it can be inferred that the site represents a multi-functional
occupation. The rather abundant fish otoliths suggest an economic importance for fishing
activities, while the presence of flaked-stone dart points suggests that hunting activities
were carried out from the site, as well. The edge-flaked sunray venus shells probably
represent cutting and/or scraping tasks that were carried out at the site, while the few
pieces of chert debitage indicate that stone tool production and/or rejuvenation (e.g. , resharpening) was done there as well. The scattered small burned clay nodules may be
eroded from hearth features. In short, the site is a sizeable one at which a range of

economic and technological activities were carried out, suggesting that it may have
served as base camp for prehistoric peoples who were exploiting the locally available fish
resources with some intensity.
41CF136 is the only prehistoric site encountered during our survey within any of
the right of ways of any of the proposed channels. Indeed, the site appears to be more or
less centered at the location of Channel C2 and extends, judging by surface finds,
southward to the location of Channel C3. The site may also extend northward toward
Channel B2, although no surface indication was found of this (see the Appendix for more
information on the extent of this site).
Given that 41 CF136 yielded diagnostic, typable dart points, shell tools, burned
clay nodules (which probably represent on-site hearth features), and abundant fish
remains in the form of species-diagnostic otoliths, it may have research potential for
exploring the following key questions of archaeological significance:
1. The range of activities earned out by prehistoric people at a shoreline camp
the Rio Grande Delta area. As noted earlier, this question has yet to be
addressed in the limited archaeological research conducted in the general
surrounding area. Added investigation at the site could be expected to provide
significant information on the full range of fish species exploited, the range of
tool types used at the site (and, by inference, the range of activities carried out
there), as well as the kinds of cultural features (e.g., hearths, pits,
living/activity areas) that may be found at such a location.
2. Since the cultural material were observed to be eroding from a narrow zone of
sediment at 210-230 cm below the present surface, it is probable that they
represent a single, temporally discrete archaeological component. Recovery
of organic materials such as bone, shell, or perhaps charcoal from hearth
features would provide important information with which to place the dart
points and other artifacts present within a regional chronological framework.
As also noted earlier, a sound regional chronology has yet to be developed for
the Rio Grande Delta area and such investigation would contribute
significantly to this end .
3. In addition to contributing to the development of a regional cultural
chronology, dating the occupation at 41CF136 would provide important
information on paleoenvironmental history, which would in tum help to
provide an environmental context for understanding the evolution of human
ecological patterns in this area. The use of the site for more or less intensive
fishing is an important clue to the kind of kind of aquatic environment
adjacent to the site at the time of occupation. The presence of abundant
ototliths of black drum and other species suggests a more open, marineinfluenced environment than is presently the case. Dating the time of
occupation would provide significant information on the age of this kind of
environment, in which Holocene sea level rise had indundated low-lying areas
to create bays that would sustain relatively high fish biomass prior to effective
closure of the system from marine influence, as is the case today .
All of these factors combine to suggest that 41CF136 may be eligible for listing

on the National Register of Historic Places and for designation as a Texas State
Archeological Landmark. Given the research potential of the site, it is recommended that
proposed channel excavations C2 and C3 be routed so as to avoid impacts to the site,
within the site boundaries shown in Figure 2. If this is not feasible, it is recommended
that formal National Register eligibility testing be carried out prior to channel
construction in order to (a) more precisely define the subsurface extend and bounds of the
site, (b) to better define the range of materials and features that may be present in order to
formally assess National Register eligibility.
Having stated this assessment, it must be noted that further examination of
41CFl36, conducted at the request of David Siegel, U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service,
showed the site to contain only extremely sparse archaeological material; the moderate
abundance of materials found are from the swash zone at the base of the clay dune where
they have been winnowed from their sediment matrix by wave action. This is discussed
ino the Appendix, which contains a revision of the assessment and recommendations
stated above ..
As the discussion in the previous pages show, no other potentially significant
archaeological sites were located within any of the surveyed channel areas. Thus, no
further work in these areas is recommended. No significant cultural resources appear to
be susceptible to the effects of construction of Channels A, B2, Cl and D, and no further
archaeological work is recommended at those locations.

APPENDIX:

Additional Intensive Survey at 41CF136, with Revised Assessment and
Recommendations
By
Robert A. Ricklis

Goals
Personnel, including this writer, from Coastal Environments, Inc. (CEI) spent the
day of December 10, 2004, doing an intensive archaeological survey at site 41CF136 .
The goal of this work was to more precisely delineate the limits of the site. The site is
the same as identified by A. E. Anderson in decades past and identified in Anderson's
listing of sites as #2. 7 (Anderson site files, as communicated by Tiffany Terneny,
archaeologist with the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, Galveston District). This site was
relocated by CEI during its survey of proposed channel cuts in the Bahia Grande Unit in
the summer of2004 (see main body of text, this report). At that time it was determined
that this site, marked by artifacts, shells and fish otoliths exposed by erosion, extended
for several hundred meters along the eastern shoreline of Bahia Grande; based on the
distribution of these materials, its was concluded that they had eroded from the eolian
clay dune deposit that parallels the shore and had thus been left exposed along the beach
line. It was concluded that the remains might represent a significant archaeological site
(i.e., eligible for the National Register of Historic Places) and that it should be avoided by
channel construction or, if avoidance is not possible, formally tested for NRHP eligibility
prior to construction. The area of primary concern was where proposed Channel C3
intersects the site and the shoreline (see attached Figure 1). After receipt of the report on
the survey, U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service determined that Channel C3 would be
abandoned, thus avoiding any impact to this part of 41CF136 (David Siegel, pers. comm.
2004). Of some additional concern was the intersection of Channel C2 with the site and
shoreline, since the southern limit of the site was not precisely defined in our first field
session. Thus the primary goal of the presently reported fieldwork was to firmly
establish the southern site limits, to determine if excavation of Channel C2 will affect
significant archaeological deposits, and to assess whether formal testing should be done
there.
Field Methods
The work reported here was conducted by means of surface reconnaissance .
Although the option of subsurface investigation using a backhoe to be provided by the
Wildlife Refuge was kept open, this was deemed unnecessary upon careful examination
of the site. Two CEI archaeologists, Laurid Broughton and the author, walked the area
along the shoreline and carefully examined (a) the eroded western margin of the pertinent

eroded from the dune are deposited and readily visible on the beach surface.

The following key observations were made during this one-day survey session:
1. Abundant Rabdotus land snail shells are embedded within the sandy clay
sediments of the clay dune and numerous such shells have been exposed by
erosion and deflated onto the present beach (see Figure A-2). Approximately 125
meters north of the south end of proposed Channel C2, a distinct lens of Rabdotus
shells is exposed within the eroded margin of the clay dune (see Figures A-1 and
A-3), some 2.1 meters below the surface; this lens was noted in the original
survey work and was reported as a probable source of much of the archaeological
material found along the beach line (Ricklis and Albert 2004, p. 18) The
abundance of Rabdotus shells may be attributable to their use as a food resource
by prehistoric people who resided at 41CF136 .
2. Numerous fish otoliths were collected along the beach. The absence offish bone,

which is far less resistant to decay than the otoliths, suggests considerable age for
these items, which are believed to have eroded from the clay dune and thus to be
archaeological materials reflective of prehistoric fishing and fish processing at
41CG136. Otoliths of black drum (Pogonias cromis) were by far the most
common. Also found were specimens representing speckled sea trout (Cynoscion
nebulosis) and redfish (Sciaenops ocellata). The numerical breakdown of
specimens of these three species is as follows:
Pognoias cromis: 78
Cynoscion nebulosis: 4
Scianenops ocellata: 1
While otoliths were found scattered along the beach line, black drum otoliths
were especially concentrated (N=62 or 81 % of the black drum otoliths collected)
approximately 13 0 meters north of the Channel C2 line, adjacent to the eroded dune
profile that contained the buried Rabdotus lens (see map, Figure A-1).
3. Artifacts of stone and shell were found along the beach 100 meters south of the

Channel C2 center line (see Figure A-4). These include 2 distal fragments of
flaked-chert dart points (which cannot be typed due to the absence of the
diagnostic proximal or basal portions), a small, thin and bi facially retouched flake
oflight gray chert, a large flake oflight gray chert with one bifacially flaked edge,
and two fragments of edge-flaked sunray venus (Macrocallista nimbosa) clam
shell.
It is important to note that this was the only area in which artifacts were
observed. This is the same area from which were recovered two Tortugas dart
points and edge-flaked sunray venus shell in our initial survey.

3. These most recent observations strongly suggest that the excavation of Channel
C2 will not affect any significant buried archaeological deposits. The relative
concentrations of (a) otoliths and (b) artifacts are found, respectively, 130 north
and 100 meter south of the channel center line (see Figure A-1), beyond the
proposed limits of ground disturbance that will be associated with channel
construction. In any case, the materials actually remaining in the clay dune
deposits at the site can be predicted to be too diffusely distributed to provide the
kinds of quantifiable contexts and associations that would justify the time and
resources required for meaningful data recovery through excavation of the site.
The low potential for useful data recovery suggests that this site is probably not
eligible for the National Register or for listing as a State Archeological Landmark.
Based on the totality of our survey findings, it is recommended that no further
archaeological work be done at 41CFl36 .
