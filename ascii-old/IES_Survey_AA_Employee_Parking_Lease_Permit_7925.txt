ABSTRACT
This report documents the substantive findings and management recommendations of a
cultural resource inventory conducted by Integrated Environmental Solutions, LLC (IES)
for the American Airlines Employee Parking Lease Area Project, Tarrant County, Texas.
As the project is within the Dallas/Fort Worth International Airport (DFW) property, the
DFW will need approval from the Federal Aviation Administration to modify their
Airport Layout Plan to reflect the permanent alterations. Since this is considered a
federal action, the project will subsequently require compliance with Section 106 of the
National Historic Preservation Act. In addition, as the DFW is a political subdivision of
the State of Texas the project will be subjected to the provisions of the Antiquities Code
of Texas (ACT).
The goal of the survey was to locate, identify, and assess any cultural resources that could
be adversely affected by the proposed development, and to evaluate such resources for
their potential eligibility for listing as a State Antiquities Landmark (SAL) or eligibility
for listing in the National Register of Historic Places (NRHP).
The cultural resources inventory was conducted by archeologists Thomas Chapman and
Anne Gibson on 22 February 2017, under Texas Antiquities Permit No. 7925. During the
IES survey, no cultural resources were encountered within the 7.65-acre Area of Potential
Effects.
No artifacts were collected as part of this survey. All records will be temporarily curated
at the IES McKinney office and permanently curated at the Texas Archeological
Research Laboratory (TARL). No further work is warranted. However, if any cultural
resources are unearthed during construction, the operators should stop construction
activities, and immediately contact the project environmental representative to initiate
coordination with the THC prior to resuming any construction activities.

CHAPTER 1: PROJECT DESCRIPTION

This report has been written in accordance with the guidelines for reports prepared by the Council of
Texas Archeologists (CTA 2002). The report presents a brief description of the project area or Area of
Potential Effects (APE), environmental setting and methodology; followed by the results of the
investigations and recommendations. This report serves as the cultural resources report to satisfy the
Antiquities Code of Texas (ACT).

1.1 Introduction
As the project cultural resources consultant for Dallas/Fort Worth International Airport (DFW), Integrated
Environmental Solutions, LLC (IES) performed a cultural resources inventory to locate any prehistoric or
historic-period cultural resources that could be considered potentially eligible for inclusion on the
National Register of Historic Places (NRHP) or listing as a State Antiquities Landmark (SAL) within the
7.65 acre APE. The APE was located southwest of the intersection of American Boulevard and FAA
Boulevard in Tarrant County, Texas. The project was plotted on the Euless 7.5-minute series U.S.
Geological Survey (USGS) Quadrangle sheet and recent aerial photograph (Figures 1.1 and 1.2).
As the project is within the DFW property, the DFW needed approval from the Federal Aviation
Administration (FAA) to modify their Airport Layout Plan to reflect the permanent alterations. Since this
is considered a federal action, the project will subsequently require compliance with the National
Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) and Section 106 of the National Historic Preservation Act (NHPA).
In addition, as the DFW is a political subdivision of the State of Texas the project will be subjected to the
provisions of the ACT.
The goal of the survey was to locate, identify, and assess the APE for previously unrecorded
archeological sites, and to evaluate any such resource for potential eligibility as a SAL or NRHP listing.
All work was conducted in accordance with 13 Texas Administrative Code (TAC) 26, and with 36 Code
of Federal Regulations (CFR) 60.4, which outline the regulations for implementing the ACT and Section
106, respectively.

1.2 Area of Potential Effects
1.2.1

Direct APE

Although exact project designs for the APE are not available at the time of this report, preliminary plans
call for the construction of a parking lot for American Airlines employee parking. Ground disturbances
associated with tree removal, grading, water detention/retention structures, and paving are anticipated for
this project. Although the extent of subsurface impacts is currently unknown, field investigations
assessed to the depth of proposed construction or the bottom of soils capable of containing cultural
resources.
1.2.2

Indirect APE

Although an assessment of indirect visual effects is not required per the ACT regulations, the project will
require compliance with NHPA Section 106 regulations as the project will require approval from the
FAA. Although elements of the project will remain above ground, these elements will have minimal
vertical footprints and will be aesthetically similar to those in place within adjacent lots. As such, indirect
effects will not be considered for this project.

CHAPTER 2: ENVIRONMENTAL BACKGROUND

2.1 Environmental Setting
2.1.1

Climate

Tarrant County is in the north-central part of the state of Texas. This region has a humid subtropical
climate and an annual rainfall averaging between approximately 35.01 to 40.00 inches. About half of the
rain usually falls between April and May, with July and August being the two driest months of the year.
The subtropical region tends to have a relatively mild year-round temperature with the occasional
exceedingly hot and cold snaps (Estaville and Earl 2008).
2.1.2

Topographic Setting

The USGS Euless 7.5â Quadrangle map illustrated that the APE was located on the southern margins of a
broad upland ridge that separates the West Fork Trinity River from Big Bear Creek. The headwaters to
an unnamed tributary are located within the eastern edge of the APE and flow south and confluence with
an unnamed tributary located approximately 300 feet south of the APE. The APE was located within a
transitional topographic setting, which transitions from a very gently sloping upland setting north of the
APE to a steeply sloped setting south of the APE. The APE was surrounded on three sides by developed
urban land.
2.1.3

Geology and Soils

The APE was located within an environmental interface, known as an ecotone, between the Northern
Blackland Prairie and Eastern Cross Timber ecoregions (Figure 2.1) (McGowen et al. 1987). Variation
among each ecoregion is a direct result of the underlying geology (Diggs et al. 1999). The natural divide
between these two geological formations parallels Big Bear Creek, which runs from the northwest to the
southeast through the western portion of the DFW property.
The Northern Blackland Prairie is characterized by low-relief topography containing dark, thick, plastic
clay soils typical of the Houston Black, Heiden, and Wilson soil series (Ressel 1981). The Eagle Ford
Formation (Kef) underlies these soils, which is the westernmost and oldest geological group within the
Blackland Prairies (McGowen et al. 1987). This formation dates to the late Cretaceous and is comprised
of sedimentary rock consisting of shale, siltstone, and limestone, which grades upward into highly plastic
clay (Coffee 1980, McGowen et al. 1987, USGS 2017).
The Eastern Cross Timbers region was historically characterized by a narrow strip of timbered, low hills
that are orientated along a north/south axis from Tishomingo, Oklahoma to Waco, Texas (Ferring 1994;
McGowen et al. 1987). This region contains countless hills that were once heavily wooded and contained
oak, walnut, blackjack, and hickory trees that grow in deep sandy soil (Hill 1901). Early pioneers
referred to the region as the Monte Grande (Grand Forest) and later the Lower Timbers. However, due to
urban expansion, agricultural development, and other modern activities, the natural vegetation has
become highly fragmented and only a few large tracts of undisturbed woodlands remains today (Griffith
et al. 2007). The APE was underlain by the Woodbine (Kwb) geological formation. The Woodbine dates
back to the Late Cretaceous and primarily consists of sandstone and contains a small percentage of
siltstone, mudstone, and clay (Griffith et al. 2007; McGowen et al. 1987).
Two soil series were identified within the APE (Figure 2.2). Table 2.1 provides a brief description of the
soils and their percentages within the APE. According to the Soil Survey of Tarrant County, Texas
(Ressel 1981) and U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) Natural Resources Conservation Service
(NRCS) web soil survey data for Tarrant County (Web Soil Survey 2017), the soils are generally
characterized as moderately well drained clay soils located along ridges.

CHAPTER 3: CULTURAL BACKGROUND

3.1 Previous Investigations
A file search within the Texas Archeological Sites Atlas (TASA) database, maintained by the THC,
identified that there are no previously recorded archeological sites, National Register Properties, historical
markers, or cemeteries located within the proposed APE (TASA 2017). The TASA database indicates
that there are two previously conducted cultural resources surveys and one previously recorded
archeological site within one-mile of the APE (Tables 3.1 and 3.2) (Figure 3.1).

3.2 Cultural Resources Potential
In addition to the TASA review, several additional sources were referenced to determine the overall
potential for encountering cultural resources within the APE. These sources included the Soil Survey of
Tarrant County, Texas, the Geologic Atlas of Texas, Dallas Sheet, the USGS topographic map, the NRCS
digital soil database for Tarrant County, the Potential Archeological Liability Map (PALM), the National
Archives and Records Administrationâs (NARA) 1940 Census Enumeration District Maps for Tarrant
County, the Texas Historic Overlay (THO) georeferenced maps, and both past and current aerial
photography.
3.2.1

Prehistoric Resource Potential

According to the PALM of Tarrant County, the majority of the APE was located within an area that
contained a low potential for shallow and deeply buried deposits within a reasonable context. Only a
narrow strip of land along the western boundary of the APE and American Boulevard has a negligible
potential for cultural resources at any depth.
3.2.2

Historic-Period Resource Potential

Historical maps indicate the APE and adjacent areas were void of historic-period resources as early as
1920. Historical aerial photographs dating back to 1953 and modern aerial photograph interpretation
confirm there were no historic-period features within the APE. Although potential exists for historic-aged
resources to have been constructed and demolished within the APE prior to 1953, the APEâs distance
from historical roads lends to a low probability of this occurrence.

CHAPTER 4: METHODOLOGY

The archeological inventory for the American Airlines Employee Parking Lease Area Project was
conducted on 22 February 2017. The methods and density of excavating shovel tests met the minimum
requirements for field operations stipulated by the THC and CTA Archeological Survey Standards for
Texas. Prior to field work, the IES staff conducted a historical and archeological records search to
determine what cultural resources have been recorded within the APE and within a one-mile radius of the
APE. This information was detailed above. Additionally, IES staff reviewed ecological, geological, soils
data, as well as, historical and recent topographic maps and aerial photography.

4.1 Survey Methods
The 100 percent intensive pedestrian survey consisted of a careful examination of the ground surface and
existing subsurface exposures for evidence of archeological sites within the APE. The survey consisted
of a multiple transect scheme with transect lines spaced at 30 meter (m) intervals orientated east and west
across the APE. Areas displaying high levels of disturbance were photographed to document the lack of
potential for intact archeological deposits. Other documentation methods included narrative notes, maps,
and shovel test records.

4.2 Shovel Testing
In areas with potential for archeological materials, shovel tests were excavated to 80 centimeters (cm) or
the bottom of culturally sterile deposits, whichever was encountered first, unless otherwise specified.
Each shovel test was 30 cm in diameter and was hand excavated in natural stratigraphic levels not
exceeding 20 cm in thickness. Excavated soil was screened using Â¼-inch hardware cloth to test for the
presences of buried cultural material. All tests were recorded on maps and plotted using hand-help
Global Positioning System (GPS) units. Investigators documented the results of each test on standardized
shovel test forms. According to the Archeological Survey Standards of Texas, an APE with an area of
7.65 acres, displaying little to no disturbance, should have approximately 14 shovel tests (one shovel test
per two acres) excavated during the pedestrian survey. However, shovel test numbers varied based on the
amount of disturbance present within the APE. All positive shovel tests, cultural features, and other site
data were geospatially recorded using Trimble Geo XT handheld GPS unit.
Standards for archeological methods require that measurements be recorded in metric units. For this
reason, while general distances and engineering specifications are described in feet or miles within this
report, archeological measurements and observations are listed in meters or centimeters, unless artifact
diagnostic elements must be presented within Imperial unit measurements.

4.3 Curation
The survey employed a non-collection strategy. Records, files, field notes, forms, and other
documentation will be included in the curation package. All field-generated documents will be
temporarily curated at the IES office and permanently curated at TARL. These documents and
photographs will be organized and catalogued according to TARL curation standards.

CHAPTER 5: RESULTS

During the survey, 15 shovel tests were excavated within the 7.65-acre area inventoried for cultural
resources. A photograph location map and photographs are located in Appendix A.

5.1 Past Ground Disturbances
Through background research using historical aerial photographs and maps it was verified that the
majority of the APE has been exposed to some degree of ground disturbance. These disturbances are
primarily related to past agricultural or pastoral use and associated removal of vegetation as early as 1953;
however, it can be assumed that this land use has persisted since the turn of the 20th century. More
significant disturbances were present within the APE, but identified within smaller isolated portions.
At some point between 1957 and 1963, the agricultural field or pasture that covered the entirety of the
APE fell into disuse and began to be overgrown by dense, woody secondary growth. Coinciding with the
abandonment of the existing field/pasture, a building currently used by the FAA Air Route Traffic
Control Center and adjoining parking lots were constructed immediately adjacent to the eastern edge of
the APE. In the 1970s, the surrounding area was developed with the construction of the American
Airlines office and training facilities, residential areas, and road infrastructure. Between 1970 and 1979,
FAA Boulevard, American Boulevard, and the FAA parking lot expansion impacted the APEâs western,
northern, and eastern edges. Modern aerial photographs show that the most significant ground
disturbances were associated with a construction yard located within the northeastern quarter of the APE.
While the construction yard is currently located outside the APE, aerial photographs illustrate that the
yard was larger during the early 2000s and significantly disturbed portions of the APE. At this time,
several dirt and gravel roads were created by vehicular traffic and crisscrossed the APE. These
unimproved roads were used to dump modern debris within discrete locations throughout the APE.

5.2 Pedestrian Survey and Shovel Testing
IES archeologists excavated 15 negative shovel tests during the 100 percent survey to test for subsurface
cultural materials (Figure 5.1). Shovel testing was conducted within the APE at approximate 60 m
intervals along each transect. During the archeological survey, numerous piles of modern construction
debris, gravel, and earthen push piles were observed along the eastern boundary of the APE and adjacent
to the FAA parking lot (Appendix A, Photographs 01 through 12; 25 through 31). Investigators also
observed a 9 m to 15 m wide corridor that had been cleared of trees and covered by maintained grass,
surrounding the fence of the FAA parking lot (Appendix A, Photographs 22 through 24; 32 and 33).
One shovel test near the maintained corridor, AG05, in the northeast corner of the APE encountered a
dense layer of gravel just below the surface.
Within the former footprint of the FAA construction yard, a modern concrete slab was encountered. The
slab was rectangular and approximately 6 m by 4 m in size. Modern aerial photographs from the early
2000s indicate that the concrete slab was part of the FAA construction yard, which was much larger and
extended within the APE. According to historical aerial photographs, no structures or features were
situated near the slabâs location prior to 2000.
Shovel tests within the APE revealed one predominant soil type which was consistent with data received
from the soil survey. The soils within the APE were dominated by clay pertaining to the Navo soil series.
The soil contained a dark yellowish brown (10YR 4/3 and 4/4) that extended to a depth of 30 cmbs. No
shovel test was excavated deeper than 40 cmbs because of the shallow depth of Holocene-aged soils. In
addition to excavating shovel tests, subsurface exposure including animal burrows, disturbed patches, and
cutbanks along any erosional feature were examined. Excavating shovel tests and visual inspections
revealed that there are no soils suitable for containing deeply buried cultural material within the APE. No
cultural resources were encountered within the APE.

CHAPTER 6: SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS

During the archeological survey, 15 negative shovel tests were excavated within the 7.65 acre APE.
Through the pedestrian survey and shovel testing, no cultural resources were encountered. Therefore, the
DFW is requesting concurrence for the APE and that no historic properties are affected under 36 CFR
800.4 (d)(1). It is the recommendation of IES that the THC concur with these findings and the American
Airlines Employee Parking Lease Area Project be permitted to continue without the need for further
cultural resource investigations. However, if any cultural resources are unearthed during construction, the
operators should cease work immediately in that area, and the THC should be notified prior to resuming
any construction activities.
