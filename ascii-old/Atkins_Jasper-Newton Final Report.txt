I. INTRODUCTION
PBS&J was contracted by Cornelius-Pierce Consulting Engineers, Inc., of Fort Worth, on
behalf of the Jasper-Newton Electric Cooperative to conduct a cultural resources survey of the proposed
McGee 138-kV transmission line from the existing Mill Creek Substation to the proposed McGee
Substation, in northern Jasper County, Texas (figures 1 and 2). The transmission line is approximately
5.5 miles (8.9 kilometers) long, while the right-of-way (ROW) is 65 feet (ft) (19.8 meters [m]) wide
where it parallels existing roads and 100 ft (30.5 m) wide in all other locations. The proposed line
parallels existing State Highway (SH) 63 for about 5,360 ft (1,633 m) and parallels an existing pipeline
ROW for another 6,320 ft (1,926 m). About 4,200 ft (1,280 m) of the line is in excess of 981 ft (300 m)
from a permanent water source, while 3,650 ft (1,112 m) was inundated by standing water at the time of
the survey. The project also included survey of the location for the proposed 4 acre (ac) (1.6 hectare [ha])
McGee substation on the western end of the transmission line. The transmission ROW, together with the
proposed McGee substation, equals a total project area of 67 ac (27.1 ha).
The purpose of the survey was to locate, describe, and document any cultural resources
within the project’s Area of Potential Effect . The proposed McGee 138-kV transmission line will be of
single concrete pole construction with direct embedment (no concrete foundation required). The typical
span between poles will be 500 ft (152 m), with a range of 400 to 600 ft (122 to 183 m). Surface and
subsurface impacts will affect the proposed ROW during the construction phase. The surface will be
impacted during clearing of the ROW and the subsurface will be impacted during the drilling of the holes
into which the transmission poles will be placed. Subsurface impacts will disturb an area approximately 9
ft (2.74 m) deep and 30 inches (76.2 centimeters [cm]) in diameter for each of the transmission pole
locations. No cultural resources were identified by the survey.
Because the total project area is less than 200 ac (81 ha), PBS&J has chosen to detail the
investigations using the suggested format of a short report as outlined by the Council of Texas
Archeologists (CTA 1995).
These investigations were performed in compliance with the National Historic
Preservation Act of 1966 (PL89-665), as amended in 1974, 1976, 1980, and 1992; the National
Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (PL91-190, 83 Stat. 915 USC 4231, 1970); the Procedures for the
Protection of Historic and Cultural Properties (36 CFR 800); the Archaeological Resources Protection Act
of 1979; as well as the guidelines set forth by the CTA and the Register of Professional Archaeologists.

II. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODOLOGY
The objectives of the survey were to: (1) locate cultural resource sites within the project
area; (2) delineate the vertical and horizontal extent of any located sites; (3) assess the integrity of each
site; and (4) provide a preliminary evaluation of each site’s research potential and its eligibility for
inclusion in the National Register of Historic Places (NRHP).
Prior to the initiation of fieldwork, PBS&J conducted a records search for any State
Archeological Landmark sites, Texas State Historic Markers, properties listed on or eligible for inclusion
in the NRHP, sites previously recorded and on file at the Texas Archeological Research Laboratory
(TARL) in Austin, and reports of any previous cultural resource surveys in the area on file at TARL or at
the offices of the Texas Historical Commission. The records search included an intensive examination of
the area within 1,000 ft (305 m) of the proposed ROW.
The ROW is located within the Southeast Texas Archeological Region of the Eastern
Planning Region (Kenmotsu and Perttula 1993). The natural and cultural backgrounds of the region have
received extensive attention in a recent overview paid for by the Southwestern Planning Division of the
U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (Guy 1990; Story 1990a, 1990b).
Two PBS&J archaeologists conducted a 100-percent pedestrian survey of the areas to be
impacted by the proposed transmission line and substation between November 13 and November 22,
2000. Shovel testing was conducted in an attempt to locate buried cultural deposits. Shovel tests were
placed at approximate intervals of 30 m in the vicinity of any creek or drainage crossings or other areas
considered to have a high probability for containing cultural resources, as perceived by the field
archaeologists, and at intervals of 100 m or less over the remainder of the ROW. High probability areas
were determined prior to the field effort and were adjusted during the actual survey based on microtopography, soil conditions, and the degree of surface erosion or disturbance. All shovel tests were
excavated in arbitrary 4 inch (10 cm) levels down to clay subsoil or to a maximum depth of
approximately 32 inches (80 centimeters below surface [cmbs]). The fill from each shovel test was
screened through ¼-inch (6.4-millimeter) hardware cloth. The locations of all shovel tests were mapped
on both United States Geological Survey 7.5 minute quadrangle maps and 1:4800-scale blue-line aerial
photographs. The depth of each shovel test was recorded and the sediments were described for each
arbitrary level. Each test was backfilled upon completion.

III. RESULTS
The records search conducted prior to the fieldwork for this project located only one
previously recorded prehistoric site within 1,000 ft (305 m) of the ROW. Site 41JP67 was recorded in
1977 and is described as a lithic scatter of unknown size in the TARL files (Taylor 1977). Shovel testing
within the ROW adjacent to the site revealed no cultural deposits. The proposed transmission line will
not impact this site.
The ROW transected numerous wooded areas and pastures. Vegetation consisted of
various hardwoods, shrubs, and grasses. The Natural Resources Conservation Service (formerly the Soil
Conservation Service) mapped the soils in the ROW as belonging to the Rayburn-Tehran-Kisatchie,
Tehran-Letney, Besner-Bernaldo, and Urbo-Mantachi associations. The Rayburn-Tehran-Kisatchie and
Tehran-Letney associations consist of undulating to hilly, deep, sandy and loamy upland soils. BesnerBernaldo association soils are deep, loamy soils on gently undulating terraces, while the Urbo-Mantachie
association consists of deep, nearly level, clayey and loamy soils on bottomlands (United States
department of Agriculture, Soil Conservation Service 1982). Soils encountered during the pedestrian
survey consisted generally of brown to light brown sand or sandy loam over orange clay or sandy clay
loam subsoil (Appendix Table 1).
A 100 percent visual inspection augmented by a total of 69 shovel tests revealed no
cultural resources within the proposed McGee 138-kV transmission line ROW or within the area of the
proposed McGee Substation (Appendix Figure 1).
The project area was divided into six sections or “legs” for the purpose of managing the
work in the field and tracking progress (Appendix Figure 1). The route of the proposed transmission line
traces a jagged course from the existing Mill Creek Substation just north of Cypress Branch, down to the
flood plain of the Angelina River, and across the river to the location of the proposed McGee Substation
(see Figure 2). The first leg runs from the Mill Creek Substation due west for a distance of about 4,240 ft
(1,292 m) to a county road. The second leg runs from this county road down slope to the southwest,
following an existing pipeline ROW for approximately 6,320 ft (1,926 m). The third leg parallels SH 63
for approximately 5,360 ft (1,633 m) to the northwest. The fourth leg begins from the point where the
line crosses SH 63 and continues northwest for 5,760 ft (1,755 m) to a two-track unimproved road in the
woods. The fifth leg extends from the two-track road, northwest approximately 3,600 ft (1,097 m) to the
point where the line crosses the Angelina River. The sixth and final leg of the ROW runs from the west
bank of the Angelina, to the proposed McGee Substation, a distance of approximately 4,040 ft (1,231 m).
At the time of survey, most of the first leg had been recently cleared, with the exception
of approximately 650 ft (200 m) of dense thicket on the eastern end. Ground cover was dense (estimated

440735/000397

at 75 to 80 percent), consisting of timbering debris and leaf litter. Seventeen shovel tests were placed at
intervals not exceeding 100 m and four shovel tests were placed on both sides of Cypress Branch, toward
the western end, at 30 m intervals. With few exceptions, shovel tests did not go deeper than 80 cmbs
before orange clay or clay loam subsoil was encountered. No cultural resources were found.
The second leg paralleled the northern edge of an existing pipeline ROW and had been
recently cleared along most of its length at the time of survey. Timbering debris and leaf litter formed the
ground cover (estimated at 80 percent) along most of this leg. Eighteen shovel tests were placed at
intervals of no more than 100 m. These shovel tests went no deeper that 80 cmbs before encountering
orange clay or mottled clay loam subsoil. As the survey crew moved down slope along this leg, the
sediments became increasingly water saturated. One shovel test was skipped due to standing water and
no shovel tests were placed in the western 490 ft (150 m) of the leg because of surface water. No cultural
resources were encountered.
The third leg paralleled SH 63 from the point where the ROW made a ninety-degree turn
away from the pipeline, to the point where it angled further northwest and crossed the highway.
Approximately 3,600 ft (1,100 m) of this leg had been recently timbered and was churned from heavy
vehicle activity. The southern three-quarters of this leg were largely covered by standing water and the
survey crew did not locate any rises with the potential to contain archaeological materials within this area.
The remaining one-quarter of this leg was densely wooded and higher in elevation. Surface visibility was
less than 20 percent due to pine needle duff. One shovel test was excavated at a point where a shallow
drainage cut across the ROW, marking a drop in elevation from that point further south. This shovel test
produced sand down to 80 cmbs before water was encountered. No cultural resources were encountered.
The fourth leg of the project ROW was surveyed from the point at which it crosses
SH 63, northwest to a private, two-track access road. This leg generally consisted of level terrain
containing natural rises known as “pimple mounds” or “prairie mounds.” Although the origin of these
features is uncertain, they are largely associated with terraces of Pleistocene age. This leg was overgrown
with an assortment of thickets, brush, and small trees. Ground visibility was less than 20 percent and
there were several low-lying areas that were water saturated. Shovel tests on this leg were shallow (less
than 50 cmbs to subsoil) with the exception of two that were located on either side of a steep drainage.
Shovel tests were placed on rises with the potential to contain cultural remains. None of the tests
produced any cultural materials.
The fifth leg was surveyed from the two-track access road that formed the northern
boundary of the fourth leg, west to the Angelina River. On the map this area appears flat, and the survey
confirmed that much of this portion of the ROW is low and dissected by several small drainages. Surface
visibility was less than 20 percent along the ROW, which had been timbered in the past, but was
overgrown with tall weeds, thicket, and small trees at the time of the survey. The east bank of the
Angelina River is cut by a drainage connected to Cypress Creek and is heavily eroded and steeply

440735/000397

sloping. Further to the east, the subsurface sediments were found to consist of shallow and saturated
sands. Testing in the vicinity of the two drainages that cross the ROW on this leg proved difficult, since
the land was low, flat, and poorly drained, and the water table was at or near the surface around these
drainages. Five shovel tests were judgmentally placed on rises that had the potential to contain cultural
deposits. Three shovel tests did not exceed 60 cmbs before encountering subsoil. One shovel test was
excavated to 80 cmbs in deep sand, but contained nothing. The remaining shovel test on this leg was
shallower and did not produce any cultural materials.
The sixth and final leg was surveyed from the proposed McGee Substation east to the
Angelina River. This leg cut across open pastureland on hilltops and at least three identifiable drainages.
Surface visibility was approximately 30 to 50 percent because of grazing. Uncleared areas near drainages
had much less surface visibility. Shovel tests along this leg did not go below 80 cmbs before
encountering subsoil. Shovel tests were generally placed at intervals of no more than 100 m along this
leg, with intervals of 30 m close to drainages. The slopes of the hills were eroded down to bedrock or
orange clay throughout the western two-thirds of this leg, allowing the crew to concentrate their shovel
tests in the deeper sediments. Random shovel probing was conducting between shovel tests to confirm
the shallowness of sediments and assist in placing the shovel tests on the terrain. The eastern 573 ft (175
m) of this leg consisted largely of recent sandy point bar deposits. Several shovel tests were judgmentally
placed here in an attempt to locate buried gravel bars thought to be ideal for prehistoric occupation along
the river. No cultural materials were encountered along this leg.
The final leg of the survey also included the site of the proposed McGee Substation and
five shovel tests were excavated within this fenced-in acreage. The terrain here slopes from a hilltop in
the southwest corner down toward a drainage just a few meters north of the lot. Ground cover was
minimal, but the surface inspection did not detect any cultural remains. Three shovel tests were placed in
a diagonal southwest-to-northeast line across the lot to sample the depth of the sediments down the slope
of the hill. Two more shovel tests were placed along the ridge in the south end of the lot. Subsoil was
encountered within 50 cm of the surface in all shovel tests but one, which went to a depth of 80 cmbs
before encountering clay subsoil. No cultural remains were encountered.

IV. SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS
The survey of the proposed McGee 138-kV transmission line and substation in Jasper
County identified no cultural resources within the ROW. The failure to identify any cultural resources
within this area can probably be attributed to factors of prehistoric preference, floodplain geology, and
modern erosion.
The first two legs of the survey, moving west from the Mill Creek Substation, crossed
rolling uplands characterized by broad ridge tops and side slopes above small drainages. Prehistoric sites
in such situations are generally small, with a low density of remains, and are usually closely associated
with drainages. An examination of these areas on the map (see Figure 2) shows that much of the project
ROW is located on sloping ground. The few places where the line does cross drainages were apparently
not especially attractive for prehistoric utilization. For example, the location where the ROW crosses
Cypress Branch is about 2,000 ft (609 m) upstream from a broad interfluve that may have been a more
attractive location for prehistoric occupation.
Much of the third leg, all of the fourth leg, and some of the fifth leg of the survey crossed
flat, poorly drained Pleistocene terraces. Such landforms are often characterized by the presence of
natural rises (i.e., pimple mounds or prairie mounds) that attracted prehistoric occupation due to the poor
drainage elsewhere in these areas. Again, prehistoric sites in such areas are often small with low artifact
densities. More attractive areas for prehistoric occupation may have been located to the southwest, where
former channels of the Angelina River (e.g., Gum Slough, Potato Pond Slough, and Ellis Pond Slough)
would have provided abundant aquatic and riverine resources.
The lack of cultural resources on the east bank of the Angelina River, on the fifth leg of
the survey, may be due to local floodplain dynamics. The map of the project area indicates that the
modern meander belt of the Angelina River in this region is narrowest where it is crossed by the proposed
project ROW (see Figure 2). To the north, the current meander belt is wide and is characterized by broad
meander loops. To the south, it is even wider, but instead of meander loops, there are a number of large
sloughs that represent former channels of the Angelina River, suggesting that the river in this area has
been subject to recurring episodes of avulsion (the process by which a river jumps from its old channel to
a new channel). The project ROW crossed the river in the area between these two extremes, where the
meander belt is narrowest and the meander loops are smallest. Under these circumstances, erosion and
accretion of the flood plain sediments are relatively rapid and would probably have destroyed any
prehistoric sites in this area.
The sixth leg of the survey, including the site of the proposed McGee Substation, crossed
another area of broad ridge tops and side slopes above small drainages. Again, much of the proposed

440735/000397

8

ROW crossed sloping ground, which in this case has been heavily eroded, with concomitant loss of
surface sediment down to subsoil or bedrock. The drainages are small, and occupy V-shaped valleys.
Prehistoric sites in such locations are often small, with a low density of artifacts, and are usually located
at the tops of the slopes above the drainages. The lack of prehistoric sites in this case may be due to
either erosion of the slopes above the drainages, or to the presence of more attractive site locations closer
to the Angelina River, such as those to the south of the ROW (see Figure 2). The small amount of
bottomland adjacent to the Angelina River on the eastern end of this leg consists of point bar deposits and
may be too recent to contain prehistoric remains.
Due to the lack of cultural resources along the proposed project ROW, PBS&J
recommends cultural resource clearance for the Jasper-Newton Electric Cooperative’s proposed McGee
138-kv transmission line and substation.
