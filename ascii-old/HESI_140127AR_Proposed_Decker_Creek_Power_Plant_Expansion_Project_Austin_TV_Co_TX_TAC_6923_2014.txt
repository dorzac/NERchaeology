MANAGEMENT SUMMARY

On 17 June 2014, Horizon Environmental Services, Inc. (Horizon) conducted an
intensive cultural resources survey of the City of Austin’s proposed 1.0-acre Decker Creek
Power Plant Expansion Project in Austin, Travis County, Texas (Project Area). The proposed
project would entail 1.0 acres of new construction within the existing Decker Creek Power Plant.
The Area of Potential Effect (APE) for the Project Area totals 1.0 acres. The Project Area is
owned and operated by the City of Austin.
The proposed undertaking is being sponsored by the City of Austin, a political
subdivision of the State of Texas; as such, the project would fall under the jurisdiction of the
Antiquities Code of Texas (ACT). As the project’s development represents a publicly sponsored
undertaking with the potential to impact potentially significant cultural resources, the City of
Austin is required to provide a cultural resources evaluation to assess the potential of the
proposed undertaking to impact significant cultural resources in compliance with the ACT. At
the request of The Bommarito Group, Inc., on behalf of the City of Austin, Horizon conducted
the cultural resources survey of the Project Area in compliance with the ACT. The purpose of
the survey was to determine if the development of the Project Area would have the potential to
adversely affect any significant cultural resources designated as or considered eligible for formal
designation as State Antiquities Landmarks (SAL). The cultural resources survey was
performed under Texas Antiquities Permit No. 6923.
The survey of the Project Area resulted in entirely negative findings. No cultural
materials were observed on the surface of the Project Area or within any of the 6 excavated
shovel tests. The number of shovel tests required by the Texas State Minimum Archeological
Survey Standards for a project area of this size was exceeded. In general, the Project Area
contained gravelly clay and limestone gravels. Most surficial sediments exhibited mottling or
other signs of prior disturbance. These disturbed soils would have likely confined any cultural
materials to shallow deposits and would not have facilitated deeply buried deposits.
Based on the negative survey results, it is Horizon’s opinion that the proposed Decker
Creek Power Plant Expansion Project will have no adverse effect on significant cultural
resources designated as or considered eligible for formal designation as SALs. Horizon
therefore recommends that City of Austin be allowed to proceed with the construction of the
proposed power plant expansion relative to the jurisdiction of the ACT. However, in the unlikely

event that any cultural materials (including human remains or burial features) are inadvertently
discovered at any point during construction, use, or ongoing maintenance of the Project Area,
even in previously surveyed areas, all work at the location of the discovery should cease
immediately, and the Texas Historical Commission (THC) should be notified of the discovery.

1.0 INTRODUCTION

Horizon Environmental Services, Inc. (Horizon) was contracted by The Bommarito
Group, Inc. to conduct an intensive cultural resources survey of the City of Austin’s proposed
1.0-acre Decker Creek Power Plant Expansion Project in Austin, Travis County, Texas (Project
Area) (Figures 1-1 and 1-2). The proposed project would entail 1.0 acres of new construction
within the existing Decker Creek Power Plant. The Area of Potential Effect (APE) for the Project
Area totals 1.0 acres. The Project Area is owned and operated by the City of Austin.
The proposed undertaking is being sponsored by the City of Austin, a political
subdivision of the State of Texas; as such, the project would fall under the jurisdiction of the
Antiquities Code of Texas (ACT). As the project’s development represents a publicly sponsored
undertaking with the potential to impact potentially significant cultural resources, the City of
Austin is required to provide a cultural resources evaluation to assess the potential of the
proposed undertaking to impact significant cultural resources in compliance with the ACT. At
the request of The Bommarito Group, Inc., on behalf of the City of Austin, Horizon conducted
the cultural resources survey of the Project Area in compliance with the ACT. The purpose of
the survey was to determine if the development of the Project Area would have the potential to
adversely affect any significant cultural resources designated as or considered eligible for formal
designation as State Antiquities Landmarks (SAL). The cultural resources survey was
performed under Texas Antiquities Permit No. 6923.
The cultural resources investigations consisted of an archival review, an intensive
cultural resources survey of the Project Area, and the production of a report suitable for review
by the State Historic Preservation Officer (SHPO) in accordance with the Texas Historical
Commission’s (THC) Rules of Practice and Procedure, Chapter 26, Section 27, and the Council
of Texas Archeologists (CTA) Guidelines for Cultural Resources Management Reports.
Jennifer L. Cochran served as the Principal Investigator for this project, and Briana Smith
(Horizon staff archeologist) conducted the field investigations.
Horizon conducted the survey of the Project Area on 17 June 2014. This entailed
intensive surface inspection and subsurface shovel testing efforts. The Texas State Minimum
Archeological Survey Standards (TSMASS) require a minimum of 3 shovel tests per acre on
projects between 0.0 and 2.0 acres in size. As such, a total of 3 shovel tests were necessary

within the Project Area in order to comply with the TSMASS. Horizon exceeded the minimum
survey standards by excavating 6 shovel tests within the boundaries of the Project Area.
The survey of the Project Area resulted in entirely negative findings. No cultural
materials were observed on the surface of the Project Area or within any of the 6 excavated
shovel tests. In general, the Project Area contained gravelly clay and limestone gravels. Most
surficial sediments exhibited mottling or other signs of prior disturbance. These disturbed soils
would have likely confined any cultural materials to shallow deposits and would not have
facilitated deeply buried deposits.
Based on the negative survey results, it is Horizon’s opinion that the proposed Decker
Creek Power Plant Expansion Project will have no adverse effect on significant cultural
resources designated as or considered eligible for formal designation as SALs. Horizon
therefore recommends that City of Austin be allowed to proceed with the construction of the
proposed power plant expansion relative to the jurisdiction of the ACT. However, in the unlikely
event that any cultural materials (including human remains or burial features) are inadvertently
discovered at any point during construction, use, or ongoing maintenance of the Project Area,
even in previously surveyed areas, all work at the location of the discovery should cease
immediately, and the THC should be notified of the discovery.

2.1

GENERAL DESCRIPTION

The cultural resources survey reported herein assessed the proposed 1.0-acre Decker
Creek Power Plant Expansion Project in east-central Travis County, Texas. The Project Area
is situated approximately 2.3 miles (3.7 km) southwest of the intersection of Decker Lane and
U.S. Highway 290, and can be found on the US Geological Survey (USGS) 7.5-minute Manor,
Texas, topographic quadrangle (see Figure 1-1). Overall, the Project Area is located within the
eastern portion of the existing Decker Creek Power Plant. Vegetation within the Project Area
consists of short grasses. Photographs of the Project Area are provided in Figures 2-1 to 2-3.

2.2

PHYSIOGRAPHY AND HYDROLOGY

The proposed Project Area is located in east-central Travis County, Texas, near the
boundary of 3 significant physiographic provinces—the Blackland Prairie, the Edwards Plateau,
and the Gulf Coastal Plain. The Blackland Prairie, within which the Project Area is situated, is a
narrow physiographic zone between the Edwards Plateau to the west and the Gulf Coastal Plain
to the east. It is a low, rolling land that extends in a narrow band along the eastern edge of the
Balcones fault zone from the Red River Valley in northeastern Texas to the southern edge of
the Edwards Plateau. This is an area of low topographic relief and poor drainage in which water
often ponds after rainstorms, and streams flow at very gentle gradients. The Edwards Plateau
and Balcones Escarpment are associated with a great fault system that arcs across Texas to
form a distinct boundary between uplands composed primarily of limestone bedrock and lower
plains composed mostly of softer rocks. In places, this boundary is marked by an abrupt scarp
(the Balcones Escarpment) and in others by a more gradational ramp, but the entire length of
this transition zone is a major ecotone in terms of topography, bedrock, hydrology, soil,
vegetation, and animal life. The Project Area is situated on an upland formation to Decker
Creek that was extensively modified in 1970 during the construction of the Decker Creek Power
Plant built in 1970. The Project Area slopes gradually down to the south and east toward Walter
E. Long Lake, ranging in elevation from approximately 560.0 to 570.0 feet (170.0 to 173.8 m)
above mean sea level (amsl).

Hydrologically, the Project Area is situated within the Colorado River basin. The Project
Area is situated adjacent to the western bank of Walter E. Long Lake. In 1967, Decker Creek
was dammed to form Decker Lake. In 1978, the reservoir was renamed the Walter E. Long
Lake (TSHA 2014a). Walter E. Long Lake discharges to the southeast into Decker Creek
approximately 1.6 miles (2.6 km) to the southeast of the Project Area. Decker Creek and
Gilleland Creek converge approximately 5.6 miles (9.0 km) southeast of the Project Area.
Gilleland Creek, in turn, flows generally southward to its confluence with the Colorado River,
which in turn flows southeastward across the Blackland Prairie and the Gulf Coastal Plain, and
ultimately discharges into the Gulf of Mexico a short distance northeast of Matagorda Bay,
approximately 185.0 miles (298.0 km) to the southeast of the Project Area.

2.3

GEOLOGY AND GEOMORPHOLOGY

The proposed Project Area is underlain by a thick sequence of Cretaceous-age,
sedimentary rock strata. In Travis County, soils formed primarily over sedimentary deposits of
Upper Cretaceous age, and soil parent material consists of chalk, marl, limestone, and marly
limestone (Werchan et al. 1974). In the central part of Travis County, soils formed over the
Upper Cretaceous Navarro (Kna) and Taylor Group (Kta) formations. Late Pleistocene- and
Holocene-age alluvial deposits are mapped adjacent to some of the more prominent streams,
creeks, and rivers in Travis County; however, no alluvial sediments are mapped within the
current Project Area.

HJN 140127 AR

Chapter 2.0: Environmental Setting

Geomorphologically, the Project Area is situated on the Houston Black-Heiden
Association (NRCS 2014). This soil association is composed of deep, nearly level and gently
sloping, gravelly, calcareous, and clayey sediments overlying marl on uplands in the Edwards
Plateau physiographic region. One defined soil type is mapped within the boundaries of the
Project Area. This soil type is described in Table 2-1 (NRCS 2014), and its distribution is
mapped in Figure 2-4.
While aboriginal cultural resources are commonly encountered in deep alluvial
sediments adjacent to major streams in Central Texas, the relative antiquity of the preHolocene-age uplands in the Project Area suggests that any cultural resources would be
constrained to the modern ground surface, rather than in buried contexts, in erosional settings
lacking integrity. Intact, buried archeological deposits may occur within alluvial sediments near
major streams, though no Holocene-age alluvial sediments are mapped within the current
Project Area. The terrain within the Project Area consists of Upper Cretaceous-age limestone
and shale upland formations. Erosion along with ground disturbance from the existing Decker
Creek Power Plant facilities has been relatively extensive within the Project Area, and little
Holocene-age sediment remains on the surface of the upland structure. No alluvial sediments
with the potential to contain buried, intact archeological deposits are mapped within the Project
Area. Other things being equal, any cultural resources associated with the soils mapped in the
Project Area would be expected to occur on the modern ground surface in deflated, eroded
contexts that would lack stratigraphic integrity. Historic-era resources may be found in virtually
any physiographic environment.

2.4

CLIMATE

Evidence for climatic change from the Pleistocene to the present is most often obtained
through studies of pollen and faunal sequences (Bryant and Holloway 1985; Collins 1995).
Bryant and Holloway (1985) present a sequence of climatic change for nearby east-central
Texas from the Wisconsin Full Glacial period (22,500 to 14,000 BP) through the Late Glacial
period (14,000 to 10,000 BP) to the Post-Glacial period (10,000 BP to present). Evidence from
the Wisconsin Full Glacial period suggests that the climate in east-central Texas was
considerably cooler and more humid than at present. Pollen data indicate that the region was
more heavily forested in deciduous woodlands than during later periods (Bryant and Holloway
1985). The Late Glacial period was characterized by slow climatic deterioration and a slow
warming and/or drying trend (Collins 1995). In east-central Texas, the deciduous woodlands
were gradually replaced by grasslands and post oak savannas (Bryant and Holloway 1985).
During the Post-Glacial period, the east-central Texas environment appears to have been more
stable. The deciduous forests had long since been replaced by prairies and post oak savannas.
The drying and/or warming trend that began in the Late Glacial period continued into the midHolocene, at which point there appears to have been a brief amelioration to more mesic
conditions lasting from roughly 6000 to 5000 BP. Recent studies by Bryant and Holloway
(1985) indicate that modern environmental conditions in east-central Texas were probably
achieved by 1500 years ago.

Travis County is located within the south-central climatic division. The modern climate is
typically dry to subhumid with long, hot summers and short, mild winters. The climate is
influenced primarily by tropical maritime air masses from the Gulf of Mexico, but it is modified by
polar air masses. Tropical maritime air masses predominate throughout spring, summer, and
fall. Modified polar air masses are dominant in winter and provide a continental climate
characterized by considerable variations in temperature.
On average throughout the past century, precipitation and temperature manifest regional
clines with mean annual precipitation totals declining fairly regularly from east to west and mean
annual temperature declining equally evenly from northwest to southeast (Larkin and Bomar
1983:18, 50). Climate has fluctuated from subtropical humid to subtropical subhumid in Travis
County.
Average annual precipitation totals 32.0 inches (81.0 centimeters [cm]) and
temperature averages 19.0° Celsius (67.0° Fahrenheit [F]) annually, ranging from 36.0° Celsius
(96.0° F) in August (the warmest month) to 15.0° Celsius (59.0° F) in January (the coldest
month). During this time, however, drier periods lasting from 3 to 7 years, when total annual
rainfall ranged from 12.0 to 25.0 inches (30.0 to 64.0 cm), were followed by abnormally wet
years with 45.0 to 50.0 inches (114.0 to 127.0 cm) of rainfall.
Two annual precipitation peaks, which typically occur in May and September, are associated
with frontal storms that form when southward-moving cool air masses collide with warm, moist
air masses moving inland from the Gulf of Mexico (Bomar 1983; Carr 1967). The topographic
discontinuity along the Balcones Escarpment lies directly in the path of the Gulf storm trace and
increases the lift in convective storms to produce extreme amounts of rainfall (Baker 1975).
Two extreme examples are the excess of 36.0 inches (91.0 cm) of rain that fell within an 18hour period in the vicinity of Thrall, Texas, in September 1921, and the 22.0-inch-(56.0-cm)
deluge that fell in less than 3 hours near O’Harris, Texas, in May 1935 (Baker 1975). Lower
rainfall amounts are characteristic of winter and late summer. In winter, frontal storms pass so
frequently that there is little time for moisture to increase, and prevailing upper-level winds from
west to east often dominate over meridional flow, meaning that much of the available moisture
is derived from the Pacific rather than from the Gulf of Mexico. In summer, cool fronts rarely
penetrate into the region, and rainfall occurs primarily as localized, thermal convective storms.

2.5

FLORA AND FAUNA

The Project Area is in the southwestern portion of the Texan biotic province (Blair 1950),
an intermediate zone between the forests of the Austroriparian and Carolinian provinces and the
grasslands of the Kansan, Balconian, and Tamaulipan provinces. Some species reach the
limits of their ecological range within the Texan province. The boundary, characterized as

Austin, Travis County, Texas

“approximate,” between Blair’s (1950) Texan and Balconian provinces passes through Travis
County in the vicinity of the Project Area.
The fauna associated with this region are represented by a mixture of species from the
Austroriparian, Tamaulipan, Chihuahuan, Kansan, Balconian, and Texan biotic provinces.
Common mammalian species include white-tailed deer, opossum, eastern cottontail rabbit,
raccoon, striped skunk, hispid cotton rat, white-footed mouse, nine-banded armadillo, and fox
squirrel. Common bird species include northern bobwhite, eastern meadowlark, mourning dove,
killdeer, field sparrow, red-tailed hawk, turkey vulture, belted kingfisher, and mockingbird.
Reptile and amphibian species common to this biotic zone include six-lined racerunner, rat
snake, eastern hognose snake, Gulf Coast toad, Texas spiny lizard, rough green snake,
copperhead, western diamondback rattlesnake, green treefrog, Blanchard’s cricket frog,
diamondback water snake, Houston toad, and green anole. Although small herds of bison and
antelope were common during the late prehistoric and early historic periods, these species are
no longer native to this region (Jurney et al. 1989:13-14).

3.0 CULTURAL BACKGROUND

The Project Area is located within Prewitt’s (1981, 1985) Central Texas Archeological
Region. Prewitt (1981, 1985) demarcated the southeastern boundary of the Central Texas
Archeological Region at the town of Bastrop in Bastrop County, which borders Travis County on
the southeast. The indigenous human inhabitants of Central Texas practiced a generally
nomadic hunting and gathering lifestyle throughout all of prehistory, and, in contrast to much of
the rest of North America, mobility and settlement patterns do not appear to have changed
markedly through time in this region.

3.1

PALEOINDIAN PERIOD (CA. 12,000 TO 8500 B.P.)

The initial human occupations in the New World can now be confidently extended back
before 12,000 B.P. (Dincauze 1984; Haynes et al. 1984; Kelly and Todd 1988; Lynch 1990;
Meltzer 1989). Evidence from Meadowcroft Rockshelter in Pennsylvania suggests that humans
were present in Eastern North America as early as 14,000 to 16,000 years ago (Adovasio et al.
1990), while more recent discoveries at Monte Verde in Chile provide unequivocal evidence for
human occupation in South America by at least 12,500 years ago (Dillehay 1989, 1997; Meltzer
et al. 1997). Most archeologists presently discount claims of much earlier human occupation
during the Pleistocene glacial period (cf. Butzer 1988).
The earliest generalized evidence for human activities in Central Texas is represented
by the PaleoIndian period (12,000 to 8500 B.P.) (Collins 1995). This stage coincided with
ameliorating climatic conditions following the close of the Pleistocene epoch that witnessed the
extinction of herds of mammoth, horse, camel, and bison. Cultures representing various
periods within this stage are characterized by series of distinctive, relatively large, often fluted,
lanceolate projectile points. These points are frequently associated with spurred end scrapers,
gravers, and bone foreshafts. PaleoIndian groups are often inferred to have been organized
into egalitarian bands consisting of a few dozen individuals that practiced a fully nomadic
subsistence and settlement pattern. Due to poor preservation of floral materials, subsistence
patterns in Central Texas are known primarily through the study of faunal remains. Subsistence
focused on the exploitation of plants, small animals, fish, and shellfish, even during the
PaleoIndian period. There is little evidence in this region for hunting of extinct megafauna, as
has been documented elsewhere in North America. Rather, a broad-based subsistence pattern
appears to have been practiced throughout all prehistoric time periods. In Central Texas, the
PaleoIndian stage is divided into 2 periods based on recognizable differences in projectile point

HJN 140127 AR

13

Chapter 3.0: Cultural Background

styles. These include the Early PaleoIndian period, which is recognized based on large, fluted
projectile points (i.e., Clovis, Folsom, Dalton, San Patrice, and Big Sandy), and the Late
PaleoIndian period, which is characterized by unfluted lanceolate points (i.e., Plainview,
Scottsbluff, Meserve, and Angostura).

3.2

ARCHAIC PERIOD (CA. 8500 TO 1200 B.P.)

The onset of the Hypsithermal drying trend marks the beginning of the Archaic period
(8500 to 1200 B.P.) (Collins 1995). This climatic trend marked the beginning of a significant
reorientation of lifestyle throughout most of North America, but this change was far less
pronounced in Central Texas. Elsewhere, the changing climatic conditions and corresponding
decrease in the big game populations forced people to rely more heavily upon a diversified
resource base composed of smaller game and wild plants. In Central Texas, however, this
hunting and gathering pattern is characteristic of most of prehistory. The appearance of a more
diversified tool kit, the development of an expanded groundstone assemblage, and a general
decrease in the size of projectile points are hallmarks of this cultural stage. Material culture
shows greater diversity during this broad cultural period, especially in the application of
groundstone technology.
Traditionally, the Archaic period is subdivided into Early, Middle, and Late subperiods.
Changes in projectile point morphology are often used as markers differentiating these
3 subperiods, though other changes in material culture occurred as well. Perhaps most
markedly, burned rock middens appear during the Middle Archaic subperiod, continuing into the
Late Archaic subperiod, and large cemeteries appear during the Late Archaic subperiod. In
addition, the increasing density of prehistoric sites through time is often considered to constitute
evidence of population growth, though differential preservation probably at least partially
accounts for the lower numbers of older sites.

3.3

LATE PREHISTORIC PERIOD (CA. 1200 TO 350 B.P.)

The onset of the Late Prehistoric period (1200 to 350 B.P.) (Collins 1995) is defined by
the appearance of the bow and arrow. In Central Texas, pottery also appears during the Late
Prehistoric period (though ceramics appear earlier in Southeast Texas). Use of the atlatl (i.e.,
spearthrower) and spear was generally discontinued during the Late Prehistoric period, though
they continued to be used in the inland subregion of Southeast Texas along with the bow and
arrow through the Late Prehistoric period (Patterson 1980, 1995; Wheat 1953). In Texas,
unifacial arrow points appear to be associated with a small prismatic blade technology. The
Late Prehistoric period is generally divided into 2 phases, the Austin and Toyah phases. Austin
phase sites occur earliest to the north, which has led some researchers (e.g., Prewitt 1985) to
suggest that the Austin-phase populations of Central Texas were migrants from the north, and
lack the ceramic industry of the later Toyah phase.

3.4

HISTORIC PERIOD (CA. 350 B.P. TO PRESENT)

The first European incursion into what is now known as Texas was in 1519, when
Álvarez de Pineda explored the northern shores of the Gulf of Mexico. In 1528, Cabeza de

14

Vaca crossed South Texas after being shipwrecked along the Texas Coast near Galveston Bay.
However, European settlement did not seriously disrupt native ways of life until after 1700. The
first half of the 18th century was the period in which the fur trade and mission system, as well as
the first effects of epidemic diseases, began to seriously disrupt the native culture and social
systems. This process is clearly discernible at the Mitchell Ridge site, where burial data
suggest population declines and group mergers (Ricklis 1994) as well as increased participation
on the part of the Native American population in the fur trade. By the time that heavy settlement
of Texas began in the early 1800s by Anglo-Americans, the indigenous Indian population was
greatly diminished.
The Tonkawa and the Lipan Apache Indians were well established in Central Texas by
the 14th century, and Comanche and Kiowa tribes arrived in the area by the 18th century1. The
first European known to have crossed the region was Domingo Terán de los Ríos, who made an
inspection tour to East Texas in 1691. When the Spanish moved their missions out of East
Texas in 1730, they relocated the missions of San Francisco de los Neches, Nuestra Señora de
la Purísima Concepción de los Hasinai, and San José de los Nazonis to locations near Barton
Springs. In 1827, the Mexican government granted Stephen F. Austin his third colony, Little
Colony, which was located east of the Colorado River and north and west of the Old San
Antonio Road. Mina (later Bastrop) became the headquarters of the colony, and Travis County
developed as an offshoot of Mina. Settlers moving into the area in the early 1830s included
Josiah and Mathias Wilbarger, Reuben Hornsby, Jacob M. Harrell, and John F. Webber. The
onset of the Texas Revolution delayed further settlement activity, and the news of the fall of the
Alamo prompted those settlers already in residence to flee.
Settlement resumed after the revolution, but it proceeded slowly because of the constant
threat of raids by the Comanche Indians. During the 1830s, a chain of small forts extended
from Bastrop northwest along Wilbarger’s Bend, Coleman Branch, Webber’s Prairie, and
Gilleland Creek, to Fort Colorado or Fort Prairie, 5.0 miles (8 km) east of the site of present-day
Austin. In June 1835, Thomas Jefferson Chambers surveyed part of an 8-league grant covering
the present-day site of Austin and the capitol. Sometime before 1837, William Barton settled
near the springs that were to bear his name. In 1837 or 1838, President Mirabeau B. Lamar
was on a buffalo hunt in the area and commented on its possibilities as a permanent site for the
capital. In 1838, the community of Waterloo (later Austin) consisted of 4 families, and about
20 families established homes at nearby Montopolis in 1839. When the Congress of the
Republic of Texas chose Waterloo as the site of the new capital, opponents were quick to point
out the disadvantages—the site's proximity to the frontier, the lack of timber, the poor soil, and
the threat of Indian raids. In spite of this opposition, however, the new capital—renamed Austin
in honor of Stephen F. Austin—was approved on 19 January 1840. A few days later, the
Congress established Travis County, naming it in honor of William Barret Travis and making
Austin its county seat. An election for county officials was held in February 1840, at which time
the population was reported to be 856. The initial boundaries of Travis County included roughly

40,000 square miles. Counties that were later carved from Travis County include Callahan
(1858), Coleman (1858), Comal (1846), Gillespie (1848), Hays (1848), Burnet (1852), Brown
(1856), Lampasas (1856), Eastland (1858), Runnels (1858), and Taylor (1858). Sam Houston
moved the government of the Republic of Texas from Austin to Houston when Mexican troops
invaded San Antonio in March 1842. When he tried to have the government archives removed
as well, Austin citizens resisted with the Archives War. The Texas Congress held sessions at
Washington-on-the-Brazos from 1842 to 1845, but the convention that drafted the Constitution
of 1845 met in Austin in July 1845, and by October the rest of the government had returned to
the capital city. The first legislature of the new state convened in Austin in February 1846.
The late 1840s and early 1850s were building years for Austin and Travis County, with
much of the growth fed by the presence of the state government—the Governor's Mansion,
office buildings, hotels, new homes, and newspapers. In 1850, Travis County had a population
of 3,138, of whom 2,336 were white, 791 were slaves, and 11 were free blacks; by 1860, the
number of residents had more than doubled to 8,080, with 4,931 of them white, 3,136 slaves,
and 13 free blacks. Although the city of Austin grew faster than the county as a whole—its
population rose from 629 in 1850 to 3,494 in 1860—most county residents lived in small
communities. Pflugerville and Del Valle were the most prominent of these communities, but
rural post offices were also established at Bluff Springs, Webberville, Merrilltown, Gilleland,
Cage’s Mill, and Hornsby Bend. During the 1850s, the amount of land in farms in what was
then Travis County increased from 73,300 to 1,363,500 acres. Corn was the primary field crop,
while cattle and sheep were the principal livestock. In 1860, farmers produced 137,700 bushels
of corn and 27,900 bushels of wheat and had 58,000 cattle and 11,800 sheep.
The earliest schools in Travis County were private institutions that usually met in private
homes or in space donated by a church or Masonic lodge. More elaborate private facilities
began to appear by the late 1840s, including Colorado Female College in 1848, Austin Male
and Female Academy in 1849, Austin Female Academy in 1850, and Austin Collegiate Female
Institute in 1852. By 1850, Travis County also had 6 public schools serving a scholastic
population of 183. The county was divided into 19 common school districts in 1852. The state
established the Asylum for the Blind in Austin in 1856 and the Deaf and Dumb School in 1857.
Travis County became a center for higher education in the 1880s with the establishment of the
University of Texas in 1881, Tillotson Collegiate and Normal Institute in 1881, and Saint
Edward's University in 1885. Samuel Huston College began holding classes in the 1890s. The
Austin Presbyterian Theological Seminary opened in 1902, Texas Wesleyan College Academy
in 1912, Concordia Lutheran College in 1926, and the Episcopal Theological Seminary of the
Southwest in 1952. Austin Community College began operations in 1972. The availability of
schools resulted in a high level of education for a large portion of the county’s population. In the
1940s, while more rural areas of the state reported that less than 10% of their population over
the age of 25 had high school diplomas, nearly 20% of Travis County residents had graduated.
By 1980, that number had jumped to 75%.
The earliest churches in Travis County were the Catholic missions relocated to the area
by the Spanish in 1730, but these were moved to San Antonio in 1731, and it was more than a
century before any organized religious practices were firmly established. In the 1830s, a variety

16

140127_arch_survey_report

An Intensive Cultural Resources Survey of the Proposed Decker Creek Power Plant Expansion Project,
Austin, Travis County, Texas

of religious groups began to appear—Methodist circuit riders held services along Gilleland
Creek in 1837 or 1838; Presbyterians organized a church in Austin in October 1839; Mormons
settled near Fort Coleman, Webberville, and Hornsby Bend in the late 1830s; and Catholic
priests, among them Jean Marie Odin, returned to the area in 1840. A Baptist church and a
Church of Christ were organized in Austin in 1847, a Lutheran church was established in New
Sweden, a Jewish synagogue in Austin began in 1876, and a Christian Science church formed
in Austin in 1889. In the early 1980s, Travis County’s 266 churches had an estimated combined
membership of 194,194; Catholic, Southern Baptist, and United Methodist were the largest
denominations.
In spite of the rapid growth that Travis County experienced during the 1850s, the area
was at that time still very much at the edge of the frontier. The absence of railroads meant that
goods had to be shipped by wagon to and from Houston and Port Lavaca, and poor roads
meant that goods sometimes could not be shipped at all. In 1852, the Austin Railroad
Association was established to encourage railroad construction to the area, and considerable
progress had been made by the late 1850s; however, the Civil War intervened, and work on
railroad acquisition was postponed. The Secession Convention convened in Austin on
28 January 1861. Although a group of Austin citizens staged a demonstration in favor of
secession, Unionist sentiment was high, and Travis County residents voted against secession,
704 to 450. Nevertheless, when the Civil War began, Travis County provided several hundred
volunteers, among them the Travis Rifles, the Tom Green Rifles, the Capitol Guard, and the
Austin City Light Infantry. In the 2 months between the end of the war and the arrival of federal
troops in the county, looting of farms and businesses was common. Although the inevitable
clashes between the Unionist forces and the former rebels resulted in the arrest of as many as
30 people per day, the presence of federal troops served to curb much of the lawlessness. By
early 1866, most of the federal soldiers had been mustered out of service, leaving only about
200 men to police the Austin area until the end of the military occupation in 1870. Austin was
the site of the constitutional conventions of 1866 and 1868-69 and witnessed both the removal
of Governor James W. Throckmorton in 1867 and the Coke-Davis Controversy in 1874. In the
gubernatorial election of 1869, Travis County residents favored Andrew J. Hamilton to Edmund
J. Davis by a margin of 798 to 593.
Like most areas in the south, Travis County suffered considerable economic hardship
immediately after the Civil War and throughout the Reconstruction period. Between 1864 and
1866, the county as a whole experienced a 49% loss in property tax receipts. Roughly 2/3 of
this property loss was in slaves, with the rest coming from declines in farm and livestock values,
each of which fell 25 to 40%. The county began to show signs of recovery by 1880. The overall
population rose from 13,153 in 1870 to 27,028 in 1880, and the 1880 census reported
1,912 farms, an increase of 656 over the 1870 totals. The amount of improved land rose from
83,200 acres in 1870 to 139,800 in 1880. Field crops such as corn, cotton, wheat, and oats
took up nearly half of the improved farmland, while livestock dominated the rest.
Economic recovery was facilitated by the arrival of the Houston and Texas Central
Railway, which completed its track to Austin in 1871, and the International and Great Northern
Railroad, which was built between Rockdale and Austin in 1876 and completed from Austin to

HJN 140127 AR

Chapter 3.0: Cultural Background

Laredo in 1881. The Austin and Northwestern Railroad laid track between Austin and Burnet in
1882, and the Missouri, Kansas and Texas line arrived in 1904. Communities besides Austin
that benefited directly from easy railroad access included Pflugerville, Manor, Oak Hill, and
Manchaca.
After the war, many former slaves remained in the area. In the year after the war, the
black population increased by 60%, while the white population rose by only 12%. By 1870,
black residents numbered 4,647, comprising 35% of the county's total population. Clarksville,
Kincheonville, Masontown, and Wheatville were among the communities established by former
slaves. The number of black residents in Travis County continued to increase steadily, reaching
13,299 in 1900. It fluctuated between 13,000 and 15,000 from 1900 to 1930, but increased
rapidly thereafter, rising to 22,493 in 1950, 32,270 in 1970, and 63,173 in 1990. Because other
segments of the population grew at an even faster rate, the percentage of black residents, with
respect to the total population, declined significantly, falling to 20% by 1930 and 11% by 1990.
Contributing to the shift in the ethnic makeup of the county was a variety of immigrant groups,
the most prominent of which were German, Swedish, and Mexican. By the turn of the century,
8% of the population was composed of natives of 1 of these countries. Although the early
Swedish and German settlers contributed to the diversity of Travis County through their religious
and educational institutions, the Mexican influence was also reinforced by the continued arrival
of large numbers of new immigrants fleeing the unrest of the Mexican Revolution in the early
20th century. The 1930 census reported that 10,225 residents, or 13% of the county’s total
population, were of Hispanic descent; by 1990, the number of Hispanic residents had risen to
121,689, or 21%.
In 1890, Travis County had 36,322 residents. Of these, 14,575 lived in Austin, which
was fast outgrowing its efforts to become a modern city. Innovations and improvements in
progress at that time included a trolley system and water-generated electricity, but most of its
streets remained unpaved. By the turn of the century several hundred assorted businesses
filled the needs of the 22,000 Austin residents. Yet, in spite of this rapid increase in Austin’s
population, the majority of the county’s residents lived on farms or in smaller towns, and
agriculture dominated the area economy. Cotton became the principal field crop in the late
1880s and remained so for more than 60 years. The 1890 census reported 65,000.0 acres—
nearly 30% of the county's improved farmland—planted in cotton; by the turn of the century, the
amount of land devoted to cotton had increased to 113,300.0 acres, or 56% of the improved
farmland. However, as more marginal land was used and the soil became depleted, production
levels fell; in 1930, 143,000.0 acres produced only 19,000 bales. By the late 1950s, cotton
accounted for only 26% of the total cropland harvested, and by 1980 it had fallen to only 8%.
Farm tenancy had increased steadily since the 1890s and peaked in 1930, with tenants
operating 2/3 of the 3,642 farms. The number of farms fell by more than 1,000 in the 1930s, as
many tenant farmers either moved away or turned to other occupations. Farmers who remained
in the area began to devote more of their resources to crops other than cotton and to livestock.
The number of cattle increased from 32,000 in 1920 and to 51,000 in 1950; the number of
sheep and goats increased as well, boosting wool and mohair production from 23,600 and
4,292 pounds, respectively, in 1920, and to 127,800 and 183,600 pounds in 1959. By the late
1960s, hay and sorghum combined to account for 60% of the cropland harvested.

The Great Depression was slow to hit Travis County, but, by the mid-1930s, many
people were unemployed and very glad of the New Deal programs that resulted in work paving
streets; building bridges, sewers, and parks; and constructing the tower of the University of
Texas campus. In part because of the job opportunities made available through relief projects,
state government, and the university community, the population increased by 43% in the 1930s,
rising from 77,777 in 1930 to 111,053 in 1940. One major job-producing project in the 1930s
was the construction of a series of dams on the Colorado River. Austin and Travis County had
begun efforts to tame the Colorado as early as 1869, when the army built a pontoon bridge
across the river. In 1893, the City of Austin completed a dam designed to provide power for its
water and electrical systems. By 1899, the city was already experiencing power shortfalls, and
a major flood in 1900 destroyed the dam. Another flood in 1915 washed out the repairs that
were underway, and the project was abandoned. The flood of 1935 put much of downtown
Austin under water, and the area’s interest in a lasting flood-control system was renewed. The
Lower Colorado River Authority was established and a series of dams was built, forming Lake
Austin, Lake Travis, Lake Buchanan, Lake Lyndon B. Johnson, Inks Lake, and Lake Marble
Falls.
Travis County also profited from the establishment of several military bases. Camp
Mabry in northwest Austin, established as the main Texas National Guard facility in 1890,
served as an army training center during World War I. After the US became involved in World
War II, the Del Valle Army Air Base, soon renamed Bergstrom Army Air Field, was established
in southeast Travis County. After the war was over, the presence of military personnel
continued to bring changes to the county. Thousands of returning veterans enrolled in the local
colleges and universities, greatly increasing the student population as well as intensifying the
demand for housing and the growth of service industries.
In the 1950s and 1960s, Travis County underwent 2 significant developments. The first
of these was desegregation. The Sweatt v. Painter decision in 1950 pushed the University of
Texas to the forefront in the fight for civil rights, leading it to become the first southern university
to admit blacks as undergraduates, although it was not until 1962 that all of the university’s
facilities were fully integrated. Public schools in Travis County began to follow suit in 1955.
Local Mexican-American organizations also achieved a measure of success against
discriminatory practices. Some local businesses resisted these changes, prompting strikes and
protests in the 1960s, but in the end desegregation was accomplished without the violence
prevalent in other urban areas of the country. The change became even more visible as blacks
and Hispanics were elected to public office—Wilhelmina Delco to the school board in 1968 and
to the Texas House of Representatives in 1976; Berl Handcox to the Austin city council in 1971;
Richard Moya to the Travis County commissioner’s court in 1970; and Gonzalo Barrientos to the
Texas House of Representatives in 1974.
The second major development was the
establishment of several high-tech industries. In 1951, a small, local company became Texas
Instruments, and in 1955 Tracor, Incorporated, made Austin its base of operations.
International Business Machines opened an Austin branch in 1967, followed by Motorola in
1974. These companies, along with Microelectronics and Computer Technology Corporation
(1983), Dell Computers (1984), and Sematech (1988), became the county’s largest employers.

Chapter 3.0: Cultural Background

From the end of Reconstruction to the present, most Travis County residents chose to
support Democratic presidential candidates, with exceptions in 1896, 1928, 1952, 1956, 1972,
and 1984. Occasionally, a third-party candidate drew a sizable portion of the vote, but only 3 of
them—the Greenback-Labor candidate in 1880, George Wallace in 1968, and John Anderson in
1984—garnered sufficient support to affect the county’s overall election results. In state
elections, Travis County residents were staunchly Democratic. In the early 1980s, 63% of the
land in Travis County was devoted to farms and ranches. About 23% of the farmland was under
cultivation, with sorghum, hay, wheat, and cotton accounting for nearly 70% of the 94,000 acres
harvested; other crops included potatoes, sweet potatoes, peaches, and pecans. Sixty-six
percent of the county’s $32 million in agricultural receipts came from livestock and livestock
products, the most important ones being cattle, milk, sheep, wool, and hogs. Although
agriculture remained an important aspect of the local economy, farm receipts were greatly
surpassed by the income generated by non-agricultural industries. Professional and related
services, manufacturing, wholesale and retail trade, and government administration involved
70% of the work force in the 1980s; of the rest, 7% were self-employed and 3% employed
outside the county.
Since shortly after the turn of the century, the majority of Travis County residents had
resided in the City of Austin. The jobs made available by the growth of the high-tech industries
reinforced that trend, and, by 1970, 85% of the 295,516 residents lived in the capital city. In the
1970s and 1980s, however, residential development near Lake Travis encouraged many people
to move away from the city, and although Austin continued to grow at a rapid pace, the number
of residents choosing to live near the lake and in northern and southern suburbs increased at an
even faster rate. By 1990, Lago Vista (2,199), Jonestown (1,250), Briarcliff (335), Lakeway
(4,044), and Pflugerville (4,444) in Travis County, as well as Round Rock and even Georgetown
in Williamson County, had become popular alternatives to living in Austin. Like the rest of
Texas, Travis County weathered a serious economic downturn in the mid-1980s; newly-built
office space sat empty, and many people lost their jobs. Added to this was news that Bergstrom
Air Force Base was scheduled to close. In the early 1990s, however, plans were underway to
convert the Bergstrom site into a new municipal airport, and the county was looking forward to a
period of growth. The population of Travis County was reported at 576,407 in 1990, an increase
of 37% from 1980. Among the area’s most prevalent concerns was that future growth should
not destroy the ecological balance of environmentally sensitive areas in the western hills.

4.0 ARCHIVAL RESEARCH

Archival research conducted via the Internet at the THC’s Texas Archeological Sites
Atlas (Atlas) website indicated the presence of 6 previously recorded archeological sites and
cemeteries within a 1.0-mile (1.6-km) radius of the Project Area (THC 2014), while a review of
the National Park Service’s (NPS) NRHP Google Earth map layer indicated the presence of no
historic properties listed on the NRHP within the review radius (NPS 2014) (Table 4-1). No
previously recorded archeological sites, including any listed on the NRHP are located within or
immediately adjacent to the Project Area. According to the Atlas, the Project Area has not been
previously assessed for cultural resources.
Prehistoric archeological sites are commonly found in upland areas and on alluvial
terraces near stream/river channels or drainages. Based on the location of the Project Area on
an upland formation in proximity to Decker Creek as well as the numerous previously
documented prehistoric sites in close proximity to the Project Area, it was Horizon’s original
opinion that there existed a moderate to high potential for undocumented prehistoric cultural
deposits within the Project Area. However, given the disturbances and modifications of the
Project Area during the original construction of the power plant, the potential for undocumented
prehistoric cultural resources generally seems low.
In regard to historic-era resources, the existing Decker Creek Power Plant facility is
visible within the boundaries of the Project Area, as seen on the 2014 Google Earth imagery.
However, no structures appear within the Project Area on the relevant, historical 1963 USGS
7.5-minute Manor, Texas, topographic quadrangle. By 1970, the location of the Project Area
was modified during the initial construction of the Decker Creek Power Plant facility. The lack of
any visible historic-era structures within the Project Area on the 1963 topographic quadrangle,
coupled with construction of the power plant in 1970, suggests a low potential for historic-era
architectural or archeological resources within the Project Area.

5.0 SURVEY METHODOLOGY

A 2-person Horizon archeological field crew completed the intensive pedestrian survey
of the Project Area on 17 June 2014. This entailed intensive surface inspection and subsurface
shovel testing efforts within the Project Area. The TSMASS require a minimum of 3 shovel tests
per acre for projects 0.0 to 2.0 acres in size. The Project Area measures approximately 1.0
acres in size. As such, a total of 3 shovel tests were necessary within the Project Area in order
to comply with the TSMASS. Horizon exceeded the minimum survey standards by excavating 6
shovel tests within the Project Area. All excavated matrices were screened through 0.25-inch
(6.0-millimeter [mm]) hardware mesh or were trowel-sorted if the dense clay soils prohibited
successful screening.
In general, shovel tests measured approximately 12.0 inches (30.0 cm) in diameter and
were excavated to a target depth of 3.3 feet (1.0 m) below ground surface, to the top of preHolocene deposits, or to the maximum depth practicable. In practice, shovel tests were
terminated at depths of 3.9 to 9.8 inches (10.0 to 25.0 cm) below surface due to the presence of
pre-Holocene sediments generally composed of gravelly and silty clay and limestone gravels
derived from decomposing limestone. Most surficial sediments exhibited mottling or other signs
of prior disturbance. The locations of all shovel tests were recorded via handheld global
positioning system (GPS) units utilizing the Universal Transverse Mercator (UTM) coordinate
system and the North American Datum of 1983 (NAD 83). Shovel test locations are presented
in Figure 5-1, and shovel test data are presented in Appendix A.
The TSMASS also require backhoe trenching in stream terraces and other areas with
the potential to contain buried archeological materials at depths below those that shovel tests
are capable of reaching (approximately 3.3 feet [1.0 m] below surface). The Project Area is
located on Cretaceous-age uplands adjacent to Decker Creek. Shovel testing revealed shallow
gravelly clay sediments overlying limestone gravels, indicating that shovel testing was capable
of penetrating to the bottom of sediments containing archeological deposits. As such, shovel
testing is considered to constitute an adequate and effective survey technique for identifying
archeological resources within the Project Area, and mechanical trenching was consequently
not employed as a site-prospecting technique.

6.0 RESULTS OF INVESTIGATIONS

6.1

RESULTS

The survey of the Project Area resulted in entirely negative findings. No cultural
materials were observed on the surface of the Project Area or within any of the 6 excavated
shovel tests. In general, the Project Area contained gravelly clay and limestone gravels. Most
surficial sediments exhibited mottling or other signs of prior disturbance. These disturbed soils
would have likely confined any cultural materials to shallow deposits and would not have
facilitated deeply buried deposits.

6.2

RECOMMENDATIONS

Based on the negative survey results, it is Horizon’s opinion that the proposed Decker
Creek Power Plant Expansion Project will have no adverse effect on significant cultural
resources designated as or considered eligible for formal designation as SALs. Horizon
therefore recommends that City of Austin be allowed to proceed with the construction of the
proposed power plant expansion relative to the jurisdiction of the ACT. However, in the unlikely
event that any cultural materials (including human remains or burial features) are inadvertently
discovered at any point during construction, use, or ongoing maintenance of the Project Area,
even in previously surveyed areas, all work at the location of the discovery should cease
immediately, and the THC should be notified of the discovery.
