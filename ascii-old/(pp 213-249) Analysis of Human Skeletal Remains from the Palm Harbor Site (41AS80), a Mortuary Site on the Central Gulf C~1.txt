Analysis of Human Skeletal Remains from the Palm
Harbor site (41AS80), a Mortuary Site on the Central
Gulf Coast of Texas

A. G. Comuz~e, Marianne Marek, and D. Gentry Steele

ABSTRACT
In October 1980, during a construction project, human remains were
recovered near Rockport, Texas, from what has been determined to be a prehistoric mortuary site. Because the remains were comingled during the uncontrolled removal, they were treated like ossuary samples. There were at
least seven individuals (four males, two females, and a single juvenile of indeterminate sex), ranging in age from about five to over 40. The pathologies
in the sample are few and are mainly associated with age-related degenerative conditions. The three cases of traumatic injury show evidence of antemortem recovery. These individuals came from a relatively tall, markedly
robust population that had a large degree of sexual dimorphism.

INTRODUCTION
In October 1980 the remains of 12 humans were recovered from a site in the
central part of the Gulf Coast of Texas, at N27°58’25", W97°05’45", just south of
Rockport. The site, now known as the Palm Harbor site (41AS80), had been inadvertently exposed during construction of a building on private property.
When the human skeletal material was exposed, the construction crew notified the Aransas County sheriff’s office. Believing the remains might be those of
recently deceased individuals, the sheriff’s staff undertook noncontrolled excavations in an effort to determine their origin and extent. After concluding that the
remains were prehistoric, the State Archeologist’s staff asked Ed Mokry, of Corpus Christi, to inspect the site and file a report. Mokry in turn requested that the
skeletal remains be analyzed by the writers at the Physical Anthropology Laboratories at Texas A&M University.
As a result of the uncontrolled excavation of the site, much of the site was
disturbed, and much of the skeletal material recovered had been scattered and
severely damaged. To complicate the matter, the remains that were removed for
analysis were inadvertently mixed at the site (E. Mokry, n.d.). Because of the

extremely fragmented and comingled condition of the material, it was impossible to reconstruct any of the skeletons. Therefore, the bones were analyzed by
skeletal elements. This paper reports on the anatomy of the skeletal material, the
pathologies suffered by the individuals, and attempts to reconstruct the basic
demographic features of the sample.

ANATOMICAL DESCRIPTIONS

Because the remains were comingled, they were separated into skeletal elements and analyzed as if they were an ossuary sample: they were separated into
skeletal elements and analyzed as subsamples. The demographic and pathological data for each subsample are presented separately.
Crania
At least seven individuals are represented by crania: three males (one partial
cranium may represent a fourth male), two females, and one juvenile of undetermined sex. The ages, based on eruption of teeth, extent of dental attrition, and
the state of suture fusion, range from about five to over forty years. The only
evidences of pathology in the cranial remains point to periosteal infections
of possibly treponemal origin in two individuals; there is no evidence of traumatic injury.
During the analysis of these cranial remains, basic measurements were recorded (Table l). These measurements give good indications of both the overal!
robusticity and the extent of sexual dimorphism of the sample. Comparison of
crania B and G provides the strongest indication of the sexual dimorphism in the
population, since they appear to be of the same age. This robusticity and sexual
dimorphism is most readily apparent in the measurements of the palate and mandible. The mandibles of the males B and E have significantly larger bigonial and
bicondylar widths, together with longer ascending ramus heights than do the females C and G. Finally, the males A and B have significantly greater cranial circumference than does the female G.
Although individual C was designated a female on the basis of visual analysis, in some cases its measurements overlap those of the males. This may indicate
either that the individual was a male or that the individual was simply a larger
than average female. Although the measurements of C are large, the writers believe that C is most likely a female, since there is an apparent absence of welldefined sites of muscle attachment.
Cranium A
The first individual examined is represented by a nearly complete and articulated braincase, missing only the squamous part of the left temporal. Except for
the nasals, the face is completely missing. Since the breaks in the bone appear to
be fresh, both the loss of the squamous and a fracture of the right parietal are
believed to have occurred during removal.

This specimen has been identified as male because of the noticeably heavy
browridges and a well-developed occipital protuberance accompanied by a welldefined crest running perpendicular to the nuchal lines of the occipital. In addition, the bone is relatively thick.
Since there are no teeth associated with this cranium, dental attrition cannot
be used as an indicator of age, but the specimen does have areas of suture fusion
and obliteration along the coronal and sagittal sutures, tentatively identifying the
individual as an older adult (Bass 1971).

Cranium B
This specimen consists of three-fourths of a reconstructed braincase (Figures 19, 21), together with face (Figure 1) and mandible (Figure 23); the basal
part of the braincase is totally absent. These remains are extremely fragmentary,
and the freshness of the breaks indicates that they were broken during excavation. The facial remains consist of both maxillae, the right malar, and the right
lacrimal (Figure 1). The maxillary dentition is complete except for the first and
second right molars. The mandible is complete except for the medial part of both
right and left condyles and the left lateral incisor and canine.
These are apparently the remains of an extremely large, robust male. In addition to a well-defined browridge and what is best described as an occipital protuberance, there is a well-developed crest that runs transverse to the nuchal lines
of the occipital, indicating an area of large muscle attachment. The mastoid processes are large, a trait generally found in males, and the mental spine of the
mandible also has indications of a strong muscle attachment. The mental eminence of the mandible is extremely square and the teeth are relatively large.
The third molars are erupted and show signs of light wear, basically a polishing of the occlusal surfaces. There is no apparent fusion of the cranial sutures.
In combination, these characteristics point to a young adult, possibly in the late
teens or early twenties.
The cranium shows no signs of pathology or trauma, but it does have an
extremely large Inca bone in the lambdoidal suture. This supernumerary b~ne is
bounded by the temporal mastoids, the lambdoidal suture, and a supernumerary
suture bisecting the squamous part of the occipital. It has a maximum height of
53 mm and a maximum breadth of 93 ram. It is interesting to note that in a much
earlier study, Woodbury and Woodbury (1935) reported that this condition was
totally absent in all of the coastal Indian samples they observed.
The dentition of Cranium B shows no evidence of caries or other dental pathology. All of the missing teeth--the right mandibular lateral incisor and canine
and the left maxillary first and second molars--appear to be postmortem losses.
The maxillary left lateral incisor is morphologically atypical with respect to the
other upper incisors. The other incisors have the shovel shape characteristic of
Amerindian populations, but this one has a rounded form that is intermediate
between the shovel shape and the atypical peg shape commonly seen in most
supernumerary incisors. The upper central incisors evidence what Dahlberg
(1963) described as lateral winging (Figure 2).
The wear patterns on these teeth can be characterized as light on the second
and third molars and heavy on the incisors (Figure 2), a pattern that has been
reported for Texas coastal Indian populations (Maples 1962). This individual has
a very marked edge-to-edge bite (Figure 1).

Cranium C
This specimen consists of a nearly complete braincase, a left malar, the
petrosal and mastoid processes of the left temporal, and a partial mandible (Figure 3), including a right ascending ramus.

Figure 3. Mandible of cranium C showing severe evidence of periodontal infection together with antemortem loss of teeth accompanied by resorption of the bone.

These remains are much more gracile than those of the males A and B, and
are therefore considered female. The browridges are not as well developed, and
the occipital region shows no sign of enlargement or marked muscle attachment.
The mandible is more rounded, and the teeth that are present are generally
smaller than those of the males.
The lower left third molar is present and shows signs of extreme wear, as do
most of the other teeth, but the cranial sutures show no signs of fusion or obliteration. Based on these findings, in the context of this population, cranium C is
considered an adult of middle to old age.
The braincase and facial bones show no evidence of pathology or trauma,
but both the mandible and dentition show signs of a rather severe periodontal
infection (Ortner and Putschar 1981) (Figure 3). The body of the mandible shows
evidence of an alveolar infection with subsequent loss of the teeth and resorption
of the sockets. This individual appears to have lost the right mandibular second
premolar, the right first and second molar, the left first and second molar, and
possibly the left third molar (the loss of the left third molar cannot be positively
documented due to the absence of this part of the mandible). The part of the
mahdible where these teeth were lost shows evidence of both alveolar resorption
and remodeling. This degree of tooth loss and mandibular resorption has been
repOrted in great numbers of individuals from Texas Indian populations (Maples
1962). In addition to the teeth already noted, both of the left mandibular incisors
are missing, probably a postmortem loss. The remaining teeth in this specimen
have the same marked wear pattern as has been noted in other coastal aboriginal

populations: a complete loss of enamel on the occlusal surface, exposing the dentine. Wear has completely removed the enamel fi’om the left mandibular third
molar, producing extreme saddling of the occlusal surface. This could be the result of a malocclusion caused by the remodeling of the mandible. It should be
noted, however, that even with the evidence of the severe abscessing of the mandible, which either contributed to or resulted from the loss of the teeth, the remaining teeth show no evidence of dental caries.
The dentition of cranium C is also marked by culturally induced dental mutilation. The type seen here is known as interproximal grooving and is found on
the mesial face of the right mandibular second premolar (Figure 4, 5). This was
accomplished by rubbing a small stick in the interstitial gap between the teeth
and has been seen most commonly between the second premolar and first molar,
the first and second molars, and second and third molars (Ubelaker et al. 1969).
The practice may have occurred in order to counteract dental discomfort by producing a counter pain, thereby inadvertently producing the dental mutilation.
Cranium D
The fourth cranium is represented by a face alone and consists of both right
and left maxillae and malars. Except for the right posterior part of the hard
palate, the bones are relatively complete, but the specimen has suffered postmortem loss of all the maxillary incisors and the right and left maxillary second
and third molars.

220

Considering the size of the teeth and the width of the face, these remains are
probably those of a male. The severe dental attrition indicates that, relative to the
rest of the sample, the individual was in late middle or old age.
This specimen shows signs of what could be treponemal scarring, manifested
by subperiosteal bone deposition surrounding the anterior nasal spine (Figure 6),
an area commonly affected by treponemal infections (Steinbock 1976).
The dentition also has some interesting wear patterns and indications of disease. The anterior alveolar margin above the left and right first premolars shows
signs of what appears to be deposition of new bone of a type indicative of periodontal infections (Ortner and Putschar 1981). The wear on these teeth can be best
described as extreme (Figure 7). The enamel has been totally removed from all of
the teeth; not only from the occlusa! surfaces, but down to the cervical margins
as well.
The left maxillary first molar has an unusual mol~hological structure in
which the buccal roots extend out beyond the alveolar border, and the occlusal
surface is horseshoe shaped (Figure 7). This same form has been noted in molars
of several specimens from the Callo del Oso site, which is geographically and
perhaps temporally close to the Palm Harbor site.

Cranium E
The fifth cranium is represented by only a few calvarial fragments and a
mandible, all of which are considered to be from the same individual, since they
share the same extent of discoloration and do not articulate with any of the
others. The calvarial fragments consist of a medial part of the frontal, a major
part of the squamous of the left temporal, fragments of the left parietal, two fragments of the right parietal, and one fragment that may be from either the frontal
or a parietal. Missing from the mandible are the right ascending ramus, all of the
incisors, the two canines, and the first right premolar, all of which appear to be
postmortem !osses.
Cranium E is considered that of a male on the basis of the robusticity of the
cranial fragments and mandible and the particularly marked male features, including the heavy browridges on the frontal fragment and the square mandible
with its large, well-defined mental eminence.
The high level of wear on the dentition of these remains indicates that in
relation to the remainder of this population, the individual is an old adult.
The cranial fragments show no evidence of pathology or trauma; all of the
breakage is believed to have occurred during recovery.
Cranium F

The sixth cranium is believed to represent the youngest individual in the
sample; it also has the fewest remains. Only four extremely thin fragments of the
parietal were recovered. The thinness of this tabular bone suggests that these remains are of a juvenile, but because the remains are so few, no assumptions concerning sex, pathologies, or traumas can be made.

Cranium G
This cranium is in relatively complete condition. The bones of the braincase
are virtually intact (Figures 20, 22), with only the left temporal and the basal part
of the skull missing. The face consists of both maxillae, the left lacrimal, and the
right malar. The maxillary dentition is complete except for the postmortem loss
of both medial incisors. The mandible is nearly complete, missing only the right
coronoid process.
These remains are much more gracile than those of the males so far described, so cranium G is believed to represent a female. It has neither a prominent browridge nor extreme development of the occipital protuberance and nuchal.
crest. The teeth are generally smaller than those of the males, and the mandible is
markedly rounded; the mandibles of what are considered males in the sample are
more square.
The third molars show only light wear, suggesting that in this population
this individual was a young adult.
Although there is no evidence of traumatic injury or infectious disease, this
individual does have some interesting dental anomalies and pathologies. The
most unusual feature is a fossa associated with each of the right and left first
upper premolars on the buccal surface of the maxilla. These fossae, in which the
roots of both upper first premolars are exposed, appear to be the result of incomplete formation of the bone during development and not the result of traumatic or
pathological activity. The best evidence to support this argument is the symmetrical nature of the fossae and the fact that the bone inside of them does not differ
from the rest of the cortical bone. However, there is evidence of a carious lesion
with associated abscessing of the upper left canine. This cavity on the occlusa!
surface of the tooth apparently penetrated the pulp cavity and continued into the
root, producing an apical abscess. This could have led to the accumulation of pus
in the gingival sulcus, which would have sought the path of least resistance for
drainage (Gorlin and Goldman 1970). There is an opening, with some associated
bone destruction (Figure 8), from the sulcus of the canine into the fossa of the
first upper premolar. This suggests that the infection had utilized the fossa as part
of its passageway for drainage. The specimen also displays asymmetrical wear of
the occlusal surface of the teeth; the left half of the dentition is much more worn
than the right (Figure 9).

Vertebral Column
The vertebral sample from the Palm Harbor site is fragmentary and poorly
preserved. No juvenile vertebrae were recovered; most elements could be classified only as cervical, thoracic, or lumbar.
Virtually every vertebra in the sample shows some type of pathology, with
arthritic lipping and fusion of elements the most common. Only those with the
most severe pathological conditions are discussed here.

Cervical Vertebrae
The sample of cervical vertebrae, all classified as adult, is relatively well
preserved and consists of four atlas, three axis, one third cervical, eight cervicals
numbers 3-6, and one seventh cervical vertebra.
The most severe pathology of the cervical vertebrae is fusion of an axis to a
third cervical (Figure 10). The fusion occurs predominantly in the region of the
neural arches. The articular processes are completely fused, and the beginnings
of fusion are apparent in the posterior region of the centrum. The inferior aspect
of the anterior part of the centrum of the third cervical also shows some evidence
of fusion to a fourth cervical, but this fourth cervical was not recovered.
All of the remaining nine cervicals show some degree of arthritic lipping,
characterized by the buildup of bone on the inferior and superior margins of the
centrum (Steinbock 1976). Of these nine elements, two have flaring of the anterior inferior edge of the centrum; two other specimens exhibit evidence of fusion
to their articulating partners, and two have deposition of numerous bony spicules
on the central surface of the centrum.
Thoracic Vertebrae
The 29 thoracic vertebrae were separated into upper, middle, and lower
thoracics, based on the relative size of the centrum in combination with the angle
of the spinous process. The five uppermost thoracics had the smallest centra and
more horizontally extended spinous processes; the six lowest thoracics generally
had larger centra and horizontally extending, slightly squarish spinous processes

Comuzzie, Marek, and Steele--Skeletal Remains

225

(Steele and Bramblett n.d.). The middle thoracics have medium-sized centra
in combination with sharper, more downward angles of the spinous processes
(Steele and Bramblett n.d.).
All of the thoracic vertebrae in the sample have some degree of osteoarthritic lipping similar to that found in the cervicals and characterized by recognizable rings of bone deposition along the superior and inferior edges of the centra. Bony spicules similar to those described on the cervicals occur on only one
of the thoracic vertebrae.
Lumbar Vertebrae
The fragmentary condition of the lumbar vertebrae has allowed the identification of only five isolated elements. All are classified as adult and show some
degree of arthritic lipping.
The most severe case of vertebral osteoarthritis is displayed on a fifth lumbar; the lipping is most visible on the anterior inferior border of the centrum (Figure 11). The other lumbar vertebrae also display some degree of lipping on the
superior and inferior margins of the centra, as noted in the other vertebrae in the
sample.
Clavicles

The Palm Harbor clavicle sample consists of seven isolated specimens, six
of which are classified as adult and one as juvenile (Table 2). The age determinations of the adult specimens were based on their relatively large size in combination with their degrees of epiphyseal fusion. The age of the juvenile specimen
was determined to be under 18, due to absence of the medial epiphysis (Bass
1971). Its size suggests the individual was between five and 10 years old.
Virtually every clavicle in the sample has some form of pathology and/or
anomalous sternal facet. The sternal end of one clavicle (A) is extremely flat and
worn, with a pitted surface indicative of osteoarthritis (Steinbock 1976). A second
(E) has an abnormally deep, sharply depressed area on the surface of the sternal
facet, with visible wear on the margins and possible deformation of the epiphysis. Evidence of periosteal infection is seen on the inferior aspect of the distal
end near the conoid tubercle of a third clavicle (B). The sternal facets on three
other adult clavicles (B, C, and D) differ markedly in shape, a difference noted
by others in this facet of the clavicle (McKern and Stewart 1957) (Figure 12).
Scapulae
The sample of scapulae from Palm Harbor is composed of seven isolated
specimens that consist mainly of the heavier bone of the spine, glenoid cavity,
axillary border, and the acromion and coracoid processes. The thinner bone of
the scapula bodies is consistently absent.
On the basis of size, six of these specimens are classified as adult; four of
the six have lipping of the glenoid cavity that is considered common after the age
of 30 to 35 (Steele and Bramblett n.d.). The remaining scapula has been classified as juvenile due to the billowing of the epiphyseal surfaces of the coracoid

and glenoid cavity, which indicates that the individual was under 15 (Bass 1971);
the size of the bone indicates that the individual was over five.
Only one adult specimen in this sample shows evidence of a pathological
condition: a small amount of bone deposition on the surface of the glenoid cavity,
which may be the result of the early stages of osteoarthritis.

Sterna
The sternum sample consists of two manubria and one sternal body. Both
manubria show evidence of the beginning of fusion, but neither can be articulated with the sternal body. The body consists of three segments, and the inferior
surface of the third segment is billowed. All of the sternal remains are classified
as adult, and no pathological conditions are evident.

Ribs
The fragmentary condition of the ribs has made it difficult to determine the
number in the sample; only two could be reconstructed completely. Two rib fragments appear to be juvenile; the remainder appear to be adult. There is no evidence of pathology on any of the ribs.

Humeri
The Palm Harbor humerus sample (Table 3) consists of nine isolated specimens. On the basis of epiphyseal fusion, seven of these specimens, three right
and four left, are classified as adults more than 20 years old (Bass 1971; Steele
and Bramblett n.d.). The two remaining humeri belong possibly to one juvenile
between five and 12 years old (Table 11).
Abnormal bone development that may be osteoarthritis occurs in four of the
adult specimens at the junction between the capitulum and trochlea, and may
correspond to a similar bone formation found in the trochlear notches of several
specimens of the ulna sample (Figure 13). Further evidence of osteoarthritis is
seen in the prominent lipping of the distal edge of the olecranon fossa.
The most severe abnormality of the humeri occurs in an adult specimen
where a possible dislocation of the ulna is indicated by a relatively large wear
facet on the lateral wall of the olecranon fossa (Figure 14). This fossa is very
deep, and there is also a small area of bone formation on the medial wall. No
corresponding wear pattern can be found on any of the ulnae in the sample. It
should also be noted that this bone has the greatest bicondylar width of the
humerus sample (Humerus F, Table 3)(Figure 13).
The only other abnormality of the humerus sample is the extreme gracility
of one adult specimen (Humerus C, Table 3). Even without the distal end and
olecranon fossa, it is one of the longest bones in the sample and has the largest
head of all the humeri. Yet the deltoid tuberosity is almost absent, and the proximal end is unusually smooth, to the extent that the division between the greater
tuberosity and the head is barely visible.

Radii
On the basis of the amount of epiphyseal fusion, seven of the eight radii in
the Palm Harbor sample (four right and three left) are classified as adults more
than 20 years old (Table 4). The remaining radius is classified as a juvenile between five and 18 years old (Bass 1971; Steele and Bramblett n.d.).
Periosteal infection is evident on the distal ends of two of the adult specimens; osteoarthritis is evident on two others. In one, osteoarthritis is manifested
by lipping along the edges of the lunate surface, and there is a small area of bone
deposition along the anteriomedial aspect of the border between the lunate and
scaphoid surfaces. In the other, the medial side of the head has an overhanging lip
(Ortner and Putschar 1981).
An important abnormality of the radius sample is seen in four of the adults
as a deep depressed area located laterally on the midshaft in the area of insertion
of the Pronator teres muscle (Gray 1936)(Figure 15).
Ulnae
On the basis of epiphyseal fusion six (three right and three left) of the eight
Palm Harbor ulnae are classified as adults more than 20 years old (Bass 1971,
Steele and Bramblett n.d.) (Table 5). The two remaining ulnae are from a young
adult about 17 to 20 years old (Ulna A) and a juvenile between five and 16 years
old (Bass 1971; Steele and Bramblett n.d.).
Robusticity is reflected in four of the adult ulnae by the prominent depression under the coronoid process of the trochlear notch, in the area of insertion for
the thick tendon of the Brachialis anticus muscle (Gray 1936).
In two adult specimens, a pathological condition is suggested by a sharp,
medial-lateral ridge of developed bone on the nonarticular strip of the trochlear
notch (Figure 13). As mentioned above, this bony ridge may correspond to a
similar development of bone on the distal articular surfaces of several specimens
of humeri. Together, these bone formations appear to indicate degenerative arthritis. Another abnormal ulna (Ulna D), which has an unusually straight, smooth
shaft, is from an adult.

Evidence of a traumatic injury, in the form of a midshaft fracture, is shown
on one adult specimen, Ulna E (Figure 16). The injury is manifested by a large
callus whose surface appears to be composed of relatively smooth laminar bone,
indicating complete mending of the break before death (Steinbock 1976).

Pelves
The shattered and warped condition of the pelvic remains permitted only
limited reconstruction. Seven ilia fragments (four right and three left) with identifiable sciatic notches were recovered. Determinations of sex were based on the
angles of these notches together with the presence or absence of preauricular
sulci. Specimens with sciatic notches of less than 50 degrees and lacking preauricular sulci were considered male. Specimens with angles greater than 50 degrees or with preauricular sulci were considered female (Table 6). As with the
rest of the skeletal remains, there is marked sexual dimorphism in the pelvic
sample. The bones of the males appear to be heavy and generally robust; those of
the females are much more gracile and usually thinner.
Six of the seven ilia in this sample are identified as adult. The remaining
one, based on the absence of fusion of the ischium with the pubis, is considered a
juvenile between five and 12 years old (Bass 1971; Steele and Bramblett n.d.).
No traumatic or pathological evidence is associated with any of the specimens in the pelvic sample.
Femora
Ten adult femora (five right and five left) from this population were recovered from this sample (Table 7).
Periosteal infection is evident in the slight scarring of the anterior part of the
lower shaft of only one specimen. Another (Femur G) has extreme anteriorposterior flattening that is often associated with healed fractures, but since the

surface of the bone does not show any evidence of bone deposition that normally
would be associated with a healed fracture, this flattening is thought to be not
from a traumatic injury, but a structural variation.
Tibiae
All of the nine tibia specimens (five right and four left) represent adult individuals (Table 8).
The only abnormality in the tibia sample occurs in periosteal infections of
five specimens. In the two most advanced cases (Tibiae A and B) severe periosteal

infection and deformation in the form of large areas of rough, subperiosteal bone
cover the entire bone surfaces (Steinbock 1976)(Figures 17, 18). Surface pitting
and several prominent transverse lines, all probably attributable to the infection,
are visible on the shafts. This pathological condition, commonly seen in tibiae,
may be associated with treponemal infections (Steinbock 1976; Ortner and
Putschar 1981).
Fibulae
The fibula sample consists of only the shafts (two right and three left) of five
adult specimens. No measurements were taken.
The entire surface of the shaft of one fibula is covered with a slight periosteal infection. Another has sustained a longitudinal fracture of the distal shaft.

Carpals and Tarsals
In all, 18 carpals and 10 tarsals (Table 11) were recovered from the Palm
Harbor site; only two are classified as juvenile. One of the juvenile bones, a right
calcaneus (D) with evidence of possible periosteal infection, has been identified
as an individual less than 14 years old (Krogman 1962).
It was possible to estimate the sex of the adult tarsals by utilizing the formula developed by Steele (1976). Based on calculations from measurements of
the calcanea (Table 9), at least one male and one female are represented in the
sample. The one complete talus recovered is apparently from an adult male
(Table 10).

DISCUSSION
At least seven individuals are represented in the Palm Harbor sample (Table
11): four probable males, two females, and one juvenile of indeterminable sex.
The individuals ranged in age from a juvenile between five and 10 years old to
relatively old adults over 40. It is impossible to determine if the sex ratio and age
distribution found in this sample are results of its limited size or of population
structure or burial practices.
Estimates of stature for the Palm Harbor sample are based on the femora,
tibiae, humeri, radii, and ulnae (Table 12). The fragmented condition of the remains made it necessary in most cases to calculate the length of each long bone
from its fragments (Steele 1970) and then to estimate stature, following both
Trotter and Gleser (1952) and Genoves (1967).

Estimates of stature range between 189.1 cm (6 ft. 2.5 in.) and 144.9 cm (4
ft. 9 in.). The mean for all stature estimates is 168 cm. These estimates compare
favorably with those from the Shellpoint sample (Wilkinson 1973), the Oso series (Woodbury and Woodbury 1935), the Doering and Kob sites (Neuman
1952), and the sample from the Harris County Boys School (Wilkinson 1977).
The inhabitants of these sites (Wilkinson !977) and the Palm Harbor site are estimated to have been taller than other Amerindian populations (Wilkinson 1977).
This population is also characterized by its high degree of robusticity, especially noticeable in comparisons with Indians of the Southwest. This robusticity,
also noted in other Indian samples from the Gulf Coast of Texas (Wilkinson
1977), is best expressed in the marked development of the sites for muscle attachment, the marked development of nuchal cresting, the well-defined cranial
and facial features such as browridges and occipital protuberances (Figures 19,
20), and also in the massiveness of the postcranial remains.
In conjunction with well-defined robusticity, this sample is also characterized by marked sexual dimorphism, most apparent at the sites of muscle attachment and particularly noticeable on the crania. There is also marked dimorphism
in the shapes of the male and female crania: those of the males are relatively
oblong in superior view, whereas those of the females are much more rounded
(Figures 21, 22). Wilkinson (1977) has also pointed out what appears to be dimorphism in the shape of the mandibles in remains from the Shellpoint and other
coastal Indian sites in Texas: the male mandibles are markedly square along the
mental eminence, and the females are more rounded (Figures, 23, 24).
In the postcranial remains this sexual dimorphism is expressed in both the
marked rugosity of the sites of muscle attachment and the diameters of the shafts
of the long bones. However, since their condition precluded accurate sexing, a
coefficient of sexual dimorphism cannot be calculated for the long bones. The
shaft lengths and diameters of the long bones do vary widely, and this variation is
thought to be a result of sexual dimorphism. The degree of sexual dimorphism in
this sample is generally greater than is found in other coastal Indian populations.
According to Wilkinson (1977), the unusual robusticity and sexual dimorphism among certain prehistoric mortuary samples from the central coast of
Texas are indications of a common cultural affinity, and represent populations of
precontact or early postcontact Karankawan culture. All of these populations
share not only morphological similarities, but also to some extent common mortuary practices (E. Mokry n.d.). It is interesting to note that both the Palm Harbor and Shellpoint samples match the Otamid skull type of Neuman (1952),
which is based on remains from the Callo del Oso site (Jackson 1933). This is
significant, since the Callo del Oso site has been considered a type locality for
Karankawan material culture. But whatever their cultural affinities may be, the
Palm Harbor, Shellpoint, and Callo del Oso remains share a common morphology that distinguishes them from other Texas Indian populations.
Important to understanding the environment and life-style of this population
are the identification and interpretation of their pathological conditions.

The most severe pathological condition in the sample is periosteal infection,
which is manifested by surface pitting and scarring of the affected cranial and
postcranial elements. These conditions are typically associated with treponemal
infections and can result from any of three diseases--syphilis, endemic syphilis,
and yaws. The cause of this periostitis in prehistoric populations is not well
understood (Hackett 1976).
Another frequently encountered pathological condition is arthritic lipping
on the vertebrae and the articular surfaces of the arm and leg joints. The vertebrae are the most severely affected; nearly every vertebra in the sample has some
degree of arthritic damage. There is also evidence of fusion of several vertebrae,
particularly of the atlas-axis complex and other cervical elements. All of the arthritic damage in this sample has been identified as resulting from degenerative
arthritis, which is caused by both age and wear on the articular surfaces. This is
the most common disease of the bony parts of the joints, and it has been suggested that its effects do not often appear until about the fourth decade of life
(Heine 1926). The first evidence of this disorder usually occurs as marginal lipping at the edges of the articular cartilage, apparently caused primarily by stress
on the joints over time. Studies have indicated that the rates of degenerative arthritis are highest among populations with vigorous life-styles and that males are
more often affected than females (Ortner and Putschar 1981).
Although all the dental material from this sample is characterized by heavy
attrition, there is only one case each of dental caries and periodontal disease.
Absence of dental caries is to be expected in populations with high grit content
in their diets, for grit is a natural cleaning agent, and its attrition obliterates
the natura! crevices on the teeth where decay usually begins (St. Hoyme and
Koritzer 1976).
The only severe case of periodontal infection is in Cranium C (Figure 3).
This disease is usually caused by a buildup of plaque and calculus, which produces mechanical irritation of the gums that leads to infection. Although there
are several causes for the evulsion of teeth, tooth loss resulting from decay or
trauma can be distinguished from loss resulting from periodontal infection. Infection is indicated in this specimen by calculus deposits on many of the remaining teeth, exposed root surfaces, and the presence of reactive alveolar bone.
Only three bones in the Palm Harbor sample show evidence of traumatic
injury. These injuries are a longitudinal fracture on the distal part of a fibula, a
possible dislocation of the ulna indicated by a large wear facet in the olecranon
fossa of a humerus, and a fracture of another ulna indicated by a large, prominent, midshaft callus.
The ability of a coastal environment to provide a healthy and nutritious diet
has been questioned. Rathbun, Sexton, and Michie (1980), in a study of a coastal
population of South Carolina, found that the people had suffered from sufficient
severe seasonal malnutrition and parasitic infections to cause arrest of growth
and development. In addition they found high rates of traumatic injury and degenerative bone disease (degenerative arthritis), both of which they believe were

246

due to the severe demands placed by the environmental surroundings on the lifestyles of the population.
The pathological evidence from the Palm Harbor site, however, contradicts
the conclusions of Rathbun, Sexton, and Michie (1980). Considering their stature and robusticity, there is no indication that the Palm Harbor population suffered nutritional deficiencies or related disorders, and the low rate of traumatic
injury and cortical thickness of the long bones indicate healthy, strong bones and
absence of extreme physical stress. The apparent lack of physical stress also suggests that the degenerative arthritis in some of the joints is predominantly a result
of old age. Since degenerative arthritis usually does not appear until the fourth
decade of life, the degree of lipping seen in some of the vertebrae indicate that
life expectancy in this group was substantial.
It is therefore our belief that the pathological conditions associated with this
sample are the result of normal aging and typical of climatic stress, and are not
the result of living in an area of marginal nutritional resources.
