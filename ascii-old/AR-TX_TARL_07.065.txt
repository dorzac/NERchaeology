ABSTRACT
Sponsored by the Lower Colorado River Authority, staff
members of the Texas Archeological Survey, The University of
Texas at Austin, conducted a pedestrian survey for cultural
resources along a 64-mile transmission line corridor from
Comfort to Zorn, Texas.
This transmission line corridor
crosses portions of Kendall, Comal, Hays and Guadalupe
counties. A total of 21 prehistoric and 2 historic sites
were located and recorded under the authority of Antiquities
Permit No. 252 following guidelines set forth by the Texas
Historical
Commission.
The transmission line corridor
traverses the fluvial deposits of the Guadalupe River at the
western end of the line, then the uplands of the Edwards
Plateau, until once again it crosses the Guadalupe and
emerges on the Blackland Prairie. Site distribution along
this line reflects the exploitation of the chert outcropping
of the Edwards limestone in the east and the permanent water
resources of the Guadalupe River and its tributaries to the
west.

INTRODUCTION
The Lower Colorado River Authority contracted with the
Texas Archeological Survey, The University of Texas at
Austin, for the archeological
survey of a 64-mile
transmission line corridor between Comfort, Kendall County,
1).
The
Texas and Zorn, Guadalupe County, Texas (Fig.
corridor included a segment of an existing transmission line
corridor which was to be widened to incorporate the new
transmission line. A I-mile branch to the Henne Substation
was also surveyed under this contract.
Field work was initiated on September 12, 1982, when
Leland Bement and Jeff Turpin of the Texas Archeological

field session terminated on September 16. On October 25,
1982, staff members Bruce Nightengale and Jeff Turpin
surveyed an additional 2 miles. Staff archeologists Leland
Bement and Kevin Jolly continued the survey on January 5,
1983, surveying an additional 21 miles. This field time
lasted until January 10.
On January 14, 1983, staff
historian, Jack Jackson, returned with Leland Bement to
assess two historic sites that had been located during the

Janaury 5-10th field survey.
surveyed an additional 14.5 mile segment from March 10, 1983
through the 17th of that month.
The remainder of the
transmission corridor was surveyed on April 5, 1983, by
Leland Bement and Bruce Nightengale.
A total of 21 prehistoric sites and two historic sites
were located and recorded by field personnel. All sites
were recorded on the State of Texas Archeological Site Data
forms with additional documentation by photography and
scaled sketch maps. Permanent site numbers were assigned
using the trinomial system where the first two numerals
indicate the state, followed by two letters indicating the
county. followed by numerals indicating the number of sites
found in that county.
Thus, 41CM85 breaks down:
41 =
Texas, CM = Comal County, 85 = 85th site found in Comal
County, Texas. All sites were plotted on USGS topographical
7.5 1 maps, LCRA plan and profile aerials, and county maps.
All project documentation is curated at the
Texas
Archeological Research Laboratory, The University of Texas
at Austin.

ENVIRONMENTAL BACKGROUND
Geology
The majority of the transmission line traverses the
Edwards Plateau, delineated on the east by the Edwards
Escarpment and to the south by the Balcones Escarpment
(Fenneman 1938:102).
This is located within Fenneman's
Coastal Plain Province (ibid.). The easternmost extent of
the transmission corridor enters onto Fenneman's Blackland
Prairie.
The Edwards in this area is comprised of the Glen Rose
Formation and Edwards limestone (Geologic Atlas of Texas
1945).
The Glen Rose Formation is characterized by
limestone, dolomite and clay. Of particular interest is the
exclusion of chert in its composition.
The
Edwards
limestone is comprised of limestone, dolomite and chert.
The chert ingredient in this limestone plays a major role in
site distribution along the transmission line corridor.
This will be discussed further later in the report.
The
eastern end of the line where it enters the Blackland
Prairie is geologically on the Navarro group and Marlbrook
Marl (Geologic Atlas of Texas, Seguin sheet, 1979). This is
comprised of calcareous clay, locally silty, marl.
Some
Uvalde gravels are located in and along the stream drainages
in the eastern end of the line, east of the Guadalupe River
(Arnow 1963).
Soils
Soil patterns vary with the underlying geology and
elevationa1 setting; additional factors are slope, drainage
gradient and water.
The western part of the corridor,
overlying the Glen Rose Formation, are Brackett-Eckrant and
Doss-Brackett
soil
groups on
the
uplands
with
Oakland-Boerne-Nuvalde soil group along the major creeks and
the Guadalupe River. The Brackett-Eckrant soils are shallow
loams and clays mixed with gravel or stones on the uplands
(SCS 1981). Doss-Brackett groups are shallow loamy, clayey
soils lying nearly level on the floodplains and terraces
(SCS 1981).
Overlying
the
Edwards
limestone are
Eckrant-Comfort soils which are gently undulating clayey
soils found on the uplands. These soils are often stony.
To the east, overlying the Navarro group, is the Houston
Black-Heiden Association. These are deep, clayey soils,
often dark in color, hence the name Houston Black.
Hydrology
The majority of the transmission
line corridor
traverses the
interfluve between the Guadalupe River
drainage basin and the Cibolo Creek drainage basin.
The

Page 3
western termination of the line crosses the Guadalupe River
as does the eastern end of the line. The western crossing
of the Guadalupe drainage basin presents a major factor in
the placement of archeological sites. The hydrology factor
in site placement will be discussed later in the report. In
addition to the surface water drainageways, the study area
also has a large number of springs fed from the Edwards
fault zone aquifer and the Edwards-Trinity Plateau aquifer
(Brune 1975:12).
Flora and Fauna
The transmission line traverses the area known as
Blair's (1950) Balconian Province. The predominant upland
location of the transmission line corridor is covered by
sometimes thick clumps of ash-juniper, mixed with Texas oak,
and an occasional live oak. The lower elevations along the
major drainages are populated by live oak, elm, pecan and
bald cypress. Various wild grasses, prickly pear cactus,
and green briars can be encountered at various elevations.
Most often encountered animal species include white
tail deer, armadillo, skunk, oppossum, turkey vultures, red
tail hawks and mockingbirds.
Numerous small rodents and
bird species are also present along with various lizards and
snakes, most of which are shared with the
provinces
bordering the Balconian Province (Blair 1950:113).
ARCHEOLOGICAL BACKGROUND
The transmission line corridor lies entirely within the
archeological region known as Central Texas. This area is
defined by Prewitt (1981:71) as:
. . . eastern half of the Edwards Plateau, the
Llano uplift, most of the Lampasas Cut Plains, the
Comanche Plateau, the southern end of the Grand
Prairie, and the Blackland Prairies bordering the
Balcones Escarpment from near Waco to near Uvalde.
Man has been living in this region for the past 8,500
Chronologies based upon the
years and probably longer.
concept of index fossils - in this case projectile point
types - have been presented by numerous persons, with the
most encompassing being those of Weir (1976) and Prewitt
(1981). In general, Texas chronologies are divided into the
broad categories of Paleoindian, Archaic, Late Prehistoric
and Historic.
The Paleoindian period begins at the end of
the Pleistocene, ending approximately 8500 years B.P.
at
which time the Archaic period begins. The Archaic is the
broadest time period, lasting until approximately 700 years

Page 4
Then enters the Late Prehistoric period with a
B.P.
duration of approximately 400 years when Europeans enter the
region marking the onset of the Historic period.
Weir (1976) refines the Archaic period into five
phases.
Prewitt (1981) subdivides the Archaic into eleven
phases and the Late Prehistoric - which he terms Neo-Archaic
into two phases. The divisions are based on the changes
of projectile point styles, tool assemblages and features.
For a description of the phases and their temporal
designations see Weir 1976 and Prewitt 1981.
Some of the systematic archeological research used to
develop the Central Texas chronologies was done in the
vicinity of the transmission line corridor.
Generally,
these projects are related to the development of the
waterways upon which dams were to be constructed. Thus, the
majority of the sites recorded and assessed are along the
major drainage systems, and many are now inundated by waters
of the dams.
Included in these studies are those done on
the Guadalupe River in preparation for Canyon Dam by
Stephenson (1949) and Johnson, Suhm and Tunnell (1962), and
along the Guadalupe in Kendall County by Hester, Kelly and
Bass (1975).
Surveys along the Dry Comal watershed were

Reconnaissance along the upper Cibolo Creek was conducted by
Bass and Hester, 1975 with investigations by Kelly and
Hester, 1976.
A survey was conducted along Bleiders Creek
by Shafer (1963). In Hays County, along the upper San
Marcos River watershed, numerous locations were surveyed in
preparation for seven dam sites by Patterson (1974). For a
brief description of the archeological and historical
resources in the counties relevant to this project see
Hester (1975).
Also, the preliminary assessment for the
Zorn to Comfort transmission line summarizes the known
resources as of the time of printing (Ekland-Olson, 1980).

this study are:

As presented in Ekland-Olson (1980), most of the
prehistoric sites included in this four-county list were
located along the major drainageways. Those sites recorded
since 1980 also tend to be located along the water sources
with one notable exception. In 1982, David O. Brown of the
Texas Archeological Survey reconnoitered proposed Ranch Road
No. 12 to the San Marcos transmission line.
In this
survey, eleven sites were located on the uplands between
small drainages along Sink Creek and on the interfluve

Page 5
between Sink Creek and Purgatory Creek (Brown 1982). These
sites were located along an outcropping of chert on the
Edwards limestone.
SURVEY PROCEDURES
The entire 64 miles was pedestrian surveyed. All sites
were located and recorded in the field, including filling
out site forms, plotting the site on the maps, description
of observed artifacts and site photographs. Shovel probes
were used where subsurface assessment could be done.
No
collections were made. Landowners were often interested in
the survey and aided by providing information concerning the
sites they knew and general information of the environment
and modern land use. Field notes were taken on a daily
basis with progress reports written in letter form after the
completion of a field session.

nodules eroding from the parent Edwards limestone. The site
consists of a scatter of tested cobbles, large primary and
secondary flakes and cores/thick bifaces. The site ;s at
least 20 x 20 m but probably continues to follow the chert
outcropping to the north and south. There;s no depth to
the site as the soil is from 0 to 5 cm deep. The site is
very deflated.
41CM141 - The site is located on the east slope of the
small upland drainage - directly across from site 41CM140
and at the same elevation.
This site ;s also directly
relatable to the natural outcropping of chert nodules from
the Edwards limestone. The site is approximately 50 x 30 m
and consists of a light scatter of flakes, cores and tested
cobbles. This site is along an existing transmission line
corridor.

Page 6
41CM142 - Located on the head of a small upland
drainage, this site follows the natural chert outcrop of the
Edwards limestone. The site is heavily deflated with from a
5 cm of brown loam collecting in pockets formed in the
limestone. In an area approximately 100 x 30 m is a light
scatter of flakes, cores, thick biface fragments and uniface
fragments. This site is located in an existing transmission
line corridor.
41CM143 - The site is located on the crest and easterly
sloping hillside of an upland knoll. The expanse of eroding
chert nodules defines the limits of the site.
A minimum
area 700 x 30 m is strewn with chert nodules, tested
nodules, cores, flakes, thick bifaces and unifaces.
Soil
depth ranges from 0 to 5 cm of brown loam, resting directly
on Edwards limestone.
41CM145 - This site is located on a ridgetop along an
existing transmission line corridor. The site consists of a
thin scatter of flakes, cores, bifaces and biface fragments
among the naturally eroding chert nodules from the Edwards
limestone. The chert outcrop continues beyond the corridor
to the north and south.
The site also extends for an
unknown distance in these directions. The soil is deflated,
leaving a maximum of 5 cm of brown loam contained between
rocks and in holes in the limestone.
41CM146 - This site is located on the west side of a
small upland drainage. This bank of the drainage is steep
and heavily deflated.
A small knoll contains a light
scatter of flakes, cores, tested cobbles, unifaces and a few
burned chert fragments. Naturally eroding chert outcrops
from the limestone in this area. The site extends on the
chert outcrop 20 x 20 m. There is no depth to the soil on
the knoll.
41CM147 - This site is located on an east-facing slope
where chert nodules are eroding from the Edwards limestone
bedrock. The site consists of a light scatter of flakes,
cores and tested nodules intermixed with nontested nodules.
The area involved is 10 x 20 m. There is very little soil
depth (less than 5 cm). A thick growth of juniper surrounds
the small clearing on which the site is situated.
41CM148 - Located on a hilltop, this site's cultural
debris is intermixed with the naturally eroding chert
nodules. Flakes, cores and tested nodules comprise the
total inventory of cultural material. The site follows the

Page 7
extent of the chert outcropping which is a mlmlmum area of
30 x 40 m. Soil depth is less than 5 cm with an occasional
10 cm depth in pockets in the limestone.
41CM149 - This site is located along the chert outcrop
on a north facing hillslope. There is a large quantity of
fractured chert on the heavily deflated surface.
Flakes,
cores and thick bifaces comprise the cultural material
observed on the site. The site area is approximately 70 x
80 m, and is co-existing with the expanse of the chert
outcrop.
41CM150 - This site is located at the upland head of a
short drainage/tributary to the Guadalupe River. Tested
chert nodules and a few flakes are scattered along the slope
of the drainage. A light scatter of non-tested nodules are
also present on the surface. Soil depth on this site is
less deflated than on most of the upland sites, and ranges
from 5 to 15 em deep.
41CM151 - This site is located down drainage and on the
south slope of the same tributary from 41CM150. The soil is
deflated, exposing a very light scatter of tested chert
nodules, flakes and one thick biface. The site runs along a
continuous contour line for approximately 70 m (east-west
orientation) and 40 m north-south.
41CM152 - This site is located on a broad, upland
ridge.
Naturally occurring chert nodules are strewn across
the heavily deflated surface. Soil depth is less than 5 cm.
Intermixed with the chert nodules are tested nodules, cores,
flakes and thick bifaces. The cultural material extends for
a minimum area 30 x 30 m.
41CM153 - This site is located at the base of a slope

scattered across the slope. Soil depth is approximately 15
cm and
supports a stand of junipers and mesquite.
Interspersed with the cobbles are a few large flakes, two
unifaces, cores and tested cobbles.
The extent of this
cultural debris is approximately 30 x 30 m.
There is no
depth to the cultural material.
41CM154 - This site is located on the sloping nose on
the east side of Isaac Creek, at a bend in the creek. The
creek bottom and sides are composed of large cobbles,
probably related to Uvalde gravels. The site is on a slight

Page 8
terrace development above the creek's floodplain.
A heavy
growth of mesquite and green briars mixed with prickly pear
and grasses obscures the site's surface. The soil is very
shallow - less than 5 cm - and underlain by large gravels.
Cultural material consists of a light flake scatter and a
few cores distributed over an area 10 x 10 m. This site had
been previously recorded by M. Kohnitz in 1981.
The site
was not, however, assigned a permanent file number at that
time.
41CM155 - This site is located on the north slope of a
small drainage where chert nodules are eroding from the
exposed Edwards limestone. The slope is heavily deflated
with less than 10 em of soil occurring in pockets of the
limestone. A thin scatter of flakes cores and tested
nodules are in an area 20 x 20 m.
41KE84 - This site is on a bluff overlooking the
Guadalupe River.
The site is a thin lithic scatter
comprised of thick bifaces, cores, flakes, one thin biface
and a small amount of burned chert. There are no naturally
occurring chert outcroppings in the area.
The soil is
deflated with depths ranging from 0 to 20 cm with pockets of
soil as deep as 50 cm. Ten percent of the site has been
disturbed by a ranch road. Site area is estimated to be 300
x 50 m.
41KE85 - This site is located on a bench above the
Guadalupe River floodplain, on the east side of a small
drainage. The surface is deflated to the limestone bedrock
with some pockets of soil between 0 and 10 cm deep. Over
this surface is a light scatter of lithic materials
including flakes, cores, burned chert and a few thin biface
fragments.
The site boundaries are vague but extend
approximately 50 x 30 m.
41KE86 - This site is located on the east bank terrace
of an unnamed tributary to the Guadalupe River. The terrace
is relatively level with the site's feature - a burned rock
midden - rising 1 to 1.5 m above it. The site is comprised
of a burned limestone mound approximately 75 m in
circumference.
Artifacts found in and around the midden
include: bifaces, unifaces, cores, flakes, burned chert,
Pedernales dart points, and other unidentifiable dart point
fragments, and a ground stone mano. Shovel probes revealed
burned rock (some sandstone) to a depth of 20 cm when
bedrock was hit. The site has been plowed along the edges
resulting in some scattering of materials. Large limestone
blocks have been piled on the mound by the landowner as an

interfluvial ridge between two small tributaries to Big
Joshua Creek. The site consists of a scatter of burned
limestone, burned chert, flakes, cores, unifaces and biface
fragments. The site. has been heavily disturbed and possibly
destroyed by the construction of a stock tank. The soil is
o to 10 em deep. Some of the cultural materials might have
been hauled in to help construct the stock tank. Cultural
material is presently scattered over an area 200 x 50 m.
41KE88 - This site is located on the first floodplain
terrace on the west side of Little Joshua Creek. Burned
limestone, dart points (one Castroville and one Marcos),
unifaces, thin bifaces, flakes and cores are scattered on
the surface over an area approximately 60 x 60 m.
Shovel
probes revealed the cultural material extends to a depth of
40 cm. Plowing of the terrace probably exposed burned
cultural material.
The depth of the soil is unknown,
however it is at least 50 cm deep as derived from the shovel
probes. A large portion of the site may still be intact.
Historic Sites
41CM156 - This site is located in a small clearing 200
m east of the juncture of the Zorn to Comfort transmission
line and the Henne transmission line. The site consists of
a small storage shed 4 x 3 m. This building is of board and
batten construction with a corrugated steel roof. It rests
on oak stump pillars. The structure has a large double door
at one end and a window on' either side.
There is no
evidence that this building was ever lived in. The only
cultural artifacts around the building consisted of whiskey
bottles and old roofing debris. The owner, Mr. Faust, said
the structure had been used as a storage shed for as long as
he could remember.
41CM157 - This site 1s located 250 m west of FM 1102 on
the west terrace of York Creek. The site is a late 19th
century vernacular German house with an associated well and
a log outbuilding of more recent construction. The house is
a single wall balloon frame construction with two rooms.
The east side of the house has been removed and the house ;s
now being used for hay storage. A corrugated tin roof has
been added to the house. There is no historic debris in the
immediate area.

SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS
The survey of the 64-mile transmission line corridor
between Zorn and Comfort resulted in the location and
recording of 21 prehistoric sites and 2 historic sites.
A significant result of this survey is how the
distribution of sites across a geographic region can be
affected by the surficially exposed rock formations of that
region (Fig.
1).
If the 64-mile transmission line is
viewed as a transect across two geological components of the
Edwards Plateau, then the site distribution along this
transect might be significant in defining high probability
areas for predicting site locations on these geologic units.
The cultural resources along this transmission line are
dramatically clustered, with a large expanse separating the
two groups. In an attempt to describe and interpret this
distribution of sites four variables were defined as a basis
for comparison of these groups.
These variables are:
surface geology, physiography, water availability and site
type. Table 1 presents a description of each site using
these four variables.
The prehistoric sites cluster in two areas along the
transmission line. One area correlates with the location of
the chert bearing Edwards Formation limestone.
Sites
41CM140
152, 155 are all directly related to the
outcropping of chert nodules. 41CM153 and 154 are located
on the accumulated Uvalde gravels. These sixteen sites are
termed, in light of their assumed function,
"lithic
procurement stations", characterized by the presence of
quantities of unaltered lithic resources, tested lithic
resources, flakes, cores and thick bifaces. They are also
characterized by the lack of debris associated with
campsites such as finished lithic tools and burned rocks
indicative of features such as middens or hearths.
The
distribution of lithic procurement sites is determined by
the location of suitable lithic resources - i.e.
chert
outcrops, and does not seem to depend upon such factors as
water availability or food resources. This same conclusion
was reached by Brown (1982). It;s poss'ible that because
the chert outcrops are not near reliable water sources, and
probably not near food resources, the type of sites
associated with them would be single purpose/activity and
not a result of accumulation from multiple use.
The second clustering of sites is near the Comfort end
of the transmission line where the corridor crosses the

are situated on the Glen Rose Formation which is barren of
chert outcroppings. In this area the sites are clustered
along the reliable water sources of the Guadalupe River and

the spring fed tributaries of Big Joshua and Little Joshua
creeks.
Sites 41KE84 - 88 are all associated with these
water sources. The site morphology changes from those on
the
Edwards
limestone.
The total lack of naturally
occurring lithic sources; the addition of finished tool
forms
including time diagnostic dart points; and the
occurrence of large amounts of burned rock signifying
hearths or middens, combine to define a completely different
site morphology than those seen along the chert outcroppings
of th~ Edwards
limestone.
These sites are termed
multi-activity campsites. Sites of this type are the most
common recorded in the four county region since systematic
research has dealt primarily with lowland areas along major
river systems.
The area between these two site clusters is important
in that prehistoric cultural materials were totally lacking.
The same variables discussed in the site cluster areas
provide an explanation for this gap. The surface geology in
this area is the Glen Rose Formation which is barren of
chert,
thus
sites associated with the natural chert
outcroppings are not present.
Also, water availability
differs from those sections farther west or east. The
upland positioning of this section limits readily available
water to the amount of rainfall collected in the small,
intermittent drainages.
Another factor is the lack of
natural
springs in this area.
To the west are the
spring-feed creeks of Little and Big Joshua where some of
the springs continue to flow today. On the east end of the
line are the many springs and seeps associated with the
Balcones Fault zone. The zone between the site clusterings
is devoid of the two assets most readily associated with one
or the other group, lithic resources and water.
The potential use of the information derived from this
survey is two-fold. First, the distribution of sites across
the surface geologic formations can be useful in predicting
site locations along these geologic units by defining the
physiographic and environmental variables involved.
Second, the environmental variables of lithic resources
and reliable water supply are independently mapped across
the transect. This separation, and the reasons for it, may
be beneficial to archeologists trying to understand sites
where the two variables are coexistent with possible other
variables.
For those sites located along water drainageways, it is
important to note that along this transect the sites
associated with water were found near reliable, if not

sources and not along intermittent stream

RECOMMENDATIONS
A total of 21 prehistoric and 2 historic sites were
located and recorded along the transmission corridor between
Zorn and Comfort, Texas. Of the prehistoric sites, two are
burned rock middens, three are lithic scatters and 16 are
lithic procurement/quarry areas.
The two burned
rock
middens - 41KE86 and 41KE88 - were recommended for avoidance
with no additional
assessment
unless
avoidance was
impossible.
Site 41KE86 is the only site recorded on this
survey with the potential for nomination to the National
Register of Historic
Places.
LCRA construction and
maintenance crews will route around this location and the
landowner
is
practicing
protective maintenance.
No
designation as a State Archeological Landmark nor nomination
to the National Register is thus warranted at this time.
Sites 41KE84, 85 and 87 have been so heavily disturbed
by plowing, roads and stock tank construction that little,
if any, intact cultural manifestations are expected.
These
are not recommended for any further assessment. Sites
41CM140-155 are lithic procurement/quarry stations and are
characteristically
located on deflated surfaces where
sheetwash and other erosional agents affect the
site
condition and artifact distribution.
Six of these sites
(41CM140-145) are located in an existing transmission l;ne
corridor where vehicular and construction disturbance have
already affected the sites. No further work is recommended
for
any of the
16 lithic procurement/quarry sites
(41CM140-155).
The two historic sites, 41CM156 and 41CM157, were
recommended for avoidance. Site 41CM156 ;s a storage shed
currently in use which the landowner has contracted with the
Lower Colorado River Authority for its protection by
avoidance. This site does not qualify for nomination to the
National Register of Historic Places nor for designation as
a State Archeological Landmark.
Site 41CM157 has also been recommended for avoidance.
If avoidance is not possible, then further assessment of the
site to determine its National Reigster of Historic places
potential will be necessary. The delapidated condition of
the house structure and the lack of any associated historic
debris limits this site's potential for holding significant
information about the late 19th century.
